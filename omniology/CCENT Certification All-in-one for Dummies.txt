Introduction
T
he CCENT certification is a new, fast-growing certification that tests 
your knowledge of basic Cisco device-management and networking 
concepts. It is a great stepping stone to the CCNA certification and other 
Cisco certification tracks. The CCENT exam tests your knowledge of 
real-world networking concepts and Cisco features found on most 
networks today!
About This Book
CCENT Certification All-In-One For Dummies is designed to be a hands-on, 
practical guide to help you pass the CCENT certification exam. This book is 
written in a way that helps you not only understand complex technical content, 
but also prepares you to apply that knowledge to real-world scenarios.
I understand the value of a book that covers the points needed to pass 
the exam, but I also understand the value of ensuring that the information 
helps you perform IT-related tasks when you are on the job. That is what 
this book offers you — key points to pass the exam combined with practical 
information to help you in the real world, which means that you can use this 
book in more than one way.
 
✦ An exam preparation tool: Because my goal is to help you pass the 
CCENT certification exam, this book is packed with exam-specific 
information and tips to help you with tricky exam questions. You should 
understand everything that is in this book before taking the exam, but 
to identify key points that you must know, look for icons named For the 
Exam. In those paragraphs, you will find helpful tips on topics you are 
certain to be tested on.
 
✦ A reference: Rely on my extensive experience in the IT industry not 
only to study for (and pass) the exam, but also to help you perform 
common network-related tasks on the job. I hope you find this book a 
useful tool that you can refer to time and time again in your career as 
you configure networks and Cisco devices.
Conventions Used in This Book
Each chapter in this book has different elements that help you prepare to 
pass your CCENT, including the following features:

Conventions Used in This Book

✦ Quick Assessments: Located at the beginning of each chapter is a Quick 
Assessment section that gives a number of questions related to the 
chapter content for you to assess whether you have the knowledge 
already in that chapter. It is highly recommended to read all chapters in 
the book, but if you find you are limited on study time you may want to 
focus on the topics you know the least about — the Quick Assessments 
help you determine what topics you know and what you need more 
work on.
 
✦ Icons: Look for the icons used in each chapter to draw your attention to 
information needed for the exam or in the real world. For more details 
on the icons I use, check out the later section, “Icons Used in This 
Book.”
 
✦ Chapter Summary: Found at the end of each chapter, the “Chapter 
Summary” section covers key points you should remember for the 
exam.
 
✦ Labs: Lab exercises offer the opportunity to get your hands dirty with a 
particular topic with real-world experience performing specific tasks. In 
order to totally grasp the topics discussed in a chapter, be sure to perform 
the lab exercises. The CCENT certification has a number of simulators 
that will test your real-world knowledge so you really need to know how 
to perform the different tasks to pass the exam. Due to the fact that you 
may have different configurations when you do the labs, there are no 
lab answers within the Labs section.
 
✦ Prep Test: Following each “Chapter Summary” section, you can find 
questions to help review the chapter content and prepare you for the 
CCENT certification exam. Be sure to answer the review questions in 
each chapter! Then, after you finish reading the entire book and do the 
lab exercises, check out the practice exams on the companion CD-ROM, 
which is designed to function like the real exam, with the same level of 
difficulty.
 
✦ Monofont text: To help you distinguish commands you type or text 
you should see on the screen I apply the monofont style to the 
text. Examples where you see this style are on router commands, IP 
addresses, and names of devices.
 
✦ Boldface text: To help identify new commands that you are learning 
within a code listing the boldface text style is applied. Although you 
should read over all code in a code example, using the boldface text 
will help draw your attention to the new commands presented in a code 
listing.

How This Book Is Organized
Foolish Assumptions
I make a few assumptions about you as a reader and have written this book 
with these assumptions in mind:
 
✦ You are interested in obtaining the CCENT Certification. Anyone who 
is looking to get a solid introduction to networking and how to manage a 
Cisco device can use this book, but the focus of this book is concentrated 
on the exam objectives needed to pass the CCENT certification exam.
 
✦ You have Cisco equipment to work on. To perform the labs in the book, 
you will need to have two Cisco switches and two Cisco routers. If you 
do not have access to the Cisco hardware, you can search online for a 
simulator to purchase. An example simulator you can purchase is the 
Network simulator for CCENT from www.certexams.com.
 
✦ You will study hard and do as much hands-on work as possible. There 
is a lot of content on the CCENT exam, and you will most likely need to 
read over the information contained in this book a few times to ensure 
that you understand it. You should also experiment as much as possible 
on the actual devices after you read a particular topic. For example, 
after you read about CDP on a router, be sure to spend some time trying 
the commands on your router to ensure you are comfortable with what 
the protocol can do and what it offers as a feature.
 
✦ You will read the chapters of this book in the order presented. 
Although you are not required to read the chapters in order, it is highly 
recommended as chapters that appear later in the book assume you 
have read, or have the knowledge, of the previous chapters. For example, 
during the routing discussion I assume you have already read the 
subnetting and variable-length subnet mask (VLSM) chapter and use 
those terms within the routing chapter. It is best to read the book from 
cover to cover at least once and then you can jump to the chapters you 
need more work on.
How This Book Is Organized
Like all All-In-One For Dummies books, chapters are organized into minibooks. 
The chapters in each minibook are related by a specific theme or topic. For 
example, Book I — “Networking Basics” — contains all the basic networking 
information, including explanations of terminology and devices.

4
How This Book Is Organized
This book is designed as a study tool that you can read from cover to cover; 
reading the chapters in the order they are presented. I recommend that 
you read through the book at least once in the order it is presented and 
then after that pick the chapters that you need to revisit. The reason I 
recommend reading the chapters in order is because each chapter is written 
assuming you have the knowledge of the previous chapters.
The following sections outline what you can find in each minibook.
Book I: Networking Basics
In this minibook, you discover what the CCENT certification is all about and 
what you will be tested on when taking the exam. You also find out about the 
basics of networking, starting with network types, cables, and devices, and 
then move on to the basics of IP addressing and the very important exam 
topic of subnetting.
Book II: Cisco Device Basics
In Book II, you are introduced to Cisco devices and the basics of how they 
work. You first read about the physical aspects of the devices, such as the 
ports, and then move on to discover the Cisco operating system and the 
boot process. You then learn how to perform some basic configuration 
tasks, such as configuring interfaces and passwords before finding out how 
to back up your configuration, discover neighbors, and manage devices 
remotely with Telnet. This minibook finishes with a discussion on network 
services like name resolution, DHCP, and NAT.
Book III: Routing and Switching
Book III first focuses on the routing process and how data is routed from one 
network to another, and then discusses static routing and dynamic routing 
protocols and how to control the routing process with the routing table. 
The minibook then changes focus to switches and talks about basic features 
of the switch, and I tell you how to perform basic configuration tasks on 
switches. The final topic in this minibook is troubleshooting, which covers 
basic troubleshooting steps and commands you can use on Cisco devices.
Book IV: Advanced Topics
The final minibook starts with two chapters on network security and introduces 
the security best practices you need to know for the CCENT certification 
exam. The minibook then continues with chapters on wireless networks and 
introduces you to wide area networks (WANs).

Appendixes
Appendix A gives you an overview of what you can find on the CD-ROM that 
accompanies the book. Please have a look at this section to get the scoop on 
valuable resources on the book’s companion CD-ROM, such the Test Engine.
Appendix B is an exam-objective mapping table that lets you know where in 
the book you can find details on each of the exam objectives. This is very 
useful when you are preparing for the exam; it can help you make sure that 
you know each point in the objectives.
Online Cheatsheet
To help you prepare for the CCENT certification exam, and to give you a 
quick listing of commands for the real world, I have created an online 
cheatsheet that is designed to give you some of the core facts to remember 
for the exam. Be sure to read and understand this book, but the online 
resource is there as a good refresher.
The URL for the online cheatsheet is:

Where to Go from Here
 
Detailed information that is not needed for the exams or that is a step above 
the knowledge you absolutely need to know for the exams is indicated with a 
Technical Stuff icon.
 
This icon lets you know when you can find accompanying information or 
supporting documents on the CD-ROM. 
Where to Go from Here
The CCENT certification is considered an entry-level certification for 
candidates interested in a certification career with Cisco products. It provides 
a great networking foundation for other certification paths, such as these:
 
✦ CCNA: The logical next step would be to take the ICND2 exam, which is 
exam number 640-816. The 640-816 exam combined with your CCENT 
certification earns you the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) 
certification.
 
✦ Other Vendors: After receiving your CCNA certification, you could look 
to other certifications, such as Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist 
(MCTS), or even look to security certifications such as SCP’s Security 
Certified Network Professional (SCNP) or EC-Council’s Certified Ethical 
Hacker (CEH) certification.

W
elcome to the world of Cisco certification! If you are reading this 
book, you have most likely decided that you are interested in 
furthering your career in networking by attaining your first Cisco 
certification — the Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician (CCENT). I 
have to say that the CCENT certification is one of my favorite certifications 
because (though it is considered an entry-level certification) it ensures the 
exam candidate has basic networking knowledge and knows the fundamentals 
of Cisco device configuration.
This chapter is designed to give you information on what to expect on the 
CCENT certification exam and how to go about registering for it. Study hard 
and good luck!
The Value of CCENT Certification
For years, the first Cisco certification exam you would have taken to attain 
a Cisco certification was the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA). This 
has changed in recent years, and now the first Cisco certification that 
certification candidates work toward is the CCENT. The reason for the 
change is that the CCNA exam topics that are now covered have expanded 
to the point that someone new to Cisco networking would find it very 
difficult to know the details of all the exam topics — so the CCNA was 
broken into two different exams.
Cisco decided to provide two options for someone looking to obtain a 
CCNA. The first option allows an individual to take two exams, known as 
the Interconnecting Cisco Network Devices (ICND) exams. The two exams are 
known as the ICND1 and ICND2; the ICND1 is the first exam, and after 
passing it, you can do your ICND2 exam to reach your CCNA certification. 

CCENT Exam Details

The second option available to someone looking to obtain a CCNA is to take 
one CCNA exam — an option for those individuals who feel they are up for 
the challenge of taking on all exam topics in one exam.
Cisco also decided that if someone was to take and pass the ICND1 exam, 
they would earn the CCENT certification — the first Cisco certification in the 
many Cisco certification paths. The CCENT is a very hands-on certification 
exam that tests the exam-taker’s networking knowledge and basic configuration 
and troubleshooting skills with Cisco devices. 
Cisco has many different certification paths that IT professionals can take, 
such as the Routing and Switching path, Security path, and Wireless 
path. The CCENT certification is the first certification exam in all the Cisco 
certification paths and, as a result, has become a very popular certification.
Obtaining the CCENT certification is your way of proving to employers and 
customers that you have the skills to manage Cisco devices in a small 
network environment. 
CCENT Exam Details
You earn the CCENT certification after you pass Cisco’s ICND1 exam, which 
is exam number 640-822. You can schedule your exam appointment at any 
VUE testing center by calling one of the following phone numbers or by 
scheduling it online at www.vue.com/cisco/schedule. Pearson VUE is a 
company that provides computer-based testing and certification exams and 
is the testing provider selected by Cisco for the Cisco certification exams.
 
✦ United States and Canada: 1-877-404-EXAM (1-877-404-3926)
 
✦ Other Countries: For other parts of the world, check out VUE’s Web site 
at www.vue.com/cisco/contact.
The exam is approximately 90 minutes in length, and you will be presented 
with 40 to 50 questions. The exam is available in a number of different 
languages, such as English, Japanese, Chinese, and French — to name just 
a few.
In order to take the CCENT certification exam, you must be 18 years old 
or older if you wish to take the exam without a parent’s consent. If you are 
between 13 and 17 years old, you may still take the exam but only with a 
parent’s consent.
If for some reason you do not pass the exam, Cisco requires that you wait 
six days before retaking the exam (five days from the day after your last 
exam). After passing the CCENT certification exam, the certification is valid 
for three years, at which point you will need to renew it.

What to Expect on the CCENT Exam
The following summarizes the exam details you should know when you 
schedule your exam:
 
✦ Exam Number: 640-822
 
✦ Time Limit: 90 minutes
 
✦ Number of Questions: 40–50 questions
 
✦ Passing Score: 804 (based on a scale of 300–1000)
 
✦ Test Provider: Pearson VUE
 
✦ Available Languages: English, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, Russian, 
Korean, French, Portuguese
 
The CCENT certification exam is a nonadaptive exam, meaning that you 
receive all 40–50 questions. Adaptive exams are shorter exams as they move 
on to the next topic once you answer a question in a topic area 
correctly — this is not the case with the CCENT certification exam! Also 
note that Cisco does not publish the passing score and scoring details as 
they are subject to change.
What to Expect on the CCENT Exam
A big part of passing any certification exam is trying to be as prepared as 
possible. This means knowing what to expect on the exam as far as the 
technical content you need to know and the style of questions on the exam.
Types of questions
The CCENT certification exam has a number of different style questions. 
Each style of question is designed to test you in a different way. For example, 
the multiple-choice questions are designed to test your knowledge level 
(the theory), while the simulation questions will test your hands-on skills — 
ensuring you can perform the task.
The following are some of the different types of question formats you will 
find on the CCENT certification exam:
 
✦ Multiple-choice, single answer: This type of question will present you 
with a question and then list a number of choices as potential answers. 
You are required to select the best answer from the list of choices.
 
✦ Multiple-choice, multiple answer: With this type of question, you are 
asked a question and you need to choose multiple answers from the list 
of choices. This type of question will normally specify “select all that 
apply” or may tell you how many items to select, such as “select three.”

12
What to Expect on the CCENT Exam
 
✦ Drag-and-drop: These questions are a little more interactive and typically 
involve you dragging items from the left side of the screen and dropping 
them in the correct place on the right side of the screen. For example, 
you may be given a list of definitions on the right side of the screen and 
you need to drop the correct term onto the proper definition.
 
✦ Fill-in-the-blank: You may receive a fill-in-the-blank question that 
requires you to read it and (instead of selecting the correct answer) type 
in the correct answer.
 
✦ Testlet: A testlet is a group of questions that applies (group) to the same 
scenario. You will first be presented with a scenario and then you will be 
given four or five multiple-choice questions to answer for that scenario.
 
✦ Simlet: A simlet is similar to testlet in the sense that you are given a 
scenario and have to answer multiple questions for the scenario. The 
difference is that the scenario is in the form of a simulation. With a 
simlet, you are asked multiple questions and, in order to answer the 
questions, you will need to use router commands to view the configuration 
of the router in the simulator.
 
✦ Router Simulation: Router simulations are a popular type of question 
in Cisco exams. With a simulation, you are given a number of tasks that 
need to be performed in the simulator and you are graded on how you 
do with your configuration within the simulation.
 
It is very important that you get familiar with how to answer each of the 
question types discussed above. I recommend visiting Cisco’s Web site and 
go through the Cisco Certification Exam Tutorial. This exam tutorial shows 
you what each of the question types look like as well as how you go about 
answering the questions. The URL for the exam tutorial is
www.cisco.com/web/learning/wwtraining/certprog/training/cert_
exam_tutorial.html
You can also prepare for the style of questions by taking the exam tutorial 
that is provided with the actual CCENT certification exam. When you actually 
begin your exam on test day, Cisco will ask if you would like to take the exam 
tutorial. I highly recommend doing the exam tutorial as it will give you a 
chance to see how to use the test engine. It only takes a few minutes to do 
the tutorial, and the time does not come off your exam time. Again, you want 
to be as prepared as possible!
 
One last point to make about the exam questions is that you cannot mark 
questions and go back to them at a later time like you can with Microsoft or 
CompTIA exams. Once you have answered a question, you cannot change 
the answer after moving on to the next question. Also note that it is best to 
select an answer to a question even if you do not know the answer because 
you are unable to go back to the question at a later time.

Exam objectives
The CCENT certification is very popular because it tests the exam candidate 
on basic networking concepts and the skills needed to configure Cisco 
devices in a small network environment. The following is a list of the major 
exam objectives that you will be tested on, with a quick description of that 
objective. For full detail on the exam objectives and the chapters of this 
book that cover each exam objective, take a look at Appendix B: CCENT 
Exam Reference Matrix.
 
✦ Describe the operation of data networks. This objective is designed 
to test your knowledge of basic networking concepts, and it includes 
an understanding of the OSI model, the different types of networking 
devices, and the pathway of communication on a network.
 
✦ Implement a small switch network. This objective tests your knowledge 
of the different types of connectors that exist on Cisco switches and the 
basic concepts of Cisco switches. You will also be tested on configuration 
tasks such as disabling ports and configuring port security on a switch.
 
✦ Implement an IP addressing scheme and IP services to meet network 
requirements for a small branch office. This objective is designed to 
test your knowledge of basic network services such as DHCP, DNS, 
and NAT. You are also tested on IP addressing and troubleshooting 
communication problems that are due to IP addressing issues.
 
✦ Implement a small routed network. In this objective, you are tested 
on the basic configuration of a router and the routing process. You are 
required to know how to implement static routing and dynamic routing 
using the RIP and RIPv2 routing protocols. This objective is also 
designed to cover tasks such as backing up your router configuration.
 
✦ Explain and select the appropriate administrative tasks required for a 
WLAN. This objective is designed to test you on basic wireless terminology 
and security protocols surrounding wireless. You are also tested on the 
purpose of wireless components such as SSID and security protocols 
such as WEP, WPA, and WPA2.
 
✦ Identify security threats to a network and describe general methods to 
mitigate those threats. This objective tests you on basic security principles 
with networks and networking equipment. You are also tested on best 
practices with router configuration and location of equipment.

Using This Book to Prepare for the Exam
Using This Book to Prepare for the Exam
 
The Cisco CCENT certification is not a certification that you can pass by 
only reading the chapters in this book. It is important to make sure that after 
reading a chapter, you spend some time on an actual Cisco device or in a 
simulator practicing the topics covered in that chapter. You can download 
simulators from many different Web sites for a fee; for example, you can 
purchase the Network simulator for CCENT from www.certexams.com.
The best way to use this book to prepare for the exam is to first read a chapter, 
starting with the Quick Assessments section, to determine how much you 
know about the topic before you start reading. Then, read the chapter 
again — but this time, spend some time trying out the commands that are 
discussed in the chapter.
After practicing the commands as you read through the chapter, try the lab 
exercises at the end of the chapter. The lab exercises are designed to give 
you the hands-on skills you need to pass the CCENT exam.
After you have done the lab exercises for a chapter, do the review questions 
located in the Prep Test at the end of the chapter. These questions are 
designed to review the concepts presented in the chapter and give you an 
idea of the types of questions you may be asked on the exam.
After you have gone through the book two or three times and read and 
practiced the lab exercises, try the practice exams located on the book’s 
companion CD-ROM.
 
I highly recommend not doing the practice tests on the CD until you have 
completed the entire book. I know a lot of people try the practice exams as 
they are reading through the book just to gauge their progress — as a result, 
they know all the practice test answers by the time they are done with the 
book. I think the practice tests will be better served if you don’t try them 
until you have 100 percent completed the book (and labs) and then want to 
see how you would do if you were to take the real exam.
 
The CCENT certification is a hands-on, practical certification, so be sure to 
get as much hands-on experience as possible as you are studying each 
chapter.
On Your Test Day
Over the years, I have taken many different certification exams and picked 
up some good habits. (I am sure I have some bad habits as well, but I will 
keep those to myself.) This section outlines some basic steps you should 
take to make sure that you are prepared for your exam.

On Your Test Day
Arriving at the test site
The first thing you want to do on test day is make sure that you show up to 
the testing center early so that you can familiarize yourself with the facility 
and do things like get a drink and use the restroom before your exam starts.
Make sure that you bring two forms of ID, and one of them has to have a 
picture. Also, note that Cisco requires the test center take a photo of you on 
test day, and this photo is printed on your score card.
Getting lots of rest
Another habit I have learned over the years is that sometimes it is not best 
to cram any more information in my head the night before the exam. For 
most people, it is more effective to get a good night’s sleep the night before 
the exam. Be sure to eat a good breakfast when you wake up in the morning 
before heading out to take your exam.
Also, if you are a morning person you may want to make sure that you 
schedule the exam earlier in the day. For me, I do not seem to do too well 
on an exam if I book the exam after lunchtime. I seem to think clearer in the 
morning, so as a result, I make sure I book all my exams around 10 a.m.
Answering questions
When you are answering questions on the exam, always read the questions 
thoroughly and be sure you understand the question before looking at the 
answer choices. When you do look at the answer choices, always eliminate 
the obvious choices first and then choose the best answer from those 
remaining. And remember that your first instinct is usually always correct, 
so go with your gut if you are not 100 percent sure.

Understanding Network Types
The purpose of a network is to allow a number of systems to share 
resources such as files and printers, or services such as an Internet 
connection. Networks come in all different shapes and sizes, and there are 
different terms for the different-size networks. In the most basic network 
setup, you will have a few systems connected to a central device such as a 
switch. The switch acts as a connection point for all systems on this small 
network. (See Figure 2-1.) When WorkstationA sends data to WorkstationB, 
the data leaves WorkstationA and travels along the cable that reaches 
the switch. The switch is then responsible for sending that data on to 
WorkstationB. (There is a lot more to say about a switch, but let’s save that 
for the switch discussion; see Book I, Chapter 3, and Book III, Chapters 3 and 4).

There are two major categories of networks — you can have a local area 
network (LAN), which is a network in a single location, or you can have a 
wide area network (WAN) that spans multiple locations. The following 
sections discuss LANs and WANs.
Local area network
The term that we use in the networking world for systems that are connected 
in a small network environment, such as a home network or an office 
network in a building, is local area network (LAN). A LAN is a network 
environment where all systems and devices are physically located in close 
proximity to one another, like in an office building.
LANs use LAN-type networking devices such as workstations, servers, 
printers, and switches to make up the network. If the LAN is made up of a 
number of workstations that are sharing resources with one another, it is 
called a peer-to-peer network; if there is a central server that the workstations 
connect to, it is called a client-server network.

Understanding Network Types
Wide area network
A wide area network (WAN) is a type of network where there is a large 
distance between network devices. For example, if your company has a LAN 
in New York and you want it to connect to your company’s other LAN in 
Toronto, this is considered a WAN because of the distance between the two 
offices.
WAN environments use what we call WAN-type devices, such as routers 
and telecommunication links. Figure 2-2 shows a typical WAN environment 
where there is distance between the network devices.

Identifying Network Topologies
Before I get too much into LAN and WAN devices, I first define some basic 
networking components, such as topologies, cable types, and access methods. I 
then piece these components together to help define some of the very 
popular network architectures found in network environments today.
Identifying Network Topologies
The term topology means “layout,” so a network topology defines the network 
layout — meaning how the network devices are positioned on the network. 
There are three major network topologies: the bus, ring, and star topologies. 
This section outlines these topologies and also discusses a fourth topology 
known as a hybrid topology.
Bus topology
The bus topology was popular years ago when networking began. It involved 
having a main cable (known as a trunk) that all systems would connect to. 
(See Figure 2-3.)
 
Figure 2-3: 
A bus 
topology.

Terminator
Terminator
When looking at Figure 2-3, you notice that there are terminators at either 
end of the trunk. The terminators at either end of the trunk are designed to 
absorb the electrical signal off the network. If there were no terminators to 
absorb the signal, then the signal would bounce back and collide with other 
data on the cable.

Book I
Chapter 2
Introduction 
to Network 
Technologies
23
Identifying Network Topologies
When WorkstationA sends data to WorkstationB, that data leaves 
WorkstationA and reaches the trunk in the bus topology. The electrical signal 
then travels the length of the trunk in both directions before it reaches the 
terminators and is absorbed off the main cable. Note that the data is seen by 
all systems on the network, but only WorkstationB processes the information, 
as it is the only intended recipient of the information.
One of the major drawbacks to a bus topology is that if there is a break 
in the trunk, the entire network fails. This is because the break in the 
main cable creates a nonterminated end that causes the signal to bounce 
back and eventually collide with other data. When the data collides, it is 
destroyed and needs to be retransmitted.
Ring topology
The ring topology (shown in Figure 2-4) has all systems connected in a 
circle, or ring. The data travels around the ring with each system regenerating 
the signal so that it can move to the next system (also known as a node on 
the network; a node is a system or device that exists on the network) in the 
ring. Like a bus topology, if there is a break in the ring the entire network 
will go down.
 
Figure 2-4: 
Looking 
at a ring 
topology.

C
Server
 
Most ring topologies implement fault tolerance by providing two rings. When 
the primary ring fails the secondary ring is used to carry the data.

24
Identifying Network Topologies
Star topology
The star topology is a network layout that involves using a central device 
such as a switch as the connection point for all systems on the network. 
When looking at Figure 2-5, you notice that when WorkstationA wants to 
send data to WorkstationD, the data travels from WorkstationA to the 
switch, which then sends the data on to WorkstationD.

device such 
as a switch

Star topologies are popular today, and one of the reasons is that a break in 
the cable affects only the system connected to that cable — the rest of the 
network still functions.
Hybrid topology
Although a star topology is very popular today, many companies use a 
hybrid topology, which is a combination of bus, ring, and star topologies. 
For example, many companies use a main cable to cover the distance 
(known as a bus topology) between two switches, which create their own star 
topologies. (See Figure 2-6.) Some network professionals call this specific 
hybrid topology a star-bus topology.

Looking at Cable Types
To add to your networking terminology, not only do you need to be familiar 
with topologies (network layouts), but you also need to be familiar with the 
different types of network cables that connect all the systems together.
This section discusses the popular network cable types and identifies the 
key concepts you need to be familiar with as far as cables go with the CCENT 
certification exam.

26
Looking at Cable Types
Coaxial cable
The first type of network cabling to discuss is coaxial cabling. Coaxial cable, 
also known as coax, was very popular in the early years of networking and is 
still seen today with your TV’s cable hookup. Coax cable is more rigid than 
other cable types and is sometimes hard to work with.
Coax cable has a copper wire at the core that carries the data in the form of 
an electrical signal. This copper wire is surrounded by insulation, which is 
made up of a braided wire and metal foil that helps protect the signal from 
outside interference.
Networking with coax cabling started with two types of coaxial cabling — 
Thinnet (see Figure 2-7) and Thicknet. Thinnet and Thicknet get their names 
for obvious reasons: Thinnet is the thinner cable type and Thicknet is the 
thicker cable type.
Thinnet is one-quarter-inch thick and is known as the RG-58 grade coax 
cable. Thinnet has a maximum distance of 185 meters (606 feet) and a transfer 
rate of 10 Mbps. Thinnet uses a BNC connector to connect systems to the 
cable.
 
Figure 2-7: 
Looking at 
a coaxial 
cable and 
a BNC 
connector.
 
 
For the CCENT exam know the lengths of the different cable types in meters, 
as that is what the exam will test you on.

Book I
Chapter 2
Introduction 
to Network 
Technologies
27
Looking at Cable Types
As mentioned, Thicknet is the thicker of the two cable types, as it is 
one-half-inch thick. Thicknet gets its extra thickness by having an extra layer 
of insulation to help protect the signal traveling along the copper wire from 
outside interference. This protection and a thicker-diameter copper core 
allow the signal to travel farther, so Thicknet has a maximum distance of 500 
meters (1,640 feet). Thicknet has a transfer rate of 10 Mbps and is known as 
the RG-8 grade cabling. Table 2-1 summarizes coax cabling.

Thicknet uses a different connector than Thinnet’s BNC connector; it uses 
what is known as a vampire tap to connect stations to the Thicknet cable. 
The term vampire tap comes from the fact that the vampire tap is a device 
that connects to the coax cable by having “teeth” that cut through the outer 
layers of the cable and make contact with the copper core.
Twisted-pair cabling
You are not likely to see a lot of coax cable on networks today — a more 
popular cable type to discuss is twisted-pair cabling. Twisted-pair cabling 
gets its name by having eight wires divided into four pairs of wires, with 
each wire in a pair being twisted around one another throughout the length 
of the cable. (See Figure 2-8.) The purpose of the twist is to help protect 
against interference.
There are two types of twisted-pair cabling — shielded twisted pair (STP) and 
unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable. Both types of cabling use eight wires 
that are placed inside a jacket to cover the wires, but STP has an extra layer 
of shielding in the jacket to help protect against interference.
Twisted-pair cabling has a maximum distance of 100 meters (328 feet) and 
uses what is known as an RJ-45 connector (see Figure 2-9) to connect the 
cable to a system. The transfer rate supported by twisted pair depends on 
the category of the cable — Table 2-2 displays the different categories and 
their transfer rates.

28

The telephone also uses twisted pair cabling, but there are only four wires 
in the cable instead of the eight wires found in a network cable. The phone 
cable uses an RJ-11 connector, which is similar to an RJ-45 connector but 
smaller.

For the CCENT exam, be sure to know the different categories of UTP 
cabling! You should focus on CAT 5, 5e, and CAT 6 for the exam.

Today’s popular category of twisted-pair cabling is Cat 5e (which has a 
transfer rate of 1 Gbps) and Cat 6 (which has a transfer rate of 10 Gbps).
Fiber-optic cabling
The final type of network cabling to discuss is fiber-optic cabling. As shown 
in Figure 2-10, fiber-optic cabling is totally different than coax and twisted 
pair, as it has a glass or plastic core instead of a copper core, and it sends 
pulses of light that travel through the core as opposed to an electrical signal 
that travels through the copper.

Looking at Cable Types
Just as there are different types of coax and twisted-pair cabling, there are 
different types of fiber-optic cabling. The two types of fiber-optic cabling are 
single-mode fiber (SMF) and multimode fiber (MMF).
SMF uses a single ray of light to transmit the data. The ray of light is known 
as a mode — hence the term single-mode fiber-optic cabling! SMF is the 
fiber-optic cable type used for long distances, such as 40 kilometers (131,233 
feet).
MMF sends multiple rays of light at a time, with each ray of light running on 
different reflection angles. MMF is the fiber-optic cable type used for short 
distances, such as 2 kilometers (6,561 feet).
Fiber-optic cabling has a number of different types of connectors that are 
used to connect a system to the cable media. Three popular connector types 
for fiber-optic cabling are the SC, ST, and the LC connectors. (See Figure 2-11.)

Fiber-optic 
cabling uses 
the SC (top), 
ST (middle),

Connecting devices to one another
For the CCENT certification exam, you need to know the details of when to 
use different types of cabling, such as the straight-through cable, the 
crossover cable, and the rollover cable. This section discusses when to use 
each of those cable types.
Straight-through cable
The straight-through cable is the techie term for a normal twisted-pair network 
cable that connects a system to a switch. The straight-through cable gets its 
name because each of the eight wires in the cable retains its position within 
the cable from one end to another. For example, the third wire is the third 
wire at both ends.
Let’s look at why positioning of the wires in the connector is important. 
When you plug the RJ-45 connector of a UTP cable into a computer, the 
wires make contact with pins in the RJ-45 port of the network card. For RJ-45 
ports on a computer, the important pins are pins 1, 2, 3, and 6.
Pins 1 and 2 are the transmit pins (TX) for sending data, while pins 3 and 6 
are the receive pins (RX) for receiving data. When connecting the system to 
a switch on the network, the transmit and receive pins are reversed on the 
switch (as shown in Figure 2-12).
 
The + and the - found with the TX and RX represent the positive (+) and 
negative (-) wires within each pair that are used to carry the positive and 
negative voltages.

When you use a straight-through cable to connect to a switch, you see that 
the transmit pins on one end of the cable (wires in the cable) are connected 
to the receive pins on the other end of the cable. This allows for data being 
sent (transmitted) from one end to be received on the other end.
If the transmit and receive pins on the switch had not been “switched,” then 
you would be sending out the transmit pins on one system, but the data 
could not be received — the wire would be connecting a transmit pin to a 
transmit pin.
 
Remember that the straight-through cable is used to connect dissimilar 
devices together. For example, you use a straight-through cable to connect a 
system to a switch or a router to a switch.
Crossover cable
From time to time, you will want to connect similar devices together in a 
network situation. For example, you may want to connect two computers 
together or even two switches together.
If you want to connect two systems to one another via a direct connection 
from one network card to another, you will not be able to use a straight-through 
cable, as it will connect the transmit pins on one system to the transmit pins 
on another system. (See Figure 2-13.)
Looking at Figure 2-13, you can see that the two workstations will not be 
able to communicate because the transmit pins are not making contact with 
the receive pins on the other end. To fix this, we need to change the order 
of the wires on one end of the twisted-pair cable. On one end of the cable, 
you will put wires 1 and 2 in the position of wires 3 and 6 and place wires 3 
and 6 in the position of 1 and 2, thus creating what is known as a crossover 
cable. This will allow WorkstationA and WorkstationB to be able to send and 
receive data directly with one another without using a hub or switch. (See 
Figure 2-14.)

Remember that crossover cables are used to connect similar devices 
together — such as two systems, two switches, or a system to a router. 
(They are both considered hosts on the network.)
The last thing I want to mention about crossover cables is that most 
companies make it a policy that a crossover cable that is purchased or cre-
ated must be a different color than a straight-through cable. The reason is 
you do not want to accidentally use the wrong cable, thinking it is the right 
cable — you could be troubleshooting why a system cannot communicate 
on the network for hours only to find out that the problem is you are using 
the wrong type of cable. Most companies will ensure that all crossover 
cables are yellow or red, while the straight-through cables are grey or blue.
Rollover cable
The final type of cable to discuss is a rollover cable. The rollover cable 
(also known as a console cable) is used to connect the serial port on your 

34
Accessing the Network with Access Methods
system to a router or switch so you can configure the router or switch. Note 
that your system will still have a network connection to the switch using 
a straight-through cable, but for management purposes, we use a rollover 
cable.
The rollover cable (see Figure 2-15) is normally a light-blue cable (I have also 
seen black rollovers) and is flat instead of rounded like a twisted-pair cable. 
The reason they call it a rollover is that all of the wires in the cable change 
positions from one end to another. For example, wire 1 on one end of the 
cable would be wire 8 on the other end of the cable.
 
Figure 2-15: 
A rollover 
cable is

your system

or switch 
in order to

the device.
 
Accessing the Network with Access Methods
A big part of networking environments is not only the network layout (the 
topology) and the types of cables that are being used, but also how data is 
placed on the network. Data is placed on the network using what is known as 
an access method.

Book I
Chapter 2
Introduction 
to Network 
Technologies
35
Accessing the Network with Access Methods
This section discusses the different access methods that different network 
environments use. This topic will help you understand how communication 
occurs on the network.
CSMA/CD
The first — and probably most popular — access method to discuss is 
Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD). Here is how 
CSMA/CD works: When a system wants to send data on the network, it first 
senses the wire to see if there is already data on the wire (see Figure 2-16) — 
if there is already data on the wire, it waits until the wire is free, but if the 
wire is free of traffic, the system goes ahead and sends the data.
As mentioned, if the wire is already busy transmitting a signal, the system 
waits until the wire is free — once the wire is free, the system sends the 
data. If, at the time the data was sent, another system happened to send 
data at the same time, we would have what is called a collision. A collision is 
when two pieces of data traveling on the wire meet — they collide and the 
data is destroyed. If that data collides because another system sent data at 
the same time, then the systems involved in the collision will wait a variable 
length of time before resending the data. The variable length of time is 
determined by an algorithm that is built into CSMA/CD and ensures the two 
systems do not try to retransmit at the same time.
 
Figure 2-16: 
With CSMA/
CD, a 
system can 
send data

Token passing
Token passing is a different approach to how systems can send data on the 
network. With token passing, there is an empty packet (the token) that 
circulates through the network thousands of times a second. When a system 
wants to send data on the network, the system has to wait for the token to 
reach the system.
Once the token reaches the system, the system fills the token with data and 
flags the token as being in use. The token is then submitted back on the 
network (with data in it) and is headed to the destination system.
The benefit of token passing is that in order to send data you need to have 
the token — because there is only one token on the network, it is impossible 
to have collisions in a token-passing environment.
CSMA/CA
Another access method (though it has become less and less popular over 
the years) is Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA). 
When a system wants to send data on the wire, it first senses the wire to see 
if any data is already on it. If the wire is free, the system sends an announce-
ment on the wire letting everyone know it is about to send data in hopes that 
no other system will send data when they see the announcement. After the 
announcement is sent, then the system sends the real data. This is a method 
of trying to avoid collisions.
 
Wireless networks use CSMA/CA as their method of placing data on the 
network.
Understanding Network Architectures
If you have been reading this chapter from the beginning, you understand 
that the network topology is the layout of the network, that there are three 
major types of network cabling, and you know the different types of access 
methods. Now it is time to put it all together to create what is known as 
network architectures.
A network architecture is a standard that defines how the network works in 
terms of how data is placed on the wire, the types of cabling used, and the 
network topology being employed. The standards are defined by the Institute 
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
This section is designed to give you background on two of the major types 
of network architectures, Ethernet and Token Ring, and the details on what

makes each network architecture special. Note that I discuss some of the 
older architectures to make the discussion more complete, as well as some 
of the newer architectures that you will need to know for the exam.
Ethernet architectures
Ethernet architectures are very popular network architectures of the past 
and the present. There are a number of different Ethernet architectures, 
with the difference primarily being the cabling that is used with that network 
architecture. 
Before I get into the details of each of the network architectures, I want to 
give you a breakdown of the architecture name. When you look at Figure 2-17, 
you see an example of a network architecture divided into three parts.
 
Figure 2-17: 
Breaking 
down the 
name of 
network 
architectures.
 
Speed
Transmission type
Type of cable
100 Base T
The first part of the name indicates the speed of the network. In the example 
network architecture shown in Figure 2-17, the speed is 100 Mbps.
The second part of the architecture name specifies whether baseband or 
broadband communication is used. Baseband communication uses the entire 
bandwidth for the communication, while broadband uses a portion of the 
bandwidth for the communication. In my example, the network architecture 
is using baseband transmission.
The third part of the architecture name identifies the type of cable that is 
being used. In our example, the “T” indicates twisted-pair cabling and — 
because we know the speed of the architecture is 100 Mbps — we can 
deduce that the type of twisted-pair cabling is Cat 5. You will also notice 
some architectures use a “C” for coaxial cable and an “F” for fiber-optic 
cabling.
 
It is important to note that all Ethernet environments use CSMA/CD as the 
access method.
Let’s have a look at some of the Ethernet architectures.

38
Understanding Network Architectures
10Base2
The first Ethernet standard to mention is an older network architecture, 
but I want to mention it along with a few of the older ones to help practice 
picking apart the architecture name to identify its meaning. Remember that 
with a network architecture we need to choose a topology, cable, and access 
method.
Looking at the 10Base2 name, we can see that the architecture runs at 10 
Mbps and uses baseband transmission. The type of cable is indicated with 
the number 2, which is used in this case to remind you of a distance of 200 
meters. Do we know of any cables that are limited in length to approximately 
200 meters? The Thinnet coax cable uses 185 meters as a maximum distance.
10Base2 uses a bus topology and CSMA/CD as a method of placing data on 
the wire.
10Base5
Another example of an older Ethernet architecture is the 10Base5 architecture. 
10Base5 runs at 10 Mbps and also uses baseband transmission. The difference 
between 10Base5 and 10Base2 is the type of cabling used — 10Base5 uses 
Thicknet cabling, which has a maximum distance of 500 meters, while 
10Base2 uses Thinnet coaxial cable.
10Base5 also uses a bus topology and, like all other Ethernet architectures, 
uses CSMA/CD as the access method.
10BaseT
The 10BaseT architecture changes things up a little by using a different 
cable type and a different topology. 10BaseT uses Cat 3 UTP cabling, 
which runs at 10 Mbps, and uses a star topology. 10BaseT uses baseband 
transmission and CSMA/CD as the access method.
Fast Ethernet standards
The big jump in network speed after 10 Mbps was to the 100 Mbps networking 
standards, known as the Fast Ethernet standards — all of which run at 100 
Mbps, use CSMA/CD as the access method, use baseband transmission, and 
use a star topology. The difference between these Fast Ethernet standards is 
the type of cabling used.
The two popular forms of fast Ethernet are 100BaseTX and 100BaseFX. 
100BaseTX uses Cat 5 UTP cable, while 100BaseFX uses fiber-optic cabling.

Gigabit Ethernet standards
Today’s new networking devices are looking at transferring data at 1000 
Mbps (1 Gbps). Network architectures that transfer information at 1 Gbps 
are known to follow the Gigabit Ethernet standards and use a star topology, 
baseband transmission, and the access method of CSMA/CD.
IEEE has created a number of standards for Gigabit Ethernet, with each using 
a different type of cable to reach the transfer rate of 1 Gbps. The following 
are the Gigabit Ethernet standards: 
 
✦ 1000BaseCX: Uses coaxial cable to reach a maximum distance of 25 
meters (82 feet).
 
✦ 1000BaseLX: Uses single-mode fiber-optic cabling to reach a maximum 
distance of 3 kilometers (9,842 feet).
 
✦ 1000BaseSX: Uses multimode fiber-optic cabling to reach a maximum 
distance of 550 meters (1,804 feet).
 
✦ 1000BaseTX: This Gigabit Ethernet standard reaches 1000 Mbps but 
uses Cat 5e UTP cable instead of fiber-optic cabling. The difference 
between 100BaseT and 1000BaseTX is that 1000BaseTX uses all eight 
wires while 100BaseT only uses four.
10 Gigabit Ethernet standards
The next level of Ethernet standards is to reach transfer rates of 10 Gbps. 
The 10 Gigabit Ethernet standards use a star topology, baseband transmission, 
and an access method of CSMA/CD. Like the Gigabit Ethernet standards, 
there are different versions of the 10 Gigabit Ethernet standards.
The standards include 10GBaseLR, 10GBaseSR, and 10GBaseER, which 
all use fiber-optic cabling. The difference among them is 10GBaseSR uses 
multimode fiber-optic cable to reach short distances (100 meters), while 
10GBaseLR uses single-mode fiber-optic cabling to reach a longer range of 
10 kilometers. 10GBaseER can reach extra-long ranges (40 kilometers) using 
single-mode fiber-optic cabling.
 
A way to remember the difference between 10GBaseSR, 10GBaseLR, and 
10GBaseER is that the “S” stands for short range, the “L” stands for long 
range, and the “E” stands for extra long range.
There is also a 10 Gigabit Ethernet standard that uses Cat 6 UTP cabling; it’s 
known as 10GBaseTX. With this standard, the maximum cable distance is 
100 meters.

Token Ring
Over the years, there have been network architectures outside of Ethernet 
that have been developed and used, but they have not been as popular as 
Ethernet. One of the biggest competitors to Ethernet in the early years was 
Token Ring, which was developed by IBM. 
Token Ring uses a ring topology and token passing as the access method. 
Remember, with token passing a system needs to have the token to submit 
data on the wire.
Over the years, Token Ring has used many different cable types, from its 
own proprietary IBM cable types to using UTP cabling. Token Ring networks 
use a central device such as a switch to connect all the systems, but the 
device is called a multistation access unit (MAU) instead of a switch. (See 
Figure 2-18.) The reason for the name change is the device operates a little 
bit differently — it creates a ring internally.

Looking at the OSI Model
When manufacturers develop networking components, they must follow 
the conceptual model called the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. 
This model defines the rules for networking components to communicate 
with one another and was developed by the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO).
The OSI model is a seven-layer model, with each layer depicting a specific 
role in the concept of network communication. The seven layers of the OSI 
model are application, presentation, session, transport, network, data link, 
and, finally, the physical layer.
 
It is important to understand the function of each layer of the OSI model, 
so be sure to study this topic well. The CCENT certification exam will have 
questions that test your knowledge of the OSI model, so you need to be 
familiar with the different layers of it. Also note that as I progress through 
the chapters of this minibook, I reference this model as much as possible.

42
Looking at the OSI Model
When learning the OSI model, it is best to visualize that the OSI is present 
on both the sending and receiving system (as shown in Figure 2-19). In this 
example, you can visualize someone surfing a Web site as I discuss the 
layers of the OSI model.

✦ Layer 7 – Application: The application layer of the OSI model is 
responsible for sending the network request on the sending computer, 
but servicing the request on the receiving system. For example, when 
the network user is surfing a Web site, the Web browser uses HTTP to 
send a request to the Web server. The Web server then services the 
request by sending the desired Web page back to the client.
 
✦ Layer 6 – Presentation: The presentation layer is responsible for 
formatting the information so that it is understood at the other end 
of the communication. Examples of presentation layer functions are 
character coding, such as ASCII and Unicode (these are character 
code standards that define what characters can be used by a system), 
but depending on the example, you could also have compression and 
encryption at this layer as well.
 
 In my Web surfing example, the client may choose to compress the 
information before sending the request to the Web server. At the 
presentation layer on the Web server, the system would then have to 
decompress the information before passing it up to the Web site 
(application).
 
✦ Layer 5 – Session: The session layer is responsible for establishing the 
communication dialog between the two systems and maintaining that 
dialog.
 
✦ Layer 4 – Transport: The transport layer is responsible for reliable and 
unreliable delivery. Reliable delivery means that if information is sent, 
the transport layer will ensure the data reaches the destination and, 
if the data does not reach the destination, the information is re-sent. 
Unreliable delivery means that the information is sent but no effort is

Looking at the OSI Model
made to ensure the data reaches the destination. The transport layer is 
also responsible for breaking the data into smaller, more manageable 
chunks, called segments. Each segment is then sent to the destination 
and will need to be reassembled at the transport layer on the receiving 
system.
 
✦ Layer 3 – Network: The network layer is responsible for logical 
addressing and routing functions. A logical address is an address that 
you can assign to the system such as an IP address. Routing is the 
concept of delivering the data to the destination — which is one of the 
main roles of the network layer. I talk a lot more about logical addressing 
in Book I, Chapter 4.
 
 In my Web surfing example, after the transport layer on the sending 
system breaks the data into smaller segments they are then passed 
down to the network layer so the network layer can add a source and 
destination IP address to each segment. The source and destination IP 
address are applied so that it is known where the segment came from 
and where it is headed. It is also important to note that once the segment 
reaches the network layer the segment is now known as a packet.
 
✦ Layer 2 – Data link: The data link layer is responsible for physical 
addressing as opposed to logical addressing. The physical address is 
burned into the network card of the system or device by the manufacturer 
and is used to address where the information is headed and where it is 
coming from. The data link layer is responsible for converting the packet 
to a pattern of bits that will be placed on the wire in the form of an 
electrical signal. On the receiving end, the opposite occurs — the 
electrical signals are received and converted to a packet and passed up 
to the network layer. Note that the data link layer is where your access 
methods such as CSMA/CD run.
 
 When the packet is passed down to the data link layer and the MAC 
address is added to the packet, the packet then becomes known as a 
frame. The MAC address is the physical address burned into the network 
card that is a unique identifier for the network card.
 
✦ Layer 1 – Physical: The physical layer of the OSI model is responsible 
for working with the electrical signal — as a result, anything that works 
with the electrical signal runs at this layer. Examples of components that 
run at this layer are cables and connectors used to connect the systems 
together and carry the electrical signal.
 
You will notice that network professionals sometimes use the term packet, 
and other times they use the term frame. When the data is at layer 4 (the 
transport layer), it is called a segment. After the logical addressing has been 
assigned to each segment at layer 3 (the network layer), it is then known as 
a packet. After the physical addresses are added to the packet at layer 2 (the 
data link layer), it is then known as a frame.

Chapter Summary
Chapter Summary
This chapter discusses some key networking terminology that you need to 
be familiar with for the CCENT certification exam. The following are some 
key points to remember when thinking about networking basics:
 
✦ Network topology refers to the layout of the network. There are three 
major topologies — bus, star, and ring.
 
✦ There are three major cable types — coaxial, twisted-pair, and fiber-optic 
cabling.
 
✦ To support Gigabit Ethernet networking, you use UTP Cat 5e and Cat 6 
cabling or fiber-optic cabling.
 
✦ Crossover cables are used to connect two similar devices, such as 
connecting two systems directly together or two switches directly 
together.
 
✦ A straight-through cable is used to connect dissimilar devices, such as a 
computer to a switch or a router to a switch.
 
✦ An access method is how information is placed on the wire. All Ethernet 
environments use CSMA/CD as their access method.
 
✦ A network architecture is a network standard that uses a specific topology, 
cable type, and access method.
 
✦ The OSI model is a seven-layer model with each layer having a specific 
network function.
 
✦ From a network-professional point of view, you need to be familiar with 
layers 4, 3, 2, and 1 of the OSI model.

Building Networks with Network Devices
When working with networks — and especially when troubleshooting 
communication problems — it is important to be familiar with the role of 
the different network devices that exist on a network. This section describes 
the purpose of different network devices.
Hubs and repeaters
The first network device to take a look at is the network hub. Hubs are used 
as central devices to connect all the hosts on the network to one another. A 
host is a workstation, server, printer, or any other object that plugs into the 
network. The term I use often in this book for something that connects to 
the network is a system — which could be a workstation or server. Figure 3-1 
shows a 5-port hub that is used to connect five systems to a network.
 
Figure 3-1: 
A five-port 
hub used 
to connect 
five systems 
together.
 
How hubs work
The important thing to note about a hub is that it is a layer-1 device, and not 
a very intelligent device. It simply acts as a connection point for all the systems. 
Also note that if a system wants to send data to another system, the data 
leaves the first system and reaches the hub, and then the hub sends the 
data to all other ports on the hub even though the data is destined for only 
one other system. All systems receive the data; systems that are not the 
intended recipients discard the data, while the intended recipient receives 
and processes the data.
The reason I stress how a hub works is that this leads to performance and 
security issues. The performance problem is the fact that bandwidth is 
being used — data is sent to all ports on the hub — when it doesn’t really 
need to be. The security issue is that all systems receive a copy of the data 
even though they are not the intended recipient. If any of these systems has 

Book I
Chapter 3

and Services
55
Building Networks with Network Devices
a network sniffer running (such as Wireshark; www.wireshark.org), it can 
capture and read all data on the network! Both of these issues go away when 
you use a switch instead of a hub (more on that in a bit).
Repeaters
The other device to make a note about at this point is the repeater. In Book I, 
Chapter 2, you find out that each cable type has a maximum distance 
associated with it — if the signal travels farther than that distance, the data 
is unreadable. The unreadable data is due to signal degradation over distance 
and interference from other sources.
If you want (or need) to exceed the maximum length of a cable, you need to 
use a repeater (see Figure 3-2) to connect the cable lengths together. The 
repeater not only acts as a connection point for the two cables, but it is also 
responsible for regenerating the signal so that it can travel from one cable to 
the other — and thus travel a greater distance.

Remember that hubs and repeaters are examples of layer-1 devices. An easy 
way to remember this is layer-1 components work with the electrical signal. 
Because a hub simply passes the electrical signal on to all other ports, it is 
considered a layer-1 device. Because a repeater amplifies the signal, it, too, 
is considered a layer-1 device.
Network interface card
The network interface card (NIC) is present in your system and allows you to 
connect to the network cable. Some systems have network cards built into 
the motherboard of the system, while others have the network card installed 
in the system as its own component.

56
Building Networks with Network Devices
Physical address
The network card has its own address assigned to it, and this address is 
burned into the ROM chip of the card. This address is known as the physical 
address, as it is burned into the network card (also known as an interface) 
and cannot be changed unless a special program is used. Another popular 
term for the physical address is the Media Access Control (MAC) address.
The MAC address is a 48-bit address that uses hexadecimal values. An exam-
ple of a MAC address is 00-01-80-35-00-7B. As shown in Figure 3-3, the 
MAC address is divided into two parts — the first part is the manufacturer 
ID, and the second part is the unique ID that identifies that card made by the 
manufacturer.
 
Figure 3-3: 
A MAC 
address 
is divided 
into two 
parts — the 
manufacturer 
ID and the 
unique 
card ID.
 
Each manufacturer of network cards is assigned a number of manufacturer 
IDs that the manufacturer can use as the first half of all MAC addresses for 
network cards it builds. This helps ensure that MAC addresses are unique.
How MAC addresses are used
From a networking point of view, it is important to understand how the MAC 
addresses are used. The data you send on the network is called a frame, and 
the frame has three parts to it — the header, the data portion, and the trailer 
portion of the frame, as shown in Figure 3-4.

The three 
parts of a 
frame.

Chapter 3

Building Networks with Network Devices
The header contains information about the frame itself, such as where the 
frame is coming from (the source) and where it is headed (the destination). 
These are known as the source and destination addresses and are the MAC 
addresses of the sender and the intended recipient of the frame.
In the classroom, I have a lot of students ask why the source address is in 
the header — they understand that the destination address is in the header 
because it is needed for the data to reach the correct system, but they don’t 
understand why the source address is included. The answer is simple; the 
source address is included so that whatever system receives the data knows 
who to send a reply to.
The data portion of the frame contains the information that is actually being 
sent, and the trailer contains checksum information that is used to verify that 
the frame has not been altered in transit.
Bridges
Back when hubs were the popular devices on networks, we would eventually 
encounter performance issues because one hub was usually connected to 
another hub to allow for more systems to connect to the network. Figure 
3-5 shows why this is such a big issue. The hub acts as one big cable — data 
that reaches the hub is sent to every port on the hub. This means all data is 
seen by all systems on the network when using a hub.
 
Figure 3-5: 
When you 
use a hub, 
all data is 
seen by all 
systems on 
the network.

The problem with connecting one hub to another (and then to another) 
as you have more users that need to connect to the network is this: When 
WorkstationA sends data to WorkstationB, the data reaches the hub that 
WorkstationA is connected to, and then that hub sends the data to all of its 
ports. This causes the data to go to the second hub that then sends the data 
to all of its ports. The traffic continues on like this for as many hubs that you 
have.

58
Building Networks with Network Devices
 
When 10Base2 and 10Base5 networks were popular — and when hubs are 
used on a network — you must follow the 5-4-3 rule. This rule states that you 
are only allowed to have 5 networks segments, joined by 4 repeaters or 
hubs, and only 3 of those segments can be populated with systems. The 
reason for the rule is to limit the size of the network so that data can reach 
the end of the network in a reasonable amount of time. 
This is a problem because Ethernet environments use CSMA/CD (meaning 
that all systems are waiting for the line to be free before they can send data), 
which is slowing the network down. Remember, if someone sends data while 
traffic is traveling through this network, the data will collide and need to be 
retransmitted.
Also, this type of setup means that you have more systems “sensing” 
the wire, waiting for the wire to be free so they can send their data. 
Unfortunately, so is everyone else! In this situation, when the network is free 
of traffic you have multiple systems trying to send data at the same time, 
which means the data will collide and need to be retransmitted. Bottom line: 
A lot of data is being sent that is not reaching anyone.
The bridge offers a solution to the performance issue by breaking the network 
down into multiple network segments. The bridge has a MAC address table 
that keeps track of each system’s MAC address and the network segment 
a system is on. When a frame reaches the bridge, the bridge looks at the 
destination address in the frame and then locates that address in the MAC 
address table. Once the address is found in the MAC address table, the 
bridge sends the data only to the network segment that the destination 
system resides on (see Figure 3-6), thus conserving bandwidth on the other 
network segments. In Figure 3-6, for example, when WorkstationA sends 
information to WorkstationC the bridge forwards the information only to 
segment 3, after finding out (from the MAC address table ) that WorkstationC 
exists on segment 3.
 
Using a bridge is different from using a bunch of hubs, as a hub will always 
send the data to all other ports on the hub — essentially sending the data 
across the entire network. Bridges are used to filter this traffic so the data 
will not travel across the entire network.
Switches
If you understand the concept of a bridge, then you will have no problem 
understanding what a switch does. Why is that? Because a switch does the 
exact same thing as a bridge — the only difference is that each port on the 
switch (see Figure 3-7) acts as its own network segment. As a result, if you 
plug a workstation into each port on the switch, each workstation is on its 
own network segment.

Let’s look at an example of how a switch works. Figure 3-8 displays a typical 
network setup with a switch having multiple systems connected. Like a 
bridge, the switch has a MAC address table that records each system’s 
MAC address and what port on the switch that system can be found at. 
When WorkstationA sends data to WorkstationC, the data travels from 
WorkstationA to the switch. The switch then looks at the destination MAC 
address that is stored in the header of the frame to find out where the frame 
is headed. Once the switch knows the destination MAC address, it then 
locates that MAC address in the MAC address table and sends the frame 
to the associated port on the switch (in this case, port 7). The destination 
system then receives the frame.

There is a lot more to say about network switches, as they are a big part of 
your CCENT exam, but I will save the in-depth discussions for the switching 
chapters in Book III.

Remember, because bridges and switches work with physical addresses (the 
MAC address), they are considered layer-2 devices, as that is the layer that 
handles physical addressing.
Routers
The router is responsible for sending data from one network to another 
router on a different network. (See Figure 3-9.) The router does this by storing a 
routing table in memory, and the routing table has a listing of what networks 
exist and what router to send the data to in order to reach that network.
Once a router receives a packet from another router, it looks at the destination 
address in the packet and then sends the packet to the system on its network 
that the packet is destined for.
 
You will need to know a lot more about routers and switches in order to 
prepare you for the CCENT certification exam. The purpose of the discussion 
of routers and switches in this chapter is to give a brief description of the 
different devices — there is more detail to come on routers and switches as 
you progress through the book!

Remember, routers are layer-3 devices and, as a result, work with layer-3 
addresses (IP addresses) and not the physical address. A physical address is 
a layer-2 address, and only layer-2 devices (such as a switch or bridge) work 
with layer-2 addresses.

Identifying Network Services
While it is very important for the CCENT certification exam that you know 
the different devices that can exist on the network, you also need to be 
familiar with the different network services that are available on the network. 
This section outlines popular network services you need to be familiar with 
for the exam — be sure to study these!
Web servers
The first service to be familiar with is a Web server. A Web server is responsible 
for hosting Web pages and delivering those Web pages to a Web client, 
also known as a Web browser. A Web server can be used to host a company 
intranet site or even a company’s public Web site.
The Web site’s pages are designed in a language called Hypertext Markup 
Language (HTML), while the actual protocol that is responsible for delivering 
the page from the server to the client is Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

62
Identifying Network Services
E-mail servers
An e-mail server is responsible for sending and receiving e-mail on a network. 
Two different protocols are used by e-mail servers — one protocol for sending 
e-mail and one protocol for receiving e-mail.
The Internet protocol for sending an e-mail is Simple Mail Transfer Protocol 
(SMTP), which is used by the e-mail client to send the e-mail to their server, 
which then uses SMTP to send the e-mail to the recipient’s e-mail server.
Once the e-mail has been delivered to the recipient’s mail server, the 
client uses an Internet protocol to read the e-mail off the server. Post Office 
Protocol version 3 (POP3) is an example of an Internet protocol for reading 
e-mail and so is Internet Message Access Protocol version 4 (IMAP4).
DNS servers
A very critical service to networking and networking applications is that 
provided by the domain name system (DNS) servers. DNS is responsible 
for converting the friendly names such as www.gleneclarke.com to IP 
addresses. (IP addresses are discussed in the next chapter.) The friendly 
names are called fully qualified domain names, or FQDN for short. 
A DNS server has a database of FQDNs and their corresponding IP addresses 
so that clients on the network can query the DNS server to find out the IP 
address of the system (workstation or server) they are trying to contact. The 
hook with DNS is that it is impossible for one DNS server to hold all of the 
friendly names and IP addresses for all the systems in the world. Because of 
this, a protocol was originally created in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris, where 
each company hosts its own DNS server. If a DNS server does not know the 
IP address of a FQDN, it forwards the request out to DNS servers on the 
Internet. Figure 3-10 displays how this works.
Looking at Figure 3-10, you see that the first step your system uses to find 
out the IP address of a Web site is to send a query to the DNS server in your 
office — essentially your system is saying, “Do you have the IP address for 
www.wiley.com?” Your DNS server will most likely not have the answer, 
as no one has programmed the address into the server. (Remember, each 
company is responsible for its own addresses in the database.) So your DNS 
sends the query out to the DNS root servers that start the hierarchy of the 
DNS system.

The root server receives the request and looks in its database for an entry 
called www.wiley.com. It will not have an entry for www.wiley.com, so it 
looks at the last part in the name and says, “I don’t know who www.wiley.
com is, but why don’t you check with the .com DNS server — he may know 
who www.wiley.com is?”
Your system then sends the query to the .com name server, which then 
sends you down to the next level by saying, “No, I don’t know who www.
wiley.com is, but why don’t you check with the wiley.com DNS server?”
Finally, your DNS server queries the wiley.com DNS server and says, “Do 
you have an IP address for www.wiley.com?” The wiley.com DNS server 
does have an entry for www, so it sends back the answer of 24.138.10.20 
to your company DNS server. Your company DNS server then sends that 
answer (the IP address) to the system that sent the query.

64
Identifying Network Services
 
Be sure to know the roles of mail servers, Web servers, and DNS servers for 
the CCENT certification exam. Also, remember that DNS is responsible for 
converting the friendly name (FQDN) to an IP address.
Authentication servers
Most networking environments limit who is allowed to access the network 
by making people authenticate to the network. Authentication is the process 
of identifying yourself, typically with a username and password, and then 
having that verified against a database of usernames and passwords that are 
allowed to access the network. If you present a valid username and password, 
you will be authenticated and given access to the network.
There are many different examples of authentication servers out there. 
Microsoft has an authentication server, known as a domain controller, that 
runs the Active Directory database. Novell has an authentication database 
known as eDirectory, and there is also an industry standard authentication 
service known as Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS), which 
is a central authentication service that can be used by a number of technologies, 
such as wireless authentication and remote access.
DHCP servers
Another important service on the network (and one you can be sure you 
will be tested on in the CCENT exam) is that provided by a Dynamic Host 
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. A DHCP server is responsible for 
assigning IP addresses to systems on the network when those systems start 
up. There are four phases to a system obtaining an IP address from a DHCP 
server. (See Figure 3-11.)
 
✦ DHCP discover: When a client boots up, it sends out a broadcast 
message to all systems on the network that says, “If there are any DHCP 
servers out there, I need an IP address.” A broadcast message is a frame 
that is destined for all systems and has a destination MAC address of 
FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF. All systems on the local LAN segment process 
this message.
 
✦ DHCP offer: Any systems receiving the DHCP discover message that are 
not DHCP servers discard the message, but the DHCP servers send out a 
message to the system offering an IP address for that system to use. The 
address is actually leased to the system and, like all leases, expires.
 
✦ DHCP request: Because it is possible that multiple DHCP servers will 
answer a broadcast message with IP address offers, the client sends 
a request for the first offer that is received. All other offers are then 
retracted.

Chapter 3

and Services

✦ DHCP acknowledge: The DHCP server that has the IP address offer 
requested then sends a final acknowledgement that states the client has 
the address leased for a certain period of time.

service that

Note that many products can serve as DHCP servers on your network. A 
Windows server or Linux server can act as a DHCP server, or you can config-
ure your Cisco router to be a DHCP server as well. (See Book II, Chapter 4.) 
Another point worth noting is that a system that receives an IP address from 
a DHCP server is known as a DHCP client.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, remember that DHCP is responsible for 
automatically assigning IP addresses to systems when they first boot up. If 
there is no DHCP service, you have to manually configure each system with 
TCP/IP settings. You find out more about TCP/IP and IP addresses in Book I, 
Chapter 4.
Network Address Translation
The last service that I want to discuss in this chapter is Network Address 
Translation, or NAT. NAT is a service on the network that is responsible for 
converting the source IP address that is in the header of an outbound packet 
to the public IP address used by the NAT device. That is a lot to consume, so 
let’s look at an example!
Looking at Figure 3-12, you see that our router has been configured as a NAT 
device. You also notice that there are two network cards, known as interfaces, 
on the router. One of the interfaces is an Ethernet card (or interface) known 
as E0. The other interface is a serial interface that is normally connected to 
your Internet connection (if you are not using a different interface for that). 
The serial interface in this diagram is known as S0.

The two other things I want you to notice in Figure 3-12 are that the serial 
interface has the IP address of 24.138.100.1, and it is the interface 
connected to the Internet. Any interface connected to the Internet is known 
as the public interface, while in this example the Ethernet interface is known 
as private interface, as it is connected to the private LAN.
Now I will talk about how NAT works. When WorkstationA surfs the Internet, 
the packet is sent from WorkstationA to the NAT device (in this case, the 
NAT–enabled router). In step 2, the NAT device strips out the source IP 
address of WorkstationA from the header of the packet and places the public 
IP address of the NAT device in its place. The NAT device then records 
an entry in a translation table so that the NAT device knows when a reply 
comes back to convert the address back to the address of WorkstationA. 
Then in step 3, the packet is sent out to the Internet.
The benefit of NAT is that it is a method of sharing one IP address and 
having a number of systems surf the Internet using that one IP address 
(which equates to a cost benefit because you would normally need to purchase 
an IP address for each system to access the Internet). The other benefit is 
security — if anyone on the Internet captures the packet and looks at where 
it came from, they will notice the IP address of the NAT device. If they decide 
to attack that address, they will be attacking the NAT device and not your 
systems inside the network. You definitely want to use a firewall as well — 
and most firewalls are NAT devices. I know that some of you have those 
home routers at home — do not worry because they are NAT devices and 
firewalls all packaged in one!

Traffic Management Concepts
 
For the CCENT certification exam, you need to know that NAT translates a 
private address to a public address. You also need to know that NAT 
essentially hides your internal systems from the Internet. You read more 
about NAT in Book II, Chapter 4.
Traffic Management Concepts
Now that you understand some of the different services and networking 
devices that make up the network, I want to discuss some other networking 
concepts you need to be familiar with for the exam. This section discusses 
network concepts that deal with managing network traffic. In this section, 
you find out about duplexing, types of communication, and the very 
important concepts of collision domains and broadcast domains.
To duplex or not to duplex
Most networking devices today (such as network cards and switches) 
support the concept of duplexing. Duplexing is having the capability for a 
signal to flow between two points in both directions. There are different 
forms of duplexing terms you need to be familiar with, and I outline them in 
the following list:
 
✦ Simplex: A device that supports simplex communication can communicate 
in only one direction. It can either send or receive, but it does not support 
both.
 
✦ Half-duplex: A device that supports half-duplex communication can 
both send and receive, but not at the same time. This is similar to how 
walkie-talkies work — you cannot talk and listen at the same time.
 
✦ Full-duplex: A device that supports full-duplex communication can send 
and receive information at the same time! This means that as a full-duplex 
device is receiving data, it can send information to another device. 
When hubs were used on Ethernet networks (you might still have some 
floating around the office), understand that those are half-duplex devices, 
but a switch is an example of a full-duplex device. The interfaces (also 
known as ports) on the older switches defaulted to half-duplex, and it was up 
to the administrator to configure the ports for full-duplex. The interfaces on 
the newer switches default to full-duplex. You read more about configuring 
duplexing on switches in Book III, Chapter 4.
Types of communication
There are three major types of network communication that you need to be 
familiar with for the CCENT certification exam — unicast, broadcast, and 
multicast. The following outlines the differences in the three types:

68
Traffic Management Concepts
 
✦ Unicast: One-on-one communication between two systems. Unicast 
communication has a specific host set as the destination address, and 
only that host will receive that information. The layer-2 destination 
address for unicast communication is set to the MAC address of the 
destination system, while the layer-3 destination address in the packet is 
set to the IP address of the destination system.
 
✦ Broadcast: A communication that is sent to all systems on the network. 
The layer-2 destination address for broadcast traffic is FF-FF-FF-FF-
FF-FF, while the layer-3 representation of a broadcast address is all 
bits set to 1, which gives you the broadcast address of 255.255.255.255. 
The broadcast address of 255.255.255.255 is known as an internetwork 
broadcast address (refers to all networks), while each subnet also has 
a broadcast with all host bits set to 1 (known as a subnet broadcast 
address). For example, 12.255.255.255 would be the layer-3 subnet 
broadcast address of the 12.0.0.0 network.
 
✦ Multicast: A communication that is not sent to all systems, but is sent to 
a group of systems. This allows an application to send data to a 
multicast address, and anyone who has subscribed, so to speak, to the 
address (typically through an application) will be part of that grouping 
and thus receive the information.
 
 Also note that there are some predefined multicast addresses. For example, 
224.0.0.2 is an address that means all routers on the network, 
whereas 224.0.0.5 is a multicast address for all routers running a 
popular routing protocol known as OSPF (which I discuss in more detail 
in Book III, Chapter 2). 
Broadcast domains versus collision domains
A very important concept to be familiar with for the CCENT certification 
exam is the concept of broadcast domains and collision domains. Let’s take 
a look at each of these.
Broadcast domain
A broadcast domain is a group of systems that receive each other’s broadcast 
messages. Looking at Figure 3-13, you see three systems connected to a hub. 
When ComputerA sends a broadcast message to everyone, the message 
reaches the hub, which forwards the message to all systems connected to 
the hub. Each system receives the broadcast message — therefore, all of 
these systems are part of the same broadcast domain.
Looking at Figure 3-13, if you were using a switch to connect all the systems 
together, you would still have one broadcast domain, as the switch would 
forward the broadcast message to all ports on the switch.

Book I
Chapter 3
Network Devices 
and Services
69
Traffic Management Concepts
Regarding traffic management, as the network administrator you need to be 
aware of broadcast domains because, at some point, you will say to your-
self, “I do not want ComputerC to receive any broadcast messages from 
ComputerA or ComputerB.” In this case, you need to ensure that ComputerC 
is placed in its own broadcast domain by using a router. Broadcast 
messages do not cross routers, so as a result, you create multiple broadcast 
domains when using a router. (See Figure 3-14.)

Traffic Management Concepts
Note that the grouping in Figure 3-14 uses a hub as a central device to 
connect all systems, but the resulting number of broadcast domains would 
be the same if switches were used instead of hubs — broadcast domains are 
created by adding routers to the network.
 
You can actually create multiple broadcast domains on a switch using the 
VLANs feature, but I save that information for the VLAN discussion in 
Book III, Chapter 4.
Collision domain
A collision domain is different from a broadcast domain, as a collision 
domain is a group of systems in which data can collide (which is not a good 
thing). Let’s look back to Figure 3-13 to find out about collision domains.
Since a hub sends any data it receives to all other ports on the hub, it is 
possible for the data to collide with any other data sent at the same time. 
This means that all of the systems in Figure 3-13 exist in a single collision 
domain.
With a switch, each port acts as its own dedicated network segment, which 
means that when ComputerA sends data to ComputerC, the information travels 
up the cable from ComputerA to the switch. Because no other systems are 
connected to that cable, there is no possibility for collisions. This means 
that each port on the switch creates a separate collision domain.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, remember that a network using a hub 
creates one collision domain and one broadcast domain, while a switch 
creates a collision domain per port on the switch, and one broadcast 
domain. The only way an additional broadcast domain is created is with a 
router or VLAN.
Managing traffic
It is important to understand the different network devices presented in 
this chapter, as they will help you manage network traffic. For example, you 
want to ensure that you are using switches instead of hubs, as the switch 
filters traffic by sending the data to only the port that the destination system 
resides on. A hub wastes bandwidth, as it sends the data to all ports, even 
though the destination systems do not reside on those ports.
You should also be familiar with how to create broadcast domains on the 
network. A number of applications send broadcast traffic on the network, 
and you may want to limit how far a broadcast message can travel on your

There are a number of other steps you can take to manage traffic. For example, 
you can take advantage of quality of service (QoS) functions on your network 
devices. QoS allows you to place priority on traffic from different applications 
to ensure that each application has adequate bandwidth available. This is 
a popular solution for Voice over IP (VoIP) — a technology that encapsulates 
your telephone traffic over a TCP/IP network.
Chapter Summary
This chapter illustrates the importance of networking devices and services. 
The following are some key points to remember for the CCENT exam:
 
✦ Hubs and repeaters are layer-1 devices that work with the electrical 
signal.
 
✦ A hub passes the electrical signal to all ports on the hub.
 
✦ A repeater regenerates a signal so the signal can travel farther.
 
✦ Bridges and switches are layer-2 devices that filter traffic based off the 
destination MAC address.
 
✦ A switch filters traffic by sending the data to only the port that the 
destination address of the frame resides on.
 
✦ Routers are layer-3 devices that send data from one network to another 
network.
 
✦ SMTP is the Internet protocol for sending e-mail, while POP3 is the 
Internet protocol for receiving e-mail.
 
✦ DNS is a network service that is responsible for converting Internet-style 
names, known as FQDNs, to IP addresses.
 
✦ NAT is responsible for translating the source address of a packet to use 
the public address of the NAT device. NAT devices allow all users on the 
network to connect to the Internet using the same IP address.
 
✦ DHCP is a service that is responsible for assigning IP addresses to 
systems on the network.

The Basics of TCP/IP
A protocol is a language used by computers or applications to communicate, 
and the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is the hot 
protocol on the market these days because it is the protocol of the Internet 
and Internet-based technologies. TCP/IP has become the protocol of choice 
for Windows, Linux, and Novell networks, and for devices from vendors 
such as Cisco, because of its ability to communicate in heterogeneous 
environments. Heterogeneous is the term we use for an environment that is 
made up of different systems. The bottom line is this: It doesn’t matter what 
kind of OS you are running — if you’re running TCP/IP, you can communicate 
globally.
TCP/IP is a protocol suite. Protocol suites are like application suites in the 
sense that there is more than one protocol in the group. For example, if 
you purchase the Microsoft Office suite, you purchase an entire group of 
applications, or an entire suite of applications. TCP/IP is a group of protocols 
that make up the protocol suite, and some of these protocols are used day 
in and day out. For example, the TCP/IP protocol suite has protocols to 
remotely connect and manage a system or device, and it has a protocol for 
downloading files from another computer.
This section is designed to give you the basics of TCP/IP version 4 (IPv4), 
including information on the required settings for TCP/IP to work. The 
CCENT exam requires you to have sound knowledge of IPv4, while the CCNA 
exam tests you on IPv6.
IP addressing
Every system and device (a printer, router, or switch) running the TCP/IP 
protocol has two basic configuration settings that need to be configured — 
three if you intend to communicate off the network.
The two required settings are the IP address and the subnet mask; these are 
required values for TCP/IP to work on a system. The third, optional, setting — 
which is required only if you wish to communicate off the network — is the 
default gateway setting. Let’s look at each of these settings!
IP address
The IP address is a unique address assigned to a workstation, server, or 
device. This unique address is used to identify the system or device on the 
network or even within the world!
The IP address is a 32-bit value that is typically represented in the decimal 
format. The decimal format is displayed similar to 145.25.10.100. Notice 
that the decimal format is represented with four sets of numbers, and each 
set is separated with a period (.) — this is actually known as the dotted 

Book I
Chapter 4
Introduction 
to TCP/IP
81
The Basics of TCP/IP
decimal notation. The reason for the dotted decimal notation is it is easier to 
remember an address of 145.25.10.100 than it is to remember thirty two 1s 
and 0s (such as 10010001 00011001 00001010 01100100) to identify the system.
Each set of numbers in the IP address is known as an octet because each 
number is made up of 8 bits — the term oct meaning eight. Because there are 
four octets, each containing 8 bits, we have a 32-bit address.
The next important point to make about the IP address is that it is logically 
divided into two parts. The first part is known as the network ID, and the 
second part is known as the host ID. (See Figure 4-1.)
 
Figure 4-1: 
The IP 
address is 
divided into 
two parts — 
the network 
ID and the 
host ID.
 
Network ID
Host ID
145.25.10.100
The network ID portion of the IP address is the same for your entire network 
and unique in the world. All hosts (computers, servers, or devices) on 
the same network will have the same network ID assigned and then have 
unique numbers assigned to the host ID portion of the IP address to make 
the IP address unique as a whole. For example, if we look at the address 
145.25.10.100 in Figure 4-1, the network ID portion is 145.25.x.y. This 
means that every system on this network must start with 145.25.x.y and 
then have any valid numbers in the x and y portion of the address. The x and 
y portion in this example is the host ID portion, and the network administrator 
for the network will decide what the host ID portion is (or have the DHCP 
server give the host IDs out automatically).
 
The relevance of the network ID is that (unless you are using NAT) every 
network has a unique network ID, and your IP address identifies the network 
you are on. Plus, it is a unique identifier for your system on that network. 
The routers use the network ID of the destination address in a packet to 
decide where to send the information.
I know what you are asking yourself right now: “Is it always the first two 
octets that make up the network ID?” The answer is no; sometimes it is the 
first octet, and other times it is the first two octets or even the first three 
octets. Well, how do you know what portion of an IP address is the network 
ID and what portion is the host ID? The answer is simple — the subnet mask 
tells you this!

82
The Basics of TCP/IP
Subnet mask
The subnet mask is an IP setting on the system used to identify the network 
ID portion of an IP address. For right now, let’s keep things simple and just 
discuss the default way that TCP/IP works. If the subnet mask has a 255 in 
an octet, the corresponding octet in the IP address is part of the network 
ID. If there is a 0 in an octet within the subnet mask, then the corresponding 
octet in the IP address is part of the host ID portion. For example, see the 
bold text in the table that follows:
Octet 1
Octet 2
Octet 3
Octet 4
IP Address

25
10
100
Subnet Mask

Host ID
Looking at the example, you see that the system has an IP address of 
145.25.10.100 and a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0. The subnet mask tells 
you that the first two octets are the network ID (because they have a 255), 
and the last two octets are the host ID portion (because they have a 0).
 
In Book I, Chapter 5, you find out how the subnet mask can be customized 
by subnetting the network. This chapter focuses on the basics of TCP/IP 
before customizing the addresses.
The next big point to make is the relevance of identifying the network ID 
portion of the IP address. When a system tries to communicate with another 
system, the first thing TCP/IP does (actually the IP protocol, but more on 
that later) is determine if the system you are trying to communicate with 
exists on the same network. If it does, your computer can send the data 
directly to that system. If the system you are trying to communicate with 
exists on a different network, your system will pass the information to the 
router so that the router can send the data off the network to the destination.
Figure 4-2 displays an example of how the subnet mask is used to determine if 
a system is on the same network as your own system. For Figure 4-2, assume 
that WorkstationA has the IP address of 12.0.0.10 with a subnet mask of 
255.0.0.0.
When WorkstationA tries to communicate with WorkstationC by its IP 
address, WorkstationA first compares his own IP against his subnet mask to 
find out what his network ID is. In this example, WorkstationA identifies the 
first octet as being his network ID. He then compares the first octet against 
the first octet of the system he is trying to communicate with to see if the 
system is on the same network or not. The logic here is if the systems are on 
the same network, they will have the same network ID. WorkstationA sees 
that the network IDs are different, so he knows that the systems are not on 
the same network.

Once WorkstationA determines that the system he is trying to communicate 
with is on a different network, he knows to send the information to the 
router so the router can route the data off the network and to its destination. 
The next logical question is this: “How does a system know what router to 
send the information to?” The answer is simple — the default gateway setting!
Default gateway
The default gateway setting of a device points to the IP address of the router 
that the system or device is to use in order to send information off the 
network. In my example from Figure 4-2, WorkstationA and WorkstationB 
need to be configured with a default gateway of 12.0.0.1 as that is the IP 
address of the device they must send data to in order to send data off the 
network. In this case, when you configure the IP address on those systems 
you will also configure 12.0.0.1 as the default gateway of those systems with 
the default gateway setting in the TCP/IP configuration.
WorkstationC and WorkstationD need to be configured to use the default 
gateway of 14.0.0.1, as that is the router connected to their network. 
Notice that the default gateway address is an address on the system’s 
network — it would be hard to send the data to the router if the router 
wasn’t on your network because you would have to route to get to the 
router. That doesn’t make much sense.
Converting decimal to binary
Before we continue into the remaining topics of this chapter and the 
subnetting discussion in the next chapter, it is important to know how to 
convert binary values to decimal and decimal values to binary as the rest of 
this chapter and the next chapter depends on that knowledge. Let’s take a 
look at how an octet gets its decimal value from the eight bits that are in the 
octet.

84
The Basics of TCP/IP
In the “IP address” section earlier in this chapter, you found out that there 
are eight bits in an octet. Each of these bits have a decimal value associated 
with them, as shown in Figure 4-3. Starting on the right side of Figure 4-3, the 
eighth bit has a value of one (1), which then doubles for the next bit moving 
to the left. The value of each bit is double the value of the previous bit when 
moving from right to left. As you can see, the first bit on the left side has a 
decimal value of 128. Because the first bit (on the left) has the highest value 
associated with it, it is considered the most significant bit (MSB); because the 
eighth bit has the lowest value, it is considered the least significant bit (LSB).

You can calculate the eight bits when you know the decimal value by enabling 
the bits (setting the bit to a 1) that mathematically add up to the decimal 
value of the octet. Let’s look at the example IP address of 145.25.10.100 
and focus on the first octet, which has a decimal value of 145. To convert the 
number 145 to the binary (1s and 0s) representation, you enable (set to 1) the 
bits that have the value 128, 16, and 1 (128 + 16 + 1 = 145) as shown below.

Once you enable all of the bits that mathematically add up to the number 
you are looking for, you disable (turn off) all the other bits by setting them 
to zero (0), as shown below.

So the eight bits that make the value of 145 are 10010001. Now you calculate 
the eight bits for the second octet of the IP address 145.25.10.100, which 
is 25. Again, use our chart to enable the bits that make the value 25 and then 
turn all other bits off. You should have the bits that have the value 16, 8, and 
1 enabled (16 + 8 + 1 equals the decimal value of 25) and the remaining bits 
should be turned off, as shown below.

The decimal value of the third octet in our 145.25.10.100 IP address 
example is 10, which, when converted to binary, has the binary value of 
00001010. When the decimal value of 100 in the fourth octet is converted to 
binary, we get a binary value of 01100100.
 
It is important that you are able to convert decimal values to binary and 
binary values to decimal for the exam. You have to practice it and be able to 
do it very quickly if you want to pass the CCENT certification exam. Be sure 
to check out the labs at the end of this chapter to practice converting 
decimal to binary and vice versa.

IP Address Classes
Let’s summarize what we know about IP addresses so far. You know that an 
IP address is a unique 32-bit address assigned to each system or device and 
is used to communicate with the system. The address is made up of four, 
8-bit octets and is divided into two parts, the network ID portion and the 
host ID portion. You also know that the subnet mask is used to determine 
which part of an IP address is the network ID and which part is the host ID 
portion. If the subnet mask has 255 in an octet, the corresponding octet in 
the IP address is part of the network ID. If there is a zero (0) in an octet of 
the subnet mask, the corresponding octet in the IP address is part of the 
host ID portion.
The next issue for us to tackle is figuring out what the subnet mask of a 
system is so you can determine what part of the IP address is the network 
ID. To determine what the subnet mask of a system is, you have to understand 
the different address classes in TCP/IP because they determine the default 
subnet mask of a system.
 
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for designing 
the IP addressing schemes.
Class A
The first class address to discuss is a class A address, which has a default 
subnet mask of 255.0.0.0, meaning the first octet is the network ID portion 
and the last three octets are the host ID portion of the address. This allows 

86
IP Address Classes
for 16,777,214 hosts on the network — a very big network! To calculate how 
many hosts can exist on the network, you use the formula of 2<# of host bits>.
For example, 12.x.y.z is a class A address with a subnet mask of 
255.0.0.0. This means there are 24 bits (the last 3 octets) that make up 
the host ID portion, so the formula is 224 = 16,777,216. But I said there were 
16,777,214 hosts on the network. Is my math wrong? No, after you use the 
formula to calculate the number of hosts you subtract 2 from it because 
there are two addresses on every network that you are not allowed to use. 
You are not allowed to use the address with all host bits set to 0, as that 
is reserved for the network ID, and you are not allowed to use the address 
with all host bits set to 1 because that is reserved for the broadcast address, 
which is the address that a system sends data to when it wants everyone on 
the network to receive the information.
 
It is imperative for the exam that you are familiar with converting binary to 
decimal. An example of when this ability is important is when you are 
identifying illegal addresses — the rules to remember are you are not 
allowed to assign a system the address with all host bits set to 0 (reserved 
for the network ID itself) and you are not allowed to assign a system the 
address with all host bits set to 1 (reserved for the broadcast address).
Now that we have this knowledge, we need to modify our formula for 
calculating the number of hosts that can exist on the network. Our modified 
formula is now 2<# of host bits> – 2.
In the example of the 12.x.y.z class A address, the two illegal addresses 
are 12.0.0.0 (reserved for the actual network ID) and 12.255.255.255 
(reserved for the broadcast address). The broadcast address is the address 
that a system sends data to when it wants everyone on the network to 
receive the information.
The final point to make about class A addresses is that they always have 
a number between 1 and 127 in the first octet. So if an IP address has a 
number between 1 and 127 in the first octet, you know that it has a default 
subnet mask of 255.0.0.0, which means the first octet is the network ID.
Why the range 1 to 127? Well, when IANA designed the addressing for 
TCP/IP, they defined class A addresses as having the first bit in the first 
octet as always off — this gives you the following binary ranges 00000001 
(decimal value 1) to 01111111 (decimal value 127).
It is important to note that — even though class A addresses have the value 
of the first octet range between 1 and 127 — you will never see a system use 
127 in the first octet because it is already reserved for the loopback address, 
which is an address that always refers to the TCP/IP software installed on your 
system. Typically, the loopback address is referred to as 127.0.0.1, but you 
could use any address that starts with 127 as the loopback address. The most 

Book I
Chapter 4

IP Address Classes
common use of the loopback address is as a quick way to make sure that 
TCP/IP has been installed on your system and that it is functioning properly. 
You can test your own system by typing the following in a command prompt:
Ping 127.0.0.1
If TCP/IP has been installed and is functioning correctly you will receive replies 
to the ping 127.0.0.1 command. If there are any issues with the protocol 
you will receive an error message as a result of the ping stating the problem.
A system’s IP address cannot start with 127, but it can have the number 127 
in the second, third, or fourth octets.
 
Table 4-1 summarizes what you need to know about Class A addresses.

Class B
A class B address is an address that has the first octet ranging from 128 to 191. 
The IANA states that a class B address will always have the first two bits of 
the first octet take a 10 state. This means that the possible values for the first 
octet in a class B address would range from 10000000 (128) to 10111111 (191).
A class B address has a default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0. This means 
that the first two octets are part of the network ID, and the last two octets 
make up the host ID. Using the formula of 2<# of host bits> – 2, you see that a 
class B address supports 65,534 hosts on the network (216 – 2). Class B 
networks are considered medium-sized networks.
An example of a class B network is 129.65.x.y, with 129.65.0.0 being 
the network ID (all host bits set to 0) and 129.65.255.255 being the 
broadcast address (all host bits set to 1).
 
Table 4-2 summarizes what you need to know about Class B addresses.

Class C
The next class address is a class C address, which has an IP address with 
the first octet ranging from 192 to 223. Again, the numbers are derived from 
binary. When the addressing was defined, class C addresses were defined as 
always having 110 as the first three bits of the first octet. This means that a 
class C address will range between 11000000 (192) to 11011111 (223).
The subnet mask for a class C address is 255.255.255.0, which means 
that the first three octets are part of the network ID, and the last octet makes 
up the host ID portion. This means that you can have 254 hosts (28 – 2) on a 
class C network — a fairly small network compared to a class A network.

Looking at Special Addresses
addresses are not used in production environments because they are for 
experimental purposes.
Class D addresses have a value in the first octet that ranges from 224 to 239, 
while class E addresses have a first octet that ranges between 240 and 247. 
You do not need to be familiar with class D and E addresses for the CCENT 
certification exam; I only mention them here so that you know there are 
more than class A, B, and C addresses.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, you need to be very familiar with IP 
addressing, starting with identifying class A, B, and C addresses.
Looking at Special Addresses
For the CCENT certification exam, it is important to be familiar with special 
address types such as private addresses and automatic private IP addresses. 
This section is designed to identify these special address types.
Public versus private addresses
A private address is an address that is not routable on the Internet. So, if you 
are using a private address, your systems cannot use the Internet without a 
device such as NAT to translate the address to a public address (an address 
that is routable on the Internet).
There are three private address ranges, one range per class address, that 
you will work with on networks. (For more on the class addresses, see the 
“IP Address Classes” section earlier in this chapter.) The three private IP 
address ranges are
 
✦ Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
 
✦ Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
 
✦ Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
 
For the CCENT certification exam, be sure to know the three private address 
ranges. Note that the private addresses are made up of one class A network ID, 
sixteen class B network ranges, and 256 class C network ranges. Remember 
that addresses that are not private are routable on the Internet and are 
considered public addresses that are registered to a specific owner.
Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
Another important address to be able to identify is an Automatic Private IP 
Address (APIPA). It is a feature of today’s operating systems and allows a 
client to assign itself an IP address if a DHCP server does not respond to the 
DHCP request. (I discuss DHCP servers in Book I, Chapter 3.) The address 

90
Assigning IP Addresses
that the client assigns to itself is within the 169.254.x.y network range. 
The system will also configure itself with a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0, 
but will not configure the default gateway entry. This means that if the 
DHCP server is down and your network clients boot up, they will all have an 
address in the 169.254.x.y range and will be able to communicate with 
one another. Because they are not configured for a default gateway entry, 
they will not be able to communicate with systems off the network or with 
the Internet.
 
When troubleshooting networking connectivity, use the ipconfig command 
on a Windows machine or ifconfig on a Linux system (some newer 
Linux systems use the ip addr command) to view the TCP/IP settings of a 
system. If the IP address is 169.254.x.y, that means the client cannot 
communicate with the DHCP server. Make sure that the client is connected 
to the network correctly and then verify that the DHCP server is functioning!
Assigning IP Addresses
In Book II, Chapter 2, you discover how to configure the different network 
cards, known as interfaces, on a Cisco router. But for now, I just want to discuss 
how the addresses are assigned on the client (also known as a workstation).
Identifying invalid addresses
Before we see how to assign IP addresses to the client systems, it is important 
to understand what an invalid address is. An invalid address is an address 
that is illegal to assign to a system or a device.
 
Be sure to remember these rules for the exam and for the real world:
 
✦ An address cannot start with 127. Any address that starts with 127  
reserved for the loopback address and is used to reference your own 
system.
 
✦ An address cannot have all host bits set to 1. All host bits set to 1 are 
reserved as the broadcast address for any given network ID.
 
✦ An address cannot have all host bits set to 0. All host bits set to 0 are 
reserved to reference the actual network ID. The network ID is used to 
program the routing tables on routers.
 
✦ An octet cannot contain a number over 255. If you add the values of all 
eight bits in an octet, you get the number 255; therefore, it is impossible 
to have a number higher than 255 in an octet.
 
✦ You cannot duplicate an address. You cannot duplicate any other 
address on the network or Internet. If you try to use an address already 
in use, you will receive a duplicate IP address error.

Assigning IP Addresses
Static addressing versus dynamic addressing
When assigning IP addresses to systems on the network, you will have to 
decide if you use static addressing or dynamic addressing. Static addressing 
means that you manually assign the IP address to the system or device, 
while dynamic addressing means that the address is assigned through DHCP. 
The term static means that the address does not change (unless you manually 
change it), whereas a dynamic address could be different each time your 
power on the workstation.
Normally, you will statically assign IP addresses to the following:
 
✦ Servers: In networking environments, you normally do not want the 
address of a server to change, so you statically assign it an IP address. 
This way, you always know the IP address of the server.
 
✦ Routers: A router is another example of a device that you do not want 
the IP address to change on. You will need to configure all your clients’ 
default gateway settings to point to the router. As a result, you do not 
want the router’s IP address to change.
 
✦ Switches: You do not need to assign your switch an IP address for it to 
filter and forward traffic to the destination system. You need to assign 
an IP address to your switch only if you intend to remotely manage the 
switch from a Telnet session, ssh session, or a Web browser. If you want 
your switch to have an IP address, you will configure it with a static 
address.
 
✦ Printers: A printer is another example of a device that should not have 
its IP address change, as clients and servers will be configured to point 
to the printer by its IP address. If the IP address changes on the printer, 
you will need to reconfigure each client to print to the new address.
After you have manually configured the IP addresses on routers, switches, 
printers, and servers, it is then time to configure IP addresses on your client 
systems. As mentioned earlier in the book, most network administrators will 
create a DHCP server on the network so that the IP addresses are assigned 
to systems automatically. Book II, Chapter 4 shows you how to configure 
your Cisco router as a DHCP server, so I save that discussion for then.
Configuring TCP/IP on a client
Before I leave the discussion of IP addresses, I want to outline the steps to 
configure a Windows and Linux system for an IP address. Configuring IP 
addresses on a client is not required knowledge for your CCENT certification 
exam, as the exam focuses on the router configuration, but I think it is 
important to discuss this because it is part of configuring a network.

92
Assigning IP Addresses
To configure TCP/IP on a Windows system, access your local area 
connection properties and configure the TCP/IP protocol. Be aware that all 
Microsoft operating systems have TCP/IP installed by default. You simply 
need to configure the IP address on the system if you are statically configuring 
addresses. To configure TCP/IP on a Windows system, follow these steps:
 
1. Locate the network connections.
 
• Windows XP/2003: Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Network and 
Internet Connections➪Network Connections.
 
• Windows 2008/Vista/7: Click Start. Right-click Network and choose 
Properties. Click the Manage Network Connections link on the left.
 
2. Right-click your local area connection and choose Properties.
 
3. In the list of items used by the connection, do one of the following:
 
• Windows XP/2003: Select TCP/IP and then choose Properties.
 
• Windows 2008/Vista/7: Select Internet Protocol version 4 (TCP/IPv4) 
and then click Properties.
 
4. To assign a static address, select Use the Following IP Address (as 
shown in Figure 4-4) and then type your computer’s IP address, subnet 
mask, and default gateway in the corresponding text boxes.
 
Figure 4-4: 
Configuring 
TCP/IP on 
a Windows 
client.
 
 
5. To configure the system to send DNS queries to a specific DNS server, 
type the address of your DNS server in the Preferred DNS Server 
text box.
 
6. Click OK and then click OK again.

The TCP/IP Internet Model
The steps are very similar to configure a Linux system for a static address. 
The steps that you take will differ depending on the Linux distribution you 
are using. The following steps are how to configure Linux Fedora with a 
static IP address:
 
1. Choose System➪Administration➪Network.
 
2. Once inside the Network Configuration dialog, select the Eth0 network 
card and click the Edit button.
 
3. Choose the option Statically Set IP Address and then type the desired 
IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway you want the system 
to use.
 
4. Click OK.
If you decide to configure TCP/IP on your Windows or Linux systems 
dynamically through a DHCP server, you typically do not need to do anything 
at the client, as being a DHCP client is normally the default. If you want to 
verify that you are configured to be a DHCP client, you follow the same steps 
listed above, but you select the Obtain an IP Address Automatically option in 
Step 4 for a Windows system, or choose the Automatically Obtain IP Address 
Settings with DHCP option in Step 3 for the Linux system.
The TCP/IP Internet Model
A very important topic we need to discuss is the TCP/IP Internet model, 
which is a four-layer model that defines the functionality of different network 
components that run at the different layers. If you understand the OSI model 
(which I explain in Book I, Chapter 2), you will have no problem understanding 
the TCP/IP Internet model because essentially what the designers of TCP/IP 
did was simplify the OSI model to become the TCP/IP Internet model.
The four layers
The TCP/IP Internet model is a four-layer model (see Figure 4-5), as opposed 
to the seven layers in the OSI model. When the TCP/IP Internet model was 
designed, it was decided that the top three layers of the OSI model would be 
handled by the software applications — so the functionality of those three 
layers were grouped together to create the application layer of the TCP/IP 
Internet model.

The name and functionality of the transport layer stays the same in the 
TCP/IP Internet model. The network layer of the OSI model becomes the 
Internet layer in the TCP/IP Internet model — the functionality of this layer 
stays the same in spite of the layer’s name change. Finally, the data link and the 
physical layers are grouped together to create the network access layer in 
the TCP/IP Internet model.
The following summarizes the purpose of each layer of the TCP/IP Internet 
model:
 
✦ Application: Responsible for initiating the request on the sending 
computer and servicing the request on the receiving system. On the 
sending system, once the request has been created it is then passed 
down to the transport layer.
 
✦ Transport: Responsible for reliable and unreliable delivery. When the 
request is passed down to the transport layer, a transport layer protocol 
is selected based on whether reliable delivery or unreliable delivery 
is required. With reliable delivery, the system delivers the data and 
ensures the information reaches the destination. If the data does not 
reach the destination, the information is retransmitted. If an unreliable 
delivery protocol is used, the information is sent to the destination but 
not monitored to ensure that it reaches the destination. I talk more 
about reliable and unreliable protocols in the “Transport layer protocols” 
section later in this chapter.
 
✦ Internet: Responsible for routing and logical addressing, just as the 
network layer of the OSI model is responsible for logical addressing and 
routing.
 
✦ Network access: Responsible for tasks such as physical addressing and 
the physical aspects of the network, including placing the bits on the 
wire.

The TCP/IP Internet Model
Data encapsulation
Like the OSI model, as the information flows down the TCP/IP Internet model 
there is header information for each layer that is added to the packet — 
appending header information at each layer is known as encapsulation. For 
example, looking at Figure 4-6, you can see that when information travels from 
the sending system it is first created by the application and then passed 
down to the transport layer. At the transport layer, a protocol is selected for 
delivery, and then the transport layer information is appended to the data as 
a header — the transport layer header. The data is then passed down to the 
Internet layer.

The Internet protocol header is then added to the packet (typically containing 
the source and destination IP addresses) and the information is then passed 
down to the network access layer, where network access layer information, 
such as the MAC address, is placed in a header and appended to the packet.
The packet is then sent on to the destination, and as the information is 
passed through the layers on the receiving system, the appropriate header 
is stripped off and read. For example, when looking at Figure 4-6, you see 
that at the Internet layer on the receiving system the system strips off the 
Internet layer header and reads the header (in this case, the destination IP 
address, to verify that the packet is destined for the system).
 
The term for the process of adding header information at each layer is called 
encapsulation — be sure to be familiar with this term for your exam!

96
The TCP/IP Internet Model
Application layer protocols
The application layer is responsible for initiating the request — or servicing 
the request, depending on whether you look at it from the sending or receiving 
system’s point of view. There are many different application layer protocols 
in the TCP/IP protocol suite, and chances are you have used many of the 
different protocols in your day-to-day activities.
The following is a listing of popular application layer protocols used in the 
TCP/IP protocol suite:
 
✦ HTTP: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is responsible for delivering 
Web pages from the Web server to the Web browser. Do not confuse 
HTTP with HTML; HTML is the language used to create the page while 
HTTP is the protocol that delivers the page to the client.
 
✦ HTTPS: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is responsible 
for delivering Web traffic between the Web client and Web server in an 
encrypted format.
 
✦ Telnet: Telnet is an application protocol that is responsible for allowing 
you to remotely run an application that resides on a Telnet server. For 
example, you can Telnet into a Cisco router from across the Internet and 
administer the router as if you were sitting at it.
 
✦ FTP: The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is an application protocol that 
allows you to connect to an FTP server and download files from that 
server.
 
✦ SMTP: The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the Internet protocol for 
sending an e-mail message. Your computer at home sends an e-mail 
message out on the Internet using SMTP. Here’s how this works: Your 
e-mail software connects to your Internet service provider’s SMTP 
server and then sends the message. When your ISP’s mail server 
receives the message, it sends the message to the SMTP server of the 
person you are sending the mail message to. That SMTP server then 
deposits the e-mail in the user’s mailbox until the message is downloaded.
 
✦ POP3: Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) is the Internet protocol for 
reading, or downloading, e-mail. For example, in order for you to read 
your personal e-mail from your ISP, your ISP installs POP3 on the e-mail 
server that holds your e-mail. You then use your e-mail software (POP3 
client) which connects to that mail server and downloads the e-mail.
 
✦ IMAP4: Internet Message Access Protocol 4 (IMAP4) is another example 
of an Internet protocol used to read e-mail over the Internet. IMAP4 has 
additional features beyond what POP3 offers, such as being able to filter 
messages that are downloaded and having a copy of the messages left 
on the server with a synchronized copy stored on the client. IMAP4 also 
supports more folders than the typical inbox, outbox, sent items, and 
deleted items.

Book I
Chapter 4
Introduction 
to TCP/IP
97
The TCP/IP Internet Model
 
✦ SNMP: The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a protocol 
used to remotely manage a network device over a TCP/IP network, as 
long as that device has SNMP running.
 
✦ LDAP: The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an industry 
standard protocol for accessing a network directory that contains 
objects such as user accounts, printers, or folders on the network. This 
protocol is typically used to search a directory listing of objects across 
a TCP/IP network.
 
✦ NTP: The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is an industry standard protocol for 
synchronizing time on systems across a TCP/IP network or the Internet.
It is important to understand that when an application initiates the request 
on the sending system, the application request travels down the model to 
the transport layer, where a transport layer protocol is selected by the 
application, and then onto the Internet layer where an Internet layer protocol 
is selected. The information is then passed on to the network access layer, 
which is the physical aspect of the network. Remember that at each of the 
layers the information passes through, data encapsulation occurs where 
specific header information that relates to that layer is appended to the 
packet. (Refer to Figure 4-6.)
Transport layer protocols
The transport layer is responsible for reliable and unreliable delivery. As you 
read earlier in this chapter, reliable delivery means that when information 
is sent from one system to another, a tracking mechanism verifies that the 
information has reached the destination. If the information does not reach 
the destination, the information is retransmitted.
Unreliable delivery means that there is no tracking of the information to 
ensure it reaches the destination. The concept of unreliable communication 
is that you simply send the information and hope it reaches the destination. 
Unreliable delivery exists because of its performance — because it doesn’t 
track data sent, unreliable delivery is more efficient, as it has less overhead.
In the TCP/IP protocol suite, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the 
reliable protocol and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is the unreliable protocol 
in the protocol suite.
 
Another term for reliable delivery is connection-oriented communication, and 
another term for unreliable delivery is connectionless communication. TCP is 
the connection-oriented protocol in TCP/IP, while UDP is the connectionless 
communication protocol!

98
The TCP/IP Internet Model
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
The TCP transport layer protocol is responsible for reliable delivery, and 
it accomplishes this by using sequence and acknowledgement numbers. A 
sequence number is a large number assigned to the packet being sent. When 
the receiving system receives the packet, the receiving system sends 
back an acknowledgement that uses the original sequence number as an 
acknowledgement. This is TCP’s way of saying, “I received packet number 
1065438.” (See Figure 4-7.)

In Figure 4-7, notice that ComputerA is sending data to ComputerB, and the 
transport layer header has a field for the sequence number. In this example, 
the sequence number assigned to the packet is 1065438. Also notice that 
when ComputerB sends a reply, the transport layer header contains an 
acknowledgement number field, which is the packet that the system is 
confirming has been received. It is also important to note that when 
ComputerB sends the reply with the acknowledgement number, the reply 
message is its own packet that requires its own sequence number. Also note 
that the two sequence numbers are totally unrelated — ComputerA has a 
set of sequence numbers it uses for each packet sent by that system, and 
ComputerB has its own set of sequence numbers that it uses.
TCP ports
The TCP protocol uses port numbers to identify the different applications 
that run on a system, and as a result, each application must have a unique 
port number. (See Figure 4-8.) Examples of applications that use port 
numbers are Web servers, FTP servers, or any TCP/IP application, including 
client software such as your Web browser.

Looking at Figure 4-8, you can see that the IP header contains the source and 
destination IP address (more on the IP header later in the chapter, in the 
section “Internet Protocol (IP)”). This information is important because it 
has to be known where the packet is headed and where it came from. When 
ComputerB receives the packet, it checks the destination address to verify 
that it is the intended recipient. Once it verifies that it is the intended 
recipient, the packet is then passed to the transport layer, where the 
transport layer header is read. Upon reading the transport layer header, the 
system knows which port number the packet is destined for, and it sends 
the packet to the application using that port number. Once the application 
receives the packet, it reads the request and generates a reply.
In this example, when the reply is sent back, the original source and 
destination fields are swapped. (See Figure 4-9.) For example, in the reply 
message, the source IP address is 12.0.0.5, and the destination IP is 
12.0.0.10. Likewise, the source port and destination ports are swapped: 
The new source port is 80 (the Web site), and the new destination port is 
1037 (the Web browser on the client). This is because the message (in this 
case, a Web page) is coming from the Web site and headed to the client’s 
Web browser.
 
It is important for the CCENT certification exam that you memorize some of 
the popular TCP port numbers that applications use. Table 4-4 displays a 
listing of the popular port numbers that you need to be familiar with.

generated number and communicated to the other system via the three-way 
handshake.
The three-way handshake is a three-step process that creates a TCP connection. 
After the connection is established with the three-way handshake, the data 
between the client and server is then exchanged, with each packet having a 
sequence number, and each packet needing to be acknowledged.
Figure 4-10 displays the three-way handshake. The first step in the three-way 
handshake is known as the synchronization (SYN) phase. In this phase, the 
client is sending the initial sequence number to the server. In the second 
phase of the three-way handshake, the server replies by acknowledging (ACK) 
that it has received the SYN message, but at the same time communicates its 
initial sequence number to the client — this is why the second phase is called 
the ACK/SYN phase. The final phase of the three-way handshake is the client 
acknowledging that it has received the server’s ACK/SYN message by sending 
a final acknowledgement message — this in known as the ACK phase.

Once the three-way handshake occurs, the data is exchanged between the 
two systems involved in the dialog. After the data is exchanged, one of the 
systems decides that it wants to end the conversation, so it sends a signal 
to the other system indicating that it is done with the conversation. This 
signal is sent by sending a finish message (FIN) to the system. For example, 
ComputerA sends a FIN message to ComputerB to let it know that it is ready 
to end the conversation. (See Figure 4-11.)

The TCP/IP Internet Model
Once ComputerB receives the FIN message, it sends an acknowledgement 
that it has received the FIN message and, then, in the third step, sends its 
own FIN message. This is similar to talking on the phone; when someone 
says, “goodbye,” you respond with “goodbye.”
After ComputerB sends its FIN message in the third step, the fourth step to 
end a TCP conversation is a final message sent by ComputerA to acknowledge 
that the previous message (the FIN) has been received.
TCP flags
In the previous section, you see how the three-way handshake that starts 
a TCP connection and the four-phase process that ends the TCP connection 
are very important processes in the dialog, and the packets involved are 
very special types of packets. In order to identify these special types of 
packets, TCP has what are called TCP flags. A TCP flag is an indicator in the 
packet (actually, it is a bit) that can be turned on or off to identify that type 
of packet. For example, if a system acknowledges that a previous packet has 
been received, it then sends a packet with the ACK bit turned on. (It has a 1 
value.)
 
Table 4-5 is a listing of popular TCP flags that you need to be familiar with 
for the CCENT certification exam.
Table 4-5 
TCP Flags
Flag
Purpose
ACK
The ACK bit is set on any packet that is acknowledging a previous 
packet.
SYN
The SYN bit is set on a packet that is in the first or second phase of the 
three-way handshake.
FIN
The FIN flag is set when a system is trying to say goodbye to another 
system. This is how TCP applications end a conversation politely.
RST 
An application can end a conversation impolitely by simply dropping 
the connection with the reset flag (RST).
PSH
The push flag (PSH) is used to force information on a system.
URG
The urgent flag (URG) is how a TCP application flags a piece of informa-
tion as highly important.
The TCP header
You have been reading that the TCP protocol is used for reliable delivery 
and places information such as source and destination ports in the header of 
the packet — which is actually known as the TCP header in this case.

The TCP/IP Internet Model
There are a number of pieces of information (called fields) that are stored in 
the TCP header, so I want to take a few minutes to outline the TCP header. 
Figure 4-12 displays the fields that exist in the TCP header, with each row in 
the header being a total of 32 bits in length.

The following is a quick description of the important fields in the TCP 
header:
 
✦ Source Port (16 bits): The port number used by the application sending 
the information.
 
✦ Destination Port (16 bits): The port number of the application that is to 
receive the information on the destination system.
 
✦ Sequence Number (32 bits): The number assigned to this packet.
 
✦ Acknowledgement Number (32 bits): A packet number that this packet 
is acknowledging.
 
✦ Offset (4 bits): Specifies where the data begins.
 
✦ Reserved (6 bits): This field is always set to 0 and is for future use.
 
✦ Flags (6 bits): This is where the bits for ACK, SYN, FIN, RST, PSH, and 
URG are stored.
 
✦ Window Size (16 bits): The amount of information that can be sent 
before an acknowledgement is received.
 
✦ Checksum (16 bits): A checksum field that is used to verify the integrity 
of the TCP header.
 
✦ Urgent Pointer (16 bits): The urgent pointer is used if the URG flag is set 
and points to the last piece of data that is considered urgent.

104
The TCP/IP Internet Model
 
✦ Options (variable length): Any additional options that need to be 
specified in the TCP header.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, be sure to know about the source port, 
destination port, sequence number, acknowledgement number, and flags 
found in the TCP header.
User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is the connectionless transport layer 
protocol in the TCP/IP protocol suite. Because the UDP protocol is 
connectionless, or unreliable, it has no three-way handshake to start a 
conversation, and no sequence and acknowledgement numbers — because 
it doesn’t have a tracking mechanism to ensure delivery. 
UDP is a very simple protocol with less overhead than TCP, so if an applica-
tion developer wants a network application to perform quickly and he does 
not care if data is lost (or is willing to make delivery verification part of the 
application layer) he uses the UDP protocol instead of TCP. UDP is the pro-
tocol of choice when sending small bits of information such as DNS lookups 
or DHCP traffic where you do not want to have the overhead of establishing 
a session when data needs to be delivered.
Due to the simplicity of the UDP protocol, the UDP header is much smaller 
and more basic than the TCP header. Figure 4-13 displays the UDP header 
and identifies the fields that exist in the UDP header.

It is important to understand that UDP is like TCP in the sense that it uses 
source and destination ports to identify the application sending the 
information, and the application on the destination system that is to receive 
the information.

Book I
Chapter 4
Introduction 
to TCP/IP
105
The TCP/IP Internet Model
The following is a quick description of the fields that exist in the UDP 
header:
 
✦ Source Port (16 bits): The port number of the application sending the 
information.
 
✦ Destination Port (16 bits): The port number of the application on the 
destination system that is to receive the information.
 
✦ Length (16 bits): The length of the UDP header in bytes.
 
✦ Checksum (16 bits): Verifies the integrity of the UDP header.
Most applications today use TCP as the transport layer protocol because 
they want to guarantee that the information reaches the destination, but 
here are a few examples of applications that use UDP:
 
✦ DHCP: When a system’s or device’s TCP/IP settings are retrieved from a 
DHCP server, the traffic uses UDP as the transport layer protocol. There 
are two ports used; when packets are sent from the DHCP server to the 
DHCP client, they use UDP port 67, while packets from the client to the 
DHCP server use UDP port 68.
 
✦ DNS: UDP is used when a client queries a DNS server for the IP address 
of an FQDN. In this example, the packet is destined for UDP port 53.
 
✦ SNMP: The SNMP protocol uses UDP port 161.
 
✦ Streaming and multicast applications: Most streaming applications, 
including Voice Over IP (VoIP), and multicast applications use UDP as 
the transport layer protocol to deliver the data.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, you need to be able to identify the UDP 
header and also know examples of applications that use UDP, such as DHCP, 
DNS, and SNMP. Be sure to know that DHCP uses ports 67/68 and DNS uses 
port 53.
Internet layer protocols
After a transport layer protocol (TCP or UDP) is selected for the traffic, the 
data is passed down to the Internet layer, where an Internet layer protocol 
is selected. A number of different protocols run at the Internet layer, three 
of which you need to be familiar with for the CCENT certification exam. The 
sections that follow tell you about those three layers (IP, ICMP, and ARP).
Internet Protocol (IP)
The Internet Protocol (IP) protocol is responsible for routing and logical 
addressing. I talk about routing later in Book III, but the concept of routing 
is that the IP protocol looks at the destination address in a packet and then 
decides where to send the packet.

106
The TCP/IP Internet Model
Logical addressing deals with all the topics discussed in this chapter, such 
as IP addressing, and how a system mathematically calculates whether the 
destination system resides on the same network (using the subnet mask) — 
this is all handled by the IP protocol running on the device or system.
When the data is passed down from the transport layer to the Internet layer, 
the IP header — containing IP-related information such as the source IP 
address and the destination IP address — is added. You can see in Figure 4-14 
that more fields than just the source and destination IP address are stored in 
the IP header.

The following is a description of each field found in the IP header:
 
✦ Version (4 bits): The version of IP being used, either 4 or 6. The CCENT 
certification exam is focused on IP version 4. 
 
✦ Header Length (4 bits): Specifies the size of the header.
 
✦ Type of Service (8 bits): Specifies how a system should handle the 
packet. The bits in this field indicate certain communication settings. 
For example, low delay means that the information should be dealt with 
right away.
 
✦ Total Length (16 bits): Specifies the size of the packet, including the 
header and data portion.
 
✦ Identification (16 bits): The packet can be broken into smaller chunks 
called fragments due to the fact that the network can send only so much 
data at one time — known as the maximum transmission unit (MTU). This 
field can be used to uniquely identify the fragment.
 
✦ IP Flags (3 bits): There are three IP flags; the first is the reserved bit, 
which is always set to zero. The second is the Don’t Fragment (DF) bit, 
which means that this data is not allowed to be fragmented. The final bit 

Book I
Chapter 4
Introduction 
to TCP/IP
107
The TCP/IP Internet Model
is a flag that states there are More Fragments (MF) — meaning that the 
data has been broken down into smaller fragments and the system can 
expect more pieces to come.
 
✦ Fragment Offset (13 bits): The fragment offset is a value specifying 
which piece of the puzzle this fragment is. This field is used to specify 
the order that the packet fragments are to be assembled in on the 
receiving end.
 
✦ Time To Live (8 bits): The Time to Live (TTL) field specifies how many 
routers this packet can pass through before the packet is expired. Each 
time the packet hits a router, the TTL is decremented by 1. Windows 
operating systems set the initial value of a TTL to 128, while most Linux 
operating systems set the TTL to 64.
 
✦ Protocol (8 bits): This field specifies other protocols that are to be used 
with this data. For example, this field specifies whether TCP or UDP 
should be used as the transport layer protocol.
 
✦ Header Checksum (16 bits): A checksum field that is used to verify the 
integrity of the IP header.
 
✦ Source Address (32 bits): The IP address of the system that is sending 
the data. The receiving system sends a reply to the address specified 
here.
 
✦ Destination Address (32 bits): The IP address of the system where this 
packet is delivered.
 
✦ IP Options (Variable): Any additional information that an application 
may want to specify in the IP header.
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
Another example of a protocol in the TCP/IP protocol suite that runs at the 
Internet layer is the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). ICMP is the 
error- and status-reporting protocol built into TCP/IP. For example, when 
you ping a system, you receive status information indicating whether the 
system you have pinged is up and running. (“Request timed out” in the code 
that follows indicating that the system cannot be found.) For more information 
on troubleshooting commands such as ping, check out Book III, Chapter 5.

108
The TCP/IP Internet Model
The ping command is an example of a program that uses ICMP as the 
underlying protocol to display this status information. It is important to 
understand that there are different types of ICMP messages. Looking at 
Figure 4-15, when you ping a system, your system sends what is called an 
ICMP echo request message. If the system you are pinging is available, it 
sends an ICMP echo reply message.
 
Figure 4-15: 
ICMP is the 
underlying 
protocol 
used by 
the ping 
command.
 
C:\>ping
ICMP Echo Request (Type 8)
ICMP Echo Reply (Type 0)
Notice in the figure that the echo request message is known as type 8, while 
the echo reply message is known as type 0. The ICMP type indicates each 
different status or error message with ICMP; be sure to be familiar with ICMP 
types 8 and 0 for the CCENT certification exam. Some of the popular ICMP 
types are shown in Table 4-6.

You will notice in Table 4-6 that I have added a code column; the purpose 
of the code is that some of the different types need more of a breakdown 
explaining in more detail why a message is occurring. For example, ICMP 
type 3 is destination unreachable, but there are many reasons why a 
destination may be unreachable. So type 3 has many codes — type 3, code 
0 means the destination is unreachable because the entire network is not 

Book I

Introduction 
to TCP/IP
109
The TCP/IP Internet Model
available, while type 3, code 3 means that the destination is not available 
because the port you are trying to communicate with is unreachable.
Some of the ICMP types do not have multiple reasons why the message is 
occurring, so you do not see multiple codes. For example, ICMP type 8 is an 
echo request message, and because an echo request has only one code, the 
code is always zero. The following code displays what the ping command 
shows when an echo reply message is received from a ping command. (This 
means that the system you are communicating with is up and running.) 
Notice that you do not see any indication that ping is using ICMP as the 
underlying protocol or the ICMP types being used. If you were to monitor 
the traffic with a traffic analyzer you would see the ICMP protocol and types.

ICMP is a very simple protocol that has only a few fields in its header (see 
Figure 4-16), but keep in mind that ICMP traffic is placed in an IP packet and 
uses IP for delivery of the data.

Type
Code
Checksum
In Figure 4-16, notice that the major fields in the ICMP header are the Type 
field (8 bits) and the Code field (8 bits), which are used to indicate the type 
of ICMP message. For example, if we were looking at an echo request packet, 
the Type field would have an 8 in it, while the Code field would have a 0 in it. 
There is also a 16-bit Checksum field in the header, which verifies the integ-
rity of the header and ensures it has not been altered in transit. The field 
labeled other is also known as the data field and contains any additional data 
to go with the ICMP message. For example, the ICMP echo request message 
that is generated by a Microsoft operating system places part of the alphabet 
in the data (other) field.

110
The TCP/IP Internet Model
 
For the CCENT certification exam, remember that ICMP is an Internet layer 
protocol that is responsible for error reporting and status information. Also 
be familiar with ICMP type 8 and ICMP type 0.
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
The final Internet layer protocol to discuss is the Address Resolution Protocol, 
also known as ARP, which is a very important protocol because it is responsible 
for converting the logical address we are trying to communicate with to the 
physical address.
Let’s look at an example. In Figure 4-17, you are sitting at ComputerA, and 
you want to communicate with ComputerB. Normally, when you communicate 
with a system you use the IP address of that system (the logical address). 
When you try to send data to that system, the first thing that needs to 
happen is your system needs to figure out the MAC address of ComputerB 
(the physical address) because at the lowest level all communication is sent 
using the physical address.
At this point, ComputerA sends an ARP message out on the network. The 
ARP message is a packet destined for all systems (a broadcast message). 
This message is known as an ARP request, and it says, “Whoever has the 
12.0.0.6 IP address, please send me your MAC address.” This message is 
received by all systems on the network, but only ComputerB replies because 
that is the IP address of ComputerB. ComputerB replies by sending its MAC 
address in what is known as the ARP reply message.

ARP is used 
to translate 
the logical 
address to 
a physical 
address.

12.0.0.6
12.0.0.7

Book I
Chapter 4
Introduction 
to TCP/IP
111
The TCP/IP Internet Model
 
It is important to note that when ComputerA receives the ARP reply, it then 
stores the IP address of ComputerB and the MAC address for that system in 
an area of memory known as the ARP cache. The ARP cache is then used in 
the future to prevent future broadcast messages for the same address, as it 
stores the address already.
Another important note to make is that when a system on your network 
communicates with a system on another network or the Internet, your 
system will ARP the default gateway (the router) because that is who your 
system sends the data to so that it can be delivered off the network.
Once your system ARPs the router on your network, your router then ARPs 
the next router that the information is passed on to. It is important to note 
that any system or device running TCP/IP has an ARP cache, and if any 
destination IP address does not exist in the ARP cache, the device will ARP 
the destination IP address.
Now that you understand the core protocols that run at the Internet layer, 
let’s take a look at the four-layer TCP/IP model one more time and place the 
different protocols discussed in this chapter at the appropriate layers. (See 
Figure 4-18.)

Remember for the CCENT certification exam that ARP is responsible for 
converting the logical address to the physical address. Also remember that 
the ARP request is a broadcast message that has a destination MAC address 
of FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF.

Chapter Summary
Chapter Summary
This chapter discusses the basics of TCP/IP, and this is something you will 
need to master for the CCENT certification exam. The following lists some 
key points to remember about TCP/IP:
 
✦ An IP address is a 32-bit value that uniquely identifies the system.
 
✦ The IP address is made up of four octets that are divided into two parts — 
the network ID and the host ID.
 
✦ The octets that correspond to the network ID are determined by the 
subnet mask.
 
✦ There are three major classes of IP address: class A, class B, and class C.
 
✦ Class A networks have a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0 and support 
16,777,214 hosts on the network.
 
✦ Class B networks have a default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 and support 
65,534 hosts on the network.
 
✦ Class C networks have a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 and 
support 254 hosts on the network.
 
✦ Some IP addresses do not allow you to assign to systems or devices on 
the network; they are the network ID and the broadcast address, and 
you are not allowed to use an IP address that has 127 in the first octet, 
as it is reserved for loopback testing.
 
✦ There are four layers in the TCP/IP Internet model: the application layer, 
the transport layer, the Internet layer, and the network access layer.
 
✦ At the transport layer, TCP is responsible for reliable, connection-oriented 
communication, while UDP is responsible for unreliable, connectionless 
communication.
 
✦ At the Internet layer, IP is responsible for logical addressing and routing, 
ICMP is responsible for error and status reporting, and ARP is responsible 
for converting the logical address to the physical address.

A very important practice is to take some time to look at different IP 
addresses and decide if the addresses are valid to assign to a system, or a 
device on the network, such as a router. An invalid address is an address 
that is illegal to assign to a system. Fill in the following table by identifying if 
the address is valid and, if not, specify why it is not valid.

his chapter is the critical chapter to understanding IP addressing, and it 
will help you prepare for questions related to IP addressing on the 
CCENT certification exam. This chapter focuses on the concept of subnetting, 
including why you want to subnet, and how to subnet an address range! A 
great topic, and an exciting one at that! This chapter also introduces you to 
variable-length subnet masks (VLSM); a topic you find out more about when 
you look to your CCNA certification. VLSM is a feature designed to make 
better use of the addresses when subnetting a network.
The CCENT certification exam heavily tests your knowledge of IP addressing 
and subnetting, so it is important to make sure that you are very comfortable 
with this chapter. Not only do you have to read this chapter and do the 
examples on your own with a pen and paper, but you must practice the 
math so much that it becomes second nature! The reason is you have a 
limited amount of time on the exam and doing long calculations for subnetting 
scenarios will use up too much time on the clock.

Identifying Reasons to Subnet
Subnetting is the concept of dividing your IP address block into multiple 
smaller IP address blocks. Before I dive into the exciting concepts of subnetting 
and the brain-numbing calculations (it’s actually not that bad) required to 
subnet network ranges, it is important to focus on why you need to subnet. 
When teaching subnetting in the classroom, I find that students are so 
focused on the math that they forget why network designers implement 
subnetting in the first place. This section is designed to give you the 
background to understand why you might want to subnet.
For this discussion, let us assume that you have the IP range of 24.0.0.0, 
which is a class A network range that supports over 16 million addresses. 
You decide that you want to divide this network into multiple broadcast 
domains within your office to cut down on the broadcast traffic that goes 
from one end of the network to the other. You divide the network into two 
broadcast domains by placing a router (NY-RI) in the middle of the network 
and connecting two switches to the router, as shown in Figure 5-1.
 
The labels F0/0 and F0/1 are unique identifiers for each of the Fast Ethernet 
interfaces on the routers. You find out more about interfaces and their 
unique IDs in Book II, Chapter 1.

After placing the router in the middle of the network, you then connect it 
to the two network switches, NY-SW1 and NY-SW2. After the switches are 
connected, the systems are then plugged into the switches and assigned IP 
addresses within the network range of 24.0.0.0. Each system is assigned 
a subnet mask of 255.0.0.0, and the default gateway is configured for the 
router interface closest to the system.

Identifying Reasons to Subnet
The question to answer is this: After assigning all the IP addresses, subnet 
masks, and default gateway settings to each of the systems, can ComputerA 
ping ComputerB (and why or why not)?
The answer to the question is no, ComputerA cannot ping ComputerB. The 
reason is the IP protocol running on the system believes the computers are 
on the same network, so the computer never forwards the packet to the 
router. Why would it? As far as the system is concerned, all IP addresses 
that start with 24.0.0.0 are on the same network.
Let’s take a look at how this works. When ComputerA goes to ping 
ComputerB, the IP protocol on ComputerA looks at its IP address and subnet 
mask to determine which octets in the address correspond to the network 
ID. With a subnet mask of 255.0.0.0, the system determines that the 
network ID is 24.0.0.0. The system then compares the network ID to the 
corresponding octet of the system it is trying to communicate with. If the 
network IDs are the same, the systems believe they are logically on the same 
network, so there is no need to send the data to the router. (See Figure 5-2.) 
This is a problem!

Same Network?: Yes
What you need to do is modify the subnet mask so that the logical address 
corresponds to the physical network structure, which means that the physical 
network has two network segments. So you need to divide the logical 
address into two networks as well. This is the purpose of subnetting — to 
manipulate the subnet mask of an address so that more bits are allocated to 
the network ID, which as a result, increases the number of networks. Once 
you calculate the different networks, you can then assign a network ID to 
each network segment in the diagram.
Let’s get to work!

Subnetting a Network
Subnetting a Network
There are a number of different subnetting calculators online and a number 
of different quick ways to subnet. However, I want to make sure that you 
know how to subnet the long and hard way, as it ensures you understand 
where all the numbers are coming from. In this section, you find out how 
to subnet class A, class B, and class C networks before discovering how to 
subnet the quick way.
Subnetting a class A network
The first example to go over with you is subnetting a class A address. Use 
the example from Figure 5-1 — you need to subnet the 24.0.0.0 class A 
address range. Let’s assume that you want to divide it into four networks 
instead of two, though — perhaps for future growth reasons.
Understanding ANDing
The term used to describe how the IP protocol compares two addresses against one another to 
determine if the two addresses are on the same network is anding, and it is done at the bit level. 
Let’s look at an example of how anding is performed.
When ComputerA sends data to ComputerB, the IP protocol first performs a mathematical opera-
tion on the binary values of the IP address against the binary value of the subnet mask to create 
a result. Then the IP protocol performs the same mathematical operation on the binary value of 
ComputerB’s IP address against ComputerA’s subnet mask to create another result. Once both 
results are calculated they are compared — and if they are equal the two systems exist on the 
same network.
As mentioned, the actual mathematical operation is performed at the bit level — meaning that the 
first bit in the IP address is calculated against the first bit in the subnet mask to create the first bit 
in the result, then IP moves to the second bit and performs the same operation. The mathematical 
operation for anding is if the two bits have a one value then a 1 is generated in the result for that 
bit position. If any other combination of bits are compared (for example 0 and 1, 1 and 0, 0 and 0) 
then a 0 bit is generated in the result set. Here is an example of how anding looks:
ComputerA IP:     11000000.10100000.00000000.00001010
ComputerA Subnet: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
Result:           11000000.10100000.00000000.00000000
ComputerB IP:     11000000.10100000.00000000.00001011
ComputerA Subnet: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
Result:           11000000.10100000.00000000.00000000
When looking at the two results, you see they have generated the same answer which means that 
both systems are part of the same network. This is anding!

Subnetting a Network
 
Get a few blank pieces of paper and walk through the calculations with me.
The idea behind subnetting is to take some of the host bits in a subnet mask 
and convert them to network bits (also called subnet bits), by turning the 
bit on. Before you find out how to do that, you first need to determine how 
many bits to convert from host bits to subnet bits. The formula to figure this 
out is
2<# of bits> = number of subnets
For example, if you are looking for two subnets (also known as networks), 
you use this formula:
21 = 2 subnets
This creates two subnets. If you want four subnets, as in my example, the 
formula of 2number of bits = number of subnets would need to be
22 = 4 subnets
 
For the CCENT certification exam, you need to be able to calculate how 
many bits are needed for a given number of subnets.
Now that you know to manipulate two bits in the subnet mask to create four 
subnets, the next step is to write out the starting IP address information. 
In my example, the network address 24.0.0.0 is the IP you start with and 
end up manipulating to get the two network IDs. The default subnet mask is 
255.0.0.0 for this network address. I personally recommend writing that 
out on paper as the following:
Octet 1
Octet 2
Octet 3
Octet 4
IP Address
24
0

0
0

Subnet Mask (binary)
11111111
00000000
00000000
00000000
Notice that, right now, the focus is the subnet mask because it is responsible 
for determining the network ID portion of an address. When subnetting, I 
write out all the binary for the subnet mask, as that will become your work 
area to calculate the new network addresses for the four new networks! The 
work area is where you are going to do all of the pen work to calculate the 
addresses in a subnet.
Once you have written out the starting network addresses and have the 
subnet mask in binary, you can then convert two of the left-most host bits to 
network bits by changing the bits from zeros to ones.

When you convert host bits from 0s to 1s, they are known as subnet bits. You 
now have three types of bits in the example above. You have the original 
bits set to 1 (which are known as network ID bits) in the subnet mask, you 
have the host bits (which are set to 0) in the subnet mask, and now you have 
the bits you converted to 1s (known as the subnet bits) in order to subnet.
After stealing two of the host bits for subnet bits, you now have fewer hosts 
available because there are fewer bits assigned to the host ID portion of the 
IP address — but you now have more networks available. At this point, you 
should verify the math and calculate how many subnets are available and 
how many hosts can exist on each subnet. The following formulas are used 
to calculate the number of subnets and number of hosts on each subnet:
 
✦ Number of subnets: To calculate the number of subnets, take 2subnetted 
bits, which in this example is 2; you can calculate the number of subnets 
in the example as 22 = 4 subnets.
 
✦ Number of hosts per subnet: To calculate the number of hosts per 
subnet, the formula is 2<# of bits> – 2. In the example, you can calculate 
the number of hosts per subnet: 222 = 4,194,304 – 2 = 4,194,302 hosts per 
subnet! You subtract 2 from the number of hosts because there are two 
addresses that you cannot use: the network ID for the subnet (all host 
bits set to 0) and the broadcast address for the subnet (all host bits set 
to 1).
 
The CCENT certification exam gives you requirements of how many subnets 
(or networks) are needed and how many hosts per subnet need to be 
supported. With this information, you can use the formulas presented here 
to calculate how many bits are needed as subnet bits in order to answer the 
questions.
Going back to my subnetting example, you have taken two bits away from 
the host ID port and are using them as subnet bits to increase the number 
of subnets that exist on the network. Because you have modified the subnet 
mask, all four subnets in the example have a new subnet mask. I recommend 
calculating the subnet mask next. To calculate your new subnet mask, 
convert the modified subnet mask from binary to decimal, as shown below.

A very popular method of indicating the subnet mask is to use the Classless 
Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. With the CIDR notation, you simply 
place a / (forward slash) and then the number of bits that are enabled in the 
subnet mask. In this example, the CIDR notation for each of the new subnets 
is /10.
I recommend writing the new subnet mask down, as you will need it later 
when you fill in the subnetting table. You are almost done with this subnetting 
example, but before you can say it is complete, you must have the following 
information about each of the four subnets:
 
✦ Network ID: The network ID is calculated by having all host bits for the 
subnet set to 0.
 
✦ First valid address: The first valid address is calculated by having all 
host bits set to 0 except for the host bit on the far-right side — it is 
enabled by setting it to 1. The bit on the far-right side is known as the 
least significant bit because it has the lowest value associated with it.
 
✦ Last valid address: The last valid address is calculated by having all 
host bits enabled (set to 1) except for the lease significant bit (the bit on 
the far-right side) — it takes a value of 0.
 
✦ Broadcast address: The broadcast address is calculated by having all 
host bits set to 1.
 
✦ Subnet mask: The subnet mask is calculated after converting host bits 
to subnet bits. You have this value already; it is 255.192.0.0 in this 
example.
In order to calculate each of these pieces of information for the four subnets, 
you need to calculate all of the possible on/off states that the two subnet 
bits could create. The following is a listing of all the on/off states that the 
two bits can create:
 
✦ 00: Both bits are off.
 
✦ 01: The far-right bit is on, but the left bit is off.
 
✦ 10: The far-right bit is off, but the left bit is on.
 
✦ 11: Both bits are on.

128
Subnetting a Network
Each of these combinations will eventually work out to be the four new 
subnets. (I know that seems weird, but hang in there.) What I would do next 
is write out the original network ID before it is subnetted, and then write 
out your new subnet mask below it in binary. The subnet mask is your work 
area! Next, list the on/off combinations that the two subnet bits create in the 
second octet. After doing that, finally place the host bits in each octet with 
each host bit being off (set to 0).

On paper, you should have a chart like the one here. Notice that I do not 
have anything filled into the first octet for each of the entries. This is 
because you always use the original network ID when subnetting — it is the 
octets after the original value that you manipulate. Just so you do not forget 
that the first octet has a 24 in it, I recommend listing the 24 in each of the 
octets as follows:

Calculating the network IDs
Now it is time to calculate the network IDs — actually, the network IDs for 
each of the networks are pretty much already calculated in the work area. 
To calculate the network ID, set each of the host bits to 0, and then convert 
all the octets to decimal, as shown in the chart that follows.

24.192.0.0
To calculate the value of each octet, use the values associated with each 
bit that you read about in Book I, Chapter 4. For example, the first subnet 
has a first octet of 24 (you do not need to convert that to decimal, as it was 
already in decimal format), and the second octet of the first subnet has a 
binary of 00000000, which is the decimal value of 0. The remaining octets 
in the first subnet equal 0 as well, making the network ID of the first subnet 
24.0.0.0.
Looking at the second subnet, the first octet is again 24, but the second 
octet has a binary value of 01000000, which equals 64 in decimal. The 
remaining octets in the second subnet have a decimal value of 0 because no 
host bits are enabled in those octets. This gives the second subnet a network 
ID of 24.64.0.0.
Looking at the third subnet, the first octet is 24, while the second octet 
has a binary value of 10000000, which has a decimal value of 128. The third 
and fourth octet for the third subnet have a decimal value of 0, as there 
are no bits enabled. This means that the network ID for the third subnet is 
24.128.0.0.
Finally, continue this process with the fourth subnet, which has a first octet 
of 24, while the binary value of the second octet is 11000000, which equals 
192 (128+64). The third and fourth octets have a decimal value of 0, as there 
are no bits enabled. This means that the fourth subnet has a network ID of 
24.192.0.0.
 
Remember for the CCENT exam that the network ID can be determined by 
having all host bits in the host ID portion of the address set to 0.
Calculating the first valid address
Now that you have the network ID for each of the subnets, you can calculate 
the first valid address by enabling the least significant host bit. The following 
chart displays the results of enabling the least significant host bit, and it 
calculates it in the decimal format.

Notice in the chart that the least significant host bit is the one on the 
far-right side. This bit has a decimal value of 1, which makes the first 
valid address of the first subnet 24.0.0.1. The second subnet has a first 
valid address of 24.64.0.1, the third subnet has a first valid address of 
24.128.0.1, and finally, the fourth subnet has a first valid address of 
24.192.0.1.
 
Remember that after manipulating the bits, you always convert each of the 
octets to binary in their entirety. I see many people make the mistake of not 
including the first two bits of the second octet when converting from binary 
to decimal!
Calculating the broadcast address
The next piece of information to calculate for each of the subnets is the 
broadcast address. To calculate the broadcast address, you enable each of 
the host bits by setting them to 1.

The host bits are all the bits past the subnet bits, so I have converted all the 
host bits to 1. Once you convert the host bits, you then convert each of the 
octets to decimals to come up with the broadcast address. Once you have 
the broadcast address calculated for each of the subnets, you can then write 
the subnet addresses down.

Remember for the CCENT exam that the broadcast address can be calculated 
by having all bits in the host ID portion of the address set to 1.
Calculating the last valid address
The final piece of information you need to calculate is the last valid address 
of each subnet. To calculate the last valid address, after calculating the 
broadcast address, simply turn off the least significant bit, as shown in the 
table that follows.

The reason you calculate the first valid address and the last valid address 
is because you can input that information into a DHCP server and have the 
DHCP server give the valid addresses out to clients on the network. You may 
also want to know the valid address ranges if you are manually assigning 
addresses — you do not want to assign an address out of the range because 
it will cause communication errors.
You are done! You have calculated all relevant information for each of the 
four subnets in this example. The following summarizes the values for each 
of the subnets that you have calculated.

With this information, you can now configure the IP addresses on each of 
the devices in the two subnets of Figure 5-1. To see an example of what to do 
with this subnetted information, take a look at Figure 5-3 — notice that I am 
using the first and second subnet, and I will save the third and fourth subnets 
for networks that the company plans to have in the future.

Subnetting a class B network
Now that you have walked through an example of subnetting a class A 
address range, let’s walk through an example of subnetting a class B network 
range.
In this scenario, you have the 131.107.0.0 network range, and it needs to 
be divided into six subnets. Remember that your first step is to decide how 
many bits you need to take from the host ID portion of the subnet mask and 
convert them to subnet bits. Run through the following calculations until 
you reach six subnets:
21 bit = 2 subnets
22 bits = 4 subnets
23 bits = 8 subnets
In this example, you need only six subnets, but you are going to have to take 
three bits because using two bits gives you only four subnets. This means 
you will have two subnets that are unused.
So you need to use three bits! Next, grab a piece of paper and calculate all of 
the subnets and determine each of the pieces of information listed below for 
each subnet:
 
✦ Network ID: The network ID is calculated by having all host bits for the 
subnet set to 0.
 
✦ First valid address: The first valid address is calculated by having all 
host bits set to 0 except for the host bit on the far-right side — it is 
enabled by setting it to 1. The bit on the far-right side is known as the 
least significant bit because it has the lowest value associated with it.

Book I
Chapter 5
Subnetting and 
VLSM
133
Subnetting a Network
 
✦ Last valid address: The last valid address is calculated by having all 
host bits enabled (set to 1) except for the least significant bit (the bit on 
the far-right side) — it takes a value of 0.
 
✦ Broadcast address: The broadcast address is calculated by having all 
host bits set to 1.
 
✦ Subnet mask: The subnet mask is calculated after converting host bits 
to subnet bits.
Before reading any further, try to calculate everything on your own with the 
information you gained from the example in the previous section. Once you 
have calculated everything — or if you get stuck — read on to see the steps I 
would take to complete this example.
The first thing to do is to write down the original IP address and the subnet 
mask in binary. Remember that the subnet mask in binary is your work area. 
After writing out the subnet mask in binary, convert the first three host bits 
from the left side to subnet bits by setting them to 1.

Notice that in this example we are working in the third octet because that is 
where the host ID portion starts. When you convert the first three host bits 
to subnet bits, you get the new subnet mask for all eight subnets right off the 
bat. The new subnet mask is 255.255.224.0.
After that, list all the possible on/off states that three bits could make. Each 
of these combinations represents one of the subnets of the eight subnets. 
The following are the on/off states of three bits:
000
001
010
011
100
101
110
111
Next, list the on/off states below your new subnet mask in the work area, as 
shown in the chart below:

Once you list all the combinations that three bits make (there are eight of 
them), list the remaining host bits — the five remaining host bits in the third 
octet and the eight in the fourth octet (as shown in the chart).
I recommend doing two other things to the table before moving on. The first 
two octets still use the original IP range of 131.107, so I would fill that into 
the table so you do not forget that every calculation starts with 131.107. 
Second, I would add a column to the right, showing the decimal value of 
whatever we are calculating. (See the chart.)

We can now start calculating all the information required for each subnet, starting 
with the network ID. Remember that the network ID is all host bits set to 0 (which 
is actually what you get when you fill out all the host bits with zeros in the chart). 
The following shows the network IDs in decimal format for each of the subnets —

Once you have calculated the broadcast address for each subnet, you can 
then move on to calculate the last valid address. The last valid address is 
calculated by having all host bits set to 1 except for the least significant bit — 
it needs to be turned off by setting it to 0. Remember the least significant bit 
is the one on the far-right side.

You now have calculated all relevant information for each of the subnets, so 
the next thing I recommend doing is filling out a final chart — if your work 
area looks anything like mine, it is now messy from all the changes! The

Subnetting a class C network
Now let’s do one more example, subnetting a class C address. Most people 
find subnetting a class C address hard because you do not see a lot of the 
same numbers you see when subnetting class A and class B addresses. 
For example, with class A and class B addresses, the broadcast addresses 
end with 255. Bottom line is if you are calculating everything in binary you 
cannot go wrong.
For the class C example, we need to have the 216.83.11.0 network divided 
into four networks. In order to subnet the 216.83.11.0 network into four 
networks, how many bits do we need to steal from the host ID portion of the 
subnet mask? I hope you came up with the answer of two bits (22 = 4 subnets)!
So the first step is to write out the original network ID and the subnet mask 
in binary. Then, take two of the host bits in the subnet mask (starting on the 
left side) and convert them to subnet bits by changing them to a 1.

Now when you convert the subnet mask to decimal, the new subnet mask 
is 255.255.255.192. This allows you to have 4 subnets (22 = 4) with each 
subnet supporting 26 host bits = 64 – 2 illegal addresses (the network ID and 
broadcast address) = 62 hosts.
After stealing the two bits, you can list all the on/off states that two bits 
create. You should have the following on/off bit combinations with two bits:
00
01
10
11
After filling out all of the combinations that two bits create and listing them 
in the chart, I would then fill in the other six bits that are host bits with 0s. 
You should have something like the following:

So that you don’t forget that you are working in the fourth octet, I recommend 
filling in the first three octets of each subnet with the beginning network ID 
that you are subnetting — the 216.83.11.0 network.

With each of the six host bits set to 0 (you know they are host bits by looking 
at the subnet mask) in the fourth octet, you have now calculated the first 
piece of information — the network ID of each subnet. Notice in the chart 
that follows that the network ID for the first subnet is 216.83.11.0, the 
second subnet is 216.83.11.64, the third network ID is 216.83.11.128, 
and finally the fourth network ID is 216.83.11.192. These are strange-looking 
network IDs, but they are correct, as the host bits are all set to 0 — the rule 
to calculating the network ID.

After calculating the network ID, you are ready to calculate the first valid 
address. To calculate the first valid address, you simply enable the least 
significant host bit on the right side. The following chart shows the first 
valid address of each of those subnets.

Now that you know how to subnet a class A, class B, and class C address the 
long way, it is time to show you a shortcut.
 
Keep in mind that I am not a fan of using shortcuts, as I find people never 
understand the theory behind the actual numbers that way. It is important 
to know the binary.
Subnetting the quick way
From an exam point of view, you may not have the time to write out all the 
binary the way that I show you in the example scenarios in this chapter. 
It is very important to practice the binary calculations with a mix of class 
A, class B, and class C addresses. Once you have that down, look to speed 
things up with some shortcuts!
There are many shortcuts you can use to perform subnetting. When you 
look back at each of the examples you did earlier in this chapter, I want you 
to notice that the network IDs always increment by the same values in each 
example. For example, the class C network range you just finished subnetting 
has the following network IDs:
216.83.11.0
216.83.11.64
216.83.11.128
216.83.11.192
Notice that each of the values increment by 64. I am going to show you how 
you can fill out the subnetting details by using the “increment” shortcut!

142
Subnetting a Network
The first thing to do when subnetting using the increment shortcut method 
is determine how many bits to subtract from the host ID portion of the 
subnet mask in order to create the desired number of subnets. I use the 
same example I used for the class C address scenario in the previous section 
and say that we want to subnet the 216.83.11.0 network into four subnets. 
This requires two bits to be converted from host bits to subnet bits:

11000000
Before we go any further, make note that your new subnet mask is 
255.255.255.192.
Now look at the value of the last bit that you stole from the host bits (from 
left to right), and then look at the value of that bit. In this example, the last 
bit from left to right that was enabled as a subnet bit has a value of 64. This 
becomes your increment value! You are home free now because you simply 
create the list of network IDs, starting with the original network ID and then 
incrementing by 64 for each one. In this case, the network IDs are
216.83.11.0
216.83.11.64
216.83.11.128
216.83.11.192
Once you have the network IDs, you can then fill in the first valid address of 
each subnet because it is one more than the network ID. The following chart 
has the first valid address filled in.

216.83.11.193
255.255.255.192
You now need to calculate the broadcast address of each subnet. This is a 
little trickier, as the broadcast address is one address less the next network 
ID. For example, the second subnet has a network ID of 216.83.11.64, 
so the previous subnet should have a broadcast address one number less, 
which is 216.83.11.63. The following chart shows the broadcast address 
filled in for each subnet — notice they are one less than the next subnet’s 
network ID.

255.255.255.192
The only issue with calculating the broadcast address this way arises when 
you get to the last broadcast address — how do you know what it should 
be? The last broadcast address will be whatever the normal network broadcast 
address was before you subnetted (all host bits set to 1).
To fill in the last valid address, simply take one number minus the broadcast 
address, and you have the last valid address for that subnet. The chart now 
looks like the following:
Network ID

Because of the CCENT exam’s time limit, you need to be able to use the 
increment shortcut method to figure out your IP address for each subnet — 
be sure to practice it a lot before taking the exam. It is really easy to make 
a mistake using the shortcut method, and because each number is based 
on you figuring out the previous number, making one mistake can throw all 
your answers off.
IP Subnet Zero
The last topic I want to mention before moving on to variable-length subnet 
masks is the IP Subnet Zero feature. In the past, a number of different 
devices could not use the first and last subnet that was calculated. For 
example, in the previous class C example, you would not be allowed to use 
subnet #1 and subnet #4. This meant that if you actually had to have four 
subnets, then you would need to accommodate for that in your calculation and 
ensure you calculated at least six subnets (which actually meant you needed 
to calculate eight subnets).
The reason for not supporting the first and last subnets is that the older routing 
protocols did not send subnet mask information along with the route, so 
the receiving router would have no way of knowing if the first subnet of 
216.83.11.0 is intended as the entire network or a subnetted network.

144
Understanding Variable-Length Subnet Masks
The ip subnet-zero command is used to configure your Cisco router to 
use the first and last subnets and is a default command as of Cisco IOS 12.0 
and greater. (I tell you about Cisco IOS in Book II, Chapter 1.) If the command 
on the router was no ip subnet-zero, you would not be able to use the 
first and last subnet.
 
If a question on the CCENT certification exam asks you to subnet and implies 
that the no ip subnet-zero is set, you will have to subtract the first and 
last subnets from your results. If no ip subnet-zero is not mentioned at 
all, your routers support the first and last subnets.
Understanding Variable-Length Subnet Masks
One of the problems with the subnetting examples in this chapter is that 
each subnet has the same subnet mask and supports the same number of 
hosts on the network. Realistically, you may require a different number of 
hosts on each network. For example, looking at Figure 5-4, you see a network 
with two routers (NY-R1 and BOS-R1) connected to the WAN link via the 
serial ports (labeled S0/0). The two routers create three different networks 
that I call networks A, B, and C.

Notice that Network A requires only 20 hosts (or addresses), Network B 
requires only two hosts (one address for each serial port on the WAN link), 
and Network C requires 25 hosts.

Understanding Variable-Length Subnet Masks
Let’s assume that we have a class C range such as 216.83.11.0. If you 
subnet this network the normal way, you would be required to create four 
subnets by borrowing two bits from the host ID portion of the subnet mask. 
This would allow each network to have 26 host bits = 64 – 2 illegal addresses = 
62 hosts for each subnet. This is a waste of addresses on the WAN link. Also 
note that you may require more than 62 addresses on one of the subnets — 
so what can you do? Variable-length subnet masks (VLSM) allows you to make 
better use of your address space by supporting subnets of different sizes. 
This is possible by allowing you to have different subnet masks for each 
subnet, which gives you the flexibility to use only two addresses on the WAN 
link and keep more addresses available for the other networks.
 
The CCENT certification exam does not test you on VLSM, so I give you only 
an overview here. I do believe it is important for you to be familiar with the 
concepts. One of the main reasons I want to make sure you are familiar with 
VLSM is because when considering different routing protocols, some of the 
protocols support VLSM and some do not.
 
You find out more about routing protocols in Book III, Chapter 2, but for 
now, you need to know that RIPv1 and IGRP do not support VLSM, while 
RIPv2, EIGRP, and OSPF do support VLSM.
I want to give you a quick walk-through on a shortcut method you can 
use to implement variable-length subnet masks. I use the class C address 
216.83.11.0 and calculate the variable-length subnet masks for each 
subnet on the network.
The first thing to expose you to is a summary table of different calculations 
(see Figure 5-5). The benefit of using a table like this is that you only have 
to do the math once — when you actually create the table. Once the table is 
created there is no math involved — you simply reference the table!

Understanding Variable-Length Subnet Masks
Let’s review what I did in Figure 5-5. The first column displays the number 
of desired hosts on the network. For example, I said that Network A needs 
20 hosts. Looking at the table, you have to accept the fact that you have 
30 supported hosts on the network as the closest match to the 20-host 
requirement.
Once you identify that you are going to support 30 hosts, the next column 
(Subnet Size) shows the actual size of the subnet. In this case, the size is 32. 
The reason you have 30 hosts (or addresses) available to you but the actual 
subnet supports 32 is because there are two addresses in the range that you 
are not allowed to use — the network ID and the broadcast address. The 
subnet size is also referred to as the block size — the block of addresses 
assigned to that subnet.
The next column shows the CIDR notation for the subnet mask you will use 
to attain that number of hosts. In the example of 30 hosts, the CIDR notation 
is /27, meaning that you have taken three bits from the host ID portion of 
the class C subnet mask. (Remember, there are 24 bits in a class C subnet 
mask already being used for network ID.) This means that there are 5 host 
bits remaining, so if you use the formula 25 host bits = 32, you can verify that the 
block size is correct.
The final column (Subnet Mask) displays what that subnet mask is in decimal 
for the fourth octet of this class range. For example, the decimal format for 
the 30 hosts supported subnet is 255.255.255.224.
The next thing you want to do is create a plotting area for your different 
subnets to ensure you do not use more addresses than an actual class C 
address range provides. Figure 5-6 displays a scale you can use to plot these 
different subnets.
Now, plot Network A in the plotting area. In order to select a range of 
addresses, you take the subnet size for that network. Remember that 
Network A has a subnet size of 32, so you take 32 addresses in the plotting 
area. The hook is you cannot take just any 32 addresses — the range has 
to start on an address that falls into the increment of your subnet size. For 
example, the subnet size (or block size) for Network A is 32, so you can start 
that network block on 0, 32, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192, or 224. If the block size was 
16, that would be your increment on starting values — with a block size of 
16, you could start on 0, 16, 32, 48, 64, and so on.
So for Network A, take the 32-address block that starts with address 32 
and goes to 63, and plot that in the plotting area so that you know those 
addresses are used up. (See Figure 5-7.) Do not forget that the subnet mask 
that gave you that address block is 255.255.255.224, or /27 in CIDR.

Now, plot Network C. Looking back at the network diagram (refer to Figure 
5-4), Network C requires 25 hosts, so it, too, will use a 32-address block. 
Remember that you have to start network C on increments of 32, so I start 
on address 64 and go to 95. (See Figure 5-8.)

Understanding Variable-Length Subnet Masks
Finally, plot Network B, which requires only two addresses, but you need 
to accommodate for the network ID and the broadcast as well. So it is actually 
a subnet size of 4 — 4 is the increment, so you can start this network on 
addresses 0, 4, 8, 12, and so on. I plot Network B right after Network C using 
the 216.83.11.96 address block. (See Figure 5-9.)

Subnetting and 
VLSM
151
Lab Exercises
The benefit of VLSM is that it allows you to create a network design that 
makes better use of address space. Keep in mind that I do not expect you to 
receive any VLSM questions on the CCENT certification exam, as it is more 
of a CCNA topic, but you should know what VLSM is.
Chapter Summary
This chapter illustrates the concepts related to subnetting and the need 
for variable-length subnet masks. This chapter is critical to you passing the 
CCENT certification exam, so be sure to review it many times and practice 
different subnetting examples. Remember the following key points about 
subnetting:
 
✦ You need to subnet so you can configure the logical address to match 
the physical network structure.
 
✦ CIDR notation is a method of specifying the subnet mask. For example, 
192.168.2.0/24 indicates that this is a class C network.
 
✦ The network ID is calculated by having all host bits set to 0.
 
✦ The broadcast address is calculated by having all host bits set to 1.
 
✦ In order to calculate the number of hosts that are supported on the 
subnet, the calculation is 2# of host bits – 2.
 
✦ In order to determine how many subnets are supported, use the formula 
2# of subnetted bits.
 
✦ In order to support different-size networks, you implement variable-length 
subnet masks (VLSM), which allow each network to have a different 
subnet mask and support a different number of hosts.
 
✦ Most Cisco devices have the ip subnet-zero command, which allows 
you to use the first and last subnets that are calculated when subnetting.
Lab Exercises
This chapter introduces you to the concepts of subnetting a network to 
ensure that the logical address scheme corresponds to the physical network 
structures. The following labs help you practice those concepts.

Subnetting and VLSM

Answers
 1 B. In order to calculate the broadcast address of a subnet, you set all host bits to 
1 and then convert to decimal. See “Subnetting a class A network.”
 2 D. The second subnet is the 192.168.2.64 subnet, with the third valid address 
being 192.168.2.67. Remember that the first address (64) is the network ID, so 
the first valid address is 65, then 66, and the third valid address is 67. Review 
“Subnetting a class C network.”
 3 A. The 24.60.32.20/11 address is located in the 24.32.0.0 network range. A 
quick way to figure these questions out is to look at the /11 and ask yourself 
what is the increment value supplied by the last bit used to subnet — it is 32! 
This means that the network IDs increment by 32, starting with 24.0.0.0, then 
24.32.0.0, and then 24.64.0.0. In this question, the address 24.60.32.20 is 
less than 24.64.0.0, so it must be on the 24.32.0.0 network. Check out 
“Subnetting a class A network.”
 4 C. To create six new subnets, you need to actually create eight subnets by bor-
rowing three bits from the host ID portion of the subnet mask and converting 
them to subnet bits. Peruse “Subnetting a class A network.”
 5 A. The network ID for a subnet can be calculated by having all host bits set to 0 
and then converting to decimal. Take a look at “Subnetting a class A network.”
 6 D. 220.55.66.64 is the network ID of the third subnet. A quick way to figure 
this out is to determine the increment value of the last bit used to subnet — in 
this example, it is 32, so the increments are 0, 32, 64, 96, and so on. The third 
network ID is 64, so you simply add that to 220.55.66.0 to get 220.55.66.64. 
Peek at “Subnetting a class C network.”
 7 B. The last valid address of the 64 subnet in this example is 94. An easy way to 
figure this out is the next network ID would have 96 as a value and the number 
before that would be the broadcast address (95), which leaves the last valid 
address to be 94. Look over “Subnetting a class A network.”
 8 C. The variable-length subnet masks feature allows you to use different subnet 
masks for different subnets within your organization. Study “Understanding 
Variable-Length Subnet Masks.”
 9 B. The ip subnet-zero command is a default command on today’s Cisco rout-
ers, which allows you to use the first and last subnets when subnetting. Refer to 
“IP Subnet Zero.”
 10 D. Because you need to borrow three bits from the third octet in order to have 
each subnet support 8,190 hosts, the new subnet mask is 255.255.224.0. 
Examine “Subnetting a class B network.”

he previous minibook exposes you to a number of networking concepts, 
such as network devices and services, the OSI model, the TCP/IP 
Internet model, IP addressing, and subnetting. Now that you have the basics 
of networking down, you can focus on the specifics of Cisco devices such as 
routers and switches.
This chapter is designed to introduce you to those Cisco devices by 
discussing the operating system that resides on them, the different types 
of ports and memory, and some fundamental concepts, including the 
important discussion of configuration modes. All of these topics are extremely 
important basics that you must be familiar with before you take a look at 
how to configure the devices in the next chapter.

Introducing the Cisco IOS
162
Introducing the Cisco IOS
Cisco devices run an operating system known as the Internetwork Operating 
System (IOS). The IOS is responsible for the features of Cisco devices such 
as routing, switching, and even security features. It enables you to interact 
with a Cisco device by exposing a number of commands to you that you can 
use in the command-line interface (CLI). The IOS is responsible for offering 
the feature set on the device — features that are different from one IOS 
version to another.
One of the most important points to understand regarding how to manage 
a Cisco device is that different IOS versions have different features available. 
For example, a Cisco router IOS prior to version 11.3 does not have the 
Network Address Translation (NAT) feature. Cisco IOS versions above 11.3 
have the Network Address Translation feature. When troubleshooting why 
a command is not working on your Cisco device, one thing to verify is that 
you have a version of the IOS that the command you are trying to use works on.
In the classroom, two things that I stress to students who are new to Cisco 
devices is (1) get familiar with the different ports and connectors so that 
you have an idea of what needs to be configured on the device, and (2) 
know how to use the help system within the Cisco IOS. If you can get 
comfortable with the help system and you know your way around the IOS, 
you can figure out how to manage any Cisco device — even if the model is 
new to you!
Identifying Ports on the Cisco Device
There are so many different models of Cisco routers and switches that the 
most important thing to understand when working with these devices is 
there are a number of different configuration settings, such as configuring 
ports, that are consistent with each model Cisco device. One of the consistent 
features of all Cisco devices is configuring the different ports.
This section is designed to inform you of the different ports — console, 
auxiliary, Ethernet, and serial — and it can help you understand what each 
port is used for. You also discover the different unique port IDs that are 
assigned to each port and how to work with the different ports.
Cisco router ports
There are a number of different types of ports that can appear on your 
Cisco routers. Let’s start by taking a look at some older routers and then 
work our way into some newer routers. Figure 1-1 displays a Cisco 2501 
router and the different ports that exist on it.

router.
 
Serial ports

Console port
Looking at Figure 1-1, you can see a console port on the back of the Cisco 
router. The console port allows you to connect to and administer the router 
and change its configuration. You connect your workstation to the console 
port with a console cable (also known as a rollover cable).
Connecting to the console port on the router to change the settings on the 
device is called connecting locally to the router because you have to be 
physically with the router in order to make the connection. The opposite of 
connecting locally is to connect remotely — meaning you connect across the 
network or Internet using TCP/IP to manage the device. An example of con-
necting remotely to the router is when you Telnet into the router to make 
configuration changes to the router. You find out how to Telnet into the 
router in Book II, Chapter 3.
When connecting locally to the router, the console cable typically connects 
from your computer’s serial port to the console port on the Cisco device, as 
shown in Figure 1-2.
All port types are referenced by a unique ID that is made up of the type of 
port and an index number specifying which port of that type you are 
referencing. For example, the console port is referenced as console 0, or con 
0 for short, because it is the first (and only) console port on the router.
Auxiliary port
The auxiliary port is used exactly as a console port in the sense that you 
connect locally to the auxiliary port using a console cable. The original 
reason the auxiliary port was created was so you could connect a modem 
to the auxiliary port (see Figure 1-3) and then dial into the modem from a 
remote location to perform your administration. This meant that you did not 
have to be physically in front of the router to do your administration.

Because most networks are connected to the Internet, today’s network 
administrators do not use the auxiliary port as much — normally they 
remotely administer the Cisco device by Telneting into the router or using a 
secure connection such as SSH.
The auxiliary port is referenced with an ID of auxiliary 0, or aux 0 for short.

Identifying Ports on the Cisco Device
Cisco Ethernet ports
Most routers today have multiple Ethernet (10 Mbps), Fast Ethernet (100 
Mbps), or even Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbps) ports on them. For example, 
the Cisco 2501 router has only one Ethernet port (labeled AUI) and it uses 
the Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) port instead of a typical RJ-45 port. The 
benefit of the AUI port is that you can connect a transceiver (shown in 
Figure 1-4) to the AUI port; on the other end of the transceiver, there may 
be different types of connectors that allow different types of cabling to be 
used to connect to the Ethernet port. The AUI port provides a way to attach 
a transceiver that may have any of the many different cable types that can 
connect to the transceiver.
 
Figure 1-4: 
A 
transceiver 
connects to 
the AUI port 
on the Cisco 
router.
 
 
Most newer routers today have the Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, and Gigabit 
Ethernet ports using an RJ-45 port (see Figure 1-5) or even fiber connectors, 
so it is unlikely that you will see an AUI connector if you are dealing with 
newer hardware.

166
Identifying Ports on the Cisco Device
 
Figure 1-5: 
Newer 
routers use 
RJ-45 ports.
 
RJ-45 ports
When you configure aspects of the network interfaces, you must reference 
the different types of Ethernet interfaces by their IDs. Table 1-1 lists the IDs 
used by the different types of Ethernet interfaces.
Table 1-1 
Network Interface IDs
Port Type
Example ID
Ethernet (10 Mbps)
Ethernet0 or Ethernet1
Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps)
FastEthernet0/0 or FastEthernet0/1
Gigabit Ethernet (1000 
Mbps)
GigabitEthernet0/0 or GigabitEthernet0/1
10 Gigabit (10 Gbps)
TenGigabitEthernet0/0 or TenGigabitEthernet0/1
Looking at Table 1-1, you see that the Ethernet ports are referenced by 
Ethernet0 or Ethernet1. The 0 and the 1 are the port numbers on the Cisco 
device, with the first port starting at index 0, the second port being index 1, 
and so on.
The Fast Ethernet ports are identified a little bit differently. With Fast 
Ethernet ports, the port identifier starts with the word FastEthernet, but 
then there are two numbers that follow (instead of the one number used 
with Ethernet). The two numbers that follow the words FastEthernet use the 
syntax of slot/port. Ports are added to Cisco devices by placing cards, or 
modules, into slots — so a single slot can have multiple ports on it. Looking 
at Figure 1-6, you see a Cisco device with three slots; each slot has a module

Identifying Ports on the Cisco Device
placed in it, and each module has multiple ports. To reference the fourth 
Fast Ethernet port on the first module, the ID of that port is FastEthernet1/4 
(or you can abbreviate it as fa1/4 or even f1/4).

diagram 
displaying 
how to 
reference 
Fast 
Ethernet 
ports by 
their IDs.
 
Slot 1
FastEthernet1/4
Slot 2
Slot 3
 
Sometimes the index numbers of ports start with 0, and sometimes they 
start with 1. For example, my Cisco 2811 router has two Fast Ethernet 
interfaces, with the first interface being FastEthernet0/0 and the second 
being FastEthernet0/1. But on my Cisco 2950 switch, the first Fast Ethernet 
port has an ID of FastEthernet0/1. If you are unsure of the port ID, take a look 
at the device because a lot of times the ports are labeled. (Refer to Figure 1-5, 
and you see the two ports labeled as FE0/0 and FE0/1).
Serial ports
Looking back at Figure 1-1, you see two serial ports labeled Serial 0 and 
Serial 1. Serial ports are typically used to connect your Cisco router to your 
WAN environment; they can also be used to create a direct point-to-point 
link between two routers. A point-to-point link means that you connect one 
router directly to another router using a special cable known as a back-to-
back serial cable.
I talk more about WANs in Book IV, Chapter 4, but I want to give you a quick 
rundown on how routers are typically connected in a WAN environment. 
Remember that a WAN is created when you connect multiple offices, such as 
when you connect your office in New York to your office in Toronto.
In order to create the connection between two offices that are seperated 
over distance, you subscribe to a monthly service from your telco, or service 
provider, that provides the physical links between the two office locations. 
All you need to do is get a connection to the service provider’s network 
infrastructure, which is what the serial port is typically used for.

168
Identifying Ports on the Cisco Device
The serial port on your router connects to an external WAN device, such as 
a Channel Service Unit/Data Service Unit (CSU/DSU), that offers a T1 or T3 
connection to the service provider (more on T1 and T3 in the WAN chapter; 
Book IV, Chapter 4). Once you connect the serial port on the router to the 
CSU/DSU, you then take the line that the service provider installed (typically 
in your wiring closet) and plug it into the CSU/DSU. (See Figure 1-7.)

In Figure 1-7, your router in Toronto is connected to the WAN (the service 
provider’s network) via serial port Serial0/0 (S0/0). This serial port is connected 
to the external CSU/DSU device, which is then connected to your service 
provider’s network — typically into what is called a WAN switch. Your office 
in New York has the same setup, but it may be connected to a different part 
of the service provider’s network.
The reason I stress the term external CSU/DSU device is that it is possible 
to install a CSU/DSU module into an available slot in your router so you 
can connect the line from your service provider directly into the port on 
the router — this is known as an internal CSU/DSU device. (It is integrated 
into the router.) Figure 1-8 displays an integrated CSU/DSU on a Cisco 2811 
router.

Internal CSU/DSU port
Looking at Figure 1-8 you see that the CSU/DSU port has been added to the 
router as a Wan Interface Card (WIC) module (notice the screws on either 
side of the port. Cisco has started to use WICs as a method to add any type 
of port by inserting a card, or module, to the newer routers. WICs are not 
only used for WAN ports, they are used to add many other types of ports — 
you can see in Figure 1-8 that the Fast Ethernet ports below the CSU/DSU are 
a module that was added. The use of WICs has added greater flexibility in 
what types of ports can exist in your routers over the older fixed port routers.
Identifying 1604 router ports
A number of other ports can exist on a Cisco router, or can be added by 
inserting a module into one of the available slots in the router. Looking at 
Figure 1-9, you see an older Cisco 1604 router that has the following ports:

Identifying Ports on the Cisco Device
 
✦ Ethernet0: One of the reasons I want to show you this older router is so 
you can see the two Ethernet ports on the left side of the router. One of 
the Ethernet ports is an RJ-45 port, and the other is an AUI connector. 
The hook with this router is both ports are known as Ethernet0, and you 
are allowed to use only one of them at a time. The benefit is that instead 
of having to purchase a transceiver to connect UTP cable to the router, 
you can use the built-in RJ-45 port that is supplied.
 
✦ ISDN ports: ISDN is another example of a WAN technology that you can 
use to connect to a remote office. I discuss ISDN as a WAN technology in 
Book IV, Chapter 4, but I want you to notice in the figure that this router 
has some ISDN ports built in.
 
✦ Console port: You connect your computer to the local console port so 
you can administer the router.
 
✦ Flash memory: This router has flash memory installed via a flash card 
that can be removed and replaced at any time. The flash memory stores 
the IOS.
 
✦ Integrated CSU/DSU: Notice that this router has an integrated CSU/DSU 
that you can use to connect the router to a WAN link such as a T1 link.
Identifying 2811 router ports
Cisco 1604 is an older router, so you will not be tested on it for the CCENT 
certification exam — I show it to you because I want you to see some different 
variations of ports that appear on Cisco devices. Figure 1-10 displays a Cisco 
2811 router and identifies the ports on the router.
Figure 1-10 displays two images; the top image shows ports on the front of 
the router, and the bottom image displays ports on the back of the router.
The front of the router has a flash card, which stores the IOS. The front also 
includes the console port and the auxiliary port to connect to the router and 
make changes to the configuration. Notice that the front of the router also 
has USB ports (for security and storage purposes) that can be referenced 
with the USB0 or USB1 IDs.
The back of the 2811 router has two Fast Ethernet ports for connecting to 
Ethernet networks, and an integrated CSU/DSU to connect a T1 line to the 
router. You will notice in this router that a number of switch ports (Fast 
Ethernet) also exist for you to connect systems to the network. This device 
is acting as a multifunctional device — a router and a switch.
Cisco switch ports
Ports on a Cisco switch are referenced in the same way that ports on a 
router are referenced. The difference is the number of ports that exist on 
a device. A Cisco router connects networks and, as a result, has only a few

interfaces (maybe a few serial and a few Fast Ethernet interfaces), but a 
switch is designed to allow systems to connect to the network and, as a 
result, has more ports available. Switches do not have an auxiliary port; 
auxiliary ports are present only on routers.

Ways to Configure the Cisco Device
Ethernet ports
Switches normally have a number of Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, or Gigabit 
Ethernet ports on the switch. (See Figure 1-11.) Most switches have 12, 24, 
or even 48 ports that are used to connect systems to the network. When 
configuring the switch and applying settings to these ports, you reference 
the ports by the slot/port syntax discussed in the “Cisco Ethernet ports” 
section earlier in the chapter. For example, to reference the third Fast 
Ethernet port in slot 1, use FastEthernet1/3 to refer to it.

Ways to Configure the Cisco Device
There are a number of different ways that you can configure the Cisco 
device — you can use the command-line interface (CLI), Security Device 
Manager (SDM), or a graphical program such as Cisco Network Assistant 
(CNA), which you can download from Cisco’s Web site.
Using the CLI
The command-line interface (CLI) is the main method for configuring a 
Cisco device because all Cisco devices (at least all Cisco devices I know of) 
support you connecting to the console port and using HyperTerminal (or 
connecting remotely using Telnet or SSH) to connect to the command-line 
interface of the device. When you are in the CLI, you can then issue any 
number of commands to administer the device. The following sample code is 
an example of how to use the CLI to change the name of the router.
R1>enable
R1#config term
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
R1(config)#hostname NY-R1
NY-R1(config)#
Most people who are new to the Cisco world find the CLI frustrating to use, 
but it is a very intuitive interface once you get used to it.

Book II
Chapter 1
Introduction to 
the Cisco IOS
173
Ways to Configure the Cisco Device
 
The CCENT certification exam tests your knowledge of the CLI exclusively, 
so you need to be comfortable with this method of configuring the Cisco 
device. As you progress through the chapters of this book you will find out 
how to perform many tasks in the CLI.
Locally
You can use the CLI to configure a switch or router locally. This means that 
you are physically in the same room with the router or switch and you 
connect your computer to the console port or auxiliary port on the device. 
This is known as locally connecting to the device. Once you are connected, 
you can then use the different CLI commands to manage the device.
Remotely
You can also use the CLI by connecting to the router or switch remotely 
using an application such as Telnet or SSH, which allows you to connect 
to the router via its IP address. When you’re connected, the command-line 
interface is presented to you, and then you can issue the same configuration 
commands you would if you were locally connected to the device.
C:\>telnet 24.0.0.1
Trying 24.0.0.1 ...
User Access Verification
Password: 
NY-R1>enable
Password: 
NY-R1#
Notice in the sample code that after Telneting into the device from my 
computer, I am then placed in the CLI of the router — so I can then administer 
the device.
Security Device Manager (SDM)
Over the years, there have been graphical tools created to help you manage 
your Cisco devices. One of the popular graphical tools you can use is 
Security Device Manager, or SDM, which is a piece of software installed on 
newer Cisco device models by default, but you can install it on other devices 
if needed.
SDM is a Java application that offers a graphical interface that connects to 
the router’s IP address through a browser. Once you have connected to the 
router, the SDM appears, offering you configuration options to modify the 
settings on the Cisco device. (See Figure 1-12.)

Ways to Configure the Cisco Device

The following is a description of some of the buttons available at the top of 
the main screen of SDM:
 
✦ Home: Displays the status of the Cisco router and includes information 
such as what features have been configured on your Cisco device.
 
✦ Configure: Lets you configure a number of settings on your Cisco 
device, such as the settings for interfaces, NAT, routing protocols, and 
DHCP, to name a few.
 
✦ Monitor: Displays statistics on your router, such as CPU usage, memory 
usage, and the status of the different network interfaces.
 
If you are running the Cisco IOS 12.4 and would like to use SDM to configure 
your router, you can download it from the Cisco Web site at www.cisco.
com/pcgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/sdm. If you do not have a router to run 
SDM, on you can download a demo router to use the SDM feature with at 
www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/tablebuild.pl/sdm-tool-demo. There are 
instructions with the download on how to set up the demo.

Ways to Configure the Cisco Device
Cisco Network Assistant
Cisco Network Assistant (CNA) is another free application that you can 
download and install from the Cisco Web site (www.cisco.com/go/cna). It 
allows you to manage devices such as routers and switches using a graphical 
interface. 
Cisco Network Assistant (see Figure 1-13) has been around longer than SDM, 
and you will find that you may be able to use it on devices that you cannot 
install the SDM software on. CNA can be used to manage a wealth of different 
features, including port configuration and VLANs on a switch.
 
Figure 1-13:

Because the CCENT certification exam tests your knowledge of the CLI and 
not SDM or CNA, this book focuses on the commands within the CLI you 
need to know to configure a Cisco router and switch. You need to be familiar 
with SDM when you take your CCNA exam — not the CCENT certification 
exam.

176
Identifying Types of Memory
Identifying Types of Memory
The first really important aspect of Cisco devices to understand is that there 
are different types of memory — including ROM, flash, VRAM, and NVRAM — 
installed on the Cisco device. Each type of memory has a specific purpose, 
and you will be tested on these memory types on your CCENT certification 
exam.
ROM
The first type of memory to discuss is the read-only memory (ROM) that is 
stored on the Cisco device. ROM on a Cisco device takes the role of ROM 
on a computer — it contains the low-level code that is responsible for the 
startup operations of the device. Startup operations is a general term for 
what happens when you boot, or power-on, the device.
ROM stores important components that are critical to the startup of the 
Cisco device. The following list outlines components that are stored in ROM:
 
✦ POST: The Power-On Self-Test (POST) is a set of routines located in ROM 
that are executed on startup to verify the hardware in the Cisco device.
 
✦ Bootstrap: The bootstrap program, also known as the boot loader 
program, is also located in ROM and is executed after the POST. The 
purpose of the bootstrap program is to locate the IOS in flash memory 
and then load it into memory.
 
✦ RX-boot: A mini-IOS located in ROM that you can use if you have no IOS 
in flash memory. This mini-IOS is limited in functionality and is normally 
used to enable an interface so that an IOS can be downloaded from a 
TFTP server on the network.
 
✦ ROM Monitor: The ROM Monitor (ROMMON) troubleshoots configuration 
issues with the Cisco device. For example, if you forget the password on 
your Cisco device, you can boot to ROMMON to bypass the password 
request. You can access ROMMON by using a Ctrl-Break keystroke while 
the Cisco device is booting.
Flash memory
Flash memory on a Cisco device is used to store the Cisco IOS. The reason 
Cisco stores the IOS in flash memory and not in ROM is because the IOS is 
upgraded from time to time — if the IOS were stored in ROM memory, you 
would not be able to write to it.
You can install flash memory on the actual system board in the Cisco device 
or by inserting a flash memory card, as shown in Figure 1-14.

the Cisco IOS

Volatile RAM (VRAM)
Volatile RAM (VRAM), also known as just RAM, is a type of memory that 
loses its information when power is lost or the device is turned off. VRAM 
stores what is known as the running configuration, which is the current setup 
of the device. For example, if you were to start your router and then change 
the name of the router, the new name is stored in VRAM. If you were to shut 
down the Cisco device, you would lose the new name you applied because 
the contents of VRAM are erased when the system is powered off. (That is 
why they call it volatile.)
In order for you to store the configuration permanently, you need to copy 
the running configuration to nonvolatile RAM (see the next section for more 
about nonvolatile RAM) before turning off the device so that the information 
is retained.
A number of additional items are stored in memory along with the running 
configuration. VRAM stores items such as your ARP cache, routing table (if 
your device is a router), and MAC address table (if your device is a switch).

178
Powering On Your Cisco Device
Nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM)
Nonvolatile RAM, also known as NVRAM, stores information permanently, 
even when the device is powered off. When you are a Cisco administrator, 
you will need to get used to copying your running configuration (which is 
stored in VRAM) to more permanent storage — NVRAM — in order to maintain 
your change when the device is shut down. The configuration that is stored 
in NVRAM is known as the startup configuration and is applied to your 
device each time it starts up. To copy the changes you make in VRAM 
(running-config) to NVRAM (startup-config), use the copy running-config 
startup-config command. You read more about making changes to your 
Cisco device in the next chapter.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, know that the running configuration is 
stored in VRAM, while the startup configuration is stored in nonvolatile RAM.
Powering On Your Cisco Device
Now that you are familiar with the different types of memory on the Cisco 
device (if you are not familiar with them, read the previous section before 
continuing), you are now ready to find out what occurs when you boot a 
Cisco router or switch.
This section introduces you to the Cisco boot process and the events that 
occur during the boot process. This section also discusses the initial 
configuration dialog — a wizard that appears on your screen the first time 
you power on your Cisco device or anytime that you do not have a startup 
configuration.
 
Understand that the boot process may be a little different from one model to 
another, but the general idea stays the same.
The boot process
When you first boot your router or switch, the device starts the boot pro-
cess by performing a hardware test known as the Power-On Self-Test (POST). 
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the POST is a routine built into the 
ROM chip that tests all the hardware components (including the different 
ports) on the device to ensure they are working.
 
On a Cisco switch, if there is an error during the POST, the switch displays 
an amber light on the system LED. For more information on the different 
LEDs on a switch, check out Book III, Chapter 3.

Book II
Chapter 1
Introduction to 
the Cisco IOS
179
Powering On Your Cisco Device
After the POST verifies the hardware, control of the boot process is then 
passed on to the bootstrap program. The bootstrap program, also known 
as the boot loader, is stored in ROM and its job is to locate an IOS in flash 
memory and load it into RAM. 
Once the IOS is loaded into memory, the bootstrap program then tries to 
locate a startup configuration from NVRAM that it can apply to the device. If 
the startup configuration does not exist, the device will try to locate a TFTP 
server on the network and load a configuration file from the TFTP server.
If there is not a startup configuration in NVRAM and a TFTP server cannot 
be found, the Cisco device will then display the initial configuration dialog, 
which prompts you for the configuration of the device one setting at a time. 
The initial configuration does not ask you to configure all settings, but 
enough settings to get the device up and running. After the initial configuration 
dialog completes, the configuration becomes the running configuration.
If the Cisco device does contain the startup configuration, the configuration 
is applied to the device upon startup to become the running configuration 
stored in VRAM. The startup configuration retains your router and switch 
configuration through reboots. Figure 1-15 summarizes the boot process of a 
Cisco device.

Configuration changes are stored in the current configuration, which is 
located in NVRAM. In order to retain any changes to the router or switch 
after a reboot, you must copy the running configuration to the startup 
configuration (NVRAM) by using the copy running-config startup-
config command.
Initial configuration dialog
The initial configuration dialog is the closest thing the CLI has to a wizard 
that prompts you for configuration information one question at a time. The 
initial configuration dialog appears anytime there is no startup configuration 
when the Cisco device boots up. It also appears when you type the setup 
command at the CLI.
Once the initial configuration dialog launches, you can use it to quickly 
create a basic configuration on your Cisco device without needing to know 
all of the commands. Listing 1-1 displays the initial configuration dialog 
that appears on bootup if there is no startup configuration or if you use the 
setup command at any time. My responses to the questions that the initial 
configuration dialog asks are shown in bolded text.
 
Once the initial configuration dialog starts, you can terminate it at any time 
by using the Ctrl-C keystroke.

Understanding Cisco Configuration Modes
In Listing 1-1, notice that you are prompted for the name of the device, some 
passwords, and eventually the settings on the interfaces, such as the speed, 
duplex settings, and IP address. At the end of the dialog, you are asked if you 
wish to discard the settings or if you want to save them. I choose option 2 to 
save the setting to NVRAM (the startup configuration). This means that the 
next time my Cisco device boots I will not be prompted for the configuration 
as it will be applied from NVRAM (the startup configuration).
 
The last thing I want to mention before leaving the topic of the boot process 
and the initial configuration dialog is that there are two related commands 
you can use in priv exec mode that you should be familiar with. The first 
command is the reload command, which is the command to reboot the 
router at any point in time. Also, if you ever want to start the initial configu-
ration dialog you can use the setup command — which is why some techs 
also refer to the initial configuration dialog as setup mode.
Understanding Cisco Configuration Modes
Now that you understand the boot process of a Cisco device (if you do not 
understand it, see the previous section before proceeding), you next need 
to be familiar with the different configuration modes on a Cisco device. 
Each configuration mode — user exec mode, priv exec mode, and global 
configuration — is responsible for allowing you to execute different types of 
commands on the Cisco device. When reading about each of these modes, 
use Figure 1-16 to help you understand the relationships between the 
different modes.

183
Understanding Cisco Configuration Modes
User exec mode
The first configuration mode is known as user exec mode, which is a 
read-only-type mode that does not allow you to make changes to the device 
configuration. In user exec mode, you can view the configuration using some 
of the show commands, but again, you cannot modify the configuration.
In order to get to user exec mode, you typically Telnet into the router or 
connect through the console port. Once you connect through the console 
port or Telnet in, you will notice that your prompt displays with a > at the 
end of the prompt, which indicates you are in user exec mode.
 
When using the CLI you will notice there is a prompt waiting for you to issue 
a command. The default prompt is router>, which is made up of the name 
of your router and the symbol indicating what configuration mode you are 
in. The default name of a router is “router,” which is why the prompt dis-
plays as router>, but as you find out in the next chapter you can change 
the name of the router — which will change the text in the prompt. The 
symbol that follows the prompt (for example > or #) is important to note as it 
indicates the configuration mode you are in and the types of changes you 
can make.
Priv exec mode
If you need to make changes to the Cisco router or switch, you need to move 
into priv exec mode, also known as privilege exec mode. To get to privilege 
exec mode, you type the enable command. Once you are in priv exec mode, 
you will notice that your prompt changes from a > to a # at the end of the 
prompt — this indicates you are in priv exec mode and can make changes.
If you decide you want to move back to user exec mode, you can use the 
disable command. This will place you back in the user exec mode prompt, 
which displays with a >.
 
Priv exec mode is also known as enable mode, as that is the command you 
used to navigate to that mode.
Global configuration
The strange thing about the Cisco IOS is that although, in theory, you can 
modify your configuration in priv exec mode, there actually are not any 
commands that I can think of that allow you to change a setting directly 
from priv exec mode. For most of the settings that you need to change, you 
need to navigate one step deeper in the configuration modes. Most changes 
need to be made from global configuration mode. Global configuration mode 
allows you to change a setting that affects the entire router and not just a 
single interface or port.

184
Understanding Cisco Configuration Modes
In order to navigate to global configuration mode, you use the configure 
terminal command, or config term for short. When you’re in global 
configuration mode, you will notice that your prompt changes to display 
(config)# at the end of the prompt. Notice that # symbol still exists in the 
prompt, indicating that you have reached this point by going to priv exec mode.
If you wish to move backward from global configuration to priv exec mode, 
you can use the exit command. An example configuration change you can 
make from global configuration is changing the name of the router with the 
hostname command (more on the changes you can make in the coming 
chapters).
Interface prompt
Once you reach global configuration mode, you can make changes that 
affect the entire device (such as the hostname), but you can also move into 
the prompt hierarchy a bit deeper by navigating to a particular interface. 
Moving into the interface prompt, which displays with a (config-if)# at 
the end of the prompt, allows you to configure settings on an interface such 
as an IP address.
To move to a specific interface from global configuration, you use the 
interface command and specify the interface ID you would like to configure. 
For example, the interface f0/0 or interface fa0/0 commands 
navigate to the first Fast Ethernet port on the router. You know that you are 
at the interface prompt because your prompt changes to (config-if)#.
In order to move backward from the interface prompt to global configuration, 
you use the exit command to go one step back.
Line prompt
There are a number of other prompts you can navigate to from global 
configuration. An example is the line prompt, which is used to configure 
different ports, such as the console port, Telnet ports, and auxiliary ports. 
To navigate to the console port, you use the line con 0 command 
from global configuration mode. When you’re at the console prompt of 
(config-line)#, you can then configure settings that affect the console.
To go back to global configuration mode from the line console prompt, 
you can use the exit command just as you do to move from the interface 
prompt back to global configuration.
 
The CCENT certification exam will not test your knowledge directly on these 
configuration modes, but you need to be comfortable with them and know 
how to move through the prompts in your simulations. You also need to 
know what commands can be used within which prompts — something you 
will get more comfortable with as you continue through this book!

Cisco IOS Features
Cisco IOS Features
Before leaving this chapter and diving into the configuration of your Cisco 
devices, there are two other topics I want to cover. I first want to ensure that 
you know how to locate the version of the IOS you are running, and I also want 
to make sure you understand how to use the help features in the Cisco IOS.
Looking at IOS versions
Each Cisco device will most likely run a different version of the IOS, or 
operating system. This is no different from supporting systems on a 
network where each computer could potentially run a different version of 
the operating system. 
 
The important thing to know about the different IOS versions is that a 
command available with one IOS version may not be available with another 
version, or it may be available but work differently.
When your Cisco device boots up and loads the IOS from flash memory, it 
displays the IOS version information, along with some device summary 
information such as the number of interfaces that exist. The following code

Cisco IOS Features
After the copyright information is displayed, you see information on the 
IOS as the system continues to boot, as shown in the example that follows. 
On the screen, you should notice the version of the IOS software — in this 
example, I am running version 12.4. You can also see the name of the IOS 
image file that was loaded from memory — in this example, it is C2800NM-
ADVIPSERVICESK9-M, as shown in the code below:

After the IOS version is displayed, the device continues to display additional 
information, such as the amount of memory installed, the processor, and the 
different ports, as shown here:

The router then displays the state of your different network connections 
before presenting you with a message to press Enter to get a prompt used to 
configure the device:
%LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface FastEthernet0/1, changed state to 
up
%LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface FastEthernet0/1, changed state to 
administratively down
Press RETURN to get started!
It is very difficult to read all this information as the router or switch boots 
up because the screen scrolls past the information very quickly. At any point 
in time, you can display the version information of your device by using the 
show version command from user exec mode:

You find out more about the IOS commands as you progress through this 
book.
Using the help system
It is important to get comfortable with using the help system in the IOS, as it 
is very difficult to memorize every command and every option on every 
command. To prepare for the CCENT exam, you want to practice the commands 
discussed in this book over and over again so that you know them well, but 
from a real-world point of view, it is more important for you to know how to 
use the help system so you can discover new commands that are required to 
complete a task.
After you boot your router or switch, you are sitting in user exec mode. It is 
important to understand that the modes that I discuss earlier in this chapter 
(user exec, priv exec, and global configuration) each have their own commands 
that you can use within them. You definitely do not want to memorize all the 
commands, all the options with each command, and the mode you need to 
be in for each command — this is the purpose of the help system!
When you are at a prompt on the router or switch, you can use ? command 
at any time to see a list of commands that you can use at that prompt. For 
example, if you are in user exec mode and you use the ? command, you will 
notice in the list of commands that appear that you can use the enable 
command:
R1>?
Exec commands:
  <1-99>      Session number to resume
  connect     Open a terminal connection
  disconnect  Disconnect an existing network connection
  enable      Turn on privileged commands
  exit        Exit from the EXEC
  ipv6        ipv6
  logout      Exit from the EXEC
  ping        Send echo messages
  resume      Resume an active network connection

Cisco IOS Features
  show        Show running system information
  ssh         Open a secure shell client connection
  telnet      Open a telnet connection
  terminal    Set terminal line parameters
  traceroute  Trace route to destination
Once you have viewed the list of available commands, you can then type the 
name of the command with a ? at the end to see which options, known as 
parameters, the command needs to perform its purpose. For example, notice 
that the ping command is in the output; if you type ping ?, you find out 
which parameters the ping command needs:
R1>ping ?
  WORD  Ping destination address or hostname
R1>ping 
Notice that after the parameters are listed, the IOS retypes the command 
you asked for help with; the IOS does this so you do not have to type it again 
once you get a list of parameters. Also notice in the code shown here that 
when you use the ? after the ping command, it displays the help that states 
you need to give a “word” where the question mark is located — and that 
the word is a destination address or hostname. So then you use the ping 
24.0.0.1 ? command to see a list of parameters after the address:
R1>ping 24.0.0.1 ?
  <cr>
In the code that you see here, help displays a <cr> as a parameter to use in 
place of the ?. The <cr> means that you can press the Enter key on the 
keyboard (known as a carriage return) to end the command. So the final 
command to do a ping operation is
R1>ping 24.0.0.1
 
Ensure that you spend some time practicing using the help system. The best 
thing I can recommend is use help on commands that you are already familiar 
with — this way, you can better understand how to read the results of the 
help screen.

Chapter Summary
Chapter Summary
This chapter creates the groundwork for future chapters by outlining the 
different ports and connectors found on Cisco routers and switches. You 
also find out about the different types of memory and the boot process that 
Cisco devices use. The following are some key points to remember about 
this chapter when preparing for the CCENT certification exam:
 
✦ Routers and switches have a console port on the back of the device that 
is used to locally connect to the device and change its settings.
 
✦ The auxiliary port is present on most routers and is typically used 
to remotely connect to the router over the phone lines by plugging a 
modem into the auxiliary port.
 
✦ Most routers have one or more Fast Ethernet ports that are usually 
referenced as F0/0 and F0/1.
 
✦ Most routers have one or more serial ports that are used to connect to 
your WAN environment. The serial ports are normally referenced with 
IDs such as S0/0 and S0/1.
 
✦ Know the different memory types for Cisco devices! The IOS is stored in 
flash memory on the Cisco device, VRAM stores the running configuration, 
and NVRAM stores the startup configuration.
 
✦ Know the boot process for Cisco devices — you are sure to get a question 
on it! The boot process is summarized as POST, bootstrap locates IOS, 
IOS is loaded in memory, and startup configuration is applied.
 
✦ Know the different configuration modes — user exec mode is a read-only 
mode used to view the configuration of the device, while priv exec 
mode is used to make changes. Most changes occur from within global 
configuration mode, which is an extension of priv exec mode.
 
✦ Use the IOS help feature (the ? command) to help you locate the correct 
syntax to perform a specific task.
 
✦ You can use the show version command to display the IOS version 
you are using on the device.

Answers
 1 B. The running configuration is stored in volatile RAM (VRAM). See “Volatile 
RAM (VRAM).”
 2 D. When a device boots up, the POST first verifies the hardware, and then the 
bootstrap program loads the IOS image file from flash memory. Once the IOS 
has been loaded, the startup configuration is read from NVRAM and copied to 
the running configuration. Review “The boot process.”
 3 C. The POST is the first step performed in the boot process and is responsible 
for verifying that the hardware is functioning. Check out “The boot process.”
 4 A. In order to move to priv exec mode, you use the enable command from user 
exec mode. Peruse “Priv exec mode.”
 5 B. Global configuration mode is identified with (config)# in the prompt. Take 
a look at “Global configuration.”
 6 D. In order to save the running configuration to more permanent memory, use 
the copy running-config startup-config command. Peek at “The boot 
process.”
 7 A. The startup configuration is stored in permanent memory known as 
nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM). Look over “Nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM).”
 8 D. The IOS image file is stored in flash memory and is loaded from flash 
memory into RAM during the bootup process. Study “Flash memory.”
 9 B, E. When working on a router or switch, you can refer to a Fast Ethernet port 
by using an interface ID such as f0/0 or fa0/0. Refer to “Cisco Ethernet ports.”
 10 D. The rollover cable, also known as a console cable, is used to connect a 
system to the console port. Examine “Console port.”

Basic Configuration of a Cisco Router
The network router is a layer-3 device that provides routing functions on 
the network. In this section, you discover the basic configuration steps 
needed to get your Cisco router up and running. This includes the steps you 
must take to connect to the router for the first time through the console 
port, and changing the device hostname which is a way to uniquely identify 
your router.
The most interesting way to understand this stuff is to look at an example 
network topology and walk through the configuration of the routers in the 
example. Figure 2-1 shows the example network that I have created. This exam-
ple has two routers, labeled R1 and R2, that are connected to one another 
via their serial ports. Each router is also connected to a switch that has one 
workstation connected to it. This chapter focuses on the router configuration.

Connecting to your Cisco device
The first thing you want to do is connect to the router via the console port 
so you can configure the router. To connect to the console port on the 
router, you connect one end of the console cable (normally a blue cable) 
to your administrative system’s serial port, and then connect the other end 
to the console port on the router. (See Figure 2-2.) The sections that follow 
explain in more detail what you see in this figure.
Once you have physically connected your system to the router’s console 
port, you are ready to launch HyperTerminal — an application that allows 
you to administer the router via the command-line interface (CLI). You 
can launch HyperTerminal on your Windows system by choosing Start➪
All Programs➪Accessories➪Communications➪HyperTerminal.

HyperTerminal was removed from Windows Vista and Windows 7. If you are 
running those operating systems, or another operating system that does not 
have a HyperTerminal application, you need to download third-party software. 
You can download and install TeraTerm as a replacment product from 
http://ttssh2.sourceforge.jp/.
When you select HyperTerminal, it asks you how you are going to connect 
to the Cisco device. Two popular options are to connect to the local console 
port using the serial port on your computer (COM1), or you can Telnet into 
the router by its IP address once the router has been configured. If you have 
not configured the IP address on the router, you need to connect via COM1.
The following are the steps to connect to your Cisco router using 
HyperTerminal:
 
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪Communications➪
HyperTerminal.
 
 The Connection Description dialog box appears.

5. Click OK.
 
6. After you click OK, you should be connected, but you need to press 
the Enter key once.
 
 This creates activity in the HyperTerminal window and causes the 
router prompt to come up.
Changing the hostname
After you connect to the router, the first thing you want to do is configure 
the name (also known as the hostname). All Cisco routers have a default 
hostname of router, so changing the name of the router is a great first change 
to make so that you know which router you are connected to at any point in 
time. Also, most companies design relevant naming conventions to use on 
network devices, conventions that indicate the location of the device and 
maybe its purpose. For example, you might use NY-R01 or NY-R-Acct1 as the 
name of your router for the New York office.
Look back at Figure 2-1, and you see that, in this example, the first router will 
have the name R1 and the second router will have the name R2.
Configuring router R1
To change the name of router R1, the first thing you have to do is move from 
user exec mode to privilege (priv) exec mode by typing enable. You should 
notice that your prompt now ends with a # instead of a >, as shown in the 
following code example:
Router>enable
Router#
Once you are in priv exec mode, the name of the device is a global change — 
remember that changes that affect the router as a whole are modified in 
global configuration mode. To move to global configuration mode, type the 
configure terminal command — or config term for short.
When you’re in global configuration mode, your prompt displays as 
router(config)#. To change the name of the router from global configu-
ration, you can use the hostname command where you pass in a value as 
a parameter to use as the hostname. The following is the complete code 
sample to change your hostname for router R1:
Router>enable
Router#config term
Router(config)#hostname R1
R1(config)#

204
Configuring Ethernet Interfaces
Configuring router R2
You change the name of router R2 the exact same way you changed the 
name of router R1. You will need to connect to the console port on router 
R2 and then use HyperTerminal to connect to the device. Once you are 
connected, you should be in user exec mode and be able to use the same 
commands to configure the name of router R2:
Router>enable
Router#config term
Router(config)#hostname R2
R2(config)#
 
When you are configuring multiple Cisco devices by connecting to the console 
port on each device, you do not need to close and open HyperTerminal each 
time. To switch from one device to another, simply take the console cable 
out of one device and plug it into the second device — then press the enter 
key on the keyboard while in HyperTerminal!
Configuring Ethernet Interfaces
Once you have configured the names of the routers, the next step is to 
configure the network interfaces on the router. Each network interface 
is similar to the network card in your computer — it is used to send and 
receive information. If you intend to use the interface to connect to another 
device or network, you have to configure it with the correct protocol 
information and then enable the interface so that it is up and running. Let’s 
look at how to configure the Ethernet interfaces first!
You can connect the Ethernet interfaces on your router to local network 
devices, such as a switch, using a straight-through cable, but you can also 
use the Ethernet port to connect to another router or a computer if you use 
a crossover cable.
Once you connect the Ethernet port on the router to the switch, you then 
have to configure the settings on the interface. Example settings you may 
configure on the Ethernet card are IP settings, a description, a speed, and 
maybe duplex settings. I tell you how to configure those settings in the 
paragraphs that follow.
Configure IP settings for the Ethernet interface
In order to configure your Ethernet interface for an IP address, you need to 
navigate to the interface prompt. You can navigate to the Ethernet prompt 
a number of different ways depending on the type of interface. If you are 
dealing with an older router, such as a 2501, you simply use the interface 

Book II
Chapter 2
Basic Router 
Configuration
205
Configuring Ethernet Interfaces
ethernet0 command to navigate to the first interface. If you are dealing 
with a router that has Fast Ethernet ports (100 Mbps), you use the interface 
fastethernet 0/0 syntax to connect to the first Fast Ethernet port, or 
interface fastethernet 0/1 to connect to the second Fast Ethernet 
port.
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#interface f0/0
Notice in the code example that you use the interface command from global 
configuration mode. Also notice that I have used the abbreviation for the 
Fast Ethernet port; f0/0. Using the abbreviation of fa0/0 is also very common.
 
You will notice that the Cisco devices and documentation label the Fast 
Ethernet ports using the FE identifier, for example, FE0/1. However, when 
you configure the port you must use f0/1 or fa0/1 instead of fe0/1 as the FE 
label is not used in a command and will not work.
Once you have navigated to the Ethernet port, you can assign an IP address 
to the interface. To assign an IP address to an interface on the router, you 
use the ip address command, as shown here.
R1(config-if)#ip address 23.0.0.1 255.0.0.0
Most router interfaces will have a static address assigned to them, but from 
time to time you may want to configure the interface to obtain an IP address 
from a DHCP server on the network. (I tell you about DHCP servers in Book I, 
Chapter 3.) The following code sample is used to configure the interface to 
obtain an IP address from a DHCP server:
R1(config-if)#ip address dhcp
Again, this is not overly popular, as assigning a static address is normally 
what we do with routers — you do not want the IP address of the router to 
change.
 
To remove the IP address from an interface, you use the no ip address 
command once in the interface prompt.
Configure a description for the Ethernet interface
Once you assign an IP address to the Ethernet interface, you may want to 
assign a description. The purpose of the description on an interface is to 
allow you to add a quick comment (up to 240 characters) about the purpose 
of the port. In my example in this chapter, I configure the Ethernet port on 
router R1 for a description of “Private LAN,” as shown here:

206
Configuring Ethernet Interfaces
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#interface f0/0
R1(config-if)#description Private LAN
 
The benefit of adding a description is that when you troubleshoot later on 
down the road, you will see the description of the interface as you use some 
of the different show commands — extremely valuable when you cannot 
remember the purpose of all the different network connections!
Configure other settings for the Ethernet interface
Before you enable the interface, you may want to configure other settings on 
the Ethernet interface. The first setting you may want to configure, in addition 
to an IP address, is the duplex setting, such as setting the interface to half- 
or full-duplex. In the code example that follows, I configure the interface for 
full-duplex (allows the port to send and receive at the same time):
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#interface f0/0
R1(config-if)#duplex full
You can use the full-duplex setting when making direct connections between 
two devices such as connecting two devices with a crossover cable, or when 
connecting a device to a switch. You use half-duplex when connecting the 
device to a hub.
You can also set the speed of the network link with the speed command, 
which indicates what speed to run the interface at, as most interfaces today 
support multiple speeds. You normally have a choice of 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 
or 1000 Mbps (depending on the interface) and you should choose a speed 
for the interface that matches the speed at the other end of the link. For 
example, if you are connecting your router to a 10 Mbps hub then you set 
the speed on your router’s interface to 10 Mbps. The following code example 
sets the speed of the interface to 100 Mbps:
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#interface f0/0
R1(config-if)#speed 100
Enabling and disabling the interface
Once the interface is configured, you can then enable the interface with the no 
shutdown command. I know that the no shutdown command is a strange 
command to enable an interface, but it makes sense when you find out where 
it came from. To understand the no shutdown command, it is probably best 
to find out how to disable an interface with the shutdown command.

Book II
Chapter 2
Basic Router 
Configuration
207
Configuring Ethernet Interfaces
 
A lot of my students ask why you use the shutdown command to disable an 
interface, instead of something like “disable.” The reason is that the disable 
command is already used for exiting from priv exec mode to user exec mode, 
so Cisco had to come up with a different command to disable the interface — 
so shutdown is the command. 
 
With most Cisco commands, if you want to do the opposite action or negate 
a command, you put the word no at the beginning of the command. For 
example, if shutdown disables an interface, no shutdown enables the 
interface.
After configuring the interface, use the following command to enable it and 
bring it online (meaning the interface is active and up and running):
R1(config-if)#no shutdown
After using the no shutdown command, you see a status message, indicating 
that the state of the link has changed. This message tells you which interface 
is changing state and what that new state is — either up or down. The following 
is a sample of the status message you should receive:
%LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface FastEthernet0/0, changed state to up
If the Cisco device reports back a state change of down it means the interface 
is offline and not running. If the state of the interface is up, it means the 
interface is online and is running.
Configuring router R2 for the Ethernet interface
After you configure the Ethernet interface on router R1, you can configure 
similar settings on router R2 from the sample network diagram. Looking 
back at Figure 2-1, note that the Fast Ethernet port is used to connect to the 
LAN and you see that the Fast Ethernet port on router R2 should be assigned 
the IP address of 25.0.0.1. Use the following commands to configure router R2:
Router>enable
Router#config term
Router(config)#hostname R2
R2(config)#interface f0/0
R2(config-if)#ip address 25.0.0.1 255.0.0.0
R2(config-if)#description Private LAN
R2(config-if)#speed 100
R2(config-if)#duplex full
R2(config-if)#no shutdown
%LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface FastEthernet0/0, changed state to 
up
R2(config-if)#

208
Configuring Serial Interfaces
Once you have configured router R2, you can navigate backward in your 
prompts using the exit command. The first time you type exit, it takes 
you back to global configuration mode, but the second exit command takes 
you back to priv exec mode. Here’s what that looks like:
R2(config-if)#exit
R2(config)#exit
%SYS-5-CONFIG_I: Configured from console by console
R2#
Configuring Serial Interfaces
After you configure the Ethernet interface, you can look at configuring the 
serial interface. In the previous chapter, you found out that the serial 
interface is typically used to connect to a WAN device, such as a CSU/DSU, 
which is connected to your service provider’s WAN link (remember that the 
WAN is used to connect multiple LANs together over great distances).
You can also use the serial port to connect two routers directly together (a 
point-to-point link) using a special cable known as a back-to-back serial cable. 
This is very popular in test labs and training environments as you do not 
actually need to have a real WAN (multiple LANs connected over great 
distances) to practice using serial port commands.
Configure IP settings for the serial interface
You can configure the IP address on the serial port the same way you 
configure an IP address on an Ethernet port, which I cover earlier in the 
chapter. The following commands demonstrate how to configure router R1’s 
serial interface from Figure 2-1:
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#interface serial 0/0
R1(config-if)#ip address 24.0.0.1 255.0.0.0
In the example here, you notice that the serial port is from slot 0, port 0 
(0/0). When you navigate to the interface, you use the ip address command 
just as you do on an Ethernet port. (See the “Configure IP settings for the 
Ethernet interface” section earlier in the chapter for details.
 
If you are unsure of the different port numbers on your Cisco device, you 
can normally view the running configuration to see each interface and its 
configuration. To view the running configuration on your Cisco device you 
use the show running-config command. You find out more about working 
with your configuration files in the “Verifying Your Configuration” section 
later in this chapter.

209
Configuring Serial Interfaces
Configure a description for the serial interface
After configuring an IP address on the serial port, you may want to add a 
description to the port as well. You use the description command just as 
you do on the Ethernet interface to add a description:
R1(config-if)#description WAN-To-ISP
Like setting a description on your Ethernet port for the LAN connection, it 
may be useful to label the interface that is connecting to your service provider 
with the description command. This helps you identify the purpose of the 
connection to that interface when you view the configuration.
Configure other settings for the serial interface
There are some unique settings you are required to configure on the serial 
port in order for it to send and receive data across the link such as the 
encapsulation protocol and the clock rate (if it is a DCE device). Some of the 
additional optional settings you may want to configure are settings such as 
the description (which you have already seen) and the bandwidth setting. 
This section shows you how to configure these required and optional settings 
on your serial interface. 
Encapsulation protocol
When sending data across a serial link, you must send the data using a serial 
link protocol. This works by placing the data you are sending inside a layer-2 
frame using a serial link protocol, known as an encapsulation protocol. (See 
Figure 2-5.) The paragraphs that follow explain in greater detail how this works.
 
Figure 2-5:

The serial port is typically used to connect to your service provider allowing 
you access to the WAN. You find out more about WANs and configuring 
WAN interfaces in Book IV, Chapter 4, but for a now, take a look at two main 
serial link protocols — HDLC and PPP.

210
Configuring Serial Interfaces
The High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) protocol is a layer-2 protocol that 
is designed to send information over a serial link from one point to another. 
Cisco devices use a Cisco proprietary version of the HDLC protocol, meaning 
that a Cisco router running HDLC on one side of the link cannot communicate 
with a different vendor running HDLC on the other side of the link. If the 
serial link has a Cisco router on both ends of the link, you can use the HDLC 
protocol to allow communication across the link.
To enable the HDLC protocol on the serial port, you use the encapsulation 
command followed by the protocol you want to use. The following are the 
commands to enable the HDLC protocol on a serial port:
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#interface serial 0/0
R1(config-if)#encapsulation hdlc
If you are using different types of routers on the ends of the serial link, you 
may be unable to use the HDLC protocol, and you may have to use an industry-
standard serial link protocol such as the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), which 
has been a popular serial link protocol for many years. Computers with 
dialup connections have been using it to connect from computer to ISP for 
over a decade now.
If you wish to configure your router to use the PPP protocol as its encapsulation 
protocol, use the encapsulation command as follows:
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#interface serial 0/0
R1(config-if)#encapsulation ppp
 
Remember that you must use the same protocol at either end of the serial 
link in order for communication to occur! In my example, if you configure the 
serial port on router R1 for PPP, the serial port on router R2 must also use PPP.
The following code example configures both router R1 and router R2 for the 
HDLC protocol:
On router R1:
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#interface serial 0/0
R1(config-if)#encapsulation hdlc
On router R2:
R2>enable

Clock rate
After you configure the encapsulation protocol on the serial link, you may 
have to set the clock rate, which sets the clocking speed, or timing, for the 
link itself. It is typically set by the service provider if your serial port connects 
to the service provider. However, if you are not connecting the serial port to 
the WAN service provider — for example, you are creating a point-to-point 
connection between the two routers using a back-to-back serial cable — then 
you are required to configure one end of the link as the end that provides the 
speed of the link.
In a point-to-point configuration, the end that provides the speed uses the 
Data Communication Equipment (DCE) end of the cable — the other end of the 
cable is the Data Terminal Equipment (DTE), which does not provide clock-
ing information. Figure 2-6 shows the label on the end of a back-to-back cable, 
which indicates whether you are using the DCE or DTE end of the link.
Once you connect the serial ports with a back-to-back cable, you then go 
to the router that has the DCE end of the cable to set the clock rate. In my 
example, connect the DCE end of the cable to router R1 so that router R1 
has to provide the clocking information. The following code sample demon-
strates how to set the clocking speed in bits per second (bps):
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#interface serial 0/0
R1(config-if)#clock rate 64000
In the example code here, the clock rate, or speed of the link, is set to 64000 
bits per second; essentially, it is a 64 Kbps link. If you want to see the different 
speeds that can be set with the clock rate command, you can use the help 
system within the Cisco IOS by typing a ? where the speed would be supplied:
R1(config-if)#clock rate ?
Speed (bits per second
  1200           
  2400           
  4800           
  9600           
  19200          
  38400          
  56000          
  64000          
  72000          
(output has been cut for briefness)
R1(config-if)#

The DTE label
Bandwidth
Another setting you can specify on your different interfaces is the bandwidth 
of the link. The bandwidth is different from the clock rate in the sense that 
the bandwidth setting does not control the actual speed of the link — it is 
just a setting that different routing protocols use to determine the best route 
to a destination network. Bandwidth will make more sense to you once you 
understand routing and routing protocols, which is covered in Book III, but 
the key point is the links with higher bandwidth become the more preferred 
routes to a destination.
Setting the bandwidth is optional, and the default bandwidth on a serial 
link is 1.544 Mbps. To set a different bandwidth on an interface, you use the 
bandwidth command, which is measured in kilobits:
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#interface serial 0/0
R1(config-if)#bandwidth 1000

Chapter 2

Configuring Passwords
The following summarizes the commands that we will use to configure the 
serial ports on router R1 and router R2:
For router R1:
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#interface serial 0/0
R1(config-if)#ip address 24.0.0.1 255.0.0.0
R1(config-if)#clock rate 64000
R1(config-if)#encapsulation hdlc
R1(config-if)#bandwidth 1000
R1(config-if)#no shutdown
For router R2:
R2>enable
R2#config term
R2(config)#interface serial 0/0
R2(config-if)#ip address 24.0.0.2 255.0.0.0
R2(config-if)#encapsulation hdlc
R2(config-if)#bandwidth 1000
R2(config-if)#no shutdown
Notice in the above code examples that the clock rate is set only on router 
R1, as it is the DCE device — the clock rate does not need to be set on the 
DTE device because it receives the clocking information from the DCE 
device.
 
Also notice that at the end of the code for both serial interfaces, there is a 
no shutdown command, which is used to enable the serial interface. If you 
do not use the no shutdown command, the interface will default to being 
disabled.
Configuring Passwords
Cisco devices support many different types of passwords. You want to make 
sure you set a password for when an administrator tries to enter privilege 
exec mode, but you also want to set passwords on each of the connection 
types, such as a console port connection, auxiliary port connection, and a 
Telnet connection.
This section introduces you to configuring passwords on your Cisco device, 
and the topic is revisited again in Book IV, Chapter 2.

214
Configuring Passwords
You can configure your Cisco router or switch to prompt for a password 
when someone tries to move from user exec mode to priv exec mode on the 
router or switch by setting an enable password. An enable password kicks in 
when someone tries to use the enable command to go to priv exec mode.
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#enable password mypass
The problem with the enable password command is that the password 
is stored in the router configuration in clear text — anyone who can view 
the configuration can see the password! To countermeasure this, Cisco has 
created what it calls the enable secret — it is a password for enable mode, 
but the password is encrypted in the configuration file. If you configure an 
enable password and an enable secret, the secret is the one that takes 
precedence and will need to be used to enter privilege exec mode.
Use the following commands to configure both the enable password and the 
enable secret on your Cisco router:
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#enable password mypass
R1(config)#enable secret mysecret
 
It is important to remember the difference between the enable password 
command and the enable secret command — the enable password is 
stored in an unencrypted format in the device configuration files, while the 
enable secret is encrypted in the configuration. Note that it is a best practice 
to use the enable secret over the enable password. 
Let’s take a look at the configuration after the enable password and the 
enable secret are set on the router. To view the current configuration, you 
can use the show running-config command:
R1(config)#exit
R1#show running-config
Building configuration...
(output omitted for briefness)
!
enable secret 5 $1$u76B$IOFVJ7VxfVXYVpGDrFTcI0
enable password mypass
!
(output omitted for briefness)
!
Notice in the above output that the secret has been encrypted, but the 
enable password is stored in clear text.

Book II
Chapter 2
Basic Router 
Configuration
215
Configuring Passwords
 
For the CCENT certification exam, remember that the enable secret is 
encrypted in the configuration and takes precedence over the enable 
password command when both are used.
After setting a password to enter privilege exec mode, you should also set 
a password on each of the different ports that someone may use to make a 
connection to your router; these ports are the console port, the auxiliary 
port, and the Telnet ports used for remote connections.
Console password
In order to set a password on the console port — which you need to do so 
that someone can make a connection through that port — you use the fol-
lowing commands:
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#line con 0
R1(config-line)#password conpass
R1(config-line)#login
Looking at the commands in this example, you see that you first move to 
global configuration to make the change. Then you use the line con 0 
command to move into the configuration of the console port. When you are 
in the line prompt, you can specify the password you want for this port. 
Then you use the login command to turn on authentication for that port 
and have the Cisco device ask for a password. If you forget the login 
command, the Cisco device will never prompt for the password.
 
Remember for the CCENT certification exam that the login command is 
needed in order to enable authentication. If the login command is missing, 
your router will not prompt for passwords on the port you are connecting 
through!
Auxiliary port password
Configuring a password on the auxiliary port is similar to configuring the 
console port for a password. In order to configure the auxiliary port for a 
password, use the following commands:
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#line aux 0
R1(config-line)#password auxpass
R1(config-line)#login

216
Configuring Passwords
You can see that the only difference between setting a password on the 
console port and the auxiliary port is the line aux 0 command. Notice 
that the login command is supplied once again and is used to enable 
authentication on that port.
Telnet password
The purpose of setting the console and auxiliary port passwords on the 
router is to control who can physically connect to those ports and manage 
the device. Administrators can also Telnet into the router in order to 
administer the device from a remote location. You need to configure your 
router for Telnet passwords if someone is going to Telnet into the router. 
The following commands are used to configure passwords on the Telnet 
ports:
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#line vty 0 15
R1(config-line)#password vtypass
R1(config-line)#login
 
Cisco devices require a Telnet password and a password when entering 
privilege exec mode to be configured on the router in order to be able to 
remotely connect to the router. The Cisco devices do not allow you to do 
remote administration without these passwords set.
Notice in the preceding code example that to set Telnet passwords you 
use the line vty command. vty is the code used for Telnet ports, and 
it stands for virtual teletype. The other key point is that there are multiple 
Telnet ports; each port allows a Telnet connection, and in order to require a 
password for each connection, you specify 0 and then the maximum number 
of Telnet ports. 
To find out how many Telnet ports your router supports, use the following 
command:
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#line vty 0 ?
  <1-15>  Last Line number
  <cr>
Notice in the preceding code example that my router supports up to 15 
Telnet ports. 
Let’s take a look at what the configuration looks like with all the passwords 
configured on each of the different ports. In order to view the current 
configuration, you use the show running-config command again:

(output omitted for briefness)
 
Configuring passwords is revisited in the security best practices chapter, 
Book IV, Chapter 2. There you find out that storing the passwords in clear 
text within the configuration is not a good practice, so you should use the 
service password-encryption command to encrypt all passwords that 
are stored in the configuration file.
Creating Users
If you want to require more than just a password in order for an administrator 
to connect to your router, you can create usernames and passwords on your 
Cisco router.
In order to create a user on your Cisco router, you use the username com-
mand in global configuration mode, as shown here:
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#username dan password danpass
R1(config)#username glen password glenpass
Once you have created the usernames and passwords, you can then force 
the router to prompt for those local usernames (local meaning the accounts 
in the current device) when an administrator tries to log in to the different 
ports; use the login local command to do so. The following shows how 

218
Configuring Banners
to enable login access on the console port using the local user accounts that 
you have configured:
R1(config)#line con 0
R1(config-line)#login local
If you want the router to ask for those usernames when someone tries to 
connect to the Telnet ports, you use the following commands after creating 
the usernames:
R1(config)#line vty 0 15
R1(config-line)#login local
Again, notice that the login local command (instead of just login) is 
used — it tells the Cisco device to enable authentication but to use the local 
usernames configured on the device. You configure the auxiliary port the 
same way but navigate to the aux 0 port instead of con 0.
Configuring Banners
A banner is a message you wish to display to an administrator when he 
connects to the Cisco router. Depending on the type of banner you create, 
this message could appear before or after login. The purpose of the banner 
is to show critical information to the administrator, and in this day and 
age, it is also used to display a legal notice that unauthorized access to the 
device is strictly prohibited.
 
I discuss banners in more detail in Book IV, Chapter 2.
Types of banners
Before I show you how to configure banners on a Cisco router or switch, 
it is important to know that there are different types of banners that you 
can configure. Each type of banner is designed for a specific purpose and 
appears at a different time during the logon process.
 
✦ Message of the day (MOTD): Displays before the administrator is asked 
to log in. The initial purpose of the MOTD banner was to show a temporary 
notice that could change from time to time to the person connecting. 
Network administrators are now using the MOTD banner to display legal 
notices that unauthorized access to the device is prohibited.
 
✦ Login: Displays before the administrator is asked to log in but appears 
after the MOTD banner (if one is set) displays. The login banner is 
designed to display a more permanent message, something that will not 
change from day to day, to the person connecting.

Book II
Chapter 2
Basic Router 
Configuration
219
Configuring Banners
 
✦ Exec: The exec banner, or what I like to refer to as the user exec banner 
(not an official term, by the way), displays after an administrator logs 
on and enters user exec mode. Use this type of banner to display only 
those messages that you want to display to an administrator who has 
authenticated to the system. Because the MOTD and login banner 
appear before a login, anyone who connects to the system can view 
them; the exec banner, however, is visible only after an administrator 
logs on — so you know that whoever sees the message is an authorized 
person.
Configuring a banner
When you are comfortable with the different types of banners (if you are not 
now, see the previous section), take a look at how to configure the banners 
on a Cisco router. Keep in mind that you configure banners on a switch the 
exact same way.
The following code configures a MOTD banner on your Cisco device.
R1(config)#banner motd #
Enter TEXT message. End with the character ‘#’.
This device is for authorized personnel only. 
Please disconnect at once if you have not been given 
permission to access this device.
#
R1(config)#
Notice that you set the MOTD banner from global configuration mode with 
the banner motd # command. The # symbol serves as the delimiter and 
indicates what character ends the message when you type the message out. 
Notice that I have two lines of text set as the message of the day and a third 
line with the #, indicating that I am done setting the message of the day.
 
You can use whichever character you like as the delimiter, as long as you 
specify it in the banner command.
The following code example specifies the login banner. Notice that it is very 
similar to setting the MOTD banner, but you use the login keyword instead 
of motd in the banner command.
R1(config)#banner login #
Enter TEXT message. End with the character ‘#’.
*** Login Required. Unauthorized use is prohibited ***
#
R1(config)#

220
Other Useful Commands
You are not required to set the MOTD banner and the login banner, and 
most companies usually set one or the other. If you find that you have the 
need to show a unique message on different days, you may set your normal 
“unauthorized access is prohibited” message as the login banner so that you 
can have a MOTD banner as well when it is needed.
Notice in the following output that when someone connects to the router or 
switch the MOTD is displayed before the login banner:
R1 Con0 is now available
Press RETURN to get started!
This device is for authorized personnel only.  Please 
disconnect at once if you have not been given permission 
to access this device
*** Login Required.  Unauthorized use is prohibited ***
User Access Verification
Password:
If you wish to set a user exec password, you can use the banner exec 
command. Remember, this message shows after login as the individual 
enters user exec mode:
R1(config)#banner exec #
Enter TEXT message.  End with the character ‘#’.
*** Be sure to update the change log after any changes ***
#
R1(config)#
Other Useful Commands
Before you discover how to view your configuration, I want to mention a few 
other commands that I think are useful to know when working with Cisco 
routers.
Saving configuration changes
The first command I want to review is how to save your changes. You find 
out in the previous chapter that there are two main configuration files — the 
running-config and the startup-config. The running-config file is 
stored in volatile memory (RAM) and is lost when you power down or reboot 
the router. The startup-config file is nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM), which 
maintains its data even when the power is lost or the router is rebooted.

Book II
Chapter 2
Basic Router 
Configuration
221
Other Useful Commands
As you make your changes, they are stored in the running-config file, and 
if you wish to permanently store the changes, you must copy the changes to 
the startup-config file. The following command copies your running 
configuration to the startup configuration for permanent storage:
R1#copy running-config startup-config
Destination filename [startup-config]? 
Building configuration...
[OK]
Notice in the code example that after typing the copy command, the Cisco 
IOS prompts for confirmation by asking what the destination filename is. 
Notice that Cisco provides a default response in the square brackets, and if 
you wish to use that default response, you can press the Enter key instead 
of typing a response. You can’t see it in the output, but I pressed Enter to 
accept the default.
The copy command has been around in the Cisco world for a long time, and 
in the next chapter, you find out how to use it to store your configuration on 
a TFTP server. Because saving your changes to the startup-config file is 
so popular, Cisco came up with a shorter command that you can use to 
perform the same task — the write command.
R1#write
Building configuration...
[OK]
What I like about the write command is that it does not prompt for a 
destination — it always writes to the startup-config file. One less prompt 
is always a good thing!
 
The write command is short for write memory, which is also a valid com-
mand and can be used. There is a rumor that Cisco will be dropping the 
write command in favor of the copy command as the copy command is 
more flexible and supports different memory types as the source and desti-
nation of the copy operation. You find out more about the copy command in 
Book II, Chapter 3.
Deleting the configuration
You can delete your router’s configuration, also known as erasing the 
configuration, by erasing the startup configuration and then rebooting the 
router. Because there is no startup configuration present, the Cisco device 
will ask if you want to use the initial configuration dialog to apply basic 
settings.

222
Other Useful Commands
If you answer yes, the initial configuration dialog prompts you for basic 
password information and interface configuration. If you answer no, the 
initial configuration dialog is skipped and you are given a default configuration 
for the device, which has a hostname of router and no settings applied to the 
interfaces.
To erase the configuration on your Cisco router, use the following commands:
R1>enable
R1#erase startup-config
Erasing the nvram filesystem will remove all configuration 
files! Continue? [confirm]
[OK]
Erase of nvram: complete
R1#reload
Proceed with reload? [confirm]
If you want to save this default configuration after the reload is complete, 
simply use the write command to save the running configuration to the 
startup configuration.
Looking at the most recently used commands
One of the great things about the Cisco IOS is it keeps a history of the 
commands that you type so you can navigate to a command at a later time 
without having to type it again! You can navigate through the history of 
commands by using the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard.
You can view the list of commands stored in the history by using the show 
history command as shown here:
R1#show history
  enable
  show history
  config terminal
  show history
  show interfaces
  show history
  show running-config
  show history
The maximum number of commands stored in the history is ten, but you can 
change that setting. To view the history size setting, you can use the show 
terminal command as follows:
R1#show terminal

Modem type is unknown.

Domain lookups and console timeout
When working on a Cisco router there are two things that may annoy you — 
having an incorrect command trying to be resolved through DNS and having 
the console timeout when working. This section discusses both of these 
annoyances and how to disable both features.
Domain lookups
When you type a command incorrectly, the Cisco device thinks you are 
trying to connect to another system by name so it tries to resolve the 
incorrect command to an IP address by sending the query to a DNS server. 
A great feature, right? Well the problem is it takes time for the reply to come 
back for a name (or command, in this case) you know will not have an 
associated IP address in DNS, and you will get tired of waiting — especially if 
you are like me and have a typo in every second command you type!
To disable DNS lookups use the following command:
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#no ip domain-lookup

224
Verifying Your Configuration
Console Timeout
You may want to have the console timeout within a certain amount of time 
of inactivity. This means if you leave the system for a few minutes and get 
tied up, you have the confidence of knowing that the console connection will 
timeout and you will be automatically disconnected — no one will be able to 
sit at the console and execute commands because you have been automatically 
disconnected!
To configure the console to timeout you can use the following commands:
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#line con 0
R1(config-line)#exec-timeout 1 45
In the code above, the timeout is set to 1 minute and 45 seconds. You can 
also disable the console timeout feature by setting the exec-timeout to 0 
minutes and 0 seconds as shown below:
R1(config-line)#exec-timeout 0 0
Verifying Your Configuration
After you complete the basic configuration of your routers, you want to 
verify the configuration to ensure that the router is configured properly. 
This section introduces you to a number of different commands that you 
should be familiar with to verify your configuration.
Viewing the configuration files
I am sure you are familiar with the first command by now — it is the show 
running-config command, which displays the current configuration in 
volatile memory. You use this command to verify the commands you have 
used to configure the passwords, banners, and the configuration of the 
different interfaces.
R1>enable
R1#show running-config

 history size 30
line vty 0 15
 password vtypass

(output cut for briefness)
You use the show running-config command to display settings such 
as the IP address on an interface or the password on a specific port, but it 
is also a great way to understand commands from an already configured 
router!
Remember that the running-config is not permanent memory, so if 
you want to ensure that your configuration settings will come back after a 
reboot, you may want to verify the settings in the startup-config. You 
can view the startup-config file by using the show startup-config 
command, which displays similar results as the running configuration. 
 
In the code above, notice that the interface in the show running-config 
command is identified as serial0/2/0. This interface identifier is different 
than the slot/port syntax you read about in the previous chapter. In this 
example, the first 0 is an index number for the device (router or switch) in a 
pool of devices. So the full syntax is device/slot/port, and you may see this 
from time to time.
Viewing interface configuration
Not only do you need to view the running-config to verify the configuration 
of your router (see the previous section), but it is also important for you to 
know how to view the status of the interfaces by using a number of show 
commands.
 
The CCENT certification exam will give you a number of simlets (a scenario-
based question that uses a simulator) where you are allowed to use the 
show running-config command, but you will also have simlets where 
that command is disabled because Cisco wants to test your knowledge of 
other show commands. This section is designed to expose you to those 
commands.

226
Verifying Your Configuration
The show interfaces command
The first command to view the status of your interfaces is the show 
interfaces command. This command has a lot of output, as it displays 
information about every interface on the router. You are presented with 
one screenful of information at a time, and you need to press the spacebar 
to continue viewing the next screen of information. To cancel viewing the 
information at any time, you press the Esc key. The following shows sample 
output from the show interfaces command:
R1>show interfaces
FastEthernet0/0 is up, line protocol is up
  Hardware is Lance, address is 00d0.bc99.1801 (bia 00d0.
bc99.1801)
  Internet address is 23.0.0.1/8
  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 100000 Kbit, DLY 100 usec, rely 255/255, 
load 1/255
  Encapsulation ARPA, loopback not set
(Output cut for briefness)
Serial0/2/0 is up, line protocol is up 
  Hardware is HD64570
  Internet address is 24.0.0.1/8
  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 1000 Kbit, DLY 20000 usec, rely 255/255, 
load 1/255
  Encapsulation HDLC, loopback not set, keepalive set (10 sec)
(Output cut for briefness)
The first thing I want you to notice in the output is that there are two statuses 
on each port; in this example, the interface is up and the line protocol is 
up. This status message (which is shown in bold type in the output here) is 
important because the first part (FastEthernet0/0 is up) indicates that 
there is a physical link between the interface and the line you connected to 
the interface, and the second part (line protocol is up) indicates that 
the protocol has been configured properly.
There may be a different status displayed on the interface as summarized 
below; you find out more on troubleshooting interfaces in Book III, Chapter 5:
 
✦ Serial0/2/0 is up: As mentioned, if the interface displays as up it means 
there is a physical link between the interface and the other end of the 
cable you are connecting to the interface. A status of up is a good thing 
as it indicates everything is up and running.
 
✦ Serial0/2/0 is down: A status of down indicates there is a problem with 
the connection or you have misconfigured the interface. In order to fix 
the problem review your configuration.
 
✦ Serial 0/2/0 is administratively down: When you see a status of 
administratively down it means an administrator has purposely disabled 
the interface. In order to bring the interface up you use the no shutdown 
command on the interface.

Book II
Chapter 2
Basic Router 
Configuration
227
Verifying Your Configuration
Assuming the interface is up, there are two statuses that can display with 
the line protocol — up or down. If the line protocol is up then you have 
configured the protocol for the interfaces at either end of the link properly. 
If the line protocol is down, you should verify the configuration on both ends 
of the link as there is most likely a mistake in the configuration if the protocol 
cannot come online. The most common mistake is to load the wrong encap-
sulation protocol or to not set the clock rate on the DCE end of the cable.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, remember that the first part of the status 
message (FastEthernet0/0 is up) indicates a layer-1 status, while the 
second part of the status message (line protocol is up) is an indication 
that the layer-2 protocol is fine.
Also notice that you can see the MAC address and the IP address assigned to 
each of the ports when using the show interfaces command.
The show interface f0/0 command
If you find there is too much information displayed on the screen when you 
use the show interfaces command, you can use the show interface 
(note that “interface” is singular, not plural) command and then supply the 
ID of a specific interface to see status information on just that one interface.
R1>show interface f0/0
FastEthernet0/0 is up, line protocol is up
  Hardware is Lance, address is 00d0.bc99.1801 
  Internet address is 23.0.0.1/8
  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 100000 Kbit, DLY 100 usec, rely 255/255, 
load 1/255
  Encapsulation ARPA, loopback not set
(Output cut for briefness)
 
The output is nearly the same as the show interfaces command, but 
again you see the status of only the one interface. The show interface 
command is great if you are troubleshooting a specific link or interface.
The show ip interface command
Another show command (one that is probably more important for your 
CCNA exam than the CCENT but is still worth mentioning) is the show ip 
interface command. When you use this command, it displays each 
interface and tells you whether that interface is up and running. It also 
displays protocol information such as the IP address on the interface and 
things like whether an access list is applied. Access lists (an in-depth discussion 
of them is outside the scope of this book) are lists of rules that allow or deny 
traffic through the interface.
R1>show ip interface
FastEthernet0/0 is up, line protocol is up 
  Internet address is 23.0.0.1/8

  Security level is default
  Split horizon is enabled
  ICMP redirects are always sent
  ICMP unreachables are always sent
  ICMP mask replies are never sent
(Output cut for briefness)
The show ip interface brief command
A more relevant command for the CCENT certification exam is the show 
ip interface brief command, which displays a nice listing of status 
information for all the ports on your router:
R1>show ip interface brief
Interface 
IP-Address OK? Method Status Protocol 
FastEthernet0/0 23.0.0.1 
YES manual up 
up 
FastEthernet0/1 unassigned YES manual up 
down 
Serial0/2/0 
24.0.0.1 
YES manual up 
up
Notice that you can see the IP address assigned to the interface, what 
method is used to assign that IP address (either manual or through DHCP), 
the status of the link (layer-1), and the status of the layer-2 protocol.
The show controller command
The final command to mention is the show controller command, where 
you supply the interface as a parameter. This command is valuable to use 
on serial ports because it shows the clock rate that is set on the port and 
displays whether the serial port is the DCE device or the DTE device.
R1>show controller serial0/1
Interface Serial0/2/0
Hardware is PowerQUICC MPC860
DCE V.35, clock rate 64000
(Output cut for briefness)
Notice in the output above that the serial port is the DCE device and has a 
clock rate of 64000 bps.
 
Be sure to know the different show commands for the CCENT certification 
exam, as you will need to use them in simulators to troubleshoot problems. 
The best way to get comfortable with them is to practice using them before 
taking the exam!

Chapter Summary
This chapter introduces you to basic configuration settings on a Cisco 
router, with the focus on configuring the interfaces on the router. The 
following are some key points to remember regarding basic configuration:
 
✦ Settings are stored in volatile RAM (running-config) until you use the 
write command to save the settings to the startup-config.
 
✦ The Cisco IOS stores your recent commands in the history, so you 
can access previously typed commands using the arrow keys on your 
keyboard.
 
✦ You change the history size using the terminal history size 
command in priv exec mode.
 
✦ You must set an encapsulation protocol on your serial port to carry data 
over the serial link. Two popular serial link protocols are HDLC and PPP.
 
✦ The speed of the WAN link is normally determined by the service provider, 
but if you connect to another Cisco router using a back-to-back serial 
cable, the DCE device needs to specify the speed of the link with the 
clock rate command.
 
✦ You negate most commands with the keyword no at the beginning of the 
command.
 
✦ There are a number of commands you can use to view your current 
configuration when troubleshooting. You can start with the show 
running-config command to view a list of configuration commands 
applied to the router.
 
✦ You use the show interfaces command to view the status of each of 
the network interfaces.
 
✦ You use the show ip interface brief command to display a 
table-like view that summarizes the status of the interfaces.
 
✦ The show controller serial0/1 command determines the clock 
rate set on the interface and whether the interface is the DCE or DTE 
device. You can use this show controllers command on any serial 
interface by its interface ID.
Lab Exercises
Now that you have some basic understanding of how to configure settings 
on a Cisco router, you can practice the configuration steps by looking at 
some network diagrams and applying the configuration. These labs build off 
of each other, so be sure to complete the labs in order.

Answers
 1 B. The syntax to reference an interface is first the type of interface, followed by 
the slot/port, for example, fastethernet 0/1. See “Configure IP settings for 
the Ethernet interface.”
 2 D. In order to assign an IP address to an interface via DHCP, you use the ip 
address command but pass in the word dhcp as a parameter instead of an 
actual IP address. Review “Configure IP settings for the Ethernet interface.”
 3 A, C. When configuring a serial interface that acts as the DCE device, you need 
to provide the encapsulation protocol and the clock rate. Check out “Configure 
other settings for the serial interface.”
 4 B, D. You can configure the serial interfaces of a Cisco router for either the HDLC 
encapsulation protocol or the PPP protocol. Peruse “Encapsulation protocol.”
 5 D. The show controller command is used on an interface to display the clock 
rate on the link and to indicate whether the interface acts as the DTE or DCE 
device. Take a look at “The show controller command.”
 6 C. The show ip interface brief command displays a table listing all the 
interfaces and their settings. Peek at “The show ip interface brief command.”
 7 B. When using the show interfaces command, you see the status of the link 
shown in the format of Serial0/2/0 is up, line protocol is down. The 
Serial0/2/0 is up part indicates whether there is a link (layer-1), while the 
line protocol down part indicates whether the layer-2 protocol has been 
configured properly. Look over “The show interfaces command.”
 8 A. The command to increase the number of commands that are stored in the 
history buffer is the terminal history size command, which is executed 
from priv exec mode. Study “Other Useful Commands.”
 9 B. If the line protocol is down, there is a problem with the configuration of the 
serial link protocol or the clock rate. Also note that if the protocol has not been 
configured properly on the other end, the line protocol still displays as down. 
Refer to “The show interfaces command.”
 10 D. Because the status of the link shows as administratively down, this is an 
indication that you have disabled the port or have not enabled the port. You 
need to enable the port with a no shutdown command. Examine “The show

✓ Backing up your configuration and IOS
✓ Understanding CDP
✓ Using Telnet for remote administration
T
he previous chapter introduces you to the basics of configuring your 
Cisco device, through a discussion of topics such as changing the 
hostname, configuring passwords and banners, and configuring the network 
interfaces. It tells you how to save your configuration from volatile memory, 
known as the running-config, to more permanent storage known as the 
startup-config (stored in nonvolatile memory).
This chapter extends your Cisco device knowledge by discussing how to 
back up your configuration and IOS to a central server so you can restore 
that configuration back to your Cisco device at any point in time. You also 
find out more about two popular protocols used in the Cisco world — 
Telnet for remote administration, and the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), 
which you can use to discover information about Cisco devices on the 
network.

Backing Up Your Configuration and IOS
240
Backing Up Your Configuration and IOS
The configuration for your Cisco routers and switches is stored in two 
places by default. The configuration is stored in the running-config file 
and the startup-config file (if you have saved your running-config to the 
startup-config). It is important to also back up this configuration to a location 
off the Cisco device in case the configuration files are erased by accident or 
you decide to replace the device. In the case where you replace the device, 
it is possible for you to restore the configuration from the central location 
to the new device — saving you time because you will not need to configure 
settings, such as the hostname and the IP addresses on the interfaces, 
manually on the new device.
You can back up the Cisco router or switch configuration to a Trivial File 
Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server, which is a special server designed for 
transferring small files over UDP port 69. When looking at protocols that 
transfer files, TFTP is more basic compared to FTP. For example, it does not 
support authentication, while FTP (File Transport Protocol) does, but TFTP 
has less overhead than FTP — so it is more efficient.
 
It is important to back up the configuration of all of your Cisco devices 
so that you can restore the configuration when needed. I have talked to a 
number of administrators who have a base configuration stored in a file on 
a TFTP server; when they receive a new Cisco device for production, they 
download the base configuration from the TFTP server — which contains 
items such as passwords, encryption, and banner information — and then 
they tweak it from there.
Installing TFTP software
When looking to back up your Cisco device configuration to a central 
location, the first thing you need is a TFTP server. For this discussion, I use 
the 30-day trial version of WinAgents TFTP Server software that you can 
download and install on most versions of Windows, including Windows XP, 
Windows Vista, and Windows 7. The 30-day trial should be good enough to 
experiment with backing up your configuration but note that if you plan on 
using the software past the trial period you will need to purchase it.
To install and configure your own TFTP server, follow these steps: 
 
1. Download a trial version of WinAgents TFTP Server software from 
www.tftp-server.com.
 
2. Run the downloaded executable (most likely named tftpserver-
setup.exe).
 
3. In the welcome screen that appears (see Figure 3-1), click Next.

(the File List) displays the files located in the selected folder. At the 
bottom of the screen (the Transfer Log), you see status messages of file 
uploads and downloads.
With the TFTP server installed, you can now back up your router and switch 
configurations to the TFTP server.

Backing up your configuration 
In Book II, Chapter 1, you find out that you can use the copy command to 
copy the running-config to the startup config. The following code reviews 
this syntax:
Copy running-config startup-config
To break down the syntax for the copy command, you always start with the 
word copy followed by the source of what you are copying, and then you 
specify the destination. The syntax may be better displayed as
Copy <source> <destination>
The exciting point about the copy command is that you can use it to copy 
your configuration — or even your IOS — from many different sources to 
many different destinations. In order to copy your running-config to a TFTP 
server, you use the following command:
Copy running-config tftp
After you enter this command, the Cisco IOS prompts you for the IP address 
of the TFTP server and asks what you would like to call the destination 
configuration file when it copies the running-config to the server.

244
Backing Up Your Configuration and IOS
NY-R1#copy running-config tftp
Address or name of remote host []? 192.168.5.100
Destination filename [ny-r1-confg]? ny-r1-confg-May272010
!!
1664 bytes copied in 4.344 secs (383 bytes/sec)
In the code here, you see that I use the copy command on router NY-R1 and 
specify a destination of tftp. The IOS has prompted me for the IP address 
of the TFTP server, and I have supplied an address of 192.168.5.100. The 
IOS then asks me for the name of the destination file. Notice in square brackets 
that the IOS has a default filename to use. If you want to use that filename, 
you can simply press the Enter key or type a different filename like I did. I 
chose to include the date that the configuration was saved in the filename.
Once the file is saved, you receive confirmation of how many bytes were 
saved in how much time. If you navigate back to TFTP Manager (see Figure 
3-5), you see the new file in the File List (the top-right pane) and also see the 
file transfer information (including the IP address of the system or device 
that performed the transfer) in the Transfer Log at the bottom of the screen.

Restoring your configuration
Once your configuration is backed up to a TFTP server, you can then restore 
that configuration at any point in time to your Cisco device. To restore the 
configuration, you use the copy command, but this time you flip the source 
and destination parameters around so that the source is the TFTP server 
and the destination is the running configuration, as shown here:
Copy tftp running-config

Book II
Chapter 3
Managing Cisco

245
Backing Up Your Configuration and IOS
To test this command, you can change the name of the router from NY-R1 
to NY-R1b. After the restore operation is complete, you should have the old 
router name applied from the configuration file stored on the TFTP server.
NY-R1>enable
NY-R1#config term
NY-R1(config)#hostname NY-R1b
NY-R1b(config)#exit
After you have changed the name of the router, you can use the copy command 
to copy the configuration from the TFTP server to your running configuration. 
The Cisco IOS will prompt you for the IP address of the TFTP server and the 
name of the configuration file to download.
NY-R1b#copy tftp running-config
Address or name of remote host []? 192.168.5.100
Source filename []? ny-r1-confg-May272010

Notice at the end of the preceding code that the router name is restored to 
the original name that has been backed up to the configuration file. This 
is a quick way to validate that the changes have been applied from the 
configuration file on the TFTP server, but understand that any settings in the 
configuration file are restored, including old passwords.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, be sure you are familiar with backing up 
your router and switch configuration to a TFTP server, and also know how 
to restore the configuration back to the device from the TFTP server.
Backing up your IOS
It is important to back up your configuration, but you should also back up 
the Cisco IOS from your router to the TFTP server, just in case the IOS is 
corrupted on your device. In the case where the IOS is corrupt on your 
device, you can restore the IOS from the TFTP server — as long as you have 
backed it up to the TFTP server.
In order to back up the IOS, you need to know the filename of the IOS that is 
stored in the flash memory you wish to back up. To view a list of files in flash 
memory, you use the show flash command. The IOS file is a file stored in 
flash that has a .bin extension and most likely has a filename that symbolizes 
the series of the device you are working with. The following code uses the 
show flash command on my Cisco 2811 router:

2006, and has the filename of c2800nm-entservicesk9-mz.123-14.
T7.bin. Notice that the filename has the series number specified in the 
filename (c2800) — this is useful so that you know what devices you can 
apply this IOS to. You want to make sure that you have enough space on the 
TFTP server to accommodate the size of your IOS file.
After you note the filename of the IOS file that is stored in flash memory, you 
use the copy command to back up this file to the TFTP server. The syntax 
to use the copy command is copy flash tftp; the source of the copy is 
flash memory, and the destination is the TFTP server.

In the code here, I use the copy flash tftp command, and the Cisco IOS 
prompts me for the name of the file in flash memory that I want to copy to 
the TFTP server. It then prompts me for the IP address of the TFTP server. 
Lastly, the IOS prompts me for the name of the destination file to create on 
the TFTP server. I recommend keeping the default name by pressing the 
Enter key. (The default name is shown in square brackets.) As the file copies 
to the TFTP server, the progress of the copy operation is displayed with 
exclamation points. When the copy completes, the IOS reports how many 
bytes have been copied and how long it took.

Backing Up Your Configuration and IOS
Upgrading the Cisco IOS
You upgrade your Cisco IOS on the Cisco device by copying the IOS from the 
TFTP server to flash memory on your Cisco device. This means that you first 
need to have the IOS on the TFTP server. You can obtain a new version of 
the IOS for your device from the Cisco Web site (www.cisco.com) and then 
copy the IOS to the TFTP server for downloading to the device.
 
If you do not have enough flash memory on the destination device to store 
the current IOS image and the new image being copied from the TFTP server, 
the existing IOS image is deleted from flash memory to make space. Be sure 
to back up your existing IOS to the TFTP server before copying a new IOS 
image to the device. You can use the show flash command to view how 
much memory is available in flash memory.
Once the IOS is on the TFTP server, you use the copy command to upgrade 
your IOS in flash memory. The syntax to copy the new IOS is copy tftp 
flash, and once again, the Cisco IOS prompts you for the TFTP server 
address and the filename to download to flash memory. The following 
example downloads an IOS from my TFTP server to flash memory:
NY-R1>enable
NY-R1#copy tftp flash
Address or name of remote host []? 192.168.5.100
Source filename []? c2800nm-entservicesk9-mz.123-14.T7.bin

Notice in the preceding code that after the copy tftp flash command is 
used the IOS prompts for the IP address of the TFTP server. It then asks for 
the filename to download and what to call the file at the destination (flash 
memory). To accept the default filename (which is shown in square brackets), 
you press Enter. In my example, the IOS filename is already present, so it 
asks me if it is okay to overwrite the file. If you are prompted to overwrite 
and wish to do so, ensure that you have a backup of the existing IOS file on 
a TFTP server first. This helps you recover the old IOS file if something does

go wrong with the overwrite operation. As the file downloads, the progress 
is indicated with a number of exclamation points. After the copy operation is 
successful, the IOS reports how many bytes have been copied and how long 
it took.
Boot system command
After you copy the new IOS image from the TFTP server to the device, you 
can specify which IOS the router is to use (when you have multiple IOS 
images in flash memory) by using the boot system command. When using 
the boot system command, you specify where the IOS is coming from and 
what the IOS filename is. The following commands show how to display the 
contents of flash memory and then specify an IOS image filename to use as 
the IOS image:
NY-R1#show flash
System flash directory:
File  Length   Name/status
  1   50938004 c2800nm-advipservicesk9-mz.124-15.T1.bin

NY-R1#config term
NY-R1(config)#boot system flash c2800nm-
advipservicesk9-mz.124-15.T1.bin
If you want your Cisco router to boot from the IOS image file stored on the 
TFTP server, you can do that as well! When booting your router off an IOS 
image located on the TFTP server, the image is not downloaded to flash 
memory on the device — instead, when the device is started it contacts the 
TFTP server and boots the IOS from the TFTP server.
The advantage of loading the IOS from a TFTP server on bootup is that you 
do not have to add the IOS to all of your routers! This gives you a central 
location to update your IOS without having to run around to all your routers 
and upgrade the IOS.
 
The huge disadvantage of loading the IOS from the TFTP is that if the TFTP 
server goes down, then you will be unable to boot any of your routers! This 
central point of failure is a huge disadvantage and one that makes loading 
the IOS from a TFTP something I cannot recommend. However, if you are 
still interested in loading the IOS from the TFTP server, you can use the 
boot system tftp <image filename> command in global configuration 
mode:
boot system tftp c2800-advipservicesk9-mz.124-15.T1.bin

Understanding CDP
In Book II, Chapter 1, you read about the Cisco boot process and the fact 
that the Cisco device has a mini-IOS (known as RX-Boot) stored in ROM that 
you can use when you are unable to boot an IOS normally. If you want to 
boot your Cisco device to this mini-IOS, you can use the boot system rom 
global configuration command. Once you boot to the mini-IOS, you can 
configure and enable an interface and copy an IOS from a TFTP server.
Understanding CDP
In this section, you find out about the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) and 
how you can use it to identify neighboring Cisco devices on the network. 
Output for the show cdp commands can tell you which devices are 
connected to a device, how often CDP information is sent, and how long 
CDP information is stored. With show cdp commands, you can also find 
a device’s ID, the port that it connects to, its model or series, and its IP 
address. In this section, I also tell you how to disable CDP.
You are most definitely going to see a CDP question or two on the CCENT 
certification exam, so be sure to know this topic well.
CDP overview
The Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is a protocol that Cisco designed for 
its devices to help you gather information about neighboring devices. 
(A neighboring device is a device that your router or switch is directly 
connected to.)
Each Cisco device sends CDP advertisement messages to each interface 
every 60 seconds by default. These advertisement messages identify 
information about the devices, such as the type of device (for example, 
whether the device is a switch or router), the model number of the device, 
the version of the IOS that the device is running, and the IP address 
assigned to the device.
Figure 3-6 displays the network topology you can use to understand the 
concepts of CDP. Notice that there are two routers, named NY-R1 and 
BOS-R1. Each router is connected to a switch for its network. The switches 
are named NY-SW1 and BOS-SW1.
I focus on CDP from the context of NY-R1, but understand that CDP is run-
ning on all devices by default — so this discussion applies to all devices. The 
NY-R1 router sends out CDP messages every 60 seconds (known as the CDP 
timer), identifying the information about NY-R1. The CDP packet is sent out 
to all interfaces (see Figure 3-7) in this example; the packet is sent out of the 
serial port and the Fast Ethernet port and reaches the devices — the BOS-R1 
(via the serial interface) and the NY-SW1 (via the Fast Ethernet interface) — 
at the other end of those links.

When the BOS-R1 router and the NY-SW1 switch receive the CDP packet 
from NY-R1, they store the CDP information about the NY-R1 locally for 180 
seconds by default. This is known as the CDP hold timer value. When you 
use the CDP commands (more on those in a minute) on BOS-R1 or NY-SW1 
to view information about neighboring devices, the information is retrieved 
from the local device indicating that there is a neighboring device out there 
called NY-R1 and providing all related information about the device, such as 
the type of device, the model, the version of the IOS it is running, and the IP 
address.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, know that the CDP timer is how frequently 
CDP packets are sent out and is set to 60 seconds by default. Also know that 
the CDP hold timer is how long CDP information is stored on the local device 
and is set to 180 seconds by default.

Understanding CDP
As a Cisco administrator, you can view the setup of CDP on your system 
with the show cdp command:
NY-R1>show cdp
Global CDP information:
    Sending CDP packets every 60 seconds
    Sending a holdtime value of 180 seconds
    Sending CDPv2 advertisements is enabled
Notice in the preceding code that NY-R1 is sending CDP packets every 60 
seconds (the cdp timer) and that the holdtime value is set to 180 seconds. 
If you want to change the CDP timer value (cdp timer) or the holdtime 
value, you use the cdp timer and cdp holdtime global configuration 
commands:
NY-R1(config)#cdp timer 90
NY-R1(config)#cdp holdtime 240
NY-R1(config)#exit
NY-R1#show cdp
Global CDP information:
        Sending CDP packets every 90 seconds
        Sending a holdtime value of 240 seconds
        Sending CDPv2 advertisements is  enabled
Remember that you can use the help feature in the Cisco IOS at any point in 
time to understand these commands. For example, if you want to find out 
what commands are supported by CDP, you can use the following:
NY-R1(config)#cdp ?
  advertise-v2      CDP sends version-2 advertisements
  holdtime          Specify the holdtime (in sec) to be sent
  log               Log messages generated by CDP
  source-interface  Insert the interface’s IP in all CDP
  timer             Specify the rate CDP packets are sent
  run
Notice that holdtime and timer are parameters used with the cdp command. 
If you want to view help on these commands, you can use syntax similar to 
the following:
NY-R1(config)#cdp holdtime ?
  <10-255>  Length  of time  (in sec) that receiver must keep 
this packet

252
Understanding CDP
Using CDP
Now that you understand the purpose of CDP, I want to show you how 
you can use CDP on your devices to gather information about neighboring 
devices on the network.
The show cdp neighbors command
The first command to talk about is a very popular command used to display 
neighboring devices — the show cdp neighbors command. Figure 3-8 
displays the output of the show cdp neighbors command from router 
NY-R1.
 
Figure 3-8: 
Using the 
show cdp 
neighbors 
command 
to view 
information 
about 
other Cisco 
devices.
 
Here’s how to read each column of the show cdp neighbors output in 
Figure 3-8:
 
✦ Device ID: Indicates, in this example, that there are two device IDs 
present — NY-SW1 and BOS-R1; these are the names of neighboring 
devices to the NY-R1 router. 
 
✦ Local Intrfce: Stands for local interface. Lists the port on NY-R1 that 
each device is connected to. For example, notice that the Serial 0/2/0 
interface on NY-R1 is the local interface connected to BOS-R1. 
 
✦ Holdtme: Stands for hold time. The value in this column tells how long, 
in seconds, this information is stored on the NY-R1 router. 
 
✦ Capability: Shows a code, such as R for router and S for switch; this is 
how you identify the type of neighboring device.
 
✦ Platform: Displays (you guessed it) the platform; the platform identifies 
the model or series of the device you have as a neighbor. For example, 
notice in Figure 3-8 that the switch is a 2960 model switch, but the router 
is a 2800 series router. The difference between a model and a series is 
that there are many different models in a series. For example, Cisco has 

Book II

Understanding CDP
a 2900 series of switches and each model in the series provides something 
unique; there are 2924, 2950, and 2960 model switches in the 2900 series.
 
✦ Port ID: Identifies the port on the neighboring device. For example, the 
NY-R1 FastEthernet0/0 local port (see the Local Intrfce column) is 
connected to the FastEthernet0/1 port on the switch.
The show cdp neighbors detail command
If you need to collect a little more information on the neighboring devices 
on the network, you can use the show cdp neighbors detail com-
mand. This command displays information similar to what you get with the 
show cdp neighbors command, but you get additional information such 
as the IP addresses of the device and the IOS version that is running on each 
device. The following output shows the results of the show cdp neighbors 
detail command being executed on NY-R1:
NY-R1>show cdp neighbors detail

Notice in the preceding code that, as the router administrator on NY-R1, 
you can see the version of the IOS running on both NY-SW1 and BOS-R1 (the 
neighboring devices to NY-R1) and determine any IP addresses assigned to 
the devices.

254
Understanding CDP
 
Be sure to know how to collect information about network devices using the 
show cdp neighbors and show cdp neighbors detail commands. 
You are sure to see a question on the exam asking you to identify the model 
devices and IOS versions of routers and switches on the network.
The show cdp entry command
One of my personal favorite commands is the show cdp entry command, 
which you can use after using the show cdp neighbors command to identify 
more detail on a specific device. For example, looking back at Figure 3-8 you 
can see there is a switch with a device ID of NY-SW1. If you want to find more 
information about that specific entry, you use the show cdp entry 
<ID>; the <ID> is replaced by the device ID obtained from the show cdp 
neighbors command — in this case, NY-SW1:
NY-R1>show cdp entry NY-SW1
Device ID: NY-SW1
Entry address(es): 
Platform: cisco 2960, Capabilities: Switch
Interface: FastEthernet0/0, Port ID (outgoing port): 
FastEthernet0/1

(output cut for briefness)
It is important to note two things about the device ID. First, you can use an 
* as the device ID to display information on all devices. The second thing is 
that the ID is case sensitive! This means you have to type the device ID the 
way it displays in the show cdp neighbors command output in order for 
it to work.
There are a lot of really cool options on the show cdp entry command. 
For example, you can use the show cdp entry * command to display 
information on all devices, and you can use the show cdp entry * 
protocol command to view protocol information (such as the IP address) 
for all devices. Here’s how:
NY-R1>show cdp entry * protocol

255
Understanding CDP
In the preceding code, you see that NY-SW1 has no IP address assigned, but 
an IP address is assigned to BOS-R1.
Disabling CDP
Because the CDP protocol is a protocol used for device discovery, you may 
choose to disable it on your network devices for security reasons. Disabling 
CDP on your network devices prevents someone from being able to discover 
your device details from neighboring routers or switches.
You can disable CDP two different ways — at the device level or at the 
interface level. If you disable CDP at the device level, it will no longer send 
CDP packets out on the network stating details about the device. If you 
disable CDP at the interface level, it is disabled only for that one interface 
but may run on other interfaces.
Disabling CDP globally
In order to disable CDP for the device globally — meaning disabling the pro-
tocol on the device and all the interfaces — you navigate to global configura-
tion mode on the device and use the no cdp run command, as follows:
NY-R1>enable
NY-R1#config term
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
NY-R1(config)#no cdp run
NY-R1(config)#exit
NY-R1#show cdp
% CDP is not enabled
In the preceding code example, you see that CDP is disabled from global 
configuration mode, and then, when you display the status of CDP with the 
show cdp command, it reports that CDP has been disabled. If you wish to 
enable CDP again, you use the cdp run command from global configuration 
mode.
NY-R1(config)#cdp run
NY-R1(config)#exit
NY-R1#show cdp
Global CDP information:
    Sending CDP packets every 60 seconds
    Sending a holdtime value of 180 seconds
    Sending CDPv2 advertisements is enabled
Disabling CDP on an interface
To disable CDP on a specific interface, you first need to navigate to that 
interface and then use the no cdp enable command as shown in the code 
that follows:

256
Using Telnet for Remote Administration
NY-R1#config term
NY-R1(config)#interface serial 0/2/0
NY-R1(config-if)#no cdp enable
CDP is now disabled on that interface. If you decide at a later time that you 
want to enable CDP on that interface, you can use the cdp enable command 
once at the interface prompt again.
Using Telnet for Remote Administration
Up to this point in the book, I discuss connecting to your router using the 
console port. Connecting to the console port for administration is great, as 
long as you can get physical access to the router. This may not always be 
possible, such as when you are at a different site. So, what do you do if you 
are at another location and need to make a change to a router?
The answer: You use a protocol such as Telnet to remotely connect to the 
router by its IP address, and then you can make the changes. This section 
discusses the concept of Telnet and how to use it to remotely administer a 
Cisco device.
Telnet overview
Telnet is an application-layer protocol (remember the OSI model discussion? 
If not, check out Book I, Chapter 4) that is designed to allow you to remotely 
connect to a device or system and run a program from that device. In the 
case of router administration, you can Telnet into the router (or switch) 
and issue the appropriate Cisco commands through the Telnet session to 
manage the device.
 
The Telnet protocol uses TCP port 23. If you expect to be able to Telnet into 
the router, you need to ensure that the firewall has TCP port 23 open to 
allow the Telnet traffic to pass through the firewall.
Also note that if you Telnet into a switch from another network, the switch 
needs to have its default gateway setting configured so it knows how to send 
data off the network back to your system running the Telnet client software. 
(See Figure 3-9.) You find out how to modify the default gateway setting on a 
switch in Book III, Chapter 4.
Notice in Figure 3-9 that an administrator sitting at ComputerA is Telneting 
into switch BOS-SW1. The traffic is sent through NY-R1, then to BOS-R1, and 
then to the switch. The important point is that the switch has to send a reply 
back to ComputerA, and the reply must pass through the BOS-R1 router to 
do that. In this example, if the switch is not configured for a default gateway 
of 25.0.0.1, the switch will not be able to send the reply back to the 
administrator.

Using Telnet features
Actually Telneting into a Cisco device is a very simple process. The first 
thing you need to make sure of is that you have a Telnet password assigned 
to the device. (For security reasons, you cannot Telnet into a device that 
does not have a password. See the preceding chapter if you need to know 
how to configure a Telnet password.)
In order to Telnet into a Cisco device, use the telnet command and then 
type the IP address of the device you wish to Telnet into. The following code 
example Telnets into BOS-R1 from NY-R1 router:
NY-R1>telnet 24.0.0.2
Trying 24.0.0.2 ...
User Access Verification
Password: 
BOS-R1>
When connecting to another device using Telnet, you need to specify the 
Telnet password; if the password you supply is correct, you are allowed 
access to the device and can administer it. After you make the changes that 
are needed to the device, you can then disconnect from the device using the 
exit command. Notice in the following code that after typing the exit 
command at the BOS-R1 prompt, you are then disconnected and placed back 
on the original router.
BOS-R1>exit
[Connection to 24.0.0.2 closed by foreign host]
NY-R1>

258
Using Telnet for Remote Administration
 
Be sure to remember for the exam that if you do not have a Telnet password 
and a privilege exec mode password or enable secret, you will be unable to 
Telnet into a device. This is a preventative step that Cisco has taken so that 
if you do not have passwords set on your Cisco router, no one can connect 
to the router.
Suspending and disconnecting a session
Once you connect to a router via Telnet, you can then make the changes 
you need to make to the device. If you decide that you need to temporarily 
disconnect — but you don’t actually want to disconnect because you are 
going to come right back to the Telnet session — you can suspend your 
Telnet session. A suspended Telnet session runs in memory on the router 
and can be resumed at any point in time.
In order to suspend a Telnet session, you use a very strange set of keystrokes — 
press Ctrl-Shift-6, and then release all keys and press the X key. See the 
following code for the results:
NY-R1>telnet 24.0.0.2
Trying 24.0.0.2 ...
User Access Verification
Password: 
BOS-R1>enable
Password: 
BOS-R1# <I pressed ctrl-shift-6, then x to suspend>
NY-R1>
Notice the prompts in the preceding code. After I press Ctrl-Shift-6 and then 
X at the BOS-R1# prompt, I am automatically placed back on my original 
router (NY-R1). The reason I suspended the session was because I had some 
work to do on the NY-R1 router. I suspended my Telnet session and wham — 
I’m back on the NY-R1 router!
Imagine that after you perform some work on the NY-R1 router, you decide 
to see if you have any suspended Telnet sessions that you can connect to 
once again. (It is easy to forget about suspended sessions.) You can use the 
show sessions command to view a list of suspended Telnet sessions, as 
shown in Figure 3-10.
Notice the asterisk (*) symbol beside the only session that is suspended. 
The * represents your most recent session; simply pressing the Enter key 
allows you to resume that connection. Alternatively, you can resume any 
of the sessions shown in the show sessions output by using the resume 
command and specifying the connection number:

Book II
Chapter 3

Devices
259
Using Telnet for Remote Administration
NY-R1>resume 1
[Resuming connection 1 to 24.0.0.2 ... ]
BOS-R1> 
 
Figure 3-10: 
The show 
sessions 
command 
displays any 
suspended 
Telnet 
sessions 
that you can 
reconnect 
to.
 
When the router displays the resuming connection message, press the Enter 
key to activate the connection.
When you use the show sessions command and you see a suspended 
session that you have forgotten about and no longer need, you can 
disconnect from that session without resuming it by using the disconnect 
command and specifying the connection number, as shown in Figure 3-11.
 
Figure 3-11: 
You can 
close a 
suspended 
Telnet 
session 
with the 
disconnect 
command.
 
 
If you are currently in the Telnet session, you can type exit to close the 
Telnet session, but if you have suspended the Telnet session and are not 
currently in it, you need to use the disconnect command.

Chapter Summary
Monitoring connections
As a router administrator, you want to keep a close eye on who is connected 
to the router. The show users command displays any connections to the 
router, including Telnet and local connections, using the console port. In 
Figure 3-12, you (as the router administrator) can see two connections to 
router BOS-R1; one is at the console, and the other is a Telnet session 
(displayed with vty).

Chapter Summary
This chapter introduces you to a number of concepts that are important to 
managing Cisco devices. The following are some key points to remember for 
the CCENT certification exam:
 
✦ You back up your router configuration to a TFTP server using the copy 
running-config tftp command.
 
✦ You back up your IOS to a TFTP server using the copy flash tftp 
command.
 
✦ You upgrade your IOS using the copy tftp flash command.
 
✦ You use the boot system flash command to specify a particular IOS 
file in flash memory that you want to use when the router boots up. 
 
✦ CDP is a Cisco protocol that can help you discover neighboring devices 
and information about them.
 
✦ The show cdp neighbors command shows you a list of neighboring 
devices, while the show cdp entry command displays information 
about a specific device. You can view detailed information about all 
neighboring devices with the show cdp neighbors detail command.
 
✦ You disable CDP on your Cisco router by using the no cdp run 
command. You can also disable CDP on a specific interface by using the 
no cdp enable command at an interface prompt.

Lab Exercises
This chapter introduces you to concepts related to managing Cisco devices. 
You discover how to back up and restore your configuration and IOS to 
a TFTP server. You also find out how to use CDP to discover information 
about a Cisco device and how to Telnet into a device. The following labs 
help you get familiar with backing up and restoring your configuration, 
working with CDP, and using Telnet.
 
These labs build off of each other, so be sure to complete the labs in order.
Lab 3-1: Backing up and restoring 
your configuration
In this lab, you install a TFTP server on your system and then back up your 
router configuration to the TFTP server. You end the lab by restoring the 
configuration back to your router.
To install and configure your own TFTP server, follow these steps on a 
Windows computer on your test lab network:
 
1. Download a trial version of WinAgents TFTP Server software from 
www.tftp-server.com.
 
2. Run the downloaded executable (most likely tftpserver-setup.
exe) by double-clicking the executable.
 
3. When the welcome screen displays, click Next.
 
4. Select the I Accept the License Agreement option and click Next.
 
5. On the Select Installation Type screen, select Complete, and then 
click Next.
 
6. Click Next to accept the Windows Firewall options.
 
7. Click Next to begin the installation.
 
8. When the installation completes, click Finish.

262
Lab Exercises
 
9. To start the TFTP server, choose Start➪All Programs➪WinAgents 
TFTP Server 4➪TFTP Server Manager.
 
10. Choose to connect to the local server (your system) and click OK.
 
11. Click Yes to start the service.
 
12. Leave the TFTP Server Manager window open.
 
13. Now that you have the TFTP server installed, you can back up your 
router configuration to the TFTP server. Connect to the router with 
HyperTerminal and type the following command:
router#copy running-config tftp
 
14. Answer the questions by supplying your computer’s IP address as the 
IP address of the TFTP server, and create a destination file named 
lab3_1_confg.
 
15. When the backup completes, change the name of your router with the 
following command:
router#config term
router(config)#hostname Rout_back
 
16. Test a restore of the configuration on the TFTP server by typing the 
following command:
Rout_back(config)#exit
Rout_back#copy tftp running-config
 
17. When prompted for the IP address of the TFTP server, supply the IP 
address of your computer running the TFTP server software and 
specify that the file to download is lab3_1_confg.
 
18. After the copy command is complete, you should notice that your 
router name is back to the original router name; the router name 
should now be router#.
Lab 3-2: Using CDP to discover the network
In this lab, use CDP to discover other Cisco devices on the network. For this 
lab, you need to ensure that you have a router connected to other devices, 
such as another router and a switch.
 
1. Console into the router from HyperTerminal, if you are not connected 
to the router already.
 
2. From priv exec mode, use the show cdp neighbors command to 
view a list of devices connected directly to your router:
router>enable
router#show cdp neighbors

Managing Cisco Devices

Answers
 1 B. In order to back up your configuration, such as the running-config, or your 
IOS, you can use the copy <source> <destination> command. See 
“Backing up your configuration.”
 2 D. The copy command backs up the Cisco IOS. Because the IOS resides in flash 
memory and you are sending the copy to the TFTP server, you need to use the 
copy flash tftp syntax. Review “Backing up your IOS.”
 3 C. The Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) identifies neighboring Cisco devices and 
gives you information about each device, such as its platform and IP address. 
Check out “CDP overview.”
 4 A. The show cdp entry * protocol command shows all devices, and only 
the IP address of the devices. You can use the show cdp neighbors detail 
command to view all devices and their IP addresses, but you receive more 
information than just the IP address (which makes this an incorrect choice). 
Peruse “The show cdp entry command.”
 5 C. You can temporarily suspend a Telnet session with the Ctrl-Shift-6, and then 
X keystroke. Take a look at “Suspending and disconnecting a session.”
 6 B. In order to resume a suspended Telnet session, you use the resume 
command and specify the device ID as a parameter. Peek at “Suspending and 
disconnecting a session.”
 7 A. The show sessions command displays a list of suspended Telnet sessions. 
Look over “Suspending and disconnecting a session.”
 8 D. To disable CDP on an interface, you need to navigate to that interface and use 
the no cdp enable command. Study “Disabling CDP on an interface.”
 9 A. To display details about a specific neighboring device, use the show cdp 
entry command with the device ID. This displays information about the device, 
such as the device ID, IP address, and the platform (model). Refer to “The show 
cdp entry command.”
 10 B. To disable CDP on the router and not just on an interface, use the no cdp 
run command. Examine “Disabling CDP globally.”

✓ Implementing network services
✓ Understanding password recovery procedures
✓ Using the Security Device Manager (SDM)
O
nce you have configured the basic settings — such as passwords, IP 
addresses on the interfaces, and login banners — on a router, you 
will then want to look at implementing additional services, such as name 
resolution on the router or maybe DHCP.
You need a method of assigning IP addresses to all the clients on the 
network. This chapter shows you how you can configure your Cisco router 
as a DHCP server. You also learn how to configure additional services, such 
as network address translation (NAT). Finally, the chapter discusses the very 
important topic of password recovery, including instructions on what you 
need to do when you have forgotten your router passwords.

Implementing Network Services
272
Implementing Network Services
A network service is responsible for providing some form of functionality to 
the network. In this section, you find out about three different network services 
that help systems on the network communicate: hostname resolution, DHCP 
services, and Network Address Translation. I also review the concept of 
each service and then focus on how you can configure Cisco devices with 
those services.
Understanding hostname resolution
The first network service to discuss is name resolution, which allows us to 
connect systems or devices by name instead of the IP address of the device. 
This means that you do not have to memorize all of the different addresses 
of devices — you simply remember the name and the name gets converted 
to an IP address.
Most companies have a DNS (domain name service) server on the network 
that handles name resolution for all the systems on the network. You can 
configure your Cisco device to be a DNS client that resolves names by 
sending queries to the company DNS server, or you can build your own 
hostname table on the Cisco device. I tell you how to do both methods in 
the sections that follow.
Configuring hostname tables
Let’s first take a look at how to configure a hostname table on your Cisco 
router to do name resolution.
 
In this chapter, the example topology I use is shown in Figure 4-1.

Implementing Network Services
You see two routers, NY-R1 and BOS-R1, in Figure 4-1. For this discussion, 
let’s say that you are the administrator for the New York branch and want to 
be able to Telnet into the BOS-R1 router by its name. To do this, you need to 
configure a hostname table with the names and corresponding IP addresses 
of systems you want to connect to by name.
First, verify that you cannot connect to the BOS-R1 router by name; try 
communicating with it using the name with the ping command, as shown in 
the following code:
NY-R1>ping BOS-R1
Translating “BOS-R1”...domain server (255.255.255.255)
% Unrecognized host or address or protocol not running.
In order to communicate with the device by name, you need to add an entry 
to the hostname table on your router. To do that, you use the ip host 
command from global configuration mode and supply the name and IP 
address as parameters to the command:
NY-R1>enable
NY-R1#config term
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
NY-R1(config)#ip host BOS-R1 24.0.0.2
Now verify that the entry has been added to the hostname table by using the 
show hosts command from priv exec mode.
NY-R1(config)#exit
NY-R1#show hosts
Default Domain is not set
Name/address lookup uses domain service
Name servers are 255.255.255.255
Codes: UN - unknown, EX - expired, OK - OK, ?? - revalidate
       temp - temporary, perm - permanent
       NA - Not Applicable None - Not defined
Host     Port  Flags      Age Type   Address(es)
BOS-R1   None  (perm, OK)  0   IP    24.0.0.2
NY-R1#
Notice in the preceding code that the entry in the hostname table for BOS-R1 
is flagged as a permanent entry (perm), with an IP address of 24.0.0.2. 
A permanent entry is an entry that has been manually added by you and is 
stored there permanently. The opposite of a permanent entry is a temporary 
entry, which is placed in the hostname table as a result of a DNS query and 

274
Implementing Network Services
then cached in the hostname table so future queries do not have to occur. 
They call it a temporary entry because it is only cached in the hostname 
table for a limited amount of time (72 hours from last use by default).
Now that the entry is added to the hostname table, try to communicate with 
the Boston router by its name.
NY-R1#ping BOS-R1
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 24.0.0.2, timeout is 2 
seconds:
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 
15/25/32 ms
Notice in the preceding example that I was able to ping the router by name 
this time because the router looks to the hostname table to figure out the IP 
address of BOS-R1.
If you decide that you need to remove an entry from the hostname table, 
you can negate the command with the no keyword at the beginning of the 
command. The following code removes the Boston router’s name from the 
hostname table:
NY-R1#config term
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
NY-R1(config)#no ip host BOS-R1
Verify that the entry has been deleted by using the show hosts command 
again and you should notice that the entry has been removed.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, be sure to know how to view the hostname 
table and how to add and remove entries from the hostname table.
Configuring domain name service
If you would rather not configure a name table on your Cisco device, you 
can configure your Cisco router to point to the DNS (domain name service) 
server on your network to do the hostname resolution for the device.
In order to configure your Cisco device to perform DNS lookups, you use 
the ip domain-lookup command first. Actually, ip domain-lookup is a 
default command, so you do not have to use the command unless you have 
disabled domain lookups with the no ip domain-lookup command.
NY-R1(config)#ip domain-lookup

Book II
Chapter 4
Advanced Router 
Topics
275
Implementing Network Services
Once you enable domain name lookups, you must then specify the IP 
address of the DNS server to which you wish to send DNS queries (the 
lookups). To configure your router for a specific DNS server, use the ip 
name-server command, as follows:
NY-R1(config)#ip name-server 23.0.0.200
Once you configure your router to send DNS queries to a specific name 
server, you can set the optional setting of your domain name. This domain 
name is automatically appended to any hostnames that you use, to create 
a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). (Review Book I, Chapter 3 for more 
details on FQDN.) To set the domain name on the router, use the following 
command:
NY-R1(config)#ip domain-name gleneclarke.com
That is it! Once you use these few commands on your router, the router 
sends hostname (DNS) queries to the DNS server you specify. The following 
summarizes the commands used:
NY-R1>enable
NY-R1#config term
NY-R1(config)#ip domain-lookup
NY-R1(config)#ip name-server 23.0.0.200
NY-R1(config)#ip domain-name gleneclarke.com
Now when you try to communicate with a system by name, your router 
queries the DNS server for the IP address of the hostname you are trying to 
communicate with. Once the DNS server sends the address to your router, 
your router caches the address by storing the hostname and IP address in 
the hostname table as a temporary address (versus a permanent address). 
The benefit is when you communicate with that hostname a second time, the 
name is resolved from the hostname table (if the temporary address has not 
timed out) and not by querying the DNS server. This cuts down on traffic to the 
DNS server. The temporary entry stored in the hostname table is removed 
after 72 hours of not being used by default.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, make sure you are familiar with how to 
configure your device to query a DNS server.
If you need to verify that you have configured your router for DNS name 
resolution to a name server, you can use the show hosts command. When 
looking at the results of the show hosts command, notice that, above the 
hostname table, there are settings displaying other name resolution configu-
ration settings, as shown in the following example:

276
Implementing Network Services
NY-R1#show hosts
Default Domain is gleneclarke.com
Name/address lookup uses domain service
Name servers are 23.0.0.200
Codes: UN - unknown, EX - expired, OK - OK, ?? - revalidate
       temp - temporary, perm - permanent
       NA - Not Applicable None - Not defined
Host     Port  Flags      Age Type   Address(es)
BOS-R1   None  (perm, OK)  0   IP    24.0.0.2
 
Although you can create a hostname table on each router on your network, 
it is more practical to use your DNS server on the network for name resolution. 
If you are using a DNS server, when you add or modify any names on the 
DNS server, the entire network is aware of the change, including all routers 
that point to the DNS server. This gives you a central point of administration, 
whereas working with the hostname table on each router is a decentralized 
approach.
Configuring DHCP services
A very popular network service is Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), 
which is responsible for assigning IP addresses to systems on the network. 
Most companies install and configure DHCP on their Windows or Linux 
server, allowing it to assign IP addresses to systems on the network. The 
great thing about your Cisco router is that it can act as the DHCP server if 
you want to use it as a backup plan if something were to go wrong with your 
Windows or Linux DHCP feature. You can even use the DHCP feature on 
your Cisco router when you need to bring your Windows server down for 
maintenance. 
The first step to configuring DHCP on your router is to create a DHCP 
address pool and give it a name. A pool is a list of addresses that the DHCP 
server is allowed to give out to DHCP clients on the network. The following 
command creates a pool:
NY-R1(config)#ip dhcp pool NY_Network
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#
Notice in the preceding code that I created a pool named NY_Network, and 
when the command executes, I am moved into the DHCP prompt. You can 
identify the DHCP prompt by the (dhcp-config).
After you specify that you wish to create a DHCP pool, your next step is to 
specify the network range of IP addresses that the DHCP server is to use 
when handing out addresses. The following command configures the router 
to give out addresses for the 23.0.0.0 network:

Book II
Chapter 4
Advanced Router 
Topics
277
Implementing Network Services
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#network 23.0.0.0 255.0.0.0
After you specify the network range of addresses that the DHCP-configured 
router is allowed to give out, you then specify additional settings, such 
as the default gateway address (the router address) and the DNS server that 
the DHCP server is to hand out to clients. Configuring these options on the 
DHCP server ensures that the clients point to the DNS server for name 
resolution and point to the router as the default gateway after receiving an 
address from the DHCP pool. You can also specify the domain name for the 
clients through the DHCP settings. To configure these settings, use the 
following commands:
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#default-router 23.0.0.1
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#domain-name gleneclarke.com
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#dns-server 23.0.0.200
After configuring the default gateway and DNS server settings, you next 
specify the length of the lease period for the addresses. When a client receives 
an IP address from the DHCP server (or in this case, the DHCP-enabled router), 
it receives the address for a limited amount of time (known as the lease 
duration). As the administrator, you determine what the lease duration time 
is with the following command:
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#lease 7 0 0
When specifying the lease duration with the lease command, you have 
three parameters — you can specify the number of days, then hours, and 
finally minutes. In the preceding code example, I have specified a lease time 
of seven days. (The default is one day if you do not specify a lease time.)
Once you configure the lease time, the next setting you will most likely 
configure is the one that excludes addresses. An excluded address falls into 
the network range that you do not want the DHCP server to give. There 
are many reasons you may not want some addresses given out — some 
addresses might be statically assigned to a server, printers, or network 
devices such as routers and switches. The following commands exclude the 
first 15 addresses on the 23.0.0.0 network so that I can use most of those 
for the server, switches, and printers.
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#exit
NY-R1(config)#ip dhcp excluded-address 23.0.0.1 23.0.0.15
NY-R1(config)#
Notice in the preceding code example that to exclude addresses in a range, 
you don’t use a (dhcp-config) prompt command — you need to exit 
out and go back to global configuration mode and specify the excluded 
addresses as an option on the ip command.

278
Implementing Network Services
The following code summarizes all of the commands that enable the DHCP 
server feature on your Cisco router:
NY-R1(config)#ip dhcp pool NY_Network
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#network 23.0.0.0 255.0.0.0
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#default-router 23.0.0.1
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#domain-name gleneclarke.com
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#dns-server 23.0.0.200
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#lease 7 0 0
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#exit
NY-R1(config)#ip dhcp excluded-address 23.0.0.1 23.0.0.15
Once you configure DHCP on your router, you can use the show ip dhcp 
binding command to view the list of addresses your router has given out to 
clients on the network. Notice in the output below that you can see the MAC 
address of the client that has received a particular address.
NY-R1>show ip dhcp binding
IP address  Client-ID       Lease expiration  Type
23.0.0.16   0009.7C57.5674  --                Automatic
 
In order for the router to hand addresses over to clients via the DHCP service, 
the DHCP service needs to be running. The service should be running by 
default, but when troubleshooting DHCP, make sure that it has been enabled — 
use the service dhcp command. You can disable DHCP at any point in 
time with the no service dhcp command.
When troubleshooting DHCP, you can use the show ip dhcp binding 
command to display the list of addresses that the service has given out. You 
can also use the show ip dhcp server statistics command to display 
the number of DHCP-related messages sent and received by the DHCP server.
 
If you need more help troubleshooting DHCP, you can enable debugging on 
DHCP-related events with the debug ip dhcp server command.
Implementing Network Address Translation
One of the most popular network services is Network Address Translation 
(NAT). The purpose of NAT is to allow you to use your own IP scheme, such 
as a private address range, inside the network and have those systems 
access the Internet using the public IP address on the NAT-enabled router. 
Let’s look at the network diagram in Figure 4-2 to understand NAT.
When looking at Figure 4-2, notice that the FastEthernet0/0 interface 
(known as F0/0) is connected to the Internet and has the IP address of 
24.138.20.10. Notice that the FastEthernet0/1 interface (known as 
F0/1) is connected to the 10.0.0.0 network and has a private address of 
10.0.0.1. All systems on the LAN are in the 10.0.0.0/8 private network 
range and have a default gateway set to the 10.0.0.1 address of the router.

From a terminology point of view, the F0/0 interface connected to the 
Internet is known as the public interface, or outside interface, because it is 
connected to a public network (the Internet). The F0/1 interface is known 
as the private interface, or inside interface, because it is connected to the 
private internal network.
Understanding how NAT works
The concept of NAT is that a system on the network sends the packet to 
the NAT-enabled router (default gateway) when the system tries to connect 
to the Internet. The NAT device removes the source IP address from the 
packet, places its public address (24.138.20.10, in this case) in the source 
IP field of the packet, and then sends the packet out on the Internet.
The benefit of using NAT is that all the systems on the network connect 
to the Internet using one public address — this gives you a cost benefit 
because you do not need to purchase multiple public addresses. The other 
benefit is seen from a security point of view; anyone on the Internet who 
views the packet believes the originator of the packet is the NAT device. 
If a hacker tries to attack the source of the packet, he is attacking the NAT 
device and not the system inside the network. By using NAT, you are 
essentially hiding the internal structure of your network.
After the NAT device removes the private address from the source IP 
address field and places the public address of the NAT device in its place, it 
stores this information in its translation table (a table in memory that stores 
the private-to-public address mappings). This way, when the destination 
system on the Internet sends a reply, the NAT-enabled router can translate 
and send the information back. Let’s look at how this works.

280
Implementing Network Services
When reading this example, compare Figure 4-2 with the information displayed 
in Table 4-1. When the client using the 10.0.0.10 address sends traffic to a 
Web site on the Internet (say www.gleneclarke.com), the packet reaches 
the NAT-enabled router. As mentioned earlier, the NAT-enabled router strips 
out the source IP address and places the IP address of the public interface in 
its place. (This is known as the translated IP.) Most implementations of NAT 
also replace the original source port in the packet with a new, unique port 
value (called the translated port) tracked by the NAT-enabled router. The 
NAT device then stores this information in the translation table on the NAT 
device so that when a reply message comes back from the Internet, the NAT 
device knows which system to send the reply to.
Table 4-1

80
Looking at Table 4-1, you see that two different IP addresses are surfing the 
same Web site (destination port 80 on destination IP 216.83.10.20). The 
NAT device translates the source IP addresses of each of those outbound 
packets to use the public interface IP address (24.138.20.10). The important 
part to remember here is that the NAT device takes the source port in the 
packet (in this case, the port number that the browser uses) and translates 
it to a unique source port number. This way, when the Web site replies back 
to port 5001, the NAT device looks in the translation table and asks itself, 
“Who has port 5001? That is who I need to send this reply back to.”
 
NAT overloading (see the next section) is possible because of Port Address 
Translation (PAT), which is a form of NAT that translates not only the source 
address but the source port address as well.
The NAT device finds out from the translation table that the system with 
the IP address of 10.0.0.10 is the one that the reply needs to go to, so it 
translates all of the addresses back on the reply message.
Examining two types of NAT
The example in the previous section is a very popular implementation of 
NAT, but it is not the only type of NAT. The example in the previous section 
is based on the concept that all network clients are using the one public IP 
address to connect to the Internet. This is known as overloading. Most NAT 
devices, such as D-Link or Linksys home routers and most network servers 
that implement NAT, use overloading. The benefit of overloading is all 

Book II
Chapter 4
Advanced Router 
Topics
281
Implementing Network Services
systems use the one IP address, so you are required to have only one public 
IP address.
Another form of NAT is known as static NAT. With static NAT, you map one 
internal address to one public address on the NAT device. If you want to 
allow ten inbound connections to ten systems on the network, you need to 
have ten public addresses and statically assign each public address to one 
of the private addresses. 
 
For the CCENT certification exam, understand that static NAT is mapping one 
public IP address to one private address, while NAT overloading is mapping 
all private addresses to the one public address.
Implementing NAT overloading
Using the earlier Figure 4-2 as the example, if you want to enable NAT 
on router NY-R1, the FastEthernet0/0 interface with the IP address of 
24.138.20.10 will be the public interface that is overloaded (meaning 
multiple clients will translate to that one address) and the FastEthernet0/1 
interface will act as the internal interface.
To configure NAT, the first thing you need to do is create an access list 
containing the range of addresses that are allowed to use NAT. This is 
typically the IP range that the internal network uses — in this example, it is 
the 10.0.0.0 network range.
NY-R1(config)#Access-list 1 permit 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
Here is what you need to know about the preceding code: 
 
✦ The access-list command creates an access list. 
 
✦ You can use access lists in many different features within the Cisco 
world, so realistically, you create many access lists on the router. 
 
✦ Each access list needs a unique number — in this example, I created 
access list 1. 
 
✦ The word permit in the code allows the address range to do something. 
(We do not know what we are allowing until we use the access list.) 
 
✦ The address range is specified by the network range (in this case, 
10.0.0.0) and then a wildcard mask (not a subnet mask, which I 
discuss in Book I, Chapter 4). 
 
✦ The wildcard mask (in this case, 0.255.255.255) identifies which parts 
of the address you supplied that you actually want the router to verify. 
If a wildcard mask octet has a 0, it means you want Cisco to verify that 
octet in the source IP address of the packet against the octet in the rule. 
If an octet has a 255, that means you want Cisco not to worry about the 
value of that octet when checking the source address of the packet. In 

282
Implementing Network Services
the example here, you want to ensure that the entire 10.0.0.0 network 
can use NAT, so 0.255.255.255 means verify the octet against the rule.
ignore this octet.ignore this octet.ignore this octet.
 
The CCENT certification exam does not cover access lists; therefore, you 
do not need to know about them for the exam. I mention them here only 
because access lists are used with NAT and a quick explanation is needed 
to understand the code. Access lists can get pretty complicated. They are 
actually done at the bit level and not the octet level, as I describe in the 
preceding text — just makes for an easier explanation! You will need to know 
access lists, however, for your CCNA exam!
After you create the access list, which permits the IP range to perform an 
action, you need to list that group of addresses as being a list of valid source 
addresses that can use NAT. Here’s how you do that:
NY-R1(config)#ip nat inside source list 1 interface 
FastEthernet 0/0 overload
To better understand the command in the preceding code, I recommend 
breaking it into these three parts: 
 
✦ ip nat: Enables NAT on the router.
 
✦ inside source list 1: Flags access list 1 as a valid list of source 
addresses that can use NAT. 
 
✦ interface FastEthernet 0/0 overload: Specifies that you want to 
overload the FastEthernet0/0 interface.
Once you configure the NAT with the ip nat global configuration command, 
you then need to navigate to each interface and specify its role in the NAT 
scenario — whether the interface is the inside interface or the outside interface. 
The following commands configure the two Fast Ethernet interfaces for NAT:
NY-R1(config)#interface FastEthernet0/0
NY-R1(config-if)#ip nat outside
NY-R1(config-if)#interface FastEthernet0/1
NY-R1(config-if)#ip nat inside
The following summarizes the commands needed to configure NAT in the 
example shown in Figure 4-2:
NY-R1(config)#Access-list 1 permit 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
NY-R1(config)#ip nat inside source list 1 interface 
FastEthernet 0/0 overload
NY-R1(config)#interface FastEthernet0/0

Once you configure NAT, the router translates the source address of all 
packets sent from the 10.0.0.0 network to use the public address assigned 
to interface FastEthernet0/0.
 
You can view the NAT address translation table with the show ip nat 
translations command in priv exec mode!
Understanding Password Recovery Procedures
The next topic that I discuss in this chapter covers the procedures you use 
to recover passwords on Cisco devices. The procedures are a little different 
with each router and switch model, but the general concepts are always the 
same. This section discusses the concepts involved with password recovery 
and gives you the steps to recover passwords on two different router 
models.
Configuration registers
Configuration registers on a Cisco device are an important concept to 
understand. A configuration register is a 16-bit value stored in NVRAM, and 
it is responsible for controlling how your Cisco device boots. In Book II, 
Chapter 1, you find out about the boot process of a Cisco device, and you 
discover that the IOS is loaded from flash memory before the startup 
configuration is loaded from NVRAM — this is all because the configuration 
register is configured to tell the device which boot process to follow.
The configuration register has a default value of 0x2102, which tells the 
device to boot the IOS from flash memory and load the startup configuration. 
Here’s a breakdown of where the 0x2102 value comes from: The first thing 
to identify is the 0x at the beginning of the value; the 0x signifies that the 
value is a hexadecimal value. For this discussion, I remove the 0x and just 
work with the 2102, but understand that when you use the commands to 
configure the configuration register, you must supply the 0x. Figure 4-3 
displays the 16 bits of a register and highlights some of the important bits 
for this discussion.
Notice in Figure 4-3 that the 16 bits are labeled 0 through 15 from right to 
left, with each bit representing a certain feature that controls the boot pro-
cess. For example, bit 8 disables break mode, while bit 6 is used to ignore 
the contents of NVRAM when enabled.

Also notice that the 16 bits are divided into four, 4-bit blocks — each 4-bit 
block is a nibble. Yes, 8 bits makes a byte, while 4 bits is only a nibble! The 
values associated with each of the four bits in a nibble are as follows:
 
✦ The far-right bit in a nibble has a value of 1.
 
 Referencing Figure 4-3 and using the nibble of bits 15 through 12 as an 
example, bit 12 has a value of 1.
 
✦ The next bit to the left has a value of 2.
 
 Referencing Figure 4-3 and using the nibble of bits 15 through 12 as an 
example, bit 13 has a value of 2.
 
✦ The third bit to the left has a value of 4.
 
 Referencing Figure 4-3 and using the nibble of bits 15 through 12 as an 
example, bit 14 has a value of 4.
 
✦ The final bit to the right in a nibble has a value of 8.
 
 Referencing Figure 4-3 and using the nibble of bits 15 through 12 as an 
example, bit 15 has a value of 8.
After enabling the different bits to turn on the boot features you want, you 
then convert each nibble to a decimal value by adding the values of the 
enabled bits. For example, in Figure 4-3 you can see that bits 13, 8, and 1 
are enabled. So when you convert that to decimal, the first nibble is 2; the 
second nibble is 1; the third nibble has no bits enabled, so it has a decimal 
value of 0; and the last nibble on the right has a decimal value of 2. This 
gives you a configuration register value of 2102.

Bit meanings
Although you do not have to be familiar with all the different configuration 
register bits for the CCENT certification exam, Table 4-2 is a quick description 
of the different bits. If a bit is missing from the list, that means you combine 
other bits to get that value and combine the meaning of those bits.
Table 4-2

Boot field
The first four bits on the far-right side (refer to Figure 4-3) are important to 
stress, as these bits represent the boot field. The boot field controls how the 
IOS is loaded on the device during boot up.
 
✦ 0: If the boot field has a value of 0, the Cisco device boots to ROM 
Monitor mode (ROMMON) which troubleshoots issues with your Cisco 
device and performs tasks such as changing the configuration registers 
or downloading an IOS image file. When booted to ROM Monitor mode, 
the prompt displays rommon>. The configuration register in this example 
is 2100.
 
✦ 1: If the boot field is set to 1, the Cisco device boots the mini-IOS image 
stored in ROM, known as RX-boot. When the device is booted to this 
mini-IOS, the prompt changes to router(boot)>. The configuration 
register in this example is 2101.
 
✦ 2 to F: If the boot field has a value from 2 to F, it references an IOS image 
file from flash memory. The configuration register in this example is in 
the 2102 to 210F range.

Understanding Password Recovery Procedures
Working with the registers
To view the current configuration value, you use the show version command 
or watch for the value on startup. In both cases, the configuration register is 
shown at the end of the output, as you can see here:
NY-R1>show version
Cisco IOS Software, 2800 Software (C2800NM-
ADVIPSERVICESK9-M), Version 12.4(15)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE 
(fc2)
Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport
(Output cut for briefness)
2 FastEthernet/IEEE 802.3 interface(s)
2 Low-speed serial(sync/async) network interface(s)
239K bytes of NVRAM.
62720K bytes of processor board System flash (Read/Write)
Configuration register is 0x2102
 
At the bottom of the output for the show version command, you see the 
current configuration register value. I highly recommend that you make a 
note of it (write it down) before making a change to the configuration 
register so that you can switch it back to its original value when needed.
In order to change the configuration register, you use the config-register 
command and supply the new value with the 0x at the beginning of the value 
to indicate a hexadecimal address:
NY-R1>enable
NY-R1#config term
NY-R1(config)#config-register 0x2101
Once you change the configuration register, if you use the show version 
command again you will notice that you are currently still using the old 
configuration value until you reboot.
NY-R1(config)#exit
NY-R1#show version

Understanding Password Recovery Procedures
In order to have the new value take effect, you need to type the reload 
command to reboot the router.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, you need to know the default configuration 
register is 2102 and that you can change the configuration register with the 
config-register command. You can also view the current configuration 
register with the show version command.
Password recovery
Now that you are familiar with the configuration register, let’s talk about 
password recovery. Again, the details of password recovery are a little 
different with each different Cisco device model, so this discussion is 
designed to give you a general idea of the process to take.
When you forget your password that you set on your Cisco device, you need 
to boot the Cisco device without loading the startup configuration because 
that is where the password information is stored. The startup configuration 
is stored in NVRAM, so you need to enable bit 6 in the configuration register 
because that is the “ignore NVRAM” setting (as you see in Table 4-2 earlier 
in the chapter). This way, when you boot the router it will not try to load 
NVRAM and, as a result, you will not have passwords in effect! The following 
outlines the steps to reset a password on a Cisco router:
 
1. Make a note of the current configuration register value (see the 
previous section), and then reboot the router.
 
 The configuration register is most likely 0x2102.
 
2. When you boot the router, press Ctrl-Break right away.
 
 This interrupts the boot process and sends you to the ROM Monitor 
(ROMMON) prompt, where you can alter the configuration register.
 
3. Enable bit 6 in the configuration register, which gives you a value of 
0x2142.
 
 Remember, bit 6 configures the router to skip loading the startup 
configuration.
 
4. Type reset to reboot the router. When the router reboots type no 
when prompted to continue with the configuration dialog.
 
5. When the router reboots, copy the startup-config to the running-config 
so you have a workable copy of the configuration; to do this, type 
copy startup-config running-config.
 
6. View the running-config file to see the passwords that are set.
 
 You will be unable to view the secret because it is encrypted, so you are 
going to have to reset it.
 
7. Change any passwords that need changing.

288
Understanding Password Recovery Procedures
 
 For example, because you cannot view the secret, you can change it with 
the enable secret <newvalue> command.
 
8. Change the configuration register back to the original value.
 
9. Before you reboot your router, copy the running-config to the 
startup-config.
 
 You need to do this because the new passwords are in the running-config, 
and you need the device to be in the startup-config so that when you 
reload the router the new passwords are in effect.
 
10. Reboot the router with a reload command.
Before I leave this topic, I want to take the general steps in the preceding list 
and convert them to specific steps for popular router models. I first review 
the steps on the older 2500-series routers, and then the newer 2600-series 
routers.
Recovering passwords on 2500-series routers
The following are the detailed steps to recover a password when you are 
locked out of your Cisco 2500-series router:
 
1. Make a note of the current configuration register value, and then 
reboot the router.
 
 The configuration register is most likely 0x2102.
 
2. When you boot the router, press Ctrl-Break right away to interrupt the 
boot process.
 
 The prompt should display with a >.
 
3. To change the configuration register so that NVRAM is skipped, type 
o/r 0x2142 after >.
 
 The line of code should look like >o/r 0x2142.
 
4. To reload the router, type i after the >.
 
 The line of code should look like >i.
 
5. Navigate to priv exec mode, and copy the startup configuration to the 
running configuration.
Router>enable
Router#copy startup-config running-config
 
6. View the running-config to see the passwords that are set.
 
 You will be unable to view the secret because it is encrypted, so you 
have to reset it.

NY-R1(config)#enable secret <new_value>
 
8. Change the configuration register back to the original value.
NY-R1(config)#config-register 0x2102
 
9. Before you reboot your router, copy the running-config to the 
startup-config.
 
 You need to do this because the new passwords are in the 
running-config. You need it to be in the startup-config so that 
when you reload the router, the new passwords are in effect.
NY-R1(config)#exit
NY-R1#copy running-config startup-config
 
10. Reboot the router with a reload command.
Recovering passwords on 2600-series routers
The following are the detailed steps to recover passwords on a Cisco 
2600-series router:
 
1. Make a note of the current configuration register value, and then 
reboot the router.
 
 The configuration register is most likely 0x2102.
 
2. When you boot the router, press Ctrl-Break right away to interrupt the 
boot process.
 
 You should be placed in the ROM monitor prompt, which appears as 
rommon 1>.
 
3. Change the configuration register so that NVRAM is skipped — type 
confreg 0x2142 after rommon 1>.
 
 The line of code should look like rommon 1>confreg 0x2142.
 
4. To reload the router, type reset.
 
5. When the router reloads, choose no to the configuration dialog and 
navigate to priv exec mode. Copy the startup configuration to the run-
ning configuration.

NY-R1(config)#enable secret <new_value>
 
8. Change the configuration register back to the original value.

10. Reboot the router with a reload command.
Using the Security Device Manager
The Cisco Security Device Manager (SDM) is a Web-based graphical interface 
you can use to configure most settings on your Cisco router. This section is 
designed to expose you to the SDM and give you the step-by-step instructions 
to perform popular configuration tasks with the SDM. This section is not 
designed to give you details on each of the topics as you have already found 
out about the topics in the appropriate chapters. Think of this section as a 
guided tour of the very cool Cisco feature — the Security Device Manager!
Configuring Security Device Manager
To enable SDM on your router you need to do a little prep work first. You 
must configure the router to support Web applications (enable the HTTP 
and HTTPS services) and authentication through the Web application (Web 
site). You must also create a user account that has administrative access to 
the router (known as privilege level 15), and then configure console, Telnet, 
and SSH access to the router using the local accounts on the router. Let’s get 
started!
 
1. Ensure that the HTTP and HTTPS servers are running and access to 
the Web server can be gained by using an account in the local user 
account database on the router by using the following commands:

Book II
Chapter 4
Advanced Router 
Topics
291
Using the Security Device Manager
NY-R1(config)#ip http server
NY-R1(config)#ip http secure-server
NY-R1(config)#ip http authentication local
 
2. Create a user account that has privilege access to the router. Privilege 
access is the term for having full access to the router. The following 
commands are used to ensure that you have a privilege account you 
can log on to the SDM site with:
NY-R1(config)#username glen privilege 15 password 0 
glenpass
 
 The command creates an account called glen that has the highest level 
of privileges (privilege level 15) with a password of glenpass. The 0 in 
front of glenpass specifies that the password is not encrypted.
 
3. With the privilege level user account create, you now specify that the 
account can be used for console access and Telnet (or SSH) access if 
you like. The following commands are used to configure the console 
port and Telnet ports for local authentication:
NY-R1(config)#line con 0
NY-R1(config-line)#login local
NY-R1(config-line)#exit
NY-R1(config)#line vty 0 4
NY-R1(config-line)#privilege level 15
NY-R1(config-line)#login local
NY-R1(config-line)#transport input telnet ssh 
NY-R1(config-line)#exit
 
4. Connect to SDM from a Web browser by typing https://<ip_
address_of_router> in your browser.
 
5. You may receive a security alert letting you know that the certificate 
on the site is untrusted and does not match the name of the site. You 
are only getting this message because you have created your own 
secure site with the ip http secure-server command. You can 
choose Yes to continue.
 
6. The SDM software starts loading and may take a few minutes (see 
Figure 4-4).
 
7. You are then prompted for a username and password to access the 
site — use the username and password you created in Step 2.
 
8. After logging in, the SDM interface loads in the browser and you are 
ready to configure your router with SDM (see Figure 4-5). 
 
It is important to note that while there are a wealth of settings you can 
change through the SDM, this chapter is focused on giving you the basic 
steps to use the SDM for configuration changes required by the CCENT 
certification exam.

Basic router configuration using SDM
Now that you have the SDM running, this section shows you how to use the 
SDM to configure a serial port, Ethernet port, and to change the hostname of 
your router.
Configuring a serial interface
You can configure a serial interface in much the same way as configuring an 
Ethernet interface. The following steps outline how to use the SDM to modify 
the serial interface.
 
1. If you are not connected to the SDM, launch SDM by connecting to 
your router through a Web browser.
 
2. Within the SDM, click the Configure button at the top and then select 
Interfaces and Connections on the left.
Cisco Privilege Levels
One of the topics not covered by the CCENT 
certification exam — but one I want to make 
note of — is the privilege levels on Cisco 
devices. There are 16 levels of privileges within 
the Cisco IOS numbered 0–15, with privilege 
level 15 being the highest level. The higher the 
privilege level an administrator has, the more 
administrative rights to the device the admin-
istrator has.
Most network administrators are aware of two 
privilege levels without really knowing it — 
level 1 and level 15. Level 1 is the privilege level 
you receive when in user exec mode, while 
level 15 is the privilege level you receive when 
you are in priv exec mode. This is why you need 
to be in priv exec mode to make changes — 
you have privilege level 15 in that mode and can 
perform any administrative functions.
The cool point to make is that when you create 
your user accounts on the Cisco device you can 
assign the account a privilege level. Once the 
account has been assigned the privilege level, 
that user can execute any commands associated 
with that level (commands have levels 
associated with them as well). The command 
to create a user account and assign a privilege 
level to that account is:
NY-R1(config)#username myadmin 
privilege 3 password mypass
You can also change the privilege level 
required by a command by using the 
privilege exec command. For example, if 
I want to require privilege level 3 to execute the 
show startup-config command I use 
the following command:
NY-R1(config)#privilege exec 
level 3 show startup-config
One last note I want to make is that you can 
view the privilege level you have with the show 
privilege command. There is a lot more to 
privileges on Cisco devices so spend some time 
researching the topic and experimenting!

Viewing interface status
Once you configure your interfaces on the Cisco router you can use the SDM 
to view the status of the interfaces and change their settings without running 
through the wizard a second time. The following steps demonstrate how to 
view and modify the settings on an interface.
  
1. If you are not connected to the SDM, launch SDM by connecting to 
your router through a Web browser.

298
Using the Security Device Manager
 
2. Within the SDM, click the Configure button at the top and then select 
Interfaces and Connections on the left.
 
3. To view the status on the interfaces click the Edit Interface/
Connection tab (see Figure 4-12).
 
Figure 4-12:

interface and whether the interface is up or down. To modify the 
settings on an interface simply double-click on the interface.
 
5. Make your changes.
 
6. Click OK to complete the changes on the interface.
Configuring hostname
Another example setting you can modify on the router through the SDM is 
the hostname of the router. The following outlines the steps to modify the 
hostname on the router:
 
1. If you are not connected to the SDM, launch SDM by connecting to 
your router through a Web browser.
 
2. Within the SDM, click the Configure button at the top and then select 
Additional Tasks on the left.

the top of the window and you should see the device properties (such 
as hostname) display on the right side of the screen.
 
4. To modify the device properties click the Edit button on the right side 
of the screen.
 
5. Modify the property you wish to change and then click OK to complete 
the changes.
Configuring DHCP using SDM
As you found out earlier in this chapter you can configure your router with 
a DHCP service that allows it to assign IP addresses to client systems on the 
network. The following outlines the steps to configure DHCP on your router 
using the SDM:
 
1. If you are not connected to the SDM, launch SDM by connecting to 
your router through a Web browser.
 
2. Within the SDM, click the Configure button at the top and then select 
Additional Tasks on the left.
 
3. From the Additional Tasks listing, expand the DHCP folder and 
choose DHCP Pools.
 
4. Click the Add button on the right-hand side to add a DHCP pool (the 
range of addresses your router is to hand out to clients).
 
5. In the Add DHCP Pool window that appears, fill in the following 
information:
 
• DHCP Pool Name: Give a friendly name to the DHCP pool such as 
Priv_LAN.
 
• DHCP Pool Network and Subnet mask: Specify the network ID and 
subnet mask for the DHCP pool.
 
• Starting IP and Ending IP address: Specify the starting IP address and 
ending IP address for the range of addresses the router is to hand 
out to clients.
 
• Lease Length: Specify how long clients are allowed to use the IP 
address.
 
• DHCP Options: You can configure additional IP settings for the DHCP 
service to hand out, such as the default router address or DNS server 
settings.
 
6. When you finish filling in the dialog box, click OK.

Configuring RIP using SDM
In Book III, Chapter 2, you find out about RIP as a routing protocol and how 
to configure RIP with the CLI. Although you have not read about RIP yet, I 
thought I would place the steps for configuring RIP through the SDM here so 
that all SDM tasks are located in the same area of the book. This step-by-step 
will make more sense once you read about RIP — so come back to it after 
reading Book III, Chapter 2.
To configure RIP through the SDM use the following steps:
 
1. If you are not connected to the SDM, launch SDM by connecting to 
your router through a Web browser.
 
2. Within the SDM, click the Configure button at the top and then select 
Routing on the left (see Figure 4-13).
 
Figure 4-13: 
Configuring 
routing 
through the 
SDM.
 
 
3. Notice the Dynamic Routing section at the bottom of the screen — 
click the Edit button that appears on the right side of this section.
 
4. In the Edit IP Dynamic Routing dialog box, choose to enable RIP and 
specify the version of RIP you would like to use (see Figure 4-14).

5. In the IP Network List section, click the Add button to add the network 
IDs that RIP is to broadcast knowledge of.
 
6. In the Available Interface List section, ensure any interfaces you wish 
to have RIP messages sent out have the Make the Interface Passive 
check box cleared.
 
 A passive interface does not send RIP messages out the interface — a 
great option for the interface that is connected to the Internet.
 
7. Click OK.
Configuring NAT using SDM
This chapter has shown you how to configure NAT through the CLI, so now 
I want to show you the steps to configure NAT through the Security Device 
Manager. The following steps outline how to configure NAT through the SDM:
 
1. If you are not connected to the SDM, launch SDM by connecting to 
your router through a Web browser.
 
2. Within the SDM, click the Configure button at the top and then select 
the NAT option on the left (see Figure 4-15).

302
Using the Security Device Manager
 
Figure 4-15: 
Configuring 
NAT via the 
SDM.
 
 
3. On the Create NAT Configuration tab you are prompted for whether 
you wish to configure Basic NAT or Advanced NAT; select Basic NAT 
and then click the Launch the Selected Task button.
 
 Basic NAT allows you to configure the Internal list of systems that are to 
receive Internet access through the router (using NAT) while Advanced 
NAT helps you configure the NAT system for some rules that allow 
computers on the Internet to access systems in your DMz.
 
4. A wizard appears summarizing the goals of Basic NAT. You are 
required to choose an interface that is your Internet connection 
(which will be shared) and then choose the network IDs of system that 
can use that shared Internet connection. Make your selections and 
click Next.
 
5. The Sharing Internet Connection screen appears in the wizard (see 
Figure 4-16) where you make the following selections:
 
• At the top of the screen, choose the interface that has the Internet 
connection you wish to share.
 
• At the bottom of the screen, choose the networks that can use that 
Internet connection by selecting the check box next to the network 
range.

Chapter Summary
This chapter illustrates a number of advanced topics, such as implementing 
network services and recovering passwords. The following are some key 
points to remember when preparing for the CCENT certification exam:
 
✦ You can resolve names you use on the router by either the hostname 
table on the router or by querying DNS.
 
✦ Use the ip host command to add a hostname to the hostname table on 
the router.
 
✦ To view the hostname table, use the show hosts command.
 
✦ You can use the ip name-server <IP of DNS server> command 
to configure your router to query a DNS server for hostname resolution.
 
✦ To configure DHCP on your router, you need to use the ip dhcp pool 
command to create an address pool. After you create the address pool, 
you specify the network range of addresses to give out, with the network 
command.
 
✦ Be sure to configure additional settings for the DHCP-enabled router 
to give out on the network. These settings include the default router, 
domain name, and the address of the DNS server.

304
Lab Exercises
 
✦ You use the show ip dhcp binding command to view the IP 
addresses assigned to clients.
 
✦ There are two types of NAT — static NAT and overloading. Static NAT 
associates a single public address to a single private address, while 
overloading is the concept that all private addresses use the one public 
address.
 
✦ When configuring NAT, you need to create an access list that includes 
all the addresses to use as the inside source list.
 
✦ The configuration register is a 16-bit value used to control how the Cisco 
router boots.
 
✦ You can bypass the loading of the startup config by changing the 
configuration register to 0x2142 and then rebooting the router, after 
which you can display or modify the passwords for the router.
Lab Exercises
This chapter introduces a number of different network services — such as 
hostname resolution, DHCP, and network address translation — and also 
addresses password recovery. The following labs provide you with the 
opportunity to get some hands-on experience with the knowledge you have 
gained.
Lab 4-1: Configuring hostname resolution
In this exercise, add two hostnames to the hostname table, and then 
configure your router to query DNS.
 
1. Connect to your router’s console port and add two hostnames to the 
hostname table using the ip host command:
NY-R1>enable
NY-R1#config term
NY-R1(config)#ip host TOR-R1 28.0.0.2
NY-R1(config)#ip host TOR-R2 28.0.0.3
 
2. Display your hostname table with the following commands:
NY-R1(config)#exit
NY-R1#show hosts
 
 Do you see the two entries in the table?

3. To configure your router to query a DNS server, use the following 
commands:
NY-R1#config term
NY-R1(config)#ip domain-lookup
NY-R1(config)#ip name-server 28.0.0.200
NY-R1(config)#ip domain-name lab4.com
 
4. Use the show hosts command again. 
NY-R1(config)#exit
NY-R1#show hosts
 
 Do you see the DNS server information displayed at the top of the 
hostname table?
Lab 4-2: Configuring DHCP on a Cisco router
In this lab, configure your router to assign IP addresses to clients through 
the FastEthernet0/0 port. Connect your Fast Ethernet port to a switch 
that has a few clients connected, and then plan the commands you would 
use to configure NY-R1 as a DHCP server for the 192.168.3.0 network. 
Be sure to give the address of the router and DNS server as part of DHCP 
address assignment to the client. Ensure that you reserve 192.168.3.1 to 
192.168.3.10 and 192.168.3.254.
 
1. In the lines below, plan the commands you would use to configure 
NY-R1 as a DHCP server.

2. Configure DHCP on your router with the configuration you came up 
with in Step 1.
 
 The commands you should have used to configure DHCP in this 
example are
NY-R1(config)#ip dhcp pool NY_Network
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#network 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#default-router 192.168.3.1
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#dns-server 192.168.3.254
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#lease 3 0 0
NY-R1(dhcp-config)#exit
NY-R1(config)#ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.3.1 192.168.3.10
NY-R1(config)#ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.3.254
 
3. Power on a client and verify that the client has received an IP 
address, by using the show ip dhcp binding command.
Lab 4-3: Recovering passwords
In the following, implement password recovery procedures on a Cisco 
2600-series router. If you have a 1700-series router or an ISR router, you can 
use the same steps.
 
1. Find and record the current configuration register value with the 
show version command.
 
2. Power off and then power on the router.
 
3. When you boot the router, press Ctrl-Break right away to interrupt the 
boot process.
 
 You should be placed in the ROM Monitor prompt, which appears as 
rommon 1>.
 
4. Change the configuration register so that NVRAM is skipped, by typing 
confreg 0x2142 after rommon 1>. 
 
 The line of code should look like rommon 1>confreg 0x2142.
 
5. Reload the router by typing reset.
 
6. When the router reloads, choose no to the configuration dialog and 
navigate to priv exec mode.  Copy the startup configuration to the run-
ning configuration.
--- System Configuration Dialog ---
Continue with configuration dialog? [yes/no]: no
Router>enable
Router#copy startup-config running-config
 
7. View the running-config to see the passwords that are set.

 You will be unable to view the secret because it is encrypted, so you 
have to reset it.
 
8. Change any passwords that need changing.
YOURROUTER#config term
YOURROUTER(config)#enable secret <new_value>
 
9. Change the configuration register back to the original value.
YOURROUTER(config)#config-register 0x2102
 
10. Before you reboot your router, copy the running-config to the 
startup-config.
 
 You need to do this because the new passwords are in the running-config, 
and you need it to be in the startup-config so that when you reload the 
router the new passwords are in effect.
YOURROUTER(config)#exit
YOURROUTER#copy running-config startup-config
 
11. Reboot the router with a reload command.

Answers
 1 D. You can use the show hosts command to display the contents of the 
hostname table. See “Configuring hostname tables.”
 2 C. NAT overloading is accomplished by port address translation (PAT) along 
with the address translation feature of NAT. Review “Understanding how NAT 
works.”
 3 A. The ip name-server command configures your router to send name 
queries to a DNS server. Check out “Configuring domain name service.”
 4 B. When trying to bypass a router’s password, you interrupt normal boot 
operations with Ctrl-Break. Peruse “Password recovery.”
 5 D. You resolve the name to the IP address by adding the name to the hostname 
table using the ip host command. Take a look at “Configuring hostname 
tables.”
 6 A. Overloading is a type of NAT that translates all private addresses on the net-
work to the one public address. Overloading is achieved through port address 
translation (PAT). Peek at “Examining two types of NAT.”
 7 C. Most routers are configured for a default register of 0x2102, which specifies 
to load an IOS from flash memory and the startup config from NVRAM. Look 
over “Configuration registers.”
 8 B. The show ip dhcp binding command displays the list of addresses that 
have been leased to clients on the network. Study “Configuring DHCP services.”
 9 C. You will enable bit 6 in the configuration registers to skip loading the 
startup-config from NVRAM. Refer to “Password recovery.”
 10 A. Once you enable bit 6 to omit loading the startup-config, the new value on 
the configuration register will be 0x2142. Examine “Password recovery.”

N
ow that you know how to configure aspects of the router such as the 
IP addresses on the network interfaces, banners, passwords, and 
services such as DHCP, it is time to look at the routing process. (If you are 
not sure about configuring aspects of a router, see Book II before continuing 
with the chapters in this book.)
The purpose of a router is to route, or send, data to another network by 
passing the data off to the router that handles traffic for the other network. 
This chapter discusses the concepts of the routing process and ensures that 
you are familiar with the concept of static routing.

Understanding Routing Concepts
The CCENT certification exam tests you heavily on your knowledge of 
the communication pathway on which information travels; this includes 
information traveling on the LAN and also across the WAN. This chapter is 
designed to ensure you understand the concept of routing and the pathway 
that information travels.
Before I get started with the static routing content, I want to make sure you 
know the scenario — Figure 1-1 displays the network setup for this discussion.
 
Figure 1-1: 
Looking at 
the network 
setup.

Looking at Figure 1-1, you see there are two 2811 routers, named RouterA 
and RouterB. Each router has a Fast Ethernet port with an ID of F0/1, and 
each router has a serial port with the S0/0/0 ID.
Let’s review the configuration commands needed to get this scenario up 
and running. (I cover basic router configuration in more detail in Book II, 
Chapter 2.) The following commands configure RouterA.
Router>enable
Router#config term
Router(config)#hostname RouterA
RouterA(config)#interface f0/1
RouterA(config-if)#ip address 25.0.0.1 255.0.0.0
RouterA(config-if)#no shutdown
10:14:19 %LINK-3-UPDOWN:  Interface FastEthernet0/1, changed 
state to up
10:14:19 %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface 
FastEthernet0/1, changed state to up

Book III
Chapter 1

317
Understanding Routing Concepts
RouterA(config-if)#interface s0/0/0
RouterA(config-if)#ip address 26.0.0.1 255.0.0.0
RouterA(config-if)#encapsulation hdlc
RouterA(config-if)#clock rate 64000
RouterA(config-if)#no shutdown
10:15:10 %LINK-3-UPDOWN:  Interface Serial0/0/0, changed 
state to up
10:15:10 %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface 
Serial0/0/0, changed state to up
Looking at the code, you can see that you first move to privilege exec 
mode and then to global configuration to change the name of the router to 
RouterA. Once you’ve changed the name of the router, you then move to 
interface F0/1 and assign the IP address of 25.0.0.1. Notice that you bring 
the interface online with the no shutdown command.
After you configure the Fast Ethernet port, you then move on to the serial 
port, using the interface s0/0/0 command and assigning an IP address 
of 26.0.0.1. Remember that with serial ports, there are additional commands 
you need to type. For instance, you need to specify the encapsulation 
protocol for the link; in this example, I use HDLC. Because the serial port 
is the DCE device on this point-to-point link (typically used in a classroom 
setting), I need to specify the clock rate before bringing the interface online 
with the no shutdown command. Remember that in real life your router is 
typically the DTE device, so the clock rate is specified by the service provider.
Once you have configured RouterA, it is time to move on and configure 
RouterB. The following commands configure RouterB in this example:
Router>enable
Router#config term
Router(config)#hostname RouterB
RouterB(config)#interface f0/1
RouterB(config-if)#ip address 27.0.0.1 255.0.0.0
RouterB(config-if)#no shutdown
10:21:23 %LINK-3-UPDOWN:  Interface FastEthernet0/1, changed 
state to up
10:21:23 %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface 
FastEthernet0/1, changed state to up
RouterB(config-if)#interface s0/0/0
RouterB(config-if)#ip address 26.0.0.2 255.0.0.0
RouterB(config-if)#encapsulation hdlc
RouterB(config-if)#no shutdown

318
Understanding Routing Concepts
10:21:55 %LINK-3-UPDOWN:  Interface Serial0/0/0, changed 
state to up
10:21:55 %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface 
Serial0/0/0, changed state to up
The commands to configure RouterB are very similar to configuring RouterA. 
Notice that the first thing you do is configure the name of RouterB with the 
hostname command. You then assign an IP address to the Fast Ethernet 
port and bring the interface online. After you bring the Fast Ethernet port 
online, you configure the serial port IP address and the encapsulation 
protocol. Notice on RouterB that the clock rate has not been set.
Once you have completed the configuration on both routers, it is time to test 
the configuration to see what parts of the network can communicate with 
other parts of the network. To test communication, ping from RouterB to the 
serial port on RouterA and then the Fast Ethernet port on RouterA.
Use the following code on RouterB to ping the two ports on RouterA:
RouterB(config-if)#exit
RouterB(config)#exit
RouterB#ping 26.0.0.1
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 26.0.0.1, timeout is 2 
seconds:
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 
4/4/4 ms
RouterB#ping 25.0.0.1
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 25.0.0.1, timeout is 2 
seconds:
.....
Success rate is 0 percent (0/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 
0/0/0 ms
Looking at the preceding commands, the first thing you do on RouterB 
is move back to privilege exec mode (you cannot ping from the interface 
prompt) and then ping the serial interface of RouterA. The ping command 
sends five ICMP echo request messages, and if the system you ping sends 
back echo replies, you know you can communicate with the system. You can 
see that after the ping 26.0.0.1 command, you get !!!!!, which means 
that you have five received echo reply messages. (Each ! is a reply.) 

Book III
Chapter 1
Static Routing
319
The Routing Process
After you ping the serial interface on RouterA, you then try to ping the Fast 
Ethernet port on RouterA with the ping 25.0.0.1 command. Again, look 
to see if you receive echo reply messages with the ! symbol, but notice that 
you do not see ! in the output — there are five periods (.) instead. The 
periods mean no reply was received — this is a problem!
In order to fix this you need to know about the routing process and the fact 
that the routing table is populated with networks that your router is con-
nected to, but not any other networks. You also need to know how to add 
static routes to solve this problem. The rest of this chapter discusses how to 
implement a solution that allows you to ping all networks.
The Routing Process
In order to help you understand why you cannot communicate from 
RouterB to RouterA in the example in the preceding section, I first discuss 
what happens if everything is working out great.
Look at the steps that are taken for ComputerA to send data to ComputerB. 
When you try to send data from ComputerA to ComputerB across a network 
or the Internet, you typically use a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), so 
assume that an FQDN is being used — for example, computerb.glene
clarke.com. The following are the steps that are taken for ComputerA to 
send data to computerb.gleneclarke.com:
 
1. ComputerA queries DNS. When communicating by an FQDN, the 
first step is for the system to query DNS to find out the IP address of 
computerb.gleneclarke.com. ComputerA knows which system to 
send the DNS query to because of its TCP/IP settings. Assume that the 
DNS server has an entry in its DNS database and returns the IP address 
associated with computerb.gleneclarke.com.
 
2. ComputerA ANDs (compares) the IP address of ComputerB. After 
ComputerA receives the IP address, it then compares that against its 
own IP address and subnet mask to determine if ComputerB exists on 
the same network. (This process is called ANDing. To review the ANDing 
process see Book I, Chapter 5.) In this case, ComputerA determines that 
ComputerB exists on a different network because one system’s network 
ID is different from the other’s. Here’s a simplified explanation of what 
happens in this process:
ComputerA IP Address:  25.0.0.10
ComputerA Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0
ComputerB IP Address:  27.0.0.10
ANDing Result: Different Networks!

320
The Routing Process
 
3. ComputerA ARPs RouterA. Once ComputerA knows that the system 
it is trying to talk to resides on a different network, it knows that it has 
to send the data to RouterA so that RouterA can send the data off the 
network. ComputerA receives the IP address of RouterA from its TCP/
IP settings (in this case, it is 25.0.0.1), but in order to send the data to 
RouterA, ComputerA needs to know the MAC address of RouterA.
 
 ComputerA first checks its ARP cache for the MAC address of RouterA, 
and, if the MAC address is in the ARP cache, the system sends the data 
to that MAC address. If the MAC address of RouterA is not in the ARP 
cache, ComputerA has to broadcast an ARP request message out on the 
network to find out the MAC address of the router whose IP address is 
25.0.0.1. For more information on ARP check out Book I, Chapter 4.
 
4. ComputerA sends data to RouterA. When RouterA sees the ARP 
request message, it replies to ComputerA with its MAC address. Once 
ComputerA receives the MAC address of RouterA, it stores that MAC 
address in the ARP cache for future reference and then sends the 
data destined for ComputerB to RouterA. It is important to stress that 
the packet being sent to RouterA at this point has a destination MAC 
address (layer-2 address) set to the MAC address of RouterA, but the 
destination IP address (layer-3 address) is set to the IP address of 
ComputerB. Because RouterA is a layer-3 device, it will use the layer-3 
address to decide what to do with the packet.
 
5. RouterA checks the routing table. When RouterA receives the packet, 
it looks at the packet’s destination address and sees that the packet is 
destined for 27.0.0.10. It then checks its routing table to see if it has 
an entry in the routing table for the 27.0.0.0 network. For this discussion, 
assume that there is an entry in the routing table for the 27.0.0.0 
network, and it references RouterB as the router for that network. (I 
discuss routing tables in the “Viewing the routing table” section later in 
this chapter.)
 
6. RouterA ARPs RouterB. When RouterA knows that it has to send the 
data to RouterB, it needs to find out the MAC address of RouterB, so 
it checks its ARP cache for RouterB’s MAC address. If it does not have 
the MAC address of RouterB in the ARP cache, it sends an ARP request 
(broadcast) out on the serial link for the MAC address of RouterB.
 
7. RouterA sends data to RouterB. Once RouterB receives the ARP request 
message, it sends an ARP reply to RouterA stating its MAC address. 
RouterA stores that MAC address in the ARP cache for future reference 
and then forwards the data on to RouterB. Again, note that the packet’s 
destination MAC address is the MAC address of RouterB, but the 
destination IP address is still the IP address of ComputerB.

Book III
Chapter 1
Static Routing
321
Configuring Routing
 
8. RouterB checks the destination address. When RouterB receives the 
packet from RouterA, it checks the packet’s destination IP address 
and sees that it is destined for 27.0.0.10. RouterB checks to see if it 
has an entry (called a route) for the 27.0.0.0 network in its routing 
table. Again, assume that there is an entry in the routing table for the 
27.0.0.0 so that RouterB knows to send the data out the Fast Ethernet 
port to reach that network.
 
9. RouterB ARPs ComputerB. Before RouterB can send the data to 
ComputerB on the Fast Ethernet port, it first must check the ARP cache 
for the MAC address of 27.0.0.10 (ComputerB). If the MAC address 
of ComputerB does not exist in the ARP cache, RouterB sends an ARP 
request message out the Fast Ethernet port for the MAC address of 
27.0.0.10. 
 
10. RouterB sends data to ComputerB. ComputerB responds to the ARP 
request message with an ARP reply message telling RouterB its MAC 
address. After receiving the MAC address, RouterB updates its ARP 
cache and sends the data to ComputerB. At this point, the destination 
MAC address in the packet is set to the MAC address of ComputerB, and 
the destination IP address is set to the IP address of ComputerB.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, it is important to be very familiar with 
the steps discussed here. Read through the preceding steps a few times and 
constantly refer to Figure 1-1 to help you visualize the steps. Also note that 
when ComputerA sends the data to RouterA, the layer-3 destination address 
is the IP address of ComputerB, but the layer-2 destination address is the 
MAC address of RouterA. Also understand that a reply message would need 
to make its way back and would follow a similar process.
Configuring Routing
In the previous sections, I outline the basic steps that a router goes through 
to forward, or route, data on to the destination network. Now, let’s dive a 
little bit deeper into the details of the routing table. This section discusses 
the routing table and compares connected routes with static routes. You 
also find out how to modify the routing table by adding and deleting your 
own routes.
Viewing the routing table
As I mention earlier in the chapter, a router uses what is called a routing table 
to determine where to forward a packet in order to reach the destination. Each 
entry in the routing table is a destination network that the router knows how 

322
Configuring Routing
to forward data to. The bottom line is if the router does not have a route to a 
particular destination in the routing table, it cannot forward information on 
to that network, and communication cannot occur.
 
The routing table is stored in RAM on the router and maintained through 
reboots by the startup-config.
Let’s take a look at a routing table. To view the routing table on your Cisco 
router, you use the show ip route command in either user exec or priv 
exec mode, as shown in the code example that follows: 
ROUTER87#show ip route
Codes: C - connected, S - static, I - IGRP, R - RIP, ...
(Additional codes omitted for briefness)
Gateway of last resort is not set
S     29.0.0.0 [1/0] via 26.0.0.2
C     26.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0
C     25.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/1
 
If you view a routing table and you do not see connected routes after you 
have configured your interfaces, it could be because routing has been 
disabled on the router with the no ip routing command. To change this, 
type the ip routing command in global configuration mode.
The legend in the output tells you what the codes that follow it mean. You 
can see that C means connected and an S means static.
You can see in the preceding output that there are three routes (destination 
networks) in my routing table. Each route in the routing table starts with 
a code (in this case, either an S or a C) indicating how the route got in the 
routing table. The output for a connected route tells you that the route 
appears in the routing table because you have an interface connected to 
that network. The output for a static route tells you that you have manually 
added that route to the routing table. I explain this in further detail in the 
sections that follow.
Connected routes
When you see C (which means connected) next to a route in the routing 
table, it means that the interface on the router is physically connected to 
that network. The router finds out about connected routes automatically 
once the interface has been configured with an IP address and brought 
online.

Book III
Chapter 1
Static Routing
323
Configuring Routing
To the right of C in a routing table entry, you see the destination network’s 
network ID, as shown here:
C     26.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0
C     25.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/1
Looking at the output, you see that my router has a route to the 26.0.0.0 
and the 25.0.0.0 networks. The /8 portion is the CIDR notation (see Book I, 
Chapter 5, for more information on CIDR) for the subnet mask, which is the 
same thing as saying 255.0.0.0. (8 bits in the subnet mask are enabled.) 
You can also see that the route is known because the router is directly 
connected and it displays which interface is connected to that network. 
In my example, Serial0/0/0 is connected to the 26.0.0.0 network, and 
FastEthernet0/1 is connected to the 25.0.0.0 network.
Static routes
A static route is a route that a network administrator has manually added 
to the routing table. Because there are many networks on a company’s 
internetwork (the multiple network segments connected together), your 
router will not be physically connected to all the networks. This means that 
your router will have entries in the routing table for networks that your 
router is connected to, but you will need to manually add routes for all other 
networks in the company’s internetwork.
Looking at the output again, you can see that I configured my router for one 
static route that references the 29.0.0.0 network.
S     29.0.0.0 [1/0] via 26.0.0.2
Also notice, to the right of the network ID for the destination network of the 
route, [1/0] in the routing table — the 1 that precedes the forward slash 
(/) represents the administrative distance, which is a value that measures 
the trustworthiness of the route. The concept of the administrative distance 
is this: If there are multiple routes to the same network, the router will use 
the one with the lowest administrative distance. Every method that can be 
used to put new routes in the routing table (you can discover more ways 
that routes can appear in the routing table in the next chapter) has a default 
administrative distance value. And the lower the value, the more trustworthy 
the knowledge of the route is.
Table 1-1 displays the administrative distances for connected routes, static 
routes, and routes that are added by some of the different routing protocols. 
(I cover routing protocols in the next chapter.)

324
Configuring Routing
Table 1-1 
Default Administrative Distances
Value
Reason for the Route
0
Route learned because of direct connection
1
Static route that was manually added 
100
Route learned through the IGRP routing protocol
110
Route learned through the OSPF routing protocol
120
Route learned through the RIP routing protocol
At this point, I want to make sure you understand that there are many different 
types of administrative distances and that as the value increases, trust 
decreases. Looking at Table 1-1, you can see that a directly connected route 
has a lower administrative distance (0) than a static route that the network 
administrator added manually (1). This makes sense because you can trust 
the route that the router creates due to a physical connection more than a 
route that an administrator manually inputs — after all, the administrator is 
capable of making a mistake from time to time.
 
Be aware of the administrative distances associated with both a directly 
connected route and a static route. Remember that administrative distance 
measures the trustworthiness of the route and that routers trust a connected 
route over a static route.
Looking back at the static route, you know that the 1 in the [1/0] signifies 
the administrative distance. The 0 that appears after the forward slash (/) 
represents what is called the metric, which is a way to measure which route 
should be used if there are multiple routes to the destination network. The 
metric can be displayed as either a hop count or a cost value; routing 
protocols use either a hop count or a cost value as a way to measure the 
metric (the preferred route).
 
✦ Hop count: This is the term used for the number of routers that the data 
has to pass through to reach the destination network. In a large network 
with multiple pathways to the same destination network, the lowest hop 
count is used. This is based on the assumption that the more routers to 
pass through, the greater the route distance. 
 
✦ Cost value: Some routing protocols base the metric off a cost value 
(which represents the bandwidth of the link) instead of the hop count 
because you may find that the pathway with the lowest number of hops 
does not necessarily have the most bandwidth. I tell you more about 
hop counts and cost values in the next chapter. 

Book III
Chapter 1
Static Routing
325
Configuring Routing
In the static route output that follows, this time notice the output (via 
26.0.0.2) to the right of the administrative distance and cost value. This 
setting specifies where the router is to forward the data that is destined for 
the destination network.
S     29.0.0.0 [1/0] via 26.0.0.2
In this example, you see that if the router has any information destined for 
the 29.0.0.0 network, it is to forward that information on to 26.0.0.2. 
This is called the nexthop, as that router will then need to look at its routing 
table to decide what to do with the information.
Understanding static routes
Earlier in this chapter, you find out that a static route is a route that the 
network administrator manually adds to the routing table. There are actually 
three ways that a route can be added to a router’s routing table:
 
✦ Connected route: The route is added automatically to the routing table 
as a result of the router having knowledge of the network; the router has 
knowledge of the network due to the fact that it is physically connected 
to the network.
 
✦ Static route: The administrator can manually enter additional routes in 
the router’s routing table.
 
✦ Dynamic (via routing protocol) route: If you install a routing protocol 
on the router, the routers on your network can share routing tables 
automatically with one another. I discuss routing protocols in the next 
chapter.
There are a few advantages of manually adding routes to your router 
using static routes instead of using a routing protocol to share the routes 
dynamically:
 
✦ No bandwidth consumption: Static routing does not use up the network 
bandwidth like dynamic routing does. Dynamic routing protocols send 
the routing table information from one router to the next on a continuous 
basis by sending the information over the network, which uses up 
bandwidth.
 
✦ Control over routes: By not using routing protocols, the network 
administrator is responsible for statically configuring each route. This 
gives the administrator full control over communication and, as a result, 
can control which networks communicate with other networks.

326
Configuring Routing
There is a major disadvantage to static routing — the administrative burden 
of adding all the routes for all the networks to each of the routers. This takes 
time to set up, but it also takes time to manage. What if six months down the 
road a new network is added in your company? Then you have to once again 
update all of the routing tables on the routers. With static routing, you also 
run the risk of human error.
Adding a static route
Now that I have highlighted some of the advantages and disadvantages of 
static routing, let us get back to the network diagram from the beginning 
of the chapter (shown in Figure 1-2). Earlier in the chapter, we identified 
that after configuring each of the interfaces on RouterA and RouterB, I was 
unable to ping the Fast Ethernet port (25.0.0.1) on RouterA from RouterB. 
Let’s find out why!
 
Figure 1-2: 
Revisiting 
the network 
setup.

To troubleshoot this situation, go to RouterB and view the routing table. Use 
the show ip route command, as follows:
RouterB>show ip route
Codes: C - connected, S - static, I - IGRP, R - RIP, ...
(Additional codes omitted for briefness)
Gateway of last resort is not set
C     27.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/1
C     26.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0
Do you see the problem? RouterB knows how to reach the 26.0.0.0 and 
27.0.0.0 networks, but it does not know how to reach the 25.0.0.0 
network, which is where the 25.0.0.1 IP address exists.

Book III
Chapter 1
Static Routing
327
Configuring Routing
To give knowledge of the 25.0.0.0 network to RouterB, you add a static 
route to the router. To add a static route for the 25.0.0.0 network on 
RouterB, use the following syntax:
ip route destination_network subnet_mask next_hop hop_count
The following list gives a description of the options you specify with the ip 
route command:
 
✦ <destination_network>: The network ID of the destination network 
that you are adding to the routing table.
 
✦ <subnet_mask>: The subnet mask of the destination network you are 
adding to the routing table. 
 
✦ <next_hop>: This is the tricky part — you have to look at Figure 1-2 
and ask yourself where RouterB needs to send information it has for the 
25.0.0.0 network. The key point to remember is that whatever you 
specify as the <next hop> portion has to be an address that the router 
can already communicate with.
 
 Looking at Figure 1-2, you see that if RouterB needs to send information 
to the 25.0.0.0 network, it needs to forward that information to the 
next hop of 26.0.0.1 . Once the information is received on RouterA, 
RouterA looks at its routing table and sees the route for the 25.0.0.0 
network and can forward the information on.
 
✦ <hop count>: This indicates how many networks away the destination 
network is. This parameter is optional but allows you to customize the 
hop count.
So the command you need to type on RouterB to add a route to the 
25.0.0.0 network is
RouterB>enable
RouterB#config term
RouterB(config)#ip route 25.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 26.0.0.1
After you add the route, you can view the routing table by going back to priv 
exec mode and using the show ip route command. Looking at the routing 
table that follows, you see that the route has been added and that it is a 
static route. (The entry has a code of S, meaning static.)
RouterB(config)#exit
RouterB#show ip route
Codes: C - connected, S - static, I - IGRP, R - RIP, ...
(Additional codes omitted for briefness)

328
Configuring Routing
Gateway of last resort is not set
S     25.0.0.0 [1/0] via 26.0.0.1
C     27.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/1
C     26.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0
If you try to ping the 25.0.0.1 address from RouterB at this point, you get 
a reply, but if ComputerB tries to ping 25.0.0.1, there will be no reply. The 
reason? RouterA now needs a route added to its routing table so that it can 
forward information to the 27.0.0.0 network. The following code shows 
the routing table on RouterA based off the configuration in the example in 
this chapter.
RouterA>show ip route
Codes: C - connected, S - static, I - IGRP, R - RIP, ...
(Additional codes omitted for briefness)
Gateway of last resort is not set
C     26.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0
C     25.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/1
You can see that you need to add a route to the 27.0.0.0 network on 
RouterA. To do this, use the ip route command and have the router 
forward data for that network to the next hop of 26.0.0.2:
RouterA>enable
RouterA#config term
RouterA(config)#ip route 27.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 26.0.0.2
To verify that the route has been added to the routing table on RouterA, use 
the show ip route command from priv exec mode.
RouterA(config)#exit
RouterA#show ip route
Codes: C - connected, S - static, I - IGRP, R - RIP, ...
(Additional codes omitted for briefness)
Gateway of last resort is not set
S     27.0.0.0 [1/0] via 26.0.0.2
C     26.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0
C     25.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/1
 
To add a static route to a Cisco router you use ip route destination_
network subnet_mask next_hop as the command. To view the routing 
table you use the show ip route command.

Configuring Routing
 
To see a demonstration on adding static routes to a Cisco router, check out 
the Static Routes video on the companion CD-ROM.
Deleting a static route
If you decide that you want to remove a static route from your routing table 
after you have added it, you can do that! There are many reasons why you 
may want to (or have to) remove a route — you may have a mistake in the 
configuration and, as a result, have to remove it, or you may decide that 
communication to a particular network is not allowed.
Whatever the reason, you remove the static route by negating the command 
you use to add the route with the word no in front of it. For example, the 
following is the command to remove the static route to the 27.0.0.0 
network from RouterA:
RouterA>enable
RouterA#config term
RouterA(config)#no ip route 27.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 26.0.0.2
After making any changes to the router, always view the configuration to 
ensure the change has worked as expected. In this case, you verify the route 
has been removed with the show ip route command.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, make sure that you know how to view the 
routing table, and be able to identify missing entries from the routing table. 
Also know how to add and delete a static route from the routing table.
Configuring the gateway of last resort
When looking at the routing table on RouterA and RouterB with the show ip 
route command, you notice the statement that says Gateway of last 
resort is not set.
RouterA#show ip route
Codes: C - connected, S - static, I - IGRP, R - RIP, ...
(Additional codes omitted for briefness)
Gateway of last resort is not set
S     27.0.0.0 [1/0] via 26.0.0.2
C     26.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0
C     25.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/1

330
Configuring Routing
The gateway of last resort (GWLR) is a way for you to configure your router 
to forward all packets for unknown destinations to another router. For 
example, your company may have a few small branch offices where data 
can route between offices (because each router has a route to each office in 
the routing table). But because the routers do not have routes to networks 
on the Internet, you can set the branch office routers’ GWLR feature to the 
router in the head office. This means that the branch offices will forward all 
Internet traffic to the head office router, which then forwards the traffic to 
the Internet. (See Figure 1-3.)
 
Figure 1-3:

You see in Figure 1-3 that each router in the branch offices is configured for 
a gateway of last resort address of 27.0.0.4. To configure the routers for 
gateway of last resort in this scenario, you add a route to the routing table to 
no particular destination network (known as a default route) with the follow-
ing command:

Book III
Chapter 1
Static Routing
331
Chapter Summary
R1>enable
R1#config term
R1(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 27.0.0.4
Once you add the route with no destination network and no subnet mask 
and set the next hop address to the 27.0.0.4 address, the GWLR feature is 
enabled. Let us take a look at how this changes the routing table.
RouterA#show ip route
Codes: C - connected, S - static, I - IGRP, R - RIP, ...
(Additional codes omitted for briefness)
Gateway of last resort is 27.0.0.4 to network 0.0.0.0
S*  0.0.0.0 [1/0] via 27.0.0.4
C     27.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0
C     31.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/1
You see in the routing table that the GWLR is set to the 27.0.0.4 address, 
and you also see a static route to the 0.0.0.0 network in the routing table; 
this is the GWLR entry and is indicated with the asterisk (*).
 
For the CCENT certification exam, be familiar with the gateway of last resort 
(GWLR) feature and know how to configure your router for GWLR.
Chapter Summary
This chapter gives you background information about the routing process 
and tells you how to configure your router with static routes. The following 
are some key points to remember for the CCENT certification exam regarding 
static routing:
 
✦ Routers use the routing table that is stored in memory on the router to 
determine where to forward data.
 
✦ Routes are added to the routing table via connected routes, static 
routes, or routes that are dynamically added with routing protocols.
 
✦ A static route is one that is manually added to the router’s routing table.
 
✦ You add a route to the router using ip route command.
 
✦ You delete a route from the routing table using the no ip route 
command.
 
✦ You view the routing table with the show ip route command.

Static Routing
Answers
 1 D. The routing table is stored in VRAM memory and is retained through reboots 
because it is rebuilt from the startup-config. See “Viewing the routing table.”
 2 B. The command to view your routing table is the show ip route command. 
Review “Viewing the routing table.”
 3 C. Connected routes exist by default in your routing table and are routes that are 
there because the router is connected to those networks. Check out “Connected 
routes.”
 4 B. The gateway of last resort is a default route that you can add to the router so 
that it forwards all packets for unknown destinations to a particular router that 
will then forward the packet on using its routing table. Peruse “Configuring the 
gateway of last resort.”
 5 A. You delete a static route using the no ip route command. Most Cisco 
commands can be negated by placing the word no in front of the command. 
Take a look at “Deleting a static route.”
 6 D. The administrative distance of a connected route is the lowest (0), as it is the 
most trustworthy type of route. Peek at “Static routes.”
 7 B. The gateway of last resort shows as an entry in the routing table with the 
destination network ID of 0.0.0.0. Look over “Configuring the gateway of last 
resort.”
 8 A. A static route has an administrative distance of 1, the second-lowest 
administrative distance next to a connected route, which has a value of 0. 
Study “Static routes.”
 9 D. In order to add a static route to the routing table, you use the ip route 
command and then specify the destination network ID, destination subnet mask, 
and the next hop where the router is to forward information for that network. 
Refer to “Adding a static route.”
 10 B. The route with the lowest administrative distance is always used. If there are 
two routes with the same administrative distance that could be used, the metric 
value is used. Examine “Static routes.”

Routing Protocols
In This Chapter
✓ Introduction to dynamic routing protocols
✓ Types of routing protocols
✓ Configuring RIP and RIPv2
I
n the previous chapter, you find out how to configure routes on your 
router using static routes, but this places a lot of administrative burden 
on you as the network administrator. A less time-consuming approach is to 
load a routing protocol, which is responsible for sharing the routing table 
with other routers on the network, on your router. The end result is that all 
routers share their routing table with each other, meaning that all routers 
have knowledge of all the networks on your internetwork.

Introduction to Dynamic Routing Protocols
Knowing how to add static routes to the routing table is a very important 
aspect of understanding routing and being able to manage and troubleshoot 
your router, but managing static routes can be a very time-consuming job! 
As a result, you may want to look at loading a dynamic routing protocol on 
your router. A dynamic routing protocol is a layer-3 protocol you enable on 
the router that is designed to share the routing table entries (the routes) 
on your router with other routers on the network. This process also allows 
your router to receive routing table entries from other routers as well. Let’s 
look at how dynamic routing works.
Looking at Figure 2-1, you see two routers, router R1 and router R2. Each 
router has a serial interface and Fast Ethernet port configured. The two 
routers are connected to a common network of 36.0.0.0, but each has its 
own LAN network. R1 is connected to the 35.0.0.0 LAN via the F0/1 Fast 
Ethernet port, and R2 is connected to the 37.0.0.0 LAN via its F0/1 Fast 
Ethernet port. Notice that the serial interfaces that are connected to the 
36.0.0.0 network have a .1 and a .2 beside them — this is shorthand for the 
IP addresses assigned to those interfaces. This means the serial interface on 
R1 has the IP address of 36.0.0.1, while the serial interface on R2 has the IP 
address of 36.0.0.2.

You see the default routing table entries that are created due to the fact 
that the routers have interfaces connected to those networks. R1 has routes 
to the 35.0.0.0 and 36.0.0.0 networks, while R2 has routes to the 

Book III

343
Introduction to Dynamic Routing Protocols
36.0.0.0 and 37.0.0.0 networks by default. Notice that the R1 router 
does not have a route to the 37.0.0.0 network, so it is not possible for 
any systems on the 35.0.0.0 network to communicate with the 37.0.0.0 
network. Also, R2 is missing a route in its routing table for the 35.0.0.0 
network, so it is not possible for the systems on the 37.0.0.0 network to 
communicate with the 35.0.0.0 network.
You know from the preceding chapter that you can create static routes on 
the routers to give knowledge to them of the networks they are missing, but 
that places an administrative burden on you as the network administrator. 
To avoid this burden, you can use a dynamic routing protocol to have the 
routers share their routing tables with one another automatically.
Looking at Figure 2-2, you see that once you install a routing protocol on the 
routers, they start to share their routing tables with one another and, as a 
result, they gain knowledge of all of the networks on the internetwork.
The message that is sent from one router to another informing it of the 
entries in the routing table is called a routing table update message. When a 
router receives a routing table update message from another router, it adds 
that route to its routing table (if it is not aware of the route already) and 
records the metric of that route (the hop count or the bandwidth, depending 
on the protocol). Figure 2-3 displays the routers with updated routing tables 
after the routing protocol has shared the routes.

Looking at Figure 2-3, you see that router R1 has a new entry in its routing 
table. The entry starts with the code R (because the route was learned 
through the RIP routing protocol; more on RIP in a bit) instead of a C (which 
means the route was learned due to a directly connected network). The new 
route also shows the destination network ID of 37.0.0.0 and the next hop 
address (which is where this router needs to forward information to reach 
that network) of 36.0.0.2, which is the IP address of the serial interface 
on router R2. In this example, the routing table also stores how many hops 
away that network is, meaning that it answers the question, how many 
routers do we have to pass through to reach that network? In this case, it is 
one router, or one hop.
In the previous chapter, you find out that the hop count is the metric used 
to measure which pathway is the best pathway. For example, if there were 
a third router that shared knowledge of the 37.0.0.0 network but had a 
hop count of 2, R1 would know that the “best” pathway is the route given by 
R2 (because the hop count is 1). The concept is that there is less distance 
involved if the traffic passes through fewer routers.
Notice in Figure 2-3 that router R2 has an updated routing table as well; it 
knows about the 35.0.0.0 network. When looking at that entry in the routing 
table, you see that the router learned the entry because of RIP (the code is 
R) and that if R2 has information for the 35.0.0.0 network it needs to forward 
that information to the address of 36.0.0.1, which is one hop away.
Now that you have the general idea of what a routing protocol is designed to 
do, let’s take a look at the different types (classes) of routing protocols and 
their features. After that, I tell you about specific routing protocols that fall 
into those categories.

Introduction to Dynamic Routing Protocols
Types of routing protocols
There are different types of routing protocols (actually, they are known as 
classes of routing protocols) and each type of protocol is designed to work 
in a different way. This section gives you the basics on the different types of 
routing protocols.
Distance vector
The first type of routing protocol to talk about is the distance vector routing 
protocol, which decides on the best route (when there are multiple routes 
to the same destination) to use by choosing the route with the lowest hop 
count (the distance). The term vector implies the direction — distance vector 
routing protocols track the direction by the next hop address, which is the 
address of the next router to forward the traffic to.
Routers running a distance vector routing protocol are designed to share 
their routing table with neighboring routers only. A neighboring router is 
a router within the same broadcast domain, which is a router that has an 
interface connected to the same network as another router — they are 
neighbors. For example, looking at Figure 2-3 earlier in the chapter, you see 
that R1 and R2 are neighboring routers, as they share a link by their serial 
ports. By being on the same network, this places both routers in the same 
broadcast domain, so as the routing table updates are broadcasted on the 
network link, the neighboring router receives that broadcast.
Distance vector routing protocols typically send their entire routing table 
to neighboring routers at regular intervals or when an update is made. (It 
depends on the protocol, though.) Once a router receives an update, it 
compares the routes in the update message with the routes in its own routing 
table, and if there are any new routes that need to be added, the receiving 
router adds those routes. If the update message has routes that are already 
in the routing table but they have better metrics (like a lower hop count), 
those routes are also added to the routing table, as they are more preferred 
routes than the ones that already exist.
Once a router updates its routing table with routes that it receives from a 
router, it then sends the new routes within an update message to its 
neighboring routers at the next update interval. This continues from one 
router to another until all routers have knowledge of all routes on the 
internetwork. The network is considered converged when all routing tables 
are up to date.
 
Because distance vector routing protocols share routes they learn from 
one neighbor to other neighbors, this is sometimes referred to as routing by 
rumor.

346
Introduction to Dynamic Routing Protocols
 
For the CCENT certification exam, be sure to know that a distance vector 
routing protocol sends the entire routing table to only neighboring routers 
and not to all routers on the network.
The following are the advantages of using a distance vector routing protocol:
 
✦ Less work: Using a distance vector routing protocol is a lot less work 
than manually adding static routes to each router. Once the routing 
protocol is loaded on the router, the routers share their routing tables 
to neighbors automatically.
 
✦ Dynamic: The routing protocol is dynamic in the sense that if a new 
route is added to a router, that router will then share the route with its 
neighbors, who then share the route with their neighbors.
Distance vector routing protocols are designed to be simple, and as a result, 
they do have some pitfalls. The following are some disadvantages of using 
distance vector routing protocols:
 
✦ Bandwidth usage: Distance vector routing protocols normally send the 
entire routing table at regular intervals to its neighbors; as a result, 
additional bandwidth is used on the network.
 
✦ Convergence time: Because distance vector routing protocols send the 
routing table information to only its direct neighbors, it can take time 
before the entire internetwork is aware of all the routes (because one 
router passes the knowledge over to another router, which passes it on 
to the next router).
 
For the CCENT certification exam, know that RIP and IGRP are examples of 
distance vector routing protocols. You find out more on these protocols in 
the “Identifying popular routing protocols” section later in this chapter.
One of the major problems with distance vector routing protocols is they 
accommodate for distance only and do not consider the bandwidth of the 
links in order to choose the best route for a packet to take. For example, 
looking at Figure 2-4, you see three routers — R1, R2, and R3. There is a 
64 Kbps link between R1 and R3, and there is a much faster T1 link (1.544 
Mbps) between R1 and R2, and then R2 to R3. 
When sending information from R1 to R3, the preference is to have your 
traffic follow the fastest route possible, which is the route from R1 to R2, 
and then from R2 to R3, as that route has the faster links. But if you use a 
distance vector routing protocol, the path with the smallest number of hops 
is always selected, which in this case is from R1 to R3 directly (even though 
that is the slower route).

Link state
Distance vector routing protocols send updates to only neighboring routers 
because the routers do not have knowledge of all of the other routers that 
exist on the network. The next type of routing protocol is known as a link 
state routing protocol. Link state routing protocols have many benefits over 
distance vector routing protocols. The first benefit is that a link state routing 
protocol knows about the entire network topology; meaning it knows about 
all routers on the internetwork and not just neighboring routers!
The link state routing protocol knows about the entire network topology 
because it maintains multiple tables in memory and not just the routing 
table, as in the case of distance vector routing protocols. The following are 
three tables that the link state routing protocols use:
 
✦ Neighbors: Contains a list of the directly connected neighbors.
 
✦ Topology: Has an entry for each router on the internetwork. Link state 
routing protocols use the list of routers in this table to decide whom to 
send the routing table to.
 
✦ Routing table: This is the normal routing table.
Link state routing protocols maintain a listing of all the networks and the 
state of the links for each of the networks. An advantage of a link state routing 
protocol is it tracks different characteristics about the routes, such as the 
bandwidth available and whether the route is up and running. Distance 
vector routing protocols do not track the availability of the link or the 
bandwidth, so a lower hop count route will always be selected, even though 
it may have less bandwidth than a higher hop count pathway.

Figure 2-5 looks at the same example from the earlier Figure 2-4 but uses a 
link state routing protocol. Notice in Figure 2-5 that the best pathway from 
router R1 to router R3 is the through router R2 and not the direct 64 Kbps 
link.

For the CCENT certification exam, know that OSPF is an example of a link 
state routing protocol. You find out more on this protocol in the “Identifying 
popular routing protocols” section later in this chapter.
Hybrid
A hybrid routing protocol combines features of distance vector routing 
protocols and link state routing protocols. An example of a hybrid routing 
protocol is the EIGRP routing protocol, which you read about in the next 
section.
Identifying popular routing protocols
Now that you are familiar with the different classes of routing protocols, let’s 
take a look at some of the popular routing protocols that fall into those 
different classes. The CCENT certification exam requires you to know how to 
configure RIP and RIPv2, but all you need to know about the other protocols 
is whether they are a link state or distance vector routing protocol.
Let us start the discussion by looking at examples of distance vector routing 
protocols.

Dynamic Routing 
Protocols

Introduction to Dynamic Routing Protocols
Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is an old industry-standard distance 
vector routing protocol many different vendors support — not just Cisco 
devices. Because it is a distance vector routing protocol, RIP chooses the 
route with the lowest hop count, and if there are two routes to a destination 
with equal hop counts, RIP load-balances between those links. Load balance 
means that RIP toggles back and forth the link it uses, essentially splitting 
the workload so that all the bandwidth on one link is not being used.
The RIP routing protocol has some features that make it an undesirable 
protocol to use on a large network, such as the fact that it sends the entire 
routing table out to neighboring routers every 30 seconds. The RIP routing 
protocol is also limited to 15 hops, so for a large internetwork, this may not 
be enough hops.
One of the other limitations of RIP is that it is a classful routing protocol, 
meaning it follows the rules of class addressing. (Refer to the class A, B, and 
C discussion in Book I, Chapter 4.) Classful routing protocols do not send 
subnet mask information with the routing updates. As a result of not sending 
subnet mask information with the routing table, the receiving router 
assumes that the default subnet mask of the address is being used. This 
also means that the protocol cannot support variable-length subnet masks 
(VLSM) and that all networks must use the same subnet mask when subnetted. 
With today’s network requirements on custom address schemes, this is a 
huge limitation.
 
For more information on VLSM, check out Book I, Chapter 5.
 
Remember that classful routing protocols do not support VLSM.
Routing Information Protocol v2 (RIPv2)
As I mention in the previous section, RIP, also known as RIP version 1 
(RIPv1), is an old industry-standard routing protocol and has many limitations; 
because of this, the protocol was revamped to RIP version 2 (RIPv2). RIPv2 
works the same way as RIP but with some improvements:
 
✦ Classless: RIPv2 is a classless routing protocol, meaning it does support 
variable-length subnet masks (VLSM) by sending the subnet mask 
information with the routing table update message.
 
✦ Updates: RIPv1 sends out the routing table updates as broadcast 
messages every 30 seconds. RIPv2 makes better use of the bandwidth 
by multicasting (sending to a group of addresses) the updates.
 
✦ Authentication: RIPv2 has a bit more security, as it supports 
authentication, whereas RIPv1 does not.

350
Introduction to Dynamic Routing Protocols
Outside of these improvements, the two protocols are very similar — they 
are both industry-standard distance vector routing protocols and have an 
administrative distance of 120.
Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)
RIP and RIPv2 are examples of open standard distance vector routing protocols, 
but Cisco decided to create its own distance vector routing protocol known 
as the Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP). Because RIP is an industry-
standard protocol, it is available on various router manufacturers, but 
because IGRP is a Cisco protocol, it is available only on Cisco devices.
The purpose of IGRP was to overcome some of the limitations of RIP, such as 
the updates being sent every 30 seconds and the limited maximum-supported 
hop count of 15 hops. IGRP sends routing table updates every 90 seconds 
by default and has a maximum hop count of 255. IGRP has an administrative 
distance value of 100.
IGRP uses what is known as an autonomous system (AS) to control which 
other routers the router shares its routing table information with. The AS 
is a number which creates a logical grouping of routers that share routing 
table information. The following code example shows how to enable IGRP:
Router>enable
Router#config term
Router(config)#router IGRP 10
Router(config-router)#network 37.0.0.0
The commands above move you to global configuration, where the router 
command is used to move into the router config prompt and enables IGRP 
with an AS of 10. In this example, the router will send out updates on the 
37.0.0.0 network.
IGRP has one huge drawback by today’s standards — and that is the fact 
that it is a classful routing protocol. As a result, it does not support 
variable-length subnet masks (VLSM).
 
For the CCENT certification you are required to know only of RIP and 
RIPv2, but I mention the other protocols to give you a bit more background. 
However, you should be familiar with which protocols are distance vector 
and which are link state.
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
Cisco has made some improvements to the IGRP routing protocol and as a 
result a lot of new versions of the Cisco IOS do not support IGRP. Cisco now 
wants you to use Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) — the 
big brother of IGRP!

Book III
Chapter 2
Dynamic Routing 
Protocols
351
Configuring RIP
EIGRP is a classless routing protocol supporting variable-length subnet 
masks by sending the subnet mask information with the routing table 
updates. Like IGRP, EIGRP uses an autonomous system (AS) to logically 
group routers, and it sends the routing table information to other routers in 
the AS.
EIGRP is an example of a hybrid protocol, as it incorporates features of both 
the distance vector with link state routing protocols. This means that EIGRP 
is aware of the state of the link, including the bandwidth of a link. Like IGRP, 
EIGRP has a maximum hop count of 255.
The following commands show you how to enable EIGRP by moving to 
the RouterA(config) prompt and using an AS of 15. Once you are in the 
router prompt, you specify on which networks you wish to enable EIGRP by 
using the network command.
RouterA>enable
RouterA#config term
RouterA(config)#router eigrp 15
RouterA(config-router)#network 25.0.0.0
RouterA(config-router)#network 26.0.0.0
 
Remember that EIGRP is an example of a hybrid routing protocol. 
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol is an industry-standard 
link state routing protocol. The fact that it is an industry-standard protocol 
means that many different router manufacturers support it — so it is great 
when you have a mix of routers from different vendors.
OSPF is a classless routing protocol that supports VLSM and uses a complex 
algorithm to choose the best route when there are multiple routes to the 
same destination. OSPF is designed for large networks; it minimizes the 
traffic generated to update routing tables across the network.
Configuring RIP
 
For the CCENT certification exam, you are required to be familiar with RIPv1 
and RIPv2 routing protocols, so be sure to carefully read over the following 
sections that describe them. For the exam, you are required to know not 
only a few facts about the two versions of RIP, but you are also required to 
know how to configure the RIP routing protocol. Let’s see how to configure 
RIP!

352
Configuring RIP
In the text that follows, I tell you how to configure both RIPv1 and RIPv2, and 
then I give you some tips on troubleshooting those configurations.
Configuring RIPv1
Configuring RIP on the routers is a fairly straightforward task. You see in 
Figure 2-6 two routers: RouterA and RouterB. RouterA is connected to the 
25.0.0.0 network and the 26.0.0.0 network, while RouterB is connected 
to the 26.0.0.0 network and the 27.0.0.0 network. All of the interfaces 
have been configured.
 
Figure 2-6: 
Looking at 
the sample 
network

To configure the RIP routing protocol on RouterA, the first thing you do is 
navigate to the router prompt for the RIP protocol by typing the following 
commands:
RouterA>enable
RouterA#config term
RouterA(config)#router rip
RouterA(config-router)#
Notice that after typing the router rip command you are in the router 
prompt and ready to enable RIP on the different network interfaces. To 
enable RIP on the different network interfaces, use the following commands:
RouterA(config-router)#network 25.0.0.0
RouterA(config-router)#network 26.0.0.0
Using the network command and specifying the network ID is required to 
enable RIP on the interface for that network. This configures the interface to 
listen for RIP update messages on the interface, and to advertise any routes 
out of that network interface as well.

Book III
Chapter 2
Dynamic Routing 
Protocols
353
Configuring RIP
 
When using the network command, you need to use only a classful address, 
and not the subnetted addresses. For example, if you have subnetted the 
25.0.0.0 network into two networks — let’s say 25.1.0.0/16 and 
25.2.0.0/16 — you are required to specify only the 25.0.0.0 network and 
not the subnet IDs that have been created.
This means that if you do not want to enable both subnets for RIP, you are 
out of luck. Well, not really — you can use another command to stop sending 
RIP messages from a specific interface! If you decide that you do not want 
to send RIP messages from a specific interface, you can use the passive-
interface command shown here. Keep in mind that you will still receive 
RIP messages on the interface, but you will not send RIP messages from that 
interface.
RouterA(config-router)#passive-interface serial 0/0
 
Be sure to know for the CCENT certification exam how to enable RIP on the 
different network interfaces. Also, when given a scenario where you do 
not want RIP messages sent from an interface, know that you can use the 
passive-interface command.
Note in Figure 2-6 that I want RIP messages sent from the serial port, so I am 
not going to add the passive-interface command. Also note that you 
would use the following commands to configure RIP on RouterB:
RouterB>enable
RouterB#config term
RouterB(config)#router rip
RouterB(config-router)#network 26.0.0.0
RouterB(config-router)#network 27.0.0.0
 
To see a demonstration on configuring RIPv1 on a Cisco router, check out 
the Configuring RIP video on the accompanying CD.
Configuring RIPv2
Configuring RIP on a Cisco router is a fairly straightforward task, and 
configuring RIPv2 is just as easy. In order to configure RIPv2 on RouterA, 
shown earlier in Figure 2-6, you type the following commands:
RouterA>enable
RouterA#config term
RouterA(config)#router rip
RouterA(config-router)#network 25.0.0.0
RouterA(config-router)#network 26.0.0.0
RouterA(config-router)#version 2

354
Configuring RIP
Notice that the only new command in the code is the version 2 command, 
which specifies that you would like to use RIPv2!
Troubleshooting RIP
Once you enable RIP or RIPv2, you will want to verify that it is running and 
sharing routing table information. There are a few commands you should 
know for the CCENT certification exam when it comes to troubleshooting RIP.
The first thing you want to do is verify that the routes are added to the routing 
table when you receive RIP updates from other routers. The following command 
is used on RouterA to verify that I have a 27.0.0.0 entry added to the routing 
table:
RouterA>show ip route
Codes: C - connected, S - static, I - IGRP, R - RIP, ...
(Additional codes omitted for briefness)
Gateway of last resort is not set
R     27.0.0.0 [120/1] via 26.0.0.2, 00:00:20, Serial0/0/0
C     25.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/1
C     26.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0
Looking at the preceding output, you see that RouterA has a route to the 
27.0.0.0 network that it has learned through RIP (code R). You can see the 
administrative distance is 120 with a hop count of 1 (by the [120/1]). You 
also see that the 27.0.0.0 network can be reached by way of 26.0.0.2, 
which can be reached by sending the data out the serial port. The 00:00:20 
is showing the last time a RIP update was received for that route. Remember 
that RIP messages are sent every 30 seconds, so this number should never 
be higher than 30 (displayed as 00:00:30).
If for some reason you did not have any new entries in your routing table 
learned from RIP, you might have to troubleshoot using some other commands. 
You can use the show ip protocols command to display information 
about routing protocols that have been enabled on your router.
RouterA>show ip protocols
Routing Protocol is “rip”
  Sending updates every 30 seconds, next due in 3 seconds
  Invalid after 180 seconds, hold down 180, flushed after 240

  Distance: <default is 120>
I have applied boldface to the preceding entries that you should make note 
of. The first line to note is at the top, where it mentions that the routing 
protocol “rip” has been enabled, and the output lets you know that 
updates are sent every 30 seconds. (This is known as the update timer.) You 
can also see that the entries are invalid after 180 seconds, which is how long 
the router waits before removing a route if it has not received an update 
within that period. (This is known as the invalid timer.) The flushed after 
setting specifies the length of time after a route has been deemed invalid 
that it is removed from the routing table (known as the flush timer). All of 
these values are measured in seconds.
You can also see that RIPv1 is being used to send RIP routing updates, but 
the router can receive RIPv1 and RIPv2 messages on each of the interfaces. 
Looking at the output, you also see that RIP has been enabled for the 
25.0.0.0 and 26.0.0.0 networks — this is definitely a setting to watch for 
when troubleshooting RIP to ensure you have enabled broadcasting of the 
right networks! The last setting to note in the output is that at the bottom — 
you see the administrative distance is 120.
The final thing I want to mention when troubleshooting RIP is that you can 
turn on debugging for RIP by using the debug ip rip command. The 
debug ip rip command allows you to view the RIP messages that are sent 
and received at the router console! To enable RIP debugging, use the debug 
ip rip command as shown in the output that follows:
RouterA>enable
RouterA#debug ip rip
RIP protocol debugging is on

*Apr  19 11:44:22.369: RIP: build update entries
*Apr  19 11:44:22.369:   subnet 26.0.0.0 metric 1
In the preceding output, you see that debugging is enabled for the RIP routing 
protocol. You can also see at the top of the output that a RIPv1 update was 
sent from the serial port and then another RIPv1 update was sent from the 
Fast Ethernet port. More importantly, at 11:43:53.025, you see that I 
received a RIPv1 update from 26.0.0.2 (the serial interface of RouterB), 
and that the update includes the routes of 26.0.0.0 and 27.0.0.0, with 
each being one hop away.
 
One last point I want to make is that you should enable debugging only when 
troubleshooting, and then disable debugging as soon as possible, as it puts 
load on your router. To disable RIP debugging, you use the no debug ip 
rip command, or you can disable all debugging with the no debug all 
command.
*Apr  19 11:53:22.614: RIP: build update entries
*Apr  19 11:53:22.614:   subnet 26.0.0.0 metric 1
RouterA#no debug all
All possible debugging has been turned off
 
For the CCENT certification exam, be familiar with the show ip protocols 
command and the debug ip rip command. Also be able to interpret the 
output to help determine if the protocol is sending and receiving updates. In 
addition, know the commands to disable debugging, for the exam!
Chapter Summary
The chapter introduces you to the concept of dynamic routing protocols 
and shows you how to configure the RIP routing protocol. Be sure to know 
the following points when preparing for the CCENT certification exam:
 
✦ There are two major classes, or routing protocols; distance vector and 
link state routing protocols.
 
✦ Distance vector routing protocols send the entire routing table in an 
update at regular intervals.
 
✦ Distance vector routing protocols use the hop count metric, while link 
state uses the availability of the link and bandwidth.

version 2 command at the router prompt.
 
✦ To display your routing table, use the show ip route command.
 
✦ To view routing protocol details, you use the show ip protocols 
command.

Introduction to Cisco Switches

Introduction to Cisco Switches
Cisco switches are unlike Cisco routers; when you purchase a new router, 
you are required to connect the router to the network and configure the 
router for operation. Cisco switches do not require any configuration to 
perform their job — you can simply take the switch out of the box, connect 
some systems to the switch, and it will function!
When looking at a Cisco switch, you will notice that it looks different from a 
router because it has a lot more interfaces. Most routers have three or four 
interfaces, but the switches have dozens of interfaces on them that you can 
use to connect computers and devices to the network.
Looking at Figure 3-1, you see a picture of a Cisco catalyst switch. Let’s take 
a few minutes to talk about the different LEDs that are located on the front 
of the switch, along with their associated modes. Keep in mind that your 
switch model may have different LEDs with slightly different meanings, but 
the general idea is all the same.
System LED
The first LED you see on the front-left side of the switch (the top-left LED 
in Figure 3-1) is the system LED, which gives information on the state of the 
system, or switch. You can use the system LED to help troubleshoot a problem.
If the system LED is not lit up at all, there are problems with the switch 
receiving power, or it is simply not plugged in! If the system light is a solid 
green, the switch is receiving power and functioning without any problems. 
If the system light is amber, the switch has experienced problems during 
POST on boot up.
 
If the system LED is not lit up, you may have power issues, while a system 
LED with an amber light indicates that you most likely have POST issues.
RPS LED
The redundant power supply (RPS; a system that supports multiple power 
supplies so that if one fails you still have power) LED uses a different color 
to indicate the functionality of the RPS.  The following outlines the different 
RPS LED colors:
 
✦ Green: If the LED is lit green it means that you have redundant power 
supplies in the device and they are functioning properly (meaning they 
are ready to provide backup power). 
 
✦ Blinking Green: Means that the redundant power supply is unavailable 
because it is providing power to another device at the time. 

Book III
Chapter 3
Introduction to 
Switching
369
Introduction to Cisco Switches
 
✦ Amber: An amber light on the RPS LED indicates you do have redundant 
power supplies but there is a failure in redundancy. 
 
✦ Blinking Amber: Means that the internal power supply has failed and is 
running of the redundant power supply.
 
✦ Not lit: If you do not have redundant power supplies, the LED is not lit 
up at all.

Switch display modes
When you look at the front-left side of your Cisco switch, you will also notice 
that there are four LEDs, labeled STAT, UTIL, DUPLX, and SPEED. (These are 
in the second row of LEDs back in Figure 3-1.) These four LEDs are called 
display modes, and they control the meaning of each LED that is displayed 
with each port on the switch. The mode LED that is lit up indicates the 

370
Introduction to Cisco Switches
display mode you are currently viewing, and you change the display mode 
you are viewing by pushing the Mode button on the front-left side of your 
Cisco switch.
Status mode
The default mode is STAT, or status mode, which indicates the status of each 
of the ports. When your switch is in status mode, each port LED has one of 
the following states:
 
✦ Off: If the LED on a port is not displaying any light while in status mode, 
it means there is no link to that port.
 
✦ Solid green: If the LED on a port displays a solid green, it means there is 
a connection to the port, known as a link, but that there currently is no 
traffic passing through the port.
 
✦ Flashing green: If the LED on a port is flashing green, it means that there 
is a link to the port and traffic is passing through the interface.
 
✦ Amber: If the LED on a port is amber, the port is disabled due to the 
administrator disabling the port, because STP placed the port in a 
blocking state (a CCNA topic), or it has been disabled automatically via 
port security (an address violation).
 
It is important to note that the meaning of the LEDs in status mode can 
change slightly from one model switch to the other. It is best to check the 
documentation for your model switch on the meaning of the LEDs.
Utilization mode
The UTIL, or utilization mode, displays the bandwidth utilization on each 
port. All the port LEDs together are used as a meter (see Figure 3-2) when 
you are in utilization mode:
 
✦ If all the port LEDs display a solid green, the bandwidth is 50 percent 
utilized or more.
 
✦ If all the port LEDs are green except for the last port (meaning the last 
port is turned off and emits no light), the network utilization is between 
25 and 49 percent.
 
✦ If all the port LEDs are green except for the last two, the bandwidth 
utilization on the switch is less than 25 percent.

Duplex mode
If you switch to duplex mode by pressing the Mode button, each of the LEDs 
on the ports take a different meaning. The following lists the meaning of the 
port LEDs when you have switched to duplex mode:
 
✦ Off: If you are in duplex mode and the lights are off on a port, it means 
that the port is running in half-duplex mode. Remember from Book I, 
Chapter 3, that half-duplex means you can send and receive data but 
only in one direction at a time.
 
✦ Green: If you are in duplex display mode and the LEDs on a port are a 
solid green, the port is running in full-duplex mode. Full-duplex mode 
allows you to send and receive at the same time.
Speed mode
When you are in speed mode, the LED on each port helps identify what 
speed the port has been configured for. The following summarizes the state 
of the ports when speed mode is used:
 
✦ Off: If the LED on the ports is off when you are in speed mode, the port 
is running at 10 Mbps.
 
✦ Green: If the LED is a solid green when you are in speed mode, the port 
is running at 100 Mbps.
 
✦ Flashing Green: If the LED is a flashing green, the port is running at 1 
Gbps.
Understanding Switch Functionality
Now that you understand the different light indicators on a Cisco switch, 
let’s talk about the purpose and functionality of a switch. In this section, you 
discover how a switch filters traffic using the destination MAC address of a 
frame, and you also find out some of the core services that a switch offers. I 
go on to discuss the different operation modes supported by Cisco switches 
in this section.

372
Understanding Switch Functionality
Switch overview
The purpose of the network switch is to act as a connectivity point for 
systems to connect to the network. Once the systems have connected to the 
network, they can then transmit and receive information with other networking 
devices and systems on the network.
Switches run at layer 2 of the OSI model (unless you have a layer-3 switch, 
which can also perform routing functions). As a result, they work with the 
data frames on the network.
The basic concept of a switch is this: The switch receives a frame from a 
system connected to it, looks at the destination address of that frame, and 
tries to find that MAC address in the MAC address table stored in memory 
on the switch. The MAC address table is a table that lists all the MAC 
addresses of devices connected to the switch and tells which port on the 
switch that MAC address is connected to.
When the switch locates the MAC address in the MAC address table, it then 
forwards that frame to the port that is associated with that MAC address in 
the MAC address table. (See Figure 3-3.)

For example, looking at Figure 3-3 you see that the MAC address table on 
the switch has the MAC addresses of ComputerA and ComputerB. When 
ComputerA sends data to ComputerB, the frame travels out the network 
card of ComputerA and up the cable to port 1 on the switch. The switch 
receives the frame and looks at the destination MAC address stored in the 
frame. In this example, because the frame is destined for ComputerB, the 
frame will have a destination address of 00-2B-3B-2C-3C-4B. The switch

then looks in the MAC address table to see which port that MAC address 
resides on — in this case, it is port 5. The switch then forwards the frame 
out port number 5 so that the data can reach ComputerB.
You can view the MAC address table on a switch by using the show 
mac-address-table command within priv exec mode on the switch. The 
following code displays the result of the show mac-address-table 
command:
Switch>enable
Switch#show mac-address-table
          Mac Address Table
-------------------------------------------
Vlan    Mac Address       Type        Ports

   1    00d0.bc8a.2766    DYNAMIC     Fa0/12
When looking at the output of the show mac-address-table command, 
you can see the three MAC addresses associated with the three different 
ports. The type dynamic means that the switch learned the addresses 
automatically as traffic passed through the switch.
Core switch services
There are three core services offered by switches — they are address 
learning, filtering and forwarding, and loop avoidance. This section introduces 
you to each of the three services.
Address learning
The first task that a switch has to do is to learn all the MAC addresses of all 
the systems connected to the switch and populate those MAC addresses in 
the MAC address table.
One of the ways that the switch learns the MAC addresses of the systems 
is dynamically as traffic hits the switch. For example, looking at Figure 3-4, 
when ComputerC sends a piece of data to ComputerA or ComputerB, the 
switch sees the source MAC address of the frame and then records the port 
that the frame was received on in the MAC address table.
The entries are stored in the MAC address table for 300 seconds after the 
last time the MAC address is used. (This is known as the aging-time.) You 
can modify the aging-time by using the mac-address-table aging-time 
<value> command to set the aging timeout to a larger value if you like. 
Although not recommended because it can cause communication issues in 

374

the long run, you can turn off aging and not have the entries time out of the 
MAC address table by setting the aging time to 0.

table!
Trafﬁc
Filtering and forwarding
After a switch learns the MAC addresses of all the systems, it then starts to 
forward traffic to only the port that the destination MAC in the frame resides at. 
This is an important feature of a switch, as it is filtering traffic by sending only 
the frames to the port that should be receiving the frame. This is unlike a hub 
device that forwards the information to all ports on the hub no matter what.
 
The fact that the switch filters traffic by forwarding the traffic to only the 
port that the destination system resides on gives a huge security benefit and 
also improves network performance. The security benefit is that the data is 
not sent to all systems (like a hub does), which takes away the opportunity 
for someone undeserving to see the information. The performance benefit is 
that you are not sending the data to all systems for them just to discard the 
frame (because it is not for them).
I typically have a number of students ask me what happens when the frame 
is destined for a MAC address that has not been added to the MAC address 
table. The answer is the switch floods the frame to all ports on the switch. 
Frame flooding is different from broadcasting because with flooding, the 
destination MAC address in the header of the frame references the one MAC 
address that is the destination of the frame.
Because the switch does not have the MAC address in its table, it has no 
choice but to flood the frame to all ports. The important point is that all 
systems connected will receive the frame but discard it if they are not the 
destination system of the frame. The system that is actually using the MAC 
address contained in the destination MAC address field of the frame will 
process the information and send a response.

Book III
Chapter 3
Introduction to

375
Understanding Switch Functionality
 
A broadcast message is a message that is actually destined for all systems by 
having the destination MAC address in the frame set to FF-FF-FF-FF-
FF-FF (the broadcast address). Any frames with the destination address of 
the frame set to the broadcast address will be processed by all systems on 
the network. For more on broadcast messages see Book I, Chapter 4.
 
Be sure to know the difference between frame flooding and the concept 
of a broadcast message. A broadcast message is destined for, and will be 
processed by, all systems. A flooded frame is a frame that is destined for 
only one system, and will be processed by that system, but is sent to all 
ports because the location of that system is unknown.
An important point to make is that when you have two switches connected 
together — let’s say SwitchA is connected to SwitchB — all of the systems 
that are on SwitchB will have their MAC addresses associated with the same 
port on SwitchA. This is because when SwitchA has data for those systems, 
it will reach all of those systems through the same port — the port that is 
connected to SwitchB.
Loop avoidance
A network loop is a bad thing, and it happens when you connect switches 
together to create a complete circle, like the one is shown in Figure 3-5. 
There are many different reasons why creating a loop with your switches 
is bad, and one of those reasons is it creates instability in the MAC address 
table.

Accidentally

loop on the

Understanding Switch Functionality
Let’s look at how instability in the MAC address table occurs. Looking at 
Figure 3-5, you see that a loop has been created between two switches by 
connecting port 1 to port 1 and by connecting port 12 to port 12.
When ComputerA sends ComputerB some data, the frame leaves ComputerA 
and travels the cable to reach switch SW1. Switch SW1 then looks at the 
destination MAC address in the frame, which is destined for ComputerB’s 
MAC address, and looks up the MAC address in the switch’s MAC address 
table. As you can see in Figure 3-5, the MAC address table is empty — so 
the switch must flood the frame to all ports on the switch in order to locate 
ComputerB.
When the frame is flooded to all ports on SW1, the frame travels the network 
cable connecting port 1 on SW1 to port 1 on SW2. When the frame is 
received on port 1 at the SW2 switch, the switch stores in its MAC address 
table the fact that ComputerA can be found out port 1.
The problem is that, looking back to switch SW1, the frame will also travel 
out port 12 because the frame was flooded to all ports. When the frame is 
received at port 12 on switch SW2, the switch goes to add an entry in the 
MAC address table for ComputerA being at port 12. The problem is the 
switch has already learned that ComputerA exits from port number 1! This 
creates instability in the MAC address table.
The solution is to prevent the loop from occurring by placing one of the 
ports that creates the loop into a blocking state. A blocked port is different 
from a disabled port in the sense that if a port is disabled, the administrator 
has to enable the port when she needs to use the port — which is adminis-
trative overhead. A blocked port is unblocked automatically when the switch 
needs the port to function again!
It is important to understand that the opposite of a blocked port is a port 
that is in a forwarding state. A port in a forwarding state is a port that can be 
used to send frames, while a blocked port cannot be used to send any traffic.
Here’s the big question: How does the Cisco switch decide which port to 
place in a blocking state in order to prevent the loop? The answer is that 
Cisco switches use a protocol called Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), which 
is a layer-2 protocol that uses an algorithm designed to prevent loops on a 
network.
In the example back in Figure 3-5, when switch SW1’s ports 1 and 12 are 
connected to switch SW2’s ports 1 and 12, the STP protocol decides to place 
one of those ports in a blocking state. The STP protocol uses different 
methods to decide on which port to place in a blocking state, but one of 
those methods is the bandwidth of the port — the lower bandwidth port is 
placed in a blocking state.

Book III
Chapter 3
Introduction to 
Switching
377
Understanding Switch Functionality
The reason why network administrators may have the two connections 
between the two switches is to create a fault-tolerant link so that if one 
link goes down, the other link is available between the two switches. Let’s 
assume that port 12 is placed in a blocking state when the fault-tolerant links 
are put in place. If for some reason the link on port 1 becomes unavailable, 
the STP protocol changes port 12 from a blocking state to a forwarding state 
automatically — still allowing communication between the two switches!
Switch operation modes
Your network switch runs in one of three different operation modes, with 
each operation mode processing frames a little differently. The following 
outlines the differences in the three operation modes.
Store-and-forward
Store-and-forward is the default operation mode on most Cisco switches. 
The store-and-forward operation mode involves the switch receiving an entire 
frame (store) before it decides where it needs to forward the frame to.
Store-and-forward has the downfall of taking more time to process the frame, 
as it has to wait until the entire frame has been received off the network. 
The switch stores the frame in memory until it is ready to forward the frame 
on to the destination system. Again, the downfall here is the wait time to 
receive the entire frame before making a decision on what to do with the 
frame.
The advantage of store-and-forward is that after waiting for the entire frame 
to be received, the switch then performs an error check on the frame to 
decide if the frame is corrupt. If the frame is corrupt, it will not bother 
forwarding the frame on to the destination.
The switch does the error check by looking at the checksum value stored in 
the trailer of the frame — known as the frame check sequence (FCS) — and 
then calculating its own checksum on the frame. After the switch calculates 
its own checksum, it compares it to what is in the trailer — if the two values 
are the same, the data is not corrupt and the frame can be forwarded on to 
its destination.
Cut-through
Due to the time it takes to receive an entire frame off the network and 
perform an integrity check, Cisco decided to create a different operation 
mode that you can use — cut-through. Cut-through processing means that as 
soon as the switch receives the destination address of a frame, it can start 
forwarding the frame on to the destination. 

378
Understanding Data Flow
Cut-through processing is designed to improve switch performance, as you 
have little wait time when a frame is received; the switch can start sending 
the frame data as it receives the information, instead of storing the bits in 
memory until all bits have been received (like with store-and-forward).
The downfall of cut-through is that because the switch forwards the frame 
bits as they are received, there is no way to do an integrity check to make 
sure that the frame has not been damaged. This means when a system 
receives the frame from a switch, the frame could be unreadable and need 
to be retransmitted. So, you gain performance but lose integrity with 
cut-through processing.
Fragment-free
Fragment-free is the switch operation mode that sits in between store-and-
forward and cut-through. It has been found that the first 64 bytes of a frame 
is what normally contains errors, so Cisco designed fragment-free to wait to 
receive the first 64 bytes, perform an integrity check on those 64 bytes, and 
then, if everything is fine, start forwarding the frame data on to the destination.
It is important to note that cut-through and fragment-free were created 
to help speed up the processing on older switches. Today’s switches can 
process frame data a lot faster than in the past, and that is why store-and-
forward is a good default — you can do full error checking, and the switch’s 
speed makes up for the wait time.
Understanding Data Flow
A big part of the CCENT certification exam is understanding communication 
and the pathway that information takes on a network. This section is 
designed to describe the pathway that information takes on a LAN (known 
as local communication), and how information travels between two networks 
(known as remote communication).
Local communication
Local communication is the term we use for two systems, or devices, that are 
communicating with each other and are within the same network. Looking 
at Figure 3-6, let’s break down the steps for ComputerA to send data to 
ComputerB by using the IP addresses.

1. ANDing: When ComputerA decides it needs to send data to the 
23.0.0.11 system (ComputerB), the first thing it does is compare the 
two IP addresses to see if the two systems are on the same network. In 
this case, they are on the same network (as they have the same network 
ID of 23.0.0.0). This decision is actually made by the IP protocol 
running on ComputerA.
 
2. ARP request: Once ComputerA decides that the system it is trying to 
communicate with exists on the same network, it knows not to bother 
the router for this communication. ComputerA now sends out an ARP 
broadcast message (known as an ARP request; see Book I, Chapter 4, 
for more on ARP requests) asking, “Whoever has the IP address of 
23.0.0.11, could you send me your MAC address?”
 
3. ARP reply: ComputerB sees the ARP request message and sends a reply 
to ComputerA indicating its MAC address.
 
4. Sending data: Now that ComputerA has the MAC address of ComputerB, 
it can now send the data to ComputerB. If you were to capture this 
communication, you would see that the packet header has the source 
IP address of 23.0.0.10 and ComputerA’s MAC address as the source 
MAC address. Notice, also, that the destination IP address is set to 
23.0.0.11, and the destination MAC address is the MAC address of 
ComputerB.

380
Understanding Data Flow
Remote communication
Remote communication occurs when two systems that are communicating 
reside on different networks. The pathway of remote communication is a 
little different from what we saw for local communication in the previous 
section. Using Figure 3-7, let us take a look at how ComputerA talks to 
ComputerC.

1. ANDing: When ComputerA decides it needs to send data to the 
25.0.0.10 system (ComputerC), the first thing it does is compare the 
two IP addresses to see if the two systems are on the same network. 
In this case, the IP protocol on ComputerA decides the two systems 
are on different networks because they have two different network 
IDs. (ComputerA has a 23.0.0.0 network ID, and ComputerC has a 
25.0.0.0 network ID.)
 
2. ARP the router: Once ComputerA decides that the two systems are on 
different networks, it knows that it has to involve the router in the 
communication. ComputerA looks at its default gateway setting 
(23.0.0.1) and then attempts to find out the MAC address of that 
default gateway IP address by ARPing the address. ComputerA sends 
out an ARP broadcast message (known as an ARP request) asking, 
“Whoever has the IP address of 23.0.0.1, could you send me your 
MAC address?”

Book III
Chapter 3

3. ARP reply: Router R1 sees the ARP request message and sends a reply 
to ComputerA, indicating its MAC address.
 
4. Sending data to router: Once ComputerA has the router’s MAC address, 
it sends the data to the router. The important point to stress here is 
what the fields in the packet header are set to:
 
• Source IP Address: 23.0.0.10
 
• Destination IP Address: 25.0.0.10
 
• Source MAC Address: MAC_of_ComputerA
 
• Destination MAC Address: MAC_of_router_R1
 
5. Have route?: Once router R1 receives the packet, it looks at the packet’s 
destination IP address and compares that to the routing table to determine 
if it has a route to the destination network. Assume that router R1 has a 
route to the 25.0.0.0 network, so the router sees that it must send the 
data to 24.0.0.2 — but it needs the MAC address of that address.
 
6. Router R1 ARPs R2: At this point, router R1 sends an ARP broadcast 
message out asking, “Whoever has the address of 24.0.0.2, could you 
send me your MAC address?”
 
7. R2 sends ARP reply: Router R2 sees the ARP request message and 
replies with its MAC address. Router R1 then sends the data to router 
R2. Again, it is important to note the source and destination addresses 
of the packets at this point:
 
• Source IP Address: 23.0.0.10
 
• Destination IP Address: 25.0.0.10
 
• Source MAC Address: MAC_of_router_R1
 
• Destination MAC Address: MAC_of_router_R2
 
8. R2 sends data to ComputerC: When router R2 receives the packet, it 
looks at the destination IP address to decide whether it has a route to 
the destination. Router R2 sees that it does have an entry in its routing 
table for the 25.0.0.0 network, so it ARPs the destination IP address 
of 25.0.0.10 (ComputerC). ComputerC then replies with its MAC 
address, and router R2 sends the data to ComputerC. At this point, the 
packet header has the following field values:
 
• Source IP Address: 23.0.0.10
 
• Destination IP Address: 25.0.0.10
 
• Source MAC Address: MAC_of_router_R2
 
• Destination MAC Address: MAC_of_ComputerC

Basic Switch Configuration
 
The CCENT certification exam tests your knowledge on communication 
because it helps you understand how to troubleshoot communication 
problems. Be sure to be familiar with the steps listed above (and in the 
previous “Local communication” section) and compare the steps to the 
diagram so you understand each step during communication. Notice in the 
steps above that the source and destination IP address do not change, but 
the MAC address does change with each step.
Basic Switch Configuration
Now that you understand the basic concepts of a switch, let’s take a look at 
how to configure popular settings on the switch. Understand that the basic 
configuration concepts of a router (see Book II, Chapter 2) apply here as 
well, so I don’t discuss the different configuration modes, setting passwords, 
and navigating to an interface — all of these concepts are the same. In the 
next two chapters, you find out about configuration settings that are unique 
to the switch. But here, I tell you about configuring the device name, the IP 
address, and the default gateway.
Configuring the device name
The first thing to do is set a unique name on the network switch by using the 
hostname command. Assigning a name to the device is a simple first step 
to make sure that when you connect to the device, you know which network 
device you are connected to.
Configuring a name on the switch is similar to configuring a name on your 
router — use the following commands to configure a name on your network 
switch:
Switch>enable
Switch#config term
Switch(config)#hostname NY-SW1
NY-SW1(config)#
In the preceding code, you see that you configure the switch’s name in 
global configuration mode. Once you’re in global configuration mode, you 
use the hostname command to set the name on your switch. In the example 
here, I have changed the name to NY-SW1 to indicate that it is the first 
switch in the New York office.
Configuring the IP address
Another important setting you may want to configure on your network 
switch is an IP address. Keep in mind that you do not need to assign an 
IP address to your switch in order for it to do its normal job of acting as a 
switch — a switch works fine without having an IP address assigned to it.

Book III
Chapter 3
Introduction to 
Switching
383
Basic Switch Configuration
So what is the purpose of assigning an IP address to the switch? You may 
want to assign an IP address to the switch so that you can remotely 
administer it. For example, after an IP address is assigned to the switch, you 
can Telnet into the switch and then remotely administer it. If you have no 
intention of remotely administering the switch, it may be better to not assign 
an IP address to the switch, as this will prevent a hacker from connecting to 
that IP.
 
Remember for the exam that an IP address is not needed on the switch, but 
if you want to be able to remotely administer the switch, you will need to 
assign IP address assigned to it.
To assign an IP address to the switch, you navigate to the default VLAN 
(Virtual Local Area Network) of VLAN1 and then assign the IP address to 
VLAN1. (You find out more on VLANs in the next chapter.) The following 
commands assign an IP address to the switch:
NY-SW1>enable
NY-SW1#config term
NY-SW1(config)#interface vlan1
NY-SW1(config-if)#ip address 23.0.0.25 255.0.0.0
NY-SW1(config-if)#no shutdown
Notice that with a switch you do not navigate to one of the Ethernet ports 
to assign the IP address — the reason is each system that connects to those 
ports has its own IP address. When assigning an IP address to the switch, 
Cisco had to come up with a way for the switch to get the IP address and not 
one of the ports. Cisco decided to assign the IP address to the VLAN, which 
they expose as a virtual interface.
Remembering to configure the 
default gateway setting
Once you configure the IP address on the switch, you can connect to 
that switch from anywhere on the network and administer the device. 
Unfortunately, you cannot connect to the switch from a different network 
because the switch does not know how to send data back to you; the 
switch cannot send data back to you because it would have to use a router 
to reach the other network and you have not configured it for a default 
gateway. (See Figure 3-8.)
Looking at Figure 3-8, assume you are sitting at ComputerC and you want 
to Telnet into switch SW1. In order for switch SW1 to send data back to 
ComputerC, it would have to pass the data to router R1. This means that the 
default gateway setting on switch SW1 needs to be 23.0.0.1.

To configure the switch for a default gateway, you use the ip default-
gateway command and reference the IP address of the router that the 
switch is to use to send data off the network. The following code shows how 
to configure the default gateway setting on the switch:
NY-SW1>enable
NY-SW1#config term
NY-SW1(config)#ip default-gateway 23.0.0.1
Notice that to configure the default gateway on the switch, you simply navigate 
to global configuration and use the ip default-gateway command.
 
Be sure to remember for the exam that if you do not have a default gateway 
setting assigned to the switch you cannot remotely administer the switch 
from a different network. This is because the switch does not know how to 
send data off the network if it has not been configured for a default gateway.
Chapter Summary
This chapter introduces you to the concept of Cisco switches and explores 
the basic services offered by a switch. The following are some key points to 
remember about a Cisco switch:
 
✦ Cisco switches do not need to be configured in order to function; you 
simply plug them in and connect systems to the switch.

✦ Switches are considered layer-2 devices, unless you are working with a 
layer-3 switch, which can act as a router as well.
 
✦ Switches offer three core services — address learning, filtering and 
forwarding, and loop avoidance.
 
✦ Switches filter traffic by storing the MAC addresses of all the systems 
and the port number they reside on in the MAC address table. As a 
frame enters the switch, the switch looks up the destination address in 
the MAC address table and then forwards the frame to the appropriate 
destination port.
 
✦ The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a loop-avoidance protocol that is 
responsible for placing a port in a blocking state if it creates a redundant 
path.
 
✦ There are three switch operation modes — store-and-forward, 
cut-through, and fragment-free. Each mode processes a frame a little bit 
differently.
 
✦ The Mode button on the front of the switch toggles between the different 
display modes. Each display mode identifies different characteristics of

Introduction to Switching
Answers
 1 C. Fragment-free is the switch operation mode that processes frames by waiting 
to receive the first 64 bytes before forwarding the frame on. See 
“Fragment-free.”
 2 B. If the switch has not been configured for a default gateway address, it cannot 
send data off the network. Review “Remembering to configure the default 
gateway setting.”
 3 D. If the port has been disabled by an administrator (or automatically shut down 
through a feature such as port security), the port displays an amber light when a 
system is connected to the port. You will need to enable the port before you can 
use it. Check out “Status mode.”
 4 A. The store-and-forward operation mode processes a frame by waiting till 
the entire frame has been received before forwarding the frame on to its 
destination. Peruse “Store-and-forward.”
 5 B. The frame is flooded when the switch is unsure what port to forward the 
frame to. A flooded frame is destined for a specific MAC address but was sent to 
all ports on the switch because the location of that MAC address is unknown. 
Take a look at “Filtering and forwarding.”
 6 D. You use the show mac-address-table command from priv exec mode to 
display the MAC address table. Peek at “Switch overview.”
 7 C. The ip default-gateway command is used to configure your switch for a 
default gateway address. Note that this command is executed from global 
configuration mode. Look over “Remembering to configure the default gateway 
setting.”
 8 B. This is an important question. When the packet is sent from your system to 
your router the destination IP address is set to the remote system you are trying 
to talk to, but the destination MAC address is set to the MAC address of your 
router. Study “Remote communication.”
 9 D. The cut-through operation mode is used to start forwarding the frame as 
soon as possible. Refer to “Cut-through.”
 10 A, B, E. The three core services of a switch are address learning, filtering and 
forwarding, and loop avoidance. Examine “Core switch services.”

each port, the duplex settings, and features such as port security.
This chapter continues with the discussion of switches by discussing port 
configuration settings such as the port speed and duplex setting, how to 
secure a port with port security, and discusses the concepts of VLANs and 
how to configure them on your switches. You are most certain to get

Configuring Switch Ports
394
Configuring Switch Ports
In this section, you discover some of the popular settings that you can 
configure on a switch port, such as the port speed and duplex setting, and 
I tell you how to configure security features such as disabling the port and 
port security. I also tell you how to view the port configuration and understand 
the information it gives.
Adding a port description
Assigning a description to each port serves as a reminder of the purpose of 
each port on your switch. It is fairly straightforward to add a description to 
the port, also known as an interface, and the description displays when you 
are using other commands to view your configuration. You can use the 
following commands to assign a description to a port:
Switch>enable
Switch#config term
Switch(config)#interface f0/5
Switch(config-if)#description File Server Port
In this case, I add a description that tells me that this is the file server port. 
But you can add any description that will help you when you’re administering 
the switch. The number of characters supported by the description setting 
can vary between models, but my 2950 switch can support up to 240 characters 
in the port description.
Choosing port speed
The speed of the port is normally decided through auto negotiation, which 
means that when a system connects to the switch, the switch negotiates 
with the system what the speed will be. If the system connecting supports 
the fastest speed supported by the port on the switch, both the switch and 
the system will use that speed. If not, that’s where auto negotiation comes in.
For example, let’s say that the port on the switch supports speeds of 10, 
100, and 1000 Mbps. If you connect a system to the port and the system has 
a network card that supports 1000 Mbps, the port runs at 1000 Mbps. If the 
card in the system supports only 100 Mbps, the port auto negotiates to 100 
Mbps.
You may find that your switch port is not running at the maximum speed, 
even though the system connecting to the port supports a faster speed. In 
this case, you want to manually configure the port for a particular speed to 
force it at that speed.

Book III
Chapter 4
Basic Switch 
Configuration
395
Configuring Switch Ports
To configure a port for a speed, you use the speed command once in the 
interface prompt for a particular interface (port). The following commands 
show you how to change the speed of a port:
Switch>enable
Switch#config term
Switch(config)#interface f0/5
Switch(config-if)#speed 100
To view a list of speeds supported by the port, you use the ? after the speed 
command, as shown here:
Switch(config-if)#speed ?
  10    Force 10 Mbps operation
  100   Force 100 Mbps operation
  auto  Enable AUTO speed configuration
If you want to configure the switch port back to auto negotiate, you use the 
following command:
Switch(config-if)#speed auto
 
Take note that when you configure ports on a switch, you do not have to 
configure each port individually. You can use the range parameter on the 
interface command to select a range of ports, and then use the speed 
command to set the speed on all ports within that range.
Switch(config)#interface range f0/5 - 12
Switch(config-if-range)#speed 100
Looking at the preceding code, you see that you can use the range parameter 
to select a number of ports, such as ports 5–12. Notice that the prompt 
changes to include the word if-range to indicate that you have multiple 
ports selected and any new commands will apply to a range of ports. In this 
example, I set the speed of those ports to 100 Mbps.
 
You can use the interface range command to configure a group of ports 
in one step.
Adjusting the duplex setting
In Book I, Chapter 3, you find out some things about duplex settings such as 
simplex, half-duplex, and full-duplex. The following list reviews the 
differences in the three:

396
Configuring Switch Ports
 
✦ Simplex: Devices supporting simplex communication can only send or 
receive information, but not both.
 
✦ Half-duplex: These devices can send and receive, but only one direction 
at a time. With Ethernet networking that is half-duplexed, the data is 
sent and received on the same pair of wires, so you can only send or 
receive one way at a time without collisions.
 
✦ Full-duplex: Full-duplex communication supports sending and receiving 
data at the same time. Ethernet environments support full-duplex 
communication by sending data over one pair of wires and receiving 
over another pair of wires.
If you want to view the duplex settings supported on your switch, you use 
the ? after the duplex command on a switch port as shown below: 
Switch(config)#interface f0/4
Switch(config-if)#duplex ?
  auto  Enable AUTO duplex configuration
  full  Force full duplex operation
  half  Force half-duplex operation
Switch(config-if)#duplex full
The preceding code example configures port 4 on the switch for full-duplex 
mode after viewing the help on the duplex command.
Disabling and enabling ports
 
When managing switches, it is important to disable any unused ports on 
a switch in order to prevent unauthorized individuals from connecting to the 
switch and gaining network access.
A disabled port displays on the switch with an amber light letting you know 
that the port is disabled. In order to disable a port on the switch, you use 
the shutdown command on the interface, as shown in the following code 
example:
Switch(config)#interface f0/3
Switch(config-if)#shutdown
 
You can select multiple ports at once by using the range parameter on the 
interface command. The following commands disable ports 6–12 on the 
switch:
Switch(config)#interface range f0/6 - 12
Switch(config-if-range)#shutdown

Book III
Chapter 4
Basic Switch 
Configuration
397
Configuring Switch Ports
When the time comes and you wish to connect a system to a port that has 
been disabled, you will need to enable the port. In order to enable the 
port on the switch, you can negate the shutdown command with the no 
shutdown command.
Switch(config)#interface f0/6
Switch(config-if)#no shutdown
Viewing port configuration
There are different ways you can view your current port settings to verify 
that your settings are taking effect. One of the ways to verify the port 
settings is to use the show interfaces command and view the port 
information of the port you are troubleshooting.
FastEthernet0/5 is administratively down, line protocol is down (disabled)
  Hardware is Lance, address is 0002.1604.3605 (bia 0002.1604.3605)
  Description: File Server Port
  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 100000 Kbit, DLY 1000 usec,
     reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255
  Encapsulation ARPA, loopback not set
  Keepalive set (10 sec)
  Half-duplex, 100Mb/s
  input flow-control is off, output flow-control is off
  ARP type: ARPA, ARP Timeout 04:00:00
(output has been omitted for briefness)
Looking at the output of the show interfaces command, you see that the 
interface (port) is administratively down. This means that you, as the 
administrator, have disabled the port. If the port was down because of a 
configuration error and not because you disabled the port, the status would 
simply say down instead of administratively down.
You also see in the preceding output that the description of the port is set 
and that the port is running at half-duplex with a speed of 100 Mbps.
Port security
Port security is a feature on the Cisco switch that allows you to limit which 
systems can connect to the port even though the port is enabled. With the 
port security feature, you limit which systems can connect to the port by the 
MAC address of the system.
Configuring port security
To configure port security, you first need to navigate to the port interface 
prompt for the port you wish to configure (or the range of ports you wish to 

398
Configuring Switch Ports
configure). After navigating to that interface, you need to configure the port 
for access mode — which allows a system such as a server or workstation to 
connect to the port. The following code shows you how to configure the port 
for access mode:
SW1>enable
SW1#config term
SW1(config)#interface f0/5
SW1(config-if)#switchport mode access
If you use the IOS help features, you will notice that three major port modes 
are supported by the ports on your switch — you can place each port in 
access mode, trunk mode, or dynamic mode.
SW1(config-if)#switchport mode ?
  access   Set trunking mode to ACCESS unconditionally
  dynamic  Set trunking mode to dynamically negotiate access 
or trunk mode
  trunk    Set trunking mode to TRUNK unconditionally
The following is a quick description of each mode:
 
✦ Access mode: Configures the port to allow a system, such as a server or 
workstation, to access the network through this port.
 
✦ Trunk mode: Configures the port as a trunk port, which is a port that 
connects to another switch and carries VLAN traffic between the two 
switches. (VLAN stands for virtual local area network; see the “VLAN 
concepts” section, later in this chapter, for more on VLANs.)
 
✦ Dynamic mode: Allows the switch to negotiate with the device that 
connects to the port to determine which mode should be used.
After you set the port for access mode, you then enable the port security 
feature with the switchport port-security command. Once you’ve 
enabled port security, you can then configure the port for a specific MAC 
address by using switchport port-security mac-address MAC_
address_of_system.
If you do not want to manually input the MAC address, you can use the 
sticky option, which tells the switch to learn the MAC address of the 
system connected and then configure port security to use that MAC address. 
The following commands enable port security and use the sticky option:
SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security
SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security mac-address sticky
 
Be prepared for a question on the sticky option and the port security
feature on your CCENT certification exam. Also, remember that switches are 
layer-2 devices and, as a result, work with layer-2 addresses.

Book III
Chapter 4
Basic Switch 
Configuration
399
Configuring Switch Ports
After you enable port security and configure the MAC address for the port, 
you want to limit the port so it allows for only one MAC address in the MAC 
address table for that port. If you do not limit the MAC address table for 
this port to one MAC address, the port could dynamically learn multiple 
addresses and associate those address with the port in the MAC address 
table automatically — thus allowing anyone to still connect to the port and 
we do not want that! The following command specifies that a maximum of 
one MAC address is to exist for the port in the MAC address table:
SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security maximum 1
After specifying the maximum number of MAC addresses, you then specify 
what happens when a system with a MAC address other than the one 
configured connects to the port — this is known as the action to take when 
a violation occurs. If a violation occurs, you can configure the port to any of 
the following:
 
✦ Shutdown: If you specify shutdown as the action upon violation, the 
switch disables the port when an unauthorized system connects to the 
port.
 
✦ Protect: The action of protect sends an alert to an administrator if a 
frame is received on the port from an unauthorized system.
 
✦ Restrict: The final option for action is a pretty cool setting, and that 
option is to set the action to restrict. When the action is set to 
restrict, the switch allows frames from only the specified MAC 
address to enter the network. This means that the port will work as 
long as the correct system is plugged into the port, but the second an 
unauthorized system is plugged into the port, the switch no longer 
forwards the frames.
The following command configures the port to disable if an unauthorized 
MAC address tries to use the port:
SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security violation shutdown
The following is a complete listing of our commands to configure port 
number 6 for the port security feature. The commands use the sticky 
option to learn the MAC address of the system and disable the port if a 
different system ever connects to the port. 
SW1>enable
SW1#config term
SW1(config)#interface f0/6
SW1(config-if)#switchport mode access
SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security
SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security mac-address sticky
SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security maximum 1
SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security violation shutdown

400
Configuring Switch Ports
 
For the CCENT certification exam, know how to configure port security and 
especially be familiar with the sticky option, which configures the switch 
to use the MAC address of the system connected to the port and saves you 
the trouble of finding out the MAC of the station.
Viewing port security
After configuring port security, you need to ensure that you have configured 
it correctly by viewing the configuration of the system.
To view the ports that you have configured for port security, you use the 
show port-security address command. In the output for this com-
mand (see the code that follows), you see the MAC address that has been 
configured for each of the secure ports.
Switch#show port-security address

Do not confuse viewing the port security address table with viewing the 
regular MAC address table. You view the MAC address table with the 
show mac-address-table command, which displays a listing of all MAC 
addresses and their associated ports. The port security address table 
displays to you any ports you have configured with the port security feature 
and what the MAC address of the allowed systems are that can connect to 
the port. Think of it this way — the MAC address table is a “who is 
connected?” table while the port security address table is a “these are the 
systems who are allowed to connect” table.
One of my favorite commands for viewing port security information on a 
port is the show port-security interface command. This command 
displays a listing of settings that indicate what port security features have 
been enabled on the interface.
Switch#show port-security interface f0/6

Sticky MAC Addresses       : 0

Security Violation Count   : 0
In the preceding output, you can see that port security has been enabled 
and the violation mode is set to shutdown. Also notice that the maximum 
number of MAC addresses that can be associated with the port is one. You 
can also see that there is a security violation count as well — this indicates 
how many packets have been received from systems other than the MAC 
specified.
Understanding VLANs
Now that you understand how to configure basic port configuration settings 
on the switch, let us take a look at how to configure virtual LANs (VLANs) on 
the Cisco switch! Keep in mind that VLANs is more of an ICND2 exam topic 
for the CCNA exam, so this is just a quick introduction to the VLAN topic. I 
am presenting this material to you in this CCENT book because VLANs are 
an important part of everyday networking and can be used as a great tool to 
control which systems can communicate with one another on the network. 
You may receive a question on the exam that requires you to know what 
a VLAN is, but you do not need to know the details of how to configure a 
VLAN for the CCENT certification exam. I expand on the topic in this chapter 
because, as a network administrator, you should be familiar with VLANs.
VLAN concepts
The term virtual LAN comes from the concept that in the past, if your manager 
wanted you to build two different networks that could not communicate with 
one another, you would have had to purchase two switches and connect the 
appropriate systems to the switch for their network. Because you would not 
have connected the switches together, no communication would have been 
able to occur between the two networks. (See Figure 4-1 and the explanation 
that follows.)

402
Understanding VLANs
 
Figure 4-1:

tion, you 
would

points.
 
A

SW2
C
B
D
In this example, the company would have had to purchase two switches to 
get two different networks that could not communicate with one another. 
One reason a company may want to do this is they may have a department 
that works with sensitive information, and from a security point of view, 
they need to ensure that no other systems can communicate with the 
systems in that department.
Virtual LANs (VLANs) are a way to create multiple networks on a single 
switch by grouping ports on a switch into a VLAN. The important thing to 
note about VLANs is that by default a system connected to one VLAN cannot 
communicate with systems in another VLAN. The reason I say by default is 
that you can configure a router to route between the two VLANs — but save 
that discussion for your CCNA studies.
Looking at Figure 4-2, you see a switch that has the first four ports in VLAN1 
and the last five ports placed in VLAN2. The VLANs create a communication 
boundary that does not allow a system in one VLAN to talk to another VLAN. 
This communication boundary also includes broadcast messages! As you 
find out in Book I, Chapter 3, VLANs are a method used to create broadcast 
domains. A broadcast domain is a group of systems that can receive one 
another’s broadcast messages. If ComputerA sends a broadcast message 
out on the network, no other systems except for those in the VLAN see the 
broadcast message.

Book III
Chapter 4
Basic Switch 
Configuration
403
Understanding VLANs
The reason that only systems in the VLAN see the broadcast messages is 
that when the packet leaves ComputerA, it reaches port 2 on the switch. The 
switch looks at the port the packet is received on and says, “What VLAN is 
this port a member of?” The switch checks the configuration and notes that 
port 2 is a member of VLAN1, so it tags the packet as a member of VLAN1. 
The switch then forwards the packet to all ports that are in VLAN1. (See 
Figure 4-3.)

Although you should not see much in the way of VLANs on the CCENT exam, 
be aware that a VLAN creates a broadcast domain. When you get questions 
asking what methods are used to create broadcast domains, the answer is a 
router or VLANs.
Basic VLAN configuration
Now that you understand that a VLAN is a way to control which network 
devices can communicate with one another and that a VLAN is another 
method of creating a broadcast domain, let us take a look at the commands 
to configure VLANs.
Here is my example scenario: Say you want to create two VLANs for a 
company, one for the executives’ systems and one for the developers. In 
this example, you navigate to the VLAN database and create VLAN2 (named 
Executives) and VLAN3 (named Development).
 
Note that by default all ports are in VLAN1. 
Use the following commands to create the two VLANs:
Switch>enable
Switch#vlan database
Switch(vlan)#vlan 2 name Executives

404
Understanding VLANs
VLAN 2 added:
    Name: Executives
Switch(vlan)#vlan 3 name Development
VLAN 3 added:
    Name: Development
Switch(vlan)#exit
APPLY completed.
Exiting....
After creating the two VLANs, take a look at the newly created VLANs with 
the show vlan command.

When looking at the output of the show vlan command, you can see three 
VLANs configured on the switch, with all the ports still in the first VLAN. The 
next step is to place the appropriate ports into the appropriate VLANs. In 
this example scenario, you want to place ports 6–9 in the Executives VLAN 
and ports 10–12 in the Development VLAN. The following commands 
accomplish this goal:
Switch>enable
Switch#config term
Switch(config)#interface range f0/6 - 9
Switch(config-if-range)#switchport access vlan 2
Switch(config-if-range)#interface range f0/10 - 12
Switch(config-if-range)#switchport access vlan 3
Switch(config-if-range)#exit
Switch(config)#exit
In the commands here, you first navigate to the interface prompt for the 
interfaces you wish to place in a different VLAN. You will notice that I use 
the interface range command to select interfaces 6–9 in one command. 
I then place those interfaces in VLAN2 by using the switchport command. 
Ports 10–12 are then placed in VLAN3.

Chapter Summary
To verify that the ports have been placed in the appropriate VLANs, you can 
use the show vlan command. Notice in the output that follows that ports 
6–9 are in the Executives VLAN, while ports 10–12 are in the Development 
VLAN.

3    Development   active    Fa0/10, Fa0/11, Fa0/12
(output has been omitted for briefness)
Once you place the different ports into the different VLANs, you can then 
start connecting the systems to the ports. In the example scenario, if you 
were to connect a system into port 7 (which resides in the Executives VLAN) 
and then connect a system into port 11 (which resides in the Development 
VLAN), those systems would be unable to ping one another.
Chapter Summary
This chapter discusses a number of different switch configuration settings 
that deal with configuring the ports on a switch. This chapter also 
demonstrates the commands you need to be familiar with to answer the 
related questions on the CCENT certification exam. The following are some 
key points to remember about configuring switches:
 
✦ A port can be disabled with the shutdown command and enabled with 
no shutdown command.
 
✦ You change the duplex setting on an interface to full-duplex by using the 
duplex full command.
 
✦ You modify the speed of the port with the speed 10/100/1000 
command once at the interface prompt.
 
✦ You modify multiple interfaces at one time by first selecting a range of 
interfaces with the interface range command.
 
✦ Port security is a way to limit which systems can connect to a switch by 
their MAC addresses.
 
✦ You use the show port-security interface command to view the 
port security setup on a particular interface.

406
Lab Exercises
 
✦ When using the show interfaces command, an interface that displays 
as administratively down message is an interface that you have 
explicitly disabled with the shutdown command.
 
✦ VLANs are used to create multiple virtual networks on a switch (or 
between switches). A VLAN is a communication boundary and is also a 
way to implement multiple broadcast domains on a switch.

Basic Switch Configuration
Answers
 1 D. To display the MAC addresses associated with each port on the switch, you 
view the MAC address table, which resides in memory on the switch. Use the 
show mac-address-table command. See “Viewing port security.”
 2 B. To view a list of VLANs and the ports associated with the different VLANs, 
use the show vlan command. Review “Basic VLAN configuration.”
 3 C. The sticky option is important when configuring port security. It allows you 
to configure a port to allow traffic only from the current or first MAC address 
(assuming you set the maximum addresses to 1). Check out “Configuring port 
security.”
 4 D. To modify the port speed on a switch, you first need to navigate to the port 
interface of the port you wish to configure and then use the speed command. 
Peruse “Choosing port speed.”
 5 B. Shutdown is the action you can configure on the switch that tells the switch 
to disable the port if there is an address violation. Take a look at “Configuring 
port security.”
 6 A. Before you can configure port security on a port, you must first put the port 
in access mode by using the port-security mode access command. Peek at 
“Configuring port security.”
 7 C. To view the port security settings on a port, you use the show port-security 
interface command. Look over “Viewing port security.”
 8 D. If you find that you can communicate with some systems on the network but 
not with others, it is possible that you are connected to a port that is part of a 
VLAN — meaning that you will not be able to communicate with others that are 
in a different VLAN unless a router is being used. Study “VLAN concepts.”
 9 B. When looking at the interface, if you notice that it says administratively 
down, you have most likely disabled the port with the shutdown command. You 
will need to enable the port before it can be used. Refer to “Disabling and 
enabling ports” and also “Viewing port configuration.”
 10 A, C, E. When configuring port security, you can configure one of three actions 
to be taken upon address violation — restrict, shutdown, or protect. 
Examine “Configuring port security.”

Understanding Troubleshooting Utilities
Most operating systems give you a number of commands or troubleshooting 
utilities that help you diagnose connectivity issues on the network, and the 
Cisco IOS is no different! In this section, you find out about some of the 
different IOS commands you can use to troubleshoot connectivity issues 
with Cisco devices. For your own information (not for the exam), I also tell 
you how to use some troubleshooting commands on Windows computers 
on the network. (And I even throw in a few Linux commands, for good 
measure.)
 
Before getting started, I want to make sure that you understand the example 
network topology I am using for this chapter. It is a simple network setup 
similar to other network topologies used within the book. Figure 5-1 displays 
the example network layout with the New York and Boston offices connected 
in a network.

Understanding Troubleshooting Utilities
 
Be sure to be very familiar with the commands in this section, as they are 
used quite often in the real world and on the exam!
The ping command
The first command to discuss is the ping command. Ping stands for Packet 
InterNet Groper (PING) and is a popular command-line utility that you can 
use to send test messages from one system to another in hopes that you 
receive replies. If you receive replies, you know the communication link and 
configuration of the devices is fine, but if there is no reply, you know that 
there is a problem — and you need to start troubleshooting!
The ping command uses the Internet Control Messaging Protocol (ICMP) and 
works by sending ICMP echo request messages from a source to a destination 
in hopes that an ICMP echo reply message is received as a response. 
Remember from my TCP/IP discussion (see Book I, Chapter 4) that ICMP is 
a network-layer protocol in TCP/IP and is responsible for status information 
and error reporting.
To ping from the NY-R1 router across the WAN link, you use the following 
command:
NY-R1>ping 24.0.0.2
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 24.0.0.2, timeout is 2 
seconds:
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 
31/31/32 ms
When using the ping command, notice that you supply the IP address of 
the device you are trying to ping; in this example, I am pinging the serial 
interface on BOS-R1. The Cisco device sends out five ICMP echo messages in 
hopes of receiving replies. You can see that five replies are received because 
you see five exclamation points (!); each exclamation point represents 
an echo reply received. If a reply is not received, the command displays 
a period (.) with each missing reply message, as shown in the following 
output:
NY-R1>ping 24.0.0.5
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 24.0.0.5, timeout is 2 
seconds:
.....
Success rate is 0 percent (0/5)

418
Understanding Troubleshooting Utilities
In the preceding code, I am pinging an IP address that is not being used on 
the network, so no reply comes back. Notice that the ping command has a 
timeout set to two seconds, which means that it will wait two seconds after 
each echo request message is sent before determining that a reply is not 
coming back.
 
When troubleshooting communication issues, you should ping each IP 
address along the pathway of the communication to see where the failure is 
occurring.
The traceroute command
The ping command is very popular, but it indicates only whether the IP 
address you are pinging is up and running. The ping command does not 
display the pathway the ping packets are taking. When troubleshooting 
network communication and the configuration of your router, you want to 
be able to determine the pathway that information is taking, and you do this 
by using the traceroute command. 
The traceroute command uses ICMP as a protocol as well, but it recieves 
a reply back from each router it hits along the path to the address being 
tested. For example, to test traceroute, I am going to traceroute from NY-R1 
to 25.0.0.10 (the workstation on the Boston network). Note that in order 
to reach the 25.0.0.10 system, I have to pass through the BOS-R1 router 
by sending through the IP address of 24.0.0.2.
NY-R1>traceroute 25.0.0.10
Type escape sequence to abort.
Tracing the route to 25.0.0.10
  1   24.0.0.2        31 msec   31 msec   31 msec   
  2   *     94 msec   94 msec   
NY-R1>
In the preceding code, you see that I am using the traceroute command to 
the 25.0.0.10 system. The traceroute command comes back with a list 
of hops, which are the routers it passes through to reach that destination. 
The first hop is the 24.0.0.2 address, which is the address of the BOS-R1 
router, while the second hop is the packet reaching the workstation itself. 
This command would be more exciting with a larger network, as you would 
see more hops — one hop for each router the traceroute packet passes 
through.
 
Using the traceroute feature is a great way to verify the pathway that a 
packet is taking. If you find that network performance is degrading, it may be 
because a direct link between two networks has gone down and your traffic 
is taking an indirect, less-preferred route. The traceroute feature helps you 
identify whether the traffic is taking an undesired pathway.

Understanding Troubleshooting Utilities
The telnet command
Another very popular command you can use when troubleshooting is the 
telnet command, which you can use to remotely connect to and fix a 
configuration problem on the router. For more information on how to use 
the telnet command to Telnet into a Cisco device, check out Book II, 
Chapter 3.
The telnet command is also useful when troubleshooting problems on 
servers such as e-mail or Web servers. When troubleshooting problems 
with servers such as SMTP servers, you use the telnet command to Telnet 
into the port of the server and issue related commands. For example, from 
a Windows or Linux machine, you can type telnet ip_address 25 in a 
command prompt to Telnet into port 25 (the SMTP port) to connect to the 
SMTP server of a system.
Viewing the ARP cache
When troubleshooting communication problems, you can view your ARP 
cache (which stores the ARP replies your device has received) on a Cisco 
router to ensure that the logical address (IP address) is resolved to a physical 
address (MAC address). You use the show ip arp command to view the 
local ARP cache of a Cisco router:
NY-R1>show ip arp
Address          Age (min)  Hardware Addr   Interface
23.0.0.1                -   0010.11D9.D001  FastEthernet0/0
23.0.0.10               4   0011.9520.8c27  FastEthernet0/0
23.0.0.100             10   0006.d6ab.a040  FastEthernet0/0
(Protocol and type columns have been removed for briefness)
In the preceding code, you see that the IP address is displayed with the 
corresponding MAC address (Hardware Addr). There is also an age limit 
that indicates how long the entry will stay in the ARP cache before it expires. 
In addition, an Interface column indicates the interface that communicates 
with the device using that address.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, know that you can use both the show 
arp and the show ip arp commands to display the ARP cache on a Cisco 
router.
Troubleshooting commands in Windows
Although you are not tested on Windows commands on the CCENT certification 
exam, I do want to mention a few of the same commands for the Windows 
environment. The reason is that when you troubleshoot communication 
problems on the network, you may sometimes have to troubleshoot from 
the computers on the network.

420
Understanding Troubleshooting Utilities
The ipconfig command
When troubleshooting communication issues from the client systems, you 
may need to verify that the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway 
settings are correct. To view the TCP/IP settings on a Windows system, you 
can use the ipconfig command:
C:\>ipconfig
Windows IP Configuration
Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection:
        Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
        IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 23.0.0.10
        Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.0.0.0
        Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 23.0.0.1
 
On a Linux system, you can view your TCP/IP settings with the ifconfig 
command. The ifconfig command stands for interface configuration, and it 
displays or temporarily modifies settings on your network card.
Windows’ ping command
In the code example in the previous section, the router that the client uses 
to get off the network is 23.0.0.1 (the default gateway), so if you are 
having trouble with this client system communicating over the Internet or 
WAN link, you use a ping of 23.0.0.1 to verify that the client can communicate 
with the router.
C:\>ping 23.0.0.1
Pinging 23.0.0.1 with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 23.0.0.1: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=255
Reply from 23.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=255
Reply from 23.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=255
Reply from 23.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=255
Ping statistics for 23.0.0.1:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 1ms, Average = 0ms
The tracert command
Windows and Linux systems also support a traceroute feature that sends a 
reply back from every router the traceroute packet passes through along the 
pathway to the address you traceroute. In Windows, the traceroute 
command is actually called tracert, but it works the same way as on a 
Cisco router:

Book III
Chapter 5
Troubleshooting 
Network 
Communication

Troubleshooting Connectivity Issues
C:\>tracert 25.0.0.10
Tracing route to 25.0.0.10 over a maximum of 30 hops: 
  1   13 ms     9 ms      7 ms      23.0.0.1
  2   13 ms     13 ms     8 ms      24.0.0.2
  3   19 ms     18 ms     23 ms     25.0.0.10
Trace complete.
In the preceding code example, I perform a traceroute, using the tracert 
command in Windows, from the workstation on the New York network 
(ComputerA). Notice that the packet goes through the 23.0.0.1 router first 
before passing through 24.0.0.2, which is then passed on to the destination 
system of 25.0.0.10.
 
In Linux, you can do a traceroute using the traceroute command instead 
of the tracert command found in Windows.
Looking at the ARP cache
The computers on a network also have an ARP cache that stores recent 
IP addresses you have communicated with and their corresponding MAC 
addresses. Like on the Cisco device, if you wish to view the ARP cache, 
you can, but the command is a little different. To view the ARP cache on a 
Windows or Linux system, you use the arp –a command:
C:\>arp -a
Interface: 23.0.0.10 --- 0x4
  Internet Address      Physical Address      Type
  23.0.0.19             00-11-95-20-8c-27     dynamic

Be sure to focus on the Cisco commands for the CCENT certification exam 
and not the Windows commands. You should be familiar with the Windows 
commands for the real world.
Troubleshooting Connectivity Issues
Now that you know about popular commands to use on the Cisco device to 
help troubleshoot or identify communication problems, let us take a look at 
some of the causes of communication failures. We will first look at popular 
issues dealing with the physical aspect of the network (such as cabling), and 
then take a look at the logical aspect of the network (such as IP addressing).

422
Troubleshooting Connectivity Issues
Identifying physical issues
When troubleshooting problems on the network, you first want to look to 
the simple stuff like the cabling. This section discusses popular issues with 
the cables and then looks at how to diagnose a problem based on the LED 
indicators on the router or switch.
Cables and connectors
The first thing to do when troubleshooting communication failures is to 
make sure that all the cables are connected properly to the router or the 
switch. When troubleshooting a router (or an interface on the router), be 
sure that all network cables and communication links are connected firmly 
in the ports.
You can use the LED on the port to help you identify whether there is 
connectivity at either end of the line. (See Book III, Chapter 3, for more about 
the port LEDs.) The interface link light, also known as a port LED, should 
display a green light if there is a link; remember that you need to verify that 
the cable is connected at either end in order for communication to occur.
Wrong port
After verifying the cable is seated properly in the port, you should then 
triple-check that you have the cable connected to the correct port. I do not 
know how many times I thought I had connected the cable to FastEthernet 
0/0, only to find out it was connected to FastEthernet 0/1.
Wrong cable type
Another common problem is connecting the wrong type of cable between 
two points (or devices). This, unfortunately, is a common mistake with 
junior network technicians, as they may not understand when to use a 
crossover and when to use a straight-through cable.
A general rule is to use crossover cable when you are connecting 
similar devices. For example, if you are connecting a switch to another 
switch, you use a crossover cable; if you are connecting a router to another 
router, you use a crossover cable; and if you are connecting two 
computers together, you use a crossover cable. It is important to note 
that if you connect a computer directly to a router (which is unlikely, 
but possible), you use a crossover.
You use a straight-through cable when connecting a switch to a computer or 
a router to a switch.

Troubleshooting Connectivity Issues
 
For the CCENT certification exam, be sure to know when to use a crossover 
cable and a straight-through cable when connecting different network 
devices to one another.
For more details on which cables to use, see Book I, Chapter 2.
Port shutdown
If you have verified that you are using the correct cable and you have 
confirmed that the cable is connected properly, communication could be 
failing because of a configuration problem. It could be that the port was 
never enabled with the no shutdown command. View the running-config 
to display the configuration settings on the router to determine if there 
is a configuration issue. (For more details on how to do this, see Book II, 
Chapter 2.)
 
If the port has been disabled for any particular reason, it will display an 
amber light on the port LED.
LED indicators
It is important to keep a close eye on the LEDs on each of the ports on 
routers and switches when troubleshooting connectivity issues. 
 
See Book III, Chapter 3, for more about the ports LEDs.
When the link light, or LED, on the interface is a solid green, it indicates that 
the physical cable is attached (layer 1) and that the layer-2 communication 
protocol at either end of the link is established. If you are unable to get a link 
light, then you want to ensure that both of these conditions are met. For 
an Ethernet interface, the layer-2 protocol is Ethernet and is configured 
automatically, but for a serial link, you must specify a data link (layer-2) 
protocol such as HDLC or PPP.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, know that a link light appearing on a port 
indicates that a layer-2 protocol is established at either end of the link and 
that there is a layer-1 medium (such as a cable) making contact the two 
points.
When the light on the interface, or port, flashes green, it means that traffic 
is passing through the interface and everything is okay. If the port displays 
an amber light, it means the port has either not been enabled or has been 
disabled either manually by the administrator or automatically through a 
feature such as port security. In this case, you should check the status of the 
port to see if it has been disabled, and if so, you need to enable the port with 
the no shutdown command.

424
Troubleshooting Connectivity Issues
Identifying logical issues
Checking the physical (layer-1) aspects of the devices is only the first step to 
troubleshooting interface issues. Once you verify the cables are connected, 
you are using the correct cable types, and that you have the appropriate 
layer-2 protocol enabled on the interfaces (for example, Ethernet, PPP, or 
HDLC), it is time to check some of the logical aspects of the configuration.
TCP/IP settings
When troubleshooting connectivity issues, you need to take the time to 
verify that the correct IP address (layer-3) information is assigned to each 
interface on the router. You can view your running configuration to see the 
addresses assigned, or you can use the show interfaces command to 
view the settings applied to each interface on the router.
When checking for IP addressing problems, be sure to check for the following 
issues:
 
✦ Address in network range: Ensure that the address assigned to an 
interface on a router, switch, or computer is within the network range 
for the network or subnet.
 
✦ Correct subnet mask: Ensure that the subnet mask is the correct subnet 
mask for the address being used.
 
✦ Correct default gateway: Ensure that the default gateway assigned to 
switches and computers is the correct IP address for that network or 
network segment. The default gateway address assigned to systems or 
devices must be an address on the subnet.
 
The CCENT certification exam will have network scenarios describing 
situations where communication fails. In these scenarios, always watch for 
misconfiguration in the IP addresses of the devices or computers involved. 
Also watch for IP addresses assigned to a system or device that is outside 
the range of the subnetted network, wrong subnet masks being used, and 
referring to the wrong default gateway.
 
For more information on IP addressing and subnetting, check out Book I, 
Chapters 4 and 5 — very important chapters for the CCENT certification!
Routing table
After you verify that all of the involved interfaces are configured with the 
correct IP addresses, you should check that there is a route to the destination 
network in the routing table when troubleshooting communication problems.

Network 
Communication
425
Using Show Commands to View Configuration
By default, the Cisco device adds a route for each of the networks that it 
is connected to, and it is up to you to add any additional routes. You can 
manually add static routes for additional networks that your router needs 
to know about, or you can load a routing protocol that shares routing table 
information with other routers. Either way, there must be a route to any 
networks you wish to communicate with.
 
To find out more about routing and the routing table, refer back to Book III, 
Chapters 1 and 2.
Name resolution
If you are experiencing communication problems when trying to connect to 
other systems via a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), you need to ensure 
that your systems and devices can resolve the name. To resolve names of 
other devices or systems that you connect to by name, you can add the 
names and matching IP addresses to the hostname table, or configure your 
router to send DNS queries to a DNS server if you expect to use FQDN on the 
router.
If you suspect that name resolution is the problem, connect to the device or 
system you are trying to communicate with by the IP address instead of the 
FQDN. If name resolution is the problem, communication should occur when 
using the IP address.
 
You can use the show hosts command to display the local hostname table 
on a Cisco device.
To read more about name resolution check out Book II, Chapter 4.
Using Show Commands to View Configuration
Now that you understand some of the areas where problems can occur, it 
is important to review the Cisco IOS commands you can use to help identify 
the physical and logical connectivity issues. Throughout this book, you find 
out about many commands you can use to display your configuration, 
but I want to make sure that I summarize those commands here in the 
troubleshooting chapter. I first review how to look at the configuration files, 
then give you some guidelines for using commands in layer-1 and layer-2 
troubleshooting, and then cover troubleshooting layer 3. After that, I remind 
you how to discover neighboring network devices.

426
Using Show Commands to View Configuration
 
You will be tested on these commands heavily on the CCENT certification 
exam, so be sure you understand what to look for with each command.
Viewing configuration files
When you are troubleshooting problems on routers and switches, the first 
commands I tend to use are the show commands to display configuration 
files — the show running-config and the show startup-config 
commands. Here is an example:
NY-R1#show running-config
Building configuration...
version 12.4
no service password-encryption
hostname NY-R1
ip ssh version 1
interface FastEthernet0/0
 ip address 23.0.0.1 255.0.0.0
 duplex auto
 speed auto
interface Serial0/2/0
 ip address 24.0.0.1 255.0.0.0
 clock rate 64000
ip classless
ip route 25.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 24.0.0.2 
line con 0
line vty 0 4
 login
 
Using the show running-config command displays the commands that 
were used to configure the device, and most times it will lead you to the 
cause of the problem.
 
The CCENT certification exam will give you many simlets where you need 
to determine a problem in the configuration of the router. One of the 
approaches you can use to determine the problem is to show the running 
configuration and look for a mistake in a command. Eventually, Cisco will not 
allow you to use the show running-config command, so you will need to 
know other show commands to identify what the problem is!

Using Show Commands to View Configuration
Viewing router configuration
It is important to know how to view your running configuration, as it displays 
the commands used to configure the Cisco device, but using a number of 
other show commands can display status information that can better help 
you understand the cause of a problem.
Layer-1 and layer-2 troubleshooting
You find out earlier in this chapter that when troubleshooting communication 
problems, you should confirm the correct cables are used to make the 
connection and verify the cables are connected properly to the device. This 
is how you troubleshoot layer 1 of the OSI model — the physical layer.
You can use some Cisco device commands to view the status of layer-1 and 
layer-2 information regarding the network communication. For example, 
when troubleshooting, you want to know if there is a link and if a data link 
protocol is configured. The following sections discuss commands that you 
can use to answer these questions.
The show interfaces command
You are introduced to the show interfaces command in Book II, Chapter 
2, and it is a very popular command to use when troubleshooting why 
communication cannot occur. When you are using the show interfaces 
command and you wish to verify that the connection and layer-2 protocol 
are configured properly, you look for the typical Interface is up, line 
protocol is up status on the interface, as shown here:
NY-R1>show interfaces
FastEthernet0/0 is up, line protocol is up
  Hardware is Lance, address is 0010.11d9.d001 (bia 
0010.11d9.d001)
  Internet address is 23.0.0.1/8
  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 100000 Kbit, DLY 100 usec, rely 255/255, 
load 1/255
  Encapsulation ARPA, loopback not set
  ARP type: ARPA, ARP Timeout 04:00:00, 
 (output cut for briefness)
FastEthernet0/1 is administratively down, line protocol is 
down
  Hardware is Lance, address is 0010.11d9.d002 (bia 
0010.11d9.d002)
  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 100000 Kbit, DLY 100 usec, rely 255/255, 
load 1/255
  Encapsulation ARPA, loopback not set
  (Output has been cut for briefness)
Serial0/2/0 is up, line protocol is up
  Hardware is HD64570

428
Using Show Commands to View Configuration
  Internet address is 24.0.0.1/8
  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 128 Kbit, DLY 20000 usec, rely 255/255, 
load 1/255
  Encapsulation HDLC, loopback not set, keepalive set (10 
sec)
  (Output has been cut for briefness)
In the preceding code, I have bolded the relevant portions of the output. 
The line that says FastEthernet 0/0 is up, line protocol is up 
is the status on the physical link (the interface) and the layer-2 protocol, 
which allows the communication to occur. It is important to understand how 
to read the interface status — if the link is down, the protocol will never be 
up, so the problem is physical in nature and not due to the wrong protocol 
being loaded. If the interface is up, but the protocol is down, you have a 
mistake in the protocol configuration at either end of the link — so that 
should be your focus.
In the code here, you can also see the layer-2 protocol that is used on each 
of the interfaces. The layer-2 protocol is known as the encapsulation protocol. 
The Fast Ethernet interfaces use an encapsulation protocol of ARPA, meaning 
that Ethernet is the layer-2 protocol, but the serial link should show a different 
protocol, such as HDLC or PPP. This is important to note when viewing the 
configuration because both ends of the link must use the same encapsulation 
protocol for communication to occur.
The show interface serial 0/0 command
Instead of using the show interfaces command to view all status 
information on all interfaces, you can just view the status of a particular 
interface by using the show interface type command, like this:
NY-R1>show interface serial 0/2/0
Serial0/2/0 is up, line protocol is up
  Hardware is HD64570
  Internet address is 24.0.0.1/8
  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 128 Kbit, DLY 20000 usec, rely 255/255, 
load 1/255
  Encapsulation HDLC, loopback not set, keepalive set (10 
sec)
  (Output has been cut for briefness)
The show ip interface brief command
A great command to use when troubleshooting is the show ip interface 
brief command. This command displays a table-like view that lists the 
status of each of the interfaces. Again, you can identify the problem as being 
layer 1 or layer 2 by looking at the output — a layer-1 problem means there 
is a physical problem with the cable, while layer-2 issues are related to the 
protocol. (See Figure 5-2.)

The show controllers serial 0/0 command
The last command I want to mention that relates to troubleshooting layer 
1 and layer 2 is the show controllers serial slot/port command. 
This command has the benefit of displaying whether the serial interface acts 
as the DCE or DTE device, and it also displays the clock rate.
NY-R1#show controllers serial0/2/0
Interface Serial0/2/0
Hardware is PowerQUICC MPC860

(output has been cut for briefness)
 
In the preceding code, you can replace any interface types and numbers 
with the interface that you are troubleshooting.
Layer-3 troubleshooting
When troubleshooting layer 3 of the OSI model, you are moving away from 
the physical aspect of networking and into the logical area. As mentioned 
earlier in this chapter, when you are troubleshooting layer 3, you are dealing 
with the IP protocol and features of IP such as logical addressing and routing. 
IP addresses
When troubleshooting the IP addresses assigned to the interfaces, you 
can verify the addresses by using the same commands you use when 
troubleshooting layer 1 and layer 2, including the show interfaces and 
the show ip interface brief commands.

430
Using Show Commands to View Configuration
The reason you can use these commands to troubleshoot IP-related issues is 
that these commands show the layer-3 address that is configured on each of 
the interfaces as well. Use these commands to verify that you do not have a 
typo in the addressing.
Routing
After verifying the IP address (see the previous section), you next need to 
check that routing is configured properly. You do this by checking the routing 
table with the show ip route command to ensure that all destination 
networks exist in the routing table.
NY-R1>show ip route
Codes: C - connected, S - static, I - IGRP, R - RIP, M - 
mobile, B – BGP, D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, 
   (output cut for briefness)
Gateway of last resort is not set

C    24.0.0.0/8 is directly connected, Serial0/2/0
S    25.0.0.0/8 [1/0] via 24.0.0.2
If you are missing any routes, you may have to add them manually. Another 
reason you might be missing routes is a routing protocol used to share 
routing table information is not running on your router. To verify information 
about routing protocols such as the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) or 
Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP), use the show ip protocols 
command, as shown here:
NY-R1>show ip protocols
Routing Protocol is “rip”

Using Show Commands to View Configuration
 
You need to know RIP for the CCENT certification exam, and for this reason, 
I have loaded RIP on the router and displayed the output of the show ip 
protocols command. To find out more about RIP, see Book III, Chapter 2.
There are a few points to note about the preceding code. First, notice at the 
top of the code that the routing protocol is RIP. If one of your other routers is 
configured for a different protocol (maybe EIGRP), this would be the reason 
the routers are not sharing routing table information — they need to use the 
same protocol!
You can also see that the version of RIP messages sent here is RIPv1, but I 
can receive any version of RIP messages (version 1 or version 2). In addition, 
notice that RIP has been configured to advertise networks 23.0.0.0 and 
24.0.0.0. This is important because if other routers are not receiving 
knowledge of your 24 network, it might mean that you forgot to list it as a 
network to advertise. This setting shows that you did not forget to configure 
network 24.0.0.0 as a network to advertise.
The last point to note in the output is the passive interface setting. You can 
configure RIP not to send RIP messages out an interface, such as the one 
connected to the Internet. If you find that a network is not receiving RIP 
messages, you might have configured the passive interface by mistake. This 
setting verifies that!
Viewing network topology
On the CCENT certification exam, you will be required to know how to 
document what type of routers and switches are used across the network. 
You can use the CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol) commands that are 
discussed in Book II, Chapter 3, to discover neighboring network devices 
and information such as the IP addresses of the devices, the type of device 
(router or switch), and the model of the device (2900 or 2800).
The following list reviews some of the CDP commands, but be sure to go 
back and read over CDP in Book II, Chapter 3 for a complete review:
 
✦ show cdp neighbors: Displays basic information about all neighboring 
devices, such as the name of the device (known as the device ID), the 
type of device, and the model. You do not see the IP address of the 
devices with this command.
 
✦ show cdp neighbors detail: Displays all information about each 
device, including the name of the device, type of device, model, and the 
IP address of the device!
 
✦ show cdp entry device_ID: Displays all information for a particular 
device by supplying the name of the device.

432
Using Debug Commands
 
Be prepared for questions that expect you to know all of the different show 
commands discussed in this chapter. You will be allowed to view the 
running-config in some questions, but in other questions, Cisco disables that 
command, which forces you to know the other show commands!
Using Debug Commands
If you configure your Cisco router and the features that have been configured 
do not work as expected, what can you do, other than view the configuration? 
What you can do is use the debugging feature built into Cisco devices to give 
you detailed information about different events as they occur! This section 
discusses the purpose of debugging, and it also tells you how to enable and 
disable debugging.
Knowing how to use debugging efficiently
Debugging is a feature that you can enable on the Cisco router to display 
detailed information about different events as they occur. For example, if 
you are troubleshooting to find out why you are not getting the RIP routing 
table entries in your routing table, it could be because you are not receiving 
the RIP messages. Without a feature such as debugging, it is hard to determine 
if you are actually sending and receiving RIP updates. It is easy to determine 
the entries are not in the routing table, but challenging to determine why.
Debugging is one of those troubleshooting features you enable to help you 
diagnose a problem, but because it is resource-intensive (puts a heavy load 
on the CPU on the router), it is important to enable it to troubleshoot. You 
should then disable it as soon as possible; I do not recommend leaving 
debugging running for long periods of time.
You can reduce the load that debugging places on your Cisco device by 
enabling debugging for only the IOS feature you are troubleshooting. There 
are dozens of debugging options, and you want to debug only the features 
you need to troubleshoot. For example, if you are troubleshooting RIP on 
the router, you enable debugging of only the RIP protocol and do not enable 
debugging of all features on the router.
 
Debugging is resource-intensive; therefore, you should enable debugging 
for only the feature you are troubleshooting, and then disable debugging as 
soon as possible.

Using Debug Commands
Looking at a debugging example
Let’s look at an example of debugging. Let’s assume you are having trouble 
with the NY-R1 router: The RIP routing table entries from other routers are 
not appearing in NY-R1’s routing table. You decide that you need to enable 
RIP debugging. To do that, you use the debug command and then specify ip 
rip as parameters:
NY-R1#debug ip rip
RIP protocol debugging is on
In the preceding code, RIP debugging is enabled with the debug ip rip 
command. The Cisco IOS enables RIP debugging and then gives you 
confirmation that RIP debugging has been enabled.
After you enable debugging, you start to receive messages at the console as 
RIP messages are sent or received by the router. This is what debugging is 
all about — displaying information about packets or events that occur on 
the router!
The following code displays some of the messages that are then displayed 
at the console when RIP messages are sent or received by the router. Notice 
that you can see the version of RIP being used to send or receive the update 
(version 1). For messages received, you see who the sender is, and on what 
interface the message was received on. You also see RIP messages sent and 
on what interface the message is sent with. Eventually, you see that the 
updates are applied to the router.
NY-R1#RIP: received v1 update from 24.0.0.2 on Serial0/2/0
      25.0.0.0 in 1 hops
RIP: sending  v1 update to 255.255.255.255 via 
FastEthernet0/0 (23.0.0.1)
RIP: build update entries
      network 24.0.0.0 metric 1
      network 25.0.0.0 metric 2
RIP: sending  v1 update to 255.255.255.255 via Serial0/2/0 
(24.0.0.1)
RIP: build update entries
      network 23.0.0.0 metric 1
As I mention earlier, you can enable debugging on a number of different 
types of events. The following is a listing of priv exec commands that enable 
debugging for popular events to troubleshoot on the Cisco router.

434
Using Debug Commands
 
✦ debug all: Enables debugging of all events.
 
 I do not recommend enabling all debugging, as it places a heavy 
processing load on the router.
 
✦ debug eigrp: Permits debugging of the EIGRP routing protocol.
 
✦ debug ppp: Facilitates debugging of the Point-to-Point Protocol used for 
communication over a serial link.
 
✦ debug ip icmp: Allows debugging of ICMP messages sent by the 
router. The following is an example of the result of enabling ICMP 
debugging:
NY-R1#debug ip icmp
ICMP packet debugging is on
NY-R1#
ICMP: echo reply sent, src 24.0.0.1, dst 24.0.0.2
ICMP: echo reply sent, src 24.0.0.1, dst 24.0.0.2
ICMP: echo reply sent, src 24.0.0.1, dst 24.0.0.2
ICMP: echo reply sent, src 24.0.0.1, dst 24.0.0.2
ICMP: echo reply sent, src 24.0.0.1, dst 24.0.0.2
 
✦ debug ip nat: Enables debugging of Network Address Translation. 
This allows you to see packets that are passing through the NAT device 
and includes translated address information.
 
✦ debug ip ospf: Permits debugging of the OSPF routing protocol and 
viewing information about OSPF-related events. 
 
✦ debug ip rip: Facilitates debugging of RIP, as you saw earlier in this 
section.
 
✦ debug ip packet: Displays information about all packets that are sent 
and received on the router. Information displayed includes the source 
and destination IP address of the packet:
R1#debug ip packet
Packet debugging is on
R1#
IP: s=24.0.0.2 (Serial0/2/0), d=24.0.0.1 (Serial0/2/0), len 0, rcvd 3
IP: tableid=0, s=24.0.0.1 (local), d=24.0.0.2 (Serial0/2/0), routed via 
RIB
IP: s=24.0.0.1 (local), d=24.0.0.2 (Serial0/2/0), len 0, sending
IP: s=23.0.0.1 (local), d=255.255.255.255 (FastEthernet0/0), len 0, 
sending broad/multicast
IP: s=24.0.0.1 (local), d=255.255.255.255 (Serial0/2/0), len 0, sending 
broad/multicast
 
Once you have enabled debugging, the debug information goes to the 
console by default. This becomes an issue if you Telnet into the router — 
you want the debug information to go to your Telnet session window. To 
configure debug information to be sent to the Telnet terminal session, use 
the terminal monitor command from privilege exec mode.

Chapter Summary
Disabling debugging
After you troubleshoot the problem you are facing on the router, gather the 
debugging information, and solve the problem, you need to disable debugging 
on the router.
The first command to disable debugging is to place the no keyword in front 
of the command you used to enable debugging. For example, to disable RIP 
debugging you use the no debug ip rip command:
R1#no debug ip rip
RIP protocol debugging is off
Notice in the preceding code that after RIP debugging is disabled, the IOS 
reports back to you that RIP debugging has been turned off. The problem 
with disabling a specific debugging feature is that you may have enabled 
debugging of multiple types of events, but you have turned off only one 
debugging event. It is therefore a best practice to disable all debugging with 
the no debug all command once you have completed troubleshooting.
R1#no debug all
All possible debugging has been turned off
Notice that after you use the no debug all command, the feedback 
displayed lets you know that all debugging has been turned off (versus just 
turning off RIP debugging, as seen in the previous example).
 
It is a best practice to disable all debugging with the no debug all 
command once you have finished troubleshooting! This ensures that you 
have not forgotten about a debugging feature that was enabled.
Chapter Summary
This chapter focuses the discussion on troubleshooting communication 
problems and using commands to diagnose problems. The following are 
some key points to remember for the real world and when preparing for the 
exam:
 
✦ Troubleshoot layer-1 and layer-2 characteristics of the network first 
when you’re having connectivity issues.
 
✦ When troubleshooting layer 1, ensure that you are using the correct 
cables and that they are properly connected to the ports.
 
✦ When troubleshooting layer 2, ensure that the data link protocol is set 
(either Ethernet, PPP, or HDLC) and verify related settings such as the 
clock rate.

✦ After verifying the physical aspect of the network, you can then move 
on to checking the logical aspect of that network, such as the network 
layer, also known as layer 3.
 
✦ When troubleshooting layer 3, verify the IP address configuration and 
routing table information.
 
✦ When preparing for the exam, be sure to review the different show 
commands discussed in this chapter.
 
✦ When answering troubleshooting-type questions on the CCENT 
certification exam, view the running-config first and then use some of 
the show commands to identify the problem.
 
✦ Debugging is a great troubleshooting feature that writes detailed event 
messages, providing information on activity that is occurring on the 
router.
 
✦ You can use the debug command to enable different levels of debugging. 
Avoid using the debug all command, as it places a heavy load on the 
router.
 
✦ Be sure to disable debugging with the no debug all command as soon 
as you are done troubleshooting.

Troubleshooting Network Communication
Answers
 1 A. When an interface shows a status of down, . . . down, you should look to 
the physical (layer-1) components of the network because the line protocol will 
not be up unless the interface is up. See “Layer-1 and layer-2 troubleshooting.”
 2 B. When troubleshooting your serial port and wanting to verify whether 
you have configured the interface as the DCE or DTE device, use the show 
controllers serial slot/port command. Review “Viewing router 
configuration.”
 3 C. When the interface status displays as up, . . . down, this is an indication 
that the data link protocol has not been configured properly. With a serial port, 
check that a layer-2 protocol such as HDLC or PPP has been configured. Check 
out “Layer-1 and layer-2 troubleshooting.”
 4 D. When you disable debugging, use the no debug all command so that you 
can be sure that all levels of debugging are disabled. Debugging places extra 
processing load on the router, which means you do not want it running if it is 
not needed. Peruse “Disabling debugging.”
 5 B. Of the commands listed, only the show cdp neighbors detail command 
displays a list of neighboring devices and their IP addresses. Take a look at 
“Viewing network topology.”
 6 D. When trying to identify the point in the communication pathway that is 
failing, use the traceroute command, which sends you status information 
with each router that is hit on the way to the destination. Peek at “The tracer-
oute command.”
 7 C. If an interface is shown as administratively down, try to bring the interface up 
by using the no shutdown command on the interface. Look over “Port 
shutdown.”
 8 B, D. If the link light on an interface displays green, it indicates that a physical 
connection is established between the two points, and a data link protocol is 
configured at either end. Study “LED indicators.”
 9 A, D. The show ip arp command and the show arp command can be used to 
view the ARP cache on a Cisco router. Refer to “Viewing the ARP cache.”
 10 A. After you have verified the physical components and the IP addresses, you 
should verify that there is a route in the routing table to the destination network. 
Examine “Routing.”

O
ne of the most important skills to have if you are going to support net-
worked systems or systems connected to the Internet is the ability of 
securing systems and networks. In order to be successful as a network pro-
fessional today, you need to have a solid understanding of network security 
and ways to protect the network.
I remember when a close friend of mine had his Web site totally replaced 
by a hacker. My friend’s Web site files were replaced with inappropriate 
content, and he wondered how on Earth someone had hacked his server. It 
seems amazing now, but back then (circa 1994) a lot of companies did not 
use firewalls because they were not aware of the risks involved in having a 
computer connected directly to the Internet. Back then, people thought, “I 
have a password on the administrator account, so I am secure.”
In this chapter, you find out about the basic concepts and terminology 
related to information system security and network security. Be sure to read 
this chapter carefully, and make sure you understand the topics, as you will 
be tested on basic security concepts with the CCENT certification exam. 
Have fun with this topic area — security is a very exciting field!

Introduction to Security Terminology

Introduction to Security Terminology
Let me start the discussion by going over some basic security concepts and 
terminology. The CCENT certification exam expects you to have some 
background in security best practices, so this chapter is designed to expose 
the concepts to you. The next chapter looks at specific steps you need to 
take to secure your Cisco devices.
Authentication
Authentication is the process of proving one’s identity to the network 
environment. Typically, authentication involves typing a username and 
password on a system, and it is then verified against an account database 
before you are granted access. There are different methods you can use to 
authenticate to a system or network — you can supply a valid username and 
password or maybe even use biometrics to be authenticated. Biometrics is 
the concept of using a unique physical characteristic of yourself to authenticate 
to the system, such as a fingerprint, a retina scan, or voice recognition to 
prove your identity. 
Consider these three different forms of authentication, known as authentication 
factors, and their uses:
 
✦ Something you have: Dependent on the user having an object in her 
possession to prove who she is. An example of this authentication is 
possession of an ID card or door key.
 
✦ Something you know: Dependent on the user knowing a piece of 
information to validate who he is. Examples of this are knowledge of a 
password, pass code, or even a PIN (personal identification number).
 
✦ Something you are: Dependent on you proving your identity by 
something you are, such as a fingerprint or retina scan — so biometrics 
falls into this authentication factor.
Most authentication systems use a two-form authentication factor, where 
two of the three factors mentioned here are used. For example, it is not 
enough to have the ATM card in your possession to use it — you must know 
the PIN for that card as well.
Smart card
A popular authentication device used today in networking environments 
is a smart card, which is a small, ATM card–like device that contains your 
account information. You insert the smart card into a smart card reader 
that is connected to a computer, and then you enter the PIN associated with 
the smart card. This is an example of securing an environment by requiring 
the user to not only have the card, but also know the PIN — an example of 
two-form authentication.

Book IV

Introduction to Security Terminology
Strong passwords
It is really hard to talk about authentication without talking about ensuring 
your usage of strong passwords on systems and devices. A strong password 
is a password that is very difficult for hackers to guess or crack because it 
contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters, a mix of numbers 
and letters, and is a minimum of six characters long.
Authorization
After someone is authenticated to a system or device, he is then granted or 
denied access to resources such as files and printers, or given limited 
privileges to a device. Authorization is the process of giving a person 
permission to access a resource or a device.
 
Do not confuse authentication and authorization: You must be first 
authenticated to the network; then, after authentication, you can access the 
resources and perform the tasks that you have been authorized for.
An example of authorization in the networking world is choosing to 
authorize a system on the network (meaning we allow it to connect to the 
network through a port on the switch) by its MAC address. In high-security 
environments, this is very popular, and in the Cisco world, this is known as 
port security.
Vulnerability
Vulnerability is the term we use for a weakness in a system or device. The 
vulnerability is created accidentally by the manufacturer and is typically the 
result of a code mistake in the software or firmware.
Using strong passwords
A number of years ago, I had a coworker 
who was always trying to get me to guess his 
passwords. He thought I had some magical 
trick or program that was cracking them, but 
all I was doing was guessing his passwords. I 
remember one time he changed it, and I could 
not guess it — until one night when we were 
at a social function for work and all he talked 
about was the Flyers hockey team. I remember 
sitting there thinking, “I bet that is his 
password.” Sure enough, the next day at work, 
I tried flyers as his password, and it worked. 
Now the lesson here is that he should have 
at least mixed the case of the word flyers to 
make something like flYeRs, or even better, 
thrown a symbol in there by replacing the s 
with a $. I would have had a much harder time 
trying to guess his password if he had used 
flYeR$ instead. This is an example of a strong 
password.

452
Introduction to Security Terminology
Hackers find out about vulnerabilities in the software and hardware devices 
we use by purposely testing the limitations of the device or software. Once 
they discover the vulnerability, they work on figuring out how they can 
exploit it.
Exploit
An exploit takes advantage of a weakness, or vulnerability, in a piece of 
software or a device. For example, years ago it was found that most Web 
servers were vulnerable to attack because the Web server did not verify the 
file being requested in a URL. Hackers exploited this by starting to send com-
mands in a URL that would navigate the folder structure of the Web server 
and call for files other than normal Web pages. This is known as folder tra-
versing, and it was a popular exploit on Web servers.
What about CIA?
When working in the security field, you will most likely run into the terms 
confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA). These are the fundamental goals of 
security, and ultimately, every security control that we put in place satisfies 
one of the elements of CIA.
Confidentiality
Confidentiality is the concept of keeping information secret. In order to 
implement confidentiality, you may look to securing data with permissions, 
but you also have to look at encrypting the information that is stored on disk 
or travels across the network.
Integrity
Integrity is the veracity of the data. Data integrity is about ensuring that when 
you receive information, it is the information that was actually sent and not 
something that was modified in transit. Hashing is one of the popular methods 
of ensuring data integrity. With hashing, the data sender runs the data 
through a mathematical algorithm (known as a hashing algorithm), and an 
answer is created. When the recipient receives the information, she runs the 
data on the same algorithm to see if she gets the same mathematical answer. 
If the same answer is calculated, she knows that the data has not been 
altered in transit.
Availability
Availability is the concept that the data stored on the network is always 
accessible to the people who want the data — the people who are authorized 
to access it, that is. As security professionals, we need to ensure the availability 

Book IV
Chapter 1
Network Security 
Terminology
453
Identifying Types of Attacks
of the data, and there are a number of ways to ensure availability. For 
example, you can do backups, use RAID volumes for storing your data, and 
implement high-availability solutions such as clustering technologies (multiple 
servers running the same application, or service, so if one server fails the 
request for the service is sent to the second server).
Identifying Types of Attacks
Now that you are familiar with some basic network security terms, let’s talk 
about some popular attacks against businesses today. These attacks may 
sometimes seem far-fetched, but in reality, they happen every day! This 
section outlines some of the most popular types of attacks that can happen 
in today’s networking environments.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, it is critical that you are familiar with the 
different types of attacks covered in this section. You are sure to get a few 
questions about types of attacks.
To me, a hacker is someone with the technical expertise to bypass the 
security of a network or a system. A hacker knows how to use features of a 
piece of software or hardware to gain access to restricted areas of a network 
and then use those features against you and your system. For example, an 
e-commerce Web site connects to a product database behind the scenes so 
that you can get a list of products when you visit the site. A hacker knows 
how to input data into the site to manipulate the database server into 
executing the code that the hacker wants to execute — and this happens 
because the hacker understands the technologies used behind the scenes.
There are two major types of hackers:
 
✦ Black-hat hackers: Break into a system or network for malicious reasons 
or for personal gain. The black-hat hacker could be looking for financial 
gain, bragging rights, or revenge.
 
✦ White-hat hackers: Try to hack into software or hardware in order to 
understand how to protect others from black-hat hackers. These are the 
good guys. 
 
Hackers use a number of different types of attacks to hack into a network, 
device, or a system. Sometimes an attack lays the groundwork for a future 
or different type of attack: That is, the initial attack does not seem all that 
dangerous, but it is used in the future to gain unauthorized access.

454
Identifying Types of Attacks
Social engineering attacks
A social engineering attack occurs when a hacker tries to obtain information 
or gain access to a system through social contact with a user. Typically, the 
hacker poses as someone else and tries to trick a user into divulging personal 
or corporate information that allows the hacker access to a system or network.
For example, a hacker calls your company’s phone number, listed in the 
phone book, and poses as a technical support person for your company. 
He tells the user who answers the phone that a new application has been 
deployed on the network, and for the application to work, the user’s password 
must be reset. After the password is reset to what the hacker wants, he 
might “verify” with the user the credential that the user uses. A user who 
is not educated on social engineering might divulge important information 
without thinking that the caller might have malicious intent.
 
A social engineering attack is an attack where a hacker tries to trick a user 
or administrator into divulging sensitive information through social contact. 
After the sensitive information is obtained, the hacker can then use that 
information to compromise the system or network.
This example might sound unrealistic, but it happens all the time. If you 
work for a small company, you might not experience a social engineering 
attack. In a large corporate environment, though, it is extremely possible 
that a social engineering attack would be successful if the company does not 
educate its users. A large company usually stations the IT staff or management 
at the head office, but employees in most branch locations have never talked 
to IT management. The branch employees would not recognize the voices of 
the IT folks, so a hacker could impersonate someone from the head office — 
and the user at the branch office would never know the difference.
There are a number of popular social engineering attack scenarios — and 
network administrators are just as likely to be social engineering victims as 
“regular” employees, so they need to be aware. Here are some popular social 
engineering attack scenarios:
 
✦ Hacker impersonates an IT administrator. The hacker calls or e-mails an 
employee and pretends to be the network administrator. The hacker tricks 
the employee into divulging a password or even resetting the password.
 
✦ Hacker impersonates a user. The hacker calls or e-mails the network 
administrator and pretends to be a user who forgot her password, 
asking the administrator to reset her password for her.
 
✦ Hacker e-mails a program to network users. The hacker typically 
e-mails all the users on a network, telling them about a security bug in 
the OS. He advises users to run the update.exe file attached to the 
e-mail. In this example, update.exe is the attack file — it opens the 
computer up so that the hacker can access the computer.

Book IV
Chapter 1
Network Security 
Terminology
455
Identifying Types of Attacks
 
 When you are working as a network professional, educate your users 
never to run a program that has been e-mailed to them. Most software 
vendors, such as Microsoft, state that they will never e-mail a program 
to a person: Instead, they will e-mail a URL, but it is up to the person to 
go to the URL and download the update. A great book to find out more 
on the process a hacker employs to compromise a system is Kevin 
Beaver’s Hacking For Dummies, 3rd edition (Wiley).
Network-based attacks
A network-based attack uses networking technologies or protocols to 
perform the attack, and they are some of the most popular types of attacks 
today. The following explains the terminology associated with seven 
important network-based attacks.
 
Ensure that you are familiar with the different types of network-based 
attacks for the CCENT certification exam.
Password attacks
A password attack involves the hacker trying to figure out the passwords 
for different accounts on a system, or a password that guards a device. The 
three major types of password attacks are dictionary attack, hybrid attack, 
and brute force attack.
With a dictionary attack, hackers use a program in conjunction with two text 
files to automatically try a number of passwords.
 
✦ One text file contains the most popular user accounts — such as 
administrator, admin, and root — found on networks. This file is termed 
the user account text file.
 
✦ The second text file contains a list of all the words in the English 
dictionary, and then some. Hackers can also obtain dictionary files for 
different languages. This file is termed the dictionary text file or password 
list file.
The dictionary attack program then tries to log in with every user account 
in the user account text file with every word in the dictionary text file, 
attempting to determine the password for the user account.
 
To protect against a dictionary attack, be sure to use strong passwords that 
mix letters, numbers, and symbols. This prevents the passwords from being 
found in the dictionary. Also, passwords are normally case sensitive, so be 
sure to use a mix of both lowercase and uppercase characters. Mixing the 
case of a password means a hacker not only has to guess the password but 
also the combination of uppercase and lowercase characters.

456
Identifying Types of Attacks
Also note that because there are dictionary files for different languages you 
should not use words found in any dictionary. This means avoiding not only 
English words, but also French, German, Hebrew . . . even Klingon!
A second type of password attack is known as a hybrid password attack. A 
hybrid password attack is like a dictionary attack in the sense it uses a dictionary 
file, but it also tries variations of the password by placing numbers on the 
end of the word and sometimes replacing popular characters. For example, 
after the hybrid attack program tries all the passwords in the dictionary file, 
it may then try them again by replacing any letter a with @ in the words.
Hackers can also perform a brute force attack. With a brute force attack, 
instead of trying to use words from a dictionary file, the hacker uses a 
program that tries to figure out your password by mathematically calculating 
all potential passwords with a certain length and set of characters. Figure 1-1 
shows a popular password-cracking tool known as LC4. Tools like this are great 
for network administrators to audit how strong their users’ passwords are.
 
Figure 1-1: 
Cracking 
passwords 
with LC4.
 
 
To protect against dictionary attacks, we use strong passwords, but to 
protect against a brute force password attack, we must implement an 
account lockout policy, where after three bad logon attempts, the account is 
locked and cannot be used. 
If you have configured an account lockout policy to protect your account 
database, understand that only works if the hacker is connected to your 
network and attempting to hack into live systems (known as an online 
attack). If the hacker can get a copy of your account database, or hashed 
passwords in a configuration file, and take that away with him (known as an 
offline attack) then there is no protection against the brute force attack.

Identifying Types of Attacks
Denial of service
Another popular network attack is a denial of service (DoS) attack, which 
can come in many forms and is designed to cause a system or network 
device to be so busy that it cannot service a real request from a client, 
essentially overloading the system or device and shutting it down.
For example, say you have an e-mail server and a hacker attacks the e-mail 
server by flooding the server with e-mail messages, causing it to be so busy 
that it cannot send any more e-mails. You have been denied the service that 
the system was created for.
There are a number of different types of DoS attacks that have come out 
over the years, including the following: 
 
✦ Ping of death: The hacker continuously pings your system with over-
sized packets causing your system to crash.
 
✦ SYN flood: The hacker performs a partial three-way handshake with 
each port on the system. This uses up memory on your system and 
eventually crashes the system. The hacker accomplishes this by sending 
a SYN message to a number of different ports, but when your system 
replies with an ACK/SYN, the hacker does not complete the process 
with an ACK. As a result your system holds that partial connection in 
memory, waiting for the ACK. For more on the three-way handshake, 
SYN, and ACK, see Book I, Chapter 4.
 
To protect against denial of service attacks, you need to have a firewall (a 
piece of software or a hardware device that prevents someone from entering 
your system or network) installed, and you should also keep your systems 
and devices patched (apply any updates and security fixes).
Spoofing
Spoofing is a type of attack in which a hacker modifies the source address of 
a frame or packet. There are three major types of spoofing: 
 
✦ MAC spoofing: The hacker alters the source MAC address of the frame. 
 
✦ IP spoofing: The hacker alters the source IP address in a packet. 
 
✦ E-mail spoofing: The hacker alters the source e-mail address to make 
the e-mail look like it came from someone other than the hacker.
An example of a spoof attack is the smurf attack, which is a combination of a 
denial of service and spoofing. Here is how it works:
 
1. The hacker pings a large number of systems but modifies the source 
address of the packet so that the ping request looks like it is coming 
from a different system.

458
Identifying Types of Attacks
 
2. All systems that are pinged reply to the modified source address — an 
unsuspecting victim.
 
3. The victim’s system (most likely a server) receives so many replies to 
the ping request that it is overwhelmed with traffic, causing it to be 
unable to answer any other request from the network.
 
To protect against spoof attacks, you can implement encryption and 
authentication services on the network.
Eavesdropping attack
An eavesdropping attack occurs when a hacker uses some sort of packet 
sniffer program to see all the traffic on the network. Hackers use packet 
sniffers to find out login passwords or to monitor activities. Figure 1-2 shows 
Microsoft Network Monitor, a program that monitors network traffic by 
displaying the contents of the packets.
 
Figure 1-2: 
Using 
Network 
Monitor to 
analyze FTP 
logon traffic.
 
Notice in Figure 1-2 that the highlighted packet (frame 8) shows someone 
logging on with a username of administrator; in frame 11, you can see 
that this user has typed the password P@ssw0rd. In this example, the 
hacker now has the username and password of a network account by 
eavesdropping on the conversation!
 
To protect against eavesdrop attacks, you need encrypt network traffic and 
physically control who can connect to your network.

Chapter 1

Identifying Types of Attacks
Man-in-the-middle
A man-in-the-middle attack involves the hacker intercepting the data in 
transit, potentially modifying the data, and then forwarding the information 
on to the intended recipient. Note that the intended recipient receives the 
information, but the hacker sees the information as well.
Man-in-the-middle attacks are popular with wireless networks at coffee 
shops today. The hacker poisons the ARP cache of the wireless clients so 
that they forward all the traffic to the hacker’s system first, who then forwards 
the information onto the Internet. The clients are still surfing the Internet, 
but what they do not realize is that they are passing through the hacker’s 
laptop first. (And the hacker is typically capturing all the traffic with a 
packet sniffer in hopes of capturing user passwords.)
 
To protect against man-in-the-middle attacks, you need to restrict access to 
the network and implement encryption and authentication services on the 
network.
Session hijacking
A session hijack is similar to a man-in-the-middle attack, but instead of the 
hacker intercepting the data, altering it, and sending it to whomever it was 
destined, the hacker simply hijacks the conversation by disconnecting one 
of the participants off the network (usually via a denial of service attack) and 
then impersonates that person within the conversation. The other party has 
no idea that he or she is communicating with someone other than the original 
person.
 
To protect against session hijacking attacks, you need to restrict access to 
the network and implement encryption and authentication services on the 
network.
Buffer overflow
A very popular type of attack today is a buffer overflow attack, which involves 
the hacker sending more data to a piece of software than the software 
expects. The information sent to an application is typically stored in an 
area of memory known as a buffer. When more data than expected is sent to 
the application, the information is stored in memory beyond the allocated 
buffer. It has been found that if a hacker can store information beyond the 
allocated buffer, he can run his own code that typically results in a remote 
command shell with administrative access. The reason why administrative 
access is gained is because the code executes in the context of the user 
account associated with the software that was hacked — normally an 
administrative account!

460
Identifying Types of Attacks
 
To protect against buffer overflow attacks, you need to keep the system, 
applications, and devices up to date with patches and security fixes.
Software-based attacks
Just like there are a number of different types of network attacks, there are a 
number of software attacks. As you can likely guess, a software attack comes 
through software that a user runs. The most popular software attacks are 
mentioned in the sections that follow, and you should be familiar with them 
for the CCENT certification exam.
SQL injection
A SQL injection attack occurs when the hacker sends Transact SQL 
statements (statements that manipulate a database) into an application so 
that the application will send those statements to the database server to be 
executed. If the application developer does not validate data inputted into 
the application, the hacker can modify the data in the underlying database 
or even manipulate the system.
Viruses
A virus is a program that causes harm to your system. Typically, viruses are 
spread through e-mails and are included in attachments, such as word 
processing documents and spreadsheets. The virus can do any of a number 
of things: It can delete files from your system, modify the system configuration, 
or e-mail all your contacts in your e-mail software. To prevent viruses, install 
antivirus software and do not open any unexpected file attachments that 
arrive in your e-mail.
Trojan horse
A Trojan horse is a type of virus that a user is typically tricked into running 
on the system, and when the software runs, it does something totally 
different from what the user expected it to do. For example, NetBus (an 
older Trojan horse virus) is an example of a Trojan horse virus sent as a file 
called patch.exe. The user receiving the file — typically through an e-mail — 
believes the file will fix a security issue. The problem is that patch.exe is a 
Trojan horse, and when that horse starts running, it opens the computer up 
to allow a hacker to connect to the system.
The hacker then uses a client program, like the one shown in Figure 1-3, to 
connect to the system and start messing with the computer. The hacker can 
do things like launch other programs, flip your screen upside down, eject 
your CD-ROM tray, watch your activity, and modify or delete files!
Worm
A worm is a virus that does not need to be activated by someone opening the 
file. It is self-replicating, meaning that it spreads itself from system to system 

Book IV
Chapter 1
Network Security 
Terminology
461
Looking at Security Devices
automatically, infecting each computer. How the virus spreads depends on 
the virus itself — there have been worm viruses that connect across the 
network automatically to a vulnerable system and then infect that system. 
Recently, worm viruses automatically infect a flash drive that is connected 
to the system so that when you take the drive to the next system, the worm 
infects that system from the flash drive.
 
Figure 1-3:

Trojan virus

NetBus

Logic bomb
A logic bomb is a type of virus or malicious software that was designed to 
wreak havoc on your system on a certain date and time. The scary thing 
about logic bombs is that they seem like useful software until the day the 
programmer decides it will become malicious!
 
To protect against malicious software such as a virus, Trojan horse, worm, 
and a logic bomb, you need to use a firewall and keep your virus definitions 
up-to-date. 
Looking at Security Devices
When looking to secure your systems or networks, you can definitely follow 
best practices such as patching systems or using strong passwords, but 
realistically, you are going to need to use one or more popular security 
devices to secure your environment. In this section, I discuss popular security 
devices you should be familiar with for the CCENT certification exam.
Firewalls
A firewall is a piece of software or a device that is designed to control what 
traffic is allowed to enter or leave the network. Most firewalls control traffic 
that enters the network by analyzing the header of the packet and looking at 
the source IP address, destination IP address, and the source and destination 
port. If the packet trying to enter the network meets certain conditions, such 

462
Looking at Security Devices
as the destination port is 80, the packet is then allowed or denied access to 
the network depending on how the firewall is configured.
There are three major types of firewalls that are popular today:
 
✦ Packet-filtering firewall: A packet-filtering firewall is limited in the sense 
that it filters traffic by the fields in the header such as the source and 
destination IP address and the source and destination port numbers. It 
is very easy for the hacker to bypass this firewall; she can alter the fields 
in the header.
 
✦ Stateful packet inspection firewall: Most firewalls today are stateful 
packet inspection firewalls, which filter traffic by the fields in the header 
but also can understand the context of the conversation. For example, 
a stateful packet inspection firewall knows that before you can send 
data to a Web site you must have had a three-way handshake with the 
system. The firewall stores the “state” of the conversation in a state 
table so it can verify that the packet it is receiving should actually be 
occurring at this point in time.
 
✦ Application-level firewall: An application-level firewall has the benefit 
of not only being able to analyze the fields in the header and being 
stateful, but it has the added benefit of being able to analyze the 
application data that is stored in the packet. For example, an 
application-layer firewall can verify that a three-way handshake has 
occurred and that the destination port is 80, but it can also verify that 
the HTTP command in the packet is a GET and not a POST. These 
firewalls can limit what features of an application are allowed to be 
performed.
There are many different ways to implement a firewall solution, and most 
networks use multiple firewalls to control access to different parts of the 
network. Figure 1-4 shows a very popular firewall solution that uses two 
firewalls.

463
Looking at Security Devices
The first firewall (Firewall1 in Figure 1-4) is connected to the Internet and 
controls what traffic is allowed to pass from the Internet through the 
firewall. You can see that the first firewall has to allow HTTP traffic and DNS 
server traffic through the firewall, as there are public HTTP and DNS servers 
behind the first firewall.
The second firewall (Firewall2 in Figure 1-4) is designed to stop all traffic 
from passing through that firewall in order to protect the private LAN. The 
area between the two firewalls is known as a demilitarized zone (DMZ) and 
is designed to allow selected traffic to enter the zone. This firewall solution 
is known as a screened-subnet as any traffic that passes into the DMZ is 
screened first and ensured it is authorized traffic.
Another very popular firewall solution that relates to Cisco devices is what 
is known as a screened-host firewall, shown in Figure 1-5. It is a topology that 
has the Internet connected to your router, which will then filter, or screen, 
what packets are allowed to pass through and reach the firewall.

Cisco router
 
Cisco routers use access lists (a list of rules that determine what packets are 
allowed to enter or leave the network) to control what traffic is allowed to 
pass through the router. Access lists are beyond the scope of the CCENT 
certification but are required knowledge to pass the CCNA certification 
exam.
Intrusion detection system
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or piece of software that 
monitors activity and identifies any suspicious activity on a network 
or system. When the IDS identifies the suspicious activity, it logs the 
activity and may even send notification to the administrator as an alert.

464
Looking at Security Devices
There are two main types of intrusion detection systems: 
 
✦ Host-based IDS: This is typically software installed on the system that 
monitors activity on that one system. If suspicious activity is found on 
the system an alert is generated and the administrator is notified.
 
✦ Network-based IDS: Monitors network traffic and identifies suspicious 
traffic on the entire network, not just one system! The network-based 
IDS captures network traffic and then compares that to signatures in the 
IDS software. This analysis indicates what type of traffic is considered 
suspicious.
What action the IDS takes when suspicious activity is found depends on 
what class of intrusion detection system we are talking about. There are two 
major classes of intrusion detection systems:
 
✦ Passive IDS: A passive IDS logs suspicious activity to a file and could 
send an alert to the administrator if alerts have been configured. A 
passive IDS is normally referred to as just an IDS.
 
✦ Active IDS: An active IDS logs the suspicious activity, sends an alert to 
the administrator, and also takes corrective action such as preventing 
the system that is creating the suspicious activity from further accessing 
the network.
 
 An active IDS is now known as an intrusion prevention system (IPS).
 
For the CCENT exam, ensure that you are familiar with the purpose of an intru-
sion detection system. Also, know the difference between an IDS and an IPS.
Switches
I know we talk about switches in detail within Book III, Chapters 3 and 4, 
but I want to make sure that I mention switches here as a security device 
because switches have some great features that help protect a network 
environment. The following are some security features to remember about a 
switch:
 
✦ Filtered traffic: The purpose of a switch is to filter traffic by sending the 
traffic to only the port where the destination MAC address of the frame 
is connected to the switch. This aids in security, as someone else 
connected to the switch cannot easily run a packet sniffer and see all 
traffic on the network. Because the traffic is not sent to the port of the 
person doing the sniffing, there is no opportunity for that person to 
capture and view network traffic.
 
✦ Port security: Port security is the feature on a switch that allows you to 
limit which systems can connect to which ports on the switch. With port 
security, you associate the MAC address of a system with the port, and 
no other system can connect to that port.

Book IV
Chapter 1
Network Security 
Terminology
465
Looking at Security Devices
 
✦ Disable ports: For security reasons, you need to disable any ports on 
the switch that you are not using. This prevents someone from connecting 
an unknown system to the network without your knowledge.
 
✦ VLANs: Virtual LANs allow you to create communication boundaries on 
the switch. You can create multiple VLANs on the switch and then place 
different ports into different VLANs. Systems that are connected to ports 
in one VLAN cannot communicate with systems in another VLAN without 
the use of a router.
 
You find out how to configure security features of Cisco switches in the next 
chapter.
Virtual Private Networks
The final security technology I want to mention is what is known as a virtual 
private network, or VPN. A VPN is responsible for creating an encrypted 
tunnel across an unsecure network such as the Internet. Once the tunnel is 
created between the client and the VPN server, any data that is sent through 
the tunnel is encrypted.
Looking at Figure 1-6, you see that you are in a hotel room in Toronto and 
want to access some files that are in your office in New York. Normally, you 
would not try to access those files across the Internet because you would 
not want the information sent or received in plain text for someone to 
intercept.

As a solution, you install VPN client software on your laptop, which connects 
across the Internet to the VPN server in New York. After the VPN server 
authenticates you with your username and password, you are granted 
access to the network, and the encrypted tunnel is created. Now any data 
sent between the VPN client and the VPN server is secure, as it is encrypted 
in transit.

466
Mitigating Security Threats
 
VPN protocols are responsible for encrypting the data. Examples of VPN 
protocols are the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) and the Layer 2 
Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). Growing in popularity is SSL VPNs, which do not 
require VPN client software on the client systems as the Web browser makes 
the client connection. It should also be noted that VPNs can be created from 
one site to another in order to encrypt all traffic between the two sites (as 
opposed to the clients creating the VPN).
Mitigating Security Threats
Now that you have been introduced to some of the different types of 
network attacks and identified some of the popular network security 
appliances, let’s take a look at how you can minimize potential network 
threats. A fancy term for minimizing the threats is mitigating.
 
Although this section is not intended to be a complete list of the steps to 
take to secure your environment, it is definitely a list of some of the 
fundamental steps you should take — and they will go a long way to helping 
create a secure environment.
Workstations
To help keep your desktop workstations secure, you should consider doing 
the following, at a minimum:
 
✦ Patch your systems. Be sure to keep your systems up to date with 
patches. This includes patching the operating system and all software 
installed.
 
✦ Use antivirus software. Ensure that you have company-approved 
antivirus software installed on all desktop systems.
 
✦ Keep virus definitions up to date. Make sure you are keeping the virus 
software definitions up to date. These definitions allow the virus-protection 
software to know what the current viruses are.
 
✦ Limit administrative accounts. Do not give all the users administrative 
capabilities to the desktop system. Ensure that most users utilize 
restricted accounts and limit how many people have administrative 
access.
 
✦ Maintain user awareness. It is important to ensure users are aware of 
some of the different threats that exist. Educate users on good e-mail 
practices and about social engineering attacks.
Servers
To help keep your servers secure you should contemplate doing the 
following, at a minimum:

Book IV
Chapter 1
Network Security 
Terminology
467
Mitigating Security Threats
 
✦ Patch systems. Be sure to keep your servers up-to-date with patches. 
This includes patching the operating system and all software installed.
 
✦ Use server-class antivirus software. Ensure that you have 
company-approved antivirus software that is designed to run on servers.
 
✦ Keep virus definitions up-to-date. Make sure that you are keeping the 
virus software definitions up-to-date. These definitions allow the 
virus-protection software to know what the current viruses are.
 
✦ Limit administrative accounts. Ensure that you limit how many people 
have administrative access to the servers. The more people making 
changes to a server, the more chances mistakes will happen.
 
✦ Configure permissions. Make certain that all the resources are secured 
with appropriate permissions.
 
✦ Place server in a secure room. Be sure that servers are placed in a 
locked server room, where access to that room is limited to authorized 
personnel.
 
✦ Install a firewall. Depending on the type of server, you may decide to 
limit what traffic can reach the server by installing a software firewall 
on the system. For example, if the system is used only as a Web server, 
I recommend installing a software firewall that allows only HTTP and 
HTTPS traffic to the system.
Network
To help create a more secure network environment, you should consider 
following these general steps, at a minimum:
 
✦ Encrypt traffic. Depending on how sensitive the information is that 
travels on your network, you may decide to encrypt all network traffic. 
 
✦ Use firewalls. Use firewalls to control what type of traffic is allowed to 
enter and leave different areas of the network.
 
✦ Use intrusion detection systems. Be sure to configure an IDS or IPS to 
monitor network activity and notify you of any suspicious activity.
 
✦ Place switches and routers in a secure room. Make sure you are 
storing switches and routers in a locked server room where you 
are limiting access to the room.
 
✦ Implement device security best practices. Ensure that on your switches 
and routers you are following security best practices such as configuring 
passwords, encrypting passwords, and using other switch and router 
device security concepts mentioned in the next chapter!

Chapter Summary
Chapter Summary
This chapter covers the fundamental concepts regarding network security. 
It is an important topic, but understand that this chapter only scratches the 
surface of security concepts. For the CCENT certification, be familiar with 
the following facts about security:
 
✦ Authentication is proving your identity to the system.
 
✦ Authorization is granting someone access to a system or resource after 
he has been authenticated.
 
✦ CIA stands for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
 
✦ A social engineering attack is when the hacker tries to trick someone into 
compromising security through an e-mail or phone call.
 
✦ A buffer overflow attack is when the hacker sends too much data to an 
application, which normally results in administrative control of the 
system in a command shell.
 
✦ There are three types of password attacks: dictionary, hybrid, and brute 
force.
 
✦ A denial of service (DoS) attack is when a hacker attacks a system or 
device by overloading it and causing it to crash or be too busy to perform 
its job.
 
✦ Firewalls control what traffic can enter the network.
 
✦ An intrusion detection system detects suspicious activity and alerts the 
administrator.
 
✦ A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel over an unsecure network such as 
the Internet.

Answers
 1 A. Application-level firewalls can inspect the application-level data, such as what 
application command is executing, and either allow or deny that traffic. See 
“Firewalls.”
 2 A, D. A SYN flood attack and the ping of death attack were popular denial of 
service attacks years back. Review “Denial of service.”
 3 C. The demilitarized zone (DMZ) is where you should place public servers such 
as Web and DNS servers. Check out “Firewalls.”
 4 A. A social engineering attack is when the hacker contacts the victim and tries to 
trick the individual into compromising security. Peruse “Social engineering 
attacks.”
 5 D. A packet-filtering firewall is capable of inspecting only the packet header to 
decide if the packet should be allowed or denied. This type of firewall could be 
easily tricked with a spoof attack. Take a look at “Firewalls.”
 6 B. A buffer overflow attack involves the hacker sending too much data to the 
application, which typically results in administrative access to the system. Peek 
at “Buffer overflow.”
 7 A. A spoof attack is when the hacker alters the source address of a packet in 
order to bypass a security control such as a firewall or access control list. Look

The Importance of Physical Security
476
The Importance of Physical Security
Physical security is one of the first aspects of security in an organization to 
look at, and it is definitely one of those areas of security that is overlooked 
in most organizations.
Physical security deals with controlling how someone can physically gain 
access to your company assets, including personnel and network equipment. 
There are many things to consider when dealing with physical security — 
including preventing unauthorized persons from entering the property, 
moving equipment away from windows, locking rooms containing switches 
and routers, and adjusting workstation CMOS settings — and this section is 
designed to introduce you to some of the fundamental aspects of physical 
security.
Physical premises
The first point to make about physical security is that you need to secure 
the physical premises, or property, of the company. There are a number of 
ways to secure access to the premises, starting with having a barbed wire 
fence surrounding the perimeter of the property, with a security guard at 
the entrance of the premises.
The security guard watches to make sure that all persons entering the 
premises have a valid ID card. The guard can also be responsible for checking 
in any visitors and handing out temporary passes to those visitors. It is 
important in high-security environments that all persons wear the ID badge 
in a visible area so that unauthorized personnel can be identified.
As an IT professional you have a responsibility to help maintain a secure 
environment — not only from a technology side, but also from an organization 
point of view. If you see someone walking around the premises without their 
ID badge in plain view, remind them that it needs to be visible.
Windows and lighting
When assessing physical security within the organization, you want to 
always ensure the employees’ safety, and that includes ensuring that you 
have proper lighting at the entrances and exits, especially if you have 
employees working late at night. You also want to ensure that you have 
proper lighting in the parking area and video surveillance set up to monitor 
those areas. As an IT professional, making decisions on these types of 
controls is not your responsibility but if you notice an unsafe environment 
then you should report it.

Chapter 2

The Importance of Physical Security
You also want to keep a close eye on information and equipment that is 
too close to windows in the building. Having a computer close to a window 
allows for someone to potentially view information on the computer screen. 
Most high-security environments audit the placement of equipment and 
monitors during a security assessment. Move monitors away from the windows, 
if possible. If you cannot move them, angle them so they are not viewable 
through the window.
If computer equipment and other valuables are viewable through a window, 
you may find that someone breaks through the window to swipe the equipment. 
This is something to watch for with laptops as well.
 
Laptops and other portable equipment should be physically secured with 
a lockdown cable. If you check the side of a laptop, you can see a place to 
insert a connector from the lockdown cable so the laptop can be secured to 
the desk.
Secure facility
Part of securing the facility is ensuring that server and equipment rooms are 
locked so that you can control who has access to the server, switches, and 
routers. Ensure that you are using a proven locking system, such as swipe 
cards and numeric keypads, on the doors to the server room. A number of 
key locks are too easy to pick, so try to stay away for the lock-and-key scenario.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, remember that servers, switches, and 
routers should be in a locked room where physical access to the room 
is controlled. Be sure to also put passwords on the switch and router’s 
console, auxiliary, and Telnet ports.
Workstations and servers
I want to make a note about workstations and servers as related to physical 
security. You need to ensure that servers are locked away in the server 
room, where you can control access to them. 
Also understand that if someone can get physical access to a system, that 
person can boot off a CD or DVD and bypass most of the security features of 
the server OS. In high-security environments, you may want to change some 
of the CMOS settings on the workstations and servers to prevent that. You 
can adjust the CMOS settings to control the boot order of the devices and 
disable booting from devices such as CD-ROMs, DVDs, and USB drives. 
You also may want to disable external ports on the workstations to limit the 
likelihood that someone will take a copy of company data home with them 
on a thumb drive.

Cisco Router Best Practices
Cisco Router Best Practices
The main focus of this chapter is to ensure that you understand some of the 
fundamental steps you can take in the configuration of your Cisco devices to 
help create a more secure environment. In this section, you review popular 
tasks, such as setting passwords, configuring user accounts, creating login 
banners, and configuring SSH for your Cisco devices.
Configuring passwords
In Book II, Chapter 2, you find out how to configure passwords on your 
router so that if someone tries to move from user exec mode to priv exec 
mode, she is challenged for a password. Use the following commands on 
your Cisco router to configure passwords for navigating into privilege exec 
mode:
RouterA>enable
RouterA#config term
RouterA(config)#enable password mypass
RouterA(config)#enable secret mysecret
Remember the difference between the enable password command and 
the enable secret command: The enable password is stored in an 
unencrypted format in the device configuration files, while the enable 
secret is encrypted in the configuration. The benefit of encrypting the 
password, known as the secret in this example, is that if someone views your 
configuration file they will be unable to tell what the secret is (because it is 
encrypted). Note that it is a best practice to use the enable secret over 
the enable password. Also note that when both the enable password 
and the enable secret are used, you are required to use the secret when 
logging in to the router. This should be easy to remember, as it makes sense 
that the most secure method is used.
Let’s take a look at the configuration after the enable password and the 
enable secret are set on the router.
RouterA(config)#exit
RouterA#show running-config
Building configuration...

enable secret 5 $1$u76B$IOFVJ7VxfVXYVpGDrFTcI0
enable password mypass
!
(output omitted for briefness)
!

Book IV
Chapter 2
Cisco Device 
Security Best 
Practices
479
Cisco Router Best Practices
Notice in the preceding output that the enable secret has been 
encrypted (you cannot tell that the value is set to the word mysecret), but 
the enable password is stored in clear text. This is a problem, as anyone 
who gets physical access to the router can view the password (I show you 
how to encrypt all passwords in the upcoming “Encrypting passwords” 
section — let us get more passwords in the configuration file first).
 
For the CCENT certification exam, remember that the enable secret 
is encrypted in the configuration and takes precedence over the enable 
password command when both are used.
Not only do you want to set a password for when someone tries to go into 
privilege exec mode, but you also want to set a password on each of the 
different ports that someone may make a connection to in order to gain 
access to your router; these ports are the console port, auxiliary port, and 
the Telnet ports used for remote connections.
Console port password
To set the console port to prompt for a password when someone tries to 
make a connection through it, you use the following commands:
RouterA>enable
RouterA#config term
RouterA(config)#line con 0
RouterA(config-line)#password conpass
RouterA(config-line)#login
Looking at the preceding commands, you see that you first move to global 
configuration to make the change. Then you use the line con 0 command 
to move into the configuration of the console port. Once you are in the line 
prompt, you can then specify the password you want for this port.
 
Make a mental note that you have to specify the login command after the 
password is set — if you do not, the router will not prompt for a password 
when someone makes a connection to the port. The login command is how 
you turn on authentication for that port and have the Cisco device ask for a 
password.
 
During your CCENT certification exam, you will be presented with many 
configuration scenarios where you see the running-configuration of a device. 
You will be asked to identify mistakes in the configuration — watch for 
things like the password on the port being set but the login command is 
missing!

480
Cisco Router Best Practices
Auxiliary port password
Configuring the auxiliary port for a password is similar to configuring the 
console port for a password. In order to configure the auxiliary port for a 
password, use the following commands:
RouterA>enable
RouterA#config term
RouterA(config)#line aux 0
RouterA(config-line)#password auxpass
RouterA(config-line)#login
You can see the only difference between setting a password on the console 
port and the auxiliary port is the line aux 0 command. Notice that the 
login command is supplied and enables authentication on that port.
 
You can disable authentication on any of the ports (and any type of port) at 
any time using the no login command.
Telnet password
You set the console port and auxiliary port passwords on the router to help 
control who can physically connect to those ports and manage the device. 
Administrators can also Telnet into the router in order to administer the 
device from a remote location. You need to configure your router for Telnet 
passwords if someone is going to Telnet into the router using the Telnet 
ports, also known as the virtual teletype (VTY) ports. The following commands 
configure passwords on the Telnet ports:
RouterA>enable
RouterA#config term
RouterA(config)#line vty 0 1180
RouterA(config-line)#password vtypass
RouterA(config-line)#login
 
Cisco devices require you to configure a Telnet password and a password 
when entering privilege exec mode on the router in order to remotely connect 
to the router. Cisco devices do not allow you to do remote administration 
without these passwords set. 
Encrypting passwords
Once you have configured the passwords on your router for all the different 
ports you will notice that the only password that is encrypted is the secret 
value. This is a problem, as you want to protect all passwords from someone 
being able to see them when viewing the configuration. This section walks 
you through how to encrypt all passwords in the configuration of your Cisco 
switch or router.

Book IV
Chapter 2

Now that we have our passwords set on the router, let us take a look at the 
running-configuration to verify that the passwords are set.
RouterA#show running-config
Building configuration...
!
(output omitted for briefness)
!
enable secret 5 $1$u76B$IOFVJ7VxfVXYVpGDrFTcI0

  password auxpass
  login
line vty 0 4
  password vtypass
  login
line vty 5 1180
  password vtypass
  login
!
(output omitted for briefness)
When viewing the running configuration file (or the startup configuration 
file, for that matter), you see the passwords that have been configured on 
the router.
From a security point of view, it is important that all passwords are 
encrypted in the configuration files. In order to encrypt all passwords, you 
use the service password-encryption command, as shown here.
RouterA#config term
RouterA(config)#service password-encryption
Let’s take a look at the running configuration after the passwords have been 
encrypted.
RouterA#show running-config
Building configuration...

  login
!
(output omitted for briefness)
When looking at the preceding output, you see that all of the passwords 
have been encrypted.
 
The CCENT certification exam expects you to know how to encrypt all the 
passwords in the configuration files with the service password-encryption 
command. Also, know for the exam that you can turn this service off with 
the no service password-encryption command — which does not 
decrypt the passwords in the configuration until you set them again. In the 
real world you want to ensure that passwords are being encrypted so I don’t 
recommend turning this off.
Configuring user accounts
If you want to require more than just a password in order to log in to the 
router, you can create individual usernames and passwords for each 
administrator who will connect to the router. In order to create the usernames 
and passwords, use the following commands:
RouterA>enable
RouterA#config term
RouterA(config)#username dan password danpass
RouterA(config)#username glen password glenpass
Once the usernames and passwords are created, you can then force those 
local usernames (meaning the accounts in the current device) to be used 
when logging in to the different ports, by using the login local command. 
The following command shows how to enable login access on the console 
port using the local user accounts that have been configured:
RouterA(config)#line con 0
RouterA(config-line)#login local

Book IV
Chapter 2
Cisco Device 
Security Best 
Practices
483
Cisco Router Best Practices
Once you configure the console port for the login local command, you 
are required to have a username and password in order to gain access to the 
router!
 
For the CCENT certification exam, know the purpose of the login local 
command and the fact that you can use it on the console, auxiliary, and 
Telnet ports. Also, when given example code on the exam, watch out for 
instances where the login local command is missing. It is not enough to 
create the usernames and passwords — you must also configure the different 
ports to use the local accounts for authentication, by using the login 
local command.
 
To see a demonstration on configuring passwords with Cisco devices, check 
out the Configuring Passwords video on the accompanying CD.
Configuring banners
As discussed in Book II, Chapter 2, there are a number of different types 
of banners that can be used on your Cisco device. To review, banners are 
used to display a message to anyone accessing the Cisco device, and it is a 
security best practice to give a message indicating that the device is to be 
accessed by authorized individuals only.
For many years, network administrators have created cute banner messages 
that include the word welcome. For legal reasons, you do not want to display 
warm, inviting banner messages. If you do, hackers may use this defense 
in court: “Honest, your honor. I thought they wanted me to hack the system 
because the message said ‘Welcome to my router’!”
 
For the CCENT certification exam, remember that any type of banner 
message with the word welcome in it is a poor configuration choice and a 
violation of security. Banners should be short, simple messages indicating 
that unauthorized access to the system is prohibited.
Types of banners
In Book II, Chapter 2 you learned how to configure banners on the Cisco 
router or switch, let’s review banners and then make some important points 
to remember for the exam!
It is important to know that there are different types of banners that you can 
configure. Each banner type is designed for a specific purpose and appears 
at a different time during the logon process:

484
Cisco Router Best Practices
 
✦ Message of the day: The message of the day banner, known as the 
MOTD, displays before the administrator is asked to log in. The initial 
purpose of the MOTD banner was to show a temporary notice to the 
person connecting, and it could change from time to time. Today, network 
administrators are using the MOTD banner to display disclaimers that 
unauthorized access to the system is strictly prohibited!
 
✦ Login: The login banner displays before the administrator is asked to 
log on but after the MOTD banner (if one is set). The login banner is 
designed to display a more permanent message, something that will not 
change from day to day, to the person connecting.
 
✦ Exec: The exec banner, or what I like to refer to as the user exec banner 
(not an official term by the way), displays after an administrator logs 
on and enters user exec mode. This type of banner is used to display 
a message you only want someone who has been authenticated to the 
system to view. Because the MOTD and login banner appear before a 
login they are viewable by anyone who connects to the system; the exec 
banner appears after someone logs on so you know whoever sees the 
message is an authorized person.
Configuring a banner
Now that you are comfortable with the different types of banners, let’s take a 
look at how to configure the banners on a Cisco router.
 
You configure banners on a switch the exact same way you do for a router.
The following code is used to configure a MOTD banner on your Cisco 
device.
RouterA(config)#banner motd #
Enter TEXT message.  End with the character ‘#’.
This device is for authorized personnel only.  
Please disconnect at once if you have not been given 
permission to access this device
#
RouterA(config)#
Notice that you set the MOTD banner from global configuration mode with 
the banner motd # command. The # symbol serves as the delimiter and 
indicates what character ends the message when you are typing the message 
out. Notice that I have two lines of text set as the message of the day and a 
third line with the # indicating I am done setting the message of the day. You 
can use whichever character you like as the delimiter as long as you specify 
it in the banner command.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Cisco Device 
Security Best 
Practices
485
Cisco Router Best Practices
The following code is used to specify the login banner. Notice that it is very 
similar to setting the MOTD banner but the keyword login is used instead 
of motd in the banner command.
RouterA(config)#banner login #
Enter TEXT message.  End with the character ‘#’.
*** Login Required.  Unauthorized use is prohibited ***
#
RouterA(config)#
You are not required to set the MOTD banner and the login banner (most 
companies set one or the other), but if you find that you do have the need 
to show a unique message on different days then you may set your normal 
“unauthorized access is prohibited” message as the login banner so that you 
can have a MOTD banner as well if and when you need it.
Notice in the output below that when someone connects to the router or 
switch the MOTD is displayed before the login banner:
RouterA Con0 is now available
Press RETURN to get started!
This device is for authorized personnel only.  Please 
disconnect at once if you have not been given permission 
to access this device
*** Login Required.  Unauthorized use is prohibited ***
User Access Verification
Password:
If you wish to set a user exec password you can use the banner exec 
command. Remember, this exec banner message shows after login as the 
individual enters user exec mode:
RouterA(config)#banner exec #
Enter TEXT message.  End with the character ‘#’.
*** Be sure to update the change log after any changes ***
#
RouterA(config)#
 
On the CCENT certification exam you are presented with many configurations 
where you need to identify problems with the configuration. One of the 
points to watch for is a configuration that involves the banner containing a 
message welcoming the person connecting. As a security best practice you 
should never have a message welcoming a connection as it could be used 
as an excuse by the hacker that they received authorization to access the 
system when the word welcome appeared.

486
Cisco Router Best Practices
Configuring SSH
In Book II, Chapter 3, you discover how to Telnet into the router or switch 
and remotely manage the device. Telnet runs on TCP port 23 and sends the 
data and authentication credentials (username and password) in clear text. 
This presents a huge security risk, as anyone who taps into the communication 
can see the username and password needed to log in to the device.
Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol that is used to encrypt communication 
between two systems and is a popular replacement for Telnet as Telnet does 
not encrypt the traffic. You should configure your Cisco devices for SSH and 
use it instead of Telnet because it encrypts the communication between the 
client and the Cisco device, including the logon credentials.
 
Note for the exam that SSH uses TCP port 22. 
The first thing you must do to configure SSH on your Cisco router is set your 
hostname and domain name. These settings are used when the encryption 
key is created in a future step.
 
If the hostname and domain name are already set on the device, you are not 
required to perform the following commands. You can verify these settings 
by show running-config.
Use these commands to set the hostname and domain name:
Router>enable
Router#config term
Router(config)#hostname ROUTERA
RouterA(config)#ip domain-name gleneclarke.com
After ensuring the hostname and domain name are set, you create a username 
and password for an account that will be used to log in remotely to the 
system via SSH.
RouterA(config)#username glen password glenpass
After configuring a username and password, you need to generate the 
encryption key that SSH uses to encrypt the traffic:
RouterA(config)#crypto key generate rsa
The name for the keys will be: R1.gleneclarke.com
Choose the size of the key modulus in the range of 360 to 
2048 for your General Purpose Keys. Choosing a key modulus 
greater than 512 may take a few minutes.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Cisco Device 
Security Best 
Practices
487
Cisco Switch Best Practices
How many bits in the modulus [512]: 1024
% Generating 1024 bit RSA keys, keys will be non-
exportable...[OK]
After generating the encryption key, you configure the Telnet ports to use 
the local user accounts for authentication (via the login local command) 
and then specify that the Telnet ports accept only SSH as a protocol for 
remote administration, by using the transport input ssh command.
RouterA(config)#line vty 0 4
RouterA(config-line)#login local
RouterA(config-line)#transport input ssh
The transport input command accepts the value of ssh, telnet, or 
none, or you can use the all keyword to support both Telnet and SSH for 
remote administration.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, remember that in order to encrypt traffic 
to your router, you should use SSH instead of Telnet for remote administration. 
Also remember that Telnet uses TCP port 23, while SSH uses TCP port 22.
Cisco Switch Best Practices
The security concepts discussed in the router sections (such as setting 
banners, passwords, and using SSH to encrypt traffic between the Cisco 
device and the system to perform remote administration) of this chapter can 
be applied to switches as well, so I do not repeat that discussion here. In this 
section, you find out about the best practices that apply specifically to network 
switches and their ports. I discuss a number of these concepts in Book III, 
Chapter 2, so this is a quick section.
Configuring port security
The first point to review about switch security is the fact that you can 
configure port security on your switches. Port security allows you to 
configure each port on the switch to allow a connection from a specific MAC 
address and no other system. Port security is a big part of physical security, 
as it limits who can physically connect to the network.
In the following code, you see that I am configuring port security for interface 
f0/5. After navigating to that interface, I then ensure the port is running in 
access mode, which allows a workstation to connect to the port.
SW1>enable
SW1#config term
SW1(config)#interface f0/5
SW1(config-if)#switchport mode access

488
Cisco Switch Best Practices
After I place the port in access mode, I then enable the port security feature 
with the switchport port-security command. After enabling port 
security, I configure the port for a specific MAC address switchport 
port-security mac-address MAC_Of_System. If you do not want to 
manually input the MAC address, you can use the sticky option, which 
tells the switch to learn the MAC address of the system connected and then 
configure port security to use that MAC address. The following commands 
enable port security and use the sticky option:
SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security
SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security mac-address sticky
After you enable port security and configure the MAC address for the port, 
you then need to limit the port so it allows for only one MAC address in the 
MAC address table for that port. After that, you specify what happens when 
a different system connects to that port (a violation), such as having the 
port disabled if there is a violation. The following commands are the last two 
commands to configure port security:
SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security maximum 1
SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security violation shutdown
The following lists all the commands you use to configure port security on 
port 5 of the switch:
SW1>enable
SW1#config term
SW1(config)#interface f0/5
SW1(config-if)#switchport mode access
SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security
SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security mac-address sticky
SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security maximum 1
SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security violation shutdown
 
For the CCENT certification exam, know how to configure port security and 
especially be familiar with the sticky option. The sticky option is how 
you configure the switch to use the MAC address of the system connected to 
the port, and it saves you the trouble of finding out the MAC of the station.
Disabling ports
Once you configure port security for all the ports used on your network 
switch, the next step to help secure the switch is to ensure that you have 
disabled all unused ports. Disabling any ports that are not being used 
ensures that someone cannot connect to the port and gain network access 
without your knowledge.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Cisco Device 
Security Best 
Practices
489
Chapter Summary
The following commands disable port number 8 on a switch, with the 
shutdown command:
SW1>enable
SW1#config term
SW1(config)#interface f0/8
SW1(config-if)#shutdown
11:23:18 %LINK-3-UPDOWN:  Interface FastEthernet0/8, changed 
state to administratively down
11:23:18 %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface 
FastEthernet0/8, changed state to down
If you have a number of ports that you wish to disable at one time, you can 
select a group of ports with the interface range command. The following 
command selects ports 6–12 and disables the ports.
SW1(config)#interface range f0/6 - 12
SW1(config-if)#shutdown
 
For the CCENT certification exam, know that all unused ports should be 
disabled on the network switch. In order to disable ports, you use the shut-
down command. If you wish to enable the port, you use the no shutdown 
command.
Chapter Summary
This chapter illustrates the importance of good security practices when 
configuring your Cisco device. These concepts are important from an exam 
point of view, but also for the real world:
 
✦ Ensure you are using complex passwords.
 
✦ The enable secret command creates an encrypted password in the 
configuration file that is used to enter priv exec mode. The enable 
secret command takes precedence over the enable password 
command.
 
✦ You can configure a console password on your router so that anyone 
connecting to the console port must supply a password.
 
✦ You should also set auxiliary and Telnet passwords so that anyone 
connecting through those methods must also supply a password.
 
✦ Remember, after setting the password for the console, auxiliary, and 
Telnet ports, use the login command so that the Cisco device prompts 
for login to the port.

490
Lab Exercises
 
✦ If you create usernames and passwords, you must use the login 
local command on the ports to indicate you wish to use the local 
accounts for authentication.
 
✦ Ensure that the banner messages do not contain any form of welcome 
message and that they notify the individual connecting to the system 
that authorized persons only are to connect to the system.
 
✦ SSH should be used instead of Telnet because the traffic is encrypted 
when SSH is used.
 
✦ Configure port security on a port so that only the system with a particular 
MAC address can connect to the port.
 
✦ Disable any unused ports on the switch so that nonauthorized systems 
cannot connect to the switch.
Lab Exercises
This chapter introduces a number of settings on the Cisco routers and 
switches that aid in the security of the devices. The following exercises are 
designed to help you practice implementing those best practices.
Lab 2-1: Configuring passwords
 
1. Connect to your router and configure the following passwords:
 
• Console password: con
 
• Auxiliary password: aux
 
• Telnet password: telnet
 
• Enable password: enable
 
• Secret password: secret
 
 The following commands should have been used to configure the 
passwords on your router:
RouterA>enable
RouterA#config term
RouterA(config)#enable password enable
RouterA(config)#enable secret secret
RouterA(config)#line con 0
RouterA(config-line)#password con
RouterA(config-line)#login

2. Once you configure the passwords, go back to priv exec mode and 
show your running-config.
 
 Do you see the passwords in the configuration?
 
3. The passwords have been stored in clear text, so in order to encrypt the 
passwords, go to global configuration and type the following command:
RouterA(config)#service password-encryption
 
4. Verify the passwords are encrypted by displaying your running 
configuration.
 
 Are the passwords encrypted? 
Lab 2-2: Configuring banners
Configure a banner on your router so that anyone connecting to your router 
sees a notice indicating the system is to be accessed by authorized persons 
only.
 
1. Fill in the table below identifying the purpose of the three different 
banner types listed:
Banner Type
Purpose
Login
MOTD

Looking at Wireless Terminology
In this section, I start the discussion by overviewing the concept of wireless 
networking and the agencies that govern it. I also discuss some of the hardware 
that typically exists in a wireless network, including wireless access points 
and clients. I finish the discussion with an introduction to the two types of 
wireless network topology.
 
The CCENT certification exam expects you to know only the basics of 
wireless networking, so if you are comfortable with this chapter and the 
concepts discussed here, you should have no problem with the wireless 
portion of the exam!
Wireless concepts
There are a number of different wireless technologies out there, but when it 
comes to wireless LANS (WLANs), understand that any WLAN uses radio 
frequencies that travel through the air as radio waves. This means that you do 
not need a direct line of sight to the system you are communicating with, as the 
radio waves travel through walls (unlike infrared, which is line of sight).
Wireless agencies
Wireless communication and its related technologies are governed by a 
number of different agencies. The following is a listing of some of the 
popular wireless agencies to know for the CCENT certification exam:
 
✦ IEEE: The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) is 
responsible for creating the different wireless networking standards 
such as 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n. (See the “Introduction to Wireless 
Standards” section, later in this chapter, for more on these standards.) 
You can find out more about the IEEE at www.ieee.org.
 
✦ Wi-Fi Alliance: The Wi-Fi Alliance is responsible for ensuring compatibility 
and interoperability of wireless networking components. The organization 
also tests and certifies components for Wi-Fi compatibility. You can 
discover more about the Wi-Fi Alliance at www.wi-fi.com.
 
✦ Federal Communications Commission: The Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) is a very important agency that regulates the use of 
wireless devices and frequencies. The FCC has defined three frequency 
ranges that are free for public use: the 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5 GHz 
frequency ranges. It is important to understand that if you are looking 
to implement a wireless solution outside of those frequency ranges, you 
must acquire a license to do so from the FCC.

Looking at Wireless Terminology
 
✦ International Telecommunications Union: The International 
Telecommunications Union (ITU) is a United Nations agency that is 
responsible for developing international standards and regulations 
surrounding the telecommunications field. The ITU works alongside the 
FCC to help develop international wireless standards.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, be sure to know that the Wi-Fi Alliance is 
responsible for testing and certification of Wi-Fi-compatible components, and the 
FCC is responsible for regulating the use of wireless devices and frequencies. 
Wireless LAN frequencies
As mentioned in the previous section, the FCC has licensed three frequencies 
for public use: the 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5 GHz ranges. It is important to 
note that these are frequency ranges, and wireless components are designed 
to use a frequency range.
For example, the most popular frequency range for wireless networks is 2.4 
GHz. This frequency range is divided into a number of different channels, 
with each channel running on a different 22 MHz frequency within the 2.4 
GHz frequency range.
Table 3-1 outlines the different channels provided in the 2.4 GHz frequency 
range and the frequency range of each channel. The important thing to note is 
that cordless phones run at the 2.4 GHz range as well, so you may experience issues 
with your wireless network due to a cordless phone causing interference. What can 
you do about it? The answer is simple; you can change your wireless network 
to run on a different channel, which places the network in a different frequency 
and hopefully solves the interference problem with the cordless phone.
Table 3-1 
The 2.4 GHz Frequency Ranges
Channel
Frequency Range
1
2.3995 GHz–2.4245 GHz
2
2.4045 GHz–2.4295 GHz
3
2.4095 GHz–2.4345 GHz
4
2.4145 GHz–2.4395 GHz
5
2.4195 GHz–2.4445 GHz
6
2.4245 GHz–2.4495 GHz
7
2.4295 GHz–2.4545 GHz
8
2.4345 GHz–2.4595 GHz
(continued)

Looking at Wireless Terminology
Table 3-1 (continued)

2.4395 GHz–2.4645 GHz
10
2.4445 GHz–2.4695 GHz

2.4495 GHz–2.4745 GHz
12
2.4545 GHz–2.4795 GHz
13
2.4595 GHz–2.4845 GHz
When looking at Table 3-1, notice there is overlapping between the frequencies 
in most of the channels. For example, the first channel starts at frequency 
2.3995 and goes to 2.4245. This is within the same frequency range of 
channel 2, which starts at 2.4045. Figure 3-1 visually displays the overlapping 
of frequencies and their associated channels.
 
Figure 3-1: 
Overlapping 
frequencies 
in the 
2.4 GHz 
frequency 
range.
 
The reason I stress the overlapping of the frequencies is that when you 
modify the channel on your wireless network to try to eliminate the interference 
with the cordless phone, it is recommended to jump a few channels ahead 
or behind your current channel so you are in a totally different range. Also 
notice in Figure 3-1 the frequencies that do not overlap one another (they 
are the bolded lines) — these frequencies map out to channels 1, 6, and 11. If 
you need to configure multiple access points to run on different channels, these 
channels make great choices, as there should be no interference between 
them because they do not overlap one another.

Looking at Wireless Terminology
Wireless equipment
When creating a wireless network, you will need in your possession some 
popular wireless equipment such as a wireless access point (depending on 
the type of wireless network you create — more on the types of wireless 
networks in a bit), and a wireless client, which is a system with a wireless 
network card used to connect to the wireless network.
Wireless access point
The first wireless equipment to mention is a very popular device known as 
a wireless access point, which has antennas to send and receive the wireless 
traffic but also normally has a network port to connect the access point to 
the wired network. A wireless access point allows wireless clients to connect 
to a wireless network and access resources on the wired network and vice 
versa. (See Figure 3-2.)
The wireless access point is configured with a service set identifier (SSID), 
which acts as a name for the wireless network. In order for wireless clients 
to connect to the wireless access point, they must specify the name of the 
wireless network, or SSID. This is not much of a security feature, as the SSID 
is broadcasted onto the network by default.
 
Figure 3-2:

Wireless clients
The other type of wireless equipment to discuss is wireless clients, which are 
systems that have a wireless network card installed; wireless network cards 
are configured to connect to the access point or even to other wireless clients 
directly. When a wireless client accesses a device such as a printer or server 
on the wired network, the information is sent to the wireless access point 
from the wireless client, and then onto the wired network.

506
Introduction to Wireless Standards
Types of wireless networks
When you design your wireless network you can choose from one of two 
different network topologies, known as modes: ad hoc and infrastructure.
 
✦ Ad hoc: With the ad hoc wireless network topology, you do not have a 
wireless access point on the network — the wireless devices connect 
directly to one another in a peer-to-peer type of configuration.
 
✦ Infrastructure: With infrastructure mode, the wireless clients and devices 
connect to a wireless access point by the SSID and access the wireless 
network through the access point.
Introduction to Wireless Standards
Wireless networking standards have been around for quite some time now, 
and like anything else that is technology driven, it is something that has 
been improving over the years. The Institute of Electrical and Electronic 
Engineers (IEEE) is responsible for defining networking standards, including 
the standards that govern wireless networking.
Wireless networking falls under the IEEE 802.11 project model. A number of 
different wireless standards have been developed over the years, and I 
discuss the most recent wireless standards in the following sections.
 
Table 3-2 also summarizes the different wireless standards.

802.11a
The first major wireless networking standard is known as the 802.11a 
network standard. It runs at 54 Mbps but uses the 5 GHz frequency range, 
as opposed the popular 2.4 GHz range. Wireless 802.11a devices are 
incompatible with 802.11b and 802.11g devices but are compatible with 
802.11n devices.

Book IV
Chapter 3
Wireless 
Networking
507
Wireless Configuration and Troubleshooting
802.11b
The next wireless standard is the 802.11b wireless standard, which runs 
at 11 Mbps and uses the 2.4GHz frequency. Because 802.11b uses a different 
frequency range than 802.11a, they are incompatible with one another. 
For example, you cannot connect a client using an 802.11a network card to 
an 802.11b access point. 802.11b devices are compatible with 802.11g and 
802.11n devices.
The 802.11b standard has become the Wi-Fi standard, and as future standards 
and technologies are developed, they will be part of the Wi-Fi standard.
802.11g
The 802.11g standard follows the Wi-Fi standard and is therefore compatible 
with the 802.11b wireless standard. 802.11g runs at 54 Mbps and uses the 2.4 
GHz frequency that is used by 802.11b (which is one of the reasons why 
they are compatible). 802.11g is also compatible with 802.11n, but it is not 
compatible with 802.11a.
802.11n
At the time of this writing, 802.11n is the most current wireless standard, 
and it is compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g because it can run at 
either the 2.4 GHz frequency or the 5 GHz frequency. 802.11n has a number 
of new features that help increase the transfer rate, including a feature 
called channel bonding, which allows the device to send data over multiple 
channels. The 802.11n standard has a transfer rate of 150 Mbps!
 
For the CCENT certification exam, know the differences in the 802.11a/b/g/n 
wireless network standards. Be familiar with the fact that 802.11b/g/n are 
compatible with one another.
Wireless Configuration and Troubleshooting
Now that you have an understanding of the different wireless network 
standards created by the IEEE, lets take a look at the basic configuration and 
troubleshooting of a wireless network. As I discuss in the text that follows, 
you can configure a wireless network with one access point, or multiple 
access points if you need to cover a larger area. And when you’re trouble-
shooting wireless network problems, you can use the steps I provide to 
figure out what is wrong.

508
Wireless Configuration and Troubleshooting
Basic configuration overview
Basic Service Set, or BSS, is the term we use in the wireless world for a 
wireless network that uses a single wireless access point with an SSID 
configured. (See Figure 3-3.) If you have two access points, with each access 
point configured to a unique SSID, this creates two different Basic Service 
Sets. Also note that an access point connected to a wired network with a 
unique SSID is known as an Infrastructure Basic Service Set (IBSS).
 
Figure 3-3: 
A BSS is 
a wireless 
network 
with a single 
access 
point 
configured 
with an 
SSID.

For the CCENT certification exam, know that a single access point creates a 
Basic Service Set (BSS). If this access point is connected to a wired network, 
it creates an Infrastructure Basic Service Set (IBSS)
Designing a multi-access point WLAN
If you need a wireless network to cover a large area, you may need to create 
a wireless network with multiple wireless access points that use the same 
SSID. A wireless network with multiple access points using the same SSID is 
known as an Extended Service Set (ESS). Figure 3-4 displays an ESS wireless 
network.
When you configure multiple access points using the same SSID positioned 
throughout the facility, it allows clients to roam from one end of the facility 
to the other and not lose network connectivity. Before the roaming clients 
get too far from one access point, they move into the range of the next 
access point and are switched over to that access point without losing a net-
work connection.

In order to configure an ESS wireless network that supports roaming users, 
the following conditions must be met:
 
✦ You must configure multiple access points with the same SSID.
 
✦ The access points must overlap coverage areas by 10 percent or more 
so the wireless client does not lose a network connection.
 
✦ Each wireless access point must be configured for a different channel.
Notice in Figure 3-4 that each access point is connected to the wired network 
and has an SSID of glensworld configured. You also see that each access 
point is configured for different channels and that I have selected channels 
that I know do not overlap frequencies with one another.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, be sure to know the requirements to 
configure an ESS to support roaming users. You must have the same SSID set 
on all access points, with each access point using a different channel. The 
area covered by the access point must overlap by 10 percent or more.

Wireless Security Practices
Troubleshooting wireless networks
When you are having trouble connecting a wireless client to a wireless 
network, a number of things could be the cause of the problem. The following 
outlines some of the settings to verify when troubleshooting a client that 
cannot connect to a wireless network:
 
1. Ensure that you have configured the client to connect to the correct 
SSID name.
 
2. If you are sure you have the correct SSID name, ensure that you have 
enabled the same encryption protocol that is configured on the access 
point, and ensure that you have specified the correct encryption key.
 
 You can find more on this in the next section.
 
3. If you have verified all the settings and you have not connected to 
this network in the past, it is possible that you are not authorized 
to connect. Most wireless networks will limit who can connect by 
MAC address — you will need to add your MAC address to the access 
point’s MAC address filter list.
If you are experiencing intermittent problems where you lose your connection 
with the wireless network, it could be due to interference with a device 
that uses the same frequency, such as a cordless phone. You can change 
the channel on your wireless network to use a different frequency than the 
phone. If you are purchasing new cordless phones, ensure you buy phones 
that use a different frequency than the 2.4 frequency range.
Wireless Security Practices
In this section, you find out about general practices you can take to secure 
your wireless network. You will also read about the different encryption 
protocols that you can use to encrypt wireless traffic.
General security practices
Wireless networks have a default characteristic of being unsecure by nature — 
this is known as open security. The concept of a wireless network is to allow 
someone who is not connected physically to the network to access network 
resources. This is great from a convenience point of view, but the security 
folks in the company do not like it! With a wireless network, you essentially 
lose the physical security aspect of requiring someone to be in the office 
to gain network access. The following are some steps you can take to help 
create a more secure wireless network.

Wireless Security Practices
Change the SSID
Most wireless access points have a default SSID, which makes it very easy 
for someone who wants to connect to your wireless network to do so. In 
order to make it harder for someone to connect to your wireless network, 
alter the SSID from the default value to something unique and not easily 
guessed. Remember, in order for someone to connect, she needs to know 
the SSID.
Disable SSID broadcasting
The problem with changing the SSID is that the access point is, by default, 
configured to broadcast that SSID name out on the network. This means that 
clients can browse the network to find the SSID even after you have changed 
it. In order to lock down the SSID a bit more, you can configure the access 
point to not broadcast the SSID. This means that clients will not see your 
wireless network when they browse for wireless networks.
 
Relying on changing the SSID and disabling SSID is a false sense of security. 
Keep in mind that wireless traffic is in the air for your wireless network, and 
there are tools such as Kismet that can still identify the wireless network 
even though you have disabled SSID broadcasting. (This just keeps the 
honest folks out.) You must use other forms of security in addition to dis-
abling SSID broadcasting.
Restrict by MAC
Another step you can take to add a layer of security to your wireless network 
is to configure the wireless access point with a list of MAC addresses that are 
allowed to connect to the wireless network. Once you have configured MAC 
filtering on the wireless access point, any system that does not have a listed 
MAC address is denied access to the network when it attempts to connect.
 
MAC filtering by itself is not a very secure feature, as a hacker can use a 
program such as Kismet to view a list of clients and their MAC addresses 
that are connected to your network. Once the hacker sees the MAC 
addresses of valid clients on the network, he can then spoof the address so 
it looks like traffic from that system is one of those clients.
Enable encryption
A very popular technique for securing the wireless network is to implement 
encryption (converting readable text to unreadable text) on the wireless 
network. When you configure the access point for an encryption protocol, 
you specify a pre-shared key, or passphrase, that is required by anyone who 

512
Wireless Security Practices
wishes to connect to the wireless network. Any clients who connect with 
that key can access the wireless network, and all the traffic from the wireless 
client to the access point is encrypted traffic.
It is important to stress the two security benefits of using encryption. The 
first benefit is that only those who know the passphrase, or encryption key, 
connect. The other benefit is that those clients that have been configured 
with the same encryption key are sending and receiving encrypted traffic 
with the access point.
Encryption protocols
Most secured wireless networks use some form of encryption protocol to 
encrypt the traffic between the wireless client and the wireless access point. 
In this section, I introduce you to some of the popular wireless security 
protocols.
WEP
The first wireless security protocol to discuss is the Wired Equivalent Privacy 
(WEP) protocol, which is very popular with 802.11b devices. WEP uses a 
pre-shared key (meaning you must tell the client the key in order to connect) 
assigned on the access point and the client to encrypt and decrypt the 
traffic. The preshared key is required at the client in order for the client to 
connect to the network.
WEP supports 64-bit or 128-bit encryption and uses the RC4 symmetric 
encryption protocol.
WPA
The WEP encryption protocol has some flaws in how it performs the 
encryption, so the Wi-Fi Alliance created the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) 
protocol. WPA uses the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), which is a 
protocol that changes the encryption key (known as key rotation) with every 
packet sent to try to make it harder for hackers to crack the key.
There are two different modes for WPA, with each mode providing a different 
level of security:
 
✦ Personal: With personal mode, also known as WPA-PSK (the PSK portion 
stands for pre-shared key), WPA uses a shared key as a starting value 
and then changes it with each packet. Personal mode is popular with 
home networking and small-office environments.

Chapter 3

Networking
513
Chapter Summary
 
✦ Enterprise: With enterprise mode, WPA uses a central server to 
authenticate anyone connecting to the wireless network. The central 
server that the wireless access point uses for authentication is known 
as a Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server, which is 
also a popular server for Remote Access Service (RAS) authentication. 
RADIUS is a service that provides authentication services to many 
different technologies such as wireless and dial-in services (RAS services). 
Running your wireless network in enterprise mode and using an 
authentication server for network access is known as the 802.1x standard.
WPA2
The Wi-Fi Alliance updated the WPA protocol to WPA2 and added some 
improvements to the protocol, such as the fact that WPA2 uses the 
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) protocol, which has yet to be cracked. 
AES supports 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit encryption! Like WPA, WPA2 also 
supports both personal and enterprise modes.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, know that WEP uses RC4 as the encryption 
algorithm, WPA uses TKIP and has a key-rotation feature, and WPA2 uses 
AES as the encryption algorithm.
Chapter Summary
This chapter is designed to give you the background in wireless networking 
needed to pass the CCENT certification exam. The following are some key 
points to remember when preparing for the exam:
 
✦ The IEEE defines the wireless standards such as 802.11a/b/g/n.
 
✦ The FCC regulates the use of wireless components and frequencies.
 
✦ The Wi-Fi Alliance is responsible for testing and certifying wireless 
components for Wi-Fi compatibility.
 
✦ Wireless networks can run in ad hoc or infrastructure mode. Ad hoc 
networks do not use a wireless access point, while infrastructure mode does.
 
✦ The SSID is the name assigned to a wireless network.
 
✦ The term used for a wireless network that has a single access point 
using a single SSID is BSS, while a wireless network with multiple access 
points using the same SSID is called an ESS.
 
✦ In order to allow users to roam between access points on an ESS net-
work, you must assign the same SSID to each access point, but use dif-
ferent channels. You must overlap coverage 10 percent or more.

✦ Be sure to review the different wireless standards such as 802.11b/g/n.
 
✦ Know the difference in WEP, WPA, and WPA2 for the exam.

Answers
 1 B, C, E. In order to have users roam a wireless network and jump from one 
access point to another in the ESS, you configure multiple access points with 
the same SSID, each having a different frequency range (or channel), and they 
must overlap by 10 percent or more. See “Designing a multi-access point 
WLAN.”
 2 C. 802.11g runs at 54 Mbps and is compatible with 802.11b devices because it 
runs at the same frequency range of 2.4 GHz. Review “802.11g.”
 3 D. The FCC is responsible for regulating the use of wireless and wireless 
frequencies. It is the governing body that legalized public use of the 900 MHz, 
2.4 GHz, and 5 GHz frequencies. Check out “Wireless agencies.”
 4 C. WPA uses the TKIP protocol as part of the encryption process. TKIP is 
responsible for changing the preshared key with each packet sent. Peruse 
“WPA.”
 5 A. The Basic Service Set (BSS) is the type of wireless network that has a single 
access point with an SSID assigned. Take a look at “Basic configuration 
overview.”
 6 B. WPA enterprise mode is the mode that uses a central authentication server 
such as a RADIUS server. Peek at “WPA.”
 7 A. The 802.11a wireless standard runs at 54 Mbps in the 5 GHz frequency range. 
Look over “802.11a.”
 8 B. WPA2 is the more secure encryption protocol of the three major protocols 
(WEP, WPA, and WPA2) and uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). 
Study “WPA2.”
 9 A. The Wi-Fi Alliance is responsible for testing and certifying wireless components 
for Wi-Fi compatibility. Refer to “Wireless agencies.”
 10 B. The Extended Service Set (ESS) is the term used for a wireless network that 
supports roaming users by having multiple access points use the same SSID. 
Remember that you must configure each access point to use a different channel, 
and they must have overlapping coverage of 10 percent or more. Examine 
“Designing a multi-access point WLAN.”

Introduction to WAN Terminology
522
Introduction to WAN Terminology
The term wide area network (WAN) is used to define a network that is made 
up of two or more LANs that are geographically separated. The LANs that 
are connected together in a WAN environment typically have great distances 
between them, making it impossible for you to use normal network media 
to connect them. This means that you end up needing to use a service 
provider’s network as the physical connection between the LANs in different 
offices, as shown in Figure 4-1.
 
Figure 4-1:

Looking at Figure 4-1, you see that the office in New York uses the service 
provider’s network, such as your telco, to connect to the network environment 
in Toronto. When the traffic travels from New York to Toronto, the traffic 
leaves the WAN port on the router (in this case, it is the serial port) and 
enters into the service provider’s network. The provider’s network is made 
up of a number of different routers and switches. Your data travels through 
the service provider’s network and reaches your router in Toronto via its 
WAN port. (Again, in this example, it is the serial port on the Toronto router.)
The service provider offers a number of different choices for this subscription 
service. You can purchase a not-so-permanent solution where you have 
to establish a network connection each time data is sent from one LAN to 
another, and you pay for only the time you use the connection (circuit 
switching). Alternatively, you can purchase a dedicated connection that is 
always there whether you use it or not (leased line). Or you can subscribe to 
a packet-switching solution, which sends packets along different pathways to 
reach the destination. The following sections identify the different types of WAN 
technologies, including circuit switching, leased lines, and packet switching.

Introduction to WAN Terminology
Circuit switching
The concept of circuit switching is that when you need to send and receive 
data between two points, you first establish a connection between the two 
points, and then send and receive the information. The information travels 
the same pathway the entire time, and you are guaranteed to have the 
bandwidth along that pathway to your network — you do not share this 
bandwidth with any other customers of the circuit switching network.
Circuit-based networks are designed for scenarios where you have low 
bandwidth requirements as you pay for the bandwidth allocated and the 
time you are connected to the WAN.
 
It is important to stress that with circuit switching, you do not pay for the 
service when you are not connected.
Examples of technologies based on circuit switch networks are the telephone 
system and Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), which is a system of 
digital telephone connections that carry voice and data. ISDN carries data 
over channels known as B-channels, which are 64 Kbps, and the signaling 
information is carried over what is known as a D-channel (16 Kbps or 64 
Kbps, depending on the implementation). There are two major types of 
subscriptions to ISDN:
 
✦ Basic Rate Interface (BRI): With BRI, you have two, 64-Kbps B-channels 
and one signaling channel (D-channel) of 16 Kbps. This gives you a 128 
Kbps data connection.
 
✦ Primary Rate Interface (PRI): A PRI subscription uses twenty-three, 64 
Kbps data channels (B-channels) and one 64-Kbps D-channel for signaling 
information.
 
Remember for the CCENT exam that the phone system and an ISDN network 
are examples of circuit switching technologies.
Leased lines
Companies that send information across the WAN link constantly find that 
circuit switching is not cost effective (as you pay while you are using it). 
When this is the case, it is usually more beneficial to pay the monthly fee to 
have a dedicated link to your service provider’s network — this is known as 
a leased line or point-to-point link.
With a leased line, you pay the monthly fee to the service provider to allocate 
dedicated links with dedicated bandwidth to your company’s network. For 
example, if you are the administrator of the network shown back in Figure 4-1 
and you pay a monthly fee for a leased line between Toronto and New York, 
this dedicated link is a pre-established connection that has a dedicated path 
for the information sent between your two office locations.

524
Introduction to WAN Terminology
A leased line typically has more bandwidth assigned than a circuit switch 
environment offers, and it sends voice and data. Examples of leased lines 
include T1 and T3 links:
 
✦ T1 link: Consists of 24 channels that carry data, with each channel 
offering 64 Kbps of bandwidth. The total bandwidth of a T1 link is 1.544 
Mbps (24 × 64 Kbps). If your company cannot afford or justify the cost 
of a T1 link, you can get a fractional T1, which allows the company to 
subscribe to a few channels and not all 24.
 
✦ T3 link: Leased line that offers a total bandwidth of 44.736 Mbps. A T3 
link is made up of twenty-eight T1 lines that are combined together to 
create the 44.736 Mbps.
Packet switching
A packet switch network is different from a circuit switch network and 
leased line in the sense that with a circuit switch network (and leased line), 
once the circuit is created, all data delivered takes the same pathway. With 
packet switched networks, the data is sent along different pathways within 
the provider’s network and assembled at the destination. (See Figure 4-2.)

Methods of Connecting to WANs
Looking at Figure 4-2, you see that packets sent from Toronto to New York 
are sent through different pathways on the packet switched network. It is 
also important to note that as each router sends the data to the next router, 
a temporary virtual circuit is created for that stage of the transmission. 
The virtual circuit has bandwidth allocated to it for that phase of the 
communication.
Examples of packet switched network technologies include the following:
 
✦ X.25: An older packet switch network technology that uses a packet 
assembler/disassembler (PAD) device that connects to the serial port on 
the router, allowing the device to connect to the X.25 network. X.25 has 
a transfer rate of around 2 Mbps.
 
✦ Frame relay: Has replaced X.25, as it is a digital network technology that 
can reach up to 50 Mbps.
 
✦ Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM): A unique packet switched network 
environment in the sense that it uses a fixed-length packet size, known 
as a cell, which is 53 bytes in size. ATM is a WAN technology that sends 
large types of data (such as video) with a transfer rate of 622 Mbps.
 
For the CCENT certification exam, remember that T1 and T3 links are 
dedicated leased lines, and that X.25, frame relay, and ATM are packet 
switched environments.
Methods of Connecting to WANs
There are a number of different ways to connect your router to a WAN 
environment. You will most likely connect a serial interface to the WAN link, 
or you will have a built-in interface on the router for the WAN technology 
you are connecting to. The following sections discuss the different types of 
ports that are present on Cisco devices to connect to your WAN environment.
Serial ports
When connecting your router to a WAN environment, one of the methods 
you can use is to connect the serial port on the router to a WAN device such 
as an external CSU/DSU to get a connection to the provider’s network. (See 
Figure 4-3.)

In Figure 4-3, you see that the serial port on each router connects to an 
external CSU/DSU device, which is then connected to the service provider’s 
network. In this example, the CSU/DSU is known as an external CSU/DSU 
because it is not part of the router itself and normally sits right beside (or on 
top of) the router. In this example, the CSU/DSU connects to a T1 link 
provided by the service provider. You can read more about using a CSU/DSU 
in Book II, Chapter 1.
You can also use the serial ports on your router to create a point-to-point 
link between two routers. Although this is not popular in the real world, it is 
a great concept for a lab environment. In order to connect two serial ports 
directly together, you need to obtain a DTE/DCE cable (also known as a 
back-to-back serial cable), which is similar to a crossover cable with Ethernet 
ports. The DCE end of the cable is connected to the router you wish to use 
to set the clock speed on the link. It does not really matter which router that 
is, but you will need to set the clock rate using the clock rate command 
on that router (see the “Setting the clock rate” section later in this chapter). 
Figure 4-4 displays the DTE end of a back-to-back cable being connected to a 
serial port on a router.

Integrated CSU/DSU port
A number of routers may come with a built-in CSU/DSU port, known as an 
integrated CSU/DSU port. This means that the line coming from your service 
provider connects directly to the CSU/DSU port on the router and not to an 
external device that is then connected to your serial port. Figure 4-5 displays 
an integrated CSU/DSU port on a Cisco 2811 router, which is used to connect 
to a leased T1 link.
ISDN ports
Your router may also connect to a WAN environment using an ISDN connec-
tion. A number of routers have built-in ISDN ports, which are used to con-
nect to the ISDN network. Figure 4-6 displays a built-in ISDN port on a Cisco 
router.

Configuring Serial Links
Once you have the WAN link connected to your router, you are then 
responsible for configuring your router for that WAN link. The following 
outlines the minimal steps you need to take to configure NY-R1, shown back 
in Figure 4-1.
To configure the serial interface, the first thing you want to do is configure 
the IP address on the interface with the ip address command, as shown 
here:

Book IV
Chapter 4
Introduction to 
WANs
529
Configuring Serial Links
NY-R1>enable
NY-R1#config term
NY-R1(config)#interface serial0/0
NY-R1(config-if)#ip address 24.0.0.1 255.0.0.0
After you configure the IP address on the serial port you next need to 
configure the serial port with a protocol and also a clock rate. The following 
sections discuss how to configure these settings on the serial port.
Serial link protocols
Once you configure the basic IP settings on the interface, you then need to 
configure the encapsulation protocol to carry data across the serial link. 
There are two major serial link protocols that you can use to send and 
receive data on a serial link — HDLC and PPP.
HDLC
The High Data Link Control (HDLC) protocol is a data link layer protocol 
that is an ISO standard, but each vendor has its own implementation of the 
protocol. This means that if you are connecting two routers with different 
manufacturers, you will need to use a different serial link protocol, as the 
two different implementations of HDLC are incompatible. 
HDLC is the default serial link protocol on Cisco routers, but it has a limitation 
of not supporting any form of authentication. You can use HDLC on only 
synchronous links such as a T1 leased line.
To enable HDLC on your serial link, use the following commands in addition 
to assigning an IP address:
NY-R1(config-if)#encapsulation hdlc
 
Remember for the CCENT exam that both ends of the serial link must use the 
same serial link protocol. If your router has loaded the HDLC protocol on the 
serial link, the other end of the link must be HDLC.
PPP
The Point-To-Point Protocol (PPP) is an industry standard for carrying data 
across a serial link. PPP is supported by many different vendors and allows 
you to create a serial link between routers of different manufacturers.
The benefit of PPP is that you can use it on synchronous serial links such as 
an ISDN or T1 link, but you can also use it on an asynchronous link such as 
a dialup link. PPP also supports authentication to verify who is connecting 
across the link.

530
Configuring Serial Links
PPP supports two different authentication protocols:
 
✦ PAP: The Password Authentication Protocol is an authentication 
protocol that sends the username and password in clear text when a 
connection is made between the two hosts. Sending the password in 
clear text is a security vulnerability, as someone can tap into the 
communication and discover the username and password.
 
✦ CHAP: The Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol is an 
authentication protocol that does not send the authentication information 
in clear text. With CHAP, a secret is known to both parties and then 
passed through a mathematical function (known as a hashing algorithm), 
and an answer is generated (known as the hash value). The hash value, 
not the actual secret, is sent across the link. A hash value is a unique 
value that can be calculated only by knowing the original data (in this 
case, the secret).
To configure your router for PPP authentication, you must perform the 
following steps on the serial links on both routers after assigning the IP 
address:
 
1. Set the hostname on each router.
 
 When a router connects to another router, the hostname of the router 
connecting will be the username for authentication purposes.
 
2. Create a username and password on each router, with the username 
being the hostname of the router connecting.
 
 Ensure the password for both ends is the same.
The following is the code sample you use on the NY-R1 router back in 
Figure 4-1 to configure PPP authentication:
NY-R1(config)#username TOR-R1 password mypass
NY-R1(config)#interface serial 0/0
NY-R1(config-if)#encapsulation ppp
NY-R1(config-if)#ppp authentication chap
In the preceding code, because the other router that will be connecting to 
this router is named TOR-R1, you need to create a username on the New 
York router called TOR-R1. Also note that this name is case sensitive, so 
watch how the hostnames are configured on your different routers.
After setting the username and password, the encapsulation protocol is set 
to PPP on the serial interface. After configuring PPP as the encapsulation 
protocol, I then configure PPP authentication to CHAP. (I could have also 
specified PAP.)

Book IV
Chapter 4
Introduction to 
WANs
531
Chapter Summary
 
For the CCENT exam, know how to configure the serial link for an 
encapsulation protocol such as PPP, and also know how to configure PPP 
authentication on the routers.
Setting the clock rate
Once you have configured the IP address on the serial interface and the 
encapsulation protocol to either PPP or HDLC, and set any authentication 
requirements you may have on PPP, you are now ready to work with the 
clock rate on the link.
The clock rate determines the speed of the link and is controlled by the Data 
Communication Equipment (DCE). The DCE device is normally at the service 
provider, so you typically do not set the clock rate on your WAN connection — 
the service provider sets it.
If you are working in a test lab and have connected two routers together 
with a DCE/DTE cable, you will be required to set the clock rate from the 
DCE device in the configuration. The DCE device is the device connected 
to the DCE end of the cable. To set the clock rate on the serial link of a DCE 
device, use the following command:
NY-R1(config-if)#clock rate 64000
In the preceding code example, I set the clock rate to 64000 bits per second, 
which is a 64 Kbps link. To see a list of values that you can assign to the 
clock rate command, use the clock rate ? command.
 
For the CCENT exam, remember that the clock rate needs to be configured 
only on the DCE device and is normally set by the service provider of a WAN 
link.
Chapter Summary
This chapter illustrates key points of interest when dealing with WAN links 
on a Cisco router. The following are some key points to remember for the 
CCENT certification exam:
 
✦ Circuit switch environments establish a pathway (a circuit) that is used 
for the duration of the communication. But after it is disconnected and 
the next circuit is established, the pathway can be different.
 
✦ The phone system and ISDN are examples of circuit switched 
environments.

532
Lab Exercises
 
✦ A dedicated leased line is a permanent point-to-point link that typically 
has more bandwidth than a circuit switched environment. T1 and T3 
links are examples of leased lines.
 
✦ Packet switched environments deal with routing each packet a different 
way and then assembling them at the end. X.25 and frame relay are 
examples of packet switched networks.
 
✦ You can connect the serial port to an external CSU/DSU, which connects 
your network to a leased line such as that used by a T1 or T3 link.
 
✦ A router may have an internal, or integrated, CSU/DSU port, which 
connects directly to the leased line coming into your building from the 
service provider.
 
✦ The HDLC encapsulation protocol can be utilized when you are using 
Cisco devices at either end of the serial link.
 
✦ You can use the PPP encapsulation protocol when connecting different 
manufacturer routers over a serial link.
 
✦ PPP supports two authentication protocols — PAP and CHAP. CHAP is 
the more secure authentication protocol, as it does not send the username 
and password in clear text.
Lab Exercises
This chapter introduces you to concepts related to WAN terminology and 
configuring your Cisco router for WAN communication. The following labs 
are designed to give you the opportunity to practice these concepts.
Lab 4-1: Configuring HDLC encapsulation
In this lab, configure the serial ports on TOR-R1 and NY-R1, which are 
connected using a back-to-back serial cable. Use Figure 4-7 as a guideline for 
the configuration of these routers.
 
1. Connect the two routers with a back-to-back serial cable, but connect 
the DCE end of the back-to-back cable to the TOR-R1 router.
 
2. Configure the following on the TOR-R1 router:
Router>enable
Router#config term
Router(config)#hostname TOR-R1
TOR-R1(config)#interface f0/0
TOR-R1(config-if)#ip address 23.0.0.1 255.0.0.0
TOR-R1(config-if)#no shutdown
TOR-R1(config-if)#interface s0/0
TOR-R1(config-if)#ip address 24.0.0.1 255.0.0.0

Lab Exercises
Lab 4-2: Configuring PPP encapsulation
In this lab, change the configuration of the routers that you worked on in 
Lab 4-1 to use the PPP encapsulation protocol instead of HDLC.
 
1. Enable PPP on the TOR-R1 router using the following commands:
TOR-R1(config)#username NY-R1 password mypass
TOR-R1(config)#interface serial 0/0
TOR-R1(config-if)#encapsulation ppp
 
 Why are you configuring a username of NY-R1 on the Toronto router?
 
 ______________________________________________________
 
2. Configure PPP authentication on the Toronto router using the following 
commands:
TOR-R1(config-if)#ppp authentication chap
 
3. Ensure you can ping the New York router.
 
4. Enable PPP on the NY-R1 router using the following commands:
NY-R1(config)#username TOR-R1 password mypass
NY-R1(config)#interface serial 0/0
NY-R1(config-if)#encapsulation ppp
 
5. Configure PPP authentication on the New York router using the 
following command:
NY-R1(config-if)#ppp authentication chap
 
6. Verify you can ping NY-R1 from the TOR-R1 router.

Introduction to WANs

Answers
 1 B. ISDN is an example of a circuit switched technology where the bandwidth is 
allocated for the duration of the connection. See “Circuit switching.”
 2 B, D, E. To configure PPP authentication, you set the hostname on each router to 
a unique name and then create a username on each router that is the hostname 
of the other router. (Set the passwords to the same value.) Then you enable PPP 
authentication and specify the authentication protocol of either CHAP or PAP. 
Review “Serial link protocols.”
 3 A. The encapsulation protocol needs to be set to PPP. The default encapsulation 
protocol on a serial link is HDLC. Check out “Serial link protocols.”
 4 C. The DCE device is responsible for setting the clock rate. Peruse “Setting the 
clock rate.”
 5 C, D. X.25 and frame relay are examples of packet-switching technologies where 
each packet can take a different route. Take a look at “Packet switching.”
 6 A. The PPP encapsulation protocol is an industry standard available with most 
router manufacturers and can be used for authentication across router vendors. 
Peek at “Serial link protocols.”
 7 B. To utilize the Cisco proprietary version of HDLC, you use the encapsulation 
hdlc command. Look over “Serial link protocols.”
 8 A. A T1 or T3 link is considered a dedicated leased line, as the connection is 
always available and dedicated to your company. Study “Leased lines.”
 9 D. CHAP is the more secure PPP authentication protocol, as the password is not 
passed in clear text across the network. Refer to “PPP.”
 10 C. Circuit switching is responsible for creating the circuit, which is bandwidth 
and pathway dedicated to the communication until the connection is closed. 
Examine “Circuit switching.”

T
his appendix is designed to give you an overview of the system require-
ments needed to run the software found on the accompanying CD. I also 
include a description of what you can find on the CD; it will help you pre-
pare for the CCENT certification exam!
System Requirements
Make sure your computer meets the minimum system requirements shown 
in the following list. If your computer does not meet most of these require-
ments, you might have problems using the software and files on the CD. For 
the latest and greatest information, please refer to the ReadMe file located 
at the root of the CD-ROM.
 
✦ A PC running Microsoft Windows 2000 or later
 
✦ A Macintosh running Apple OS X or later
 
✦ An Internet connection
 
✦ A CD-ROM drive
If you need more information on the basics, check out these books pub-
lished by Wiley: PCs For Dummies, 11th edition, by Dan Gookin; Macs For 
Dummies, 10th edition, by Edward C. Baig; and Windows XP For Dummies, 
2nd edition, Windows 7 For Dummies, and Windows Vista For Dummies, all by 
Andy Rathbone.

Using the CD
To install the items from the CD to your hard drive, follow these steps.
 
1. Insert the CD into your computer’s CD-ROM drive to bring up the 
license agreement.
 
 Note to Windows users: The interface won’t launch if you have 
AutoRun disabled. In that case, do this:
 
a. Choose Start➪Run.
 
 For Windows Vista and Windows 7, choose Start➪All Programs➪
Accessories➪Run.
 
b. In the dialog box that appears, type D:\start.exe.
 
 Replace D with the proper letter if your CD-ROM drive uses a differ-
ent letter. If you don’t know the letter, see how your CD-ROM drive is 
listed under My Computer (XP and earlier) or Computer (Vista and 7).
 
2. Click OK.
 
 Note for Mac Users: The CD icon will appear on your desktop. Just 
double-click the icon to open the CD and then double-click the Start 
icon.
 
3. Read through the license agreement and then click the Accept button 
to use the CD.
 
 The CD interface appears, from which you can install the programs and 
run the demos with just a click of a button (or two).
What You Will Find on the CD
The following sections are a summary of the software on the CD-ROM 
included with this book.
Test Engine
The Test Engine is located on the CD interface’s Test Engine tab and is 
designed to simulate the actual CCENT certification exam, which includes 
questions with multiple choice answers. The Test Engine on the CD is not 
adaptive, though, and it is not timed — so you might want to time yourself to 
gauge your speed. With each question you have the option to click the Show 
Answer button and then they see the correct answer and an explanation. You 
can also review all of your answers and the correct answers once you finish.

Appendix A
About the CD
541
Troubleshooting
541
There are two tests included on the CD’s Test Engine, and I highly recom-
mend that you wait until after you have read the entire book, performed 
all of the labs, and answered all of the Prep Test questions at the end of 
each chapter before attempting the Test Engine. I know a lot of readers 
like to do the Test Engine as they study, but the problem with doing that 
is you learn the questions — and the answers — in the Test Engine. By 
the time you are done reading the book, you get 100 percent on the Test 
Engine, and it is not an accurate assessment of how you will do on a live 
test. Save the Test Engine for the end — when you say to yourself, “I think 
I am ready,” do the Prep Test.
Videos
You will also find a Videos tab on the CD’s interface. The Videos section 
contains a number of videos I recorded. These videos are designed to 
demonstrate some of the different tasks you need to know in order to 
pass the CCENT certification exam. Although you should practice on 
your own routers and switches, or use a simulator, the videos are there 
for those who do not have a router handy and still want to see the topics 
they read about executed on a live system.
Lab Manual PDF files
Also located on the CD’s interface is a Lab Manual tab. The Lab Manual 
section contains two PDFs. The first PDF is the Lab Manual and contains all 
of the labs from each chapter in one central place. It may be useful to print 
the lab manual and work off the printout instead of writing in the book.
The second PDF is the Lab Manual Answer Key and contains all the 
answers to the lab exercises. You will find this most useful so that you 
can verify your answers to the lab exercises.
Adobe Reader
Included on the CD is a copy of Adobe Reader (for Windows and Mac) 
so you can view PDF files that accompany the book’s content. For more 
information on Adobe Reader or to check for a newer version, visit 
Adobe’s Web site at www.adobe.com.
Troubleshooting
You should not experience any problems with the CD running on your 
system as long as you meet the system requirements listed in the “System 
Requirements” section earlier in this appendix. The two likeliest problems 

Troubleshooting
542
are that you don’t have enough memory (RAM) for the programs you want 
to use or you have other programs running that are affecting the installation 
or execution of a program. If you get an error message such as Not enough 
memory or Setup cannot continue, try one or more of the following sug-
gestions, and then try using the software again:
 
✦ Turn off any antivirus software running on your computer. Installation 
programs sometimes mimic virus activity and might make your com-
puter incorrectly believe that it is being infected by a virus. Be sure to turn 
the virus protection back on once you have finished troubleshooting!
 
✦ Close all running programs. The more programs you have running, the 
less memory is available to other programs. Installation programs typi-
cally update files and programs, so if you keep other programs running, 
the installation might not work properly.
 
✦ Have your local computer store add more RAM to your computer. 
This is, admittedly, a drastic and somewhat expensive step. However, 
adding more memory can really help the speed of your computer and 
allow more programs to run at the same time.
