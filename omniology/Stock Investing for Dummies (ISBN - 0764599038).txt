Dedication
For my beloved Fran, Adam, Joshua, and a loving, supportive family, I thank
God for you.
I also dedicate this book to the millions of investors who deserve more
knowledge and information to achieve lasting prosperity.
Author’s Acknowledgments
First and foremost, I offer my appreciation and gratitude to the wonderful
people at Wiley. It has been a pleasure to work with such a top-notch organi-
zation that works so hard to create products that offer readers tremendous
value and information. I wish all of you continued success! There are some
notables there whom I want to single out.
The first person is Jennifer Connolly (my project editor). She is a true publish-
ing and writing professional who has been extremely helpful, understanding,
and patient. Those words are not enough to express my thanks for her fantastic
guidance. May God bless her growing family! (Jennifer took over in mid-stream
for the wonderful Sherri Pfouts.)
Sarah Faulkner (my copy editor) has made sure my mish-mash of content
is readable and professional (no small feat). I thank her sincerely and I am
grateful she worked on this book with her impressive editing skills.
The technical editor Steven Dolvin is a superb financial pro. His expertise and
insights have helped me improve the content for you and have helped me
learn as well. I wish him continued success.
My gratitude goes out to the acquisitions editor Stacy Kennedy for making
this For Dummies book happen. For Dummies books don’t magically appear
at the bookstore, they happen due to the foresight and efforts of people like
Stacy. Wiley is fortunate to have her (and the others also mentioned)!
Fran, Lipa Zyenska, you helped make those late nights at the computer more
tolerable, and you helped me focus on the important things. Te amo and
I thank God that you are by my side. With you and the rest of my loving
family, I know that the future will be bright.
Lastly, I want to acknowledge you, the reader. Over the years, you have made
the For Dummies books what they are today. Your devotion to these wonder-
ful books created a foundation that played a big part in the creation of this
book and many more yet to come. Thank you!

Introduction
S
tock Investing For Dummies, 2nd Edition, has been an honor for me to
write. I’m grateful that I can share my thoughts, information, and experi-
ence with such a large and devoted group of readers.
Although the stock market has served millions of investors for nearly a cen-
tury, recent years have shown me that a great investing vehicle such as
stocks can be easily misunderstood, misused, and even abused. The great
bull market of 1982–1999 came to a screeching halt in 2000. During 2000–2002,
millions of investors lost a total of over 5 trillion dollars. What bothers me is
that much of that loss was easily avoidable. Investors at the tail end of a bull
market often think that stock investing is an easy, carefree, certain way to
make a quick fortune. How wrong they are! The countless stories of investors
who lost tremendous amounts of money speculating in tech stocks, dot-
coms, and other flashy stocks are lessons for all of us. Successful stock
investing takes diligent work and knowledge like any other meaningful pur-
suit. This book can definitely help you avoid the mistakes others have made
and can point you in the right direction.
Explore the pages of this book and find the topics that most interest you
regarding the world of stock investing. Let me assure you that I have squeezed
over two decades of experience, education, and expertise between these
covers. My track record is as good (or better) as the track records of the
experts who trumpet their successes. More importantly, I share information to
avoid common mistakes (some of which I made myself!). Understanding what
not to do can be just as important as figuring out what to do. In all the years
that I have counseled and educated investors, the single difference between
success and failure, between gain and loss, boils down to one word: knowl-
edge. Take this book as your first step in a lifelong learning adventure.
About This Book
The stock market has been a cornerstone of the investor’s passive wealth-
building program for over a century and continues in this role. The period 
of 1995–2005 was one huge roller coaster ride for stock investors. If it was 
a stock chart, the graph would look like Mt. Everest. Fortunes were made 
and lost. With just a little more knowledge and a few wealth-preserving tech-
niques, more investors could have held onto their hard-earned stock market
fortunes. With all the media attention, all the talking heads on radio and TV,

and the books with titles like Dow at 36,000, the investing public still didn’t
avoid losing trillions in a historic stock market debacle. Sadly, even the so-
called experts who understood stocks didn’t see the economic and geopoliti-
cal forces that acted like a tsunami on the market. This book also gives you a
“heads up” on those megatrends and events that will affect your stock portfo-
lio. While other books may tell you about stocks, this book tells you about
stocks and what affects them.
This book is designed to give you a realistic approach to making money 
in stocks. It provides the essence of sound, practical stock investing strate-
gies and insights that have been market tested and proven from nearly a 
hundred years of stock market history. I don’t expect you to read it cover 
to cover, although I’d be delighted if you read every word! Instead, this book
is designed as a reference tool. Feel free to read the chapters in whatever
order you choose. You can flip to the sections and chapters that interest you
or those that include topics that you need to know more about.
Stock Investing For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is also a book that is quite different
from the “get rich with stocks” titles that have crammed the bookshelves in
recent years. It doesn’t take a standard approach to the topic; it doesn’t
assume that stocks are a sure thing and the be-all and end-all of wealth build-
ing. At times in this book, I tell you not to invest in stocks. This book can help
you succeed not only in up markets but also in down markets. Bull markets
and bear markets come and go, but the informed investor can keep making
money no matter what. To give you an extra edge, I have tried to include
information about the investing environment for stocks. Whether it is politics
or hurricanes (or both), you need to know how “the big picture” affects your
stock investment decisions.
Conventions Used in This Book
To make navigating through this book easier, I’ve established the following
conventions:
 Italic highlights new terms that are defined.
 Monofont is used for Web addresses.
 Sidebars, shaded gray boxes of text, are filled with interesting informa-
tion that isn’t pertinent to your understanding of the topic, but is inter-
esting nonetheless.
What You’re Not to Read
Sidebars (gray boxes of text) in this book give you a more in-depth look at a
certain topic. While they further illuminate a particular point, these sidebars
2
Stock Investing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

aren’t crucial to your understanding of the rest of the book. Feel free to read
them or skip them. Of course, I’d love for you to read them all, but my feel-
ings won’t be hurt if you decide to skip them over.
The text that accompanies the Technical Stuff icon can be passed over as well.
The text associated with this icon gives some technical details about stock
investing that are certainly interesting and informative, but you can still come
away with the information you need with or without reading this text.
Foolish Assumptions
I figure you’ve picked up this book for one or more of the following reasons:
 You’re a beginner and want a crash course on stock investing that’s an
easy read.
 You’re already a stock investor, and you need a book that allows you to
read only those chapters that cover specific stock investing topics of
interest to you.
 You need to review your own situation with the information in the book
to see if you missed anything when you invested in that hot stock that
your brother-in-law recommended.
 You need a great gift! When Uncle Mo is upset over his poor stock picks,
you can give him this book so he can get back on his financial feet. Be
sure to get a copy for his broker, too. (Odds are that the broker was the
one who made those picks to begin with.)
How This Book Is Organized
The information is laid out in a straightforward format. The parts progress in
a logical approach that any investor interested in stocks can follow very
easily.
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing
This section is for everyone. Understanding the essentials of stock investing
and investing in general will only help you, especially in uncertain economic
times. Stocks may even touch your finances in ways not readily apparent. For
example, stocks are not only in individual accounts; they’re also in mutual
funds and pension plans.
3
Introduction

An important point is that stocks are really financial tools that are a means to
an end. Investors should be able to answer the question “Why am I consider-
ing stocks at all?” Stocks are a great vehicle for wealth building, but only if
investors realize what they can accomplish and how to use them.
One of the essentials of stock investing is understanding risk. Most people
are clueless about risk. Chapter 4, on risk, is one of the most important chap-
ters that serious stock investors should read. You can’t avoid every type of
risk out there. (Life itself embodies risk.) However, this chapter can help you
recognize it and find ways to minimize it in your stock investing program.
Part II: Before You Start Buying
Once you’re ready to embark on your career as a stock investor, you’ll need to
use some resources to gather information about the stocks you’re interested in.
Fortunately, you live in the information age. I pity the investors from the 1920s,
who didn’t have access to so many resources, but today’s investors are in an
enviable position. This part tells you where to find information and how to use
it to be a more knowledgeable investor (a rarity in recent years!). For example, I
explain that stocks can be used for both growth and income purposes, and I dis-
cuss the characteristics of each. See Chapters 8 and 9 for more information.
When you’re ready to invest, you’ll invariably have to turn to a broker. There
are several types, so you should know which is which. The wrong broker
could make you . . . uh . . . broker. Chapter 7 helps you choose.
Part III: Picking Winners
Part III is about picking good stocks by using microeconomics, meaning that
you look at the stocks of individual companies. I explain how to evaluate a
company’s products, services, and other factors so that you can determine
whether a company is strong and healthy.
One of the major differences with this edition versus the first edition is the
emphasis on emerging sector opportunities. If I can steer you toward those
segments of the stock market that show solid promise for the coming years,
then that alone would make your stock portfolio thrive. Putting your money
into solid companies that are in thriving industries has been the hallmark of
superior stock investing throughout history. It’s no different now. Check out
Chapter 13 if you want to know more about emerging sector opportunities.
Where do you turn to find out about a company’s financial health? In Chapter
11, I show you the documents you should review to make a more informed
decision. Once you find the information, you’ll discover how to make sense 
of that data as well. While you’re at it, check out Chapter 12 (on analyzing
industries).

Stock Investing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

I compare buying stock to picking goldfish. If you look at a bunch of goldfish
to choose which ones to buy, you want to make sure that you pick the health-
iest ones. With stocks, you also need to pick companies that are healthy. Part
III can help you do that.
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics
Even the stocks of great companies can fall in a bad investing environment.
This is where you should be aware of the “macro.” If stocks were goldfish, the
macro would be the pond or goldfish bowl. In that case, even healthy goldfish
can die if the water is toxic. Therefore, you should monitor the investing envi-
ronment for stocks. Part IV reveals tips, strategies, and resources that you
shouldn’t ignore.
Once you understand stocks and the economic environment in which they
operate, choose the strategy and the tactics to help steer you to your wealth-
building objectives. Chapter 17 reveals some of my all-time favorite tech-
niques for building wealth and holding on to your stock investment gains.
(Definitely check it out.)
You may be an investor, but that doesn’t mean that you have deep pockets.
Chapter 18 tells you how to buy stocks with lower (or no) transaction costs.
If you’re going to buy the stock anyway, why not save on commissions and
other costs?
As an investor, you must keep an eye on what the company insiders are
doing. In Chapter 19, I explain what it may mean if the company’s manage-
ment is buying or selling the same stock that you’re considering.
After you spend all your time, money, and effort to grow your money in the
world of stocks, you have yet another concern: holding on to your hard-
earned gains. This challenge is summarized in one word: taxes. Sound tax
planning is crucial for everyone who works hard. After all, taxes are the
biggest expense in your lifetime (right after children!). See Chapter 20 for
more information.
Part V: The Part of Tens
I wrap up the book with a hallmark of For Dummies books — the Part of Tens.
These chapters give you a mini crash course in stock investing, including ten
ways to protect yourself from fraud.
In this part, I offer some clues that signal a stock price increase and how to
recognize the warning signs of a stock poised to fall. Also review the list of
ten challenges and opportunities that face stock investors (Chapter 24). This
is a new chapter that I feel is critical for your investing strategy.
5
Introduction

Part VI: Appendixes
Don’t overlook the appendixes. I pride myself on the resources I can provide
my students and readers so that they can make informed investment deci-
sions. Whether the topic is stock investing terminology, economics, or avoid-
ing capital gains taxes, I include a treasure trove of resources to help you.
Whether you go to a bookstore, the library, or the Internet, Appendix A gives
you some great places to turn to for help. In Appendix B, I explain financial
ratios. These important numbers help you better determine whether to
invest in a particular company’s stock.
Icons Used in This Book
This icon flags a particular bit of advice that just may give you an edge over
other investors.
When you see this icon, I’m reminding you about some information that you
should always keep stashed in your memory, whether you’re new to investing
or an old pro.
Pay special attention to this icon because the advice can prevent headaches,
heartaches, and financial aches.
The text attached to this icon may not be crucial to your success as an
investor, but it may enable you to talk shop with investing gurus and better
understand the financial pages of your favorite business publication or Web
site.
Where to Go from Here
You may not need to read every chapter to make you more confident as a
stock investor, so feel free to jump around to suit your personal needs. Since
every chapter is designed to be as self-contained as possible, it won’t do you
any harm to “cherry-pick” what you really want to read. But if you’re like me,
you still may want to check out every chapter because you never know when
you can come across a new tip or resource that will make a profitable differ-
ence in your stock portfolio. I want you to be successful so that I can brag
about you in the next edition!

Stock Investing

M
any investors do things in reverse; they buy stock
first and learn “some lessons” afterward. Your suc-
cess is dependent on doing your homework before you
invest your first dollar in stocks. Most investors don’t
realize that they should be scrutinizing their own situa-
tions and financial goals at least as much as they scruti-
nize stocks. But how else can you know which stocks are
right for you? Too many people risk too much simply
because they don’t take stock of their current needs,
goals, and risk tolerance before they invest. The chapters
in this part tell you what you need to know to choose the
stocks that best suit you.

 Exploring investment strategies
S
tock investing became all the rage during the late 1990s. Even tennis
stars and punk rockers got into the act. Investors watched their stock
portfolios and stock mutual funds skyrocket as the stock market was reach-
ing the mania stage at the tail-end of an 18-year upswing (or bull market) in
stocks. (See Chapter 15 for more information on bull markets.) Investment
activity in the United States is a great example of the popularity that stocks
experienced during that time period. By 1999, over half of U.S. households
became participants in the stock market. Yet millions lost money when the
stock market fell big time (the bear market — see Chapter 15) during
2000–2002. People invested. Yet they really didn’t know exactly what they
were investing in. If they had a rudimentary understanding of what stock
really is, perhaps they could have avoided some expensive mistakes. The
purpose of this book is not only to tell you about the basics of stock investing
but also to let you in on some solid strategies that can help you profit from
the stock market. Before you invest your first dollar, you need to understand
the basics of stock investing.
Understanding the Basics
The basics are so basic that few people are doing them. Perhaps the most
basic (and therefore most important) thing to grasp is the risk you face when-
ever you do anything (like putting your hard-earned money in an investment
like a stock). When you lose track of the basics, you lose track of why you
invested to begin with. Find out more about risk (and the different kinds of
risk) in Chapter 4.

When the late comedian Henny Youngman was asked “How is your wife?” he
responded “Compared to what?” This applies to stocks. When you are asked
“how is your stock?” you can very well respond that it’s doing well especially
when compared to an acceptable “yardstick” such as a stock index (such as
the S&P 500). Find out more about indexes in Chapter 5.
The bottom line is that the first thing you do in stock investing is not send
your money to a brokerage account or go to a Web site to click “buy stock.”
The first thing you do is find out as much as you can about what stocks are
and how to use them to achieve your wealth-building goals.
Getting Prepared before You Get Started
Gathering information is critical in your stock-investing pursuits. There are
two times to gather information on your stock picks: before you invest . . .
and after. You obviously should become more informed before you invest
your first dollar. But you also need to stay informed about what’s happening
to the company whose stock you are buying and also about the industry and
the general economy. To find the best information sources, check out
Chapter 6.
When you are ready to invest, you will need a brokerage account. How do
you know which broker to use? Chapter 7 provides some answers and
resources to help you choose a broker.
Knowing How to Pick Winners
Once you get past the basics, you can get to the “meat” of stock picking.
Successful stock picking is not mysterious, but it does take some time, effort,
and analysis. It’s worth it since stocks are a convenient and important part of
most investors’ portfolios. Read the following section and be sure to “leap
frog” to the relevant chapters to get the inside scoop on “hot stocks.”
Recognizing stock value
Imagine that you like eggs and you’re willing to buy them at the grocery
store. In this example, the eggs are like companies, and the prices represent
the prices that you would pay for the companies’ stock. The grocery store is
the stock market. What if two brands of eggs are very similar, but one costs
10
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

50 cents while the other costs 75 cents? Which would you choose? Odds are
that you would look at both brands, judge their quality, and, if they were
indeed similar, take the cheaper eggs. The eggs at 75 cents are overpriced.
The same is true of stocks. What if you compare two companies that are simi-
lar in every respect but have different share prices? All things being equal,
the cheaper price has greater value for the investor. But the egg example has
another side.
What if the quality of the two brands of eggs is significantly different but their
prices are the same? If one brand of eggs is stale, of poor quality, and priced
at 50 cents and the other brand is fresh, of superior quality, and also priced
at 50 cents, which would you get? I’d take the good brand because they’re
better eggs. Perhaps the lesser eggs are an acceptable purchase at 10 cents,
but they’re definitely overpriced at 50 cents. The same example works with
stocks. A badly run company isn’t a good choice if you can buy a better com-
pany in the marketplace at the same — or a better — price.
Comparing the value of eggs may seem overly simplistic, but doing so does
cut to the heart of stock investing. Eggs and egg prices can be as varied as
companies and stock prices. As an investor, you must make it your job to find
the best value for your investment dollars. (Otherwise you get egg on your
face. You saw that one coming, right?)
Understanding how market capitalization
affects stock value
You can determine the value of a company (and thus the value of its stock) in
many ways. The most basic way to measure this value is to look at a com-
pany’s market value, also known as market capitalization (or market cap).
Market capitalization is simply the value you get when you multiply all the
outstanding shares of a stock by the price of a single share.
Calculating the market cap is easy. It’s the number of shares outstanding mul-
tiplied by the current share price. If the company has 1 million shares out-
standing and its share price is $10, the market cap is $10 million.
Small cap, mid cap, and large cap aren’t references to headgear; they’re refer-
ences to how large the company is as measured by its market value. Here are
the five basic stock categories of market capitalization:
 Micro cap (under $250 million): These stocks are the smallest and
hence the riskiest available.
 Small cap ($250 million to $1 billion): These stocks fare better than the
microcaps and still have plenty of growth potential. The key word here
is “potential.”
11
Chapter 1: Exploring the Basics

 Mid cap ($1 billion to $5 billion): For many investors, this category
offers a good compromise between small caps and large caps. These
stocks have some of the safety of large caps while retaining some of the
growth potential of small caps.
 Large cap ($5 billion to $25 billion): This category is usually best
reserved for conservative stock investors who want steady appreciation
with greater safety. Stocks in this category are frequently referred to as
“blue chips.”
 Ultra cap (over $25 billion): These stocks are also called “mega caps”
and obviously refer to companies that are the biggest of the big. Stocks
such as General Electric and Exxon Mobil are examples.
From a safety point of view, the company’s size and market value do matter.
All things being equal, large cap stocks are considered safer than small cap
stocks. However, small cap stocks have greater potential for growth.
Compare these stocks to trees: Which tree is sturdier — a giant California
redwood or a small oak tree that’s just a year old? In a great storm, the red-
wood holds up well, while the smaller tree has a rough time. But you also
have to ask yourself which tree has more opportunity for growth. The red-
wood may not have much growth left, but the small oak tree has plenty of
growth to look forward to.
For beginning investors, comparing market cap to trees isn’t so far-fetched.
You want your money to branch out without becoming a sap.
Although market capitalization is important to consider, don’t invest (or not
invest) just based on it. It’s just one measure of value. As a serious investor,
you need to look at numerous factors that can help you determine whether
any given stock is a good investment. Keep reading — this book is full of
information to help you decide.
Sharpening your investment skills
Investors who analyze the company can better judge the value of the stock
and profit from buying and selling it. Your greatest asset in stock investing is
knowledge (and a little common sense). To succeed in the world of stock
investing, keep in mind these key success factors:
 Analyze yourself. What do you want to accomplish with your stock
investing? What are your investment goals? Chapter 2 can help you
figure it out.
12
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

 Know where to get information. The decisions you make about your
money and what stocks to invest in require quality information. If you
want help with information sources, turn to Chapter 3.
 Understand why you want to invest in stocks. Are you seeking apprecia-
tion (capital gains) or income (dividends)? Look at Chapters 8 and 9 for
information on these topics.
 Do some research. Look at the company whose stock you’re considering
to see whether it’s a profitable company worthy of your investment dol-
lars. Chapters 10 and 11 help you scrutinize the company.
 Choosing a winning stock also means that you choose a winning indus-
try. You’ll frequently see stock prices of mediocre companies in “hot”
industries rise higher and faster than solid companies in floundering
industries. Therefore, choosing the industry is very important. Find out
more about analyzing industries in Chapter 12.
 Understand how the world affects your stock. Stocks succeed or fail in
large part due to the environment in which they operate. Economics and
politics make up that world, so you should know something about them.
Chapter 14 covers these topics, but also take a look at Chapter 2.
 Understand and identify megatrends. Doing so makes it easier for you to
make money. This edition spends more time and provides more
resources helping you see the opportunities in emerging sectors and
even avoid the problem areas (see Chapter 13 for details).
 Use investing strategies like the pros do. In other words, how you go
about investing can be just as important as what you invest in. Chapter
16 highlights techniques for investing to help you make more money
from your stocks.
 Keep more of the money you earn. After all your great work in getting
the right stocks and making the big bucks, you should know about keep-
ing more of the fruits of your investing. I cover taxes in stock investing in
Chapter 20.
 Sometimes, what people tell you to do with stocks is not as revealing as
what people are actually doing. This is why I like to look at company
insiders before I buy or sell that particular stock. To find out more about
“insider buying and selling,” read Chapter 19.
Actually, every chapter in the book offers you valuable guidance on some
essential aspect of the fantastic world of stocks. The knowledge you pick up
and apply from these pages has been tested over nearly a century of stock
picking. The investment experience of the past — the good, the bad, and
some of the ugly — is here for your benefit. Use this information to make a 
lot of money (and make me proud!). And don’t forget to check out the
Appendixes!

Chapter 1: Exploring the Basics

Boning Up on Strategies and Tactics
Successful investing isn’t just what you invest in, it’s also the way you invest.
I am very big on strategies such as trailing stops and limit orders. You can
find out more in Chapter 17.
Buying stocks doesn’t always mean that you must buy through a broker and
that it must be 100 shares. You can buy stock for as little as $25 using pro-
grams such as dividend reinvestment plans. Chapter 18 tells you more.
Getting Some Good Tips
Protecting yourself from downside exposure is what separates investors from
speculators, and Chapter 21 gives you ten warning signs regarding a stock’s
decline. I know that when I see some of these signs that (at the very least) I’ll
put on a stop loss order (Chapter 17) so that I can sleep at night. Sometimes
the return on your money is not as good as the return of your money.
If stocks give off “negative signals,” then there must also be “positive” ones 
as well. Chapter 22 gives you ten of the best signs that are commonly seen
before a stock is ready to rise. What better time to jump in?

Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Stock market schizophrenia
Have you ever noticed a stock going up even
though the company is reporting terrible
results? How about seeing a stock nosedive
despite the fact that the company is doing well?
What gives? Well, judging the direction of a
stock in a short-term period — over the next
few days or weeks — is almost impossible.
Yes, in the short term, stock investing is irra-
tional. The price of a stock and the value of its
company seem disconnected and almost schiz-
ophrenic. The key phrase to remember is “short
term.” A stock’s price and the company’s value
become more logical over an extended period
of time. The longer a stock is in the public’s view,
the more rational the performance of the stock’s
price. In other words, a good company contin-
ues to draw attention to itself; hence, more
people want its stock, and the share price rises
to better match the value of the company.
Conversely, a bad company doesn’t hold up to
continued scrutiny over time. As more and more
people see that the company isn’t doing well,
the share price declines. Over the long run, a
stock’s share price and the value of the com-
pany eventually become equal for the most part.

You should be aware about the risks that fraud presents you. It’s tough
enough to make money with stocks in an honest market. Yet we must always
be aware of those that would take our hard-earned money from us without our
consent. That’s why I include Chapter 24 — since you and I will always deal
with a part of the universe that will always give us problems . . . humanity.
Chapter 24 is (I believe) one of the best chapters in the book. It is very impor-
tant to understand if the environment for a particular stock is good or bad.
The best stocks in the world sink in a tough market while the worst stocks
can go up in a jubilant and rising market. Ideally, you avoid those stocks that
are in the tough market and find good stocks in a good market. This chapter
will clue you in regarding those markets.

Taking Stock of Your Current
Financial Situation and Goals
In This Chapter
 Preparing your personal balance sheet
 Looking at your cash flow statement
 Determining your financial goals
Yes, you want to make the big bucks. Or maybe you just want to get back
the big bucks you lost in the stock market debacle of 2000–2003.
(Investors who followed the guidelines from the first edition of this book did
much better than the crowd!) Either way, you want your money to grow so
that you can have a better life. But before you make reservations for that
Caribbean cruise you’re dreaming about, you have to map out your action
plan for getting there. Stocks can be a great component of most wealth-build-
ing programs, but you must first do some homework on a topic that you
should be very familiar with — yourself. That’s right. Understanding your
current financial situation and clearly defining your financial goals are the
first steps in successful investing.
This chapter is undoubtedly one of the most important chapters in this book.
At first, you may think it’s a chapter more suitable for some general book on
personal finance. Wrong! Unsuccessful investors’ greatest weakness is not
understanding their financial situation and how stocks fit in. Often, I counsel
people to stay out of the stock market because they aren’t prepared for the
responsibilities of stock investing — they haven’t been regularly reviewing
the company’s financial statements or tracking the company’s progress. Very
often, investors aren’t aware of the pitfalls of stock investing during bear 
markets.

Investing in stocks requires balance. Investors sometimes tie up too much
money in stocks, putting themselves at risk of losing a significant portion of
their wealth if the market plunges. Then again, other investors place little or
no money in stocks, and therefore miss out on excellent opportunities to
grow their wealth. Investors should make stocks a part of their portfolios, but
the operative word is part. You should only let stocks take up a portion of
your money. A disciplined investor also has money in bank accounts, bonds,
and other assets that offer growth or income opportunities. Diversification is
key to minimizing risk. (For more on risk, see Chapter 4.)
Establishing a Starting Point
Whether you’re already in stocks or you’re looking to get into stocks, you
need to find out about how much money you can afford to invest in stocks.
No matter what you hope to accomplish with your stock investing plan, the
first step a budding investor should take is figuring out how much you own
and how much you owe. To do this, prepare and review your personal bal-
ance sheet. A balance sheet is simply a list of your assets, your liabilities, and
what each item is currently worth so you can arrive at your net worth. Your
net worth is total assets minus total liabilities. I know that these terms sound
like accounting mumbo jumbo, but knowing your net worth is important to
your future financial success, so just do it.
Composing your balance sheet is simple. Pull out a pencil and a piece of
paper. For the computer savvy, a spreadsheet software program accom-
plishes the same task. Gather all your financial documents, such as bank and
brokerage statements and other such paperwork — you need figures from
these documents. Then follow the steps that I outline in the following sec-
tions. Update your balance sheet at least once a year to monitor your finan-
cial progress (Is your net worth going up or not?).
A second document to prepare is an income statement. An income statement
lists your total income and your total expenses to find out how well you are
doing. If your total income is greater than your total expenses, then you have
net income (Great!). If your total expenses meet or exceed your total income,
then that’s not good. You better look into increasing your income or decreas-
ing your expenses. You want to get to the point that you have net income so
that you can use that money to fund your stock purchases.
Your personal balance sheet is really no different from balance sheets that
giant companies prepare. (The main difference is a few zeros, but you can use
my advice in this book to work on changing that.) In fact, the more you find
out about your own balance sheet, the easier it is to understand the balance
sheet of companies in which you’re seeking to invest.

Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

Step 1: Making sure you 
have an emergency fund
First, list cash on your balance sheet (see the next step for more on listing
your assets). Your goal is to have, in reserve, at least three to six months’
worth of your gross living expenses in cash. The cash is important because 
it gives you a cushion. Three to six months is usually enough to get you
through the most common forms of financial disruption, such as losing your
job. Finding a new job can take anywhere from three to six months.
If your monthly expenses (or outgo) are $2,000, you should have at least
$6,000, and probably closer to $12,000, in a secure, FDIC-insured, interest-
bearing bank account (or other relatively safe interest-bearing vehicle such
as a money market fund). Consider this account an emergency fund and not
an investment. Don’t use this money to buy stocks.
Too many Americans don’t have an emergency fund, meaning that they put
themselves at risk. Walking across a busy street while wearing a blindfold is 
a great example of putting yourself at risk, and in recent years, investors have
done the financial equivalent. Investors piled on tremendous debt, put too
much into investments (such as stocks) that they didn’t understand, and 
had little or no savings. One of the biggest problems during 2000–2003 was
that savings were sinking to record lows while debt levels were reaching new
heights. People then sold many stocks because they needed funds for — you
guessed it — paying bills and debt.
Resist the urge to start thinking of your investment in stocks as a savings
account generating over 20 percent per year. This is dangerous thinking! If
your investments tank, or if you lose your job, you will have financial diffi-
culty and that will affect your stock portfolio (you might have to sell some
stocks in your account just to get money to pay the bills). An emergency fund
helps you through a temporary cash crunch.
Step 2: Listing your assets in 
decreasing order of liquidity
Liquid assets aren’t references to beer or cola (unless you’re Anheuser-
Busch). Instead, liquidity refers to how quickly you can convert a particular
asset (something you own that has value) into cash. If you know the liquidity
of your assets, including investments, you have some options when you need
cash to buy some stock (or pay some bill). All too often, people are short on
cash and have too much wealth tied up in illiquid investments such as real
estate. Illiquid is just a fancy way of saying that you don’t have the immediate
cash to meet a pressing need. (Hey, we’ve all had those moments!) Review
your assets and take measures to ensure that you have enough liquid assets
(along with your illiquid assets).
19
Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals 

Listing your assets in order of liquidity on your balance sheet gives you an
immediate picture of which assets you can quickly convert to cash and which
ones you can’t. If you need money now, you can see that cash in hand, your
checking account, and your savings account are at the top of the list. The
items last in order of liquidity become obvious; they’re things like real estate
and other assets that can take a long time to convert to cash.
Selling real estate, even in a seller’s market, can take months. Investors who
don’t have adequate liquid assets run the danger of selling assets quickly and
possibly at a loss because they scramble to accumulate the cash for their
short-term financial obligations. For stock investors, this scramble may
include prematurely selling stocks that they originally intended to use as
long-term investments.
Table 2-1 shows a typical list of assets in order of liquidity. Use it as a guide
for making your own asset list.

The first column of Table 2-1 describes the asset. You can quickly convert cur-
rent assets to cash — they’re more liquid; long-term assets have value, but you
can’t necessarily convert them to cash quickly — they aren’t very liquid.
Please take note. I have stocks listed as short-term in the table. The reason is
that this balance sheet is meant to list items in order of liquidity. Liquidity is
best embodied in the question “How quickly can I turn this asset into cash?”
Because a stock can be sold and converted to cash very quickly, it is a good
example of a liquid asset. (However, that is not the main purpose for buying
stocks.)
The second column gives the current market value for that item. Keep in mind
that this value is not the purchase price or original value; it’s the amount you
would realistically get if you sold the asset in the current market at that
moment.
The third column tells you how well that investment is doing, compared to
one year ago. If the percentage rate is 5 percent, that item increased in value
by 5 percent from a year ago. You need to know how well all your assets are
doing. Why? To adjust your assets for maximum growth or to get rid of assets
that are losing money. Assets that are doing well are kept (increase your hold-
ings?), and assets that are down in value are candidates for removal. Perhaps
you can sell them and reinvest the money elsewhere. In addition, the realized
loss has tax benefits (see Chapter 20).
Figuring the annual growth rate (in the third column) as a percentage isn’t
difficult. Say that you buy 100 shares of the stock Gro-A-Lot Corp. (GAL), and
its market value on December 31, 2003, is $50 per share for a total market
value of $5,000 (100 shares × $50 per share). When you check its value on
December 31, 2004, you find out the stock is at $60 per share (100 shares
times $60 equals a total market value of $6,000). The annual growth rate is 20
percent. You calculate this by taking the amount of the gain ($60 per share
less $50 per share = $10 gain per share), which is $1,000 (100 shares times the
$10 gain), and dividing it by the value at the beginning of the time period
($5,000). In this case, you get 20 percent ($1,000 divided by $5,000). What if
GAL also generates a dividend of $2 per share during that period; now what?
21
Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals 

In that case, GAL generates a total return of 24 percent. To calculate the total
return, add the appreciation ($10 per share times 100 shares equals $1,000)
and the dividend income ($2 per share times 100 shares equals $200) and
divide that sum ($1,000 + $200, or $1,200) by the value at the beginning of the
year ($50 per share times 100 shares or $5,000). The total is $1,200 ($1,000 of
appreciation and $200 total dividends), or 24 percent ($1,200 ÷ $5,000).
The last line lists the total for all the assets and their current market value.
The third column answers the question “How well did this particular asset
grow from a year ago?”
Step 3: Listing your liabilities
Liabilities are simply the bills that you’re obligated to pay. Whether it’s a
credit card bill or a mortgage payment, a liability is an amount of money you
have to pay back eventually (with interest). If you don’t keep track of your 
liabilities, you may end up thinking that you have more money than you
really do.
Table 2-2 lists some common liabilities. Use it as a model when you list your
own. You should list the liabilities according to how soon you need to pay
them. Credit card balances tend to be short-term obligations, while mort-
gages are long-term.

$4,000
15%
Personal loans
$13,000

Mortgage

The first column in Table 2-2 names the type of debt. Don’t forget to include
student loans and auto loans if you have any of these. Never avoid listing a
liability because you’re embarrassed to see how much you really owe. Be
honest with yourself — doing so helps you improve your financial health.
The second column shows the current value (or current balance) of your liabil-
ities. List the most current balance to see where you stand with your creditors.
22
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

The third column reflects how much interest you’re paying for carrying that
debt. This information is an important reminder about how debt can be a
wealth zapper. Credit card debt can have an interest rate of 18 percent or
more, and to add insult to injury, it isn’t even tax deductible. Using a credit
card to make even a small purchase costs you if you maintain a balance.
Within a year, a $50 sweater at 18 percent costs $59 when you add in the
potential interest you pay.
If you compare your liabilities in Table 2-2 and your personal assets in Table
2-1, you may find opportunities to reduce the amount you pay for interest.
Say, for example, that you pay 15 percent on a credit card balance of $4,000
but also have a personal asset of $5,000 in a bank savings account that’s earn-
ing 2 percent in interest. In that case, you may want to consider taking $4,000
out of the savings account to pay off the credit card balance. Doing so saves
you $520; the $4,000 in the bank was earning only $80 (2 percent of $4,000),
while you were paying $600 on the credit card balance (15 percent of $4,000).
If you can’t pay off high-interest debt, at least look for ways to minimize the
cost of carrying the debt. The most obvious ways include the following:
 Replacing high-interest cards with low-interest cards. Many companies
offer incentives to consumers, including signing up for cards with favor-
able rates that can be used to pay off high-interest cards.
 Replacing unsecured debt with secured debt. Credit cards and personal
loans are unsecured (you haven’t put up any collateral or other asset to
secure the debt); therefore, they have higher interest rates because this
type of debt is considered riskier for the creditor. Sources of secured
debt (such as home equity line accounts and brokerage accounts) pro-
vide you with a means to replace your high-interest debt with lower-
interest debt. You get lower interest rates with secured debt because it’s
less risky for the creditor — the debt is backed up by collateral (your
home or your stocks).
The year 2004 was the eighth consecutive year that personal bankruptcies
surpassed the million mark in the United States. Corporate bankruptcies
were also at record levels. Make a diligent effort to control and reduce your
debt, or the debt can become too burdensome. If you don’t, you may have to
sell your stocks just to stay liquid. Remember, Murphy’s Law states that you
will sell your stock at the worst possible moment! Don’t go there.
Step 4: Calculating your net worth
Your net worth is an indication of your total wealth. You can calculate your
net worth with this basic equation: total assets (Table 2-1) less total liabilities
(Table 2-2) equal net worth (net assets or net equity).
23
Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals 

Table 2-3 shows this equation in action with a net worth of $169,090 — a very
respectable number. For many investors, just being in a position where assets
exceed liabilities (a positive net worth) is great news. Use Table 2-3 as a model
to analyze your own financial situation. Your mission (if you choose to accept
it — and you should) is to ensure that your net worth increases from year to
year as you progress toward your financial goal.

your current finances. Take a close look at it and try to identify any changes

I owe, I owe, so off to work I go
One reason you continue to work is probably so
that you can pay off your bills. But many people
today are losing their jobs because their com-
pany owes, too!
Debt is one of the biggest financial problems in
America today. Companies and individuals hold-
ing excessive debt contributed to the stock
market’s massive decline in 2000 and the U.S.
recession in 2001. If individuals managed their
personal liabilities more responsibly, the gen-
eral economy would be much better off.
One reason the United States appeared to be
doing so well during the late 1990s was the fact
that individuals and organizations went on an
unprecedented spending binge, financed mostly
by excessive debt. The economy looked unstop-
pable. However, sooner or later you have to pay
the piper. Stock prices may go up and down, but
debt stays up until it is either paid down or the
debtor files for bankruptcy. As of the 4th quarter
of 2004, U.S. debt has surpassed a mind-boggling
$37 trillion, which means that consumers, busi-
nesses, and governments will continue dealing
with challenging times through this decade. Yes,
the stock market will be affected!

you can make to increase your wealth. Sometimes reaching your financial
goals can be as simple as refocusing the items on your balance sheet (use the
above table as a general guideline). Here are some brief points to consider:
 Is the money in your emergency (or rainy day) fund sitting in an ultra-
safe account and earning the highest interest available? Bank money
market accounts or money market funds are recommended. The safest
type of account is a U.S. Treasury money market fund. Banks are backed
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) while U.S. treasury
securities are backed by the “full faith and credit” of the Federal
Government.
 Can you replace depreciating assets with appreciating assets? Say that
you have two stereo systems. Why not sell one and invest the proceeds?
You may say, “But I bought that unit two years ago for $500, and if I sell 
it now, I’ll only get $300.” That’s your choice. You need to decide what
helps your financial situation more — a $500 item that keeps shrinking
in value (a depreciating asset) or $300 that can grow in value when
invested (an appreciating asset).
 Can you replace low-yield investments with high-yield investments?
Maybe you have $5,000 in a bank certificate of deposit earning 3 percent.
You can certainly shop around for a better rate at another bank, but you
can also seek alternatives that can offer a higher yield, such as U.S. sav-
ings bonds or short-term bond funds.
 Can you pay off any high-interest debt with funds from low-interest
assets? If, for example, you have $5,000 earning 2 percent in a taxable
bank account, and you have $2,500 on a credit card charging 18 percent
(nondeductible), you may as well pay off the credit card balance and
save on the interest.
 If you’re carrying debt, are you using that money for an investment
return that is greater than the interest you’re paying? Carrying a loan
with an interest rate of 8 percent is acceptable if that borrowed money 
is yielding more than 8 percent elsewhere. Suppose that you have $6,000
in cash in a brokerage account. If you qualify, you can actually make a
stock purchase greater than $6,000 by using margin (essentially a loan
from the broker). You can buy $12,000 of stock using your $6,000 in cash,
with the remainder financed by the broker. Of course, you pay interest on
that margin loan. But what if the interest rate is 6 percent and the stock
you’re about to invest in has a dividend that yields 9 percent? In that
case, the dividend can help you pay off the margin loan, and you keep 
the additional income. (For more on buying on margin, see Chapter 17.)
 Can you sell any personal stuff for cash? You can replace unproductive
assets with cash from garage sales and auction Web sites.
25
Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals 

 Can you use your home equity to pay off consumer debt? Borrowing
against your home has more favorable interest rates, and this interest is
still tax deductible. (Be careful about your debt level. See Chapter 23 for
warnings on debt and other concerns.)
Paying off consumer debt by using funds borrowed against your home is a
great way to wipe the slate clean. What a relief to get rid of your credit card
balances! Just don’t turn around and run up the consumer debt again. You
can get overburdened and experience financial ruin (not to mention home-
lessness). Not a pretty picture.
The important point to remember is that you can take control of your
finances with discipline (and with the advice I offer in this book).
Funding Your Stock Program
If you’re going to invest money in stocks, the first thing you need is . . .
money! Where can you get that money? If you’re waiting for an inheritance to
come through, you may have to wait a long time, considering all the advances
being made in healthcare lately. What’s that? You were going to invest in
healthcare stocks? How ironic. Yet, the challenge still comes down to how to
fund your stock program.
Many investors can reallocate their investments and assets to do the trick.
Reallocating simply means selling some investments or other assets and rein-
vesting that money into stocks. It boils down to deciding what investment or
asset you can sell or liquidate. Generally, you want to consider those invest-
ments and assets that give you a low return on your money (or no return at
all). If you have a complicated mix of investments and assets, you may want
to consider reviewing your options with a financial planner. Reallocation is
just part of the answer; your cash flow is the other part.
Ever wonder why there’s so much month left at the end of the money?
Consider your cash flow. Your cash flow refers to what money is coming in
(income) and what money is being spent (outgo). The net result is either a
positive cash flow or a negative cash flow, depending on your cash manage-
ment skills. Maintaining a positive cash flow (more money coming in than
going out) helps you increase your net worth (mo’ money, mo’ money, mo’
money!). A negative cash flow ultimately depletes your wealth and wipes out
your net worth if you don’t turn it around immediately. The following sec-
tions show you how to analyze your cash flow. The first step is to do a cash
flow statement.
26
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

Don’t confuse a cash flow statement with an income statement (also called a
“profit and loss statement” or an “income and expense statement”). A cash
flow statement is simple to calculate because you can easily track what goes
in and what goes out.
With a cash flow statement (see Table 2-6), you ask yourself three questions:
 What money is coming in? In your cash flow statement, jot down all
sources of income. Calculate it for the month and then for the year.
Include everything, including salary, wages, interest, dividends, and so
on. Add them all up and get your grand total for income.
 What is your outgo? Write down all the things that you spend money
on. List all your expenses. If possible, categorize them into essential and
nonessential. You can get an idea of all the expenses that you can reduce
without affecting your lifestyle. But before you do that, make as com-
plete a list as possible of what you spend your money on.
 What’s left? If your income is greater than your outgo, then you have
money ready and available for stock investing. No matter how small the
amount seems, it definitely helps. I’ve seen fortunes built when people
started to diligently invest as little as $25 to $50 per week or per month.
If your outgo is greater than your income, then you better sharpen your
pencil. Cut down on nonessential spending and/or increase your income.
If your budget is a little tight, hold off on your stock investing until your
cash flow improves.
Step 1: Tallying up your income
Using Table 2-4 as a worksheet, list and calculate the money you have coming
in. The first column describes the source of the money, the second column
27
Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals 
Dot-com-and-go
If you were publishing a book about negative
cash flow, look for the employees of any one of
a hundred dot-com companies to write it. Their
qualifications include working for a company
that flew sky-high in 1999 and crashed in 2000
and 2001. Companies such as eToys.com,
Pets.com, and DrKoop.com were given millions,
yet they couldn’t turn a profit and eventually
closed for business. You may as well call them
“dot-com-and-go.” You can learn from their
mistakes. (Actually, they could have learned
from you.) In the same way that profit is the
most essential single element in a business, a
positive cash flow is important for your finances
in general and for funding your stock investment
program in particular.

indicates the monthly amount from each respective source, and the last
column indicates the amount projected for a full year. Include all income,
such as wages, business income, dividends, interest income, and so on. Then
project these amounts for a year (multiply by 12) and enter those amounts in
the third column.

This is the amount of money you have to work with. To ensure your financial
health, don’t spend more than this amount. Always be aware of and carefully
manage your income.
Step 2: Adding up your outgo
Using Table 2-5 as a worksheet, list and calculate the money that’s going out.
What are you spending and on what? The first column describes the source
of the expense, the second column indicates the monthly amount, and the
third column shows the amount projected for a full year. Include all the
money you spend, including credit card and other debt payments; household
expenses, such as food, utility bills, and medical expenses; and money spent
for nonessential expenses such as video games and elephant-foot umbrella
stands.

Payroll taxes is just a category in which to lump all the various taxes that the
government takes out of your paycheck. Feel free to put each individual tax on
its own line if you prefer. The important thing is creating a comprehensive list
that is meaningful to you. You may notice that the outgo doesn’t include items
such as payments to a 401(k) plan and other savings vehicles. Yes, these items
do impact your cash flow, but they’re not expenses; the amounts that you
invest (or your employer invests for you) are essentially assets that benefit
your financial situation versus an expense that doesn’t help you build wealth.
To account for the 401(k), simply deduct it from the gross pay first before you
calculate the above worksheet. If, for example, your gross pay is $2,000 and
your 401(k) contribution is $300, then use $1,700 as your income figure.
Step 3: Creating a cash flow statement
Okay, you’re almost to the end. The last step is creating a cash flow state-
ment so that you can see (all in one place) how your money moves — how
much comes in and how much goes out and where it goes.
29
Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals 

Plug the amount of your total income (from Table 2-4) and the amount of your
total expenses (from Table 2-5) into the Table 2-6 worksheet to see your cash
flow. Do you have positive cash flow — more coming in than going out — so
that you can start investing in stocks (or other investments), or are expenses
overpowering your income? Doing a cash flow statement isn’t just about find-
ing money in your financial situation to fund your stock program. First and
foremost, it’s about your financial well-being. Are you managing your finances
well or not?

2004 was another record year for personal and business bankruptcies.
Personal debt and expenses far exceeded whatever income they generated.
That announcement is another reminder to watch your cash flow; keep your
income growing and your expenses and debt as low as possible.
Step 4: Analyzing your cash flow
Use your cash flow statement to identify sources of funds for your invest-
ment program. The more you can increase your income and the more you
can decrease your outgo, the better. Scrutinize your data. Where can you
improve the results? Here are some questions to ask yourself:
 How can you increase your income? Do you have hobbies, interests, or
skills that can generate extra cash for you?
 Can you get more paid overtime at work? How about a promotion or a
job change?
 Where can you cut expenses?
 Have you categorized your expenses as either “necessary” or 
“nonessential”?
30
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

 Can you lower your debt payments by refinancing or consolidating loans
and credit card balances?
 Have you shopped around for lower insurance or telephone rates?
 Have you analyzed your tax withholdings in your paycheck to make sure
that you are not overpaying your taxes (just to get your overpayment
back next year as a refund?)
Finding investment money in tax savings
According to the Tax Foundation, the average U.S. citizen pays more in taxes
than in food, clothing, and shelter combined. Sit down with your tax advisor
and try to find ways to reduce your taxes. A home-based business, for exam-
ple, is a great way to gain new income and increase your tax deductions,
resulting in a lower tax burden. Your tax advisor can make recommendations
that work for you.
One tax strategy to consider is doing your stock investing in a tax-sheltered
account such as a traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or a Roth
Individual Retirement Account (Roth IRA). Again, check with your tax advisor
for deductions and strategies available to you. For more on the tax implica-
tions of stock investing, see Chapter 20.
Setting Your Sights on 
Your Financial Goals
Consider stocks as tools for living, just like any other investment — no more,
no less. Stocks are the tools you use (one of many) to accomplish something —
to achieve a goal. Yes, successfully investing in stocks is the goal that you’re
probably shooting for if you’re reading this book. However, you must complete
the following sentence: “I want to be successful in my stock investing program
to accomplish _______.” You must consider stock investing as a means to an
end. When people buy a computer, they don’t (or shouldn’t) think of buying a
computer just to have a computer. People buy a computer because doing so
helps them achieve a particular result, such as being more efficient in business,
playing fun games, or having a nifty paperweight (tsk, tsk).
Know the difference between long-term, intermediate-term, and short-term
goals and then set some of each. Long-term is a reference to projects or finan-
cial goals that need funding five or more years from now. Intermediate-term
refers to financial goals that need funding two to five years from now, while
short-term goals need funding less than two years from now.
31
Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals 

Stocks, in general, are best suited for long-term goals such as these:
 Achieving financial independence (think retirement funding)
 Paying for future college costs
 Paying for any long-term expenditure or project
Some categories of stock (such as conservative or blue-chip) may be suitable
for intermediate-term financial goals. If, for example, you will retire four years
from now, conservative stocks are appropriate. If you’re optimistic about the
stock market and confident that stock prices will rise, then go ahead and
invest. However, if you’re negative about the market (you’re bearish, or you
believe that stock prices will decline), you may want to wait until the econ-
omy starts to forge a clear path. For more on investing in bull or bear mar-
kets, see Chapter 15.
Stocks generally aren’t suitable for short-term investing goals because stock
prices can behave irrationally in a short period of time. Stocks fluctuate from
day to day, so you don’t know what the stock will be worth in the near future.
You may end up with less money than you expected. For investors seeking to
reliably accrue money for short-term needs, short-term bank certificates of
deposit or money market funds are more appropriate.
In recent years, investors have sought quick, short-term profits by trading
and speculating in stocks. Lured by the fantastic returns generated by the
stock market in the late 1990s, investors saw stocks as a get-rich-quick
scheme. It is very important for you to understand the difference between
investing, saving, and speculating. Which one do you want to do? Knowing the
answer to this question is crucial to your goals and aspirations. Investors
who don’t know the difference tend to get burned. Here’s some information
to help you distinguish among these three actions:
 Investing is the act of putting your current funds into securities or tan-
gible assets for the purpose of gaining future appreciation, income, or
both. You need time, knowledge, and discipline to invest. The invest-
ment can fluctuate in price, but has been chosen for long-term potential.
 Saving is the safe accumulation of funds for a future use. Savings don’t
fluctuate and are generally free of financial risk. The emphasis is on
safety and liquidity.
 Speculating is the financial world’s equivalent of gambling. An
investor who speculates is seeking quick profits gained from short-term
price movements in that particular asset or investment.
These distinctly different concepts are often confused even among so-called
financial experts. I know of one financial advisor who actually put a child’s
32
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

college fund money into an Internet stock fund only to lose over $17,000 in
less than ten months! This advisor thought that she was investing, but in real-
ity, she was speculating. I know of another advisor who told a client to avoid
savings accounts altogether because the client had a 401(k) plan. This partic-
ular advisor didn’t catch the crucial difference between “saving” and “invest-
ing.” The client eventually found out the difference; his 401(k) fell by 40
percent when the bear market of 2000 arrived.
Fortunately, we can learn from these situations and get back on track. That
child that lost the $17,000? He is my neighbor and I helped the father to rein-
vest the remaining funds. The portfolio doubled in value by the following
year. It is still growing. The second fellow that lost 40 percent in his 401(k)
account? He became my student and he has recouped his losses and his
401(k) plan is up (this occurred within two years). As of 2005, both investors
have portfolios that are beating the general market.

 Determining your investing style
R
ead this chapter carefully. Millions of investors are at risk because the
market sees as much misinvesting activity in stocks as it does investing. 
I know it sounds weird, but the situation is similar to your crazy Uncle Bill
punching the accelerator rather than the brakes when heading right toward
the Grand Canyon — he knows that he needs to do something, but he chooses
the wrong mechanism. Stocks are tools you can use to build your wealth.
When used wisely, for the right purpose, and in the right environment, they 
do a great job. But when improperly applied, they can lead to disaster.
In this chapter, I show you how to choose the right investments, based on
your short- and long-term financial goals. I also show you how to decide on
your purpose for investing (growth or income investing) and the style of
investing — conservative or aggressive — that you need to take.
Matching Stocks and Strategies 
with Your Goals
Various stocks are out there, as well as various investment approaches. The
key to success in the stock market is matching the right kind of stock with
the right kind of investment situation. You have to choose the stock and the
approach that match your goals. (Refer to Chapter 2 for more on defining
your financial goals.)

Before investing in a stock, ask yourself, “When do I want to reach my finan-
cial goal?” Stocks are a means to an end. Your job is to figure out what that
end is — or, more importantly, when it is. Do you want to retire in ten years
or next year? Must you pay for your kid’s college education next year or 18
years from now? The length of time you have before you need the money you
hope to earn from stock investing determines what stocks you should buy.
Table 3-1 gives you some guidelines for choosing the kind of stock best suited
for the type of investor you are and the goals you have.

Stocks are not suitable for the
short-term. Instead, look at
vehicles such as savings
accounts and money market
funds.
Dividends are payments made to an owner (unlike interest, which is payment
to a creditor). Dividends are a great form of income, and companies that
issue dividends tend to have more stable stock prices as well. For more infor-
mation on dividend-paying stocks, see the section “Investing for a Purpose,”
later in this chapter, and Chapter 9.
Table 3-1 gives you general guidelines, but keep in mind that not everyone
can fit into a particular profile. Every investor has a unique situation, set of
goals, and level of risk tolerance. Remember that the terms large-cap, mid
cap, and small-cap refer to the size (or market capitalization, also known as
market cap) of the company. All factors being equal, large companies are
safer (less risky) than small companies. For more on market caps, see the
section “Investing for Your Personal Style,” later in this chapter.

Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

Investing for the Future
Are your goals long term or short term? Answering this question is important
because individual stocks can be either great or horrible choices, depending
on the time period you want to focus on. Generally, the length of time you
plan to invest in stocks can be short term, intermediate term, or long term.
The following sections outline what kinds of stocks are most appropriate for
each term length.
Investing in stocks becomes less risky as the time frame lengthens. Stock
prices tend to fluctuate on a daily basis, but they have a tendency to trend up
or down over an extended period of time. Even if you invest in a stock that
goes down in the short term, you’re likely to see it rise and possibly go above
your investment if you have the patience to wait it out and let the stock price
appreciate.
Focusing on the short term
Short term generally means one year or less, although some people extend
the period to two years or less. You get the point.
Every person has short-term goals. Some are modest, such as setting aside
money for a vacation next month or paying for medical bills. Other short-
term goals are more ambitious, such as accruing funds for a down payment
to purchase a new home within six months. Whatever the expense or pur-
chase, you need a predictable accumulation of cash soon. If this sounds like
your situation, stay away from the stock market!
Because stocks can be so unpredictable in the short term, they’re a bad
choice for short-term considerations. I get a kick out of market analysts on
television saying things such as, “At $25 a share, XYZ is a solid investment,
and we feel that its stock should hit our target price of $40 within six to nine
months.” You know that an eager investor hears that and says, “Gee, why
bother with 3 percent at the bank when this stock will rise by more than 50
percent? I better call my broker.” It may hit that target amount (or surpass it),
or it may not. Most of the time, the stock doesn’t reach the target price, and
the investor is disappointed. The stock could even go down! The reason that
target prices are frequently (usually) missed is that the analyst is one person
and it’s difficult to figure out what millions of investors will do in the short-
term. The short-term can be irrational because so many investors have so
many reasons for buying and selling that it can be difficult to analyze. If you
want to use the money you invest for an important short-term need, you
could lose very important cash quicker than you think.
37
Chapter 3: Defining Common Approaches to Stock Investing

Short-term stock investing is very unpredictable. You can better serve your
short-term goals with stable, interest-bearing investments (like Certificates of
Deposit at your local bank).
During the raging-bull market (see more about bull markets in Chapter 15) of
the late 1990s, investors watched as some high-profile stocks went up 20 to
50 percent in a matter of months. Hey, who needs a savings account earning a
measly interest when stocks grow like that! Of course, when the bear market
hit from 2000 to 2003 and those same stocks fell 50 to 85 percent, a savings
account earning a measly interest rate suddenly didn’t seem so bad.
Stocks — even the best ones — fluctuate in the short term. In a negative envi-
ronment, they can be very volatile. No one can accurately predict the price
movement (unless you have some inside information), so stocks are defi-
nitely inappropriate for any financial goal that you need to reach within one
year. Check Table 3-1 for suggestions about your short-term strategies.
Considering intermediate-term goals
Intermediate term refers to your financial goals that you plan to reach within
five years. If, for example, you want to accumulate funds to put money down
for investment in real estate four years from now, some growth-oriented
investments may be suitable.
Although some stocks may be appropriate for a two- or three-year period, not
all stocks are good intermediate-term investments. Different types and cate-
gories of stocks exist. Some stocks are fairly stable and hold their value well,
such as the stock of much larger or established dividend-paying companies.
38
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Short-term investing = speculating
If you look at a period of a single year, stocks
have a mixed-performance record compared
with other investments, such as bonds or bank
investments. In 1999, big-company stocks grew
an average of 25 percent, and small-company
stocks averaged a blistering 50 to 70 percent,
but bank accounts and various bonds ranged
only from 1.5 to 7 percent. In the year 2000, the
picture was much different. Stock investors lost
their shirts, and conservative investors who put
their money in bank certificates of deposit and
treasury bonds watched their money grow.
The bottom line is that investing in stocks for the
short term is nothing more than speculating.
Your only possible strategy is luck.

Other stocks have prices that jump all over the place, such as the stocks of
untested companies that haven’t been in existence long enough to develop 
a consistent track record.
If you plan to invest in the stock market to meet intermediate-term goals, 
consider large, established companies or dividend-paying companies in
industries that provide the necessities of life (like food and beverage or 
electric utilities).
Preparing for the long term
Stock investing is best suited for making money over a long period of time.
When you measure stocks against other investments in terms of five to (prefer-
ably) ten or more years, they excel. Even investors who bought stocks during
the depths of the Great Depression saw profitable growth in their stock portfo-
lios over a ten-year period.
In fact, if you examine any ten-year period over the past 50 years, you see
that stocks beat out other financial investments (such as bonds or bank
investments) in almost every single ten-year period when measured by total
return (taking into account reinvesting and compounding of capital gains and
dividends)! Chapters 8 and 9 cover growth and income. As you can see, long-
term planning allows stocks to shine. Of course, your work doesn’t stop at
deciding on a long-term investment. You still have to do your homework and
choose stocks wisely because, even in good times, you can lose money if you
invest in companies that go out of business. Part III shows you how to evalu-
ate specific companies and industries and alerts you to factors in the general
economy that can affect stock behavior. Appendix A provides plenty of
resources you can turn to.
Because you can choose between many different types and categories of
stocks, virtually any investor with a long-term perspective should add stocks
to his investment portfolio. Whether you want to save for a young child’s col-
lege fund or for future retirement goals, carefully selected stocks have proven
to be a superior long-term investment.
Investing for a Purpose
When the lady was asked why she bungee jumped off the bridge that
spanned a massive ravine, she answered, “Because it’s fun!” When someone
asked the fellow why he dove into a pool that was chock-full of alligators and
39
Chapter 3: Defining Common Approaches to Stock Investing

snakes, he responded, “Because someone pushed me.” Your investment in
stocks shouldn’t happen unless you have a purpose that you understand, like
investing for growth or investing for income. Even if an advisor pushes you to
invest, be sure that your advisor gives you an explanation of how that stock
choice fits your purpose.
I know of a very nice, elderly lady who had a portfolio brimming with aggres-
sive-growth stocks because she had an overbearing broker. Her purpose
should’ve been conservative, and she should’ve chosen investments that
would preserve her wealth rather than grow it. Obviously, the broker’s
agenda got in the way. Stocks are just a means to an end. Figure out your
desired end and then match the means. To find out more about dealing with
brokers, go to Chapter 7.
Making loads of money quickly: 
Growth investing
When investors want their money to grow, they look for investments that
appreciate in value. Appreciate is just another way of saying “grow.” If you
have a stock that you bought for $8 per share and now its value is $30 per
share, your investment has grown by $22 per share — that’s appreciation. I
know I would appreciate it.
Appreciation (also known as capital gain) is probably the number one reason
why people invest in stocks. Few investments have the potential to grow your
wealth as conveniently as stocks. If you want the stock market to make you
loads of money relatively quickly (and you can assume some risk), head to
Chapter 8, which takes an in-depth look at investing for growth.
Stocks are a great way to grow your wealth, but they’re not the only way.
Many investors seek alternative ways to make money, but many of these
alternative ways are more aggressive and carry significantly more risk. You
may have heard about people who made quick fortunes in areas such as com-
modities (like wheat, pork bellies, or precious metals), options, and other
more sophisticated investment vehicles. Keep in mind that you should limit
risky investments to only a portion of your portfolio, such as 10 percent of
your investable funds. Experienced investors, however, can go as high as 20
percent. Chapter 8 goes into greater detail about growth investing.
Steadily making money: Income investing
Not all investors want to take on the risk that comes with making a killing.
(Hey . . . no guts, no glory!) Some people just want to invest in the stock
40
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

market as a means of providing a steady income. They don’t need stock
values to go through the ceiling. Instead, they need stocks that perform well
consistently.
If your purpose for investing in stocks is to create income, you need to
choose stocks that pay dividends. Dividends are typically paid quarterly to
stockholders on record.
Distinguishing between dividends and interest
Don’t confuse dividends with interest. Most people are familiar with interest,
because that’s how you grow your money over the years in the bank. The
important difference is that interest is paid to creditors, and dividends are
paid to owners (meaning shareholders — and if you own stock, you’re a share-
holder, because stocks represent shares in a publicly traded company).
When you buy stock, you buy a piece of that company. When you put money
in a bank (or when you buy bonds), you basically loan your money. You
become a creditor, and the bank or bond issuer is the debtor, and as such, it
must eventually pay your money back to you with interest.
Recognizing the importance of an income stock’s yield
Investing for income means that you have to consider your investment’s
yield. If you want income from a stock investment, you must compare the
yield from that particular stock with alternatives. Looking at the yield is a
way to compare the income you expect to receive from one investment with
the expected income from others. Table 3-2 shows some comparative yields.

To understand how to calculate yield, you need the following formula:
Yield = Payout ÷ Investment Amount
41
Chapter 3: Defining Common Approaches to Stock Investing

Yield enables you to compare how much income you would get for a prospec-
tive investment compared with the income you would get from other invest-
ments. For the sake of simplicity, this exercise is based on an annual
percentage yield basis (compounding would increase the yield).
Jones Co. and Smith Co. are both typical dividend-paying stocks, and in the
example presented by Table 3-2, presume that both companies are similar in
most respects except for their differing dividends. How can you tell whether
a $50 stock with a $2.50 annual dividend is better (or worse) than a $100
stock with a $4.00 dividend? The yield tells you.
Even though Jones Co. pays a higher dividend ($4.00), Smith Co. has a higher
yield (5 percent). Therefore, if you had to choose between those two stocks
as an income investor, you would choose Smith Co. Of course, if you truly
want to maximize your income and don’t really need your investment to
appreciate a lot, you should probably choose Brown Co.’s bond because it
offers a yield of 6 percent.
Dividend-paying stocks do have the ability to increase in value. They may not
have the same growth potential as growth stocks, but, at the very least, they
have a greater potential for capital gain than bank CDs or bonds. Dividend-
paying stocks (investing for income) are covered in Chapter 9.
Investing for Your Personal Style
Your investing style isn’t a blue-jeans-versus-three-piece-suit debate. It refers
to your approach to stock investing. Do you want to be conservative or
aggressive? Would you rather be the tortoise or the hare? Your investment
personality greatly depends on your purpose and the term over which you’re
planning to invest (see the previous two sections in this chapter). The follow-
ing sections outline the two most general investment styles.
Conservative investing
Conservative investing means that you put your money in something proven,
tried, and true. You invest your money in safe and secure places, such as
banks and government-backed securities. But how does that apply to stocks?
(Table 3-1 gives you suggestions.)
Conservative stock investors want to place their money in companies that
have exhibited some of the following qualities:
 Proven performance: You want companies that have shown increasing
sales and earnings year after year. You don’t demand anything spectacu-
lar, just a strong and steady performance.
42
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

 Market size: Companies should be large-cap (short for large capitaliza-
tion). In other words, they should have a market value exceeding $10 bil-
lion. Conservative investors surmise that bigger is safer.
 Market leadership: Companies should be leaders in their industries.
 Perceived staying power: You want companies with the financial clout
and market position to weather uncertain market and economic condi-
tions. It shouldn’t matter what happens in the economy or who gets
elected.
As a conservative investor, you don’t mind if the companies’ share prices
jump (who would?), but you’re more concerned with steady growth over the
long term.
Aggressive investing
Aggressive investors can plan long term or look only over the intermediate
term, but in any case, they want stocks that resemble jack rabbits — they
show the potential to break out of the pack.
Aggressive stock investors want to invest their money in companies that
have exhibited some of the following qualities:
 Great potential: The company must have superior goods, services,
ideas, or ways of doing business compared to the competition.
 Capital gains possibility: You don’t even consider dividends. If anything,
you dislike dividends. You feel that the money that would’ve been dis-
pensed in dividend form is better reinvested in the company. This, in
turn, can spur greater growth.
 Innovation: Companies should have technologies, ideas, or innovative
methods that make them stand apart from other companies.
Aggressive investors usually seek out small capitalization stocks, known as
small-caps, because they have plenty of potential for growth. Take the tree
example, for instance: A giant redwood may be strong, but it may not grow
much more, whereas a brand-new sapling has plenty of growth to look for-
ward to. Why invest in stodgy, big companies when you can invest in smaller
enterprises that may become the leaders of tomorrow? Aggressive investors
have no problem investing in obscure companies because they hope that
such companies will become another IBM or McDonald’s. Find out more
about growth investing in Chapter 8.

Recognizing the Risks
In This Chapter
 Considering the types of risk
 Taking steps to reduce your risk
 Balancing risk against return
I
nvestors face many risks, many of which I cover in this chapter. The sim-
plest definition of risk for investors is “the possibility that your investment
will lose some (or all) of its value.” Yet you don’t have to fear risk if you
understand and plan for it. You need to get familiar with the concept of risk.
You must understand the oldest equation in the world of investing — risk
versus return. This equation states the following:
If you want a greater return on your money, you need to tolerate more
risk. If you don’t want to tolerate more risk, you must tolerate a lower
rate of return.
This point about risk is best illustrated from a moment in one of my investment
seminars. One of the attendees told me that he had his money in the bank but
was dissatisfied with the rate of return. He lamented, “The yield on my money
is pitiful! I want to put my money somewhere where it can grow.” I asked him,
“How about investing in common stocks? Or what about growth mutual funds?
They have a solid, long-term growth track record.” He responded, “Stocks? I
don’t want to put my money there. It’s too risky!” Okay, then. If you don’t want
to tolerate more risk, then don’t complain about earning less on your money.
Risk (in all its forms) has a bearing on all your money concerns and goals.
That’s why it’s so important that you understand risk before you invest.
This man — as well as the rest of us — needs to remember that risk is not a
four-letter word. Well, it is a four-letter word, but you know what I mean. Risk
is present no matter what you do with your money. Even if you simply stick
your money in your mattress, risk is involved — several kinds of risk, in fact.

You have the risk of fire. What if your house burns down? You have the risk of
theft. What if burglars find your stash of cash? You also have relative risk. (In
other words, what if your relatives find your money?)
Be aware of the different kinds of risk, and you can easily plan around them
to keep your money growing.
Exploring Different Kinds of Risk
Think about all the ways that an investment can lose money. You can list 
all sorts of possibilities. So many that you may think, “Holy cow! Why invest
at all?”
Don’t let risk frighten you. After all, life itself is risky. Just make sure that you
understand the different kinds of risk before you start navigating the invest-
ment world. Be mindful of risk and find out about the effects of risk on your
investments and personal financial goals.
Financial risk
The financial risk of stock investing is that you can lose your money if the
company whose stock you purchase loses money or goes belly up. This type
of risk is the most obvious because companies do go bankrupt.
You can greatly enhance the chances of your financial risk paying off by doing
an adequate amount of research and choosing your stocks carefully (which
this book helps you do — see Part III for more details). Financial risk is a real
concern even when the economy is doing well. Some diligent research, a little
planning, and a dose of common sense help you reduce your financial risk.
In the stock investing mania of the late 1990s, millions of investors (along
with many well-known investment “gurus”) ignored some obvious financial
risks of many then-popular stocks. Investors blindly plunked their money
into stocks that were bad choices. Consider investors who put their money in
DrKoop.com, a health information Web site, in 1999 and held on during 2000.
DrKoop.com went into cardiac arrest as it collapsed from $45 per share to $2
per share by mid-2000. By the time the stock was DOA, investors lost mil-
lions. RIP (risky investment play!).
Internet and tech stocks littered the graveyard of stock market catastrophes
during 2000–2001 because investors didn’t see (or didn’t want to see?) the
risks involved with companies that didn’t offer a solid record of results (prof-
its, sales, and so on). Remember that when you invest in companies that
don’t have a proven track record, you’re not investing, you’re speculating.
46
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

Investors who did their homework regarding the financial conditions of com-
panies such as the Internet stocks discovered that these companies had the
hallmarks of financial risk — high debt, low (or no) earnings, and plenty of
competition. They steered clear, avoiding tremendous financial loss.
Investors who didn’t do their homework were lured by the status of these
companies — the poster children of booming Internet fortunes — and lost
their shirts.
Of course, the individual investors who lost money by investing in these
trendy, high-profile companies don’t deserve all the responsibility for their
tremendous financial losses; some high-profile analysts and media sources
also should have known better. The late 1990s may someday be a case study
of how euphoria and the herd mentality (rather than good, old-fashioned
research and common sense) ruled the day (temporarily). The excitement of
making potential fortunes gets the best of people sometimes, and they throw
caution to the wind. Historians may look back at those days and say, “What
were they thinking?” Achieving true wealth takes diligent work and careful
analysis.
In terms of financial risk, the bottom line is . . . well . . . the bottom line! A
healthy bottom line means that a company is making money. And if a com-
pany is making money, then you can make money by investing in its stock.
However, if a company isn’t making money, you won’t make money if you
invest in it. Profit is the lifeblood of any company. (Are you listening, Dr.
Koop?)
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk may sound like an odd type of risk, but in fact, it’s a
common consideration for investors. Be aware that interest rates change on
a regular basis, causing some challenging moments. Banks set interest rates,
and the primary institution to watch closely is the Federal Reserve (the Fed),
which is, in effect, the country’s central bank. The Fed raises or lowers inter-
est rates, actions that, in turn, cause banks to raise or lower interest rates
accordingly. Interest rate changes affect consumers, businesses, and, of
course, investors.
The scenario outlined in the following paragraphs gives you a generic 
introduction to the way fluctuating interest rate risk can affect investors 
in general.
Suppose that you buy a long-term, high-quality corporate bond and get a
yield of 6 percent. Your money is safe, and your return is locked in at 6 per-
cent. Whew! That’s a guaranteed 6 percent. Not bad, huh? But what happens
if, after you commit your money, interest rates increase to 8 percent? You
lose the opportunity to get that extra 2 percent interest. The only way to get
out of your 6 percent bond is to sell it at current market values and use the
money to reinvest at the higher rate.
47
Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks

The only problem with this scenario is that the 6 percent bond is likely to
drop in value because interest rates rose. Why? Say that the investor is Bob
and the bond yielding 6 percent is a corporate bond issued by Lucin-Muny
(LM). According to the bond agreement, LM must pay 6 percent (called the
“face rate” or “nominal rate”) during the life of the bond and then, upon
maturity, pay the principal. If Bob buys $10,000 of LM bonds on the day they
are issued, he gets $600 (of interest) every year for as long as he holds the
bonds. If he holds on until maturity, he gets back his $10,000 (the principal).
So far so good, right? The plot thickens, however.
Say that he decides to sell the bond long before maturity and that, at the time
of the sale, interest rates in the market have risen to 8 percent. Now what? The
reality is that no one is going to want his 6 percent bond if the market is offer-
ing bonds at 8 percent. What’s Bob to do? He can’t change the face rate of 6
percent, and he can’t change the fact that only $600 is paid each year for the
life of the bond. What has to change so that current investors get the equivalent
yield of 8 percent? If you said, “The bond’s value has to go down,” . . . bingo! In
this example, the bond’s market value needs to drop to $7,500 so that investors
buying the bond get an equivalent yield of 8 percent. (For simplicity sake, I left
out the time it takes for the bond to mature.) Here’s how that figures:
New investors still get $600 annually. However, $600 is equal to 8 percent of
$7,500. Therefore, even though investors get the face rate of 6 percent, they
get a yield of 8 percent because the actual investment amount is $7,500. In
this example, no financial risk is present, but you see how interest rate risk
presents itself. Bob finds out that you can have a good company with a good
bond, yet you still lose $2,500 because of the change in the interest rate. Of
course, if Bob doesn’t sell, he doesn’t realize that loss. (For more on when to
sell, see Chapter 17.)
You can lose money in an apparently sound investment because of something
that sounds as harmless as “interest rates have changed.”
Understanding the adverse effects 
of rising interest rates
Rising and falling interest rates offer a special risk to stock investors.
Historically, rising interest rates have had an adverse effect on stock 
prices. I outline several reasons why in the following sections.
Hurting a company’s financial condition
Rising interest rates have a negative impact on companies that carry a large
current debt load or that need to take on more debt because when interest
rates rise, the cost of borrowing money rises, too. Ultimately, the company’s
profitability and ability to grow are reduced. When a company’s profits (or
earnings) drop, its stock becomes less desirable, and its stock price falls.
48
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

Affecting a company’s customers
A company’s success comes when it sells its products or services. But what
happens if increased interest rates negatively impact its customers (specifi-
cally, other companies that buy from it)? The financial health of its customers
directly affects the company’s ability to grow sales and earnings.
For a good example of this situation, consider what happened to Cisco
Systems in 2000. Because a huge part of its sales went to the telecommunica-
tions industry, Cisco’s profitability depended on the health of that entire
industry. The telecom industry’s debt ballooned to $700 billion. This debt
became the telecom industry’s financial Achilles heel, which, in turn, became
a pain in the neck to Cisco. Because telecom companies bought less (espe-
cially from Cisco), Cisco’s profits shrank. From March 2000 to March 2001,
Cisco’s stock fell by nearly 70 percent! As of September 2001, Cisco’s stock
price continued to decline because the companies that were Cisco’s cus-
tomers were hurting financially.
Impacting investors’ decision-making considerations
When interest rates rise, investors start to rethink their investment strate-
gies, resulting in one of two outcomes:
 Investors may sell any shares in interest-sensitive stocks that they hold.
Interest-sensitive industries include electric utilities, real estate, and the
financial sector. Although increased interest rates can hurt these sec-
tors, the reverse is also generally true: Falling interest rates boost the
same industries. Keep in mind that interest rate changes affect some
industries more than others.
 Investors who favor increased current income (versus waiting for the
investment to grow in value to sell for a gain later on) are definitely
attracted to investment vehicles that offer a higher rate of return. Higher
interest rates can cause investors to switch from stocks to bonds or
bank certificates of deposit.
Hurting stock prices indirectly
High or rising interest rates can have a negative impact on any investor’s
total financial picture. What happens when an investor struggles with bur-
densome debt, such as a second mortgage, credit card debt, or margin debt
(debt from borrowing against stock in a brokerage account)? He may sell
some stock in order to pay off some of his high-interest debt. Selling stock to
service debt is a common practice that, when taken collectively, can hurt
stock prices.
As this book goes to press, the stock market and the U.S. economy face per-
haps the greatest challenge since the Great Depression — debt. In terms of
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the size of the economy is about $11.5 trillion
(give or take $100 billion), but the debt level is about $37 trillion. This already
enormous amount does not include $44 trillion of liabilities such as Social
49
Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks

Security and Medicare. Additionally (Yikes! There’s more?!), some of our
financial institutions hold over $50 trillion worth of derivatives. These can be
very complicated and sophisticated investment vehicles that can backfire.
Derivatives have, in fact, sunk some large organizations (such as Enron), and
investors should be aware of them. Just check out the company’s financial
reports. (Find out more in Chapter 11.)
Because of the effects of interest rates on stock portfolios, both direct and indi-
rect, successful investors regularly monitor interest rates in both the general
economy and in their personal situations. Although stocks have proven to be a
superior long-term investment (the longer the term, the better), every investor
should maintain a balanced portfolio that includes other investment vehicles,
such as money market funds, savings bonds, and/or bank investments.
A diversified investor has some money in vehicles that do well when interest
rates rise. These vehicles include money market funds, U.S. savings bonds
(EE), and other variable-rate investments whose interest rates rise when
market rates rise. These types of investments add a measure of safety from
interest rate risk to your stock portfolio.
Market risk
People talk about the market and how it goes up or down, making it sound 
like a monolithic entity instead of what it really is — a group of millions of 
individuals making daily decisions to buy or sell stock. No matter how modern
our society and economic system, you can’t escape the laws of supply and
demand. When masses of people want to buy a particular stock, it becomes 
in demand, and its price rises. That price rises higher if the supply is limited.
Conversely, if no one’s interested in buying a stock, its price falls. Supply and
demand is the nature of market risk. The price of the stock you purchase can
rise and fall on the fickle whim of market demand.
Millions of investors buying and selling each minute of every trading day
affect the share price of your stock. This fact makes it impossible to judge
which way your stock will move tomorrow or next week. This unpredictabil-
ity and seeming irrationality is why stocks aren’t appropriate for short-term
financial growth.
In April 2001, a news program reported that in 2000, a fellow with $80,000 in
the bank decided to take his money and invest it in the stock market. Because
he was getting married in 2001, he wanted his money to grow faster and
higher so that he could afford a nice wedding and a down payment on the
couple’s future home. What happened? His money shrank to $11,000, and he
had to change his plans. Sometimes, “market risk” begets “romantic” risk.
Losing money is only one headache you face when you lose money this way;
the idea of postponing a joyful event, such as a wedding or a home purchase,
50
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

just adds to the pain. The gent in the preceding story could have easily mini-
mized his losses with some knowledge and discipline.
Markets are volatile by nature; they go up and down, and investments need
time to grow. This poor guy (literally, now) should have been aware of the
fact that stocks in general aren’t suitable for short-term (one year or less)
goals (see Chapter 2 for more on short-term goals). Despite the fact that the
companies he invested in may have been fundamentally sound, all stock
prices are subject to the gyrations of the marketplace and need time to trend
upward.
Investing requires diligent work and research before putting your money in
quality investments with a long-term perspective. Speculating is attempting
to make a relatively quick profit by monitoring the short-term price move-
ments of a particular investment. Investors seek to minimize risk, whereas
speculators don’t mind risk because it can also magnify profits. Speculating
and investing have clear differences, but investors frequently become specu-
lators and ultimately put themselves and their wealth at risk. Don’t go there!
Consider the married couple nearing retirement who decided to play with
their money to see about making their pending retirement more comfortable.
They borrowed a sizable sum by tapping into their home equity to invest in
the stock market. (Their home, which they had paid off, had enough equity to
qualify for this loan.) What did they do with these funds? You guessed it; they
invested in the high-flying stocks of the day, which were high-tech and
Internet stocks. Within eight months, they lost almost all their money.
Understanding market risk is especially important for people who are
tempted to put their nest eggs or emergency funds into volatile investments
such as growth stocks (or mutual funds that invest in growth stocks or simi-
lar aggressive investment vehicles). Remember, you can lose everything.
Inflation risk
Inflation is the artificial expansion of the quantity of money so that too much
money is used in exchange for goods and services. To consumers, inflation
shows up in the form of higher prices for goods and services. Inflation risk is
also referred to as purchasing power risk. This term just means that your
money doesn’t buy as much as it used to. For example, a dollar that bought
you a sandwich in 1980 barely bought you a candy bar a few years later. For
you, the investor, this risk means that the value of your investment (a bond,
for example) may not keep up with inflation.
Say that you have money in a bank savings account currently earning 4 per-
cent. This account has flexibility — if the market interest rate goes up, the
rate you earn in your account goes up. Your account is safe from both finan-
cial risk and interest rate risk. But what if inflation is running at 5 percent? At
that point you’re losing money.
51
Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks

Tax risk
Taxes (such as income tax or capital gains tax) don’t affect your stock invest-
ment directly. Taxes can obviously affect how much of your money you get to
keep. Because the entire point of stock investing is to build wealth, you need
to understand that taxes take away a portion of the wealth that you’re trying
to build. Taxes can be risky because if you make the wrong move with your
stocks (selling them at the wrong time, for example), you can end up paying
higher taxes than you need to. Because tax laws change so frequently, tax
risk is part of the risk-versus-return equation, as well.
It pays to gain knowledge about how taxes can impact your wealth-building
program before you make your investment decisions. Chapter 20 covers in
greater detail the impact of taxes.
Political and governmental risks
If companies were fish, politics and government policies (such as taxes, laws,
and regulations) would be the pond. In the same way that fish die in a toxic
or polluted pond, politics and government policies can kill companies. Of
course, if you own stock in a company exposed to political and governmental
risks, you need to be aware of these risks. For some companies, a single new
regulation or law is enough to send them into bankruptcy. For other compa-
nies, a new law could help them increase sales and profits.
What if you invest in companies or industries that become political targets?
You may want to consider selling them (you can always buy them back later)
or consider putting in stop loss orders on the stock (see Chapter 17). For
example, tobacco companies were the targets of political firestorms that bat-
tered their stock prices. Whether you agree or disagree with the political
machinations of today is not the issue. As an investor, you have to ask your-
self, “How do politics affect the market value and the current and future
prospects of my chosen investment?” (See Chapter 14 for more on how poli-
tics can affect the stock market.)
Personal risks
Frequently, the risk involved with investing in the stock market may not be
directly involved with the investment or factors directly related to the invest-
ment; sometimes the risk is with the investor’s circumstances.
Suppose that investor Ralph puts $15,000 into a portfolio of common stocks.
Imagine that the market experiences a drop in prices that week and Ralph’s
stocks drop to a market value of $14,000.
52
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

Because stocks are good for the long term, this type of decrease is usually
not an alarming incident. Odds are that this dip is temporary, especially if
Ralph carefully chose high-quality companies. Incidentally, if a portfolio of
high-quality stocks does experience a temporary drop in price, it can be a
great opportunity to get more shares at a good price. (Chapter 17 covers
orders you can place with your broker to help you do that.)
Over the long term, Ralph would probably see the value of his investment
grow substantially. But, what if during a period when his stocks are declining,
Ralph experiences financial difficulty and needs quick cash? He may have to
sell his stock to get some money.
This problem occurs frequently for investors who don’t have an emergency
fund or a rainy day fund to handle large, sudden expenses. You never know
when your company may lay you off or when your basement may flood, leav-
ing you with a huge repair bill. Car accidents, medical emergencies, and other
unforeseen events are part of life’s bag of surprises — for anyone. Be sure to
set money aside for sudden expenses before you buy stocks. Then you aren’t
forced to prematurely liquidate your stock investments to pay emergency bills
(Chapter 2 provides more guidance on having liquid assets for emergencies).
You probably won’t get much comfort from knowing that stock losses are tax
deductible — a loss is a loss (see Chapter 20 regarding taxes). However, you
can avoid the kind of loss that results from prematurely having to sell your
stocks if you maintain an emergency cash fund. A good place for your emer-
gency cash fund is in either a bank savings account or a money market fund.
Emotional risk
What does emotional risk have to do with stocks? Emotions are important
risk considerations because the main decision makers are human beings.
Logic and discipline are critical factors in investment success, but even the
best investor can let emotions take over the reins of money management and
cause loss. For stock investing, you’re likely to be sidetracked by three main
emotions: greed, fear, and love. You need to understand your emotions and
what kinds of risk they can expose you to. If you get too attached to a sinking
stock, then you don’t need a stock investing book — you need Dr. Phil!
Paying the price for greed
In the 1998–2000 period, millions of investors threw caution to the wind and
chased highly dubious, risky dot-com stocks. The dollar signs popped up in
their eyes (just like slot machines) when they saw that easy street was lined
with dot-com stocks that were doubling and tripling in a very short time.
Who cares about price/earnings (P/E) ratios and earnings when you can just
buy stock, make a fortune, and get out with millions? (Of course, you care
about making money with stocks, so you can flip to Chapter 10 and Appendix
B to find out more about P/E ratios.)
53
Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks

Unfortunately, the lure of the easy buck can easily turn healthy attitudes
about growing wealth into unhealthy greed that blinds investors and discards
common sense (such as investing for quick short-term gains in dubious “hot
stocks,” rather than doing your homework and buying stocks of solid compa-
nies with strong fundamentals and a long-term focus).
Recognizing the role of fear
Greed can be a problem, but fear is the other extreme. People who are fearful
of loss frequently avoid suitable investments and end up settling for a low
rate of return. If you have to succumb to one of these emotions, at least fear
exposes you to less loss.
Looking for love in all the wrong places
Stocks are dispassionate, inanimate vehicles, but people can look for love in
the strangest places. Emotional risk occurs when investors fall in love with a
stock and refuse to sell it even when the stock is plummeting and shows all
the symptoms of getting worse. Emotional risk also occurs when investors
are drawn to bad investment choices just because they sound good, are pop-
ular, or are pushed by family or friends. Love and attachment are great in
relationships with people, but can be horrible with investments.

Investment lessons from September 11
September 11, 2001, was a horrific day that is
burned in our minds and won’t be forgotten in
our lifetime. The acts of terrorism that day took
over 3,000 lives and caused untold pain and
grief. A much less important aftereffect was the
hard lessons that investors learned that day.
Terrorism reminds us that risk is more real than
ever and that we should never let our guard
down. What lessons can investors learn from
the worst acts of terrorism to ever happen on
U.S. soil? Here are a few pointers:
 Diversify your portfolio.Of course, the events
of September 11 were certainly surreal and
unexpected. But before the events occurred,
investors should have made it a habit to
assess their situations and see whether they
had any vulnerabilities. Stock investors with
no money outside the stock market are
always more at risk. Keeping your portfolio
diversified is a time-tested strategy that is
more relevant than ever before.
 Review and re-allocate. September 11 trig-
gered declines in the overall market, but spe-
cific industries, such as airlines and hotels,
were hit particularly hard. In addition, some
industries, such as defense and food, saw
stock prices rise. Monitor your portfolio and
ask yourself whether it is overly reliant on or
exposed to events in specific sectors. If so,
reallocate your investments to decrease
your risk exposure.
 Check for signs of trouble. Techniques such
as trailing stops (which I explain in Chapter
17) come in very handy when your stocks
plummet because of unexpected events.
Even if you don’t use these techniques, you
can make it a regular habit to analyze your
stocks and check for signs of trouble, such
as debts or P/E ratios that are too high. If you
see signs of trouble (check out Chapter 21),
consider selling anyway.

Minimizing Your Risk
Now, before you go crazy thinking that stock investing carries so much risk
that you may as well not get out of bed, take a breath. Minimizing your risk in
stock investing is easier than you think. Although wealth building through the
stock market doesn’t take place without some amount of risk, you can prac-
tice the following tips to maximize your profits and still keep your money
secure.
Gaining knowledge
Some people spend more time analyzing a restaurant menu to choose a $10
entrée than analyzing where to put their next $5,000. Lack of knowledge con-
stitutes the greatest risk for new investors, but diminishing that risk starts
with gaining knowledge. The more familiar you are with the stock market —
how it works, factors that affect stock value, and so on — the better you can
navigate around its pitfalls and maximize your profits. The same knowledge
that enables you to grow your wealth also enables you to minimize your risk.
Before you put your money anywhere, you want to know as much as you can.
This book is a great place to start — check out Chapter 6 for a rundown of the
kinds of information you want to know before you buy stocks, as well as the
resources that can give you the information you need to invest successfully.
Staying out . . . for now
If you don’t understand stocks, don’t invest! Yeah, I know this book is about
stock investing, and I think that some measure of stock investing is a good
idea for most people. But that doesn’t mean you should be 100 percent
invested 100 percent of the time. If you don’t understand a particular stock
(or don’t understand stocks, period), stay away until you do understand.
Instead, give yourself an imaginary sum of money, such as $100,000, give
yourself reasons to invest, and just make believe. Pick a few stocks that you
think will increase in value and then track them for a while and see how they
perform. Begin to understand how the price of a stock goes up and down,
and watch what happens to the stocks you chose when various events take
place. As you find out more and more about stock investing, you get better
and better at picking individual stocks, and you haven’t risked — or lost —
any money during your learning period. A good place to do your “imaginary”
investing is at Web sites such as Marketocracy (www.marketocracy.com).
You can design a stock portfolio and track its performance with thousands of
other investors to see how well you do.

Getting your financial house in order
Advice on what to do before you invest could be a whole book all by itself.
The bottom line is that you want to make sure that you are, first and fore-
most, financially secure before you take the plunge into the stock market. If
you’re not sure about your financial security, look over your situation with a
financial planner. (You can find more on financial planners in Appendix A.)
Before you buy your first stock, here are a few things you can do to get your
finances in order:
 Have a cushion of money. Set aside three to six months’ worth of your
gross living expenses somewhere safe, such as in a bank account or 
treasury money market fund, in case you suddenly need cash for an
emergency.
 Reduce your debt. Overindulging in debt was the worst personal eco-
nomic problem for many Americans in the late 1990s. The year 2001 
was a record year for bankruptcy, with nearly 1.5 million people filing 
for bankruptcy.
 Make sure that your job is as secure as you can make it. Are you keep-
ing your skills up to date? Is the company you work for strong and grow-
ing? Is the industry that you work in strong and growing?
 Make sure that you have adequate insurance. You need enough insur-
ance to cover you and your family’s needs in case of illness, death, dis-
ability, and so on.
Diversifying your investments
Diversification is a strategy for reducing risk by spreading your money across
different investments. It’s a fancy way of saying, “Don’t put all your eggs in
one basket.” But how do you go about divvying up your money and distribut-
ing it among different investments? The easiest way to understand proper
diversification may be to look at what you should not do:
 Don’t put all your money in just one stock. Sure, if you choose wisely
and select a hot stock, you may make a bundle, but the odds are tremen-
dously against you. Unless you’re a real expert on a particular company,
it’s a good idea to have small portions of your money in several different
stocks. As a general rule, the money you tie up in a single stock should
be money you can do without.
 Don’t put all your money in one industry. I know people who own sev-
eral stocks, but the stocks are all in the same industry. Again, if you’re
an expert in that particular industry, it could work out. But just under-
stand that you’re not properly diversified. If a problem hits an entire
industry, you may get hurt.
56
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

 Don’t put all your money in just one type of investment. Stocks may be
a great investment, but you need to have money elsewhere. Bonds, bank
accounts, treasury securities, real estate, and precious metals are peren-
nial alternatives to complement your stock portfolio. Some of these alter-
natives can be found in mutual funds or exchange traded funds (ETFs).
Okay, now that you know what you shouldn’t do, what should you do? Until
you become more knowledgeable, follow this advice:
 Only keep 20 percent (or less) of your investment money in a single
stock.
 Invest in four or five different stocks that are in different industries.
Which industries? Choose industries that offer products and services
that have shown strong, growing demand. To make this decision, use
your common sense (which isn’t as common as it used to be). Think
about the industries that people need no matter what happens in the
general economy, such as food, energy, and other consumer necessities.
See Chapter 12 for more information about analyzing industries.
Weighing Risk Against Return
How much risk is appropriate for you, and how do you handle it? Before you
try to figure out what risks accompany your investment choices, analyze
yourself. Here are some points to keep in mind when weighing risk versus
return in your situation:
 Your financial goal: In five minutes with a financial calculator, you can
easily see how much money you’re going to need to become financially
independent (presuming that financial independence is your goal). Say
that you need $500,000 in ten years for a worry-free retirement and that
your financial assets (such as stocks, bonds, and so on) are currently
worth $400,000. In this scenario, your assets need to grow by only 2.25
percent to hit your target. Getting investments that grow by 2.25 percent
safely is easy to do because that is a relatively low rate of return.
The important point is that you don’t have to knock yourself out trying
to double your money with risky, high-flying investments; some run-of-
the-mill bank investments will do just fine. All too often, investors take
on more risk than is necessary. Figure out what your financial goal is so
that you know what kind of return you realistically need.
 Your investor profile: Are you nearing retirement, or are you fresh out
of college? Your life situation matters when it comes to looking at risk
versus return. If you’re just beginning your working years, you can cer-
tainly tolerate greater risk than someone facing retirement. Even if you
lose big time, you still have a long time to recoup your money and get
back on track. However, if you’re approaching retirement, risky or
57
Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks

aggressive investments can do much more harm than good. If you lose
money, you don’t have as much time to recoup your investment, and the
odds are that you’ll need the investment money (and its income-generat-
ing capacity) to cover your living expenses after you are no longer
employed.
 Asset allocation: I never tell retirees to put a large portion of their retire-
ment money into a high-tech stock or other volatile investment. But if
they still want to speculate, I don’t see a problem as long as they limit
such investments to 5 percent of their total assets. As long as the bulk of
their money is safe and sound in secure investments (such as U.S. trea-
sury bonds), I know I can sleep well (knowing that they can sleep well!).
Asset allocation beckons back to diversification. For people in their 20s
and 30s, having 75 percent of their money in a diversified portfolio of
growth stocks (such as mid-cap and small-cap stocks) is acceptable. For
people in their 60s and 70s, it’s not acceptable. They may, instead, con-
sider investing no more than 20 percent of their money in stocks (mid-
caps and large-caps are preferable). Check with your financial advisor to
find the right mix for your particular situation.

Better luck next time
A little knowledge can be very risky. Consider
the true story of one “lucky” fellow who played
the California lottery in 1987. He discovered that
he had a winning ticket, with the first prize of
$412,000. He immediately ordered a Porsche,
booked a lavish trip to Hawaii for his family, and
treated his wife and friends to a champagne
dinner at a posh Hollywood restaurant. When
he finally went to collect his prize, he found out
that he had to share first prize with over 9,000
other lottery players who also had the same
winning numbers. His share of the prize was
actually only $45! Hopefully, he invested that
tidy sum based on his increased knowledge
about risk.

 Defining index basics
 Looking at the Dow and other indexes
 Exploring the indexes for practical use
“H
ow’s the market doing today?” is the most common question that
interested parties ask about the stock market. “What did the Dow
do?” “How about Nasdaq?” Invariably, people asking those questions expect
an answer regarding how well the market has performed that day. “Well, the
Dow fell 57 points to 9,500, while Nasdaq was unchanged at 1,882.” You can
use indexes as general gauges of stock market activity. From them, you get a
basic idea of how well (or how poorly) the overall market is doing. In this
chapter, I focus my attention on stock market indexes.
Knowing How Indexes Are Measured
An index is a statistical measure that represents the value of a batch of
stocks. Investors use this measure like a barometer to track the overall
progress of the market (or a segment of it).
The oldest stock market index is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA or
simply “The Dow”). In 1896, Charles Dow (of Dow Jones fame) created the
Dow Jones Industrial Average; it covered only 12 stocks then (the number
increased to 30 stocks in 1928, and it remains the same to this day). Because
Dow worked long before the age of computers, he kept calculating a stock
market index simple and did it arithmetically by hand. Dow added up the
stock prices of the 12 companies and then divided the sum by 12.
Technically, this number is an average and not an index (hence the word
“average” in the name). For simplicity sake, we’ll refer to it as an index.

Nowadays, the number gets tweaked to also account for things such as stock
splits. (For more on stock splits see Chapter 19.)
However, indexes get calculated differently. The primary difference between
an “index” and an “average” is the concept of weighting. Weighting is the rela-
tive importance of the items when they are computed within the index.
Several kinds of indexes exist, including:
 Price-weighted index: This kind of index tracks changes based on the
change in the individual stock’s price per share.
To give you an example, suppose that you own two stocks: Stock A worth
$20 per share and Stock B worth $40 per share. A price-weighted index
allocates a greater proportion of the index to the stock at $40 than to the
one at $20. Therefore, if we had only these two stocks in an index, the
index number would reflect the $40 stock as being 67 percent (two-thirds
of the number), while the $20 stock would be 33 percent (one-third of the
number).
 Market-value weighted index: This kind of index tracks the proportion
of a stock based on its market capitalization (or market value, also
called market cap).
Say that in your portfolio, you have 10 million shares of a $20 stock
(Stock A) and 1 million shares of a $40 stock (Stock B). Stock A’s market
cap is $200 million, while Stock B’s market cap is $40 million. Therefore,
in a market-value weighted index, Stock A represents 83 percent of the
index’s value because of its much larger market cap.
 Broad-based index: The sample portfolios in the preceding bullets show
only two stocks — obviously not a good representative index. Most
investing professionals (especially money managers and mutual fund
firms) use a broad-based index as a benchmark to compare their
progress. A broad-based index has the purpose to provide a “snapshot”
of the entire market, such as the S&P 500 or the Wilshire 5000. (See
descriptions of both indexes later in this chapter.)
 Composite index: This is an index or average that is a combination of
several averages or indexes. An example is the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) Composite, which tracks all the stocks on the NYSE.
Checking Out the Indexes
Although most people consider the Dow, Nasdaq, and Standard & Poor’s 500
to be the stars of the financial press, you may find other indexes equally
important to follow because they cover other significant facets of the market,
such as small-cap and mid-cap stocks.
60
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

You can check out other less-sexy indexes that cover specific sectors and
industries. If you’re investing in an Internet stock, you should also check the
Internet Stock Index to compare what your stock is doing when measured
against the index. You can find indexes that cover industries such as trans-
portation, brokerage firms, retailers, computer companies, and real estate
firms. For a comprehensive list of indexes, go to www.djindexes.com (a
Dow Jones & Co. Web site). The most reliable and most widely respected
indexes are produced not only by Dow Jones but also Standard & Poor’s and
the major exchanges/markets themselves such as the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE), the American Stock Exchange (AMEX), and Nasdaq. There
are also indexes issued or provided by smaller exchanges (such as the
Philadelphia Exchange).
The Dow Jones Industrial Average
The most famous stock market barometer is my first example — the Dow
Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). When someone asks how the market is
doing, most investors quote the DJIA (simply referred to as “the Dow”). The
Dow is price weighted and tracks a basket of 30 of the largest and most influ-
ential public companies in the stock market. The following list shows the cur-
rent roster of 30 stocks tracked on the DJIA (in alphabetical order by
company with their stock symbols in parentheses).
Alcoa (AA)
Altria (MO)
American Express Co. (AXP)
American International Group (AIG)
Boeing (BA)
Caterpillar (CAT)
Citigroup (C)
Coca-Cola (KO)
Disney (DIS)
DuPont (DD)
Exxon Mobil (XOM)
General Electric (GE)
General Motors (GM)
Hewlett-Packard (HPQ)

Honeywell International Inc. (HON)
Intel (INTC)
International Business Machines (IBM)
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)
J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM)
McDonald’s (MCD)
Merck (MRK)
Microsoft (MSFT)
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M) (MMM)
Pfizer (PFE)
Procter & Gamble (PG)
SBC Communications (SBC)
United Technologies (UTX)
Verizon (VZ)
Wal-Mart Stores (WMT)
The Dow has survived as a popular gauge of stock market activity for over a
century. Although it’s an important indicator of the market’s progress, the
Dow does have one major drawback: It tracks only 30 companies. Regardless
of their status in the market, the companies in the Dow represent a limited
sampling, so they don’t communicate the true pulse of the market. For exam-
ple, when the Dow surpassed the record 10,000 and 11,000 milestones during
1999 and 2000, the majority of (nonindex) companies showed lackluster or
declining stock price movement. (See the “Dow Jones milestones” sidebar,
later in this chapter, for more information.)
The roster of the Dow has changed many times during the 100-plus years of
its existence. The only original company from 1896 is General Electric. Dow
Jones made most of the changes because of company mergers and bank-
ruptcy. However, they made some changes to simply reflect the changing
times. In 2004, AT&T, International Paper, and Eastman Kodak were removed
from the Dow and replaced with AIG Corp., Pfizer, and Verizon.
The Dow isn’t a pure gauge of industrial activity because it also includes a
hodgepodge of nonindustrial companies such as J.P. Morgan Chase and
Citigroup (banks), Home Depot (retailing), and Microsoft (software). Because
of these changes, it doesn’t adequately reflect industrial activity. During the
late 1990s and right up to 2005, true industrial sectors such as manufacturing
had difficult times, yet the Dow rose to record levels.
62
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

Serious investors look at the following indexes:
 Broad-based indexes: Indexes such as the S&P 500 and the Wilshire
5000 are more realistic gauges of the stock market’s performance than
the Dow.
 Industry or sector indexes: These indexes are better gauges of the
growth (or lack of growth) of specific industries and sectors. If you buy a
gold stock, then you should track the index for the precious metals
industry.
Dow Jones has several averages, including the Dow Jones Transportation
Average (DJTA) and the Dow Jones Utilities Average (DJUA). Dow Jones man-
ages both of these indexes more strictly than the Dow. The DJUA sticks to
utilities, so it tends to be a more accurate barometer of the market it repre-
sents. (The same goes for the DJTA.)

Dow Jones milestones
This table shows when the Dow Jones
Industrial Average reached each of eleven
1,000-point milestones and how long it took to
reach that point:

Nov. 14, 1972

10,000
March 29, 1999
12 months
11,000
May 3, 1999
1 month
As you can see, the Dow took 76 years to hit its
first milestone. But as each succeeding mile-
stone came along, it took less and less time to
hit the next one, due to the fact that the higher
the Dow is in a relative sense, the easier it is to
jump 1,000 points. For example, it went from
6,000 to 7,000 in only four months.
The Dow moved between 1,000 and 11,000
mostly during modern times. As the table indi-
cates, most of the milestones happened during
the 1982–1999 bull market. But the Dow didn’t
reach a new milestone from 2000–2004. That
fact alone tells you that the Dow either stalled
or declined when the bear market of 2000
arrived. Although the Dow had an up year in
2004, the long-term bear market is actually still
in effect. The Dow hit its high of 11,722 in
January 2000, and it traded around 10,500 in
September 2005.

Nasdaq indexes
Nasdaq became a formalized market in 1971. The name used to stand for
“National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quote” system, but
now it’s simply “Nasdaq” (as if it’s a name like Ralph or Eddie). Nasdaq
indexes are similar to other indexes in style and structure. The only differ-
ence is that, well, they cover companies traded on the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq
has two indexes (both reported in the financial pages):
 Nasdaq Composite Index: Most frequently quoted on the news, the
Nasdaq Composite Index covers the more than 5,000 companies that
trade on Nasdaq. The companies encompass a variety of industries, but
the index’s concentration has primarily been technology, telecom, and
Internet industries. The Nasdaq Composite Index hit an all-time high of
5,048 in March 2000 before the worst bear market in its history occurred.
The index dropped a whopping 60 percent by 2003 to approximately 2,000.
 Nasdaq 100 Index: The Nasdaq 100 tracks the 100 largest companies in
Nasdaq. This index is for investors who want to concentrate on the
largest companies, which tend to be especially weighted in technology
issues, which means it provides extra representation of technology-
related companies such as Microsoft, Adobe, and Symantec.
In either case, although these indexes track growth-oriented companies, the
stocks of these companies are also very volatile and carry commensurate
risk. The indexes themselves bear this risk out; in the bear market of 2000
and 2001 (and even extending into 2002), they fell more than 60 percent.
Standard & Poor’s 500
The Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) tracks the 500 largest (measured by
market value) publicly traded companies. The publishing firm Standard &
Poor’s created this index. (I bet you could’ve guessed that.) Because it con-
tains 500 companies, the S&P 500 represents overall market performance
better than the DJIA’s 30 companies. Money managers and financial advisors
actually watch the S&P 500 stock index more closely than the DJIA. Most
mutual funds especially like to measure their performance against the S&P
500 rather than against any other index. Mutual funds that concentrate on
small-cap stocks usually prefer an index that has more small-cap stocks in it,
such as the Russell 2000.
The S&P 500 doesn’t attempt to cover the 500 “biggest” companies. Instead, it
includes companies that are widely held and widely followed. The companies
64
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

are also industry leaders in a variety of industries, including energy, technology,
healthcare, and finance. It’s a market-value weighted index (which I explain in
the section “Knowing How Indexes Are Measured,” earlier in this chapter).
Although it’s a reliable indicator of the market’s overall status, the S&P 500
also has some limitations. Despite the fact that it tracks 500 companies, the
top 50 companies encompass 50 percent of the index’s market value. This sit-
uation can be a drawback because those 50 companies have a greater influence
on the S&P 500 index’s price movement than any other segment of companies.
In other words, 10 percent of the companies have an equal impact to 90 per-
cent of the companies on the same index. Therefore, although the index better
represents the market than the DIJA, the index may not offer an accurate rep-
resentation of the general market.
S&P doesn’t set the 500 companies they track in stone. S&P can add or remove
companies when market conditions change. They can remove a company if it
isn’t doing well or goes bankrupt, and they can replace a company in the
index with another company that is doing better.
Russell 3000 Index
The Russell 3000 Index is a great example of an index that seeks more com-
prehensive inclusion of U.S. companies. It includes the 3,000 largest publicly
traded companies (nearly 98 percent of publicly traded stocks). The Russell
3000 is important because it includes many mid-cap and small-cap stocks.
Most companies covered in the Russell 3000 have an average market value of
a billion dollars or less.
The Frank Russell Company created the Russell 3000 Index and actually com-
putes a series of indexes such as the Russell 1000 and the Russell 2000. The
Russell 2000, for example, contains the smallest 2,000 companies from the
Russell 3000, while the Russell 1000 contains the largest 1,000 companies.
The Russell indexes don’t cover micro cap stocks (companies with a market
capitalization under $250 million).
Wilshire Total Market Index
The Wilshire 5000 Equity Index, often referred to as the Wilshire Total Market
Index, is probably the largest stock index in the world. Wilshire Associates
started out in 1980 tracking 5,000 stocks. Since then, the Wilshire 5000 has
ballooned to cover more than 7,500 stocks. The advantage of the Wilshire
65
Chapter 5: Say Cheese: Getting a Snapshot of the Market

5000 is that it’s very comprehensive, covering nearly the entire market. For
investors and analysts that seek the greatest representation/ performance of
the general market, they would check out this index. (At the very least, the
Wilshire 5000 tracks the largest publicly traded stocks.) It includes all the
stocks that are on the major stock exchanges (NYSE, AMEX, and the largest
issues on Nasdaq), which by default also include all the stocks covered by
the S&P 500. The Wilshire 5000 is a market-value weighted index, which I dis-
cuss in the section “Knowing How Indexes Are Measured,” earlier in this
chapter.
International indexes
Investors need to remember that the whole world is a vast marketplace that
interacts with and exerts tremendous influence on individual national
economies and markets. Whether you have one stock or one mutual fund,
keep tabs on how world markets affect your portfolio. The best way to get a
snapshot of international markets is, of course, with indexes. Here are some
of the more widely followed international indexes:
 Nikkei (Japan): This index is considered Japan’s version of the Dow. If
you’re invested in Japanese stocks or in stocks that do business with
Japan, you want to know what’s up with the Nikkei.
 FTSE-100 (Great Britain): Usually referred to as the “footsie,” this
market-value weighted index includes the top 100 public companies in
the United Kingdom.
 CAC-40 (France): This index tracks the 40 public stocks that trade on
the Paris Stock Exchange.
 DAX (Germany): This index tracks the 30 largest and most active stocks
that trade on the Frankfurt Exchange.
 Halter USX China Index (China): This index tracks a basket of 50 U.S.
public companies that derive most of their revenues from China.
You can track these international indexes (among others) at major financial
Web sites, such as www.bloomberg.com and www.marketwatch.com. You
may find international indexes useful in your analysis as you watch your
stock’s progress. What if you have stock in a company that has most of its
customers in Japan? Then the Nikkei can help you get a general snapshot of
how well the major companies are doing in Japan, which in turn can be a gen-
eral barometer of its economy’s well-being. If your company’s business part-
ners or customers are in the Nikkei, and it’s plunging, then you know it’s
probably “sayonara” for the company’s stock price.

Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 

Using the Indexes
You may be wondering what to do with all the indexes out there and which
one or ones you should be checking out. The sections below give you some
idea of how to put all the pieces together.
Tracking the indexes
The bottom line is that investors get an instant snapshot of how well the
market is doing from indexes. Indexes offer a quick way to compare the per-
formance of one investor’s stock portfolio or mutual funds with the rest of
the market. If the Dow goes up 10 percent in a year and your portfolio shows
a cumulative gain of 12 percent, then you know that you’re doing well.
Appendix A in the back of this book lists resources to help you keep up with
various indexes.
The problem with indexes is that they can be misleading if you take them too
literally as an accurate barometer of stock success. The Dow, for example,
has changed its roster of companies many times since 1896. Had it not, the
Dow’s general upward trajectory in the past few decades would have been
much different. Laggard stocks have been dropped and replaced with other
stocks that have shown more promise. Many of the original companies that
were in the DJIA in 1896 did go out of business, or other companies, that
aren’t reflected in the index, bought them out.
Investing in indexes
Can you invest directly in indexes? If the market is doing well but your spe-
cific stock is not, can you find a way to invest in the index itself? With invest-
ments based on indexes, you can invest in the general market or a particular
industry.
Say that you want to invest in the DJIA. After all, why try to “beat the market”
if just matching it is sufficient to grow your wealth? Why not have a portfolio
that directly mirrors the DJIA? Well, it’s too impractical and expensive to
invest in all 30 stocks that are in the DJIA. Fortunately, there are alternatives
that can accomplish the act of “investing in indexes.” Here are the best ways:
 Index mutual funds: An index mutual fund is much like a regular mutual
fund except that it will only invest in securities (in this case, stocks) that
match as closely as possible the basket of stocks that are in that particular
67
Chapter 5: Say Cheese: Getting a Snapshot of the Market

index. There are index mutual funds, for example, that track the DJIA
and the S&P 500. Find out more about index mutual funds at places such
as the Investment Company Institute (www.ici.org).
 Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs): This is a particular favorite of mine.
ETFs have similar characteristics to a mutual fund except for a few key
differences. An ETF can reflect a basket of stocks that mirror a particular
index, but the ETF can be traded like a stock itself. You can transact
ETFs like stocks in that you can buy, sell, or go short. You can put stop
losses on them and you can even purchase them on margin. ETFs can
give you the diversification of mutual funds coupled with the versatility
of stocks. Examples of ETFs that track indexes are the DJIA ETF (symbol
DIA) and the ETF for Nasdaq (QQQ). You can find out more about ETFs
at the American Stock Exchange (www.amex.com).

nowledge and information are two critical success factors in stock
investing. (Isn’t that true about most things in life?) People who plunge
headlong into stocks without sufficient knowledge of the stock market in gen-
eral, and current information in particular, quickly learn the lesson of the
eager diver who didn’t find out ahead of time that the pool was only an inch
deep (ouch!). In their haste to avoid missing so-called golden investment
opportunities, investors too often end up losing money.
Opportunities to make money in the stock market will always be there, no
matter how well or how poorly the economy and the market are performing
in general. There’s no such thing as a single (and fleeting) magical moment,
so don’t feel that if you let an opportunity pass you by, you’ll always regret
that you missed your one big chance.
For the best approach to stock investing, you want to build your knowledge
and find quality information first. Then buy stocks and make your fortunes
more assuredly. Basically, before you buy stock, you need to know that the
company you’re investing in is
 Financially sound and growing
 Offering products and services that are in demand by consumers
 In a strong and growing industry (and general economy)

Looking to Stock Exchanges for Answers
Before you invest in stocks, you need to be completely familiar with the
basics of stock investing. At its most fundamental, stock investing is about
using your money to buy a piece of a company that will give you value in the
form of appreciation or income. Fortunately, many resources are available to
help you find out about stock investing. Some of my favorite places are the
stock exchanges themselves.
Stock exchanges are organized marketplaces for the buying and selling of
stocks (and other securities). The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the pre-
mier stock exchange, provides a framework for stock buyers and sellers to
make their transactions. The NYSE makes money not only from a piece of
every transaction but also from fees (such as listing fees) charged to compa-
nies and brokers that are members of its exchanges.
The main exchanges for most stock investors are the NYSE and the American
Stock Exchange (AMEX). Nasdaq is technically not an exchange but it is a
formal market that effectively acts as an exchange. These three encourage
and inform people about stock investing. Since these exchanges/markets ben-
efit from increased popularity of stock investing and continued demand for
stocks, they offer a wealth of free (or low-cost) information and resources for
stock investors. Go to their Web sites and you find useful resources such as:
 Tutorials on how to invest in stocks, common investment strategies, and
so on
 Glossaries and free information to help you understand the language,
practice, and purpose of stock investing
 A wealth of news, press releases, financial data, and other information
about companies listed at the exchange or market, accessed usually
through an onsite search engine
 Industry analysis & news
 Stock quotes and other market information related to the daily market
movements of stocks including data such as volume, new highs, new
lows, and so on
 Free tracking of your stock selections (You can input a sample portfolio,
or the stocks you are following, to see how well you are doing.)

Part II: Before You Start Buying 

Understanding Stocks and the
Companies They Represent
Stocks represent ownership in companies. Before you buy individual stocks,
you want to understand the companies whose stock you’re considering and find
out about their operations. It may sound like a daunting task, but you’ll digest
the point more easily when you realize that companies work very similarly to
how you work. They make decisions on a day-to-day basis just as you do.
Think about how you grow and prosper as an individual or as a family, and
you see the same issues with companies and how they grow and prosper.
Low earnings and high debt are examples of financial difficulties that can
affect both people and companies. You’ll understand companies’ finances
when you take the time to pick up some information in two basic disciplines:
accounting and economics. These two disciplines play a significant role in
understanding the performance of a company’s stock.
Accounting for taste and a whole lot more
Accounting. Ugh! But face it: Accounting is the language of business, and
believe it or not, you’re already familiar with the most important accounting
concepts! Just look at the following three essential principles:
 Assets minus liabilities equal net worth. In other words, take what you
own (your assets), subtract what you owe (your liabilities), and the rest
is yours (net worth)! Your own personal finances work the same way as
Microsoft’s (except yours have fewer zeros at the end). See Chapter 2 to
figure out how to calculate your own net worth.
A company’s balance sheet shows you its net worth at a specific point of
time (such as December 31). The net worth of a company is the bottom
line of a company’s asset and liability picture, and it tells you whether
the company is solvent (has the ability to pay its debts without going out
of business). The net worth of a successful company is regularly grow-
ing. To see whether your company is successful, compare its net worth
with the net worth from the same point a year earlier. A company that
has a $4 million net worth on December 31, 2005, and a $5 million net
worth on December 31, 2006, is doing well; its net worth has gone up 25
percent ($1 million) in one year.
 Income less expenses equal net income. In other words, take what you
make (your income), subtract what you spend (your expenses), and the
remainder is your net income (or net profit or net earnings — your gain).
A company’s profitability is the whole point of investing in its stock. As
it profits, the company becomes more valuable, and in turn, its stock
73
Chapter 6: Gathering Information

price becomes more valuable. To discover a company’s net income, look
at its income statement. Try to determine whether the company uses 
its gains wisely, either reinvesting it for continued growth or paying
down debt.
 Do a comparative financial analysis. That’s a mouthful, but it’s just a
fancy way of saying how a company is doing now, compared with some-
thing else (like a prior period or a similar company).
If you know that a company you’re looking at had a net income of
$50,000 for the year, you may ask, “Is that good or bad?” Obviously,
making a net profit is good, but you also need to know whether it’s good
compared to something else. If the company had a net profit of $40,000
the year before, you know that the company’s profitability is improving.
But if a similar company had a net profit of $100,000 the year before and
in the current year is making $50,000, then you may want to either avoid
that company or see what went wrong (if anything) with it.
Accounting can be this simple. If you understand these three basic points,
you’re ahead of the curve (in stock investing as well as in your personal
finances). For more information on how to use a company’s financial state-
ments to pick good stocks, see Chapter 11.
Understanding how economics 
affects stocks
Economics. Double ugh! No, you aren’t required to understand “the inelastic-
ity of demand aggregates” (thank heavens!) or “marginal utility” (say what?).
But a working knowledge of basic economics is crucial (and I mean crucial)
to your success and proficiency as a stock investor. The stock market and the
economy are joined at the hip. The good (or bad) things that happen to one
have a direct effect on the other.
Getting the hang of the basic concepts
Alas, many investors get lost on basic economic concepts (as do some so-
called experts that you see on television). I owe my personal investing suc-
cess to my status as a student of economics. Understanding basic economics
helped me (and will help you) filter the financial news to separate relevant
information from the irrelevant in order to make better investment decisions.
Be aware of these important economic concepts:
 Supply and demand: How can anyone possibly think about economics
without thinking of the ageless concept of supply and demand? Supply
and demand can be simply stated as the relationship between what’s
available (the supply) and what people want and are willing to pay for
(the demand). This equation is the main engine of economic activity 
and is extremely important for your stock investing analysis and 
74
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

decision-making process. I mean, do you really want to buy stock in a
company that makes elephant-foot umbrella stands if you find out that 
the company has an oversupply and nobody wants to buy them anyway?
 Cause and effect: If you pick up a prominent news report and read,
“Companies in the table industry are expecting plummeting sales,” do
you rush out and invest in companies that sell chairs or manufacture
tablecloths? Considering cause and effect is an exercise in logical think-
ing, and believe you me, logic is a major component of sound economic
thought.
When you read business news, play it out in your mind. What good (or
bad) can logically be expected given a certain event or situation? If
you’re looking for an effect (“I want a stock price that keeps increasing”),
you also want to understand the cause. Here are some typical events
that can cause a stock’s price to rise:
• Positive news reports about a company: The news may report
that a company is enjoying success with increased sales or a new
product.
• Positive news reports about a company’s industry: The media
may be highlighting that the industry is poised to do well.
• Positive news reports about a company’s customers: Maybe your
company is in industry A, but its customers are in industry B. If
you see good news about industry B, that may be good news for
your stock.
• Negative news reports about a company’s competitors: If they are
in trouble, their customers may seek alternatives to buy from,
including your company.
 Economic effects from government actions: Political and governmental
actions have economic consequences. As a matter of fact, nothing (and I
mean nothing!) has a greater effect on investing and economics than
government. Government actions usually manifest themselves as taxes,
laws, or regulations. They also can take on a more ominous appearance,
such as war or the threat of war. Government can willfully (or even acci-
dentally) cause a company to go bankrupt, disrupt an entire industry, or
even cause a depression. It controls the money supply, credit, and all
public securities markets.
What happens to the elephant-foot, umbrella stand industry if the gov-
ernment passes a 50 percent sales tax for that industry? Such a sales tax
certainly makes a product uneconomical and encourages consumers to
seek alternatives to elephant-foot umbrella stands. It may even boost
sales for the wastepaper basket industry.
The opposite can be true as well. What if the government passes a tax
credit that encourages the use of solar power in homes and businesses?
That obviously has a positive impact on industries that manufacture or
sell solar power devices. Just don’t ask me what happens to solar-powered
elephant-foot umbrella stands.

Chapter 6: Gathering Information

Gaining insight from past mistakes
Because most investors ignored some basic observations about economics in
the late 1990s, they subsequently lost trillions in their stock portfolios. In the
late 1990s, the United States experienced the greatest expansion of debt in
history, coupled with a record expansion of the money supply. The Federal
Reserve (or “the Fed”), the U.S. government’s central bank, controls both. This
growth of debt and money supply resulted in more consumer (and corporate)
borrowing, spending, and investing. This activity hyperstimulated the stock
market and caused stocks to rise 25 percent per year for five straight years.
Of course, you should always be happy to earn 25 percent per year with your
investments, but such a return can’t be sustained and encourages specula-
tion. This artificial stimulation by the Fed resulted in the following:
 More and more people depleted their savings. After all, why settle for 
3 percent in the bank when you can get 25 percent in the stock market?
 More and more people bought on credit. If the economy is booming, why
not buy now and pay later? Consumer credit hit record highs.
 More and more people borrowed against their homes. Why not borrow
and get rich now? I can pay off my debt later.
 More and more companies sold more goods as consumers took more
vacations and bought SUVs, electronics, and so on. Companies then bor-
rowed to finance expansion, open new stores, and so on.
 More and more companies went public and offered stock to take advan-
tage of more money that was flowing to the markets from banks and
other financial institutions.
In the end, spending started to slow down because consumers and busi-
nesses became too indebted. This slowdown in turn caused the sales of
goods and services to taper off. However, companies had too much over-
head, capacity, and debt because they expanded too eagerly. At this point,
companies were caught in a financial bind. Too much debt and too many
expenses in a slowing economy mean one thing: Profits shrink or disappear.
Companies, to stay in business, had to do the logical thing — cut expenses.
What is usually the biggest expense for companies? People! To stay in busi-
ness, many companies started laying off employees. As a result, consumer
spending dropped further because more people were either laid off or had
second thoughts about their own job security.
As people had little in the way of savings and too much in the way of debt,
they had to sell their stock to pay their bills. This trend was a major reason
that stocks started to fall in 2000. Earnings started to drop because of shrink-
ing sales from a sputtering economy. As earnings fell, stock prices also fell.
The lessons from the 1990s are important ones for investors today:
76
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

 Stocks are not a replacement for savings accounts. Always have some
money in the bank.
 Stocks should never occupy 100 percent of your investment funds.
 When anyone (including an expert) tells you that the economy will keep
growing indefinitely, be skeptical and read diverse sources of information.
 If stocks do well in your portfolio, consider protecting your stocks (both
your original investment and any gains) with stop-loss orders. (See
Chapter 18 for more on these strategies.)
 Keep debt and expenses to a minimum.
 Remember that if the economy is booming, a decline is sure to follow as
the ebb and flow of the economy’s business cycle continues.
Staying on Top of Financial News
Reading the financial news can help you decide where or where not to invest.
Many newspapers, magazines, and Web sites offer great coverage of the finan-
cial world. Obviously, the more informed you are, the better, but you don’t
have to read everything that’s written. The information explosion in recent
years has gone beyond overload, and you can easily spend so much time
reading that you have little time left for investing.
The most obvious publications of interest to stock investors are The Wall
Street Journal and Investor’s Business Daily. These excellent publications
report the news and stock data as of the prior trading day. Some of the 
more obvious Web sites are MarketWatch (www.marketwatch.com) and
Bloomberg (www.bloomberg.com). These Web sites can actually give you
news and stock data within 15 to 20 minutes after an event occurs. (Don’t
forget the exchanges’ Web sites!)

Chapter 6: Gathering Information
Know thyself
If you’re reading this book, you’re probably
doing so because you want to become a suc-
cessful investor. Granted, to be a successful
investor, you have to select great stocks, but
having a realistic understanding of your own
financial situation and goals is equally impor-
tant. I recall one investor who lost $10,000 in a
speculative stock. The loss wasn’t that bad
because he had most of his money safely
tucked away elsewhere. He also understood
that his overall financial situation was secure
and that the money he lost was “play” money
whose loss wouldn’t have a drastic effect on his
life. But many investors often lose even more
money, and the loss does have a major, nega-
tive effect on their lives. You may not be like the
investor who could afford to lose $10,000. Take
time to understand yourself, your own financial
picture, and your personal investment goals
before you decide to buy stocks.

Appendix A of this book provides more information on these resources along
with a treasure trove of some of the best publications, resources, and Web
sites to assist you.
Figuring out what a company’s up to
Before you invest, you need to know what’s going on with a company. When
you read about a company, either from the company’s literature (its annual
report, for example) or from media sources, be sure to get answers to some
pertinent questions:
 Is the company making more net income than it did last year? You
want to invest in a company that is growing.
 Are the company’s sales greater than they were the year before?
Remember, you won’t make money if the company isn’t making money.
 Is the company issuing press releases on new products, services,
inventions, or business deals? All these achievements indicate a strong,
vital company.
Knowing how the company is doing, no matter what’s happening with the
general economy, is obviously important. To better understand how compa-
nies tick, see Chapter 12.
Discovering what’s new with an industry
As you consider investing in a stock, make it a point to know what’s going on
in that company’s industry. If the industry is doing well, your stock is likely to
do well, too. But then again, the reverse is also true.
Yes, I have seen investors pick successful stocks in a failing industry, but
those cases are exceptional. By and large, it’s easier to succeed with a stock
when the entire industry is doing well. As you’re watching the news, reading
the financial pages, or viewing financial Web sites, check out the industry to
see that it’s strong and dynamic. See Chapter 13 for information on analyzing
industries.
Knowing what’s happening 
with the economy
No matter how well or how poorly the overall economy is performing, you
want to stay informed about its general progress. It’s easier for the value of
stock to keep going up when the economy is stable or growing. The reverse is
78
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

also true; if the economy is contracting or declining, the stock has a tougher
time keeping its value. Some basic items to keep tabs on include the following:
 Gross domestic product (GDP): This is roughly the total value of output
for a particular nation, measured in the dollar amount of goods and ser-
vices. GDP is reported quarterly, and a rising GDP bodes well for your
stock. When the GDP is rising 3 percent or more on an annual basis,
that’s solid growth. If it rises at more than zero but less than 3 percent,
that’s generally considered less than stellar (or mediocre). GDP under
zero (or negative) means that the economy is shrinking (heading into
recession).
 The index of leading economic indicators (LEI): The LEI is a snapshot
of a set of economic statistics covering activity that precedes what’s
happening in the economy. Each statistic helps you understand the
economy in much the same way that barometers (and windows!) help
you understand what’s happening with the weather. Economists don’t
just look at an individual statistic; they look at a set of statistics to get a
more complete picture of what’s happening with the economy. Chapter 14
goes into greater detail on ways the economy affects stock prices.
Seeing what the politicians and 
government bureaucrats are doing
Being informed about what public officials are doing is vital to your success
as a stock investor. Because federal, state, and local governments pass liter-
ally thousands of laws every year, monitoring the political landscape is criti-
cal to your success. The news media report what the president and Congress
are doing, so always ask yourself, “How does a new law, tax, or regulation
affect my stock investment?”
Because government actions have a significant effect on your investments,
it’s a good idea to see what’s going on. Laws being proposed or enacted by
the Federal government can be found through the Thomas legislative search
engine, which is run by the Library of Congress (www.loc.gov). Also, some
great organizations inform the public about tax laws and their impact, such
as the National Taxpayers Union (www.ntu.org).
Checking for trends in society, culture,
and entertainment
As odd as it sounds, trends in society, popular culture, and entertainment
affect your investments, directly or indirectly. For example, headlines such as
“The graying of America — more people than ever before will be senior citi-
zens” give you some important information that can make or break your stock
79
Chapter 6: Gathering Information

portfolio. With that particular headline, you know that as more and more
people age, companies that are well positioned to cater to this growing
market’s wants and needs will do well — meaning a successful stock for you.
Keep your eyes open to emerging trends in society at large. What trends are
evident now? Can you anticipate the wants and needs of tomorrow’s society?
Being alert, staying a step ahead of the public, and choosing stock appropri-
ately gives you a profitable edge over other investors. If you own stock in a
solid company with growing sales and earnings, other investors eventually
notice. As more investors buy up your company’s stocks, you’re rewarded as
the stock price increases.
Reading (And Understanding) 
Stock Tables
The stock tables in major business publications, such as The Wall Street
Journal and Investor’s Business Daily, are loaded with information that can
help you become a savvy investor — if you know how to interpret them. You
need the information in the stock tables for more than selecting promising
investment opportunities. You also need to consult the tables after you invest
to monitor how your stocks are doing. If you bought HokySmoky common
stock last year at $12 per share and you want to know what it’s worth today,
check out the stock tables.
If you look at the stock tables without knowing what or why you’re looking,
it’s the equivalent of reading War and Peace backwards through a kaleido-
scope. Nothing makes sense. But I can help you make sense of it all (well, at
least the stock tables!). Table 6-1 shows a sample stock table for you to refer
to as you read the sections that follow.

Part II: Before You Start Buying 

Every newspaper’s financial tables are a little different, but they give you
basically the same information. Updated daily, this section is not the place to
start your search for a good stock; this section is usually where your search
ends. The stock tables are the place to look when you already know what you
want to buy and you’re just checking to see the most recent price, or to look
when you already own it and you want to check the latest stock price.
Each item gives you some clues about the current state of affairs for that par-
ticular company. The sections that follow describe each column to help you
understand what you’re looking at.
52-week high
The column labeled “52-Wk High” (refer to Table 6-1) gives you the highest
price that particular stock has reached in the most recent 52-week period.
Knowing this price lets you gauge where the stock is now versus where it has
been recently. SkyHighCorp’s (SHC) stock has been as high as $21.50, while
its last (most recent) price is $21.25, the number listed in the “Day Last”
column. (Flip to the “Day Last” section for more on understanding this infor-
mation.) SkyHighCorp’s stock is trading very high right now because it’s hov-
ering right near its overall 52-week high figure.
Now, take a look at DoinBadlyCorp’s (DBC) stock price. It seems to have tum-
bled big time. Its stock price has had a high in the past 52 weeks of $83, but
it’s currently trading at $33.50. Something just doesn’t seem right here. During
the past 52 weeks, DBC’s stock price fell dramatically. If you’re thinking about
investing in DBC, find out why the stock price fell. If the company is a strong
company, it may be a good opportunity to buy stock at a lower price. If the
company is having tough times, avoid it. In any case, research the company
and find out why its stock has declined.
52-week low
The column labeled “52-Wk Low” gives you the lowest price that particular
stock reached in the most recent 52-week period. Again, this information is
crucial to your ability to analyze stock over a period of time. Look at DBC in
Table 6-1, and you can see that its current trading price of $33.50 is close to
its 52-week low.
Keep in mind that the high and the low prices just give you a range of how far
that particular stock’s price has moved within the past 52 weeks. They could
alert you that a stock has problems, or they could tell you that a stock’s price
has fallen enough to make it a bargain. Simply reading the 52-Wk High and 
52-Wk Low columns isn’t enough to determine which of those two scenarios is
happening. They basically tell you to get more information before you commit
your money.
81
Chapter 6: Gathering Information

Name and symbol
The “Name (Symbol)” column is the simplest in Table 6-1. It tells you the
company name (usually abbreviated) and the stock symbol assigned to the
company. When you have your eye on a stock for potential purchase, get
familiar with its symbol. Knowing the symbol makes it easier for you to find
your stock in the financial tables, which list stocks in alphabetical order by
the company’s name. Stock symbols are the language of stock investing, and
you need to use them in all stock communications, from getting a stock quote
at your broker’s office to buying stock over the Internet.
Dividend
Dividends (shown under the “Div” column in Table 6-1) are basically pay-
ments to owners (stockholders). If a company pays a dividend, it’s shown in
the dividend column. The amount you see is the annual dividend quoted for
one share of that stock. If you look at LowDownInc (LDI) in Table 6-1, you can
see that you get $2.35 as an annual dividend for each share of stock that you
own. Companies usually pay the dividend in quarterly amounts. If I own 100
shares of LDI, the company pays me a quarterly dividend of $58.75 ($235 total
per year). A healthy company strives to maintain or upgrade the dividend for
stockholders from year to year. In any case, the dividend is very important to
investors seeking income from their stock investment. For more about invest-
ing for income, see Chapter 9. Investors buy stock in companies that don’t
pay dividends primarily for growth. For more information on growth stocks,
see Chapter 8.
Volume
Normally, when you hear the word volume on the news, it refers to how much
stock is bought and sold for the entire market. (“Well, stocks were very active
today. Trading volume at the New York Stock Exchange hit 2 billion shares.”)
Volume is certainly important to watch because the stocks that you’re invest-
ing in are somewhere in that activity. For the “Vol” column in Table 6-1,
though, the volume refers to the individual stock.
Volume tells you how many shares of that particular stock were traded that
day. If only 100 shares are traded in a day, then the trading volume is 100. SHC
had 3,143 shares change hands on the trading day represented in Table 6-1. Is
that good or bad? Neither, really. Usually the business news media only men-
tion volume for a particular stock when it’s unusually large. If a stock normally
has volume in the 5,000 to 10,000 range and all of a sudden has a trading
volume of 87,000, then it’s time to sit up and take notice.
82
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

Keep in mind that a low trading volume for one stock may be high trading
volume for another stock. You can’t necessarily compare one stock’s volume
against that of any other company. The large-cap stocks like IBM or Microsoft
typically have trading volumes in the millions of shares almost every day,
while less active, smaller stocks may have average trading volumes in far, far
smaller numbers.
The main point to remember is that trading volume that is far in excess of that
stock’s normal range is a sign that something is going on with that stock. It
may be negative or positive, but something newsworthy is happening with
that company. If the news is positive, the increased volume is a result of more
people buying the stock. If the news is negative, the increased volume is prob-
ably a result of more people selling the stock. What are typical events that
cause increased trading volume? Some positive reasons include the following:
 Good earnings reports: A company announces good (or better-than-
expected) earnings.
 A new business deal: A company announces a favorable business deal,
such as a joint venture, or lands a big client.
 A new product or service: A company’s research and development
department creates a potentially profitable new product.
 Indirect benefits: A company may benefit from a new development in
the economy or from a new law passed by Congress.
Some negative reasons for an unusually large fluctuation in trading volume
for a particular stock include the following:
 Bad earnings reports: Profit is the lifeblood of a company. When a com-
pany’s profits fall or disappear, you see more volume.
 Governmental problems: The stock is being targeted by government
action (such as a lawsuit or Securities and Exchange Commission probe).
 Liability issues: The media report that a company has a defective prod-
uct or similar problem.
 Financial problems: Independent analysts report that a company’s
financial health is deteriorating.
Check out what’s happening when you hear about heavier than usual volume
(especially if you already own the stock).
Yield
In general, yield is a return on the money you invest. However, in the stock
tables, yield (“Yld” in Table 6-1) is a reference to what percentage that particular
dividend is to the stock price. Yield is most important to income investors.
83
Chapter 6: Gathering Information

It’s calculated by dividing the annual dividend by the current stock price. In
Table 6-1, you can see that the yield du jour of ValueNowInc (VNI) is 4.5 per-
cent (a dividend of $1 divided by the company’s stock price of $22). Notice
that many companies have no yield reported; because they have no divi-
dends, yield is zero.
Keep in mind that the yield reported in the financial pages changes daily as
the stock price changes. Yield is always reported as if you’re buying the stock
that day. If you buy VNI on the day represented in Table 6-1, your yield is 4.5
percent. But what if VNI’s stock price rises to $30 the following day? Investors
who buy stock at $30 per share obtain a yield of just 3.3 percent. (The divi-
dend of $1 is then divided by the new stock price, $30.) Of course, because
you bought the stock at $22, you essentially locked in the prior yield of 4.5
percent. Lucky you. Pat yourself on the back.
P/E
The P/E ratio is the ratio between the price of the stock and the company’s
earnings. P/E ratios are widely followed and are important barometers of
value in the world of stock investing. The P/E ratio (also called the “earnings
multiple” or just “multiple”) is frequently used to determine whether a stock
is expensive (a good value). Value investors (such as yours truly) find P/E
ratios to be essential to analyzing a stock as a potential investment. As a gen-
eral rule, the P/E should be 10 to 20 for large-cap or income stocks. For
growth stocks, a P/E no greater than 30 to 40 is preferable.
In the P/E ratios reported in stock tables, price refers to the cost of a single
share of stock. Earnings refers to the company’s reported earnings per share
as of the most recent four quarters. The P/E ratio is the price divided by the
earnings. In Table 6-1, VNI has a reported P/E of 12, which is considered a low
P/E. Notice how SHC has a relatively high P/E (76). This stock is considered
too pricey because you’re paying a price equivalent to 76 times earnings.
Also notice that DBC has no available P/E ratio. Usually this lack of a P/E ratio
indicates that the company reported a loss in the most recent four quarters.
Day last
The “Day Last” column tells you how trading ended for a particular stock on
the day represented by the table. In Table 6-1 , LDC ended the most recent
day of trading at $41. Some newspapers report the high and low for that day
in addition to the stock’s ending price for the day.
84
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

Net change
The information in the “Net Chg” column answers the question “How did the
stock price end today compared with its trading price at the end of the prior
trading day?” Table 6-1 shows that SHC stock ended the trading day up 25
cents (at $21.25). This column tells you that SHC ended the prior day at $21.
On a day when VNI ends the day at $22 (up 10 cents), you can tell that the
prior day it ended the trading day at $21.90.
Using News about Dividends
Reading and understanding the news about dividends is essential if you’re an
income investor (someone who invests in stocks as a means of generating reg-
ular income). See Chapter 9 on investing for income.
Looking at important dates
In order to understand how buying stocks that pay dividends can benefit you
as an investor, you need to know how companies report and pay dividends.
Some important dates in the life of a dividend are as follows:
 Date of declaration: This is the date when a company reports a quar-
terly dividend and the subsequent payment dates. On January 15, for
example, a company may report that it “is pleased to announce a quar-
terly dividend of 50 cents per share to shareholders of record as of
February 10.” That was easy. The date of declaration is really just the
announcement date. If you buy the stock before, on, or after the date of
declaration, it won’t matter in regard to receiving the stock’s quarterly
dividend. The date that matters is the date of record (see that bullet
later in this list).
 Date of execution: This is the day you actually initiate the stock transac-
tion (buying or selling). If you call up a broker (or contact her online)
today to buy a particular stock, then today is the date of execution, or
the date on which you execute the trade. You don’t own the stock on the
date of execution; it’s just the day you put in the order. For an example,
skip to the section “Understanding why these dates matter,” later in this
chapter.
 Closing date (settlement date): The closing or settlement date is the date
on which the trade is finalized, which usually happens three business
days after the date of execution. The closing date for stock is similar in
85
Chapter 6: Gathering Information

concept to a real estate closing. On the closing date, you’re officially the
proud new owner (or happy seller) of the stock.
 Date of record: The date of record is used to identify which stockhold-
ers qualify to receive the declared dividend. Because stock is bought
and sold every day, how does the company know which investors to
pay? The company establishes a cut-off date by declaring a date of
record. All investors who are official stockholders as of the declared
date of record receive the dividend on the payment date even if they
plan to sell the stock any time between the date of declaration and the
date of record.
 Ex-dividend date: Ex-dividend means without dividend. Because it takes
three days to process a stock purchase before you become an official
owner of the stock, you have to qualify (that is, you have to own or buy
the stock) before the three-day period. That three-day period is referred
to as the “ex-dividend period.” When you buy stock during this short
time frame, you aren’t on the books of record, because the closing (or
settlement) date falls after the date of record. See the section,
“Understanding why these dates matter” to see the effect that the ex-div-
idend date can have on an investor.
 Payment date: The date on which a company issues and mails its divi-
dend checks to shareholders. Finally!
For typical dividends, the events in Table 6-2 happen four times per year.

Part II: Before You Start Buying 

Understanding why these dates matter
Remember that three business days pass between the date of execution and
the closing date. Three business days are also between the ex-dividend date
and the date of record. This information is important to know if you want to
qualify to receive an upcoming dividend. Timing is important, and if you
understand these dates, you know when to purchase stock and whether you
qualify for a dividend.
As an example, say that you want to buy ValueNowInc (VNI) in time to qualify
for the quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share. Assume that the date of record
(the date by which you have to be an official owner of the stock) is February 10.
You have to execute the trade (buy the stock) no later than February 7to be
assured of the dividend. If you execute the trade right on February 7, the clos-
ing date occurs three days later, on February 10 — just in time for the date of
record.
But what if you execute the trade on February 8, a day later? Well, the trade’s
closing date is February 11, which occurs after the date of record. Because
you aren’t on the books as an official stockholder on the date of record, you
aren’t getting that quarterly dividend. In this example, the February 7–10
period is called the ex-dividend period.
Fortunately, for those people who buy the stock during this brief ex-dividend
period, the stock actually trades at a slighter lower price to reflect the
amount of the dividend. If you can’t get the dividend, you may as well save on
the stock purchase. How’s that for a silver lining?
Evaluating (Avoiding?) Investment Tips
Psssst. Have I got a stock tip for you! Come closer. You know what it is?
Research! What I’m trying to tell you is to never automatically invest just
because you get a hot tip from someone. Good investment selection means
looking at several sources before you decide on a stock. No shortcut exists.
That said, getting opinions from others never hurts — just be sure to care-
fully analyze the information you get. In the following list, I present some
important points to bear in mind as you evaluate tips and advice from others:
 Consider the source. Frequently, people buy stock based on the views
of some market strategist or market analyst. People may see an analyst
being interviewed on a television financial show and take that person’s
87
Chapter 6: Gathering Information

opinions and advice as valid and good. The danger here is that the ana-
lyst may be biased because of some relationship that isn’t disclosed on
the show.
It happens on TV all too often. The show’s host interviews Analyst U.R.
Kiddingme from the investment firm Foollum & Sellum. The analyst says,
“Implosion Corp. is a good buy with solid, long-term, upside potential.”
You later find out that the analyst’s employer gets investment banking
fees from Implosion Corp. Do you really think that analyst would ever
issue a negative report on a company that’s helping to pay the bills? It’s
not likely.
 Get multiple views. Don’t base your investment decisions on just one
source unless you have the best reasons in the world for thinking that a
particular, single source is outstanding and reliable. A better approach is
to scour current issues of independent financial publications, such as
Barron’s, Money Magazine, SmartMoney, and other publications (and
Web sites) listed in Appendix A.
 Gather data from the SEC. When you want to get more objective infor-
mation about a company, why not take a look at the reports that compa-
nies must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)? These
reports are the same reports that the pundits and financial reporters
read. Arguably, the most valuable report you can look at is the 10K. The
10K is a report that all publicly traded companies must file with the SEC.
It provides valuable information on the company’s operations and finan-
cial data, and it’s likely to be less biased than the information a company
includes in other corporate reports, such as an annual report.
To access 10K reports, go to the SEC’s Web site (www.sec.gov). From
there, you can find the SEC’s extensive database of public filings called
EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system). By
searching EDGAR, you can find companies’ balance sheets, income state-
ments, and other related information so that you can verify what others
say and get a fuller picture of what a company is doing and what its
financial condition is.

W
hen you’re ready to dive in and start investing in stocks, you first
have to choose a broker. It’s kind of like buying a car: You can do all
the research in the world and know exactly what kind of car you want to buy;
still, you need a venue to do the actual transaction. Similarly, when you want
to buy stock, your task is to do all the research you can to select the com-
pany you want to invest in. Still, you need a broker to actually buy the stock,
whether you buy over the phone or online. In this chapter, I set out to intro-
duce you to the intricacies of the investor/broker relationship.
For information on various types of orders you can place with a broker, such
as market orders, stop-loss orders, and so on, flip to Chapter 17.
Defining the Broker’s Role
The broker’s primary role is to serve as the vehicle through which you either
buy or sell stock. When I talk about brokers, I’m referring to organizations
such as Charles Schwab, Merrill Lynch, E*TRADE, and many other organiza-
tions that can buy stock on your behalf. Brokers can also be individuals who
work for such firms. Although you can buy some stocks directly from the
company that issues them (I discuss direct purchase plans in Chapter 18), to
purchase most stocks, you still need a broker.

Although the primary task of brokers is the buying and selling of securities
(keep in mind that the word securities refers to the world of financial or paper
investments, and that stocks are only a small part of that world), such as
stocks, they can perform other tasks for you, including the following:
 Providing advisory services: Investors pay brokers a fee for investment
advice. Customers also get access to the firm’s research.
 Offering limited banking services: Brokers can offer features such as
interest-bearing accounts, check writing, direct deposit, and credit
cards.
 Brokering other securities: Brokers can also buy bonds, mutual funds,
options, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), and other investments on your
behalf.
Personal stockbrokers make their money from individual investors like you
and me through various fees, including the following:
 Brokerage commissions: This fee is for buying and/or selling stocks and
other securities.
 Margin interest charges: This interest is charged to investors for bor-
rowing against their brokerage account for investment purposes.
 Service charges: These charges are for performing administrative tasks
and other functions. Brokers charge fees to investors for Individual
Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and for mailing stocks in certificate form.
Any broker you deal with should be registered with the National Association
of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC). In addition, to protect your money after you’ve deposited it into a bro-
kerage account, that broker should be a member of the Securities Investor
Protection Corporation (SIPC). SIPC doesn’t protect you from market losses;
it protects your money in case the brokerage firm goes out of business. To
find out whether the broker is registered with these organizations, contact
the NASD, SEC, and SIPC. (See Appendix A for information on these three
organizations.)
The distinction between personal stockbrokers and institutional stockbro-
kers is important. Institutional brokers make money from institutions and
companies through investment banking and securities placement fees (such
as initial public offerings and secondary offerings), advisory services, and
other broker services. Personal stockbrokers generally offer the same ser-
vices to individuals and small businesses.

Distinguishing between Full-Service 
and Discount Brokers
Stockbrokers fall into two basic categories: full-service and discount. The type
you choose really depends on what type of investor you are. In a nutshell, full-
service brokers are suitable for investors who need some guidance, while dis-
count brokers are better for those investors who are sufficiently confident and
knowledgeable about stock investing to manage with minimal help.
Full-service brokers
Full-service brokers are just what the name indicates. They try to provide as
many services as possible for investors who open accounts with them. When
you open an account at a brokerage firm, a representative is assigned to your
account. This representative is usually called an account executive, a regis-
tered rep, or a financial consultant by the brokerage firm. This person usually
has a securities license and is knowledgeable about stocks in particular and
investing in general.
What they can do for you
Your account executive is responsible for assisting you, answering questions
about your account and the securities in your portfolio, and transacting your
buy and sell orders. Here are some things that full-service brokers can do 
for you:
 Offer guidance and advice. The greatest distinction between full-ser-
vice brokers and discount brokers is the personal attention you receive
from your account rep. You get to be on a first-name basis with a full-ser-
vice broker, and you disclose much information about your finances and
financial goals. The rep is there to make recommendations about stocks
and funds that are hopefully suitable for you.
 Provide access to research. Full-service brokers can give you access to
their investment research department, which can give you in-depth
information and analysis on a particular company. This information can
be very valuable, but be aware of the pitfalls. (See the section “Judging
Brokers’ Recommendations,” later in this chapter.)
 Help you achieve your investment objectives. Beyond advice on spe-
cific investments, a good rep gets to know you and your investment
91
Chapter 7: Going for Brokers

goals and then offers advice and answers your questions about how spe-
cific investments and strategies can help you accomplish your wealth-
building goals.
 Make investment decisions on your behalf. Many investors don’t want
to be bothered when it comes to investment decisions. Full-service bro-
kers can actually make decisions for your account with your authoriza-
tion. This service is fine, but be sure to require them to explain their
choices to you.
What to watch out for
Although the full-service brokers, with their seemingly limitless assistance,
can make life easy for an investor, you need to remember some important
points to avoid problems:
 Brokers and account reps are still salespeople. No matter how well they
treat you, they’re still compensated based on their ability to produce
revenue for the brokerage firm. They generate commissions and fees
from you on behalf of the company. (In other words, they’re paid to sell
you things.)
 Whenever your rep makes a suggestion or recommendation, be sure to
ask why and request a complete answer that includes the reasoning
behind the recommendation. A good advisor is able to clearly explain
the reasoning behind every suggestion. If you don’t fully understand and
agree with the advice, don’t take it.
 Working with a full-service broker costs more than working with a dis-
count broker. Discount brokers are paid simply for performing the act of
buying or selling stocks for you. Full-service brokers do that and more.
Additionally, they provide advice and guidance. Because of that, full-
service brokers are more expensive (through higher brokerage commis-
sions and advisory fees). Also, most full-service brokers expect you to
invest at least $5,000 to $10,000 just to open an account.
 Handing over decision-making authority to your rep can be a possible
negative because letting others make financial decisions for you is
always dicey — especially when they’re using your money. If they make
poor investment choices that lose you money, you may not have any
recourse because you authorized them to act on your behalf.
 Some brokers engage in an activity called churning. Churning is basically
buying and selling stocks for the sole purpose of generating commis-
sions. Churning is great for brokers but bad for customers. If your
account shows a lot of activity, ask for justification. Commissions, espe-
cially by full-service brokers, can take a big bite out of your wealth, so
don’t tolerate churning or other suspicious activity.
92
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

Before you deal with any broker, full-service or otherwise, get a free report on
the broker from the National Association of Securities Dealers by calling
800-289-9999 or visiting the NASD Regulation Web site at www.nasdr.com.
The report can indicate whether any complaints or penalties have been filed
against that brokerage firm or the individual rep.
Examples of full-service brokers are Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Of
course, all brokers now have full-featured Web sites to give you further infor-
mation about their services. Get as informed as possible before you open
your account. A full-service broker is there to help you build wealth, not
make you . . . uh . . . broker.
Discount brokers
Perhaps you don’t need any hand-holding from a broker. You know what you
want, and you can make your own investment decisions. All you want is
someone to transact your buy/sell orders. In that case, go with a discount
broker. They don’t offer advice or premium services — just the basics
required to perform your stock transactions.
Discount brokers, as the name implies, are cheaper to engage than full-ser-
vice brokers. Because you’re advising yourself (or getting advice from third
parties such as newsletters or independent advisors), you can save on costs
that you incur when you pay for a full-service broker.
If you choose to work with a discount broker, you must know as much as pos-
sible about your personal goals and needs. You have a greater responsibility
for conducting adequate research to make good stock selections, and you
must be prepared to accept the outcome, whatever that may be.
For a while, the regular investor had two types of discount brokers to choose
from: conventional discount brokers and Internet discount brokers. But the
two are so similar now that the differences are hardly worth mentioning.
Conventional discount brokers primarily conducted business through regular
offices and over the phone, while Internet discount brokers conducted busi-
ness primarily through Web sites. But through industry consolidation, most of
the conventional discount brokers today have fully featured Web sites, while
Internet discount brokers adapted by adding more telephone and face-to-face
services.
Charles Schwab and TD Waterhouse are examples of conventional discount
brokers that have adapted well to the Internet era. Internet brokers such as
E*TRADE.com, Ameritrade.com, Scottrade.com, and Thinkorswim.com
have added more conventional services.
93
Chapter 7: Going for Brokers

What they can do for you
Discount brokers offer some significant advantages over full-service brokers,
such as:
 Lower cost: This lower cost is usually the result of lower commissions,
and it’s the primary benefit of using discount brokers.
 Unbiased service: Discount brokers offer you the ability to just transact
your stock buy and sell orders only. Since they don’t offer advice, they
have no vested interest in trying to sell you any particular stock.
 Access to information: Established discount brokers offer extensive
educational materials at their offices or on their Web sites.
What to watch out for
Of course, doing business with discount brokers also has its downside,
including the following:
 No guidance: Because you’ve chosen a discount broker, you know not to
expect guidance, but the broker should make this fact clear to you
anyway. If you’re a knowledgeable investor, the lack of advice is consid-
ered a positive thing — no interference.
 Hidden fees: Discount brokers may shout about their lower commis-
sions, but commissions aren’t their only way of making money. Many
discount brokers charge extra for services that you may think are
included, such as issuing a stock certificate or mailing a statement. Ask
whether they assess fees for maintaining IRAs or fees for transferring
stocks and other securities (such as bonds) in or out of your account,
and find out what interest rates they charge for borrowing through bro-
kerage accounts.
 Minimal customer service: If you deal with an Internet brokerage firm,
find out about its customer service capability. If you can’t transact busi-
ness at its Web site, find out where you can call for assistance with your
order.
Choosing a Broker
Before you choose a broker, you need to analyze your personal investing
style. After you know yourself and the way you invest, then you can proceed
to finding the kind of broker that fits your needs. It’s almost like choosing
shoes; if you don’t know your size, you can’t get a proper fit. (And you can be
in for a really uncomfortable future.)
94
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

When it’s time to choose a broker, keep the following points in mind:
 Match your investment style with a brokerage firm that charges the least
amount of money for the services you’re likely to use most frequently.
 Compare all the costs of buying, selling, and holding stocks and other
securities through a broker. Don’t compare only commissions. Compare
other costs, too, such as margin interest and other service charges.
 Use broker comparison services such as Gomez Advisors at
www.gomez.com and read articles that compare brokers in publications
such as SmartMoney and Barron’s. Check out Appendix A for a list of
sources that compare brokers.
Finding brokers is easy. They’re listed in the Yellow Pages as well as in many
investment publications and on many financial Web sites. Start your search
by using the sources in Appendix A, which includes a list of the major broker-
age firms.
Discovering Various Types 
of Brokerage Accounts
When you decide to start investing in the stock market, you have to some-
how actually pay for the stocks you buy. Most brokerage firms offer investors
several different types of accounts, each serving a different purpose. I pre-
sent three of the most common types in the following sections. The basic dif-
ference boils down to how particular brokers view your “creditworthiness”
when it comes to buying and selling securities. If your credit isn’t great, your
only choice is a cash account. If your credit is good, you can open either a
cash account or a margin account. Once you qualify for a margin account,
you can (with additional approval) upgrade it to do options trades.
To open an account, you have to fill out an application and submit a check or
money order for at least the minimum amount required to establish an account.
Cash accounts
A cash account (also referred to as a Type 1 account) means just what you
think it means. You must deposit a sum of money along with the new account
application to begin trading. The amount of your initial deposit varies from
broker to broker. Some brokers have a minimum of $10,000, while others let
95
Chapter 7: Going for Brokers

you open an account for as little as $500. Once in a while you may see a broker
offering cash accounts with no minimum deposit, usually as part of a promo-
tion. Use the resources in Appendix A to help you shop around. Qualifying for
a cash account is usually easy as long as you have cash and a pulse.
With a cash account, your money has to be deposited in the account before
the closing (or settlement) date for any trade you make. The closing occurs
three business days after the date you make the trade (the date of execution).
You may be required to have the money in the account even before the date of
execution. See Chapter 6 for details on these and other important dates. 
In other words, if you call your broker on Monday, October 10, and order 50
shares of CashLess Corp. at $20 per share, then on Thursday, October 13, you
better have $1,000 in cash sitting in your account (plus commission).
Otherwise, the purchase doesn’t go through.
If you have cash in a brokerage account, see whether the broker will pay you
interest on the uninvested cash in it. Some offer a service in which unin-
vested money earns money market rates and you can even make a choice
about whether the venue is a regular money market account or a tax-free
municipal money market account.
Margin accounts
A margin account (also called a Type 2 account) gives you the ability to
borrow money against the securities in the account to buy more stock.
Because you have the ability to borrow in a margin account, you have to be
qualified and approved by the broker. After you’re approved, this newfound
credit gives you more leverage so that you can buy more stock or do short-
selling. (You can read more about buying on margin and short-selling in
Chapter 17.)
For stock trading, the margin limit is 50 percent. For example, if you plan to
buy $10,000 worth of stock on margin, you need at least $5,000 in cash (or
securities owned) sitting in your account. The interest rate that you pay
varies depending on the broker, but most brokers generally charge a rate
that’s several points higher than their own borrowing rate.
Why use margin? Margin is to stocks what mortgage is to buying real estate.
You can buy real estate with all cash, but many times, using borrowed funds
makes sense since you may not have enough money to make a 100% cash pur-
chase or you prefer not to pay all cash. With margin, you could, for example,
be able to buy $10,000 worth of stock with as little as $5,000. The balance of
the stock purchase is acquired using a loan (margin) from the brokerage firm.
96
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

Option accounts
An option account (also referred to as a Type 3 account) gives you all the
capabilities of a margin account (which in turn also gives you the capabilities
of a cash account) plus the ability to trade options on stocks and stock
indexes. To upgrade your margin account to an options account, the broker
usually asks you to sign a statement that you’re knowledgeable about options
and familiar with the risks associated with them.
Options can be a very effective addition to a stock investor’s array of wealth-
building investment tools. A more comprehensive review of options is avail-
able in the book Stock Options For Dummies by Alan R. Simon (Wiley).
Judging Brokers’ Recommendations
In recent years, Americans have become enamored with a new sport: the
rating of stocks by brokers on the television financial shows. Frequently
these shows feature a dapper market strategist talking up a particular stock.
Some stocks have been known to jump significantly right after an influential
analyst issues a buy recommendation. Analysts’ speculation and opinions
make for great fun, and many people take their views very seriously.
However, most investors should be very wary when analysts, especially the
glib ones on TV, make a recommendation. It’s often just showbiz.
Brokers issue their recommendations (advice) as a general idea of how much
regard they have for a particular stock. The following list presents the basic
recommendations (or ratings) and what they mean to you:
 Strong buy and buy: Hot diggity dog! These ratings are the ones to get.
The analyst loves this pick, and you would be very wise to get a bunch
of shares. The thing to keep in mind, however, is that buy recommenda-
tions are probably the most common because (let’s face it) brokers sell
stocks.
 Accumulate and market perform: An analyst who issues these types of
recommendations is positive, yet unexcited, about the pick. This rating
is akin to asking a friend whether he likes your new suit and getting the
response “it’s nice” in a monotone voice. It’s a polite reply, but you wish
his opinion had been more enthusiastic.
 Hold or neutral: Analysts use this language when their backs are to the
wall, but they still don’t want to say, “Sell that loser!” This recommendation
reminds me of my mother telling me to be nice and either say something
97
Chapter 7: Going for Brokers

positive or keep my mouth shut. In this case, this rating is the analyst’s
way of keeping his mouth shut.
 Sell: Many analysts should have issued this recommendation during
2000 and 2001, but few actually uttered it. What a shame. So many
investors lost money because some analysts were too nice or just afraid
to be honest and sound the alarm and urge people to sell.
 Avoid like the plague: I’m just kidding about this one, but I wish that
this recommendation was available. I’ve seen plenty of stocks that I
thought were dreadful investments — stocks of companies that made no
money and were in terrible financial condition that should never have
been considered at all. Yet investors gobble up billions of dollars’ worth
of stocks that eventually become worthless.
Don’t get me wrong. An analyst’s recommendation is certainly a better tip
than what you’d get from your barber or your sister-in-law’s neighbor, but
you want to view recommendations from analysts with a healthy dose of real-
ity. Analysts have biases because their employment depends on the very
companies that are being presented. What investors need to listen to when a
broker talks up a stock is the reasoning behind the recommendation. In other
words, why is the broker making this recommendation?
Keep in mind that analysts’ recommendations can play a useful role in your
personal stock investing research. If you find a great stock and then you hear
analysts give glowing reports on the same stock, you’re on the right track!
Here are some questions and points to keep in mind:
 How does the analyst arrive at a rating? The analyst’s approach to
evaluating a stock can help you round out your research as you consult
other sources such as newsletters and independent advisory services.
 What analytical approach is the analyst using? Some analysts use fun-
damental analysis (looking at the company’s financial condition and fac-
tors related to its success, such as its standing within the industry and
the overall market). Other analysts use technical analysis (looking at the
company’s stock price history and judging past stock price movements
to derive some insight regarding the stock’s future price movement).
Many analysts use a combination of the two. Is this analyst’s approach
similar to your approach or to those of sources that you respect or
admire?
 What is the analyst’s track record? Has the analyst had a consistently
good record through both bull and bear markets? Major financial publi-
cations, such as Barron’s and Hulbert Financial Digest, and Web sites,
such as MarketWatch.com, regularly track recommendations from well-
known analysts and stock pickers.
98
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

 How does the analyst treat important aspects of the company’s perfor-
mance, such as sales and earnings? How about the company’s balance
sheet? The essence of a healthy company is growing sales and earnings
coupled with strong assets and low debt.
 Is the industry that the company is in doing well? Do the analysts give
you insight on this important information? A strong company in a weak
industry can’t stay strong for long.
 What research sources does the analyst cite? Does the analyst quote
the federal government or industry trade groups to support her thesis?
These sources are important because they help give a more complete
picture regarding the company’s prospects for success. Imagine that you
decide on the stock of a strong company. But what if the federal govern-
ment (through agencies such as the SEC) is penalizing the company for
fraudulent activity? Or what if the company’s industry is shrinking or has
ceased to grow (making it tougher for the company to continue growing)?
The astute investor looks at a variety of sources before buying stock.
 Is the analyst rational when citing a target price for a stock? When she
says, “We think the stock will hit $100 per share within 12 months,” is
she presenting a rational model, such as basing the share price on a pro-
jected price/earnings ratio? The analyst must be able to provide a logi-
cal scenario about why the stock has a good chance of achieving the
cited target price within the time frame mentioned. You may not neces-
sarily agree with the analyst’s conclusion, but the explanation can help
you decide whether the stock choice was well thought out.
 Does the company that is being recommended have any ties to the
analyst or the analyst’s firm? During 2000–2002, the financial industry
got bad publicity because many analysts gave positive recommenda-
tions on stocks of companies that were doing business with the very
firms that employed those analysts. This conflict of interest is probably
the biggest reason that analysts were so wrong in their recommenda-
tions during that period. Ask your broker to disclose any conflict of
interest.
The bottom line with brokerage recommendations is that you shouldn’t use
them to buy or sell a stock. Instead, use them to confirm your own research. I
know that if I buy a stock based on my own research and later discover the
same stock being talked up on the financial shows, that’s just the icing on the
cake. The experts may be great to listen to, and their recommendations can
augment your own opinions; however, they’re no substitute for your own
careful research.

Investing for Growth
In This Chapter
 Defining growth stocks
 Figuring out how to choose growth stocks
 Looking at small-caps and other speculative investments
W
hat’s the number one reason people invest in stocks? To grow their
wealth (also referred to as capital appreciation). Yes, some people
invest for income (in the form of dividends), but that’s a different matter han-
dled in Chapter 9. Investors seeking growth would rather see the money that
could have been distributed as dividends be reinvested in the company so
that (hopefully) a greater gain is achieved by seeing the stock’s price rise or
appreciate. People interested in growing their wealth see stocks as one of the
convenient ways to do it. Growth stocks tend to be riskier than other cate-
gories of stocks, but they offer excellent long-term prospects for making the
big bucks. If you don’t believe me, then just ask Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch,
and other successful investors. Although someone like Warren Buffett is not
considered a “growth” investor, his long-term, value-oriented approach has
been a successful growth strategy. If you’re the type of investor who has
enough time to let somewhat-risky stocks trend upward, or who has enough
money so that a loss won’t devastate you financially, then growth stocks are
definitely for you. As they say, no guts, no glory. The challenge is to figure out
which stocks will make you richer quicker.
Short of starting your own business, stock investing is the best way to profit
from a business venture. I want to emphasize that to make money in stocks
consistently over the long haul, you must remember that you’re investing in a
company; buying the stock is just a means for you to participate in the com-
pany’s success (or failure).
What does it matter that you think of stock investing as buying a company
versus buying a stock? Invest in a stock only if you’re just as excited about it
as you would be if you were the CEO and in charge of running the company. If

you’re the sole owner of the company, do you act differently than one of a
legion of obscure stockholders? Of course you do. As the owner of the com-
pany, you have a greater interest in the company. You have a strong desire to
know how the enterprise is doing. As you invest in stocks, make believe that
you’re the owner, and take an active interest in the company’s products, ser-
vices, sales, earnings, and so on. This attitude and discipline can enhance
your goals as a stock investor. This approach is especially important if your
investment goal is growth.
Becoming a Value-Oriented 
Growth Investor
A stock is considered a growth stock when it’s growing faster and higher than
the overall stock market. Basically, a growth stock performs better than its
peers in categories such as sales and earnings. Value stocks are stocks that
are priced lower than the value of the company and its assets — you can
identify a value stock by analyzing the company’s fundamentals and looking
at key financial ratios, such as the price-to-earnings ratio. (For more on the
topic of ratios, see Appendix B.) Growth stocks tend to have better prospects
for growth for the immediate future (from one to four years), but value stocks
tend to have less risk and more steady growth over a longer term.
Over the years, a debate has quietly raged in the financial community about
growth versus value investing. Some people believe that growth and value
are mutually exclusive. They maintain that large numbers of people buying
stock with growth as the expectation tend to drive up the stock price relative
to the company’s current value. Growth investors, for example, aren’t put off
by price to earnings (P/E) ratios of 30, 40, or higher. Value investors, mean-
while, are too nervous buying a stock at those P/E ratio levels.
However, you can have both. A value-oriented approach to growth investing
serves you best. Long-term growth stock investors spend time analyzing the
company’s fundamentals to make sure that the company’s growth prospects
lie on a solid foundation. But what if you have to choose between a growth
stock and a value stock? Which do you choose? Seek value when you are
buying the stock and analyze the company’s prospects for growth. Growth
includes but is not limited to the health and growth of the company’s specific
industry and the economy at large (see Chapters 12, 13, and 14).
The bottom line is that growth is much easier to achieve when you seek
solid, value-oriented companies in growing industries. To better understand
industries and how they affect stock value, see Chapter 12.
102
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

Being a value-oriented growth investor probably has the longest history of
success versus most other stock investing philosophies. The track record for
those people who use value-oriented growth investing is enviable. Warren
Buffett, Benjamin Graham, John Templeton, and Peter Lynch are a few of the
more well-known practitioners. Each may have his own spin on the concepts,
but all have successfully applied the basic principles of value-oriented
growth investing over many years.
Getting Tips for Choosing Growth Stocks
Although the information in the previous section can help you shrink your
stock choices from thousands of stocks to maybe a few dozen or a few hun-
dred (depending on how well the general stock market is doing), the purpose
of this section is to help you cull the so-so growth stocks to unearth the go-go
ones. It’s time to dig deeper for the biggest potential winners. Keep in mind
that you probably won’t find a stock to satisfy all the criteria presented here.
Just make sure that your selection meets as many criteria as realistically pos-
sible. But hey, if you do find a stock that meets all the criteria cited, buy as
much as you can!
When choosing growth stocks, you should consider investing in a company
only if it makes a profit and if you understand how it makes that profit and
from where it generates sales. Part of your research means looking at the
industry (Chapter 12) and economic trends in general.
Making the right comparison
You have to measure the growth of a company against something to figure
out whether it’s a growth stock. Usually, you compare the growth of a com-
pany with growth from other companies in the same industry or with the
stock market in general. In practical terms, when you measure the growth of
a stock against the stock market, you’re actually comparing it against a gener-
ally accepted benchmark, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) or
the Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500). For more on DJIA or S&P 500, see
Chapter 5.
If a company has earnings growth of 15 percent per year over three years or
more, and the industry’s average growth rate over the same time frame is 10
percent, then this stock qualifies as a growth stock.
A growth stock is called that not only because the company is growing but
also because the company is performing well with some consistency. Having a
single year where your earnings do well versus the S&P 500’s average doesn’t
cut it. Growth must be consistently accomplished.
103
Chapter 8: Investing for Growth

Checking out a company’s fundamentals
When you hear the word fundamentals in the world of stock investing, it
refers to the company’s financial condition and related data. When investors
(especially value investors) do fundamental analysis, they look at the com-
pany’s fundamentals — its balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, and
other operational data, along with external factors such as the company’s
market position, industry, and economic prospects. Essentially, the funda-
mentals indicate the company’s financial condition. Chapter 10 goes into
greater detail about analyzing a company’s financial condition. However, the
main numbers you want to look at include the following:
 Sales: Are the company’s sales this year surpassing last year’s? As a
decent benchmark, you want to see sales at least 10 percent higher than
last year. Although it may differ depending on the industry, 10 percent is
a reasonable, general “yardstick.”
 Earnings: Are earnings at least 10 percent higher than last year?
Earnings should grow at the same rate as sales (or, hopefully, better).
 Debt: Is the company’s total debt equal to or lower than the prior year?
The death knell of many a company has been excessive debt.
A company’s financial condition has more factors than I mention here, but
these numbers are the most important. I also realize that using the 10 percent
figure may seem like an oversimplification, but you don’t need to complicate
matters unnecessarily. I know someone’s computerized financial model may
come out to 9.675 percent or maybe 11.07 percent, but keep it simple for now.
Looking for leaders and megatrends
A strong company in a growing industry is a common recipe for success. If
you look at the history of stock investing, this point comes up constantly.
Investors need to be on the alert for megatrends because they help ensure
your success.
What is a megatrend? A megatrend is a major development that has huge
implications for much (if not all) of society for a long time to come. Good
examples are the advent of the Internet and the aging of America. Both of
these trends offer significant challenges and opportunities for our economy.
Take the Internet, for example. Its potential for economic application is still
being developed. Millions are flocking to it for many reasons. And census
data tells us that senior citizens (over 65) will be the fastest growing segment
of our population during the next 20 years. How does the stock investor take
advantage of a megatrend?
104
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

In the wake of the 2000–2002 stock bear market, two megatrends hit their
stride: rising energy prices and an overheated housing market. As of 2005,
these two issues became major news items with tremendous ripple effects
across the national economy. For the growth investor, strategy became clear.
Find value-oriented companies with solid fundamentals that are well-posi-
tioned to benefit from these megatrends. What’s the result? From 2002–2005,
many energy-related and housing-related stocks skyrocketed. As oil sur-
passed $65 a barrel and gasoline hit $3 a gallon, most oil and oil services
companies saw their stocks go up 50 percent, 100 percent, and more during
that three-year time frame. Housing stocks were even more impressive. In
addition, companies that cater to these industries also prospered. Mortgage
firms that were publicly traded also posted impressive gains.
Considering a company 
with a strong niche
Companies that have established a strong niche are consistently profitable.
Look for a company with one or more of the following characteristics:
 A strong brand: Companies such as Coca-Cola and Microsoft come to
mind. Yes, other companies out there can make soda or software, but a
business needs a lot more than a similar product to topple companies
that have established an almost irrevocable identity with the public.
 High barriers to entry: United Parcel Service and Federal Express have
set up tremendous distribution and delivery networks that competitors
can’t easily duplicate. High barriers to entry offer an important edge to
companies that are already established.
 Research and development (R&D): Companies such as Pfizer and
Merck spend a lot of money researching and developing new pharma-
ceutical products. This investment becomes a new product with millions
of consumers who become loyal purchasers, so the company’s going 
to grow.
Noticing who’s buying and/or 
recommending the stock
You can invest in a great company and still see its stock go nowhere. Why?
Because what makes the stock go up is demand — having more buyers than
sellers of the stock. If you pick a stock for all the right reasons, and the
105
Chapter 8: Investing for Growth

market notices the stock as well, that attention causes the stock price to
climb. The things to watch for include the following:
 Institutional buying: Are mutual funds and pension plans buying up the
stock you’re looking at? If so, this type of buying power can exert
tremendous upward pressure on the stock’s price. Some resources and
publications track institutional buying and how that affects any particu-
lar stock. (You can find these resources in Appendix A.) Frequently,
when a mutual fund buys a stock, others soon follow. In spite of all the
talk about independent research, a herd mentality still exists.
 Analysts’ attention: Are analysts talking about the stock on the financial
shows? As much as you should be skeptical about an analyst’s recom-
mendation (given the stock market debacle of 2000–2002), it offers some
positive reinforcement for your stock. Don’t ever buy a stock solely on
the basis of an analyst’s recommendation. Just know that if you buy a
stock based on your own research, and analysts subsequently rave
about it, your stock price is likely to go up. A single recommendation by
an influential analyst can be enough to send a stock skyward.
 Newsletter recommendations: Independent researchers usually publish
newsletters. If influential newsletters are touting your choice, that praise
is also good for your stock. Although some great newsletters are out
there (find them in Appendix A), and they offer information that’s as
good or better than the research departments of some brokerage firms,
don’t use a single tip to base your investment decision on. But it should
make you feel good if the newsletters tout a stock that you’ve already
chosen.
 Consumer publications: No, you won’t find investment advice here. This
one seems to come out of left field, but it’s a source that you should
notice. Publications such as Consumer Reports regularly look at products
and services and rate them for consumer satisfaction. If a company’s
offerings are well received by consumers, that’s a strong positive for the
company. This kind of attention ultimately has a positive effect on that
company’s stock.
Learning investing lessons from history
A growth stock isn’t a creature like the Loch Ness monster — always talked
about but rarely seen. Growth stocks have been part of the financial scene for
nearly a century. Examples abound that offer rich information that you can
apply to today’s stock market environment. Look at past market winners,
especially those of the 1970s and 1980s, and ask yourself, “What made them
profitable stocks?” I mention these two decades because they offer a stark
106
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

contrast to one another. The ’70s were a tough, bearish decade for stocks,
while the ’80s were booming bull times. (See Chapter 15 for details on bear
and bull markets.) Being aware and acting logically are as vital to successful
stock investing as they are to any other pursuit. Over and over again, history
gives you the formula for successful stock investing:
 Pick a company that has strong fundamentals, including signs such as
rising sales and earnings and low debt. (See Chapter 10.)
 Make sure that the company is in a growing industry. (See Chapter 12.)
 Be fully invested in stocks during a bull market, when prices are rising in
the stock market and in the general economy. (See Chapter 15.)
 During a bear market, switch more of your money out of growth stocks
(such as technology) and into defensive stocks (such as utilities).
 Monitor your stocks. Hold on to stocks that continue to grow, and sell
those stocks that are declining. (See Chapter 21 for some warning sig-
nals to watch out for.)
Evaluating the management of a company
The management of a company is crucial to its success. Before you buy stock
in a company, you want to know that the company’s management is doing a
great job. But how do you do that? If you call up a company and ask, it may
not even return your phone call. How do you know whether management is
running the company properly? The best way is to check the numbers. The
following sections tell you the numbers you need to check. If the company’s
management is running the business well, the ultimate result is a rising stock
price.
Return on equity
Although you can measure how well management is doing in several ways,
you can take a quick snapshot of a management team’s competence by
checking the company’s return on equity (ROE). You calculate the ROE
simply by dividing earnings by equity. The resulting percentage gives you a
good idea whether the company is using its equity (or net assets) efficiently
and profitably. Basically, the higher the percentage, the better, but you can
consider the ROE solid if the percentage is 10 percent or higher. Keep in mind
that not all industries have identical ROEs.
To find out a company’s earnings, check out the company’s income state-
ment. The income statement is a simple financial statement that expresses the
equation: sales less expenses equal net earnings (or net income or net profit).
107
Chapter 8: Investing for Growth

You can see an example of an income statement in Table 8-1. (I give more
details on income statements in Chapter 10.)

Net earnings

To find out a company’s equity, check out that company’s balance sheet. (See
Chapter 10 for more details on balance sheets.) The balance sheet is actually
a simple financial statement that illustrates total assets minus total liabilities
equal net equity. For public stock companies, the net assets are called “share-
holders’ equity” or simply “equity.” Table 8-2 shows a balance sheet for
Grobaby, Inc.

Table 8-1 shows that Grobaby’s earnings went from $7,000 to $12,000. In Table
8-2, you can see that Grobaby increased the equity from $35,000 to $40,000 in
one year. The ROE for the year 2005 is 20 percent ($7,000 in earnings divided
by $35,000 in equity), which is a solid number. The following year, the ROE is
30 percent ($12,000 in earnings divided by $40,000 equity), another solid
number.
Equity and earnings growth
Two additional barometers of success are a company’s growth in earnings
and growth of equity. Look at the growth in earnings in Table 8-1. The earn-
ings grew from $7,000 (in 2005) to $12,000 (in 2006), or a percentage increase
of 71 percent ($12,000 less $7,000 equals $5,000, and $5,000 divided by $7,000
is 71 percent), which is excellent. In Table 8-2, Grobaby’s equity grew by
108
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

$5,000 (from $35,000 to $40,000), or 14 percent, which is very good — 
management is doing good things here.
Insider buying
Watching management as it manages the business is important, but another
indicator of how well the company is doing is to see whether management is
buying stock in the company as well. If a company is poised for growth, who
knows better than management? And if management is buying up the com-
pany’s stock en masse, then that’s a great indicator of the stock’s potential.
See Chapter 19 for more details on insider trading.
109
Chapter 8: Investing for Growth
Protecting your downside
I become a Johnny-one-note on one topic: trail-
ing stops. (See Chapter 17 for a full explanation
of trailing stops.) Trailing stops are stop losses
that you regularly manage with the stock you
invest in. I always advocate using them, espe-
cially if you’re new to the game of buying
growth stocks. Trailing stops can help you, no
matter how good or bad the economy is (or how
good or bad the stock you’re investing in is).
Suppose that you had invested in Enron, a clas-
sic example of a phenomenal growth stock that
went bad. In 1999 and 2000, when its stock
soared, investors were as happy as choco-
holics at Hershey. Along with many investors
who forgot that sound investing takes disci-
pline and research, Enron investors thought,
“Downside risk? What downside risk?”
Here’s an example of how a stop-loss order
would have worked if you had invested in Enron.
Suppose that you bought Enron in 2000 at $50
per share and put in a stop-loss order with your
broker at $45. (Remember to make it a GTC or
good-till-canceled order. If you do, the stop-loss
order stays on indefinitely.) As a general rule, I
like to place the stop-loss order at 10 percent
below the market value. As the stock went up,
you kept the stop-loss trailing upward like a tail.
(Now you know why it’s called a “trailing” stop;
it trails the stock’s price.) When Enron hit $70,
your stop-loss was changed to, say, $63, and so
on. At $84, your new stop-loss was at $76. Then
what?
When Enron started its perilous descent, you
got out at $76. The new price of $76 triggered
the stop-loss, and the stock was automatically
sold — you stopped the loss! Actually, in this
case, you could call it a “stop and cash in the
gain” order. Because you bought the stock at
$50 and sold at $76, you pocketed a nice capital
gain of $26 (52 percent appreciation — a do-
Enron-ron a do-en-ron!). Then you safely
stepped aside and watched the stock continue
its plunge.
But what if the market is doing well? Are trail-
ing stops a good idea? Because these stops are
placed below the stock price, you’re not stop-
ping the stock from rising upward indefinitely.
All you’re doing is protecting your investment
from loss. That’s discipline! The stock market of
2004–2005 was fairly good to stock investors as
the bear market that started in 2000 took a
break. If a bear market continues, trailing stop
strategies will again become very useful
because a potential decline in the stock price
will become a greater risk.

Making sure a company 
continues to do well
A company’s financial situation does change, and you, as a diligent investor,
need to continue to look at the numbers for as long as the stock is in your
portfolio. You may have chosen a great stock from a great company with
great numbers in 2003, but chances are pretty good that the numbers have
changed since then.
Great stocks don’t always stay that way. A great selection that you’re drawn
to today may become tomorrow’s pariah. Information, both good and bad,
moves like lightning. In late 2000, analysts considered Enron a cream-of-the-
crop stock, and they fell over themselves extolling its virtues. Even the then-
celebrated market strategist Abby Joseph Cohen called Enron her number
one choice in the energy sector as late as September 2001. Yet Enron shocked
investors when it filed for bankruptcy in December 2001. Its stock price fell
from $84 in December 2000 to a staggering 26 cents a share (yikes!) in
October 2001! Keep an eye on your stock company’s numbers!
Exploring Small-caps and 
Speculative Stocks
Everyone wants to get in early on a hot new stock. Why not? You buy
Shlobotky, Inc., at $1 per share and hope it zooms to $98 before lunchtime.
Who doesn’t want to buy a stock that could become the next IBM or Microsoft?
This possibility is why investors are attracted to small-cap stocks.
Small-cap (or small-capitalization) is a reference to the company’s market
size. Small-cap stocks are stocks that have a market value under $1 billion.
Investors may face more risk with small-caps, but they also have the chance
for greater gains.
Out of all the types of stocks, small-cap stocks continue to exhibit the great-
est amount of growth. In the same way that a tree planted last year has more
opportunity for growth than a mature 100-year-old redwood, small-caps have
greater growth potential than established large-cap stocks. Of course, a small-
cap doesn’t exhibit spectacular growth just because it’s small. It grows when
it does the right things, such as increasing sales and earnings by producing
goods and services that customers want.
110
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

For every small company that becomes a Fortune 500 firm, hundreds of com-
panies don’t grow at all or go out of business. When you try to guess the next
great stock before any evidence of growth, you’re not investing — you’re
speculating. Have you heard that one before? (If not, flip to Chapter 2 for
details.) Of course you have, and you’ll hear it again. Don’t get me wrong —
there’s nothing wrong with speculating. But it’s important to know that you’re
speculating when you’re doing it. If you’re going to speculate in small stocks
hoping for the next Cisco Systems, then use the guidelines I present in the fol-
lowing sections to increase your chances of success.
Avoid IPOs, unless . . .
Initial public offerings (IPOs) are the birthplace of public stocks, or the
proverbial ground floor. The IPO is the first offering to the public of a com-
pany’s stock. The IPO is also referred to as “going public.” Because a com-
pany’s going public is frequently an unproven enterprise, investing in an IPO
can be risky. Here are the two types of IPOs:
 Start-up IPO: This is a company that didn’t exist before the IPO. In other
words, the entrepreneurs get together and create a business plan. To get
the financing they need for the company, they decide to go public imme-
diately by approaching an investment banker. If the investment banker
thinks that it’s a good concept, the banker will seek funding (selling the
stock to investors) via the IPO.
111
Chapter 8: Investing for Growth
Don’t rush to buy IPO stock
When a company goes public, it means that it
undergoes an initial public offering (IPO). The
IPO is the process by which a private firm seeks
the assistance of an investment banking firm to
gain financing by issuing stock that the public
purchases. IPOs generate a lot of excitement,
and many investors consider the IPO to be that
proverbial ground-floor opportunity. After all,
some people find it appealing to get a stock
before its price skyrockets after investors sub-
sequently flock to it. Why wouldn’t people find
IPOs appealing?
IPOs actually have a poor track record of suc-
cess in their first year. Studies periodically done
by the brokerage industry have revealed that
IPOs (more times than not) actually decline in
price during the first 12 months 60 percent of the
time. In other words, an IPO has a better than
even chance of dropping in price. The lesson for
investors is that they’re better off waiting to see
how the stock and the company perform. Don’t
worry about missing that great opportunity; if it’s
a bona fide opportunity, you’ll still do well after
the IPO.

 A private company that decides to go public: In many cases, the IPO is
done for a company that already exists and is seeking expansion capital.
The company may have been around for a long time as a smaller private
concern, but it decides to seek funding through an IPO to grow even
larger (or to fund a new product, promotional expenses, and so on).
Which of the two IPOs do you think is less risky? That’s right! The private
company going public. Why? Because it’s already a proven business, which is
a safer bet than a brand-new start-up. Some great examples of successful
IPOs in recent years are United Parcel Service and Google (they were both
established companies before they went public).
Great stocks started as small companies going public. You may be able to
recount the stories of Federal Express, Dell, AOL, Home Depot, and hundreds
of other great successes. But do you remember an IPO by the company
Lipschitz & Farquar? No? I didn’t think so. It’s among the majority of IPOs
that don’t succeed. For investors, the lesson is clear: Wait until a track record
appears before you invest in a company. If you don’t, you’re simply rolling
the dice (in other words, you’re speculating, not investing!).
If it’s a small-cap stock, make sure 
it’s making money
I emphasize two points when investing in stocks:
 Make sure that a company is established. (Being in business for at least
three years is a good minimum.)
 Make sure that a company is profitable.
These points are especially important for investors in small stocks. Plenty of
start-up ventures lose money but hope to make a fortune down the road. A
good example is a company in the biotechnology industry. Biotech is an excit-
ing area, but it’s esoteric, and at this early stage, companies are finding it diffi-
cult to use the technology in profitable ways. You may say, “But shouldn’t I
jump in now in anticipation of future profits?” You may get lucky, but under-
stand that when you invest in unproven, small-cap stocks, you’re speculating.
Investing in small-cap stocks 
requires analysis
The only difference between a small-cap stock and a large-cap stock is a few
zeros in their numbers and the fact that you need to do more research with
small-caps. By sheer dint of size, small-caps are riskier than large-caps, so
112
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

you offset the risk by accruing more information on yourself and the stock in
question. Plenty of information is available on large-cap stocks because
they’re widely followed. Small-cap stocks don’t get as much press, and fewer
analysts issue reports on them. Here are a few points to keep in mind:
 Understand your investment style. Small-cap stocks may have more
potential rewards, but they also carry more risk. No investor should
devote a large portion of his capital to small-cap stocks. If you’re consid-
ering retirement money, you’re better off investing in large-cap stocks,
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), investment-grade bonds, bank accounts,
and mutual funds. For example, retirement money should be in invest-
ments that are either very safe or have proven track records of steady
growth over an extended period of time (five years or longer).
 Check with the SEC. Get the financial reports that the company must
file with the SEC (such as its 10Ks and 10Qs — see Chapter 6 for more
details). These reports offer more complete information on the com-
pany’s activities and finances. Go to the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov
and check its massive database of company filings at EDGAR (Electronic
Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system). You can also check to
see whether any complaints have been filed against the company.
 Check other sources. See whether brokers and independent research
services, such as Value Line, follow the stock. If two or more different
sources like the stock, it’s worth further investigation. Check the
resources in Appendix A for further sources of information before you
invest.

Investing for Income
In This Chapter
 Defining income stocks

 Looking at some typical income stocks
I
nvesting for income means investing in stocks that provide you with regu-
lar money payments (dividends). Income stocks may not offer stellar
growth, but they’re good for a steady infusion of money. What type of person
is best suited to income stocks? Income stocks can be appropriate for many
investors, but they’re especially well suited for the following individuals:
 Conservative and novice investors: Conservative investors like to see a
slow-but-steady approach to growing their money while getting regular
dividend checks. Novice investors who want to start slowly also benefit
from income stocks.
 Retirees: Growth investing is best suited for long-term needs, while
income investing is best suited to current needs. Retirees may want
some growth in their portfolios, but they’re more concerned with regu-
lar income that can keep pace with inflation.
 Dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) investors: For those investors who
like to compound their money with DRPs, income stocks are perfect. For
more information on DRPs, see Chapter 18.
If you have a low tolerance for risk or if your investment goal is anything less
than long-term, income stocks are your best bet.
Getting your stock portfolio to yield more income is easier than you think.
Many income investors increase income using proven techniques such as
Covered call writing. Covered call writing is an option strategy that is covered
more fully in sources such as Stock Options For Dummies (Wiley). You can also
find great educational material on this option strategy (and many others) at
places such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (www.cboe.com).

Understanding Income Stocks
When people talk about gaining income from stocks, they’re usually talking
about dividends. A dividend is nothing more than money paid out to the
owner of stock. You purchase dividend stocks primarily for income — not for
spectacular growth potential.
A dividend is quoted as an annual number but is usually paid on a quarterly
basis. For example, if the stock pays a dividend of $4, you’re probably paid $1
every quarter. If, in this example, you have 200 shares, you’re paid $800 every
year (if the dividend doesn’t change during that period), or $200 per quarter.
Getting that regular dividend check every three months (for as long as you
hold the stock) can be a nice perk.
A good income stock is a stock that has a higher-than-average dividend (typi-
cally 4 percent or higher).
Dividend rates aren’t guaranteed — they can go up or down, or, in some
extreme cases, the dividend can be discontinued. Fortunately, most compa-
nies that issue dividends continue them indefinitely and actually increase div-
idend payments from time to time. Historically, dividend increases have
equaled (or exceeded) the rate of inflation.
Advantages of income stocks
Income stocks tend to be among the least volatile of all stocks, and many
investors view them as defensive stocks. Defensive stocks are stocks of com-
panies that sell goods and services that are generally needed no matter what
shape the economy is in. (Don’t confuse defensive stocks with defense stocks,
which specialize in goods and equipment for the military.) Food, beverage,
and utility companies are great examples of defensive stocks. Even when the
economy is experiencing tough times, people still need to eat, drink, and turn
the lights on. Companies that offer relatively high dividends also tend to be
large firms in established, stable industries.
Some industries in particular are known for high-dividend stocks. Utilities
(such as electric, gas, and water), real estate investment trusts (REITs), and
the energy sector (oil and gas) are places where you definitely find income
stocks. Yes, you can find high-dividend stocks in other industries, but you
find a high concentration of them in these industries. For more details, see
the sections highlighting these industries later in this chapter.
116
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

Disadvantages of income stocks
Before you say, “Income stocks are great! I’ll get my checkbook and buy a
batch right now,” take a look at some potential disadvantages (ugh!). Income
stocks do come with some fine print.
What goes up . . .
Income stocks can go down as well as up, just as any stock can. Obviously,
you don’t mind your income stock going up in value, but it can go down just
as easily. The factors that affect stocks in general — politics, economic
trends (Chapter 14), industry changes (Chapter 12), and so on — affect
income stocks, too. Fortunately, income stocks don’t get hit as hard as other
stocks when the market is declining because high dividends tend to act as a
support to the stock price. Therefore, income stocks’ prices usually fall less
dramatically than the prices of other stocks in a declining market.
Interest-rate sensitivity
Income stocks can be sensitive to rising interest rates. When interest rates go
up, other investments (such as corporate bonds, U.S. treasury securities, and
bank certificates of deposit) are more attractive. When your income stock is
yielding 4 percent and interest rates are going to 5 percent, 6 percent, or
higher, you may think, “Hmmm. Why settle for a 4 percent yield when I can
get 5 percent or better elsewhere?” As more and more investors sell their
low-yield stock, the prices for those stocks fall.
Another point to remember is that rising interest rates may hurt the com-
pany’s financial strength. If the company has to pay more interest, that may
affect the company’s earnings, which in turn may affect the dividend.
Dividend-paying companies that are experiencing consistent, falling revenues
tend to cut dividends. In this case, “consistent” means beyond just a year.
Inflation eats into dividends
Although many companies raise their dividends on a regular basis, some
don’t. Or, if they do raise their dividends, the increases may be small. If
income is your primary consideration, you want to be aware of this fact. If
you’re getting the same dividend year after year and this income is important
to you, rising inflation becomes a problem. Say that you have XYZ stock at
$10 per share with an annual dividend of 30 cents (the yield is 30 cents
divided by $10, or 3 percent). If you have a yield of 3 percent two years in a
row, how do you feel when inflation rises 6 percent one year and 7 percent
the next year? Because inflation means that your costs are rising, inflation
shrinks the value of the dividend income you receive.
117
Chapter 9: Investing for Income

As you can see, even conservative income investors can be confronted with
different types of risk. (Chapter 4 covers the topic of risk in greater detail.)
Fortunately, the rest of this chapter helps you carefully choose income stocks
so that you can minimize these potential disadvantages.
Don’t forget Uncle Sam
The government usually taxes dividends as ordinary income. Fortunately,
recent tax legislation has favored dividend-paying stock. See Chapter 20 for
more information on taxes for stock investors.
Analyzing Income Stocks
Look at income stocks in the same way you do growth stocks when assessing
the financial strength of a company. Getting nice dividends comes to a
screeching halt if the company can’t afford to pay them. If your budget
depends on dividend income, then monitoring the company’s financial
strength is that much more important. You can apply the same techniques I
list in Chapter 8 for assessing the financial strength of growth stocks to your
assessment of income stocks.
Understanding your needs first
You choose income stocks primarily because you want or need income now.
As a secondary point, income stocks have the potential for steady, long-term
118
Part II: Before You Start Buying 
Playing it safe
If you’re an investor seeking income and you’re
very nervous about potential risks with income
stocks, here are some non-stock alternatives:
 U.S. Treasury securities: Issued by the fed-
eral government, these securities are con-
sidered the safest investments in the world.
Examples of treasury securities are U.S.
savings bonds and treasury bonds. They
pay interest and are an ideal addition to any
income investor’s portfolio.
 Bank certificates of deposit (CDs): These
investments are backed up by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and
are considered very safe.
 Income mutual funds: Many mutual funds,
such as treasury bond mutual funds and
corporate bond funds, are designed for
income investors. They offer investors
diversification and professional manage-
ment, and investors can usually invest with
as little as $1,000.

appreciation. So if you’re investing for retirement needs that won’t occur for
another 20 years, maybe income stocks aren’t suitable for you — better to
invest in growth stocks because they’re more likely to grow your money
faster over your stated lengthy investment term.
If you’re certain that you want income stocks, do a rough calculation to figure
out how big a portion of your portfolio you want income stocks to occupy.
Suppose that you need $25,000 in investment income to satisfy your current
financial needs. If you have bonds that give you $20,000 in interest income
and you want the rest to come from dividends from income stocks, you need
to choose stocks that pay you $5,000 in annual dividends. If you have $80,000
left to invest, you know that you need a portfolio of income stocks that pro-
vide $5,000 in dividend income or a yield of 6.25 percent ($5,000 divided by
$80,000 equals a yield of 6.25 percent).
Use the following table as a general guideline for understanding your need for
income.

C. Yield neces-

With this simple table, you know that if you have $150,000 in income stocks
yielding 6.7 percent, you receive income of $10,000 — meeting your stated
financial need. You may ask, “Why not just buy $150,000 of bonds (for instance)
that yield at least 6.7 percent?” Well, if you’re satisfied with that $10,000, 
and inflation for the foreseeable future is zero, then you have a point.
Unforturnately, inflation will probably be with us for a long time. Fortunately,
steady growth that income stocks provide are a benefit to you.
If you have income stocks and don’t have any immediate need for the divi-
dends, consider reinvesting the dividends in the company’s stock. For more
details on this kind of reinvesting, see Chapter 18.
Every investor is different. If you’re not sure about your current or future
needs, your best choice is to consult with a financial planner.

Chapter 9: Investing for Income

Checking out yield
Because income stocks pay out dividends — income — you need to assess
which stocks can give you the highest income. How do you decide which
stocks will pay the most money? The main thing to look for in choosing income
stocks is yield (the percentage rate of return paid on a stock in the form of divi-
dends). Looking at a stock’s dividend yield is the quickest way to find out how
much money you’ll earn from a particular income stock versus other dividend-
paying stocks (or even other investments such as a bank account). Table 9-1
illustrates this point. Dividend yield is calculated in the following way:
Dividend yield = dividend income ÷ stock investment
The next two sections use the information in Table 9-1 to compare the yields
from different investments and to see how evaluating yield can help you
choose the stock that will earn you the most money.
Don’t stop scrutinizing stocks after you acquire them. You may have made a
great choice that gives you a great dividend, but that doesn’t mean that the
stock stays that way indefinitely. Monitor the company’s progress for as long
as it’s in your portfolio. Use resources such as www.bloomberg.com and
www.marketwatch.com (see Appendix A for more resources) to track your
stock and to monitor how well that particular company continues to perform.

Minding your dividends and interest
Dividends are sometimes confused with inter-
est. However, dividends are payouts to owners,
while interest is a payment to a creditor. A stock
investor is considered a part owner of the com-
pany he invests in and is entitled to dividends
when they’re issued. A bank, on the other hand,
considers you a creditor when you open an
account. The bank borrows your money and
pays you interest on it.

Examining yield
Most people have no problem understanding yield when it comes to bank
accounts. If I tell you that my bank certificate of deposit (CD) has an annual
yield of 3.5 percent, you can easily figure out that if I deposit $1,000 in that
account, a year later I’ll have $1,035 (slightly more if you include compound-
ing). The CD’s market value in this example is the same as the deposit
amount — $1,000. That makes it easy to calculate.
How about stocks? When you see a stock listed in the financial pages, the divi-
dend yield is provided along with the stock’s price and annual dividend. The
dividend yield in the financial pages is always calculated as if you bought the
stock on that given day. Just keep in mind that, based on supply and demand,
stock prices change virtually every day (every minute!) that the market is
open. Therefore, because the stock price changes every day, the yield changes
as well. So, keep the following two things in mind when examining yield:
 The yield listed in the financial pages may not represent the yield you’re
receiving. What if you bought stock in Smith Co. (see Table 9-1) a month
ago at $20 per share? With an annual dividend of $1, you know that your
yield is 5 percent. But what if today Smith Co. is selling for $40 per share? If
you look in the financial pages, the yield quoted would be 2.5 percent.
Gasp! Did the dividend get cut in half?! No, not really. You’re still getting 5
percent because you bought the stock at $20 rather than the current $40
price; the quoted yield is for investors who purchase Smith Co. today.
Investors who buy Smith Co. stock today pay $40 and get the $1 dividend,
and they’re locked into the current yield of 2.5 percent. Although Smith Co.
may have been a good income investment for you a month ago, it’s not
such a hot pick today because the price of the stock doubled, cutting the
yield in half. Even though the dividend hasn’t changed, the yield changed
dramatically because of the stock price change.
 Stock price affects how good of an investment the stock may be.
Another way to look at yield is by looking at the amount of investment.
Using Smith Co. in Table 9-1 as the example, the investor who bought,
say, 100 shares of Smith Co. when they were $20 per share only paid
$2,000 (100 shares times $20 — leave out commissions to make the
example simple). If the same stock is purchased later at $40 per share,
the total investment amount is $4,000 (100 shares times $40). In either
case, the investor gets a total dividend income of $100 (100 shares times
$1 dividend per share). From a yield perspective, which investment is
121
Chapter 9: Investing for Income

yielding more — the $2,000 investment or the $4,000 investment? Of
course, it’s better to get the income ($100 in this case) with the smaller
investment (a 5 percent yield is better than a 2.5 percent yield).
Comparing yield between different stocks
All things being equal, choosing Smith Co. or Jones Co. is a coin toss. It’s
looking at your situation and each company’s fundamentals and prospects
that will sway you. What if Smith Co. is an auto stock (similar to General
Motors in 2005) and Jones Co. is a utility serving the Las Vegas metro area.
Now what? In 2005, the automotive industry struggled, while utilities were
generally in much better shape. In that scenario, Smith Co.’s dividend would
be in jeopardy while Jones Co.’s dividend would be more secure. Another
issue would be the payout ratio (see later in this chapter). Therefore, having
the same yield is not the same as the same risk. Different companies have dif-
ferent risks associated with them.
Checking the stock’s payout ratio
You can use the payout ratio to figure out what percentage of the company’s
earnings are being paid out in the form of dividends. Keep in mind that com-
panies pay dividends from their net earnings. Therefore, the company’s earn-
ings should always be higher than the dividends the company pays out.
Here’s how to figure a payout ratio:
Dividend (per share) divided by Earnings (per share) = Payout Ratio
Say that the company CashFlow Now, Inc., (CFN) has annual earnings of $1
million dollars. (Remember that earnings are what you get when you subtract
expenses from sales.) Total dividends are to be paid out of $500,000, and the
company has 1 million outstanding shares. Using those numbers, you know
that CFN has earnings per share (EPS) of $1.00 ($1 million in earnings divided
by 1 million shares) and that it pays an annual dividend of 50 cents per share
($500,000 divided by 1 million shares). The dividend payout ratio is 50 per-
cent (the 50-cent dividend is 50 percent of the $1.00 EPS). This number is a
healthy dividend payout ratio because even if the company’s earnings fall by
10 percent or 20 percent, it still has plenty of room to pay dividends. People
concerned about the safety of their dividend income should regularly watch
the payout ratio. The maximum acceptable payout ratio should be 80 percent
and a good range is 50–70 percent. A payout ratio of 60 percent and lower is
considered very safe.
When a company suffers significant financial difficulties, its ability to pay div-
idends is compromised. So if you need dividend income to help you pay your
bills, you better be aware of the dividend payout ratio. Generally, a dividend
payout ratio of 60 percent or less is safe. Obviously, the lower the percentage
is, the safer the dividend.
122
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

Diversifying your stocks
If most of your dividend income comes from stock in a single company or from
a single industry, consider reallocating your investment to avoid having all
your eggs in one basket. Concerns for diversification apply to income stocks
as well as growth stocks. If all your income stocks are in the electric utility
industry, then any problems in the electric utility industry are potential prob-
lems for your portfolio as well. See Chapter 4 for more on diversification.
Examining the company’s bond rating
Bond rating? Huh? What’s that got to do with dividend-paying stocks?
Actually, the company’s bond rating is very important to income stock
investors. The bond rating offers insight into the company’s financial
strength. Bonds get rated for quality for the same reasons that consumer
agencies rate products such as cars or toasters. Standard & Poor’s (S&P) is
the major independent rating agency that looks into bond issuers. It looks at
the issuer of a bond and asks the question “Does the bond issuer have the
financial strength to pay back the bond and the interest as stipulated in the
bond indenture?” To understand why this rating is important, consider the
following:
 If the bond rating is good, that means the company is strong enough to
pay its obligations. These obligations include expenses, payments on
debts, and dividends that are declared. If a bond rating agency gives the
company a high rating (or if it raises the rating), that’s a great sign for
anyone holding the company’s debt or receiving dividends.
 If a bond rating agency lowers the rating of a bond, that means that the
company’s financial strength is deteriorating — a red flag for anyone
who owns the company’s bonds or stock. A lower bond rating today
may mean trouble for the dividend later on.
 If the bond rating isn’t good, that means that the company is having diffi-
culty paying its obligations. If the company can’t pay all its obligations,
then it has to choose which ones to pay. More times than not, a finan-
cially troubled company chooses to cut dividends or (in a worst case
scenario) not pay dividends at all.
The highest rating issued by S&P is AAA. The grades AAA, AA, and A are con-
sidered “investment grade” or of high quality. Bs and Cs indicate a poor
grade, while anything lower than that is considered very risky (the bonds are
referred to as “junk bonds”). So if you see a XXX rating, then . . . gee . . . you
better stay away! (You may even get an infection.)
123
Chapter 9: Investing for Income

Exploring Some Typical Income Stocks
Although virtually every industry has stocks that pay dividends, some indus-
tries have more dividend-paying stocks than others. You won’t find too many
dividend-paying income stocks in the computer or biotech industry! The
reason is that these types of companies need a lot of money to finance expen-
sive research and development (R&D) projects to create new products.
Without R&D, the company can’t create new products to fuel sales, growth,
and future earnings. Computer, biotech, and other innovative industries are
better for growth investors.
Utilities
Utilities generate a large cash flow. (If you don’t believe me, look at your gas
and electric bills!) Cash flow includes money from income (sales of products
and/or services) and other items (such as the selling of assets, for example).
This cash flow is needed to cover things such as expenses, loan payments,
and dividends. Utilities are considered the most common type of income
stocks, and many investors have at least one in their portfolios. Investing in
your own local utility isn’t a bad idea. At least it makes paying the utility bill
less painful. Before you invest in a public utility, consider the following:
 The utility company’s financial condition: Is the company making money,
and are its sales and earnings growing from year to year? Make sure that
the utility’s bonds are rated A or higher. I cover bond ratings in the
“Examining the company’s bond rating” section, earlier in this chapter.
 The company’s dividend payout ratio: Because utilities tend to have a
good cash flow, don’t be too concerned if the ratio reaches 70 percent.
Again, from a safety point of view, however, the lower the rate the better.
See the “Checking the stock’s payout ratio” section, earlier in this chap-
ter, for more on payout ratios.
 The company’s geographic location: If the utility covers an area that’s
doing well and offers an increasing population base and business expan-
sion, that bodes well for your stock.
Real estate investment trusts (REITs)
Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are a special breed of stock. A REIT is
an investment that has the elements of both a stock and a mutual fund (a pool
of money received from investors that’s managed by an investment company).
124
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

It’s like a stock in that it’s a company whose stock is publicly traded on the
major stock exchanges, and it has the usual features that you expect from a
stock — it can be bought and sold easily through a broker, income is given to
investors as dividends, and so on. A REIT resembles a mutual fund in that it
doesn’t make its money selling goods and services; it makes its money by
buying, selling, and managing an investment portfolio — in the case of a REIT,
the portfolio is full of real estate investments. It generates revenue from rents
and property leases as any landlord does. In addition, some REITs own mort-
gages, and they gain income from the interest.
REITs are called trusts only because they meet the requirements of the Real
Estate Investment Trust Act of 1960. This act exempts REITs from corporate
income tax and capital gains taxes as long as they meet certain criteria, such
as dispensing 95 percent of their net income to shareholders. Other criteria
exist, but income investors are interested in this one. This provision is the
reason why REITs generally issue generous dividends. Beyond this status,
REITs are, in a practical sense, like any other publicly traded company.
The main advantages to investing in REITs include the following:
 Unlike other types of real estate investing, REITs are easy to buy and
sell. You can buy a REIT by making a phone call to a broker or visiting a
broker’s Web site, just as you can to purchase any stock.
 REITs have higher-than-average yields. Because they must distribute at
least 95 percent of their income to their shareholders, their dividends
usually yield a return of 5 to 12 percent.
 REITs involve a lower risk than the direct purchase of real estate.
Because you’re investing in a company that buys the real estate, you
don’t have to worry about managing the properties — the company’s
management does that on a full-time basis. Usually, the REIT doesn’t 
just manage one property; it’s diversified in a portfolio of different 
properties.
 Investing in a REIT is affordable for small investors. REIT shares usually
trade in the $10 to $40 range, meaning that you can invest with very
little money.
REITs do have disadvantages. They have the same inherent risks as investing
in real estate directly. Real estate investing reached manic record-high levels
during 2000–2004, which means that a downturn is likely. Whenever you
invest in an asset (real estate and therefore REITs) that has already skyrock-
eted due to artificial stimulants (in the case of real estate, very low interest
rates and too much credit and debt), the potential losses can offset any
potential (unrealized) income.
125
Chapter 9: Investing for Income

When you’re looking for a REIT to invest in, analyze it the way you’d analyze
a property. Look at the location and type of the property. If shopping malls
are booming in California and your REIT buys and sells shopping malls in
California, then you’ll do well. However, if your REIT invests in office build-
ings across the country and the office building market is overbuilt and having
tough times, so will you.
Royalty trusts
In recent years, the oil and gas sector has generated much interest as people
and businesses experience much higher energy prices. Due to a variety of
bullish factors, such as increased international demand from China and other
emerging industrialized nations, oil and gas prices have zoomed to record
highs. Some income investors have capitalized on this price increase by
investing in energy stocks called royalty trusts.
Royalty trusts are companies that hold assets such as oil-rich and/or gas-rich
land and generate high fees from companies that seek access to these proper-
ties for exploration. The fees paid to the Royalty trusts are then disbursed as
high dividends to their shareholders. By the second half of 2005, dividend-
rich royalty trusts sported yields in the 8–12 percent range, which is very
enticing given how low the yields have been in this decade for other invest-
ments such as bank accounts and bonds. You can research royalty trusts in
generally the same venues as regular stocks (see Appendix A).
Although energy has been a hot field in recent years and royalty trusts have
done well, keep in mind that their payout ratios are very high (often in the
90–100 percent range) so dividends will suffer should their cash flow shrink.

uccessful stock picking sometimes seems like plucking a rabbit out of a
hat or watching the Amazing Kreskin do some Houdini trick. In other
words, it seems like you need sleight of hand to choose a stock. Perhaps
stock picking is more art than science. The other guy seems to always pick
winners while you’re stuck with losers. What does it take? A crystal ball or
some system from a get-rich-quick-with-stocks book? Well, with the book in
your hands now and a little work on your part, I think you’ll succeed. This
chapter takes the mystery out of the numbers behind the stock. The most
tried-and-true method for picking a good stock starts with picking a good
company. Picking the company means looking at its products, services,
industry, and financial strength (“the numbers”). Doing some research
regarding the company’s “financials” is easier than ever before, thanks to the
current information age.
Recognizing Value When You See It
If you pick a stock based on the value of the company that’s issuing it, you’re
a value investor — an investor who looks at a company’s value and judges
whether he can purchase the stock at a good price. Companies have values
the same way many things have value, such as eggs or elephant-foot umbrella
stands. And there’s such a thing as a fair price to buy them at, too. Eggs, for
example, have value. You can eat them and have a tasty treat while getting
nutrition as well. But would you buy an egg for $1,000 (and, no, you’re not a
starving millionaire on a deserted island)? No, of course not. But what if you

could buy an egg for 5 cents? At that point, it has value and a good price. This
kind of deal is a value investor’s dream.
Value investors analyze a company’s fundamentals (earnings, assets, and so
on) and see if the information justifies purchasing the stock. They see if the
stock price is low relative to these verifiable, quantifiable factors. Therefore,
value investors use “fundamental analysis” while other investors may use
“technical analysis”. Technical analysis looks at stock charts and statistical
data, such as trading volume and historical stock prices. There are also
investors that use a combination of both.
History has shown us that the most successful long-term investors have typi-
cally been value investors using fundamental analysis as their primary invest-
ing approach.
When you look at a company from a value-oriented perspective, here are
some of the most important items to consider:
 The balance sheet to figure out the company’s net worth: A value
investor doesn’t buy a company’s stock because it’s cheap; he buys it
because it’s undervalued (the company is worth more than the price its
stock reflects — its market value is as close as possible to its book
value).
 The income statement to figure out the company’s profitability: A com-
pany may be undervalued from a simple comparison of the book value
and the market value, but that doesn’t mean it’s a screaming buy. For
example, what if you find out that a company is in trouble and losing
money this year? Do you buy its stock then? No, you don’t. Why invest
in the stock of a losing company? (If you do, you aren’t investing —
you’re gambling or speculating.) The heart of a company’s value,
besides its net worth, is its ability to generate profit.
 Ratios that let you analyze just how well (or not so well) the company
is doing: Value investors basically look for a bargain. That being the
case, they generally don’t look at companies that everyone is talking
about, because by that point, the stock of those companies ceases to be
a bargain. The value investor searches for a stock that will eventually be
discovered by the market and then watches as the stock price goes up.
But before you bother digging into the fundamentals to find that bargain
stock, first make sure that the company is making money.
See the section, “Accounting for Value,” later in this chapter, for more on
using balance sheets, income statements, and ratios to help you analyze
stock values.
128
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

Value investors can find thousands of companies that have value, but they
can probably buy only a handful at a truly good price. The number of stocks
that can be bought at a good price is relative to the market. In mature bull
markets, a good price is hard to find because most stocks have probably
seen significant price increases, but in bear markets, good companies at bar-
gain prices are easier to come by.
Understanding different types of value
Value may seem like a murky or subjective term, but it’s the essence of good
stock picking. You can measure value in different ways, so you need to know
the difference and understand the impact that value has on your investment
decisions.
Market value
When you hear someone quoting a stock at $47 per share, that price reflects
the stock’s market value. The total market valuation of a company’s stock is
also referred to as its market cap or market capitalization. How do you deter-
mine a company’s market cap? With the following simple formula:
Market capitalization = share price × number of shares outstanding
If Bolshevik Corp’s stock is $35 per share and it has 10 million shares out-
standing (or shares available for purchase), then its market cap is $350 mil-
lion. Granted, $350 million dollars may sound like a lot of money, but
Bolshevik Corp is considered a small-cap stock. For more information about
small-cap stocks, dip into Chapter 8.
Who sets the market value of stock? The market — millions of investors
directly and through intermediaries such as mutual funds — determines the
market value of stock. If the market perceives that the company is desirable,
investor demand for the company’s stock pushes up the share price.
The problem with market valuation is that it’s not always a good indicator of
a good investment. In recent years, plenty of companies have had astronomi-
cal market values, yet they proved to be terrible companies and subse-
quently terrible investments. For example, WorldCom was a
multi-billion-dollar stock, yet the company eventually went bankrupt, and the
stock became worthless. Investors (and analysts) misunderstood the differ-
ence between the fleeting market value of the stock and the true value of the
underlying company.
129
Chapter 10: Using Basic Accounting to Choose Winning Stocks

Book value
Book value (also referred to as accounting value) looks at a company from a
balance sheet perspective (assets minus liabilities equal net worth or stock-
holders’ equity). It’s a way of judging a company by its net worth to see
whether the stock’s market value is reasonable compared to the company’s
intrinsic value.
Generally, market value usually tends to be higher than book value. If market
value is substantially higher than book value, the value investor becomes
more reluctant to buy that particular stock because it’s overvalued. The
closer the stock’s market capitalization is to the book value, the safer the
investment.
I like to be cautious with a stock whose market value is more than twice the
company’s book value. If the market value is $1 billion and the book value is
$500 million or more, that’s a good indicator that the company may be over-
valued, or valued at a higher price than the company’s book value and ability
to generate a profit. Just understand that the farther the market value is from
the company’s book value, the more you will pay for the company’s real
potential value.
Earnings and sales value
A company’s intrinsic value is directly tied to its ability to make money. In
that case, many analysts like to value stocks from the perspective of the com-
pany’s income statement. Two common barometers of value are expressed in
ratios: the price to sale ratio and the price-to-earnings ratio. In both instances,
the price is a reference to the company’s market value (as reflected in its
share price). Sales and earnings are references to the company’s ability to
make money. These two ratios are covered more fully in the section “Tooling
around with ratios,” later in this chapter.
For investors, the general approach is clear. The closer the market value is to
the company’s intrinsic value, the better. And, of course, if the market value
is lower than the company’s intrinsic value, then you have a potential bargain
worthy of a closer look. Part of looking closer means examining the company’s
income statement, also called the profit and loss statement, or simply, the P&L.
A low price to sales ratio (PSR) is 1, a medium PSR is between 1 and 2, and a
high PSR is 3 or higher.
Putting the pieces together
The more ways that you can look at a company and see value, the better. The
first thing I look at (sorry, it’s a habit) is the PE ratio. Does the company have
one? (It sounds dumb, but if it’s losing money, it may not have one.) Does it
look reasonable or is it in triple-digit, nose-bleed territory? Is it reasonable or
130
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

too high? Next, look at the company’s debt load. Is it less than the company’s
equity? Are sales healthy and increasing from the prior year? Does the com-
pany compare favorably in these categories versus other companies in the
same industry?
Simplicity to me is best. You’ll notice that the number “10” comes up fre-
quently as I measure the company’s performance juxtaposing all the numbers
that you need to be aware of. If net income is rising by 10 percent or more,
that’s fine. If the company is in the top 10 percent of its industry, that’s great.
If the industry is growing by 10 percent or better (sales, and so on), that’s
great. If sales are up 10 percent or more from the prior year, that’s great. A
great company doesn’t have to have all of these things going for it. But it
should have as many of these things happening to ensure greater potential
success.
Does every company/industry have to neatly fit this criteria? No. Of course
not. But it won’t hurt you to be as picky as possible. You only need to find a
handful of stocks from thousands of choices. (Hey, this approach has worked
for me, my clients, and my students for over two decades.) Nuff said.
Accounting for Value
Profit is for a company what oxygen is for you and me. That’s neither good
nor bad; it just is. Without profit, a company can’t survive, much less thrive.
Without profit, it can’t provide jobs, pay taxes, and invest in new products,
equipment, or innovation. Without profit, the company eventually goes bank-
rupt, and the value of its stock evaporates.
In the heady days leading up to the bear market of 2000–2002, many investors
lost a lot of money simply because they invested in stocks of companies that
weren’t making a profit. Lots of public companies ended up like bugs that just
didn’t see the windshield coming their way. Companies such as Enron,
WorldCom, and Global Crossing entered the graveyard of rather-be-forgotten
stocks. Stock investors as a group lost trillions of dollars investing in glitzy
companies that sounded good but weren’t making money. When their bro-
kers were saying, “buy, buy, buy,” their hard-earned money was saying, “bye,
bye, bye!” What were they thinking?
Stock investors need to pick up some rudimentary knowledge of accounting
to round out their stock-picking prowess and to be sure that they’re getting a
good value for their investment dollars. Accounting is the language of busi-
ness. If you don’t understand basic accounting, then you’ll have difficulty
being a successful investor. Investing without accounting knowledge is like
traveling without a map. However, if you can run a household budget, using
accounting analysis to evaluate stocks will be easier than you think.
131
Chapter 10: Using Basic Accounting to Choose Winning Stocks

Walking on a wire: The balance sheet
A company’s balance sheet gives you a financial snapshot of what the com-
pany looks like in terms of the following equation:
Assets – liabilities = net worth
Analyze the following items that you find on the balance sheet:
 Assets: Have they increased from the prior year? If not, was it due to the
sale of an asset or a write-off (uncollectible accounts receivable, for
example)?
 Inventory: Is inventory higher or lower than last year? If sales are flat
but inventory is growing, that may be a potential problem.

sheet showed debt of over $451 billion while
total shareholder equity was only $27.7 billion.
GM’s net income fell to just 1 percent of net
sales, and its price-to-earnings (PE) ratio (see
the “Tooling around with ratios” section, later in
this chapter) ballooned to a lofty 39. The stock
price hit $25 by April 2005. Although the price
rebounded to the mid-$30s by July 2005,
investors had skid marks on their portfolio as
the stock lost nearly two thirds of its value
during that time frame. By September 2005, GM
reported a net loss (goodbye PE ratio). In my
reckoning, GM is no longer an investment; it is
now a speculation. At this rate, it may go from
SUV to DOA ASAP.
As a contrasting point, look at Exxon Mobil
(XOM) during that same time frame. Its stock
price went from about $35 in early 2001 to $60 in
July 2005 (it had a 2-for-1 stock split in mid-
2001). XOM’s net income was a healthy 8 per-
cent of sales and the PE ratio was only 14. In its
2004 year-end balance sheet, total shareholder
equity of $101.7 billion comfortably exceeded its
total liabilities of $89.5 billion. A sound company
with sound numbers. (Ya hear me?)
The point here is that the stock price ultimately
reflects the financial health and vitality of the
company, and you can easily find and evaluate
that information. You don’t need luck or a crys-
tal ball. Again, just a little work in the form of
fundamental analysis is sufficient.

 Debt: Debt is the biggest weakness on the corporate balance sheet.
Make sure that debt isn’t a growing item and that it’s under control. In
recent years, debt has become a huge problem.
 Derivatives: A derivative is a speculative and complex financial instru-
ment that doesn’t constitute ownership of an asset (such as a stock,
bond, or commodity), but a promise to convey ownership. Some deriva-
tives are quite acceptable because they are used as protective or hedging
vehicles (this is not my primary concern). However, they are frequently
used to generate income and can then carry risks that can increase lia-
bilities. Options and futures are examples of derivatives. Find out
whether the company dabbles in these complicated, dicey, leveraged
financial instruments. Find out (from the company’s 10K report) whether
it has derivatives and, if so, the total amount. If a company has deriva-
tives that are valued higher than the company’s net equity, it may cause
tremendous problems. Derivatives problems sank many organizations
ranging from stodgy banks (Barings Bank of England) to affluent coun-
ties (Orange County, California) to once-respected hedge funds (LTCM)
to infamous corporations (Enron).
 Equity: Equity is the company’s net worth (what’s left in the event that
all the assets are used to pay off all the company debts). The stockhold-
ers’ equity should be increasing steadily by at least 10 percent per year.
If not, find out why.
By looking at a company’s balance sheet, you can address the following 
questions:
 What does the company own (assets)? The company can own assets,
which can be financial, tangible, and/or intangible. Assets can be any-
thing that has value or that can be converted to or sold for cash.
Financial assets can be cash, investments, or accounts receivable.
Assets can be tangible things such as inventory, equipment, and/or
buildings. They can also be intangible things such as licenses, trade-
marks, or copyrights.
 What does the company owe (liabilities)? Liabilities are anything of
value that the company must ultimately pay to someone else. Liabilities
can be invoices (accounts payable) or short-term or long-term debt.
 What is the company’s net equity (net worth)? After you subtract the
liabilities from the assets, the remainder is called either net worth, net
equity, or net stockholders’ equity. This number is also critical when cal-
culating a company’s book value.
As you can see, a balance sheet isn’t difficult to understand. It’s an important
document that you should look at carefully to make sure the company is in a
strong financial position. Finding the relevant financial data on a company
133
Chapter 10: Using Basic Accounting to Choose Winning Stocks

isn’t difficult in the age of information. Web sites, such as www.nasdaq.com,
can give you the most recent balance sheets and income statements of most
public companies.
The assets and liabilities relationship for a company has the same logic as
the assets and liabilities in your own household. When you look at a snap-
shot of your own finances (your personal balance sheet), how can you tell if
you’re doing well? Odds are that you’d start by comparing some numbers. If
your net worth is $5,000, you may say, “That’s great!” But a more appropriate
remark is something like, “That’s great compared to, say, a year ago.”
Compare a company’s balance sheet at a recent point in time to a past time.
You should do this comparative analysis with all the key items on the balance
sheet. You do this analysis to see the company’s progress. Is it growing its
assets and/or shrinking its debt? Most importantly, is the company’s net
worth growing? Is it growing by at least 10 percent from a year ago? All too
often, investors stop doing their homework after they make an initial invest-
ment. You should continue to look at the company’s numbers on a regular
basis so that you can be ahead of the curve. If the company starts having
problems, you can get out before the rest of the market starts getting out
(which causes the stock price to fall).
To judge the financial strength of a company, ask yourself the following 
questions:
 Are the company’s assets greater in value than they were three months
ago, a year ago, or two years ago? Compare current asset size to the
most recent two years to make sure that the company is growing in size
and financial strength.
 How do the individual items compare with prior periods? Some particu-
lar assets that you want to take note of are cash, inventory, and
accounts receivable.
 Are liabilities such as accounts payable and debt about the same, lower,
or higher compared to prior periods? Are they growing at a similar,
faster, or slower rate than the company’s assets? Remember that debt
that rises faster and higher than items on the other side of the balance
sheet is a warning sign of pending financial problems.
 Is the company’s net worth or equity greater than the previous year?
And is that year’s equity greater than the year before? In a healthy com-
pany, the net worth is constantly rising. As a general rule, in good eco-
nomic times, net worth should be at least 10 percent higher than the
previous year. In tough economic times (such as a recession), 5 percent
is acceptable. Seeing the net worth growing at 15 percent or higher is
great.
134
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

Looking at the income statement
Where do you look if you want to find out what a company’s profit is? Check
out the company’s income statement. It reports, in detail, a simple account-
ing equation that you probably already know:
Sales – expenses = net profit (or net earnings or net income)
Look at the following figures found on the income statement:
 Sales: Are they increasing? If not, why not? By what percentage are sales
increasing? Preferably, they should be at 10 percent higher than the year
before. Sales are, after all, where the money is coming from to pay for
the company’s activities and subsequent profit.
 Expenses: Do you see any unusual items? Are total expenses reported
higher than the prior year and by how much? If the item is significantly
higher, why? A company with large, rising expenses will see profits
suffer, which isn’t good for the stock price.
 Research and development (R&D): How much is the company spending
on R&D? Companies that rely on new product development (such as
pharmaceuticals or biotech firms) should spend an adequate amount
because new products mean future earnings and growth.
 Earnings: This figure reflects the bottom line. Are total earnings higher?
How about earnings from operations (leaving out expenses such as
taxes and interest)? The earnings section is the heart and soul of the
income statement and of the company itself. Out of all the numbers in
the financial statements, earnings have the greatest single impact on the
company’s stock price.
Looking at the income statement, an investor can try to answer the following
questions:
 What sales did the company make? Companies sell products and ser-
vices that generate revenue (known as sales or gross sales). Sales are
also referred to as the top line.
 What expenses did the company incur? In generating sales, companies
pay expenses such as payroll, utilities, advertising, administration, and
so on.
 What is the net income? Also called earnings or net profit, net income is
the bottom line. After paying for all expenses, what profit did the com-
pany make?
135
Chapter 10: Using Basic Accounting to Choose Winning Stocks

The information you glean should give you a strong idea about the com-
pany’s current financial strength and whether it’s successfully increasing
sales, holding down expenses, and ultimately maintaining profitability. You
can find out more about sales, expenses, and profits in the sections that
follow.
Sales
Sales refers to the money that a company receives as customers buy its
goods and/or services. It’s a simple item on the income statement and a
useful number to look at. Analyzing a company by looking at its sales is called
top line analysis.
As an investor, you should take into consideration the following points about
sales:
 Sales should be increasing. A healthy, growing company has growing
sales. They should grow at least 10 percent from the prior year, and you
should look at the most recent three years.
 Core sales (sales of those products or services that the company spe-
cializes in) should be increasing. Frequently, the sales figure has a lot of
stuff lumped into it. Maybe the company sells widgets (what the heck is
a widget, anyway?), but the core sales should not include other things,
such as the sale of a building or other unusual items. Take a close look.
Isolate the company’s primary offerings and ask whether these sales are
growing at a reasonable rate (such as 10 percent).
 Does the company have odd items or odd ways of calculating sales? In
the late 1990s, many companies boosted their sales by aggressively
offering affordable financing with easy repayment terms. Say you find
out that Suspicious Sales Inc. (SSI) had annual sales of $50 million,
reflecting a 25 percent increase from the year before. Looks great! But
what if you find out that $20 million of that sales number comes from
sales made on credit that the company extended to buyers? Some com-
panies that use this approach later have to write off losses as uncol-
lectible debt because the customer ultimately can’t pay for the goods.
If you want to get a good clue whether a company is artificially boosting
sales, check the company’s accounts receivable (listed in the asset section of
the company’s balance sheet). Accounts receivable refers to money that is
owed to the company for goods that customers have purchased on credit. If
you find out that sales went up by $10 million (great!) but accounts receiv-
able went up by $20 million (uh-oh), then something just isn’t right. That may
be a sign that the financing terms were too easy, and the company may have
a problem collecting payment (especially in a recession).
136
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

Expenses
What a company spends has a direct relationship on its profitability. If spend-
ing isn’t controlled or held at a sustainable level, it may spell trouble for a
company.
When you look at a company’s expense items, consider the following:
 Compare expense items to the prior period. Are expenses higher,
lower, or about the same from the prior period? If the difference is signif-
icant, you should see commensurate benefits elsewhere. In other words,
if overall expenses are 10 percent higher compared to the prior period,
are sales at least 10 percent more during the same period?
 Are some expenses too high? Look at the individual expense items. Are
they significantly higher than the year before? If so, why?
 Have any unusual items been expensed? Sometimes an unusual
expense isn’t necessarily a negative. Expenses may be higher than usual
if a company writes off uncollectible accounts receivable as bad debt
expense. Doing so inflates the total expenses and subsequently results
in lower earnings. Pay attention to nonrecurring charges that show up
on the income statement and determine whether they make sense.
Profit
Earnings or profit is the single most important item on the income statement.
It’s also the one that receives the most attention in the financial media. When
a company makes a profit, it’s usually reported as earnings per share (EPS).
So if you hear that the XYZ Corporation beat last quarter’s earnings by a
penny, here’s how to translate that news. Suppose that the company made $1
per share this quarter and 99 cents per share last quarter. If that company
had 100 million shares of stock outstanding, then its profit this quarter is
$100 million (the EPS times the number of shares outstanding), which is $1
million more than it made in the prior quarter ($1 million is one cent per
share times 100 million shares).
Don’t simply look at current earnings as an isolated figure. Always compare
current earnings to earnings in past periods (usually a year). For example, if
you’re looking at a retailer’s fourth quarter results, you can’t compare that
with the retailer’s third quarter. Doing so is like comparing apples to oranges.
What if the company usually does well during the December holidays but
poorly in the fall? In that case, you don’t get a fair comparison.
A strong company should show consistent earnings growth from the period
(such as the year or the same quarter from the prior year) before, and you
should check the period before that, too, so that you can determine whether
137
Chapter 10: Using Basic Accounting to Choose Winning Stocks

earnings are consistently rising over time. Earnings growth is an important
barometer of the company’s potential growth and bodes well for the stock
price.
When you look at earnings, here are some things to consider:
 Total earnings: This item is the most watched. Total earnings should
grow year to year by at least 10 percent.
 Operational earnings: Break down the total earnings and look at a key
subset — that portion of earnings derived from the company’s core
activity. Is the company continuing to make money from its primary
goods and services?
 Nonrecurring items: Are earnings higher (or lower) than usual or than
expected and why? Frequently, the difference results from items such as
the sale of an asset or a large depreciation write-off.
I like to keep percentages as simple as possible. Ten percent is a good number
because it’s easy to calculate and it’s a good benchmark. However, 5 percent
isn’t unacceptable if you’re talking about tough times, such as a recession.
Obviously, if sales, earnings, and/or net worth are hitting or passing 15 per-
cent, that’s great.
Tooling around with ratios
A ratio is a helpful numerical tool that you can use to find out the relation-
ship between two or more figures found in the company’s financial data. A
ratio can add meaning to a number or put it in perspective. Ratios sound
complicated, but they’re easier to understand than you think.
Say that you’re considering a stock investment and the company you’re look-
ing at has earnings of $1 million this year. You may think that’s a nice profit,
but in order for this amount to be meaningful, you have to compare it to
something. What if you find out that the other companies in the industry (of
similar size and scope) had earnings of $500 million? Does that change your
thinking? Or what if you find out that the same company had earnings of $75
million in the prior period? Does that change your mind?
Two key ratios to be aware of include
 Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)
 Price to sales ratio (PSR)
Every investor wants to find stocks that have a 20 percent average growth rate
over the past five years and have a low P/E ratio (sounds like a dream). Use
stock screening tools available for free on the Internet to do your research.
138
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

Many brokers have them at their Web sites (such as Charles Schwab at
www.schwab.com and E*TRADE at www.etrade.com). Some excellent stock
screening tools can also be found at Yahoo! (finance.yahoo.com), Business
Week (www.businessweek.com), and Nasdaq (www.nasdaq.com). A stock
screening tool lets you plug in numbers such as sales or earnings and ratios
such as the P/E ratio or the debt to equity ratio and then click! Up come
stocks that fit your criteria. This is a good starting point for serious
investors. Check out Appendix B for even more on ratios.
Running into the P/E ratio
The price to earnings (P/E) ratio is very important in analyzing a potential
stock investment because it’s one of the most widely regarded barometers of
a company’s value, and it’s usually reported along with the company’s stock
price in the financial page listing. The major significance of the P/E ratio is
that it establishes a direct relationship between the bottom line of a com-
pany’s operations — the earnings — and the stock price.
The P in P/E stands for the stock’s current price. The E is for earnings per
share (typically the most recent 12 months of earnings). The P/E ratio is also
referred to as the “earnings multiple” or just “multiple.”
You calculate the P/E ratio by dividing the price of the stock by the earnings
per share. If the price of a single share of stock is $10 and the earnings (on a
per-share basis) are $1, then the P/E is 10. If the stock price goes to $35 per
share and the earnings are unchanged, then the P/E is 35. Basically, the
higher the P/E, the more you pay for the company’s earnings.
Why would you buy stock in one company with a relatively high P/E ratio
instead of investing in another company with a lower P/E ratio? Keep in mind
that investors buy stocks based on expectations. They may bid up the price
of the stock (subsequently raising the stock’s P/E ratio) because they feel
that the company will have increased earnings in the near future. Perhaps
they feel that the company has great potential (a pending new invention or
lucrative business deal) that will eventually make the company more prof-
itable. More profitability in turn has a beneficial impact on the company’s
stock price. The danger with a high P/E is that if the company doesn’t
achieve the hopeful results, the stock price could fall.
You should look at two types of P/E ratios to get a balanced picture of the
company’s value:
 Trailing P/E: This P/E is the most frequently quoted because it deals
with existing data. The trailing P/E uses the most recent 12 months of
earnings in its calculation.
 Forward P/E: This P/E is based on projections or expectations of earn-
ings in the coming 12-month period. Although this P/E may seem prefer-
able because it looks into the near future, it’s still considered an
estimate that may or may not prove to be accurate.
139
Chapter 10: Using Basic Accounting to Choose Winning Stocks

The following example illustrates the importance of the P/E ratio. Say that
you want to buy a business and I’m selling a business. If you come to me and
say, “What do you have to offer?” I may say, “Have I got a deal for you! I operate
a retail business downtown that sells spatulas. The business nets a cool $2,000
profit per year.” You reluctantly say, “Uh, okay, what’s the asking price for the
business?” I reply, “You can have it for only $1 million! What do you say?”
If you’re sane, odds are that you politely turn down that offer. Even though the
business is profitable (a cool $2,000 a year), you’d be crazy to pay a million
bucks for it. In other words, the business is way overvalued (too expensive for
what you’re getting in return for your investment dollars). The million dollars
would generate a better rate of return elsewhere and probably with less risk.
As for the business, the P/E ratio ($1 million divided by $2,000 = a P/E of 500)
is outrageous. This is definitely a case of an overvalued company — and a
lousy investment.
What if I offered the business for $12,000? Does that price make more sense?
Yes. The P/E ratio is a more reasonable 6 ($12,000 divided by $2,000). In other
words, the business pays for itself in about 6 years (versus 500 years in the
prior example).
Looking at the P/E ratio offers a shortcut for investors asking the question,
“Is this stock overvalued?” As a general rule, the lower the P/E, the safer (or
more conservative) the stock is. The reverse is more noteworthy: The higher
the P/E, the greater the risk.
When someone refers to a P/E as high or low, you have to ask the question,
“Compared to what?” A P/E of 30 is considered very high for a large-cap elec-
tric utility but quite reasonable for a small-cap, high-technology firm. Keep in
mind that phrases such as “large-cap” and “small-cap” are just a reference to
the company’s market value or size. “Cap” is short for capitalization (the
total number of shares of stock outstanding times the share price).
The following basic points can help you evaluate P/E ratios:
 Compare a company’s P/E ratio with its industry. Electric utility industry
stocks generally have a P/E that hovers in the 9–14 range. Therefore, if
you’re considering an electric utility with a P/E of 45, then something is
wrong with that utility.
 Compare a company’s P/E with the general market. If you’re looking at a
small-cap stock on the Nasdaq that has a P/E of 100 but the average P/E
for established companies on the Nasdaq is 40, find out why. You should
also compare the stock’s P/E ratio with the P/E ratio for major indexes
such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), the Standard & Poor’s
500 (S&P 500), and the Nasdaq Composite (for more on market indexes,
see Chapter 5).
140
Part II: Before You Start Buying 

 Compare a company’s current P/E with recent periods (such as this year
versus last year). If it currently has a P/E ratio of 20 and it previously
had a P/E ratio of 30, you know that either the stock price has declined
or that earnings have risen. In this case, the stock is less likely to fall.
That bodes well for the stock.
 Low P/E ratios aren’t necessarily a sign of a bargain, but if you’re looking
at a stock for many other reasons that seem positive (solid sales, strong
industry, and so on) and it also has a low P/E, that’s a good sign.
 High P/E ratios aren’t necessarily bad, but they do mean that you should
investigate further. If a company is weak and the industry is shaky, heed
the high P/E as a warning sign. Frequently, a high P/E ratio means that
investors have bid up a stock price, anticipating future income. The
problem is that if the anticipated income doesn’t materialize, the stock
price could fall.
 Watch out for a stock that doesn’t have a P/E ratio. In other words, it
may have a price (the P), but it doesn’t have earnings (the E). No earn-
ings means no P/E, meaning that you’re better off avoiding it. Can you
still make money buying a stock with no earnings? You can, but you
aren’t investing; you’re speculating.

Listening to a PSA about PSR
The price to sales ratio (PSR) is the company’s stock price divided by its
sales. Because the sales number is rarely expressed as a per-share figure, it’s

Chapter 10: Using Basic Accounting to Choose Winning Stocks
Better safe than sorry
The stocks listed in the nearby table were
among the high fliers in the late 1990s, but they
came crashing back to earth within 24 months.
As of January 2002, eBay’s P/E fell to 190 (still
too high), while Cisco and Yahoo! didn’t have
P/E ratios because they had losses (!) for the
years 2000 and 2001. Yikes! For all three, the
chances that the stocks may go lower are too
great for serious investors. You’re better off to
wait and see whether their earnings improve.

easier to divide a company’s total market value (see the section “Market
value,” earlier in this chapter, to find out what this term means) by its total
sales for the last 12 months.
As a general rule, stock trading at a PSR of 1 or less is a reasonably priced
stock worthy of your attention. For example, say that a company has sales of
$1 billion and the stock has a total market value of $950 million. In that case,
the PSR is 0.95. In other words, you can buy $1 of the company’s sales for
only 95 cents. All things being equal, that stock may be a bargain.
Analysts frequently use the PSR as an evaluation tool in the following 
circumstances:
 In tandem with other ratios to get a more well-rounded picture of the
company and the stock.
 When you want an alternate way to value a company that doesn’t have
earnings.
 By analysts who want a true picture of the company’s financial health,
because sales are tougher for companies to manipulate than earnings,
which are easier to manipulate.
 When you’re considering a company offering products (versus services).
PSR is more suitable for companies that sell items that are easily
counted (such as products). Companies that make their money through
loans, such as banks, aren’t usually valued with a PSR because deriving
a usable PSR for them is more difficult.
Compare the company’s PSR with other companies in the same industry,
along with the industry average, so that you get a better idea of the com-
pany’s relative value.

N
ow that you have the basics down, it’s time to
become a pro at picking individual stocks. When
you consider investing in a company, you need to know
the key indications that a particular stock’s price is going
to rise. And because the stock market doesn’t operate 
in a vacuum, I introduce general economic and political
factors that can have a huge effect on the stock market.
The chapters in this part steer you to key financial infor-
mation and important company documents and show you
how to interpret the information you find.

ood grief. Financial documents. Some people would rather suck a hospi-
tal mop than read some dry corporate or government report. Yet, if
you’re serious about choosing stocks, you should be serious about your
research. Fortunately, it’s not as bad as you think (put away that disgusting
mop). When you see that some basic research helps you build wealth, it gets
easier.
In this chapter, I discuss the basic documents that you will come across (or
should come across) most often in your investing life. These documents
include essential information that all investors need to know, not only at the
time of the initial investment decision, but also for as long as that stock
remains in their portfolio.
If you plan to hold the stock for the long haul, reading the annual report and
other reports covered in this chapter will be very helpful to you. If you intend
to get rid of the stock soon or plan to hold it only for the short term, reading
these reports diligently isn’t that important.
Getting a Message from the Muckety-
Muck: The Annual Report
When you’re a regular stockholder, the company sends you its annual report.
If you’re not already a stockholder, contact the company’s shareholder ser-
vice department for a hard copy.

You can often view a company’s annual report at its Web site. Any major
search engine can help you find it. Downloading or printing the annual report
should be easy.
You need to carefully analyze an annual report to find out the following:
 You want to know how well the company is doing. Are earnings higher,
lower, or the same as the year before? How are sales doing? These num-
bers should be clearly presented in the financial section of the annual
report.
 You want to find out whether the company is making more money
than it’s spending. How does the balance sheet look? Are assets higher
or lower than the year before? Is debt growing, shrinking, or about the
same as the year before? For more details on balance sheets, see
Chapter 10.
 You want to get an idea of management’s strategic plan for the coming
year. How will management build on the company’s success? This plan
is usually covered in the beginning of the annual report — frequently in
the letter from the chairman of the board.
Your task boils down to figuring out where the company has been, where it is
now, and where it’s going. As an investor, you don’t need to read the annual
report like a novel — from cover to cover. Instead, approach it like a newspa-
per and jump around to the relevant sections to get the answers you need to
decide whether you should buy or hold on to the stock.
Analyzing the annual report’s anatomy
Not every company puts its annual report together in exactly the same way —
the style of presentation varies. Some annual reports have gorgeous graphics
or actual coupons for the company’s products, while others are in a standard
black-and-white typeface with no cosmetic frills at all. But every annual
report does include common basic content, such as the income statement
and the balance sheet. The following sections present typical components of
an average annual report. Keep in mind that every annual report may not
have the sections in the same order.
Letter from the chairman of the board
The first thing you see is usually the letter from the chairman of the board.
It’s the “Dear Stockholder” letter that communicates views from the head
muckety-muck. The chairman’s letter is designed to put the best possible per-
spective on the company’s operations during the past year. Be aware of this
bias. If the company is doing well, the letter will certainly point it out. If the
company is having hard times, the letter probably puts a positive spin on the
146

company’s difficulties. If the Titanic had an annual report, odds are that the
letter would have reported, “Great news! A record number of our customers
participated in our spontaneous moonlight swimming program. In addition,
we confidently project no operating expenses whatsoever for the subsequent
fiscal quarter.” You get the point.
To get a good idea of what issues the company’s management team feels are
important and what goals they want to accomplish, keep the following ques-
tions in mind:
 What does the letter say about changing conditions in the company’s
business? How about in the industry?
 If any difficulties exist, does the letter communicate a clear and logical
action plan (cutting costs, closing money-losing plants, and so on) to get
the company back on a positive track?
 What is being highlighted and why? For example, is the company focus-
ing on research and development for new products or on a new deal
with China?
 Does the letter offer apologies for anything the company did? If, for
example, the company fell short of sales expectations, does it offer a
reason for the shortcoming?
 Did the company make (or will it make) new acquisitions or major devel-
opments (selling products to China or a new marketing agreement with a
Fortune 500 company)?
The company’s offerings
This section of an annual report can have various titles (such as “Sales and
Marketing”), but it covers what the company sells. Whatever the company
sells — products or services or both — understand what they are and why
customers purchase them. If you don’t understand what the company offers,
then understanding how the company earns money, which is the driving
force behind the company’s stock, will be more difficult. Are the company’s
core or primary offerings selling well? If the earnings of McDonald’s are hold-
ing steady, but earnings strictly from burgers and fries are fizzling, that’s a
cause for concern. If a company ceases making money from its specialty, you
should become cautious. Here are some other questions to ask yourself:
 How does the company distribute its offerings? Through a Web site,
malls, representatives, or some other means? Does it sell only to the U.S.
market, or is its distribution international? The greater the distribution,
the greater the sales and, ultimately, the higher the stock price.
 Are most of the sales to a definable marketplace? If, for example, most of
the company’s sales are to a war-torn or politically-unstable country,
you should worry. If the company’s customers aren’t doing well, that has
a direct impact on the company and, eventually, its stock.
147
Chapter 11: Decoding Company Documents

 How are sales doing versus market standards? In other words, is the
company doing better than the industry average? Is the company a
market leader in what it offers? The company should be doing better than
(or as well as) its peers in the industry. If the company is falling behind its
competitors, that doesn’t bode well for the stock in the long run.
 Does the report include information on the company’s competitors and
related matters? You should know who the company’s competitors are
because they have a direct effect on the company’s success. If cus-
tomers are choosing the competitor over your company, the slumping
sales and earnings will ultimately hurt the stock’s price.
Financial statements
Look over the various financial statements and find the relevant numbers.
Every annual report should have (at the very least) a balance sheet and an
income statement. Catching the important numbers on a financial statement
isn’t that difficult to do. However, it certainly helps when you pick up some
basic accounting knowledge. Chapter 10 can give you more details on evalu-
ating financial statements.
First, review the income statement (also known as the profit and loss state-
ment, or simply P&L). The income statement gives you the company’s sales,
expenses, and the result (net income or net loss).
Look at the balance sheet. The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a point
in time (annual reports usually provide a year-end balance sheet) that tells
you what the company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and the end
result (net worth). For a healthy company, assets should always be greater
than liabilities.
Carefully read the footnotes to the financial statements. Sometimes big
changes are communicated in small print.
Summary of past financial figures
The summary of past financial figures gives you a snapshot of the company’s
overall long-term progress. How many years does the annual report summa-
rize? Some reports summarize three years, while most do two years.
Management issues
The management issues section of an annual report includes a reporting of
current trends and issues, such as new things happening in the industry, that
affect the company. See whether you agree with management’s assessment of
economic and market conditions that affect the company’s prospects. What
significant developments in society does management perceive as affecting
148
Part III: Picking Winners 

the company’s operations? Does the report include information on current or
pending lawsuits?
CPA opinion letter
Annual reports typically include comments from the company’s independent
accounting firm. It may be an opinion letter or a simple paragraph with the
firm’s views regarding the financial statements that were prepared.
The CPA opinion letter should offer an opinion about the accuracy of the
financial data presented and how the statements were prepared. Check to see
whether the letter includes any footnotes regarding changes in certain num-
bers or how they were reported. For example, a company that wants to report
higher earnings may show depreciation done more conservatively versus a
more aggressive method of depreciating. In any case, you should verify the
numbers by looking at the company’s 10K document filed with the SEC.
Company identity data
The company identity data section informs you about the company’s sub-
sidiaries (or lesser companies that it owns), brands, and addresses. It also
contains standard data such as the headquarters location and names of
directors and officers. Many reports also include data on the directors’ and
officers’ positions in stock ownership at year-end.
Stock data
The stock data section may include a history of the stock price along with
information such as what exchange the stock is listed on, the stock symbol,
the company’s dividend reinvestment plan (if any), and so on. It also includes
information on stockholder services and whom to contact for further 
information.
Going through the proxy materials
As a shareholder (or stockholder — same thing), you’re entitled to vote at
the annual shareholders meeting. If you ever get the opportunity to attend
one, do so. You get to meet other shareholders and ask questions of manage-
ment and other company representatives. Usually, the shareholder services
department provides you with complete details. At the meetings, sharehold-
ers vote on company matters, such as approving the new accounting firm or
deciding whether a proposed merger with another company will go forward.
If you can’t attend (which is usually true for the majority of shareholders),
you can vote by proxy. Voting by proxy means essentially that you vote by
149
Chapter 11: Decoding Company Documents

mail. You indicate your votes on the proxy statement (or card) and authorize
a representative to vote at the meeting on your behalf. The proxy statement
is usually sent to all shareholders, along with the annual report, just before
the meeting.
Getting a Second Opinion
A wealth of valuable information is available for your investing pursuits. The
resources in this section are just a representative few — a good representa-
tion, though. The information and research they provide can be expensive if
you buy or subscribe on your own, but fortunately, most of the resources
mentioned are usually available in the business reference section of a well-
stocked public library. To get a more balanced view of the company and its
prospects, take a look at several different sources of information for the
stocks you’re researching.
Company documents filed with the SEC
The serious investor doesn’t overlook the wealth of information that you can
cull from documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC). Take the time and effort to review these documents because they offer
great insight regarding the company’s activities. Here’s how to obtain the
main documents that investors should be aware of:
 Drop by the company itself. Stockholder service departments keep
these publicly available documents on hand and usually give them at no
cost to interested parties.
 Visit the SEC, either in person or online. These documents are avail-
able for public viewing at the SEC offices. You can find out more by con-
tacting the Securities and Exchange Commission, Publications Unit, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20549.
At the SEC’s Web site, www.sec.gov, you can check out EDGAR
(Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system) to search
public documents filed. It’s a tremendous source of documents that
date back to 1994. You can search, print, or download documents very
easily. Documents can be located either by document number or key-
word search.
 Check out Public Registers Annual Report Service (www.prars.com).
This organization maintains an extensive collection of annual reports.
150
Part III: Picking Winners 

 Review the Annual Report Service (www.annualreportservice.
com). This site maintains an extensive database of company annual
reports.
 Use The Wall Street Journal free annual report service. If you read
this newspaper’s financial pages and see a company with the club
symbol (like the one you see on a playing card), then you can order that
company’s annual report by calling 800-654-CLUB or visiting the Web site
www.wsj.com.
Form 10K
Gee, how intimidating. Just the report name alone makes you scratch your
head. To some people, 10K refers to running a race of 10 kilometers. But if
you’re reading (not running) a 10K, you may be wishing you were running one
instead.
Form 10K is a report that companies must file with the SEC annually. It works
like the annual report that you get from the company except that it probably
provides more detailed financial information. It can be a little intimidating
because it can be dry, cumbersome text. It’s not exactly Shakespeare
(although 10K reports would’ve also driven Lady Macbeth insane); then
again, the data aren’t laden with as much spin as the annual report the com-
pany sends to shareholders. Without going crazy, go through each section of
the 10K. Take some extra time to scrutinize the section on financial data. Ask
the same questions that you do when you’re looking at the annual report.
The following Web sites can help you make sense of 10K reports:
 FreeEDGAR (www.freeedgar.com)
 10K Wizard (www.10Kwizard.com)
 Edgar Online, Inc. (www.edgar-online.com)
Form 10Q
This form is a quarterly report that gives you the same basic information as
the 10K, but it details only three months’ worth of activity. Because a long
time can pass between 10Ks (after all, it is a year), don’t wait 12 months to
see how your company is progressing. Make a habit of seeing how the com-
pany is doing by comparing its recent 10Q with one that covers the same
quarter last year. Is the profit higher or lower? How about sales? Debt?
Keep in mind that not every company has the same fiscal year. A company
with a calendar year fiscal year (ending December 31) files a 10Q for each of
the first three quarters and files a 10K for the final quarter. The company
reports its fourth quarter data in the 10K, along with the statistics for the 
full year.
151
Chapter 11: Decoding Company Documents

Insider reports
Two types of insiders exist: those who work within the company and those
outside the company who have a significant (10 percent or more) ownership
of company stock. Tracking insider activity is very profitable for investors
who want to follow in the footsteps of the people who are in the know. See
Chapter 19 for information about monitoring and benefiting from insider
activity.
Every time an insider (such as the CEO or controller) buys or sells stock, the
transaction has to be reported to the SEC. The insider actually reports the
trade prior to transacting it. These reports become publicly available docu-
ments that allow you to see what the insiders are actually doing. Hearing
what they say in public is one thing, but seeing what they’re actually doing
with their stock transactions is more important.
Value Line
The Value Line Investment Survey, one of many information products provided
by Value Line Publishing, Inc., is considered a longtime favorite by many
stock investing professionals. You can look it over at any library that has a
good business reference department. In the Survey, Value Line covers the
largest public companies and ranks them according to financial strength and
several other key business factors. To get more information about Value Line,
either head to the library or visit www.valueline.com.
Standard & Poor’s
Another ubiquitous and venerable publisher is Standard & Poor’s (S&P).
Although it has a number of quality information products and services for
both individual and institutional investors, the three you should take a look
at include the following:
 The S&P Stock Guide: Available at many libraries, this guide comes out
monthly and reports on stocks on the New York Stock Exchange,
American Stock Exchange, and the largest firms listed on Nasdaq. It
gives a succinct, two-page summary on each stock. It offers a snapshot
of the company’s current finances along with a brief history and com-
mentary on the company’s activities. This guide also rates the company
based on its financial strength.
 The S&P Industry Survey: S&P gives detailed reports on the top indus-
tries, cramming a lot of information about a given industry in four to
seven pages. This annual publication provides a nice summary of what’s
happened in the industry in the past 12 months, what the industry looks
like today, and the prospects for the coming year. It also provides the
152
Part III: Picking Winners 

important numbers (earnings, sales, and industry ranking) for the top 50
to 100 firms in the industry.
 The S&P Bond Guide: Yes, I know this book is about stocks. But a com-
pany’s bond rating is invaluable for stock investors. S&P analyzes the
strength of the bond issuer and ranks the bond for creditworthiness. If
S&P looks at the company and gives it a high rating, you have added
assurance that the company is financially strong. You want the company
to have a bond rating of AAA, AA, or A because these ratings tell you
that the company is “investment-grade.” Check out S&P’s Web site at
www.standardandpoors.com.
Moody’s Investment Service
Another stalwart publisher, Moody’s offers vital research on stocks and
bonds. Moody’s Handbook of Common Stocks is usually available in the refer-
ence section of a well-stocked library. It offers stock and bond guides similar
to S&P and also provides an independent bond rating service. A stock rated
highly by both Moody’s and S&P is a great place for investors hunting for
value investments.
Brokerage reports: The good, 
the bad, and the ugly
Clint Eastwood, where are you? Traditionally, brokerage reports have been a
good source of information for investors seeking informed opinions about
stocks. And they still are, but in recent years some brokers have been penal-
ized for biased reports. Brokers should never be the sole source of informa-
tion. Otherwise, Clint may ask them whether they’re lucky punks.
The good
Research departments at brokerage firms provide stock reports and make
them available for their clients and investment publications. The firms’ ana-
lysts and market strategists generally prepare these reports. Good research
is critical, and brokerage reports can be very valuable. What better source of
guidance than full-time experts backed up by million-dollar research depart-
ments? Brokerage reports have some strong points:
 The analysts are professionals who should understand the value of a com-
pany and its stock. They analyze and compare company data every day.
 They have at their disposal tremendous information and historical data
that they can sift through to make informed decisions.
 If you have an account with the firm, you can usually access the informa-
tion at no cost.
153
Chapter 11: Decoding Company Documents

The bad
Well, brokerage reports may not be bad in every case, but at their worst,
they’re quite bad. Brokers make their money from commissions and invest-
ment banking fees (nothing bad here). However, they can find themselves in
the awkward position of issuing brokerage reports on companies that are (or
could be) customers for the brokerage firm that employs them (hmmm —
could be bad). Frequently, this relationship can result in a brokerage report
that paints an overly positive picture of a company that can be a bad invest-
ment (yup, that’s bad).
Sometimes, good research can be compromised by conflicts of interest.
During 1998–2000, an overwhelming number of brokerage reports issued
glowing praise of companies that were either mediocre or dubious. Investors
bought up stocks such as tech stocks and Internet stocks. The sheer demand
pushed up stock prices, which gave the appearance of genius to analysts’
forecasts, yet they rose essentially as a self-fulfilling prophecy. The stocks
were very overvalued and were cruisin’ for a bruisin’. Analysts and investors
were feeling lucky.
The ugly
Investors lost a ton of money (oooh, ugly). Money that people painstakingly
accumulated over many years of work vanished in a matter of months as the
bear market of 2000 hit (uglier). Retirees who had trusted the analysts saw
nest eggs lose 40 to 70 percent in value (yikes, very ugly). In total, investors
lost over $5 trillion during 2000–2002, much of it needlessly.
During that bear market, a record number of lawsuits and complaints were
filed against brokerage firms. Wall Street and Main Street learned some tough
lessons. Regarding research reports from brokerage firms, the following
points can help you avoid getting a bad case of the uglies:
 Always ask yourself, “Is the provider of the report a biased source?” In
other words, is the broker getting business in any way from the com-
pany they’re recommending?
 Never, never, NEVER rely on just one source of information, especially if
it’s the same source that’s selling you the stock or other investment.
 Do your research first before you rely on a brokerage report.
 Do your due diligence before you buy stocks anyway. Look at the chap-
ters in Part 1 and Part 2 to understand your need for diversification, risk
tolerance, and so on.
 Verify the information provided to you with a trip to the library or Web
sites (see Appendix A). (Clint would be proud.)

Although I generally do not rely on Wall Street brokerage analysts, there are
some independent investment analysts that I track. You’ll find some of my
favorites mentioned in Chapter 13.
Compiling Your Own Research
Department
You don’t need to spend an excessive amount of time or money, but you
should maintain your own library of resources. You may only need one shelf
(or a small amount of memory on your computer’s hard drive). But why not
have a few investment facts and resources at your fingertips? I maintain my
own library loaded with books, magazines, newsletters, and tons of great
stuff downloaded on my computer for easy search and reference. When you
start your own collection, keep the following in mind:
 Keep some select newspapers. Barron’s, The Wall Street Journal, and
Investor’s Business Daily regularly have some editions that are worth
keeping. For example, The Wall Street Journal and Investor’s Business
Daily usually have a year-in-review issue that they do the first business
week in January. Barron’s has special issues reviewing brokers and finan-
cial Web sites.
 Subscribe to financial magazines. Publications such as Forbes magazine
and SmartMoney Magazine offer great research and regularly review
stocks, brokers, and resources for investors.
 Keep annual reports. Regarding the stocks that are the core holdings in
your portfolio, keep all the annual reports (at the very least, the most
recent three).
 Go to the library’s business reference section periodically to stay
updated. Hey, you pay the taxes that maintain the public library — you
may as well use it to stay informed.
 The Internet (just bein’ complete). The Web offers plenty of great sites
to peruse, and I list some of the best in Appendix A.
Financial reports are very important and easier to read than most people
think. An investor can easily avoid a bad investment by simply noticing the
data in what seems like a jumble of numbers. Figure out how to read them.
For a great book to help you with reading financial reports (without needless
technicality), check out How to Read a Financial Report: Wringing Vital Signs
Out of the Numbers, 6th Edition, by John A. Tracy (Wiley).

uppose that you have to bet your entire nest egg on a one-mile race. All
you need to do is select a winning group. Your choices are the following:
Group A: A group of thoroughbred race horses
Group B: A group of overweight Elvis impersonators
Group C: A group of lethargic snails
This isn’t a trick question, and you have one minute to answer. Notice that I
didn’t ask you to pick a single winner out of a giant mush of horses, Elvii, and
snails; I only asked you to pick the winning group in the race. The obvious
answer is the thoroughbred race horses (and, no, they weren’t ridden by the
overweight Elvis impersonators because that would take away from the elo-
quent point being made). In this example, even the slowest member of group
A easily outdistances the fastest member of either group B or C.
Industries aren’t equal, and life isn’t fair. After all, if life was fair, Elvis would
be alive and the impersonators wouldn’t exist. Fortunately, picking stocks
doesn’t have to be as difficult as picking a winning racehorse. The basic point
is that it’s easier to pick a successful stock from a group of winners (a grow-
ing, vibrant industry). Understanding industries only enhances your stock-
picking strategy.
A successful, long-term investor looks at the industry just as carefully as he
looks at the individual stock. Luckily, choosing a winning industry to invest in
is easier than choosing individual stocks. I know some investors who can
pick a winning stock in a losing industry, and I also know investors who have
chosen a losing stock in a winning industry (the former is far outnumbered
by the latter). Just think how well you do when you choose a great stock in a
great industry! Of course, if you repeatedly choose bad stocks in bad indus-
tries, then you may as well get out of the stock market altogether (maybe
your calling is to instead be a celebrity impersonator!).

Badgering the Witness and Interrogating
the Industries
Your common sense is an important tool in choosing industries with winning
stocks. The following sections explore some of the most important questions
to ask yourself when you’re choosing an industry. Keep in mind that an
industry isn’t the same as a sector. Even some market pros use the two
words almost interchangeably. A sector is basically a “mega-industry” or a
group of interrelated industries. For example, pharmaceuticals and HMOs are
each an industry, but both of them are part of the healthcare sector. Whereas
an industry is typically a category of business that performs a precise activ-
ity (such as computer chips or trucking). Not all industries in a sector per-
form equally in the same market conditions.
Is the industry growing?
The question may seem too obvious, but you still need to ask it before you
purchase stock. The saying “the trend is your friend” applies when choosing
an industry in which to invest, as long as the trend is an upward one. If you
look at three different stocks that are equal in every significant way but you
find that stock A is in an industry growing 15 percent per year while the other
two stocks are in industries that have either little growth or are shrinking,
which stock would you choose?
Sometimes, the stock of a financially unsound or poorly run company goes
up dramatically because the industry it’s in is very exciting to the public. The
most obvious example is Internet stocks from 1998–2000. Stocks such as
Amazon.com shot up to incredible heights because investors thought the
Internet was the place to be. Sooner or later, the measure of a successful
company is its ability to be profitable. Serious investors look at the com-
pany’s fundamentals (see Chapter 10 to find out how to do this) and the
prospects for the industry’s growth before settling on a particular stock.
To judge how well an industry is doing, various information sources monitor
all the major industries and measure their progress. The more reliable
sources include the following:
 MarketWatch (www.marketwatch.com)
 Standard & Poor’s Industry Survey (www.standardpoor.com)
 Hoover’s Industry Snapshots (www.hoovers.com)
 Yahoo! Industry News (www.industry.yahoo.com)
 Wall Street Journal (www.wsj.com)
158
Part III: Picking Winners 

The preceding sources generally give you in-depth information about the
major industries. Visit their Web sites to read their current research and arti-
cles along with links to relevant sites for more details. The Wall Street Journal
(published by Dow Jones & Co.), for example, publishes indexes for all the
major sectors and industries so that you can get a useful snapshot of how well
an industry is doing (including information about whether the stock is up or
down and how it’s performing year-to-date), and it updates its Web site daily.
Are the industry’s products or services 
in demand?
Look at the products and services that an industry provides. Do they look
like things that society will continue to want? Are products and services on
the horizon that could replace them? Does the industry face a danger of
potential obsolescence?
When evaluating future demand, look for a sunrise industry, which is one that
is new or emerging or has promising appeal for the future. Good examples in
recent years have been biotech and Internet companies. In contrast, a sunset
industry is one that is either declining or has little potential for growth. For
example, you probably shouldn’t invest in the videocassette manufacturing
industry as demand for DVDs increases. Owning stock in a strong, profitable
company in a sunrise industry is obviously the most desirable choice.
Current research unveils the following megatrends:
 The aging of America: More senior citizens than ever before will be
living in America. Because of this fact, financial and healthcare services
will prosper.
 Advances in high-technology: Internet, telecom, medical, and biotech-
nology innovations will continue.
159
Chapter 12: Analyzing Industries
Ranking the industries
Standard and Poor’s (S&P) Industry Survey is 
an excellent source of information on America’s
industries. Besides ranking and comparing
industries and informing you about their current
prospects, the survey also lists the top com-
panies by size, sales, earnings, and other 
key information. The survey and other S&P 
publications are available in the business refer-
ence section of most libraries (or at the S&P
Web site at www.standardpoor.com).
What I like is that each industry is covered in a
few pages. You get the critical information you
need without reading a novel.

 Increasing need for basic materials: As society advances here and in
the rest of the world, building blocks such as metals and other precious
commodities will be in demand.
 Security concerns: Terrorism and other international tensions mean more
attention for national defense, homeland security, and related matters.
 Energy challenges: Traditional and nontraditional sources of energy
(such as solar, fuel cells, and so on) will demand society’s attention as it
faces Peak Oil.
What does the industry’s growth rely on?
An industry doesn’t exist in a vacuum. External factors weigh heavily on its
ability to survive and thrive. Does the industry rely on an established mega-
trend, in which case it will probably be strong for a while, or on factors that
are losing relevance? Technological and demographic changes are other fac-
tors that may contribute to an industry’s growth.
Perhaps the industry offers great new medical products for senior citizens.
What are the prospects for growth? The graying of America is an established
megatrend. As millions of Americans climb past age 50, profitable opportuni-
ties await companies that are prepared to cater to them.
Is this industry dependent 
on another industry?
This twist on the prior question is a reminder that industries frequently are
intertwined and can become codependent. When one industry suffers, you
may find it helpful to understand which industries will subsequently suffer.
The reverse can also be true — when one industry is doing well, other indus-
tries may also reap the benefits.
In either case, if the stock you choose is in an industry that’s highly depen-
dent on other industries, you should know about it. If you’re considering
stocks of resort companies and you see the headlines blaring “Airlines losing
money as public stops flying,” what do you do? This type of question forces
you to think logically and consider cause and effect. Logic and common
sense are powerful tools that frequently trump all the number-crunching
activity performed by analysts.
160
Part III: Picking Winners 

Who are the leading companies 
in the industry?
After you’ve chosen the industry, what types of companies do you want to
invest in? You can choose from two basic types of companies:
 Established leaders: These companies are considered industry leaders
or have a large share of the market. Investing in these companies is the
safer way to go; what better investment for novice investors than com-
panies that have already proven themselves?
 Innovators: If the industry is hot and you want to be more aggressive in
your approach, investigate companies that offer new products, patents,
or new technologies. These companies are probably smaller but have a
greater potential for growth in a proven industry.
Is the industry a target 
of government action?
You need to know whether the government is targeting an industry because
intervention by politicians and bureaucrats (rightly or wrongly) can have an
impact on an industry’s economic situation. For example, would you invest in
a tobacco company now that the government has issued all of its regulations
and warnings?
Investors need to take heed when political “noise” starts coming out about a
particular industry. An industry can be hurt either by direct government
intervention or by the threat of it. Intervention can take the form of lawsuits,
investigations, taxes, regulations, or sometimes an outright ban. In any case,
being on the wrong end of government intervention is the greatest external
threat to a company’s survival.
Sometimes, government action helps an industry. Generally, beneficial action
takes two forms:
 Deregulation and/or tax decreases: Government sometimes reduces
burdens on an industry. In 1979, the federal government deregulated the
airlines, an action that in turn caused a boom in travel. The airline indus-
try subsequently experienced tremendous growth because more people
flew than ever before. This increase in the number of airline passengers,
in turn, spurred growth for the lodging and resort industries. Likewise,
telecom deregulation in the mid-1990s helped that industry to boom.
161
Chapter 12: Analyzing Industries

 Direct funding: Government has the power to steer taxpayer money
toward business as well. In the 1970s, when Chrysler was floundering,
financing assistance helped the company get back on its feet, and
Chrysler did well during the 1980s. Direct funding may be good for the
business receiving funds, but the problem is that consumers (taxpayers)
are forced to subsidize a failing enterprise.
Which category does the 
industry fall into?
Most industries can neatly be placed in one of two categories: cyclical and
defensive. In a rough way, these categories generally translate into what soci-
ety wants and what it needs. Society buys what it needs in both good and bad
times. It buys what it wants when times are good and holds off when times
are bad. A need is a “must have” while a want is a “like to have.” Kapish?
Cyclical industries
Cyclical industries are industries whose fortunes rise and fall with the econ-
omy’s rise and fall. In other words, if the economy is doing well and the stock
market is doing well, cyclical industries tend to do well. When the economy is
doing well, consumers and investors are confident and tend to spend and
invest more money than usual. Real estate and automobiles are great exam-
ples of cyclical industries.
Your own situation offers you some common-sense insight into the concept
of cyclical industries. Think about your behavior as a consumer, and you get
a great clue into the thinking of millions of consumers. Think about the times
you felt good about your career and your finances. When you (and millions of
others) feel good about money and about the future, you have a greater ten-
dency to buy more (and/or more expensive) stuff. When people feel finan-
cially strong, they’re more apt to buy a new house or car or make some other
large financial commitment. Also, people take on more debt because they feel

It takes money to spend money
The economic boom of the late 1990s was in
many respects due to an explosion of spending
financed by debt. Consumers and businesses
felt great about the economy’s expansion and
spent money accordingly. Among the winning
industries were automobiles, real estate, and
technology. Choosing strong stocks in these
categories meant tremendous profits for
investors who did their homework.

confident that they can pay it back. In light of this behavior, what industries
do you think would do well?
The same point also holds for business spending. When businesses think that
economic times are good and foresee continuing good times, they tend to
spend more money on large purchases such as new equipment or technology.
They think that when they’re doing well and flush with financial success, it’s
a good idea to reinvest that money to increase future success.
Defensive industries
Defensive industries are industries that produce goods and services that are
needed no matter what’s happening in the economy. Your common sense
kicks in here. What do you still buy even when times are tough? Think about
what millions of people buy no matter how bad the economy gets. A good
example is food. People still need to eat regardless of good or bad times.
Other examples of defensive industries are utilities and healthcare.
In bad economic times, defensive stocks tend to do better than cyclical
stocks. However, when times are good, cyclical stocks tend to do better than
defensive stocks. Defensive stocks don’t do as well in good times because
people don’t eat twice as much or use up more electricity.
So how do defensive stocks grow? Their growth generally relies on two factors:
 Population growth: As more and more consumers are born, more
people become available to buy.
 New markets: A company can grow by seeking out new groups of con-
sumers who can buy their products and services. Coca-Cola, for exam-
ple, found new markets in Asia during the 1990s. As Communist regimes
fell from power and more societies embraced a free market and con-
sumer goods, the company sold more beverages, and its stock soared.
One way stock investors can invest in a particular industry is to take advan-
tage of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), which have become very popular in
recent years. If you find a winning industry but you can’t find a winning stock
(or don’t want to bother with the necessary research), then ETFs are a great
consideration.
Outlining Key Industries
Not all industries go up and down in tandem. Indeed, at any given time, some
industry is successful no matter what’s happening with the general economy.
In fact, investors have made a lot of money simply by choosing an industry
that benefits from economic trends.
163
Chapter 12: Analyzing Industries

For example, the economy was in bad shape during the 1970s. It was a period
of stagflation — low growth, high unemployment, and high inflation. This
decade was the worst time for the economy since the Great Depression; most
industries (and therefore most stocks) were having tough times. But some
industries did well; in fact, some flourished. Real estate and precious metals,
for example, performed well in this environment. Because the inflation rate
soared into double digits, inflationary hedges such as gold and silver did
very well. During the ’70s, gold skyrocketed from $35 an ounce to $850 an
ounce by the end of the decade. Silver went from under $2 to over $50 in the
same period. What do you think happened to stocks of gold and silver mining
companies? That’s right. They skyrocketed as well. Gold stocks gave
investors spectacular returns.
In the 1980s, the economy became rejuvenated when taxes were cut, regula-
tions were decreased, and inflation fell. Most industries did well. But even in
a growing economy, some industries struggle. Examples of industries that
struggled during that time included precious metals and energy stocks.
Now fast forward to 2005. Think about those industries that struggled and those
that did well. Natural resources (energy, commodities, and so on) and real
estate have done very well in recent years. In the same time frame, industries
such as airlines have had a rough time. Choosing the right industries (or avoid-
ing the wrong) has always been a major factor in successful stock picking.
For sale
I include real estate as a key industry because it’s a cyclical bellwether indus-
try (one that has a great effect on many other industries that may be depen-
dent on it). It’s looked at as a key component of economic health because so
many other industries, including building materials, mortgages, household
appliances, and contract labor services, are tied to it. When the real estate
industry is booming, that bodes well for much of the economy.
Housing starts are one way to measure real estate activity. This data is an
important leading indicator of health in the industry. Housing starts indicate
new construction, which means more business for related industries.
Keep an eye on the real estate industry for negative news that could be bear-
ish for the economy and the stock market. Because real estate is purchased
with mortgage money, investors and analysts watch the mortgage market for
trouble signs such as rising delinquencies and foreclosures. These statistics
serve as a warning for general economic weakness. During 2002–2005, the
real estate industry showed tremendous growth primarily driven by credit. In
April 2005, housing sales hit a record high, but smart investors are exercising
caution because there’s growing evidence of a mania. A “mania” is typically
the final part of a mature bull market. In a mania, the prices of the assets
experiencing the bull market (such as stock or real estate) are skyrocketing
164
Part III: Picking Winners 

to extreme levels, which excite more and more investors as they jump in. As
more investors pile in, this causes the prices to rise even further. It gets to
the point where seemingly everyone thinks that getting rich by buying this
particular asset is easy and almost no one notices that the market has
become unsustainable. After prices are exhausted and start to level off,
investor excitement dies down and then investors try to exit by selling their
holdings to realize some profit. As more and more sell off their holdings,
demand decreases while supply increases. The mania disappears and the
bear market has appeared.
Baby, you can drive my car
The auto industry is another business that you want to watch very carefully.
When cars are selling well, you can generally interpret that as a positive indica-
tor for the economy. People buy new cars when they’re doing well. Autos are
big-ticket items that are another barometer of people’s economic well-being.
Conversely, trouble in the auto industry is a red flag for trouble in the general
economy. If auto repossessions and car loan delinquencies are rising, that’s a
warning about general economic weakness. In early 2005, some weakness def-
initely showed up in the auto industry as GM and Ford continued to have
financial troubles.
Thanking Mr. Roboto
In recent years, technology became very popular with investors. Indeed, it’s a
great sector, and its impact on the economy’s present and future success
can’t be underestimated. The price of shares of technology companies can
rise substantially because investors buy them based on expectations —
today’s untested, unproven companies may become the Microsofts and IBMs
of tomorrow. In spite of the sector’s potential, companies can still fail if cus-
tomers don’t embrace their products. Even in technology stocks, you still
must apply the rules and guidelines that I discuss throughout this book about
financially successful companies. Pick the best in a growing industry, and
you’ll succeed over the long haul. Because technology still hasn’t recovered
from its recent bear market, weakness in the industry means that investors
need to be very picky and cautious.
Banking on it
Banking and financial services are an intrinsic part of any economy. Debt is
the most telling sign of this industry for investors. If a company’s debt is
growing faster than the economy, you need to watch to see how it will impact
its stocks and mutual funds. If debt gets out of control, it can be disastrous
165
Chapter 12: Analyzing Industries

for the economy. As credit specialist Doug Noland points out (his column is
found at www.prudentbear.com), the amount of debt and debt-related
securities recently reached historic and troublesome levels. This trend
means that many financial stocks are at risk if a recession hits anytime soon.

 Checking out bullish opportunities
 Understanding your bearish opportunities
 Getting investment pointers for your unique situation
I
’m thrilled to include this chapter in the 2nd edition of Stock Investing For
Dummies. Yes, you can do your own research (and you want to, don’t
you?), but I may as well make you privy to what my research tells me are 
the unfolding megatrends that offer the greatest potential rewards for stock
investors.
Only a handful of changes in your portfolio over the past four decades would
have made you tremendously rich. Had you put your money into natural
resources (such as gold, silver, and oil) at the beginning of the 1970s and
stayed put until the end of the decade, you would have made a fortune. Then
had you cashed in and switched to Japanese stocks in 1980 and held them for
the rest of the decade, you would have made another fortune. Then had you
switched in 1990 to U.S. stocks for the entire decade, you would have made
yet another fortune. What if you had cashed in your stocks in 2000? Well, for
starters, you would have avoided huge losses in the bear market. How about
being bullish? What looks like a strong bull market for this decade?
By and large, this decade seems to be a repeat of the ’70s. The general realm
of natural resources looks to be the primary bull market for this decade.
Why? First, look at what this decade has in common with the ’70s:
 Problems with energy (rising costs, supply disruptions, and so on)
 Rising inflation (as the dollar loses value versus other currencies)
 International conflict (Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, and so on)
 Sluggish domestic economy
 Rising prices for natural resources (grains, metals, lumber, and so on)

However, this decade has more to consider, including the following:
 Debt, debt, and more debt ($43 trillion as of July 2005 — three and a half
times the U.S. GDP total of $12 trillion)
 The U.S. as a major importer (versus being an exporter in the ’70s)
 China and India as major economic competitors
 Terrorism affecting the U.S. within its borders
 $372 trillion worth of derivatives (nine times larger than the world’s total
GDP! Much of these derivatives are very arcane and risky.)
 Social Security & Medicare liabilities (Rising costs start in 2008 as the
oldest baby boomers start to retire)
This list isn’t comprehensive (due to space limitations). The above points are
enough to make you understand that this investing environment has changed
dramatically and you need to re-focus your overall game plan to keep your
money growing.
By the way, you’ll see two types of opportunities in this chapter: bullish and
bearish. (See Chapter 15 for more information on bullish and bearish mar-
kets.) If I can’t help you find the winning stocks, then by golly I can show you
what losers to stay away from.
Bullish Opportunities
Being bullish (or going “long”) is the natural inclination for most investors.
It’s an easy concept; buy low, sell high. No rocket science there. The following
sections don’t identify every bullish opportunity, but they do cover the most
obvious ones (at least to me).
Commodities: Feeding and 
housing the world
What will have a mega-impact on the world can be boiled down to two words:
China and India. In the past ten years, these two countries have put their
economies on the fast track. Consider the following:
 They have generally turned away from Socialism and a “command econ-
omy” and have instead turned to a free market or more capitalistic
system.
168
Part III: Picking Winners 

 Industrialization, privatization, and profit incentives have ignited
tremendous booms in those countries.
 Both countries’ populations have continued to grow. China has about 1.5
billion people while India recently surpassed 1 billion.
What do these facts mean for stock investors?
Somebody’s got to sell them what they need. China, for example, has a vora-
cious appetite for natural resources such as building materials, energy,
copper, grain, and so on. Companies that have provided the goods and 
services needed do very well. Phelps Dodge Corp., for example, produces
copper and other materials and base metals necessary for industry. In early
2003, its share price was under $30. By August 2005, it was at $110 (up a siz-
zling 266 percent). Compare that performance against a benchmark such as
the S&P 500. During the same time frame, the S&P 500 was basically flat.
Another great example is Archer Daniels Midland Co. It processes and mer-
chandises agricultural commodities and products. In early 2003, you could
have bought its stock for about $10 per share. By the summer of 2005, it hit
$22 (an increase of 120 percent). While many (most?) investors saw their
portfolios go up a little, down a little, or “flatline,” resource investors saw
their stocks do very well.
Of course, China and India are only a part of the world’s emerging markets,
but they’re certainly the most important to Americans (in terms of economic
impact). They are indeed “megatrends” that will either help (or hurt) your
portfolio. In the coming years, demand will likely continue to be strong, and
investors will see the obvious positive implications for solid companies that
meet this demand.
To find out more, check out the resources in Appendix A, such as Jim Rogers’s
book entitled Hot Commodities. You can also conduct research at sites such as
www.futuresource.com, the commodities section of www.marketwatch.
com, and www.bloomberg.com.
Energy
Recent headlines tell me that the costs of energy are a major challenge for
the economy. For decades, U.S. society has benefited from cheap oil, but
global supply and demand (among other things) has caught up with us. A
barrel of oil has gone from $42 in January 2005 to about $67 by August 2005
(nearly a 60 percent increase!). A gallon of gas has seen a similar meteoric
rise. A major news item has been the condition called “Peak Oil” (for more on
this condition, check out the sidebar “Taking a peek at Peak Oil,” later in this
chapter). Energy investors must become familiar with this condition because
169
Chapter 13: Emerging Sector Opportunities

it has (and will) weigh very heavily on the economy, because people are so
dependent on oil for their modern lifestyle. The days of cheap oil are now his-
tory. Higher energy prices will affect all stocks. If you’re going to pay more for
energy, then you may as well benefit.
As energy prices have risen strongly over the past few years, how have
stocks fared? The general stock market (as represented by the Dow Jones
Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index) has done little, say from 2003 to
mid-2005. How about energy stocks? Look at major stocks such as Exxon
Mobil Corp. You could have invested in this company in 2003 for about $35
per share (and you’d get a nice fat dividend, too). By August 2005, the stock
hit $60 (a gain of 71 percent, not including dividends).
Compare Exxon Mobil with a tech stock like Dell (a former high-flying growth
stock). In that same time frame, Dell went from about $31 to $36 (a modest
gain of 16 percent, and it had no dividends). Well, at least it grew.
The bottom line is that stock investors will either have to consider energy in
their investment strategies or risk having energy prices steamroll over their
potential gains. Investment opportunities are plentiful in companies that pro-
vide, sell, distribute, or explore energy. But you may want to consider energy
alternatives as well. America and the world will be forced to turn to alterna-
tive energy sources in the coming years. As conventional oil and gas become
scarce, America will look into gaining energy from sources such as Canada’s
oil sands and also to sources such as wind, solar, and fuel cell technologies,
among others.
As you read this chapter, you may not be sure about what particular com-
pany you should invest in. If that’s the case, why not consider a convenient
way to invest in an entire industry or sector? A good consideration is an
Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). An ETF is like buying a whole portfolio of
stocks as if it was a single stock. An example is an ETF with the symbol XLE.
XLE has a cross section of the largest public oil and gas companies such as
Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and others. In 2003, I bought this XLE for $18 per
share. By August 2005, it hit $50. To find out more about ETFs, go to the
American Stock Exchange (www.amex.com) for all the details.
Gold
Over the ages, gold has come to be synonymous with wealth. In modern
times it has become known as an inflation hedge and “investment insurance,”
especially during times of inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. After being in
a 20-year bear market (from its market top of $850 in 1980 to its low of $252 in
2000), conditions are ripe in the marketplace for a gold bull market that could
reach or surpass its old high. Aggressive investors should be investigating
gold stocks. Why now?
170
Part III: Picking Winners 

According to many (if not most) gold market analysts, such as Bill Murphy 
of the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee (www.gata.org), and sites that
specialize on the gold market, such as www.LeMetropoleCafe.com, www.
gold-eagle.com, and www.kitco.com, the fundamentals for gold are 
more bullish than ever. In recent years, demand has begun to significantly
exceed supply. The shortfall has been filled from gold sales by central banks.
Because of continued and growing demand both in the U.S. and abroad (most
notably India and China), total worldwide annual demand is outstripping
supply by anywhere from 1000–2000 tons (depending on whose estimates
you believe). Juxtapose this demand with current economic conditions (such
as the declining value of the dollar and other paper currencies) and geopoliti-
cal instability, and it’s easy to see that gold and gold-related investments
(such as gold stocks) show bullish potential.
Because gold does well in an inflationary environment, understanding infla-
tion itself is important. Inflation isn’t the price of things going up; it’s the
value of the currency itself going down. The reason it goes down in value is
primarily due to the fact that the government can print money at will (“the
money supply”). When you significantly increase the money supply, you
create a bullish environment for hard assets such as gold.
Gold analysts such as Bill Murphy, Doug Casey, Jay Taylor, James Sinclair, 
and many others easily see the gold price hitting four figures in the not-too-
distant future. In that case, gold mining stocks would perform fantastically
well (not unlike their heyday in the late 1970s). For conservative investors,
consider the large, established mining firms such as Newmont Mining (NEM)
or Gold Corp. (GG). For the more daring, consider junior mining stocks. Do
your research with the Web sites mentioned in this segment.
171
Chapter 13: Emerging Sector Opportunities
Taking a peek at Peak Oil
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, geologist
Marion King Hubbert conducted landmark stud-
ies related to the global supply of oil. His
research indicated that the life of a particular
underground reserve of oil goes through two
phases. During the first phase, the oil can be
easily and inexpensively extracted. However,
after you get past the 50 percent mark, the
remaining oil is very difficult (and hence very
expensive) to extract. That 50 percent mark has
come to be known as “Hubbert’s Peak” and
experts have come to call this condition Peak Oil.
Hubbert correctly made forecasts of when the
major oil-producing countries of the world would
hit this peak. So far the forecasts have been
accurate. The United States hit Hubbert’s Peak
in the early 1970s (American dependence on for-
eign oil grew significantly after that). Current
industry research suggests that all the major oil-
producing countries will reach their peak either
now or before the end of this decade. To find out
more about Peak Oil, check out Web sites such
as the Association for the Study of Peak Oil &
Gas (www.peakoil.net).

A common practice in the mining industry in recent years has been the prac-
tice of forward selling (also called “hedging”). Forward selling is the process
in which a company sells next year’s production at a locked-in price today.
The benefit for the company is that it makes money even if next year’s gold
price stays stable or goes down. However, if gold rises next year, the com-
pany loses out on the potential profit. Since 2000, as gold went from $252 per
ounce all the way to $439 in August 2005 (a 74 percent rise), most un-hedged
gold companies saw their stocks double and triple in the same time frame. In
comparison, hedged gold companies either went up more modestly or not at
all. Some companies even went bankrupt because of hedging.
Silver
I could easily have lumped silver in with gold and just labeled the section
“precious metals,” but I think that silver merits special attention. Out of all
the precious metals (and base metals) that I’ve analyzed, silver probably 
has the strongest potential. Why? Demand for silver is strong and growing
stronger for various reasons (including investment, jewelry, industrial, and 
so on). Yet the above-ground supply of silver has been shrinking for more
than two decades. In fact, silver has been experiencing a chronic deficit for
more than a decade. The U.S. government, for example, had over 1 billion
ounces inventoried as a strategic stockpile. That inventory was depleted as
of early 2004.
Although some point out that silver’s primary use in industry (photography)
is shrinking due to the growing popularity of digital photography, silver
demand has been growing significantly in healthcare, electronics, and mili-
tary equipment. For these reasons, the supply and demand fundamentals are
outstanding. As a matter of fact, silver is more rare than gold. As the market
catches on, silver’s current modest bull market can easily become a “raging
bull.” Here are some bullish factors facing silver in 2005 and beyond:
 43 million oz. deficit according to XYZ industry report
 Major sources of supply are disappearing (China is now an importer)
What’s the potential for stock investors? One way to look at silver today is to
take a look at the last great silver bull market and see how silver stocks per-
formed. In the late 1970s, silver soared from $2 per ounce all the way to $52
per ounce by 1980. In 1975, investors could have bought Lion Mines Co. for
only 7 cents per share. As silver hit its high in 1980, Lion Mines stock hit an
astounding $380 per share. That means that $184 worth of stock in 1975 could
have been worth $1 million only five years later (talk about your silver lining!).

If silver and silver stocks interest you, do your homework. The most widely
followed silver analysts are Ted Butler and David Morgan. The most compre-
hensive Web sites on silver are www.silver-investor.com and www.
silverstrategies.com.
Healthcare
I’m sure that you’ve heard much about the “graying of America.” This phrase
obviously represents a firm megatrend in place. For stock investors, this
megatrend is a purely demographic play and the “numbers” are with you. The
number of people who are over the age of 50, and especially those consid-
ered “senior citizens,” are the fastest growing segment of American society.
The same megatrend is in place in all corners of the world (especially
Europe). As more and more people get into this category, the idea that com-
panies that serve this segment will also prosper becomes a no-brainer. Well-
managed companies that run nursing homes and eldercare services will see
their stocks rise.
Be careful about what healthcare firms you select because this sector can
include stocks that are defensive and also some that are cyclical. Companies
that sell expensive equipment (such as CAT scans or MRI technology) may
not do that well in an economic downturn because hospitals and other
healthcare facilities may not want to upgrade or replace their equipment.
Therefore, healthcare companies that sell big-ticket items can be considered
cyclical. On the other hand, companies that sell medicine (pharmaceuticals)
can be considered defensive. People who need medicine (such as aspirin or
antacids) will buy it no matter how bad the economy is. In fact, people will
probably buy even more aspirin and antacids in bad economic times.
Also be wary of political trends as they affect healthcare. America may be
slowly lurching toward socialized medicine. If this possibility develops, then
turn your bullish expectations into bearish ones. History (and my experi-
ence) tells me that a government takeover of an industry like healthcare
spells danger for investors (and patients, too).
To find out more about healthcare opportunities, check out the industry and
main stocks by using the resources in Appendix A.
National Security
The horrific events of September 11, 2001, remind the world how vulnerable
America is as a free and open society. It has been a brave, new world since.
Americans watch their TV screens and listen to their radios to discover that
terrorism’s wretched tentacles reach across the globe. The most obvious way
173
Chapter 13: Emerging Sector Opportunities

the country can respond is to increase security at home while deploying
forces across the world to combat terrorists and tangle with the countries
that support them. Foes of the U.S. aren’t singular nations that are easily
defined, fought, and defeated within a few months or a few years. Instead,
they’re implacable and virulent, and they’re spread out over many countries.
Securing the nation becomes an unprecedented undertaking. The largest new
federal bureaucracy is Homeland Security. Funding for security measures 
and for military needs is huge and “getting huger” for the foreseeable future.
Because American industry predominantly provides the goods and services
necessary in this extensive national security effort, stock investors should
take notice.
Look at select stocks that serve national defense needs. A good example is
General Dynamics Corporation (GD). In the fall of 2001, the stock was at $60,
and it surpassed $115 by mid-2005 (a 92 percent gain four years later).
Another is Alliant Techsystems, Inc. (ATK), a provider of munitions and
defense systems. Its stock right after 9/11 was about $20. By mid-2005, ATK
was at $76 (a gain of $56 per share or 280 percent in only four years).
As America continues to re-tool its military and as it continues to seek ways
to monitor, track, and attack terrorists, that (unfortunately) bodes well for
companies in the right products and services. For publications that do a
great job informing investors and speculators regarding “the war economy,”
check out the U.S. & World Early Warning Report (www.chaostan.com).
Bearish Outlook
Stocks are versatile in that you can even make money when they go down in
value. Techniques range from “using put options” to “going short” or doing a
short sale of stock. (See Chapter 17 regarding “going short,” and find out
more about put options at www.cboe.com.) For traditional investors, the
more appropriate strategy is first and foremost to “avoid or minimize losses.”
Making money betting that a stock will fall is closer to speculating than actual
investing. So all I want is that investors see the pitfalls and act accordingly.
The following sections offer cautionary alerts to keep you away from trou-
bled areas in the economy (or find speculative opportunities to short
stocks).
Warning on housing
Real estate investing has been all the rage in recent years. As I do my semi-
nars across the country, I see the adult education programs top-heavy in real
estate courses. “How to Get Rich in Real Estate.” “Buy Real Estate with No
Money Down.” But I think “Real Estate Meets Frankenstein” is more like it.
174
Part III: Picking Winners 

In the old days, when asked the question about how to be successful invest-
ing in real estate, the answer was always “location, location, location.” In this
decade, that answer has morphed into “credit, credit, credit,” which — if
you’re not careful — is really “debt, debt, debt.” You come to see that the
housing bubble isn’t really a problem; it’s a symptom. If it is a symptom, then
what is the problem? The problem with real estate in recent years has really
been too much debt, very lax lending standards, and rampant speculation. By
the second quarter of 2005, the data clearly shows a real estate market that’s
overheated, overpriced, seriously imbalanced, and plainly unsustainable.
Most mortgages issued have been either adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs),
interest-only mortgages, or negative amortization mortgages. In the latter two
mortgages, buyers only pay interest and put no dent into the principal. In
addition, many of these mortgages are being issued to buyers who are “sub-
prime,” which means that their credit is less than strong, so to speak. These
people have purchased a house and used “creative” financing to lower the
monthly payment. When interest rates (and other costs such as real estate
taxes) rise, millions of over-burdened property owners will have financial
problems and this will have a negative effect on the overall economy.
On top of that, many of these mortgages are issued at 100 percent of the
property’s market value. When you add up these troublesome mortgages,
they easily exceed $2 trillion. The value of all mortgages now exceeds 80 per-
cent of the value of America’s GDP. Some analysts will tell you that this isn’t a
problem because “the economy is strong and job growth is good.” What they
don’t see is that during 2004–2005, the economy’s GDP expanded primarily
due to real estate. And real estate (and related industries) accounted for 43
percent of the jobs created since 2001. As housing & construction begin to
decline due to overbuilding (more supply) and fewer buyers (lower demand),
that means a shrinking real estate market and fewer jobs. As the housing
market gets into trouble, this will harm the economy. As the robot on the old
TV show “Lost in Space” used to say, “Warning Will Robinson! Danger!
Danger!”
What should stock investors be looking at? The most obvious thing to look at
is housing stocks. The stock market tends to be a leading indicator of how
well (or how poorly) the economy is doing. Frequently, subsections of the
stock market give you clues about a particular industry. Housing stocks (as
of August 2005) have come down substantially from their highs in July 2005.
Among the first things I ask myself about the direction of an industry is “How
are insiders behaving in the main companies of that industry?”
During 2000–2005, as real estate was on a blazing hot streak, the home build-
ing stocks were also very bullish. A good example was Toll Brothers (TOL).
That stock was on a meteoric rise during the 12-month period ending in mid-
2005. From July to July, it went from $20 (price adjusted for split) to $57 — a
gain of 185 percent! Guess what? In July ’05, most of the insiders sold their
stock. By August 2005, the stock was already down more than 20 percent.
Hmmm. Coincidence? I think not! Homebuilders are among the first to see
175
Chapter 13: Emerging Sector Opportunities

what’s going on in their industry. Similar events occurred at other companies
in the industry. The industry has probably hit its peak and sales will soften.
Saying that its torrid pace is over is probably safe. What’s a stock investor 
to do?
First of all, be safe. Minimize exposure to this vulnerable sector. I’m not just
talking about real estate directly, but also indirectly. Companies and indus-
tries that are reliant on the housing sector are also at risk, such as some
financial institutions, suppliers, and so on. For those of you who are aggres-
sive, bearish strategies (like going short or, even better, buying put options)
are a good speculation. To find out more about what’s going on with this his-
toric and gigantic housing bubble, check out some great Web sites, such as
www.housingbubble.blogspot.com and www.realestatebubble.net.
The great credit monster
Too much debt means that someone will get hurt. As the unprecedented
explosion in debt gave a huge “boost” to the economy in the late 1990s, it
now poses great dangers for the rest of this decade. This massive debt prob-
lem is obviously tied to the previous topic of real estate. However, it goes
much further. Individuals, companies, and government agencies are carrying
too much debt for comfort. It’s not just mortgage debt; it’s also consumer,
business, government, and margin debt. With total debt now in the vicinity of
40–43 trillion dollars, saying that a lot of this debt won’t be repaid is probably
a safe bet. Individual and institutional defaults will rock the economy and the
financial markets. Bankruptcy will be a huge issue (in spite of bankruptcy
reforms that became law on October 17, 2005).
Debt will (does) weigh heavily on stocks either directly or indirectly. Because
every type of debt is now at record levels, no one is truly immune. Say the
stock you have is in a retailer that has no debt whatsoever. Are you immune?
Not really, because consumer debt (credit cards, personal loans, and so on)
is at an all-time high. If consumer spending declines, then the retailer’s sales
go down, its profits shrink, and . . . ultimately . . . its stock goes down.
Exposure to debt is quite pervasive. Check your 401(k) plan, your bond
funds, and your insurance company’s annuity. Why? Remember those mort-
gages I spoke about earlier in this chapter? Banks and mortgage companies
issued trillions of dollars worth of those mortgages in recent years. But after
the mortgages were issued, they were sold to other financial institutions.
Huge amounts were sold to the most obvious buyers, the Federal National
Mortgage Association (FNM) and the Federal Mortgage Assurance
Corporation (FRE). These giant government-sponsored entities are usually
referred to as “Fannie Mae” and “Freddie Mac.” They hold many mortgages
but they also package and resell these mortgages to third parties, such as
pension plans, corporations, and insurance companies. Remember that many
of these mortgages are “sub-prime” (that is to say, risky). Hmmm. There goes
that alarmist robot with the flailing arms again.

What’s a stock investor to do? Well, remember that first commandment to
“avoid or minimize losses.” Make sure that you review your portfolio and sell
stocks that may get pulverized by the credit monster. Make sure that the
companies themselves have no, low, or manageable debt. (Check their finan-
cial reports. See Chapter 11 for more details.) For the venturesome, seek
shorting opportunities in those companies most exposed to the dangers of
debt. (For more information on shorting, go to Chapter 17.)
Cyclical stocks
The environment is generally bullish for stocks and can be quite bearish for
some vulnerable groups such as the “cyclical” stocks. Heavy equipment,
automobiles, and technology tend to be cyclical and are very susceptible to
downturns in the general economy. Conversely, cyclical stocks do very well
when the economy is growing or on an upswing (hence the label).
As individuals and corporations get squeezed with more debt and less dis-
posable income, hard choices need to be made. Ultimately, the result is that
people buy fewer “big-ticket” items. That means that a company selling these
items ends up selling less and earning less profit. This loss of profit, in turn,
makes that company’s stock go down.
Companies that experience lagging sales often turn to aggressive discounting.
Recently, General Motors Corporation (GM) and Ford Motor Company (F)
offered “employee discount” sales to the public. Both companies have been
experiencing plunging sales and profits and ballooning debt in recent years.
Subsequently, both companies have seen their stocks plummet (over 50 per-
cent share price decline) during most of 2005.
In a struggling, recessionary economy, investing in cyclical stocks is like 
sunbathing on an ant hill and using jam instead of sun block. Not a pretty 
picture.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit its all-time high of 11,722 in January
2000. Five years later, it’s still stuck in the range of 10,000–11,000. While some
stock groups have grown very well, stocks in general have struggled. Some
sectors have done much worse. Choosing the right sector is critical for your
stock investing success.
Important for Bulls & Bears
I just want to reiterate some points that apply here. I don’t presume that
stocks go straight up or that they zig-zag upward indefinitely. Your due 
diligence is necessary for your success. Make sure that you’re investing
177
Chapter 13: Emerging Sector Opportunities

appropriately for your situation. If you’re 35 and heading into your peak earn-
ings years and want to “ride a home-run stock,” and you understand the
risks, then go ahead and speculate with that small-cap gold mining stock or
the solar power technology junior stock.
But if you’re more risk adverse or your situation is screaming out loud for
you to be conservative, then don’t speculate. Go instead with a more diversi-
fied portfolio of large-cap stocks or get the ETF for that particular sector.
For those people who want to make money by “going short” in those sectors
that look bearish, again take a deep breath and remember what’s appropri-
ate. Conservative investors will simply avoid the risky areas. Aggressive
investors or speculators may want to deploy profitable bearish strategies
(with a portion of their investable funds). Here are some highlights for all 
of you.
Conservative and bullish
Once you choose a promising sector, just select large-cap companies that are
financially strong, are earning a profit, have low debt, and are market leaders.
This entire book shows you how to do just that. However, you may not like
the idea of buying stocks directly. Consider either sector mutual funds or
ETFs. That way you can choose the industry and be able to effectively buy a
basket of the top stocks in that area. ETFs have been a hot item lately, and I
think that they’re a great consideration for most investors because they offer
some advantages over mutual funds. For example, you can put stop loss
orders on them or borrow against them in your stock portfolio. Check with
your financial advisor to see whether ETFs are appropriate for you.
Being conservative and bullish is proper when you’re in (or near) retirement,
have a family to support, or live in a very large shoe with so many kids that
you don’t know what to do.
Aggressive and bullish
If you’re aggressive and bullis you want to buy the stocks directly. For real
growth potential, look at mid-caps or small-caps. Remember that you’re spec-
ulating, so you understand the downside risk but are willing to tolerate the
risk because the upside potential can reward you so handsomely. Few things
in the investment world give you a better gain than a super-charged stock in
a hot sector.
178
Part III: Picking Winners 

Conservative and bearish
For many (if not most) investors, making money on a falling market isn’t gen-
erally a good idea. Doing so takes a lot of expertise and risk tolerance. Really,
for conservative investors, the key word is “safety.” Analyze your portfolio
with an advisor you trust and sell the potentially troubled stocks. If you’re
not sure what to do on a particular stock, then (at the very least) put in stop
loss orders and make them GTC (good til cancelled). (See Chapter 17 for
details.) As odd as it sounds, sometimes losing less than others makes you
come out ahead if you play it right.
For example, look at the bear market that hit the U.S. in the mid-1970s. In
1974–75, the stock market fell 45 percent. Stocks didn’t recover until 1982. If
you had a stock that was at $100, that means it would have fallen to $55 and
not returned to $100 until eight years later. Whew! Sometimes just burying
your money in the backyard sounds like genius. What if you had a stop loss
at $90? You would have gotten out with a minimal loss and could have rein-
vested the money elsewhere (such as bonds or CDs) and looked much
brighter than your neighbor feverishly digging for money in his backyard.
Aggressive and bearish
Being aggressive in a bearish market isn’t for the faint of heart. However, this
is where the quickest fortunes have been made by some of history’s greatest
investors. Going short can make you great money when the market is bearish
but it can sink you if you’re wrong. I usually don’t tell my clients and students
to “short a stock” because it can backfire. Yes, ways to go short with less risk
are out there, but I prefer to buy put options.
Put options are a way to make money with limited risk when you essentially
make a bet on an investment (such as stocks) that it will go down. Obviously,
options go beyond the scope of this book, but at least let me give you some
direction, because there is an appropriate options strategy for most stock
portfolios. You can find great (free) tutorials on using options at Web sites
such at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (www.cboe.com) and at the
Options Industry Council site (www.888options.com).
Diversification
This point is self-explanatory, right? If you take a portfolio approach and
spread your capital across three to five sectors, then you’re making a “safer
bet.” And don’t forget the trailing stop loss strategy (see Chapter 17). ’Nuff
said.

 Looking at the effects of politics on the economy
 Taking a crash course in general economics
P
olitics can be infuriating, disruptive, meddlesome, corrupting, and harm-
ful. But . . . enough positive spin! I’ll try to be negative too. Even if poli-
tics doesn’t amuse or interest you, you can’t ignore it. If you aren’t careful, it
can wreak great havoc on your portfolio. Politics wields great influence with
the economic and social environment, which in turn affects how companies
succeed or fail. This success or failure in turn either helps or hurts your
stock’s price. Politics (manifested in taxes, regulations, and legislation) can
make or break a company or industry quicker than any other external force.
Economics — how people spend, save, and invest their money in society —
also does its share to drive stock prices up and down.
What people must understand (especially government policy makers) is 
that a new tax, law, regulation, or government action has a macro effect on a
stock, an industry, or even an entire economic system, whereas a company
has a micro effect on an economy. The following gives you a simple snapshot
of these effects:
Politics →policy →economy →industry →the company →the stock →
stock investor
Now, this chapter doesn’t moralize about politics or advocate a political
point of view; after all, this book is about stock investing. In general, policies
can be good or bad regardless of their effect on the economy — some poli-
cies are enacted to achieve greater purposes even if they kick you in the
wallet. However, in the context of this chapter, politics is covered from a
cause-and-effect perspective: How does politics affect prosperity in general
and stock investing in particular?

A proficient stock investor cannot — must not — look at stocks as though
they exist in a vacuum. My favorite example of this rule is the idea of fish in a
lake. You can have a great fish (your stock) among a whole school of fish (the
stock market) in a wonderful lake (the economy). But what if the lake gets
polluted (bad policy)? What happens to the fish? Politics controls the lake
and can make it hospitable — or dangerous — for the participants. You get
the point. The example may sound too simple, yet it isn’t. So many people —
political committees, corporate managers, bureaucrats, and politicians —
still get it so wrong time and time again, to the detriment of the economy and
stock investors.
Although the two get inexorably intertwined, I try to treat politics and eco-
nomics as separate issues.
Avoiding the Bull When Elephants 
and Donkeys Talk Turkey
The campaigns heat up. Democrats, Republicans, and smaller parties vie for
your attention and subsequent votes. Conservatives, liberals, socialists, mod-
erates, and libertarians joust in the battlefield of ideas. But, after all is said
and done, voters make their decisions. Election day brings a new slate of
politicians into power, and they, in turn, joust and debate on new rules and
programs in the legislative halls of power. Before and after election time,
investors must keep a watchful eye.
For stock investors, politics manifests itself as a major factor in investment-
making decisions in ways shown in Table 13-1.

Possible Legislation
Effect on Investing
Taxes
Will a new tax affect a particular stock (industry or econ-
omy)? Generally, more or higher taxes ultimately have a
negative impact on stock investing. Income taxes and
capital gains taxes are good examples.
Laws
Will Congress (or, in some instances, state legislatures)
pass a law that will have a negative impact on a stock, the
industry, or the economy? Price controls — laws that set
the price of a product, service, or commodity — are
examples of negative laws.

Possible Legislation
Effect on Investing
Regulations
Will a new (or existing) regulation have a negative (or pos-
itive) effect on the stock of your choice? Generally, more
or tougher regulations have a negative impact on stocks.
Government 
If government agencies spend too much or misallocate 
spending and debt
resources, they may create greater burdens on society,
which in turn will be bearish for the economy and the
stock market. (For information on investing in bear or bull
markets, see Chapter 15.)
Money supply
The U.S. money supply — the dollars you use — is con-
trolled by the Federal Reserve. It’s basically a governmen-
tal agency that serves as America’s central bank. How
can it affect stocks? You can find more on this question in
the “Showing interest in the Fed” section, later in the
chapter.
Interest rates
The Federal Reserve has crucial influence here. It can
raise key interest rates that in turn can have an effect on
the entire economy and the stock market. I cover this
effect in the “Showing interest in the Fed” section, later in
this chapter.
183
Chapter 14: Money, Mayhem, and Votes
Doomed to repeat it?
History provides abundant lessons for stock
investors because you can easily see how gov-
ernment policies have impacted our economy in
general and the stock market specifically. The
greatest financial calamities in history occurred
either because politicians made mistakes or
because they made purposeful policies that
produced unintended negative effects.
During the 1920s and 1930s, Presidents Herbert
Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress
produced disastrous policies that turned what
should have been a minor recession into the
Great Depression. From 1928 to 1938, federal gov-
ernment spending ballooned out of control, and
stringent regulations were placed on the coun-
try’s domestic economy and its international
trade (including the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act).
These events, along with increasing income tax
rates to 91 percent (yikes!), placed a drag on
economic growth that lasted an entire decade.
How did successful stock investors react in
those tough years? In the late 1920s, when the
signs of pending trouble were clearly becoming
evident, alert investors such as Bernard Baruch
got out of the stock market before it crashed in
1929, when the Great Depression produced the
“mother of all bear markets.”

When many of the items in Table 13-1 work in tandem, they can have a magni-
fied effect that can have tremendous consequences for your stock portfolio.
Alert investors keep a constant vigil when the legislature is open for busi-
ness, and they adjust their portfolios accordingly.
Understanding price controls
Stock investors should be very wary of price controls (they’re a great exam-
ple of regulation). A price control is a fixed price on a particular product,
commodity, or service mandated by the government.
Price controls have been tried continuously throughout history, and they
have continuously been removed because they ultimately do more harm than
good. It’s easy to see why. Imagine that you run a business that sells chairs,
and a law is passed that states, “From this point onward, chairs can be sold
only for $10.” If all your costs stay constant at $9 or less, the regulation isn’t
that bad. However, price controls put two dynamics in motion. First, the arti-
ficially lower price encourages consumption — more people buy chairs.
Secondly, production is discouraged. Who wants to make chairs if they can’t
sell them for a decent profit?
What happens to the company with a fixed sales price (in this example, $10)
and rising costs? Profits shrink, and depending on how long the price con-
trols are in effect, the company eventually experiences losses. The chair pro-
ducer is eventually driven out of business. The chair-building industry
shrinks, and a chair shortage is the result. Profits (and jobs) soon vanish. So
what happens if you own stock in a company that builds chairs? I’ll just say
that if I tell you which way the stock price is going, you better be sitting down
(if, of course, you have a chair).
Ascertaining the political climate
The bottom line is that you ignore political realities at your own (economic)
risk. To be and stay aware, ask yourself the following questions about the
stock of each company in which you invest:
 What laws will directly affect my stock investment adversely?
 Will any laws affect that company’s industry?
 Will any current or prospective laws affect the company’s sources of 
revenue?
184
Part III: Picking Winners 

 Will any current or prospective laws affect the company’s expenses or
supplies?
 Am I staying informed about political and economic issues that may pos-
sibly have a negative impact on my investment?
 Will such things as excessive regulations, price controls, or new taxes
have a negative impact on my stock’s industry?
Oil and gas service and exploration companies benefited from the U.S. need
for more energy supplies. But investment opportunities didn’t stop there. 
As oil and gas supplies became costly and problematic, alternative energy
sources gained national attention. The debate was rekindled on solar power
and exciting new technologies, such as fuel cells. As traditional sources of
energy (sweet crude) became more expensive, alternate sources became
more economical. Investors who anticipated the new interest in alternative
energy sought companies that would logically benefit. A good example of this
is Evergreen Solar, Inc. (ESLR). The firm’s stock rose from $2.50 in September
2004 to $8 by September 2005; just a scant 12 months later. With an impres-
sive 220 percent gain, proactive investors sang “Here Comes the Sun” without
getting burned.
Politics and economics are a double-edged sword. Understand them, and you
can profit; misunderstand them, and you become a financial victim.
Discovering systemic and 
nonsystemic effects
Politics can affect your investments in two basic ways: systemic and 
nonsystemic.
Nonsystemic means that the system isn’t affected but a particular participant
is affected. A systemic effect means that all the players in that system are
affected. In this case, the “system” is the economy at large. Politics imposes
itself (through taxes, laws, regulations, and so on) and has an undue influ-
ence on all the members of that system.
Nonsystemic
Say that you decide to buy stock in a company called Golf Carts Unlimited,
Inc. (GCU). You believe that the market for golf carts has great potential and
that GCU stands to grow substantially. How can politics affect GCU?
185
Chapter 14: Money, Mayhem, and Votes

What if politicians believe that GCU is too big and that it controls too much of
the golf cart industry? Maybe they view GCU as a monopoly and want the fed-
eral government to step in to shrink GCU’s reach and influence for the benefit
of competition and consumers. Maybe the government believes that GCU
engages in unfair or predatory business practices and that it’s in violation of
antitrust (or antimonopoly) laws. If the government acts against GCU, the
action is a nonsystemic issue: The action is directed toward the participant
(in this case, GCU) and not the golf cart industry.
What happens if you’re an investor in GCU? Does your stock investment
suffer as a result of government action directed against the company? Let’s
just say that the stock price will hook left and end up in the lake.
Systemic
Say that politicians want to target the golf industry for intervention because
they maintain that golf should be free for all to participate in and that a law
must be passed to make it accessible to all, especially those people who 
can’t afford to play. So to remedy the situation, the following law is enacted:
“Law #67590305598002 declares that from this day forward, all golf courses
that operate must charge only one dollar for any golfer who chooses to 
participate.”
That law sounds great to any golfer. But what are the unintended effects
when such a law becomes reality? Many people agree with the sentiment of
the law, but what about the cause-and-effect aspects of it? Obviously, all
things being equal, golf courses will be forced to close. Staying in business is
uneconomical if their costs are higher than their income. If they can’t charge
any more than a dollar, how can they possibly stay open? Ultimately (and
ironically), no one can play golf.
186
Part III: Picking Winners 
Playing monopoly
Government action against large companies for
real (or alleged) abuses has happened many
times. In 2004, the New York State Attorney
General targeted insurer American International
Group, Inc. (AIG). In a few months, AIG’s stock
fell from $74 to a low of $50 in April 2005. Long-
time investors remember how companies such
as IBM (in the 1970s) and Microsoft (during 1999
and 2000) faced monopolistic allegations. The
federal government is a massive entity, and it has
trillions of taxpayer dollars at its disposal. When
it targets a company, regardless of the merits of
the case, avoid investing in that company (until
the trouble has passed). Investors should be
wary when the government starts making noise
about any company and potential legal actions
against it.

What happens to investors of Golf Carts Unlimited, Inc.? If the world of golf
shrinks, then demand for golf carts shrinks as well. The value of GCU’s stock
will certainly be “triple-bogeyed.”
Examples of politics creating systemic problems are endless, but you get the
point.
Poking into politics: Resources
To find out about new laws being passed or proposed, check out Congress and
what’s going on at its primary Web sites: the U.S. House of Representatives
(www.house.gov) and the U.S. Senate (www.senate.gov). For presidential
information and proposals, check the White House’s Web site at www.white
house.gov.
You also may want to check out THOMAS, the service performed by the
Library of Congress, at http://thomas.loc.gov. THOMAS is a search
engine that helps you find any piece of legislation either by bill number 
or keyword. This search engine is an excellent way to find out whether an
industry is being targeted for increased regulation or deregulation. In the 
late 1980s, real estate was hit hard when the government passed new regula-
tions and tax rules (related stocks went down). When the telecom industry
was deregulated in the mid-1990s, the industry grew dramatically (related
stocks went up).
You can find more resources in Appendix A. The more knowledge you pick up
about how politics and government actions can help (or harm) an invest-
ment, the better you’ll be at growing (and protecting) your wealth.
Easing into Economics
Economics sounds like a deadly dull pursuit. Actually, the wrong book on 
the topic or the wrong instructor can make the topic so boring that you feel
like you’re crawling backward through Death Valley. Economics really does
matter, but do you have to really understand phrases such as “inelasticity
coefficient” and the “Index of Leading Economic Indicators”? No, not really.
But do you need to be familiar with phrases such as “supply and demand”
and “price controls don’t work” to operate in today’s modern stock market?
The answer is a resounding yes. Of course, you can invest without knowing
much about economics. However, your chances for success are tremen-
dously enhanced when you have a basic understanding of how economics
works. Actually, economics explained in the proper way is fascinating.
Knowing how the world ticks can be fun and profitable.
187
Chapter 14: Money, Mayhem, and Votes

Understanding economic impact
When people comment about the economy, they make it sound like a giant,
amorphous thing in the same way they talk about the stock market and the
weather. To put it into perspective, the economy is you and me and millions 
of others — producers, consumers, entrepreneurs, and workers all trading
money for goods and services. The economy is millions of people and organi-
zations voluntarily transacting with each other day in and day out. People and
organizations buy, spend, save, and invest billions every hour of every day.
Looking at the economy is like seeing a huge picture and deciding where on
the canvas are the greatest points of interest — investment opportunities.
When you look at the economy, you look at the major numbers and trends
and judge whether a particular company is well suited to profit from trends
and opportunities. You simply rely on your common sense and apply it with
the statistics that track the economy in general. If millions of consumers are
buying product X and the market and demand for X are growing, then it
stands to reason that the best company offering product X will prosper as
well. The reverse can be true as well: If more and more people avoid, or just
don’t spend their money on, a particular product or industry, then the for-
tunes of those companies will decline as well.
Economic reports are important because sometimes just one report or statis-
tic released is enough to move the stock market. The economic statistics and
reports that are the most meaningful to you are the ones that have a direct
bearing on your stock or industry. If you invest in real estate or construction
stocks, reports that cover housing starts and interest rates are critical to you.
If you invest in retail stocks, then information on consumer confidence and
debt is important to you.
In the following table, I give some examples of key industries and a statistic
that’s a relevant indicator:
Industry
Statistic
Comments
Real estate
Housing starts
This indicator tracks permits given for
new housing to be built. Rising housing
starts are desirable.
Auto

The industry’s annual sales figure is a

are desirable.
Retail

The overall sales are watched, and you
want them to be rising (especially in the

Note: Industry trade publications and general financial publications, such as
The Wall Street Journal and Investor’s Business Daily, regularly report this
data. You can also find it (along with a tremendous database of economic
data and statistics) at www.freelunch.com.
What are some important things in economic data that you want to be aware
of? Keep reading. The following sections make this information clear.
Grossing you out with GDP
Gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the nation’s total output of
goods and services for the quarter, is considered the broadest measure of
economic activity. Although it’s measured in dollars (the U.S. GDP surpassed
$12 trillion by July 2005), it’s usually quoted as a percentage. You typically
hear a news report that says something like, “The economy grew by 2.5 per-
cent last quarter.” Because the GDP is an important overall barometer for the
economy, it should be a positive number. The report on GDP is released quar-
terly by the Commerce Department (www.doc.gov).
You should regularly monitor the GDP along with economic data that relates
directly to your stock portfolio. The following list gives some general guide-
lines for evaluating GDP:
 Over 3 percent: This number indicates strong growth and bodes well for
stocks. At 5 percent or higher, the economy is sizzling!
 1 to 3 percent: This figure indicates moderate growth and can occur
either as the economy is rebounding from a recession or as it’s slowing
down from a previously strong period.
 0 percent or negative (as low as –3 percent): This number isn’t good
and indicates that the economy is either not growing or is actually
shrinking a bit. A negative GDP is considered recessionary (meaning that
the economy’s growth is receding).
 Under –3 percent: A GDP this low indicates a very difficult period for
the economy. A GDP under –3 percent, especially for two or more quar-
ters, indicates a serious recession or possibly a depression.
Looking at a single quarter isn’t that useful. Track GDP over many quarters to
see which way the general economy is trending. When you look at GDP for a
particular quarter of a year, ask yourself whether it’s better (or worse) than
the quarter before. If it’s better (or worse), then ask yourself to what extent it
has changed. Is it dramatically better (or worse) than the quarter before? Is
the economy showing steady growth, or is it slowing? If several quarters
show solid growth, the overall economy is generally bullish.
189
Chapter 14: Money, Mayhem, and Votes

Traditionally, if two or more consecutive quarters show negative growth
(economic output is shrinking), the economy is considered to be in a reces-
sion. A recession can be a painful necessity; it usually occurs when the econ-
omy can’t absorb the total amount of goods being produced due to too much
excess production. A bear market in stocks usually accompanies a recession.
GDP is just a rough estimate at best. It can’t possibly calculate all the factors
that go into economic growth. For example, crime has a negative effect on
economic growth, but it’s not reflected in GDP. Still, most economists agree
that GDP provides a ballpark snapshot of the overall economy’s progress.
Showing interest in the Fed
The Federal Reserve System (often called simply the Fed) is the nation’s inde-
pendent central bank. It plays a pivotal role in the U.S. economy and —
because the United States is the most powerful economy — in the global
economy as well.
For more information about the Fed’s money supply and interest rate poli-
cies, go to its Web site at www.federalreserve.gov. Also, the American
Institute for Economic Research (www.aier.org) offers useful, readable
research on the relationships between money growth, interest rates, and the
stock market.
The Fed is one of the most closely watched institutions in the world because
it has such an impact on financial markets as well as the growth of the U.S.
economy. Although it performs a number of functions, the Fed’s most funda-
mental roles are
 Controlling the money supply: Because the Fed controls the actual
quantity of dollars that goes into circulation, it has the responsibility of
fighting or controlling inflation. People think that inflation is the cost of
goods and services going up, when actually inflation refers to the value
of money going down because of too much money in the marketplace
(the currency being “inflated”). In other words, too many dollars are
chasing too few goods and services.
The Fed tries to manage the very difficult task of having just the right
amount of money in the economy. Having too much money can create
inflation, meaning that consumers see the purchasing power of their dol-
lars shrink. Too little money means that not enough money is circulating
in the economy. (In these financial conditions, some people use the ter-
minology “tight money,” and others say that “the economy lacks liquid-
ity.”) Inflation, if not held in check, can have very negative consequences.
After all, how would you feel if the money in your pocket was rapidly
shrinking in value? (The odds are that you’d feel like a parent with too
many teenagers in the house!)

Inflation is reported as the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI (also
known as the cost-of-living index) is calculated by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (www.dol.gov) and measures changes in the price of a typical
basket of consumer goods that reflect what the average consumer buys
on a regular basis. The CPI is considered a warning of pending inflation.
 Influencing interest rates: Financial markets, such as the stock market
and the bond market, closely monitor the Fed’s influence on interest
rates. Because the Fed can raise or lower some key interest rates at will,
its actions become a powerful lever that can raise or lower many rates
that literally millions of individuals and businesses pay primarily on
their short-term debt.
You need to watch interest rates for several reasons:
• Interest rates affect corporate earnings. If companies pay more
interest, that additional cost directly affects their profits. If profits
shrink, then that puts downward pressure on stock prices.
Conversely, if the Fed cuts interest rates, companies will typically
see a positive impact on profits.
• Interest rates influence income investors. (See Chapter 9 for more
on income investing.) Investors looking for a higher return on their
investments will make decisions to pull their money out of stocks
and into other vehicles such as bonds or bank accounts. When
interest rates continue to climb, more and more investors sell their
stocks, sending stock prices down.
• Interest rates figure prominently in fighting inflation. Generally,
interest rates have been a key weapon in the past 20 years in fight-
ing inflation. Because inflation means that the value of a dollar
shrinks, the Fed uses higher interest rates to offset this devalua-
tion. In the late 1970s, when inflation hovered near double-digit
rates, interest rates went through the roof (surpassing 15 percent).
Conversely, lower interest rates coupled with an expanding money
supply can ignite higher inflation.
Debting your sweet bippy
Debt can be very burdensome and have a negative impact on economic
growth. As an investor, you need to know how much debt is in the economy
and whether the debt is growing or shrinking. Whether the debt is consumer
(credit cards, mortgages, and so on) or corporate (short-term borrowing,
bonds, and so on), it will harm the economy if not kept under control.
A major reason for the economy’s (and stock market’s) downturn in 2000–2002
was massive debt. In fact, during the 1990s, virtually every major category of
debt hit record levels. The only ways to remove debt are to pay it off or go
bankrupt. Because so many individuals and businesses became overextended
in debt during that time period, bankruptcies hit record levels as well.
191
Chapter 14: Money, Mayhem, and Votes

Stock investors must monitor debt levels for bear market potential (espe-
cially in this decade!). Too much debt slows the economy, which in turn can
adversely affect the stock market. Overly indebted individuals don’t have
money to spend or invest. Overly indebted companies may face employee
layoffs, cuts in spending, declining profits, and other negative actions. Watch
also for corporate problems. If you have stock in a company that has too
much debt or that sells to customers who are overburdened with debt, then
that company will suffer. The Fed and other sources, including such publica-
tions as The Wall Street Journal, report consumer and corporate debt levels.
Raising confident consumers
As you often hear on television, consumer spending accounts for two-thirds
of the economy. Therefore, the consumer’s behavior is something that
investors watch carefully. You can break down consumer activity into two
categories:
 Consumer income: If consumer income meets or exceeds the CPI rate
(see “Showing interest in the Fed,” earlier in this chapter), that bodes
well for the economy.
 Consumer confidence: This index is measured by prominent surveys
that essentially track how consumers feel about the economy in general
and their personal situations in particular. The University of Michigan
and the Conference Board (which presents its survey in the Consumer
Confidence Index) do the most widely-followed surveys. If consumers
feel good about the economy and their immediate futures, that bodes
well for consumer spending.
Lumping together the data with economic indexes
Because so much economic data is available, many investors prefer to look at
indexes that put the data in a nutshell. Indexes try to summarize many eco-
nomic indicators and put them into a neat, digestible format.
Economic indicators are grouped into categories that try to give a rough idea
about the economy’s upward and downward cycle. These cyclical indicators
are put in three categories that try to time the various phases of the econ-
omy’s movement:
 Leading: The leading indicators try to be predictive of the economy’s
path. Stock investors are particularly interested in leading economic
indicators because stock investors usually don’t invest because of past
or present conditions — investors buy stocks because of expectations
for the future.
192
Part III: Picking Winners 

 Coincident: The coincident indicators essentially tell you where the
economy is right now. (For stock investors, most coincident indicators
are like the indicator on your car’s dashboard blinking “hot” when you
see steam rising from your hood.) The most valuable coincident indica-
tor is the GDP. (See the section “Grossing you out with GDP,” earlier in
this chapter.)
 Lagging: This type of indicator tells you what just passed in the econ-
omy’s path (which can be significant because some lagging indicators do
precede leading indicators). The unemployment rate is a good example
of a lagging indicator.
Of the three categories, the most widely followed is the Index of Leading
Economic Indicators (LEI). A good example of an indicator that’s included in
the LEI is the statistic on new construction. If more new construction is being
started, that’s a positive harbinger of economic growth. The Conference
Board (www.conferenceboard.org) compiles the LEI monthly.
Inquiring about economics: Resources
Keep in mind that, because of the scope of the topic and the finite number of
pages in this book, this chapter can’t do justice to the burgeoning world of
economics. I encourage you to continue learning about economics by doing
some easy and interesting research with the resources listed here and in
Appendix A.
Turn to the following sources for economic data:

Predicting the economic weather
Excellent sources are available that make the
arcane world of economics more readable and
understandable. One is the American Institute for
Economic Research (AIER), a nonprofit organiza-
tion that offers excellent information for begin-
ners on economics and markets. AIER offers a
booklet called Forecasting Business Trends that
gives investors some clear yet detailed explana-
tions and insights on the business cycle. To find
out more, write to American Institute for
Economic Research, P.O. Box 1000, Great
Barrington, MA 01230, or visit its Web site at
www.aier.org. Another source with excel-
lent essays and easy-to-read analysis is the
Ludwig von Mises Institute at www.mises.
org. By the way, as you navigate the world of
economics, you’ll come across various “schools
of thought.” The most well-known is the
Keynesian school and the most problematic is the
Marx school (by the way, Groucho knows more
than Karl). In my opinion and experience, the best
is the Austrian school of economics (Mises is
considered the “dean” of this school). Austrian
economists have been the most accurate in inter-
preting and forecasting economic events. Among
the events they warned about were the Great
Depression, the collapse of communism, and the
dangers of America’s current mammoth debt
bubble.

uccessful stock investing is more than choosing a par-
ticular stock. It’s also understanding the environment
in which the market operates. Just as goldfish can thrive in
good water (or die in bad water), the stock market reacts
to the general economic climate. Successful investors
go beyond merely picking good stocks and watching the
financial news. They implement techniques and strategies
that help them either minimize losses or maximize gains
(hopefully both). The chapters in this part introduce some
of the most effective investing techniques to help you profit
from stocks in a bull or a bear market and describe some
smart ways to hold on to more of your profits when tax
time rolls around.

U
nderstanding the general markets and their major directional trend
may even be more important to your wealth-building success than
choosing the right stock. Recent years — and a century of stock market 
history — bear (no pun intended) witness to this point.
Bull and bear markets have a tremendous effect on your stock choices.
Generally, bull markets tend to precede economic uptrends (also called 
economic rebound, economic recovery, or economic growth), while bear
markets tend to precede economic downtrends (also called recession,
depression, or economic contraction).
The stock market’s movement is based on the fact that stock prices go up 
(or down) based on people’s buying or selling behavior. If more people are
buying stock (versus selling), then stock prices rise. If more people are sell-
ing stocks, then stock prices fall. Why do people buy or sell a stock? It can be
explained in one word: expectations. People generally buy (or sell) stock in
expectation of economic events. If they feel that times are getting bad and the
economic stats back them up (in the form of rising unemployment, shrinking
corporate profits, cutbacks in consumer spending, and so on), then they
become more cautious, which can have a couple of results:
 They sell stock that they currently own.
 They don’t buy stock because they feel that stocks won’t do well.
Of course, when the economy is doing well, the reverse is true.

Bulling Up
In the beginning, a bull market doesn’t look like a bull market at all. It looks
like anything but. Maybe that’s why so few catch on early. Bull markets are
marked by great optimism as the economy roars forward and stocks go sky-
ward. Everyone knows what a bull market should look like, and everyone can
recognize it when it’s become a mature trend. The saying “I don’t know what
it is, but I’ll know it when I see it” is one that applies to a bull market. But if
you can foresee it coming, you may be able to make a fortune by getting in
just before the crowd sees it.
Just keep in mind that you personally want to behave like a contrarian. A con-
trarian is an investor who decides which securities to buy and sell by going
against the crowd. To paraphrase the legendary billionaire J. Paul Getty, buy
when people are selling and sell when people are buying. This is the essence
of successful investing.
This contrarian attitude reminds me of the time I bought some gold and silver
mining stocks in 2001 and made a 1000% gain when I sold them only a few
years later. That group of stocks was very unpopular when I purchased it, but
it benefited from the unfolding bull market in precious metals.
Because bull markets usually start in the depths of a bear market, do some
research regarding bear markets; read the section “Identifying the beast,”
later in this chapter.
Recognizing the beast
In this book I concentrate on the modern era, starting in the early part of the
twentieth century, but bull markets in stocks have shown themselves many
times throughout the past few hundred years — plenty of time to have estab-
lished some recognizable traits, such as the following:
 Bull markets tend to start at the depths of pessimism — the same way
that dawn starts at the edge of darkness. People have probably just
been beaten up by a bear market. The phrase “I’m into stock investing”
is about as welcome in polite conversation as “I have a contagious dis-
ease.” If investors are avoiding stocks like the plague (or selling stocks
they already have), share prices drop to the point that much of the risk
is wrung out of them. Value-oriented investors then can pick up some
solid companies at great prices. (See Chapter 10 for information on rec-
ognizing a good stock value.)
198
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

 The major media mirror this pessimism and amplify it. Usually, the
mainstream media have greater value as a counterindicator because by
the time the major publications find out about the economic trend and
report it, the major trend has already played itself out and is probably
ready to change course.
For example, Time magazine featured Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos as its
Man of the Year in 2000, but immediately thereafter, Amazon.com’s stock
price continued a long and painful descent, ultimately dropping over 90
percent from its high in late 1999. Another example is the famous issue
of Business Week with the pessimistic cover story titled “The Death of
Equities” that came out at the tail end of the bear market of the 1970s.
What timing — an issue warning investors about the dangers of stock
investing just before the greatest bull market in history started.
 Economic statistics stabilize. After the economy has hit rock bottom,
the economic statistics start to improve. The most-watched set of eco-
nomic indicators is called the Index of Leading Economic Indicators
(which I describe in Chapters 6 and 14). Investors want to make sure
that the economy is getting back on its feet before it starts its next move
upward. In 1982, the economy was just starting to recover from the 1981
recession. The economic expansion (and accompanying bull market)
became the longest in history.
 Economic conditions for individuals and companies are stable and
strong. You know that’s true if profits are stable or growing for compa-
nies in general and if consumers are seeing strong and increasing
income growth. The logic holds up well: More money being made means
more money to eventually spend and invest.
 Industries producing large-ticket items hit rock bottom and begin
their climb. After consumers and companies have been pummeled by 
a tough economy, they’re not apt to make major financial commitments
to items such as new cars, houses, equipment, and so on. Industries 
that produce these large, expensive items will see sales fall to a low and
slowly start to rebound as the economy picks up. In a growing economy,
consumers and companies experience greater confidence (both psycho-
logically and financially).
 Demographics appear favorable. Take a look at the census and govern-
ment statistics on trends for population growth, as well as the growth in
the number of business enterprises. The 1980s and 1990s, for example,
saw the rise of the baby boomers, those born during the post-World War
II period of 1946 to 1964. Baby boomers wielded much financial clout,
much of it in the stock market. Their investment money played a major
role in propelling the stock market to new highs.
199
Chapter 15: Taking the Bull (Or Bear) by the Horns

 General peace and stability prevail. A major war or international con-
flict may have just ended. Beyond death and destruction, war is also bad
for the economy and presents uncertainty and anxiety for stock
investors.
Avoiding the horns of a bull market
Believe it or not, a mature bull market poses problems for investors and
stock market experts. In a mature bull market, just about any stock — good,
bad, or indifferent — tends to go up. You could be a blind monkey throwing
darts and pick a rising stock. When everything goes up and everybody seems
to be making a winning pick, human nature kicks in. Both beginning and seri-
ous investors believe that their good fortune can be chalked up to superior
stock-picking prowess and not simple luck or circumstance. Overconfidence
is rampant at the top of the market and it becomes a prelude for disaster.
When investors become convinced that they have the newfound ability to
consistently choose winning stocks, they grow more daring in their invest-
ment approach; they make riskier choices, using less discipline and relying
on less diligence and research. Then . . . whammo! They get socked by the
market. Overconfidence lures the unsuspecting investor to more dangerous
territory, invariably resulting in a very expensive lesson. Overconfidence 
and money don’t mix.
Let me tell you about a common phenomenon of human behavior that I 
refer to as the Wile E. Coyote effect. Do you remember Wile E. Coyote from
those great Road Runner cartoons? Of course you do! You know the plot: 
Mr. Coyote is chasing the Road Runner and seems to be gaining on him. He’s
confidently ready to pounce on the seemingly unsuspecting bird, but the
Road Runner makes a quick turn and watches as Mr. Coyote continues run-
ning over the cliff, ultimately plummeting down the ravine.
A mature bull market (also known as the “mania” stage) does that to investors.
Scores of true stories tell of investors lured to a game of easy riches (the 
dot-com fiasco, for example) only to watch their investments get pulverized.
This phenomenon happened not only to beginners but also to experienced
investors and many stock investing experts who were familiar faces on your
television screen. Crowd psychology, whether driven by fear or greed, is 
fascinating. It’s like watching a hang-gliding tournament in a hurricane.
Toro! Approaching a bull market
Being fully invested in stocks at the beginning of a bull market makes for
spectacular success. But doing so takes some courage. Then again, who says
you have to get the whole enchilada? You can begin looking and get your first
stock now and slowly build your portfolio as the bull market emerges.
200
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

Choose the type of stocks as well as the mix to fit into your unique situation
and needs. So, when the bull market is in its infancy, start investing by using
the following approach:
 Be a bargain hunter. Frequently, at the tail end of a bear market, stock
prices have been sufficiently battered after going through an extended
period of low demand and/or disproportionately more selling of the
shares by nervous investors. Let the shopping begin! At the bottom of the
bear market, you have a good chance of acquiring stock at share prices
that are near (or in some cases below) the book value of the companies
they represent. You’ll also have less risk when you acquire the shares of a
company that is generating positive growth in sales and earnings. Chapter
10 can help you better understand concepts such as book value.
 Look for strong fundamentals. Is the company you’re choosing exhibit-
ing solid sales and earnings? Are sales and earnings rising compared to
the prior year? How about from the same quarter last year? Conduct top
line and bottom line analyses (which I discuss in Chapter 10 ). Do the
company’s products and services make sense to you? In other words, is
it selling stuff that the public is starting to demand more of?
 Consider the stock’s class. Remember that some stocks are more
aggressive choices than others. This choice reflects your risk tolerance
as well. Figure out whether you want to invest in a small-cap stock with
phenomenal growth prospects (and commensurate risk) or a large-cap
stock that’s a tried-and-true market leader.
All things being equal, small-cap stocks exhibit the best growth perfor-
mance in an emerging bull market. Small-cap stocks are more appropri-
ate for investors who have a higher risk tolerance. Of course, most
stocks do well in an emerging bull market (actually, that’s what makes it
a bull market!), so even risk-adverse investors who put their money into
larger companies will gain. (For more information on growth stocks such
as small-caps, see Chapter 8.)
 Choose appropriate industries. Look at industries that are poised to
rebound as the economy picks up and individuals and organizations
begin to spend again. In a rising market, cyclical stocks such as those in
the automobile, housing, industrial equipment, and technology indus-
tries resume growth. When the economy is doing well, individuals and
organizations begin to spend more on items that will meet their needs in
an expanding economy. Companies upgrade their technology. Families
get a new car or move to a bigger house. Construction firms need more
and better equipment as residential and commercial building increases.
 Take stock of your portfolio. As you start to add stocks to your portfo-
lio, first analyze your situation to make sure that you have diversification
not only in different stocks and/or stock mutual funds but also in non-
stock investments, such as savings bonds and bank accounts. You don’t
have to have 100 percent of your investment in stocks just because the
market is bullish. Instead, you should consider putting as much as 100
percent of the growth component of your investment money in stocks.
201
Chapter 15: Taking the Bull (Or Bear) by the Horns

Say that you’re investing for the long term. You’re not that concerned
with risk, and you want maximum growth from your investments. After
setting aside money in an emergency fund, you decide that you want to
devote your remaining funds of $50,000 to growth stocks. In this case,
100 percent of that sum becomes the growth component of your invest-
ment portfolio. If you decide to play it safer and split it 50/50 between
bonds and stocks, then $25,000 (or 50 percent of your portfolio) is your
growth component. The bonds are then your income component.
 Evaluate your personal goals. No matter how good the market and the
foreseeable prospects for growth are, stock investing is a personal
matter that should serve your unique needs. For example, how old are
you, and how many years away is your retirement? All things being
equal, a 35-year-old should have predominately growth stocks, while a
65-year-old requires a more proven, stable performance with large-cap
market leaders. The information in Chapter 2 can help you identify
appropriate investment goals.
Some investors in a bull market may have very little money in stocks.
Why? Maybe they have already reached their financial goals, so wealth
preservation is more appropriate than growth. Perhaps they have a mil-
lion-dollar portfolio and are 70 years old and no longer working. In that
case, having, say, 80 percent of their investments in stable, income-
producing investments and 20 percent in proven (yet modestly) growing
stocks may make more sense for them.
Bearing Down
Alas, stocks go down as well as up. Some ferocious bear markets have hit
stocks on several occasions since the Great Depression. The bear markets of
1973–1975 and 2000–2002 rank as the toughest in modern times. A few brief,
relatively minor ones occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s. You don’t
need to worry about the occasional dips (referred to as corrections); however,
be wary about secular (long-term) bear markets, which can last years.
Discipline and a watchful eye can keep you and your money out of trouble.
Identifying the beast
Bear markets can be foreseen and they have been most often seen starting
during apparently bullish, jubilant times. Bear markets come immediately on
the heels of market tops (when stock buying reaches “mania” levels).
Anecdotal evidence about market tops makes shrewd investors become cau-
tious. It’s alleged that John D. Rockefeller (or was it Joe Kennedy?) got totally
out of the stock market just before the 1929 crash when his shoeshine boy
202
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

gave him a hot stock tip. Whether that story is true isn’t the issue. It’s believ-
able because you know similar moments have indeed happened in recent
times. In 2000, ads featured hunky baseball players and sexy tennis stars who
were giving stock market advice. In 2005, centerfold models and taxi drivers
told the public about getting rich in real estate! Long-time professional
observers have come to realize that once everybody and their uncle (and
their aunt and their parrot) starts telling you about easy riches in a market,
it’s time to get out!
Emerging bear markets have some telltale signs, including the following:
 Optimism abounds. Everyone from Main Street to Wall Street feels great.
Financial reports declare that the business cycle has been conquered
and a new economy or new paradigm has arrived. Good times are here
for the foreseeable future! You start to see books with titles such as The
Dow at 100,000 and Easy Riches in the Stock Market hit the bestseller
lists. The business cycle refers to the economy’s roller-coaster-like
behavior when it expands (growth) and contracts (recession).
Sometimes, the financial experts believe that an economy is doing so 
well that it can continue to grow indefinitely. Examples of misguided 
exuberance abound in stock market history. In 1929, Irving Fisher, the
best-known financial expert and stock millionaire of his day, made the ill-
fated declaration “Stocks have reached a permanent plateau” as he pre-
dicted the bull market would continue for the foreseeable future. A few
weeks later, the infamous stock market crash occurred. Everyone who
had listened to Fisher got clobbered in the greatest bear market of the
twentieth century. Even Irving Fisher himself filed for bankruptcy. Gee,
not even Irving Fisher should’ve listened to Irving Fisher. In stark con-
trast, Ludwig von Mises warned about the oncoming depression through-
out the late 1920s and was ignored. Who needs a party-pooper, right? In
1999, I heard one economist on TV boldly state that the economy would
continue growing forever and that “recessions are a thing of the past.”
Yikes! Today, I’m sure that economist is probably in a new job saying,
“Would you like some fries with that?”
 Debt levels hit new highs. When optimism is high, people buy things. In
1999, debt levels hit a record high in almost every category; corporate,
consumer, mortgage, and margin debt ballooned during the late 1990s.
The financial press mostly ignored this massive debt, yet it was one of
the major reasons for the subsequent bear market and recession. When
people or companies accrue too much debt, it can be removed in only
one of two ways: through repayment or by bankruptcy. The year 2005
became the eighth year in a row that more than 1 million people filed for
bankruptcy in the United States. The pace of 1+ million bankruptcies per
year has continued into 2005.
 Excessive speculation, credit, and money supply expand. Whenever a
country’s money supply grows beyond the economy’s needs, massive
problems can result. When the money supply expands, more money is
203
Chapter 15: Taking the Bull (Or Bear) by the Horns

circulated into the banking system. (Go to www.federalreserve.gov
to find out more about the money supply.) The banks then lend or invest
this excess money. The oversupply of money flows into investment pro-
jects, such as initial public offerings and bond offerings. When too much
money is available for too few worthy projects, invariably a lot of money
is invested unwisely. This situation causes massive imbalances in the
economic system, ultimately resulting in economic downturns that can
take years to rectify.
History proves the truth of this economic situation. It happened to the
U.S. economy in the late 1920s and to Japan in the late 1980s. Fortunately,
statistics on credit and the money supply are easy to come by and read-
ily available on the Internet. (See Appendix A for resources.)
 Government intervention increases. Government has the power to do
much good, but when it uses its power improperly, it can do a great deal
of harm. Every economy throughout history that collapsed ultimately did
so because of excessive government intervention. In progressive, free-
market economies, this intervention usually occurs in the form of taxes,
laws, and regulations. Keep a watchful eye on the president and Congress
to monitor government intervention. Are they proposing policies that
add burdens to the private economy? Are they advocating stringent new
laws and regulations? I explain more about government’s influence on the
stock market and the general economy in Chapters 13 and 14.
 National and/or international conflict arises. Nothing can have a more
negative impact on the economy than war or political or civil unrest. 
(I guess war is a good example of “excessive government intervention.”)
Keep your eye on the news. Ask yourself what effect a particular conflict
may have on the economy and the stock market. Sometimes the conflict
isn’t a violent one; sometimes it takes the form of a trade war when com-
peting countries aggressively implement tariffs and boycotts that could
devastate companies or even industries in one or both of the countries.

History in the making
One of the worst bear markets since the Great
Depression started in 1973. The stock market
was pummeled as the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (DJIA) fell 45 percent during an 18-
month period ending in 1975. However, the DJIA
did not recover to its 1973 high until (you guessed
it) 1982. The period from 1973 to 1982 had the hall-
marks of tough times — high inflation, high
unemployment, war (the Middle East conflict in
1973 and expansive Soviet aggression in Africa
and Afghanistan), the energy crisis, and high
taxes. The 1970s were a tough decade for most
stocks. The 1980s and ’90s were great decades
for stock investors. Alas, 2000–2002 were very
rough years for stocks as investors cumulatively
lost over $5 trillion.

Heading into the woods: Approaching 
a bear market
Sticking to a buy-and-hold strategy (where you buy stock and hold onto it for
better or worse) at the onset of a bear market is financial suicide. People
have a tough time selling, and financial advisors have an even tougher time
telling them to cut their losses because that’s tantamount to saying, “Sorry, I
was wrong.” Admitting failure is hard for most people to do.
Understand that investing should be a logical, practical, and unemotional
pursuit. You can’t be married to stocks — until death do you part — 
especially because bear markets can divorce you from your money.
In an emerging bear market, keep the following points in mind to maximize
your gains (or just to minimize your losses):
 Review your situation. Before you consider any move in or out of the
market, review your overall financial situation to make sure that your
money and financial condition are as secure as possible. Make sure that
you have an emergency fund of three to six months’ worth of gross living
expenses. Keep your debt at a comfortably low level. Review your
career, insurance, and so on. Schedule a financial checkup with your
financial planner.
 Remember that cash is king. When the bear market is coming and eco-
nomic storm clouds are rolling in, keep the bulk of your money in safe,
interest-bearing vehicles such as bank investments, U.S. treasury securi-
ties, and/or money market funds. Doing so keeps your money safe. When

Looking for Titanic tickets
In early 2000, I was infuriated when the dapper
pundits on TV told viewers to hang tight and hold
on for the long haul. Stocks then took a beating,
prompting the pundits to say, “It’s a buying oppor-
tunity. Add to your portfolio.” Then what hap-
pened? The bear market took stocks down again.
Losing trillions during 2000–2002 could’ve been
avoidable if investors had been more disciplined
and if the pundits had been more careful in their
pronouncements. When the economy is head-
ing into treacherous waters, stocks get the
worst of it, yet experts continue to advise
people to buy stocks because they’re good for
the long term. Hold on! Liking stocks doesn’t
mean that you should always be in them. I
mean, just because you like boating doesn’t
mean that you should take advantage of a free
ticket on the Titanic.

stocks are falling by 10 to 20 percent or more, you’re better off earning a
low-percentage interest in a secure, stable investment. In addition, you
can do some research while your money is earning interest. Start shop-
ping for undervalued stocks with strong fundamentals.
 Stick to necessities. In an economic downturn, defensive stocks gener-
ally outperform the market. Defensive stocks are stocks of companies
that sell goods and services that people need no matter how good or
bad the economy is doing. Good examples are food and beverage,
energy, utilities, and certain healthcare stocks.
 Use trailing stops. Trailing stops is just the active use of stop loss 
orders on a given stock. (If a stock is at $40, you have the stop loss at
$36, if the stock moves to $46, then change the stop loss from $36 to 
$41, and so on. Chapter 17 provides a fuller explanation). In the case of a
bear market, you set your stop losses closer to the stock’s market price
(“tighten the trail”). Say, for example, that you once bought a stock for
$50 per share and it’s now at $110. Presume that you usually kept a trail-
ing stop at 10 percent below the current market price. If the bear market
is becoming more evident to you, then change that 10 percent to 5 per-
cent. Before, that trailing stop on the $110 stock was $99 ($110 less 10
percent, or $11), but now it’s at $104.50 ($110 less 5 percent, or $5.50).
The trailing stop strategy is one of my favorite ways to protect my
stock’s gains.
Straddling Bear and Bull: 
Uncertain Markets
Uncertain markets are . . . well . . . uncertain. Markets aren’t always up or
down. The end of a bear market doesn’t automatically mean the beginning 
of a bull market and vice versa. Sometimes markets move sideways or very
little either way until investors and participants in the economy figure out
what’s what.
Pinpointing uncertainty is tough
Clashing points of view in the media tell you that even the experts aren’t 
sure which way the market and the economy will go in the coming months. 
In uncertain markets, compelling evidence and loads of opinions will evenly
line up on both the pro and con sides of the economic debate. Bullish and
bearish advisors and commentators may both seem persuasive, so you may
be left scratching your head, wondering what to do. In this case, your
patience and diligence will pay off.
206
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

Deciding whether you want to 
approach an uncertain market
The approach to take in uncertain markets is almost simplistic. If you think
that a bull market is starting, you want to have 100 percent of your growth
portfolio invested in stocks, and if a bear market is starting, you want the
percentage to be 0. Therefore, in an uncertain market, 50 percent in stocks
and 50 percent in other investments is just right. Of course, these three sce-
narios need to be balanced by many nonstock factors, such as your individ-
ual financial situation, age, debt level, career concerns, and so on. However,
all things being equal, those allocations aren’t far off the mark.
Treat uncertain markets as bear markets until your research starts to give
you a clear idea of the market’s direction. No matter how adventurous you
are, the first rule of stock investing is to minimize or avoid losses. If no one
can agree on the direction of the market, then you stand a 50 percent chance
of being wrong should you take the bullish stance. However, if you take a
bearish stance and the market becomes decidedly bullish, no real harm is
done except that you may miss a stock investing opportunity during a brief
period of time. Just keep in mind that stock investing is indeed a long-term
pursuit. Jumping into a bullish market is easy, but recovering from losses
may not be.

Just Right for You

S
tocks are a means to an end. What end are you seeking? You should look
at stocks as tools for wealth building. Sometimes they’re great tools, 
and sometimes they’re awful. It depends on your approach. Some stocks are
appropriate for a conservative approach, while others are more suitable for
an aggressive approach. Sometimes stocks aren’t a good idea at all. Golly! 
A stock investing book that suggests that stocks aren’t always the answer!
That’s like a teenager saying, “Dad, I respectfully decline your generous offer
of money for my weekend trip, and I’d be glad to mow the lawn.”
Laying Out Your Plans
A senior citizen in one of my investment seminars in 2000 wanted to be more
aggressive with his portfolio; his broker was more than happy to cater to his
desire for growth stocks. Of course, stocks got clobbered in the volatile bear
market of 2000–2002, and yes, he did lose lots of money. However, I soon dis-
covered that even after the losses, he still had a substantial stock portfolio
valued at over $1 million. He had more than enough to ensure a comfortable
retirement. He had sought aggressive growth even though it was really unnec-
essary for his situation. If anything, the aggressive strategy could have put
his portfolio (and hence his retirement) in jeopardy.

Growth is desirable even in your twilight years because inflation can eat
away at a fixed-income portfolio. But different rates of growth exist, and the
type you choose should be commensurate with your unique situation and
financial needs. Notice that I say “needs,” not “wants.” These perspectives
are entirely different. You may want to invest in aggressive stocks regardless
of their suitability (after all, it’s your money), but your financial situation 
may dictate that you need to take another approach. Just understand the
difference.
Stocks can play a role in all sorts of investment strategies, but in this chapter,
I discuss only a few well-known approaches. Keep in mind that a stock invest-
ing strategy can change based on the major changes in your life and the
lifestyle that you lead, such as the ones I present in the following sections.
Living the bachelor life: Young 
single with no dependents
If you’re young (age 20–40) and single, with no children or other dependents,
being more aggressive with your stock selection is fine (as long as you don’t
use your rent money for investments). The reasoning is that if you do make
riskier choices and they backfire, individuals dependent on you won’t get
hurt. In addition, if you’re in this category, you can usually bounce back a lot
easier over the long term even if you have financial challenges or if a bear
market hits your stocks. Chapter 15 can tell you more about bear and bull
markets.
Consider a mix of small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap (see Chapter 1 for an
explanation of each of these stocks) growth stocks in growth industries.
Invest some of your money in five to seven stocks and the remainder in
growth-stock mutual funds. You can revise your investment allocations along
the way as the general economy changes and/or your personal situation (like
when you finally say “I do” to the love of your life) changes.
Going together like a horse and 
carriage: Married with children
Married couples with children must follow a more conservative investing
strategy, regardless of whether one spouse works or both spouses work.
Children change the picture drastically (believe me, I have them and the
baggy eyes to prove it). You need more stable growth in your portfolio (and
unbreakable furniture in your home).
210
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

Consider a mix of large-cap growth stocks and dividend-paying defensive
stocks. (See Chapter 9 for more on defensive stocks.) Invest some of your
money in five to seven stocks and the remainder in growth and income
mutual funds. Of course, you can tweak your allocations along the way
according to changes in the general economic conditions or to your personal
situation. Consider setting aside money for college in a growth-oriented
mutual fund and in other vehicles such as savings bonds (as early as possi-
ble). For more information on financing college, check out 529 and Other
College Savings Plans For Dummies (Wiley).
Getting ready for retirement: Over 
40 and either single or married
Whether you’re over 40 and single, or you’re over 40 and married (whether
one or both of you work), you should start to slowly convert your portfolio
from aggressive growth to conservative growth. Shift more of your money 
out of individual stocks and into less-volatile investments, such as balanced
funds, investment-grade bonds, and bank certificates of deposit.
Devote some time and effort (with a financial planner if necessary) to calcu-
lating what your potential financial needs will be at retirement time. This step
is critical in helping you decide what age to target for financial independence.
(What’s that? I can stop working?! Yee-Ha!)

Safety first: Examining savings bonds
For the rest of this decade (I’m writing this book
real-time 2005), fixed-interest bonds and other
debt instruments (such as corporate bonds) gen-
erally aren’t the right place to be because debt
and interest rates are problematic for investors.
A nice oasis in the valley of death known as
America’s debt load (currently $38+ trillion, which
dwarfs our national GDP of about $12 trillion!) is
U.S. Treasury issued savings bonds. Two types
are out there — EE and I bonds. Savings bonds
are bonds that are issued by the U.S. Treasury
that can be purchased for as little as $25. The
interest rates of both types change every six
months as needed to reflect changing interest
rates. If rates go up, The U.S. Treasury automati-
cally updates the interest rates on your savings
bonds every six months so you aren’t locked in to
low rates when market rates are rising. Savings
bonds are ultrasafe, convenient, and inexpensive
to buy, and they’re free from state and local taxes.
Find out more at the U.S. Treasury Web site
www.savingsbonds.gov.

Consider five to seven large-cap stocks that are predominantly dividend-
paying defensive stocks in stable and needed industries (such as utilities,
food and beverage, and so on). Put the remainder of your investment money
in balanced mutual funds and short-term investment-grade bond funds. Have
a large portion of your money in savings bonds and bank investments.
Remember that you can revise your allocations in the future as necessary.
Kicking back in the hammock: 
Already retired
If you’re retired, you’re probably in your 60s or older. Safe, reliable income
and wealth preservation form the crux of your investment strategy. Some
growth-oriented investments are okay as long as they’re conservative and
don’t jeopardize your need for income. At one time, financial planners told
their retired clients to replace growth-oriented investments with safe income-
oriented investments. However, times have changed as senior citizens live
longer than ever before.
Issues such as longevity and inflation (steadily increasing costs of living)
mean that today’s (and tomorrow’s) retirees need growth in their portfolios.
To be safe, make sure that 5–20 percent of retirement portfolios have some
growth-oriented securities such as stocks to make sure that you continue
meeting your financial needs as the years pass. You should perform an
annual review to see whether the stock allocation needs to be adjusted.
Consider a mix of large-cap stocks dominated by dividend-paying defensive
stocks in stable industries. Spread your money over three to six stocks and
the remainder in balanced mutual funds and short-term investment-grade
bond funds. Have a large portion of your money in savings bonds and bank
investments. You need to monitor and tweak your investment portfolio along
the way to account for changes in either the general economic environment
or your lifestyle needs.
Allocating Your Assets
Asset allocation is really an attempt to properly implement the concept of
diversification — the key to safety and stability. Diversification is the inclu-
sion in your portfolio of different (and frequently offsetting) investments to
shield your wealth from most types of current risk while planning for future
growth. To achieve proper diversification, you need to analyze your entire
portfolio to look for glaring weaknesses or vulnerable areas. I don’t discuss
your total investment plan here, only the stock portion.
212
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

Investors frequently believe that having different stocks in different industries
constitutes proper diversification. Well . . . not quite. Stocks in closely related
industries tend to be affected (in differing degrees) by the same economic
events, government policies, and so on. It’s best to invest in stocks across dif-
ferent sectors. As I mention in Chapter 12, a sector is essentially a group of
related industries. Water, gas, and electric services are industries, but together
they (plus a few other industries) make up the utilities sector. For more on ana-
lyzing industries in order to pick winning stocks, see Chapter 12.
So far in this chapter, I talk about some basics for investing, depending on
your lifestyle, but how do you know how much you need to invest in order to
meet your financial goals? In the following sections, I present some typical
amounts most typical investors can (and should) devote to stock investing.
Investors with less than $10,000
If you have $10,000 or less to allocate to stocks, you may want to consider a
mutual fund rather than individual stocks because that sum of money may
not be enough to properly diversify. But if you’re going to invest a sum that
small, consider allocating it equally into two to four stocks in two different
sectors that look strong for the foreseeable future. For small investors, con-
sider sectors that are defensive in nature (such as food and utilities).
Because $10,000 or less is a small sum in the world of stock investing, you
may have to purchase in odd lots. (Odd lots usually mean 99 shares or less. 
A block of 100 shares is considered a round lot. Two hundred shares would 
be considered two round lots.) Say that you’re buying four stocks and all of
them are priced at $50 per share. An investment of $10,000 doesn’t buy you
100 shares of each. You may have to consider investing $2,500 in each stock,
which means that you end up buying only 50 shares of each stock (not
including commissions). Whether you buy an odd lot or a round lot, find out
whether the company has a dividend reinvestment plan (DRP), and use the
dividend money you earn to buy more shares of stock. (I discuss DRPs more
fully in Chapter 18.)
Try to avoid the temptation of getting into initial public offerings (IPOs),
penny stocks, and other speculative issues. Participation in them may cost
little (stock prices are often under $10 per share and can be under $1), but
the risk exposure is too high for inexperienced investors. (See Chapter 8 for
more on IPOs.)
213
Chapter 16: Choosing a Strategy That’s Just Right for You

Investors with $10,000–$50,000
If you have between $10,000 and $50,000 to invest, you have more breathing
space for diversification. Consider buying four to six stocks in two or three dif-
ferent sectors. If you’re the cautious type, defensive stocks will do. For growth
investors, seek the industries in those sectors that have proven growth. This
approach gets you off to a good start, and the section “Knowing When to Sell,”
later in this chapter, can help you maintain your portfolio with changing strat-
egy (if necessary).
Does diversification mean that you shouldn’t in any circumstance have all
your stocks in one sector? It depends on you. For example, if you’ve worked
all your life in a particular field and you’re knowledgeable and comfortable
with the sector, having a greater exposure is okay, because your greater per-
sonal expertise offsets the risk. If you worked in retail for 20 years and know
the industry inside and out, you probably know more about the good, the
bad, and the ugly of the retail sector than most Wall Street analysts. Use your
insight for more profitability. You still shouldn’t invest all your money in that
single sector, however, because diversification is still vital.
Investors with $50,000 or more
If you have $50,000 or more to invest, have no more than five to ten stocks in
two or three different sectors. It’s difficult to thoroughly track more than two
or three sectors and do it successfully — best to keep it simple. For example,
Warren Buffett, considered the greatest stock market investor of all time,
never invested in Web site businesses because he didn’t understand them.
He invests only in businesses that he understands. If that strategy works for
billionaire investors, then, by golly, it can’t be that bad for smaller investors.
I suggest investing in no more than seven stocks, because there is such a
thing as overdiversification. The more stocks you have, the tougher it is to
keep track of them. Owning more stocks means that you need to do more
research, read more annual reports and news articles, and follow the busi-
ness news of more companies. Even in the best of times, you need to regu-
larly monitor your stocks because successful investing requires diligent
effort.
Consider whether to hire a personal money manager (a person that manages
investment portfolios for a fee). If you have $50,000 or $100,000 or more,
doing so may make sense. Get a referral from a financial planner and carefully
weigh the benefits against the costs. Here are some points to consider:
214
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

 Make sure that the money manager has a philosophy and an approach
that you agree with.
Ask the money manager to give you a copy of her written investment
philosophy. How does she feel about small-cap stocks versus large-caps?
Income versus growth?
 Find out whether you’re comfortable with how the money manager
selects stocks.
Is she a value investor or a growth investor? Is she aggressive or conser-
vative? Does she analyze a stock because of its fundamentals (sales,
earnings, book value, and so on), or does she use stock price charts?
 Ask the money manager to explain her strategy.
A good way to evaluate the success (or failure) of the strategy is to ask
the money manager for her past recommendations. Did she pick more
winners than losers?
Knowing When to Sell
The act of buying stock is relatively easy. However, the act of selling stock
can be an agonizing decision for investors. But it’s agonizing only in two
instances: when you have made money with your stock and when you have
lost it. That about covers it. It sounds like a bad joke, but it’s not that far from
the truth.
The idea of selling stock when it has appreciated (the stock price has
increased in value) comes with the following concerns:
 Tax implications: This concern is a good reason to consider selling. See
Chapter 20 for information about how selling stocks under given circum-
stances can affect your taxes.
 Emotional baggage: “That stock was in our family for years.” Believe it
or not, investors cite this personal reason (or one of a dozen other per-
sonal reasons) for agonizing over the sale of an appreciated stock.
The following is a list of issues that investors want to be aware of when
they’re selling a stock that has lost money:
 Tax benefits: This issue is a good reason to consider selling a stock. 
See Chapter 20 for more on timing your stock sales to minimize your 
tax burden.
215
Chapter 16: Choosing a Strategy That’s Just Right for You

 Pride: “If I sell, I’ll have to admit I was wrong” (followed by silent sob-
bing). So what? The best investors in history have made bad invest-
ments (some that have been quite embarrassing, in fact). Losing a little
pride is cheaper than losing your money.
 Doubt: “If I sell my stock now, it may rebound later.” Frequently, when an
investor buys a stock at $50 and it goes to $40, the investor believes that
if he sells, the stock will make an immediate rebound and go to $60, and
then he’ll be kicking himself. That may happen, but usually the stock
price goes lower.
 Separation anxiety: “But I’ve had this stock so long that it’s become a
part of me.” People hang on to a losing stock for all sorts of illogical rea-
sons. Being married to a person is great; being married to a stock is ludi-
crous. If a stock isn’t helping your goals, then it’s hurting your goals.
People have plenty more reasons to agonize over the sale of a bad stock. But
you can learn to handle the stock sale in a disciplined manner.
You have only two reasons to consider selling a stock regardless of whether
the stock price has gone up or down:
 You need the money. Obviously, if you need the money for a bona 
fide reason — such as paying off debt, wiping out a tax bill, or buying a
home — then you need the money. This reason is easy to see. After all,
regardless of investment or tax considerations, stocks are there to serve
you. I hope that you do some financial planning so that you don’t need
to sell your stocks for these types of expenses, but you can’t avoid 
unexpected expenditures.
 The stock ceased to perform as you desired. If the stock isn’t serving
your wealth-building goals or fulfilling your investment objectives, it’s
time to get rid of it and move on to the next stock. Just as soon as you
get a stiff upper lip and resolve to unload this losing stock, a little voice
saying, “If I sell my stock now, it may rebound later,” starts to haunt you.
So you hang on to the stock, but then — bam! — before you know it, you
lose more money.
Selling a stock shouldn’t require a psychologist. This place is where disci-
pline steps in. This belief is why I’m a big proponent of trailing stops. (See
Chapter 17 for more on stop orders.) Trailing stops take the agony out of sell-
ing the stock. All else being equal, you shouldn’t sell a winning stock. If it’s
doing well, why sell it? Keep it as long as possible. But if it stops being a win-
ning stock, sell it. If you don’t know how or when to sell it, then apply a stop-
loss order at 5 or 10 percent below the market value and let the market
action take its course.

nvestment success isn’t just about picking rising stocks; it’s also about
how you go about doing it. Frequently, investors think that good stock
picking means doing your homework and then making that buy (or sell).
However, you can take it a step further to maximize profits (or minimize
losses). As a stock investor, you can take advantage of techniques and ser-
vices available through your standard brokerage account. (See Chapter 7 for
more on brokerage accounts.) This chapter presents some of the best ways
you can use these powerful techniques — useful whether you’re buying or
selling stock. In fact, if you retain nothing more from this chapter than the
concept of trailing stops (see the section “Trailing stops”), you’ll have gotten
your money’s worth. (Really!)
Just before the stock market bubble popped, I warned my students and read-
ers that a bear market was on the way. All the data warned me about it, and
undoubtedly, it seemed like a time for caution. (See Chapter 15 for informa-
tion about bull and bear markets.) Investors didn’t have to necessarily
believe me, but they could have (at the very least) used trailing stops and
other techniques to ensure greater investing success. Investors that used
stop loss orders avoided the carnage of trillions of dollars in stock losses. In
this chapter, I show you how to use these techniques to maximize your
investing profit.

Checking Out Brokerage Orders
Orders you place with your stockbroker neatly fit into two categories:
 Time-related orders
 Condition-related orders
Get familiar with both orders, because they’re easy to implement and invalu-
able tools for wealth building and (more importantly) wealth saving!
Using a combination of orders helps you fine-tune your strategy so that you
can maintain greater control over your investments. Speak with your broker
about the different types of orders you can use to maximize the gains (or
minimize the losses) from your stock investing activities. You also can read
the broker’s policies on stock orders at the brokerage Web site.
Time-related orders
Time-related orders mean just that; the order has a time limit. Typically,
investors use these orders in conjunction with conditional orders. The two
most common time-related orders are day orders and good-till-canceled (or
GTC) orders.
Day order
A day order is an order to buy a stock that expires at the end of that particu-
lar trading day. If you tell your broker, “Buy BYOB, Inc., at $37.50 and make it
a day order,” you mean that you want to purchase the stock at $37.50. But if
the stock doesn’t hit that price, your order expires at the end of the trading
day unfilled. Why would you place such an order? Maybe BYOB is trading at
$39, but you don’t want to buy it at that price because you don’t believe the
stock is worth it. Consequently, you have no problem not getting the stock
that day.
When would you use day orders? It depends on your preferences and per-
sonal circumstances. I rarely use day orders because few events cause me to
say, “Gee, I’ll just try to buy or sell between now and the end of today’s trading
action.” However, you may feel that you don’t want a specified order to linger
beyond today’s market action. Perhaps you want to test a price. (“I want to get
rid of stock A at $39 to make a quick profit, but it’s currently trading at $37.50.
However, I may change my mind tomorrow.”) A day order is the perfect strat-
egy to use in this case.
218
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

If you make any trade and don’t specify time with the order, most (if not all)
brokers automatically treat it as a day order.
Good-till-canceled (GTC)
A good-till-canceled (GTC) order is the most commonly requested order by
investors. Although GTC orders are time-related, they’re always tied to a 
condition, such as when the stock achieves a certain price. The GTC order
means just what it says: The order stays in effect until it’s transacted or until
the investor cancels it. Although the order implies that it can run indefinitely,
most brokers have a limit of 30 or 60 days (or more). By that time, either the
broker cancels the order or contacts you to see whether you want to extend
it. Ask your broker about his particular policy.
A GTC order is usually coupled with conditional or condition-related orders.
For example, say that you want to buy ASAP Corp. stock but you don’t want
to buy it at the current price of $48 per share. You’ve done your homework
on the stock, including looking at the stock’s price-to-earnings ratio, price-to-
book ratio, and so on (see Appendix B for more on ratios), and you say, “Hey,
this stock isn’t worth $48 a share. I’d only buy it at $36 per share.” You think
the stock would make a good addition to your portfolio but not at the current
market price. (It’s overpriced or overvalued according to your analysis.) How
should you proceed? Your best bet is to ask your broker to do a “GTC order
at $36.” This request means that your broker will buy the shares if and when
they hit the $36 mark (or until you cancel the order). Just make sure that
your account has the funds available to complete the transaction.
GTC orders are very useful, so you should become familiar with your broker’s
policy on them. While you’re at it, ask whether any fees apply. Many brokers
don’t charge for GTC orders because, if they happen to result in a buy (or
sell) order, they generate a normal commission just as any stock transaction
does. Other brokers may charge a small fee.
To be successful with GTC orders, you need to know
 When you want to buy: In recent years, people have had a tendency to
rush into buying a stock without giving some thought to what they could
do to get more for their money. Some investors don’t realize that the
stock market can be a place for bargain-hunting consumers. If you’re
ready to buy a quality pair of socks for $16 in a department store but the
sales clerk says that those same socks are going on sale tomorrow for
only $8, what would you do — assuming that you’re a cost-conscious
consumer? Unless you’re barefoot, you’re probably better off waiting.
The same point holds true with stocks.
219
Chapter 17: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques

Say that you want to buy SOX, Inc., at $26 but it’s currently trading at
$30. You think that $30 is too expensive, but you’re happy to buy the
stock at $26 or lower. However, you have no idea whether the stock will
move to your desired price today, tomorrow, next week, or even next
month (maybe never). In this case, a GTC order is appropriate.
 When you want to sell: What if you bought some socks at a department
store, and you discovered that they have holes (darn it!)? Wouldn’t you
want to get rid of them? Of course you would. If a stock’s price starts to
unravel, you want to be able to get rid of it as well.
Perhaps you already own SOX (at $25, for instance) but are concerned
that market conditions may drive the price lower. You’re not certain
which way the stock will move in the coming days and weeks. In this
case, a GTC order to sell the stock at a specified price is a suitable strat-
egy. Because the stock price is $25, you may want to place a GTC order
to sell it if it falls to $22.50, to prevent further losses. Again, in this exam-
ple, GTC is the time frame, and it accompanies a condition (sell when
the stock hits $22.50).
Condition-related orders
A condition-related order means that the order is executed only when a 
certain condition is met. Conditional orders enhance your ability to buy
stocks at a lower price, to sell at a better price, or to minimize potential
losses. When stock markets become bearish or uncertain, conditional orders
are highly recommended. A good example of a conditional order is a limit
order. A limit order may say, “Buy Mojeski Corp. at $45.” But if Mojeski Corp.
isn’t at $45 (this price is the condition), then the order isn’t executed.
Market orders
When you buy stock, the simplest type of order is a market order — an order
to buy or sell a stock at the market’s current best available price. It doesn’t
get any more basic than that.
Here’s an example: Kowalski, Inc., is available at the market price of $10.
When you call up your broker and instruct him to buy 100 shares “at the
market,” the broker will implement the order for your account, and you pay
$1,000 plus commission.
I say “current best available price” because the stock’s price is constantly
moving, and catching the best price can be a function of the broker’s ability
to process the stock purchase. For very active stocks, the price change can
happen within seconds. It’s not unheard of to have three brokers simulta-
neously place orders for the same stocks and get three different prices
because of differences in the broker’s capability. (Some computers are faster
than others.)
220
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

The advantage of a market order is that the transaction is processed immedi-
ately, and you get your stock without worrying about whether it hits a partic-
ular price. For example, if you buy Kowalski, Inc., with a market order, you
know that by the end of that phone call (or Web site visit), you’re assured of
getting the stock. The disadvantage of a market order is that you can’t con-
trol the price that you pay for the stock. Whether you’re buying or selling
your shares, you may not realize the exact price you expect (especially if
you’re buying a volatile stock).
Market orders get finalized in the chronological order in which they’re
placed. Your price may change because the orders ahead of you in line
caused the stock price to rise or fall based on the latest news.
Stop orders (also known as stop-loss orders)
A stop order (or stop-loss order if you own the stock) is a condition-related
order that instructs the broker to sell a particular stock only when the stock
reaches a particular price. It acts like a trigger, and the stop order converts to
a market order to sell the stock immediately.
The stop-loss order isn’t designed to take advantage of small, short-term
moves in the stock’s price. It’s meant to help you protect the bulk of your
money when the market turns against your stock investment in a sudden
manner.
Say that your Kowalski, Inc., stock rises to $20 per share and you seek to pro-
tect your investment against a possible future market decline. A stop-loss
order at $18 triggers your broker to sell the stock immediately if it falls to the
$18 mark. In this example, if the stock suddenly drops to $17, it still triggers
the stop-loss order, but the finalized sale price is $17. In a volatile market, you
may not be able to sell at your precise stop-loss price. However, because the
order automatically gets converted into a market order, the sale will be done,
and you prevent further declines in the stock.
The main benefit of a stop-loss order is that it prevents a major decline in a
stock that you own. It’s a form of discipline that’s important in investing in
order to minimize potential losses. Investors can find it agonizing to sell a
stock that has fallen. If they don’t sell, however, the stock often continues to
plummet as investors continue to hold on while hoping for a rebound in the
price.
Most investors set a stop-loss amount at about 10 percent below the market
value of a stock. This percentage gives the stock some room to fluctuate,
which most stocks tend to do on a day-to-day basis.

Trailing stops
Trailing stops are an important technique in wealth preservation for sea-
soned stock investors and can be one of your key strategies in using stop-
loss orders. A trailing stop is a stop-loss order that the investor actively
manages by moving it up along with the stock’s market price. The stop-loss
order “trails” the stock price upward. As the stop-loss goes upward, it pro-
tects more and more of the stock’s value from declining.
A real-life example may be the best way to help you understand trailing
stops. Say that in 1999 you bought Lucent Technologies (LU) at $25 per
share. As soon as you finished buying it, you immediately told your broker to
put a stop-loss order at $22 and make it a good-till-canceled (GTC) order.
Think of what you did. In effect, you placed an ongoing (GTC) safety net
under your stock. The stock can go as high as the sky, but if it should fall, the
stock’s price triggers a market order at $22. Your stock is automatically sold,
minimizing your loss.
If Lucent goes to $50 per share in a few months, you can call your broker and
cancel the former stop-loss order at $22 and replace it with a new (higher)
stop-loss order. You simply say, “Please put a new stop-loss order at $45 and
222

Practice discipline
I have a stack of several years’ worth of invest-
ment newsletters in which investment experts
made all sorts of calls regarding the prospects of
a company, industry, or the economy in general.
Some made forecasts that were spectacularly
on target, but you should see the ones that were
spectacularly wrong — ouch! However, even
some of the winners suffered because of a lack
of discipline. Those spectacular gains disap-
peared like football fans at a chess match.
One of the biggest recommendations by
newsletter experts in 2000 was Cisco Systems
(CSCO). In March 2000, it was at $85 and its
market value (stock price times total shares out-
standing) was a whopping $600 billion. Some
stock gurus even said that it would become the
first trillion-dollar stock. Other gurus said that
CSCO’s earnings would grow 30–40 percent per
year, indefinitely. Right about now you know that
some of these gurus are in a new profession
asking their clients, “Would you like those
loafers in black or brown?”
From March 2000 to October 2003, CSCO painfully
descended from $85 to just under $9 per share —
a spectacular 90 percent collapse. By June 2005,
it had recovered to about $19 per share. It didn’t
recover its old glory. Had investors placed a
stop-loss order at about 10 percent below its
then high ($85 less 10 percent or about $77), they
would have kept their wealth basically intact and
would subsequently have had enough cash to
buy four or five times more stock when it hit
bottom.
Investing can be an emotional roller coaster.
Keep your sanity and your profits by being dis-
ciplined. Use your stop-loss orders and fasten
those seat belts.

make it a GTC order.” This higher stop-loss price protects not only your origi-
nal investment of $20 but also a big chunk of your profit as well. As time goes
by, and the stock price climbs, you can continue to raise the stop-loss price
and add a GTC provision. Now you know why it’s called a trailing stop: It trails
the stock price upward like a giant tail. All along the way, it protects more and
more of your growing investment without limiting its upward movement.
William O’Neill, publisher and founder of Investor’s Business Daily, advocates
setting a trailing stop of 8 percent below your purchase price. That’s his pref-
erence. Some investors who invest in very volatile stocks may put in trailing
stops of 20 or 25 percent. Is a stop-loss order desirable or advisable in every
situation? No. It depends on your level of experience, your investment goals,
and the market environment. Still, stop-loss orders are appropriate in most
cases, especially if the market seems uncertain (or you do!).
A trailing stop is a stop-loss order that you actively manage. The stop-loss
order is good-till-canceled (GTC), and it constantly trails the stock’s price 
as it moves up. To successfully implement trailing stops, keep the following
points in mind:
 Remember that brokers usually don’t place trailing stops for you 
automatically. In fact, they won’t (or shouldn’t) place any type of order
without your consent. Deciding on the type of order to place is your
responsibility. You can raise, lower, or cancel a trailing stop order at 
will, but you need to monitor your investment when substantial moves
do occur to respond to the movement appropriately.
 Change the stop-loss order when the stock price moves significantly.
Hopefully, you won’t call your broker every time the stock moves 50
cents. Change the stop-loss order when the stock price moves around 10
percent. When you initially purchase the stock (say at $90 per share),
request the broker to place the stop-loss order at $81. When the stock
moves to $100, cancel the $81 stop-loss order and replace it at $90.
When the stock’s price moves to $110, change the stop-loss order to 
$99, and so on.
 Understand your broker’s policy on GTC orders. If your broker usually
has a GTC order expire after 30 or 60 days, you should be aware of it.
You don’t want to risk a sudden drop in your stock’s price without the
stop-loss order protection. If your broker’s time limit is 60 days, note it
so that you can renew the order for additional time.
 Monitor your stock. A trailing stop isn’t a “set it and forget it” technique.
Monitoring your investment is critical. Of course, if investment falls, the
stop-loss order you have prevents further loss. Should the stock price
rise substantially, remember to adjust your trailing stop accordingly.
Keep raising the safety net as the stock continues to rise. Part of moni-
toring the stock is knowing the beta, which you can read more about in
the next section.
223
Chapter 17: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques

Using beta measurement
To be a successful investor, you need to understand the volatility of the par-
ticular stock you invest in. In stock market parlance, this volatility is also
called the beta of a stock. Beta is a quantitative measure of the volatility of a
given stock (mutual funds and portfolios, too) relative to the overall market,
usually the S&P 500 index. (For more information on the S&P 500, see Chapter
5.) Beta specifically measures the performance movement of the stock as 
the S&P moves 1 percent up or down. A beta measurement above 1 is more
volatile than the overall market, while a beta below 1 is less volatile. Some
stocks are relatively stable in the price movements; others jump around.
Because beta measures how volatile or unstable the stock’s price is, it tends
to be uttered in the same breath as “risk” — more volatility indicates more
risk. Similarly, less volatility tends to mean less risk.
Table 17-1 shows some sample betas of well-known companies (as of July
2005).

You can find a company’s beta at Web sites that usually provide a lot of 
financial information about the company, such as Nasdaq’s Web site (www.
nasdaq.com) or Yahoo!Finance (finance.yahoo.com).
The beta is useful to know because it gives you a general idea of the stock’s
trading range. If a stock is currently priced at $50 and it typically trades in
the $48–$52 range, then a trailing stop at $49 doesn’t make sense. Your stock
would probably be sold the same day you initiated the stop-loss order. If your
stock is a volatile growth stock that could swing up and down by 10 percent,
you should more logically set your stop-loss at 15 percent below that day’s
price.
224
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

The stock of a large-cap company in a mature industry tends to have a low
beta — one close to the overall market. Small and mid-cap stocks in new or
emerging industries tend to have greater volatility in their day-to-day price
fluctuations; hence, they tend to have a high beta. (You can find out more
about large, small, and mid-cap stocks in Chapter 1.)
Limit orders
A limit order is a very precise condition-related order, implying that a limit
exists either on the buy or the sell side of the transaction. You want to buy
(or sell) only at a specified price or better. Period. Limit orders work better
for you if you’re buying the stock, but they may not be good for you if you’re
selling the stock. Here’s how it works in both instances:
 When you’re buying: Just because you like a particular company and
you want its stock doesn’t mean that you’re willing to pay the current
market price. Maybe you want to buy Kowalski, Inc., but the current
market price of $20 per share isn’t acceptable to you. You prefer to buy
it at $16 because you think that price reflects its true market value. What
do you do? You tell your broker, “Buy Kowalski with a limit order at $16.”
You have to specify whether it’s a day order (good for the day) or a GTC
order, which I discuss in its own section earlier in this chapter.
What happens if the stock experiences great volatility? What if it drops
to $16.01 and then suddenly drops to $15.95 on the next move? Actually,
nothing, you may be dismayed to hear. Because your order was limited
to $16, it can be transacted only at $16, no more or less. The only way
for this particular trade to occur is if the stock rises back to $16.
However, if the price keeps dropping, then your limit order isn’t trans-
acted and may expire or be canceled.
When you’re buying a stock, many brokers interpret the limit order as
“buy at this specific price or better.” Presumably, if your limit order is 
to buy the stock at $10, you’ll be just as happy if your broker buys that
stock for you at $9.95. This way, if you don’t get exactly $10, because the
stock’s price was volatile, you’ll still get the stock at a lower price. Speak
to your particular broker to be clear on the meaning of the limit order.
 When you’re selling: Limit orders are activated only when a stock hits 
a specific price. If you buy Kowalski, Inc., at $20 and you worry about a
decline in the share price, you may decide to put in a limit order at $18.
If you watch the news and hear that Kowalski’s price is dropping, you
may sigh and say, “I sure am glad that I put in that limit order at $18!”
However, in a volatile market, the share price may leapfrog over your
specified price. It could go from $18.01 to $17.99 and then continue its
descent. Because the stock price never hit $18 on the mark, it isn’t sold.
You may be sitting at home satisfied (mistakenly) that you played it
smart, while your stock plummets to $15 or $10 or worse! Having a stop-
loss order in place is best.

Chapter 17: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques

Buying on Margin
Margin means buying securities, such as stocks, by using funds you borrow
from your broker. Buying stock on margin is similar to buying a house with a
mortgage. If you buy a house at a purchase price of $100,000 and put 10 per-
cent down, your equity (the part you own) is $10,000, and you borrow the
remaining $90,000 with a mortgage. If the value of the house rises to $120,000
and you sell (for the sake of simplicity, I don’t include closing costs in this
example), you make a profit of 200 percent. How is that? The $20,000 gain on
the property represents a gain of 20 percent on the purchase price of
$100,000, but because your real investment is $10,000 (the down payment),
your gain works out to 200 percent (a gain of $20,000 on your initial invest-
ment of $10,000).
Buying on margin is an example of using leverage to maximize your gain
when prices rise. Leverage is simply using borrowed money when you make
an asset purchase in order to increase your potential profit. This type of
leverage is great in a favorable (bull) market, but it works against you in an
unfavorable (bear) market. Say that a $100,000 house you purchase with a
$90,000 mortgage falls in value to $80,000 (and property values can decrease
during economic hard times). Your outstanding debt of $90,000 exceeds the
value of the property. Because you owe more than you own, you’re left with a
negative net worth. Leverage is a double-edged sword.
Examining marginal outcomes
Suppose that you think that the stock for the company Mergatroid, Inc., cur-
rently at $40 per share, will go up in value. You want to buy 100 shares, but
you have only $2,000. What can you do? If you’re intent on buying 100 shares
(versus simply buying the 50 shares that you have cash for), you can borrow
the additional $2,000 from your broker on margin. If you do that, what are the
potential outcomes?
If the stock price goes up
This outcome is the best for you. If Mergatroid goes to $50 per share, your
investment is worth $5,000, and your outstanding margin loan is $2,000. If 
you sell, the total proceeds will pay off the loan and leave you with $3,000.
Because your initial investment was $2,000, your profit is a solid 50 percent
because ultimately your $2,000 principal amount generated a $1,000 profit.
(For the sake of this example, I leave out any charges, such as commissions
and interest paid on the margin loan.) However, if you pay the entire $4,000
upfront without the margin loan, then your $4,000 investment generates a
profit of $1,000, or 25 percent. Using margin, you double the return on your
money.
226
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

Leverage, when used properly, is very profitable. However, it’s still debt, 
so understand that you must pay it off eventually, regardless of the stock’s
performance.
If the stock price fails to rise
If the stock goes nowhere, you still have to pay interest on that margin loan.
If the stock pays dividends, this money can defray some of the cost of the
margin loan. In other words, dividends can help you pay off what you borrow
from the broker.
Having the stock neither rise nor fall may seem like a neutral situation, but
you pay interest on your margin loan with each passing day. For this reason,
margin trading can be a good consideration for conservative investors if the
stock pays a high dividend. Many times, a high dividend from $5,000 worth of
stock can exceed the margin interest you have to pay from the $2,500 (50 per-
cent) you borrow from the broker to buy that stock.
If the stock price goes down, buying on margin can work against you. What 
if Mergatroid goes to $38 per share? The market value of 100 shares is then
$3,800, but your equity shrinks to only $1,800 because you have to pay your
$2,000 margin loan. You’re not exactly looking at a disaster at this point, but
you’d better be careful, because the margin loan exceeds 50 percent of your
stock investment. If it goes any lower, you may get the dreaded margin call,
when the broker actually contacts you to ask you to restore the ratio
between the margin loan and the value of the securities. See the following
section for information about appropriate debt to equity ratios.
Maintaining your balance
When you purchase stock on margin, you must maintain a balanced ratio of
margin debt to equity of at least 50 percent. If the debt portion exceeds this
limit, then you’re required to restore that ratio by depositing either more
stock or more cash into your brokerage account. The additional stock you
deposit can be stock that’s transferred from another account.
If, for example, Mergatroid goes to $28 per share, the margin loan portion
exceeds 50 percent of the equity value in that stock — in this case, because
the market value of your stock is $2,800 but the margin loan is still at $2,000,
the margin loan is a worrisome 71 percent of the market value ($2,000 divided
by $2,800 = 71 percent). Expect to get a call from your broker to put more
securities or cash into the account to restore the 50 percent balance.
If you can’t come up with more stock, other securities, or cash, then the next
step is to sell stock from the account and use the proceeds to pay off the
margin loan. For you, it means realizing a capital loss — you lost money on
your investment.
227
Chapter 17: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques

The Federal Reserve Board governs margin requirements for brokers with
Regulation T. Discuss this rule with your broker to understand fully your 
(and the broker’s) risks and obligations. Regulation T dictates margin 
requirements set by brokers to their customers. For most listed stocks, 
it’s 50 percent.
Margin, as you can see, can escalate your profits on the up side but magnify
your losses on the down side. If your stock plummets drastically, you can end
up with a margin loan that exceeds the market value of the stock you used
the loan to purchase. In the emerging bear market of 2000–2002, stock losses
hurt many people, and a large number of these losses were made worse
because people didn’t manage the responsibilities involved with margin 
trading.
If you buy stock on margin, use a disciplined approach. Be extra careful when
using leverage, such as a margin loan, because it can backfire. Keep the fol-
lowing points in mind:
 Have ample reserves of cash or marginable securities in your account.
Try to keep the margin ratio at 40 percent or less to minimize the chance
of a margin call.
 If you’re a beginner, consider using margin to buy stock in large com-
panies that have a relatively stable price and pay a good dividend.
Some people buy income stocks that have dividend yields that exceed
the margin interest rate, meaning that the stock ends up paying for its
own margin loan. Just remember those stop orders.
 Constantly monitor your stocks. If the market turns against you, the
result will be especially painful if you use margin.
 Have a payback plan for your margin debt. Margin loans against your
investments mean that you’re paying interest. Your ultimate goal is to
make money, and paying interest eats into your profits.
Going Short and Coming Out Ahead
The vast majority of stock investors are familiar with buying stock, holding
on to it for a while, and hoping its value goes up. This kind of thinking is
called going long, and investors who go long are considered to be long on
stocks. Going long essentially means that you’re bullish and seeking your
profits from rising prices. However, astute investors also profit in the market
when stock prices fall. Going short (also called shorting a stock, selling short,
or doing a short sale) on a stock is a common technique for profiting from a
stock price decline. Investors have made big profits during bear markets by
going short. A short sale is a bet that a particular stock is going down.
228
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

To go short, you have to be deemed (by your broker) creditworthy — your
account needs to be approved for short selling. When you’re approved for
margin trading, you’re probably set to sell short, too. Speak to your broker
(or check for this information on the broker’s Web site) about limitations in
your account regarding going short.
Because going short on stocks has greater risks than going long, I strongly
advise beginning investors to avoid shorting stocks until they become more
seasoned.
Most people easily understand making money by going long. It boils down to
“buy low and sell high.” Piece of cake. Going short means making money by
selling high and then buying low. Huh? Thinking in reverse isn’t a piece of
cake. Although thinking of this stock adage in reverse may be challenging, the
mechanics of going short are really simple. Consider an example that uses a
fictitious company called DOA, Inc. As a stock, DOA ($50 per share) is looking
pretty sickly. It has lots of debt and plummeting sales and earnings, and the
news is out that DOA’s industry will face hard times for the foreseeable
future. This situation describes a stock that’s an ideal candidate for shorting.
The future may be bleak for DOA, but promising for savvy investors.
You must understand brokerage rules before you conduct short selling. The
broker must approve you for it (see Chapter 7 for information on working
with brokers), and you must meet the minimum collateral requirement,
which is typically $2,000 or 50 percent of the shorted stock’s market value. If
the stock generates dividends, those dividends are paid to the owner of the
stock, not to the person who is borrowing it to go short. (See the next sec-
tion, “Setting up a short sale,” to see how this technique works.) Check with
your broker for complete details and review the resources in Appendix A.
Setting up a short sale
This section explains how to go short. Say that you believe that DOA is the
right stock to short — you’re pretty sure its price is going to fall. With DOA 
at $50, you instruct your broker to “go short 100 shares on DOA.” (It doesn’t
have to be 100 shares. I’m just using that as an example.) Now, here’s what
happens next:
1. Your broker borrows 100 shares of DOA stock, either from his own
inventory or from another client or broker.
That’s right. The stock can be borrowed from a client, no permission
necessary. The broker guarantees the transaction, and the client/owner
of the stock never has to be informed about it, because he never loses
legal and beneficial right to the stock. You borrow 100 shares, and you’ll
return 100 shares when it’s time to complete the transaction.
229
Chapter 17: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques

2. Your broker then sells the stock and puts the money in your account.
Your account is credited with $5,000 (100 shares × $50) in cash — the
money gained from selling the borrowed stock. This cash acts like a loan
on which you’re going to have to pay interest.
3. You buy the stock back and return it to its rightful owner.
When it’s time to close the transaction (either you want to close it, or
the owner of the shares wants to sell them, so you have to give them
back), you must return the number of shares you borrowed (in this case,
it was 100 shares). If you buy back the 100 shares at $40 per share
(remember that you shorted this particular stock because you were sure
its price was going to fall) and these 100 shares are returned to their
owner, you make a $1,000 profit. (To keep the example tidy, I don’t
include brokerage commissions.)
Oops! Going short when prices grow taller
I bet you guessed that the wonderful profitability of selling short has a flip
side. Presume that you were wrong about DOA and that the stock price rises
from the ashes as it goes from $50 to $87. Now what? You still have to return
the 100 shares you borrowed. With the stock’s price at $87, that means that
you have to buy the stock for $8,700 (100 shares at the new, higher price of
$87). Ouch! How do you pay for it? Well, you have that original $5,000 in your
account from when you initially went short on the stock. But where do you
get the other $3,700 ($8,700 less the original $5,000)? You guessed it — your
pocket! You have to cough up the difference. If the stock continues to rise,
that’s a lot of coughing.
How much money do you lose if the stock goes to $100 or more? A heck of a
lot. As a matter of fact, there’s no limit to how much you can lose. That’s why
going short can be riskier than going long. With going long, the most you can
lose is 100 percent of your money. However, with going short, you can lose
more than 100 percent of the money you invest. Yikes!
Because the potential for loss is unlimited when you short a stock, I suggest
that you use a stop order (also called a buy-stop order) to minimize the
damage. Better yet, make it a good-till-canceled order, which I discuss earlier
in this chapter. You can set the stop order at a given price, and if the stock
hits that price, you buy the stock back so that you can return it to its owner
before the price rises even higher. You still lose money, but you limit your
losses.
230
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

Watching out for ticks
Short sellers should be aware of the uptick rule, which states that you can
enter into a short sale only when the stock has just completed an uptick.
“Tick” in this case means the actual incremental price movement of the stock
you’re shorting. For a $10 stock that was just $9.95 a moment ago, the 5-cent
difference represents an uptick. If the $10 stock was just $10.10 a moment
before, the 10-cent difference is a downtick. The amount of the tick doesn’t
matter. So, if you short a stock at the price of $40, the immediate prior price
must have been $39.99 or lower. The reason for this rule (a Federal Reserve
regulation) is that short selling can aggravate declining stock prices in a
rapidly falling market. In practice, going short on a stock whose price is
already declining can make the stock price fall even farther. Excessive short
selling can make the stock more volatile than it would be otherwise.
Feeling the squeeze
If you go short on a stock, remember that, sooner or later, you have to buy
that stock back so that you can return it to its owner. What happens when a
lot of people are short on a particular stock and its price starts to rise? All
those short sellers are scrambling to buy the stock back so that they can
close their transactions before they lose too much money. This mass buying
quickens the pace of the stock’s ascent and puts a squeeze (called a short
squeeze) on the investors who had been shorting the stock.
Earlier in the chapter, I explain that your broker can borrow stock from
another client so that you can go short on it. What happens when that client
wants to sell the stock in her account — the stock that you borrowed and so
is no longer in her account? When that happens, your broker asks you to
return the borrowed stock. That’s when you feel the squeeze — you have to
buy the stock back at the current price.
Going short can be a great maneuver in a declining (bear) market, but it can
be brutal if the stock price goes up. If you’re a beginner, stay away from short
selling until you have enough experience (and money) to risk it.

W
ho says that you must buy 100 shares of a stock to invest? Do you
really have to go through a broker to buy stock, or can you buy
direct? What if you only want to put your toe in the water and buy just one
share for starters? Can you do that without paying through the nose for
transaction costs, such as commissions? The answer to these questions is
that you can buy stocks directly (without a broker) and save money in the
process. That’s what this chapter is about. In this chapter, I show you how
direct purchase programs (DPPs) and dividend reinvestment plans (DRPs)
make a lot of sense for long-term stock investors, and how you can do them
on your own — no broker necessary. I also show you how to use the method
of dollar cost averaging (DCA) to acquire stock, a technique that works espe-
cially well with DRPs.
The types of programs are well-suited for those people who like to invest
small sums of money and plan on doing so on a consistent basis in the same
stock (or stocks) over a long period of time.
Being Direct with DPPs
If you’re going to buy a stock anyway, why not buy it directly from the com-
pany and bypass the broker (and commissions) altogether? Several hundred
companies now offer direct purchase programs (DPPs), also called DIPs (or
direct investment programs), which give investors an opportunity to buy
stock directly from these companies.

DPPs give investors the opportunity to get involved with little upfront money
(usually enough to cover the purchase of one share) and usually no commis-
sions. Why do companies give investors this opportunity? For their sake,
they want to encourage more attention and participation from investors. For
your purposes, however, a DPP gives you what you may need most: a low-
cost entry into that particular company’s DRP (which you can read more
about in the section “Dipping into DRPs,” later in this chapter).
Investing in a DPP
If you have your sights set on a particular company and have only a few
bucks to start out with, a DPP is probably the best way to make your initial
investment. The following steps can guide you toward your first stock pur-
chase using a DPP:
1. Decide what stock you want to invest in. (This whole book is about
that topic.)
Say that you did your homework and you decide to invest in Yumpin
Yimminy Corp. (YYC). Contact the company directly and request to
speak to someone in the shareholder services department. You can get
YYC’s contact information through the stock exchange YYC trades on.
For example, if YYC is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, you can
call the NYSE or visit its Web site (www.nyse.com) and ask for the con-
tact information for YYC. So, you can contact NYSE to reach YYC for its
DPP ASAP. OK?
2. Find out whether YYC has a DPP (before it’s DOA! OK?).
Call YYC’s shareholder services department and ask whether it has a
DPP. If it does, great; if it doesn’t, ask whether it plans to start one. At
the very least, it may have a DRP.
3. Look into enrolling.
The company will send you an application along with a prospectus —
the program document that serves as a brochure and, hopefully,
answers your basic questions.
The processing is typically handled by an organization that the company
designates (the plan administrator). From this point forward, you’re in
the dividend reinvestment plan. (See the section “Dipping into DRPs,”
later in this chapter.)

Finding DPP alternatives
Although several hundred companies offer DPPs, the majority of companies
don’t. What do you do if you want to invest in a company directly and it 
doesn’t have a DPP? The following sections present some alternatives.
Buy the first share through a broker to qualify for DRPs
Yes, buying your first share through a broker will cost you a commission;
however, after you make the stock purchase, you can contact that company’s
shareholder services department and ask about its DRP. (See the section
“Dipping into DRPs,” later in this chapter.) After you’re an existing stock-
holder, qualifying for the DRP is a piece of cake.
To qualify for the DRP, you must be on the books of record with the transfer
agent. A book of record is simply the database that the company uses to track
every single outstanding share of stock and the owner of the stock. The trans-
fer agent is the person responsible for maintaining the database. Whenever
stock is bought or sold, the transfer agent must implement the change and
update the records on stock ownership. In many cases, you must have the
broker issue a stock certificate in your name once you own the stock. This is
the most common way to get your name on the books of record, hence quali-
fying you for the DRP.
Sometimes, simply buying the stock isn’t enough to get your name on the
book of record, because brokers often keep the stock in your account under
a street name. Having a street name means that although you technically own
the stock, your broker may keep it registered under a different name for ease
of transaction. Having the stock in a street name really doesn’t mean much to
you until you want to qualify for the company’s DPP or DRP. Remember to
address this point with your broker.
Get started in a DRP directly through a broker
These days, more brokers are able to offer the features of the DRP (like com-
pounding interest) right in the brokerage account itself, making it more conve-
nient than having to go to the trouble of setting up a DRP with the company.
This service is most likely a response to the growing number of long-term
investors who have fled traditional brokerage accounts for the benefits of
direct investing that DPPs and DRPs offer. The main drawback of a broker-run
DRP is that usually it doesn’t allow you to make optional cash purchases (a
big negative!). See the section “Building wealth with optional cash payments
(OCPs),” later in this chapter, for more on this topic.

Purchase via alternate buying services
Organizations have set up services to help small investors buy stock in small
quantities. The primary drawback to these middlemen is that you will proba-
bly pay more in transaction costs than if you approach the companies
directly. Check out the most prominent services, which include the following:
 Money Paper at www.directinvesting.com
 National Association of Investors Corporation at www.better

Recognizing that every pro has a con
As beneficial as DPPs are, they do have some minor drawbacks. (Doesn’t
everything?) Keep the following points in mind when considering DPPs as
part of your stock portfolio:
 Although more and more companies are starting to offer DPPs, still rela-
tively few companies have them.
 Some DPPs require a high initial amount to invest (as much as $250 or
more) or a commitment of monthly investments. In any case, ask the
plan administrator about the investing requirements.
 A growing number of DPPs have some type of service charge. Usually
this charge (if your DPP has a charge) is very modest and lower than
typical brokerage commissions. Ask about all the incidents, such as get-
ting into the plan, getting out, and so on, that may trigger a service
charge.
Don’t invest in a company just because it has a DPP or DRP. DPPs and DRPs
are simply a means for getting into a particular stock with very little money.
They shouldn’t be a substitute for doing diligent research and analysis on 
a particular stock.
Dipping into DRPs
Sometimes dividend reinvestment plans (DRPs) are called “DRIPs,” which
makes me scratch my head. Reinvestment is one word not two, so where does
that I come from? But I digress. Whether you call them DRIPs or DRPs, they’re
great for small investors and for investors who are truly long-term investors 
in a particular stock. A DRP is a program that a company may offer to allow
investors to accumulate more shares of its stock without paying commissions.
236
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

A DRP has two primary advantages:
 Compounding: The dividends get reinvested and give you the opportu-
nity to buy more stock.
 Optional cash purchases: Most DRPs give participants the ability 
to invest through the plan to purchase more stock, usually with no
commissions.
To be in a dividend reinvestment plan, here are the requirements:
 You must already be a stockholder for that particular stock.
 You must already have a dividend reinvestment plan set up.
 The stock must be paying dividends. (You had to guess this one!)
Getting a clue about compounding
Dividends are reinvested, offering a form of compounding for the small
investor. Dividends buy more of the shares, in turn generating more divi-
dends. Usually the dividends generated don’t buy entire shares, so what 
they do purchase are fractional shares.
Say, for example, that you own 20 shares of Fraction Corp. at $10 per share
for a total value of $200. Fraction Corp.’s annual dividend is $1, meaning that
a quarterly dividend of 25 cents is issued every three months. What happens
if this stock is in the DRP? The 20 shares generate a $5 dividend payout in the
first quarter, and this amount is applied to the stock purchase as soon as the
amount is credited to the DRP account. If you presume for this example that
the stock price hasn’t changed, the total shares in the DRP are 20.50 shares
valued at $205 (20.50 shares × $10 share price). The dividend payout wasn’t
enough to buy an entire share, so it bought a fractional share and credited
that to the account.
Say that, in the preceding example, three months have passed and that no
other shares have been acquired since your prior dividend payout. Fraction
Corp. issues another quarterly dividend for 25 cents per share. Now what?
 The original 20 shares of Fraction Corp. generate a $5 dividend payout.
 The .50, or half share, in the account generates a 12.5 cent dividend (half
the dividend of a full share because it’s only .50 of a share).
 The total dividend payout is $5.125 (rounded to $5.13), and the new total
of shares in the account is 21.125 shares (the former 20.50 shares plus
.625 shares purchased by the dividend payout). Full shares generate full
dividends, and fractional shares generate fractional dividends.
237
Chapter 18: Getting a Handle on DPPs, DRPs, and DCA . . . PDQ

To illustrate my point, the preceding example uses a price that doesn’t fluctu-
ate. Stock in a DRP acts like any other stock; the share price changes con-
stantly. Every time the DRP makes a stock purchase, whether it’s monthly or
quarterly, the purchase price will likely change each time.
Building wealth with optional 
cash payments (OCPs)
Most DRPs give the participant the opportunity to make optional cash pay-
ments (OCPs). DRPs usually establish a minimum and a maximum payment.
The minimum is typically very modest, such as $25 or $50. A few plans even
have no minimum. This feature makes it very affordable to regularly invest
modest amounts and build up a sizeable portfolio of stock in a shorter period
of time, unencumbered by commissions.
DRPs also have a maximum investment limitation, such as specifying that
“DRP participants cannot invest any more than $10,000 per year.” For most
investors, the maximum isn’t a showstopper. However, consult with the
administrator of the plan because all plans are a little different.
OCPs are probably the most advantageous aspect of a DRP. If you can invest
$25 to $50 per month consistently, year after year, at no (or little) cost, you
may find that doing so is a superb way to build wealth.
Checking out the cost advantages
In spite of the fact that more and more DRPs are charging service fees, DRPs
are still an economical way to invest, especially for small investors. The big
savings come from not paying commissions. Although many DPPs and DRPs
do have charges, they tend to be relatively small (but keep track of them,
because the costs can add up).
Some DRPs actually offer a discount of between 2 percent and 5 percent (a
few are higher) when buying stock through the plan. Still others offer special
programs and discounts on the company’s products and services. Some com-
panies offer the service of debiting your checking account or paycheck to
invest in the DRP. One company offered its shareholders significant discounts
to its restaurant subsidiary. In any case, ask the plan administrator because
any plus is . . . well . . . a plus.
238
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

Weighing the pros with the cons
When you’re in a DRP, you reap all the benefits of stock investing (along with
the risks and responsibilities). You get an annual report, and you qualify for
stock splits, dividend increases, and so on.
Before you start to salivate over all the goodies that come with DRPs, be
clear-eyed about some of the negative aspects to them as well. Negative
aspects include the following:
 You need to get that first share. But you knew that.
 Even small fees cut into your profits.
 Many DRPs may not have some types of services, such as Individual
Retirement Accounts (IRAs). (Chapter 20 offers more information on
IRAs.)
 DRPs are designed for long-term investing. Although getting in and out of
the plan is easy, the transactions may take weeks to process because
stock purchases and sales are typically done all at once on a certain day
during the month (or quarter).
 Read the prospectus. You may not consider this a negative point, but for
some people, reading a prospectus is not unlike giving blood by using
leeches. Even if that is your opinion, you need to read the prospectus to
avoid any surprises, such as hidden fees or unreasonable terms.
 Understand the tax issues. There, ya see? I knew that I’d ruin it for you.
The point is that you should understand the tax consequences. Chapter
20 goes into greater detail. Just know that dividends, whether or not
they occur in a DRP, are usually taxable (unless the DRP is in an IRA,
which is a different matter).
 Perhaps the biggest headache of DRPs is the need to keep good records.
Keep all your statements together and use a good spreadsheet program
or accounting program if you plan on doing a lot of DRP investing. These
records will become especially important at tax time, when you have to
report any subsequent gains or losses from stock sales. Because capital
gains taxes can be complicated as you sort out short term versus long
term, DRP calculations can be a nightmare without good record keeping.
DRPs offer a great way to accumulate a large stock holding over an extended
period of time. However, think about what you can do with this stock. Say
that you accumulate 110 shares of stock, valued at $50 per share, in your
DRP. You can, for example, take out $5,000 worth of stock (100 shares at 
$50 per share) and place those 100 shares in your brokerage account. The
239
Chapter 18: Getting a Handle on DPPs, DRPs, and DCA . . . PDQ

remaining 10 shares can stay in your account to keep the DRP and continue
with dividend reinvestment to keep your wealth growing. Why remove those
shares?
All things being equal, you are better off keeping the stock in the DRP, but
what if you have $2,500 in credit card debt and don’t have extra cash to pay
off that debt? Brokerage accounts still have plenty of advantages, such as, in
this example, the use of margin (a topic I discuss in detail in Chapter 17). If
your situation merits it, you can borrow up to 50 percent of the $5,000, or
$2,500, as a margin loan and use it, for example, to pay off $2,500 worth of
credit card debt. Because you’re replacing unsecured debt (credit card debt
that may be charging 15 percent, 18 percent, or more) with secured debt, you
can save a lot of money (borrowing against stock in a brokerage account is
cheaper than credit card debt). Another benefit is that the margin loan with
your broker doesn’t require monthly payments as do the credit card balances.
Additionally, ask your tax consultant about potential tax benefits. Investment
interest expense is deductible, while consumer credit card debt is not.
The One-Two Punch: Dollar 
Cost Averaging and DRPs
Whoa! Have I veered away from DRPs into a brand-new topic? Actually, no.
Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is a splendid technique for buying stock and low-
ering your cost for doing so. The example illustrated in Table 18-1 will show
that it is not uncommon for investors to see a total cost that reflects a dis-
count to the market value. DCA works especially well with DRPs.
DCA is a simple method for acquiring stock. It rests on the idea that you
invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (monthly, usually) over a
long period of time in that particular stock. Because a fixed amount (say, $50
per month) is going into a fluctuating investment, you end up buying less of
that investment when it goes up in price and more of it when it goes down in
price. As Table 18-1 illustrates, your average cost per share is usually lower
than if you buy all the shares at once.
DCA is best presented with an example. Presume that you decide to get into
the DRP of the company Acme Elevator, Inc. (AE). On your first day in the
DRP, AE’s stock is at $25, and the plan allows you to invest a minimum of $25
through its optional cash purchase program. You decide to invest $25 per
month and assess how well (hopefully) you’re doing six months from now.
Table 18-1 shows how this technique works.

To assess the wisdom of your decision to invest in the DRP, ask yourself
some questions:
 How much did you invest over the entire six months?
Your total investment is $150. So far, so good.
 What is the first share price for AE, and what is the last share price?
The first share price is $25, but the last share price is $20.
 What is the market value of your investment at the end of six months?
You can easily calculate the value of your investment. Just multiply the
number of shares you now own (8.03 shares) by the most recent share
price ($20). The total value of your investment is $160.60.
 What is the average share price you bought at?
The average share price is also easy to calculate. Take the total amount 
of your purchases ($150) and divide it by the number of shares that you
acquired (8.03 shares). Your average cost per share price becomes $18.68.
 Is that your final answer? (Do your best Regis Philbin voice.)
Yes, these are my final answers (look Ma, no lifelines!), but you should
take note of the following:
• Even though the last share price ($20) is lower than the original
share price ($25), your total investment’s market value is still
higher than your purchase amount ($160.60 compared to $150)!
How could that be?! Dollar cost averaging is the culprit here. Your
disciplined approach (using DCA) was able to overcome the fluctu-
ations in the stock price to help you gain more shares at the lower
prices of $17.50 and $15.
241
Chapter 18: Getting a Handle on DPPs, DRPs, and DCA . . . PDQ

• Your average cost per share is only $18.68. The DCA method
helped you buy more shares at a lower cost, which ultimately
helped you make money when the stock price made a modest
rebound.
• DCA works in helping you invest with small sums, all the while
helping you smooth out the volatility in stock prices. This helps
you make more money in your wealth-building program over the
long haul. Can you visualize that retirement hammock yet?
The bottom line for long-term stock investors is that DCA is a solid
investing technique and DRPs are a great stock investment vehicle
for building wealth.
Dollar cost averaging is a fantastic technique in a bull market and
an “OK” technique in a flat or sideways market, but it is really not 
a good consideration during bear markets because the stock you
are buying is going down in price and the market value could very
easily be lower than your total investment. If you plan on holding
onto the stock long term, then simply cease your dollar cost aver-
aging approach until times improve for the stock (and its industry
and the economy). Learn more about bear markets in Chapter 15.

magine that you’re boarding a cruise ship, ready to enjoy a hard-earned
vacation. As you merrily walk up the plank, you notice that the ship’s cap-
tain and crew are charging out of the vessel, flailing their arms, and screaming
at the top of their lungs — some are even jumping into the water below. Quiz:
Would you get on that ship? You get double credit if you can also explain why
(or why not). What does this scenario have to do with stock investing? Plenty.
The behavior of the people running the boat gives you important clues about
the near-term prospects for the boat. Similarly, the actions of company insiders
can provide important clues into the near-term prospects for their company.
Company insiders are individuals who are key managers or investors in the
company. Insiders may be the president of the company, the treasurer, or
another managing officer. An insider can be someone who owns a large stake
in the company or someone on the board of directors. In any case, insiders
usually have a bird’s-eye view of what’s going on with the company. They have
a good idea of how well (or how poorly) the company is doing.
Keep tabs on what insiders are doing, because their buy/sell transactions do
have a strong correlation to the near-term movement of their company’s
stock. However, don’t buy or sell stock only because you heard that some
insider did it. Use the information on insider trading to confirm your own
good sense in buying or selling stock. Insider trading sometimes can be a

great precursor to a significant move that you can profit from if you know
what to look for. Many shrewd investors have made their profits (or avoided
losses) by tracking the activity of the insiders.
Tracking Insider Trading
Fortunately, we live in an age of disclosure. Insiders who buy or sell stock
must file reports that document their trading activity with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC), which makes the documents available to the
public. You can view these documents either at the SEC office or at the Web
site of the SEC, which maintains the EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis, and Retrieval) database (www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml). Just click
on the “Search for company filings” button. Some of the most useful documents
you can view there include the following:
 Form 3: This form is the initial statement that insiders provide. Insiders
must file Form 3 within ten days of obtaining insider status. An insider
files this report even if he hasn’t made a purchase yet; the report estab-
lishes the insider’s status.
 Form 4: Form 4 is the document that shows the insider’s activity. For
example, Form 4 would include a change in the insider’s position as
stockholder — how many shares the person bought and sold or other
relevant changes. Any activity in a particular month must be reported
on Form 4 by the 10th of the following month. If, for example, an insider
sells stock during January, the SEC must get the report by February 10.
 Form 5: This annual report covers transactions that are small and not
required on Form 4. Transactions may include minor, internal transfers
of stock, or other transactions.
 Form 144: This form serves as the public declaration by an insider of the
intention to sell restricted stock. This is stock that the insider received
from the company as compensation, was awarded, or bought as a term
of employment. Insiders must hold restricted stock for at least one year
before they can sell it. After an insider decides to sell, he files Form 144
and then must sell within 90 days or else must submit a new Form 144.
The insider must file the form on or before the stock’s sale date. When
the sale is finalized, the insider is then required to file Form 4.
Companies are required to make public the documents that track their trad-
ing activity. The SEC’s Web site offers limited access to these documents, but
for greater access, check out one of the many companies that report insider
trading data, such as www.marketwatch.com and www.bloomberg.com.
244
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

The SEC has enacted the short-swing profit rule to protect the investing
public. This rule prevents insiders from quickly buying the stock that they
just sold at a profit. The insider must wait at least six months before buying it
again. The SEC created this rule to prevent insiders from using their privileged
knowledge to make an unfair profit, while the investing public can’t react fast
enough. The rule is also true if an insider sells stock. An insider can’t sell it at
a higher price within a six-month period.
Looking at Insider Transactions
The classic phrase “Actions speak louder than words” was probably coined
for insider trading. Insiders are in the know, and keeping a watchful eye on
their transactions — both buying and selling their company’s stock — can
provide you with very useful investing information. Analyzing insider buying
versus insider selling can be as different as day and night. Insider buying is
simple, while insider selling can be complicated. In the following sections, I
present both sides of insider trading.
Learning from insider buying
Insider buying is usually an unambiguous signal about how an insider feels
about his company. After all, the primary reason that all investors buy stock
is that they expect it to do well. If one insider is buying stock, that’s generally
not a monumental event. But if several or more insiders are buying, those
purchases should certainly catch your attention.
245
Chapter 19: Looking at What the Insiders Do: Corporate Hijinks
Sarbanes-Oxley Act
Very often, a market that reaches a mania stage
sees abuse reach extreme conditions as well.
Abuse by insiders is a good example. In the stock
market mania of 1997–2000, this abuse wasn’t
just limited to insider buying and selling of stock;
it also covered the related abuse of accounting
fraud. Because insiders are primarily the top
management, they deceived investors about the
financial conditions of the company and subse-
quently were able to increase the perceived
value of the company’s stock. The stock could
then be sold at a price that was higher than
market value. Congress took notice of these
activities and, in 2002, passed the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act (SOX). Congress designed this act to
protect investors from fraudulent accounting
activities by corporations. SOX established a
public accounting oversight board and also tight-
ened the rules on corporate financial reporting.

Insider buying is generally a positive omen and beneficial for the stock’s price.
Also, when insiders buy stock, less stock is available to the public. If the invest-
ing public meets this decreased supply with increased demand, then the 
stock price rises. Keep these factors in mind when analyzing insider buying:
 Identify who’s buying the stock. The CEO is buying 5,000 shares. Is that
reason enough for you to jump in? Maybe. After all, the CEO certainly
knows how well the company is doing. But what if that CEO is just start-
ing her new position? What if before this purchase she had no stock in
the company at all? Maybe the stock is part of her employment package.
The fact that a new company executive is making her first stock purchase
isn’t as strong a signal urging you to buy as the fact that a long-time CEO
is doubling her holdings. Also, if large numbers of insiders are buying,
that sends a stronger signal than if a single insider is buying.
 See how much is being bought. In the example in the previous section,
the CEO bought 5,000 shares, which is a lot of stock no matter how you
count it. But is it enough for you to base an investment decision on?
Maybe, but a closer look may reveal more. If she already owned 1 million
shares at the time of the purchase, then buying 5,000 additional shares
wouldn’t be such an exciting indicator of a pending stock rise. In this
case, 5,000 shares is a small incremental move and doesn’t offer much
to get excited about.
However, what if this particular insider has owned only 5,000 shares for
the past three years and is now buying 1 million shares? Now that should
arouse your interest! Usually, a massive purchase tells you that particular
insider has strong feelings about the company’s prospects and that she’s
making a huge increase in her share of stock ownership. Still, a purchase
of 1 million shares by the CEO isn’t as strong a signal as ten insiders buying
100,000 shares each. Again, if only one person is buying, that may or may
not be a strong indication of an impending rise. However, if lots of people
are buying, consider it a fantastic indication.
An insider purchase of any kind is a positive sign. But it’s always more
significant when a greater number of insiders are making purchases.
“The more the merrier!” is a good rule for judging insider buying. All these
individuals have their own, unique perspectives on the company and its
prospects for the foreseeable future. Mass buying indicates mass optimism
for the company’s future. If the treasurer, the president, the vice-president
of sales, and several other key players are putting their wealth on the
line and investing it in a company that they know intimately, that’s a
good sign for your stock investment as well.
 Notice the timing of the purchase. The timing of insider stock purchases
is important as well. If I tell you that five insiders bought stock at various
points last year, you may say, “Hmm.” But if I tell you that all five people
bought substantial chunks of stock at the same time and right before
earnings season, that should make you say, “HMMMMM!”
246
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

Picking up tips from insider selling
Insider buying either bodes well for the stock or is a neutral event at worst.
Insider stock buying is rarely a negative event. But how about insider selling?
When an insider sells his stock, the event can either be neutral or negative.
Insider selling is usually a little tougher to figure out because insiders may have
many different motivations to sell stock that have nothing to do with the com-
pany’s future prospects. (See the next paragraph for a list of some common
reasons.) Just because the president of the company is selling 5,000 shares from
his personal portfolio, that doesn’t necessarily mean you should sell, too.
Insiders may sell their stock for a couple reasons: They may think that the
company won’t be doing well in the near future — a negative sign for you —
or they may simply need the money for a variety of personal reasons that
have nothing to do with the company’s potential. Some typical reasons why
insiders may sell stock include the following:
 To diversify their holdings. If an insider’s portfolio is heavily weighted
with one company’s stock, a financial advisor may suggest that he balance
his portfolio by selling some of that company’s stock and purchasing
other securities.
 To finance personal emergencies. Sometimes an insider needs money
for medical, legal, or family reasons.
 To buy a home or make another major purchase. An insider may need
the money to make a down payment or perhaps to buy something out-
right without having to take out a loan.
How do you find out about the details regarding insider stock selling?
Although insiders must report their pertinent stock sales and purchases to
the SEC, the information isn’t always revealing. As a general rule, consider
the following questions when analyzing insider selling:
 How many insiders are selling? If only one insider is selling, that single
transaction doesn’t give you enough information to act on. However,
if many insiders are selling, you should see a red flag. Check out any
news or information that is currently available. Web sites such as www.
marketwatch.com, www.sec.gov, and finance.yahoo.com can help
you get that information (along with other sources in Appendix A).
 Are the sales showing a pattern or unusual activity? If one insider sold
some stock last month, that sale alone isn’t that significant an event.
However, if ten insiders have each made multiple sales in the past few
months, those sales are cause for concern. See whether any new devel-
opments at the company are potentially negative. If massive insider 
selling has recently occurred and you don’t know why, consider putting
a stop-loss order on your stock immediately. I cover stop-loss orders
more fully in Chapter 17.

Chapter 19: Looking at What the Insiders Do: Corporate Hijinks

 How much stock is being sold? If a CEO sells 5,000 shares of stock but
still retains 100,000 shares, that’s not a big deal. But if the CEO sells all
or most of his holdings, that’s a possible negative. Check to see whether
other company executives have also sold stock.
 Do outside events or analyst reports seem coincidental with the sale of
the stock? Sometimes, an influential analyst may issue a report warning
about a company’s prospects. If the company’s management pooh-poohs
the report but most of them are bailing out anyway (selling their stock),
you may want to do the same. Frequently, when insiders know that dam-
aging information is forthcoming, they sell the stock before it takes a dip.
Similarly, if the company’s management issues positive public statements
or reports that are contradictory to their own behavior (they’re selling
their stock holdings), the SEC may investigate to see whether the com-
pany is doing anything that may require a penalty. The SEC regularly
tracks insider sales.
Considering Corporate Stock Buybacks
When you read the financial pages or watch the financial shows on television,
you sometimes hear that a company is buying its own stock. The announce-
ment may be something like, “SuperBucks Corp. has announced that it will
spend $2 billion dollars to buy back its own stock.” Why would a company do
that, and what does that mean to you if you own the stock or are considering
buying it?
W hen companies buy back their own stock, they’re generally indicating that
they believe their stock is undervalued and that it has the potential to rise. If
a company shows strong fundamentals (for example, good financial condition
and increasing sales and earnings) and it’s buying more of its own stock, it’s
worth investigating — it may make a great addition to your portfolio.
Just because a company announces a stock buyback doesn’t always mean
that one will happen. The announcement itself is meant to stir interest in
the stock and cause the price to rise. The stock buyback may be only an
opportunity for insiders to sell stock, or it may be needed for executive 
compensation — recruiting and retaining competent management is a 
positive use of money.
If you see that a company is buying back its stock while most of the insiders
are selling their personal shares, that’s not a good sign. It may not necessarily
be a bad sign, but it’s not a positive sign. Play it safe and invest elsewhere.
248
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

The following sections present some common reasons a company may buy
back its shares from investors as well as some ideas on the negative effects
of stock buybacks.
Boosting earnings per share
By simply buying back its own shares from stockholders, a company can
increase its earnings per share (see Chapter 10 and Appendix B for more
on earnings per share) without actually earning extra money. Sound like a
magician’s trick? Well, it is, kind of. A corporate stock buyback is a financial
sleight of hand that investors should be aware of. Here’s how it works:
Noware Earnings, Inc., (NEI) has 10 million shares outstanding, and it’s
expected to net earnings of $10 million for the fourth quarter. NEI’s earnings
per share (EPS) would be $1 per share. So far so good. But what happens
if NEI buys 2 million of its own shares? Total shares outstanding shrink to
8 million. The new EPS becomes $1.25 — the stock buyback artificially boosts
the earnings per share by 25 percent!
The important point to remember about stock buybacks is that actual com-
pany earnings don’t change — no fundamental changes occur in company
management or operations — so the increase in EPS can be misleading.
But the marketplace can be obsessive about earnings, and because earnings
are the lifeblood of any company, an earnings boost, even if it’s cosmetic, can
also boost the stock price.
If you watch a company’s price-to-earnings ratio (see Chapter 10), you
know that increased earnings usually mean an eventual increase in the stock
price. Additionally, a stock buyback affects supply and demand. With less
available stock in the market, demand necessarily sends the stock price
upward.
Whenever a company makes a major purchase, such as buying back its
own stock, think about how the company is paying for it and whether it
seems like a good use of the company’s purchasing power. In general, 
companies buy their stock for the same reasons any investor buys stock —
they believe that the stock is a good investment and will appreciate in time.
Companies generally pay for a stock buyback in one of two basic ways:
funds from operations or borrowed money. Both methods have a downside.
For more details, see the section “Exploring the downside of buybacks,”
later in this chapter.
249
Chapter 19: Looking at What the Insiders Do: Corporate Hijinks

Beating back a takeover bid
Suppose that you read in the financial pages that Company X is doing a hos-
tile takeover of Company Z. A hostile takeover doesn’t mean that Company X
sent storm troopers armed with mace to Company Z’s headquarters to trounce
its management. All a hostile takeover means is that X wants to buy enough
shares of Z’s stock to effectively control Z (and Z is unhappy about being
owned or controlled by X). Because buying and selling stock are done in a
public market or exchange, companies can buy each other’s stock. Sometimes
the target company prefers not to be acquired, in which case it may buy back
shares of its own stock to give it a measure of protection against unwanted
moves by interested companies.
In some cases, the company attempting the takeover already owns some
of the target company’s stock. In this case, the targeted company may offer
to buy those shares back from the aggressor at a premium to thwart the
takeover bid. This type of offer is often referred to as greenmail.
Takeover concerns generally prompt interest in the investing public, driving
the stock price upward and benefiting current stockholders.
Exploring the downside of buybacks
As beneficial as stock buybacks can be, they have to be paid for, and this
expense has consequences. If a company pays for the stock with funds from
operations, it may have a negative effect on the company’s ability to finance
current and prospective operations. When a company uses funds from opera-
tions for the stock buyback, less money is available for other activities, such
as upgrading technology or research and development. In general, any misuse
of money, such as using debt to buy back stock, affects a company’s ability to
grow its sales and earnings — two measures that need to maintain upward
mobility in order to keep stock prices rising.
A company faces even greater dangers when it uses debt to finance a stock
buyback. If the company uses borrowed funds, it has less borrowing power
for other uses (such as upgrading technology or making other improvements).
In addition, the company has to pay back the borrowed funds with interest,
thus lowering earnings figures.
Say that NEI (a fictional company introduced in the “Boosting earnings per
share” section, earlier in this chapter) typically pays an annual dividend of
25 cents per share of stock and wants to buy back shares with borrowed
money with a 9 percent interest rate. If NEI buys back 2 million shares, it
250
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

won’t have to pay out $500,000 in dividends. That’s money saved. However,
NEI is going to have to pay interest on the $20 million it borrowed to buy back
the shares over that same time frame to the tune of $1,800,000 (9 percent of
$20,000,000). The net result from this rudimentary example is that NEI sees
an outflow of $1,300,000 (the difference between the interest paid out and
the dividends savings). Using debt to finance a stock buyback needs to make
economic sense — it needs to strengthen the company’s financial position.
Perhaps NEI could have used the stock buyback money toward a better pur-
pose, such as modernizing equipment or paying for a new marketing campaign.
Because debt interest ultimately decreases earnings, companies must be care-
ful when using debt to buy back their stock.
Stock Splits: Nothing to 
Go Bananas Over
Frequently, management teams decide to do a stock split. A stock split is the
exchange of existing shares of stock for new shares from the same company.
Stock splits don’t increase or decrease the capitalization of the company.
They just change the number of shares available in the market and the per-
share price.
In a typical stock split, a company may announce that it will do a 2-for-1 stock
split. For example, a company may have 10 million shares outstanding, with a
market price of $40 each. In a 2-for-1 split, the company then has 20 million
shares (the share total doubles), but the market price is adjusted to $20
(the share price is halved). Companies do other splits, such as a 3-for-2 or 
4-for-1, but 2-for-1 is the most common split.
Why do companies split their stock? Usually, management believes that the
stock’s price is too high, thus possibly discouraging investors from purchasing
it. The stock split is a strategy to stir interest in the stock, and this increased
interest frequently results in a rise in the stock’s price.
Qualifying for a stock split is similar to qualifying to receive a dividend — you
must be listed as a stockholder as of the date of record. (For information on
the date of record, see Chapter 6.)
A stock split is technically a neutral event because the ultimate market value
of the company’s stock doesn’t change as a result of the split. The following
sections present the two most basic types of splits: ordinary and reverse
stock splits.
251
Chapter 19: Looking at What the Insiders Do: Corporate Hijinks

Ordinary stock splits
Ordinary stock splits — when the number of stock shares increase — are the
ones we usually hear about. (For example, a 2-for-1 stock split doubles the
number of shares.) If you own 100 shares of Dublin, Inc., stock (at $60 per
share), and the company announces a stock split, what happens? If you own
the stock in certificate form, you receive in the mail a stock certificate for
100 shares of Dublin, Inc. Now, before you cheer over how your money just
doubled, check the stock’s new price. Each share is adjusted to a $30 value.
Not all stock is in certificate form. Stocks held in a brokerage account are
recorded in book entry form. Most stock, in fact, is in book entry form.
A company only issues stock certificates when necessary or when the
investor requests it. If you keep the stock in your brokerage account, check
with your broker for the new share total to make sure that you’re credited
with the new number of shares after the stock split.
A stock split is primarily a neutral event, so why does a company bother to
do it? The most common reason is that management believes that the stock
is too expensive, so it wants to lower the stock price to make the stock more
affordable and therefore more attractive to new investors. Studies have
shown that stock splits frequently precede a rise in the stock price. Although
stock splits are considered a non-event in and of themselves, many stock
experts see them as bullish signals because of the interest they generate
among the investing public.
Reverse stock splits
A reverse stock split usually occurs when a company’s management wants to
raise the price of its stock. Just as ordinary splits can occur when manage-
ment believes that the price is too expensive, a reverse stock split means that
the company feels that the stock’s price is too cheap. If a stock’s price looks
too low, that may discourage interest by individual or institutional investors
(such as mutual funds). Management wants to drum up more interest in the
stock for the benefit of shareholders (some of whom are probably insiders).
The company may also do a reverse split to decrease costs. When you have
to send an annual report and other correspondence regularly to all the stock-
holders, the mailings can get a little pricey, especially when you have lots of
investors who have only a few shares each. A reverse split helps to consoli-
date the shares to lower overall management costs.
252
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

A reverse split can best be explained with an example. TuCheep, Inc., (TCI) is
selling at $2 per share on the Nasdaq. At that rock-bottom price, the investing
public may ignore it. So TCI announces a 10-for-1 reverse stock split. Now what?
If an existing stockholder had 100 shares at $2 (the old shares), the stockholder
now owns 10 shares at $20.
Technically, a reverse split is considered a neutral event. However, just as
investors may infer positive expectations from an ordinary stock split, they
may have negative expectations from a reverse split, because a reverse split
tends to occur for negative reasons.
If, in the event of a stock split, you have an odd number of shares, the company
doesn’t produce a “fractional share.” Instead, you get a check for the cash
equivalent. For example, if you have 51 shares and the company announces
a 2-for-1 reverse split, the odds are that they’ll give you 25 shares and a cash
payout for the odd share (or fractional share).
Keep good records regarding your stock splits in case you need to calculate
capital gains for tax purposes. (See Chapter 20 for tax information.)

In This Chapter
 Checking out the tax implications of your investments
 Paying taxes on your investments
 Taking your tax deductions
 Investing for your retirement
A
fter conquering the world of making money with stocks, now you have
another hurdle — keeping your money. Some people may tell you that
taxes are brutal, complicated, and counterproductive. Other people may tell
you that they’re a form of legalized thievery, while still others may say that
they’re a necessary evil. And then there are pessimists. In any case, this
chapter shows you how to keep more of the fruits of your hard-earned labor.
Keep in mind that this chapter isn’t meant to be comprehensive. For a fuller
treatment of personal taxes, refer to the latest edition of Taxes For Dummies
(Wiley). However, in this chapter, I cover the most relevant points for stock
investors. As a stock investor, you need to know the tax treatment for divi-
dends and capital gains and losses, along with common tax deductions for
investors and some simple tax-reduction strategies.
You must take tax planning seriously because taxes can be the single biggest
expense during your lifetime. The average taxpayer pays more in taxes than
in food, clothing, and shelter combined!
Paying through the Nose
This section tells you what you need to know about the tax implications
you’ll face when you start investing in stocks. It’s good to know the basics in
advance since it will matter to your investing strategy. If you’re the type of
investor who likes to cash in on a profitable stock quickly, then realize that
you will probably pay more in taxes than if you are more patient. Sometimes
the difference can be just a matter of days. What if you are about to sell a
stock that you’ve held for 11 months and 28 days? Well waiting just a few
more days means less taxes which means more money in your pocket.

Understanding ordinary income 
and capital gains
Profit you make from your stock investments can be taxed in one of two
ways, depending on the type of profit:
 Ordinary income: If the profit you make from stock investments is taxed,
your profit is taxed at the same rate as wages — at your full, regular tax
rate. If your tax bracket is 28 percent, then that’s the rate your ordinary
income investment profits will be taxed at. Two types of investment
profits get taxed as ordinary income:
• Dividends: When you receive dividends from your stock (either
in cash or stock), these dividends get taxed as ordinary income.
This is also true if those dividends are in a dividend reinvestment
plan. (See Chapter 18 if you want to know more about dividend
reinvestment plans, or DRPs.) If, however, those dividends occur
in a tax-sheltered plan, such as an IRA or 401(k) plan, then they’re
exempt from taxes for as long as they’re in the plan. Retirement plans
are covered in the section “Taking Advantage of Tax-Advantaged
Retirement Investing,” later in this chapter. In January, investors
receive a 1099-DIV statement from the issuer of the dividends that
includes information on the amount of dividends earned the previ-
ous year. Check with your tax advisor because the latest tax laws
offer tax advantages for dividends.
• Short-term capital gains: If you sell stock for a gain and you’ve
owned the stock for just one year or less, the gain is considered
ordinary income. If you buy a stock on August 1 and sell it on July
31 of the following year, that’s less than one year. To calculate the
time, you use the trade date (or date of execution). This date is the
date that you executed the order instead of the settlement date.
(For more on important dates, see Chapter 6.) However, if these
gains occur in a tax-sheltered plan, such as a 401(k) or an IRA, no
tax is triggered.
 Long-term capital gains: Long-term capital gains are usually much
better for you as far as taxes are concerned. The tax laws reward patient
investors. After you have held the stock for at least a year and a day
(what a difference a day makes!), your tax rate will be reduced. Get more
information on capital gains in IRS Publication 550 “Investment Income
and Expenses”.
Because the tax on capital gains is the most relevant tax for stock
investors, don’t forget to read the section “Minimizing the tax on
your capital gains,” later in this chapter.
256
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

Managing the tax burden from your investment profits is something that you
can control. Gains are taxable only if a sale actually takes place. (In other words,
only if the gain is “realized.”) If your stock in GazillionBucks, Inc., goes from
$5 per share to $87, that $82 appreciation isn’t subject to taxation unless you
actually sell the stock. Until you sell, that gain is “unrealized.” Time your
stock sales carefully — hold on to them at least a year — to minimize the
amount of taxes you have to pay on them.
When you buy stock, record the date of purchase and the cost basis (the pur-
chase price of the stock plus any ancillary charges, such as commissions).
This information is very important come tax time should you decide to sell
your stock. The date of purchase helps to establish the holding period (how
long you’ve owned the stocks) that determines whether your gains are to be
considered short-term or long-term.
Say that you buy 100 shares of GazillionBucks, Inc., at $5 and pay a commission
of $18. Your cost basis is $518 (100 shares times $5 plus $18 commission).
If you sell the stock at $87 per share and pay a $24 commission, the total
sale amount is $8,676 (100 shares times $87 less $24 commission). If this
sale occurred less than a year after the purchase, it’s a short-term gain. 
In the 28 percent tax bracket, the short-term gain of $8,158 is also taxed
at 28 percent. (Short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income.) Read the 
following section to see the tax implications if your gain is a long-term gain.
Any gain (or loss) from a short sale is considered short-term regardless of
how long the position is held open. For more information on selling short,
check out Chapter 17.
257
Chapter 20: Tax Benefits and Obligations
Debt and taxes: Another angle
If you truly need cash, but you don’t want to sell
your stock because it’s doing well and you want
to avoid paying capital gains tax, consider bor-
rowing against it. If the stock is a listed stock
(listed on the New York Stock Exchange, for
example) and is sitting in a brokerage account,
you can borrow up to 50 percent of the value of
marginable securities at favorable rates. (Listed
stocks are marginable securities.) The money
you borrow is considered a margin loan, and the
interest you pay is low (compared to credit
cards or personal loans) because it’s consid-
ered a secured loan (your stock acts as collat-
eral). On those rare occasions when I use
margin, I usually make sure I use stocks that
generate a high dividend. That way, the stocks
help to pay off the margin loan.

Minimizing the tax on your capital gains
Long-term capital gains are taxed at a more favorable rate than ordinary
income. To qualify for long-term capital gains treatment, you must hold
the investment for over one year (in other words, for at least one year and
one day).
Recall the example in the previous section with GazillionBucks, Inc. As a
short-term transaction at the 28 percent tax rate, the tax would have been
$2,429 ($8,676 × 28 percent). After you revive, you say, “Gasp! What a chunk
of dough. I better hold off a while longer.” You hold on to the stock for at
least a year to achieve the status of long-term capital gains. How does that
change the tax? For anyone who is in the 28 percent tax bracket or higher,
the long-term capital gains rate of 20 percent would apply. In this case, the
tax would be $1,735 ($8,676 × 20 percent), resulting in a tax savings to you
of $694 ($2,429 less $1,735). Okay, it’s not a fortune, but it is a substantial 
difference from the original tax.
Because every taxpayer is different, check with your personal tax advisor.
In addition, get the publications referenced in this chapter by either visiting
the IRS Web site at www.irs.gov or call their publications department at
800-TAX-FORM.
Don’t sell a stock just because it qualifies for long-term capital gains treat-
ment, even if the sale would ease your tax burden. If the stock is doing well
and meeting your investing criteria, then hold on to it.
Capital gains taxes can be lower than the tax on ordinary income, but they’re
not higher. If, for example, you’re in the 15 percent tax bracket for ordinary
income and you have a long-term capital gain that would normally bump you
up to the 28 percent tax bracket, the gain is taxed at your lower rate of 15 per-
cent instead of a higher capital gains rate. Check with your tax advisor on a
regular basis because this can change due to new tax laws.
Coping with capital losses
Ever think that having the value of your stocks fall could be a good thing?
Perhaps the only real positive regarding losses in your portfolio is that they
can reduce your taxes. A capital loss means that you lose money on your
investments. This amount is generally deductible on your tax return, and
you can claim a loss on either long-term or short-term stock holdings.
This loss can go against your other income and lower your overall tax.
258
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

Say that you bought Worth Zilch Co. stock for a total purchase price of
$3,500 and sold it later at a sale price of $800. Your capital loss would
be$2,700. This loss is tax deductible.
The one string attached to deducting investment losses on your tax return
is that the most you can report in a single year is $3,000. On the bright side,
though, any excess loss isn’t really lost — you can carry it forward to the
next year. If you had net investment losses of $4,500 in 2006, then you can
deduct $3,000 in 2006 and carry the remaining $1,500 loss over to 2007 and
deduct it on your 2007 tax returns.
Before you can deduct losses, the IRS states that the capital losses from
your investments must first be used to offset any capital gains. If you realize
long-term capital gains of $7,000 in stock A and $6,000 of realized long-term
capital losses in stock B, then you have a net long-term capital gain of $1,000
($7,000 gain less the offset of $6,000 loss). Whenever possible, see whether
losses in your portfolio can be realized to offset any capital gains to reduce
any potential tax.
Here’s your optimum strategy: Where possible, keep losses on a short-term
basis and push your gains into long-term capital gains status. If a transaction
can’t be tax free, then at the very least try to defer the tax to keep your money
working for you.
259
Chapter 20: Tax Benefits and Obligations
Gains and losses scenarios
Of course, any investor can come up with hun-
dreds of possible scenarios. For example, you
may wonder what happens if you sell part of your
holdings now as a short-term capital loss and
the remainder later as a long-term capital gain.
You must look at each sale of stock (or potential
sale) methodically to calculate the gain or loss
you would realize from it. Figuring out your gain
or loss isn’t that complicated. Here are some gen-
eral rules to help you wade through the morass:
 If you add up all your gains and losses and the
net result is a short-term gain, it’s taxed at
your highest tax bracket (as ordinary income).
 If you add up all your gains and losses and
the net result is a long-term gain, it’s taxed
at 20 percent if you’re in the 28 percent tax
bracket or higher. If you’re in the 15 percent
tax bracket or lower, the tax rate on long-
term capital gains is 10 percent.
 If you add up all your gains and losses and
the net result is a loss, it’s deductible as fol-
lows: If your loss is $3,000 or less, it’s fully
deductible against other income. If you’re
married filing separately, then your deduc-
tion limit is $1,500.
 If you add up all your gains and losses and
the net result is a loss that exceeds $3,000,
then you can only deduct up to $3,000 in that
year, and the remainder goes forward to
future years.

Sharing Your Gains with the IRS
Of course, you don’t want to pay more taxes than you have to, but as the old
cliché goes, “Don’t let the tax tail wag the investment dog.” You should buy
or sell a stock because it makes economic sense first, and consider the tax
implications as secondary issues. After all, taxes consume a relatively small
portion of your gain. As long as you experience a net gain (gain after all trans-
action costs, including taxes, brokerage fees, and other related fees), consider
yourself a successful investor — even if you have to give away some of your
gain to taxes.
Hold on to stocks over the long term to keep transaction costs and taxes
down. Remember that you don’t pay tax on a stock profit until you sell the
stock.
Try to make tax planning second nature in your day-to-day activities. No, you
don’t have to consume yourself with a blizzard of paperwork and tax projec-
tions. I simply mean that when you make a stock transaction, keep the receipt
and maintain good records. When you make a large purchase or sale, pause for
a moment and ask yourself whether you’ll have to face any tax consequences.
(Refer to the section “Paying through the Nose,” earlier in this chapter, to review
various tax scenarios.) Speak to a tax consultant beforehand to discuss the
ramifications.
Filling out forms
Most investors report their investment-related activities on their individual
tax returns (Form 1040). The reports that you will likely receive from brokers
and other investment sources include the following:
 Brokerage and bank statements: Monthly statements that you receive
 Trade confirmations: Documents to confirm that you bought or sold
stock
 1099-DIV: Reporting dividends paid to you
 1099-INT: Reporting interest paid to you
 1099-B: Reporting gross proceeds submitted to you from the sale of
investments, such as stocks and mutual funds
260
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

You may receive other, more obscure forms that aren’t listed here, but you
should retain all documents related to your stock investments.
The IRS schedules and forms that most stock investors need to be aware of
and/or attach to their Form 1040 include the following:
 Schedule B: For reporting interest and dividends
 Schedule D: To report capital gains and losses
 Form 4952: Investment Interest Expense Deduction
 Publication 17: Guide to Form 1040
You can get these publications directly from the IRS at 800-TAX-FORM, or you
can download them from the Web site www.irs.gov.
If you plan to do your own taxes, consider using the latest tax software prod-
ucts, which have become inexpensive and are easy to use. These programs
usually have a question-and-answer feature to help you do your taxes step-
by-step, and they include all the necessary forms. Consider getting either
TurboTax (www.turbotax.com) or H&R Block’s TaxCut (www.taxcut.com)
at your local software vendor or the companies’ Web sites.
Playing by the rules
Some people get the smart idea of “Hey! Why not sell my losing stock by
December 31 to grab the short-term loss and just buy back the stock on
January 2 so that I can have my cake and eat it, too?” Not so fast. The IRS
puts the kibosh on maneuvers such as that with something called the 
“wash-sale rule.” This rule states that if you sell a stock for a loss and buy
it back within 30 days, the loss isn’t valid because you didn’t make any 
substantial investment change. The wash-sale rule applies only to losses.
The way around the rule is simple: Wait at least 31 days before you buy that
identical stock back again.
Some people try to get around the wash-sale rule by doubling up on their
stock position with the intention of selling half. Therefore, the IRS makes the
30-day rule cover both sides of the sale date. That way an investor can’t buy
the identical stock within 30 days just before the sale and then realize a
short-term loss for tax purposes.

Chapter 20: Tax Benefits and Obligations

Discovering the Softer Side of the IRS:
Tax Deductions for Investors
In the course of managing your portfolio of stocks and other investments, you
will probably incur expenses that will be tax deductible. The tax laws allow
you to write off certain investment-related expenses (as itemized expenses
on Schedule A — an attachment to IRS Form 1040). Keep records of your
deductions and retain a checklist to remind you of what deductions you nor-
mally take for future tax years. IRS Publication 550 (“Investment Income and
Expenses”) gives you more details. The following sections explain common
tax deductions for investors.
Investment interest
If you have paid any interest to a stockbroker, such as margin interest or any
interest to acquire a taxable financial investment, that’s considered invest-
ment interest and is usually fully deductible as an itemized expense. Keep in
mind that not all interest is deductible. Consumer interest or interest paid for
any consumer or personal purpose isn’t deductible.
Miscellaneous expenses
Most investment-related deductions are reported as miscellaneous expenses.
Here are some common deductions:
 Accounting or bookkeeping fees for keeping records of investment income.
 Any expense related to tax service or education.
 Computer expense. You can take a depreciation deduction for your 
computer if you use it 50 percent of the time or more for managing
your investments.
 Investment management or investment advisor’s fees. (Fees paid for
advice on tax-exempt investments aren’t deductible.)
 Legal fees involving stockholder issues.
 Safe-deposit box rental fee or home safe to hold your securities, unless
used to hold personal effects or tax-exempt securities.
262

 Service charges for collecting interest and dividends.
 Subscription fees for investment advisory services.
 Travel costs to check investments or to confer with advisors regarding
income-related investments.
You can deduct only that portion of your miscellaneous expenses that
exceeds 2 percent of your adjusted gross income.
Givin’ it away
What happens if you donate stock to your favorite (IRS-approved) charity?
Because it’s a noncash charitable contribution, you can deduct the market
value of the stock.
Say that last year you bought stock for $2,000 and it’s worth $4,000 this year.
If you donate it this year, you can write off the market value at the time of the
contribution. In this case, you have a $4,000 deduction. Use IRS Form 8283,
which is an attachment to Schedule A, to report noncash contributions
exceeding $500.
To get more guidance from the IRS on this matter, get its free Publication #526,
“Charitable Contributions,” by calling 800-TAX-FORM.
Knowing what you can’t deduct
Just to be complete, here are some items that you may have thought you
could deduct but, alas, you can’t:
 Financial planning or investment seminars
 Any costs connected with attending stockholder meetings
 Home office expenses for managing your investments
Are you having fun yet? You’re probably saying “Why read the rest of the chap-
ter? Can’t I just wait for the movie?” Yeah, I know, taxes can be intimidating.
So, write your representative in Congress and complain. After all, it’s your

Chapter 20: Tax Benefits and Obligations

Taking Advantage of Tax-Advantaged
Retirement Investing
If you’re going to invest for the long term (such as your retirement), then you
may as well maximize your usage of tax-sheltered retirement plans. Many dif-
ferent types of plans are available, but I touch on only the most popular ones.
Although retirement plans may not seem relevant for investors who buy and
sell stocks directly (as opposed to a mutual fund), some plans, called self-
directed retirement accounts, allow you to invest directly.
IRAs
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are accounts that you can open with a
financial institution, such as a bank or a mutual fund company. An IRA is avail-
able to almost anyone who has earned income, and it allows you to set aside
and invest money to help fund your future retirement. Opening an IRA is easy,
and virtually any bank or mutual fund can guide you through the process.
Two basic types of IRAs are traditional and Roth.
Traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA)
The traditional Individual Retirement Account (also called the deductible IRA)
was first popularized in the early 1980s. The basic point of the traditional IRA
is that you can put in a tax-deductible contribution of up to $4,000 per year
for tax years 2005–2007. It reaches $5,000 in 2008. In addition, individuals who
are at least age 50 can make additional “catch-up” investments of $500 in 2005.
The amount rises to an additional $1,000 in years 2006–2008.
The money can then grow in the IRA account unfettered by current taxes
because the money isn’t taxed until you take it out. Because IRAs are designed
for retirement purposes, you can start taking money out of your IRA in the
year you turn 591⁄ 2. (Hmmm. That must really disappoint those who want
their money in the year they turn 583⁄4.) The withdrawals at that point are
taxed as ordinary income. Fortunately, you’ll probably be in a lower tax
bracket then, so the tax shouldn’t be as burdensome.
If you take out money from an IRA too early, the amount is included in your
taxable income, and you may be zapped with a 10 percent penalty. You can
avoid the penalty if you have a good reason. (The IRS provides a list of rea-
sons that qualify the premature withdrawal of money as being exempt from
the penalty. Get IRS Publication 590 “Individual Retirement Arrangements” at
their Web site, www.irs.gov.)
264
Part IV: Investment Strategies and Tactics 

To put money into an IRA, you must earn income equal to or greater than
the amount you’re contributing. Earned income is money made either as an
employee or a self-employed person. Although traditional IRAs can be great
for investors, the toughest part about them is qualifying. The reason is that
there are income limitations and other qualifiers that make the traditional
IRA less deductible based on how high your income is. See IRS Publication
590 for more details.
Wait a minute! You may be thinking that IRAs usually are done with mutual
funds or bank investments. How does the stock investor take advantage of
an IRA? Stock investors can open a self-directed IRA with a brokerage firm.
This means that you can buy and sell stocks in the account with no taxes
on dividends or capital gains. The account is tax deferred, so you don’t
have to worry about taxes until you start making withdrawals. Also, many
dividend reinvestment plans (DRPs) have IRAs as well. See Chapter 18 for
more about DRPs.
Roth IRA
The Roth IRA is a great retirement plan that I wish had existed a long time ago.
Here are some ways to distinguish the Roth IRA from the traditional IRA:
 The Roth IRA provides no tax deduction for contributions.
 It can grow tax free and be withdrawn tax free when you, again, 
turn 591⁄ 2.
 It doesn’t have any early distribution penalties.
The maximum contribution per year for Roth IRAs is the same as for traditional
IRAs. You can open a self-directed account with a broker as well. See IRS
Publication 590 for details on qualifying.
401(k) plans
Company-sponsored 401(k) plans (named after the section in the tax code
that allows them) are widely used and are very popular. In a 401(k) plan, com-
panies set aside money from their paychecks that the employees can use to
invest for retirement. Generally, you can invest as much as $14,000 in 2005 and
$15,000 in 2006 of your pretax earned income and have it grow tax deferred.
Usually, the money is in a mutual fund through a mutual fund company or an
insurance firm. Although most 401(k) plans don’t give you the opportunity to
be self-directed, I mention them in this book for good reason.
265
Chapter 20: Tax Benefits and Obligations

Because your money is in a mutual fund that may invest in stocks, take an
active role in finding out the mutual funds in which you’re allowed to invest.
Most plans allow you several types of stock mutual funds. Use your growing
knowledge about stocks to make more informed choices about your 401(k)
plan options.
Keep in mind that a mutual fund is only as good as what it invests in. Ask the
plan administrator some questions about the funds and the types of stocks
it invests in. Are the stocks defensive or cyclical? (For more information on
defensive and cyclical stocks, see Chapter 12.) Are they large-cap or small-cap?
If you don’t make an informed choice about the investments in your plan,
someone else will (such as the plan administrator). They probably won’t
have the same ideas about your money as you do.

Ten Warning Signs of a 
Stock’s Decline
In This Chapter
 Slowdown in earnings and sales
 Reduced dividends
 Industry or political troubles
 Questionable accounting practices
H
ave you ever watched a movie and noticed that one of the characters
coughs excessively throughout the entire film? To me, that’s a dead
giveaway that the character is a goner. Or maybe you’ve seen a movie in
which a bit character annoys a crime boss, so right away you know that it’s
time for him to “sleep with the fishes.” Stocks aren’t that different. If you’re
alert, you can recognize some definite signs that your investment may be
ready to kick the bucket.
Let the tips in this chapter serve as a “symptoms checklist” on your stock
investment. This chapter will help you catch your stock as it starts to “cough,”
so that you can get out before it “sleeps with the fishes.” (I just can’t help you
with mixed metaphors.)
Earnings Slow Down or Head South
Profit is the lifeblood of a company. Of course, the opposite is true as well.
The lack of profit is a sign of a company’s poor financial health. Watch the
earnings. Are they increasing or not? If they aren’t, find out why. If the general
economy is experiencing a recession, stagnant earnings are still better than
robust losses — everything is relative. Earnings slowdowns for a company may
very well be a temporary phenomenon. If a company’s earnings are holding
up better than its competitors and/or the market in general, you don’t need
to be alarmed.

Nonetheless, a company’s earnings are its most important measure of suc-
cess. Keep an eye on the company’s P/E ratio. It could change negatively
(go up) because of one of two basic scenarios:
 The stock price goes up as earnings barely budge.
 The stock price doesn’t move, yet earnings drop.
Both of these scenarios result in a rising P/E ratio that ultimately has a nega-
tive effect on the stock price.
A P/E ratio that is lower than industry competitors’ P/E ratios makes a com-
pany’s stock a favorable investment.
Don’t buy the argument “Although the company has losses, its sales are
exploding.” This argument is a variation of “The company may be losing
money, but it’ll make it up on volume.” For example, say that Sweet Patootee,
Inc., (SPI) had sales of $1 billion in 2005 and that sales expect to be $1.5 billion
in 2006, projecting an increase at SPI by 50 percent. But what if SPI’s earnings
were $200 million in 2005 and the company was actually expecting a loss for
2006? The company wouldn’t succeed, because sales without earnings isn’t
enough — the company needs to make a profit. Remember that if you put
your money in the stock of a company that has losses, you’re not investing,
you’re speculating.
Sales Slow Down
Before you invest in a company, make sure that sales are strong and rising.
If sales start to decline, that downward motion ultimately affects earnings.
(See the previous section, “Earnings Slow Down or Head South.”) Although
the earnings of a company may go safely up and down, sales should consis-
tently rise. If they cease to rise, a variety of reasons may be to blame. First,
it may be temporary because the economy in general is having tough times.
However, it may be more serious. Perhaps the company is having marketing
problems, or a competitor is eating away at its market share. Maybe a new
technology is replacing its products and services. In any case, falling sales
raise a red flag you shouldn’t ignore.
By the way, when I talk sales, I’m talking about the sales of what the company
usually offers (its products or services). Sometimes a company may sell some-
thing other than what it normally offers (such as equipment, real estate, or
a subdivision of its business) and this sale may make the total sales number
temporarily blip upward. Watch for this because it can fool you regarding the
company’s financial strength. Maybe the unusual sale is due to financial or
cash flow problems that the company is experiencing. The bottom line is to
simply check it out.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Exuberant Analysts Despite Logic
Too often, analysts give glowing praise to stocks that any logical person with
some modest financial acumen would avoid like the plague. Why is this? In
many instances, there is, alas, a dark motive (or something not so dark such
as . . . ugh . . . stupidity). In any case, remember that analysts are employed
by companies that earn hefty investment banking fees from the very compa-
nies that these analysts tout. In that situation, issuing a less-than-complete or
truthful report can be easy.
Conflict of interest was cited as a primary factor in an SEC survey taken in
2000 showing that brokers overwhelmingly give glowing recommendations
on stocks (“strong buy,” “buy,” and “market outperform”). The SEC noticed
only an outright “sell” recommendation in less than 1 percent of all the rec-
ommendations that it reviewed, even though 2000 witnessed crashing stock
prices in most of the popular stocks that were analyzed. Analysts, no matter
how objective they may sound, are still employees of companies that make
money from the same companies that the analysts analyze.
In fact, you should be wary of analysts’ views, especially the analysts who
make positive recommendations even when the company in question has
worrisome features, such as no income and tremendous debt. It seems like
a paradox: Sell a stock when all the pros say to buy it? How can that be?
Remember, the merits of any stock should speak for themselves. When a
company is losing money, all the great recommendations in the world can’t
reverse its fortunes. Also, keep in mind that if everybody is buying a parti-
cular stock — the current analysts’ favorite — who’s left to buy it? When it
turns out to be a dud, you aren’t able to sell it because all the other suckers
already own it (thanks to analysts’ recommendations). And, if they already
own it, they’re probably already aware of the company’s flaws. What happens
then? You got it: More and more people end up selling it. When more people
are selling rather than buying a stock, its price declines.
Insider Selling
Heavy insider selling is to a stock what garlic, sunrises, and crosses are to
vampires: an almost certain sign of doom! If you notice that increasing num-
bers of insiders (such as the president of the company, the treasurer, and the
vice-president of finance, for instance) are selling their stock holdings, you
can consider it a red flag. In recent years, massive insider selling has become
a telltale sign of a company’s imminent fall from grace. After all, who better to
know the company’s prospects for success (or lack of) than the company’s
high-level management? What management does (selling stock, for example)
speaks louder than what management says. (Do you hear that loud and persis-
tent coughing again?) For more information on insider trading, see Chapter 19.
271
Chapter 21: Ten Warning Signs of a Stock’s Decline

Dividend Cuts
For investors who own income stock, dividends are the primary considera-
tion. But, income stock or not, dividend cuts are a negative sign. Of course, if
a company is having modest financial difficulty, perhaps a dividend cut is a
good thing for the overall health of the company. However, usually analysts
see a dividend cut as a sign that a company is having trouble with its earn-
ings or cash flow. In either case, a dividend cut is a warning sign that trouble
may be brewing for the firm as it becomes . . . uh . . . less firm.
If the company you own stock in announces a dividend cut, find out why.
The cut may be simply a temporary measure to help the company out
of some minor financial difficulty, or it may be a sign of deeper trouble.
Check the company’s fundamentals and then decide. (Refer to Chapter 11
to find out how to read and interpret company financial documents.)
Increased Negative Coverage
You may easily recognize unfavorable reports of a company’s stock as a
sign to unload that stock. Or you may be a contrarian and see bad press 
as an opportunity to scoop up some shares of a company victimized by 
negative reporting. In any case, take the negative reports as a signal to fur-
ther investigate the merits of holding on to the stock or as a sign for selling
it so that you can make room in your portfolio for a more promising stock
choice.
Industry Problems
Sometimes being a strong company doesn’t matter if that company’s
industry is having problems; if the industry is in trouble, the company’s
decline probably isn’t that far behind. Tighten up those trailing stops.
(See Chapter 17 to find out how.) Also, try to be aware of industries that
are intimately related to your industry. Very often, problems in one industry
can affect or spread to a related industry. If auto sales are plummeting
(for example), then that may have a negative effect on prospects for auto
parts or auto services companies.
272
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Political Problems
Political considerations are always a factor in investing. Be it taxes, regulations,
or other government actions, politics can easily break a company and send its
stock plummeting. If your company’s stock is sensitive to political develop-
ments, be aware of potential political pitfalls for your stock (or industry) of
choice. Reading The Wall Street Journal and regularly viewing major financial
Web sites can help you stay informed. (I give you lists of sources in Appendix
A.) In recent years, drug and tobacco stocks in general suffered because of
prevailing political attitudes. Also, certain stocks in particular (Microsoft in
the late 1990s comes to mind) have seen their stock prices drop drastically
because they were targets of government actions for reasons ranging from
antitrust concerns to public safety issues.
Debt Is Too High or Unsustainable
Excessive debt is the kiss of death for a struggling company. During 2000–2002,
many companies that experts thought were invincible went bankrupt. In 2001,
a record 255 public companies filed for bankruptcy. The most obvious exam-
ple is Enron. Many analysts and investment advisory publications actually
touted Enron as a strong buy — even though the amount of problematic data
could have made Godzilla gag. I still get a kick out of reading an old issue of a
financial magazine that listed the defunct company the year before its demise
as one of ten stocks “for the long haul!” Yikes! Writers like that end up getting
hobbies like hang-gliding during hurricane season. Chapter 11 and Appendix
B can help you read and understand a company’s financial data clearly so
that you can make an informed decision about buying or selling its stock.
Funny Accounting: No Laughing Here!
Throughout this book, I discuss the topic of accounting as an important way
to see how well (or how poorly) a company is doing. Understanding a com-
pany’s balance sheet and income statement, and making a simple comparison
of these documents over a period of several years, can give you great insights
into the company’s prospects. You don’t have to be an accountant to grasp key
concepts. Enron is a perfect example of how you can avoid a stock investing
disaster with some rudimentary knowledge of accounting.
273
Chapter 21: Ten Warning Signs of a Stock’s Decline

Despite the fact that Enron hid many of its financial problems from public
view, the information that was available made the message clear: “Danger
Will Robinson! Houston, we have a problem!” If investors had done some
simple homework, they would have plainly seen the following revealing
points in 2000, over a year and a half before the collapse:
 Enron’s price to earnings (P/E) ratio hit 90 in 2000. This stratospheric
P/E kept most value investors (including myself) away. (See Chapter 10
for more information on P/E ratios.)
 Its price to book (P/B) ratio hit 12. For investors, this ratio meant that
the market value of the company, compared to the company’s book
value (also called “accounting value”), was 12 to 1 — for every $12 of
market value, investors were getting only $1 in book value. When you
consider that a P/B ratio of 3 or 4 is considered nosebleed territory for
value investors, you can see that Enron’s P/B ratio was screaming,
“Watch out below!”
 The price to sales (P/S) ratio hit an incredible 22. This ratio means that
investors paid $22 in market value for every $1 of sales the company
generated. When a P/S of 5 or 10 is considered too high, 22 is nosebleed
territory!
I found this information in public filings that anyone could have seen. To under-
stand these points more fully (along with other equally incisive and lucid
accounting and financial points), and to know how to use the information to
avoid similar mistakes in the future, see Chapters 10 and 11 and Appendix B.

I
f you find a stock that has all ten signals listed in this chapter, back up the
truck and load up. The odds are that you won’t need all ten to indicate
that it’s a stock worth a closer look. Probably five or more signals are enough
to merit further consideration. In any case, the more signals, the better your
chances of choosing a winning stock.
Regardless of market conditions and investor sentiment (how investors “feel”
about stocks and the economy), remember the three rules of stock investing
success: profits, profits, profits, also known as earnings, earnings, earnings.
This advice is as important as real estate’s location, location, location. It’s that
important . . .uh . . . important, important.
Rise in Earnings
If a company earned $1 per share for the past three years and its earnings are
now $1.20 per share (a 20 percent increase), consider this increase a positive
harbinger. As the saying goes, “Earnings drive the market,” so you need to
pay attention to the company’s profitability. The more a company makes, the
greater the chance that its stock price will increase.
Some people wonder whether to invest in a company that was losing money
and then finally turns a profit. Perhaps you’re considering the stock of a com-
pany involved in new, untested technology. My advice is that you need to be
careful in this situation. In such a case, predicting whether a second year of
profits will show up is hard, but of course, that’s what investors are hoping.

For the serious investor, a track record of positive earnings is important.
Several years of earnings (especially growing earnings) are crucial in the
decision-making process. As earnings rise, make sure that the growth is at a
rate of 10 percent or higher.
Say that you’re looking at the stock Buckets-o-Cash, Inc. (BOC). BOC had earn-
ings of $1 per share in 2003, $1.10 in 2004, and $1.21 in 2005. First, you can see
that the company is a profitable enterprise. Second (and more importantly),
you can see that the earnings grew 10 percent each year. The fact that earnings
grew consistently year after year is important because it indicates that the
company is being managed well. Effective company management has a very
positive effect on the stock price as the market notices the company’s progress.
Growing earnings are important for another reason — inflation. If a company
earns $1 per share in each year, that’s, of course, better than earning less or
losing money. But inflation erodes the purchasing power of money. If earnings
stay constant, the company’s ability to grow decreases, because the value of
its money will decline as a result of inflation.
Increase in Assets as Debts 
Are Stable or Decreasing
Increasing assets while decreasing debts (or at least stabilizing them) is key to
growing the book value of a company. Book value refers to the company’s value
as it appears on a balance sheet — equal to total assets minus liabilities. Book
value usually differs significantly from market value (or market capitalization)
because market value is based on supply and demand of the company’s stock
in the marketplace. For example, a company may have a book value of $10 mil-
lion dollars (assets of $15 million less liabilities of $5 million) but a market
value of $19 million (if, for example, it has 1 million shares that are currently
trading at $19 per share). Usually, market value is higher (sometimes much
higher) than book value.
Rising book value has a positive impact on market value, which, in turn,
tends to drive the stock price up as well. Therefore, it pays to watch book
value. Rising book value can be accomplished in one of two basic ways:
 Debt stays level as assets rise.
 Assets stay level as debts decline.
When looking at a company’s assets and debts, the best scenario you can
find is assets rising and debts declining.
276
Part V: The Part of Tens 

At the most basic level, total assets should exceed total debt. Preferably, the
company should have a ratio of at least 2-to-1 or better in terms of assets to
debt. A ratio of 3-to-1 is better, and so on. The less debt, the better.
The best way to figure out a company’s asset to debt ratio is to look at the
company’s most recent balance sheet and compare it to its balance sheet
from prior periods (such as the year before or the same quarter last year).
By comparing the figures over three or more years, you can see a trend devel-
oping. If the asset to debt ratio has been stable or improving over these three
balance sheets, the company is showing growing financial strength, which
will help the company’s stock price increase in value.
Positive Publicity for Industry
When the media report that a company is doing well financially or that its
products and services are being well received by both the media and the
market, that news lets you know that this company’s stock may be going
places. This positive publicity ties in nicely with the other point made in this
chapter about consumer acceptance for the company’s products and services.
Positive press and consumer acceptance are important because they mean that
the company is doing what’s necessary to please its customers. The positive
media coverage also may attract new customers to the company. Gaining cus-
tomers means more sales and more earnings, which translates into a higher
price for the stock. You can find corporate publicity at Web sites such as
www.prnewswire.com and track the industries at www.hoovers.com.
Heavy Insider or Corporate Buying
Company insiders (such as the CEO and the treasurer) know better than
anyone else about the health of a company. If insiders are buying stock by
the boatload, then these purchases are certainly a positive sign for investors.
Chapter 19 thoroughly covers insider trading, but I highlight the main points
here. Insiders can do one of two things:
 Buy stock for themselves: If individuals such as the CEO or the treasurer
are buying stocks for their personal portfolios, you can assume that they
think the stock is a good investment.
 Buy stock as a corporate decision: When the corporation buys its own
stock, it’s usually considered a positive move. The corporation may see
its own stock as a good investment. Additionally, corporate stock buying
reduces the number of shares available in the market, potentially pushing
the stock price higher.
277
Chapter 22: Ten Signals of a Stock Price Increase

All things being equal, either one will have a positive impact on the stock price.
The odds are that you won’t see a stampede of insiders buying the stock in
a day or week, but you will see it over a period of months. This is generally
true simply because each insider has different circumstances, and insider
buying is usually done on an individual basis. An accumulation of purchases
tells you that members of the management team believe so strongly that the
company will do well that they’re willing to put their own money at risk.
More Attention from Analysts
During 2000–2002, analysts were criticized for being zealously optimistic
about stocks. I usually don’t advise people to invest (or not invest) because
of analysts’ views, but they’re important nonetheless. Many good analyst
reviews, and the public’s opinion of a single influential analyst, can make a
stock’s price move dramatically.
Analyze a stock according to its own merits first. Then watch the stock’s
price as more and more analysts start to direct the public’s attention to it.
In a sense, they’re promoting your stock, an action that tends to boost the
stock’s price. Don’t let the analyst’s views sway you, though, because analysts
may tout a stock for unsavory reasons. Perhaps the company is a client of the
brokerage firm, or maybe the brokerage firm owns a lot of the company’s
shares and wants to unload them.
Rumors of Takeover Bids
I never want anyone to base an investment decision on a rumor of a takeover
bid, but it doesn’t hurt if you were considering the stock anyway — basing
your decision on a variety of other solid factors, of course, such as strong
fundamentals, earnings growth, popular products or services, and so on.
A company that’s rumored to be a takeover candidate (a company that may
be potentially bought out by another company) may have an attractive aspect,
such as a promising new patent or exclusive rights to certain properties, that
could make it worthy for investors as well.
Rumors of a buyout are always welcome, but the bottom line is that it should
alert you to a good value. Regardless of whether the buyout rumor proves
true, you shouldn’t even consider the stock if it isn’t worth owning on its own
merits. If it’s a good stock, the rumor tends to increase its visibility so that
the chances of a takeover do, in fact, increase. Rumor or not, the attention
does tend to increase the stock’s price.
278
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Praise from Consumer Groups
A company is only as good as the profit it generates. The profit it generates is
only as good as the revenues that the company generates. The revenues are
based on whether customers are accepting (and shelling out money for) the
company’s products or services. Therefore, if what the company offers is
popular with consumers, it bodes well for profits and consequently higher
stock prices.
When you’re ready to invest in stocks, look for high consumer satisfaction.
Review consumer publications and Web sites and read the surveys and con-
sumer feedback information. Good publicity and word-of-mouth consumer
satisfaction are things that investors should be aware of. Stock-picking expert
Peter Lynch (formerly of Fidelity Magellan fund fame) sees this popularity
with consumers as very valuable stock-picking information. He likes to see
what consumers buy because that’s where the company’s success starts.
Strong or Improving Bond Rating
In Chapter 9, I point out that a poor or deteriorating bond rating is a warning
sign for the company. The creditworthiness of a company is a critical factor
in determining the company’s strength. Most people presume that the bond
rating is primarily beneficial for bond investors, and they’re correct. However,
because the bond rating is assigned according to the company’s ability to
pay back the bond plus interest, it stands to reason that a strong bond rating
(usually a rating of AAA or AA) indicates that the company is financially strong.
The work of independent bond rating firms, such as Standard & Poor’s and
Moody’s, is invaluable for stock investors. For more about bond ratings, turn
to Chapter 9.
Powerful Demographics
If you know that a company generates lots of profit from the teenage market
and you find out that the teenage market is going to expand by 10 percent per
year for the foreseeable future, what would you do? Exactly — you’d buy the
stock of that company. If a company has strong fundamentals and appealing
products or services and its market is expanding, that company has a win-
ning combination.

Stay alert to growing trends in society. How are demographics changing?
Which sectors of the population are growing? Shrinking? What shifts are
expected in society in terms of age or ethnicity? Check out the data freely
available at the Department of Commerce’s Web site for the U.S. Census

Take Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP). It services the fast-growing Las Vegas
region of Nevada. The region experienced blistering growth during 2003–
2005. SRP’s stock price went from $3 in early 2004 and hit $14 by mid-2005.
Population and economic expansion played a huge role in the company’s
growth and subsequent stock price rise.
A market that’s growing in size isn’t an indicator all by itself (in fact, no indi-
cator gives you the green light all by itself anyway), but it should alert you to
do some research. The fact that a strong company sees improving demographic
shifts in its marketplace is a big plus.
Low P/E Relative to Industry or Market
The price to earnings (P/E) ratio is a critical number for investors. Value
investors in particular scrutinize it. Because the stock price’s future ability to
rise is ultimately tied to the company’s earnings (profits), you want to know
that you’re not paying too much for the stock. A low P/E ratio (low relative
to some standard, such as the industry’s average or the average P/E for the
S&P 500) is generally considered safe, and the stock is a potential bargain.
If the industry’s P/E ratio is 20 and you’re looking at a stock that has a P/E
of 15, all things being equal, that’s great. The company has room for growth,
and you have a good value.

Ten Ways to Protect Yourself 
from Fraud
In This Chapter
 Looking to the SEC for help
 Adopting a skeptical attitude
 Steering clear of scams
M
aking money is tough enough without worrying about who is out to get
your money. The usual suspects, such as the IRS and other government
agencies, are trying to take your money legally. Fortunately, most of that money
goes to beneficial pursuits (or so I hope). However, others are out to take
your money by illegal methods. Fraud and theft schemes have always been
there. Scammers are most prevalent during two economic conditions: when
times are really, really good and when times are really, really bad. During the
Great Depression, and a manic bull market alike, fraudsters were part of the
human condition. Bottom line: Be alert and use the tips in this chapter to
avoid being scammed.
Be Wary of Unsolicited Calls and E-mails
Phone calls or e-mails out of the blue to solicit money from you are always a
bit questionable, but if they offer investments, you need to be particularly
careful. But you knew that, right? You’ve read countless consumer reports
warning you about investing through telemarketers and/or spammers. If the
investment that’s being pitched is so good, why is someone calling to sell you
on it? Hasn’t the financial press reported it? It probably has, but only as an
advisory warning you to turn down any such offers. Find out more at Web
sites such as www.fraudbureau.com and www.fraud.org.

Get to Know the SEC
Long before you invest your first dollar, whether in stocks or any other finan-
cial investment, get to know the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
It’s there primarily to protect investors from fraud and other unlawful activity
designed to fleece them. The federal government created the SEC during the
early 1930s to crack down on abuses that continued to linger from the specu-
lative and questionable trading practices that were in high gear during the
stock market mania of the late 1920s.
The SEC has an excellent Web site at www.sec.gov. The site offers plenty of
great articles and resources for both novice and experienced investors to help
you watch out for fraud and better understand the financial markets and how
they work. Look up the telephone numbers for regional offices and feel free to
call with your questions about dubious investments and brokers or dealers.
The SEC carries on a number of activities designed to help you invest with
confidence. It maintains a database on file about complaints lodged against
brokers and companies that have committed fraud or other abuses against
the investing public.
Your tax dollars pay for this important agency. Find out about its free pub-
lications, services, and resources before you invest. If you’ve already been
victimized by unscrupulous operators, call the SEC for assistance.
Don’t Invest If You Don’t Understand
Investments frequently can come in complicated forms that promise a great
return but can be hard to understand. The premise of the investment — how
it works and how it will create a great return on your money — may be hard
to figure out. Scammers count on people being overwhelmed by the details
to the point that they ignore the mechanics of the deal. Don’t fall for such
approaches. You should understand exactly what you’re investing in, how it
makes money, and what the risks are. If you still can’t understand the invest-
ment (even if it’s legitimate), then you’re better off not plunging in with your
hard-earned money.
If the investment still sounds intriguing, then at the very least get a second
opinion by reviewing the details with advisors you trust.
282
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Question the Promise of 
Extraordinary Returns
In good times and bad, people want to make as much money as possible
with their investments. Hey, who doesn’t? If your money is in a bank account
earning a paltry 2 percent, what’s wrong with putting some of it into some
investment earning 17 percent compounded hourly? The extraordinary
returns promised either end up being illusory or the result of great risk.
Misrepresenting or inflating promises of a great return on your money
is common; sometimes even good brokers can unwittingly make them.
Higher returns mean more exposure to loss.
If the investment is bona fide and is quoted as having a high rate of return
(either in income or capital gains potential), then you can expect commensurate
risk. The risk may not be immediately apparent, but it’s there. As the Johnny-
one-note that I am in this chapter, I recommend that you seek independent
third parties for an informed second opinion. Appendix A has an extensive
list of places and people to turn to.
A notable investment pro once remarked, “Sometimes, a return on your money
is not as important as a return of your money.” In other words, until you pick
up more investing knowledge, keeping your original investment safe is better
than risking it for questionable, pie-in-the-sky promises.
Verify the Investment
If anyone asks you to invest, first verify that the investment exists. Sounds
weird, huh? Not really. Yes, many people have lost money in a bad or dubious
investment, but you’d be surprised at how many people have been willing to
fork over hard-earned money for phantom investments.
A man was prosecuted for fleecing millions from investors who were quick
to jump into a dot-com IPO that he was peddling. After the SEC and other
authorities investigated, they found that no such dot-com IPO existed at all.
(Does that make it a dot-gone?) Sometimes, you can’t trust a con man to be
even partially truthful.
283
Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Protect Yourself from Fraud

When someone offers you an investment and you’re not certain what type of
investment it is or where it’s traded, ask questions of the person presenting
the investment and of third parties who can offer verification. Here are some
questions to ask:
 What exchange or market is this investment traded or sold on?
 What government agency oversees this investment, and how can I con-
tact that agency?
 Have articles on this investment been published by major media
sources, such as The Wall Street Journal and Money magazine?
 Can I find documents filed by this company at the SEC’s document data-
base called EDGAR (Electronic Document Gathering and Retrieval System
found at www.sec.gov)?
 What literature do I have that I can present to my accountant and 
attorney?
Check Out the Broker
Sometimes the investment is legitimate, but the broker or dealer isn’t.
Scammers don’t let the absence of a license stop them. When an unfamiliar
financial products marketer contacts you, do some homework first. Contact
one of the following to check the status of a broker or dealer:
 Professional associations: Do you want to know whether a marketer
is a member in good standing? Associations help the public deal with
unethical parties in the industry.
 The National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD): Visit one of its
great Web sites at www.nasdr.com. This site informs the public about
brokers and dealers who have been convicted or have complaints
against them.
 The SEC: Are these marketers properly registered? The SEC can inform
you about whether these marketers have been penalized or banned from
further activity.
Beware of the Pump-and-Dump
The pump-and-dump is a classic scam that usually shows up in bull markets.
The scam works best with small-cap or (even better) microcap stocks — in
284
Part V: The Part of Tens 

other words, small companies that have relatively few shares or small capital-
ization. Scams are at their most effective when they can play on the two most
overworked emotions in the financial markets: greed and fear. In the pump-
and-dump, greed is the operative emotion. In this example, the investor to be
plucked is called Walter Pidjun (no relation to the actor Walter Pidgeon).
The insiders at the dubious company first try to promote the stock as a
“hot investment.” The company activates the “pump” when insiders and/or a
stockbroker, in cahoots with the insiders, call up investors such as Mr. Pidjun
to tout this fantastic opportunity. They promise an opportunity to get into a
profitable stock that will skyrocket in value. As a result of the high-pressure
sales tactics, investors start buying the stock. This demand pushes up the
price easily because so few shares are available on this thinly-traded stock.
Perhaps Mr. Pidjun didn’t bite the first time the broker called, but the broker
calls again.
“Hello again, Mr. Pidjun! This is Barry Kuda, account representative from the
brokerage firm of Fleece, Peeples, & Scram. Do you remember that stock invest-
ment I brought to your attention last week? That’s right . . . Titanic Bio-Tech, Inc.
Have ya seen the way its price has zoomed since then? When I last spoke to
you, it was at $3 a share. Now it’s already at $47! Our respected research
department tells me it should be at $93 by lunchtime and will probably triple
again before the weekend. You don’t want to miss this opportunity of a lifetime!
Now how many shares would you like?”
Indeed, the price certainly went up dramatically as Mr. Kuda said it would.
Mr. Pidjun puts the order in immediately while dollar signs dance in his head.
The “pump” is working very well. After the fraudulent operators see that the
stock has gone as high as possible, they immediately sell their stock at grossly
inflated prices. The “dump” is complete, and they disappear into the woodwork.
Mr. Pidjun and the other investors watch as their “hot” investment turns stone
cold and the stock plummets to pennies on the dollar. Investors were so blinded
by their greed that the pump-and-dump scam has successfully been done
even in cases when no stock existed at all!
How can I do a warning about something legal in a chapter about fraud?
Actually, isn’t this entire chapter a warning? Yes, but sometimes you need a
warning for things that aren’t immediately apparent. As odd as this sounds,
I want to warn you about something that technically isn’t fraud. What is it?
Well, a legal version of the pump-and-dump scheme does exist. It’s not unusual
for brokers and analysts to “pump” up a stock in the media. For example, a
celebrated market strategist or high-profile CEO may talk up the wonderful
potential of XYZ stock on a financial show. Then later you find out (through
SEC filings, for instance) that while these people were recommending that
people buy the stock, they had actually been furtively selling their holdings
in the stock! You were hearing “buy, buy,” yet they were really saying “bye-bye.”
285
Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Protect Yourself from Fraud

Watch Out for Short-and-Abort
Short-and-abort works on the same premise as pump-and-dump. The differ-
ence is that instead of playing on the greed emotion, the con works on the
fear emotion. To understand this scam, you should keep in mind that one can
profit even when a stock falls in price by “going short.” Chapter 17 goes into
detail about making money from going short on a stock, but here I want to
briefly describe it.
Going short is a strategy that an investor can utilize in a margin account with
just about any broker. An investor may consider going short on a stock if she
expects the stock’s price to fall. Say that you think the stock of the company
Plummet Inc. (at $50 per share) will sink fast. When you tell the broker that
you want to go short on 100 shares of Plummet Inc., the broker borrows
100 shares from the market, sells those shares, and credits $5,000 to your
account (100 shares at $50 per share). Because this transaction is based on
“borrowed stock,” sooner or later you have to return the stock. Say that the
stock price falls to $30; you could then instruct your broker to “close out the
position.” This order means that the broker debits your account for $3,000
(to buy 100 shares at $30) and returns the stock to the source. In this case,
you make a $2,000 profit (the original $5,000 less the $3,000).
In the case of short-and-abort, the scammers want to make money from a
stock’s plummeting price. They may contact shareholders directly or plant
phony stories or press releases in the media to cause concern and panic over
a company’s prospects. Naturally, shareholders in that particular company
get anxious over their investment and decide to sell. The sudden, mass sell-
ing causes the stock’s price to fall. The scammer then closes out the short
position, takes the money, and runs.
Remember That Talk Is Cheap 
(Until You Talk to an Expert)
A fertile area for misleading investors is in the world of independent, third-
party information sources. As the bull market reached its zenith in late 1999,
some people were selling expensive stock-investing seminars and newsletters
that promised get-rich-quick results. One promoter sold basic information
(some of which was inaccurate) in a $5,000 seminar program. After many
complaints, the authorities investigated and found out that the presenters
made a lot of money from their seminars, but they actually lost money on
their investment strategies! (It figures.)
286
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Another information marketer published an expensive newsletter that promised
lucrative stock picks. It was discovered that he wasn’t recommending stocks
found through diligent and honest research; he recommended the stocks
because the companies paid him to tout their stocks.
Seminars and newsletters are excellent sources of information and expertise
on a given topic, but you should stay away from marketers that use hard-sell
approaches for outrageously priced seminars and other information products.
If you’re considering expensive seminars and information products, check
with such sources as www.fraud.org and the Better Business Bureau at
www.bbbonline.org for registered complaints.
Recovering (If You Do Get Scammed)
If, despite your best efforts to invest wisely, you have that sinking feeling that
you’ve been conned, it’s time to gain assistance from securities enforcement
authorities. The SEC is a good place to start, but you can turn to other agen-
cies, too.
If a scheme was promoted through the postal service, contact the postal 
service (www.usps.com). File a complaint with the postmaster in your town.
Provide complete details in writing, including your account of what happened
and copies of literature you received from the offending organization.
Also contact the offices of appropriate state government attorneys general.
Find out more from the National Association of Attorneys General (www.
naag.org). See Appendix A for more resources.

Ten Challenges and Opportunities
for Stock Investors
In This Chapter
 The most pressing concerns for stock investors
 Other markets that can affect stocks
 The big picture and stocks
 Hidden opportunities with new economic megatrends
O
ver the years, I have found that the easiest way to make money with
stocks (or the easiest way to avoid losing money with stocks) was
to simply be aware of the economic environment in which they operate.
Stocks can be the best (or worst) investment given the economic/political
environment. There are many economic challenges facing the stock market
and they include what is happening with government policy, societal trends,
and national/international geopolitical conditions. You need to be aware
of “The big picture” by regularly checking in with great Web sites such as
Financial Sense (www.financialsense.com), Free Market News Network
(www.freemarketnews.com), and the Mises Institute (www.mises.org).
See Appendix A for more resources.
In this chapter, I discuss the most important issues or megatrends that can
affect you and your loved ones as well as your stock investments.
Debt, Debt, and More Debt
In early 2005, the United States’ Gross Domestic Product (GDP) hit the $12 tril-
lion mark. Great! However, the total level of debt in the country hit $38 trillion.
Ugh . . . NOT great. What has kept the economy afloat and “growing” during
the past eight to ten years has been massive and pervasive debt that must be
dealt with. Debt in just about every category is at record levels. This includes
mortgage, consumer, margin, corporate, and government debt. The problem
is that this debt must be either paid off or wiped out through bankruptcy.

Either one will have its negative consequences for the economy. Either one
can do great harm to stocks in general and/or your portfolio in particular.
Make sure that you are dealing with your debt level now. Reduce it as much as
possible and make sure that you are analyzing your stocks in the same light.
Companies that carry too much debt will be at great risk. If the company sinks,
your stock will follow. If the company goes into bankruptcy, your stock’s value
will be vaporized.
If you want to see something fascinating (and scary at the same time), check
out the total debt figures by viewing the Grandfather Economic Report by
Michael Hodges at http://mwhodges.home.att.net (if the Web site is no
longer there feel free to e-mail me at paul@mladjenovic.com and I’ll get the
info for you). It is sobering stuff!
Derivatives
Deriv . . . what? You might say “what the hell are they?” unless, of course,
you’re my church’s pastor. Derivatives are the largest financial market in the
world. As of July 2005, the total dollar value exceeds $280 trillion. It easily
dwarfs the world economy. Easily! Now, you don’t have to understand them
but you should be aware of what could go wrong if a derivatives problem
occurs. The once-mighty Enron imploded very quickly primarily due to tragic
errors in their derivatives portfolio. Derivatives “accidents” have dotted the
financial landscape over the past 10 to 15 years and they had (and will have)
the potential to do major damage to the stock market.
There’s no use fretting about derivatives. While you’re at it, you might as well
worry about meteors, presidential campaigns, and the chance you might get
O. J. Simpson as your neighbor. Just take common sense approaches to pro-
tect your portfolio as you grow your wealth. Look into diversifying, trailing
stops, and myriad strategies throughout this book and in the resources cited.
Real Estate
In much the same way that everyone was enamored and overzealous with
stocks a few years ago, the same is true with real estate circa 2004. The real
estate mania has turned into a dangerous bubble and it is an ominous devel-
opment for the economy and yes . . . stocks. The expansion of the money
supply, excessive credit and debt growth, and the lowering of lending stan-
dards have acted like rocket fuel for the real estate market causing prices to
rise beyond reasonable market value. Millions of homeowners, investors, and
speculators will be adversely affected. And listen, I’m not just talking about
property owners. The tentacles of the housing bubble reach far beyond bricks
and mortar. Mortgages in the hundreds of billions have been packaged and
290
Part V: The Part of Tens 

resold as securities and purchased by many mutual funds, insurance compa-
nies, Fortune 500 companies, and pension plans. Because a huge chunk of
these are “sub-prime” (risky) debt, that means huge problems as interest
rates rise, the economy sags, and so on.
The message to you is clear: Make sure you have your mortgage under con-
trol and your debt at manageable levels. Make sure that you avoid stocks of
companies that are overly exposed to what will most likely be a bubble that
could dwarf the stock bubble of 1998–2002.
Inflation
The last time inflation was a major problem was the late 1970s and . . . you
guessed it . . . the market was having a rough time. Interest rates soared to
over 18 percent and it was economic headaches for everyone. Although infla-
tion was generally tame during the ’80s and ’90s, it is showing renewed life
during this decade due to a massive expansion of the money supply that
started in earnest in 1995. I think that it is a minor scandal that the official
inflation rate (Consumer Price Index or CPI) excludes food and energy costs.
This significantly understates what our daily costs of living are. Without food
and energy, the inflation rate recently hovered in the 2 ƒ 1/2 to 3 percent range.
Just think: As long as you don’t eat, turn on your lights, or drive, you’re doing
great! If these costs were realistically included, the inflation rate would easily
be two to three times higher.
For stock investors, this means that having your money grow is more impor-
tant than ever. Understanding the pernicious effects of inflation should be
factored into your stock picks. Some stocks will suffer (mortgage companies
with fixed-debt portfolios) while others (precious metals mining companies)
will prosper.
Pension Crisis
You’ve seen all the headlines: “Pension plans are a growing crisis.” “San Diego
has pension crisis.” “People are living longer lives.” “People are not saving
enough for retirement.” Many state/local governments and large companies
will experience shortfalls in their financial ability to meet retirement plan
obligations. Millions of people will, at the very least, not get as much as they
expect when they retire. In addition, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
(see www.pbgc.gov) does not have enough funds to cover the shortfall of
company pension plans. According to a survey cited by Forbes magazine, 313
(62 percent!) of the 500 companies listed in the S&P 500 do not have enough
funds to cover their future expected financial obligations (as of early 2005).
America is not alone; Europe, Japan, and even China are in the same (or
worse!) predicament.
291
Chapter 24: Ten Challenges and Opportunities for Stock Investors

The message is clear: People need to save and invest more to fill in the finan-
cial gaps that seem to be inevitable. Stocks are a wealth-building tool that is
well suited for long-term needs such as your retirement concerns. Start now
because the future has a way of sneaking up on you faster than you think.
Government’s Unfunded Liabilities
Social Security and Medicare are certain to be gigantic challenges during the
next few decades. As of June 2005, the total liabilities for these mammoth
programs exceed $44 trillion. That’s not a typo; it’s a combined liability that
is nearly four times our nation’s gross domestic product (GDP). Current 
beneficiaries will likely not be affected, but anyone under 65 will certainly be.
Let’s face it: We’re living longer than ever before and we will need to be more
proactive about our personal responsibility in our senior years. To find
out more, review your rights and responsibilities with the Social Security
Administration (www.ssa.gov) and Medicare (www.medicare.gov). Also
check out some excellent private sites such as www.socialsecurity.org,
www.Medicare.org, and www.MedicareNewsWatch.com.
Recession/Depression
History tells us that stock investing during a recession or depression is best
avoided. Declines in economic growth always follow artificial economic booms.
In this decade, the likelihood of a recession or depression is remarkably high
due to the fact that economic problems and imbalances (such as debt, hous-
ing bubble, and so on) need to be addressed, and that means a significant
downturn. Become more aware about economics and how it operates. Find
out more at reader-friendly sites such as Dismal Scientist (www.economy.com),
American Institute for Economic Research (www.aier.org), and Foundation
for Economic Education (www.fee.org).
In rough economic times, the best stocks are defensive (food, beverage, utili-
ties, and so on) because people will buy these things no matter how good or
bad the economy is. Cyclical stocks will get beaten down so it might be a
good idea to shop around for real values after the economy turns around.
In the meanwhile, play it safe and protect your money with solid, financially
sound companies and deploy protective strategies with your money.
292
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Commodities
A shrewd man once said, “History may not repeat but it can often rhyme”
(Okay, it was me!). In many respects, this decade resembles the 1970s. Stocks
were having a dreadful time as inflation, the energy crisis, and international
tensions escalated. However, it was a great time to invest in energy, precious
metals, and commodities. Gold and silver hit all-time highs by the end of the
decade. Stock investors that scooped up shares of companies in these spe-
cific industries racked up tremendous gains. The lesson for us to understand
is that conditions in this decade offer opportunities in natural resources that
mirror the late 1970s. In addition, China and India are growing and they will
need more commodities (grains, base metals, energy, water, and so on) for
their expanding economies and populations.
As demand continues to outpace supply, the stocks of companies that pro-
vide products and services in natural resources will shine.
Energy
The world’s appetite for energy (oil, gas, and so on) has caused prices to
hit record highs, and the coming years promise more demand. The energy
markets have seen a sea of change that makes current conditions far more
different and more serious than we’ve seen in recent decades. We have
entered the age of “Peak Oil” (see more about this at www.peakoil.net),
which means that cheap and readily available energy is a thing of the past.
In August 2005, oil hit $67 per barrel as gasoline topped $3 per gallon in
many spots across the country. All of a sudden, $100 oil and $7 gas doesn’t
seem so farfetched. Supply and demand is nowhere more evident than the
world’s energy market.
For stock investors, this at least means the chance to grow your money both
directly (energy companies, obviously) and indirectly (alternate energy com-
panies). If we want our wealth to grow, then we need to understand the
impact that energy will have on our portfolios. To get some excellent informa-
tion on the energy sector, try a resource such as Doug Casey’s Energy
Speculator (www.caseyresearch.com). For more information, check out
Chapter 13.

Chapter 24: Ten Challenges and Opportunities for Stock Investors

Dangers from Left Field
Gee, after being beaten up by the previous nine points, what else is needed?
This reminds me of the episode of “Get Smart” where the arch villain says
“You’ve been whipped, beaten, and tortured, but the picnic is over!” (I still
use that great line at parties.) In any case, I hope that I have impressed upon
you that it is a brave, new world fraught with dangers for the clueless, but
filled with wealth-building opportunities for the “clued in.” The fact is that
no one knows what will hit our economy and society from out of the blue.
Events such as 9/11, the tsunami in Asia, and Hurricane Katrina certainly tell
us the world has unseen perils for us and our prosperity. The point is that
terrorism and other factors will have an impact. Fortunately, you can make
changes . . . even slight changes . . . that can protect or grow your wealth.
Whether you’re talking about healthcare stocks that boom in response to
new health threats or concerns (mad cow disease, and so on) or stocks
of companies that prosper due to homeland security issues, your stock
investing program can survive and thrive. Stay informed and understand
that successful stock investing doesn’t happen in a vacuum.

Appendix B
Financial Ratios
A
s dull or cumbersome as the topic sounds, financial ratios are indeed
the “meat” of analyzing stocks. Sadly, most investors don’t exercise
their due diligence when it comes to doing some relatively easy things to
make sure that the company they’re investing in is a good place for their
hard-earned investment dollars. This appendix lists the most common ratios
that investors should be aware of and use. A solid company doesn’t have to
pass all these ratio tests with flying colors, but at a minimum, it should com-
fortably pass the ones regarding profitability and solvency:
 Profitability: Is the company making money? Is it making more or less
than it did in the prior period? Are sales growing? Are profits growing?
You can answer these questions by looking at the following ratios:
• Return on Equity
• Common Size Ratio (Income Statement)
• Return on Assets
 Solvency: Is the company keeping debts and other liabilities under con-
trol? Are the company’s assets growing? Is the company’s net equity
(or net worth or stockholders’ equity) growing?
You can answer these questions by looking at the following ratios:
• Debt-to-Net-Equity
• Working Capital
• Quick Ratio
While you examine ratios, keep these points in mind:
 Not every company and/or industry is the same. A ratio that seems
problematic in one industry may be just fine in another. Investigate.
 A single ratio isn’t enough on which to base your investment decision.
Look at several ratios covering the major aspects of a company’s finances.
 Look at two or more years of a company’s numbers to judge whether the
most recent ratio is better, worse, or unchanged from the previous year’s
ratio. Ratios can give you early warning signs regarding the company’s
prospects.

Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity means the ability to quickly turn assets into cash. Liquid assets are
simply assets that are easier to convert to cash. Real estate, for example, is
certainly an asset, but it’s not liquid because converting it to cash could take
weeks, months, or even years. Current assets such as checking accounts, sav-
ings accounts, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and inventory are
much easier to sell or convert to cash in a very short period of time.
Paying bills or immediate debt takes liquidity. Liquidity ratios help you
understand a company’s ability to pay its current liabilities. The most
common liquidity ratios are the current ratio and the quick ratio; the num-
bers to calculate them are located on the balance sheet.
Current ratio
The current ratio is the most commonly used liquidity ratio. It answers the
question “Does the company have enough financial cushion to meet its cur-
rent bills?” It’s calculated as follows:
Current ratio = total current assets ÷ total current liabilities
If Holee Guacamolee Corp. (HGC) has $60,000 in current assets and $20,000 in
current liabilities, the current ratio is 3 because the company has $3 of cur-
rent assets for each dollar of current liabilities. As a general rule, a current
ratio of 2 or more is desirable. A current ratio of less than 1 is a red flag that
the company may have a cash crunch that could cause financial problems.
Although many companies strive to get the current ratio to equal 1, I like to
see a higher ratio (in the range of 1–3) to keep a cash cushion should the
economy slow down.
Quick ratio
The quick ratio is frequently referred to as the “acid test” ratio. It’s a little
more stringent than the current ratio in that you calculate it without inven-
tory. I’ll use the current ratio example discussed in the preceding section.
What if half of the assets are inventory ($30,000 in this case)? Now what?
First, here’s the formula for the quick ratio:
Quick ratio = (Current assets less inventory) ÷ current liabilities
312
Part VI: Appendixes 

In the example, the quick ratio for HGC is 1.5 ($30,000 divided by $20,000). In
other words, the company has $1.50 of “quick” liquid assets for each dollar of
current liabilities. This amount is okay. Quick liquid assets include any money
in the bank, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. If quick liquid
assets at the very least equal or exceed total current liabilities, that amount
is considered adequate.
The acid test that this ratio reflects is embodied in the question “Can the
company pay its bills when times are tough?” In other words, if the company
can’t sell its goods (inventory), can it still meet its short-term liabilities? Of
course, you must watch the accounts receivable as well. If the economy is
entering rough times, you want to make sure that the company’s customers
are paying invoices on a timely basis.
Operating Ratios
Operating ratios essentially measure the company’s efficiency. “How is the
company managing its resources?” is a question commonly answered with
operating ratios. If, for example, a company sells products, does it have too
much inventory? If it does, that could impair the company’s operations. The
following sections present common operating ratios.
Return on equity (ROE)
Equity is the amount left from total assets after you account for total liabilities.
(This can also be considered a profitability ratio.) The net equity (also known
as shareholders’ equity, stockholders’ equity, or net worth) is the bottom line
in the company’s balance sheet, both geographically as well as figuratively.
It’s calculated as
Return on equity (ROE) = net income ÷ net equity
The net income (from the company’s income statement) is simply the total
income less total expenses. Net income that isn’t spent or used up increases
the company’s net equity. Looking at net income is a great way to see whether
the company’s management is doing a good job growing the business. You can
check this out by looking at the net equity from both the most recent balance
sheet and the one from a year earlier. Ask yourself whether the current net
worth is higher or lower than the year before. If it’s higher, by what percentage
is it higher? Use the ROE in conjunction with the ROA ratio (see the following
section) to get a fuller picture of a company’s activity.
313
Appendix B: Financial Ratios

Return on assets (ROA)
The ROA may seem similar to the ROE, but it actually gives a perspective that
completes the picture when coupled with the ROE. The formula for figuring
out ROA is
Return on assets = net income ÷ total assets
The ROA reflects the relationship between a company’s profit and the assets
used to generate it. If the company HGC makes a profit of $10,000 and has total
assets of $100,000, the ROA is 10 percent. This percentage should be as high
as possible, but it will generally be less than the ROE.
Say that the company has an ROE of 25 percent but an ROA of only 5 percent.
Is that good? It sounds okay, but a problem exists. If the ROA is much lower
than the ROE, it indicates that the higher ROE may have been generated by
something other than total assets — debt! The use of debt can be a leverage
to maximize the ROE, but if the ROA doesn’t show a similar percentage of 
efficiency, then the company may have incurred too much debt. In that case,
investors should be aware that it could cause problems (see the section,
“Solvency Ratios,” later in this appendix).
Sales to receivables ratio (SR)
The sales to receivables ratio (SR) gives investors an indication of a company’s
ability to manage what customers owe it. This ratio uses data from both the
income statement (sales) and from the balance sheet (accounts receivable,
or AR). The formula is expressed as
Sales to receivables ratio = sales ÷ receivables
Say that you have the following data for HGC:
Sales in 2005 are $75,000. On 12/31/05, receivables stood at $25,000.
Sales in 2006 are $80,000. On 12/31/06, receivables stood at $50,000.
Based on this data, you can figure out that sales went up 6.6 percent, but
receivables went up 100 percent! In 2005, the SR was 3 ($75,000 divided by
$25,000). However, the SR in 2006 sank to 1.6 ($80,000 divided by $50,000), or
nearly cut in half. Yes, sales did increase, but the company’s ability to collect
money due from customers fell dramatically. This information is important
to notice for one main reason: What good is selling more when you can’t get
the money? From a cash flow point of view, the company’s financial situation
deteriorated.
314
Part VI: Appendixes 

Solvency Ratios
Solvency just means that the company isn’t overwhelmed by its liabilities.
Insolvency means “Oops! Too late.” You get the point. Solvency ratios have
never been more important than they are now. Solvency ratios look at the
relationship between what the company owns and what it owes. Here are two
of the primary solvency ratios.
Debt to net equity ratio
The debt to net equity ratio is an indicator of the company’s solvency. It
answers the question “How dependent is the company on debt?” In other
words, it tells you how much the company owes and how much it owns.
You calculate it as follows:
Debt to net equity ratio = total liabilities ÷ net equity
If the company HGC has $100,000 in debt and $50,000 in net worth, the debt
to net equity ratio is 2. The company has two dollars of debt to every dollar
of net worth. In this case, what the company owes is twice the amount of
what it owns. Whenever a company’s debt to net equity ratio exceeds 1 
(as in the example), that isn’t good. In fact, the higher the number, the
more negative the situation. If the number is too high and the company isn’t
generating enough income to cover the debt, the company runs the risk of
bankruptcy.
Working capital
Technically, working capital isn’t a ratio, but it does belong to the list of
things that serious investors look at. Working capital means what the com-
pany has in current assets and its relationship to current liabilities. It’s a
simple equation:
Working capital = total current assets – total current liabilities
The point is obvious: Does the company have enough to cover the current
bills? Actually, you can formulate a useful ratio. If current assets are $25,000
and current liabilities are $25,000, then that’s a 1-to-1 ratio, which is cutting it
close. Current assets should be at least 50 percent higher than current liabili-
ties (say, $1.50 to $1.00) to have enough cushion to pay bills and have some
money for other purposes. Preferably, the ratio should be 2 to 1 or higher.
315
Appendix B: Financial Ratios

Common Size Ratios
Common size ratios offer simple comparisons. You have common size ratios
for both the balance sheet (where you compare total assets) and the income
statement (where you compare total sales):
 To get a common size ratio from a balance sheet, the total assets figure
is assigned the percentage of 100 percent. Every other item on the balance
sheet is represented as a percentage of total assets. For example, if Holee
Guacamolee Corp. (HGC) has total assets of $10,000 and debt of $3,000, you
know that total assets equal 100 percent, while debt equals 30 percent
(debt divided by total assets or $3,000 ÷ $10,000, which equals 30 percent).
 To get a common size ratio from an income statement (or profit and
loss statement), you compare total sales. For example, if a company has
$50,000 in total sales and a net profit of $8,000, then you know that the
profit equals 16 percent of total sales.
Keep in mind the following points with common size ratios:
 Net profit: What percentage of sales is it? What was it last year? How about
the year before? What percentage of increases (or decreases) is the com-
pany experiencing?
 Expenses: Are total expenses in line with the previous year? Are any
expenses going out of line?
 Net equity: Is this item higher or lower than the year before?
 Debt: Is this item higher or lower than the year before?
Common size ratios are used to compare the company’s financial data not
only with prior balance sheets and income statements but also with other
companies in the same industry. You want to make sure that the company is
not only doing better historically but also as a competitor in the industry.
Valuation Ratios
Understanding the value of a stock is very important for stock investors. The
quickest and most efficient way to judge the value of a company is to look at
valuation ratios. The type of value that you deal with throughout the book is
the market value (essentially the price of the company’s stock). You hope to
buy it at one price and sell it later at a higher price — that’s the name of the
game. But what’s the best way to determine whether what you’re paying for
now is a bargain or is fair market value? How do you know whether your
stock investment is undervalued or overvalued? The valuation ratios in this
appendix can help you answer these questions. In fact, they’re the same
ratios that value investors have used with great success for many years.
316
Part VI: Appendixes 

Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)
The price-to-earnings ratio can also double as a profitability ratio because it’s
a common barometer of value that many investors and analysts look at. I cover
this topic in Chapter 10, but because it’s such a critical ratio, I also include it
here. The formula is
P/E ratio = price (per share) ÷ earnings (per share)
For example, if a company’s stock price per share is $10 and the earnings per
share are $1, the P/E is 10 (10 divided by 1).
The P/E ratio answers the question “Am I paying too much for the company’s
earnings?” Value investors find this number to be very, very important. Here
are some points to remember:
 Generally, the lower the P/E ratio, the better (from a financial strength
point of view). Frequently, a low P/E ratio indicates that the stock is
undervalued (or the company is failing).
 A company with a P/E ratio significantly higher than its industry average
is a red flag that its stock price is too high (or that it is growing faster
than its competitors).
 Don’t invest in a company with no P/E ratio (it has a stock price, but the
company experienced losses). Such a stock may be good for a specula-
tor’s portfolio but not for your retirement account.
 Any stock with a P/E higher than 40 should be considered a speculation
and not an investment. Frequently, a high P/E ratio indicates that the
stock is overvalued.
When you buy a company, you’re really buying its power to make money. In
essence, you’re buying its earnings. Paying for a stock that’s priced at 10 to
20 times earnings is a conservative strategy that has served investors well
for nearly a century. Make sure that the company is priced fairly and use the
P/E ratio in conjunction with other measures of value (such as the ratios in
this appendix).
Price to sales ratio (PSR)
The price to sales ratio (PSR) is another method for valuing the company. It
helps to answer the question “Am I paying too much for the company’s stock
based on the company’s sales?” This is a useful valuation ratio that I recom-
mend using as a companion tool with the company’s P/E ratio. You calculate
it as follows:
PSR = stock price (per share) ÷ total sales (per share)
317
Appendix B: Financial Ratios

This ratio can be quoted on a per-share basis or on an aggregate basis. For
example, if a company’s market value (or market capitalization) is $1 billion
and annual sales are also $1 billion, the PSR is 1. If the market value in this
example is $2 billion, then the PSR is 2. For investors trying to make sure that
they’re not paying too much for the stock, the general rule is that the lower
the PSR, the better. Stocks with a PSR of 2 or less are considered undervalued.
Be very hesitant about buying a stock with a PSR greater than 5. If you buy a
stock with a PSR of 38, that means you’re paying $38 for each dollar of sales —
not exactly a bargain.
Price to book ratio (PBR)
The price to book ratio (PBR) is yet another valuation method. This ratio
compares the market value to the company’s accounting (or book) value.
Recall that the book value refers to the company’s net equity (assets minus
liabilities). The company’s market value is usually dictated by external fac-
tors such as supply and demand in the stock market. The book value is
indicative of the company’s internal operations. Value investors see the
PBR as another perspective to valuing the company to determine whether
you’re paying too much for the stock. The formula is
Price to book ratio (PBR) = market value ÷ book value
An alternate method is to calculate the ratio on a per-share basis, which
yields the same ratio. If the company’s stock price is $20 and the book value
(per share) is $15, then the PBR is 1.33. In other words, the company’s market
value is 33 percent higher than its book value. Investors seeking an underval-
ued stock like to see the market value as close as possible to (or even better,
below) the book value.
Keep in mind that the PBR may vary depending on the industry and other
factors. Also, judging a company solely on book value may be misleading
because many companies have assets that aren’t adequately reflected in the
book value. Software companies are a good example. Intellectual properties,
such as copyrights and trademarks, are very valuable yet aren’t fully covered
in book value. Just bear in mind that, generally, the lower the market value is
in relation to the book value, the better for you (especially if the company
has strong earnings and the outlook for the industry is positive).
