ABOUT THE SERIES
Culture shock is a state of disorientation that can come over 
anyone who has been thrust into unknown surroundings, away 
from one’s comfort zone. CultureShock! is a series of trusted 
and reputed guides which has, for decades, been helping 
expatriates and long-term visitors to cushion the impact of 
culture shock whenever they move to a new country.
Written by people who have lived in the country and 
experienced culture shock themselves, the authors share all the 
information necessary for anyone to cope with these feelings 
of disorientation more effectively. The guides are written in a 
style that is easy to read and covers a range of topics that will 
arm readers with enough advice, hints and tips to make their 
lives as normal as possible again.  
Each book is structured in the same manner. It begins 
with the ﬁ rst impressions that visitors will have of that city or 
country. To understand a culture, one must ﬁ rst understand the 
people—where they came from, who they are, the values and 
traditions they live by, as well as their customs and etiquette. 
This is covered in the ﬁ rst half of the book. 
Then on with the practical aspects—how to settle in with 
the greatest of ease. Authors walk readers through topics 
such as how to ﬁ nd accommodation, get the utilities and 
telecommunications up and running, enrol the children in 
school and keep in the pink of health. But that’s not all. Once 
the essentials are out of the way, venture out and try the food, 
enjoy more of the culture and travel to other areas. Then be 
immersed in the language of the country before discovering 
more about the business side of things. 
To round off, snippets of basic information are offered 
before readers are ‘tested’ on customs and etiquette of the 
country. Useful words and phrases, a comprehensive resource 
guide and list of books for further research are also included 
for easy reference.

INTRODUCTION
This revised edition of CultureShock! Egypt brings with it what 
I hope is an even better understanding of what it is like living 
in Egypt if you are a Westerner. I have been going to Egypt 
since 1988 and have had the privilege of living there in fairly 
typical, upper-middle class Egyptian neighborhoods (Garden 
City and Zamalek). I purposely chose not to live where most 
Americans live because it felt ‘right’ to me to be where I was. 
A new friend recently conﬁ rmed my impression that something 
‘happens’ to some of us when we go to Egypt—we feel like we 
have ‘come home’. If this happens to you, please recognise 
that you are not alone and enjoy. 
Just the word ‘Egypt’ brings to mind visions of pyramids, 
grand temples, gigantic monuments, mummies and king-
gods, all relics of one of the oldest civilisations in the world. 
To many, it will forever be the ‘land of the Pharaohs’, a place 
where agriculture and advanced mathematics developed. But 
the long reign of the Pharaohs and grand monuments passed 
away nearly 2,000 years ago. Life in Egypt has changed, and 
changed a lot, since the time when grand temples and statues 
were built to worship its king-gods. 
Today, Egypt is a developing North African country of over 
60 million people facing new challenges as it moves through 
the 21st century. Egypt is a land of proud, honourable families, 
each trying to do the same things families do everywhere in 
the world within the conﬁ nes of their government, religion, 
culture and values. Like people everywhere, they concern 
themselves with love, work, family, doing the ‘right’ things and 
having their children grow up to be ‘good’ people. 
As humans, each of us faces the world within the conﬁ nes 
of our culture (that complex mixture of beliefs, behaviours and 
societal rules which tell us what is right and wrong, good and 
bad). Hopefully, this book will bring greater understanding 
of the Egyptian culture: of ‘who’ modern Egyptians are, how 
they view life from their cultural perspective, and how they 
go about facing challenges in a rapidly changing world. In the 
words of modern Egyptians: Ahlan wa sahlan! (AH-lan wa-SAH-
lan)—Welcome! You are welcomed to Egypt!

vii
Above all, I thank the people of Egypt who are patient with my 
questions, share their lives with me, are kind and generous, 
and who always make me feel welcome. Much of the data 
gathered for this book results from directing two ﬁ eld schools in 
Egypt sponsored by the University of North Texas, Institute of 
Anthropology and the Study Abroad Program. Special thanks to 
Dr David Keitges for helping make these ﬁ eld schools happen. 
Thanks to all my students who went to Egypt with me. Their 
remarkable incidences of culture shock showed me that culture 
shock is not just a long-term response, but one likely to clobber 
even those aware of the phenomenon and who are there for 
short periods. Their questions and observations reminded me 
of what Egypt looks like when you are ‘new’ to its environs, 
no matter how ‘cool’ you think you are. A special thanks to 
Violet Sparks and Michelle Robicheaux for their assistance and 
support throughout the ﬁ eld schools and subsequently. Also, 
a special thanks to Cynthia Talbot for suggesting that I write 
this book, and for her help. 
I would also like to thank my Egyptian and Chinese students 
in Egypt at ESLSCA’s (Ecole Supérieure Libre Des Sciences 
Commerciales et Appliqués), Advanced Management Institute 
in Mohandasin. It is entirely possible that I learned more from 
them about cross-cultural communication than they learned 
from me. 
Over the nearly 20 years of my Egyptian experiences, two 
people have been there with moral support, understanding, 
humour and kindness: Ambassador Hussein El Kamel 
(International Co-operation Senior Advisor, Prime Minister’s 
Cabinet Information and Decision Support Centre) and Mr 
Medhat A-Monem (Egypt’s greatest tour guide. Call Medhat 
on his mobile phone at tel: 012-367-6574). They helped me 
in more ways than I can think to mention and I am forever 
in their debt. 
Thanks to Her Excellency Dr Amal Osman and her staff 
whose hospitality made possible visits to special schools and 
NGOs in Egypt. I especially thank my friends and colleagues 
Mr Mohamed Dahawi; Mrs Riri el-Aasser; Dr Khalid Dahawy; 
Mrs Amany Khalil; Mr Amr Dahawy; Mr Mortada Mohamed; Dr 
Nabil Mansour, Dr Mahmoud M. Amr and Dr Ali ElMaligui.

Finally, in addition to my friend Medhat, three individuals 
especially helped me ‘see’ Egypt from the perspective of those 
who face their own cultural challenges dealing with the various 
culture shocks Westerners exhibit while in Egypt. Thank you

In the US, I would like to thank Jimmy Dunn at InterOz,

from which to design the most informative website about 
Egypt on the Internet (http://www.touregypt.net), but Jimmy 
has done it and maintained it over the years. He is always 
ready to help with information and a contact when I need 
one (he seems to know just about everyone or know how to 
ﬁ nd them in Egypt).
Thanks to all the folks at Marshall Cavendish whom 
I have worked with on this book. Special thanks to Patricia Ng 
for her help with the third edition and to Shova Loh, Jonathan 
Grifﬁ ths, Cheong Yaun Marn and Oh Hwee Yen for their help 
with earlier editions of the book.
My loving family deserves special recognition and the most 
thanks. Throughout it all, they have been there for me and 
it helps.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS
CHAPTER 1

2 CultureShock! Egypt
LIKE MOST PEOPLE, I ENTERED EGYPT BY AIR through the  Cairo airport. 
There are other ways to enter Egypt, of course—by air at 
another airport, by boat or over land. Since most people 
enter through the  Cairo airport, I will devote this arrival 
discussion to that port of entry. Four things come to my mind 
when anyone asks me about my ﬁ rst impressions of Egypt. 
Wherever and however you enter Egypt, your ﬁ rst challenge 
will be to go through customs to get your feet on Egyptian 
soil. You will encounter most of the situations listed below 
no matter how you arrive. 
My First Time
I would be remiss if I didn’t say my very ﬁ rst feeling when arriving in 
Egypt the ﬁ rst time (in 1988) was one of sheer panic—panic at the 
sudden realisation that I did not know how to communicate what I 
needed or wanted. I did not know where to go, what to expect or what 
to do. I did what is normal for an American travelling—I looked for 
a sign with directions. But when I looked around, I didn’t recognise 
(for the most part) any letters or words. Sounds were different. I was 
truly humbled at my ignorance! I felt the way I imagine a child feels 
before they learn to read but after they have ﬁ gured out that the 
symbols they see ‘mean’ something. Of course, there were many 
welcoming Egyptians speaking to me in English (my native language) 
to help me as my feet touched Egyptian ground, but I still remember 
that short moment of unbelievable panic. Egyptians who were total 
strangers made me feel at home and welcome when things around 
me didn’t look familiar! 
(Continued on the next page)

First Impressions
(Continued from previous page)
My second ﬁ rst impression happened on the way into  Cairo 
from the airport. Yes, we really did drive up the wrong side of a 
divided street and no, we did not have lights on even in the darkest 
stretches. My ﬁ rst trip into the city was via a small tour bus. It was 
night, so the lights remained on in the bus as we went into town. 
The bus was fantastic, though I felt that I was a rolling exhibit. As 
beautiful, comfortable and modern as the tour buses are, I truthfully 
never grew to like them because I wanted to be on the ground or 
pavement with real people. Of course, the other important thing 
about that initiation was my ﬁ rst experience with Egyptian driving. 
Coming from a country where one doesn’t veer from one’s trafﬁ c 
line without signalling and where one never ‘creates’ a new trafﬁ c 
lane just because there is room to do so, I was more than amazed 
by the bus’s manoeuverability. 
My third ﬁ rst impression was astonishment at how incredibly busy 
the city was.  Cairo is alive and teeming with excitement any time of 
day or night. I was not prepared for the mass of people out-and-about, 
the congested trafﬁ c, nor the noise—the sheer vivacité that is  Cairo. 
I loved it, but it was deﬁ nitely new for me. 
Finally, the smog was overwhelming and gave the city a burned 
diesel odour that permeated even the most inviting food or ﬂ ower 
smells. What I really didn’t like was blowing my nose and ﬁ nding a 
blackened tissue from the air particles. The good news is that, since 
1988 when I ﬁ rst travelled to Egypt, the air quality has improved 
considerably. I personally believe that a lot of the improvement 
resulted from switching from leaded to unleaded gasoline. However, 
there are still times when the smoke or smog is so bad you cannot 
see clearly across the river in  Cairo.
If you are not accustomed to travelling in the Middle East, 
you may ﬁ nd it surprising if your plane does not pull into a 
gateway at the terminal. Some do and some do not. In many 
cases, the aircraft will park and passengers will disembark 
from a remote spot on the tarmac. Buses will arrive to shuttle 
passengers to the terminal. Once you are in the terminal, 
you are in a secured area and queue to go through customs. 
Immediately upon arrival, you will be escorted to the 
customs area where your passport and visa will be examined 
and stamped. 
After clearing  customs, you will go to another secured 
area for baggage claim. Before leaving the baggage claim 
area, you must go through one other checkpoint prior to 
admittance to Egypt. At this juncture, you will be asked about 

4 CultureShock! Egypt
certain items you are bringing into the country. Occasionally, 
bags are searched. Personal effects and cameras are exempt 
from duty, but items such as electronic equipment and video 
cameras should be declared and listed on a Form D. If you 
lose them during your visit, it will be assumed they were 
‘sold’ when you leave the country (unless you have police 
documentation of the theft). In this case, you will be required 
to pay 100 per cent duty. On items with a high resale value, 
you may be required to pay a deposit, which is refundable on 
departure from Egypt. If, for some reason, Customs insists 
on impounding any of your personal goods, get a receipt and 
contact your Consulate as soon as possible. That being said, 
I have taken my laptop computer into the country several 
times and have never been asked to declare it; perhaps next 
time. If there are speciﬁ c items that need to be declared, you 
will be notiﬁ ed by ofﬁ cials at the airport.  I read somewhere 
that you should be sure to keep all money-change receipts 
and the custom Form D or other declaration forms (ﬁ lled in 
upon arrival) as you may be required to present them upon 
departure. I have no idea why nor have I ever had anyone 
ask me for money-change receipts. 
On your way through the airport, you will pass several 
banks or money exchanges. Unlike many other countries, the 
exchange rate you get at airport banks will be comparable 
to that elsewhere, so if you need to, exchange money into 
Egyptian pounds (E£) at the airport. If you prefer, you can 
wait to exchange money at your hotel or a bank near to your 
lodgings. Most taxi drivers will take major foreign currencies, 
as will baggage handlers, because they can now easily 
exchange them into Egyptian pounds. Hard currencies are 
at a premium throughout the country, so Euros or US dollars 
are greatly appreciated. However, you are likely to pay more 
for the service using foreign currency than you would if you 
tipped in Egyptian pounds—I think this is simply because 
you are still ‘thinking’ in your native language and customs 
rather than switching to Egyptian ones. 
Do not be surprised, when you ﬁ nally walk out onto the 
pavement, to ﬁ nd numerous men running towards you and 
grabbing your bags. No matter how many times I go there, 

5
First Impressions
I have not been totally successful at stopping this. This is 
your ﬁ rst experience with what is fondly termed ‘running 
the gauntlet’. Sometimes two or more people will seemingly 
ﬁ ght over which one carries which bag, all the time yelling 
at one another in a language which you don’t understand 
(unless you came to Egypt well prepared with a knowledge 
of Arabic). Each will try to take you to a special taxi driver 
that will undoubtedly give you the ‘best price, no problem’. 
The important thing to remember is to negotiate the price 
before you get into the taxi and before you let someone store 
your bags in the taxi. This can be difﬁ cult because you are 
tired, confused and in the midst of a torrent of people all 
trying to get your attention and ‘help’ you. It can give you 
the feeling of being a morsel of food on a hot summer’s day 
with ﬂ ies circling. Just hold your ground and continue saying 
‘la’—the Arabic word for ‘no’—if you don’t want assistance. 
Be prepared, however, to pay a tip for any service you accept 
(and sometimes even if you don’t want help, they will just 
pick up your bags and run—and will still expect a tip). This 
is where having small Egyptian notes can come in handy. 
The going rate is about E£ 1–2 per bag. 

6 CultureShock! Egypt
Tipping Tip
Do not tip in foreign coins as these cannot be exchanged. If you 
are curious about the current ofﬁ cial exchange rates, you can 
check your currency against the Egyptian pound at: 
 http://ﬁ nance.yahoo.com/currency
 http://www.xe.com/ucc/ 
Should you need additional assistance, you can summon 
a tourist policeman in an emergency (you should also tip the 
policeman if he gives assistance).
At some point following your arrival (whether by 
air, sea or land), you will begin to notice many men in 
uniforms, frequently with assault weapons. A heavy 
security presence is apparent to travellers throughout the 
country, though it is clearly more apparent at some times 
and places than others. Shortly after the September 11 
tragedy in 2001 at the World Trade Centers in New York, 
I needed a little break, so left  Cairo for a short cruise in 
Upper Egypt. To me, security was strong, but did not look 
abnormally high. However, a South African lady I chanced 
to meet along the way, quietly pulled me aside and asked 
if this was ‘normal’. Since it did not look unusual to me, I 
assured her that it was normal, just something she might 
not be used to. You will see uniformed guards everywhere in 
Egypt—on the streets, at all monuments, frequently at hotel 
entrances—basically everywhere. Some are police, some 
are tourist police, some represent various branches of the 
armed services, and some are special security forces. After a 
while, you will be able to notice if something looks ‘unusual’. 
There is a standard joke in Egypt, which says that most of the 
people you see with assault weapons do not have bullets or 
if they do, the bullets don’t ﬁ t the gun. I have never trusted 
this witticism, especially since it would be totally impossible 
to tell which is which even if it is true. Your best bet is to 
assume that if there is a gun, the holder has ammunition 
that ﬁ ts the weapon. 
If you are coming from a country where the presence of 
armed guards on every street is uncommon, the sight of so 

7
First Impressions
many guns will probably be a little unsettling until you get 
used to it. Also, if you are accustomed to going wherever 
you like in some buildings, you will quickly ﬁ nd that entry 
into many areas is restricted and armed guards are there 
to ensure security. I also ﬁ nd that security presence differs 
from town-to-town.
Occasionally, you will ﬁ nd trafﬁ c is at a total standstill 
because an important dignitary is going somewhere. Troops 
line the streets in riot gear in these situations. Occasionally, 
armoured personnel carriers with troops wearing riot gear 
sit at strategic locations. Their presence depends on several 
circumstances, for example, where you are in Egypt or special 
circumstances of which you may not be aware. New residents 
and visitors may be particularly alarmed to see an armoured 
personnel carrier outside their hotel. The word on the street 
is that ‘they are there for your protection’. Frankly, sometimes 
it seems for show, a way to show tourists that they are on top 
of everything. In  Alexandria, for example, the tourist police 
seem to have less to do than in other cities, and always make 
a big show. Other times, extra protection is there because of 
a potential threat of which you are not aware, and they truly 
are there as a deterrent and for protection. Assume they are 
there for your protection.
A Word of Caution
Just a reminder, there are restrictions on photographing military 
personnel and sites, bridges and canals, including the  Suez Canal. 
Egyptian authorities may broadly interpret these restrictions to 
include other potentially sensitive structures, such as embassies, other 
public buildings with international associations and some religious 
ediﬁ ces. It is generally recommended that visitors should also refrain 
from taking photographs of any uniformed personnel. 
Personally, I know of one situation where a foreigner was too 
close to a military site while taking pictures of trains or a bridge 
(it was never totally clear what the object of the photo was), was 
observed by police and arrested. The reason I am telling you is that 
it is sometimes very difﬁ cult to tell what is allowed and what is not 
allowed. As a general rule (this is deﬁ nitely not an absolute), if you 
are trying to take a picture where it is not allowed, someone will tell 
you. If in doubt, you may ask—just be careful approaching anyone 
wearing a uniform unless it is clearly marked ‘tourist police’. 

8 CultureShock! Egypt
On the way out of the airport, don’t forget to stop by the 
 duty-free stores, both inside and outside the Customs area of 
the airport, if you want any of the items sold there while you 
are in Egypt. Otherwise, you have 24 hours to go to one of 
the duty-free stores after you get into Egypt. For those who 
smoke imported cigarettes, they are sometimes cheaper at 
the duty-free outlets. If you want to have imported liquor 
while you are in Egypt, it is best bought by the bottle at duty-
free. Otherwise, you can only get it by the drink at speciﬁ c 
locations and it is very expensive. The local spirits stores 
typically sell products that have been bottled and labelled 
to look almost exactly like imported liquors. It is hard to say 
just what is actually in those bottles without a chemist, but in 
addition to appropriate food colouring, some are rumoured 
to contain formaldehyde and perfume. You probably want 
to avoid these products. 

‘For anyone who sees Egypt, without having heard a word 
about it before, must perceive, if he has only common 
powers of observation, that the Egypt to which the Greeks 
go in their ships is an acquired country, the gift of the river.’
—Herodotus, Book II
A TOUR OF EGYPT
CHAPTER 2

10 CultureShock! Egypt
EGYPT IS AN INCONGRUOUS MIXTURE OF OLD AND NEW. Considering that 
Egypt has one of the oldest civilisations known to the world 
and that it is home to the last standing Seven Wonders of the 
Ancient World, it is not surprising that just the word ‘Egypt’ 
fascinates and intrigues people. Looking around Egypt, one 
minute you think you have walked through a time warp 
straight into Biblical times; ten minutes later, you may find 
yourself negotiating a high stakes deal in an ultra-modern 
meeting room, teeming with skilled entrepreneurs dressed 
in the latest European fashion. Intertwined with remnants 
of time-worn lifestyles, Egypt is a nation seeking its place 
in a modern world of computers, telecommunications and 
banking. Lifestyles are so intermixed that it is difficult to 
define where one lifestyle ends and another begins. A 
booming tourist industry that introduces Egyptians to the 
world adds another dimension to the amalgam of lifestyles. 
While many Egyptians remain insulated from direct contact 
with outside forces, few are far from its influence. Most 
tourists remain somewhat isolated from real Egyptian life. 
They stay principally in modern facilities away from the 
poverty and exhausted infrastructure. Rarely do tourists 
experience the everyday struggles to move into the ‘modern’ 
age that affects the lives of Egypt’s recently estimated (2010) 
80 million people. 
The modern Arab Republic of Egypt identifies itself as 
an Arab nation, though its people are ‘Arabised’ rather than

true Arabs. The distinction between Arab and Egyptian 
is well recognised among Egyptians and Arabs alike. 
Egypt perceives its role in the development of the Middle 
East as one of leadership, peacemaker and negotiator. 
Egypt’s rich educational heritage gives it a valuable 
export—skilled labour. Many Egyptian professionals, 
doctors, nurses, engineers, teachers and agricultural 
specialists work in other Arab countries. They make 
significant contributions to development throughout the 
Arab world and bolster Egypt’s economy by sending wages 
back home. 
In the following chapters, I will try to add order to seeming 
inconsistencies in Egyptian life. First, however, we must lay 
the groundwork by briefly describing the country, giving a 
few statistics, and pointing out some of Egypt’s most pressing 
developmental concerns.
 GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Egypt is located on the far north-east corner of the African 
continent. It is about the size of Texas, Arkansas and 
Oklahoma, combined, or 1,001,450 sq km (386,662 sq 
miles). Egypt provides the gateway connecting the African 
continent with the huge Eurasian land mass. It controls the 
strategically and economically important  Suez Canal and 
 Sinai Peninsula. The Mediterranean Sea marks the northern 
boundary of Egypt. The Gaza Strip, Israel and the Red Sea 
border it on the east; the Sudan stretches across the southern 
border; and Libya lies west of Egypt’s borders. 
Egypt is a vast desert plateau interrupted by the   Nile 
River valley and delta. Topographically, it is almost entirely 
desolate, with barren hills and mountains in the east and 
along the  Nile. The  Western Desert comprises slightly 
over two-thirds of the nation. The  Sinai Peninsula and the 
 Eastern Desert add another six and twenty-three per cent, 
respectively, to the desert landscape. The result is that less 
than four per cent of the total area is in the arable  Nile Valley 
and Delta. When viewed with this perspective, it is easy to 
see why Herodotus so aptly noted in the 5th century BCE that 
Egypt is the “gift of the  Nile”. Like an emerald green ribbon, 

12 CultureShock! Egypt
the  Nile flows 880 km (550 miles) from Egypt’s southern 
border with Sudan, through its desert heartland to the 
Mediterranean bringing life to an otherwise desert wilderness. 
The  Nile forms at Khartoum, Sudan, when the Blue  Nile and 
White  Nile (whose sources are deep in Africa) converge. It 
separates the Western (Libyan) Desert from the Eastern 
(Arabian) Desert. As a result of its unique geographical 
configuration, most Egyptians live in the Delta and along the 
narrow irrigated strip on either side of the  Nile. 
Another prominent geographical feature is  Lake Nasser, an 
artificial lake resulting from the construction of the  Aswan 
High Dam. Historically, the  Nile flooded annually, depositing 
needed silt all along the  Nile’s path. Whether Egypt had a high 
or low flood year depended on rainfall in other parts of Africa. 
Early in the 1900s, the first Aswan Dam (now below the 
High Dam) was completed to try to control annual flooding. 
It was subsequently raised, but still could not control the 
 Nile’s raging flood waters. Only after completion of the 
 Aswan High Dam in the 1970s was the  Nile finally tamed. 
The High Dam was built not only to control flooding, but 
to increase arable land and generate electricity to facilitate 
Traditional irrigation methods include the use of water wheels, like the one 
shown here, to lift water to crop ﬁ elds. Donkeys and camels are still used as 
beasts of burden. 

13

Egypt’s move toward modernity. Considerable international 
controversy resulted from the former Soviet Union’s financing 
of the dam after refusal by Western institutions. The Dam 
became operational in 1971 and by 1974, revenues had 
exceeded construction costs. Subsequently, increasing costs 
of reclamation have offset the value of providing a regulated 
flow of  Nile water for irrigation. 
Though it is ecologically 
controversial for several reasons, 
the High Dam rapidly increased 
modernisation throughout Egypt 
by providing an accessible source 
for electrical generation. Older 
people will tell you that food 
just doesn’t taste as good as it 
used to when the  Nile flooded. 
This is probably a result of 
the subsequent need to use 
chemical fertilisers that were 
never needed when rich soil was 
deposited annually. 
Culturally, construction of 
the dam was also controversial. 
As a result of rising water in  Lake Nasser, numerous small 
Nubian villages had to be relocated north of the dam. 
Historians and archaeologists worldwide were up in arms 
because many ancient ruins could not be saved from the 
rising waters. Seemingly superhuman international efforts 
saved some historical sites by rapid excavations or by 
systematically disassembling, moving and reconstructing 
them at a new site, such as the great temples at  Abu Simbel. 
Increasing desertification and prolonged droughts in the 
Sahel and Sahara Deserts seriously threaten Egyptian water 
management and use of its water resources. In 1987,  Lake 
Nasser’s water level was at its lowest since the lake filled—at 
a level actually below the amount needed to run the Aswan 
power station. 
Oil and natural gas are two of Egypt’s most important 
natural resources although their quantities do not compare 
 Schistosomiasis
After building the high dam, 
one interesting health result has 
been an increase in an ancient 
disease named schistosomiasis 
or Bilharzia (named after 
the German-born scientist, 
Theodor Bilharz, whose work 
in intestinal parasites rewarded 
him with a prestigious position 
at the Kasr el Aïny Faculty of 
Medicine in  Cairo until his death 
in 1862). Apparently, the annual 
ﬂ ooding washed away the snails 
that host the parasite eggs, thus, 
annually removing some of the 
means of infection.

14 CultureShock! Egypt
with the high reserves of their neighbours on the Arabian 
Peninsula. Proven reserves are estimated to be some 
6.2 billion barrels of oil with some 500 cubic metres of natural 
gas reserves. Recent oil discoveries in the Gulf of Suez and the 
 Western Desert suggest these figures will increase. Production 
of natural gas is sufficient to meet domestic needs and 
provides a surplus for export. Egypt’s other natural resources 
include iron ore, phosphates, manganese, limestone, gypsum, 
talc, asbestos, lead and zinc.
 ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
Egypt’s environmental problems revolve around a rapidly 
increasing population, poverty, ignorance and historic lack of 
concern for environmental integrity. The current government 
is seeking measures to clean up Egypt’s massive environmental 
problems, but many traditions are deeply ingrained and the 
existing infrastructure is severely in need of modernisation, so 
progress is extremely slow. Experimental projects look for new 
ways to maintain environmental integrity while allowing for 
productive growth. 
Of course, the fact that much of the land is effectively 
uninhabitable presents other environmental challenges—like 
how to develop sustainable desert reclamation. On top of 
this, add the fact that the little agricultural land that does 
exist throughout the country is being lost to urbanisation. 
Oil pollution and new tourist sites along the Red Sea 
threaten Egypt’s coral reefs, beaches and marine habitats. 
Natural fresh water resources away from the  Nile (the only 
perennial fresh water source) are very limited although recent 
underground finds in the  Western Desert may provide new 
sources for limited agricultural development. Agricultural 
pesticides, raw sewage and industrial effluents further 
threaten water supplies.
Natural environmental hazards include earthquakes and 
occasional flash floods and landslides, along with wind and 
dust storms. A particularly vicious hot, driving sandstorm, 
called a khamsin, occurs in spring, making the air thick with 
sand, limiting visibility and causing breathing difficulties 
among many.

 REGIONS OF EGYPT
For planning purposes, the Egyptian government divided 
the country into seven major regions: Upper Egypt, Middle 
Egypt (Assiut); North of Upper Egypt; Greater Cairo; the 
Canal;  Alexandria and Matrouh; and the Delta. Local tradition 
generally recognises slightly different regional classifications, 
so I will stick with local tradition, while recognising planning 
needs may require different categories.
Lower Egypt and the Delta 
The terms Lower and Upper Egypt, which are used today, 
have their roots in ancient tradition before the first unification 
of the two regions of Egypt around 3200 BCE. Based on 
contemporary maps and global logic, one would expect 
Upper Egypt to be in the north. However, to ancient Egyptians 
reality revolved around the perceptions of the life-giving  Nile 
whose source lies deep in the heart of the African continent 
(the  Nile flows south to north). Since their world revolved 
around the flow of the  Nile, quite logically, Upper Egypt 
was in the south and Lower Egypt was in the north. These 
designations are still in use today.
Lower Egypt begins at  Cairo and ends at the boundaries of 
the Mediterranean Sea. Just north of  Cairo, the  Nile divides 
into its two tributaries, the Damietta and the Rosetta, forming 
the huge Delta alluvial flood plain. Extensive networks of 
canals and channel irrigation provide the Delta area with 
needed water resources for cultivation. The area provided 
such high crop yields that in Roman times, Egypt became 
known as the “bread basket of the world”. Now, Egypt is 
no longer able to be self-sufficient in its food production. 
Throughout the country, maintenance of high agricultural 
yields depends heavily on the use of agrochemical products. 
The larger, more modern farms tend to be located in Lower 
Egypt. Most of the cotton, for which Egypt is famous, grows 
in this region.
The moment you leave the Delta proper, you are back 
in the desert again. Desert extends west from the Delta 
and eastward, turning into salt marshes along the eastern 
sea coasts. Desert reclamation farms in Upper Egypt have 

16 CultureShock! Egypt
slightly increased the amount of arable land in the area. Local 
entrepreneurs have begun developing small fish farms along 
the shores of the Mediterranean near  Port Said. One new 
corporation, using modern scientific methods, developed 
an experimental shrimp farm that was quite successful. This 
ecologically sensitive project, designed to be a long-term 
sustainable enterprise, is now being expanded to provide a 
vital new use for salty lowlands. 
Upper Egypt 
The area from  Cairo south to the Sudanese border is called 
Upper Egypt. The green area from  Cairo south is mostly a 
narrow band of irrigated land along the  Nile’s shores, rarely 
extending in breadth for more than a couple of miles. The 
 Western Desert (Libyan Desert) regions of Upper Egypt have 
begun to experience some development. A lot of government 
attention is presently directed to the new cities with special 
emphasis given to the master development plans for the 
‘New Valley’ in southern Egypt. The four New Valley oases 
are situated along a dead, prehistoric branch of the  Nile. They 
depend on springs and wells tapping into water under the 
desert. The four oases are isolated from each other but may 
be reached via a loop road starting at one end in  Cairo and 
ending in  Luxor. The government has undertaken several 
agricultural initiatives to encourage settlement near oases 
and desert reclamation projects. 
In 2001, a great archaeological find was announced in 
Bahariya Oasis, about 380 km (236.1 miles) west of the 
 Pyramids at Giza. The tombs in the Valley of the Golden 
Mummies were discovered in 1996 when a donkey, ridden 
by an antiquities guard along the dusty road to the small town 
of Farafra, tripped after its leg slipped into a hole leading to 
the entrance. An entire undisturbed forgotten population of 
mummies in porcelain caskets or canvas wrappings were 
found. The mummies are covered with a thin layer of gold 
and wear gypsum masks. Sumptuous gilded death masks 
depict lifelike faces of real people, rather than stereotypical 
images. It is estimated that as many as 10,000 mummies 
may be found once the necropolis is totally excavated. 

17
A Tour of Egypt
Farming in Upper Egypt generally tends to be small scale, 
often family subsistence farming. The landscape of Upper 
Egypt is dotted all along the  Nile with small traditional 
villages and several small- to medium-sized cities. Large 
villas, markets, shops, streetlights, several universities, small 
hospitals and large apartment blocks distinguish the urban 
areas from the poorer  fellahin (small-scale farmers) and 
Nubian villages. 
Middle Egypt 
Although the whole area from  Cairo south is called Upper 
Egypt, many also recognise a distinction in the centre of the 
country called Middle Egypt which includes the area around 
the governorates of Minya, Assiut, and Qena (Qina). However, 
most people from this area of Egypt also consider themselves 
to be Upper Egyptians.

not-so-visited, but very interesting, Middle Kingdom site at Bani

 Suez Canal 
Located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa, the 
 Suez Canal is one of the world’s most important artificial 
waterways. It connects the Indian Ocean via the Red Sea 
and the Gulf of Suez with the Mediterranean Sea. The city 
of  Port Said is located at the northern terminus on the 
Mediterranean Sea. Ismailia, the administrative headquarters, 
is about midway through the Canal. The southern terminus 
is at the city of Suez. 
Prior to the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, the 
 Suez Canal held centre stage in several confrontations. The 
Canal provides the single largest source of foreign currency 
in Egypt’s economy. Going through the Canal shortens 
the distance from the Far East to Europe by 8,047 km 
(5,000 miles), thus vitally affecting commercial shipping. 

18 CultureShock! Egypt
Built by French companies starting in 1859, it opened on 
17 November 1869. Great Britain acquired the Canal in 
1875 and Egypt subsequently nationalised it in the 1950s. A 
sea level artificial waterway with no locks, its total length is 
169 km (105 miles) including approach channels. Renovation 
of the Canal widened its narrowest point to 60 m (196 ft) 
and increased its depth to 16 m (53 ft) to accommodate 
larger ships. 
Sinai and Red Sea 
The  Sinai Peninsula is the place to go for the newest in 
Egyptian beach resorts. Other than that, it is mostly a barren 
desert wilderness with some oil rigs, military outposts and 
a few historic sites. It is strategically important because it 
is the only land bridge connecting Africa with the Eurasian 
continent and provides the eastern boundary to the  Suez 
Canal. The Sinai is economically important because it 
contains much of Egypt’s proven oil and gas reserves. A 
few Bedouin (desert nomads) live in the area, but other 
than that there is little habitation except in the developing 
tourist villages. Projects are in development to provide a 
fresh water source for more desert reclamation agriculture. 
This tanker makes its way through the  Suez Canal, the artiﬁ cal waterway 
which brings in most of the foreign currency for Egypt. The Canal has 
helped to revolutionise shipping by shortening the distance from Europe 
to the Far East.

MAJOR CITIES
 Cairo ( al-Qahirah) 
Cairo, known as  al-Qahirah in Arabic, throbs and pulsates 
with life 24 hours a day! Even those of us who like small-
town living cannot fail to be captivated by her. Teeming with 
approximately 7.8 million people in the metropolitan area, 
plus 10 million people just outside Cairo. Cairo writhes as 
she strains to burst at the seams. The metropolitan area’s 
population ranks 16th in the world. For comparison, Cairo 
proper has approximately the same population as New 
York City or London or Beijing. The population density is 
approximately 25,000 persons per square kilometre in 
Cairo (more than twice as dense as greater London and two 
and-one-half times as dense as New York City, for example). 
East and West butt each other face-to-face in modern Cairo. 
Few places in the modern world exhibit the inherent clash 
between the ancient and modern worlds seen in Cairo. 
The Red Sea coast is rugged and scenic. It also has a very good highway. 

20 CultureShock! Egypt
To Egyptians, Cairo is Egypt (Misr), the Mother of the World, 
and ‘the victorious’.
The site of Egypt’s capital (though not the name) can 
be traced back over 6,000 years. Around 4225 BC, on the 
western bank of the  Nile a few miles north of present-day 
Cairo, East Delta people built the first capital of a united 
Egypt. Today, the oldest reminders of ancient Cairo are found 
in Old Cairo. 
Getting oriented to the maze of Cairo is not as difficult as 
it seems at first glance. First, get yourself a good map and 
orient yourself to the major sections of the city. Start at the 
centre— Tahrir Square ( Midan Tahrir)—and work your way 
out moving clockwise. 
Online Maps
A good place for free, online maps is at the TourEgypt site: 
http://www.touregypt.net/maps.htm. 
I have found these maps to be clear and most print well. In fact,

maintained by Jimmy Dunn at InterOz, is the absolute best site 
to visit ﬁ rst for most kinds of information about Egypt from hotel 
reviews to feature articles about antiquities.

A Tour of Egypt
North 
From  Midan Tahrir, go north. Here you will find the 
neighbourhoods of Bulaq and Shubra. When you reach 
Ramses station, this is the boundary between Bulaq and 
Shubra. Bulaq was the old industrial centre of Cairo; however 
industrialisation subsequently moved northward to Shubra. A 
very traditional area of Cairo, today’s Bulaq is one of the most 
densely populated districts of Cairo. It is also noteworthy 
because this area bred much of the recent Islamic unrest.
East
North-east from  Midan Tahrir, you will find Midan Talaat 
Harb and Ezbekiya Gardens, an area full of Western-
style shops and inexpensive, old hotels. Further east, 
you will find the area known as Islamic Cairo. This area 
encompasses the Citadel, some of Cairo’s poorer districts, 
and a couple of important medieval neighbourhoods. 
Continuing east and south, you will find the Cities of the 
Dead. In the Cities of the Dead (huge necropolises), living 
inhabitants scurry through the vast array of mausoleums 
rearing children among the funeral vaults. Moving north-east 
from here, you will reach Heliopolis (where the airport is 
located), a wealthy district also known as New Cairo. 
South
Directly south of  Midan Tahrir is Garden City, home to 
embassies and expensive residences. From Garden City, 
bridges cross the  Nile to Roda Island. On Roda Island 
you will find Manyal Palace, Cairo University’s Faculty of 
Medicine, the Old and New Qasr al-Eini Hospitals, and the 
Nilometer. The sprawling suburbs of Old Cairo continue south 
from Garden City, encompassing the small area known as 
Coptic Cairo. The next major district moving southward is 
Maadi. A wealthy district, expatriates tend to congregate in 
this area.
West
Crossing Al-Tahrir Bridge, you come to Gezira Island in the 
middle of the  Nile. The residential suburb of Gezira occupies 

22 CultureShock! Egypt
the southern part of the island. Gezira is home to Cairo’s 
elite, including some leading diplomats. On the northern 
half of Gezira Island is Zamalek, another expensive area 
of town which houses embassies and modern apartment 
buildings. The famous Gezira Sporting Club connects the 
two suburbs.
Across the river from Gezira are several districts on 
the west bank of the  Nile. The southernmost district is 
Giza (home of the Great  Pyramids), which stretches to the 
edge of the desert. Just north of Giza is Doqqi (Dokki). Doqqi 
houses the rest of Cairo University, and several districts 
including Imbaba (old home of Cairo’s camel market). The 
camel market has now moved to Birqash about 32 km (20 
miles) north-west of the city.
The majestic Sphinx stands guard on the Giza plateau. The horseback riders 
on the nearby ridge give you an idea of the immense proportion of the last 
remaining Seven Wonders of the World.

23
A Tour of Egypt
 Alexandria ( al-Iskandariya) 
Beautiful Alexandria! After conquering Egypt south to 
Memphis in 332 BC, Alexander the Great (Iskandar al-Akbar) 
chose the site of current-day Alexandria to be the capital 
of his empire. What became known as Alexandria ( al-
Iskandariya in Arabic) was positioned on the west side of 
the  Nile Delta at the site of a small fishing village. Alexandria 
was envisioned by Alexander to be not only the political 
and economic centre of his empire, but a naval base and 
great trading port. Alexandria was nearly destroyed when 
the Arabs captured it in AD 642. An earthquake devastated 
the famous lighthouse in 1324, another of the Seven 
Wonders of the Ancient World built on the Island of Pharos 
in 280 BC.
Alexandria was well designed with streets crossing at right 
angles. It is wide, stretching some 20 km (12 miles) from west 
to east. The hub of Alexandria is the Midan Saad Zaghloul, 
which runs to the waterfront. Just to the east is the Midan 
The Corniche winds along  Alexandria’s irregular coastline.

Ramla, where Ramla station is located. Alexandria’s culture 
has many distinct Mediterranean influences such as in the 
European quarter as well as its characteristically Egyptian 
areas. The bulk of Egypt’s foreign trade passes through 
its port. The population of Alexandria currently exceeds 
two million.
 Luxor
Located in Upper Egypt, the contemporary city of Luxor 
was built on the ancient site of Thebes. Luxor now has a 
population of around 200,000 persons, most of whom seem 
to be rather sagacious hawkers and vendors working in the 
tourist industry. Here, modern Egyptians combine an exotic 
history with modern commercialism. Hordes of foreign 
visitors throng the streets, even in the scorching summer 
heat. What most people think of as Luxor is actually three 
distinct areas: Luxor city (including Luxor temple), the village 
of Karnak, and the necropolis of ancient Thebes. The sheer 
magnitude of Karnak’s intricate temple complex boggles 
the mind. On the west Bank of the  Nile, directly across from 
Luxor, the famous  Valley of the Kings, Valley of the Queens, 

25
A Tour of Egypt
Temple of  Hatshepsut, and many finely decorated tombs 
draw eager tourists anxious to explore the remnants of 
Egypt’s intricate funerary practices. Howard Carter’s 1922 
discovery of King  Tutankhamun’s ( King  Tut’s) tomb filled 
with treasures still remains one of the most internationally 
celebrated sites to visit.

 Aswan 
Gateway to Africa, frontier city and prosperous market at 
the crossroads of the ancient caravan trade route, Aswan is 
undoubtedly one of my favourite places in Egypt. It has a 
sleepy, almost tranquil atmosphere, in contrast to the rest 
of Egypt. It is here that the  Nile is the most enchanting and 
magical as it weaves through the mass of boulders and 
small islands, glistening sparkles dancing off its surface.

26 CultureShock! Egypt
The culture here is a fascinating mixture of Egyptian and 
Nubian heritages. Aswan is located on the eastern shores of 
the  Nile about 9.6 km (6 miles) north of the First Cataract, 
one of the six major rock outcroppings situated between 
Aswan and Khartoum. A ‘must-see’ in Aswan is the beautiful 
Nubian Museum, (Nubia means ‘gold’) completed in 1997, 
which displays thousands of antiquities that would have 
been lost under the waters of  Lake Nasser had not a major 
international effort salavaged them during the 1960s and 
1970s. Speaking of the international effort to save Nubian 
artifacts, the UNESCO-supported effort to move the Temple 
of  Ramses II and Temple of Queen Nefitari dedicated to 
Hathor above the flood waters of  Lake Nasser is located 
280 km (174 miles) south of Aswan. During the salvage 
operation which began in 1964 and continued until 1968, 
the two temples were dismantled and raised over 60 metres 
up the sandstone cliff where they had been built more than 
3,000 years before. 
 ANCIENT AND RECENT PAST
A minimal understanding of Egypt’s ancient and recent past 
is useful to the foreign resident for several reasons. First, the 
major issues affecting contemporary Egyptians, and thus 
anyone living in the country, have roots in her history. This 
is especially true when you consider that tourism is one of 
Egypt’s top economic producers. Second, it is impossible 
to go down any street in Egypt without some kind of 
recognition of her ancient glory as one of the five centres 
in the world where civilisation developed. Third, ancient 
Egypt’s monuments, temples, mosques, monasteries and 
pyramids provide the basis for a substantial portion of her 
current economy. For a short summary of Middle Eastern 
dynamics and history, see the work by Spencer listed at the 
end of this book, which served as the source of much of the 
recent historical information included in this chapter.
The accomplishments of the ancients defy description. 
Words like ‘awe-inspiring’ or ‘incredible’ or ‘spectacular’ 
cannot come close to describing the emotions running 
rampant through anyone confronted with his or her first

view of the great Hypostyle Hall of Karnak or the Great 
Pyramid of Khufu. No matter how hard you try to snap a 
photo that shows what you see, that feeling of being small 
and inconsequential eludes the camera’s eye. Underlying 
the sheer majesty of Egypt’s megalithic monuments is the 
inevitable acknowledgement of the powerful political and 
social mechanisms that must surely have been in place 
to organise such gargantuan projects. You cannot view 
monuments like the  Pyramids, the  Valley of the Kings, 
or the Temple of Karnak without humility and without 
recognising Egypt’s contribution to the development of all 
human society. 
That being said, I do not intend to write a description 
of monuments nor an in-depth diatribe on Egypt’s history. 
Instead, I will highlight only the main eras recognised in 
Egyptian history. If you are interested in a comprehensive 
treatment of Egyptian history or prehistory, start with the 
works listed at the end of this book and work your way 
forward through the myriad of tomes on the subject. 
 Predynastic and Dynastic History
People were living throughout the  Nile valley for several 
thousand years before Egypt as we know it became a unified

A Tour of Egypt
state. This is generally termed the prehistoric, archaic, and 
Predynastic periods of Egyptian history. The Predynastic 
period lasted from about 3150–3050 BC. By around 3150 BC, 
highly stratified states existed in the two separate kingdoms 
of Upper and Lower Egypt. The boundaries were pretty 
much as recognised today. Upper Egypt constituted the area 
from the beginning of the Delta southward, whereas Lower 
Egypt covered the Delta region. Just as settled village life 
was inextricably tied to the narrow, elongated fertile strip 
along the  Nile, the river also provided the avenue for traffic 
and communication. 
Most of Egypt’s outstanding monuments were constructed 
during her Pharaonic period. Egyptian dynastic history 
reckons that Egypt became a unified kingdom at about 
3150 BC when King Menes (Narmer) succeeded in unifying 
Upper and Lower Egypt. There is no historical record of 
King Menes who placed his capital at Memphis about 40 km 
(25 miles) south of current-day  Cairo. Some think the 
unification credited to Menes may be more a symbolic 
than a political act. However, Egypt’s initial unification 
appears to have lasted through the end of the Old Kingdom 
(ca 2575–2150 BC).
Egypt’s most enduring icon, the Great  Pyramids, are a legacy of the 
Pharaonic era.

30 CultureShock! Egypt
In any event, the unity of Egypt seems to have been 
shattered during the First Intermediate Period (ca 2150 
–2040 BC) which lasted about 100 years. During this time, the 
central power of the king broke down. Though nominally in 
service to the pharaoh, nomarchs (rulers of individual nomes 
or divisions of Egypt) operated virtually independently from 
central rule. 
The anarchy of the First Intermediate Period was 
followed by a period of restored order under the Pharaoh 
Mentuhotep I or II (some controversy as to which one). This 
period was called the Middle Kingdom (ca 2040–1783 BC). 
Mentuhotep consolidated the administrative power of Egypt 
at Thebes (modern  Luxor). Although the seat of political 
power shifted on several occasions throughout Egyptian 
history, from the Middle Kingdom onwards, religious 
influence emanated from Thebes. The pharaohs of the Middle 
Kingdom were able once again to institute major architectural 
projects, which had lapsed during the First Intermediate 
Period. By the last 50 years of the Middle Kingdom, once 
again central authority gradually waned.
The Second Intermediate Period lasted nearly 200 years 
(ca 1783–1550 BC). Somewhere around 1663 BC, Egypt was 
invaded by a group of somewhat mysterious people known 
as the Hyksos. The term ‘Hyksos’ comes from the Greek 
meaning “rulers over foreign 
lands”. It is not totally clear 
exactly who the Hyksos were, but 
they were apparently of Asiatic 
origin, perhaps from Turkey. 
Some activities of the Hyksos are 
very confusing. Even though they 
continued to tolerate legitimate 
Egyptian kings, they apparently 
desecrated monuments and 
reduced major landowners to 
poverty. However, importantly,

weapon for Egyptian warriors. 
The Hyksos were eventually forced out of Egypt around 
1550 BC, which commences the period termed the New 
Kingdom. The New Kingdom lasted some 500 years during 
which time Egyptian dominance reigned throughout the 
region. In popular terms, the New Kingdom is synonymous 
with the Egypt described in the Old Testament. New Kingdom 
pharaohs abandoned pyramid-building in favour of massive 
tombs carved into the sandstone cliffs of the  Nile’s west 
bank. It is also during this period that the great temples of 
Thebes were built— Luxor, Karnak, Deir el-Bahari, Medinet 
Habu and the Ramesseum.
Until the invasion of the 
Hyksos, Egypt had been spared 
large-scale foreign invasion. 
After that time, Egypt became 
part of the overwhelming wave 
of aggressors throughout the 
Middle East. Under Tuthmosis I 
(1504–1492 BC), Egypt became 
an imperial power, pushing 
her borders far into Nubia in 
the south and to the Euphrates 
in the north-east. By the time 
of  Ramses II (1300–1233 BC), 
Egypt’s monarchs extended 
their power over much of the 
Middle East. 
By the beginning of the Third Intermediate Period 
(ca 1070–712 BC), Egypt no longer dominated the 
Mediterranean but instead retreated to her natural geographic 
boundaries. During this period, technological advances in 
the aggressive civilisations throughout Mesopotamia did not 
spread to Egypt. Consequently, Egypt was unable to wage 
war successfully against these powers. Once again, relative 
anarchy ensued, providing the milieu for Libyan mercenaries, 
who assimilated into Egyptian society during the New 
Kingdom, to assume powerful positions. Prior to the Third 
Power Points
Except for the Roman Empire 
(governed from outside the 
Middle East), major empires of 
the region centred successively 
from four focal points: 
Mesopotamia (current-day Iraq), 
Asia Minor (Turkey), the  Nile 
Valley (Egypt) and Persia (Iran). 
Each of these areas served as a 
power focus two or three times 
over the ages. Interestingly, 
at one time or another each 
major power locus has controlled 
much or most of the rest of the 
region, thus providing many 
of the historical cultural links 
seen today.

Intermediate Period, much of Egyptian history is a result of 
archaeological and artistic reconstruction. From this period 
forward, however, documents remain that provide a much 
more traditional historical record.
Finally, Egypt began what is termed the Late Kingdom 
(ca 712–332 BC), a period of reunification established under 
rule of the Nubian pharaoh, King Shebaka. Twice during the 
Late Kingdom, Egypt came under Persian rule. The Second 
Persian Invasion succeeded in 343 BC, but lasted only a 
short time before Egypt came under the rule of the great 
Macedonian warrior, Alexander the Great. 
The Second Persian Invasion marks an important point 
in Egyptian history. It signifies the beginning of 2,600 years 
of foreign domination. Independent rule was not reinstated 
in Egypt until  Gamal Abdel  Nasser’s expulsion of the British 
puppet, King Farouk, in 1952.
 Greco-Roman Period (332 BC–AD 395)
Alexander marched unopposed into Egypt in 332 BC. At the 
mouth of the Delta, Alexander founded the city of  Alexandria 
designed to be the capital of his empire. For the next nine 
hundred years,  Alexandria was the great centre of learning 
in the Middle East. 
When Alexander died in 323 BC, he was succeeded by his 
able general, Ptolemy, under the nominal rule of Alexander’s 
brother Philip. Once Philip died, Ptolemy became sole 
ruler, establishing a dynasty that lasted until the death of 
 Cleopatra VII in 30 BC. Alexander’s immense empire barely 
survived his death. His generals carved up the empire and 
fought among themselves to try to conquer more territory. 
Ptolemy embraced the Egyptian religion, a practice followed 
by his successors. Whether for political reasons or sincere 
belief, the practice helped secure the lands of Egypt under 
Ptolemaic rule. 
The Ptolemies ruled from  Alexandria, but became 
increasingly out of touch with the Egyptian people. In fact, 
until the last  Cleopatra, the Ptolemies did not even speak 
the Egyptian language. It is during this period that Egypt 
undertook the last of its grand architectural and sacred artistic 

35

development. Temples built in this era have Greek-influenced 
reliefs as seen, for example, in Edfu, Esna and Philae. 
The Ptolemaic era saw Egypt fully integrated into the 
affairs of the Near and Middle East. Unlike earlier periods, 
technological, agricultural and trade innovations became 
assimilated into Egyptian life. Egypt still, however, resisted 
Greek philosophy and religion. Essentially, the Ptolemies kept 
Egypt independent from other outside rulers. But it was the 
death of the most famous, and perhaps cleverest, Ptolemaic 
Queen  Cleopatra VII (69–30 BC), that marked the demise of 
Egypt’s independence once and for all. 
 Cleopatra’s Last Days
Octavian (later Augustus) defeated  Cleopatra’s military forces 
under the command of Marc Antony at Actium in 31 BC. Unable to 
seduce Augustus and thus maintain power over the throne of Egypt, 
 Cleopatra VII committed suicide by clasping the infamous asp to 
her breast in 30 BC. If you are interested in reading the earliest 
accounts of  Cleopatra VII, see Plutarch’s Parallel Lives, originally 
written in the ﬁ rst century. 
Under Roman rule, Egypt had little or no political 
autonomy. Rome used Egypt as its bread basket. Even though 
Rome ruled Egypt with a tight grip, it was largely tolerant of 
Greek-inﬂ uenced architectural reliefs can be seen at the temple of Philae.

Egyptian religion. Christianity finally dealt the death blow 
of Egypt’s ancient religion, beginning when Constantine 
declared it to be the official religion of the empire in AD 333. 
As can be expected, the new religion took its fastest and 
firmest hold in the north, where  Alexandria became a centre 
of Christianity. It took some two hundred years before the 
last of the Isis cult died on the island of Philae.
Egyptian Coptic Church
The Egyptian Coptic Church was one of the earliest organised 
Christian Churches in the world. Today’s  Copts are considered to be 
direct descendants of the ancient Egyptians. When Arab invaders 
in the 7th century brought  Islam to Egypt, they were welcomed by 
the  Copts living there. In return, Arab Islamic leaders did not require 
conversion to  Islam. Instead, they protected the  Copts, respecting their 
Christian heritage. Many  Copts did eventually convert. They remain 
the principal minority in Egypt today. Until very recently, Egypt also 
had a small but established Jewish community. They were treated 
with similar respect under Islamic rule. However, most of Egypt’s 
Jewish community immigrated to Israel after its establishment as an 
independent state in 1948.
 Recent History
Following the Islamic armies, numerous nomadic Arabs 
settled in the  Nile Valley. Egypt came under the rule of the 
 Muslim caliphs (‘successors’ of the Prophet Muhammad) 
until the 10th century. At this time, a Shia group broke away, 
forming a separate government. This group established a 
new capital,  al-Qahirah, in the desert south of  Alexandria. 
During the 16th century, Egypt came under the control of 
the Ottoman Empire, then under the rule of the Mamluks. 
Originally slaves or prisoners, the Mamluks were eventually 
freed, subsequently forming a military aristocracy. The 
Ottomans essentially ceded control of Egypt to the Mamluks, 
requiring only periodic tribute and taxes from the citizens.
It was during the 18th century that Egypt became 
embroiled in European political dynamics. By this time, 
the French and British challenged each other for control of 
trade in the Mediterranean and sea routes to India. In 1798, 
Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt. However, the British 

37
A Tour of Egypt
joined forces with the Mamluks and successfully drove the 
French from Egypt. This left the British and Mamluks in a 
power struggle over Egypt. 
The Ottoman sultan appointed Muhammad Ali to the post 
of governor in Egypt in 1805. In the end, he was the successor 
to the disputes between the Mamluks and the British. 
Although Muhammad Ali was not Egyptian (he was Albanian 
by birth), his great organisational skills and vision for a rich 
and powerful Egypt provided the impetus for suppressing 
the Mamluks. Muhammad Ali’s successors ruled in theory 
on behalf of the Ottoman sultan, but in reality functioned as 
independent rulers (called khedives or ‘viceroys’).
The  Suez Canal was opened in 1869 during the leadership 
of Khedive Ismail. Unfortunately, for Egyptians, Ismail 
overextended Egypt financially and was forced to sell the 
Egyptian government’s share of the Canal to the British. As 
a result, British control over Egyptian finances ensued. A 
popular revolt threatened an overthrow of the khedive system 
in 1882, but was halted when the British intervened. The 
British then established a de-facto protectorate, but kept the 
khedive office in place.
As most know, the Ottoman Empire, long in decline, 
finally collapsed totally with the end of World War I. The 
British used Egypt as a staging ground against the Ottomans 
throughout the War, insuring their interests in the  Suez Canal 
were protected. Since Egypt was technically still part of the 
Ottoman Empire, Britain officially declared its intention 
to ‘defend’ the country. Following the end of World War 
I, a nationalist movement took form in Egypt. Egyptian 
nationalist leaders formed the Wafd (delegation), which 
presented demands to the British. They wanted complete 
independence for Egypt. When the British refused their 
demands, the Wafd turned to violence, organising boycotts, 
strikes and terrorist attacks against the British. 
Under pressure, the British formally dissolved the 
protectorate in 1922, but retained certain controls over the 
Egyptians through regulation of foreign policy, defence and 
communications. Thus, Egypt’s ‘independence’ was a thin 
shell. Through this process, Egyptians did regain control over 

38 CultureShock! Egypt
their internal affairs. A new constitutional monarchy was 
established under King Fuad. Neither King Fuad nor his son 
successor, King Farouk, trusted Wafd leaders. 
During the years of the monarchy, the Egyptian military 
developed a strong corps of professional officers, most of 
whom were from lower- and middle-class backgrounds. 
Among this group of professional officers was  Gamal Abdel 
Nasser, who was already an active anti-British demonstrator 
by the time he entered the newly formed Egyptian Military 
Academy. When World War II ensued, the British needed a 
military staging base in North Africa to ensure their control 
of the  Suez Canal. As a result, the British officially reinstituted 
Egypt as a protectorate. This action energised Egyptian 
officers into forming a revolutionary movement. 
Following World War II, the establishment of the state 
of Israel in May 1948 resulted in Egypt, along with other 
Arab countries, embarking on an attempt to destroy the 
new nation. During this action, the Egyptian army was 
defeated. Officers were appalled at the evident corruption 
and ineffectiveness of their own government.  Nasser and 
his compatriots attributed the defeat to their government’s 
failures, not their own weaknesses. They formed a secret 
organisation, the Free Officers, determined to overthrow the 
monarchy. Other groups seeking to overthrow the monarch 
existed but the Free Officers developed the best internal 
organisation and support of the army. 
The Free Officers launched their revolution on 23 
July 1952. In an essentially bloodless coup, King Farouk 
abdicated the throne. The coup came only six months after 
‘Black Sunday’, the burning of  Cairo by mobs protesting 
the continued presence of British troops in Egypt. By the 
time the monarchy was officially abolished in 1954,  Nasser 
emerged as the clear leader and became president, prime 
minister and head of the Revolution Command Council (RCC) 
which was set up to run the country after the success of 
the coup. 
 Nasser established ambitious goals for Egypt: to restore 
dignity and status to Egypt; to eliminate foreign control; and 
to establish Egypt as the leader of the Arab world. During 

39
A Tour of Egypt
 Nasser’s 18 years at the helm of Egypt, many of his goals 
were accomplished.  Nasser finally succeeded in removing 
the last vestiges of British rule from Egypt. Valiant efforts 
failed to unify the Arab world, however. The nadir in  Nasser’s 
presidency was the ‘catastrophe’ of the Six-Days War with 
Israel in June 1967.
Egyptian-Russian Ties
Under  Nasser, Egypt developed a close alliance with the Soviet 
Union between 1956–1967. The World Bank, under strong pressure 
from the United States, refused funding of  Nasser’s most important 
infrastructural project (construction of the  Aswan High Dam) due 
to Egypt’s expressed hostility towards Israel. This action triggered 
 Nasser’s turn to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union agreed to ﬁ nance 
the dam, which was completed in 1971. 
Even though he had been in poor health for some time, 
 Nasser’s death came as a shock to many Egyptians. Following 
his death in 1970,  Anwar  el-Sadat, his vice president, was 
installed as president as per constitutional procedure.  Sadat, 
long thought by many to be  Nasser’s ‘yes’ man, soon showed 
his strength. 
Very shortly after assuming the presidency,  Sadat 
introduced a ‘revolution of rectification’ which he said was 
needed to correct the errors of his predecessor. Seeking to 
ally Egypt more closely with the United States, in 1972 he 
ordered 15,000 Soviet advisors to leave Egypt. In October 
1973, Egyptian forces crossed the  Suez Canal and broke 
through Israeli lines in the occupied Sinai. This attack was 
co-ordinated with an attack from Syria on Israel’s eastern 
border. The surprise attack initially pushed the Israelis back, 
but they later regrouped and subsequently regained most 
of the territory they had lost. Following that, a stalemate 
highlighted Arab-Israeli affairs until  Sadat took a dramatic 
chance announcing at a meeting of the Egyptian People’s 
Assembly that he was ready to talk to the Israelis in their own 
house—the Knesset. And he did so.  Sadat’s foreign policy 
successes culminated in the 1979 peace treaty with Israel 
and, subsequently, the Nobel Peace Prize.

40 CultureShock! Egypt
On the home front,  Sadat was not as successful. Internally, 
religious leaders and conservative Muslims objected to many 
of his practices and policies. The poor resented having to 
pay more for less. The educated classes were angry about 
claims that the political system was more open when it was 
not.  Sadat’s economic policies also worked against him. 
In 1974, he announced his new policy for opening the 
door, bringing to an end  Nasser’s state-run socialist system. 
Under this plan, called Infitah, the economy should have 
broadened throughout Egypt. Instead, a few people got 
richer, while the majority of Egyptians were no better off 
than before. By 1977, the economy was in such a bad state, 
that  Sadat increased bread prices until riots forced him to 
cancel the increase.
On 6 October 1981, President  Sadat and government 
leaders reviewed an armed-forces parade in  Cairo. Suddenly, 
one of the trucks stopped, men alighted from the truck and 
headed for the viewing stand from which  Sadat and other 
dignitaries viewed the parade. In the confusion, it seems 
that  Sadat thought the soldiers were coming over to shake 
his hand. In any event, a hand grenade was lobbed at the 
viewing stand, but did not explode. A second followed, which 
again did not explode. Finally, the third grenade exploded. 
At the same time, the assassins leapt out of the truck, 
and with automatic guns fired into the viewing stands, 
killing  Sadat.
Vice President  Hosni  Mubarak succeeded  Sadat without 
incident.  Mubarak was given emergency powers and 
approved death sentences for five of  Sadat’s killers.  Mubarak 
continued the path started by  Sadat, that of opening Egypt’s 
economy and government. He continues progress towards 
eliminating socialism. Though progress sometimes seems 
slow to the outsider, his policies are carefully designed 
to allow step-wise progress without undermining cultural 
values among the populace.  Mubarak, like any leader, has 
his detractors. Principal among these is the conservative 
religious element that would like to see Egypt’s government 
become less secular. President  Mubarak is now serving his 
fifth term as President of Egypt.

 GOVERNMENT AND JURISDICTIONS
The Permanent Constitution of the Arab Republic of Egypt, 
adopted on 11 September 1971 and amended on 22 May 
1980, provides the basis for Egypt’s political system. Egypt’s 
government is a democratic republic with its legal system 
based on English common law, Islamic law and Napoleonic 
codes. According to the Constitution, sovereignty is for 
the people and they are the source of authority. Egypt has 
26 administrative divisions or governorates, each a corporate 
body. Executive power resides in the chief of state—the 
president—who may be elected to an unlimited number of 
six-year terms. The president is nominated by the People’s 
Assembly and then must be validated by a national, popular 
referendum. The head of the government is the prime 
minister, who, along with the Cabinet, is appointed by 
the president.
Legislative authority resides with the People’s Assembly 
(Majlis al-Cha’b) which has a total of 454 seats (444 elected 
and 10 appointed by the president). Under the Constitution, 
the People’s Assembly should not be less than 350 persons, 
half of whom (at least) should be workers and farmers chosen 
by direct secret public ballot. 
The Advisory Council (Majlis al-Shura) functions only in a 
consultative role. It was formed to widen the participation 
of intellectuals in shaping the nation’s future. The Advisory 
Council has a total of 264 seats (176 elected and 88 appointed 
by the president). The Shura is an age-old tradition in 
 Muslim societies.
The Supreme Court and Council of State conduct judicial 
review. There are three levels of regular criminal courts: 
primary courts, appeals court and the Court of Cassation, 
the final stage of criminal appeals. Since the judicial system 
is based on Napoleonic tradition, there are no juries. 
Misdemeanors punishable by imprisonment are heard at 
the first level by one judge and at the second level by three 
judges. Felonies, punishable by imprisonment or death, 
are heard in criminal court by three judges. The Court of 
Cassation hears contested rulings. If a defendant does not 
have a lawyer, one is appointed at the court’s expense. 

42 CultureShock! Egypt
The judiciary in Egypt is generally credited with conducting 
fair trials. However, under the Emergency Law, cases involving 
terrorism and national security may be tried in military or 
state security courts in which the accused do not receive all 
the constitutional protections of the judicial system. During 
1996, most terrorist cases were referred to Supreme State 
Security Emergency Courts; high-profile cases involving 
 Muslim Brotherhood members and a large number of 
terrorists went to military courts. (More about the  Muslim 
Brotherhood later in this chapter, page 48.)
Egypt’s political system is based on a multiparty system 
within the framework of what is considered ‘acceptable 
socially responsible parameters’. The National Democratic 
Party (NDP) is the dominant party. Despite a constitutional 
ban against religiously-based parties, the technically illegal 
 Muslim Brotherhood constitutes a significant influence. 
 ECONOMY 
Egypt’s principal sources of revenue are from the  Suez Canal, 
agriculture, textiles, food processing, tourism, chemicals, 
petroleum, construction, cement and metals. Tourism 
passed petroleum as the second largest hard currency earner 
in 1995. After a slight dip in tourist visits in 2001 (about 

43
A Tour of Egypt
4.6 million), the number of tourists visiting Egypt has risen, 
with more than 11 million visitors annually. The complexities 
of the Egyptian economy cannot be addressed in a few 
paragraphs. Some things in Egypt seem to be changing 
rapidly and others at a very, very slow rate. Due to the 
dynamic economic development policies, I hesitate to put 
hard figures into a discussion of the economy. Rather, I will 
give you the government’s stated economic reform strategy 
along with highlights of a few characteristics that affect 
economic development. 
Egypt’s economy is in the process of liberalisation in an 
effort to transfer the national economy from the government 
sector to the private sector through guided central planning. 
A number of steps have been introduced to open the 
economy to encourage growth. Over the past five years, the 
government enacted significant economic reforms which 
have reduced the budget deficit, stabilised the exchange rate, 
reduced inflation and interest rates significantly, and built 
up substantial reserves. The government has undertaken 
several steps to grow the economy in recent years. 
For example, the passing of decree number 95 of 1992 
organised the stock market and streamlined procedures 
for foreign investors, including the granting of residency 
permission for six months until projects are registered. 
A centralised authority to streamline company incorporation 
procedures was also established. Privatisation efforts 
continue to move Egypt away from a centralised economy. 
Encouraged by the government’s privatisation programme, 
the Egyptian Stock Exchange (ESE) ended 1996 nearly 
40 per cent up on the year, leading all Middle Eastern stock 
exchanges. Foreign investments increased significantly 
and by early 1997, Egypt’s Standard and Poor’s ratings 
improved substantially.
Egypt has a tradition of entrepreneurship and capital 
markets, but shifted to a socialised, government-run economy 
in the 1950s. Centralisation affected the population in many 
ways; nevertheless, a healthy entrepreneur class continued 
within the constructs of a planned central economy. In this 
sense, the shift back to a market-driven economy would seem 

44 CultureShock! Egypt
to be an easy one. However, the mass of the population was 
(and is) dependent on elements of a planned economy. The 
government’s economic strategy is to introduce a gradual 
change programme in measured stages. It is not considered 
a practical or real option to hastily shift to a liberalised 
economy. Therefore, Egypt adopted a policy of economic 
reform based on several characteristics that include some 
very important real practicalities. The comprehensiveness of 
the plan not only considers the need for economic changes, 
but also the social and political dimensions associated with 
all economic sectors. They are quite aware that sustainable 
economic growth must be accompanied by sustained social 
stability or they may lose everything. 
To many middle- and lower-income Egyptians, the 
transition seems especially slow. These groups often 
realise only the immediate results of inflation and a slowly 
responding job market. Agriculture is the largest employer 
in the economy and is almost entirely in private hands. 
Egypt’s oversized bureaucracy employs some one-third 
of the population’s workforce through government jobs, 
public sector enterprises and the armed forces. Privately 
owned service and manufacturing enterprises account for 
roughly another 20 per cent; the remaining labour force is 
unemployed.
Many skilled labourers work abroad (at least 2.5 million) 
or are underemployed in Egypt. In talking with middle-class, 
university educated young Egyptians, many claim they 
are unable to find work in their chosen professions. Often 
people will tell you that although the government promises 
a job after graduation from a university, a person must 
sometimes wait seven or eight years to actually get a job. 
As a result, the tourism sector harbours large numbers of 
the highly educated who are unable to find work elsewhere. 
Consequently, don’t be surprised to find a tour guide who has 
graduated law school, but cannot practise law due to the high 
costs of establishing a practice. Alternatively, you may find an 
accountant or schoolteacher working in tourism as secondary 
employment to raise their family income. Most commonly, 
among the middle- and lower-classes, you will find people 

45
A Tour of Egypt
working two or three types of jobs to try to make ends meet. 
In spite of significant actions taken by government which 
have increased per capita income, the overwhelming majority 
of Egyptians still live in poverty. 
 TOURISM 
Tourism is a mainstay of the Egyptian economy. Some 
estimates suggest that one in seven working Egyptians are 
somehow involved in the tourist industry. Current estimates 
suggest that direct and indirect employment in the tourist 
sector exceed one million workers. Egypt possesses a 
tremendous cultural heritage drawing tourists from all over 
the world to see its Pharaonic, Roman, Greek, Coptic and 
Islamic monuments. Revenues from the tourism sector 
reached approximately £ 11 billion or US$ 200 million in 
2009. Egypt is also seeking to expand its tourism sector 
by developing additional types of tourist attractions, such 
as those for the arts, sports and adventure. To improve 
competitive capabilities in the international tourism market, 
Egypt is upgrading tourist facilities and elements throughout 
the country. 

46 CultureShock! Egypt
When you are in Egypt, it is impossible to avoid or ignore 
the role tourism plays in the economy. Tourism and its effects 
are seemingly everywhere. Although only 263,600 workers 
are estimated to work directly in tourism, the downstream 
effects are felt throughout the population, with the possible 
exception of the small-scale traditional farmers. From 
hawkers to tourist buses to taxi drivers to bank clerks, almost 
everyone seems to be affected by the hordes of foreigners 
visiting Egypt each year. Tourism slackened substantially in 
the early 1990s due to adverse reactions to terrorist activity, 
but this pattern reversed beginning in 1995. 
Tourist Attack
On 17 November 1997, local criminals carried out the most serious 
and horrendous terrorist attack against tourists ever perpetrated in 
Egypt. This event occurred on the west bank of the  Nile across from 
 Luxor at the site of Queen  Hatshepsut’s tomb. Six gunmen, dressed 
in police uniforms, rampaged through the ancient site brandishing 
automatic rifles, hand grenades and knives. The semi-official 
newspaper, Al Ahram, reported that 42 Swiss nationals, ten Japanese, 
four Britons and four unidentiﬁ ed foreigners were killed along with 
several Egyptians. Among the Egyptians killed were the gunmen 
who perpetrated the crime. (For more information on Terrorism, see 
the section further in this chapter.)

 CRIME AND VIOLENCE 
Violence and violent crimes in Egypt are extremely rare. 
When they do occur, they tend to be family related or between 
individuals who know each other. Rape and attempted rape 
are quite rare by Western standards. Punishment for these 
crimes is extremely severe, including the death penalty in 
some cases. Women, even unescorted, are generally safe on 
the streets of Egypt although caution is prudent especially 
when visiting the less touristy parts of major cities. 
Being Cautious
When women are alone on the street, it is important to follow 
local customs regarding dress and appropriate behaviour. Proper 
dress and behaviour demonstrate respect and deter cat-calls and 
other unwnted comments. In point of fact, except in extremely 
rare circumstances, you will be safe on the streets—even at night. 
There just seems to be no need to try to provoke locals with what 
they would consider inappropriate behaviour. 
Sometimes Egyptians seem to be in a heated argument 
right in each other’s face. Frequently, well-wishing passers-by 
get involved in the dispute and before you know it, there will 
be a whole crowd of people shouting, yelling and waving their 
arms. This kind of confrontation can be disconcerting and 
often scares the uninitiated expatriate because it is easy to 
misinterpret. In fact, it is fairly common just about anywhere 
in Egypt and is simply a traditional way of communicating 
that almost never leads to violence. The best thing to do 
is to just ignore it and go on about your business. If, for 
some reason, you happen to be the centre of one of these 
discussions, just stand aside and let them settle it. This could 
happen if, for example, you asked for directions and two 
people disagree on what you should do. Another situation 
where I see this potential is if someone thinks you are being 
mistreated, cheated or otherwise treated disrespectfully and 
feel it is their responsibility to take your side. 
Pickpocketing, purse snatching and petty theft are not 
uncommon, though they tend to occur most frequently 

48 CultureShock! Egypt
around tourist areas. Obvious precautions certainly reduce 
or eliminate the risk of petty robbery. One thing that again 
happens infrequently, but which you must be aware of, is 
unapproved charges to credit cards. Again, this occurs only 
rarely and certainly not in the better shops in Egypt. 
 TERRORISM 
Terrorism is a difficult topic to explain not only because 
it is seemingly random in nature, but also because when 
acts occur, the number of casualties is typically higher 
than individual acts of violence. Besides, the very word 
‘terrorist’ is enough to scare anyone! One never knows 
when or where a terrorist will strike or who will be affected. 
The Egyptian Penal Code defines terrorism to include 
the acts of “spreading panic” and “obstructing the work 
of authorities”.
The Egyptian government’s anti-terrorist campaign is 
taking very strong measures to reduce risks of random 
terrorist violence. Under provisions of the Emergency Law (in 
effect since 1981), the police may obtain an arrest warrant 
from the Ministry of the Interior upon showing that an 
individual poses a danger to security and public order. This 
act thus nullifies the constitutional requirement of showing 
that an individual has likely committed a specific crime. The 
following section is a very general timeline of major terrorist 
events and groups in Egypt. During 1996, security forces 
and police arrested at least 120 members of the  Muslim 
Brotherhood as well as 200 members of a new group, called the 
Qutbiyoun, which is an offshoot of the Brotherhood. Charges 
ranged from distributing illegal leaflets, to membership 
in an illegal organisation and inciting the masses against 
the government.
The  Muslim Brotherhood is a political and religious 
organisation founded in Egypt in 1928. Generally anti-
Western, it advocates a society based on Islamic principles 
of social justice as opposed to secular nationalism. Since the 
1950s, the Brotherhood and many of its radical offshoots 
received funding from Saudi Arabia. Initially, this was due 
to their anti-Communist stance; later it was due to a need 

49
A Tour of Egypt
to counterbalance Iranian-backed Shi’ite radicals and the 
Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and its offshoots. 
The Islamic Group (Al-Gamaa’a al-Islamiyya) broke from 
the Brotherhood in the mid-1970s. Al-Gamaa’a al-Islamiyya 
is the group responsible for the attack that killed 18 Greek 
tourists in  Cairo (April 1996), which was until November 1997 
the largest casualty count from a single incident in Egypt’s 
modern history. Terrorist groups killed 132 persons in 1996, 
compared with 200 the previous year. Persons killed included 
48 security or police officers as well as 84 civilians. Most 
attacks were against either authorities or Coptic Christians 
in Minya, Assiut, Sohag or Qena (Qina). Groups also attacked 
churches and other properties owned by Christians. These 
attacks are partially the result of a feud between authorities 
and families located in these areas stemming from their goal 
to establish an Islamic state and the perceived economic 
repercussions of a secular government.
Ten people were killed and numerous wounded on 
18 September 1997 when individuals tossed Molatov 
cocktails under a tourist bus outside the National Museum 
at  Midan Tahrir in  Cairo. Two brothers were arrested for 
this action, one of whom had previously lashed out at a 
major hotel that refused to give him a job and killed three 
people in the process. (The brothers have since been 
sentenced in October 1997 and executed in May 1998.) 
Therefore, this action appears to be separate from any 
organised anti-government groups that have previously 
sought to undermine the government of President  Hosni 
 Mubarak. Indeed, no known anti-government group has 
claimed responsibility for the event or association with 
these criminals.
A new round of attacks began in a little publicised event 
in Minya in October 1997. At this time, criminals dressed in 
police uniforms set up roadblocks and killed nine Egyptians, 
including four off-duty policemen. Since most recent terrorist 
events have occurred in this region of Egypt, perhaps little 
thought was given to the expansion of this mode of attack 
to other areas. For whatever reason, security (which was 
historically less intense in and around the major tourist 

50 CultureShock! Egypt
sites from  Luxor south to  Aswan) proved to be insufficient 
when six men attacked tourists on  Luxor’s west bank on 
17 November 1997, killing 64 people. The six perpetrators 
dressed in police uniforms, believed to be members of Al-
Gamaa’a al-Islamiyya, were killed during the subsequent 
gun battle between the terrorists and police forces. On 
18 November, a rival militant group, Talaa Al Fath, headed by 
Ayman Al Zawahari living in Switzerland, reportedly issued a 
statement to an international news agency warning tourists 
to stay out of Egypt. According to Richard Engel writing in 
the Middle East Times, the statement said, “Today’s military 
operation in  Luxor won’t be the last one. Foreigners per se are 
not targets, but we have warned them about giving money 
to the Egyptian regime.”
Egyptian government officials responded immediately 
with massive police support in and around all tourist sites 
in Egypt. Changes were made at the ministerial level when 
a new Minister of Interior was appointed following the 
immediate resignation of his predecessor. New plans were 
developed to re-evaluate and refine security measures at all of 
Egypt’s tourist sites. For example, several military sites were 
built above the  Valley of the Kings where guards overlook 
the whole valley on a 24/7 schedule. Initially, tourist groups 
found their movement restricted as forces sought to secure 
their safety through increased security forces. In March 2006, 
I toured Upper Egypt as a standard tourist with my sister. 
What I observed at that time was actually more freedom 
for the tourists to climb the hills on the West Bank in  Luxor, 
more people taking donkey rides, more balloon rides and, 
generally speaking, more flexibility for tourists to wander 
among villages and streets than I had seen prior to that 
time. Security was present more than pre-1997, but seemed 
slightly subdued compared to times more closely associated 
with the 1997 event. When I would point out something 
I thought looked different, I usually got a shrug and a “well, 
you know—1997” for an explanation.
International governments also reacted immediately to 
events in  Luxor, which occurred at the beginning of the high 
tourist season in Egypt. Many governments issued travel 

51
A Tour of Egypt
advisories and one began special flights to evacuate citizens 
on the ground in Egypt. Egypt’s anticipated greatest tourist 
year ever fell far short of expectations as a result of many 
tour group cancellations.
Like an awakened volcano, the Middle East once again 
spews violence. Israel and the Palestinian intifada remind 
us that all is not well in the region. The death of Yasser 
Arafat (2004), illness of Ariel Sharon, subsequent election 
of the 17th Knesset, and recent election of a Hamas 
government in the Palestinian area (2006) leave this situation 
wide open. Terrorists bombed American embassies in 
Africa on 7 August 1998 and the USS Cole in Yemen on 
12 October 2000.
The heinous events of 11 September 2001 not only 
devastated the United States, but also rocked the Middle 
East and all of the world. Egypt seemed to be especially hard 
hit, but maybe that is my opinion because I was living there 
at the time. As I have mentioned, Egyptians love rumours 
and conspiracy theories. The gossip grapevine ensures that 
all titbits, no matter how outrageous, get rapid circulation. 
Before it became clear exactly what happened in New York 
and Washington DC, the rumour-mill was only reporting 
that the ‘World Trade Centre’ was hit. Well, there is a ‘World 
Trade Centre’ in  Cairo on the Corniche el Nil. At first, some 
people thought this was the centre that was hit. This was 
followed by total disbelief that anyone would do what was 
done in New York and DC. People were constantly hugging 
me and crying for and with me over the tragedy. It seemed 
incomprehensible to most Egyptians that anyone could 
perpetrate such a horrid event. When it was announced 
that some of the perpetrators were Egyptian, this was (by 
many; or maybe even most) considered to be just plain 
wrong and absurd because ‘no  Muslim could kill innocents 
like that’. At this point, I heard every conspiracy theory 
imaginable. Well, without going into more details about this 
event, let me say that tourism once again declined, hurting 
Egypt’s economy.
The attack on the United States and the subsequent wars 
in Afghanistan and Iraq appear to have preceded, if not 

52 CultureShock! Egypt
precipitated, more open expression of discontent within 
Egypt as cited below.
All in all, the number of terrorist incidents have declined 
significantly since the 1980s and early to mid-1990s making 
travel throughout Egypt safer for tourists and guests. It is 
widely thought that the government’s tough tactics against 
terrorists during this period removed most terror threats 
within the country. In fact, since 1997, there were no acts of 
terrorism against tourism within Egypt until 2004. There were 
two terrorist events in Egypt in 1998, but there were internal 
attacks against police and private citizens. It appears that 
the predominant terrorist threat prior to 1998, al-Gamaa’a 
al-Islamiyya (GAI), was eliminated either through members 
going to prison, emigration to other countries, affiliation 
with other groups, e.g., al-Qaeda, or conciliation with 
the government.
Unfortunately, new efforts apparently designed to 
destabilise the Egyptian government have resulted in 
renewed terrorist attacks starting in 2004. The following 
is a listing of events that have occurred since 2004. (Note 
that one additional event is listed by some as a terrorist 
act where an ‘Egyptian’ stabbed and killed an Israeli man 
in 2002, but this is certainly not a mass-casualty event 
generally thought of as terrorism.) Most consider these new 
events to be attempts to weaken the  Mubarak government. 
Since attacking the government or military directly would 
be unlikely to be successful, an attack on Egypt’s economy 
appears to be the route of choice. These ‘new’ attacks target 
Egypt’s US$6 billion tourism industry, Egypt’s leading source 
of hard currency.
On 7 October 2004, in a co-ordinated attack, three bombs 
went off almost simultaneously in the  Sinai Peninsula 
resorts of Taba and Ras al-Shitan killing 34 and wounding 
upwards of 100 individuals. According to RAND Corporation 
information reported by MIPT TKB: ‘investigators believe 
the attacks were motivated by the deterioration of the 
Palestinian situation, rather than the global jihad. Multiple 
groups claimed responsibility for the attacks, though 
none were ever substantiated’. One group that claimed 

53
A Tour of Egypt
responsibility was the Battalion of the Martyr Abdullah 
Azzam, which also has other aliases such as Al-Qaeda in 
the Levant and Egypt, and Al-Qaida in Syria and Egypt. The 
group was founded to “oppose Middle Eastern governments 
that the group deems to be aligned with the West (such as 
the  Mubarak government in Egypt), the Zionist movement, 
and non- Muslim forces in the Middle East” according to the 
above quoted source. 
On 7 April 2005, a suicide bomber from a previously 
unknown group (the Islamic Glory Brigades in the Land of the 
 Nile) killed himself, an American and two French nationals in 
an attack on Cairo’s Khan el-Khalili bazaar. The police believe 
they have captured the suspects, but continue investigations 
in the villages of Ammar and Ezbet al-Gabalawi, where the 
attackers originated.
On 30 April 2005, two women and one man (brother 
to one of the women and fiancée to the other) attacked 
almost simultaneously. The two women opened fire on a 
tourist bus wounding no one before they turned the guns 
on themselves which resulted in their deaths. The man, with 
a bomb strapped to his body, killed himself and wounded 
seven as he jumped from the 6 October Bridge onto the 
Midan Abdel-Moneim Riyadh below, near the National 
Museum. Multiple groups have since claimed the attacks; 
however, it is unclear if any of these individuals had links to 
any organisation. 
Also in 2005, in July, unknown terrorists plotted and 
carried out three simul-taneous attacks on the tourist 
infrastructure in the Sinai towns of Sharm el-Sheikh and 
Taba. A total of 88 people died and approximately 200 
were wounded, among them six tourists. Police state the 
responsible parties were a Sinai-based group with no ties 
to any international group who responded to the jailing 
of their leader. Others suggest the responsible party was 
Battalion of the Martyr Abdullah Azzam. The jury remains 
out on this issue.
On 24 April 2006, a third co-ordinated attack on the 
 Sinai Peninsula resort towns occurred at Dahab. killing 23 
people and injuring 62.

55
A Tour of Egypt
Tourist travel into certain areas of the country 
(specifically, Middle Egypt) still requires extra caution. The 
government continues to prefer that Westerners, especially 
Americans, stay out of Middle Egypt. If you plan to travel 
to this area, it is prudent to seek advice from your local 
embassy, licensed tour operators, and/or tourist police 
authorities responsible for the area. Following events in 
 Luxor, standard security measures for tourist groups at all 
tourist sites have been  increased and will likely remain so 
in the foreseeable future. As always, check for government 
warnings and advisories to determine relative risks before 
travelling to the area. Any number of factors not directly 
related to events in Egypt can make travel to the area 
unadvisable. 
As a side note, I would feel remiss if I did not point 
out that travel within Egypt, even given the most recent 
drastic events, presents less hazard based on statistical 
probability of experiencing a violent event, than living 
in most major US cities. I say this not to diminish the 
importance and horror associated with the recent attacks 
or the attack in  Luxor. It is only presented as a reminder to 
look at real events and occurrences rather than responding 
emotionally to the unknown. In March 2006, I took a 
‘classical’ tour beginning in  Cairo, travelling by train to 
 Aswan, cruise boat to  Luxor, and returning to  Cairo by air. 
In the intervening 15 days, I felt welcomed. At no time did 
I feel, in any way, threatened or unsafe. I did not find the 
security overwhelming or stifling, but clearly present. As in 
any potentially risky situation, keep your antennae tuned, 
constantly monitor the situation and maintain situational 
awareness to give yourself a greater probability of a safe 
journey. Or, as my sister reminds me, “Keep your ears up 
and your head down.”
Another reminder—it is always a good idea to keep vigil 
on international events when living or travelling abroad.

THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE
CHAPTER 3

The Egyptian People
RELIGION
If you do not understand the basic beliefs of  Islam and 
the important effect religion has on the life and actions 
of all Egyptians, I firmly believe you are destined to never 
understand anything that goes on around you in Egypt. I 
say this even though there are some six to seven million 
 Coptic Christians living in Egypt. It is estimated that 94–96 
per cent of the population of Egypt is Muslim, therefore 
much of the government and everyday life of all Egyptians 
(as well as foreign residents) are affected by this important 
aspect of life.
The word Islam means ‘having peace with God’ or 
‘submission to God’. A Muslim is a follower of Islam. Do not 
confuse the term Muslim with the term Arab—they are not 
synonymous. Muslims inhabit all parts of the globe and may or 
may not be Arab. An Arab may be a Muslim, a Christian, a Jew 
or an atheist. Allah is the Arabic word for God. When people 
invoke the name of Allah, it is often stated as follows: ‘In the 
name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Beneficent’. This is also 
the phrase you will see printed in Arabic at the beginning of 
many letters or publications in the Islamic world.
The  Qur’an (also spelled Koran), or holy book of Islam, 
represents the literal word of God as revealed to the Prophet 
Muhammad (peace be upon him) through the Archangel 
Gabriel. When the name of the Prophet Muhammad is 
said or written, it is customarily followed by the phrase 

60 CultureShock! Egypt
‘peace be upon him’ as shown in the previous sentence. 
The Prophet’s ‘sayings’ or Hadith supplement the  Qur’an 
as a guide to the correct conduct and behaviour of Muslims. 
The Hadith includes reported sayings, deeds and approvals 
of the Prophet Muhammad. This code is called the Sunna, 
literally translated to mean the ‘Beaten Path’. 
Muslims go to worship at a mosque; however, they may 
pray anywhere—in a house, an aircraft, outdoors. It is 
preferable to pray in a congregation, but a Muslim may pray 
anywhere in the world, alone or with others. Friday is the 
Holy Day for Muslims, so Egypt’s ‘weekend’ is Friday and 
Saturday, rather than Saturday and Sunday, as is commonly 
practised in the West.
Before I explain the basic principles of Islam (and please 
remember I do not represent myself as an Islamic scholar), 
I think I should point out an aspect of Islam probably most 
difficult for non-Muslims to understand. Muslims do not 
partition life as Westerners do into religion on the one 
hand, and life, work and government on the other. This 
is because Islam is considered to be a total way of life. 
This fact is particularly difficult to understand for persons 
coming from countries with a strong heritage of separation 
between religion and state. Church and state simply cannot 
be separated in the minds of average pious Muslims—both 
are indispensable and mutually complementary.
The principal food restrictions among Muslims are not 
difficult. Islam does not allow Muslims to eat certain items, 
such as pork and its by-products. Muslims should also 
avoid alcohol. To some people, even handling alcohol is 
objectionable. 
That being said, let’s look at some of the important Islamic 
principles that guide the life of a believer. 
 Most importantly, ‘There is no God but God’. God is the 
One and the Only God. Jews, Christians and Muslims are 
called the ‘People of the Book’, the Book referred to being 
the Old Testament. However, Muslims reject the idea of 
the Trinity or any idea that implies there is more than one 
God, believing Jesus was a Prophet, but not God incarnate 
as believed by Christians.

61
The Egyptian People
 Muslims believe God has sent several Messengers or 
Prophets through the ages. The Prophets of Judaism and 
Christianity, such as Noah, Abraham, Moses, David and 
Jesus, are also Prophets of Islam. However, importantly 
in Islam, Muhammad is believed to be the final Prophet 
or Messenger of God.
 Muslims believe God created unseen creatures such as 
angels for special missions.
 Muslims believe there is a Day of Judgement when all 
people throughout history are brought before God for 
accounting, punishment and reward.
 In Islam, prayer is to God and only God, and is made by 
the individual with no intermediaries.
 There is no ‘Original Sin’ in Islam. Humans are born 
free from sin, and it is only after they reach puberty and 
after they commit a sin that they are charged for their 
mistakes. Individuals can take responsibility for their 
own sins. They cannot take responsibility for the sins of 
others. The door to forgiveness by God is always open 
through repentance.
The  Five Pillars of Islam
Five basic duties are required of the believer in Islam. These 
duties are typically called the ‘Five Pillars’ of Islam because 
they form the foundation of the House of Islam. The Five 
Pillars are:
 The confession of faith or affirmation of the creed 
(shahada)
 
Muslims believe that ‘There is no God but God, and 
Muhammad is the Messenger of God’. 
 Prayers (salat)
 
Muslims are required to pray five times daily, facing in the 
direction of Mecca, the holy city. The times for prayer are 
dawn, noon, mid-afternoon, dusk and after dark.
 Fasting (saum)
 
 Ramadan, the month of the Prophet’s first revelations, 
is the month of fasting for Muslims. Many rules regulate 
 Ramadan, but basically all sane adults are obligated 
to fast between dawn and dusk during the month 

62 CultureShock! Egypt
of  Ramadan each year. Children are not required to 
fast until they reach a certain age; however, they are 
encouraged to fast when feasible. Certain people and 
people living under certain circumstances are excused 
from fasting, although some situations require that the 
individual make up for time missed fasting at a later 
time. As a general rule of thumb, the following people 
are excused: travellers; the insane, handicapped or 
mentally impaired; invalids; and pregnant women and 
nursing mothers.
 
 
One of two religious celebrations (Eid) occurs at the end 
of the month of  Ramadan—the Eid of Fast-Breaking (Eid 
el-Fitr). The second major celebration, the Eid of Sacrifice 
(Eid el-Adha), commemorates the Prophet Abraham’s 
willingness to sacrifice everything for God, even his 
son Ishmael.
 
 
The month of  Ramadan shifts each year with respect 
to the Gregorian (civil) calendar. This is due to the fact 
that the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar based on 
354 days. Leap years have 355 days with the extra day 
added to the last month. The Islamic calendar began in 
the ‘year of the Hejira’, or AH 1, which was the year the 
Prophet Mohammad moved from Mecca (Makkah) to 
Medina to escape religious persecution. AH 1 corresponds 
with the year AD 622 of the Gregorian calendar. In the 
30 years of the Islamic calendar’s cycle, 11 years are leap 
years. With the exception of leap years, the 12 months 
beginning with the New Year have alternately 30 and 
29 days.
 Almsgiving, a tax or gift (zakat)
 
It is the responsibility of all Muslims to give not less 
than 2.5 per cent of their earnings, savings and gold and 
silver jewellery (or its cash equivalent) to the community 
each year to help the poor. A different rate is levied for 
agricultural produce and cattle.
 Pilgrimage (hajj)
 
Each Muslim is required to perform a pilgrimage to Mecca 
at least once in a lifetime if means are available. 

63
The Egyptian People
 DIVERSITY
Racism as known in the West does not occur in Egypt. This is 
not to say that social status distinction and even differential 
access to positions or power does not exist. What I am saying 
is that the distinction or discrimination that does exist is not 
based on skin colour or ‘race’ as commonly perceived in the 
West. Skin colour may be judged on aesthetic grounds to be 
more or less attractive, but is not considered important in 
establishing one’s social status. 
In describing themselves and the people around them, 
most Egyptians more or less acknowledge the following 
distinct groups:  Egyptians,  Bedouins, Arabs (people from 
the Arabian Peninsula), other Middle Easterners (usually by 
country), and foreigners (usually by country). Several sub-
categories are recognised within the group generally called 
Egyptian. This can be viewed as ‘ethnic’ group distinction 
in some senses because people are assigned to these groups 
based on some common characteristics that distinguish 
them. However, in Egypt, people do not generally recognise 
the term ‘ethnic group’. Instead, people are merely referred 
to as being in different ‘groups’. The most frequent group 
distinction occurs simply between  Muslims and  Copts. 
 Nubians and  Bedouins constitute somewhat more distinct 
groups, although they also fall within the general grouping 
of  Muslims.
 Nubians
When plans for building the  Aswan High Dam began in the 
1960s, President  Nasser was the first to use the term ‘Nubian’ 
to refer to all the dark-skinned, non-Arabic speaking peoples 
living between  Aswan and the Sudanese border (now called 
‘Old Nubia’). With the exception of a small group of migrants 
and few tribal leaders, the people from Old Nubia very rarely 
interacted with or were exposed to other Egyptians (and 
vice versa) until resettlement moved them north of  Aswan 
in 1963. Prior to that time, if the people now called  Nubians 
felt any common identity with one another (they did not see 
themselves as a united group), it was probably only based 
on shared grievances against the Egyptian government. 

64 CultureShock! Egypt
Today,  Nubians are a recognised ethnic group, and many of 
the distinctions and barriers that separated them from other 
Egyptians have lessened or disappeared. 
 Bedouins
The  Bedouins (traditionally nomadic, but now both nomadic 
and settled) are perhaps the most distinct, though very small, 
group of Egyptians. Nomadic Egyptians live, to some extent, 
outside the confines of traditional Egyptian life and law. 
 Bedouins maintain their ethnic distinction through marriage 
patterns, lifestyle and tradition. 
 SOCIAL CLASS, POWER AND WEALTH
Social class is the most important delimiting factor in Egyptian 
society, more so than any type of ethnic designation. Although 
social class and ethnic distinction overlap somewhat, social 
class structure determines access to power and position. 
Therefore, recognition of existing social class structure is 
what is important to Egyptians and to you in establishing 
relationships within Egypt. Probably 98–99 per cent of the 
population falls within the lower and middle classes, with 
the rest occupying what can be termed an elite or upper 
Today,  Nubians, like these two young girls, are considered a part of 
Egyptian society and the distinctions between them and the other groups 
are not as pronounced as they were in the past.

65
The Egyptian People
class (I never measured this, it is just a guess). Pragmatically, 
this means if you move to Egypt on a business or academic 
contract, you may be conducting business or socialising with 
only a very limited segment of the population in this realm 
of your life. At the same time, most of the people you see 
around you, and with whom you will interact daily, definitely 
reflect the poorer and less politically powerful majority of 
the population. 
People in the United States prefer to see themselves as a 
‘mobile, classless’ society in which determination and hard 
work designate one’s ultimate social position. A poor person, 
through diligence and hard work, can become president. In 
the United Kingdom, however, social position more closely 
affiliates to birth. This can be seen by the fact that people 
often know their ‘social class’ and in the continuance of 
distinctions between ‘royalty’, ‘nobility’, and ‘commoner’. 
Egypt’s social structure is somewhere between those of 
the United States and the United Kingdom. Importantly, no 
royalty or nobility exist in Egypt. Very distinct social class 
differences delineate everyday life and potential opportunity 
throughout Egypt. There remain remnants of the old ruling 
family, but most have either maintained their elite status 
through marriage or have taken a place among the ‘less than 
upper class’ as a result of social power being transferred to 
another group of people. Following the revolution in 1952, 
social and political power transferred to a new group who 
assumed the roles of the elite class in Egypt. While some 
members of the ‘old’ upper class certainly remained (as do 
their families now) among the upper class, a whole newly 
formed upper class took hold. Over the 50 plus years since 
the revolution, these statuses have become so ingrained, it 
is virtually impossible for the foreigner to actually tell who 
was among the old elite versus the members of the current 
elite. That is not to say that, even to the casual observer, 
one can delineate social class distinctions that exists in 
everyday life throughout the country. Revolution and 
elections notwithstanding, a relatively small group of old, 
very influential families still control the majority of wealth 
and power within Egypt.

66 CultureShock! Egypt
Traditional stone carvers—class distinctions are clearly deﬁ ned between 
Egyptians and dictate the terms of social interaction. 

67
The Egyptian People
Most social scientists characterise Egyptian society into 
three basic social classes that correspond more or less with 
socio-economic status—upper, middle, and lower classes. 
Intragroup distinctions exist within each of these classes. This 
classification probably will work for you in most situations. 
In Egypt, status is sometimes more a case of family heritage 
than income. There are no hard and fast rules, but Egyptian 
society appears quite inflexible (by American standards), 
with little or no social mobility. Members of each class tend 
to socialise only within their group. Almost no cross-class 
marriages occur. As a result, though persons may amass 
wealth, gain an education or both, they will not move from 
one class to another. Compare this to the American way 
where wealth essentially determines social standing and 
access to power. 
Egyptian upper-class individuals, as a total group, enjoy 
significantly better access to position and education than do 
members of the middle or lower classes. But even within this 
class, certain individuals have easier access. These people 
more often occupy higher ranking political or intellectual 
positions than do other members of the upper class. 
Many upper middle-class individuals actually amass a 
great deal of wealth. However, as mentioned, acquisition

of wealth does not provide a basis for moving one from 
the middle to the upper class—neither does education. 
Although members of the middle class increasingly receive a 
university education, their social position, vis-à-vis the upper 
class, remains constant. A university education certainly 
provides more opportunities for upward mobility within 
the middle class and may well increase a person’s intra-
group standing. University education also provides greater 
opportunities to migrate for work and achieve distinction in 
other countries. 
The majority of Egyptians fall into the lower class. These 
people are distinguished by low educational levels and 
poverty. Members of this class have very little real opportunity 
for social mobility, though the hard-working and clever 
among them do improve their family’s living conditions. 
Rapid population growth among this group has led to greater 
migration to the cities for work as family farm land is filled. 
Most frequently, they occupy low-paying positions since 
they are, by and large, unskilled. Little difference is apparent 
to the observer as members of this class are among the 
poorest in the country. Increasingly, members of the lower 
class achieve a secondary level education. Most still receive 
little education above the primary level and illiteracy levels 
(besides being able to write their name) continue to be quite 
high among this group.
Social gatherings tend to be among social status peers; 
rarely would one see a lower- or middle-class individual 
invited to a reception or dinner given by an upper-class 
individual at their home. Therefore, deferential behaviour 
tends to disappear or at least become less apparent in 
these settings. Respect due to age, of course, always applies. 
Certainly, it is appropriate to invite members of different 
social classes to your home for various events. However, 
whatever you do, do not mix people from different classes 
at a social gathering. Inviting your driver to join a function 
with your boss or a high-ranking official would embarrass 
both guests.
Even within a grouping of social class peers, different 
relative status may still be represented within the group. For 

69
The Egyptian People
example, a high ministerial or elected official might attend 
a formal dinner or reception. While among members of 
the same social class (the upper class), this relatively higher 
ranking person would still receive deference and respect 
from members at the gathering to acknowledge his or her 
distinct position. 
A Different Perception
Sometimes it is difﬁ cult for foreigners to ascertain just who represents 
the higher rank except by quietly observing group actions. You can 
count on the fact that relative rank or status is well known among 
the Egyptians. In fact, depending on the circumstances, you may 
ﬁ nd you are the object of deference from people at a gathering 
because of your foreign status. This may simply reﬂ ect Egyptians’ 
value for hospitality and honesty or it may be a sign of recognition 
of your perceived importance. For example, since only high-ranking 
or wealthy Egyptians typically travel abroad, your very presence 
in Egypt signiﬁ es to many Egyptians that you must also be rather 
high-ranking and wealthy. Deference to your perceived position then 
follows logically in their world view.
 FAMILY
Life in Egypt revolves around the family, and family 
concerns often assume greater significance than business 
relationships. It would not be uncommon for someone to 
cancel a business meeting because some pressing family 
matter took greater precedence. 
All Egyptians seem to love children. One of the first things 
I noticed in Egypt was that children were everywhere. There 
seem to be few public places where you won’t find children. 
When women shop or go visiting, the custom is to bring all 
the children regardless of their ages. Traditionally, the mother 
assumes major responsibility for assuring that children are 
raised properly. Because of this, many people think fathers 
are not close to their children. My observation has been that 
fathers often fondly hold small children and are frequently 
seen with them in public. As children age, fathers apparently 
bond more closely with their sons with regard to career and 
responsibility roles, but maintain a deep affection for all their 
children. Daughters become more closely aligned with their

You will ﬁ nd children of all ages everywhere 
in Egypt, like these boys I encountered 
when I went out to the pyramids one day.

mother’s role as they age. Mothers remain an important 
figure in their sons’ lives at all ages. 
Traditionally, the Egyptian standard was to live in 
the extended family setting usually comprised of three 
generations within the same household. This is still the 
preferred living arrangement among most Egyptians, 
but as crowding forces more people to migrate to urban 
areas to work, family living arrangements have dispersed 
somewhat. Unless they must migrate for work or education, 
most unmarried children remain in the family home until 
they get married. Very rarely do single women move away 
from their family residence unless it is to another family 
member’s home. 
Traditional family size is rather large in Egypt by Western 
standards. Preferred family size seems to be decreasing 
somewhat. Many people I meet say that they would prefer 
to have only two or three children rather than eight, nine 
or more, which was customary in the previous generations. 
Recent efforts by government sponsors to provide family 
planning to Egyptians has been met with mixed success. 
Some people judged limiting family size to be against 
their religion. Since the highest Islamic authority in the 
country has announced that it is not against  Islam, more 
people are moving to control family size through various 
contraceptive means. 
Complementary  Roles for Men and Women
Most Egyptians I have talked to view men’s and women’s 
roles as complementary. Each person in the household has 
rights and responsibilities based on age and gender. Egyptian 
women are traditionally responsible for the household, 
whereas men are responsible for working and providing 
money for the family. Increasing urbanisation with its shift 
from an agrarian lifestyle throughout Egypt challenges 
traditional ways of life. Women among the lower classes 
increasingly find it necessary to work in the labour market 
or in small entrepreneurial enterprises. This is frequently 
insulting to the family male and often results in increased 
family friction and violence. It is also degrading to many 

74 CultureShock! Egypt
women, who rather than seeing an opportunity for personal 
expansion, perceive working to be a necessity which keeps 
them from fulfilling their expected responsibilities for the 
family and home.
Lower- and lower middle-class women usually get 
work in the service industry, 
for example, as hotel maids 
or restaurant servers. Upper 
middle-class people are also on 
the move. Among this group, 
males and females now often 
receive a university education 
and work outside the home, 
thereby expanding opportunities for both partners. 
Although nothing is cast in stone, usually the eldest 
female occupies the role of senior person responsible for 
the household whereas the senior male provides for the 
family (or their portions of the extended family). If the 
father dies, usually the remaining parent continues to head 
the household, even though many responsibilities pass 
to the oldest son if the father passes first and the son is 
of an appropriate age. If the mother dies first, one of the 
daughters may assume many of the responsibilities of the 
household for their father’s well-being. If the children are 
all grown and married, the remaining parent may move 
in with the family of one of the children or may remain 
alone if none of the married children live in the family 
household. Upon the death of both parents, responsibility 
for younger siblings and/or grandparents generally transfers 
to the eldest son.
HONOUR
Never discount the value of honour in Egyptian society. 
 Honour denotes respect, admiration or esteem for another. 
It can be seen as a right or as due. Intricate interactions 
among honour, family and family honour constitute some 
of the most important facets affecting Egyptian life. 
In Egypt, an individual’s honour cannot be separated from 
that of his or her family. As such, the actions of one family 
In Upper Egypt, women rarely 
work in the ﬁ elds as is seen in 
the Delta region. The main reason 
is that farming in Upper Egypt 
is very small scale, whereas in 
the Delta there are larger farms 
where people from villages go to 
work for wages.

75
The Egyptian People
member bear directly on the reputation of all other family 
members. This concept is rather different from much of 
Western belief. In the West, an individual’s reputation may 
well be viewed as a personal responsibility and can frequently 
be separated from the reputation of his or her family. For 
example, in the West, a brother is not usually held directly 
responsible for his sister’s behaviour and/or reputation. In 
Egypt, the situation differs. Any behaviour on the part of an 
individual reflects strongly on the family. Behaviour of any 
family member is held to be the direct responsibility of the 
family. For example, the brother, father and all other family 
members bear direct responsibility for the actions of a 
woman, perceived actions of a woman, or any action directed 
toward a female family member. It is for this reason, among 
others, that family members concern themselves intimately 
with the actions of all family members. 
Honour has so many implications in Egyptian life that it 
would be impossible to discuss them all. So I will discuss a 
few of the many intricately interwoven aspects of honour 
existing in Egyptian society. 
First, honour means a code of integrity, dignity and pride. 
Honour, in a general sense, applies to both the feeling and the 
expression of the sentiment. Throughout Egypt, feelings of 
honour find expression in everyday language and demeanor. 
For example, Egyptians are overwhelmingly concerned with 
demonstrating their hospitality and generosity. Dignity and 
pride express themselves in all aspects of dress, manners, 
language, business, attitudes and behaviour. In daily life, 
Egyptians demonstrate pride and honour for their religious, 
political, social, and ancient heritage—in other words, 
their culture. 
Understanding how appearance relates to honour requires 
using a broad perspective of how appearance integrates 
with behaviour to Egyptians. Outward appearance, i.e. how 
you are dressed, your grooming etc., is very important to all 
Egyptians, most especially to upper-class Egyptians. They 
strive to appear well-dressed and groomed at all times and 
cannot fathom why anyone would want to appear otherwise. 
As a result, dress appears to be a bit more formal than is 

76 CultureShock! Egypt
common in the West. For example, casual dress in Egypt 
more closely relates to what is termed ‘dressy casual’ in the 
United States. What does this concern for appearance mean 
for you? Well, it means that you will also be judged by your 
public appearance. While you may prefer ragged jeans and 
sloppy shirts, appearing in public dressed like this gives a 
bad impression. You will be judged to have little pride, thus 
honour, in your personal appearance if you dress shabbily. 
Second, honour very importantly involves personal 
integrity. A person’s word, honesty and good character 
are hallmarks of an individual’s integrity, thus the family’s 
honour. Trustworthiness, as evidenced through honesty and 
good character, are critical to developing both personal and 
business relationships throughout Egypt. 
A Matter of Honour
I was reminded of the importance of honour during a discussion with 
a friend. When I mentioned that I wanted to bring some colleagues 
to Egypt, my friend reminded me, “You know I can help them, but 
I do not know these people. I know you very well and trust you. 
You must be certain they are right for this—it’s a matter of honour, 
you know.” Acknowledging my trustworthiness was indeed a great 
compliment and a great responsibility. Needless to say, I took a 
huge gulp of air and began pondering to myself whether I knew 
these people well enough to place my honour, indeed my integrity, 
on the line. 
It is through personal honour that deference behaviour 
comes into play. Outsiders often wonder why Egyptians seem 
to defer to others at times when foreigners customarily would 
not. Deference reflects respect. It is a courteous regard for 
another person that often takes the form of yielding to his 
or her decisions or wishes. In other words, deference is an 
honourable way Egyptians use to show appropriate respect 
for someone in a perceived higher position, authority or who 
might be deserving of great respect for other reasons. 
Two circumstances come to mind when I think of respect 
and deference in Egypt. While it is impossible to think of 
all the situations where respect/deferential behaviour might 
appear, hopefully the following examples will give you an 

77
The Egyptian People
elementary understanding of how this works. The easiest 
example is with age: Egyptians respect their elders. They rise 
when an older person enters or leaves a room. They defer to 
the elder person’s opinion, especially in public. One would 
never contradict an elder in front of others. In fact, a principal 
requirement of ‘good’ children is to respect their elders. 
Second, in the workplace, social setting or in trade, 
Egyptians tend to defer to someone perceived to be in a 
higher social, political or bureaucratic position. Subtle acts 
of deference abound in all sorts of human interactions. 
Expressing opinions in the presence of a ‘superior’ is 
not done. Coming from a culture where expression of 
one’s opinion is highly valued, at first I found this quite 
disconcerting and could not understand such restraint. After 
all, if you had an opinion, why not express it? The reason is 
because honourable people in Egypt would never consider 
showing this type of disrespect to their peers or superiors. The 
person present with the most perceived social power should 
be the spokesperson, the one to express an opinion. I have 
noticed this often at business meetings. Frequently, persons 
who perceive their position to be below another will not 
express opinions in the company of the person above them. 
They might express their ideas to you individually, but if an 
opinion is presented publicly, the person of the highest rank 
will usually present it unless that person refers the question 
to an assistant. By the way, it does not matter whether the 
person in the superior position is a male or female. 
Subtle mannerisms of the person in the lower position 
reflect his or her acknowledgement of status with regard to 
the other individual. For example, when asked a question, 
there might be a slight hesitation before answering or even a 
non-answer to indicate that the person feels he or she should 
not be answering the question. You may also observe eye 
shifting or position shifting as a sign of discomfort. By the 
way, you will also get some of the same responses when you 
broach an inappropriate topic, so sometimes it is difficult to 
determine which situation prevails.
Next, women in the company of a male may find that upon 
asking a question, the answer is then given to the man as 

78 CultureShock! Egypt
if they were not standing there. Alternatively, if an Egyptian 
man wants to get an answer from a woman, he may well 
address the question not to her, but to the man she is with. 
Western women tend to find this action demeaning—an 
action of deferring to male superiority. Depending on the 
circumstances, this kind of behaviour may represent a sign 
of respect.
Finally, an extremely important form of honour relates to 
a woman’s chastity or reputation for chastity. ‘Appearance’ 
applies not only to the way a person looks, but also to ‘how 
things seem’. How things ‘seem to be’ can be much more 
important than actual facts. If a situation does not seem 
or appear to be appropriate, then it may be judged to be 
inappropriate. Any behaviour or suggestion of behaviour 
that compromises or ‘seems’ to compromise a woman’s 
reputation for chastity is extremely serious. Gossip also 
comes into play here. The way I have had it explained 
to me is as follows. If, for example, a woman stopped to 
talk with a man, it is likely that someone might see her. 
That someone would then tell someone else. By the third 
or fourth translation, the woman was at the man’s home 
alone with him. By the time all the gossip was through the 

79
The Egyptian People
town or village, this man made her pregnant. The woman’s 
reputation could then be ruined over nothing more than a 
casual conversation. Although this extreme example is less 
likely among the upper-class, more Westernised in  Cairo, 
most communities even in  Cairo continue to be quite closed 
and subject to this kind of concern.
Another example, which may seem quite innocent in the 
eyes of foreigners, involves men and women being alone in 
a room. A man should not be in a closed room alone with 
a woman who is not his wife because this could give the 
appearance of compromising the woman’s respectability. 
If you (a male) drop by a friend’s house without an 
appointment, you might find the woman of the house (if 
her husband is out) either will not answer the door or will 
yell through the door that no one is home. This is because 
it would not give the proper appearance, would not seem 
appropriate, for a woman to invite you into her house without 
her husband or other relatives present. 
Protecting Our Reputations
I learned this very quickly when inviting a male Egyptian friend to 
join some of my colleagues in a discussion in my hotel room one 
afternoon. He would not come into the room, but placed a chair just 
outside the door in order not to give the wrong appearance and risk 
compromising our reputations. 
Incidents of ‘honour killings’, the murder of women 
for reasons of family honour, have been given a lot of 
international press in the past few years. The prevalence 
of ‘honour killings’ is quite low in Egypt. In the event they 
occur, punishments tend to be less stringent than in the case 
of murders for other reasons.
 EDUCATION
Education is highly valued among upper- and middle-class 
Egyptians as well as among the  Nubians. Primary education, 
though technically required for all children, is not enforced 
uniformly throughout the country. Education is often still seen 
as a luxury to poor Egyptians since children are often needed 

80 CultureShock! Egypt
to help with family economic endeavours. Among farming 
families, boys assist their fathers in farming activities while 
girls assist their mothers with household responsibilities. 
Other children work in trades, such as carpet weaving, to 
provide both a future trade occupation and supplementary 
family income. It seems that no matter where you are 
in Egypt, regardless of time of day or year, children herd 
animals, perform household or farm duties, or work in and 
around the various tourist shops.
Primary education is compulsory in Egypt and is a high 
government priority, yet many of the poorest children still 
do not attend school regularly because they are needed to 
help with family income. 
Sometimes only selected children get educated. Among 
farming families, parents often send only the oldest male 
children to school on a fairly regular basis. They believe 
these children must be somewhat educated in order to 
be able to get manual and other unskilled jobs in the 
urban areas. 
Poor farming families educate only some of the children 
because of their values and expectations. Young girls are 
not perceived to need an education because it is most 
commonly assumed they will marry and bear household 
responsibilities typical of women in their villages. Therefore, 
they need to learn the skills that will help them with their 
anticipated familial and household responsibilities. For boys, 
it is different. Farm land can only be divided so many times 
and still support the needs of families. This means that all of 
a family’s male children cannot be provided land for farming 
after they marry. Logically, then, some of the male children 
must acquire some other means of supporting their future 
families. For example, if farm land is only sufficient for one 
child to inherit, often the youngest male is selected to continue 
the family farming tradition and assume responsibility for 
the parents in their old age. Thus, this child is the least likely 
to be perceived to need an education. Of course, if there is 
sufficient land, families may perceive less need to educate 
children since they will be expected to continue the family 
farming tradition. 

81
The Egyptian People
Education for girls among the lower classes in urban 
areas is also sometimes viewed as an extravagance and 
unnecessary. The major exception to this is some vocational 
training for some girls, for example, training in basket or 
carpet weaving. In any event, most children from less wealthy 
families are expected to spend some of their daytime hours 
contributing to family endeavours. 
Among wealthier Egyptians, the picture acquires the 
extreme opposite position. ‘The more education the better’ 
seems to be the policy in this group for both male and 
female children. Education provides the route to well-being 
and progress and symbolises status. One or, preferably, 
more university degrees establish the basis for getting that 
all important government or industry position. Education, 
including university education, is free to all Egyptians who

84 CultureShock! Egypt
qualify (this does not include private or foreign education). 
However, all children are not selected for advancement to 
university candidacy. Although education is free, qualifying 
students may be forced to forego a university education 
because their families cannot afford to support them during 
this extended educational period. While the education is free 
from the government, the cost of living without an income 
is not supported by the government.
Structurally, the Egyptian educational system is somewhat 
similar to the British one. Primary school extends from 
approximately ages six through 12 years. Upon completion, 
students may enter a preparatory school, which lasts 
an additional three years. At the end of preparatory 
school, students sit an exam to determine whether they 
may continue to secondary school. Depending upon 
the student’s satisfactory completion of the preparatory 
school examination, they will be directed into either a 
general secondary or specialised secondary school. General 
secondary schools prepare students for a university education 
in the sciences or humanities. Specialised secondary schools 
prepare students for trade or technical professions. As in the 
United Kingdom, secondary schools are called ‘college’. 
To acquire a Secondary School Certificate, students must 
pass a major qualifying examination which lasts about three 
weeks. A national secondary qualifying examination is given 
annually to all students seeking certification in this area. 
Depending on the student’s ranking nationally (and a passing 
grade), certain students may then proceed to university 
level training. A student’s ranking determines not only if he 
or she will be allowed to go to university, but also in which 
programmes he or she may enrol. Highest priority is placed 
on advancement to medical physician training. Only the 
highest percentage ranking students throughout the country 
are eligible for medical training. Another percentage group of 
students is eligible for the next category of training, and so 
on. A student who is eligible to go to medical school is not 
required to take this track and may, in fact, choose another. 
However, a person with a lower academic ranking would not 
be allowed to ‘move up’ and study medicine. 

85
The Egyptian People
Incidentally, while in the United States the term ‘faculty’ 
refers to the professors of a university, in Egypt a faculty 
member is a student. 
In addition to publicly-supported schools throughout 
Egypt, numerous private schools exist. Some are based on 
the Egyptian model, while others base their curricula on the 
American model. If you plan to go to Egypt for a university 
education and are coming from the West, options are 
somewhat limited. If you are planning to enrol children in 
primary or secondary schools, you should probably make 
arrangements from abroad. In this event, you will most 
likely find that the company sending you to Egypt will have 
listings for private schools from which to choose. The cost of 
private universities or other schooling will probably exceed 
US$ 10,000 for an academic year per student. 
You will also find numerous facilities and/or individuals 
that provide tutoring services to assist students in exam 
preparation. If you seek intensive courses in classical or 
colloquial Arabic, several facilities exist which provide 
short-term courses at reasonable rates (I have listed a few 
in the Resource Guide). Check with your embassy, consulate 
office or tourist authority in Egypt for further information. 
Of course, the Internet is an increasingly good source of 
timely information.

SOCIAL INTERACTIONS
CHAPTER 4

87
Social Interactions
WARM, FRIENDLY, SMILING, HAPPY  EGYPTIANS abound throughout the 
country. In keeping with the tradition of hospitality, a call of 
‘Welcome! Welcome my friend!’ penetrates every exchange 
from well-known friend to total stranger. So why do I include 
sections on smiles, eye contact and touching? Mainly it is 
because a smile, a touch or eye contact at the wrong time 
and with the wrong person can get you into a situation you 
probably want to avoid. First, let’s take a quick glimpse at 
common social interactions among Egyptians including their 
smiling, touching and eye contact behaviour.
In the course of normal conversation, Egyptians make 
intense  eye contact,  smile a lot and  touch each other. Look 
carefully—most times you will notice these interactions 
involve same sex interplay, especially in public. Please 
note—this has nothing to do with homosexuality. I repeat, 
nothing to do with being homosexual. Normally accepted 
social rules for appropriate behaviour between same sex and 
male/female interactions differ substantially depending very 
slightly on the circumstances. The rules roughly fall out as 
follows. Don’t forget these are only broad generalisations, but 
it should get you by until you get a feel for the territory. 
It is always appropriate to smile, make intense eye contact 
and even touch frequently and warmly when in same sex 
groups. This applies for men and women. In Egypt, the 
standard greeting upon seeing someone you know, whether 
in business or social situations, usually includes  kissing first 

88 CultureShock! Egypt
on one cheek and then the other between persons of the 
same sex, often while shaking hands. 
 Handshaking patterns tend to differ between Westerners 
and Egyptians. Rather than a perfunctory, strong, short 
handshake typical in much of the West, Egyptians tend to 
have a less-gripping (even limp, by American standards) 
handshake. Sometimes, they may continue to hold your hand 
long after it would seem appropriate by Western standards, 
but this is normal in Egypt. Both men and women shake 
hands but in most circumstances, a man should probably 
wait for the woman to offer her hand in mixed company.
Since men do not typically kiss one another in many 
parts of Europe and the United States, this can be a little 
unsettling until one gets used to the practice. More shocking 
to the Western male, Egyptian men  hold hands as they walk 
and talk. Contrary to some people’s beliefs, holding hands 
among males and cheek- kissing does not mean Egyptian 
men are homosexuals. The only comparison I can think of in 
Western society translates to the type of camaraderie shared 
by men on sports teams where traditional Western touching 
barriers among men tend to disappear. It is perfectly fine for 
American men on a football team to hug each other following 
a touchdown. Once you begin to get accepted in Egyptian 
society, an Egyptian male friend may well begin to treat you 
as he would an Egyptian male friend and casually take your 
hand as you stroll along the street. In most cases, when this 
happens, it should be viewed as a sign that you are beginning 
to be seen as an equal, and not as an inappropriate overture. 
Never fear, a person interested in a homosexual liaison is 
likely to let you know in a myriad of other ways including 
an outright statement of intent.
Oddly, although Western women do not usually find the 
cheek-kissing greeting with other women uncomfortable, 
they frequently find arm-in-arm or hand-holding with women 
as they walk a bit unsettling. Normally, Egyptian women link 
arms when walking to bring them closer to their companion 
so they can talk more easily. Again, when an Egyptian woman 
takes your arm in the normal course of walking, it symbolises 
acceptance and friendship. 

89
Social Interactions
Mixed gender situations are where things can become 
problematic. So much of what is acceptable depends on 
how well you know the person and upon how familiar the 
person is with foreign social practices. Obviously, the more 
educated Egyptians accept differences in social interaction 
more easily without misinterpretation than do those who 
are not familiar with other cultures. Most social situations in 
which you are likely to be involved will tend to be a bit more 
formal than is customary in the United States. Therefore, I 
definitely recommend using some caution in interactions, 
particularly at first, until you become familiar with what is 
acceptable behaviour. Probably the best rule to follow is to 
let your Egyptian colleagues or friends establish the pace of 
interactions. In general, the following guidelines apply. 
If you are in a social situation, whether for business or at 
the home of a friend, and spouses are present, male-female 
interaction stays on a rather formal level. Smiles between 
men and women may appear somewhat distant though 
sincere. Conversations revolve around non-personal topics. 
Male-female  touching should be limited to a handshake. Eye 
contact in these situations should be rather limited, but you 
should not appear to be avoiding looking at someone with 
whom you are talking as this can be interpreted as aloofness 
and lack of sincerity. Once you become very good friends, 
these types of situations become more relaxed. Rather than 
being the initiator of a cheek-kissing greeting upon arrival or 
departure, just follow the Egyptian person’s lead, especially 
in mixed company.
Men should always be somewhat reserved when interacting 
with Egyptian women, even with women they know fairly 
well. ‘Showing too much interest’ can compromise the 
woman’s reputation and honour, and thus the man’s as 
well. The concept of ‘showing too much interest’ is relative, 
but remember, even the slightest personal attention could 
compromise an Egyptian woman in the wrong situation. 
In most social situations, it is fairly easy for foreign men to 
avoid close interactions with Egyptian women because the 
women will generally keep fairly distant, either physically 
or by demeanour. Often men and women will retire into 

90 CultureShock! Egypt
separate groups, after dinner for example, eliminating the 
issue. Does anyone recognise this pattern of behaviour from 
American parties? In Egypt, practice assists foreign women 
who might be placed in an awkward situation. 
Say, for example, you are an unaccompanied man in a 
setting with an Egyptian man and his wife. In this situation, 
conversation should probably be kept at a fairly casual 
level. If the woman seems to not participate extensively in 
conversation, it is not necessary to try to involve her more 
in the conversation. By some standards, this might seem as 
if she is being ignored, but by Egyptian standards, it may 
be perceived as normal. Follow her lead and you probably 
won’t go wrong. 
If a woman accompanies a foreign male (again in a 
setting with an Egyptian man and his wife), the women will 
probably engage in a separate conversation from the men. 
More commonly, after perfunctory greetings and initial 
conversation are over, the men or the women will retire to 
separate rooms for conversation. 
At the dinner table or at a reception when there is a mixed 
group, just remember to keep the conversation very casual 
and never try to engage an Egyptian woman in discussions 
of personal issues. If you do get off on a topic that is 
deemed too personal or one which is inappropriate for the 
setting, your Egyptian host will indicate this by giving you 
a totally non-committal answer or by casually changing the 
subject. Don’t forget, topics considered as appropriate for 
casual conversation in the West can easily be out of bounds 
in Egypt.
Foreign men should never try to start conversations with 
Egyptian women to whom they have not been properly 
introduced, except as required for a business transaction. 
This could be interpreted as a sign of disrespect, and thus 
by extension risk compromising the woman’s reputation. 
A foreign man’s interest in an Egyptian woman could be 
interpreted (especially by less educated Egyptian men) to 
mean he wants the woman for his wife or worse, suggest 
less acceptable intentions. Unless this is what you want, it is 
best to avoid speaking to women who are strangers. However, 

91
Social Interactions
should marriage be your intent, find the woman’s appropriate 
male relative with whom you should negotiate to establish a 
marriage contract and proceed from there.
A foreign woman who starts a conversation with a male 
stranger also runs the risk of compromising her respect 
as well as her reputation if the 
conversation is for anything other 
than a bargaining, academic 
or business type interaction. 
Socially acceptable behaviour 
quite simply prevents Egyptian 
women from engaging unknown 
men in conversation. To do so, 
even as a foreigner, leaves you 
open to lewd suggestions or 
offers of marriage. Keep in mind 
that the goal of all Egyptians is to 
have a good marriage, therefore 
any unmarried female is fair 
game. (More on the marriage 
issue later in this chapter.) Most 
typically, immediate marriage 
proposals are intended only to 
flatter the unsuspecting foreign 
woman and mean no real intent. 
The reasoning goes as follows: if 
the woman’s morals were high, 
she would not be engaging in 
this type of unacceptable behaviour, therefore any type of 
comment is OK. 
However, do not discount the fact that some Egyptian 
marriages are still arranged based on nothing more than a 
casual smile across a room. This doesn’t occur as frequently 
as in the past, but the arranged marriage does still happen. 
Additionally, some Egyptian men, especially lower middle-
class men, would like nothing better than to have a foreign 
wife, assuming it would provide them a passport to a more 
affluent life. Others simply think it would improve their social 
standing among their peers to have a foreign wife. 
While this may seem unfair, it 
is based on logic according to 
local perceptions of acceptable 
behaviour. On the whole, 
average Egyptian men on 
the street do not have a high 
regard for the morals of Western 
women. They are, of course, 
basing this judgement on their 
own standards as compared 
with their limited understanding 
of Western women and life. 
For the most part, average 
Egyptian men have few ways 
of learning about Western 
women. Direct learning is usually 
gained from interactions with or 
observations of tourists. There 
they may see women drink 
alcohol, wear revealing clothes, 
or behave in other ways 
unacceptable for respectable 
Egyptian women. Indirectly, 
many TV programmes and 
movies, broadcast via cable 
or satellite, provide another 
basis for judging the morals of 
Western women. 

92 CultureShock! Egypt
Unexpected Engagement
In her excitement for learning about everything Egyptian, one of my 
students pursued a conversation with a shopkeeper, asking ‘all about 
Egyptian life’. Big mistake! To her surprise and embarrassment, she 
found herself accidentally ‘engaged’ within about one hour of arriving 
in  Cairo and spent the next three weeks trying to avoid her would-be 
suitor who was extremely persistent.
So what do you do if you really want an Egyptian husband? 
Well, first, find other foreign women (American, European, 
Asian, etc) who are married to an Egyptian and ask them 
what everyday life is like. If you still think this is what you 
want, the next thing is to meet men through an appropriate 
introduction, for example through business, at social clubs, 
at university or through friends. Third, understand the nature 
of courtship, the marriage contract and how it is arranged 
in Egypt. Finally, have someone act as your intermediary, 
preferably a male relative or minimally an Egyptian friend 
who can act as your ‘brother’, to arrange the contract. 
DATING AND  MARRIAGE
 Courtship rituals in Egypt differ significantly from those in 
the West. Young men and women do not have the range 
of opportunities to get to know one another as they do, for 
example, in the United States or Great Britain. As a rule, only 
a small portion of the upper-class population undertakes 
anything that roughly corresponds to what is termed dating 
in the West. Even so, these relationships tend to be associated 
with public activities. Rarely would couples spend time alone. 
Unmarried couples simply do not live with one another 
in Egypt. 
Some young people do attend discotheques, movies, 
restaurants, social clubs and sporting events as couples. 
Access tends to be limited by both wealth and social 
acceptance. People who socialise at these places generally 
tend to be more educated, wealthier and wear Western-
style clothing. Still, only an extremely small percentage of 
Egyptians consider it proper for young men and women to 
be out socially on a one-to-one basis. Western-style dating 

93
Social Interactions
relationships are frowned upon by the majority of people in 
Egypt. This kind of behaviour is frequently seen as decadent 
and a sign of Western moral decay.
 Negotiating Marriage
Under Islamic law, a non- Muslim man must convert to  Islam 
to marry a  Muslim woman. However, a non- Muslim woman 
does not have to convert to  Islam to marry a  Muslim man. It 
is permissible for a  Muslim man to marry a ‘woman of the 
Book’, i.e. either a Jewish or Christian woman. That being 
said, it is preferable for a non- Muslim woman to convert 
for both social, cultural and inheritance reasons.  Muslim 
marriages involve several steps. Significant differences in 
each phase of marriage occur depending on geographical 
region and local custom. Therefore, the following represents 
only a general procedural pattern. 
First, the potential partner is selected; this is discussed 
in detail below. Second, the dowry must be negotiated. This 
step involves settling on an appropriate dowry that the groom 
must give to the bride. The bride is not directly involved in 
these negotiations. The dowry is given to the bride’s family, 
which is then given to the girl. The dowry usually consists of 
some type of durable wealth. Depending upon the economic 
status of the families, dowries range from some fixed amount 
of gold to household wares. Among  Bedouins, men usually 
give camels for their brides. The dowry is the woman’s 
to keep and never becomes the property of her husband. 
Some social scientists call the dowry a ‘bride price’. In many 
ways, this is a misnomer since the dowry eventually goes 
to the prospective bride. The groom is not ‘buying’ a wife. 
Neither is the family ‘selling’ their daughter. Giving the bride 
a dowry is better regarded as a statement of good faith and 
intention. It does not signify a transfer of ownership, rather 
a transfer of responsibility. In fact, the dowry establishes the 
girl’s independence in some regards because it means she 
has her own wealth. 
The third step, which is actually the first of the two-part 
marriage ritual, is the signing of the marriage contract. No 
vows are exchanged at any step in the  Muslim marriage 

94 CultureShock! Egypt
ritual. The marriage contract is both religious and secular. It 
can be viewed as both in that many parts of the contract are 
established by Egyptian family law, which is in turn based 
on Islamic tradition. The marriage contract is religious in 
that ritual agreement of marriage rights and responsibilities 
constitutes an old  Muslim tradition. It is secular in that 
marriages must now be registered with authorities to 
preserve the rights of children born of the marriage. The 
marriage contract includes elements outlining which partner 
brings what durable goods to the marriage (for example, 
carpets, bedroom furniture, living room furniture, and so 
on). The marriage contract tends to remind me of prenuptial 
agreements in the West.
After signing the marriage contract, the couple is considered 
‘engaged’. Engagement is symbolised by wearing a wedding 
ring on the right hand. During the period between signing the 
marriage contract and the marriage celebration, the couple 
may be allowed to get to know one another by going places 
together publicly. Sexual intercourse is prohibited until the 
final marriage celebration occurs. 
The final step, consummation of the marriage, occurs 
when all parts of the marriage contract have been fulfilled 
and the couple is ready to ‘make house’ together. It is 
celebrated by a wedding party after which the couple may 
live together as husband and wife. At the wedding celebration, 
the ring is moved from the right hand to the left, symbolising 
completion of the marriage. In some situations, the marriage 
celebration occurs directly after the signing of the marriage 
contract. In other cases, it may be several months to a year 
or more before the final step is undertaken.
 Selecting a Partner
So, just how do Egyptians go about establishing a marriage 
relationship if they are not permitted to get to know one 
another in a dating relationship? Obviously, if the young 
people grow up among the group that allows young people 
considerable freedom in making relationships, the issue 
becomes more one of choice based on direct knowledge of 
the prospective partner. 

95
Social Interactions
In most cases, selection is by choice, but choice based 
on little or no direct knowledge of the person’s habits or 
personality. Rather, selection is based on reputation and 
indirect knowledge. The following is a fairly typical middle-
class scenario. 
In his mid-30s, a well-educated and reasonably well-off 
man I will call Ahmed got increasing pressure from his family 
to take a wife. He, too, wanted a wife and family, so began 
looking for an appropriate mate. Although very sophisticated 
in manner and dress, Ahmed came from a very traditional 
family, so had almost no direct interaction with proper, 
eligible young women from his area of the country. He had 
several criteria that he wanted in a wife: proper upbringing, 
educated, preferably pretty and, most importantly, a 
virgin. While at a cousin’s wedding, he saw a pretty girl, 
some ten or 12 years younger than he, across the room. 
They made eye contact and smiled at one another. After 
the wedding, Ahmed asked friends and relatives about 
the woman. What was she like? Was she nice? Was she 
educated? Did she have a good reputation? Upon getting 
all the right answers to his inquiries, he then arranged to 
have the marriage contract negotiated. Once the dowry was 
given and the contract signed, they were engaged. Then the 
couple took several months getting to know one another to 
determine if the choice was a good one. ‘Getting to know 
one another’ meant they were able to go places together in 
public, such as to a movie or shopping, and to find out if 
their personalities would work together. Subsequently, the 
marriage was finalised. 
 Arranged Marriages
The oldest tradition, that practised by the more conventional 
Egyptians, is arranged marriages. Arranged marriages are 
characterised by little or no choice for the woman and 
sometimes the man. In all types of marriage arrangements, 
it is customary for a family member to serve as broker for the 
marriage contract. Most commonly, the broker is the father. 
If the father is dead, another male family member, usually 
an uncle or eldest brother, may serve as broker. 

96 CultureShock! Egypt
In arranged marriages, the fathers of the prospective 
couple sometimes negotiate the contract without consulting 
anyone else. In these cases, the groom may or may not 
have some influence. The groom’s mother also generally 
maintains significant influence in this realm. The old-
fashioned way (which still goes on in many sectors of the 
society) is essentially for the mother of the boy/man to 
choose her son’s wife. Since the man could not really get to 
know his prospective wife prior to the marriage, he has no 
basis from which to choose other than recommendations 
from family or friends. And since women socialise 
together and know each other’s daughters, who is in a 
better position to make a good recommendation than the 
man’s mother? 
Women would get together over coffee or tea to discuss 
just which girls were available and who would make a good 
wife. After careful discussion, one would be chosen as the 
best prospect for the son’s wife. Often, the girl would have 
been brought to meet the future mother-in-law if she were 
not already known. Most of the time, of course, the girl would 
be a cousin to the groom and, therefore, the future mother-
in-law would already know much about how the girl was 
reared, including her temperament, reputation and beauty. 
Then the marriage contract would be arranged between 
the fathers. 
In some ways, this process could work to the advantage of 
both partners. A factor that enters the equation is the fact that 
the man’s wife would traditionally come to live in his natal 
home. She would spend much of her time under fairly direct 
control of her mother-in-law. It was, therefore, important to 
have a wife who was congenial not only with her husband, 
but also with her mother-in-law. And since the couple is not 
allowed to get to know one another through social interaction, 
who else knows the young man’s behaviour and ideas better 
than his mother? On the other hand, this assumes that the 
boy’s mother wants a good, loving wife for her son. If, to the 
contrary, the boy’s mother was particularly jealous of losing 
her son’s devotion to a wife, she might best choose a wife 
that was incompatible with her son’s personality. By doing 

97
Social Interactions
this, the mother could assure 
that her son’s devotion was not 
diluted by the wiles of his new 
wife. According to people I have 
talked to, both situations occur. 
For women, the issue is a 
little different. The possibility 
of being wooed certainly must 
enter many girls’ minds at some 
point. However, for most girls, 
not getting a husband may be a 
more devastating prospect than 
marrying someone she doesn’t 
know. Marriage is the only real 
way to ensure security, shelter 
and family in the future. Even 
marriage to a very old man one 
doesn’t know is considered by 
many Egyptian women to be a 
better option than no marriage 
at all. 
You may now be asking yourself if the girl has a choice 
about whether she marries the person chosen by her father? 
Well, sometimes yes and sometimes no. Sometimes a 
contract between families is arranged when the couple is 
very young. Some village girls wear an engagement earring 
even at the age of eight or nine years, indicating their parents 
have already arranged their marriage. With these types of 
marriages, the girl has no input or choice. At other times, the 
girl’s mother had input in the negotiation, especially through 
the selection process mentioned above. The girl can indirectly 
influence the decision by showing unattractive behaviour 
in front of a prospective mother-in-law, thereby decreasing 
the chances she will be approved. Among other Egyptians, 
a girl has the right of refusal and/or selection. Technically, 
a girl is supposed to have the right of refusal, but this is not 
always the case in reality. Choice of marriage partners in 
arranged marriages is, more often than not, a matter of the 
father’s discretion. 
You almost have to be asking 
yourself how could the kind of 
male/female segregation replete 
with arranged marriages lead 
to some of the world’s oldest, 
most tantalisingly romantic 
poetry. I think one of the reasons 
is because ideas of romantic 
love were left to the realm of 
the imagination. If you will 
notice, much of the love poetry 
revolves around unrequited love 
from afar. Usually, the romantic 
fantasy involves ardour for an 
imaginary, silk draped maiden 
or one seen momentarily in the 
distance. In this poetry, men use 
ﬂ owery language and gestures 
to win the love of the woman. 
With these ideas in a man’s 
head, marriage to an unknown 
woman represents the occasion 
to wed the fantasy with the real. 
A woman known only through 
brief eye conversation, if at 
all, represents the ultimate in 
hidden treasures. 

98 CultureShock! Egypt
Although men may have up to four wives in  Islam, most 
people seem to feel it is wrong for a man to have more than 
one wife. Most men will also tell you, in a sort of laughing 
reference, that it is neither financially nor emotionally 
feasible to have more than one wife. I have yet to find a 
woman who likes polygamy. All acknowledge it is legal 
and acceptable under  Islam, but most abhor the idea of 
being the second wife, much less their husbands taking 
another wife. 
 Divorce
An Egyptian man can get a divorce rather easily. Under 
traditional practices, all he has to do is to state publicly three 
times in succession, ‘I divorce thee, I divorce thee, I divorce 
thee’, or words to that effect. If he makes the statement only 
once or twice, reconciliation remains a possibility. Family 
members often serve as intermediaries to try to arrange a 
reconciliation. It is still quite easy for a man to divorce his wife, 
though the traditional statements must now be accompanied 
by a legal document filed with the authorities. 
For a woman, getting a divorce is much more problematic. 
A woman technically can get a divorce for ‘just reason’, such 
as impotence or mistreatment. Mistreatment can range 
from not getting enough food in the husband’s household to 
beatings and so on. Current estimates hold that as many as 
one in three women have been beaten at least once during 
their marriage. Only about half of those ever beaten have 
ever sought help. 
The social stigma of divorce is not terribly serious among 
most Egyptians and the woman’s family can usually find her 
another husband. But some blame does follow the woman if 
the husband gets the divorce. Sometimes people think she 
‘could have done something to keep the husband she lost’. 
Also, since she is no longer a virgin, her value is lower.
Economic factors constitute a more serious reason 
for families encouraging a woman not to divorce. Family 
pressures, especially from brothers or fathers, can be 
substantial. When a woman gets divorced, she then goes 
back to being the responsibility of her natal family, which 

99
Social Interactions
means either her father, brother 
or uncle re-acquires financial 
responsibility for her. The family 
also assumes responsibility to 
help her get another husband. 
Finally, having to leave her 
children with the husband acts 
as a deterrent to a woman. 
In many cases, the children stay with the father after a 
certain age, usually eight years old for boys and ten years 
old for girls. The mother might or might not be given the 
opportunity to see the children again. Most people will tell 
you that a woman will still see her children occasionally if 
the husband is a ‘good person’. 
A 1979 law, which strengthened a  Muslim woman’s rights 
to divorce and child custody, was repealed in 1985 after it 
was found unconstitutional for conflicting with Islamic law. 
However, in 2000, a law was passed granting women the right 
to divorce their husbands on the grounds of “incompatibility” 
or “no fault”. 
 FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION (FGM)
Female genital mutilation (also called female circumcision) 
persists in Egypt today. International health organisations 
widely condemn the practice, citing its long-lasting physical 
and psychological damage. In July 1996, following the death 
of an 11-year-old girl from haemorrhaging, the Minister 
of Health and Population issued a decree calling for the 
end of the practice of FGM. Also, the decree called for 
a prohibition of performing the practice by non-medical 
and medical practitioners. The exact prevalence of FGM is 
unclear, but both government and private sources suggest 
that the practice is common throughout Egypt. It is done to 
young girls (usually between the ages of seven and ten years 
old). Best estimates suggest that the procedure is equally 
prevalent in Coptic and  Muslim populations.
Currently, the government broadcasts bulletins 
condemning the practice. Numerous non-governmental 
organisations also attempt to curtail the practice by actively 
Rising Divorce Rates
In spite of the many reasons not 
to divorce, the Egyptian divorce 
rate has risen signiﬁ cantly over 
the past few decades. No 
speciﬁ c ﬁ gures are available, 
but most people agree that it is 
more common now than it was 
in the past.

100 CultureShock! Egypt
trying to educate the population about the hazards attached 
to FGM. The curriculum at medical schools and for trained 
birth attendants is being revised to address FGM and its 
dangers. Finally, the senior  Muslim leader in Egypt, the 
Sheik of Al-Azhar, has stated that FGM is not required under 
Islamic tenets.
FGM is an intensely ingrained cultural practice that 
carries with it numerous symbolic traditional reasons for 
continuing the practice. Many women believe the practice is 
necessary to ensure that their young daughters will be able 
to get a good husband and that the practice is a ‘normal’ 
thing girls must go through as part of growing up. Therefore, 
in spite of government, religious and private efforts to 
eradicate FGM, it is unlikely to completely disappear in 
the near future. 
 NAMES
Some of the most common names used throughout Egypt 
give clues on how to fit people into the social structure. You 
can usually assume that a person with a name common in 
Islamic history, e.g. Mohamed, is  Muslim. People with Western 
names are more likely Christian. Names that appear in both 
the  Qur’an and Bible do not mark a person’s religion. 
In fact, Mohamed is probably the most common name 
you will hear throughout Egypt. It is so frequently used that 
the name is used in conjunction with the next following 
name or sometimes a person will simply go by their second 
name to avoid confusion with others named ‘Mohamed’. 
The use of titles is an important aspect of Egyptian 
society. The way people are addressed in Egypt is by 
Mr, Mrs, Madame, Dr or Professor followed by their first 
name. For example, a person named Mohamed would be 
addressed as Mr Mohamed or Dr Mohamed as the situation 
warrants. As a woman, I am sometimes called Mrs Susan, 
Dr Susan, Madame Susan or Professor Susan depending on 
the situation and how people know me. Ministerial and high 
ranking diplomatic officials are referred to as ‘Excellency’. 
Definitely try to find out any title a person has because to 
omit their title can be insulting. If you have to err, try to err 

101
Social Interactions
on the side of giving someone a higher ranking title, rather 
than a lower one.
A word of caution when meeting married couples. 
Women do not change their last names when they marry. 
As a result, it is sometimes difficult to find out a woman’s 
appropriate last name. She may well be introduced to you 
simply as ‘Mrs Fatima, Dr Mohamed’s wife’. If you are caught 
in a rough spot and do not know the woman’s name, it is 
probably better to refer to her as ‘Mrs Mohamed’ (if that is 
her husband’s first name) rather than to refer to her as ‘Mrs 
Husband’s-last-name’. This last form of address is usually 
reserved for informal situations, so should be used only as 
a last resort in any other setting.
Egyptians are especially proud of being parents. They have 
a very pleasant, informal way of referring to a person as the 
‘parent’ of someone, usually the oldest son or oldest child. 
For example, a man might be referred to as ‘Abu Mohamed’ 
or ‘father of Mohamed’. A woman could be referred to as 
‘Umm Mohamed’ or ‘mother of Mohamed’. 
People may have many names and recite them differently 
for different occasions. Don’t be surprised if you meet a 
person under one circumstance and his name is Ahmed 
Ishmail, only to find that the next time you meet, he is referred 
to as Ahmed el-Kamel. Usually, sons are named after their 
grandfather or paternal uncles rather than their father.
 DEATH AND INHERITANCE
In Egypt, a person should be buried as soon as possible after 
death, whether  Muslim or Christian. Usually, family members 
wash the body, wrap it, and then it is interred, often within 
hours of death. If death occurs at night, it is not necessary 
to wait until the next day to bury the person as a night burial 
is appropriate. 
A  Muslim woman receives half the amount of a male 
heir’s inheritance. By tradition, male  Muslim heirs face 
strong social pressure to provide for all family members who 
need assistance. A sole male heir receives all of his parents’ 
estate. A sole female heir receives half of her parents’ estate 
with the balance going to designated male relatives.

 DRESS
What Egyptians wear and what you will feel comfortable 
wearing depends to a large extent on where you are and who 
you are with. In other words, this is another one of those ‘look 
around and see what is happening’ kind of topics.
The most visible piece of clothing seen in Egypt is the 
traditional cotton  galabea (jalabaya). A  galabea is an ankle-
length, loose garment worn by men or women. Many of the 
galabeas sold in tourist areas have short sleeves, but long 
sleeves are preferred throughout Egypt by most people. 
Men usually wear white, beige, grey or light blue galabeas. 
More prominent men usually wear business suits or casual 
European- or American-styled pants or blue jeans with knit

103
Social Interactions
or woven fabric shirts (usually collared). Men generally do 
not wear shorts or tank tops in public unless they happen to 
be in a tourist area. 
Women’s Fashion
Except in the highest fashion areas and around universities, 
Egyptian women do not usually wear long pants or slacks. 
Well-to-do women dress in the latest European fashions. 
For social occasions, prominent Egyptian women wear high 
heels and expensive (often silk) Western-styled dresses and 
accessorise their dresses with good jewellery—usually gold, 
but almost never costume jewellery. 
When women think of Middle Eastern clothing, the 
first thing that comes to mind is the long black cape-like 
outer garment worn in movies. This is actually seen very 
little in Egypt except among older women,  Bedouins and 
among those from exceptionally conservative elements 
of the population. This type of dress is more often seen in 
Upper Egypt, though there are neighbourhoods in  Cairo and 
elsewhere that conform to this traditional form of dress. 
Short of dressing in a black shroud, what do you wear if you 
want to blend in most effectively? And, how do you reduce 
or totally eliminate catcalls, hisses and propositions as you 
walk down the street? Essentially, there is no great secret 
here. Just dress fairly conservatively and direct your wardrobe 
choices to where you are.
What is least attention getting? Here you can combine 
comfort with style. It is not necessary to dress in a traditional, 
brightly coloured woman’s  galabea to fit in with middle 
or lower-class Egyptian women. Prominent women dress 
in Western fashion pretty much everywhere, so this is 
acceptable as long as you stay within some bounds. Women 
find wearing long-sleeved, looser fitting garments with all 
or most of their legs covered to be most comfortable and 
least likely to attract attention when getting around in Egypt. 
This can be as simple as placing the blouse on the outside 
of the waistband rather than on the inside. Short sleeves 
are certainly acceptable, but probably should cover most of 
the upper arm. What you will find is that wearing garments 

104 CultureShock! Egypt
with long, loose sleeves (preferably made of cotton or some 
other natural fibre) is actually cooler in the intensive heat 
anyway. Loose fitting, natural fibre fabrics form a little air 
pocket between you and the cloth. Anything made of man-
made fibres, such as nylon or polyester, is very hot. When 
you perspire, man-made fibres tend to stick to you, allowing 
no air space to evaporate moisture. Cotton underwear is also 
more comfortable in the heat.
Tight fitting pants are definitely miserably hot no matter 
what the fabric. For women, almost any kind of long pants 
(even loose fitting ones) are more appropriately worn with a 
long, loose over-shirt. Certainly, there is no legal prohibition 
against tight fitting jeans and low cut or open blouses, but 
women who wear these demonstrate a lack of respect for 
local values according to Egyptian perception. Male or female, 
if you are attending one of the Western universities in Egypt, 
dress is more typical to that found in North American or 
British universities (including the tight jeans). The principal 
exception is that clothing appears to be somewhat less 
casual. Jeans are the norm for both men and women in 
these settings.
 Swimwear presents an interesting dichotomy. On normal, 
everyday beaches frequented by average Egyptians, children 
and men wear Western-styled swimsuits. Women, on the 
other hand, wear the same thing they do on the streets. And, 
yes, they do get in the water, long skirts and all, although 
rarely above their knees. Private beaches are different. Here, 
depending on who you are with and how private the beach 
is, the full range of beachwear is possible. Most mature 
Egyptian women still do not wear Western swimsuits in 
mixed company on private beaches, but a little more latitude 
can be found here. Having said that, I will remind you that in 
tourist areas, particularly on cruise ships or Red Sea villages, 
you can see anything from bikinis to short-shorts. Western 
swimsuits of any kind are also all right at swimming pools in 
hotels and clubs. Most of the time you will find that women’s 
and men’s times for access to the pool are separate anyway, 
so your outfit becomes more a matter of personal preference 
than propriety.

105
Social Interactions
Men’s Fashion
For men,  business meetings and social gatherings require 
reasonably conservative attire. Here, you will find a business 
suit appropriate for many situations. Alternatively, nice slacks 
with a dress or sports shirt (with or without a tie) are also 
acceptable. Egyptian businesswomen dress rather formally, 
but do not typically wear business suits like the ones worn 
by women in the United States. They are more likely to wear 
either a nicely tailored outfit or a dressy dress. Again, natural 
fibres are preferred since they provide the best protection 
against the oppressive heat that exists throughout much of 
the year. Almost always, you will find arms covered. Short, 
dressy dresses and business clothes have skirts shorter than 
ankle length, but usually well below the knee. 
When in doubt, ask your host or a friend what attire is 
appropriate for whatever function. There are a couple of 
important things to remember when asking. First, whenever 
you ask, ‘Is such-and-such appropriate?’, the likely response 
will be ‘Yes’. You will get this response because your Egyptian 
friend does not want to insult or contradict you. Therefore, 
you might get a better answer by asking, ‘What are you 
wearing to such-and-such?’ or ‘What will people be wearing 
to such-and-such?’ Second, unless they give you a specific 
answer, remember that overdressing by your standards is 
probably preferable to underdressing.

 Veiling
The practice of veiling intrigues Westerners beyond 
belief. Some think it represents the most horrible, archaic 
subordination women endure in a modern world. Others see 
veiling as mysterious. Few foreigners view veiling as practical 
or benefitting women in any way. Western ideas vary about 
what constitutes veiling in Egypt and throughout the Middle 
East. So, why do women veil and who veils?
Many scholars believe that veiling was a tradition much 
older than the  Qur’an. Apparently, only very wealthy 
or influential women veiled at the time of the Prophet 
Muhammad’s early life. When Prophet Muhammad fled 
from Mecca to Medina (AD 622), some of his followers 
suggested that his women should be placed in an honoured 
category, so they would be noticeable to all who saw them. 
Subsequently, veiling became a visible symbol to indicate their

of veil.

difference from others. Wearing 
the cloak or overgarment also 
signalled that these women 
should not be annoyed or given 
trouble. Later, the act of veiling 
was legitimised in the  Qur’an. 
Interpretation of how veiling 
should be implemented in a 
modern society is a matter 
disputed throughout the Islamic world. It ranges from the 
mandated requirements in Saudi Arabia and Iran to personal 
preference in many other parts of the world.
Not all women in Egypt wear the veil. Veiling can be 
anything from a large head scarf, pinned under the chin, 
to a long cloak, head and face covered, allowing only the 
eyes to show through a slit in the face covering, with gloves 
and socks. While this type of veiling does occur in Egypt, it 
is quite rare in the population as a whole. Among the few 
women who cover themselves completely, the colour of the 
veil may vary from black to lavender. Most Egyptian women 
who veil wear a large head scarf secured under the chin that 
falls over the shoulders in front and back. This veil may be 
white or coloured. Can you imagine how they could work in 
the fields covered in a full veil? 
A Veiled Experiment
Reasons abound for wearing the veil in Egypt—“I wear the veil to show 
I am a practising  Muslim.”; “I wear the veil to be inconspicuous.”; 
“I am wearing a veil today because I didn’t want to ﬁ x my hair.”; 
“Women wear the veil more now than they did in the past because 
the economy is not good and women cannot afford to go to the 
beauty shop as often as they used to.” Among the reasons I ﬁ nd most 
intriguing are the ones relating to being inconspicuous or ‘becoming 
invisible’. Some of my female students decided to try an experiment to 
see if they were treated differently when they wore a scarf than when 
they did not. They found that by wearing a scarf veil, they truly could 
walk among crowds in the most frequented tourist areas and basically 
become invisible. Wearing the same clothes as before but without a 
veil, they returned to a popular tourist area with shops, and hawkers 
and the usual gauntlet of people tried to get their attention. With their 
heads covered, most of the hassling seemed to disappear. 
For anyone interested in looking 
at the reference to the act of 
veiling in the  Qur’an, see Surah 
XXXIII, verse 59. You should note 
that several translations of the 
 Qur’an exist. Some translations 
are more acceptable to Islamic 
scholars than others. However, 
this passage does not vary 
too much from one version 
to another.

HOUSEHOLDS AND HOUSES
Although  lifestyles vary considerably by social class and 
economic conditions, Egyptian tradition fosters extended 
family ties. It is not uncommon to find three generations 
of a family living in the same dwelling, whether rural or 
urban. The best way to look at it is that the more the family 
can live close together, the better. This means that a family 
may purchase several flats in the same building, have a villa 
with separate areas for individual families, live in a village 
comprised of male relatives with their families, or even live 
in one flat with separate rooms for individual families. This 
tradition provides both financial and emotional support for 
its members.
In  urban areas, small, but distinct, areas (called quarters) 
developed around family groups. New conditions, created by 
rapid development and increasing urbanisation, challenge 
the ability of many families to maintain traditional living 
standards. Indeed, crowded conditions in the city also 
make it harder for urban families to stay together in their 
family’s area of the city. As a result, marriages are delayed 
until couples can find the financial resources for alternative 
living arrangements. More and more frequently, marriages 
cannot be made until the man has sufficient money to get 
living quarters separate from his family. 
When a man marries, his new wife is expected to leave 
her natal family and move in with his. The distance may not 
be far, but marriage for a woman means leaving her familial 
ties and moving into an established family with which she 
has no or few ties or history.
Traditionally, the new bride came under the control and 
direction of her mother-in-law who was responsible for the 
house and household functions. Since the senior woman 
in the house basically ran the household, daughters-in-
law would be directed by their mother-in-law in many 
aspects of daily living. One may be told to go to market; 
another to do the cooking for the family; while a third did 
laundry. Certainly, many women were mistreated under 
this system. Others were treated equitably to maintain 
household harmony.

109
Social Interactions
For rural people, the challenges are somewhat different. 
Limited land available for farming means that, in many 
cases, some males must migrate to the cities for work. In 
these cases, male workers may be ‘target’ workers or may 
migrate permanently, establishing new households in the 
city. Target migratory workers migrate daily, weekly or for 
longer periods. In these cases, married workers usually 
leave their wives and children in the home village, stressing  
family relationships. 
One Egyptian tradition, which crosses all class boundaries, 
is the habit of adult children living with their parents until 
they are married. It is quite different from the Western 
tradition where adult unmarried children establish their own 
household. One principal exception occurs with migratory 
male workers. Since more and more rural adult males migrate 
to the cities to work for wages, increasingly, groups of single 
males rent flats in the city separate from their families. The 
same is not true for women—it is still an exception for them 
to live alone. Young women, even working women, usually 
live in the home of their parents or close relatives.
Upper-class or elite families have much more flexibility in 
living arrangements than do others. A family frequently owns 
villas (houses) and flats (apartments) in several locations 
Citadel with high-rise buildings in  Cairo. Multi-family ﬂ ats (apartments) may 
be larger than single-family residences in the West.

110 CultureShock! Egypt
throughout Egypt. Apartments or flats tend to be quite 
different from those in the West. Among the upper-class, 
flats are often larger than most single family dwellings, for 
example, in the US. Family living space is generally quite 
comfortable. 
Sometimes a large, family-owned villa is divided into 
flats in which different family groups live. This arrangement 
facilitates continuation of the tradition of the extended family 
living in the same quarters. However, in this case, individual 
families have separate flats within the villa. For example, 
the parents (or widow) may have one floor, a daughter and 
her family another, and a son and his family still another. 
Due to recent construction, particularly in and around  Cairo, 
more and more very large buildings house many luxurious 
flats purchased by the occupants. In these cases, extended 
family living may encompass a widowed parent living with 
children and their families or vice versa. 
 RURAL AND BEDOUIN LIFESTYLES
The  fellahin (peasant farmers) who typically live in small 
villages generally practise subsistence level farming and some 
fishing, or work for wages on large farms. Others rent farms

from landowners and share profits from farm production. 
They are often quite poor but more commonly are able to 
maintain traditional family living patterns. Frequently, a 
village may be 40–50 people all belonging to the same family 
lineage. For example, one couple may have established the 
farm a few generations ago, had nine or ten children who, 
with their spouses, built additional houses, had their families, 
and so on through the generations. 
Fellahin houses look like those that must have been 
around thousands of years ago. Although electricity is now 
available in all villages (though maybe not in all houses), 
many houses lack modern toilet facilities, sewage, and piped-
in water supplies. 
Throughout most of Upper Egypt, village houses are made 
from earthen bricks (much like adobe bricks in the desert 
south-west of the United States), sometimes with a mud 
plaster on the outside. They typically have flat roofs with 
mud staircases leading to the top. Some maintain areas 
attached to their houses for animals. Houses typically show

little adornment on the outside. Inside walls are often painted 
with bright colours.
Nubian villages are distinguished from traditional 
 fellahin villages by their architecture. Nubian homes tend 
to be more decoratively painted on the outside than most 
 fellahin homes.
 Bedouins, who are termed pastoral nomads, typically 
live in tents constructed of densely woven animal hair. 
The tent is struck according to prevailing winds to 
maximise air circulation in the summer and to protect 
occupants from blowing sand. In the winter and even 
on summer evenings, the desert can get quite cold, 
so tents may be erected close to some type of natural 
protection, such as in the bend of a wadi (dry river or 
stream bed). 
Bedouin groups typically include 40–50 persons, usually 
related. Each family establishes its own small sub-area within 
the camp. Parents and children have separate sleeping tents. 
During the daylight hours, children can be seen frolicking 
around their family’s area.

 HOSPITALITY 
‘Welcome! Welcome!’ Everywhere you turn, you will hear 
this comforting refrain in Egypt. Hospitality is a keyword 
in Egyptian life. The beginnings of some of the hospitality 
traditions are unknown, but possibly some began in the 
desert. People in the desert often offered shelter and food 
to strangers, assuming that next time, they may be the ones 
in need. No matter where it began, it is now an ingrained 
tradition everywhere. 
Hospitality takes many forms. Some will tell you that 
by tradition, no matter what the cost to the host, one 
should provide a guest three days of hospitality. Even 
if hospitality is not taken to this extreme, you will see 
some form of typical Egyptian hospitality everywhere you 
turn. It may take the form of offering you tea in a shop. 
It may even take the form of sending children to walk 
with you if you are alone. A common form of hospitality is 
inviting you to join the family for meals. They may well spend 
what, to them, is an exorbitant amount on a meal for you, 
even if doing so means they would not have money left for 
other needed things. 
Another form hospitality often takes involves being 
out in a restaurant or café. You may well have suggested 
going to the restaurant or café, expecting to pay for all 
persons. However, when the bill arrives, you may find 
that your Egyptian host insists on paying for all persons. 
It would be very embarrassing to your Egyptian friend 
for you to argue over the bill in public (regardless of 
whether they can afford the tab). When this happens, wait 
until you are out of the restaurant and quietly give your 
friend the money. It is at this point that you can insist 
without your Egyptian friend losing face. Even so, your 
Egyptian friend may well tell you that it is ‘no problem’ 
and that you shouldn’t pay. Remember the rule of 
three’s—allow them to refuse your offer twice, but 
continue to offer until the third time. If they refuse the 
third time, then it really is all right for you not to pay for 
the meal. 

115
Social Interactions
Getting Around a Sticky Situation
I ﬁ nd hospitality rules discomforting at times because I am a woman, 
usually travelling alone, conducting business throughout Egypt. As a 
result, I run into two factors. First, I am a guest in Egypt, therefore 
should be shown hospitality. Second, since I am a woman, there is 
the unwritten rule that men should ﬁ nancially ‘take care of’ women. 
Therefore, when I try to insist that I pay, I often meet resistance 
even with people I have known a long time. I have ﬁ gured out that 
the way to get around this double problem is to insist, and I mean 
absolutely insist—several times if necessary—that they must let me 
pay because I am on an expense account (whether I am or not). This 
takes the obligation out of their insistence because I have introduced 
a third entity, so accepting my hospitality then becomes all right. 
As an ‘independent woman’, this allows me to feel I am making my 
contribution and not taking advantage of my Egyptian friends. 
 FRIENDSHIP 
Most Western friendships require little in the form of 
responsibilities back to the other person—a friend is just 
someone whose company you enjoy. Being ‘friends’ in 
Egypt is very different than in the West. Like love, friendship 
develops rapidly in Egypt. There seem to be few grey 
areas—people are either friends or strangers. If you are a 
stranger, you can expect hospitality, but that is all. Once 
you become a friend, you acquire a complicated web of 
rights and responsibilities. Friendships require energy and 
constant nurturing.
Westerners seem to deplore asking friends for ‘favours’. 
On the other hand, Egyptian friends expect to be able to 
ask favours of you and expect you to ask favours of them. 
This is part of the responsibility of friendship. What does 
this mean in terms of your life in Egypt? Well, if you are 
not used to having people ask you to do favours for them, 
a likely response will be to ‘feel used’. You may simply feel 
imposed upon, but in any event, Egyptian friendships are 
likely to be considerably more intense than you experience 
at home. Just try to remember that if you weren’t considered 
to be a friend, they probably would not ask. Furthermore, 
many times a request for a favour may simply take the form 
of suggesting ‘I want’ or ‘I would like’ to do something, to go 

116 CultureShock! Egypt
somewhere or to have something. Believe it or not, you may 
be expected to help the person do, go or have whatever it is 
(assuming it is a reasonable request). At the same time, the 
slightest hint from you will often provoke a reciprocal action 
from your Egyptian friends.
Going the Extra Mile
Before I was well acquainted with how Egyptian friendships 
progressed, I was astounded to ﬁ nd that the responsibilities of 
friendship involved much more giving of one’s time and energy than I 
was used to. One day, I simply mentioned to a friend that I ‘wanted to 
go’ shopping later that day. I was just making conversation. Certainly, I 
did not expect my friend to take the comment seriously or as a request 
for a favour. Next thing I knew, my friend and her children changed 
all their daily plans to go with me so I wouldn’t have to be alone. She 
assumed that because I said I wanted to go shopping (rather than I was 
planning to go shopping), that I was expecting her—as my friend—to 
accompany me or even to provide a driver and car. Of course 
I wanted her to accompany me, but I would never have asked her to 
change important plans just to go shopping with me. How delightful 
for me that she went to that much trouble! I had my friend and her 
children with me to help ﬁ nd all the good bargains! 
 VISITING
Visiting friends and relatives is the mainstay of Egyptian social 
life. Rather than ‘going’ somewhere or ‘doing’ something 
together, as is a common Western custom, Egyptians relish 
getting together for the sake of being together. Nothing seems 
to give Egyptians greater pleasure than the company of 
others. Foreign cultures, on the other hand, often tend toward 
action. With this action-oriented basis for socialisation, 
people often take little time for activities that do not seem 
to produce some tangible result. Therefore, many foreigners 
have difficulty with the idea of just ‘being’ with other people. 
If you are accustomed to getting together with friends to ‘do’ 
something, ‘passing by’ someone’s house for the afternoon 
or evening to do absolutely nothing but sit around and talk 
can be unsettling. Furthermore, visits frequently are expected 
to take several hours. Rarely do visits seem to last just 
15–20 minutes (what might be considered to be a polite visit 
by some Western standards). 

117
Social Interactions
One of the Family
Probably one of the most disconcerting events I experienced when 
I passed by a friend’s house developed when I was invited for the 
afternoon meal. I duly went for lunch, enjoyed the meal, and settled 
down for what I thought was going to be a short visit following 
the meal. After we had chatted for a few minutes, my hosts (who 
followed the Egyptian custom of napping in the afternoon) offered 
me a room to take a nap. My initial response was to panic and try to 
leave immediately, because I thought I had overstayed my welcome. I 
deﬁ nitely had to ﬁ ght the urge to run. In retrospect, I realise that they 
simply wanted me to stay for a longer visit, assumed that I followed 
their tradition of napping, and were treating me as a family member 
and valued friend. I was ‘welcome’ in their home. But to me, since I 
was not a house-guest, it was totally unfathomable that I should go 
to someone’s house and take a nap. 
 BAKSHEESH AND TIPPING
Baksheesh and tipping are two entirely separate things to 
Egyptians although Arabic dictionaries and tourist guide 
books usually denote them as synonymous. It is especially 
difficult around tourist areas to distinguish baksheesh from 
tipping. This is compounded by the fact that every local 
knows the guide books use the words synonymously. 
Baksheesh are technically gifts for the poor, a handout or 
alms. Beggars of all ages throughout Egypt approach you saying, 
“Baksheesh! Baksheesh!” At first it is very difficult to turn down 
someone who looks quite helpless and needy—especially if it 
is a ragged, dirty little child. Very rapidly you will be able to 
distinguish between the ones that are sent out to hit on any 
foreigner who appears from others. Let your conscience be 
your guide regarding giving money, but remember one thing: 
if you give to one person, you will likely find many others 
immediately surrounding you asking for money. If someone 
is truly handicapped, you should always give a little something 
to help them—this is likely their only means of support.
Tipping, on the other hand, is considered proper and 
appropriate for any small service rendered. They have given 
you something (a service) and you should reciprocate (a tip). 
Most of the time people are quite courteous if you fail to give 
them a tip when they deem it appropriate, and simply remind 
you with a palm up gesture. If they speak your language, 

118 CultureShock! Egypt
they may well remind you with the word ‘tip’ in whatever 
language. If not, they may use the word baksheesh if you 
seem particularly ignorant to what they expect. 
Since  tipping is considered rude under some circumstances 
and simply not necessary in some cultures, foreigners often 
do not realise that in many situations in Egypt they are 
expected to give a tip, whereas they might not be expected 
to tip in their native culture. Furthermore, Americans may 
find it an affront, especially if the person seems to be doing 
nothing or is in some kind of uniform. A couple of examples 
should suffice to show how this works.
First, if you are at an ancient site where there are uniformed 
guards protecting the place or at an entrance/exit gate, a 
person from the United States would usually not consider that 
these people should be tipped. They are employed, getting 
a salary—just doing their job with seemingly no service 
provided. After all, they didn’t bring you a meal or carry 
your bag, right? Besides, some are government employees 
or members of the military. In the United States, it is not 
only immoral, but illegal, to tip government employees. Why 
should you tip them? Well, in Egypt they are performing a 
service for you—they are protecting you or easing your stay 
or assisting you in having a good visit. It is true they may get 
a salary, but like people in the service industry, their income 
also depends on getting tips. Their employer is irrelevant. If 
you look closely, you will see people or tour leaders almost 
imperceptibly passing a small tip as they shake hands upon 
going through the gate or when they leave. The average visitor 
may never notice money exchanging hands.
The same goes for monument watchers or keepers at 
mosques. These men appear in total silence out of the 
shadows when you least expect them. They are there to 
keep disrespectful people from leaving graffiti or trash, or 
otherwise defacing public monuments. They also tell you 
in no uncertain terms when you are not supposed to be in 
an area. Again, you shouldn’t make a big deal out of it, just 
quietly give them a small tip for this service. You will readily 
differentiate between these men and the ones that appear 
out of nowhere with goods to sell.

The largely Muslim community in Egypt hold mass prayers 
every Friday at mosques. They may also pray in a group of 
their own, or as an individual as shown here.

A final example relates to children. Once I was busily 
taking pictures around  Khan el-Khalili Bazaar and, since you 
should always ask people if it is OK, I asked some children 
if I could take their pictures. All children love to have their 
picture taken (though women usually don’t) and so, of 
course, they posed. Afterwards, they surrounded me asking 
for  baksheesh. A nearby shopkeeper saw them around me 
and came out yelling at them to leave me alone. I insisted 
to the shopkeeper that they had given me something (their 
picture) and I wanted to give them something back. At first, 
he still did not want me to give them anything because they 
were ‘begging’, but finally he understood (I think) that it was 
really only reciprocation on my part.
 GIFTS
Gifts are a tough one. Knowing who to give gifts and what 
to give sometimes seems challenging. Several occasions 
warrant small gifts. When leaving for Egypt, take small gifts 
for special people you will meet in Egypt. Gifts should be 
nice, but need not be terribly expensive. If you come from 
a particular region known for a special product, something 
along these lines would be quite acceptable. For example, I 
am from Texas, so I usually take along a variety of Texana 
gifts ranging from coffee-table books to trivets decorated 
with Texas wildflowers for special occasions. Fine writing 
pens are always a safe gift for men. 
It is also a generally accepted practice to take something 
to your hostess when being entertained at someone’s home. 
Taking flowers is a custom in many parts of the United States 
and other Western countries, but probably best avoided in 
Egypt unless it is something you absolutely know the hostess 
would like. Unfortunately, until you have been there quite a 
long time, you probably won’t know the protocol regarding 
colour, flower variety or arrangement, and you could 
easily go to one of the local flower stands and get a funeral 
arrangement as a wedding or table arrangement. Sweets, 
candy or nuts are a good bet. Most sweet shops will package 
your gift in a box with a nice ribbon for you to take to your 
hostess. By the way, do not take something perishable or you 

120 CultureShock! Egypt
run the risk of having it ruin. A proper Egyptian hostess will 
thank you for the gift and set it aside for opening later (as is 
the custom with most gifts). If you are hosting and people 
bring you gifts, you should follow the same practice. 
Another category of gifts relates to children. It is acceptable 
to bring gifts for young children if you know the people well. 
I like to stock up before leaving home with colouring books, 
coloured marking pens or crayons, and little toys that may 
not be available in Egypt to give to children of my friends. Be 
careful not to take anything that has a religious connotation. 
A final category of what may be considered gifts are the 
items you take along to give to people you may meet along 
the streets or when visiting tourist sites. For some reason, 
inexpensive writing pens and lighters seem to be premium 
gifts. Poor children everywhere will often hold out their hands 
asking you to give them pens. They seem to especially like 
the ones that click, though any pen can cause furious rivalry 
within a mob of children. With adults in tourist areas, these 
small items can often be used as bargaining aids as well as 
for tips. It is probably best not to take candy or chewing gum 
for these occasions. Many poorer people do not get their 
teeth fixed and may have dental cavities, so candy or gum 
hurt their teeth.

 COMPLIMENTS
Complimenting someone on something they have or are 
wearing can be a little confusing in Egypt. While it is standard 
practice to tell someone in the United States, for example, 
that they have a beautiful necklace or ring or anything, 
you should be a little careful in Egypt. Why? Generosity to 
a guest is important to maintain a good reputation. As a 
result, if you are not careful, what is meant to be simply a 
compliment of good taste places your Egyptian hosts in the 
awkward position of needing to demonstrate their generosity 
by offering you the admired object, especially if it is a small, 
portable object. 
The way it works is more or less like this. You can say 
something like, ‘Oh, you have a lovely home.’ People are not 
likely to try to give you their home. But if you say something 
like, ‘This box is so beautiful. I have been looking everywhere 
for one just like it’, watch out. The person you say this to 
may feel obligated to offer it to you. They want to make you 
happy and welcome. Now assume that you were not ‘hinting’ 
that they give you their treasure, you suddenly feel guilty 
because you realise that their innate generosity means they 
will offer the box to you. If you find yourself in an awkward 
position like this (and it can happen when you least expect 
it), thank them and refuse. It can get even trickier because 
they will then try to insist that you take it because they are

generous. Again, refuse. Usually that will end the offering. 
A sort of rule of thumb is if something is offered to you the 
third time, you may assume the person really wants you to 
have it and is not offering out of social obligation. In this 
case, you may accept if it seems appropriate to you. You 
must, naturally, use your own judgement of good taste and 
propriety depending on the article offered. Just remember 
that admiration of something will often place your Egyptian 
friends in the position of having to offer it to you to maintain 
their social reputation. 
A Lesson Learned
One of my most embarrassing moments occurred as a result of 
window shopping with an American friend along with a friend who 
was Egyptian. It was close to when I was getting ready to leave Egypt 
and I did not think about the fact that my Egyptian friend might want 
to get me a little gift as a going-away present. So as I blithely wandered 
through some gold shops in Khan el-Khalili (trying, I thought, to help 
my Egyptian friend ﬁ nd a token gift to send to someone else), we 
passed a shop window which had what I considered to be one of the 
most beautiful sapphire rings I had ever seen in my life. So, naturally, 
I pointed it out to my American friend with a comment like, ‘Wish 
I hadn’t bought so much, because I would give it all up to have that 
ring.’ In my mind, it was so expensive as to be outside the realm of 
anything for serious contemplation, just one of those nonchalant 
comments we Americans often make when window shopping. I did 
not know my American friend was in a small conspiracy with my 
Egyptian friend. Apparently, all afternoon they had been just waiting 
for me to comment on some piece of jewellery that I really liked. 
Had I guessed they might have been looking for something for me, 
I would certainly have kept my mouth shut about the ring in front 
of them or would have pointed out something relatively inexpensive 
as being the absolute thing I most wanted in life. You can guess 
what happened next: my Egyptian friend presented the ring to me 
over dinner as a gift. The ring is, without a doubt, one of my most 
treasured possessions (it ranks right up there with the watch my 
grandmother gave me when I graduated from high school). I wear it 
with pride and am eternally grateful for his generosity. It is still the 
most beautiful ring I have ever seen, but you can just imagine my 
embarrassment when I realised what I had done. I am now much 
more cautious when I shop with Egyptian friends and am careful of 
what I admire in shop windows.

Americans, Canadians and British may purchase a  renewable 
30-day visa at the  Cairo airport. This must be paid in 
the hard currency of your country (approximate cost is 
US$ 15). You should get a visa prior to arrival if you are 
arriving overland or if you have experienced trouble with 
your visa in the past. If you arrive from Israel at the Taba 
border crossing without an Egyptian visa, a 14-day visa valid 
for travel within Sinai only may be granted. Work permits 
must be obtained through the employer. If you plan to be 
in Egypt more than 30 days, an AIDS test is required. Proof 
of yellow fever immunisation is required if arriving from an 
infected area.

There are few  jobs for foreigners outside  Cairo, though 
some jobs require travelling throughout the country. There 

125
The Logistics of Settling In
are two types of jobs: those paid in Egyptian currency 
(usually much lower paying positions) and those paid 
in foreign currency. Lucrative jobs that pay in US dollars 
usually need to be lined up before coming to Egypt. 
Remember you must have a work permit. Ministerial 
Decree No 43/88, applicable to Law No 137/81, Article No 
1, states in part that ‘foreigners shall not be allowed to work 
in the Arab Republic of Egypt without obtaining a  work 
permit from the Ministry of Manpower and Immigration’. 
Foreigners can acquire a work permit from the Ministry 
of Manpower and Training to work in Egypt, and 
accordingly are authorised residency in the country. 
Work permits must be obtained through the employer. 
Foreigners are generally not allowed to change residency 
status from non-working to working status while in 
the country. 
 HIV-AIDS Test Required of Residents
The Ministry of Manpower and Immigration’s circular No 1/1993 
states that all foreign expatriates are required to submit an HIV- 
free (AIDS) test certiﬁ cate when applying for a work permit. The 
HIV test must be done in governmental or university hospitals 
or laboratories. It is permissible to bring your own disposable 
needle. Work permit ofﬁ cials recommend GOE-owned Central 
Labs for the HIV test. The lab technicians are very well trained 
and familiar with work permit/HIV-relevant requirements. The 
address of the Central Labs is:

If you are in Egypt and looking for a job, you are likely 
only to be able to get a job paying in Egyptian currency. 
As mentioned before, you can get a renewable visa at the 
airport if you are job-hunting. However, for longer term 
living you will need a residence visa. Job hunting in Egypt is 
networking—almost all jobs are filled by word of mouth.

 NGO Job Opportunities
The largest foreign-based NGOs offer opportunities to arrange a 
job before arrival in Egypt. Among the biggest are:
 Ford Foundation
 
Website: http://www.fordfound.org/employment
 USAID 
 
Website: http://www.usaid.gov/careers
Some expatriates do ﬁ nd jobs with these organisations after 
their arrival, as contractors for work ranging from grant writing to 
project management. Employment discrimination is common in 
Egypt, especially based on age or gender. It is not uncommon to 
see an ad for a male, aged 25–30. 
 DOCUMENTS TO BRING
PASSPORT! Keep it with you always; it is handy if you are 
stopped by the police. Even if I don’t plan to drive, I always 
carry my driver’s licence with me.
You will need a visa to enter Egypt, but don’t worry, 
if you didn’t get one before you left home, you can get 
a tourist visa at the airport when you get there. But, you 
must pay in hard currency! I also always suggest keeping 
a copy of all credit card or bank card numbers along 
with emergency telephone numbers to contact in the 
event of loss. I usually leave a copy of the numbers with 
a trusted friend or relative at home in case I lose the copy 
I have with me. It may turn out to be easier for a friend or 
relative to contact the company to report your card loss. 
Another thing I like to have is proof of medical insurance. It 
is not likely that any medical treatment you get in Egypt will 
file with your insurance, but I like to have it anyway. Not all 
insurances will pay for mishaps that occur abroad, so be sure 
to check if your insurance scheme/company does before you 
leave, and, if necessary, secure insurance that covers medical 
services outside your home country. 
Note that US Medicare and Medicaid programs do not 
cover services outside the United States. Americans can

 PRE-ENTRY VACCINATIONS
In general, the best advice is to see your physician before 
getting any kind of immunisation. Now, that being said, go 
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website 
at http://www.cdc.gov to get the latest information on 
requirements. (Select ‘Traveller’s Health’, then select ‘North 
Africa’.) In general, malaria is rare in Egypt (El Faiyum area 
only), and can be prevented with chloroquine. At this time, 
the Centers recommend the following vaccines: 
 Hepatitis A
 Hepatitis B
 rabies
 typhoid
 boosters for tetanus-diphtheria
 measles
 a one-time dose of polio vaccine for adults
If you are staying for periods longer than one month, you 
will be required to produce proof of an HIV test.
 HOUSING
Finding good housing in Egypt depends on what you want 
and where you want to live. If your company is sending you 
over, they may have a flat arranged for you. If not, the best 
thing is to plan to stay in a hotel for a few days or weeks 
until you have an opportunity to scope out the landscape. 
Whether in the  Cairo or  Alexandria metropolitan areas, the 
first thing you must decide is in which area you want to live. 
If you are moving to a smaller city, the options may be more 
limited than in the two major cities. 
Where you want to live will depend principally on your 
purpose for being there, how long you plan to stay, and the 
standard of living you prefer. Usually, flats and villas can 
be rented for a minimum of one month. So, if you plan to 
be in Egypt for a shorter period of time, you should count 
on staying in a hotel or paying for a month’s rent even if 
you leave before the month is up. If you really want the 

128 CultureShock! Egypt
experience of living in an Egyptian neighbourhood, renting 
a flat or villa is preferable to a hotel. In any event, unless 
you have some contacts in Egypt prior to going who can 
arrange your living quarters for you, you will need to stay 
in a hotel for at least a few days until you can find an 
appropriate flat. 
Housing in Egypt can be quite reasonably priced by 
North American or European standards. The main thing to 
ask before renting a flat is what is included in the price. I 
don’t mean asking a general question like, ‘Does this include 
everything?’ If you ask a question like this, misunderstandings 
are likely to occur. What constitutes ‘everything’ by your 
standard may be entirely different by Egyptian standards. So, 
be sure to ask for every specific kind of detail you can possibly 
imagine. If not, you may find yourself handed another bill 
for services you thought were included in the rental price. 
What you need to know is: do I have to pay separate for 
electricity? Gas? Water? Rubbish pick-up? Phone? (More about 
phones later.) Excluding the phone, electricity, gas, water and 
rubbish removal can add up to several hundred Egyptian 
pounds each month. If the apartment comes with a phone, 
how many local calls or minutes are included? Is the phone 
set up to call international or to cell phones? Which modern 
appliances are in the apartment? Is the flat air-conditioned 
(important for summer stays). Who do you contact if (when?) 
something breaks, such as the air conditioner? Is any maid 
service included? Where can you get a good maid or nanny 
for the children? 
You will most likely have one or more doormen (boheb) 
for the building. They are critically important to you and you 
should tip them nicely each month. If you take good care of 
them, they will take good care of you! Local flat owners can 
give you a general idea about how much to give them each 
month. I also tipped them whenever they did something 
nice for me, for example, if they took the laundry or picked 
it up for me or if they helped me get groceries from the taxi 
to my flat. 
Another very important feature to consider is how far 
the flat/villa is from where you work. If you are in  Cairo 

129
The Logistics of Settling In
or  Alexandria, getting a place to live that is close to where 
you will be working may be an important consideration. 
If you have to take taxis around the city all day, you can 
run up significant expenses on transportation before you 
know it. On the other hand, if you have a driver or car to 
move you around the city or live close to a Metro stop, 
distance from work may be relatively unimportant. Then 
the choice may be a time issue, how long are you willing to 
commute daily? 
Family considerations also may come into play. Distance 
from work or usual daily activities may well be less important 
than having your family close to schools or recreational 
activities. For example, many Westerners with children 
prefer to live in the Maadi suburb as Maadi is relatively quiet 
compared to other sections of  Cairo. It is a rather upper-class 
neighbourhood of large old homes and gardens. This is a very 
family-oriented neighbourhood where kids can ride bicycles 
and skateboard. Maadi has great shopping (check out the 
Maadi Grand Mall), local churches, a community centre and 
many other trappings of Western life. The Cairo American 
College (K-12) is located in Maadi.
Another area you might want to consider is downtown 
 Cairo, close to  Tahrir Square. If you like the noise, traffic 
and other trappings of city 
living, you will love this hub of 
city life. Activity abounds day 
and night. Many shopping and 
entertainment options exist. This 
area is probably not as good for 
families with children.
Garden City is quite close 
to downtown  Cairo. It remains 
an elite residential, diplomatic 
a n d  b u s i n e s s  a d d r e s s. 
Most of the neighbourhood 
population is Egyptian; 
however, a few foreigners do 
live here. Goods and services

neighbourhood. Garden City has no private school for 
English-speaking children. 
Zamalek has some of the best shopping and restaurants 
in  Cairo. It is located on the northern end of Gezira 
Island and is home to the famous Gezira Sporting Club, 
public green areas and a new public library (the Greater 
Cairo Library). The British International School is located 
in Zamalek. 
All in all, living in Egypt can be relatively inexpensive, but 
the cost can rise rapidly depending on the choices you make. 
Prices can range from absurdly low to very high, depending 
on what you want. One thing for certain, if you hire a rental 
agent to find you a flat, once you tell them how much you 
plan to spend (or how much your company has allowed you), 
you may be assured that every flat you see will be within 
E£ 100 of whatever amount you told the agent, whether it 
is worth that amount or not. How do I know this is true? 
You guessed it—I learned the hard way! The questions I got 
from the agent that set me up to pay a high price for my flat 
were: do you have a housing allowance from your employer? 
How much? I answered each question truthfully and, funnily 
every single flat I visited (big or little) was about the same 
price—exactly my housing allowance or more. I am not totally

The Logistics of Settling In
sure how to get around this with an agent, but I suggest if 
you have to come up with a figure, tell them much less than 
you actually have in mind to pay. Instead, stress what you 
are looking for in a flat—two or three bedrooms, on Zamalek, 
modern kitchen, air conditioning, etc. 
Also, if you tell them you will pay in US dollars, Pounds 
Sterling or Euros, the rate will go up. Try to negotiate a rate in 
Egyptian pounds. After you find the absolute ‘right’ place for 
you, then you can keep in reserve that you might be willing 
to pay in a hard currency (of course, this is only if you can 
actually pay in a hard currency). 
Where do you find an agent? Ask the Concierge at any 
major hotel and they can find someone for you. By the way, 
if you find an agent this way, don’t forget to tip the Concierge 
or doorman who made the contact for you. Next, be sure to 
clarify with the agent (before you start looking for a place to 
rent) if you are supposed to pay their fee or if they will get it 
from the apartment owner (if you find a flat). Also, find out 
if they charge a fee for showing you flats or if you pay only 
when you find one. 
There is another way to do this that doesn’t require 
an agent: walk around until you find a building you think 
you would like to live in. Talk to the boheb and ask if there 
are any vacant flats in the building. I can guarantee you 
that the bohebs know more about what is going on in the 
neighbourhood than anyone else, and that includes the 
agents. If there is not a flat available in their building, they 
may know where there is one for a reasonable rate. Don’t 
forget to tip him for his trouble!

 LAUNDRY
Forget laundromats—they don’t exist in Egypt. On the other 
hand, getting your laundry done in Egypt is usually quite easy 
and relatively inexpensive. All major hotels have laundry 
service available. As a local resident, you can get laundry 
services (known as makwagis) in all neighbourhoods around 
 Cairo. Other than doing laundry yourself, sending clothes to 
a makwagi is the traditional method. Things to remember 
when sending your laundry out are to communicate exactly 
what you want done and make a list of what you send. 
These days, clothes are sometimes dry-cleaned instead of 
laundered, even underwear. So, be sure to check! If you do 
not want clothes washed in hot water, tell them. If you do 
not want bleach added, tell them. If you want clothes dry-
cleaned, tell them. Most clothes will come back ironed, so if 
you do not want clothes ironed, again, tell them. If you do not 
state precisely what you want, you may be surprised with the 
results. Unless you have someone that you know who hand 
washes clothes, do delicate items by hand at home. If you 
have a family or expect substantial laundry needs, consider 
purchasing a washing machine after you get to Egypt. 
A washing machine will cost a lot, but you can probably 
sell it when you get ready to leave. One of my flats had a 
washing machine in it and I admit it was great for sheets. On 
the other hand, it was cheap and easy to send things out, so 
I definitely wouldn’t buy one for myself. 
 MEDICAL CARE
Especially in the major cities, access to fairly good general 
health care services is readily available. However, you should 
do some pre-planning to ensure you won’t have to take 
whatever you can find in an emergency or when someone 
gets sick. Like almost everything else in Egypt, medical care 
facilities run the gamut from little or nothing to a few hospitals 
equipped with the most modern technology.
Just as in a move to any other new city, it may be best 
for you to make contact with a physician upon arrival to 
find someone you like and can trust. For example, many 
well-trained and knowledgeable specialised physicians are 

133
The Logistics of Settling In
professors at the University of Cairo Kasr el-Aini Medical 
School or Ain Shams. These physicians typically also have 
a private practice office (called a surgery or clinic) where 
they see patients at various hours of the day. This is not 
eight-to-five medicine. Physicians may see patients at their 
clinics at all hours of the day and night, depending on their 
personal schedule. Make sure to find out when your doctor 
sees patients, how to contact him/her at all hours, and what 
you need to do to make an appointment. Also, find out 
at which hospitals the physician sees patients. This may 
make a difference in choosing a physician for a long-term 
relationship. Surprise of all surprises, many Egyptian doctors 
will come to your home or hotel to see you.
Generally speaking, Egyptian physicians practise a more 
humanistic type of medicine than most Western physicians. 
This means that they listen to your symptoms, may palpitate 
as needed, but rarely utilise extensive laboratory measures 
for most common ailments. However, there are excellent 
laboratory facilities available when needed. They do not have 
a queuing system such as occurs in Great Britain and in some 
managed care programmes in the United States. What this 
means, in practical terms, is that if what you need is available 
and you have the money to pay for it, you can reasonably 
expect to be able to get the service you need.
It is always advisable to discover the locations of hospitals 
in a new place. In the event you might need one, it seems 
best to know approximately where it is located in the 
city and which one you would want to go to. Numerous 
‘private’ hospitals exist in and around  Cairo and  Alexandria. 
Designation as a private hospital may be somewhat different 
than you are used to in your own country. A number of these 
small private hospitals are owned by one or more physicians. 
Just because a hospital is called a private facility, it does 
not mean that it will be a big, technologically sophisticated 
facility. Most small private hospitals are essentially open-air 
medical facilities. That is, they do not have sophisticated, 
recirculating air heating and/or cooling units with closed, 
sterilised wards or rooms. Instead, most small hospitals are 
built more on the traditional Egyptian pattern, with open 

134 CultureShock! Egypt
doors and open windows throughout. Most commonly, small 
Egyptian private hospitals are equipped to handle general 
medical problems, with only somewhat limited access to 
surgical procedures or physical therapy. Only a few major 
hospitals are built on the Western model and equipped with 
modern technology. Get an up-to-date listing of hospitals and 
doctors from your Embassy.
It will probably be in your best interest to make sure any 
specialised health service you need on a maintenance basis 
is available before going to Egypt. For example, if you are 
going to need allergy injections on a regular basis, you may 
want to bring the vaccine with you to cover the time you 
expect to be in Egypt. In this case, you might also want to 
be sure to purchase a disposable syringe at a local pharmacy, 
just in case the doctor you go to only has reusable syringes. 
Similar precautions should be taken for situations such 
as diabetes.
Unless you are coming from a cholera prevalent area, 
no immunisations are required to get into Egypt. However, 
some potentially life-threatening diseases occur often enough 
in Egypt to warrant consideration of immunisation prior to 
arrival. Immunisations to consider include: Viral Hepatitis A 
(HAVRIX); Hepatitis B; Typhoid; Poliomyelitis; and Tetanus/
diphtheria. A final issue to discuss with your physician is a 
pre-exposure rabies vaccine. Anyone having the pre-exposure 
rabies vaccination series will still have to undergo post-rabies 
treatment, but the treatment is milder than for someone who 
has not had the pre-exposure vaccine. 
 Immunisation Guidelines
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, 
Georgia, has immunisation recommendations for travel to Egypt. 
The latest assessment from the CDC can be accessed at: 
http://www.cdc.gov/travel/. 
Similar programmes and recommendations exist through major 
public health entities or from your government in most countries 
throughout Europe. Check with your physician before leaving for 
Egypt to ensure that you have all recommended immunisations.

135
The Logistics of Settling In
 Pharmacies
Small pharmacies are located throughout Egypt. Many 
medications that require a doctor’s prescription in North 
America or Europe can be bought over the counter in 
Egypt. To purchase narcotics, you will need a prescription 
from an Egyptian physician. Frequently, there will be a 
physician at the pharmacy; in fact, the pharmacist may well 
be a physician. In general, you can find most prescription 
medications at a good pharmacy in Egypt. You can usually 
also find foreign made, imported or less-expensive Egyptian 
made brands. Although I admit I have taken some Egyptian 
made medications with no bad effects, I suspect the quality 
control of the foreign brands is significantly higher. The 
difference in price is worth it for the quality control during 
manufacture. If you know you must have a specific brand or 
a very specialised medication during your residence in Egypt, 
best to bring a supply with you just in case that brand is not 
imported to Egypt. If you bring in meds, be sure to keep any 
prescription medication in its original container with the 
label attached to avoid any possible confusion at customs. 
It is usually recommended that you also bring a copy of the 
physician’s prescription with you. I have never had anyone 
check, but just as sure as I say that, the next time through, 
my medications will be scrutinised!
Most commonly used medications, though definitely 
not all, are available in some form in Egypt. However, 
pharmacies may run out of the very thing you need or may 
have drugs commonly used for an ailment, but not the 
one you want. Also a particular medicine may be available 
in a syrup instead of a pill, or vice versa, but available. 
For example, I once desperately needed a specific kind of 
asthma inhaler. The pharmacist had inhalers, but none with 
the specific composition I needed. Another time, I needed 
an expectorant cough medicine and was able only to find a 
cough suppressant medication. In this case, I did not know 
a chemical name I needed, so the pharmacist kept bringing 
me the wrong medicine.
It is best to know what medicine you want to buy when 
you go to the pharmacist. But even if you do not know what 

136 CultureShock! Egypt
medicine you need, the pharmacist will gladly recommend 
medication based on what you tell him/her you need it for. If 
you do know what medicine you want to buy, such as a type 
of antibiotic, be prepared to give the pharmacist the generic 
or chemical name of the medication. Do not count on being 
able to find the brand named drug sold in your country of 
residence. Those who use oral contraceptives or hormone 
replacement therapy should bring their own brand since local 
pills may cause side effects due to different compositions 
or dosages.
 Optical Supplies
If you wear glasses or contact lenses, you will be significantly 
more comfortable if you bring spares with you to Egypt, just 
in case you break or lose them. At the very least, bring a copy 
of your lens prescription with you. Egyptian optical shops are 
sometimes difficult to find and often have erratic hours, but 
you can get both single and bifocal lenses replaced. Small 
repairs are relatively inexpensive and most optical shops can 
accommodate you.
When you try getting something like glasses replaced, 
remember that it probably means you will be operating 
on Egyptian time. So, if you should break your glasses 
and actually need them to function, you could be out 
of luck for some time. The alternative, of course, is to

137
The Logistics of Settling In
have someone from your home mail you a spare pair. 
This can be quite expensive, but you could probably get 
them faster than having a new pair made in Egypt. Never 
trust the regular mail with something like this, but use 
one of the express mail carriers. The same applies to 
prescription sunglasses. Good sunglasses are definitely 
a necessity to combat the glaring sun and blowing sand. 
You can find good sunglasses in Egypt, but they might 
be expensive. 
If you wear contact lenses, take special precautions. You 
may experience discomfort wearing contact lenses in Egypt’s 
arid environment. Add air pollution and blowing sand, 
and contact lenses rapidly become painful and in need of 
replacement. Even if you have worn contact lenses for years, 
you should bring a backup pair of glasses for those days when 
your eyes are irritated by the environment. Many people 
have found that they cannot wear contact lenses at all in 
this environment. You are able to purchase some imported 
disposable contact lenses in Egypt now, but not all and you 
cannot count on being able to get the strength you need in 
a timely fashion.
Also, be sure to bring any specialised cleaning equipment 
for contact lenses with you. Contact lens supplies such as 
sterilised wetting solutions can be found fairly easily, but as 
in the case of prescription drugs, specific brand names may 
not be available, so any specialised formulas you require 
should be brought with you.
 BABY SUPPLIES
Baby formulas, such as Similac, SMA and Nestle are available 
in powdered form in Egyptian pharmacies or markets. 
You can also find items like cough syrups for infants 
and Vap-o-rub. 
Things you should bring with you if you have small children 
include training pants, receiving blankets, crib sheets, a play 
pen, door gate, extra baby shoes (at least one size ahead), 
car seat or stroller, baby thermometer, diapers and rubber or 
plastic pants. Disposable diapers are available, but they are 
very expensive. I have seen suggestions to bring a blender 

138 CultureShock! Egypt
to prepare baby food, but I personally think you are better 
off purchasing a blender once you get to Egypt. 
 TOILETRIES
You can find most types of toiletries and cosmetics in  Cairo 
and  Alexandria (but not necessarily in the smaller cities). They 
may or may not be the brand you are used to. If you prefer 
specific brands of, for example, antiperspirant, cosmetics or 
shampoo, bring them with you or take a chance of having 
to use another brand. You should also bring insect repellent 
and sunscreen lotion with you if you require anything 
above SPF15.
Even when I go for short visits, I always take a small first-
aid kit with me. You can buy these ready packaged or you 
can make one yourself. Don’t forget bandages, individually 
wrapped alcohol swabs and, especially, an antibacterial 
cream. If you have very sensitive skin, take a tube or two 
of some type of cortisone ointment for those pesky itches. 
Special skin cleansing supplies for acne should be brought 
with you. Some other items you may wish to bring are hair 
curlers, tampons (very expensive where available), panty 
liners and hair dyes, along with anything you need to go with 
them if you want to maintain comparable tints.
 SPECIAL FOODS
Before you leave, take stock of what particular processed 
things you really can’t live without. For instance, one of the 
things I must have is Picante Sauce, which is not available 
in Egypt. On the other hand, all the things you need to 
make a really good salsa are there, so if you don’t have to 
have the store-bought kind, you will do fine. A lot of foreign 
products are not likely to be found in Egypt. One of the 
things to consider stocking up on before you come are those 
handy little packets of sauce and seasoning mixes. Special 
ingredients for Mexican foods are not always available, so 
bring your favourite chilli mix. 
Other things you cannot find (at the time of writing) 
include decaffeinated coffee and tea. The same goes for 
salt substitutes. Diet sodas are now widely available. There 

139
The Logistics of Settling In
is one type of artificial sweetener but individual packets of 
that are rarely available in restaurants. If you are addicted 
to Koolaid, Gatorade and Crystal Light, try changing your 
taste to a local drink mix or bring a bunch with you. Instant 
coffees are stocked, but individual bags for brewing a cup 
of coffee are not. If you must have brown sugar, maple or 
corn syrup, shortening, chocolate chips, cream of tartar, 
pecans and mincemeat—bring them with you. Don’t forget 
your favourite cookbook! Another tip: if you find a particular 
grocery product on the shelves one week, you might not find 
the same thing for some time. It appears to depend on what 
gets through customs and how often. It is sort of like shopping 
at Sam’s Club in the US (except for the sizes)—you never 
know for sure what you will find from one time to the next. 
For example, I like a kind of canned soup. I was so excited 
one day to find it on the shelves at the Metro market where 
I usually shopped. So, I bought one or two cans (more than 
enough for what I would use that week or the next). I forgot 
that once that case of soup was gone, it might be some time 
before I could find some again. In fact, it was a couple of 
months before another shipment arrived on the shelves. 
 KITCHEN AND HOUSEHOLD SUPPLIES
Bring whatever favourite kitchen utensils you think will make 
you feel at home. There is nothing worse than not having your 
favourite things in the kitchen, especially if you have to cook 
every day. Now this doesn’t mean you should transport your 
whole kitchen! In fact, the older I get, the more I am in favour 
of just getting everything there! It is easier and not terribly 
expensive; besides that way, everything works with the 
current. Many flats will come with minimal kitchen supplies 
and you can always supplement these in Egypt. I am now in 
favour of buying all small kitchen appliances when you get 
there unless your appliances are wired for 220 current. If you 
are coming from the US, remember that your appliances do 
not have the right current for Egypt. If you insist on bringing 
your own small appliances, such as toaster ovens, toasters, 
coffee grinders, coffee pots, microwave oven, mixer, food 
processor, blender, etc., from the US, remember to bring 

140 CultureShock! Egypt
power strips. If you do this, then you will only need to buy a 
voltage transformer. You can buy one in  Cairo.
Some people prefer to purchase everything in Egypt; 
use your judgement based on your budget and length of 
stay. Remember, if you import appliances under temporary 
admission in your air freight, you are supposed to take them 
out of Egypt at the end of your stay even if they no longer 
work. So don’t throw away those broken appliances if you 
import them this way. 
Bring lots and lots of plastic storage bags, ties and 
sandwich bags. Ziplock bags are not available in many places. 
Measuring spoons and cups are not in cups or ounces, so 
if you cannot make the transition to metric, you should 
definitely bring these. The only things you really must bring 
are just your special kitchen things. Paper napkins, paper 
towels, waxed paper, aluminum foil, linens, utensils and 
tableware are available at local markets. Pesticides and 
cleaning supplies are also widely available.
 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND EQUIPMENT
Certain adaptations are required for using American 
 appliances in Egypt. Things to consider include voltage, 
cycles of alternating current, plugs and wall sockets, wattage 
and power surges. To use American appliances, you must 
have adapters, voltage converters, transformers and voltage 
regulators. If you plan to bring small American appliances 
to Egypt, you will need to know the following.
Egyptian  current ranges between 220–240 volts (but can 
drop to well below 200) alternating at 50 cycles per second. 
Egypt’s voltage can be brought down to 110–120 by using 
converters (for small appliances) and transformers (for large 
appliances). Voltage converters come in two sizes: one for 
appliances using up to 50 watts, and another for appliances 
using 50–1,600 watts. Converters do not work on appliances 
over 1,600 watts. 
Egyptian outlets are the ‘Continental’ type, requiring 
plugs with two round prongs. These are different from 
British plugs that have two slightly shorter, slightly fatter, 
round prongs.

141
The Logistics of Settling In
The difference between 50 and 60 cycles is not significant 
for most equipment—most simply run more slowly. Cyclical 
differences cause a problem with items that use alternating 
currents to produce a given speed of operation, e.g. clocks. 
Some modern appliances operate on direct current, thus have 
no problem. Others can operate on either 50 or 60 cycles. 
Check your appliances to see if they will work at 50 cycles 
before bringing them to find out. 
Since Egyptian current varies between 200 and 240 volts, 
voltage regulators/stabilisers should be used to convert an 
uneven voltage input to a rather steady output. Voltage 
regulators/transformers are available in Egypt. These will also 
convert 220 volt current to 110 volt current. My experience 
is this: I have shot fire out of more than one hairdryer at 
my head and somehow managed to come out with my 
hair intact. Since then, I got wise and bought a cheap 
hairdryer in Egypt! It works without me trying to figure 
out what kind of transformer I need. I have also burned 
up a printer and several other things over the course of 
a few years. 
A special note for those bringing  computers. Prior to 
leaving, determine what you will need to operate your 
computer on 220 volts 50 cycles. You may only need to flip 
a switch on the back of the computer to change currents. If 
your computer doesn’t have that, you will need a transformer 
to convert the current to 110/120 volts 50 cycles. A voltage 
regulator is definitely a necessity to protect the computer 
from current fluctuations. Blank CDs and diskettes can 
all be found easily in Egypt, though are probably much 
more expensive than bringing a large package from your 
home country.
 TVs, Radios, and VCRs
US-made TVs (NTSC system) will not work in Egypt (which 
uses the PAL-SECAM system), but you can purchase sets in 
Egypt. VCRs are available in Egypt that adjust to all three 
systems, but they are expensive. You will need a shortwave 
radio receiver if you wish to get Voice of America or BBC 
radio. The best thing is to get satellite dish for TV—once it 

142 CultureShock! Egypt
is installed, my experience is that the price is right and the 
service is good. 
 MONEY AND BANKS
There are over 100  banks in Egypt and numerous joint 
ventures and specialised banks. There are also more than 20 
foreign banks represented in Egypt. To  open a bank account 
in Egypt, you will need your passport. It is best if someone 
local goes with you who knows the bank’s procedures; but 
if not, you can handle it yourself. In order to get a hard 
currency account, e.g. a US dollar account, you must deposit 
a minimum amount of money in that currency to open 
the account. Then, if deposits are made in that particular 
currency, you may withdraw funds in that currency. 
Otherwise, you may find that sometimes hard currencies are 
not available to purchase or are hard to find. For example, if 
you have Egyptian pounds and want to change them to US 
dollars, frequently there are no dollars to buy. I don’t think 
I have ever been able to exchange my Egyptian money for 
US dollars or Euros when leaving the country, even 
though you are supposed to be able to do this at the 
airport bank.
Most private  transactions in Egypt seem to be by cash 
or credit card. The good news is, banks are seemingly 
everywhere in Egypt. Furthermore, in some of the larger 
hotels, you can find them open most hours of the day. Banks 
typically close on Fridays, Saturdays and often for several 
hours during the afternoon. Some exceptions to this rule 
are the banks located in major hotels, which may be open 
24 hours per day, seven days per week. Other banks, such 
as at the airport, also operate special hours due to the high 
tourist traffic. 
Exchanging  foreign currency or cashing major brand 
traveller’s cheques is rarely a problem. You will need your 
passport to exchange money or cash traveller’s checks. ATM 
machines are now located in many of the larger hotels, 
so in an emergency (and assuming the system is working 
at both your home bank and in Egypt), it is possible to 
directly get funds from an account at your home bank. 

143
The Logistics of Settling In
For long-term residents, establishing a bank account at 
one of the larger international banks located in Egypt is 
probably easiest. Cashing foreign cheques, other than 
traveller’s checks, can involve a quite lengthy procedure, 
often taking several weeks before you can get the money. 
I managed to withdraw money from my Check-Cash 
card at a local bank whenever I needed money, and 
only had a problem once or twice with the system being 
down somewhere. You cannot do this at every bank, 
but it is easy to find one that will get you cash with 
these cards. 
Internationally recognised  credit cards, such as American 
Express, Visa and MasterCard, are accepted in many places 
throughout Egypt. Some places that accept credit cards have 
different rates for credit cards and cash. When you plan to 
make a purchase, it is best to ask in advance if there is a 
difference in cost. Small shops, local services, local businesses 
and, of course, the multitude of private vendors on the street 
do not accept credit cards. For these you will need cash. 
When in doubt, just ask.
 COMMUNICATION
 Mail Services 
Forget snail mail! If you actually want to send something 
by snail mail, the Central Post Office in  Cairo, located in 
Midan el-Ataba, is open 24 hours a day. All other post offices 
are open from 8:30 am until 3:00 pm every day except on 
Friday when it is closed. Most major hotels have outgoing 
post boxes. Stamps are available at most hotels and you can 
post items from the hotels.
There are several ways to send packages overseas. An 
export certificate must first be obtained at the Central Post 
Office. Usually, the store from which an item was bought 
will take care of these formalities for you, for a small fee. 
Several express mail carriers, for example FedEx and DHL, 
also have offices in  Cairo and  Alexandria. They are expensive, 
but will also take care of all formalities. The best way to get 
things back-and-forth is through friends and relatives that 
are travelling. Seriously! 

144 CultureShock! Egypt
Phones 
Forget everything else and just go straight to the nearest 
centre and get the latest and greatest in telephone 
communication—a  mobile phone. (They are called cellular 
phones in the US and mobile phones in Egypt.) It is 
inexpensive and, for most people, a necessity in Egypt. If 
you truly do not want anyone to be able to find you easily 
by phone, skip this paragraph and see the information below 
on landline service. Practically everywhere you go, mobile 
phones ring, beep or incessantly play tunes while people 
scramble to retrieve them from their pockets or bags. Don’t 
be surprised to find your tour guide sporting the latest model 
and having an email address, something unheard just a 
few years ago! Pretty much all of the inhabited parts of the 
country are covered by mobile communication but, certainly, 
there are still areas off the beaten path that do not have 
cellular service. If you are planning on taking a mobile phone 
into Egypt, you need one that is of GSM (Global System for 
Mobile Communication) technology (900 mHz). Rate plans 
abound that include services for short- and long-term mobile 
users. I actually found that my international calls were no 
more expensive using my mobile phone than if I went to a 
phone centre. By the way, whenever you talk from a cellphone 
(calling or receiving), it is still considered a long distance 
call—even if you are calling a phone in the next room! 
Egypt’s  landline telephone system has improved 
tremendously in the past few years, but is still far from perfect 
in outlying areas. Two new private telephone companies that 
own public phone booths may be found around stations, 
in main squares and hotel lobbies. Both have prepaid 
phone cards that can be bought almost anywhere and used 
throughout Egypt. Some store owners may permit limited 
calls to be made from their lines, but you should always 
offer to reimburse them for the service. Telephone offices 
also have a large number of phone booths for both local and 
overseas calls. 
I used to go to one of the major hotels to make  overseas 
calls. I now either use my mobile phone or go to one of 
the phone centres because it tends to be less expensive. 

145
The Logistics of Settling In
However, it is nice to know that most of the better hotels have 
telephone services that can connect you directly to major 
international telephone company operators such as AT&T, 
Sprint or other major international telephone companies. If 
you have a calling card from the company, your call can be 
charged directly to your bill. Otherwise, you may pay directly 
to the phone service at the hotel. In any case, there will be a 
small charge for using the hotel service. Most international 
telephone companies now allow collect calls to be placed 
from Egypt, but these have to be made through these 
international companies. 
Many rented flats and houses come with telephone lines 
installed. If your flat does not have phone lines installed, it can 
take some time to get one without a rather large payment for 
immediate service. Even on home phones, calls are charged 
by the time used, not a flat user service rate. 
 Faxes
Commercial fax service is widely available throughout Egypt at 
business centres located in most ‘better’ hotels.

 Internet 
Wow! If you’ve been to Egypt before 1998, you won’t believe 
the communication transition! Mobile phones and the Internet 
have changed the complexion of Egyptian communication 
with the rest of the world. Egyptian Internet usage is one of 
the fastest growing in the world. A few years ago, few outside 
the government or universities had webpages. Now, even the 
famous Khal-el-Khalili has a website for ordering via a secure 
webpage! (http://www.virtualkhan.com)
It was late in 1996 when Internet Café pioneered cybercafés 
in the  Cairo area, opening two Internet cafés—one in Garden 
City and one in Maadi. Now, cybercafés and Internet services 
are available throughout the country. Cybercafés have popped 
up in most major cities (which is really great for an Internet 
junkie like me!) and are now on just about every corner (it 
seems!) in  Cairo and the major cities. I don’t believe you are 
more than a few minutes’ walk from an Internet café any 
where in Egypt; and it seems as if everyone you meet has

a hotmail or yahoo address. On top of that, Internet service 
is free in Egypt, so if you have your computer and a phone, 
you can get dial-up service free (let me warn you though, the 
free service is painfully slow!!!). Internet café providers offer 
email access, worldwide web access, Telnet and FTP, web 
design and hosting, and cybercafé and network solutions. 
Some will even let you hook your laptop up to their system 
to download/upload. Also, all major hotels (and some that are 
not so ‘major’) have business centres with Internet access.
Whether you pop into a cybercafé as a visitor to the 
country or have a long-term service contract (incidentally, 
rates are reasonable), you are never more that a few minutes 
from contacting friends around the globe! Just type ‘Egypt’ 
into any search engine to get a glimpse of what’s new and a 
happening event within the country. 
 PETS
From all accounts, taking a pet to Egypt presents no major 
problems. I have never tried it. Be sure to consult the airlines 
and a veterinarian about carrying cases, etc. The Prevention 
of Cruelty Society and some airlines offer pamphlets about 
preparing your animal for a long journey. Any animal brought 
in must have a veterinarian’s certificate on the veterinarian’s 
letterhead indicating the animal is healthy and has had an 
anti-rabies vaccination. This document must be certified by 
the authority under which the veterinarian operates. The pet 
must be examined within 14 days of departure. Even with 
this document, Egyptian agricultural officials may, if they see 
fit, hold the pet in quarantine for up to 15 days at a minimal 
cost per day, excluding food. All expenses for the animal 
must be borne by the pet owner. You should try to make 
arrangements through company officials in Egypt, a friend 
or your travel agent to make sure the Egyptian Veterinary 
Department at  Cairo airport is alerted to the fact that you will 
be entering the country with a pet. There will be a minimal 
entry tax for dogs. Once this is paid, the animal will be issued 
an identity tag which should be attached to the collar for easy 
identification.  Cairo has a well-equipped, excellent veterinary 
hospital, should one be needed.

148 CultureShock! Egypt
Of more concern is repatriating the animal upon leaving 
Egypt. For the US, this is no problem. Again, it requires 
health and vaccination certificates. For the UK, animals are 
currently required to be placed in quarantine for a period 
of six months when they enter the country. The best thing 
to do if you are planning to take an animal is to check with 
the nearest Egyptian Consulate as well as with your local 
government authorities to check any restrictions that may 
be imposed.
Boarding facilities for pets are extremely limited in Egypt. 
So if you plan to travel within Egypt, you should consider that 
you will have to get a pet sitter or neighbour to look after 
your pet while you are gone. Imported pet food is available, 
but expensive and only a liminted number of brands are 
available, so many people make their own pet food. You can 
add pet vitamins and mineral supplements to the items that 
you bring with you. No prescription pet foods are available 
in Egypt. 

149
The Logistics of Settling In
Pets cannot run free due to the large number of loose 
animals with diseases. Rabies is fairly prevalent among the 
stray cats and dogs around Egypt. Given this, you might 
want to consider bringing baby gates for doors so you can 
keep the animal contained easily within a small space in 
your residence. 
Many Egyptians do not like dogs. Some of this feeling 
relates to traditional roles of dogs and the number of strays 
running around loose in the cities. In addition, those with 
conservative interpretations of Islamic tradition tend to 
regard dogs as dirty. These people, especially, do not want 
to touch or be touched by a dog. This is something to keep 
in mind when hiring people to work in your home. Make 
sure anyone you hire knows there is a pet in residence and 
what rules apply regarding the pet’s treatment. Unless you 
know a person likes dogs (and yours in particular), it is best 
to seclude the animal when friends come over. That way, no 
one is insulted or uncomfortable. 
 SERVANTS AND SERVICE PEOPLE
If you have never been able to afford a maid or a cook, 
this may be your chance. One good way to find a reliable 
and honest household servant is to ask among friends that 
already employ someone. You can also ask your building’s 
boheb. You will likely find that whoever works for your friend 
will have a relative or friend that is just what you want. If 
your friend’s employee is a good person, they are unlikely to 
suggest anyone of lesser character because to do so would 
make them look bad.
Once you have found the perfect person/s to work in your 
household, several etiquette factors come into play. People 
who have never had servants may actually find the situation 
uncomfortable. How do you treat a servant? Preconceived 
notions abound, from treating them like one of the family, 
to treating them ‘equally’ to anyone else who enters the 
household, to talking down to your servant. Certainly, it is 
never appropriate to talk down to a servant, either in private 
or in the presence of guests. To do so in front of guests 
would make you and them lose face, and cause you to lose 

150 CultureShock! Egypt
the respect of your Egyptian friends. You can also count on 
any mistreatment on your part getting around through the 
local grapevine.
What if you are more inclined to treat your servant as a 
member of the family? Or, what if you have sincere notions 
about equality and are afraid any act that treats the servant 
differently implies unfairness? Well, there is definitely a 
middle ground that is appropriate in Egyptian society. The 
basic rule of thumb goes something like this: private and 
public behaviours are different. 
You may well develop a warm and personal relationship 
with your employee, often sharing jokes and laughter 
together. In fact, it is quite appropriate for you to develop 
a feeling of responsibility, much like a family member 
would do. This includes being very generous with your 
employee, especially with things like surplus food, and 
clothing or other items you no longer need. Because they 
feel you are like family too, you may find them asking you 
for help with medical expenses or in a family emergency. 
This is normal and expected behaviour—it does not mean 
they are trying to take advantage of you. As their employer, 
you are in some ways responsible for them just as if they 
were members of your family. If you feel you cannot afford 
to give them all that they need or feel it is too much, at 
least give them something to show your concern for their 
well-being. Not to do so would be an insult. If you are 
concerned that the amount requested is too much, ask 
your friends to see what would be appropriate. Then, if 
need be, you can arrange to take some of it out of your 
servant’s wages in the future. One of the things I do is to 
always save my empty plastic water bottles to give to my 
maid because she recycles them. 
This is the private side of your relationship with your 
servant. It is reserved for when outsiders are not around. 
When outsiders are around, especially other Egyptians, 
behaviour changes. In these situations, servants should 
be accorded the opportunity to show others how well they 
do their job and provide a service to you. For you to do 
any work in front of others that should be their job will 

151
The Logistics of Settling In
embarrass them and your Egyptian guests. It is a matter 
of pride and respect for them to want to do all the work 
by themselves if others are present. For example, you and 
your cook may well have worked together making table 
arrangements or preparing the meal for a dinner party. This 
is all well and good. But when the guests arrive, you should 
not be seen doing any of the work. If you do, it implies that 
your server or cook is incapable of doing the job for which 
he or she was hired. It also shows you do not know how to 
behave properly.
Showing Respect
Never hesitate to say ‘please’ or ‘thank you’ to your domestic 
help when the situation warrants. Just like anyone else, servants 
appreciate the simple courtesies and actually expect to be treated 
with this type of respect by Westerners.
Making friends with  shopkeepers, taxi drivers and 
other people you meet in your daily activities can provide 
one of the greatest ways to get to know about Egypt and 
Egyptian life. Don’t be surprised if you are quickly invited 
for a dinner or to make social visits. In these cases, you 
should remember that they may not really be able to afford 
your company, to be able to receive you properly. Go, but 
remember that frequent social visits may place a financial 
hardship on the family. Since you may find you really enjoy 
the friendly company of someone who can’t afford your 
visits and you would like to continue the relationship, take 
gifts or find some other way to compensate your host. 
You could do something as simple as asking them to do 
some little job for you so you could make sure they had extra 
money. For women, you might suggest that the wife give you 
cooking lessons or teach you how to go to market properly. 
You could always buy enough groceries for two families and 
share this with them. Or, you could buy them something in 
which they showed a special interest. Any little thing like this 
would give you the opportunity to give important, needed 
gifts and not take advantage of your friend’s hospitality. 

152 CultureShock! Egypt
Making the Effort
Once, some friends of mine were going out of their way, spending 
money to be with me and my group that I knew they couldn’t 
afford. I tried all sorts of ways to try to help with the ﬁ nancial 
responsibility I knew they could ill afford. I arranged for them to 
have a special dinner and cake for their anniversary; I took presents 
to their daughter—things that I knew might be outside their budget, 
but wanted or needed. Once, when the wife was taking us to the 
beach and had forgotten her sandals, I gave her mine, insisting I had 
another pair upstairs. When I left the country, I had all sorts of clothes, 
toiletries and things that I insisted she take, either for herself or to 
give to someone she thought might need or want them. Use your 
imagination and you can come up with all sorts of ways to relieve 
your friends from the ﬁ nancial burden of their culture’s generosity 
without insulting their hospitality. 
MISCELLANEOUS NECESSITIES
Things that drive me crazy are bathroom things I don’t 
have or can’t find. There never seem to be drain plugs that 
fit anywhere. Bring several of the wide, flat ones (rubber 
deteriorates very quickly in Egypt). In an emergency, I have 
actually used plastic bags, but this is definitely not the long 
range solution! Another handy thing to have around is a 
small household tool kit. Include things like picture hangers, 
hammer, small nails, etc. 
Sometimes it gets pretty cold and a sleeping bag is a 
lifesaver during winter months. It is also handy for overnight 
trips to the desert. Remember, many places are not heated 
and it can definitely get quite cold during winter nights. I have 
been known to sleep under blankets, in a sleeping bag, while 
wearing a sweatsuit and long socks on the coldest nights. 
This makes it tolerable, but not necessarily cosy.
I think a small daypack is an absolute necessity for each 
person (except small babies, of course). The kind that is 
most comfortable has a foam rubber pad directly next to 
your back. I put little combination locks on zippered waist 
pouches and backpacks to insure that anyone trying to get 
stuff out of them has to cut them or slash them off me. At 
least, I am more likely to know it has happened than if they 
just have to unzip the bag. While I am thinking about it, in 
a really crowded place, you can wear your backpack on the 

153
The Logistics of Settling In
front. Personally, though I hear there are pickpockets in some 
places in Egypt, I have never had anything stolen. But I am 
more cautious when I am riding the underground railway 
or in a crowded train station. Other miscellaneous items to 
bring with you include: sewing items like buttons and pins, 
velcro, skirt hangers, mattress pads (haven’t seen one in 
Egypt), a non-disposable flashlight, special holiday things, 
sheet music if you are a musician, extra guitar strings, etc., 
and hobby supplies. Definitely don’t forget your children’s 
favourite games and toys! Only some Fisher-Price and Lego 
toys and games are available in Egypt. Bring pictures to hang 
on the walls. Nothing can be more depressing than bare walls 
or nothing to remind you of home.

The Egyptian railway system covers over 7,000 km 
(4,350 miles). Principal routes connect  Cairo with  Aswan,

155
The Logistics of Settling In
The Ramses train station in  Cairo is the usual starting 
place for most trains heading out to other cities.

156 CultureShock! Egypt
 Port Said, the Suez and  Alexandria. There are three 
classes of service offered. Third class is Spartan and rather 
uncomfortable. Second class is most useful for short distances. 
Neither third nor second class is air-conditioned.
First class trains provide air conditioning, meal service 
or dining cars, and some even have sleeping compartments 
for major routes. Refreshment services customarily offer 
sandwiches, sweets, pastries, coffee, tea and other beverages. 
Reservations may be made at the Midan Ramses Station 
in  Cairo, the Central Station in  Alexandria, or through any 
travel agency. Be sure to make reservations in advance, 
not only for sleeping berths, but also for seats on regular 
trips. Unless there is a breakdown, Egyptian trains operate 
on schedule.

 Buses 
 Cairo buses used to scare me to death. Just the thought 
of trying to get on one seemed an impossible task, and 
the thought of getting on and never being able to get off 
flashed through my mind. Fact is, public buses in Egypt can 
be great fun and economical, but very uncomfortable and 
time-consuming. Local buses in  Alexandria are much less 
troublesome and easier to use than those in  Cairo. By the way, 
in Egypt, driving is on the right side of the street—American-
style—so bus stops will be on the right as well.
Buses are definitely an economical way to get about. 
Buses and minibuses have numbers prominently displayed, 

157
The Logistics of Settling In
usually in the front window and/or on the side of the bus. 
Unfortunately (if you are new to Egypt), many are printed 
only in Arabic numbers, but some also display English 
numbers. Unless you are getting on a bus at one of the 
main stations, you need to be able to read the numbers 
quickly because the buses may not come to a complete 
stop, but only slow down. Sometimes the buses are full 
when they pull into a station, and even fuller when they pull 
out the other side a few seconds later. You enter through 
the back door. Don’t wait for people to queue or offer to 
let you go in front—they probably won’t. You just have to 
push and shove your way onto the bus. You leave the bus 
through the front door, so if you aren’t going far, better 
start squeezing your way forward as soon as you get on. 
At some point during your journey, a man will manage 
to find you to sell you a ticket, so have correct change 
handy. Buses are great places for pickpockets and the 
occasional pinch, with all those people squashed together. 
Therefore, take particular caution with your wallet, purse and 
money pouch.
There is a pamphlet, sold at newsstands, that lists all 
bus routes for  Cairo’s buses and minibuses. Unfortunately, 
it is only in Arabic, so may not be of much help. You will 
need to know what number bus or minibus will get you to 
your destination. Sometimes people are helpful, sometimes 
they are not. If the bus is stationary, the easiest way to find 
out where a bus is going is to simply yell your proposed 
destination. The driver (or passengers) will either wave you 
on or off to another bus. Another strategy, if you don’t speak 
Arabic, is to have someone you know write your destination 
in Arabic on a small slip of paper. (By the way, this also 
works well with taxi drivers.) You can then hand the paper 
to the driver who will tell you if you have the right bus. 
Unfortunately, this only works with stationary buses. You 
probably want to make your first trip during off-peak hours 
when buses are a little less crowded.
Minibuses are definitely a little easier than regular 
buses. Supposedly, rules limit the number of passengers on 
minibuses, and people are not allowed to crowd each other 

158 CultureShock! Egypt
or stand. Like many rules in  Cairo transportation, I have 
yet to see one where every inch of standing space wasn’t 
taken, often with extra people hanging on the side steps of 
open buses.
Several other types of buses operate in Egypt. In smaller 
towns and villages, as well as in  Cairo, private micro-buses 
(vans or trucks) meander through the streets. They do not 
have signs, so it is difficult to tell exactly where they are going 
or if they follow a specific route. If you think you want to get 
on one, yell out your destination as it passes. If the driver is 
going there, he will stop for you. 
Everywhere you look, you will see tour buses prominently 
marked. These are private buses run by agencies, which 
operate package tours with stops at places of archaeological 
or other tourist interest. Many tourist (excursion) buses 
offer excellent services from  Cairo to major destinations 
throughout Egypt. Inter-city buses provide an easy way to 
get from one major city to another, particularly from  Cairo 
north and eastwards, to  Alexandria,  Port Said, Ismailia and 
the Suez. First class buses and jet buses have limited seats, 
usually 40. Your ticket will give you an assigned seat for these 
buses, which are air-conditioned and quite comfortable. Some 
provide a snack service and videos. You will have to pay for 
the snacks if you order.
A rare sight—an uncrowded bus pulls into the bus station before it was 
moved from  Midan Tahrir.

 Taxis 
Taxis are everywhere. To get one, keep your eyes peeled for 
an empty one and simply wave your arm. In some cases, 
even a taxi with a fare will stop and you can share the taxi. 
There are two theories on figuring out how much a taxi should 
cost. When you are new to the area, negotiate the fare for 
your trip before you enter the taxi. Once you enter the taxi, 
they have you and the rate will surely be higher. Some taxis 
have meters, but they rarely work, so you are on your own 
to get a good rate. Plan on being ripped off until you get the 
feel for looking like you know what you are doing. 
Things You Can Count On 
 Taxi fares are higher around tourist areas.
 As a foreigner, taxi drivers will always try to charge you more 
than an Egyptian for the same service, no matter how good a 
negotiator you are. 
I do not negotiate taxi fares in and around  Cairo anymore 
because I have pretty much ﬁ gured out how much it should cost. 
However, I ﬁ gure I always pay a pound or two more than an 
Egyptian would pay. 
Still, taxi rates are reasonable and one of the most 
convenient ways to get around in Egypt. Once you begin to 
know your way around your favourite places, you will even 
be able to tell the driver the easiest way to get to where you 
want to go. You will also know reasonable fares and be able 
to state the price you are willing to pay up front, eliminating 
the bargaining. 
Until then, be prepared for drivers pretending they do not 
know how to get to your destination (even major landmarks) 
and taking you for long drives through the city. Should you 
come across one of the few totally unscrupulous taxi drivers 
that refuses to take you where you want to go without 
unscheduled stops at an uncle’s or brother’s or sister’s shop, 
simply refuse to get out of the taxi when he stops. If he says 
he won’t go further unless you get out, get out and walk off 
yelling to try to get the attention from a nearby policeman or 

160 CultureShock! Egypt
shop owner. In most cases, someone will come out and take 
your side. Egyptians do not like cheats either. If this doesn’t 
work, take the taxi driver’s number (listed on a plaque or 
paper in the taxi) and report him to the authorities. I honestly 
don’t think reporting a taxi driver to the authorities does any 
good and is really more trouble than it could possibly be 
worth. I just put that in to satisfy anyone who really wants 
to follow that path.
The second strategy is to not negotiate the fare. If you look 
like you know what you are doing, you will be better able to 
get away with this strategy. It is difficult to give an accurate 
fare range because prices seem to change with the cost of 
petrol. As a starting point, a fair rate for going across  Cairo 
(about a 30-minute ride) is about E£ 5, or a bit more. Very 
short rides should go for around E£ 3. Please remember that 
these prices depend heavily on the price of petrol. If petrol 
prices double, taxi fares should increase substantially. After 
all, taxi drivers need to make a living, too. Longer journeys 
will still need to be negotiated. Don’t be surprised if the driver 
wants significantly more, but keep trying to negotiate a lower 
fare. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. Get out, 
say ‘thank you’ and walk off. 

161
The Logistics of Settling In
A strategy I learned from a long-term expatriate to ensure 
drivers don’t demand more than the negotiated fare or more 
than you know is reasonable is this: always carry a large 
quantity of very small Egyptian bills—25 and 50 piastre 
notes are best. When you get to where you are going, do 
not pay the driver while you are sitting in the taxi. Get out 
of the taxi, making sure to take all of your belongings with 
you. Then hand the driver a wad (not neatly folded stack) of 
small denomination notes through the front window. Taxis 
are not air-conditioned, so the windows are always down 
and provide an excellent way to pay the driver. Then walk 
away. Unless you have tried to cheat the driver, by the time 
he has counted the money, you will be well on your way. 
Never try to cheat a taxi driver. They can, and do, yell loudly, 
attracting the attention of numerous police standing around 
with nothing better to do than settle the dispute. Even if you 
do not have piastre notes, small bills are always better than 
large ones. Some drivers may not have change, or at least 
say they don’t have change. 
By the way, a word of warning for women riding in taxis: 
do not ride in the front seat or next to the driver unless you 
are willing to run the risk of the driver’s hands wandering a 
little. While they would never consider such affronts to an 
Egyptian or  Muslim woman, foreign women are fair game. 
One reason for this is that no  Muslim or Egyptian woman 
would place herself in the position of being accessible to 
such confrontations; therefore (according to their logic), if a 
woman places herself next to a man, it must be for a reason, 
so it is all right to touch her.
The  Metro 
The Metro in  Cairo is exceptionally good, especially when 
compared to the time needed for the bus or a car. It 
provides the fastest and easiest way to get around  Cairo 
if you are going near to the places it connects. The Metro 
system is modern, air-conditioned and clean throughout, 
and is getting a face lift. The Metro provided rides to 
approximately 2 million passengers each day. To keep 
the system top-notch, construction of additional lines and

modernisation of the 13-year-old system was approved 
on an urgent basis. Old wagons and their air conditioning 
system will be refurbished, new wagons will be added, 
and new locomotives will be added. In addition, the 
line between Old El Marg and El Marg El Gedeeda will 
be doubled. 
Station names can be confusing, so be sure to know the 
station name that takes you near to where you want to go. 
Line 1 runs from Helwan north-east to El Marg station. Only 
five stations in central  Cairo are underground. Line 2 connects 
the Shobra to the Giza Suburbs station taking a tunnel under 
the  Nile. It crosses Line 1 at the  Mubarak and Sadat stations, 
so you can change lines here. Line 2 does not go all the way 
to the  Pyramids, but comes close. If you take it to the Giza 
Suburbs stop, you will be very close to Giza Square where 
you can take a taxi, bus or micro-bus to the pyramids. Line 
3 was originally planned to run from Embaba in the north-
west to Salah Salem in the east crossing both existing lines 
in the city centre. Later the project was modified and the 
eastern leg will now end at the Airport. After Ataba (Line 
2), it will continue towards the north-east through Abbasiya 
and Heliopolis. In the west, a branch from Kit Kat Square 
to Mohandiseen was added to the project. Line 3 will be 
33 km (21 miles) long, with 29 stations, of which 27 will be 
underground. It will be built in four phases. (See the  Cairo 
Metro map on the facing page.)
Finding stations is easy. Look for the signs with a big red 
‘M’ in a blue star. The underground stations usually have 
several exits, so you need to know which one takes you where 
you are going above ground. If you go out the wrong one, 
you can end up a block or more from where you intended. 
By the way, the first car (two cars during peak hours) on 
each train is reserved for women only. You will occasionally 
see women in other cars, but women definitely prefer the 
women’s cars (no pinches there).
About halfway down the steps to the Metro stations or 
outside the gates of the Metro station, posted signs indicate

on the spot that can be both expensive and time-consuming 
by the time you get it paid. 
 Trafﬁ c
Hang on to your hat, now you get to experience Egyptian 
traffic, Cairo-style! Traffic in  Cairo is notoriously horrible! 
Most people tell you there is no logic to driving in Egypt. 
Egyptian traffic does not defy explanation, but it does take 
some understanding. 
 Cairo driving is extremely aggressive. The first rule is, if 
there is room for your car, take it. If there is not and you can 
bluff someone else, go for it. I have been in small buses whose 
driver bluffed out larger buses by sheer guts. Other drivers 
have bumped vehicles to get a space first. I have even had 
drivers pull bumpers off parked vehicles because ‘they were 
parked too close to the corner (to make a turn) and should 
have known better’. 
If you arrive at night, you may get a special treat. People 
drive with their lights off at night going as fast as room 
allows. Several explanations have been given for driving 
at night without lights such as ‘I don’t want to bother the 
driver in front of me’. Others think keeping lights on bothers 
oncoming traffic or runs the battery down. 
Just ﬁ nd a spot and squeeze in on one of Egypt’s crowded streets.

165
The Logistics of Settling In
Another thrill is heading into oncoming traffic when 
you least expect it. If you are on a road and there is room 
in oncoming traffic, your driver may dart into oncoming 
traffic ‘lanes’. I say ‘lanes’ because some major streets 
are actually divided. However, traffic lane markers and 
stripes are not painted on many roads. When lane 
markers are painted, it is usually on major motorways 
or thoroughfares. Even on motorways, lane markers are 
frequently ignored. There appears to be no such thing as 
a ‘no-passing’ zone.
Just to give you a feel for some of the situations you 
may encounter, I will relate a few of my own experiences. 
When out on a motorway, my driver saw nothing coming 
towards us, so took the oncoming traffic lanes to get around 
slower vehicles. Also, my drivers have plunged headlong 
onto crowded one-way streets in the opposite direction of 
the traffic to shorten the journey. Little bumps between cars 
are frequent and many of the vehicles you see in Egypt 
have numerous dents. Since traffic is slow much of the 
time, small bumps rarely cause major injury within  Cairo 
(unless, of course, a pedestrian or similarly unprotected 
individual is struck). A basic tip is to expect anything—you 
will probably experience it sometime during your stay. If 
you are squeamish, definitely do not ride in the front seat 
of a bus or car. 
Caution
Unless you are accustomed to extremely aggressive driving 
(neither the Los Angeles Freeway nor Houston trafﬁ c constitutes 
extremely aggressive driving to me), do not plan to drive in Egypt. 
Until you get accustomed to driving habits, it is probably best for 
you to use local taxis, buses or the Metro. 
The principal branches of Egypt’s motorway network are:
  Cairo to  Alexandria (desert and Delta routes)
  Cairo to  Port Said and Ismailia
  Cairo to Suez
  Cairo to el-Fayum

167
The Logistics of Settling In
  Cairo to  Aswan
 Suez to Hurghada
These routes are kept in good condition. A new addition 
to  Cairo’s roads is the ring road or beltway designed to 
deflect traffic away from the downtown area. The ring road 
is the modern, divided, multi-laned motorway that facilitates 
getting from one side of the city to the other. Other main 
motorways are paved, but frequently in need of repair. 
Remaining roads are dirt. Desert tracks lead to the secondary 
oases, but are recommended for only highly skilled drivers 
with knowledge and experience in desert driving.
Travel Permits
Travel permits are not required for motorists using the major 
routes in Egypt. However, certain roads may be used only if 
you are in possession of permits. These routes include:
 the secondary roads of the delta 
 the coastal road to Libya 
 the track along the  Suez Canal between Ismailia and Suez, 
the Sinai, Saint Catherine’s Monastery 
 some roads leading to the oases, especially those to Siwa 
and Bahariya. 
Travel permits may be obtained from the Travel Permits 
Department, located at the corner of Sharia Sheikh Rihan 
and Sharia Nubar in  Cairo.
You should also be aware of the dangers of off-road travel 
in Egypt. Old mines from previous conflicts remain buried 
in some areas of the country. Minefields are not easily 
recognisable because signs do not mark them. Instead, 
areas containing mines are enclosed by barbed wire, so 
you should definitely not drive into any such enclosed 
areas. Another clue that you may be in an area where 
old mines remain are deserted tank embankments. Also 
avoid driving through built-up sand on roads. These may 
hide land mines that have shifted due to flash flooding in 
desert areas.

Important  New Trafﬁ c Regulations
‘Bulletin! Egyptian driving patterns to change!’ Sure, you 
say! Well, I don’t believe it either, especially anywhere 
outside the downtown city areas or maybe near certain 
checkpoints. Egypt is a world leader in auto accidents. 
Consider road conditions hazardous anywhere outside the 
main cities. People drive fast at night with no headlights, 
through blowing sand, while weaving among the occasional 
donkey cart with no markings meandering down the 
motorway. In the past, going where you wanted, when you 
wanted, and how you wanted was normal Egyptian driving 
practice. To give credit where credit is due, the government 
recognises the magnitude of Egyptian traffic morbidity 
and mortality. 
Responding to numerous horrific traffic accidents, the 
People’s Assembly passed stringent new traffic laws in January 
1999. Sounds like a good move that will make a difference. 
In fact, the new law did not seem to make much difference 
to traffic fatalities. A report published in 2008 stated that the 
average death toll for traffic accidents in Egypt was 7,300, 
up from 6,000 in 2002. Over two-thirds of accidents can be 
attributed to driver negligence, the remaining to mechanical 
failure and poor road conditions. Alcohol and drug abuse 
account for some of the worst accidents. Although the law 
has been in effect for several years, traffic deaths are still 
out of control because implementing the law is a problem. 
Egyptians’ flagrant disregard for traffic laws and lack of 
respect for traffic police is the main reason why the law is 
ignored. Things are looking up though! Over 6,000 tickets 
were issued in  Cairo in a two-day period during the first week 
of January 2001. In response, seat belt prices skyrocketed. 
New Law Penalties
Under the new law, substantial penalties apply to the following: 
 failure of drivers and front seat passengers to wear seat belts
 failure to wear a motorcycle helmet
 using mobile phones without a hands-free set while driving
 driving under the inﬂ uence of alcohol or drugs.

 Trafﬁ c Police
Numerous uniformed traffic police occupy small guardhouses 
and corners all along the streets of  Cairo. Their precise 
purpose is a bit perplexing. Increasingly, traffic police actually 
do stop cars to allow pedestrians to cross, especially in the 
downtown and tourist areas. Although traffic police are 
located at most big intersections, they most frequently seem 
to be there for decoration or special circumstances. Traffic 
lights are typically ignored except in the central area of the 
city or at specific times in other areas. Only well versed 
Egyptian drivers can discern the hand signals given by traffic 
police indicating when it is actually time to obey them. Your 
best bet, as a newcomer, is to watch what other drivers do 
and follow suit. Most are at first overwhelmed by the traffic 
and see no logic in its pattern. This is especially true with 
horn-honking characteristic of  Cairo. Note that traditional 
 Cairo horn-honking will get you a fine in  Alexandria, where 
the practice is now prohibited. 
The Art of Horn Honking
In  Cairo, horns seem to be honked incessantly all day and all night. 
There is some logic to the practice. Horns communicate a driver’s 
intentions to other vehicles and pedestrians alike. As a general rule of 
thumb, one honk means ‘I am here and coming’ or is used to signal 
‘thanks’ after passing a vehicle. Two honks mean ‘I am passing you’. 
Three honks mean ‘I am coming on fast—watch out!’ It is actually a 
very efﬁ cient way of communicating in a city where lanes, lights and 
Western rules of right-of-way are non-existent. Automobile lights can 
serve the function of a horn at night, and are used mostly to let other 
drivers and pedestrians know you are coming. Sometimes lights and 
horns are used simultaneously.
Motorcycles, Bicycles, Donkeys and 
Donkey Carts 
Interspersed among the mass of cars zig-zagging and honking 
are people using various other forms of transportation. 
 Bicycles and motorcycles weave in and out among the cars. 
They often have either little horns or bells. Sometimes they 
have neither, and you will hear a hissing sound to warn you 
of their presence. 

170 CultureShock! Egypt
 Donkeys and donkey carts intermingle with car, truck and 
bus traffic on overpasses, main streets and alleys. People 
riding donkeys meander along through the traffic and are 
seemingly unaware of the pandemonium around them. 
Donkey carts are still a popular means of transporting goods 
throughout Egypt. The turmoil of  Cairo traffic provides no 
exception. Drivers just go around these slower forms of 
transport. In many cases, donkeys and donkey carts seem 
to get the right of way, apparently because their movement 
is less flexible. Giza implemented an exception. In July 2000, 
by direction of the Governor, police began issuing fines of 
up to E£ 500 to owners of donkey and horse-drawn carts 
in certain parts of the governorate. This action, designed to 
rid the streets of the traditional cart (caro), should improve 
traffic flow and clean up tourist areas. 
Except in the central business district of  Cairo, you will 
also frequently see people (children or adults) walking or 
herding a water buffalo or goats on the roads or motorways. 
They do not stay on the side of the road, but instead take 
their place on the road or motorway along with the faster 
moving traffic. Camels are rarely seen on the streets of  Cairo 
except around the area of the pyramids or near the camel 
souk (market). Other than for tourist purposes, camels are

171
The Logistics of Settling In
generally used on the farms to transport heavy agricultural 
products such as cane.
 Motorcycles can be a particular hazard if you are not 
careful. They tend to go faster than most cars, and dart in and 
out at an alarming speed. I was actually hit by a motorcycle 
late one evening in an alley near  Cairo’s old medieval quarter. 
It happened because I froze when I heard the motorcyclist’s 
incessant horn beeping. Unfortunately, when I heard the 
horn, I didn’t know whether to move left or right or what, 
so I just stopped, thinking that would give the driver the 
best opportunity to go wherever he wanted. To my surprise, 
the driver was already committed and screeching to a 
stop. He didn’t quite make it before he reached me. Angry 
shop owners immediately came out of shops yelling at the 
motorcycle driver. As far as I can tell, the best approach to 
avoiding collisions with motorcycles is to keep your ears 
perked and eyes constantly alert, especially when on smaller 
streets or alleys.
These traffic patterns hold throughout Egypt. However, 
in smaller cities, traffic certainly is not as congested as in 

172 CultureShock! Egypt
 Cairo. Traffic in  Alexandria is somewhat less troublesome 
than in  Cairo, but faster. Lane markers occur more frequently 
on Alex’s streets, but again are sometimes ignored. Some 
streets, for example the Corniche, become one-way during 
certain times of the day in  Alexandria. One does not go 
against traffic in  Alexandria.
Even with the abundance of automobile and truck traffic 
in  Cairo, most people seem to be on foot. Egyptians walk 
everywhere. When going short distances, a mile or two, 
walking is the most practical means of getting anywhere 
because it is faster.
Survival on  Foot 
Positively the most important skill you must learn is 
pedestrian survival. The key words for pedestrian survival are 
‘situational awareness’. Egyptian drivers are alert not to hit 
pedestrians in case they might have a family member who 
would seek retribution. Do not count on their sharpness for 
your survival! Rural towns are considerably less congested 
than are the cities, but this only means the drivers are less 
alert to wayward walkers. Once you learn to cross the streets 
successfully in  Cairo, and maintain your level of situational 
awareness when being a pedestrian in general, you will 
have the greatest probability of living in Egypt unscathed by 
bumps, hits and slam-dunks. While the same strategies work 
in all areas of Egypt, don’t forget that traffic tends to move 
faster in  Alexandria, so where you might walk in  Cairo, you 
will need to run in  Alexandria.
First, slippery-soled shoes are a hazard. Like streets in 
most places,  Cairo’s streets tend to slope downward from 
the centre. They also tend to be covered with a fine layer of 
the infamous dusty sand. Sand on sloping streets makes for 
bad traction. You never know when you are going to have to 
sprint the extra few feet to avoid an oncoming car picking 
up speed. Unless you want to end up lying under a parked 
car, or worse yet, the moving vehicle, shoes with soles that 
allow some kind of traction work best. 
Second, don’t worry about being at an intersection to cross 
a street. If you want to go across, head out into the traffic 

173
The Logistics of Settling In
like the rest of the population. As previously mentioned, 
rarely do you find places where police or lights stop traffic 
for pedestrians to cross. Even when they do, there is usually 
someone coming around a corner right into crossing foot 
traffickers. So how do you get across? Well, the easiest way, 
when you first arrive, is to find some Egyptians who want to 
cross where you do and go with them. You must be careful 
not to lag behind them, however, because they are probably 
gauging their steps by not only what is coming in one ‘lane’, 
but what is coming in several. You may have just enough time 
to get across one line of cars, and stop as others in the next 
line speed past, only to quickly dart another lane’s worth 
to stop again. It is frequently a zig-zag process. Whatever 
you do, don’t try carrying on a conversation while crossing 
the street. This tends to slow people down and diverts 
their attention from oncoming cars, buses, trucks, bicycles, 
donkeys, donkey carts and motorcycles. Not only must you 
keep your eyes peeled for movement from every direction, 
but you must also keep your ears attuned to the sound of 
hisses, horns and bells. Don’t forget—two-wheeled vehicles 
tend to dart in and out among the bigger varieties and may 
not be visible when you start between two cars. Also, do not 
wait for cars to stop before crossing the street (they likely 
never will, although the occasional Cairene may take pity on 
a foreigner). In really congested areas, slowed or non-moving 
traffic makes your progress easier. 
Third, pedestrian traffic is not limited to sidewalks. Nor 
is wheeled traffic necessarily limited to streets. People walk 
anywhere and everywhere there is room to move (just like 
cars go anywhere there is space, so do people on foot). 
Bicycles and motorcycles weave through pedestrians whether 
on the sidewalk or in the streets. They often appear as if by 
magic out of some little nook or alley between buildings 
which may be hardly perceptible to the newcomer. Again, 
keep your eyes and ears open.
 Asking Directions
If you ask someone for directions, be prepared to get an 
answer. Almost all people are willing to try to help you.

However, they may not know where you want to go. It is a 
typical Egyptian trait to always have an answer to a question, 
whether or not the respondent knows where you want to go. 
It is simply not considered appropriate for most Egyptians 
to say, ‘I don’t know’. Alternatively, a person may indicate 
they do not understand what you are asking rather than 
admit to not knowing what you are looking for. More likely, 
they will point you in some direction whether it is the right 
one or not. The result, of course, is you may find yourself 
wandering in circles when where you wanted to go was only 
a short distance from where you began. Arm yourself with 
an accurate street address if you want to get good directions. 
Getting to the general area of town and simply asking for a 
place name results in many a wild goose chase.
SIGHTS, SMELLS AND SOUNDS
 Air Pollution 
With massive traffic jams and no quality control on exhaust 
systems,  Cairo air pollution at certain times of the year 
gives you the feeling of wandering London during a heavy 
fog—one that smells like exhaust fumes.  Cairo’s air pollution 
is the worst in Egypt. Especially in summer, when heat 
inversions are common and winds from the  Nile are least, 
the air becomes laden with smog. From a distance,  Cairo 
takes on a reddish glow. Smog is distinctly less in winter than 
in summer. It seems that bringing the Metro underground 
railway system online has reduced the air pollution 
somewhat, though smog still remains a serious problem 
in  Cairo.
 Smoking
The attitude of Egyptians towards smoking is best depicted 
at a place called the Piano Bar in the World Trade Centre. 
The so labelled ‘non-smoking’ area is a chair nailed to the 
wall at the edge of the ceiling. Egypt is a land of smokers. 
If you cannot tolerate cigarette smoke, you had best change 
your ways, take plenty of antihistamines or stay out of 
Egypt. There are some non-smoking areas in Egypt but few 
in restaurants or most public places. A few of the better 

177
The Logistics of Settling In
hotels are now advertising non-
smoking rooms. Most cruise 
boats prohibit smoking in the 
cabins. Other than that, the 
only non-smoking zones are the 
Metro, some museum areas, the 
occasional elevator (not all) and 
a few other special sites. 
Smoking etiquette requires 
anyone who is smoking in 
a meeting or group to offer 
everyone else in the group a cigarette. Foreign cigarettes are 
particularly preferred, so be prepared. If you do not smoke, 
do not feel compelled to accept a cigarette when offered. 
Egyptians do not mind if you don’t smoke; however, they 
expect to be able to smoke in your presence in any event. 
Expect your guests to smoke, whether in a business meeting 
or when visiting your home. Your personal preference for 
non-smoking may not count. 
Smoking is a man’s prerogative in Egypt. Egyptian women 
who smoke rarely do so in public. Other than cigarette 
smoking, which is done everywhere, the preferred method 
is the water pipe. Water pipes are smoked in restaurants, 
at home, and in the myriad of small street cafés where 
men congregate, drinking coffee or tea while playing table 
games. Water pipes are called shisha pipes in Egypt, a word 
derived from the Arabic term meaning ‘hashish’. The tobacco 
smoked in these pipes is not hashish. It is a gummy mixture 
of molasses and tobacco, sometimes with a flavour, such as 
apple, added. 
 Noise
Many people find the high noise level in Egypt to be quite 
bothersome. To me,  Cairo seems to be much quieter than 
it used to be. I remember seeing a video once where the 
person was asking for a ‘quiet room’ at an Egyptian hotel. 
Laugh and forget it! If you are looking for silence and solitude, 
I recommend going to the desert alone or another country, 
although suburbs are much quieter than central  Cairo. The 
A Favourite Pastime
Unless there are overriding 
reasons for not smoking in a 
particular place, for example 
sensitive equipment that might 
malfunction with too much 
smoke (such as computers) or 
explosive chemicals, people 
smoke. The best efforts of 
health ofÄ cials are making only a 
minimal impact toward stopping 
or limiting one of the favourite 
Egyptian pastimes.

178 CultureShock! Egypt
only places in central  Cairo that are reasonably quiet are 
some of the interior rooms in the large five-star hotels. Even 
then, traffic noise may filter through the walls. 
What kinds of sounds can you expect? Well, I have already 
alluded to the traffic sounds—horns, cars, trucks, donkey 
carts. Even without these urban noises, Egypt is alive with 
sound. Beginning before sunrise, there are the calls to prayer 
that echo from the minarets of mosques all over the country 
five times a day. The first time the 4:30 am call to prayer 
startles you from a sound sleep, you may shake your head 
trying to figure out what is happening. After a few days, the 
calls to prayer promote a peaceful and stabilising feeling, 
letting you know that all is right in the world.
Another aspect of Egyptian culture is the seeming need 
to have music all the time. Every shop and café, especially 
in the tourist areas, has music playing constantly. And it is 
loud! At first, Egyptian music sounds sharp to the Western 
ear because it is a quarter tone out from Western music. 
Eventually Egyptian music weaves its magic of romance, 
often soulfully singing of unrequited love. Lively belly dancing 
songs incite movement in the most sedate guests.
The noises of Egypt may be disruptive for the first couple 
of weeks but in no time, it will feel normal. After you 
have been there for a while, you will only notice when the 
sounds are out of the ordinary. At this point, silence may 
become deafening.
 Colours of Egypt
Egypt is a country of stark colour contrasts. It is almost 
inconceivable—until you have seen it—to visualise the drastic 
contrast between the desert and the ‘green’. The ‘green’ 
refers to the areas irrigated from the  Nile throughout the 
country. Green areas tend to be a mile wide or less along 
either side of the river. Literally, where the irrigation stops, 
the desert begins. The ‘green’ is often very tropically lush 
with much shade and waving palms. The desert is stark with 
few immediately visible lifeforms.
Except for small areas along the  Nile and parks,  Cairo is 
a palette in monochrome. Buildings made of native stone or 

179
The Logistics of Settling In
concrete match the surrounding desert environment. The 
basic colour of the city is a slightly greyer shade of tan than 
the desert proper, which tends to be a light golden tan with 
a very slight reddish hue. In winter, the sky may be bright 
blue, especially in the mornings. However, even in winter, the 
afternoon sky fades to a lighter shade of blue. Up and down 
the  Nile, morning winter skies are clouded with smoke from 
open cooking and heating fires. The smoke settles along the 
river due to the high population density at the river’s edge. 
During summer months, the sky tends to be a greyish light 
blue that fades into white. The pale sky against the desert 
tan increases the stark contrast between green and desert. 
It also adds to the monochrome effect in cities. Egyptians 
seem to delight in adding colour at every opportunity. 
Brightly coloured household decorations, rugs and even 
clothing sparkle against the sandy coloured world. The style 
of furniture most popular in middle and upper class homes is 
rather baroque with intricately carved heavy pieces of wood. 
Couches and chairs are frequently covered in decorative 
brocade fabrics.
 Dirt 
What commonly passes for dirt in Egypt is really very finely 
powdered sand. It is everywhere! Sand blows in the air, seeps 
There is a sharp contrast between the rich vegetation of the ﬂ ood plain and 
the stark environment of the desert. 

180 CultureShock! Egypt
through doors and windows, and even lodges itself under 
the fingernails and toenails. The sand is so finely grained 
that when you rub it between your fingers, it does not feel 
particularly harsh. Sand blows in from the desert and cannot 
be eliminated or controlled, even with the most zealous 
attempts by Egyptians. Shopkeepers and hotel attendants 
constantly wash pavements, foyers and any other surface 
on which dust can collect. Floors are almost constantly 
being swept or washed with soapy water and a squeegee. 
Pavements are frequently hosed down and swept to control 
the dust. 
Truly, nothing works for long. The climate is so arid that 
within minutes, the dust dries, starting its cycle of collecting 
everywhere once again. Most stores, homes and hotels have 
one or two bristle mats for wiping your feet when you enter. 
It is a common courtesy to wipe your feet carefully when 
entering any establishment or home. 
In some cases, when you enter some homes you may 
even be expected to remove your shoes. I have always 
heard of this custom, but have never actually seen it 
practised. So the best advice is, do not remove your shoes 
unless everyone else has removed theirs. Do what your 
host or other guests do. Removing shoes is particularly 
unwieldy to Westerners because they usually wear socks or 
some type of hose to protect their feet from direct contact 
with their shoes. You will find that, except when dressed 
in Western business attire (males and females), most 
Egyptians do not usually wear hose or socks. The most 
common shoes are open, sandal-type shoes. On the street, 
especially among the working class, flip-flops are the shoes 
of choice.
 Waste Material
Initial perceptions of the streets of Egypt definitely shock the 
most experienced of travellers. Everything looks dirty. Part 
of this is due to the monochrome colour of  Cairo. Another 
contributing factor is the result of constant building and 
renovation throughout Egypt. Unused building materials 
and numerous piles of debris are usually left wherever 

181
The Logistics of Settling In
they fall, whether on streets, pavements or roofs. Once 
left, construction litter tends to stay. Clearing debris away 
is clearly a low priority. As a result, much of Egypt looks 
perpetually under construction or as a friend pointed out, 
‘like a war zone’. 
Rubbish collection is a totally different issue. Household 
rubbish is collected regularly.  Cairo’s ‘unofficial’ refuse 
collectors, the Zabbaleen, collect two-thirds of the garbage. 
‘Official’ collectors collect the remaining refuse. The 
largest Zabbaleen settlement is Manshiet Nasser. Their 
entrepreneurial expertise has resulted in an intricate social 
structure surrounding refuse recycling. Here, different 
families specialise in different materials. Families sort 
through rubbish, dividing it into plastics, metals, paper, rags, 
bones and organic matter. 
Trucks are rapidly replacing the customary donkey-pulled 
carts for transporting rubbish through the city. Most flats and 
villas have back entrances where rubbish is collected. 
Refuse and litter present unique problems for most cities 
throughout the country. People drop refuse and litter just 
about everywhere in Egypt. In fact, finding a waste bin 
is almost impossible in most cities. Waste collects on the 
pavements and on the edges of streets—anywhere it can 
find a place to settle. No amount of picking up by people 
employed for that purpose controls the rubbish appearing 
on the streets daily. 
A major exception to the litter problem is the Metro 
system and some newer areas of the city. Waste bins are 
strategically placed at Metro stations. Serious fines and a 
side visit to the local police station can result from failure to 
use these bins.
 Public Toilets
Go before you leave home! Always take toilet or tissue paper 
with you—just in case (if you use them). You might also want 
to carry a plastic, disposable bag for discarding toilet paper 
in case you have to use a local toilet that doesn’t have a place 
to dispose of it. If you plan to be out all day around town and 
need facilities, the best bet is to find a friendly restaurant, 

182 CultureShock! Egypt
order something, and use the facilities there. Public toilets 
are few and far between in most Egyptian cities. They do 
exist although may be overlooked by the casual observer. 
In the older parts of the city, entrances to public toilets 
often look like an entrance to a Metro station (without the 
prominent signs). 
If you have not used a traditional toilet, be prepared for a 
shock. The typical, traditional toilet is a hole in the ground 
with two footplates on either side. Usually, there is a hose 
with a handle to turn on the water for cleaning yourself. The 
hose should be on the left side for easy access by the left 
hand, the one appropriate to use for these functions. If you 
prefer toilet paper, bring your own. Women will find tights, 
leotards and other clothing that must be totally removed to 
be a real problem in traditional toilets. 
Most modern flats, villas, restaurants and hotels have 
facilities with modern flush toilets. Since the system isn’t 
geared to handle large quantities of toilet paper, if you 
see a bucket on the side, place the paper there. If there 
is an attendant, it is appropriate to tip the attendant 
upon departure. 
 FACILITIES FOR THE HANDICAPPED
Do not plan to find mobility ramps for the handicapped in 
Egypt. Some larger tourist hotels have sloped walks useful 
to wheelchairs; however, most hotels, restaurants, shops and 
flats require people to be able to walk and climb some stairs. 
Once into buildings, even though many have lifts, some are 
quite small, designed to hold only two or three individuals. 
Many lifts, especially in older buildings, require the passenger 
to physically be able to close outside doors and interior gates 
as well as run the contraption. Older lifts also have a tendency 
to stop slightly out of line with the floor, thereby making your 
entry or exit hazardous. Access to underground Metro stations 
requires stair mobility. Visits to most antiquities and tourist 
sites also require people to be able to climb stairs and walk 
substantial distances. In general, getting around for mobility 
handicapped individuals is all but impossible without 
hired assistance.

183
The Logistics of Settling In
 ANIMALS
In a society with little mechanised equipment such as Egypt, 
many animals serve as beasts of burden. Bony-looking 
donkeys carry heavy loads and people. Camels are laden 
with loads larger than could be carried in the bed of a 
small pick-up truck. People from societies where the major 
association with animals is through pets and where stringent 
laws regulate animal treatment often find the sight of working 
animals in Egypt upsetting. These animals are necessary 
to ease the human burden in a country that is heavily 
labour intensive. 
Other animals seen frequently in and around the streets 
include stray cats and dogs. It is easy to figure out which cats 
and dogs belong to the streets. They look scruffy, scraggly and 
gnarly. Stray animals hang around docks, hotel entrances, 
alleys and restaurants—anywhere they might find food. Cats 
serve a good purpose by keeping the rodent population down. 
They can frequently be seen wandering around tables or on 
rafters in some outdoor restaurants. 
Expatriates who are not thrilled with their assignments 
in Egypt sometimes refer to stray dogs as ‘tickets’. Many of 
these animals carry fleas, ticks and diseases, including rabies. 
Never feed stray animals as this tourist is doing. Rabies is common 
among strays.

184 CultureShock! Egypt
An expatriate who has been bitten by a stray dog can 
frequently get his company to send him home for medical 
treatment or even reassignment, since it is not likely the 
animal had been vaccinated against rabies and it is usually 
unlikely a specific animal could be identified. Therefore, 
stray animals can be the expatriate’s ‘ticket’ out of an 
unhappy situation. 
The compulsion to cuddle and aid weak, helpless animals 
inclines some people to feed or pet stray animals. Most of the 
strays are around people enough that they are quite docile. 
Many will even come up to you and rub against your leg. Not 
all of them are docile, and one never knows which is which. 
Try not to let your compassion for the strays overcome your 
common sense. 
Unusual Behaviour
There was a female dog that wandered the street where I used to live 
in Garden City. I passed her day after day and nothing happened. 
Then one night, I was walking to the market and she came from 
across the street and snapped at me. Fortunately for me, I saw that 
her behaviour was unusual and jumped away just as she leaped for 
my leg. She got a small bite of my pants leg, but none of me. 
 SHOPPING
Shop ’Til You Drop!
There are more and more great shopping areas in and around 
 Cairo! The highest concentration of shopping malls is in  Nasr 
City, where seven shopping centres are open to the public, 
including Tiba Mall, Genena Mall, Wonderland, City Centre, 
Al-Aqqad Mall, Serag Mall and City Stars. Check out the new 
City Stars Centre Mall located in  Nasr City. The seven-storey 
facility has most of Egypt’s local brand names (including 
Dalydress, Mobaco, BTM and Concrete) along with major 
international brands—some for 
the first time in Egypt—including 
Virgin Megastore, Mango and 
Esprit. The mall also offers a 
wide variety of coffee shops and 
restaurants, and a vast food court 
‘I have never been in a mall of 
this size, over seven levels and 
the Ä nest designs.’

with 12 outlets. City Stars has a multiplex cinema equipped 
with 13 screens and an indoor theme park built on a total 
area of 6,000 sq m (64,583 sq ft). As you would expect, 
high rents in the malls mean higher prices; but, you can get 
things you couldn’t even think about getting in Egypt only 
a few years ago!
Shopping is, at the same time, one of the most fun things 
and one of the most frustrating things you can do in Egypt. 
There are has two kinds of shopping areas: modern and 
traditional. In the better parts of  Cairo and  Alexandria, 
modern boutiques and stores abound with the newest 
European fashions and Western goods. 
The rest of Egypt is full of traditional small shops and 
fairly big department-type stores that sell everything from 
toothpaste to coffee pots and batteries. They are in every 
nook and cranny. Omar Effendi’s (government-owned), 
located in most big cities, is the Egyptian counterpart to a 
Western department store. 
As mentioned previously, markets or souks are easily 
accessible in all towns and cities. In stores and markets where 
you see printed price signs, for example in the windows, 
prices are set. You don’t bargain in these places. Of course, 
you don’t bargain at any of the modern malls either! If you 
are in doubt as to whether a place you are shopping in has 
fixed prices or bargaining, just ask. Sometimes shops have 
both fixed price items and bargaining. 
 Bargaining 
Egyptians love to shop and bargaining is a national art 
form! Bargaining is a challenge that makes shopping really 
fun. It also gives you a great opportunity to get to know 
local people and their ways. Egyptians will bargain for 
everything from carpets to gold to trinkets to bottled water, 
cigarettes, and popsicles. I will briefly describe a typical 
process, but remember, this is only a general guideline. 
Develop your own negotiating style and get into the spirit of 
Egyptian shopping. 
First, you will, of course, see something you want. So you 
ask the price. The shopkeeper gives you a price that is the 

186 CultureShock! Egypt
‘first price’. Depending on the product, this may be as much 
as 500 per cent what the shopkeeper expects to get. More 
expensive items tend to have a lower mark-up. 
Next, you can try telling the vendor you were ‘just looking’. 
At this point, he will typically either ask you what you are 
willing to pay or give you a second or ‘good price’. If you really 
don’t want the product, tell him so. If, after several attempts, 
the shopkeeper won’t take ‘no’ for an answer, you can offer 
an ‘insult’ price. This is a price so ridiculously low that you 
know and he knows you do not expect to get the item. 
If, on the other hand, you actually would like to purchase 
the item, offer a price of, say, 20 per cent of what the ‘first 
price’ was. This process can have several iterations, so that 
before you finally agree on a price you may go through 
second and third or more prices before you get to a ‘best 
price’. Some sellers will go directly to a ‘best price’ after the 
first price if they feel you are a seasoned bargainer. Others 
just like the game.
Local, neighbourhood bargaining or bargaining with a 
shopkeeper or owner of the store with whom you have an 
established relationship is one thing. Any time you shop in 
tourist areas is quite another and may present the problems 
outlined below.
A vendor at a typical tourist gauntlet. If you show interest, be prepared for 
some insistent attention. 

187
The Logistics of Settling In
Shopping in tourist areas can be traumatic. Unfortunately, 
you will probably shop in these areas at some time or other 
since tourism pervades so much of the Egyptian economy. 
Even if you are an expatriate living in Egypt, in tourist areas, 
you are just another ‘foreign tourist’ who is fair game. This is 
where you will typically run the gauntlet of vendors accosting 
you with all kinds of come-on statements and queries. They 
can be terrible pests! It is extremely frustrating when you 
say no and the hawker refuses to accept your answer, then 
proceeds to follow you or grab your arm to ‘escort’ you into 
his shop. If a vendor grabs your arm, feel free to pull it away 
and tell him, very firmly, not to touch you. Vendors know they 
should not touch you and would never consider it proper to 
grab an Egyptian, especially a woman. 
The best way to walk through tourist areas, such as the 
famous  Khan el-Khalili Bazaar, relatively unassailed or 
unhassled, is to develop a posture that gives the appearance 
you know where you are going and what you are doing. 
Impossible at first, but easy to distinguish by shopkeepers 
after you have been there a few times. Also, they probably 
recognise you after a few times (even years later). I don’t 
know how they do it, but shopkeepers seem to have the most 
amazing memories for faces and sometimes names!
Don’t answer queries or respond to statements made as 
you walk among the alleys (unless, of course, you actually 
want to go in to price or purchase merchandise). Foreign 
women often hear comments such as, ‘Darling, I’ve been 
looking for you all my life’ or ‘Darling, I’m what you have 
been looking for all your life’. There is a compelling tendency 
to make a curt or snippy response. Do not give in to the 
temptation. If you give any acknowledgement, you will be 
followed for ages, with the vendor sometimes increasing the 
suggestiveness of comments. 
If you want to somehow politely acknowledge a ‘nice’ 
shopkeeper’s plea to look at his goods, you can refuse to 
make eye contact or speak, but, with your arm by your 
side and hand facing the ground, wave the hand back-and-
forth keeping the palm facing the ground. I sometimes say 
‘la’ shukran’ which translates to ‘No, thank you’. Most will 

188 CultureShock! Egypt
leave you alone after that. It is only the rudest person who 
will harass you after that. 
 Gold 
Shopping for gold requires a special comment. Egypt is known 
for its gold shops. Gold sold is usually 18, 21 or 24 carats. 
Only rarely will you ever find anything of less quality. You 
should see a little scratch or nick on each piece of jewellery 
made with Egyptian gold. This is actually a government tax 
stamp. The stamp is used to certify the quality of the gold 
and that appropriate government tax has been paid on the 
gold used in the jewellery. 
Finding a good gold merchant is not difficult if you know 
a little about how to shop for gold. The most reputable gold 
merchants are always willing to weigh the gold and show you 
the scale to verify the weight. If a merchant tells you all of 
their gold is sold by the piece, not weight, theirs may or may 
not be a good place to buy. Tell them that you want them 
to weigh the piece anyway because you want to know how 
much gold is in the piece. Then you can gauge their price 
by what you feel is an appropriate amount to pay per gram. 
Some very small pieces are sold only by the piece and are 
only rarely negotiable.
Current gold prices are printed daily in most newspapers. 
The price you should pay revolves around this rate even 
though the gold in the jewellery you are buying may have 
been purchased at another rate. The real negotiating area of 
gold prices revolves around the cost of workmanship in the 
piece. The following is just an example because the price of 
gold fluctuates, but should give you a general feel for how 
to bargain for gold. 
If the published price for 18 carat gold is, for example, 
E£ 50 per gram with the tax stamp, you should expect to 
pay somewhere in the range of E£ 60–65 per gram for a 
finished piece of jewellery. Unless the piece has very intricate 
workmanship, you should never pay more than about E£ 10–20 
per gram over the going rate for Egyptian gold—usually many 
times less. Italian gold is also popular in Egypt, but the cost 
is generally higher per gram than Egyptian gold.

 Duty-free Shopping 
Before leaving the airport, most people stop in the duty-free 
shops for last minute purchases. A less well-known aspect of 
duty-free shopping in Egypt is that there are several branches 
of Egypt Free Shops in the country. People entering the 
country are allowed to purchase products at these shops for 
up to one month after entering Egypt. Some items are good 
value and others can be bought less expensively at many of 
the local shops. It just depends on what you are looking for. 

190 CultureShock! Egypt
You will need your passport and maybe your air or ferry post 
ticket to purchase items in these shops.
Additionally,  Port Said is a duty-free zone and many 
Egyptians go there to purchase products that would be more 
expensive elsewhere.  Port Said’s shopping is not as good as 
it was in the past, so unless you are planning on making 
some major purchases, it may not be worth going there just 
for shopping. It is, on the other hand, a delightful city and 
worth the visit if you have time. Buses run from  Cairo several 
times per day and a daily excursion to  Port Said, for whatever 
reason, is quite reasonable. 
 Alcohol 
A word on alcohol is pertinent at this point for one very 
good reason—duty-free stores are the easiest and least 
expensive place to buy imported liquor. Like many other 
 Muslim countries, Egypt does allow alcohol purchase and 
consumption within its borders, but public drunkenness is not 
acceptable behaviour under any circumstances in Egypt. 
Most Muslims do not drink alcohol. Seasoned foreign 
business professionals neither drink alcohol in the presence 
of their  Muslim associates nor serve alcohol in their homes 
when entertaining locals unless they know the person drinks 
alcohol. If you know your Egyptian friend or colleague drinks 
alcohol, then it is like everyone else, you offer. If you drink 
alcohol, it is most prudent to do so in the confines of your 
home, hotel room or in a cabaret in the absence of your 
non-drinking Egyptian colleagues and friends. You will gain 
more respect from your Egyptian colleagues if you follow 
this behaviour (even though it is certainly not required in all 
situations) due to your perceived understanding and respect 
for their religion and ways.
Sometimes my Egyptian friends who have travelled 
outside the Middle East think all Westerners drink alcohol 
and wish to show their knowledge of Western behaviour 
and cultural practices. To make visitors feel welcome, a few 
Egyptians will offer you alcohol or even serve it with dinner. 
Again, although it is not required, you will gain more respect 
if you politely decline—unless the host partakes also.

Some of the oldest known beer recipes come from the 
hieroglyphics of ancient Egypt. Contemporary Egyptian 
beer—Stella Local and Stella Export—are readily available 
at many restaurants, as are some imported beers. Egyptian 
wines, some of which are quite tasty and others not very 
good, are also available at many places in Egypt. 
Buying imported liquor is easiest and cheapest at duty-free 
shops. Otherwise, count on it being very expensive. Imported 
liquor is served by the glass at better hotels and restaurants 
throughout Egypt, where drinks are typically quite expensive. 
You can also buy imported liquor from the few major liquor 
stores, but be sure to ask specifically for imported liquor and 
check the label carefully. 
There are a few small stores located throughout  Cairo 
that sell liquor. Many of the local liquors have labels that 
look just like those of imported liquors with the exception 
that one word on the label may be different. An example is 
the substitution of the word ‘Waller’ on the local variety for 
the word ‘Walker’ on one famous brand of imported liquor. 
Avoid purchasing these imitations, as the contents bear no 
resemblance to their famous imported counterparts. 
Although I have never confirmed the rumour, local folklore 
suggests that the imitation liquors can cause blindness. 
Confirmed deaths and severe illness have occurred as a 
result of alcohol poisoning from these products. This was 
because the principal component of the bottles’ contents 
was rubbing alcohol. Some of the local, cheap liquors have 
very unusual smells and tastes, reminiscent of what could be 
a combination of perfume and formaldehyde. Since people 
scrounge through garbage for empty used foreign liquor 
bottles, which are then recycled to bottle local mixtures, 
you might consider breaking all old liquor bottles before you 
dispose of them to help eliminate this hazard.

best meet the ﬂ avor and nutritional needs of their people.’

CHAPTER 6

193
Food and Entertaining
 DINING ETIQUETTE 
Food is definitely part of the Egyptian expression of 
hospitality and generosity. Now is a good time to think 
about how you personally perceive food and what is 
appropriate social eating behaviour. Where I was raised, it 
was impolite to eat a lot when visiting. If this meant you 
had to eat before you went, OK; but you should certainly 
not appear gluttonous when in public. On the other hand, 
not far from where I was brought up, the customs for 
eating in public differed radically. There, it was considered 
bad taste to leave food on the table. In other words, you 
might have to eat yourself nearly to death, but you must 
eat all that was prepared or risk insulting your host. These 
are polar examples, and your traditions probably fall 
somewhere in the middle. I tell you this because certain 
social rules apply to visiting in Egypt if you want to be 
a good guest. 
First, being a good guest requires you to show appreciation 
for the food offered to you. How do you do this? By eating. 
Being a good Egyptian guest is not a put-everything-you-
expect-to-eat-on-your-plate-for-the-whole-meal-at-one-time 
event. If you do this, you may ﬁ nd you insult your host 
when you refuse to take seconds or thirds. You greatly 
compliment your host by returning for more food, so plan 
ahead to go back for more food. Reﬁ lling your plate once 
is an almost absolute necessity. Going back twice shows

even greater appreciation, but once is certainly enough if 
you can’t possibly hold any more food. More than twice 
is deﬁ nitely too much, however. I ﬁ nally ﬁ gured out that 
putting a little food on my plate (for example, by not trying 
all dishes at once), and spreading the food out a little 
to make the plate look full, meant I had more room for 
seconds or thirds. This works particularly well when food is 
served buffet style. 
What happens if your host serves you a food that you 
absolutely hate and cannot tolerate to even think of eating? 
In my case, this happens whenever I face internal organs 
or seafood. Seafood is easy—I have a medical allergy 
excuse and this is always understood. But what do you do 
if you just absolutely deplore the taste of something being 
served and have no medical excuse? Probably the easiest 
thing to do in order not to insult your host, is to take just 
a little of whatever it is you do not want, then kind of 
move it around with your fork or in some way ‘pretend’ 
to eat it. Never say something like, ‘Oh, I’ll pass on that—
I don’t like it’. 
Taking some of the food offered is especially important 
if the meal is rather formally served by servants to each 

195
Food and Entertaining
individual. In this case, do not pass on a course or dish 
when it is being served, just deal with it after it is on 
your plate. Rarely will a servant refuse to remove your 
plate when the next course is served just because you 
haven’t eaten all of the previous course. Many informal 
dinners at the home of a friend are served family style. 
In this case, many of the dishes will be passed around. 
For other dishes, you will pass your plate for the person 
closest to the dish to place some on your plate. In this case, 
you can say something like, ‘I’ll get some of that in a minute, 
but ﬁ rst I want to try such and such’. With luck, they won’t 
notice that you do not ask for some later. Alternatively, 
of course, just take some. Of course, with buffets, less 
attention will be drawn to the fact that you simply ‘skip’ 
a particular item.
I seem to consistently have vegetarians travelling 
with me. They can run into a particular problem. Many 
Egyptians do not eat meat with every meal, but do serve 
it when guests are present as a sign of respect and/or 
generosity. If you are vegetarian and meat is served 
to you, again it is probably best to take a little and then 
just don’t eat it. If, for some reason, you are asked 
why you are not eating it (highly unlikely), then just 
indicate that for medical (or religious) reasons you do 
not eat meat. 
If you are the host of Egyptian friends or colleagues, there 
is one principal rule for good etiquette—never, ever run out 
of food or appear to be stingy with what you offer! Make 
many dishes and more than you ever expect to be eaten. 
If you are having four people for dinner, cook enough of 
each dish for six or eight. There should always be a lot of 
food left after the meal. Once, when explaining to a friend 
about a wedding I attended, I commented that I had never 
seen so much food at one place in my life. She told me 
categorically that ‘there should be as much food left as 
was eaten after the wedding party was over’. This was ‘to 
show that you had enough for the occasion’. Of course, 
leftover food will not go to waste. You can always eat some 
of it the next day. Besides, if you happen to have servants, 

196 CultureShock! Egypt
it is expected that you would offer some of the excess 
to them.
If you plan to serve food items that essentially are served 
in one-serving (for example, baked potatoes or hamburgers), 
be sure to have plenty of extras. For example, the concept of 
the backyard barbecue, where one steak per person is ﬁ xed, 
is totally incomprehensible. “Why,” the Egyptians wonder, 
“would anyone be so stingy as to ﬁ x each person only one 
piece of meat?” Of course, one of the most important things 
for a host is to be generous, so having a meal such as this 
deﬁ nitely makes you look selﬁ sh! Does it mean you cannot 
have a barbecue? Of course not. It just means you need to 
cook extra.
 RESTAURANTS AND  TAKEAWAY
My favourite restaurant is La Bodega’s in Zamalek. My 
favourite coffee house is Cilantro’s, also in Zamalek. My 
favourite thing to do when I don’t want to cook is go to the 
Otlob.com website (http://www.otlob.com) and order dinner 
to be delivered. Truly, this is a blessing for me. All I have to 

197

do is decide what I want to eat, go to the Otlob site, select 
it, and it’s magic! Thirty minutes later, my doorbell rings 
and there is my dinner—delivered with a smile and I didn’t 
even have to dirty the kitchen. Yes, it’s totally decadent, 
but oh, so nice! If I need to have Texas food (and there are 
those days), I can go to Chili’s or Johnny Carino’s (either 
in person or via Otlob.com). There are so many American 
fast food chains in Egypt, I won’t even bother to mention 
them. However, they are principally located in either  Cairo 
or  Alexandria. If it exists in the US, as a rule, you can ﬁ nd it 
in Egypt. 
MEALS AND FOOD
Except for a few distinctly Egyptian dishes, Egyptian cuisine 
tends to be a combination of Mediterranean cuisines, typically 
Turkish, Greek, Palestinian, Lebanese and Syrian. Over the 
years, Egyptians have modiﬁ ed the ingredients and cooking 
methods to suit local palettes. While a number of spices 
are customarily used, they seem to be used in moderation. 
This gives the food a rather bland taste when compared, for 
example, to Mexican, Cajun or Indian food. Added to the 
standard middle-class diet, you can also ﬁ nd many restaurants 
that serve sophisticated recipes copied and adapted from 
Western cuisine.

 Breakfast
A typical Egyptian breakfast consists of beans, bean cakes, 
eggs and/or pickles, along with bread and nawashef (dry 
foods) or fuul. Nawashef complements the basic breakfast 
and includes dry food items like olives, cheeses (such as 
labne which is a yoghurt-based cheese), jams and perhaps 
slices of cake. Hard-boiled eggs (never soft-boiled), omelettes 
or fried eggs, onions soaked in vinegar and mixed pickles 
usually accompany fuul. 
’Eish baladi, fuul and ta’miya constitute the unofﬁ cial 
staples of the Egyptian diet. The word ’eish (sometimes 
spelled aysh) means bread and ‘life’ in Egyptian—‘life without 
’eish is not life’. ’Eish baladi is a pitta bread, but you can 
also ﬁ nd ’eish fransawi or French bread throughout much 
of Egypt.
 Fuul (sounds like the American word ‘fool’) is boiled broad 
or fava beans. There are three main types of broad beans, 
the basic ingredient in fuul and ta’miya. Fuul roomy are large, 
ﬂ at and whitish; fuul baladi sa’idi, or local Upper Egyptian 
broad beans are whitish and middle-sized; fuul hamam are 
small, round and dark brown in colour. All of these types of 
beans taste essentially the same, but require different cooking 
times. When making fuul, beans are boiled whole for six to 
nine hours over a slow ﬁ re, then mashed with oil, lemon, salt 
and other ﬂ avourings such as crushed garlic, graded onions, 
chopped tomatoes and cumin. 
Ta’miya (also called felafel) are bean cakes. These are 
deep-fried flat discs made from skinned white broad 
beans or chickpeas. Felafel is as much a modern day dish 
as it is an ancient one, although today’s versions tend 
to use chickpeas instead of the traditional broad beans. 
After the legumes are soaked overnight, they are drained 
and minced with dill, coriander, onions, garlic, parsley, 
leek and other spices. In addition to being delightful by 
themselves, ta’miya are great as sandwiches with either 
fuul or tahina sauce (a sauce made from sesame seeds) and 
salad (chopped lettuce and tomatoes). If you buy these on 
the street, be sure to tell the vendor whether you want hot 
peppers added.

199
Food and Entertaining
 Lunch and Dinner
Lunch is the main meal of the day for most Egyptians and 
is served sometime between two and ﬁ ve in the afternoon. 
Dinner is usually more non-specific. Typically, dinner 
constitutes eating leftovers from lunch or is similar to the 
nawashef of breakfast. Starches, mainly rice and bread, form 
the mainstay of the Egyptian lunch and dinner. These are 
usually moistened with vegetables cooked with meat, chicken 
or ﬁ sh. Lunch and dinner may be accompanied by sweets, 
which are puddings, desserts or ices. Beverages served with 
all meals may be hot or cold. All are non-alcoholic. By the 
way, most of the time, if you ask about a meat dish, the 
response will be that it is ‘meat’. On several occasions, I have 
observed people seeking a more deﬁ nitive explanation at a 
restaurant or buffet line regarding what animal or what part 
of the animal was being served. Frequently, the answer was 
simply ‘we are having meat’. Usually lamb will be identiﬁ ed 
separately from beef. 
Meats are largely grilled or roasted, whole or minced 
(ground), with lamb and chicken predominating. You see a 
lot of cows but they seem to serve more as farm equipment 
than beef. The shish kebab style is extremely popular and is 
served either with or without the skewers but always with 
traditional accompaniments: greens and tomato salad, tahini 
sauce and pitta bread. Bread is always whole wheat pitta, 
coated with coarse ground wheat.
Egyptians love tomatoes that always seem to burst 
with colour and ﬂ avour. The traditional salad is chopped 
tomato, coriander, mint, little hot green peppers (not the 
distinct ﬂ avour of jalapenos but closer to serranos) and 
onions, coated with garlic oil. Great for ﬂ avour, but you 
deﬁ nitely will need mouthwash at the end of the meal. 
Aubergines, mashed as the main ingredient in baba ghanou 
(a dip), is also used in Egyptian moussaka with a mild white 
cheese. Okra, cabbage, cauliflower and potatoes show 
up frequently, stewed with tomatoes, garlic and seven 
spices (allspice). 
Rice is universal! The grains mix short basmati-like rice 
with longer brown, nutty-tasting rice. I think the fruits in 

200 CultureShock! Egypt
Egypt taste better than any I have tasted in years, especially 
the different varieties of oranges, lemons, peaches, 
strawberries and melons. However, many of the apples are 
imported and seem to be mealy by the time you get them. 
Egyptian bazaars display staggering amounts of spices, 
sculptured into colourful spice pyramids, from yellows of 
saffron and ochres of curries to deep blues of powdered 
indigo dye. 
 Recipes To Try
Here are two of my favourite recipes, kindly given to me by my 
friend, Amany.
Meatless Stuffed Vine Leaves
Ingredients:
¼ cup olive oil
2 medium onions, minced
1 cup short grain rice
½ cup pine nuts
¼ cup raisins
50–60 preserved vine (grape) leaves
1 tablespoon fresh dill, chopped
½ teaspoon ground allspice
salt and pepper to taste
2 lemons, thinly sliced 
(in Egypt, lemons are like key limes in the US)
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon olive oil
Boiling water
Method:
Heat ¼ cup olive oil in a large skillet. Add onions and sauté until 
translucent. Add rice then sauté until rice is glazed. Add pine nuts, 
raisins, dill, allspice, salt and pepper. Mix well and set aside. Cut 
stems from grape leaves and place in a large bowl. Pour boiling 
water over the leaves. Drain and rinse then leave to cool. Line the 
bottom of a large saucepan with 2–3 large vine leaves. Set aside.

(Continued from previous page)
Place each leaf, shiny side down, on a ﬂ at surface. Spoon 
about 1 teaspoon of the rice mixture onto the centre of each leaf. 
Roll the leaf with the mixure inside, tucking the ends in as you go. 
Place the roll into the saucepan. Continue making more little rolls 
and placing them into the pan until you have one layer of rolls. 
Place lemons slices on top of this layer.
Repeat layering rolls and lemon slices. Invert a heat-proof 
plate on top of the stuffed leaves to prevent the rolls from sliding 
while cooking. Press the plate down gently. Pour in the boiling 
water until it is about 1 inch from the saucepan rim. Cover and 
simmer over low heat for 30 minutes or until the rice is tender. 
The leaves should be tender but a bit chewy. Cool slightly. Arrange 
the stuffed leaves on a platter. Sprinkle with lemon juice and 
1 tablespoon of olive oil.

Bechamel Sauce
Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter
½ cup ﬂ our
4 cups milk
white pepper
a pinch of ground nutmeg
½ cup shredded gouda cheese
½ cup shredded Gebna Roumi (Romano) cheese
2 eggs
Method:
Melt the butter in saucepan, then add ﬂ our and brown. Slowly 
add the milk, stirring constantly with a whisk until it becomes 
creamy. Add the white pepper, nutmeg and cheeses, and continue 
cooking until all the cheese is melted. Leave to cool. Beat the eggs 
and add to the cooled mixture.
You can pour this mixture onto cooked macaroni, zucchini, 
artichokes or browned aubergine before baking the dish.

SHOPPING FOR  FOOD
Butchers, Street Vendors and Food Hygiene
Egyptians are by tradition quite concerned with  cleanliness. 
Part of this is due to the teachings 
in the  Qur’an (the Islamic Holy 
Book). This is evident not only 
in attempts to control nature’s 
sandy penetrations, but in the 
concern with hygiene associated 
with religious practices. All 
exposed parts of the body (for 
example, face, hands and feet) 
must be washed before entering the mosque for prayer. 
Concerns for prayer hygiene do not seem to transcend 
to food preparation habits among many lower- and middle-
class Egyptians. Open-air markets predominate. Food is 
sold, butchered and prepared amid the street clutter. Street 
vendors, small walk-up shops for prepared food and drinks 
and open-air markets abound throughout Egypt. Animal 
carcasses hang in the open air without refrigeration. Dinner 
‘on the hoof’ stands around waiting to be slaughtered or 
sold for home preparation. Look on any street and you 
are likely to see a woman walking with a basket full of live 
geese or chickens on her head returning from the market to 
prepare dinner. 
If you plan to buy your own  meat, it is important to identify 
a good, reputable butcher whose meats are slaughtered at 
government butchering facilities to ensure the least likelihood 
of getting tainted meat. Meat slaughtered at government 
butcheries will be marked by big red stripes painted on the 
sides of the carcass. Probably, the best way to ﬁ nd a good 
butcher is to ask around among your friends or acquaintances 
that have been in Egypt for some time. They will be in the 
best position to tell you the safest places to purchase meat 
and fowl. I admit that I am partial to the Western-styled 
grocery markets where the meat is usually shrink-wrapped, 
such as Metro Markets or Seoudi.
As mentioned previously, food prepared by  street 
vendors or in small local cafés is everywhere in Egypt. In 
A lot of outsiders don’t know that 
desert sand is considered to be 
a cleansing agent under some 
circumstances. For example, if 
a  Muslim is in the desert and 
unable to ‘wash’ with water 
before prayer, he may ritually 
‘wash’ with sand.

203
Food and Entertaining
many of the smaller cities, these are the only places, except 
restaurants associated with hotels, to get prepared food. 
Since many, many eating places in Egypt are open-air or 
in buildings with doors and windows open, again you may 
not ﬁ nd the shiny, disinfected cooking surfaces people 
have come to expect in many parts of the world. Only the 
bigger cities have chain restaurants or four- and ﬁ ve-star 
dining facilities.
Better restaurants and hotel kitchens are usually quite 
clean and sanitary. Great care is taken, especially due to 
concern for tourists, to maintain safe food handling and 
preparation in these establishments. If you are particularly 
nervous about ‘getting germs’, it is probably best to limit 
your eating out to these types of places, at least at ﬁ rst. 
Egyptians everywhere pride themselves on hospitality and 
high quality service. Special care is taken to ensure table 
settings and foods are attractive, clean and pleasant to the 
senses. Courtesy is a given.

Bacterial Remedy
Personally, I tend to ‘eat like an Egyptian’. If Egyptians eat the 
food, I eat the food. But like anyone else, I have particular likes and 
dislikes, so some types of food I avoid. There are a couple of little 
tricks that help avoid some of the most common sources of bacteria 
that can result in diarrhoea, or ‘Pharaoh’s curse’, as it is referred 
to by tourists. Most of the time Pharaoh’s curse is not serious, 
just uncomfortable. One neat trick I learned from my Egyptian 
friends to avoid getting bacteria from salads is to top them with 
freshly squeezed lemon juice or a little vinegar. Whereas cooking 
kills bacteria, fresh salad ingredients harbour the little culprits. 
Anything with a lot of acid will often take care of the squiggly 
bacteria that can hide on freshly washed lettuce, cucumbers and 
tomato skins. One of the greatest street dining delights are felafel 
(fried chickpea or broad bean) sandwiches. They are usually served 
with shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes on top of the felafel 
in a piece of Egyptian bread. Just ask the vendor for a piece of 
lemon and most will gladly accommodate you. I even follow the 
Egyptian style and squeeze lemon on salads at ﬁ ve-star restaurants or 
at home—just in case.
Frankly, if you are going to stay in Egypt for any 
time, you must throw aside some ingrained notions 
of what constitutes cleanliness about food. Eat only 
well done meat, fowl, fish or eggs no matter who 
cooks them. 
Fruits, Vegetables,  Breads and Sweets 
 Fruit and vegetable stalls along  Cairo streets provide you 
with not only some of the best tasting products anywhere, 
but with a visual smorgasbord. 
In stall after stall or in small shops, proud shopkeepers 
display fruits and vegetables at the peak of ripeness. Fruits 
and vegetables are not picked green and stored for days 
or weeks before being transported to market as they are 
in many Western societies. Produce you see at Egyptian 
souks may well have been picked the day before and 
brought by truck or donkey cart to the market overnight. 
Fresh warm bread and sweet pastries make your mouth 
water as you walk among the stalls of souks or meander 
into the corner bakery. Try them. They taste as good as 
they smell! 

205
Food and Entertaining
Fresh fruits and vegetables (above) can be found at many shops in the city. 
These have been picked at the peak of ripeness, not before, so you get only 
the best. Also to be found are roadside stalls selling fresh bread (below). 
They are delicious so give them a try. 

206 CultureShock! Egypt
 Fruit and Vegetable Shopping Hints
 Unless you know that the market person will select good fruit 
and vegetables for you (you only learn this by experience), 
insist that you select the fruits and vegetables yourself.
 Watch carefully to ensure that no rotten commodities are 
slipped into the bottom of your bag or additional items added 
to increase your purchase.
 DRINKING WATER
Most guidebooks warn visitors not to drink the local water, 
eat food on the street or partake of fruits and vegetables 
that cannot be peeled and/or cooked. Only you know your 
own constitution and body’s immune system. I would point 
out that if you are going to be in Egypt for some time and 
plan to follow Western standards of hygiene, you will have to 
sequester yourself in a hermetically sealed room (there are 
none that I know of in Egypt). It is impossible to maintain 
practices foreign to the land for extended periods of time. 
You can buy drinks from these shops but if you are buying bottled water, 
make sure that the seal is unbroken. 

207
Food and Entertaining
Until you can get used to a little dirt and some germs in your 
system, you will have to follow precautions without a doubt, 
but I suspect that this cannot continue for long periods of 
time. Besides, it will not be long before you forget to brush 
your teeth with bottled water (and you will probably ﬁ nd you 
do not get a major case of diarrhoea doing this). 
Most major Egyptian cities state their tap water is potable. 
Cleanliness of rural water supplies is considerably more 
problematic. Usually in small towns and villages, water is 
drawn from wells or piped in, but cannot be considered 
potable. Many people get slight diarrhoea when drinking 
water in rural places. Giardia, one of those bad little parasites 
which lodges in the intestinal tract, is more likely to be found 
in rural rather than big city water supplies. 
One of the habits I ﬁ nd most interesting among some 
foreigners revolves around their obsession for ice in drinks. 
People who religiously carry bottled water so as not to get 
germs from tap water—the same ones who even brush 
their teeth with bottled water—turn right around and order 
ice for their drinks. They never once ask themselves where 
the water comes from that makes the ice. Ice is made from 
tap water. 
A word of caution: if you are buying bottled water, make 
sure the seal is not broken when you get the water. There is 
little concern in big hotels and restaurants. At these places, 
waiters delight in presenting the chilled water bottle, pointing 
out the unbroken seal, and ceremoniously breaking the seal 
for you. On the other hand, some street vendors take old 
 Safety Tips

bottles, ﬁ ll them with tap water and sell them to customers 
as bottled water. If someone tries to sell you a bottle of water 
with the seal broken, politely request another bottle with the 
seal intact. If they say this is all they have, thank them and 
go to another vendor. 
After a while, you will begin to slack off on the bottled 
water and ‘germ-free’ imperative. This is particularly true 
if you are integrating into Egyptian society. When you are 
invited to someone’s home, it is extremely rude to refuse 
your host’s hospitality and not eat their food, whether it is 
a tomato and cucumber salad or fresh grapes. Usually, you 
will be offered a variety of drinks such as colas or fruit juice 
as well as water. If you are still on a strict regimen of bottled 
water, and water is what you want to drink with your meal, 
just take your water with you. Everyone understands the 
newcomer’s concern with drinking water. So, it will not seem 
rude or even unnecessarily strange for you to be cuddling a 
bottle of water when you appear (unless, of course, you have 
been living there for six months or a year, in which case you 
will be perceived to be very strange indeed). 
You will not ﬁ nd chilled, public drinking fountains in 
Egypt, except perhaps in better hotels. Instead, you will 
notice large pottery jugs full of water located at various fairly 
inconspicuous places along the streets. The jugs keep the 
water cool and are there for all to drink. These are public 
drinking fountains, Egyptian-style. You will notice that people 
walk along, stop, say a few words (perhaps), maybe give the 
storekeeper a small tip, pour water into the community cup, 
take a drink of water and continue on their way. Unless you 
are well adapted to Egyptian life, it is probably best to avoid 
drinking from public water jugs.

CHAPTER 7

212 CultureShock! Egypt
THE CALENDARS USED
Business and the secular community operate under the 
Gregorian calendar. However, other calendars have official 
status in Egypt. The Islamic calendar is based on a lunar cycle 
of 12 months of 29–30 days. Thus, the Islamic year is 11 days 
shorter than a Gregorian year. As a result, Islamic holidays 
and feasts occur some 10–12 days earlier each year. 
The  Islamic Calendar
The Islamic calendar was first introduced in AD 638. The 
reference point of the calendar system is the Hejira in 
AD 622, and Hejira years are usually denoted by ‘AH’ (from 
the latin ‘Anno Hegirae’) in Western languages. The Islamic 
year begins on the first day of the first month (1 MuHarram). 
Therefore, the starting date for the Islamic calendar, which is 
1 MuHarram, AH 1, corresponds to 16 July 622 AD. Among 
the  Muslim holidays observed in Egypt are:
 Ras as-Sana (celebrated at the beginning of the Islamic 
calendar, the Hejira) 
 Mouled el-Nabi (the birth of the Prophet Muhammad)
 Eid al Fitr/el-Fitr (end of  Ramadan, see the next section)
 Waaf el Arafa (eve of Adha)
 Eid el-Adha (the Bairam celebrating the end of the annual 
pilgrimage to Mecca)
Note that the Islamic calendar, like any based on 
calculation, comprises only estimated dates. The calendar is 

213
Enjoying Egypt
not based on the actual sighting of the moon, which marks 
the start and end of the month of Ramadan.
The  Coptic Calendar
The Coptic calendar is based on a solar cycle and consists 
of 12 months of 30 days and one month of five days. The 
first day of the Coptic year (month of Toot) begins on 11 or 
12 September each year. Several  Coptic Christian holidays 
are observed by the population. These are:
 Epiphany (celebrating the baptism of Jesus on 19 January)
 Annunciation (on 23 March)
 Easter (celebrated on different dates each year and 
preceded by 55 days of fasting)
 RAMADAN
Ramadan is a particularly important month in any  Muslim 
country. Egypt is no exception. During Ramadan, many shifts 
occur in daily schedules due to the requirement to fast during 
this month. Instead of staying open all day, many businesses 
and shops shorten daytime working hours. In fact, during 
the month of Ramadan, things essentially shut down during 
the day throughout Egypt. 
Egyptians do not starve themselves during Ramadan. 
Basically, the fast simply requires a shifting of schedule 
from primary activity during daylight to night-time activity. 
Each day, the fast is broken by a large meal served shortly 
after sunset. During Ramadan, Egyptians who observe 
the fast arise before sunrise. It is customary to consume 
a fairly large meal before the daily fast begins. As a result 
of eating pattern shifts, activity patterns also shift during 
Ramadan. Egyptians, always prone to night-time activity, 
increase their nightly activity significantly during this period. 
Nights are used for visiting, shopping and some business 
activities. Ramadan is followed by the Eid of el-Fitr, a multi-
day celebration during which families gather for feasting 
and prayer. 
During summer months, activity also picks up significantly 
during the evenings. Postponing activity until night avoids 
the worst heat of the day, but does not necessarily involve 

214 CultureShock! Egypt
a consequent shift in eating patterns. Obviously, observing 
the Ramadan fast during the summer increases the length 
of time between meals. 
As a visitor to or foreign resident in the country, you 
may choose not to follow the Ramadan fast. Even so, you 
should not eat in public if it can be avoided. The major 
general exception to this rule revolves around tourists and 
some tourist establishments. Egyptians in and around the 
tourism industry acknowledge that many tourists to their 
land are not  Muslim. Therefore, many seek to accommodate 
tourists by providing daytime meals to them throughout 
this period. Most commonly, only the larger hotels and 
tour ships accommodate tourists in this way. Even in 
tourist areas, access to everything is limited during the 
day. If you can, buy food supplies you think you will need 
for the next day during the preceding evening. You should 
count on finding restaurants, cafés and most business 
establishments closed during most of the daylight hours 
of Ramadan.

 FESTIVALS
Several major festivals occur in Egypt. January marks the Cairo 
International Book Fair and the International Documentary 
and Short Film Festival. March heralds the Annual Flower 
show at the Orman Gardens and the International Children’s 
Film Festival. One of the most fascinating festivals, the Sham 
el-Nessim (literally the ‘Scent of Spring’), actually traces its 
history back to the time of the Pharaohs. In ancient days, 
Egyptian men gave a lotus flower to their ladies, and families 
took leisurely cruises down the  Nile in flower-decorated 
feluccas. Now, almost everyone celebrates the Sham el-
Nessim by having family picnics in gardens and parks along 
the  Nile. This traditional festival takes place on Monday 
following the Coptic Easter. For horse enthusiasts, check out 
the Egyptian Arabian Horse show.

 Cultural Activities
Lots of cultural activities exist in and around Egypt! You can 
choose from theatre, dance, opera, symphony and cinema 
(foreign and domestic). 
There is something absolutely surreal about going to the 
opera or symphony in  Cairo. Walking through the streets of 
Gezira, with a soft evening breeze blowing off the  Nile never 
ceases to impress me. The new Cairo Opera House (the old

acoustics and several venues for enjoying the arts. As such, it 
has a full calendar of international and national events, both 
from local artistes as well as visiting companies from Europe 
and the United States. To view the calendar of events, see: 
http://www.cairoopera.org/ecalendar/index.aspx
One of the Opera House’s regular acts is the Cairo 
Symphony Orchestra which performs from September 
through June. Their Christmas concerts are fantastic! To 
find out more about the orchestra and their performance 
schedule, visit:

Cultural Centres
Foreign and local cultural centres also offer a variety of activities 
such as language classes, ﬁ lms, exhibits and recitals. In  Cairo, 
some of the more active are the British Council, the Goethe 
Institute, and the American, Austrian, Canadian, French, Italian, 
Japanese and Spanish cultural centres. In  Alexandria, check out 
the American, British, French, German, Italian, Russian, and 
Spanish cultural centres.
Among the other options in  Cairo are the Archaeology 
Club of the American Research Centre in Egypt (ARCE), 
which offers field trips and a series of lectures. You can find 
information about an ARCE chapter near you at: 
http://www.arce.org/ 
The Egypt Exploration Society in Agouza organises a 
programme of lectures on a wide variety of topics, given 
by prominent Egyptologists from all over the world. These 
are held in London, Manchester and  Cairo. Membership 
costs to both archaeological societies is reasonable. You

programmes (see a partial listing of this in the Resource Guide, 
page 318-319). Among these are representatives of the 
Anglican, Protestant, Catholic, Christian Science, Quaker 
and Mormon groups.
There are also several women’s groups that generally 
welcome new members and especially those with interests 
they would like to share. Women should check on the 
Maadi Women’s Guild. This group arranges get-togethers 
and lectures, and offers opportunities for volunteers to help 
several Egyptian charities. The Women’s Association of Cairo 
also offers many opportunities. The Community Services 
Association is a gem, offering lots of classes on a large variety 
of subjects. (See the Resource Guide pages 315-318 for more 
information.)
 Cinemas
Egypt’s cinemas are relatively inexpensive by Western 
standards except during the International Film Festival. 
There are numerous places to see films and you can always 
find the latest Western films in  Cairo close to when they 
open overseas. 
It has been my experience that almost all of the seats 
are good for seeing the films (except the seats at the very 
front) and are quite comfortable. Some of the cinemas, for 
example Genena I–VI and 
Wonderland I–VI, are in huge 
malls that provide lots of 
additional entertainment for 
before or after the show. And, 
don’t forget the MGM at the 
Maadi Grand Mall. These are 
just a sampling for cinemas in 
Egypt. If you want to see films in Arabic, go to Cinema Rivoli 
on 26 July Street in Azbekiya. 
 Libraries and Bookstores
Freed from Persian control in 331 BC by Alexander the 
Great, the Egyptian city now known as  Alexandria became 
home to the world’s most famous library and the world’s

first university. The Alexandria Library housed the largest 
collection of the world’s greatest, most notable works (some 
700,000 catalogued manuscripts from the 3rd century BC). 
There were actually two sites of the ancient library: the Royal 
Library (located close to the harbour within the royal palace) 
and the Daughter Library, south of the city at the Serapeum. 
The Royal Library was destroyed by war in 48 BC when fire 
spread from the dockyards to the city. The Daughter Library 
appears to have lasted until Emperor Theodisius ordered 
the destruction of all pagan temples in AD 391. 
An ambitious international effort to efface the ancient loss 
brought together plans for the new Biblioteca Alexandrina. 
Built near the site of the ancient Royal Library, the 40,000-sq-m 
(430,556-sq-ft) facility houses 4–8 million volumes, 50,000 
maps, 100,000 manuscripts and numerous other materials.  
The Biblioteca functions as a convention centre and tourist 
attraction as well as a place of learning, dialogue and 
tolerance. The complex includes a Library for the Blind, a

Young People’s Library and four other specialised libraries;  
the Alexandria Conference Center; three museums including 
one focusing on science; a planetarium; seven research 
centres; a calligraphy institute, and the International School 
of Information Studies. 
I was fortunate enough to explore the facility shortly 
before it officially opened. It is incredible! One thing I find 
most amazing are the tables and chairs—all ergonomically 
engineered for ease of reading and comfort. However, annual 
library cards are relatively expensive unless you plan to utilise 
the library frequently.
Public libraries exist throughout Egypt, for example the 
new library in the Zamalek neighbourhood of  Cairo (the 
Greater Cairo Library. 15 Mohamed Mazhar Street. Tel (02) 
2736-2278). Many Egyptian libraries are affiliated with 
universities, schools or private associations. Even if you are 
allowed access, you may not find the variety of materials 
you are accustomed to in your home country’s libraries, 
especially in the way of fiction. Some universities allow the 
general public to use their resources as reference materials, 
Viewing the mummy exhibits at the Biblioteca Alexandrina which has, 
besides its specialised libraries, three museums, a conference centre, a 
planetarium and a host of other tourist attractions.

but do not allow individuals to check materials out from the 
library. The American University in  Cairo (located at  Midan 
Tahrir) has one of the better libraries and their bookshop is 
a treasure trove. The library is down the street and across 
from the main entrance to the University. You will need to 
check with the University regarding access to the library and 
hours of operation. Also, check with the various embassies 
to determine what resources they may have available to 
the public. Other than that, a few small private libraries 
exist, but access to them is generally quite limited and very 
hard to find. Definitely check out the Community Services 
Association library. They have a large lending library of 
English-language paperbacks donated by members of 
the community.
If you are addicted to reading and need a new novel

different books. On the other hand, numerous bookshops 
exist throughout Egypt. Most, quite naturally, carry 
predominantly Arabic publications. However, several 
carry rather extensive selections in English, French and 
German. Bookshops range from small, hole-in-the-wall 
places that are musty, dusty and confusing, to well-arranged, 
spacious stores with staff members that seemingly know 
every book in the place. You will not find the huge, mega-
selection discount book stores typical of the United States 
and Europe anywhere in Egypt. Some books are simply not 
available in Egypt. Relatively speaking, books of any type 
are actually quite expensive in Egypt.
Almost all major hotels have kiosks that carry a limited 
selection of English, French and German reading materials, 
including some fiction. Typically, their selections may 
include a few bestseller selections, one or two classics 
and, perhaps, some biographies. Mostly, these hotel kiosks 
carry coffee-table books, tourist books and publications 
related to Egyptian antiquities since tourists represent their 
principal market.
 Television and Radio
A lifesaver to television junkies has been the arrival of 
satellite TV. It has truly revolutionised access to the outside 
world and television viewing. The government does not 
censor programmes that come in over satellite. For example, 
you can now get CNN and the NBC Super Channel. However, 
don’t expect news programmes like the ones you might get 
in the United States. They are not the same and you get the 
international version of the news programmes, which may 
well have very little local US coverage.
Local TV is definitely dreadful for the foreigner, though it 
has gotten significantly better with the new  Nile TV station 
broadcast in English and French to serve the expatriate 
population. The eight local TV stations remain government 
controlled. Two of them (Channels 1 and 3) are mostly 
Arabic offerings. Channel 2 has daily English language 
programming, but much of this is censored. Most English 
programmes are either subtitled in Arabic or dubbed.

222 CultureShock! Egypt
Local radio stations are similarly rough on the foreigner. 
English language news can be heard on FM 95 at 7:30 am, 
2:30 pm and 8:00 pm. This is the foreign-language station, 
which broadcasts from 7:00 am until midnight. Besides 
English-language programming, French, German, Greek 
and Italian programmes are offered. As mentioned earlier, 
a good option is a short-wave radio receiver. Other options 
include tape players, boom boxes and portable CD players. 
A word of caution with these: bring a good supply of tapes 
and CDs with you. The ones you find in Egypt are great for 
local music, but the quality is often inferior. Many are several 
generations away from any original recording.
 Newspapers and Magazines
Several options exist for getting printed news in English. 
Egyptian newspapers definitely slant coverage towards what 
the government wants to see printed, although some lively 
debates do appear. Censorship in Egypt is considerably less 
than in other countries in the Middle East. More than that, 
there is substantially less censorship in Egypt than 15 years 
ago. Is censorship gone? Absolutely not! Many books are still 
deemed anti-Islamic and not available. President  Mubarak 
loosened the reigns on the press considerably, but, if you 
are expecting all-out freedom of the press, it simply is not 
there yet. 
The Egyptian Gazette is Egypt’s daily English-language 
newspaper. Finding the Gazette outside of  Cairo or  Alexandria 
is problematic. On Saturdays, the edition is called the 
Egyptian Mail. For the past few years, Al-Ahram (the Arabic-
language daily) has published a weekly English summary on 
Thursday (also available on the Internet; see the Resource 
Guide for more details). Similarly, a French version is 
published on Wednesday. The Middle East Times is a weekly 
English-language newspaper published on Sunday. Most 
newspapers can also be found on the Internet—just search 
for them by name!
Many major Western newspapers and news magazines 
can be found in  Cairo and  Alexandria. Some can even be 
found in other good-sized cities, but they may be a bit

dated. Among the English-language publications available 
are USA Today, Newsweek and Time. These publications 
are not censored as they are in some other Middle Eastern 
countries (and used to be in Egypt 20 years ago). You 
can find them at the major hotels, a few news-stands 
and bookshops.
Magazines Published in Egypt
Here are several other magazines, which are published in Egypt, 
that are rather good.
 Egypt Today
 
A monthly, local English-language publication that covers a 
range of topics. 
 Sports and Fitness Egypt

 Cabarets and Discotheques
Dancing lights, clinking glasses and loud music hit you 
squarely as you step through the doors into the sanctum 
of Egypt’s response to the Western nightclub. Coloured 
lights playing on silver balls bounce kaleidoscope sparkles 
throughout the room. These are the discotheques frequented 
by Egyptians. 
Everywhere you turn, smiling couples move to the 
tantalising tempos of Western disco and rock music. The 
sounds of the 1970s and 1980s reverberate through powerful 
amps blasting from every corner. Hot spots for unmarried 
Egyptian couples (almost totally upper-class), discos provide 
a haven for the Western-style singles’ life. You can get 
imported alcoholic drinks at many clubs, as well as local 
beer and wine. Dancing is openly flirtatious, though not 
really suggestive.

224 CultureShock! Egypt
Foreigners more frequently patronise another category of 
nightclub referred to locally as cabarets. These are usually 
fairly expensive and often include belly dancers, folklore 
performances, Arabic music and a lavish food spread. All the 
major hotels have floor shows and you can usually combine 
this with an excellent dinner. You will often find that cabarets 
have a cover charge and/or a minimum charge, usually with 
a tax added on at the end.
 Casinos
Casinos operate in only a few of the five-star hotels in  Cairo. 
Egyptian nationals are prohibited by law from gambling 
in casinos, but all foreigners are permitted. If you plan to 
gamble, be sure to make it when you are not out with your 
Egyptian friends so they won’t have to remind you they are 
not allowed. The casinos have everything from inexpensive 
slot machines to large-stake gaming tables. You will have to 
show your passport to get in. 

225
Enjoying Egypt
PROSTITUTION,  HOMOSEXUALITY AND 
EXTRA-MARITAL RELATIONSHIPS
 Prostitution is definitely one of those topics most Egyptians 
do not want to talk about. When pushed, most will simply 
tell you prostitution is illegal. Some will tell you that they 
think prostitution used to be legal; others simply tell you 
there has never been legal prostitution in Egypt. In any 
event, prostitutes do work in Egypt. Historically, prostitution 
used to be associated with being out late at night and 
with the arts, particularly musicians and belly dancers, in 
other words, those who were outside the mainstream of 
traditional Egyptian society. The most famous area, 40–50 
years ago, used to be around Mohamed Ali Street. Now, 
there is no organised district, per se, such as in Amsterdam. 
How do you recognise a prostitute? Again, answers are 
elusive. Most people answer, ‘Well, you just know’. You 
probably will, too.
Gay rights do not exist in Egypt. There is no movement, 
no public acknowledgement for a very simple reason: 
homosexuality is illegal in Egypt. Homosexual acts leave a 
person open to being punished for committing the crime 
of ‘disgraceful impudent acts’. Under this law, a convicted 
person can be imprisoned for up to one year and fined up to 
E£ 300. Usually, this law has not been used against 
Westerners—they are just deported instead of imprisoned. 
This does not mean you definitely will be deported rather 
than imprisoned, however. Recognise this: homosexuality is 
not welcome in Egypt. 
Does this mean there are no gay hangouts in Egypt? No, 
it does not. As mentioned in other sections, friends of the 
same sex may hold hands casually in public without this 
being interpreted as homosexual behaviour. But anything 
that looks like public gestures of affection between persons 
of the same sex (things that are perceived to be homosexual) 
provokes strong negative reactions. Men wearing earrings are 
assumed to be homosexuals! For more information, check:
http://www.gayegypt.com
Messing around with extra-marital heterosexual affairs 
can also result in dealing with the force of the law. A 

226 CultureShock! Egypt
lot of this relates to divorce laws, but laws nevertheless. 
Does this mean Egyptians don’t mess around? No, 
but be assured that discretion is definitely a must! In 
point of fact, they just don’t care about foreigners as 
long as they do not flaunt unacceptable (by Egyptian 
standards) behaviour.
The subject of  extra-marital affairs brings up another topic 
of interest. What about mixed-gender couples who travel 
together or live together? This gets a little tricky and there is 
definitely a double standard. An Egyptian man and woman 
who are not married to each other cannot register in a hotel 
room together under the law. On the other hand, usually 
(though not at all hotels), a foreign unmarried man and 
woman can register to stay in the same room. But a foreigner 
cannot register to be in the same room with an Egyptian of 
the opposite sex if they are not married. So, what do people 
do? They get separate rooms and carry on as before.
 TRAVEL AND TOURISM 
‘Experience Egypt as a guest, not as a tourist’—this phrase 
is from Maryanne Stroud’s website describing her riding 
facilities at Recoub Al Sorat, or Riding the Righteous Path 
(http://www.alsorat.com/index). She and Tracy Karbus, who 
has the riding facility at Abu Sir, Giza, have experienced Egypt 
as tourists and also as residents. As they say, “We know the 
difference... Visiting Egypt in buses that never leave the main 
roads misses the rich cultural diversity here.”

Medhat: ‘Value Added Guide’ 
A chance to experience the rich culture that is really Egypt 
inextricably pulled me toward Medhat when I first met him 
in 1994. I had a group of 14 university students with me, 
and had booked all of our travel 
and tours through an agency in 
the US. As our good luck would 
have it, Medhat turned out to be 
our boat Egyptologist. Medhat 
was (and continues to be) a

breath of fresh air—his English is GREAT! You can understand 
him and he understands you—even most of the subtleties 
of colloquial American English. He actually listens to what 
you want (instead of giving canned speeches), never rushes 
you (unless you are about to miss the boat), and helps tailor 
a visit to Egypt that will exactly fit your needs. He put the 
whole trip (including hotels, boats, transfers, donkeys and 
tips) together for me when I returned a year or so later 
with the next group of university students anxious to learn 
about the real Egypt. The second group had strange (for the 
time) requests—like wanting to ride horses between the 
Great  Pyramids and Saqqara at sunrise or taking donkeys at 
sunrise to the  Valley of the Kings by going up the mountain

actually caught on, along with balloon rides on the Western

I have just returned from a traditional classical tour 
I arranged through Medhat, designed to introduce my sister 
to the classical sites (and more of them than any standard 
tourist ever gets!), as well as to give her an opportunity to 
get to know real Egyptian culture and people. Medhat came 
through again! He can organise penny-pinching tours such 
as the ones I needed with my students or grand elegance 
that includes five-star hotels and boat cruises and a private 
minibus or Mercedes for getting you to and from sites, and 
shopping. The trick is to know what you want, convey it 
specifically to Medhat, then sit back and enjoy a totally 
personalised Egyptian experience. Through Medhat, I have 
come to love his wife and children and the many new friends 
I have made because he was willing to share the real Egypt 
with me. 
Ayman
Ayman, whom I met through Medhat, first told me about  the 
Exodus tours he was doing in the Sinai in the mid-1990s. 
He now specialises in ecotourism, principally in the  Western

Ayman’s adventure tours are personally designed for two-

If you like the adventure of going behind a sand dune for a 
bathroom, cooking out over an open fire, and sleeping under 
the stars—in general, being with nature in the desert—this 
is the place to go. If you really want to do a Sinai tour, he 
still does that as well. 
Arabi
Arabi (I also met him through Medhat) is the only person 
I know who actually had a crocodile on his roof (yes, a real, 
live one). The crocodile is now dead, but the memory lingers. 
Arabi knows an incredible amount about the flora and fauna 
of Upper Egypt. He will happily take you on a tour of a Nubian 
village; name every kind of bird you see in the nature reserve 
in  Aswan; and even show you a banana farm and water 
buffalo (up close and personal). If you watch closely, you will 
probably see him dip his cup in the cold, rushing river for 
a quick drink while you are out skirting between the rocks 
and reeds of the  Nile.
Take a tour with Arabi and be introduced to the rural side of Egypt like these 
water buffalo taking a cool dip in the river.

Touring Egypt
I suppose if there is any place on earth where going to 
tourist sites is one of the most exhilarating experiences you 
can have, it must be Egypt. I try to think of something that 
competes with it, but sheer size and number of meaningful 
sites in Egypt boggles the mind. On the down side, it can be 
very hot, sticky and dirty. Blowing sand and sweaty tourists 
crammed together at almost all of the sights continues to 
detract from the sheer magnitude of the antiquities. I have 
yet to find a good time to visit the Egyptian Museum. There 
is no traffic pattern and too many people at any given 
time, but, you absolutely must see  Tut’s mask and funerary 
objects. Fortunately, a new museum is being constructed 
though I don’t anticipate seeing it for at least ten more years. 
Hopefully, I am pessimistic in this estimate. Of course, if you 
are not interested in antiquities and the growth of human 
civilisation, you should probably go somewhere else instead 
of Egypt. If it is your first time to travel around the country, 
you might as well start with doing the classical tours. Go to 
Jackie, the author’s sister, getting a henna design painted onto her hands by 
a Nubian lady when she visited Egypt for the ﬁ rst time.

the pyramids—yes, all of them. I fully admit to being a total 
sop when I first saw the Great  Pyramids of Giza—yes, I started 
crying. I couldn’t help myself. 
So what is the best way to go about touring Egypt? The 
answer depends entirely on how much money you plan to 
spend, how long you have to tour, and where you choose 
to go and stay. Do you need a tour guide? Well, sometimes 
‘yes’ and sometimes ‘no’—it depends, for the most part, on 
where you are going as well as how comfortable you are with 
Arabic and dealing with the people on-site that are going to 
undoubtedly try to sell you things, including their services. To 
get the most out of the adventure (especially when you are 
new to Egypt) and to ease your way in and out of sites, be 
sure to hire a legitimate tour guide! It is critically important 
to hire a reputable, licensed tour guide. People are not legally 
allowed to approach you on the street or at the tourist sites 
and try to drag you off to their brother’s or uncle’s or some 
other relative’s shop. This was common ten or 15 years ago, 
Vendors at the pyramids, like the one above, sell all sorts of souvenirs but 
you should not allow them to harrass you.

but definitely should not be happening today. HOWEVER, 
it does still happen, especially when there are no tourist 
police in sight! 
In fact, it happened to me before I got through customs. 
A man (who must be licensed because he was in a restricted 
area) approached me. I heard from a friend that some of their 
foreign friends fell for this and the person doubled the rate on 
everything (including the hotels). You should never go with 
people nor hire them until and unless you can confirm that 
they are legitimate! Repeat: do not go with anyone nor hire 
them until and unless you can confirm, independently, that 
they are legitimate! In fact, if people will not stop harassing 
you at a site or store after you have politely told them to 
leave you alone, don’t hesitate to call a Tourist Policeman 
over. Pushy hecklers know they are not supposed to be 
harassing you!

Others require a long weekend or more to enjoy fully. And, 
of course, some are so far away that a weekend get-away 
requires you to fly.

Enjoying the Trains
Personally, I like the trains! Whenever I get the chance, I take a train 
because it lets me ‘see’ and ‘feel’ Egypt and her people. For more 
about my train experiences, see the article I wrote with Medhat at:
http://touregypt.net/magazine/mag07012001/magf1a.htm)! 
Unfortunately, trains don’t go everywhere. Some of the trains 
are getting to be a little run-down now. The Spanish trains continue 
to be the best. 
From  Cairo, you can take the train north to  Alexandria and 
west to Mersa Matruh, or you can go south to  Aswan. If you 
want to scuba dive or snorkel, you will want to go to the east 
coast, for example to Hurghada, or to the Sinai, perhaps at 
Sharm el Sheikh. The east coast requires either going by road 
or flying. The Sinai can be reached by road, but it is simply 
too far to make it feasible, so flying is the best way to get 
there. Absolutely, positively, sometime take a Nile Cruise! We 
all have our favourites and I have been on several exquisite 
boats. My preference is clear: I want to be on one of the 
Abercrombie and Kent boats. A&K boats offer top-of-the-line 
facilities, food and staff. I also like them because the number 
of people assigned to an individual guide is smaller. However, 
I have also had a wonderful time on other boats such as the 
Star Sapphire. There are so many good boats from which to 
choose, that you can hardly go wrong. 
Wherever you decide to go and however you get there, 
enjoy the beauty and diversity that is Egypt.

intonation accompanied by an alien series of guttural sounds 
difﬁ cult for the English-speaking palate to form. 
Eleven distinct languages or dialects ring out in the 
cacophony of sounds throughout Egypt. Cairene Arabic 
is the most widely understood dialect used for non-print 
media, both in Egypt and throughout the Arab world. It is 
an amalgam of Delta Arabic and Middle Egypt Arabic with 
borrowings from literary Arabic. Saidi or Upper Egyptian 
Arabic follows as the second most common dialect in 
Egypt. Egyptian Spoken Arabic distinguishes itself from 
Arabic spoken in other parts of the Arab world principally 
through a few consonant sounds and local colloquial 
phrases. Most highly educated Egyptians speak English 
and/or French.
Classical or Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is not 
a mother tongue, is the language of the  Qur’an, the Islamic 
holy book. It is also used in most textbooks for learning 
written Arabic. This form of Arabic ﬁ nds its greatest utility 
in written materials and formal speeches. Learning Classical 
Arabic provides an excellent basis from which to read Arabic 
newspapers or documents. It also forms a good platform 
to develop spoken Arabic, though words in spoken dialects 
differ as much as 50 per cent from MSA, according to 
some sources.

Communicating Egyptian Style
Many tapes for learning Arabic phrases use Egyptian 
Arabic because it is a widely understood dialect. Since 
Egyptian cinema and recordings are popular throughout the 
Arabic-speaking world, most people who speak the language 
understand the normalised Egyptian Spoken Arabic (based 
on  Cairo speech) established through the media. 
Coptic, one very important language you will not hear 
spoken, reportedly comes from Ancient Egypt. This extinct 
language lives on through the liturgical language of the 
 Coptic Christian Church. No ﬁ rst language speakers of Coptic 
exist, since the language went extinct apparently in the 
16th century. 
The large numbers of foreign tourists throughout Egypt 
introduce an interesting effect on communication styles. 
Anywhere that you ﬁ nd a signiﬁ cant tourist penetration, you 
will also ﬁ nd people able to communicate at least minimally 
in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese and 
probably several other languages. In tourist areas, people 
constantly approach the unwary stranger in a language 
Egyptians guess, based on the foreigner’s appearance, will 
be understood. If you don’t respond to entreaties in one 
language, tourism entrepreneurs simply switch languages 
until they ﬁ nd one you understand. However, in the more 
traditional parts of cities or in the rural areas, few people 
speak any language other than their native tongue.
SIMPLIFIED ARABIC  PRONUNCIATION 
AND ALPHABET
 The Arabic alphabet contains 28 letters. Some additional 
letters are used in Arabic when writing placenames or 
foreign words containing sounds which do not occur in 
Standard Arabic, such as /p/ or /g/. 
 Words are written in horizontal lines from right to left, 
numerals are written from left to right 
 Most letters change form depending on whether they 
appear at the beginning, middle or end of a word, or on 
their own (see tables). 
 Letters that can be joined are always joined in both 
handwritten and printed Arabic. The only exceptions to 

240 CultureShock! Egypt
this rule are crossword puzzles and signs in which the 
script is written vertically. 
 The long vowels /a:/, /i:/ and /u:/ are represented by the 
letters ’alif, ya¯’ and wa¯w respectively. 
 Vowel diacritics, which are used to mark short vowels, and 
other special symbols appear only in the  Qur’an. They are 
also used, though with less consistency, in other religious 
texts, in classical poetry, in textbooks for children and 
foreign learners, and occasionally in complex texts to avoid 
ambiguity. Sometimes the diacritics are used for decorative 
purposes in book titles, letterheads, nameplates, etc. 
 The letter [jeem] is pronounced as a hard [g] in 
most Egyptian dialects (see [gˇı˜m] in the table), e.g., 
[gabal] for [jabal] (mountain) or [gamil] for [jamil] 
(beautiful), and so forth. This pronunciation is considered 
typically Egyptian.
 The letter [qãf] is pronounced as a glottal stop [?] in  Cairo 
and the Delta, but as a hard [g] in Upper Egypt (the Sa’id), 
which is perhaps due to the Bedouin inﬂ uence. It does, 
however, confuse things because the same spoken sound 
[g] corresponds to different Arabic letters depending on 
whether you are in Upper or Lower Egypt.

 GREETINGS AND COMMON PHRASES
Do you have to learn Arabic to get along in Egypt? Yes and 
no—it depends on where you are, what you are doing, who 
you are with, as well as how long you intend to stay. In some 
instances, it may prove more beneﬁ cial to understand how 
many Egyptians perceive some aspects of communication 
rather than concern yourself with total proﬁ ciency in the 
Arabic language. 

243
Communicating Egyptian Style
Words possess power. As such, conversations contain 
frequent blessings to keep things going well. Blessings are 
also used to demonstrate that the speaker harbours no envy 
toward a person or object. Westerners commonly attribute 
this speaking pattern to concepts of fatalism—that one 
cannot control one’s fate. However, another perspective is 
that frequent blessings actually represent efforts to control 
future events to some extent. For example, envy or perceived 
envy toward something relates to belief in the ‘evil eye’, a 
belief shared by many Europeans and some North Americans. 
Belief in the evil eye (or just ‘the eye’), though common, is 
less pronounced among educated Egyptians. The evil eye is 
feared because it can bring harm to a person or thing if looked 
at (consciously or unconsciously) with envy. To prevent 
harm, and therefore the perception of envy, one should offer 
blessings or other statements of goodwill. Amulets, used in 
conjunction with religious phrases, most frequently depict 
drawings of eyes, open palm prints and the colour blue.

244 CultureShock! Egypt
To avoid making a bad situation worse, euphemisms 
replace explicit references to an illness, death or disaster. Until 
you can learn the local euphemism code, it is probably best to 
try to avoid conversations related to these types of sensitive 
subjects. The principal exception is describing symptoms to 
a doctor, which should always be explicit. 
How you say something is often perceived to be as 
important as what you say. Egyptians speak and write with a 
ﬂ owery eloquence unlike English verbal or written patterns. 
What appears to be long-winded, repetitious dialogue 
should be viewed as a demonstration of the speaker’s high 
educational level and reﬁ nement. Don’t be put off by threats, 
promises, exaggerations or nationalistic slogans that pepper 
dialogues. These are meant for effect, and again represent 
the speaker’s language proﬁ ciency. 
Certainly, command of the local language gives you an 
advantage in daily life or business. On the other hand, since 
so many people in Egypt speak English, native English 
speakers ﬁ nd simple daily survival easy without ﬂ uent Arabic, 
especially in the major cities. If you plan to stray away from 
the beaten path, you will likely need a minimal command 
of Arabic or a translator. The respect you receive and your 
acceptance in the country improves considerably once you 
command knowledge of elementary greetings and responses. 
Listed below are some key everyday greetings and phrases 
 Shukran
 
Literally, ‘thank you’. Probably shukran will be the ﬁ rst 
Arabic word you learn. 
 ’Afwan or el ’afw 
 
Literally, ‘you’re welcome’, ‘not at all’, or ‘don’t mention 
it’. Either the long or short form is an appropriate response 
to ‘thank you’.
 Iwa (Aywa) or naíam 
 
Literally, ‘yes’. Iwa (pronounced like the mid-western state 
of Iowa) seems to be used more frequently in Egypt than 
naíam, although both are understood and accepted.
 La’
 
Literally, ‘no’. Used alone or in a series—la’, la’, la’ is the 
common way to say no.

245
Communicating Egyptian Style
 Assalamu’alaykum and wa ’alaykum assalam 
 
Literally, assalamu’alaykum means ‘peace be upon 
you’. It is the more formal greeting for meeting new 
people. Literally, wa ’alaykum assalam, translates to 
‘and upon you peace’. It is the appropriate response to 
the formal hello. This greeting seems to be used less 
frequently as a greeting in Egypt than other parts of the 
Middle East. 
 Marhaba 
 
Marhaba is a more informal ‘hello’ greeting used either 
between friends or when greeting a stranger, for instance 
in a store.
 Ahlan and ahlan wa sahlan 
 
Literally, ahlan and its response ahlan wa sahlan mean 
‘nice to meet you’ or ‘welcome’. This is the most 
common greeting used among friends and strangers 
alike in Egypt.
 Ma’a ssalama and Allah yisallimak 
 
Literally, ‘go with safety’ and ‘may God make you safe’. 
Ma’a ssalama is a common goodbye phrase used when 
leaving someone’s home or business premises.
 Inshallah (Insha’Allah) 
 
Literally, ‘God willing’. Inshallah is used frequently 
in conversations. For example, when confirming 
that they will be at a meeting, it is common to hear 
the other person say something like, ‘I will be there 
at ten, Inshallah’ or ‘Bukra, Inshallah’. (‘Tomorrow, 
God willing.’)
 Izzayak? (to a man) or Izzayik? (to a woman)
 
Literally, ‘How are you?’ Notice the different form used for 
men and women. 
 Alhamdu lillah
 
Literally, ‘Thanks be to God’. Although there are many 
phrases used to say ‘I’m ﬁ ne’, this is one of the most 
frequently used.
 Hamdillah ’ala ssalama
 
Literally, ‘thanks be to God for your safety’. This phrase is 
used when someone recovers from an illness or returns 
from a trip.

246 CultureShock! Egypt
 Mashallah (Ma sha’ Allah)
 
Literally, ‘what God wills’. This phrase is used when seeing 
a child or complimenting someone’s health.
 Ma’alish
 
Literally, ‘never mind’ or ‘it doesn’t matter’. When 
Egyptians translate this phrase into English, they most 
often say, ‘No problem!’ Ma’alish is much more than a 
casual phrase, it actually represents a total way of looking 
at life’s trials and tribulations. The phrase provides a whole 
range of responses to disappointments, frustrations and 
acceptance of adversity.
THE  VERBAL DIMENSION
In Egypt, conversations frequently involve close contact 
and low tones, sometimes almost at the level of a whisper. 
Just as frequently, conversations suddenly erupt into loud 
shouting matches with everyone talking at once accompanied 
by arm waving, table pounding, threatening gestures and 
generous punctuating oaths. Boisterous dramatisations more 
commonly occur among males of the same age and social 
status who know each other well, but can also occur among 
total strangers. 
Getting Into the Swing of Things
Once when I was taking a group of Americans to a market in old 
 Alexandria, we had an unanticipated police escort. Much to our 
surprise, our escort took us through trafﬁ c to the wrong place. When 
I began exclaiming loudly to our interpreter that we did not want to 
go to this place but another, the bus screeched to a halt, my colleague 
departed, a crowd gathered, and there ensued a loud screaming 
match replete with vociferous arm waving and pointing. Next thing 
my group knew, I was out yelling at our interpreter who then relayed 
my complaints in a loud voice to the escort. People sat mesmerised 
in their seats, shrinking at the idea that some or all of us were going 
to be hauled off to jail for ﬁ ghting in public. Of course, it was simply 
normal conversation to the Egyptians involved. 
THE  NON-VERBAL DIMENSION
Successful communication in Egypt requires not only the 
ability to communicate verbally, but also an understanding 

247
Communicating Egyptian Style
of the non-verbal aspects of communication that accompany 
speech. Sometimes called the silent language, paralanguage, 
or body language, it comprises all those hidden means of 
communication we convey with our presence. Non-verbal 
communication among Egyptians is intense and very much 
a sensory experience. Talking is often accompanied by 
gestures, touching, mutual enjoyment of warm, moist breath 
and smells, and piercing looks with the eyes.
 Gestures
Especially when excited, Egyptians make liberal use of 
gestures when talking. If you watch people closely, you 
will also begin to notice head and facial gestures that are 
commonly part of communication. Since foreigners often 
use gestures in the wrong place or situation, it is advisable 
that you do not use these gestures until you are very familiar 
with Egyptian culture, but it is important to recognise 
them in order to get the full meaning of what is going 
on around you. You should note that the most common 
hand gestures should be made with the right hand only, 
never the left. 
Here are some of the more common do’s and don’ts 
concerning gestures.
 Most Western lewd hand or arm gestures are well 
understood throughout Egypt, and should not be used 
under any circumstances. 
 Probably every tourist book in the world written about 
ravelling in the Middle East reminds people not to cross 
their feet exposing the soles to people. This is an extreme 
insult. 
 A common gesture used in the United States is to raise 
one’s hand and make a circle with the thumb and 
foreﬁ nger to mean ‘good’ or ‘OK’. The same symbol may 
mean ‘zero’ to the French, ‘money’ to the Japanese, or 
‘male homosexual’ in Malta. Do not use this gesture in 
Egypt. If you want to indicate something is OK or very 
good or that you are winning, it is a better bet to use the 
old ‘thumbs up’ gesture by making a ﬁ st with the right 
hand with the thumb extending upwards.

248 CultureShock! Egypt
 Pointing at people is equally insulting in Egypt, as it is in 
the United States and Europe. 
 Beckoning someone to come to you by holding the hand 
palm up, curling the foreﬁ nger several times, is considered 
rude and commanding. If you want someone to come over 
to you or to indicate that you want to talk with someone, 
hold the right hand up, palm facing outward, and close 
all four ﬁ ngers back and forth to the palm. 
 If you want someone to go away, hold the right hand out, 
palm downward, and either move it laterally back and 
forth or move it as if scooping something away from you. 
It will also be understood if you use this gesture with the 
right arm hanging down by your side or just slightly in 
front of the leg.
 If you want someone to wait, calm down, go slowly or be 
patient, hold the right hand out, palm upward, touch the 
thumb and ﬁ ngers together, and them move the hand up 
and down.
 Space
Personal space is really a Western concept that is foreign to 
most Egyptians, especially in public. Much of this probably 
relates to differing concepts of the ‘self’ as interpreted through 
alternative cultural perceptions. To the Westerner, ‘self’ means 
all of the body, the shell of the individual, i.e., the tangible 
person. To the Egyptian, the ‘self’ resides somewhere deep 
within the core of the shell, closely tying the individual with 
the more representative meanings of honour, morality and 
character, i.e. the symbolic person. The way this translates 
into behaviour is quite simple: Westerners prefer a minimum 
communication distance of about 46 cm (18 inches), whereas 
Egyptians prefer 23–25 cm (9–10 inches). 
Don’t be surprised if you ﬁ nd yourself backing up when 
talking with an Egyptian. I have watched conversations 
proceed down a hall or across a room when a Westerner 
could not adjust to very close proximity when talking. 
Closeness when talking in the United States or Great Britain 
is reserved for intimacy or secrets. Even when stuck in an 
elevator, Europeans and Americans often back as far away 

249
Communicating Egyptian Style
as possible and stop talking, petriﬁ ed they may actually have 
to touch another person or smell their breath. Adjusting to 
close proximity with others requires time. You will probably 
never be completely comfortable with the typical personal 
space distance in Egypt, but you will adjust.
 Smiles
As mentioned before, it is quite acceptable to smile and make 
limited eye contact in mixed-gender social circumstances 
among friends and acquaintances or to smile through the 
course of normal conversation. Of course, men should be 
extremely cautious to avoid smiling beyond a casual greeting 
smile at Egyptian women under all circumstances. Directed 
smiling at women you don’t know may be interpreted as 
rude, a sexual approach and/or as an insult because it shows 
a lack of respect and compromises an Egyptian woman’s 
reputation. In extreme situations, making this type of 
inappropriate approach could result in her male relatives’ 
retribution for their family honuor or their approach to you 
to establish a marriage contract (which was probably not 
your intent). Remember, among more conservative single 
Egyptians, mixed-gender contact other than with close 
Bargaining over the price of a camel—personal space takes a back seat in 
Egypt but eye contact is important to show trust and sincerity. 

250 CultureShock! Egypt
relatives rarely occurs, so smiling is a way they indicate 
prospective interest in a marriage. 
Since foreign men’s exposure to Egyptian women is likely 
to be more limited than foreign women’s exposure to men 
(there are simply more Egyptian men out and about), the 
remainder of this section will consider women’s smiling 
behaviour. Social rules are different for women. There are 
certain circumstances where it is totally inappropriate for 
women to smile warmly at men—most especially, in public 
places with strangers. As much as I hate categorising, 
establishing ‘types’ of smiles is probably the easiest way 
to explain consequences of unwitting smiles from foreign 
women. Although there are huge ranges of smiles, for the 
sake of simplicity, I am going to categorise smiles into 
three types which are fairly easy to recognise: formal or 
polite (e.g. for business or shopping interchanges), social 
and informal. 
When a woman smiles warmly (with or without eye 
contact) at a male stranger, this means ‘she is interested’, so 
a warm smile is frequently interpreted as a come-on. Coupled 
with the not uncommon Egyptian man’s perception that 
Western women are ‘loose’ or ‘on the make’, unwary smiles 
can place you in an extremely awkward position. Rarely is 
this type of smile interpreted as a prelude to marriage. In 
fact, though I often advise women to be cautious in making 
eye contact with Egyptian men, a smile can be even more 
suggestive and, thus, more problematic. There is something 
between a full-blown smile and a frown. If you are a woman 
going to Egypt, practise it.
Now I am not suggesting that if you are a female you 
should walk around with a scowl or frown on your face. 
Certainly, ‘polite’ or ‘distant’ smiles, especially when thanking 
someone or asking directions with strangers is all right. But 
you should be careful of the ‘casual’ smile, because casual 
in Egypt is not the same as casual in the West. 
Broad differences in smiling behaviour among cultures 
tend to break down as follows. People ignore strangers in 
public in some cultures while others do not. For example, 
it is rare for people to acknowledge each other at a train 

251
Communicating Egyptian Style
station, a lift or generally in public in the United Kingdom. 
In parts of the United States, this is also not uncommon,  
for example in east coast subways. However, people from 
many parts of the United States tend to smile, nod, and/or 
say ‘hello, how are you?’ to strangers as they walk down 
the street, enter a lift, or in any situation when they are in 
direct proximity with another person regardless of gender. To 
them, it means nothing, but is simply considered a common 
courtesy and polite behaviour. If you happen to be from an 
area where this latter practice is common, it will be difﬁ cult 
to break this habit, but break it you must if you don’t want 
misunderstandings on a regular basis. 
Misunderstanding on the Train
Since I happen to come from an area where it is considered rude 
to pass a stranger without some sort of greeting, I speak from 
considerable experience on how difﬁ cult this trait is to break. To show 
how important it is to curb this particular habit, however, let me give 
you an example of what happened to a friend on an Egyptian train. 
A happy, friendly beautiful American woman enjoying the thrill of 
being in Egypt, entered a train. In doing so, she smiled brightly (with 
little eye contact) and politely said, “Excuse me” to a man standing 
close to the door as she passed. Totally innocent and appropriate 
behaviour from her perspective (perhaps even required for politeness 
in her culture), her actions were totally misinterpreted by the man. He 
followed her into the car, tried to start a conversation, and asked her 
to sit with him. She, of course, became distressed by the attention, 
not understanding why he was following her. According to her normal 
rules of behaviour, she had done nothing wrong. When a colleague 
quickly tried to come to her rescue by telling the man to leave and that 
she was his daughter, the man simply asked her ‘father’ if he could sit 
with her. Profuse no’s were not accepted and the man proceeded to 
stand at the end of the car and stare at the woman, making her even 
more uncomfortable. Finally, a couple of our Egyptian male friends 
had to intervene to get the man to leave her alone.
 Eye Contact
In Egypt, reading eyes is a non-verbal art form. Americans 
and especially northern Europeans find the intense 
level of gaze common in Egypt to be disconcerting and 
uncomfortable. Why? Because long, deep, penetrating gazing 
in the West generally means intimacy. In fact, depending on 

252 CultureShock! Egypt
where you are from, direct eye contact connotes honesty, 
respect, disrespect, ﬂ irtation or a sexual come-on. Among 
some subcultures, direct, non-prolonged eye contact means 
sincerity and truth. Among other groups, it is a sign of 
disrespect. Typically, northern Europeans are among the least 
comfortable with high levels of gaze during conversations. 
This is true for either male or female, whether in mixed or 
same sex groups. 
Direct, semi-prolonged or intense eye contact between 
same or mixed sex individuals in a business meeting implies 
honesty and sincerity among Egyptians. This gets back to 
reading eyes. Most people cannot control pupil dilation when 
their interest is aroused. It doesn’t have to be sexual interest 
between a man and a woman. Any kind of interest will do, 
for example, a comment made in a business meeting which 
triggers interest in pursuing the business deal. Therefore, to 
the Egyptian, much can be learned about the honour and 
integrity of a person by gazing intently into the eyes. 
In a society such as Egypt, where men and women do not 
customarily have a great deal of social or verbal interaction 
except in school, within the family or in conducting 
business transactions, eyes tell much about the character 
of the individual. Inadvertent, frequent eye contact can 
be particularly hazardous for the Western woman in non-
business related settings. Even relatively brief eye contacts, 
especially when repeated a few times, denotes interest and 
might be considered coquettish, ﬂ irtatious or an open sexual 
invitation. Certainly, the more educated or Westernised 
Egyptians accept greater latitude in eye contact than do 
others due to the simple fact that they have more frequent 
contact with outsiders and are more able to judge behaviour 
on non-ethnocentric guidelines. 
 Touching
As mentioned above, same sex interactions are replete 
with touches and gestures. Keep your hands to yourself in 
mixed company! Unmarried males and females simply do 
not touch one another, especially in public. Married people 
often walk arm-in-arm or occasionally hold hands when 

253
Communicating Egyptian Style
walking. Regardless of whether you are with Egyptians or 
other foreigners, kissing, fondling or other public displays of 
intimacy are strictly taboo throughout Egypt.
Except when shaking hands, men should be careful never 
to touch Egyptian women except in an emergency. If she 
falls on the street, it is probably all right to pick her up, but 
remove your hands as quickly as possible. Women—if a man 
falls, let him get up on his own or let other men assist him 
as necessary. Do not intervene unless you are a doctor and 
the person’s life or safety is at stake.
 EGYPTIAN TIME
The clock reads the same in Egypt, but responses and 
expectations differ signiﬁ cantly from those in the West. 
Working on Egyptian time boggles the mind. Things happen 
when they happen, no sooner. If you are on a tight schedule, 
you are probably destined to suffer severe frustration. 
Your best bet is to simply learn to work in approximate 
time schedules. 
I have occasionally asked friends how long it would take 
to walk or drive to some place nearby. Invariably the answer 
seems to be the same. Except on rare occasions, every place 
is ten minutes’ walk or drive. My usual response is, “Ten 
Egyptian minutes or American minutes?”
I view Egyptian time as a process of ‘Yalla! Yalla!—Wait.’ 
Yalla! simply means ‘Let’s go!’ or ‘Hurry up!’ No matter how 
much you hurry, inevitably interminable waits follow your 
haste. Expect delays and adjust—it is the norm.
 QUEUING
Forget you ever knew the concept, it does not happen in 
Egypt! Just like driving, people trafﬁ c in Egypt knows no 
lane markers. Only a forced queue could possibly persuade 
Egyptians to ‘wait in line’. 
Once I watched a number of Americans dutifully form 
what they perceived to be a line while waiting to get a 
ticket for the Metro. Totally confounded by people slipping 
outstretched arms with money in front of them, the 
Americans still waited in line. They just kept standing, unsure 

254 CultureShock! Egypt
of what to do next. Finally, a sympathetic toll taker noticed 
the Americans standing there and waved them forward to 
sell them their ticket.
So, be assertive. Get into the spirit of how to get that burger 
or Metro ticket. Otherwise, you may wait a considerable time 
before someone takes sympathy on your plight. 
 PHOTOGRAPHY
You should always ask permission before taking a picture 
of someone you don’t know. You can do this verbally, or as 
I often do, by getting their attention, pointing to the camera 
and shrugging the shoulders as if asking, ‘Is this OK?’ Asking 
before snapping the shutter applies speciﬁ cally when you 
focus in on an individual or small group of people. Of course, 
when taking street scene pictures, it is impossible to ask 
permission of all the people. In this case, use your posture 
to make sure no particular person feels threatened by the 
camera. After all, most people are quite used to seeing 
hundreds of tourists running around the country snapping 
pictures everywhere.

255
Communicating Egyptian Style
Women are particularly sensitive about having their 
pictures taken by strangers. If a woman sees you aiming 
a camera lens at her and does not want her picture taken, 
usually she will turn away. An alternative way to let the 
shutterbug know a picture should not be taken involves 
raising the hand over the face or holding the arm up towards 
the photographer. Some men also do not want their pictures 
taken. They use the same non-verbal signals, and also will 
occasionally shout out at you. Especially in tourist areas, 
people allow you to take their picture for a small tip. Again, 
ask. Do not offer a gratuity to a friend when taking pictures 
among a group, but it never hurts to ask if it is OK to take 
the pictures. 
Photography is allowed at all antiquities, but sometimes 
photography tickets are required. Other areas allow 
photography, but no ﬂ ash pictures. Still other places require 
special tickets for the use of video cameras. 
It is against the law to take some pictures, usually politically 
sensitive buildings, embassies or military installations. Also, 
there is still a prohibition against taking pictures of bridges, 
but this seems to be less enforced now than in the past. If 
you are in a locality where pictures are not allowed, usually 
there is a policeman or military person around who will tell 
you not to take pictures. Signs indicate a few areas where 
photography is banned, such as the airport. 
Finally, and this is very important, never tell someone you 
will send them copies of the pictures unless you absolutely, 
positively can do so. Many people in rural areas or even at 
tourist sites ask if you will send them copies. Most tourists 
are insensitive, usually saying, ‘Yes, I will send them as soon 
as I get home.’ Then they go home and never communicate 
with anyone again. On the other hand, do not tell them, ‘No, 
I cannot send you a copy.’ Instead, tell them, ‘Inshallah’ or 
‘I will send you a picture if I can.’ This will be understood. 
It allows you to answer positively, which is appropriate, but 
not to feel as though you committed to action you cannot 
reasonably accomplish.

‘True wisdom is less presuming than folly. 
The wise man doubteth often, and changeth his mind; 
the fool is obstinate, and doubteth not; 
he knoweth all things but his own ignorance.’

 BUSINESS STYLE
People often describe the Egyptian business style as being 
personal. This concept interweaves a level of formality 
into personal relationships built on trust. Who you know 
deﬁ nitely carries more weight than what you know in terms 
of facilitating business deals in Egypt. You can always pull in 
the technical expertise you need, but without the personal 
network to make things happen, you are most likely destined 
to failure. This is why building personal relationships becomes 
so critical to success. The hallmark of Egyptian business 
revolves around formality and personal relationships. 
Formality typically enters the picture through protocol (who 
sits where, who is involved, etc.) and dress. However, personal 
relationships built on trust mark the cornerstone of who 
succeeds and who does not. 
Do not be surprised when, upon introduction to an 
important person, the conversation quickly turns to a ‘who 
do you know’ kind of scenario. When a person introduces 
himself at a meeting or someone is introducing you, you 
will often get a long list of comments like, ‘I was with so-
and-so at such-and-such’ or ‘My cousin so-and-so has been 
very instrumental in accomplishing this, that, or the other’. 
Do not view this as bragging or name-dropping. That is 
not the purpose. What the person is doing is letting you 
know that he has the contacts necessary to fulﬁ l his end 
of the bargain. 

258 CultureShock! Egypt
The conversation may follow many forms, but eventually 
both participants or groups must somehow establish their 
bona ﬁ des in order for the dealings to go forward. 
Always, always, always, start business negotiations with 
the highest ranking person you possibly can. Manoeuvring 
through the system becomes exponentially easier the higher 
up you start. It is easy to work down a system, but often much 
more difﬁ cult to work up one. However, don’t forget the just 
beginning son of an important businessman, politician or 
leader either. Once he is convinced, he may well be able to get 
his father or uncle interested in your business proposal.
 BUSINESS  DRESS
Fairly formal is the custom. Remember Egyptians tend to 
dress a little more formally for most occasions than do 
Westerners anyway. Dress for men should most often include 
a jacket and tie, especially for the ﬁ rst meeting. You may 
ﬁ nd that your Egyptian counterpart is dressed a little more 
casually during the summer months, but again, it is better 
to be a bit overdressed than underdressed. You can always 
remove your jacket if the situation warrants. Women’s dress 
should either be a conservative dressy sort of dress (not 
after-ﬁ ve or cocktail type) or a business suit. Deﬁ nitely do 
not wear short skirts—the hemline should be at least below 
the knees.
 BUSINESS CARDS
Come armed with lots of business cards! It is customary to 
exchange cards with people you meet, especially all people 
attending business meetings. Even if you are not working 
(male or female), you should have some cards printed to give 
to people when you meet them. 
If you can, have them printed on both sides—one side in 
English and the other in Arabic. If not, one side in English 
is acceptable. Many people in Egypt have several phone 
numbers printed on their cards. Typically, these will include 
home phone numbers as well as email addresses and 
business and fax numbers. So if you want to impress your 
Egyptian colleagues with your sincerity and knowledge of 

259
Business
customs (and don’t mind them calling you at home), get 
cards printed with your home phone number included. It 
looks so much better than scrawling the number on the 
back of the card. 
BUSINESS  MEETINGS
Two things come to mind when thinking about business 
meetings in Egypt. The ﬁ rst is time and the other relates 
to how a meeting is typically conducted. The best 
recommendation I can offer is practise patience and build 
ﬂ exibility into your schedule. 
Some people think Egyptians are chronically late because 
business meetings never seem to begin ‘on time’ according 
to foreign practices. This actually is not always true, just a 
matter of perspective. Whether you arrive at the precise 
moment your appointment is scheduled, or before, or a few 
minutes late, you will not be shown into your appointment 
until host hospitality formalities have been shown. As a 
general rule, the higher up the ofﬁ cial is in an organisation 
or government, the greater the likelihood a subordinate 
will escort you to a reception room for some time to have 
coffee, tea or a cold drink. Of course, as soon as I say that 
is the standard, an exception occurs. This appears to be a 
function of the perceived rank of the visitor. The more equal in 
terms of social, political or business position, the more likely 
you will be escorted to your appointment and then served 
refreshments. In any event, Egyptians build hospitality time 
into appointments and you are expected to adhere to this 
protocol before business can be discussed. 
Egyptians seem to build in a hospitality time in all of 
their schedules, not just their meetings. Depending on the 
circumstances, some business people actually operate rather 
punctually, but this is often the exception. Nonetheless, you 
are expected to show up for business meetings on time; 
however, you will probably ﬁ nd yourself waiting for some 
time to actually begin the meeting. Even if you are late, do 
not expect to just walk into the meeting. Most probably, 
regardless of when you arrive, you will usually be shown to a 
receiving area and served coffee, tea or a cold drink, to ensure 

260 CultureShock! Egypt
you are given the hospitality you, 
as a guest, deserve. I say ‘most 
probably’ because just about the 
time you have this all ﬁ gured out, 
you will come upon a situation 
where you are shown directly 
into your meeting and then 
served refreshments. This seems 
to be a practice reserved for 
some types of situations which are not altogether predictable. 
The times I have experienced this seem to be when I have 
had meetings with very highly placed government ofﬁ cials, 
such as a governor or minister. 
As an American, I learned long ago to be a bit sceptical 
of business dealings with colleagues and to couch business 
concerns in legalistic, contractual arrangements. In American 
business transactions, trust goes only so far (and deﬁ nitely 
not very far at that). Then one must have the backing of a legal 
document to bind the commitments. Even when someone 
gives you their word and shakes on a deal, ﬁ nal negotiations 
are left to the lawyers. For many kinds of transactions, 
lawyers may well be required in Egypt as well. Certainly, at 
some point, legal contracts become necessary. However, at 
a more informal level of negotiation, when an Egyptian tells 
you, on his or her word, that something will be done or is 
agreeable, it becomes a matter of personal honour and the 
deal will usually be honoured. Before you run off to the bank 
with the deal, however, make sure you actually know what 
it is you and the other party have agreed on. 
An area of common misinterpretation relates to the 
subtleties of answers given by Egyptians. This is especially 
true when asking something of a person who considers 
you a friend (and if you are doing business with them, they 
probably have put you in the category of friend). As a rule of 
thumb, when a friend asks you to do something, it is never 
appropriate (by Egyptian standards) to say no. If an Egyptian 
answers a request with a non-committal yes or something like 
‘we must look into this’, then the comment actually means 
‘probably no’. By the way, this is not to say that Egyptians

Conducting business meetings 
in your hotel room may be ﬁ ne 
in your native country, but you

the matter warrants. 

261
Business
will not try to get the better of a negotiation—but then, that 
is all just part of being a good businessman. Does this mean 
you will never hear ‘no’ uttered in a business negotiation? 
Probably not, but then it is easy to understand a direct no. 
The subtleties of the different kinds of ‘yes’ will more likely 
cause the most misunderstandings.
I have heard Westerners say they were cheated when 
there was really a misunderstanding as to what was agreed 
to in the ﬁ rst place. This can lead Westerners to believe that 
their Egyptian counterparts ‘lied’ to them, when in point of 
fact, the Egyptians had behaved honourably and honestly 
according to their own understanding of the agreement. 
I cannot tell you the number of times when trying to 
arrange things for my students that I thought there was total 
understanding as to who was to pay for or arrange what—
only to ﬁ nd out later that my counterpart’s understanding 
of the agreement was different from mine. This does 
not mean that my counterpart acted in a dishonourable or 
dishonest way—he did not. Rather, it meant that we simply 
did not communicate our respective expectations quite 
accurately. My only suggestion to avoid this kind of situation is 
to spell out in minute detail just what you expect. This won’t 
eliminate all misunderstanding but can certainly reduce the 
frustration level and number of misunderstandings. 
How meetings are conducted requires the development 
of ﬂ exibility and patience as well. If you expect to have the

262 CultureShock! Egypt
undivided attention of your business host during a meeting, 
you will probably be disappointed or possibly confused. 
Typically, during Western business meetings, all calls are 
stopped or some comment is made to let you know that 
some terribly important overseas or long-distance call may 
come in during your visit. You also expect, under most 
circumstances, that other individuals either leave the room 
or not interrupt the meeting. If you are expecting privacy 
and undivided attention, you may well need to forget this 
tradition for most meetings. Once you are ushered into your 
meeting, you may well ﬁ nd you are among ﬁ ve or ten other 
persons all sitting in the room at various places. Each is also 
trying to conduct business with the same person. Phones ring 
and are answered. Long conversations may ensue. People 
run in and out, catch the host’s attention, and conduct their 
business just as though you were not sitting or standing there. 
You may ﬁ nd your temper swelling while thinking, ‘What 
am I doing here? This person is not taking this seriously. 
Doesn’t this person realise that time is money, and my time 
is valuable too?’ Actually, conducting meetings in this way 
is common practice, not a personal statement or action 
against you.
The times I have experienced exceptions to this type of 
meeting seem to have occurred most commonly when I 
have met with ministers or other very high level ofﬁ cials. 
These individuals seem to follow a more customary Western-
style business meeting approach, giving you more or less 
undivided attention. However, it is still not uncommon for 
a subordinate to come in and interrupt the discussion with 
pressing issues that simply cannot wait until your meeting 
is ﬁ nished.
BUSINESS  HOURS
Those accustomed to working from eight to ﬁ ve or, for 
that matter, seven in the morning to late evening, will ﬁ nd 
Egyptian business hours difﬁ cult to understand. The custom 
of working for eight hours straight is practically unheard of 
in most of Egypt. I have alluded to the fact that many shops 
and souks are usually open until late at night. Sometimes 

263
Business
these establishments close for some time in the afternoon. 
Other times they do not close (for example in tourist areas), 
but you will notice a change in who is working. The reason 
this happens is the tradition of the afternoon nap. 
Bureaucrats do not follow typical Western business hours 
either. As a rule, bureaucrats seem to work more or less 
between the hours of nine or ten in the morning through 
about two in the afternoon. Again, the custom is to leave 
for lunch around two and follow this with a nap. Usually 
people are still around in the building until a little later in 
the afternoon, but it seems impossible to get anything done 
except during the earlier hours. 
Of course, if you are working with higher level ministerial 
people, you may ﬁ nd the hours somewhat different. Some 
higher ranking ofﬁ cials and other businessmen accustomed 
to working with Westerners tend to follow a schedule slightly 
more reminiscent of Western business hours, but do not 
expect this to be the norm. Count on not doing your work 
between approximately two and four, with possibly evening 
meetings as a supplement.

264 CultureShock! Egypt
 TOPICS TO AVOID
Nearly every book you read gives you hints on topics you 
should avoid in business meetings or with Egyptians in 
general. Usually, the well-meaning author reminds you not to 
ask any in-depth questions about a man’s family, particularly 
his wife or daughters. On the other hand, if you know your 
colleague has a wife, three daughters and an ailing mother-
in-law, it would seem cold not to make a casual comment 
roughly stating that you hope all is well with his family (or 
getting better as in the case of the sick mother-in-law). 
This shows your friendship and caring for him as a person. 
Certainly on a ﬁ rst meeting, you should not be the ﬁ rst to 
bring up the topic of his wife and daughters (most especially 
if you have never met them). Use good judgement and you 
probably won’t go wrong.
The second topic usually listed to avoid is religion. This 
can be tricky since many Egyptians may well bring up the 
subject and you are left trying to ﬁ gure out how to get out 
of discussing the topic. And, yes, this can even happen in a 
business meeting, particularly when you are going through 
some of the ‘get-to-know-each-other’ protocol. Interestingly, 
many Egyptians are fascinated about Western Christianity. 
This is another one of those cases where the media introduces 
some preconceived notions that might not be accurate 
from your point of view. For example, some have viewed 
American televangelists via cable or satellite and assume that 
all American Christians (maybe even Christians throughout 
the world) have similar views. Your best bet, should you get 
stuck in an awkward situation, is to try to shift the topic 
around to having them explain  Islam to you. That way you 
can avoid making any statements that could be viewed as 
hostile or inappropriate, and you are showing an interest 
in them.
The third topic to avoid is politics, the government or 
government policy (unless of course you are asking questions 
about how these things affect your proposed business deal). 
This is another one of those topics that seem to fascinate 
Egyptians. Since you are a foreigner of presumed high ranking 
(or else you wouldn’t be there), anything you say may be open 

265
Business
to misinterpretation. In a worst case scenario, you could be 
perceived to be talking for your government. Unless you are 
a government representative there for that speciﬁ c purpose 
(in which case you will have speciﬁ c instructions), comments 
on your government’s policies or their government’s policies 
could have serious unfortunate repercussions. Egyptians will 
rarely express a personal opinion about their government or 
ofﬁ cials that is, in any way, negative if there are more than 
two people present (unless, of course, that is their business). 
They expect you to follow a similar stance. 
Discussing sex or telling dirty jokes is not in the best taste 
either. Once I prepared a brieﬁ ng sheet for some American 
university ofﬁ cials and duly reminded them to avoid dirty 
jokes and discussions of sex. After the meeting (all the 
participants were men), one of my colleagues quickly came 
up to me and said, “We didn’t know what to do. They started 
telling us dirty jokes.” There are a couple of ways to view this 
type of behaviour. First, your counterparts may well be trying 
to show you how cosmopolitan they are, thinking that you 
expect this type of conversation. Second, they may really like 
dirty jokes. In either event, you may very well lose respect if 
you start chiming in with, “Have you heard the one about...?” 
In any event, whether you ﬁ nd the conversation distasteful 
or just in bad form, not reacting at all or responding with 
only the very slightest smile will usually get you out of an 
awkward situation. This is not the place to ask where you 
can ﬁ nd a prostitute.
 NEPOTISM
I hate using the word nepotism—it has such negative 
connotations in so many countries. Nepotism is deﬁ ned 
as favouritism shown to relatives or close friends. Well, in 
Egypt—where so much is based on personal knowledge 
and trust—logically, you ﬁ nd a great deal of favouritism 
or patronage to family and close friends. It is accepted, 
expected, and the appropriate way to conduct business 
affairs. This is how business has been conducted for 
millennia. You would never consider doing business with 
someone you don’t know or whose reputation cannot be 

266 CultureShock! Egypt
checked through friends and relatives! And, almost all new 
jobs are found by networking!
No matter how you personally feel about nepotism as a 
custom, from a pragmatic perspective, Egypt’s nepotistic 
practices can work to your beneﬁ t in business. Once you have 
established the trust needed with one person, other doors 
seem to open magically. It seems that everyone you talk to 
has a relative doing exactly what you need. Not uncommonly, 
members of a family will have a brother or cousin or father 
or uncle or in-law in just the position desperately needed to 
help with your project. 
 BRIBES 
Only a very ﬁ ne line of distinction separates bribes from 
gifts from  baksheesh. Is a little ‘tip’ given to an ofﬁ cial who 
has helped you get some paper signed a bribe or  baksheesh? 
Depends on your perspective, doesn’t it? (See the section on 
‘Baksheesh and Tipping’ in Chapter Four: Social Interactions, 
page 117.) Some refer to it as the informal cost of doing 

267
Business
business in Egypt. Payment of bribes is illegal under many 
foreign laws. In higher level negotiations, certainly direct 
payment of a cash supplement to an ofﬁ cial would seem 
inappropriate in Egypt as well as elsewhere. It would not, 
however, seem inappropriate to engage someone (or their 
son or brother, etc.) who has a separate business (but is also 
in an inﬂ uential position) as a consultant or agent on your 
project by Egyptian standards. 
On a more pragmatic level, sometimes a little  baksheesh 
can assist getting a needed signature in a timely fashion. One 
situation I observed related to the need for a police report 
for purposes of an insurance claim on goods stolen from a 
hotel room. The question of retrieving the goods was never 
a real issue since it was assumed that they were long gone. 
Rather than calling the police at the time of the alleged theft 
(which would have involved all kinds of hassles, inquiries 
and searches), the person was advised that ‘it would be 
easier’ to wait until later and simply get a police report in 
another city, for a cost of E£ 20. Indeed, it took about an 
hour, several weeks later, to acquire an appropriate police 
report for insurance purposes. There was no delay and no 
hassle, and everyone left satisﬁ ed (except, of course, for the 
fact that the goods were still missing).
 SETTING UP A BUSINESS
Several types of business organisations exist in Egypt, 
generally in the form of incorporated companies, partnerships 
and sole proprietorships. Foreigners are rarely interested in 
the unincorporated forms used by Egyptian traders. 
Most foreign investors choose the Limited Liability 
Company, known as a WLL (with limited liability). The 
Joint Stock Company (Shareholder Company) is the most 
commonly used form of corporate business entity in Egypt. 
Foreign investors may carry on business in Egypt through 
a branch ofﬁ ce. However, this provides no tax advantage. 
Companies whose sole interest is the exportation of goods 
to Egypt must generally appoint a local agent who must be 
an Egyptian national or company. Labour requirements apply 
to all companies whose capital exceeds E£ 50,000.

DEALING WITH THE  BUREAUCRACY
Bureaucracies anywhere can be a deﬁ nite pain! Unfortunately, 
to establish a business or conduct many business transactions 
in Egypt requires working with the bureaucratic infrastructure. 
Rarely can you simply go to the local ofﬁ ce, pick up and ﬁ ll 
out the papers, and expect things to get done in a timely 
fashion. It always appears to involve a lengthy process which 
can try one’s patience. True, the Egyptian government is 
making signiﬁ cant changes to facilitate movement through 
the bureaucracy, especially for the development of new 
businesses, but reality changes slowly—very, very slowly, no 
matter how good it looks in the press.
Why is working with the Egyptian bureaucracy so 
problematic? Of course, part of the problem is the massive 
paperwork and permits needed to get anything done. But 
there is one other more perplexing problem. What happened 
to all those forms you so dutifully submitted to the person at 
the desk? How could they just disappear into the bottomless 
chasm of Egyptian bureaucracy? Easy! Everyone must have 
his input. 
Now don’t forget that every Egyptian who has a job 
(especially one of the valued white-collar jobs) feels pride 
and honour with the job. This means they must show how 
important they are (and that they actually do have a role in the 
process). Overlaying this need to show personal importance 
is that old bugaboo deference. Each person must ﬁ lter every 
action to the person next in line above them and, no matter 
what, it seems difﬁ cult to jump layers in the deference scale 
unless—and this is important—unless you have the personal 
contacts to get straight through to the person you need. This 
is where having an Egyptian agent (required for some kinds 
of enterprises) or business partner who is well connected 
can come in very useful. 

269
Business
Bottom line: getting permissions or permits that should 
take only pro forma approval may well involve going through 
many, many lower ofﬁ cials to ﬁ nally get to the one person 
who actually has the authority to put the required signature 
on the needed form.

acts as one big family, not as many separate ones.’

FAMOUS PEOPLE
 Ramses II 
The son of Seti I and Queen Tuya,  Ramses II was the third 
king (1279–1213 BC) of the 19th Dynasty. Called  Ramesses 
the Great, he lived to be 96 years old, had 200 wives and 
concubines, 96 sons and 60 daughters. His favourite wife 
was apparently Nefertari for whom he built a temple in 
 Abu Simbel. In addition to his great tomb (KV 7),  Ramses 
II built a great tomb for his sons, KV 5, which is currently 
being excavated. 
 Hatshepsut
The ﬁ fth ruler (1473–1458 BC) of the 18th Dynasty, she was 
the daughter of Thutmose I and Queen Ahmose. As was 
common in royal families, she married her half-brother, 
Thutmose II, who had a son, Thutmose III, by a minor wife. 
When Thutmose II died in 1479 BC, his son, Thutmose III, 
was appointed heir. However,  Hatshepsut was appointed 
regent due to the boy’s young age. They ruled jointly until 
1473 BC when she declared herself pharaoh. Dressed in 
men’s attire,  Hatshepsut administered affairs of the nation. 
 Hatshepsut disappeared from the historical record in 
1458 BC when Thutmose III, wishing to reclaim the throne, 
led a revolt. Thutmose III then had her shrines, statues and 
reliefs mutilated.
 Tutankhamun
‘ King  Tut’, aka ‘the Boy King’ probably ruled Egypt between 
1334–1325 BC, possibly the 12th ruler of Egypt’s 18th 
Dynasty. Not considered to be an important pharaoh, prior 
to Howard Carter’s discovery of his tomb, almost nothing 
was known of him. One disappointment in Carter’s discovery 
was that there was little in the way of documentation found 
within his tomb. Akhenaten, the heretic pharaoh, was most 
likely his father. His mother was probably Kiya, though this 
too is in question.

Egypt at a Glance
 Cleopatra
In the springtime of 51 BC, Ptolemy Auletes died and left his 
kingdom in his will to his 18-year-old daughter,  Cleopatra, 
and her younger brother Ptolemy XIII who was 12 at the 
time.  Cleopatra was born in 69 BC in  Alexandria. Her death 
on 12 August 30 BC at the age of 39 marked the end of the 
Egyptian Monarchs as it coincided with the Roman Emperors 
coming in to rule in Egypt. The Ptolemies were Macedonian 
in descent, but ruled as Egyptians, as Pharaohs.  Cleopatra 
was the last Pharaoh of Egypt. 
Naguib  Mahfouz (1911–2006  )
Egyptian writer who was awarded the Nobel Prize for 
Literature in 1988, and was the ﬁ rst Arabic writer to be so 
honoured. Born in  Cairo, Naguib  Mahfouz began writing when 
he was 17 and until 1972, was employed as a civil servant. 
 Mahfouz’s major work in the 1950s was The  Cairo Trilogy, 
which the author completed before the July Revolution. The 
individual novels were titled with the street names Palace 
Walk, Palace of Desire and Sugar Street.  Mahfouz set the 
tri-generational story on a ﬁ cticious, tiny winding street 
named Zuqaq al-Midaq in the neighbourhoods of  Cairo where 
he grew up.
 Gamal Abdel  Nasser (1918–1970) 
Born in  Alexandria to a family that comes from the Assiut 
Governorate,  Nasser was brought up and educated in 
 Alexandria and  Cairo. He led a nationalist movement in 
1952 that ousted the Egyptian monarchy and transformed 
Egypt into a republic.  Nasser became Prime Minister of Egypt 
in 1954 and subsequently negotiated an end to Britain’s 
72-year occupation of Egypt.  Nasser was elected president 
of Egypt in 1956 and remained in ofﬁ ce until his death in 
1970. His accomplishments included the construction of 
the  Aswan High Dam, the institution of land reforms and 
a programme of industrialisation, and the restoration of 
Egyptian self-government.

278 CultureShock! Egypt
 Anwar  el-Sadat (1918–1981) 
 Muhammad  Anwar  el-Sadat succeeded  Gamal Abdel Nasser 
as the president of Egypt in 1970, and retained the ofﬁ ce 
until he was assassinated in 1981. He shared the 1978 
 Nobel Prize for Peace with Israeli prime minister Menachem 
Begin. In 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty. As 
a result, Sadat’s popularity fell dramatically in Egypt due 
to internal opposition to the treaty, worsening economic 
conditions, and his suppression of resulting public dissent. 
He was assassinated by  Muslim extremists while reviewing 
a military parade commemorating the Arab-Israeli war of 
October 1973.
 Hosni  Mubarak (1928–  ) 
 Mubarak succeeded  Anwar  el-Sadat as president of Egypt 
on 14 October 1981. He was re-elected in 1987, 1993 
and 1999. President  Hosni  Mubarak was born in the 
Al-Menouﬁ yah governorate, located in the heart of Egypt, in 
the Delta area. 

The Egyptian Museum of Antiquities, 
popularly called the Egyptian Musuem 
is home to hundreds of prized artifacts.

For Egyptians, family always comes ﬁ rst before 
business. Typically, daughters grow to be closer 
to the mother and the sons, the father.

CULTURE QUIZ
SITUATION 1
You and your family have been in Cairo for a few months. 
In a conversation with one of your new Egyptian friends, 
you express interest in taking your family to visit the beach 
in Ismailia over the weekend. Your contact tells you, “Oh, I 
have a lovely villa there which is yours to use. I will arrange 
everything.” On the assigned date, a driver arrives to take you 
to Ismailia. When you get there, you find that arrangements 
have been made for a grand meal at a local restaurant. The 
driver stays in Ismailia to drive you anywhere you want to go 
while there and then take you back to Cairo the next evening. 
When you get back to Cairo, you pay the driver for his services 
and also give him what can be considered a good tip. Next 
day, you visit your friend to tell him how wonderful the trip 
was and express your thanks for all the hospitality and use 
of the villa in Ismailia. He tells you, it was “No problem. You 
are welcome.” Then he tells you that the cost for the trip is 
E£ 420. Your response is:

280 CultureShock! Egypt
 “I already paid the driver. Give me a detailed list of the 
other costs and I will be happy to pay you for that.”
 React with annoyance and shock, and refuse to pay, saying, 
“Well, where I come from when we invite someone to visit, 
we don’t ask them to pay.” 
 Thank him for his gracious hospitality, telling him that this 
is so little to pay for such a wonderful weekend. 
Comments
Well, if you never want to see this friend again, choose either 
 or . If the friend means something to you, choose  
and write it off to experience. Even though with , you 
already paid the driver according to your way of thinking, 
your friend arranged for the driver. Therefore, any money 
you gave the driver was considered a ‘tip’ by him.  is just 
blatantly insulting to your Egyptian friend. 
It is easy to fall into this kind of situation. Your Egyptian 
friend is not misleading you by offering to arrange everything. 
They may even suggest you be their guest at their villa, but 
this still may not mean you would not be expected to pay 
for the costs. In other situations, especially if your Egyptian 
friend is quite wealthy, they would not ask you to compensate 
them for any expenses incurred. In this situation, your friend 
would assume you would reciprocate on another occasion. 
When in doubt, ask. There are a couple of ways to handle 
this situation beforehand. First, when something like this 
happens, you could easily tell your friend something like, 
“Wow, it is great of you to offer. How much do you think it 
will cost for transportation and everything?” Another way 
you might want to handle an offer that seems too good to 
be true or when you don’t want to be obligated for a future 
reciprocation is to say something like, “Oh, I would never 
presume to impose on you. We would expect to pay for 
all costs associated with such generosity. How much will 
that be?” 
Most of the time, if your friends actually expect you to pay 
for something, they will be straightforward and treat it as a 
business deal—especially if you ask. But, don’t forget the 
‘rule of threes’. Your hosts may ﬁ rst protest that you shouldn’t 

281
Culture Quiz
pay. If they do this, be sure to say something like, “Oh, no. 
I couldn’t let you do that much.” You should go through 
this kind of banter until they insist the third time, at 
which point you can feel free to accept because it means 
they actually mean you should not pay. Just remember 
to try to give them an opportunity for a way out since 
they may feel obligated to offer even if they cannot 
afford to. 
SITUATION 2
You are responsible for arranging seating for a luncheon 
meeting for some visiting foreign business people and 
some Egyptians. Among the 12 Egyptians attending will 
be the Minister of Important Affairs (fictitious ministry), 
a distinguished scholar, three prominent business 
representatives, a university dean, a retired ambassador 
who advises the prime minister, the consul general assigned 
to your country and various other persons. Your home 
country’s delegation will be 12 people, among whom will 
be: the president and CEO of Conglomerate International, a 
corporate vice president from another company, the project 
developer (the person who actually did all the work to make 
the business deal possible and the person who actually 
knows the answers to any questions that might be raised), 
a representative from your country’s embassy in Cairo, 
yourself, and various other persons involved in the deal. How 
do you seat the people?
 Have four tables for six so everyone can sit with their own 
country’s people. They will want to sit with their friends 
anyway and catch up on the gossip.
 Have one long table with seats on each side and let people 
choose their own seat or assign seats. 
 Place six or eight people from your country at a head table, 
with the Egyptian contingency down each side along with 
the others from your country.
 Arrange for a horseshoe-styled table. Seat the three most 
prominent Egyptians and three most senior people from 
your country at the head table; alternate the remaining 

282 CultureShock! Egypt
seating between country representatives according 
to ranking (senior-most ranked persons closest to the 
head table).
Comments
Well, this one can be difficult because there might be some 
hidden relative status factors of which you are not aware.  is 
not good because it undermines your intent which is to foster 
an opportunity for cross-communication between Egyptian 
and home country people.  is equally inappropriate, but 
for a different reason. Choosing this option suggests that 
people from your home country are in some way superior to 
your Egyptian hosts—not the impression you want to give, 
assuming you want to do business in the country. 
 is a possibility, but better if you direct people to seats 
either across from or next to a person of similar status. 
The hazard of letting people choose their own seats is not 
with the Egyptians (they will undoubtedly assort according 
to rank), but with your home country participants. Your 
home country colleagues may well not recognise the 
importance of status in seating or how their position among 
the group is perceived. This could easily lead to a low-
ranking person sitting next to a very high-ranking Egyptian; 
after all, who wouldn’t want to sit next to a minister, 
for example. 
 gives you the best opportunity to recognise important 
persons from both groups. The tricky part then becomes 
determining who should sit at the head table. If there is a 
doubt about who should be recognised in this manner, ask a 
trusted Egyptian friend. In the example given, the Egyptians 
you would probably choose to sit at the head table would 
most likely be the minister, the retired ambassador and 
the visiting consul general. Among the visitors, you would 
probably choose the CEO, the embassy representative, and 
either the project director or the visiting company vice 
president, depending on how you perceive their importance. 
Since you are the organiser, you might also seat yourself at 
the head table, next to the podium so you can easily introduce 
your speakers.

SITUATION 3
You decide you want to have a few people over to your 
house for an informal gathering—just sitting around and 
talking. One of your favourite friends is a local taxi driver and 
entrepreneur (on the side). But you really want to have some 
of your Egyptian business acquaintances, some of whom are 
professors, over as well to meet some of your home country 
friends. Who do you invite?
 Invite them all over at once. They can all mingle around the 
punch bowl and buffet. It will be good for your Egyptian 
friends to meet people from different social strata. 
 Invite the taxi driver and his family at one time, your 
business acquaintances at another.
 Forget it, just invite foreign friends, it is easier.
Comments
It would not be socially appropriate to invite the taxi driver 
and business acquaintances at the same time. Choosing 
 would place all of your Egyptian friends in an awkward 
position and would not change the existing social structure 
one iota. Choosing  is the best choice for being able to 
share an evening with all of your Egyptian friends.  would 
certainly not insult anyone, but would definitely limit your 
social circle.
SITUATION 4
You are a man doing business in Egypt. Your colleague, 
Mr Moustafa, invites you to a meeting at his house for six 
o’clock on Wednesday evening. When you get there (you are 
15 minutes early), you hear scuffling behind the door and 
a small voice tells you, “No one is at home.”.
 You scream, “Of course you are home, I hear you.”
 You try to explain that you have a meeting with Mr 
Moustafa at six, but that you are a little early, and insist 
that you be allowed to come in.
 You try reason, explaining that your taxi just left and that 
it is too hot to wait on the porch.

284 CultureShock! Egypt
 You tell them who you are and that you will wait on the 
porch for Mr Moustafa to come home.
 You tell your taxi driver to wait before you go to the door, 
just in case no one is at home. After being told no one 
is there, you leave, go have a coffee or tea, and return in 
30 minutes to an hour later.
Comments
,  and  are definitely bad choices. Responses  or 
 are acceptable, but probably  is preferable under the 
circumstances. The reason you got the response you did was 
because there were only women at home when you called; 
or possibly it was a servant answering the door. In this case, 
it would be inappropriate for you to be allowed into the 
house. The first mistake was coming early. For one thing, 
because of the problems with Cairo traffic, Mr Moustafa may 
have been delayed in traffic. Alternatively, even though Mr. 
Moustafa told you to be there at six, he may not really expect 
you to be exactly on time, much less early. To avoid this kind 
of situation, a couple of things could be done. First, don’t 
come early. Second, you could stop somewhere close to Mr 
Moustafa’s house and use a public phone to determine if he 
is there or you could call before you leave just to reconfirm 
that Mr Moustafa will be there when you arrive. In any event, 
give Mr Moustafa a little extra time and never challenge the 
word of the woman answering the door.
SITUATION 5
You (a woman) and three of your women friends are out 
shopping and need a taxi to take you back home. It is a busy 
time of day and taxis are hard to find.
 You all decide to get into one small taxi which will hold 
only three in the back so that one of you must sit in the 
front seat with the driver.
 Even though it will cost more and may take more time, you 
get two taxis, so two can sit comfortably in each one.
 You decide to wait until you see one of the station wagon-
sized taxis. Although you may have to wait for some time 

285
Culture Quiz
and it will cost a little more than one small taxi, a station 
wagon will allow all of the women to travel together while 
sitting in a back seat.
Comments
Either  or  is appropriate. Although each of these options 
is inconvenient and will cost more, they are the better choice 
because a good Egyptian woman (unless she is very old) 
would not consider sitting in the front seat with a taxi driver. 
To do so might invite the driver to make advances to you and 
could be seen as a sexual come-on. 

286
DO’S AND DON’TS
I have made so many cultural blunders that I struggle to 
determine which belong to the ‘most common’ category. 
Here are some you should keep in mind. 
DO’S
 Ask when you don’t understand something 
 
No one will be insulted or think you are dumb if you say, 
“Should I think of this like an American or Egyptian?” If 
you don’t know what is expected of you, ask, “What am 
I expected to do?” or “What am I expected to wear?” or 
“What is the proper way to address him/her?” If you don’t 
know what something means, just ask. Most Egyptians 
will be all too willing to assist you. 
 Respect your Egyptian hosts and you are more likely to 
be respected in return
 
I feel almost foolish stating something this obvious. But 
I have seen many expatriates who look down their noses 
at their Egyptian hosts and regard them as somehow 
inferior. If you do that, it is little wonder why your hosts 
view you with contempt.
 Attend to your own personal cultural needs 
 
You can’t, nor should you, renounce your own cultural 
values in an effort to fit into the Egyptian milieu. Sure, you 
should respect your host’s values, but also remember to 
respect your own. In every day practice, you will probably 
find some sort of middle ground that accommodates both 
world views. 
 Women, do sit next to women on public transportation. 
You are much less likely to get unwanted attention if you, 
for example, take the front car on the undergound train.
 Do be sensitive when discussing the Egyptian government, 
religion, culture and law. 
 Do wear sunscreen and keep insect repellent available.
 Do avoid off-road travel. Unless you are travelling with 
a guide or someone who knows the area, you should 
not be there. Remember, there are still some unspent 

287
landmines in some parts of Egypt. It is my understanding 
that they are behind fences, but can also move with the 
shifting sand.
 Do avoid drinking brands of hard liquor you are not 
familiar with.
DON’T
 Don’t overestimate your understanding of the Egyptian 
world 
 
It seems that as soon as I think I understand what’s 
expected of me, I miscalculate a small item, and there I 
go again. So, I would have to say foreigners’ number one 
blunder is to think they have actually become multicultural. 
You haven’t and probably won’t even approach a good 
multicultural understanding of the Egyptian world without 
many years of immersion. But you can avoid some of the 
most frequent cultural faux pas by remembering that you 
still have much to learn.
 Don’t over- or underestimate your Egyptian colleague’s 
understanding of your language or your culture
 
Thinking people understand what I mean when I say or 
do something ranks number two on my list. Why? On 
the surface, it seems a simple proposition—say what 
you mean and you will be understood. Not so! Language 
is inescapably intertwined with cultural practices 
and symbolism. 
 
 
Let me give you a recent example of how I blundered 
with this one. Following an email request for information, 
I mistakenly wrote a response to a very Westernised, 
educated Egyptian friend stating something to the effect 
of, ‘Oh, by the way, this is what I do for a living. Please tell 
them we need to negotiate a contract and I will be happy to 
provide the information’. Because my friend was so aware 
of Western practices, I assumed we were talking on Western 
terms, not Egyptian. Big, big mistake! Well, it doesn’t take 
a rocket scientist to figure out my mistake. By assuming 
we were talking on Western rather than Egyptian terms, 
I had inadvertently broken all the rules of friendship. He 
had asked me, as a friend, for information. Yet I responded 

288 CultureShock! Egypt
as a Westerner would in a business proposal. Fortunately, 
he, too, realised what had happened and started thinking 
American. In general, however, don’t count on most 
Egyptians thinking things your way. Even if they have a 
very good command of the language, subtleties will be 
overlooked! Also, we Westerners, especially Americans, 
use words in English differently at different times and in 
different places. Someone whose native language is not 
English may know only one or possibly two meanings 
for a word or a ‘sound-alike’ word. The subtleties of word 
usage are not always known by someone who is not from 
where you originate.
 Don’t assume you belong
 
I recently made the exact opposite blunder. I requested 
information I needed from an Internet community to 
which I belong. I assumed that because I was a member, 
it did not matter that I was American. Wrong again! 
The list master politely informed me that I needed to 
take out an advertisement on their webpage if I wanted 
information from the group to use for ‘proprietary’ 
purposes. The cultural blunder? I assumed we were 
talking in Egyptian terms. I had asked as a friend and 
member of the community for assistance, and received 
a response in American business terms. Oh well, live 
and learn!
 Don’t get drunk and rowdy in public, and don’t even 
consider driving drunk in Egypt 
 
Yes, it is true that Islam forbids alcohol consumption. It 
is also true that alcohol consumption is legal in Egypt. 
Do Egyptians drink alcohol? Some do, which explains 
the need for the new drunk-driving penalties. Am I telling 
you it is a cultural blunder to drink alcohol in Egypt? Yes 
and no. What I am saying is that the perception of alcohol 
consumption is somewhat hypocritical. Egyptians assume 
that if you are from the West, you must drink alcohol. 
This is based on overgeneralisation and the practices 
Egyptians see among tourists. Do bear in mind that 
alcohol consumption is perceived as a major example of 
foreign decadence. My suggestion is this: if you are going 

289
Do’s and Don’ts
to drink alcohol, keep public consumption minimal. No 
sense asking for contempt or trouble.
 Don’t sit on, climb on or touch archaeological monuments. 
There will likely be someone in a uniform, or a monument 
guard that will tell you if you make this mistake! And, in 
no uncertain terms!
 Don’t be surprised to see Egyptian men holding hands. 
Women, too, can hold hands or link arms. It doesn’t mean 
they are gay.
 Couples, don’t show too much affection in public. 
Handholding is OK.
 Don’t drive without an international driver’s licence. I still 
don’t drive there, but definitely would not want to get into 
an accident without a proper licence.
 Don’t try to come close to diplomatic convoys. Just makes 
sense—no sense tempting fate! 
 Don’t swim when and where a black flag is raised; it means 
the surf is too rough.
 Don’t sunbathe topless, though Western-style swimsuits 
are acceptable on some beaches.
 Don’t carry a lot of money, but do carry a lot of small 
change for tips. 
 Don’t visit mosques during prayer time.
 Women, don’t enter a mosque without covering your head. 
Make sure your arms and legs are covered as well.
 Don’t bring illegal drugs into Egypt and don’t attempt to 
buy drugs there.
 Don’t drink on the street—make sure you are at a 
designated bar, disco or at a private residence—unless 
you are in a tourist place where this is common.
 Don’t smoke, eat or drink in public during the month 
of Ramadan.

RESOURCE GUIDE 
I have done my best to get accurate telephone numbers and 
Internet addresses. However, the reader should note that 
Egypt is undergoing such rapid growth that numbers and 
addresses may change by the time you try to access them. If 
you do find yourself in a situation where a number or address 
has changed and have access to the Internet, check there 
first. Alternatively, almost anyone at a major hotel, especially 
in a business centre, will be able to assist you. You can also 
check with the folks at the Internet cafés.

EMERGENCIES AND HEALTH 
I have compiled a list of emergency telephone numbers 
for Cairo (unless noted otherwise) that I hope will be of 
help. Telephone numbers in Egypt change rapidly, so be 
sure to double-check that prefixes have not changed since 
publication. Also, Dr Sameh M Arab, MD, wrote a good 
article entitled ‘Medical Emergencies in Egypt’, which can

As a general rule, medical facilities are adequate for non-
emergency matters; however, emergency and intensive 
care facilities are limited. People will likely tell you that you 
should bring your own syringe when you are going to need 
an injection; however, when I have had to access services of 
this sort, I found that the modern laboratories/clinics utilise 
the one-use, disposable syringes so there was no need. When 
in doubt, just ask.

ACCOMMODATION
One of the best ways to secure a flat or villa in Egypt is 
through word-of-mouth or by asking doormen (bawwabs) in 
a neighbourhood you like. For high-end flats, you might want 
to contact a commissioned broker (simsar). As a last resort, 
you might try checking the newspapers. 
Hotels
Well, like everyone else, I have developed my ‘favourite’ or 
most frequented hotel for Cairo. It is the Carlton Hotel near 
the Cinema Rivoli in Azbakeya. The Carlton is a 3-star hotel

With its Old World ambiance, this hotel was once very 
popular among Egyptologists but now is more favoured 
by university students, so with its budget pricing it may 
be a very nice choice for young travellers. There is a 
restaurant, and some rooms have private baths. Not a 
place for children or those who don’t want something not 
quite so modern, but it is clean, friendly and a place for 
pretty good food. It’s located behind the Intercontinental 
Semiramis. Just ask for directions at the Semiramis.

Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1971. 
 Out of print, but you may be able to find this in a 
second-hand bookshop. I found some copies listed on 
Amazon.com. It remains probably the best history of the 
development of Cairo. 
Veiled Sentiments: Honor and Poetry in a Bedouin Society. Lila 
Abu-Lughod. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2000.
 This is a compelling ethnography based on the author’s 
living with Bedouins in the Egyptian Western desert that 
is hard to put down.
The Koran Interpreted: A Translation. Arthur J Arberry. New 
York, NY: Touchstone, 1996.
 Many scholars regard this as the most literary English 
translation of the Qur’an. 
Egyptian Religion Egyptian Ideas of the Future Life. E A Wallis 
Budge. New York, NY: Cosimo Books, 2005. 
 Originally published in 1899, you may find this book 
tedious, but it is worth it if you are interested in ancient 
Egyptian religion. In particular, this book discusses how 
ancient Egyptians regarded resurrection and future life. 
The major source is the collection of religious papyri 
named the ‘Book of the Dead’. If you are interested in 
the topic, see also Budge’s works entitled The Book of the 
Dead (New York, NY: Gramercy Books, 1995) and Egyptian 
Magic (Whitefish, MT: Kessinger Publishing, 2003). 
Islam: The Straight Path. John Esposito. New York, NY: Oxford 
University Press, Inc, 2004.
 Put together with Esposito’s Islam and Politics (Syracuse, 
NY: Syracuse University Press, 1998), you can get a good 
introduction to Islam and the issues related to modern 
Islamic activism.

Further Reading
Kafr El-Elow: Continuity and Change in an Egyptian Community. 
Hani Fakhouri. Longrove, IL: Waveland Press Inc, 1987. 
 Dry reading in a standard anthropology ethnographic style, 
but informative. What is important about the information 
in the book is its analysis of change occurring in an 
industrial, urban village that has a traditional folk-peasant 
cultural base. 
Middle Eastern Muslim Women Speak. Ed. Elizabeth Warnock 
Fernea and Basima Qattan Bezirgan. Austin, TX: University 
of Texas Press, 1978.
 Fernea (B J to friends) is known for her warmth and 
humanistic style of writing which gives the reader an in-
depth understanding of women throughout the Middle 
East. This anthology, edited by Fernea and Bezirgan, 
addresses areas other than Egypt, but has several 
poignant articles directly related to women in Egypt. 
Highly recommended for anyone interested in women in 
the Middle East. Also, try looking at other books written 
by Fernea (such as Guests of the Sheikh or Women and the 
Family in the Middle East). Once you start reading, you will 
find her powerful work difficult to put down! 
Nubian Ethnographies. Elizabeth Warnock Fernea and Robert 
A Fernea. Longrove, IL: Waveland Press Inc, 1990.
 For anyone interested in this important subculture within 
Upper Egypt, the Ferneas’ description of life and hardships 
associated with being Nubian during this century captures 
your imagination and provides intricate details on this 
important group. You will gain exhaustive information 
about the Nubian relocation that resulted from the building 
of the Aswan High Dam. 
Managing Cultural Differences: Leadership Strategies for a 
New World of Business. Philip R Harris and Robert T Moran.
Burlington, MA: Gulf Professional Publishing, 2000.

business, this book provides a basis for understanding 
the nature of cultural differences as they affect business. 

322 CultureShock! Egypt

and one short section specifically addressing Egypt. It

Valley of the Golden Mummies: The Greatest Egyptian Discovery 
Since Tutankhamon. Zahi Hawass. New York, NY: Harry N 
Abrams, 2000; London, UK: Virgin Books, 2000.
 An exciting find in 1999 located in the Bahariya Oasis west 
of Cairo has yielded numerous golden shrouded mummies. 
‘In the winter of 1996, a guard at the temple of Alexander 
the Great near Bahariya, Egypt, reported an astounding 
discovery: during a routine patrol, he had been startled 
when the donkey he had been riding fell into a hole. Helping 
the donkey out of its predicament, the guard saw that the 
hole was in fact an opening into a tomb–and one from 
which a mummy’s golden face peered.’ I can hardly wait 
for more publications on this important new site.
Bedouin Life in the Egyptian Wilderness. Joseph J Hobbs. 
Austin, TX: University of Texas Press, 1992.
 This book is an interesting study of nomadic life among 
the Bedouins of Egypt. Not nearly as readable as Mahfouz 
or Fernea, it still provides important information on the 
beliefs, values, folklore and ethnobotany of this small group 
of Egyptians.
A History of the Arab Peoples. Albert Hourani. London, UK: 
Faber and Faber, 2005.
 Actually, reading any of the myriad of articles or books 
written by Professor Hourani will give you an outstanding 
synthesis of 1,400 years of political, cultural and social 
events in the Middle East as well as useful information 
regarding more specific issues in the region.

 Of the basic travel guide books, I like this one best. This 
book is quite helpful and easy to carry around. It has no 
in-depth information on the antiquities, but has a wealth 
of information on places to go and see other than Egypt’s 
ancient past. The maps are all right, but difficult to read. 
The Cairo Trilogy: Palace Walk, Palace of Desire, and Sugar 
Street. Naghib Mahfouz. London, UK & New York, NY: 
Everyman’s Library, 2001. 
 Naguib Mahfouz was the first Egyptian author to win the 
Nobel Prize for Literature. Start The Cairo Trilogy with Palace 
Walk and work your way through all three. In addition to 
these, Respected Sir (1986) is an excellent example of 
his later writing. These books address one of the most 
characteristic features of dealing with contemporary 
Egyptian life: the labyrinthine bureaucracy. Actually, you 
will enjoy anything he wrote. His style is clear and you 
always think you are part of the scene.
The Arabs. Peter Mansfield. Penguin History Series. London, 
UK & New York, NY: Penguin Books, 1992.
 This is a good, readable introduction to the political 
and social history of the modern Arab world. Important 
because Arab society affects Egypt and the modern Middle 
East.
A Short History of Modern Egypt. Afaf Al-Sayyed Marsot.  
Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1985.
 For a good general history of Egypt since 1800, read this 
book. It is a good place to get an initial familiarity with the 
political and historical forces that shaped contemporary 
Egypt.

324 CultureShock! Egypt
Understanding Arabs: A Guide for Westerners. Margaret K 
Nydell. Boston, MA: Intercultural Press Inc, 2002.
 This book is especially helpful for total newcomers to 
the cultures of the Middle East. Although most of the 
examples are general and not specific to Egypt, much of 
the content applies throughout the Arab speaking world. 
It is particularly useful as a quick guide for understanding 
many of the linguistic nuances in the region.
Egypt: The Blue Guide. Veronica Seton-Williams and Peter 
Stocks. New York, NY: W W Norton Co, 1993 (3rd edition). 
 This is probably the best, in-depth coverage of any of the 
guidebooks related to Egyptian Antiquities, though it will 
not have coverage on the more recent archaeological finds. 
It focuses a lot on architecture and includes copious details 
and maps, but is rather heavy to drag around with you. 
The Oxford Illustrated History of Ancient Egypt. Ian Shaw. New 
York, NY: Oxford University Press, USA, 2002. 
 Written for someone who truly wants accurate history. 
Very accurate based on the contemporary archaeological 
record, but some may find it dull reading. 
 
Global Studies: The Middle East. William Spencer. New York, 
NY: McGraw-Hill/Dushkin Publishing, 2008.
 This reader is short, sweet, and to the point. It provides a 
series of articles for understanding events in the Middle 
East and a country report with pertinent data for each 
country in the region. Not a hardcore academic’s choice, 
but excellent information.
The Egypt of Nasser and Sadat: The Political Economy of Two 
Regimes. John Waterbury. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University 
Press, 1983. 
 This book addresses the socialist transformation of Egypt 
during the regimes of Nasser and Sadat and discusses 
many reasons for its failure. If you are interested in political 
economy, also see Waterbury’s other works on the area.
