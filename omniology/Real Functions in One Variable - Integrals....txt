Preface
Preface
In this volume I present some examples of Integrals, cf. also Calculus 1a, Functions of One Variable.
Since my aim also has been to demonstrate some solution strategy I have as far as possible structured
the examples according to the following form
A Awareness, i.e. a short description of what is the problem.
D Decision, i.e. a reﬂection over what should be done with the problem.
I Implementation, i.e. where all the calculations are made.
C Control, i.e. a test of the result.
This is an ideal form of a general procedure of solution. It can be used in any situation and it is not
linked to Mathematics alone. I learned it many years ago in the Theory of Telecommunication in a
situation which did not contain Mathematics at all. The student is recommended to use it also in
other disciplines.
One is used to from high school immediately to proceed to I. Implementation. However, examples
and problems at university level are often so complicated that it in general will be a good investment
also to spend some time on the ﬁrst two points above in order to be absolutely certain of what to do
in a particular case. Note that the ﬁrst three points, ADI, can always be performed.
This is unfortunately not the case with C Control, because it from now on may be diﬃcult, if possible,
to check one’s solution. It is only an extra securing whenever it is possible, but we cannot include it
always in our solution form above.
I shall on purpose not use the logical signs. These should in general be avoided in Calculus as a
shorthand, because they are often (too often, I would say) misused. Instead of ∧I shall either write
“and”, or a comma, and instead of ∨I shall write “or”. The arrows ⇒and ⇔are in particular
misunderstood by the students, so they should be totally avoided. Instead, write in a plain language
what you mean or want to do.
It is my hope that these examples, of which many are treated in more ways to show that the solutions
procedures are not unique, may be of some inspiration for the students who have just started their
studies at the universities.
Finally, even if I have tried to write as careful as possible, I doubt that all errors have been removed.
I hope that the reader will forgive me the unavoidable errors.

Example 1.1 Calculate the integrals
(1)

x ex dx,
(2)

x ex2 dx.
A. Integration.
D. Apply partial integration in (1), and integration by a substitution in (2).
I. 1) We get by a partial integration

x ex dx = x ex −

1 · ex dx = x ex −ex = (x −1) ex.
2) Applying the substitution u = x2, du = 2x dx, we get

x ex2 dx = 1

Example 1.2 Calculate the integrals
(1)

3x cos2 x dx,
(2)

2x2 cos x dx.
A. Integration.
D. In (1) we use integration ny the substitution u = x2, and in (2) we apply partial integration.
I. 1) When u = x2, we see that du = 2x dx, so

3x cos x2 dx
=


u=x2 cos u du =

2 sin u

u=x2

2) In this case we get by a series of partial integrations that

2x2 cos x dx = 2x2 sin x −4

x · sin x dx
= 2x2 sin x + 4x · cos x −4x

1 · cos x dx

2) Linear diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order, where one possibly should apply the result from (1).

Write a MAPLE programme for the ﬁrst integral.
A. Integral.
D. Find convenient substitutions:
1) Since the structure of the denominator is

u2 −1, choose u = cosh t.
2) Since the structure of the denominator is

1 −u2, choose by analogy u = cos t, (where u = sin t
also would give us the result).

Example 2.5 Explain why

1

1 −(1 −x2)
d

1 −x2 = Arcsin

1 −x2.
This integral can be found in many ways. The following three functions can actually all be used for
x ∈]0, 1[:
−Arcsin x,
−Arccos

1 −x2,
Arccos x.
Explain why a calculation of the integral can give four diﬀerent results.
What is the relationship between those four functions?
A. Discuss an integral and prove that four apparent diﬀerent functions are all integrals of the same
integrand.
D. 1) Substitute.
2) Diﬀerentiate the claimed integrals and ﬁnd their relationships for x ∈]0, 1[ by insertion of one
point.
I. 1) It is obvious that we must assume that x ∈] −1, 1[. When we substitute t =
√
1 −x2 we get

1

1 −(1 −x2)
d

1 −x2
=

t=
√
1−x2
dt
√
1 −t2
=
[Arcsin t]t=
√
1−x2 = Arcsin

1 −x2.
2) Now let x ∈]0, 1[. Then we get (apart from constants)

1

1−(1−x2)
d

1−x2
=

1
√
x2 ·
−x
√
1−x2 dx
=


dx
√
1−x2 =

−Arcsin x,
Arccos x.
We get by another rearrangement,


1 −(1 −x2)
d

1 −x2
=


−

1

1 −(1 −x2)
d

1 −x2

=
−Arccos

1 −x2.
Hence, the four functions Arcsin
√
1 −x2, −Arcsin x, −Arccos
√
1 −x2 and Arccos x are all
integrals of the same function in ]0, 1[. They only diﬀer from each other by a constant in the
interval ]0, 1[.
When x =
1
√
2 ∈]0, 1[, we get
Arcsin

1 −x2 = Arcsin
1
√
2 = π
4 ,
−Arcsin x = −Arcsin

√
2 = −π

−Arccos

1 −x2 = −Arccos

Thus when x ∈]0, 1[,
Arcsin

1 −x2
=
Arccos x = π
2 −Arcsin x
=
π
2 −Arccos

1 −x2,
and we have found the not surprising relationship between the four functions.

This substitution is not monotonous. However, the factor

A. Integration by a substitution.
D. Introduce the substitution and integrate.
I. The substitution x = sinh t, t = Arsinh x, is monotonous and dx = cosh t dt, where cosh t > 0. By

 
1 −x2 dx = −1

2 x

1 −x2.
Hence the right hand side is an integral in the closed interval [−1, 1], and nevertheless Arccos x is not
diﬀerentiable for x = ±1. Explain this apparent contradiction.
A. Integration. Neither Arccos x nor x
√
1 −x2 are diﬀerentiable for x = ±1. The right hand side er
continuous in [−1, 1].
D. Prove that the right hand side is an integral of

By continuity this must also hold in the end points.
Note that the two “singularities” of −1
2 Arccos x and 1
2 x
√
1 −x2 in ±1 are cancelled by the
diﬀerentiation, so the sum of them becomes diﬀerentiable.
Example 2.13 1) Prove the formula

2) Then calculate the integral

3) Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation

4) Indicate that solution x = ϕ(t), for which ϕ(0) = −1.
A. Derive a formula. Find an integral. Solve a non-normed linear diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order.
Notice that (1) and (2) have already been treated in Example 2.11.
D. Start from the beginning. Remember the tests.

Here,
P(t) =

hence a solution of the homogeneous equation is

ϕ(t).
2) Introduce the substitution x = ϕ(t) into (1), and then calculate the integral.

Figure 1: The graph of the function t =

3 −x, x ∈[0, 3[.
I. 1) Let x ∈[0, 3[. Then
x
3 −x is continuous. Since the numerator is strictly increasing and the
denominator is strictly decreasing, we conclude that the function itself is strictly increasing,
hence strictly monotonous. This means that t =

x
3 −x has an inverse function ϕ(t), the
domain of which is the range [0, +∞[ of t =

x
3 −x, x ∈[0, 3[. By squaring followed by an
inversion we get
3 −x
x
= 3
x −1 = 1

i.e.
3
x = 1 + 1
t2 = 1 + t2

hence,
x = ϕ(t) =

Example 3.6 Let the function g(x) be given by
g(x) =

x > 0,
by an application of the substitution given by
t =

x
x + 2.
A. An integration with a disguised substitution.
D. Follow the hints in the guidelines.
I. 1) The easiest way is simply to show that the equation
(2) t =

x
x + 2 ∈]0, 1[,
has a unique solution x > 0, and ﬁnd this solution.
Since t > 0, we see that (2) is equivalent to that equation which is obtained by squaring,
t2 =
x
x + 2 = x + 2 −2
x + 2
= 1 −
2
x + 2,
from which
2
x + 2 = 1 −t2,
dvs.
x + 2 =
2
1 −t2 ,
and thus
x =
2
1 −t2 −2 = 2 ·
t2
1 −t2 > 0
for t ∈]0, 1[,
and the claim is proved.
2) We have according to (1),
x = g−1(t) =
2t2
1 −t2 ,
t ∈]0, 1[.
Thus we immediately get

Decomposition
Example 4.1 Write the following polynomials as a product of polynomials of ﬁrst degree and of second
degree without real roots:
(1) P(x) = x4 −3x3 −6x2 + 8x,
(2) P(x) = x4 −1.
Decompose the fraction
P(x)
Q(x) = x2 + 3x + 8
x3 −x2 −2x.
Write a MAPLE programme which gives the decomposition.
A. Splitting of polynomials followed by a decomposition.
D. Guess the roots in (1) and (2).
In the latter fraction we factorize the denominator and then
decompose.
I. 1) It is immediately seen by inspection that the roots are x = 0 and x = 1, hence x(x−1) = x2 −x
is a divisor in the polynomial:
x4 −3x3 −6x2 + 8x = x(x −1)(x2 −2x −8).
Since x2 −2x −8 = (x −4)(x + 2), we get the factorization
x4 −3x3 −6x2 + 8x = (x + 2)x(x −1)(x −4),
and the four simple roots are −2, 0, 1 and 4.
2) By a small rearrangement we get
x4 −1 =

x22 −1 =

x2 −1
 
x2 + 1

= (x + 1)(x −1)

x2 + 1

.
The simple, real roots are ±1, and we have furthermore the two simple, complex roots ±i.
(x + 1)(x −1)(x2 + 1).
3) First ﬁnd the factors of the denominator Q(x),
Q(x) = x3 −x2 −2x = x(x2 −x −2) = x(x + 1)(x −2).
Since the numerator P(x) has lower degree than the denominator Q(x), we get by the standard
procedure that
P(x)
Q(x)
=
x2 + 3x + 8
(x + 1)x(x −2)

I. 1) We miss one term of the type

Remark. Roughly speaking
c1
(x −1)2 shades the terms of lower order
c
x −1, when we apply the
standard procedure on the factor in the denominator under consideration. The message is that
one should always ﬁrst reduce and then repeat the method on the reduced expressions, in which
the degree of the denominator has become smaller. ♦
Example 4.4 Decompose the fractions

Q(x) = x2 + 3x + 8
x3 −x2 −2x,
(2) P(x)
Q(x) = 2x6 + x4 −2x2

A. Decomposition; in (2) the degree of the numerator is bigger than the degree of the denominator.
D. Factorize the polynomials of the denominators and decompose by the standard procedure. In (2)
we ﬁrst perform a division by polynomials.
I. 1) When the denominator is factorized we get
x3 −x2 −2x = x(x2 −x −2) = x(x + 1)(x −2).
Thus, if x ̸= −1, 0, 2, then
P(x)
Q(x) = x2 + 3x + 8
x3 −x2 −2x =
x2 + 3x + 8

2) Here the denominator is factorized in the following way,
x4 −1 = (x2)2 −1 = (x2 −1)(x2 + 1) = (x −1)(x + 1)(x2 + 1).
First perform a division by polynomials, then use the trick of ﬁrst decomposing after x2 and
ﬁnally after x. For x ̸= ±1 we get

an−1 = −(α1 + α2 + · · · + αn)
and
a0 = (−1)nα1 · α2 · · · αn.
A. A theoretical investigation of a polynomial. When n = 2 the formulæ are known from high school

D. Write P(x) in two ways and identify the coeﬃcients.
I. By a simple combinatoric argument we get

x2 −(α1 + · · · + αn)xn−1 + · · · + (−1)nα1 · · · αn
=
x2 + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0.
Since the coeﬃcients of two identical polynomials agree we get
an−1 = −(α1 + · · · + αn)
og
a0 = (−1)nα1 · · · αn,
i.e. the sum of the roots is always equal to −an−1, and the product of the roots is always equal to
(−1)na0.

Example 4.10 1) Prove that if x = α is a treble root in the polynomial P(x), then
(3) P(α) = P ′(α) = P ′′(α) = 0.
2) Conversely, prove that if (3) holds, then x = α is a root of P(x) of at least multiplicity 3.
3) The condition (3) holds for every root, the multiplicity of which is bigger than or equal to 3. How is
it possible by means of the derivatives of P(x) to decide whether the multiplicity of the root x = α
is precisely 3?
4) The ﬁgure 3 is in this connection not special. Formulate the general result.
A. Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial.
D. Go straight to the general case, because n = 3 is only a special case.
I. Let x = α be a root of the polynomial of multiplicity n ∈N, i.e. there exists a polynomial Q(x),
such that
P(x) = (x −α)n Q(x),
Q(α) ̸= 0.

Then by successive diﬀerentiations,
P ′(x)
=
n(x −α)n−1Q(x) + (x −α)nQ1(x),
P ′′(x)
=
n(n −1)(x −α)n−2Q(x) + (x −α)n−1Q2(x),
...
P (n−1)(x)
=
n(n −1) · · · 2 · (x −α)Q(x) + (x −α)2Qn−1(x),
P (n)(x)
=
n! Q(x) + (x −α)Qn(x),
where Q1(x), · · · , Qn(x) are polynomials occurring by the diﬀerentiations. Due to the factor x−α
it follows that
P(α) = P ′(α) = P ′′(α) = · · · = P (n−1)(α) = 0,
and
P (n)(α) = n! Q(α) ̸= 0.
Thus we have proved that if x = α is a root of multiplicity n ∈N of the polynomial P(x), then
(4) P(α) = P ′(α) = · · · = P (n−1)(α) = 0
and
P (n)(α) ̸= 0.
Conversely, if (4) holds, then x = α is a root (because P(α) = 0), hence x = α must have a
multiplicity m ∈N. From the result above follows that
P(α) = P ′(α) = · · · = P (m−1)(α) = 0
og
P (m)(α) ̸= 0.
Since we assumed (4), this is only true if m = n. Thus,
• x = α is a root of multiplicity n ∈N in the polynomial P(x), if and only if
P(α) = P ′(α) = · · · = P (n−1)(α) = 0
oand
P (n)(α) ̸= 0.
Remark. Another and more direct method is to develop the Taylor expansion from x = α. Then
P(x)
=
P(α) + P ′(α)
1!
(x −α) + · · · + P (n−1)(α)
(n −1)! (x −α)n−1
+P (n)(α)
n!
(x −α)n + · · · .
It follows immediately, that if
P(α) = P ′(α) = · · · = P (n−1)(α) = 0
and
P (n)(α) ̸= 0,
then (x−α)n is a divisor in P(x), hence x = α is a root of precisely order n, because P (n))(α) ̸= 0.
On the other hand, if x = α is a root of order n, then the Taylor expansion above shows that
P(α) = P ′(α) = · · · = P (n−1)(α) = 0
and
P (n)(α) ̸= 0.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Example 4.15 Decompose the fraction
12x + 7
(x −1)(x2 + 6x + 12).
A. Decomposition.
D. Apply the standard procedure and then reduce.
I. The degree of the numerator is lower than the degree of the denominator. Furthermore,
x2 + 6x + 12 = (x + 3)2 + 3 ≥3,
so the fraction is put into its canonical form.
By the method of blinding a factor of the denominator the coeﬃcient of
1
x −1 becomes
12 + 7
1 + 6 + 12 = 1,
hence

A. Decomposition.
D. “Blind the factors, etc.” and reduce.
I. Since x2 −2x + 5 = (x + 1)2 + 4 ≥4, and the numerator is of lower degree than the denominator,
we know that the structure of the decomposition is
3x2 + 2x + 5
(x + 2)(x2 −2x + 5) =

(−2)2 −2(−2) + 5

=

The decomposition is

A. A decomposition where the degree of the numerator is lower than the degree of the denominator,
followed by an integration.
D. Dissolve the denominator into factors and decompose, e.g. by “blinding the factors”.
I. Since
x4 −2x2 + 1 =

and the degree of the numerator is lower than the degree of the numerator, the structure of the

A. Integral with a latent decomposition.

A. Integration based on a decomposition and possibly some substitution (this will depend on the

Example 5.6 Calculate the integral

x2 + 4x −7
x3 −4x2 + 9x −10 dx
in each of the intervals, in which the integrand is continuous.
A. Integration by decomposition.
D. Dissolve the denominator and decompose before the integration.
I. First consider the denominator. The only possible rational roots are
x = ±1, ±2, ±5 and ± 10.
From this we get by inspection that
x3 −4x2 + 9x −10 = (x3 −4x2 + 4x) + (5x −10)
= x{x2 −4x + 4} + 5(x −2) = (x −2){x(x −2) + 5}
= (x −2){x2 −2x + 1 + 4} = (x −2){(x −1)2 + 4}.
The integrand is deﬁned and continuous in each of the intervals
] −∞, 2[
and
]2, +∞[.
By the decomposition we must have the structure
x2 + 4x −7
x3 −4x2 + 9x −10
=
x2 + 4x −7
(x −2)(x2 −2x + 5)
=
a
x −2 +
bx + c
x2 −2x + 5.
It follows immediately (“blind the factor”) that
a = 22 + 4 · 2 −7
22 −2 · 2 + 5 = 1,
hence

=

Example 5.7 Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
(1 −t4) dx
dt + 4tx = 2t(1 −t4),
t > 1.
A. A non-normed, linear, inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order, where the method of
guessing is not obvious.
D. First norm the equation.
Then ﬁnd the complete solution of the homogeneous equation, and
ﬁnally a particular solution by means of a solution formula. One shall use a decomposition during
these calculations.

2) The integral is

f(x) dx = ln(x + 3) + Arctan(x −2),
x > −3.
Example 5.9 1) Given that the polynomial
Q(x) = x5 −2x4 + 2x3 −4x2 + x −2
has the root 2. Write Q(x) as a product of factors of ﬁrst degree and irreducible factors of second
degree.

and calculate
 P(x)
Q(x) dx.
A. Integration via a decomposition.
D. 1) Divide by x −2 and analyze the resulting polynomial for further roots.
2) Use the splitting from the decomposition (1). The integrate.
I. 1) It is immediately seen that
Q(x)
=
(x5 −2x4) + (2x3 −4x2) + (x −2)
=
(x −2)(x4 + 2x2 + 1) = (x −2)(x2 + 1)2.
2) The structure of decomposition is

Then by a rearrangement,

Q.E.D.
Example 5.10 Find an integral of the function
f(x) =
x2 −5x + 5
(x2 −6x + 10)(x −3),
x > 3.
A. Integration via decomposition.
D. Start by a decomposition. We give three variants. Then integrate.
I. Since the degree of the numerator is lower than the degree of the denominator in the rational
function f(x), the decomposition must have the structure
f(x) =
x2 −5x + 4
(x2 −6x + 10)(x −3) =
A
x −3 +
Bx + C
x2 −6x + 10,
because x2 −6x + 10 = (x −3)2 + 1 ≥1 for every x ∈R.
We give three variants of the solution:
First variant. By “blinding the factor, etc.” x −3, we get
A =
 x2 −5x + 5
x2 −6x + 10

x=3
= 9 −15 + 5
9 −18 + 10 = −1.
Putting A = −1 we get by a rearrangement,
Bx + C
x2 −6x + 10
=
x2 −5x + 5
(x2 −6x + 10)(x −3) −
A
x −3
=
(x2 −5x + 5) + (x2 −6x + 10)
(x2 −6x + 10)(x −3)
=
2x2 −11x + 15
(x2 −6x + 10)(x −3)
=
2x −5
x2 −6x + 10.

Hence,
f(x) =
x2 −5x + 5
(x2 −6x + 10)(x −3) = −
1
x −3 +
2x −5
x2 −6x + 10.
Second variant. When we multiply by (x2 −6x + 10)(x −3) we get
x2 −5x + 5
=
A(x2 −6x + 10) + (Bx + C)(x −3)
=
(A + B)x2 + (−6A −3B + C)x + (10A −3C).

from which we get either by fumbling or by using Linear Algebra,
A = −1,
B = 2
og
C = −5,
i.e.
f(x) =
x2 −5x + 5
(x2 −6x + 10)(x −3) = −
1
x −3 +
2x −5
x2 −6x + 10.
Third variant. From x2 −6x+10 = (x−3)2 +1 we get by the substitution u = x−3, x = u+3,
that
x2 −5x + 5
(x2 −6x + 10)(x −3) = (x −3)2 + (x −3) −1
{(x −3)2 + 1}(x −3) = u2 + u −1

u
=
2u + 1
u2 + 1 −1
u = −
1
x −3 +
2x −5
x2 −6x + 10.
Fourth variant. (Sketch). Insert three diﬀerent x-values and solve the system of linear equations
in A, B and C. It is possible to get through by this method, but it is nevertheless the most
diﬃcult one, and since it does not have a unique variant, it shall not be given here in all details.
Integration. From x2 −6x+10 = (x−3)2 +1 > 0 follows for x > 3 via the decomposition above,

x2 −5x + 5
(x2 −6x + 10)(x −3) dx = −

Thus, xhom(t) is a solution of the homogeneous equation. since c ∈R is an arbitrary constant,

A. Integration via a decomposition.

I. The degree of the numerator is lower than the degree of the denominator, hence the fraction is given
in its canonical form. By blinding the factor x + 1 in the denominator we get that the coeﬃcient

A. Check two integrations.
D. Is the integrand, resp. the right hand side deﬁned in the given interval?
Diﬀerentiate the right hand side in order to get the integrand, i.e. test the indicated solutione.
The second result can be derived from the ﬁrst one.
I. and C. 1) If x ∈]pπ, (p + 1)π[, p ∈Z, then sin x ̸= 0 and tan x
2 are deﬁned and ̸= 0. The two
sides of the equation are there both deﬁned in the given interval.
Now let
f(x) = ln
&&&tan x
2
&&& ,
x ∈]pπ, (p + 1)π[,
p ∈Z.
Then by a diﬀerentiation

A. Simple Integrations.
D. In both cases we introduce a substitution, t = cos x in (1), and t = sin x in (2).


cos3 x sin x dx = −

2) If t = sin x, then dt = cos x dx, hence

A. A trigonometric integral. Here I shall take the liberty of demonstrating that I have found 12
variants. The purpose is to show that even if a textbook indicates a standard substitution, this
may not be the most convenient one to use (cf. 7th and 8th variant). The easiest method is of
course 1st variant, where a substitution known already from high school is applied.
D. Just go through all the variants.

relation we get

because the contribution from the additional interval

C. Test. It is possible to check the result, if we start by proving that

i = 1
2 n(n + 1).
Formula (5) is obvious for n = 1 and n = 2.
Assume that (5) holds for some n ∈N. Then for n + 1,

2 n(n + 1) + (n + 1) = 1

and the claim then follows by induction.

Example 7.6 Derive by means of the main theorem of the diﬀerential and integration calculus the
formula of the area of a disc of radius R. This is done by dividing the disc into small parallel strips
and then continue in two diﬀerent ways: First use an angle as the variable of integration, and then
use a distance as a variable of integration.
A. Derivation of the area of a disc.
D. We may assume that R = 1, because the general result then is obtained by a multiplication by
R2.

Example 7.8 Let P be a point in the ﬁrst quadrant of an XY coordinate system with origo O. Put
OP = r, and let v denote the angle (measured in radians) from the X axis to OP. The set of all
points P, for which r = v, deﬁnes the curve, which is shown on the ﬁgure.
Find the length s of this curve. This is done in the following way: Consider two neighbouring points
on the curve, P and Q, where the angle from the X axis to OP is v, and the angle from OP to
OQ is Δv, where Δv > 0, i.e. small. First prove that the arc PQ approximatively has the length
Δs =
√
1 + v2 Δv, and then ﬁnd s by a summation.
A. Curve length by a Riemann sum and a limit.
D. Sketch and analyze the ﬁgure. Find an approximative value of the length of a curve segment.
Notice that the curve is given in polar coordinates. Set up a Riemann sum and go to the limit.
Finally, calculate the integral by choosing a substitution.

Example 7.9 A ball of radius R has the surface area A = 4πR2 and the volume V = 4
3 πR3. We
note here that dV
dR = A. Give reasons for this formula by assuming the formula of the volume.
A. A direct derivation of a formula.
D. Consider the volumes V (R) and V (R −ΔR).
I. The volume of the shell between the radii R −ΔR and R is approximatively given by
V (R) −V (R −ΔR) ≈A(R) · Δ(R),
from which
V (R) −V (R −ΔR)
ΔR
≈A(R).
Then by taking the limit ΔR →0+ we get
dV
dR = A.

We are given two angles α and β, α < β, β −α ≤2π, and a continuous function ϕ : [α, β] →R+.
Corresponding to every angle θ ∈[α, β] consider the half line of direction θ and the points on this half
line, where the distance from O is smaller or equal to ϕ(θ). In this way we get the set A, and the task
is to ﬁnd a formula of the area of A.
1) Divide the interval [α, β] by the points θ0, θ1, . . . , θn. The area corresponding to the interval
[θi−1, θi] is then approximated by the circular sector given on the ﬁgure.
Find this approximation of the area of A.
2) Then set up a formula of the area of A.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Then split the annulus into small pieces of e.g. the same size (with respect to the angle). Since
each piece gives equal contribution to the moment of inertia, we can treat the annulus as a whole.
When e.g. the annulus is split into m pieces of equal size, we get the contribution 1
m of the total
from each of them, and m · 1
m = 1. The moment of inertia of the annulus is then approximately

Figure 21: The unit disc is rotated around the ordinate axis.
I. The area of the circle is πR2, and the mass M is spread homogeneously over the disc. Hence, the
density is
M
πR2 .
Let v ∈[0, π] and 0 < Δv << 1, such that v + Δv ≤π. Consider the domain between the two
vertical lines on the ﬁgure. Then the distance to the axis of rotation is approximately R cos v, and
the mass is approximately
M
πR2 · R sin v {R cos v −R cos(v + Δv)}
= M
π sin v {cos v −cos(v + Δv)}

π sin v {cos v −cos v · cos(Δ) + sin v · sin(Δv)}

≈M

because
1 −cos Δv ≈1
2 (Δv)2
og
sin Δv ≈Δv,
when Δv is small.
Then split the domain between the two vertical lines into small pieces of the same masse. However,
since the disc is homogeneous, this step is no longer necessary. The moment of inertia of this strip
is approximately
R2 cos2 v · M

where k > 0. Here x = x(t) denotes the distance of the particle from the point 0 to time t. (A coulomb

Find T.
4) The time T depends on the constant K from (7), thus it (of course) depends of the velocity of the
particle at the point x0. Derive from (7) this velocity x′(0) expressed by means of K, and then ﬁnd
the limit of T, when x′(0) →0.
A. By (7) we are given a non-linear diﬀerential equation for x in t. We shall ﬁnd an expression of the
inverse function t = t(x).
D. Find dx

guidelines of the example.

Example 9.3 The gravity on a particle of mass m at the distance x from the centre of the Earth is
given by K · m
x2 , where K = GM is the product of the constant of gravity and the mass of the Earth.
What is the work needed to move the particle from the surface of the Earth to inﬁnity? (Work =
force · path).
A. Mathematical model of the law of gravity.
D. First ﬁnd the inﬁnitesimal work from x to x + Δx.
I. Let R denote the radius of the Earth. There is no need to specify this further, since neither G nor
M are speciﬁed by numbers. Assume that the particle m is at distance x ≥R from the centre of
the Earth.
The work needed to take the particle from x to x + Δx is then

Example 9.4 Consider a particle, which falls towards the surface of the Earth from a height, only
under the inﬂuence of the gravity. We shall in this example derive a formula for the time T it takes
for the particle to hit the surface of the Earth.
Figure 25: A particle falls from H (the rightmost point) towards the Earth (the circle).
Denote by H the distance from the centre 0 of the Earth to the place, from which the particle starts
falling, and denote by R the radius of the Earth. Let x denote the actual distance from the point 0 to
the particle. Then it can be shown by Newton’s laws that
T = lim

Example 9.5 “Trees do not grow into the sky.” This statement illustrates one of the problems of
the description of the growth process of a closed ecological system. The simplest forms of growth like
linear and exponential growth can only to some extent describe the actual conditions.
Let us consider a limited domain. The number of individuals who can live on this domain is called B
( the carrying capacity of the domain). The rate of birth F is the fraction by which a given number
of individuals is reproducing per time unit. The rate of death D is the fraction which dies per time
unit. (If for instance D = 5 % = 0, 05 per time unit, then 100 individuals will be reduced by 5 per
time unit.)
We shall describe the task of how the number of individuals varies in time in such a domain. We shall
start by making precise the assumptions which our analysis is based on.
Let us assume that the rate of birth F is a constant, while the rate of death D = D(t) depends on both
the time and the number of individuals N = N(t) to time t. More precisely, we assume that
(8) D(t) = k · N(t),
k constant.
We shall furthermore assume that the situation in the domain is stable, which means that
(9)
 N(t) →B
for t →+∞,
D(t) →F
for t →+∞.

Finally, assume that N(t) is a diﬀerentiable function (which therefore not always takes on natural
numbers as values), and that the change ΔN in a small time interval Δt is given by
(10) ΔN = F · Δt · N −D · Δt · N.
1) Prove that k = F
B .
2) Explain the contents of the assumption (10) and prove that N(t) satisﬁes
(11) dN
dt = N

F −F
B N

.
3) Solve the diﬀerential equation
(12) dx
dt = x(b −ax),
0 < x < b
a,
t ≥0,
a, b ∈R+,
by separating the variables.
4) Prove that if N0 < B, then
N(t) =

e−F t
,
t ≥0.
A. A mathematical model of ecological growth, which can be formulated as a diﬀerential equation of
ﬁrst order, in which the variables can be separated.
D. There are given some guidelines. Follow these.
I. 1) It follows from the assumptions (8) and (9) that
k = D(t)
N(t) →B
F
for t →+∞.
Since k is a constant through the limit process, we have k = B
F .
2) The change ΔN of the number of population N is equal to the rate of birth F per time unit
multiplied by the length Δt of the time interval multiplied by the number of population N,
from which we shall subtract the analogous number for the decrease of the population, i.e. the
rate of death D per time unit multiplied by Δt and N.
We get from (10) by dividing by Δt > 0,
ΔN
Δt = F · N(t) −D(t) · N(t) = N

F −F
B N

,
where we according to (1) have substituted D = k · N = F
B · N. By the limit Δt →0+ we get
(11), i.e.
dN
dt = N

F −F
B N

4) Let N(0) = N0 < B. If x = N and b = F and a = F
