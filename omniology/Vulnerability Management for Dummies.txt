T
o a cyber criminal, vulnerabilities on a network are
hidden, high-value assets. When exposed, these vulnera-
bilities can be targeted for exploitation, which may result in
unauthorized entry into a network, can expose confidential
information, provide fuel for stolen identities, trigger theft of
business secrets, violate privacy provisions of laws and regu-
lations, or paralyze business operations.
New vulnerabilities appear every day due to flaws in software,
faulty configuration of applications and IT gear, and (dare we
say it?) good old human error. Whatever their source, vulnera-
bilities don’t go away by themselves. Their detection,
removal, and control require vulnerability management. VM,
as vulnerability management is called, is the regulated, contin-
uous use of specialized security tools and workflow that
actively help to eliminate exploitable risks.

Who’s at Risk?
The challenge for every business is to maintain a safe, open,
and interconnected network – making it easy to exchange
information with customers, suppliers, and business partners
around the world. 
Unfortunately, making this information both highly available
and secure is hard work. Worms, viruses, and other security
risks constantly threaten the theft of information and disrup-
tion of business operations. Moreover, the dramatic increase
in new vulnerabilities discovered each day – and the speed
with which new threats are created – make this challenge
even steeper.
Every single business with an Internet connection is at risk
due to network vulnerabilities. Whether you’re a small busi-
ness, a multinational corporation, or a government – it makes
no difference, you’re at risk.
The solution is to immunize your network from these security
threats by eliminating their origin: network vulnerabilities.
How Vulnerabilities Expose Your
Network to Danger
Vulnerabilities have plagued operating systems and software
applications from the earliest days of computing. They used
to be rare but now you read about successful attacks via the
Internet almost every day. Universal connectivity provided by
this global pathway gives hackers and criminals easy access
to your network and its computing resources. When your 
network-attached devices are running without current secu-
rity updates, these unpatched devices are immediately vulner-
able to a variety of exploits. Any business is susceptible if
vulnerabilities aren’t identified and fixed.

Where do vulnerabilities 
come from?
Programming mistakes cause most vulnerabilities in software.
A common mistake is failing to check the size of data buffers –
a kind of storage bin of memory where a computer process
executes its functions. When a buffer overflows, it overwrites
data in adjacent memory buffers. This corrupts the stack or
heap areas of memory, which may allow the execution of an
attacker’s code on that machine via a virus, worm, or other
unpleasant exploit.
Computer scientists estimate that about 5 to 20 bugs are pres-
ent in every thousand lines of software code, so it’s no surprise
to see regular announcements of new vulnerabilities with
related patches and workarounds. Your risk of vulnerabilities
grows with use of General Public License software, particularly
because implementers plug in untested modules of object-
oriented programming code. When the quality of code is mar-
ginal, bad, or just plain wrong, experts call it ‘non-robust’.
Modules of code placed in the public domain may include non-
robust implementations of Internet protocol standards, making
them easy targets for attack when used in a real-world network.
Vulnerabilities must be identified and eliminated on a regular
basis because new vulnerabilities are discovered every day.
For example, Microsoft releases advisories and patches on the
second Tuesday of each month – commonly called ‘Patch
Tuesday’.
Careless programmers aren’t the only source of vulnerabilities.
For example, improperly configuring security applications
such as a firewall may allow attackers to slip through ports
that should be closed. People using mobile devices may use
an unauthorized or even a malware-infested website without
going through the corporate virtual private network (VPN),
perhaps because the official VPN is a bother when people
want to surf MySpace, eBay, or the local online personal ads.
Letting your security guard down like this exposes devices
and the network to attacks. You can even trigger an attack 
just by clicking on an email attachment infected with malware.
Part I: Understanding the Need for Vulnerability Management

The exploitation of vulnerabilities via the Internet is a huge
problem requiring immediate proactive control and manage-
ment. That’s why companies need to use VM – to detect and
eliminate vulnerabilities in order to reduce overall security
risk and prevent exposure.
Looking more closely 
at attack trends 
Endless public disclosures in the news of data breaches reveal
the unauthorized exposure of millions of confidential con-
sumer records worldwide. This is adequate proof why organi-
zations must do more to protect networks from attack. But a
dramatic change in the security threat landscape is raising the
bar for organizations large and small that want to actively
minimize successful attacks on their vulnerabilities.
Recent data show that exploits are no longer restricted to tra-
ditional risks of generic viruses, worms, Trojans, and other
single-vector attacks. According to global research conducted
by Symantec Corporation, a fundamental change in threats
reveals movement ‘away from nuisance and destructive
attacks towards activity motivated by financial gain’. The
report characterizes five new trends (you can read the details
at www.symantec.com), including:
 Increased professionalism and commercialization of 
malicious activities.
 Threats that are increasingly tailored for specific regions. 
 Increasing numbers of multistaged attacks.
 Attackers targeting victims by first exploiting trusted
entities.
 Convergence of attack methods.
Respondents to the Computer Security Institute’s Computer
Crime and Security Survey report that financial fraud causes
the highest dollar amount of losses (31 per cent of total), com-
pared to viruses/worms/spyware (12 per cent), system pene-
tration by an outsider (10 per cent), or theft of confidential
data (8 per cent). Discover more from this 12-year series of
computer crime reports at www.gocsi.com.

The fallout from cyber attacks now poses serious financial
risk, so your organization needs to stop malware and other
attacks by deploying layers of security technology such as
anti-virus/anti-spyware software, firewall, intrusion detec-
tion/prevention, VPN, and encryption. Technologies like these
are essential components of network security, yet while
they’re effective in their own spheres of purpose, none per-
form the most fundamental of all security measures: vulnera-
bility management.
Detecting and Removing
Vulnerabilities
Vulnerability management has evolved from simply running a
scanner on an application, computer, or network to detect
common weaknesses. Scanning is an essential element of vul-
nerability management, but VM includes other technologies
and workflow that contribute to a bigger picture required for
controlling and removing vulnerabilities. The primary objec-
tives of VM are to:
 Identify and fix faults in the software that affect security,
performance, or functionality.
 Alter functionality or address a new security threat, such
as updating an antivirus signature.
 Change a software configuration to make it less suscepti-
ble to attack, run faster, or improve functionality.
 Use the most effective means to thwart automated
attacks (such as worms, bots, and so on).
 Enable the effective improvement and management of
security risks.
 Document the state of security for audit and compliance
with laws, regulations, and business policy.
Consistent, ongoing vulnerability management is difficult, if
not impossible to do on a manual basis. You have simply too
many moving parts to juggle and act on in a timely and cost-
effective manner. Repetitive tasks that regularly cycle through
all devices are enormously time consuming – and an inefficient
use of IT and network staff time. For this reason, organizations
Part I: Understanding the Need for Vulnerability Management
7

need to automate and simplify as much as they can for each
element of VM, which we cover in Part II. 
Getting Organized to Do VM
As you get ready to do vulnerability management, be sure 
to organize priorities for security. The fancy term for this 
step is policy management. Policy management determines
the controls required to ensure security, such as standard
Vulnerability Management For Dummies 
8
VM can automatically document 
regulatory compliance
A major benefit of vulnerability man-
agement is the built-in reports pro-
vided by VM software. Some of these
reports are good enough for docu-
mentation demanded by auditors
checking for regulatory compliance.
Security is a growing requirement for
financial transactions, health care
information, and information used in
many other forms of business auto-
mation solutions.
Legal network security requirements
are seen in a growing number of 
government and industry-specific
regulations for safeguarding the con-
fidentiality, integrity, and availability
of electronic data from information
security breaches. Organizations that
don’t fully comply and stay up-to-date
with security regulations face serious
potential consequences – including
fines and civil (sometimes criminal)
penalties. Part III tells you more
about VM and compliance.
As you find out more about VM in this
book, keep related regulations for
compliance in the back of your 
mind – especially as they relate to
your company. The regulations may
specify use of certain VM-related
processes or technologies. VM-
related technologies provide reports
such as those from scanning and
patch management systems. The
network and IT department use these
reports to document network secu-
rity audits and remediation, including
detailed, prioritized lists of existing
vulnerabilities related to severity of
risk, and verification of vulnerabilities
that were fixed with patches or work-
arounds.
The most important idea about com-
pliance is that VM can automate
much of what used to be an expen-
sive, time-consuming, manual proc-
ess. Getting the right VM solution can
not only protect your network and
data – it can also save you money
by automating daily chores for VM! 
Any business can easily automate
VM.

configurations for all security devices and applications includ-
ing antivirus, firewall, and intrusion detection/prevention.
Policies and controls should include servers, network serv-
ices, applications, and endpoints.
Policy management used to be a manual, cumbersome
process. New software tools can automate policy management
and enforce configurations on endpoint devices. Automation
saves time, improves accuracy, and lowers the total cost of
ownership.

ulnerability management (VM) means systematically
finding and eliminating network vulnerabilities. Many 
of the steps or processes for VM use technology. Other steps
need IT staff for implementation and follow-up. Integrating
these processes produces stronger network security and 
protection of your organization’s systems and data. To focus
efforts for successful VM, your organization needs to govern
all activity with clear security policies.
Putting Security Policies 
to Work with VM
‘Policy’ is one of those buzz-terms that can make an IT
expert’s eyes glaze over. But mastering the idea of policies for
vulnerability management does more than make an IT person
feel as important as a CEO or a politician. Security policies for

Vulnerability Management For Dummies 
12
VM make it easier to define actions that guide decision-
making about setting up your VM program. The result of good
policies makes it easier and faster for you and the IT security
team to discover vulnerabilities, remediate those security
holes, and produce documentation to satisfy audit require-
ments for compliance.
Policy creation and management for an enterprise starts at
the top of an organization and requires executive oversight 
to ensure systematic implementation. Here are some key 
considerations:
 Policies determine the nature of controls used to ensure
security, such as standard configurations for all security
devices and applications including antivirus, firewall, and
intrusion detection and prevention. IT security experts
should create a matrix with a short list of configurations
and features so that policy makers can understand their
options for security controls.
 Policies and controls apply to servers, network services,
applications, and endpoints.
 Policy makers need to determine the business impact of
vulnerability on each asset (or asset group). For example, a
system that hosts the lunch menu probably isn’t as impor-
tant as the system that maintains customer information or
financial data. Prioritization weighs the business risks and
importance of each asset, which affects the urgency and
completion order of vulnerability remediation.
Some organizations already use software for policy manage-
ment, risk correlation, and enterprise security management.
Look for VM solutions that include an application program-
ming interface (API) to allow automatic integration of existing
security policies with vulnerability management.
Step 1: Track Inventory 
and Categorize Assets
In order to fix vulnerabilities, you must first understand what
assets (such as servers, desktops, and devices) you have in
your network and then test to find any vulnerability that may
exist. 

Tracking inventory and categorizing assets establishes an
evaluation baseline. In this step, you create and continuously
maintain a database of all Internet Protocol (IP) devices
attached to the network. Here is where you connect the actual
assets in your network with the policies determining relative
business value for these assets.
Identifying your inventory
Vulnerability scanning is usually done by directing the scan-
ner at a particular IP address or range of addresses, so it’s
useful to organize your database by IPs. Figure 2-1 provides 
an example:
Figure 2-1: Creating the network asset database.
Elements in the asset groups include all hardware, software,
applications, services, and configurations. Tracking this level
of detail provides the following benefits:
 The data enables your organization to identify which 
vulnerabilities affect particular subsets of the IT 
infrastructure.
 The tracking inventory helps speed the scanning process
because it enables you to scan multiple asset groups in
parallel. You can track this data manually, but VM is
much more effective by automating the entire inventory
process for discovery and tracking. Figure 2-2 shows a
Part II: Doing Vulnerability Management 13

map of the network devices discovered during the VM
discovery process.
 An accurate inventory ensures that the correct patches
are selected and applied during remediation. 
Figure 2-2: Automated mapping and tracking of each network asset.
Prioritizing assets by business risk
An automated VM system provides the ability to assign priori-
ties of business risk to each network asset. It’s much easier to
leave the correlation of vulnerabilities, policies, and proce-
dures for remediation to computers – and far more accurate
than using a notebook. An input control screen for a VM data-
base, such as the one shown in Figure 2-3, automatically clari-
fies assignment of business risk to specific network assets in
relation to security risks.
The VM asset tracking system incorporates these business
risks when you manage and use the system. Figure 2-3 shows
automatic assignment of these values to classes of assets in
particular sections of an organization.
The result enables an automated system that tracks all net-
work assets by business risk and correlates them against
known vulnerabilities.

Part II: Doing Vulnerability Management 15
Figure 2-3: Assigning priorities to network assets by business risk.
Step 2: Scan Systems 
for Vulnerabilities
Vulnerability management has many steps, but scanning is the
foundational process for finding and fixing network vulnerabil-
ities. Your choice of scanning technology is the most impor-
tant element of an effective system for VM.
A vulnerability scan tests the effectiveness of security policy
and controls by examining the network infrastructure for vul-
nerabilities. A scan provides two benefits:
1. The scan systematically tests and analyses IP devices,
services, and applications for known security holes.
2. A post-scan report reveals actual vulnerabilities and
states what you need to fix in order of priority.
Launching a scan
A vulnerability scan is initiated by a VM application. You can
usually schedule a scan to run automatically or run one on

‘QualysGuard has made the job of audit-
ing our network much easier. We used
to have to dig through results and do a
lot of manual analysis to get meaningful
reports, and those were inconsistent.
Qualys takes care of that nightmare.’ –
Senior Manager, Information Security
Objectives:
 Reliably identify network vulnerabil-
ities across the global network.
 Audit the network security of busi-
ness partners and help those part-
ners quickly remediate vulnera-
bilities and eliminate risks.
 Rollout an automated solution that
finds the most recent vulnerabilities
without requiring constant and time-
consuming staff research.
 Provide senior management with
the ability to audit and review the
security posture (the industry term
for status) at any time.
Results:
 After a careful market evaluation,
eBay selected QualysGuard for
both network-perimeter scanning
and auditing vulnerabilities on the
network within the corporate fire-
wall, and on partner networks.
 eBay now has a default vulnerabil-
ity management standard to evalu-
ate security throughout both eBay’s
and partner networks.
 Simplified reporting gives senior
executives a concise, real-time
view into the company’s security
risks. QualysGuard enables eBay
execs to measure the changes in
those risks as they implement
security measures.

request. The scan request needs to indicate the particular
hosts you want to check for vulnerabilities, specified as any
combination of IP numbers, ranges of IPs, and asset groups.
Figure 2-4 shows a scan launching automatically.
Figure 2-4: Launching a scan automatically.
Here’s what you need to gather before the launch:
 At a minimum, you need the IPs (or IP ranges) for your
organization’s domains and sub-networks.
 If you want to scan specific devices, you need to identify
them by IP before launching the scan.
 You need to ready IPs for your organization’s business
partners whose networks integrate business functions
shared with applications on your network. Some busi-
ness regulations require scans for business partners to
ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
personally identifiable information – whether for cus-
tomers, employees, or partners. Alert these partners if
your organization needs to scan their IPs that integrate
with your network.
Part II: Doing Vulnerability Management 17

Options for scanning tools
You have many options for scanning tools. All use a vulnera-
bility database of known risks, but these databases vary in
coverage and effective quality. Some require software applica-
tions that you install and maintain, such as the Nessus public
domain scanner. These can require significant time and
resources – plus they carry typical operational overhead.
By contrast, software applications may also be hosted by a
vendor and used by businesses with a Web browser over the
Internet. This delivery model is called Software-as-a-Service
(SaaS), and businesses are beginning to use SaaS for a variety
of applications – including VM. A VM solution with SaaS pro-
vides the capability to perform the scans on demand over the
Internet. You simply log in to your account and manage every-
thing online. A SaaS service works without special software and
is always up-to-date with the most recent and comprehensive
set of vulnerability signatures. As a result, you don’t have to
worry about updates to scanning technology because they’re
automatically applied in the VM system. We talk about the ben-
efits of using SaaS for VM in more detail in Part III.

Public enemy #1: Threats from 
rogue wireless devices
Organizations of all sizes use wire-
less access points, and doing so has
un-tethered computing and provided
huge benefits of mobility. But mobil-
ity has also accelerated the de-
perimeterization of corporate net-
works. This means that rogue devices
can easily bypass traditional network
security controls like firewalls and
intrusion prevention. A common prob-
lem occurs when a department
installs an unauthorized wireless
access point for the convenience of
its staff – and inadvertently exposes
the entire organization’s network and
assets to worms, viruses, and other
risks via unprotected endpoints.
Network mapping capability included
with some vulnerability management
solutions can identify rogue devices
and scan them for vulnerabilities.
Scanning your network for rogue
systems is a key step to preventing
attacks. The figure below shows a
VM report identifying unknown
‘rogue’ devices.

What to scan?
The simple answer to what to scan is this: pretty much any-
thing that’s connected to your organization’s network. Here’s
a list of what to scan:
 Operating Systems: Microsoft Windows Vista XP, CE, NT,
2003, 2000; Linux; BSD; MacOS X; Solaris; HP-UX; Irix; AIX;
SCO; Novell.

Identifying the vulnerability
shortlist
The VM solution you select needs to provide the capability to
scan for and fix vulnerabilities in a broad range of categories,
including:
 Back Doors and Trojan Horses (bypass authentication
systems).
 Brute force attacks (defies cryptography by systemati-
cally trying different keys).
 CGI (exploits the Common Gateway Interface).
 Databases.
 DNS and Bind (exploits Domain Name Services).
 E-commerce applications.
 File sharing.
 File Transfer Protocol.
 Firewalls.

 General Remote Services.
 Hardware and network appliances.
 Information/Directory Services.
 SMB/Netbios Windows (exploits application-layer proto-
cols for sharing network services).
 SMTP and e-mail applications.
 SNMP (exploits Simple Network Management Protocol).
 TCP/IP (exploits Transmission Control Protocol and
Internet Protocol).
 VoIP (exploits Voice-over-IP protocol).
 Web servers.
 Wireless access points.
 X-Windows (exploits display protocol).
Step 3: Verify Vulnerabilities
Against Inventory
You can use the results of a vulnerability scan to verify that
vulnerabilities match the actual devices, software, and configu-
rations in your network. The value of this step is to minimize
efforts spent investigating risks that don’t apply to your net-
work configuration. Obviously, this is another task that’s best
done automatically. Intelligent scanning applications, such as
QualysGuard, are designed to accurately identify risks pertinent
to the devices and applications on your network – eliminating
common errors known as ‘false positives’ and ‘false negatives’
that can lead to inefficiencies in the VM process.
What to look for in scan results
Scan results need to be:
 Comprehensive.
 Specific, especially with vulnerability data and remedia-
tion instructions.
Part II: Doing Vulnerability Management 21

 Free of excessive false positive or false negative scan
results.
 Easy to understand.
False positives inhibit some vulnerability scanning by drowning
the scan results with vulnerabilities that don’t match what’s in
your inventory. Chasing down false positives is a waste of IT
staff time and an inefficient way to do VM. Likewise, a false 
negative may occur when the VM solution fails to detect a vul-
nerability that actually exists in your network. Not knowing
about the vulnerability places your network at serious risk of
exploitation by hackers.
Improving the odds for 
good scan results
Substantial industry- and government-driven efforts are aimed
at collating data about network vulnerabilities. The VM solu-
tion you choose should incorporate as many of the findings as
possible to tap the collective wisdom of vulnerability
researchers. Take a look at:
 The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures website at
www.cve.mitre.org.
 The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s
National Vulnerability Database at http://nvd.nist.
gov. The NIST database takes CVE to the next level with
detailed information for each of its vulnerabilities.
 SANS (SysAdmin, Audit, Network, Security) Top 20 at
www.sans.org/top20.
 The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team
(CERT) Vulnerability Notes Database at www.kb.cert.
org/vuls/.
 A particular vulnerability management vendor’s own
knowledgebase gleaned from its ongoing research and
development efforts.
The VM solution you choose needs to include functionality to
search for vulnerabilities on a specific class of equipment,
running a specific operating system and specific applications.
Figure 2-5 shows such a search for IPs called ‘New York Asset
Vulnerability Management For Dummies

Group,’ and within that group, all Linux hosts running the
HTTP service.
Figure 2-5: Scan report of vulnerabilities identified on the network.
The result of good scanning is accurate, up-to-date, and con-
cise vulnerability information that you can trust and apply to
assets on your organization’s network.
Employing technologies 
to improve scanning
Look for scanners that use a variety of active operating
system (OS) discovery techniques such as banner grabbing
and binary grabbing, OS-specific protocols, and TCP (trans-
mission control protocol)/IP stack fingerprinting (determining
the operating system used by a remote target), and passive
techniques such as packet spoofing (concealing or forging
identity with a fake source IP address). Fingerprinting entails
careful inspection for subtle variations in implementation of
RFC (request for comments) standards. A service discovery
engine detects backdoors, Trojans, and worms by checking
Part II: Doing Vulnerability Management 23

TCP and UDP (user datagram protocol) services, including
those on non-default ports and with fake banners. A similar
discovery process is used to fingerprint HTTP applications by
leveraging software’s version ID, service pack ID, and installed
patches. A good scanner correlates OS and HTTP fingerprint
tests to quickly find true vulnerabilities and minimize false
positives.
Step 4: Classify and Rank Risks
Fixing everything at once is practically impossible. In fact, in
large organizations, the amount of vulnerability data can be
overwhelming if it’s not properly categorized, segmented, and
prioritized in a meaningful fashion. VM workflow allows you to
automatically rank vulnerabilities to define the most critical
issues that could impact the most critical systems – all the
way down to the least critical issues that could impact
devices of less importance. In a nutshell, you need to decide
what to fix first. 
Devising a categorization scheme
You can devise your own category scheme or adopt rating
scales from other sources. Microsoft, for example, publishes
four categories of risk (see www.microsoft.com/technet/
community/columns/secmgmt/sm0404.mspx?pf=true): 
 Critical: Exploitation could allow the propagation of an
Internet worm without user action.
 Important: Exploitation could result in compromise of
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data or in
the integrity or availability of processing resources.
 Moderate: Exploitation is serious, but mitigated by fac-
tors such as default configuration, auditing, need for user
action, or difficulty of exploitation.
 Low: Exploitation is extremely difficult or impact is 
minimal.
Vulnerability Management For Dummies 
24

Elements for scan reports
A solution for VM should automatically assign a category and
a severity level for each vulnerability detected, such as in the
sample scan report in Figure 2-6. The system should indicate
vulnerabilities, potential vulnerabilities, and information data
such as services running on a particular device. A severity
level indicates the security risk posed by exploitation of the
vulnerability and its degree of difficulty. Results of a success-
ful exploitation of vulnerability can vary from disclosure of
information about the host to a complete compromise of the
host.
Part II: Doing Vulnerability Management 25
Thinking like a hacker
The VM solution you select needs to
allow your security team to think like
a hacker because it uses the scan-
ning technology to identify and fix
vulnerabilities inside and outside the
firewall. 
To duplicate a hacker’s workflow,
each scan should work from the out-
side looking in. The implication for a
scanner is that it’s deployed outside
the firewall and audits all of an orga-
nization’s hosts facing the Internet.
Naturally, the scanner’s platform also
needs protection from attacks via the
Internet, so be sure to account for this
safety factor as you choose a solution. 
The VM solution needs to operate by
the same steps used as a hacker,
including:
1. Information Gathering: Finding
out as much about a host as pos-
sible without visiting or connect-
ing to it, with techniques such as
whois, DNS, and IP assignments.
2. Discovery: Identifying hosts in the
target subnet, including topology,
firewalls, and other devices.
3. Scanning: Finding out the poten-
tial targets and vulnerabilities
associated with hardware, soft-
ware, and their open ports via net-
work scanning and port scanning.
4. Verification: Confirming the vul-
nerabilities to achieve the goal of
a successful exploit.

Figure 2-6: Scan report of vulnerabilities identified on the network.
Step 5: Pre-test Patches, Fixes,
and Workarounds
After software vendors rewrite pieces of an application, the
resulting ‘healed’ software compilation (or patch) can still 
be vulnerable to other bugs. Software vendors are often 
pressured to release a patch quickly, and this patch could
potentially cause a conflict with other applications on your
network. As a result, you need to pre-test patches before
applying them to live systems. Some faulty patches have 
inadvertently crashed business processes.
Guidelines for pre-testing
Follow these tips for pre-testing:
 Ensure the testing takes place in your organization’s
unique environment. Most problems with patches are
due to third-party applications or modifications to
default configuration settings.
Vulnerability Management For Dummies 
26

 Organizations need to verify cryptographic checksums (a
redundancy check to preserve integrity of data), Pretty
Good Privacy signatures, and digital certificates to con-
firm the authenticity of any patches being deployed. You
can further verify this by getting patches directly from
the vendor.

‘We don’t want the hassles of main-
taining this type of software. It’s pretty
much hands-off to get the benefits with
QualysGuard. We have not had any
successful attacks since we installed
QualysGuard.’ – Network Administrator
and Security Specialist
Objectives:
 As Jelly Belly brought many of its
web operations in-house, the com-
pany sought a way to enhance 
network security to protect its e-
commerce business. This required
its small IT staff to be able to con-
duct timely and comprehensive
security analysis, scanning, and
remediation.
Results:
 QualysGuard provides vulnerability
and risk management monitoring
for all of Jelly Belly’s external-facing
servers and IT devices, including
routers, firewall, website, and
e-mail.
 Jelly Belly doesn’t need to dedicate
staff to keep up with new vulnera-
bilities or update the on-demand
QualysGuard solution.
See www.qualys.com/customers/
success/ for more info and other
case studies.

 Check that the patch corrects the vulnerability without
affecting applications and operations of the business
process.
Using a VM solution that includes
patching instructions
Choose a comprehensive VM solution that includes informa-
tion for patching vulnerabilities with links to recommended
solutions, such as patches and workarounds from the vendors.
Preferably, these solutions should be tested and validated by
the VM solution provider to save you time and help you fur-
ther streamline the remediation process in your organization.

28

Step 6: Apply Patches, Fixes,
and Workarounds
Finding and fixing security problems is the core of vulnerability
management. Traditional manual processes for finding flaws,
and suggesting patches and other remediation actions are far
too slow, error-prone, and expensive. Sometimes the high cost
of patching coupled with the high volume of flaws detected in
vendor applications encourages organizations to delay remedi-
ation. Organizations may delay updates – even for critical
patches – until multiple patches, service packs, or a regular
monthly, quarterly, or annual update process is available.
Unfortunately, delay can be a fatal strategy because attackers
quickly detect potential threats. The window between flaw and
exploit is constantly shrinking. 
Guidelines for patching
Follow these tips for patching:
 Remediate vulnerabilities as quickly as possible and min-
imize risk – giving first priority to the most critical issues
facing your most critical systems.
 Automated patch management and software distribution
solutions can help speed this process and keep costs to a
minimum. Rollback capability can restore software to a
previous state and ensures organizations use appropriate
software versions efficiently.
 Integrating patch management with other automated VM
processes is beneficial. For example, QualysGuard pro-
vides one-click links to vulnerability patches, fixes, and
workarounds to use during this phase of workflow.
Built-in trouble ticketing
As you examine initial vulnerability reports, it’s useful for the
VM system to let you instantly assign a trouble ticket – a kind
of tracking system for problems – to a particular vulnerability
to help speed remediation workflow.
Part II: Doing Vulnerability Management 29

Trouble ticketing enables organizations – especially larger
organizations – to automatically distribute and assign vulnera-
bility remediation actions to certain individuals or groups. For
example, you can have all critically-rated web server risks
directed to the web IT security manager, and all lower level
risks assigned to other personnel.
An example of trouble ticketing assignment is shown in 
Figure 2-8. 
Ensure your VM solution enables the IT security team to ana-
lyze remediation trends, including long-term trends in ‘open’
and ‘closed’ ticket status (unsolved and solved problems).
This facilitates progress tracking and easy analysis of other
security metrics you may have in place.
Figure 2-9 shows an example of ticket status tracking and
reporting.

Figure 2-9: Long-term trends in trouble ticket workflow.
Step 7: Rescan to 
Verify Patching
After applying a patch or completing the remediation process,
be sure to rescan IP-connected assets – especially critical
assets –  as shown in Figure 2-10. This step verifies that the fix
worked and that it doesn’t cause other network devices, serv-
ices, or applications to malfunction or be exposed to other
vulnerabilities. 
Business risk and security risk are two indicators you can use
to prioritize remediation efforts. For example, extremely valu-
able assets may have a much higher priority rating for remedi-
ation efforts even though the vulnerabilities detected on these
systems have a lower security risk. A lower-priority asset
(such as the server hosting the lunch menu for the company)
may have a more critical vulnerability, but the business risk
(and priority to fix the vulnerability) wouldn’t outweigh the
more important business-critical system.
Vulnerability Management For Dummies 
32

Figure 2-10: VM report on vulnerabilities for critical assets.
Reporting compliance with 
laws and regulations
Verifying fixes with resulting scan reports may provide ade-
quate documentation for auditors checking for compliance
with security provisions of laws and regulations such as PCI
DSS (the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard),
HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act), Basel II, Gramm-Leach-Bliley, and Sarbanes-Oxley. Some
VM solutions provide custom templates for specific regulations.
Figure 2-11 shows an example of compliance documentation.
Reporting compliance 
with internal policies
Your VM solution needs to provide the capability to create
custom reports that confirm compliance with internal operat-
ing policies. QualysGuard automates the creation of reports
for many laws and regulations, and provides simple cus-
tomization features for documenting compliance with any
business policy, as shown in Figure 2-12.

Time to Choose a Solution for VM
In this part you reviewed the steps to VM. Now it’s time to
choose a solution that can:
 Map your network and its devices.
 Accurately and efficiently scan for the largest potential
number of vulnerabilities.
 Clearly and comprehensively report scanning results.
 Shepherd the remediation process.
 Test and confirm that vulnerabilities are fixed.
 Automatically produce accurate, comprehensive, and
detailed reports to verify compliance with internal poli-
cies and legally mandated regulations for security.

Using VM reports to ease compliance
You’ve heard all the acronyms: PCI
DSS, HIPAA, GLBA, SB 1386, SOX,
FISMA, Basel II, CobIT, and many
more. These are laws, regulations,
and frameworks that tell a broad
range of organizations and disci-
plines that they must secure person-
ally identifiable information stored in
or transferred out of their IT systems.
Diverse requirements have one thing
in common for IT people: work!
Business processes that use data
with personally identifiable informa-
tion are, by nature, IT-intensive. So be
prepared for the auditors who’ll want
documentation describing security
policies and controls. The auditors
will also want to examine documen-
tation that verifies compliance with
specific requirements of all relevant
laws and regulations. Preparing
reports customized to those require-
ments is where you could spend a
substantial amount of time. But guess
what? This is where your VM solution
can pay off in a big way.
Data used in standard VM reports,
such as listing vulnerabilities, sever-
ity levels, assets affected, remedia-
tion status and history can also be
used to satisfy many reporting
requirements for security provisions
of laws and regulations. Existing
reports may suffice. But check with
your VM solution provider about
custom report templates. Some
providers offer templates for major
laws and regulations that completely
automate the process of creating
documentation for compliance.
As a bonus, some VM solutions also
provide customization features for
reports that verify unique internal
policy requirements for an organiza-
tion. Either way, a robust reporting
capability will reward your efforts at
VM with accessible evidence of
security and protection. The cus-
tomization, scope, and precision of
VM reports also helps to make your
IT security department look good to
executives running the company.

ulnerability management (VM) is critical for every busi-
ness to simplify security compliance requirements and to
prevent mass and targeted attacks that take advantage of net-
work weaknesses.
The steps of VM are fundamental, but so are the ways you
implement solutions to meet operational requirements. This
part provides preparatory ideas for choosing and implement-
ing VM solutions.

Vulnerability Management For Dummies 
38
Choosing the Best Path 
to Eliminate Network
Vulnerabilities
The choice of what solution you implement for VM will directly
affect your company’s actual state of security and overall com-
pliance. As you weigh options for each step of VM, consider
these tips:
 Automate as much as you can. Many of the steps to vul-
nerability management are repetitive and applied to all
networked devices in the enterprise. Manually doing
these tasks consumes an enormous amount of time and
resources. Regulatory requirements may require your
company to extend VM to suppliers, business partners,
and channel representatives. There’s no way you’ll have
enough budget and people on staff to do all these steps
manually. Automation is a must – and not only for afford-
ability and economies of scale, but also to ensure that
VM is done in a rapid, systematic, and comprehensive
manner. It’s one of those cases where machines are
better than people!
 Use solid, safe technology. With VM, we’re talking about
preserving the safety and security of your network, appli-
cations, and data. Don’t skimp on the technology
required to do the job right. And be especially careful
about implementing experimental, unproven solutions
into your VM system. When it comes to your business
network, systems, and data, safer is better than sorry.
Stick with VM technology that has a solid track record
and wide use in the user community.
 Chose a solution that grows with your business. Change
is the only certain aspect of business, so check out a pro-
posed VM solution’s ability to scale as your organiza-
tion’s requirements grow more complex and demanding.
It’s one thing to secure a few machines or a small depart-
ment; it’s another to coordinate VM with multiple depart-
ments, divisions, business units, and independent
business partners – domestic and global. 
With that, the following sections look at a few options for
implementing a VM solution.

Option: Pay a Consultant
Consultants are a great resource to assist you in protecting
your network and are experts in identifying weaknesses. 
However, there’s a big difference between VM and simply
identifying issues or proving there are weaknesses. Many con-
sultants perform what’s called penetration testing or ‘pen test-
ing’, which means they try to find vulnerabilities and crack
your network. A couple of comprehensive pen tests each year
might cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. A
penetration test captures in-depth vulnerability information at
a single point in time. The results of this test might be ade-
quate for specific compliance instances with a regulation –
but providing ongoing, reliable security is a different matter.
The shelf life of a penetration test is fleeting: 
 Results are valid only until the environment changes or
until new threats arise – which is daily!
 Results are good for a few hours at best. In typical com-
panies, administrators reconfigure networks and devices
every day. Also, new vulnerabilities are found daily and
point-in-time penetration tests are quickly outdated. If
you want vulnerability management to help strengthen
security, it’s more appropriate to do consistent, daily
scans.
 Regular assessments quickly become too expensive to
outsource for manual processing by penetration testing
consultants.
VM is relatively easy when you use an automated solution, so
you may want to aim additional resources at fixing any issues
detected. Remediation of vulnerabilities can often be time
consuming, so consultants can provide great value in assisting
you in this complex task.
Option: Run Software Yourself
Software-based solutions enable you to install software for
vulnerability management on your internal network and run
them yourself. Software can automate many processes for VM.
Part III: Considering Your Options for Vulnerability Management 39

However, having the control over VM software carries the
usual price tag of having to manage it (and secure it). You
have to successfully operate and maintain everything – in
between everything else on the usual IT and security person’s
daily list of things to do. 
Tasks for running and maintaining VM software include:
 Buying and maintaining the servers and infrastructure to
reliably run the VM software applications. 
 Ensuring the VM applications and infrastructure are
always 100 per cent secure and performing at peak 
operational efficiency.
 Integrating the required data exchange between compo-
nent software used for VM solutions.
 Keeping software maintenance up-to-date with the latest
updates and patches from each vendor.
 And, of course, responding to alerts and managing the
vulnerabilities spotted by your system.
Do-it-yourselfers have two choices. You can download Open
Source software or buy commercial solutions.
Open Source software: Free, 
but not cheap
Open Source software is usually developed in an open, collab-
orative manner. The software is typically free, and users are
able to use, change, improve, or share it. However, three 
considerations about Open Source software don’t bode well
for use with VM:
 Questionable code. Open Source code is developed by
the public, and you can’t be assured of its quality like
you can with a commercial vendor. A reputable vendor
follows industry standard processes for software code
assurance and security, and submits the code to scrutiny
by independent testers and validation regimes such as
those used for FIPS (Federal Information Processing
Standards) or Common Criteria. 
The issue of implementing untested Open Source mod-
ules of code into any software application also poses the
Vulnerability Management For Dummies 
40

risk of non-robustness after the application is deployed
into an enterprise’s production environment. And there’s
a risk of inadvertently integrating vulnerabilities into 
the VM system via the untested module. In fact, many
instances of modules (or vulnerability checks) have 
provided false positive and false negative results. Some
checks have even disabled systems. If you use Open
Source solutions for VM, proceed at your own risk!
 Open Source software may be free but it’s not inexpen-
sive. Open Source software carries the same operational
costs as commercial software. Be ready to pay for equip-
ment space, rack and air conditioning, system adminis-
tration, deployment and configuration, maintenance and
patching (if and when they arrive from community devel-
opers), backup and restore, redundancy, failover and
uninterrupted power, audit logs, provision for VM appli-
cation security and maintenance, capacity planning, and
event monitoring. The list goes on! 
 Training and support is skimpy. Your security staff must
know how to operate tools and capabilities of VM – and
how to quickly eradicate vulnerabilities found on the net-
work. With Open Source software, it’s rare to find pack-
aged training and support information together from
Open Source forums on the Internet. While many experts
collaborate on sharing their tips, it helps to know the
people who program the software because they’re 
often the only source of information – especially for 
Open Source modules or plug-ins that may not work as
described. When you rely on Open Source for VM, gurus
are essential for handling technical aspects of the job. 
Commercial software: Not cheap,
but has maintenance
The other option for running VM software yourself is to use
commercial software. Most people automatically think of com-
mercial software as a ‘safe’ option, and it usually constitutes
the bulk of installed applications. But commercial software
has drawbacks, so consider these points:
 Commercial software costs real money. You have to buy
it, and that requires budget, process, and paperwork to
convince the boss to sign the purchase order.
Part III: Considering Your Options for Vulnerability Management 41

 You must pay every year for the right to continue using
commercial software. Technically, buyers don’t actually
own anything except a license granting them ‘entitle-
ments’ to using the software.
 Maintenance brings higher assurance. Well, maybe. A
commercial venture is hopefully developing the VM soft-
ware with industry standards for software assurance and
security. Ask your vendors about how they do this. On
the other hand, mistakes are virtually assured in any soft-
ware application so you must regularly and rapidly install
updates and new patches. Find out how that process
works and how you’ll have to integrate it with your inter-
nal process for updates and patching. Check on the
provider’s training and support programs to ensure that
your security staff will be able to deploy and use the
solution.
 Commercial software costs the same to run as Open
Source solutions. Be ready to pay for the same long list
of things that you’d have to pay for with Open Source.
Option: Use Software-as-a-
Service (SaaS)
Software-as-a-Service is an application delivery model offering
organizations a low-cost, efficient way to use software applica-
tions. With SaaS, third-party developers run their applications
on a secure Internet web server, which users operate and con-
trol on demand with a web browser. Users save money by
paying a periodic subscription fee, instead of paying for soft-
ware, regular updates, and ongoing maintenance. 
A variety of applications delivered with SaaS include customer
relations management, office productivity, human resources,
videoconferencing, and accounting. A SaaS provider handles
all the technical ‘heavy lifting’ of infrastructure behind the
application – you can use it right away without requiring spe-
cial technical expertise or training to deploy and use it. No
gurus needed either!
Qualys was the first company to offer vulnerability manage-
ment via SaaS and is the global leader in providing 
on-demand security with its web-based service called
Vulnerability Management For Dummies 
42

QualysGuard. The QualysGuard vulnerability management and
policy compliance platform performs more than 150 million IP
audits per year for thousands of customers around the globe.
Comparing SaaS to Traditional
Software for VM
Organizations can deploy vulnerability management in several
ways. Some do it themselves by purchasing, deploying, and
managing software-based vulnerability management products.
Some hire consultants to do penetration testing, who often
use the same software-based products that hiring organiza-
tions could run themselves. A growing number are turning to
a proven alternative: doing vulnerability management on
demand with SaaS.
As you choose a solution for VM, it’s useful to weigh the pros
and cons of each against four key factors: Design, Deployment,
Management, and Compliance. Each of these plays a crucial
role in determining successful deployment of VM.
Design: Assessing risk from the
outside, looking in
Software-based solutions are installed by users on their enter-
prise network and operated manually. This is a familiar
process but using software-based solutions for vulnerability
management has huge drawbacks:
 Software-based solutions don’t provide an outsider’s
view of network vulnerabilities, especially for devices on
the perimeter.
 Installation options are either on the non-routable pri-
vate side of the network or on the public-facing Internet
side. Behind-the-firewall deployments are unable to
process exploits such as transmission of incorrectly 
formatted data packets so their scans generate many
false positives and false negatives. Products deployed
outside the firewall are subject to attacks and compro-
mise. Secure communications of scan assessments are
questionable.
Part III: Considering Your Options for Vulnerability Management 43

With SaaS, the application is installed and operated by a
trusted third party and may be hosted on a user’s network or
on secure external facilities. The latter option enables the
SaaS vulnerability management solution to mimic the perspec-
tive of a hacker during the network audit process – from the
outside, looking in. An externally-hosted SaaS vulnerability
management solution can also assess security inside the fire-
wall perimeter using a ‘hardened appliance’ (which contains
integrated security protection) that can communicate internal
audit results to a central secure repository hosted and man-
aged by the trusted third party.
Deployment: Keeping operational
burdens to a minimum
When users deploy software-based solutions, they need to
provide servers to run the vulnerability management applica-
tion. For large enterprises, this may require servers in multi-
ple data centers worldwide so deployment can consume a lot
of time as network and security staff roll out the required
infrastructure. Smooth integration of these resources with
enterprise management platforms is often challenging if not
impossible.
A SaaS solution has many operational advantages:
 SaaS is already ‘up and running’ so deployment is instant,
no matter how many sites need vulnerability manage-
ment, and no matter where they are in the world.
 There are no software agents to install that might conflict
with other applications.
 SaaS is inherently scalable and immediately begins work-
ing for the largest enterprise.
 The solution should provide an API allowing for simple
integration with enterprise network management 
platforms.
Figure 3-1 shows the main reasons why people adopt SaaS.
Vulnerability Management For Dummies 
44

Figure 3-1: Why people adopt SaaS.
Management: For an effective,
low-cost solution
Software-based solutions require substantial overheads for
vulnerability management. In large-scale deployments, scan
results are dispersed across multiple network segments and
devices, so collating for an enterprise-wide view of vulnerabili-
ties is a long manual process. Software updates and patches
Part III: Considering Your Options for Vulnerability Management 45

must be applied on every distributed node, which also require
hardware maintenance and backup. Moreover, nodes hosting
the software are susceptible to attack.
Vulnerability management with SaaS eliminates all these
issues:
 Secure SaaS hosting means that updates are automatic
and instant for the entire enterprise.
 Enterprise-wide collation of vulnerability data is 
automatic.
 The total cost of ownership (TCO) is lower with SaaS due
to the elimination of manual deployment, management,
and reporting.
Compliance: Audits and reports
for a variety of policies and 
regulations
Demonstrating compliance with software-based solutions is
difficult. In addition to manually collating reports, the data is
‘owned’ by the user and so is subject to extra scrutiny and
skepticism by auditors. By contrast, fully automated SaaS vul-
nerability reporting is trusted by auditors because it’s col-
lected and held by a secure third party. SaaS provides
tamper-proof capability by enforcing access to VM functional-
ity and reporting based on a user’s operational role in an
organization. This role-based capability further protects the
integrity of VM results for verification of compliance.

 Identify both perimeter and internal weaknesses.
 Automatically scan using a continually updated database
of known attacks.
 Be highly accurate, essentially eliminating false positives
and false negatives – and be non-intrusive.
 Use inference-based scanning to ensure that only applica-
ble vulnerabilities are tested for each scan.
 Generate concise, actionable, customizable reports,
including vulnerability prioritization using severity levels
and trend analysis.
 Provide tested remedies and workarounds for cases
where no remedy as yet exists.
 Provide distributed scanning capabilities with consoli-
dated reporting and centralized management capabilities.
 Offer both trusted (credential-based) and simple 
password-based authorization techniques for scanning.
 Provide user access management to restrict users’ roles
and privileges to their function in the organization and
network responsibility.
 Supply workflow capabilities for prioritizing and tracking
remediation efforts.
 Enable customers to build compliance reporting.
 Integrate seamlessly with customers’ Security
Information Management (SIM), Intrusion Detection
System (IDS), patch management, and help desk systems.
That’s a lot of requirements, but QualysGuard meets every
one of them with its SaaS architecture and easy-to-use user
interface.
Accessing QualysGuard
Users access QualysGuard by simply logging in via a web
browser. Through this authorized access to its web service-
based delivery architecture, QualysGuard users can immedi-
ately use the service and audit the security of their external

and internal network. VM services with QualysGuard are avail-
able on demand 24x7 to all subscribers worldwide.
With QualysGuard you can schedule scans to occur automati-
cally, including selected scan targets, start time, duration, and
occurrence frequency.
VM features in QualysGuard provide a broad array of capabili-
ties for finding and eliminating network vulnerabilities.
QualysGuard:
 Discovers all systems attached to your network. 
 Identifies and analyses vulnerabilities on all discovered
systems. 
 Reports findings of discovery and vulnerability analysis. 
 Shepherds the vulnerability remediation process. 
 Confirms that remedies or workarounds have been
applied. 
 Provides documentation to verify security compliance. 
Elements of QualysGuard’s architecture (seen in Figure 4-1)
include a KnowledgeBase, security operations centers,
Internet scanners, scanner appliances, and a secure web 
interface, which we explain in the following sections.
KnowledgeBase
The core of QualysGuard is its KnowledgeBase.
KnowledgeBase contains the intelligence that powers the
QualysGuard vulnerability management service. It’s updated
daily with signatures for new vulnerabilities, validated
patches, fixes for false positives, and other data that continu-
ously improves its effectiveness. 
Security Operations Centers
The KnowledgeBase resides inside Qualys’ Security Operations
Centers (SOCs), which provide secure storage and processing
of vulnerability data on an n-tiered architecture of load-
balanced application servers. That’s computer-speak for the
ability to expand processing power to meet customer demand

simply by adding more servers. All computers and racked
equipment are isolated from other systems in a locked vault.
Internet scanners
QualysGuard Internet scanners carry out perimeter scanning
for customers. These remote scanners begin by building an
inventory of protocols found on each machine undergoing an
audit. After discovering the protocols, the scanner detects
which ports are attached to services, such as web servers,
databases, and email servers. At that point, the scanners initi-
ate an inference-based vulnerability assessment, based on 
vulnerabilities that could actually be present (due to operat-
ing system and configurations) to quickly identify true vulner-
abilities and minimize false positives. 
Scanner Appliances
QualysGuard Scanner Appliances are installed by customers
to map domains and scan IPs behind the firewall. These are
plug-in devices that install within a matter of minutes, gather
security audit data inside the firewall, and provide secure
communications with Qualys SOCs. These appliances use a
hardened operating-system kernel designed to prevent any
attacks. In addition, they contain no services or daemons
(background software processes) that are exposed to the net-
work. These devices poll the SOCs for software updates and
new vulnerability signatures, and process job requests.
Secure web interface
Users interact with QualysGuard through its secure web inter-
face. Any standard web browser permits users to navigate the
QualysGuard user interface, launch scans, examine audit
report data, and manage the account. Secure communications
are assured via HTTPS (SSLv3) encryption. All vulnerability
information, as well as report data, is encrypted with unique
customer keys to guarantee that your information remains
confidential and make it unreadable by anyone other than
those with proper customer authorization.

Prioritizing Remediation 
to Guide and Speed Up 
Staff Follow-Through
QualysGuard provides a remediation ticketing capability simi-
lar to trouble tickets created by a support call center. As the
security manager, you can control the priority-driven policies
for these tickets and automatically assign responsibility for
fixing them. QualysGuard notes when tickets have been cre-
ated and tracks all remediation changes in subsequent scans.
The automation of these processes can dramatically speed
remediation of vulnerabilities.
Reports from QualysGuard automatically identify and rank
vulnerabilities with the QualysGuard Scanning Engine, which
assigns one of five severity levels to define the urgency associ-
ated with remediation of each vulnerability. Rankings are
based on a variety of industry standards such as CVE and
NIST. These levels are:
 Level 1 (minimal): Information can be collected.
 Level 2 (medium): Sensitive information can be col-
lected, such as precise version and release numbers of
software running on the target machine.
 Level 3 (serious): Indications of threats such as directory
browsing, denial of service, or partial read of limited files
have been detected.
 Level 4 (critical): Red-flag indications of file theft, poten-
tial backdoors, or readable user lists present on target
machines have been discovered.
 Level 5 (urgent): Backdoor software has been detected,
or read and write access on files, remote execution, or
other activities are present.
Details for each vulnerability are displayed in a report, as
shown in Figure 4-2.
QualysGuard also provides an Executive Report, which sum-
marizes the status of repair for all vulnerabilities.
Vulnerability Management For Dummies 
52

Automating Compliance
Documents for Auditors
One area that distinguishes QualysGuard from other VM 
solutions is its very flexible, comprehensive, and intelligent
reporting capability. Most other solutions produce rigid
reports that reflect, one-for-one, whatever data they gathered
during a scan. Few, if any, mechanisms can filter, regroup, or
synthesize the data into higher levels of information abstrac-
tion. QualysGuard reports, however, are like quality business
intelligence reporting – with filtering and sorting that enables
you to view data any way you want.
Components of QualysGuard reporting are:
 Network assets (IPs and/or asset groups) included in the
report.
 Graphs and charts showing overall summaries and net-
work security status.
Part IV: QualysGuard: Vulnerability Management On Demand 53

 Trending analysis for a given network.
 Vulnerability data with detailed specificity.
 Filtering and sorting options to provide other flexible
ways to view your network’s data.
The QualysGuard Dashboard provides an instant one-page
snapshot of your network’s overall security position, as
shown in Figure 4-3.
Figure 4-3: QualysGuard Dashboard.
The Dashboard is a portal to more detailed reports that
describe each aspect of vulnerability management processes.
QualysGuard provides a range of report templates that auto-
matically present VM data and information synthesis typically
required by an IT organization for vulnerability remediation.
You can easily customize the templates to display specialized
reports, formats (such as HTML, XML, PDF), and associated
distribution to appropriate staff members, executives, and
auditors. 
For example, customizable templates automatically generate
reports such as:
 Unremediated vulnerabilities with the highest level of
severity.
Vulnerability Management For Dummies 
54

 Rogue devices discovered on the network.
 Technical compliance with a specific regulation, such as
PCI DSS, HIPAA, Gramm-Leach-Bliley, or Sarbanes-Oxley.
 Trouble-ticket status for a particular department or busi-
ness process, such as a financial reporting system or an
order processing system.
 Trend analysis for use in job performance appraisals of
network security staff.
Keeping the Costs Down
QualysGuard is cost-effective thanks to automation, which
saves both smaller businesses and large multinational organi-
zations a huge amount of time compared to the manual execu-
tion of continuous processes for VM. QualysGuard’s secure
architecture is updated daily with new vulnerability audits,
and quarterly with new product features. All updates are done
seamlessly to subscribers. The costs of ownership are
assumed by Qualys and distributed across a large subscriber
base. This enables users to benefit from an immediately
deployable VM capability at a far lower cost than using an
internal, software-based solution.
On demand audits versus costly
penetration testing
As described in Part III, penetration testing is the term for net-
work security auditing performed by outside consultants that
consists of simulating an attack by a malicious user. Essentially,
the ‘attacker’ tries to identify vulnerabilities and exploit them.
While penetration testing captures some vulnerability infor-
mation at a single point in time, its shelf life is fleeting and
results are valid only until the environment changes or until
new threats arise. In short, penetration tests aren’t always
comprehensive and are valid for just hours. With network
administrators reconfiguring networks and devices daily, and
vulnerabilities emerging at the rate of 25+ per week, network
security requires frequent, continual assessment. 
Part IV: QualysGuard: Vulnerability Management On Demand 55

On-demand security audits are the ideal supplement to or
replacement for penetration tests. QualysGuard provides 
subscribers with unlimited assessments – daily if required – 
at a fraction of the cost of one penetration test. Differential
reporting and trend analysis is automatically included so you
can measure your security improvements over time.
Counting the QualysGuard 
subscriber benefits
QualysGuard is designed to operate effectively on diverse net-
works of any size. It’s the first scalable, cost-effective web
service providing proactive on-demand security audits inside
and outside the firewall. 
QualysGuard enables total control over the security audit and
vulnerability management process, including: 
 Easy deployment with the QualysGuard SaaS architecture.
 The ability to easily manage vulnerability management
no matter how large your network is.
 A fully-automated solution that eliminates traditional
labor-intensive operations, saving time and simplifying
large-scale vulnerability management.
 The rapid identification and visualization of network
assets.
 Accurate vulnerability detection that eliminates the time-
consuming manual work of verifying results and consoli-
dating data.
 Accessible VM service to authorized users from any-
where on the globe.

Ten Best Practices for
Doing Vulnerability
Management 
In This Part
 Checking everything to ensure you’re protected
 Producing technical, management, and compliance reports 
 Patching and tracking
You can use this chapter as a ten-point checklist for doing
vulnerability management. These best practices reflect
the variety of security measures required to effectively iden-
tify and eliminate weaknesses on your network. The checklist
is an aggressive plan for removing vulnerabilities in key
resources before attackers can exploit your network. 
Discover Network Assets
You can’t measure risk if you don’t know what you have on
your network. Discovering your assets helps you determine
the areas that are most susceptible to attacks. Network map-
ping automatically detects all networked devices. VM gives
you the capability to do a full network discovery of your net-
work assets on a global scale.

Vulnerability Management For Dummies 
60
Classify Assets 
Most organizations have 5 to 20 categories of network assets
whose classification is determined by value to the overall
business. Tier the hierarchy of assets by value to the busi-
ness. For example, you can rank critical databases, financial
systems, and other important business assets in a higher cate-
gory than clerical desktops, non-production servers, and
remote laptops. Classify asset priority based on the value to
the business and don’t give critical assets a lower categoriza-
tion due to presumptions about their safety. 
Check Inside and Outside 
the DMZ
You want to be comprehensive about your network auditing.
So perform VM on your ‘demilitarized zone’ (DMZ, or the
external network boundary) and internal systems. That’s the
only way to achieve optimal security protection. Hackers’
exploits are crafty and can otherwise breach your network, so
make sure you’re guarding and checking everything.
Run Comprehensive Scans
Run comprehensive and accurate scans on your assets start-
ing with the most important ones. Doing so gives you full 
visibility on the level of risk associated with your assets.
Intelligent scanning rapidly finds vulnerabilities on your 
network – automatically or on demand. You can scan lower
categories of assets less frequently.
Generate Reports for the
Technical Staff
Vulnerability reports need to be comprehensive, with full
instructions on how to remediate vulnerabilities. Customizable
reports are really useful, enabling technical staff to view data
in the desired context while reducing information overload.

Generate Management Reports 
Use gathered metrics from scans to communicate the status
of network security to senior management so that they can
understand the trend of vulnerabilities and the efforts of the
security team to minimize risks to the enterprise. Use actual
performance measurements to educate your executive man-
agement team and show the value of VM in maintaining busi-
ness continuity, reducing risks, and maintaining a secure
infrastructure.
Prioritize Patching Efforts
Prioritize patch application starting with the most critical vul-
nerabilities on the most important assets, and proceed to the
less critical ones. Get in the habit of setting (and exceeding!)
performance goals to reduce the level of critical vulnerabili-
ties in the network.
Track Remediation Progress
Automatically generated trouble tickets enable you to track
each step of remediation and to measure progress over time.
If you have a larger organization, using a ticketing system
speeds remediation. It also saves you time, enables you to
compare the performance of distributed teams, and provides
recognition to leaders and followers. Peer pressure encour-
ages security teams to share experiences of actions leading to
a more rapid reduction in vulnerabilities.
Generate Policy Compliance
Reports
VM delivers trusted third-party auditing and reporting which
meets the compliance needs of HIPAA, GLBA, SB 1386,
Sarbanes-Oxley, Basel II, and PCI DSS. You can use reports
from VM solutions to document the state of security over time
on systems in scope for compliance. 
Part V: Ten Best Practices for Doing Vulnerability Management 61

Repeat the VM Process 
on a Regular Basis
Vulnerability management isn’t a one-time effort. Best prac-
tices of VM suggest regular, on-going scanning and remedia-
tion to proactively guard against internal and external threats
and ensure compliance. Scan critical systems at least weekly
and less critical assets bi-weekly. Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday
(the second Tuesday of each month) is a good reminder to
run system-wide VM audits to detect the latest vulnerabilities.
