The study of Smarandache Algebraic Structure was initiated in the year 1998 by Raul 
Padilla following a paper written by Florentin Smarandache called ‚ÄúSpecial Algebraic 
Structures‚Äù. In his research, Padilla treated the Smarandache algebraic structures mainly with 
associative binary operation. Since then the subject has been pursued by a growing number of 
researchers and now it would be better if one gets a coherent account of the basic and main 
results in these algebraic structures. This book aims to give a systematic development of the 
basic non-associative algebraic structures viz. Smarandache groupoids. Smarandache 
groupoids exhibits simultaneously the properties of a semigroup and a groupoid. Such a 
combined study of an associative and a non associative structure has not been so far carried 
out. Except for the introduction of smarandacheian notions by Prof. Florentin Smarandache 
such types of studies would have been completely absent in the mathematical world. 
 
Thus, Smarandache groupoids, which are groupoids with a proper subset, which is a 
semigroup, has several interesting properties, which are defined and studied in this book in a 
sequential way. This book assumes that the reader should have a good background of 
algebraic structures like semigroup, group etc. and a good foundation in number theory. 
 
In Chapter 1 we just recall the basic notations and some important definitions used in 
this book. In Chapter 2 almost all concepts, most of them new have been introduced to 
groupoids in general. Since the study of groupoids and books on groupoids is meager, we in 
Chapter 3 introduce four new classes of groupoids using the set of modulo integers Zn, n ‚â• 3 
and n < ‚àù. This chapter is mainly introduced to lessen the non abstractness of this structure. 
In this chapter, several number theoretic techniques are used.  
 
Chapter 4 starts with the definition of Smarandache groupoids. All properties 
introduced in groupoids are studied in the case of Smarandache groupoids. Several problems 
and examples are given in each section to make the concept easy. In Chapter 5 conditions for 
the new classes of groupoids built using Zn to contain Smarandache groupoids are obtained. 
Chapter 6 gives the application of Smarandache groupoids to semi automaton and automaton, 
that is to finite machines. The final chapter on research problems is the major attraction of the 

 
 
6 
book as we give several open problems about groupoids. Any researcher on algebra will find 
them interesting and absorbing.  
 
We have attempted to make this book a self contained one provided a reader has a 
sufficient background knowledge in algebra. Thus, this book will be the first one in 
Smarandache algebraic structures to deal with non associative operations. 
 
I deeply acknowledge Dr. Minh Perez, because of whose support and constant 
encouragement this book was possible.

CHAPTER ONE 
		
 
In this chapter, we give some basic notion and preliminary concepts used in this book 
so as to make this book self contained. The study of groupoids is very rare and meager; the 
only reason the author is able to attribute to this is that it may be due to the fact that there is 
no natural way by which groupoids can be constructed. This book aim is two fold, firstly to 
construct new classes of groupoids using finite integers and define in these new classes many 
properties which have not been studied yet. Secondly, to define Smarandache groupoids and 
introduce the newly defined properties in groupoids to Smarandache groupoids. In this 
chapter, we recall some basic properties of integers, groupoids, Smarandache groupoids and 
loops. 
 
 
1.1 Integers  
 
We start this chapter with a brief discussion on the set of both finite and infinite 
integers. We mainly enumerate the properties, which will be used in this book. As concerned 
with notations, the familiar symbols a > b, a ‚â• b, |a|, a / b, b /  a occur with their usual 
meaning. 
 
DEFINITION: The positive integer c is said to be the greatest divisor of a and b if 
  
1. c is a divisor of a and of b 
2. Any divisor of a and b is a divisor of c. 
 
DEFINITION: The integers a and b are relatively prime if (a, b)= 1 and there exists integers 
m and n such that ma + nb = 1.  
 
DEFINITION: The integer p > 1 is a prime if its only divisor are ¬± 1 and ¬± p. 
 
DEFINITION: The least common multiple of two positive integers a and b is defined to be the 
smallest positive integer that is divisible by a and b and it is denoted by l.c.m (a, b) or [a, b].

Notation:  
 
1. Z+ is the set of positive integers. 
 
2. Z+ ‚à™ {0} is the set of positive integers with zero. 
 
3. Z = Z+ ‚à™ Z‚àí ‚à™ {0} is the set of integers where Z‚àí is the set of negative integers. 
 
4. Q+ is the set of positive rationals. 
 
5. Q+ ‚à™ {0} is the set of positive rationals with zero. 
 
6. Q = Q+ ‚à™ Q‚àí ‚à™ {0}, is the set of rationals where Q‚Äì is the set of negative 
rationals. 
 
Similarly R+ is the set of positive reals, R+ ‚à™ (0) is the set of positive reals with zero 
and the set of reals R = R+ ‚à™ R‚àí ‚à™ {0} where R‚Äì is the set of negative reals. 
 
Clearly, Z+ ‚äÇ Q+ ‚äÇ R+ and Z ‚äÇ Q ‚äÇ R, where ' ‚äÇ ' denotes the containment that is ' 
contained ' relation.  
Zn = {0, 1, 2, ... , n-1} be the set of integers under multiplication or under addition 
modulo n. For examples Z2 = {0, 1}. 1 + 1 ‚â° 0 (mod 2), 1.1 ‚â° 1 (mod 2). Z9 = {0, 1, 2, ... , 8}, 
3 + 6 ‚â° 0 (mod 9), 3.3 ‚â° 0 (mod 9), 2.8 ‚â° 7 (mod 9), 6.2 ‚â° 3 (mod 9). 
 
This notation will be used and Zn will denote the set of finite integers modulo n. 
 
 
1.2 Groupoids 
 
In this section we recall the definition of groupoids and give some examples. 
Problems are given at the end of this section to make the reader familiar with the concept of 
groupoids. 
 
DEFINITION: Given an arbitrary set P a mapping of P √ó P into P is called a binary 
operation on P. Given such a mapping œÉ: P √ó P ‚Üí P we use it to define a product ‚àó in P by 
declaring a ‚àó b = c if œÉ (a, b) = c. 
 
DEFINITION: A non empty set of elements G is said to form a groupoid if in G is defined a 
binary operation called the product denoted by ‚àó such that a ‚àó b ‚àà G for all a, b ‚àà G. 
 
It is important to mention here that the binary operation ‚àó defined on the set G need 
not be associative that is (a ‚àó b) ‚àó c ‚â† a ‚àó (b ‚àó c) in general for all a, b, c ‚àà G, so we can say 
the groupoid (G, ‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó) is a set on which is defined a non associative binary operation which is 
closed on G. 
 

 
 
9 
DEFINITION: A groupoid G is said to be a commutative groupoid if for every a, b ‚àà G we 
have a ‚àó b = b ‚àó a. 
DEFINITION: A groupoid G is said to have an identity element e in G if a ‚àó e = e ‚àó a = a for 
all a ‚àà G. 
 
We call the order of the groupoid G to be the number of distinct elements in it 
denoted by o(G) or |G|. If the number of elements in G is finite we say the groupoid G is of 
finite order or a finite groupoid otherwise we say G is an infinite groupoid. 
 
Example 1.2.1: Let G = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a0}. Define ‚àó on G given by the following table: 
 
‚àó 
a0 
a1 
a2 
a3 
a4 
a0 
a0 
a4 
a3 
a2

a3 
a3 
a2 
a1 
a0 
a4 
a4 
a4 
a3 
a2 
a1 
a0 
 
Clearly (G, ‚àó) is a non commutative groupoid and does not contain an identity. The 
order of this groupoid is 5. 
 
Example 1.2.2: Let (S, ‚àó) be a groupoid with 3 elements given by the following table: 
 
‚àó 
x1 x2 x3 
x1 x1 x3 x2 
x2 x2 x1 x3 
x3 x3 x2 x1 
   
 
This is a groupoid of order 3, which is non associative and non commutative. 
 
Example 1.2.3: Consider the groupoid (P, x) where P = {p0, p1, p2, p3} given by the 
following table:  
 
√ó 
p0 p1 p2 p3 
p0 p0 p2 p0 p2 
p1 p3 p1 p3 p1 
p2 p2 p0 p2 p0 
p3 p1 p3 p1 p3 
 
This is a groupoid of order 4. 
 
Example 1.2.4: Let Z be the set of integers define an operation '‚àí' on Z that is usual 
subtraction; (Z, ‚àí) is a groupoid. This groupoid is of infinite order and is both non 
commutative and non associative. 
 
DEFINITION: Let (G, ‚àó) be a groupoid a proper subset H ‚äÇ G is a subgroupoid if (H, ‚àó) is 
itself a groupoid. 

 
 
10 
 
Example 1.2.5: Let R be the reals (R, ‚àí) is a groupoid where ' ‚àí ' is the usual subtraction on 
R. 
 
Now Z ‚äÇ R is a subgroupoid, as (Z, ‚àí) is a groupoid. 
 
Example 1.2.6: Let G be a groupoid given by the following table: 
 
 
‚àó 
a1 
a2 
a3 
a4 
a1 
a1

a2 
a3 
a3 
a1 
a3 
a1 
a4 
a2 
a4 
a2 
a4 
 
 
This has H = {a1, a3} and K = {a2, a4} to be subgroupoids of G. 
 
Example 1.2.7: G is a groupoid given by the following table:

Clearly, H1 = {a0, a3, a6, a9}, H2 = {a2, a5, a8, a11} and H3 = {a1, a4, a7, a10} are the 
three subgroupoids of G.

Is G a commutative groupoid? Can G have subgroupoids of order 2? 
 
 
1.3 Definition of Semigroup with Examples 
 
In this section, we just recall the definition of a semigroup since groupoids are the 
generalization of semigroups and as they are the basic tools to define a Smarandache 
groupoid. Hence we define semigroups and give some examples of them. 
 
DEFINITION: Let S be a non empty set S is said to be a semigroup if on S is defined a binary 
operation ' ‚Ä¢ ' such that 
 
1. For all a, b ‚àà S we have a ‚Ä¢ b ‚àà S (closure). 
2. For all a, b, c ‚àà S we have a ‚Ä¢ (b ‚Ä¢ c) = (a ‚Ä¢ b) ‚Ä¢ c (associative law). 
(S, ‚Ä¢) is a semigroup. 
 
DEFINITION: If in a semigroup (S, ‚Ä¢) we have a ‚Ä¢ b = b ‚Ä¢ a for all a, b ‚àà S we say S is a 
commutative semigroup. 
 
DEFINITION: Let S be a semigroup, if the number of elements in a semigroup is finite we say 
the semigroup S is of finite order otherwise S is of infinite order. 
 
DEFINITION: Let (S, ‚Ä¢) be a semigroup, H be a proper subset of S. We say H is a 
subsemigroup if (H, ‚Ä¢) is itself a semigroup. 
 
DEFINITION: Let (S, ‚Ä¢) be a semigroup if S contains an element e such that e ‚Ä¢ s = s ‚Ä¢ e = s 
for all s ‚àà S we say S is a semigroup with identity e or S is a monoid. 
   
Example 1.3.1: Let Z8 = {0, 1, 2, ... , 7} be the set of integers modulo 8. Z8 is a semigroup 
under multiplication mod 8, which is commutative and has 1 to be the identity. 
 

 
 
12 
Example 1.3.2: Let S2√ó2 = {(aij) | aij ‚àà Z}, the set of all 2 √ó 2 matrices with entries from Z. 
S2√ó2 is an infinite semigroup under the matrix multiplication which is non commutative and 
has 
Ô£∑Ô£∑
Ô£∏
Ô£∂
Ô£¨Ô£¨
Ô£≠
Ô£´
1
0
0
1
 to be its identity, that is S2√ó2 is a monoid. 
 
Example 1.3.3: Let Z+ = {1, 2, ... , ‚àù}. Z+ is a semigroup under addition. Clearly, Z+ is only a 
semigroup and not a monoid. 
 
Example 1.3.4: Let R2√ó2 = {(aij) | aij ‚àà Z2 = {0, 1}}, be the set of all 2 √ó 2 matrices with 
entries from the prime field Z2 = {0, 1}. R2√ó2 is a semigroup under matrix multiplication. 
Clearly, R2√ó2 is a non commutative monoid and is of finite order. 
 
Thus we have seen semigroups or monoids of finite order and infinite order both 
commutative and non commutative types. Now we define an ideal in a semigroup.  
 
DEFINITION: Let (S, ‚Ä¢) be a semigroup, a non empty subset I of S is said to be a right ideal of 
S if I is a subsemigroup of S and for s ‚àà S and a ‚àà I we have as ‚àà I. 
Similarly, one can define left ideal in a semigroup. We say I is an ideal in a 
semigroup if I is simultaneously left and right ideal of S. 
 
Note: If S is a commutative semigroup  we see the concept of right ideal and left ideal 
coincide. 
 
Example 1.3.5: Let Z9 = {0, 1, 2, ... , 8} be a semigroup under multiplication modulo 9. 
Clearly G = {0, 3} is a subsemigroup of S. 
 
Example 1.3.6: Let S3√ó3 = {(aij) | aij ‚àà Z3 = {0, 1, 2}} be the set of all 3 √ó 3 matrices; under 
the operation matrix multiplication, S3√ó3 is a semigroup. Let A3√ó3 = {set of all upper triangular 
matrices with entries from Z3 = {0, 1, 2}}. Clearly, A3√ó3 is a subsemigroup of S3√ó3. 
 
Example 1.3.7: Let Z12 = {0, 1, 2, ... , 11} be the semigroup under multiplication modulo 12. 
Clearly, A = {0, 6} is an ideal of Z12, also B = {0, 2, 4, 8, 10} is an ideal of Z12. 
 
Example 1.3.8: Let Z+ ‚à™ {0} be the semigroup under multiplication. Clearly, p (Z+ ‚à™ {0}) = 
{0, p, 2p, ...} is an ideal of Z+ ‚à™ {0} for every integer   p ‚àà Z+.  
 
DEFINITION: Let (S, ‚Ä¢) and (S', ‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó) be any two semigroups . We say a map œÜ: (S, ‚Ä¢) ‚Üí (S', ‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó) 
is a semigroup homomorphism if œÜ (s1 ‚Ä¢ s2) = œÜ(s1) ‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó œÜ (s2) for all s1, s2 ‚àà S. 
If œÜ is one to one and onto we say œÜ is an isomorphism on the semigroups. 
 
DEFINITION: Let S be a semigroup with identity e. We say s ‚àà S is invertible or has an 
inverse in S if there exist a s' ‚àà S such that ss' = s's = e. 
 
Remark: If in a semigroup S with identity every element is invertible S becomes a group. 
 
Example 1.3.9: The inverse of 5 in Z6 = {0, 1, 2, ... , 5} under multiplication is itself for 5.5 ‚â° 
1 (mod 6) so 5 is invertible where as 2, 3, 4 and 0 are non invertible in Z6.

1.4. Smarandache Groupoids  
 
In this section we just recall the definition of Smarandache Groupoid (SG) studied in 
the year 2002, and explain this definition by examples so as to make the concept easy to 
grasp as the main aim of this book is the study of Smarandache groupoid using Zn and 
introduce some new notion in them. In Chapter 4 a complete work of SG and their properties 
are given and it is very recent (2002). 
 
DEFINITION: A Smarandache groupoid G is a groupoid which has a proper subset S ‚äÇ G 
which is a semigroup under the operations of G. 
 
Example 1.4.1: Let (G, ‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó) be a groupoid on the modulo integers 6.  G = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} 
given by the following table: 
 
‚àó 
0 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
0

Clearly, the following tables give proper subsets of G which are semigroups under ‚àó.

So (G, ‚àó) is a SG. 
 
DEFINITION: Let (G, ‚àó) be a SG. The number of elements in G is called the order of the SG. 
If the number of elements is finite, we say the SG is of finite order or finite otherwise it is 
infinite order or infinite. 
 
Example 1.4.2: Let Z6 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} be a groupoid given by the following table:  
 
√ó 
0 
1 
2 
3

Clearly, this is a SG as every singleton is a semigroup. 
 
Example 1.4.3: Let G be a SG given by the following table: 
 
‚àó 
a1 
a2 
a3

A= {a4} is a semigroup as a4 ‚àó a4 = a4. Hence, G is a SG. 
 
 
PROBLEM 1: Give an example of a SG of order 8 and find all subsets which are semigroups.  
 
PROBLEM 2: Does their exist a SG of order 3? 
 
PROBLEM 3: How many SGs of order 3 exists? 
 
PROBLEM 4: How many SGs of order 4 exists? 
 
PROBLEM 5: Give an example of a SG of infinite order. 
 
PROBLEM 6: Find an example of a SG of order 7.  
  
PROBLEM 7: Can a SG of order 8 have subsets, which are semigroups of order 5?

1.5 Loops and its Properties  
 
In this section we just recall the definition of loops and illustrate them with examples. 
A lot of study has been carried out on loops and special types of loops have been defined. 
Here we give the definition of a loop and illustrate them with examples, as groupoids are the 
generalization of loops and all loops are obviously groupoids and not conversely.  
 
DEFINITION: (L, ‚Ä¢) is said to be a loop where L is a non empty set and '‚Ä¢' a binary operation, 
called the product defined on L satisfying the following conditions: 
 
1. For a, b ‚àà L we have a ‚Ä¢ b ‚àà L (closure property). 
2. There exist an element e ‚àà L such that a ‚Ä¢ e = e ‚Ä¢ a = a for all a ‚àà L (e is called 
the identity element of L). 
3. For every ordered pair (a, b) ‚àà L √ó L their exists a unique pair (x, y) ‚àà L √ó L 
such that ax = b and ya = b. 
 
We say L is a commutative loop if a ‚Ä¢ b = b ‚Ä¢ a for all a, b ‚àà L. 
 
The number of elements in a loop L is the order of the loop denoted by o (L) or |L|, if 
|L| < ‚àù, it is finite otherwise infinite. 
 
In this section, all the examples of the loops given are constructed by us. 
 
Example 1.5.1: Let L = {e, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}. Define a binary operation ‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó given by the 
following table:  
 
‚àó

This loop is non commutative.

The loop (L, ‚àó) is a commutative one with order 8. 
 
DEFINITION: Let L be a loop. A nonempty subset P of L is called a sub loop of L if P itself is 
a loop under the operation of L. 
 
Example 1.5.3: For the loop L given in example 1.5.1. {e, a1}, {e, a2}, {e, a3}, {e, a4} and {e, 
a5} are the sub loops of order 2. 
 
For definition of Bol loop, Bruck loop, Moufang loop, alternative loop etc. please 
refer Bruck .R.H. A Survey of binary systems (1958). 
 
Example 1.5.4: Let L = {e, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}; {L, ‚àó} is a loop given by the following table:

CHAPTER TWO 
			
 
This chapter is completely devoted to the introduction to groupoids and the study of 
several properties and new concepts in them. We make this explicit by illustrative examples. 
Apart from this, several identities like Moufang, Bol, etc are defined on a groupoid  and 
conditions are derived from them to satisfy these identities. It is certainly a loss to see when 
semigroups, which are nothing but associative groupoids are studied, groupoids which are 
more generalized concept of semigroups are not dealt well in general books.  
 
In the first chapter, we define special identities in groupoids followed by study of sub 
structures in a groupoid and direct product of groupoids. We define some special properties 
of groupoids like conjugate subgroupoids and normal subgroupoids and obtain some 
interesting results about them. 
 
 
2.1 Special Properties in Groupoids 
 
In this section we introduce the notion of special identities like Bol identity, Moufang 
identity etc., to groupoids and give examples of each. 
 
DEFINITION: A groupoid G is said to be a Moufang groupoid if it satisfies the Moufang  
identity (xy) (zx) = (x(yz))x for all x, y, z in G. 
 
Example 2.1.1: Let (G, ‚àó) be a groupoid given by the following table: 
 
‚àó 
a0 
a1 
a2 
a3 
a0 
a0 
a2

(a1 ‚àó a3) ‚àó (a2 ‚àó a1) = (a1 ‚àó (a3 ‚àó a2)) ‚àó a1  
(a1 ‚àó a3) ‚àó (a2 ‚àó a3) = a3 ‚àó a0 = a3. 
 

 
 
20 
Now (a1 ‚àó (a3 ‚àó a2)) a1 = (a1 ‚àó a3) ‚àó a1 = a3 ‚àó a1 = a1. Since (a1 ‚àó a3) (a2 ‚àó a1) ‚â† (a1 (a3 ‚àó 
a2)) ‚àó a1, we see G is not a Moufang groupoid.  
 
DEFINITION: A groupoid G is said to be a Bol groupoid if G satisfies the Bol identity ((xy) z) 
y = x ((yz) y) for all x, y, z in G. 
 
Example 2.1.2: Let (G, ‚àó) be a groupoid given by the following table:

It can be easily verified that the groupoid (G, ‚àó) is a Bol groupoid. 
 
DEFINITION: A groupoid G is said to be a P-groupoid if (xy) x = x (yx) for all x, y ‚àà G. 
 
DEFINITION: A groupoid G is said to be right alternative if it satisfies the identity (xy) y = x 
(yy) for all x, y ‚àà G. Similarly we define G to be left alternative if (xx) y = x (xy) for all x, y ‚àà 
G. 
 
DEFINITION: A groupoid G is alternative if it is both right and left alternative, 
simultaneously. 
 
Example 2.1.3: Consider the groupoid (G, ‚àó) given by the following table:

It is left for the reader to verify this groupoid is a P-groupoid.

It is left for the reader to verify that (G, ‚àó) is a right alternative groupoid.

2.2 Substructures in Groupoids 
 
In this section, we define properties on subsets of a groupoid like subgroupoid, 
conjugate subgroupoid, ideals etc. and derive some interesting results using them. 
 
DEFINITION: Let (G, ‚àó) be a groupoid. A proper subset H of G is said to be a subgroupoid of 
G if (H, ‚àó) is itself a groupoid.

Clearly every singleton is a subgroupoid in G, as ai ‚àó ai = ai for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. 
 
DEFINITION: A groupoid G is said to be an idempotent groupoid if x2 = x for all x ‚àà G. 
 
The groupoid given in example 2.2.2 is an idempotent groupoid of order 5. 
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a groupoid. P a non empty proper subset of G, P is said to be a left 
ideal of the groupoid G if  1) P is a subgroupoid of G and 2) For all x ‚àà G and a ‚àà P, xa ‚àà 
P. 
One can similarly define right ideal of the groupoid G. P is called an ideal if P is 
simultaneously a left and a right ideal of the groupoid G.  
 
Example 2.2.3: Consider the groupoid G given by the following table: 
 
‚àó

P = {a0, a2} and Q = {a1, a3} are right ideals of G. Clearly P and Q are not left ideals 
of G. In fact G has no left ideals only 2 right ideals.

Clearly P = {a0, a2, a4} is both a right and a left ideal of G; in fact an ideal of G.

Clearly, G has P = {a0, a2} and Q = {a1, a3} to be the only left ideals of G and G has 
no right ideals. Now we proceed to define normal subgroupoids of G. 
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a groupoid A subgroupoid V of G is said to be a normal subgroupoid 
of G if  
 
1. aV = Va  
2. (Vx)y = V(xy) 
3. y(xV) = (yx)V 
for all x, y, a ‚àà V. 
 
Example 2.2.6: Consider the groupoid given in example 2.2.4. Clearly P = {a0, a2, a4} is a 
normal subgroupoid of G. 
 
DEFINITION: A groupoid G is said to be simple if it has no non trivial normal subgroupoids. 
 
Example 2.2.7: The groupoid G given by the following table is simple.

It is left for the reader to verify (G, ‚àó) = {a0, a1, a2, ... , a6, ‚àó} has no normal 
subgroupoids. Hence, G is simple. 
 
DEFINITION: A groupoid G is normal if  
 
1. 
xG = Gx  
2. 
G(xy) = (Gx)y  
3. 
y(xG) = (yx)G  for all x, y ‚àà G.

This groupoid is a normal groupoid.  
 
This has no proper subgroupoid, which is normal. 
 
 
Not all groupoids in general are normal by an example.

This groupoid is not normal. Clearly a1 ‚Ä¢ (a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9) = a1G = {a1, a3, 
a5, a7, a9} where as Ga1 = G. So G is not a normal groupoid. 
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a groupoid H and K be two proper subgroupoids of G, with H ‚à© K = 
œÜ. We say H is conjugate with K if there exists a x ‚àà H such that H = x K or Kx ('or' in the 
mutually exclusive sense).

Take K = {a0, a3, a6, a9} and H = {a2, a5, a8, a11}, H ‚à© K = œÜ. 
 
It can be verified the subgroupoids H and K are conjugate with each other. 
 
To get more normal subgroupoids and ideals, that is to make groupoids have richer 
structures we define direct products of groupoids.  
 
DEFINITION: Let (G1, Œ∏1), (G2, Œ∏2), ... , (Gn, Œ∏n) be n groupoids with Œ∏i binary operations 
defined on each Gi, i = 1, 2, 3, ... , n. The direct product of G1, ... , Gn denoted by G = G1 √ó ... 
√ó Gn = {(g1, ... , gn) | gi ‚àà Gi} by component wise multiplication on G, G becomes a groupoid. 
 
For if g = (g1, ... , gn) and h = (h1, ... , hn) then g ‚Ä¢ h = {(g1Œ∏1h1, g2Œ∏2h2, ... , gnŒ∏nhn)}. Clearly, 
gh ‚àà G. Hence G is a groupoid.  
 
This direct product helps us to construct more groupoids with desired properties. For 
example by using several simple groupoids, we can get a groupoid, which may not be simple. 
Likewise, we can get normal groupoids and normal subgroupoids using the direct product. 
 
Example 2.2.11: Let (G1, ‚àó) and (G2, o) be 2 groupoids given by the following tables:

G1 √ó G2= {(ai, xj) | ai ‚àà G1, i = 0, 1, 2 xj ‚àà G2, j = 0, 1, 2, 3}. G1 √ó G2 is a groupoid of 
order 12. It is left for the reader to find the subgroupoids, if any, normal subgroupoids if any, 
ideals if any (right, left) and so on.

PROBLEM 12: Is the direct product of simple groupoids G1, G2, G3 make G, (G = G1 √ó G2 √ó

2.3 Some Special Properties of a Groupoid 
 
In this section, we define some special properties of groupoids like inner 
commutative, left (right) identity, left (right) zero divisor, center of the groupoid, conjugate 
pair etc. We illustrate these properties by several interesting examples. This is done mainly 
as, we do not have any textbook on groupoids. 
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a groupoid, we say G is inner commutative if every subgroupoid of G 
is commutative. 
 
Example 2.3.1: Consider the groupoid G = {x0, x1, ... , x11} given by the following table:

The subgroupoids of G are P1 = {x0, x4, x8}, P2 = {x1, x5, x9}, P3 = {x2, x6, x10} and P4 
= {x3, x7, x11}. Clearly this groupoid is inner commutative.  
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a groupoid we say an element e ‚àà G is a left identity if ea = a for all 
a ‚àà G. Similarly we can define right identity of the groupoid G, if e ‚àà G happens to be 
simultaneously both right and left identity we say the groupoid G has an identity.  
 
Example 2.3.2: In groupoid given in example 2.3.1 we see a ‚àó e = a for e = x0 and for all a ‚àà 
G thus x0 is the right identity of G.  
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a groupoid. We say a in G has right zero divisor if a ‚àó b = 0 for some 
b ‚â† 0 in G and a in G has left zero divisor if b ‚àó a = 0. We say G has zero divisors if a ‚Ä¢ b = 0 
and b ‚àó a = 0 for a, b ‚àà G \ {0} A zero divisor in G can be left or right divisor. 
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a groupoid. The center of the groupoid C (G) = {x ‚ààG | ax = xa for 
all a ‚àà G}. 
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a groupoid. We say a, b ‚àà G is a conjugate pair if a = bx (or xa for 
some x ‚àà G) and b = ay (or ya for some y ‚àà G). 

 
 
28 
 
Example 2.3.3: Let G be a groupoid given by the following table: 
 
‚Ä¢ 
0

2 
3

5

4 ‚àó 2 = 0 but 2 ‚àó 4 = 2 
2 ‚àó 1 = 0 but 1 ‚àó 2 = 1  
 
 
 
 
5 ‚àó 6 = 0 but 6 ‚àó 5 = 6 
3 ‚àó 5 = 0 but 5 ‚àó 3 = 5  
 
 
 
 
6 ‚àó 3 = 0 but 3 ‚àó 6 = 3 
 
Thus we see from this example a ‚Ä¢ b = 0 need not imply b ‚Ä¢ a = 0. That is why we can 
have an element in a groupoid to be right zero divisor or a left zero divisor.  
 
Example 2.3.4: Let G be a groupoid given by the following table: 
 
‚àó 
a0

a0 
a0 
a2 
a1

The center of G is C (G) = œÜ. 
 
Example 2.3.5: Let G be a groupoid given by the following table:

Clearly (1, 2) is a conjugate pair as 2.0 = 1 and 1.0 = 2, (0,1) is also a conjugate pair 
as  0 = 1.1, 1 = 0.1; 0 is conjugate to 1. 
 
DEFINITION: A groupoid G is said to be strictly non commutative if  a ‚Ä¢ b ‚â† b ‚àó a for any a, b 
‚àà G where a ‚â† b. 
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a groupoid of order n. An element a in G is said to be right conjugate

2.4 Infinite Groupoids and its Properties  
 
In this section, we introduce several interesting classes of groupoids of infinite order 
constructed using integers or rationals or reals. We obtain some important properties satisfied 
by them. It is pertinent to note that we are not in a position to get infinite Smarandache 
groupoids, which remains as an open problem. 
 
DEFINITION: Let Z+ be the set of integers. Define an operation ‚àó on Z+ by x ‚àó y = mx + ny 
where m, n ‚àà Z+, m < ‚àù and n < ‚àù (m, n) = 1 and m ‚â† n. Clearly {Z+, ‚àó, (m, n)} is a 
groupoid denoted by Z+ (m, n). We have for varying m and n get infinite number of groupoids 
of infinite order denoted by Z/ +. 
 
Example 2.4.1: Z+ (1, 3) = {4, 5, 6, 7, ... ‚àù} is a non commutative and non associative 
groupoid of infinite order with no identity. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.1: No groupoid in the class Z/ + is commutative. 
 
Proof: It is left for the reader to verify this result. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.2: No groupoid in the class Z/ + is associative. 
 
Proof: Simple number theoretic methods will yield the result. 
 
COROLLARY 2.4.3: No groupoid in this class Z/ + is a semigroup. 
 
Proof: Follows from theorem 2.4.2. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.4: No groupoid in this class Z/ + is a P-groupoid. 
 

 
 
30 
Proof: Let Z+ (m, n) be a groupoid in Z/ +. If Z+ (m, n) is said to be a P-groupoid it must 
satisfy (x ‚àó y) ‚àó x = x ‚àó (y ‚àó x) that is m2x + mny + nx= mx + mny + n2x. This is impossible 
for any m ‚â† n, (m, n) = 1 and m, n ‚àà Z+. Hence the claim. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.5: Groupoids Z+ (1, 2m), m ‚àà Z+ in Z/ + always have subgroupoids of infinite 
order. 
 
Proof: Follows by simple number theoretic techniques. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.6: The groupoids Z+ (1, p) where p is a prime can be partitioned as conjugate 
subgroupoids. 
 
Proof: Simple number theoretic methods will yield the result. We can now construct still 
many more classes of groupoids using Z+ by making m ‚â† n but m need not be relatively 
prime with n; still another new class by making m = n. Similarly by replacing Z+ by Q+ or R+ 
also, we can construct different classes of infinite groupoids and similar results can be got 
using Q+ and R+. 
  
 
PROBLEM 1: Find all the subgroupoids in Z+ (3, 6). 
 
PROBLEM 2: Does Z+ (3, 11) have conjugate subgroupoids? 
 
PROBLEM 3: Find subgroupoids of Q+ (11/3, 7/3). 
 
PROBLEM 4: Can R+ (‚àö2, ‚àö3) have subgroupoids, which are conjugate with each other? 
 
PROBLEM 5: Is Q (7, 11) a P-groupoid? 
 
PROBLEM 6: Can R (2, 4) be a Moufang groupoid? 
 
PROBLEM 7: Can Q (7, 49) have conjugate subgroupoids? 
 
PROBLEM 8: Find (t, u) so that Q (t, u) has conjugate subgroupoids which partition Q (t, u). 
 
PROBLEM 9: If Z (m, n) has conjugate subgroupoids that partition  Z (m, n) find m and n.

CHAPTER THREE 


In this chapter, we introduce four new classes of groupoids using Zn. We study their 
properties. These new classes are different in their own way and they enjoy nice properties. 
To the best of the authors knowledge this chapter is the first attempt to construct non abstract 
classes of finite groupoids using Zn. Throughout this chapter Zn denotes the set of integers 
modulo n that is Zn = {0, 1, 2, 3, ... , n}; n ‚â• 3, n < ‚àù.  
 
 
3.1 Definition of the Class of Groupoids Z (n) 
 
Here we define a new class of groupoids denoted by Z (n) using Zn and study their 
various properties. 
 
DEFINITION: Let Zn = {0, 1, 2, ... , n ‚Äì 1} n  ‚â• 3. For a, b ‚àà Zn \ {0} define a binary operation 
‚àó on Zn as follows. a ‚àó b = ta + ub (mod n) where t,u are 2 distinct elements in Zn \ {0} and (t, 
u) =1 here ' + ' is the usual addition of 2 integers and ' ta '  means the product of the two 
integers t and a. We denote this groupoid by {Zn, (t, u), ‚àó} or in short by Zn (t, u).  
 
It is interesting to note that for varying t, u ‚àà Zn  \ {0} with (t, u) = 1 we get a 
collection of groupoids for a fixed integer n. This collection of groupoids is denoted by Z (n) 
that is Z (n) = {Zn, (t, u), ‚àó | for integers t, u ‚àà Zn \ {0} such that (t, u) = 1}. Clearly every 
groupoid in this class is of order n. 
 
Example 3.1.1: Using Z3 = {0, 1, 2}. The groupoid {Z3, (1, 2), ‚àó} = (Z3 (1, 2)) is given by 
the following table: 
 
‚àó 
0 
1 
2 
0 
0 
2 
1 
1 
1 
0 
2 
2 
2 
1 
0 
 
Clearly this groupoid is non associative and non commutative and its order is 3.  
 

 
 
32 
Example 3.1.2: Let Z3 = {0, 1, 2}, Z3 (2, 1) ‚àà Z (3) is a groupoid given by the following 
table: 
 
‚àó 
0 
1 
2 
0 
0 
1 
2 
1 
2 
0 
1 
2 
1 
2 
0 
 
This groupoid is also non commutative and non associative. Hence, in Z (3) we have 
only 2 groupoids of order 3 using Z3. 
 
Example 3.1.3: Let Z7 = {0, 1, 2, ... , 6}. The groupoid Z7 (3, 4) is given by the following 
table: 
 
‚àó 
0

This is a finite groupoid of order 7, which is non commutative. 
 
THEOREM 3.1.1: Let Zn = {0, 1, 2, ... , n}. A groupoid in Z (n) is a semigroup if and only if t2 
‚â° t (mod n) and u2 ‚â° u (mod n) for t, u ‚àà Zn \ {0} and (t, u) = 1. 
 
Proof: Given Zn = {0, 1, 2, ... , n ‚Äì 1}. Let t, u ‚àà Zn \ {0} with t2 ‚â° t (mod n), u2 ‚â° u (mod n) 
and (t, u) = 1 to show Zn (t, u) is a semigroup it is sufficient if we show (a ‚àó b) ‚àó c  = a ‚àó (b ‚àó 
c) for all a, b, c ‚àà Zn. 
 
 
a ‚àó (b ‚àó c) = a ‚àó (tb + uc) (mod n) = ta + utb + u2c (mod n). Now (a ‚àó b) ‚àó c = (ta + 
ub) ‚àó c (mod n) = t2a + utb + uc (mod n). Using t2 ‚â° t (mod n) and u2 ‚â° u (mod n) we see a ‚àó 
(b ‚àó c) = (a ‚àó b) ‚àó c. Hence Zn (t, u) is a semigroup.  
 
On the other hand if Zn (t, u) is a semigroup to show t2 ‚â° t (mod n) and u2 ‚â° u (mod 
n). Given Zn (t, u) is a semigroup so a ‚àó (b ‚àó c) ‚â° (a ‚àó b) ‚àó c (mod n) for all a, b, c ‚àà Zn. 
 
Now a ‚àó (b ‚àó c) = (a ‚àó b) ‚àó c implies ta + tub + u2c = t2a + tub + uc. So (t ‚Äì t2) a + (u2 
‚Äì u) c ‚â° o (mod n) this is possible for all a, c ‚àà Zn only if t2 ‚â° t (mod n) and u2 ‚â° u (mod n). 
Hence the claim. 
 
COROLLARY 3.1.2: If in the above theorem when; n is a prime Z (n) never contains a 
semigroup. 
 
 

 
 
33 
Proof: Since t2 ‚â° t (mod n) or u2 ‚â° u (mod n) can never occur for t, u ‚àà Zn \ {0, 1} when n is a 
prime, Z (n) has no semigroups. 
 
THEOREM 3.1.3: The groupoid Zn (t, u) is an idempotent groupoid if and only if t + u ‚â° 1 
(mod n). 
 
Proof: If Zn (t, u) is to be an idempotent groupoid then a2 ‚â° a (mod n) for all a ‚àà Zn. Now a2 = 
a ‚àó a = ta + ua = a (mod n) that is (t + u ‚Äì 1) a ‚â° 0 (mod n). This is possible if and only if t + u 
‚â° 1 (mod n).  
 
THEOREM 3.1.4: No groupoid in Z (n) has {0} as an ideal.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definition of groupoids in Z (n). 
 
Example 3.1.4: Consider the groupoid Z4 (2, 3) and Z4 (3, 2) in Z (4) given by the following 
tables:

P ={0, 2} and Q = {1, 3} are the left ideals of Z4 (2, 3). These two left ideals are not 
right ideals.

Clearly P = {0, 2} and Q = {1, 3} are right ideal of Z4 (3, 2) and are not left ideals of 
Z4 (3, 2).  
 
Consequent of the example we have the following theorem. 
 
THEOREM 3.1.5: P is a left ideal of Zn (t, u) if and only if P is a right ideal of Zn (u, t). 
 
Proof: Simple number theoretic computations and the simple translation of rows to columns 
gives a transformation of Zn (t, u) to Zn (u, t) and this will yield the result.

3.2 New Class of Groupoids Z‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) 
 
In this section, we introduce another new class of groupoids Z‚àó(n), which is a 
generalization of the class of groupoids Z (n) and the class of groupoids Z (n) is a proper 
subclass of Z‚àó(n). We study these groupoids and obtain some interesting results about them. 
 
DEFINITION: Let Zn = {0, 1, 2, ... , n ‚Äì1} n ‚â• 3, n < ‚àù. Define ‚àó a closed binary operation on 
Zn as follows. For any a, b ‚àà Zn define a ‚àó b = at + bu (mod n) where (t, u) need not always 
be relatively prime but t ‚â† u and t, u ‚àà Zn \ {0}.  
 
Clearly {Zn, (t, u), ‚àó} is a groupoid of order n. For varying values of t and u we get a 
class of groupoids for the fixed integer n. This new class of groupoids is denoted by Z‚àó(n). 
Z‚àó(n) is an extended class of Z (n) that is Z (n) ‚äÇ Z‚àó(n). We denote the groupoids in the class 
Z‚àó(n) by Zn
‚àó(t, u). Even if ' ‚àó ' is omitted by looking at (t, u) ‚â† 1 we can easily guess that Zn (t, 
u) is in the class Z‚àó(n). In this section we only concentrate on groupoids in Z‚àó(n) and not in Z 
(n). 
 
Example 3.2.1: Let Z5 (2, 4) ‚àà Z‚àó(5) be the groupoid given by the following table:  
 
‚àó 
0 
1 
2

36 
The subgroupoids of Z5 (2, 4) are A1 = {1}, A2 = {2}, A3 = {3} and A4 = {4}. Thus 
singletons are the only subgroupoids of the groupoid Z5 (2, 4). 
 
Example 3.2.2: The groupoid Z6 (2, 4) ‚àà Z‚àó(6) is given by the following table: 
 
‚àó

Clearly A= {0, 2, 4} is a subgroupoid of Z6 (2, 4). 
 
THEOREM 3.2.1: The number of groupoids in Z‚àó(n) is (n ‚Äì 1) (n ‚Äì 2). 
 
Proof: Left for the reader to verify using simple number theoretic techniques. 
 
THEOREM 3.2.2: The number of groupoids in the class Z (n) is bounded by (n ‚Äì 1) (n ‚Äì 2). 
 
Proof: Follows from the fact Z (n) ‚äÇ Z‚àó(n) and |Z (n)| < |Z‚àó(n)| = (n ‚Äì1) (n ‚Äì 2). Hence the 
claim. 
 
Example 3.2.3: Consider the groupoid Z8 (2, 6) in Z‚àó(8) given by the following table:

Clearly {0, 2, 4, 6} is a subgroupoid of Z8 (2, 6). 
 
THEOREM 3.2.3: Let Zn (t, u) be a groupoid in Z‚àó(n) such that (t, u) = t, n = 2m, t / 2m and t 
+ u = 2m. Then Zn (t, u) has subgroupoids of order 2m / t or n / t. 
 
Proof: Given n is even and t + u = n so that u = n ‚Äì t. Thus Zn (t, u) = Zn (t, n ‚Äì t). Now using 
the fact

that is t . Zn has only n / t elements and these n / t 
elements from a subgroupoid. Hence Zn (t, n ‚Äì t) where (t, n ‚Äì t) = t has only subgroupoids of 
order n / t.

This has a subgroupoid P = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10} of order 6 that is 12 / 2. 
 
Example 3.2.5: Consider the groupoid Z12 (3, 9) the subgroupoid of Z12 (3, 9) is {0, 3, 6, 9} 
which is order 4 that is 12 / 3. 
 
Example 3.2.6: Consider the groupoid Z12 (4, 8). The subgroupoid of Z12 (4, 8) is P = {0, 4, 
8} of order 3 that is 12 / 4. Thus the class Z‚àó(12) when t + u = 12, (t, u) = t gives 3 distinct 
groupoids having subgroupoids of order 6, 4 and 3. 
 
THEOREM 3.2.4: Let Zn (t, u) ‚àà Z‚àó(n) be a groupoid such that n is even t + u = n with (t, u) 
= t. Then Zn (t, u) has only one subgroupoid of order   n / t and it is a normal subgroupoid of 
Zn (t, u). 
 
Proof: This is left for the reader to verify.

The subgroupoids of Z12 (10, 8) are A = {0, 4, 8} and B = {2, 6, 10}. This has 2 
subgroupoids of order 3. 
 
Example 3.2.8: Let Z10 (8, 4) ‚àà Z‚àó(10) be the groupoid of order 10. 
 
The only subgroupoid of Z10 (8, 4) is {0, 4, 2, 8, 6} which is of order 5 and (8, 4) = 4. 
So we see in our theorem 3.2.4 that only when (t, u) = t with t + u = n we need have 
subgroupoids but other wise also we have subgroupoids which is evident from the following 
table given for the groupoid Z10 (8, 4).

3.3 On New Class of Groupoids Z‚àó‚àó
‚àó‚àó
‚àó‚àó
‚àó‚àó(n) 
 
In this section we introduce yet another new class of groupoids, which is a 
generalization of Z‚àó(n) using Zn and study their properties and obtain some interesting results 
about them. 
 
DEFINITION: Let Zn = {0, 1, 2, ... , n ‚Äì 1} n ‚â• 3, n < ‚àù. Define ‚àó on Zn as a ‚àó b = ta + ub 
(mod n) where t and u ‚àà Zn \ {0} and t can also equal u. For a fixed n and for varying t and u 
we get a class of groupoids of order n which we denote by Z‚àó‚àó(n).  
 
For a fixed integer n we have (n ‚Äì 1)2 groupoids in the class Z‚àó‚àó(n). 
 
Example 3.3.1: Let Z5 (2, 2) ‚àà Z‚àó‚àó(5) be the groupoid given by the following table: 
 
‚àó

This groupoid is commutative which is non associative. This has no subgroupoids. 
 
Example 3.3.2: Let Z7 (3, 3) ‚àà Z‚àó‚àó(7) be the groupoid given by the following table:

This groupoid is also commutative and non associative having no subgroupoids.

This is a commutative groupoid and has {0, 2, 4} as subgroupoid so we consider that 
if n is not a prime we may have subgroupoids. 
 
Example 3.3.4: Z6 (5, 5) ‚àà Z‚àó‚àó(6) is given by the following table:

This has {4} and {2} as subgroupoids. 
 
THEOREM 3.3.1: The groupoids Zn (t, t) ‚àà Z‚àó‚àó(n) for t < n are commutative groupoids. 
 
Proof: Let a, b ‚àà Zn now consider a ‚àó b = ta + tb (mod n) and b ‚àó a = tb + ta (mod n). Clearly 
a ‚àó b ‚â° b ‚àó a (mod n) for every a, b ‚àà Zn. So Zn (t, t) is a commutative groupoids. 
 
THEOREM 3.3.2: The groupoids Zp (t, t) ‚àà Z‚àó‚àó(5), p a prime, t < p are normal groupoids. 
 
Proof: Clearly in the groupoid Zn (t, t) we have aZn  (t, t) = Zn (t, t) a and ([Zn (t, t)] x) y = [Zn 
(t, t)] (xy) for all x, y ‚àà Zn (t, t), y (xZn (t, t)) = (yx) [Zn (t, t)] for all a, x, y ‚àà Zn (t, t). The 
verification is simple and left for the reader. 
  
THEOREM 3.3.3: The groupoids Zn (t, t) ‚àà Z‚àó‚àó(n) are P-groupoids. 
 
Proof: Let Zn (t, t) be a groupoid. If Zn (t, t) is to be a P-groupoid we must have (x ‚àó y) ‚àó x = 
x ‚àó (y ‚àó x). Now (x ‚àó y) ‚àóx = (tx + ty) ‚àó x = t2x + t2y + tx (mod n) and x ‚àó (y ‚àó x) = x ‚àó (ty + 
tx) = tx + t2y + t2x. 
 
Clearly; (x ‚àó y) ‚àó x = x ‚àó (y ‚àó x) for all x, y ‚àà Zn (t, t). Hence the claim. 
 
THEOREM 3.3.4: Let Zn (t, t) ‚àà Z‚àó‚àó(n) be a groupoid, n a prime 1 < t < n. Clearly Zn (t, t) is 
not an alternative groupoid if p is a prime. 
 
Proof: Now Zn (t, t) where n is a prime and 1 < t < n, to show the groupoid is alternative we 
have to prove (xy) y = x (yy) for all x, y ‚àà Zn (t, t). Since t2 ‚â° t (mod p) is never possible if t ‚â† 
1. Consider (x ‚àó y) ‚àó y = (tx + ty) ‚àó y = t2x + t2y + ty. Now x ‚àó (y ‚àó y) = x ‚àó (ty + ty) = t2x + 
t2y + t2y.  So, t2x + t2y + ty ‚â† tx + t2y + t2y if n is a prime. Hence, Zn (t, t) is not an alternative 
groupoid. 
 
COROLLARY 3.3.5: Let Zn (t, t) be a groupoid where n is not a prime. Zn(t, t) is an 
alternative groupoid if and only if t2 ‚â° t (mod n). 
 

 
 
41 
Proof: Obvious from the fact that if Zn (t, t) is alternative then t2x + t2y + ty ‚â° tx + t2y + t2y 
(mod n) that is if and only if t2 ‚â° t (mod n). 
 
 
PROBLEM 1: Does Z18 (9, 9) have any normal subgroupoid? 
 
PROBLEM 2: Can Z18 (9, 9) have two subgroupoids, which are conjugate subgroupoids?  
 
PROBLEM 3: Prove Z7 (4, 4) is an idempotent groupoid? 
 
PROBLEM 4: Can Z9 (t, t) be an idempotent groupoid if t ‚â† 5?

PROBLEM 10: Is Z25 (17, 17) a normal groupoid? 
 
 
3.4 On Groupoids Z‚àó‚àó‚àó
‚àó‚àó‚àó
‚àó‚àó‚àó
‚àó‚àó‚àó(n)  
 
In this chapter, we introduce the most generalized class of groupoids using Zn. We 
have Z (n) ‚äÇ Z‚àó(n) ‚äÇ Z‚àó‚àó(n) ‚äÇ Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n). Thus, Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) is the groupoid, which has many more 
interesting properties than the other classes. We now proceed on to define this new class of 
groupoids. 
 
DEFINITION: Let Zn = {0, 1, 2, ... , n ‚Äì 1} n ‚â• 3, n < ‚àù. Define ‚àó on Zn as follows. a ‚àó b = ta 
+ ub (mod n) where t, u ‚àà Zn. Here t or u can also be zero.  
 
For a fixed n if we collect the set of all groupoids and denote it by Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n). Clearly 
Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) contains n (n ‚Äì 1) groupoids each of order n. 
 
Example 3.4.1: The groupoid Z6 (3, 0) ‚àà Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(6) be given by the following table: 
 
‚àó 
0 
1

Clearly this is a non commutative groupoid having {0, 3} as its subgroupoid. 
 
Example 3.4.2: Consider the groupoid Z6 (0, 2) in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(6) given by the following table:

This is a non commutative groupoid with {0, 2, 4} as its subgroupoid. 
 
THEOREM 3.4.1: The groupoids Zn (0, t) ‚àà Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) is a P-groupoid and alternative groupoid 
if and only if t2 ‚â° t mod n. 
 
Proof: This is left as an exercise for the reader to prove the result. 
 
Here we do not prove many of the results as the main aim of this book is to display 
Smarandache groupoid notions and give central importance only to them so several proofs in 
groupoids in chapter 2 and chapter 3 are left for reader to prove using number theoretic 
notions.  
 
So we propose the proof of these results as problem at the end of the section for the 
reader to prove them. 
 
 
PROBLEM 1: Does the groupoid Z11 (3, 0) satisfy the Moufang identity? 
 
PROBLEM 2: Can Z19 (0, 2) have a proper subgroupoids? 
 
PROBLEM 3: Find all the subgroupoids in Z24 (0, 6). 
 
PROBLEM 4: Is Z7 (0, 4) a normal groupoid? 
 
PROBLEM 5: Is Zn (t, 0) a Bol groupoid? 
 
PROBLEM 6: Will Z20 (0, 4) be an alternative groupoid? 
 
PROBLEM 7: Can Zn (t, 0) satisfy Moufang identity? 
 
PROBLEM 8: Will Z13 (0, 3) be an alternative groupoid? 
 
PROBLEM 9: Find all subgroupoids and ideals if any of Z12 (4, 0).

3.5 Groupoids with Identity Using Zn 
 
We saw that all the four new classes of groupoids built using Zn viz, Z (n), Z‚àó(n), 
Z‚àó‚àó(n) and Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) had no groupoid (which are not semigroups) with identity. Hence we have 
proposed in Chapter 7 an open problem about the possible construction of a groupoid which 
is not a semigroup using Zn. The only way to obtain groupoids with identity is by adjoining 
an element with Zn. 
 
DEFINITION: Let Zn = {0, 1, 2, ... , n ‚Äì 1} n ‚â• 3, n < ‚àù. Let G = Zn ‚à™ {e} where e ‚àâ Zn. 
Define operation ‚àó on G by ai ‚àó ai = e for all ai ‚àà Zn and ai ‚àó e = e ‚àó ai = ai for all ai ‚àà Zn.  
 
Finally ai ‚àó aj = tai + uaj (mod n) t, u ‚àà Zn. It can be checked (G, ‚àó) is a groupoid 
with identity e and the order of G is n + 1. 
 
Example 3.5.1: Let G = {Z3 (2, 2) ‚à™ e} the groupoid (G, ‚àó) is given by the following table: 
 
‚àó 
e 
0 
1 
2 
e 
e 
0 
1 
2

0 
e 
2 
1 
1 
1 
2 
e 
0 
2 
2 
1 
0 
e 
 
This is a commutative groupoid with identity. 
 
Example 3.5.2: Let G = {Zn (t, u) ‚à™ e} the groupoid (G, *) is a groupoid with identity then 
every pair {m, e} by the very definition is a subgroupoid of G.  
 
THEOREM 3.5.1: Let G = (Zn (t, u) ‚à™ {e}) e ‚àâ Zn, be a groupoid with operation ‚àó defined by 
m ‚àó m = e and m ‚àó e = e ‚àó m = m for all m ‚àà G. Then (G, ‚àó) is a groupoid with unit and has 
non trivial subgroups. 
 
Proof: It is clear from the fact that every pair {m, e} is a cyclic group of order 2; Hence the 
claim. 
 
THEOREM 3.5.2: Let G = (Zn (m, m‚Äì1) ‚à™ {e}) if n > 3, n odd and t is a positive integer from 
Zn such that (m, n) = 1 and (m ‚Äì 1, n) = 1 with m < n and ‚àó is an operation such that  
 
1. e ‚àó i = i ‚àó e = i for all i ‚àà G 
2. i ‚àó i = e for all i ‚àà G 
3. i ‚àó j = [mj ‚Äì (m ‚Äì 1)i] mod n 
 
for all i, j ‚àà Zn, i ‚â† j, then G = (Zn (m, m ‚Äì 1) ‚à™ {e}) is a loop which is a groupoid. 
 
Proof: Since simple number theoretic methods will yield the results, It is left for the reader to 
prove that (G, ‚àó) is a loop. 
 

 
 
44 
Thus, we do not know whether there exists groupoids with identity using Zn other 
than the once mentioned here got by adjoining an extra element e. 
 
Thus we see we can have groupoids with identity given by G = (Zn ‚à™ {e}). 
 
PROBLEM 1: Find how many groupoid exist using Z5 ‚à™ {e}. (' ‚àó ' defined as in the 
definition).

CHAPTER FOUR  
		
 
In this chapter, we show the notion of SG, define and study several of its new 
properties. Here we work on new Smarandache substructures, identities on SGs and study 
them. We have given many examples of SG to make the concepts defined about them 
explicit. 
 
 
4.1 Smarandache Groupoids 
 
DEFINITION: A Smarandache groupoid G is a groupoid which has a proper subset S, S ‚äÇ G 
such that S under the operations of G is a semigroup.  
 
Example 4.1.1: Let (G, ‚àó) be a groupoid given by the following table: 
 
 
‚àó 0 1 2 3 4 5 
0 0 3 0 3 0 3 
1 1 4 1 4 1 4 
2 2 5 2 5 2 5 
3 3 0 3 0 3 0 
4 4 1 4 1 4 1 
5 5 2 5 2 5 2 
 
 
Clearly, S1 = {0, 3}, S2 = {1, 4} and S3 = {2, 5} are proper subsets of G which are 
semigroups of G.  
 
So (G, ‚àó) is a SG.  
 
Example 4.1.2: Let G be a groupoid on Z10 = {0, 1, 2, ‚Ä¶ , 9}. Define operation ‚àó on Z10 for 
1, 5 ‚àà Z10 \ {0} by a ‚àó b = 1a + 5b (mod 10) for all a, b ‚àà Z10.  
 
The groupoid is given by the following table:

Clearly, (G, ‚àó) = Z10 (1, 5) is a SG as S = {0, 5} is a semigroup of Z10.  
 
Example 4.1.3: Let Z+ ‚à™ {0} be the set of integers. Define ' ‚Äì ' the difference between any 
two elements as a binary operation on Z+ ‚à™ {0}. Z+ ‚à™ {0} is a SG as every set {0, n}; n ‚àà Z+ 
is a semigroup of Z+ ‚à™ {0}.  
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a Smarandache groupoid (SG) if the number of elements in G is finite 
we say G is a finite SG, otherwise G is said to be an infinite SG. 
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a Smarandache groupoid. G is said to be a Smarandache 
commutative groupoid if there is a proper subset, which is a semigroup, is a commutative 
semigroup.  
 
Example 4.1.4: Let G = {a1, a2, a3} be a groupoid given by the following table:  
 
 
‚àó 
a1 
a2 
a3 
a1 
a1 
a3 
a2 
a2 
a2 
a1 
a3 
a3 
a3 
a2 
a1 
 
Clearly, G is a groupoid and G is not commutative as a2 ‚àó a3 ‚â† a3 ‚àó a2 but G is a 
Smarandache commutative groupoid as {a1} = S is a commutative semigroup of G. G is not a 
commutative groupoid but G is a Smarandache commutative groupoid.  
 
Example 4.1.5: Let G be a groupoid given by the following table:  
 
‚àó 
ao

 Clearly, G is a non-commutative groupoid but G is a Smarandache commutative 
groupoid as P1 = {a0}, P2 = {a1}, P3 = {a3} and P4 = {a2} are the only proper subsets which 
are semigroups of G and all of them are commutative. 
 
This following example is a non-commutative groupoid, which is a Smarandache 
commutative groupoid. 
 
Example 4.1.6: Let G be a groupoid given by the following table: 
 
‚àó 
0

 Now {1}, {0}, {2}, {3} and {4} are the only proper subsets, which are semigroups. 
Clearly G is a non-commutative groupoid but G is Smarandache commutative. 
 
Example 4.1.7: Let G be a groupoid given by the following table: 
 
‚àó 0 1 2 3 
0 0 2 0 2 
1 2 0 2 0 
2 0 2 0 2 
3 2 0 2 0 
 
This groupoid G is commutative and (G, ‚àó) is a SG as the proper subset A = {0, 2} ‚äÇ 
G is a semigroup. Since G is a commutative groupoid G is a Smarandache commutative 
groupoid. 
 
In view of the above examples we have the following theorem. 
 
THEOREM 4.1.1: Let G be a commutative groupoid if G is a Smarandache groupoid then G 
is a Smarandache commutative groupoid. Conversely, if G is a Smarandache commutative 
groupoid G need not in general be a commutative groupoid.  
 
Proof: Given G is a commutative groupoid and G is a SG so every proper subset which is a 
semigroup is commutative. Hence, G is a Smarandache commutative groupoid. 
 
To prove the converse we give the following example. 
 
Consider the groupoid (G, ‚àó) given in example 4.1.6, clearly (G, ‚àó) is a non 
commutative groupoid, but (G, ‚àó) is a Smarandache commutative groupoid. Hence the claim.

commutative.

every semigroup is commutative.

PROBLEM 6: Is Z11 (3, 7) a SG? Justify your answer.  
 
PROBLEM 7: Find all semigroups in Z18 (2, 9). 
 
 
4.2 Substructures in Smarandache Groupoids  
 
In this section we extend the research to the concepts of Smarandache subgroupoids, 
Smarandache left (right) ideal, Smarandache ideal, Smarandache seminormal groupoid, 
Smarandache normal groupoid, Smarandache semiconjugate groupoid, Smarandache 
conjugate groupoid, Smarandache inner commutative groupoid and obtain some interesting 
results about them. Further, we give several examples of each definition to make the 
definition easy for understanding. 
 
DEFINITION: Let (G, ‚àó) be a Smarandache groupoid (SG). A non-empty subset H of G is said 
to be a Smarandache subgroupoid if H contains a proper subset K ‚äÇ H such that K is a 
semigroup under the operation ‚àó.  
 
THEOREM 4.2.1: Every subgroupoid of a Smarandache groupoid S need not in general be a 
Smarandache subgroupoid of S.  
 
Proof: Let S = Z6 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} set of modulo integer 6.  
 
The groupoid (S,‚àó) is given by the following table:  
 
‚àó

The only subgroupoids of S are A1 = {0, 3}, A2 = {0, 2, 4} and A3 = {1, 3, 5}. 
Clearly, A2 has no non-trivial semigroup as {0} is a trivial semigroup. Thus, A2 is a 
subgroupoid, which is not a Smarandache subgroupoid of S.  
 
Remark: Just as in a group G we call the identity element of G as a trivial subgroup, we in 
case of groupoids built using the finite integers Zn call {0} the trivial subgroupoid of Zn so 
the singleton {0} is a trivial semigroup of Zn.  
 
THEOREM 4.2.2: If a groupoid G contains a Smarandache subgroupoid then G is a SG.  
 
Proof: Let G be a groupoid. H ‚äÇ G be a Smarandache subgroupoid that is H contains a proper 
subset P ‚äÇ H such that P is a semigroup under the same operations of G. So P ‚äÇ G is a 
semigroup. Hence the claim.  
 
DEFINITION: A Smarandache left ideal A of the Smarandache groupoid G satisfies the 
following conditions:  
 
1. A is a Smarandache subgroupoid 
2. x ‚àà G and a ‚àà A then xa ‚àà A.  
 
Similarly, we can define Smarandache right ideal. If A is both a Smarandache right 
ideal and Smarandache left ideal simultaneously then we say A is a Smarandache ideal.  
 
Example 4.2.1: Let Z6 (4, 5) be a SG given by the following table: 
 
‚àó 
0 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5

Now the set A = {1, 3, 5} is a Smarandache left ideal of Z6 (4, 5) and is not a 
Smarandache right ideal; the subset {3} is a semigroup of A.  
 
Example 4.2.2: Let G = Z6 (2, 4) be the SG given by the following table:

Clearly, G is a SG as P = {0, 3} ‚äÇ  G is a semigroup under ‚àó. Now Q = {0, 2, 4} is an 
ideal of G but Q is not a Smarandache ideal of G for Q is not even a Smarandache 
subgroupoid. 
 
We take {0} as a trivial Smarandache ideal only whenever {0} happens to be an ideal 
for in every groupoid Zn, {0} is not in general an ideal of Zn as in the case of rings.  
 
So whenever {0} happens to be an ideal we can consider it as a trivial one.  
  
This example leads us to the following theorem.  
 
THEOREM 4.2.3: Let G be a groupoid. If A is a Smarandache ideal of G then A is an ideal of 
G. Conversely an ideal of G in general is not a Smarandache ideal of G even if G is a SG.  
 
Proof: By the very definition of Smarandache ideal A in a groupoid G; A will be an ideal of 
the groupoid G. To prove the converse. Consider the groupoid given in example 4.2.2. 
Clearly, it is proved in example 4.2.2. G = Z6 is a SG and Q = {0, 2, 4} is an ideal which is 
not a Smarandache ideal of G. Hence the claim.  
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a SG. V be a Smarandache subgroupoid of G. We say V is a 
Smarandache seminormal groupoid if  
 
1. aV = X for all a ‚àà G 
2. Va = Y for all a ‚àà G 
 
where either X or Y is a Smarandache subgroupoid of G but X and Y are both subgroupoids.   
 
Example 4.2.3: Let G = Z6 (4, 5) be a groupoid given in example 4.2.1. Clearly, G is a SG as 
P = {3} is a semigroup. Take A = {1, 3, 5}, A is also a Smarandache subgroupoid of G.  
 
Now aA = A is a SG and Aa = {0, 2, 4}, but, {0, 2, 4} is not a Smarandache 
subgroupoid of G. Hence A is a Smarandache seminormal groupoid of G.  
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a SG and V be a Smarandache subgroupoid of G. V is said to be a 
Smarandache normal groupoid if aV = X and Va = Y for all a ‚àà G where both X and Y are 
Smarandache subgroupoids of G.  
 
THEOREM 4.2.4: Every Smarandache normal groupoid is a Smarandache seminormal 
groupoid and not conversely.  
 
Proof: By the very definition of Smarandache normal groupoid and Smarandache 
seminormal groupoid we see every Smarandache normal groupoid is a Smarandache 
seminormal groupoid. To prove the converse we consider the groupoid given in example 
4.2.1.  
 
We have proved A = {1, 3, 5} ‚äÇ Z6 (4, 5) is a Smarandache seminormal groupoid as 
aA = A but A is not a Smarandache normal groupoid as Aa = {0, 2, 4} but {0, 2, 4} is not a 

 
 
51 
Smarandache subgroupoid of Z6 (4, 5) so A is not a Smarandache normal groupoid. Hence a 
claim.  
 
Now we will see an example of a Smarandache normal groupoid.  
 
Example 4.2.4: Let G = Z8 (2, 6) be the groupoid given by the following table:

Clearly G = Z8 (2, 6) is a SG for {0, 4} is a semigroup of G. Consider A = {0, 2, 4, 6} 
‚äÇ G, it is easily verified A is Smarandache subgroupoid. Clearly aA = A for all a ‚àà G and Aa 
= A for all a ‚àà G. Hence A is a Smarandache normal groupoid of G.  
 
Now we proceed on to see when are two subgroupoids Smarandache semiconjugate 
with each other.  
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a SG. H and P be any two subgroupoids of G. We say H and P are 
Smarandache semiconjugate subgroupoids of G if 
 
1. H and P are Smarandache subgroupoids of G 
2. H = xP or Px or 
3. P = xH or Hx for some x ‚àà G.  
 
Example 4.2.5: Let G = Z8 (2, 4) be a groupoid given in Example 4.2.4: 
  
G is a SG as S = {0, 4} is a semigroup of G. Take P = {0, 3, 2, 4, 6} clearly P is a 
Smarandache subgroupoid of G. Take Q = {0, 2, 4, 6}, Q is also a Smarandache subgroupoid 
of G. Now 7P = Q. Hence P and Q are Smarandache semiconjugate subgroupoids of G.  
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a Smarandache groupoid. H and P be subgroupoids of G. We say H 
and P are Smarandache conjugate subgroupoids of G if  
 
1. H and P are Smarandache subgroupoids of G 
2. H = xP or Px and  
3. P = xH or Hx. 
 
Remark: If one of H = xP (or Px) or P = xH (or Hx) occurs it is Smarandache semiconjugate 
but for it to be Smarandache conjugate we need both H = xP (or Px) and P = xH (or Hx) 
should occur.

G is a SG as the set S = {0, 6} is a semigroup of G. A1 = {0, 3, 6, 9} and A2 = {2, 5, 
8, 11} are two Smarandache subgroupoids of G for P1 = {0, 6} ‚äÇ A1 and P2 = {8} ‚äÇ A2 
where P1 and P2 semigroups of A1 and A2 respectively.  
 
Now A1  = 3A2 = 3 {2, 5, 8, 11}= {0, 3, 6, 9}.  Further A2 = 2A1 = 2 {0, 3, 6, 9} = {2, 
5, 8, 11}. Hence, A1 and A2 are Smarandache conjugate subgroupoids of G.  
 
THEOREM 4.2.5: Let G be a SG. If P and K be any two Smarandache subgroupoids of G 
which are Smarandache conjugate then they are Smarandache semiconjugate. But 
Smarandache semiconjugate subgroupoids need not in general be Smarandache conjugate 
subgroupoids of G.  
 
Proof: By the very definition of Smarandache semiconjugate subgroupoids and Smarandache 
conjugate subgroupoids we see every Smarandache conjugate subgroupoid is Smarandache 
semiconjugate subgroupoid. It is left for the reader as an exercise to construct an example of 
a Smarandache semiconjugate subgroupoids, which are not Smarandache conjugate 
subgroupoids.  
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a SG we say G is a Smarandache inner commutative groupoid if 
every semigroup contained in every Smarandache subgroupoid of G is commutative.  
 
Example 4.2.7: Let G be the groupoid given by the following table:

Clearly, G is a SG as S = {1} and P = {2} are proper subsets of G which are 
semigroups under the operation ‚àó. Now A1 = {0, 2} and A2 = {1, 3} are subgroupoids of G. 

 
 
53 
In fact A1 and A2 are Smarandache subgroupoids of G but A1 and A2 are not commutative 
subgroupoids, but G is Smarandache inner commutative as the semigroups contained in them 
are commutative.  
 
Example 4.2.8: Let G = Z5 (3, 3) be a groupoid given by the following table:   
 
‚àó 0 1 2 3 4 
0 0 3 1 4 2 
1 3 1 4 2 0 
2 1 4 2 0 3 
3 4 2 0 3 1 
4 2 0 3 1 4 
 
G is a commutative groupoid. G is a SG as {1}, {2}, {3} and {4} are subsets which 
are semigroups.  So G is a Smarandache inner commutative groupoid.  
 
Example 4.2.9: Let G be the groupoid given by the following table:  
 
‚àó a b c d 
a 
a 
c 
a 
c 
b a 
c 
a 
c 
c 
a 
c 
a 
c 
d a 
c 
a 
c 
 
G is both non-commutative and non-associative for a ‚àó b ‚â†    b ‚àó a as a ‚àó b = c and b ‚àó 
a = a also a ‚àó (b ‚àó d) ‚â† (a ‚àó b) ‚àó d. For a ‚àó (b ‚àó d) = a and (a ‚àó b) ‚àó d = c.  
 
G is a SG as P = {a, c} ‚äÇ G is a semigroup under the operation ‚àó. This groupoid has 
subgroupoids, which are non-commutative, but G is a inner commutative groupoid.  
 
THEOREM 4.2.6: Every Smarandache commutative groupoid is a Smarandache inner 
commutative groupoid and not conversely.  
 
Proof: By the very definitions of Smarandache inner commutative and Smarandache 
commutative we see every Smarandache inner commutative groupoid is a Smarandache 
commutative groupoid.  
 
To prove the converse we construct the following example.  
 
Let Z2 = {0, 1} be the prime field of characteristic 2. Consider the set of all 2 √ó 2 
matrices with entries from the field Z2 = {0, 1} and denote it by M2√ó2.  
 
M2√ó2 contains exactly 16 elements. By defining a non-associative and non-
commutative operation ‚ÄòŒø‚Äô we make M2√ó2 a Smarandache commutative groupoid which is not 
a Smarandache inner-commutative groupoid.   
 
 
The proof is as follows:

4.3 Identities in Smarandache Groupoids  
 
In this section we introduce some identities in SGs called Bol identity and Moufang 
identity, P-identity and alternative identity and illustrate them with examples.  
 
DEFINITION: A SG (G, ‚àó) is said to be a Smarandache Moufang groupoid if there exist H ‚äÇ 
G such that H is a Smarandache subgroupoid satisfying the Moufang identity (xy)(zx) = (x 
(yz)) x for all x, y, z in H.  
 
DEFINITION: Let S be a SG. If every Smarandache subgroupoid H of S satisfies the Moufang 
identity for all x, y, z in H then S is a Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid.  
 
Example 4.3.1: Let G = Z10 (5, 6) be a groupoid given by the following table:

Clearly, Z10 (5, 6) is a SG as S = {2} is a semi-group. It can be verified Z10 (5, 6) is a 
Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid as the Moufang identity (x ‚àó y) ‚àó (z ‚àó x) = [x ‚àó (y ‚àó 
z)] ‚àó x is true for  
 
(x ‚àó y) ‚àó (z ‚àó x)  
= 
(5x + 6y) ‚àó (5z + 6x)  
= 
5(5x + 6y) + 6(5z + 6x)  
= 
x. 
 
Now  [x ‚àó (y ‚àó z)] ‚àó x  
= 
(x ‚àó [5y + 6z]) ‚àó x 
 
 
 
= 
[5x + 6(5y + 6z)] ‚àó x 
 
 
 
= 
(5x + 6z) ‚àó x 
 
 
 
= 
5(5x + 6z) + 6x 

 
 
57 
 
 
 
=  
5x + 6x 
 
 
 
= 
x. 
 
Since x, y, z are arbitrary elements from Z10 (5,6) we have this groupoid to be a 
Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid. Since every Smarandache, subgroupoid of G will 
also satisfy the Moufang identity.  
 
In view of this example, we give the following nice theorem. 
 
THEOREM 4.3.1: Let S be a SG if the Moufang identity (x ‚àó y) ‚àó (z ‚àó x) = (x ‚àó (y ‚àó z)) ‚àó x is 
true for all x, y, z ‚àà S then S is a Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid. 
 
Proof: If (x ‚àó y) ‚àó (z ‚àó x) = (x ‚àó (y ‚àó z)) ‚àó x for all x, y, z ‚àà S then clearly we see every 
Smarandache subgroupoid of S satisfies the Moufang identity hence S is a Smarandache 
strong Moufang groupoid. 
 
Now we see an example of a groupoid, which is only a Smarandache Moufang 
groupoid, and not a Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid.  
 
Example 4.3.2: Let G = Z12 (3, 9) be a groupoid given by the following table:

Clearly, A1 = {0, 4, 8} and A2 = {0, 3, 6, 9} are Smarandache subgroupoids of G as 
P1 = {0, 4} ‚äÇ A1 is a semigroup and P2 = {0, 6} ‚äÇ A2 is a semigroup of G. A2 does not satisfy 
Moufang identity but A1 satisfies the Moufang identity. So G is only a Smarandache 
Moufang groupoid but not a Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid.  
 
THEOREM 4.3.2: Every Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid is a Smarandache Moufang 
groupoid and not conversely.  
 
Proof: By the very definition of the Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid and the 
Smarandache Moufang groupoid it is clear that every Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid 
is a Smarandache Moufang groupoid.  
 

 
 
58 
To prove the converse, consider the example 4.3.2 clearly that groupoid is proved to 
be Smarandache Moufang groupoid but it is not Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid for 
x, y, z ‚àà Z12 (3, 9) we see (x ‚àó y) ‚àó (z ‚àó x) ‚â† (x ‚àó (y ‚àó z)) ‚àó x for  
 
(x ‚àó y) ‚àó (z ‚àó x)  
 
= 
 6x + 3y + 3z (mod 12) 
 
Now (x ‚àó (y ‚àó z)) ‚àó x  
= 
6x + 9y + 3z (mod 12). 
 
Thus, Z12 (3, 9) satisfies the Moufang identity for the subgroupoid {0, 6}.

This groupoid is a SG as it contains semigroups viz. {2}, {4} and {10}. Now Z12 (3, 
4) is a Smarandache strong Bol groupoid for ((x ‚àó y) ‚àó z) ‚àó y = x ‚àó [(y ‚àó z) ‚àó y] for all x, y, z 
‚àà Z12 (3, 4).  
 
Consider, 
((x ‚àó y) ‚àóz) ‚àó y = 
[(3x + 4y) ‚àó z] ‚àó y 
 
 
 
= 
[9x + 12y + 4z] ‚àó y 
 
 
 
= 
[9x + 4z] ‚àó y 
 
 
 
= 
27x + 12z + 4y 
 
 
 
= 
3x + 4y. 
 
Now 
     
 
x ‚àó [(y ‚àó z) ‚àó y]  
= 
x ‚àó [(3y + 4z) ‚àó y] 
 
 
 
 
 
= 
x ‚àó [9y + 12z + 4y] 
 
 
 
 
 
= 
x ‚àó y 
 
 
 
 
 
= 
3x + 4y. 
 
Thus Z12 (3, 4) is a Smarandache strong Bol groupoid as every triple satisfies the Bol 
identity so every subgroupoid of Z12 (3, 4) which is a Smarandache subgroupoid of G will 
satisfy the Bol identity.

DEFINITION: Let G be a groupoid, G is said to be a Smarandache Bol groupoid if G has a 
subgroupoid H of G such that H is a Smarandache subgroupoid and satisfies the Bol identity:  
 
((x ‚àó y) ‚àó z) ‚àó y = x ‚àó ((y ‚àó z) ‚àó y) for all x, y, z ‚àà H.  
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a groupoid, G is said to be a Smarandache strong Bol groupoid if 
every Smarandache subgroupoid of G satisfies the Bol identity.  
 
THEOREM 4.3.3: Let G be a SG if every triple satisfies the Bol identity then G is a 
Smarandache strong Bol groupoid. 
 
Proof: If ((x ‚àó y) ‚àó z) ‚àó y = x ‚àó ((y ‚àó z) ‚àó y) for all x, y, z ‚àà G then we see G is a 
Smarandache strong Bol groupoid as every Smarandache subgroupoid of G will satisfy the 
Bol identity. 
 
Now we give an example of a Smarandache Bol groupoid S. 
 
Example 4.3.4: Let Z4 (2, 3) be the groupoid given by the following table:  
 
‚àó 0 1 2 3 
0 0 3 2 1 
1 2 1 0 3 
2 0 3 2 1 
3 2 1 0 3 
 
Clearly, Z4 (2, 3) is a SG as the set {2} ‚äÇ Z4 (2, 3) is a semigroup. Now A = {0, 2} is 
a Smarandache subgroupoid of Z4 (2, 3). In fact A = {0, 2} satisfies the Bol identity (left for 
the reader to verify). But Z4 (2, 3) does not satisfy Bol identity for all x, y, z ‚àà Z4 (2,3).  For 
((x ‚àó y) ‚àó z) ‚àó y ‚â† x ‚àó [(y ‚àó z) ‚àó y],  
 
 
 
 
Consider  
 
((x ‚àó y) ‚àó z) ‚àó y  
= 
[(2x + 3y) ‚àó z] ‚àó y 
 
 
 
= 
(4x + 6y + 3z) ‚àó y 
= 
(2y + 3z) ‚àó y 
 
 
 
= 
4x + 6z + 3y 
 
 
 
 
= 
2z + 3y. 
 
Now  x ‚àó [(y ‚àó z) ‚àó y]  
= 
x ‚àó [(2y + 3z) ‚àó y] 
 
 
 
= 
x ‚àó [4y + 6z + 3y] 
 
 
 
= 
x ‚àó [2z + 3y] 
 
 
 
= 
2x + 6z + 9y 
 
 
 
= 
2x + 2z + y. 
 
Clearly 2z + 3y ‚â† 2x + 2z + y for all choices of x, y and z. So Z4 (2,3) is not a 
Smarandache strong Bol groupoid. 
 

 
 
60 
It is only a Smarandache Bol groupoid. In view of these examples, we have a nice 
theorem.  
 
THEOREM 4.3.4: Every Smarandache strong Bol groupoid is a Smarandache Bol groupoid 
and not conversely.  
 
Proof: Now by the very definition of Smarandache strong Bol groupoid and Smarandache 
Bol groupoid we see every Smarandache strong Bol groupoid is a Smarandache Bol 
groupoid.  
 
To prove the converse, consider the groupoid Z4 (2, 3) given in example 4.3.4. It is 
not a Smarandache strong Bol groupoid but it is clearly a Smarandache Bol groupoid. Hence 
the claim.  
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache P- groupoids.  
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a SG. G is said to be a Smarandache P ‚Äì groupoid if G contains a 
proper subset H ‚äÇ G where H is a Smarandache subgroupoid of G and satisfies the identity 
(x ‚àó y) ‚àó x = x ‚àó (y ‚àó x) for all x, y ‚àà H.  
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a SG. G is said to be a Smarandache strong P-groupoid if every 
Smarandache subgroupoid of G is a Smarandache P-groupoid of G.  
 
We illustrate this by the following example. 
 
Example 4.3.5: Consider the groupoid Z6 (4, 3) given by the following table:  
 
‚àó 
0 
1 
2 
3 
4

Clearly Z6 (4, 3) is a SG as every singleton set i.e. {2}, {1}, {3}, {4} are subsets 
which are semigroups of Z6 (4, 3). Now Z6 (4, 3) is a Smarandache strong P-groupoid for (x ‚àó 
y) ‚àó x = x ‚àó (y ‚àó x) for all x, y ‚àà Z6 (4, 3).  
 
Consider  
(x ‚àó y) ‚àó x  
 
=  
(4x + 3y) ‚àó x 
 
 
 
 
 
= 
16x  + 12y + 5x 
 
 
 
 
 
= 
x. 
 
Now   
x ‚àó (y ‚àó x)  
 
= 
x ‚àó [4y + 3x] 
 
 
 
= 
4x + 12y + 9x 
 
 
 
= 
x. 
 
This is true for all x, y ‚àà Z6 (4, 3). Hence, Z6 (4, 3) is a Smarandache strong P-groupoid.  

 
 
61 
 
Example 4.3.6: Consider the groupoid Z4 (2, 3) given by the following table:  
 
‚àó 0 1 2 3 
0 0 3 2 1 
1 2 1 0 3 
2 0 3 2 1 
3 2 1 0 3 
 
Clearly, Z4 (2, 3) is a SG as {2} and {3} are semigroups. Now is Z4 (2, 3) a 
Smarandache strong P-groupoid? That is; Is (x‚àó y) ‚àó x = x ‚àó (y ‚àó x)?  
 
Consider (x ‚àó y) ‚àó x  
 
= 
 [2x + 3y] ‚àó x   
 
 
 
 
= 
4x + 6y + 3x 
 
 
 
 
= 
2y + 3x. 
 
Now x ‚àó [y ‚àó x] 
 
= 
x ‚àó [2y + 3x] 
 
 
 
 
= 
2x + 6y + 9x 
 
 
 
 
= 
3x + 2y. 
 
Thus, Z4 (2, 3) is a Smarandache strong P-groupoid.  
 
Example 4.3.7: Consider the groupoid Z6 (3, 5) given by the following table:  
 
‚àó 0 1 2 3 4 5 
0 0 5 4 3 2 1 
1 3 2 1 0 5 4 
2 0 5 4 3 2 1 
3 3 2 1 0 5 4 
4 0 5 4 3 2 1 
5 3 2 1 0 5 4 
 
Now Z6 (3, 5) is a SG as A = {0, 3} is a semigroup of Z6 (3, 5). The only 
Smarandache subgroupoid of Z6 (3,5) is A = {0, 3} and A satisfies P-groupoid identity.  
 
Hence Z6 (3, 5) is a Smarandache strong P-groupoid but not all elements of Z6(3, 5)  
satisfy P-groupoid identity.  
 
This example leads us to the following theorem. 
 
THEOREM 4.3.5: Let G be a SG. If G is a Smarandache strong P-groupoid then every pair in 
G need not satisfy the P-groupoid identity. 
 
Proof: We prove this only by an example. Clearly the groupoid in example 4.3.7 is a 
Smarandache strong P-groupoid but it can be verified that every pair in G does not satisfy the 
P-groupoid identity. 
 

 
 
62 
THEOREM 4.3.6: Every Smarandache strong P-groupoid is a Smarandache P-groupoid but 
not conversely.  
 
Proof: By the very definition of Smarandache strong P-groupoid and Smarandache P-
groupoid we see every Smarandache strong P-groupoid is a Smarandache P-groupoid. To 
prove the converse, consider the example. Consider the groupoid Z12 (5, 10) given by the 
following table:

Now {6} is a semigroup and A = {0, 6} is a Smarandache subgroupoid and the 
elements in A satisfy the identity (x ‚àó  y)  ‚àó x = x ‚àó (y  ‚àó x). 
 
For (x ‚àó y) ‚àó x  
 
= 
(5x + 10y) ‚àó x 
 
 
 
 
= 
25x + 50y + 10x 
 
 
 
 
=  
11x + 2y. 
 
Now x ‚àó (y ‚àó x) 
 
= 
x ‚àó [5y + 10x] 
 
 
 
 
= 
5x + 50y + 100x 
 
 
 
 
= 
9x + 2y. 
 
Now the set {0, 6} satisfies the identity. Thus Z12 (5, 10) is only a Smarandache P-
groupoid and it is not a Smarandache strong P-groupoid.  
 
Now we proceed on to define right (left) alternative identities in SGs.  
 
DEFINITION: Let G be a SG, G is said to be a Smarandache right alternative groupoid if a 
proper subset H of G where H is a Smarandache subgroupoid of G satisfies the right 
alternative identity; (xy) y = x (yy) for all x, y ‚àà H.  
 
On similar lines we define Smarandache left alternative groupoid if it satisfies the left 
alternative identity that is (xx) y = x (xy) for all x, y ‚àà H. A SG,  G is said to be Smarandache 
alternative groupoid if a proper subset H of G which is a Smarandache subgroupoid, 
simultaneously satisfies both the right and left alternative identities.  
 

 
 
63 
DEFINITION: Let G be SG if every Smarandache subgroupoid of G satisfies the right 
alternative identity, we call G a Smarandache strong right alternative groupoid. Similarly, 
Smarandache strong left alternative groupoid is defined. 
 
G is said to be Smarandache strong alternative groupoid if every Smarandache 
subgroupoid of G satisfies both the right and left alternative identities simultaneously.  
 
We illustrate this by the following example:

Clearly, Z14  (7, 8) is a SG as {4} is a semigroup.  
 
 
Now the subgroupoids of Z14 (7, 8) are  
 
 
 
 
 
 
All these subgroupoids are Smarandache subgroupoids. This groupoid is both right 
alternative and left alternative. Further Z14 (7, 8) is a Smarandache strong alternative 
groupoid.  
 
Now we give an example of a Smarandache alternative groupoid, which is a 
Smarandache strong alternative groupoid where only SG satisfies the identity but all pairs do 
not satisfy the alternative identity.  
 
Example 4.3.9: Let Z12 (1,6) be a groupoid given by the following table:

Now Z12 (16) is a SG as the singleton sets {2}, {4} and {8} are semigroups. Now A = 
(10, 4) is the Smarandache subgroupoid given by the table:  
 
‚àó 
4 
10 
4 
4 
4 
10 10 10 
 
Now it is left for the reader to verify that both the right and left alternative identities 
are satisfied by A, but not by all elements of G. Hence, Z12 (1,6) is a Smarandache alternative 
groupoid which is evident from the fact the subgroupoid A2 = {1, 7} does not satisfy the 
alternative identities. Thus two examples give no doubt only a Smarandache strong groupoid 
but are formulated differently.  
 
THEOREM 4.3.7: Every Smarandache strong alternative groupoid is a Smarandache 
alternative groupoid and not conversely.  
 
Proof: Clearly, by the very definitions we see every Smarandache strong alternative groupoid 
is a Smarandache alternative groupoid. To prove the converse we give an example. 
 
From example 4.3.9 Z12 (1, 6) is only a Smarandache alternative groupoid, which is 
not a Smarandache strong alternative groupoid. 
 
 
PROBLEM 1: Give an example of a SG of order 10, which is a Smarandache Moufang 
groupoid.

PROBLEM 3: Check whether Z13 (3, 9) is a Smarandache alternative groupoid.  
 
PROBLEM 4: Is Z7 (3, 4) a Smarandache P-groupoid? 
 
PROBLEM 5: Can Z8 (5, 3) be a Smarandache Bol groupoid? 

 
 
65 
 
PROBLEM 6: Can a groupoid satisfy Bol identity, Moufang identity simultaneously? (or) Can 
a groupoid be both Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid and Smarandache strong Bol 
groupoid? Illustrate them by example. 
 
PROBLEM 7: Is Z30 (7, 3) a Smarandache strong alternative groupoid? 
 
PROBLEM 8: Give an example of a Smarandache strong alternative groupoid, which is not a 
Smarandache strong P-groupoid. 
 
PROBLEM 9: Find a Smarandache strong Bol groupoid G in which only every Smarandache 
subgroupoid satisfies the Bol identity but every triple in G does not satisfy the Bol identity.  
 
PROBLEM 10: Give an example of a Smarandache Moufang groupoid, which is not a 
Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid.  
 
PROBLEM 11: Give an example of Smarandache Bol groupoid, which is not a Smarandache 
strong Bol groupoid.

4.4 More Properties on Smarandache Groupoids 
 
In this section we introduce more properties about SGs like Smarandache direct 
product of groupoids, Smarandache homomorphism of groupoids and give some examples of 
them.  
 
DEFINITION: Let G1, G2, ‚Ä¶ , Gn be n-groupoids. We say G = G1 √ó G2 √ó ‚Ä¶ √ó Gn is a 
Smarandache direct product of groupoids if G has a proper subset H of G which is a 
semigroup under the operations of G. It is important to note that each Gi need not be a SG 

 
 
66 
for in that case G will obviously be a SG. Here we take any set of groupoids and find their 
direct product.  
 
Example 4.4.1: Let G1 = Z12 (8, 4) and G2 = Z4 (2, 3) be two groupoids. Now G = G1 √ó G2 is 
a direct product. It is left for the reader to verify G is a Smarandache direct product.  
 
Example 4.4.2: Let G = G1 √ó G1 √ó G1 where G1 = Z12 (8, 4). Prove G is a Smarandache 
direct product.  
 
DEFINITION: Let (G, ‚àó) and (G', o) be any two SGs. A map œÜ from (G, ‚àó) to (G', o) is said to 
be a SG homomorphism if œÜ : A ‚Üí A' is a semigroup homomorphism where A ‚äÇ G and A' ‚äÇ 
G' are semigroups of G and G' respectively. We have œÜ (a ‚àó b) = œÜ (a) o œÜ(b) for all a, b ‚àà A. 
We say a SG homomorphism is a SG isomorphism if œÜ restricted to the semigroups is a 
semigroup isomorphism. 
 
Remark 1: If G and G' be two SGs which are isomorphic we need not have |G| = |G'|.  
 
Remark 2: Two SGs may be homomorphic for some semigroups in them and be isomorphic 
for some other set of semigroups. Yet, these SGs become isomorphic.  
 
Example 4.4.3: Let Z4 (2, 3) and Z6 (4, 5) be two given SGs given by the following tables:  
 
Table for Z4 (2, 3) 
‚àó 0 1 2 3 
0 0 3 2 1 
1 2 1 0 3 
2 0 3 2 1 
3 2 1 0 3 
 
Clearly, A = {3} ‚äÇ Z4 (2,3) is a SG. The table for groupoid Z6 (4, 5) is given below. 
 
‚àó 0 1 2 3 4 5 
0 0 5 4 3 2 1 
1 4 3 2 1 0 5 
2 2 1 0 5 4 3 
3 0 5 4 3 2 1 
4 4 3 2 1 0 5 
5 2 1 0 5 4 3 
 
Clearly, A' = {3} ‚äÇ Z6 (4, 5) is a SG. We see Z6 (4, 5) ‚âÖ Z4 (2, 3) under œÜ which maps 
3 to 3. Though the groupoids are of order 4 and 6 yet they are Smarandache isomorphic. 
 
 
PROBLEM 1: Give an example of a direct product of groupoids, which is not a Smarandache 
direct product. 
 
PROBLEM 2: Can Z7 (3, 4) be SG isomorphic with Z11 (3, 4)? Justify your answer.  

 
 
67 
 
PROBLEM 3: Can Z13 (3, 2) be SG isomorphic with Z13 (6, 3)? 
 
PROBLEM 4: Give a SG homomorphism between Z19 (3, 7) and Z19 (3, 6).  
 
PROBLEM 5: Is Zn (t, u) SG isomorphic with Zn(u, t)? 
 
PROBLEM 6: Find conditions on t and u in problem 5 so that for all n, Zn (t, u) is SG 
isomorphic with Zn (u, t).  
 
PROBLEM 7: Let G = Z3 (1, 2) √ó Z7 (3, 4) √ó Z11 (4, 5). Prove G is a Smarandache direct 
product. Find all the semigroups of G.  
 
PROBLEM 8: Does there exist a SG isomorphism between Z8 (4,6) and Z9 (3,6)? 
 
PROBLEM 9: Construct a SG homomorphism between Z6 (2, 3) and Z12 (2, 3).  
 
 
4.5 Smarandache Groupoids with Identity 
 
 
 
In this section we introduce finite SGs with identity and leave it as an open problem 
in chapter seven of finding infinite SGs with identity. When we say SGs with identity we 
only mean the identity should simultaneously be both left and right identity. 
 
Example 4.5.1: The groupoid (G, ‚àó) given by the following table is a SG.  
 
‚àó 
e 
a0 
a1 
a2 
a3 
a4 
e

a4

(G, ‚àó) is a SG with identity e. Every pair {e, ai}; i = 1, 2, 3, 4 are semigroups in G. 
Now consider the following two groupoids built using the set G = {e, a0, a1, a2, a3, a4}. 
 
Example 4.5.2: Consider the groupoid {G, Œø} given by the following table: 
 
Œø 
e 
a0 
a1 
a2 
a3 
a4 
e 
e

a3

a0 
a4 
e 
a2 
a4 
a4 
a3 
a2 
a1 
a0 
e 
 

 
 
68 
Clearly, this is a SG with identity 'e' and every pair {ai, e} for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 are 
semigroups. It is still interesting to see that (G, Œø) is a loop. Now using the same set G we 
define ‚àó on G as follows. 
 
Example 4.5.3: The groupoid (G, ‚àó) is given by the following table: 
 
‚àó 
e 
a0 
a1 
a2 
a3 
a4 
e 
e

a2 
a3 
e 
a0 
a4 
a4

a4 
a0 
a1 
e 
 
 
This is also a SG with identity but this is not a loop. Thus we can get SGs with 
identity only by adjoining ' e ' with them; some SGs with identity happens to be loops. Here 
we ask the reader to find examples of SGs of infinite order using the set of positive integers 
Z+. Clearly any operation ‚àó on Z+ such that a ‚àó b = ta + ub where t and u are distinct elements 
of Z+ does not make (Z+, ‚àó) into a SG for we are not in a position to find a proper subset 
which is a semigroup. Thus finding SGs of infinite order seems to be a very difficult task. 
Hence we have proposed open problems in Chapter 7 about SGs of infinite order.  
 
 
PROBLEM 1: How many SGs with identity of order three and four exist? 
 
PROBLEM 2: Give an example of a SG with identity of order 7. 
 
PROBLEM 3: Give an example of a SG of order 5, which is non commutative. 
 
PROBLEM 4: Find an example of a SG of order 6, which is commutative. 
 
PROBLEM 5: Prove if G = Z+ ‚à™{0} or Q+ ‚à™ {0} or R+ ‚à™ {0} is a SG with operation ' ‚Äì ' 
difference.

CHAPTER FIVE 
		
 
In this chapter we introduce conditions for the 4 new classes of groupoids Z (n), 
Z‚àó(n), Z‚àó‚àó(n) and Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) built using the modulo integers Zn to be SGs. All groupoids in these 
classes need not in general be SGs. We obtain conditions on n and on the pair t, u for the 
groupoid Zn (t, u) to be a SG. Many interesting results for the SGs built using Zn to be Bol, 
Moufang, alternative etc. are obtained. 
 
 
5.1. Smarandache Groupoids in Z (n) 
 
In this section, we completely devote our study on SGs from the class of groupoids Z 
(n) defined in chapter 3. We prove only those groupoids in Z (n) which have proper subsets 
that are semigroups will be SGs, other groupoids will not be SGs. We start with an example 
of a SG in Z (n). 
 
Example 5.1.1: Let Z7 (5, 3) ‚àà Z (7) be the groupoid given by the following table:

This is a SG as {1}, {2}, {4}, {3}, {5} and {6} are subsets of Z7 (5, 3) which are 
semigroups. 
 
Example 5.1.2: Consider the groupoid Z4 (3, 2) ‚àà Z (4) given by the following table:

This groupoid is also a SG as {1}, {2} and {3} are semigroups under ‚àó.  
 
These examples leads us to the following interesting theorem. 
 
THEOREM 5.1.1: Let Zn (t, u) be a groupoid in Z (n), n > 5. Zn (t, u) is a SG if (t, u) = 1 and t 
‚â† u and t + u ‚â° 1 (mod n). 
 
Proof: Given Zn (t, u) is a groupoid from the class Z (n) such that t + u ‚â° 1 (mod n). To show 
Zn (t, u) has semigroups consider for any m ‚àà Zn \ {0}, m ‚àó m ‚â° mt + mu (mod n) = m (t + u) 
as (t + u) ‚â° 1 (mod n) we have m ‚àó m = m thus we have {m} to be a semigroup.  
 
This is true for all m ‚àà Zn. Hence Zn (t, u) is a Smarandache semigroup if t + u ‚â° 1 
(mod n).  
 
Now we are interested in finding when Zn (t, u) ‚àà Z (n) is not a SG. 
 
Example 5.1.3: Let Z5 (1, 3) ‚àà Z (5) be given by the following table: 
 
‚àó

This is not a SG as it has no proper subset, which are semigroups under the operation 
‚àó.

 This groupoid has only subgroupoids {0, 3, 6} and {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8} but Z9 (5, 3) has 
no proper subsets which are semigroups. Thus, Z9 (5, 3) is not a SG.

This is a SG as {5} ‚äÇ Z10 (1, 2) is a semigroup.  
 
All these examples leads to the following theorem and some interesting open 
problems. 
 
THEOREM 5.1.2: Let Z2p (1, 2) ‚àà Z (2p) be a groupoid (p is an odd prime). Then Z2p (1, 2) is 
a SG. 
 
Proof: Now to show Z2p (1, 2) is a SG we have to obtain a proper subset in Z2p, which is a 
semigroup. 
 
Now take p ‚àà Z2p p ‚àó p ‚â° p + 2p (mod 2p) ‚â° p (mod 2p). Thus, {p} is a semigroup so 
Z2p (1, 2) is a SG. 
 
COROLLARY 5.1.3: Let Z3p (1, 3) be a groupoid in Z (3p) (p ‚â† 3 and p is a prime). Then Z3p 
(1, 3) is a SG. 
 
Proof: Consider the subset p ‚àà Z3p (1, 3); p ‚àó p = p + 3p ‚â° p (mod 3p). Clearly, {p} is a 
proper subset, which is a semigroup; hence, Z3p(1, 3) is a SG of order 3p. 
 
COROLLARY 5.1.4: Let  (1, p2) and 
2
1p
p
Z
 (1, p1) be groupoids in Z(p1p2) where p1 and p2 
are two distinct prime. Then 
2
1p
p
Z
 (1, p2) and 
2
1p
p
Z
 (1, p1) are SGs. 
 
Proof: Take p1 ‚àà 
2
1p
p
Z
(1, p2). Now p1 ‚àó p1 ‚â° p1 + p1p2 (mod p1p2) ‚â° p1 (mod p1p2). So the set 
{p1} is a semigroup. Hence 
2
1p
p
Z
 (1, p2) is a SG. Similarly 
2
1p
p
Z
 (1, p1) is a SG as p2 ‚àà 
2
1p
p
Z
 is such that p2 ‚àó p2 ‚â° p2 + p1p2 (mod p1p2) ‚â° p2 (mod p1p2). So {p2} is a semigroup and 
2
1p
p
Z
 (1, p1) is a SG. 
 
COROLLARY 5.1.5: Let Zn (1, p) be a groupoid in Z (n) where p is a prime and p / n. Then Zn 
(1, p) is a SG. 
 
Proof: Let n / p = m where n = mp. Now m ‚àà Zn and m ‚àó m ‚â° m + pm (mod n = pm) ‚â° m 
(mod n). Thus, the singleton set {m} is a proper subset, which is a semigroup. Hence Zn (1, p) 
is a SG. This result leads to the following interesting theorem. 
 
THEOREM 5.1.6: The class of groupoids Z (n) has SGs for all n >3 and n ‚â† 5. 
 
Proof: Given Zn = {0, 1, 2, ... , n ‚Äì1}; n > 3 and n ‚â† 5. 
 
Zn (t, u) with t ‚â† u, (t, u) = 1 t, u ‚àà Zn \ {0}. Now for n = 4. Z4(1, 2) ‚àà Z (4), is a SG 
as {2} is a semigroup, so Z4(1, 2) is a SG. Now for n = 5 we do not have any SG, this is left 
for the reader to verify. When n ‚â• 6 we see Z (n) has SGs under two possibilities: 
 
1. When we chose t + u ‚â° 1 (mod n) then Zn (t, u) is a SG. 

 
 
73 
 
2. Similarly when n is non prime that is a composite number and if p / n then Zn (1. 
p) is a SG.  
 
Thus the class of groupoids Z (n) when n > 3 and n ‚â† 5 has SGs. 
 
Note: When n = 3 it is left for the reader to verify Z (3) has no SGs. 
 
THEOREM 5.1.7: The SG Zn (t, u) ‚àà Z (n) with t + u ‚â° 1 (mod n) is a Smarandache 
idempotent groupoid. 
 
Proof: Clearly x ‚àó x = x for all x ‚àà Zn as x ‚àó x = tx + ux ‚â° (t + u) x (mod n) as t + u ‚â° 1 (mod 
n) we have x * x = x in Zn. Hence the claim.  
 
THEOREM 5.1.8: The SG Zn (t, u) ‚àà Z (n) with t + u ‚â° 1(mod n) is a Smarandache P-
groupoid if and only if t2 ‚â° t (mod n) and u2 ‚â° u (mod n). 
 
Proof: Clearly we have proved if t + u ‚â° 1 (mod n), then Zn (t, u) is a SG in Z(n). To show Zn 
(t, u) is a Smarandache P-groupoid we have to prove (x ‚àó y) ‚àó x = x ‚àó (y ‚àó x) for all x, y ‚àà 
Zn(t,u). Now to show Zn (t, u) to be SG we have to prove (x ‚àó y) ‚àó x = x ‚àó (y ‚àó x).  
 
Consider (x ‚àó y) ‚àó x = (tx + uy) ‚àó x = t2x + tuy + ux. Now x ‚àó (y ‚àó x) = x ‚àó (ty + ux) = 
tx + tuy + u2x. Now t2x + tuy + ux = tx + tuy + u2x if and only if t2 ‚â° t (mod n) and u2 ‚â° u 
(mod n). 
 
Example 5.1.8: Let Z12 (4, 9) ‚àà Z (12). Clearly, Z12 (4, 9) is a SG, which is also a 
Smarandache P-groupoid by theorem 5.1.8. Z12 (4, 9) is defined by x ‚àó y = 4x + 9y (mod 12). 
It is left for the reader to prove Z12 (4, 9) is a Smarandache P-groupoid. 
 
THEOREM 5.1.9: The groupoid Zn (t, u) ‚àà Z (n) with t + u ‚â° 1 (mod n) is a Smarandache 
alternative groupoid if and only if t2 ‚â° t (mod n) and u2 ‚â° u (mod n). 
 
Proof: Zn (t, u) when t + u ‚â° 1 (mod n) is a SG. Clearly, (x ‚àó y) ‚àó y = x ‚àó (y ‚àó y) and (x ‚àó x) ‚àó 
y = x ‚àó (x ‚àó y) if and only if t2 ‚â° t (mod n) and u2 ‚â° u (mod n). Thus, we see from this theorem 
example 5.1.8 the groupoid Z12 (4, 9) is also a Smarandache alternative groupoid. 
 
THEOREM 5.1.10: The groupoid Zn (t, u) ‚àà Z (n) with t + u ‚â°1 (mod n) is a SG. This 
groupoid is a Smarandache strong Bol groupoid if and only if t3 ‚â° t (mod n) and u2 ‚â° u (mod 
n). 
 
Proof: We know Zn (t, u) ‚àà Z (n) is a SG when t + u ‚â° 1 (mod n). This groupoid is a 
Smarandache strong Bol groupoid if and only if t3 ‚â° t (mod n) and u2 ‚â° u (mod n). It essential 
to prove ((x * y) * z) * x = x * ((y * z) * x) for all x, y, z ‚àà Zm (t, u). 
 
((x * y) * z) * x  
= 
[(tx + uy) * z] * x 
 
= 
(t2x + tuy + uz) * x 
 
 
  
= 
t3x + t2uy + tuz + ux. 

 
 
74 
 
Now, x * ((y * z) * x)  =  
x * [(ty + uz) * x] 
           =  
x * [t2y + tuz + ux] 
           =  
tx + t2uy + tu2z + u2x. 
 
((x * y) * z) * x ‚â° x * ((y * z) * x) (mod n) if and only if t3 ‚â° t (mod n) and u2 ‚â° u 
(mod n). Hence the claim. 
 
Example 5.1.9: Let Z6 (3, 4) ‚àà Z (6) be the SG given by the following table: 
 
‚àó 
0 
1 
2 
3

This groupoid is a Smarandache strong Bol groupoid as 43 ‚â° 4(mod 6) and 32 ‚â° 3(mod 6), 
which is the condition for a groupoid in Z (n) to be a Smarandache strong Bol groupoid. 
 
THEOREM 5.1.11: Let Zn (t, u) ‚àà Z (n) with t + u ‚â° 1 (mod n) be a SG. Zn (t, u) is a 
Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid if and only if t2 ‚â° t (mod n) and u2 ‚â° u (mod n). 
 
Proof: The Moufang identity is (x ‚àó y) ‚àó (z ‚àó x) = (x ‚àó (y ‚àó z)) ‚àó x for all x, y, z ‚àà Zn. 
 
Now (x ‚àó y) ‚àó (z ‚àó x) = (tx + uy) ‚àó (tz + ux) = t2x + tuy + tux + u2x. 
 
Further (x ‚àó (y ‚àó z)) ‚àó x 
= 
(x ‚àó (ty + uz)) ‚àó x 
=  
(tx + tuy +u2z) ‚àó x 
=  
t2x + t2uy + tu2z + ux. 
 
Now t2x + tuy + tuz + u2x ‚â° t2x + t2uy + tu2z + ux (mod n) if and only if u2 ‚â° u (mod 
n) and t2 ‚â° t (mod n). Hence the claim. 
 
Thus we see the class of groupoids Z (n) contain SGs and also Smarandache strong 
Bol groupoids, Smarandache strong Moufang groupoids, Smarandache idempotent groupoids 
and Smarandache strong P-groupoids.

5.2 Smarandache Groupoids in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) 
 
In this section, we study the conditions for the class of groupoids in Z‚àó(n) to have 
SGs. Throughout this section we will be interested in studying those groupoids in Z‚àó(n) 
which are not in Z (n) that is only groupoids in Z‚àó(n) \ Z (n).  
 
Example 5.2.1: Let Z5 (2, 4) ‚àà Z‚àó (5). Z5 (2, 4) is a SG given by the following table: 
 
‚àó 0 1 2 3 4 
0 0 4 3 2 1 
1 2 1 0 4 3 
2 4 3 2 1 0 

 
 
76 
3 1 0 4 3 2 
4 3 2 1 0 4 
 
Clearly, this is a SG as {1}, {2}, {3} and {4} are subsets which are semigroups.  
 
It is important and interesting to note that the class of groupoids Z‚àó(3) and Z‚àó(4) are 
such that Z‚àó(3) = Z (3) and Z‚àó(4) = Z(4). But Z‚àó(5) has only two SGs given by Z5(2,4) and Z5 
(4, 2).  
 
As in the case of groupoids in Z (n), the groupoids in Z‚àó(n) are SGs when t + u ‚â° 1 
(mod n). 
 
Example 5.2.2: Let Z6 (2, 4) ‚àà Z‚àó(6) be the groupoid given by the following table: 
 
‚àó 
0 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
0 
0

0 
  
This is a SG as the set {0, 3} is a semigroup of Z6 (2, 4). 
 
Now yet another interesting example of a SG is given. 
 
Example 5.2.3: Consider the groupoid Z8 (2, 6) ‚àà Z‚àó(8) given by the following table: 
 
‚àó 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
0 0 6 4 2 0 6 4 2 
1 2 0 6 4 2 0 6 4 
2 4 2 0 6 4 2 0 6 
3 6 4 2 0 6 4 2 0 
4 0 6 4 2 0 6 4 2 
5 2 0 6 4 2 0 6 4 
6 4 2 0 6 4 2 0 6 
7 6 4 2 0 6 4 2 0 
 
This is a SG for the subset {0, 4} is a semigroup. Hence, Z8 (2, 6) is a SG.  
 
Example 5.2.4: The groupoid Z8 (3, 6) is also a SG from the class of groupoids Z‚àó(8). 
Further the class Z‚àó(8) has Z8 (2,7), Z8 (4, 5), Z8 (3, 6), Z8 (2, 6), Z8 (4, 6), Z8 (6, 2), Z8 (6, 4) 
and Z8 (6, 3) are SGs and the only SGs in Z‚àó(8) \ Z (8) are Z8 (2, 6), Z8 (4, 6), Z8 (6, 2), Z8 (6, 
4), Z8 (3, 6) and Z8 (6, 3). Thus there are 6 SGs in Z‚àó(8) \ Z (8).  
 

 
 
77 
Example 5.2.5: Let Z‚àó(12) be the class of groupoids. We see Z12 (3, 9) is a SG for it contains 
P = {0, 6} as a subset which is a semigroup. Z12 (4, 6) is a SG as Q = {4} and P = {0, 6} are 
subsets which are semigroups.  
 
Z12 (4, 8) is a SG as the subset {0, 6} is a semigroup.  
Z12 (5, 10) is a SG as the subset {6} is a semigroup.  
Z12 (8, 10) is a SG as {0, 6} is a semigroup.  
Z12 (2, 4) is a SG as {0, 6} is a proper subset which is a semigroup.  
Z12 (2, 6) is a SG as {0, 6} is a proper subset which is a semigroup.  
Z12 (2, 8) is a SG as {0, 6} is a proper subset which is a semigroup.  
Z12 (2, 10) is a SG as {0, 6} is a proper subset which is a semigroup.  
Z12 (3, 6) is a SG as {0, 6} is a proper subset which is a semigroup. 
Z12 (3, 9) is a SG as {0, 6} is a proper subset which is a semigroup. 
Z12 (4, 10) is a SG as {0, 6} is a proper subset which is a semigroup. 
Z12 (6, 8) is a SG as {0, 6} is a proper subset which is a semigroup. 
Z12 (6, 10) is a SG as {0, 6} is a proper subset which is a semigroup. 
Z12 (6, 9) is a SG as {6} is a proper subset which is a semigroup. 
 
Thus this class Z‚àó(12) \ Z (12) has only 28 groupoids which are SGs.  
 
This leads to open problems given in Chapter 7.  
 
THEOREM 5.2.1: Let Zn (t, u) ‚àà Z‚àó(n) \ Z (n). If t + u ‚â° 1 (mod n). Then Zn (t, u) is a SG.  
 
Proof: If t + u ‚â° 1 (mod n) then for every x ‚àà Zn. x ‚àó x = tx + ux ‚â° (t + u) x ‚â° x (mod n) thus 
every singleton is a semigroup. Hence Zn(t,u) ‚àà Z‚àó(n) \ Z (n) is a SG if t + u ‚â° 1 (mod n). 
 
THEOREM 5.2.2: The SG Zn (t, u) ‚àà Z‚àó(n) \ Z (n) with t + u ‚â° 1 (mod n) is a Smarandache 
strong Moufang groupoid, Smarandache strong P-groupoid, Smarandache idempotent 
groupoid, Smarandache strong Bol groupoid and Smarandache strong alternative groupoid 
if and only if t2 ‚â° t (mod n) and u2 ‚â° u (mod n). 
 
Proof: It can be easily verified that the SG Zn (t,u) ‚àà Z‚àó(n) \ Z (n) with t + u ‚â° 1(mod n) 
satisfies the following identities:  
 
 x ‚àó x  
‚â° 
x(mod n) 
(x ‚àó y) ‚àó y  
‚â°  
x ‚àó (y ‚àó x) (mod n) 
(x ‚àó x) ‚àó y  
‚â° 
x ‚àó (x ‚àó y) (mod n) 
(x ‚àó y) ‚àó x 
‚â° 
x ‚àó (y ‚àó x) (mod n) 
(x ‚àó y) ‚àó (z ‚àó x) 
‚â°  
(x ‚àó (y ‚àó z)) ‚àó x(mod n) 
((x ‚àó y) ‚àó z) ‚àó y  ‚â°  
x ‚àó ((y ‚àó z) ‚àó y) (mod n) 
 
for all x, y, z ‚àà Zn if and only if t2 ‚â° t (mod n) and u2 ‚â° u (mod n). Hence the claim. 
 
Thus, we see not all SGs in Z‚àó(n) \ Z (n) satisfy all the identities.

number of SGs? 
 
 
5.3 Smarandache Groupoids in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) 
 
In this section, we study yet another new class of groupoids Z‚àó‚àó(n) to contain SGs. 
We are interested in only finding SGs in Z‚àó‚àó(n) \ Z‚àó(n) as we have completely elaborated 
about SGs in Z‚àó(n). Thus we will characterize and obtain some interesting properties about 
SGs in Z‚àó‚àó(n) \ Z‚àó(n).  
 
We just recall the definition of groupoids in Z‚àó‚àó(n). 
 

 
 
79 
DEFINITION: Let Zn = {0, 1, 2, ‚Ä¶ , n ‚Äì 1}, n ‚â• 3; n ‚Äì 1 < ‚àû. Define operation ‚àó on Zn by a ‚àó 
b = ta + ub (mod n) where t can be equal to u also, t, u ‚àà Zn \ {0}. We denote this collection 
of groupoids for varying u and t by Z‚àó‚àó(n).  
 
Example 5.3.1: Z6 (2, 2) is a groupoid in the class Z‚àó‚àó(6) given by the following table:  
 
‚àó 0 1 2 3 4 5 
0 0 2 4 0 2 4 
1 2 4 0 2 4 0 
2 4 0 2 4 0 2 
3 0 2 4 0 2 4 
4 2 4 0 2 4 0 
5 4 0 2 4 0 2 
   
This is also a SG as {4} is a subset, which is a semigroup under the operation ‚àó.  
 
Example 5.3.2: Let Z9 (4, 4) be the groupoid given by the following table:  
 
‚àó 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
0 0 4 8 3 7 2 6 1 5 
1 4 8 3 7 2 6 1 5 0 
2 8 3 7 2 6 1 5 0 4 
3 3 7 2 6 1 5 0 4 8 
4 7 2 6 1 5 0 4 8 3 
5 2 6 1 5 0 4 8 3 7 
6 6 1 5 0 4 8 3 7 2 
7 1 5 0 4 8 3 7 2 6 
8 5 0 4 8 3 7 2 6 1 
 
This is a commutative groupoid but this has no proper subsets, which are semigroups 
so Z9 (4, 4) is not a SG in Z‚àó‚àó(9).  
 
We see Z‚àó‚àó(n) \ Z‚àó(n) contains SGs. The number of groupoids in Z‚àó‚àó(n) \ Z‚àó(n) are (n ‚Äì 
1) for a given n and all of them are commutative. Now consider the following two groupoids 
in Z‚àó‚àó(3).  
 
Example 5.3.3: The 2 groupoids in Z‚àó‚àó(3) are given by the following tables: 
Table for Z3 (1, 1)   
‚àó 0 1 2 
0 0 1 2 
1 1 2 0 
2 2 0 1 
 
Clearly, Z3 (1, 1) is a semigroup.  
 
Table for Z3 (2, 2) 

 
 
80 
‚àó 0 1 2 
0 0 1 2 
1 1 2 0 
2 2 0 1 
 
The groupoid Z3 (2, 2) is a SG as the proper subset {1} and {2} are semigroups. It is 
interesting to see the 2 groupoids in Z‚àó‚àó(3) only one is a SG other being a semigroup. But in 
the class Z‚àó‚àó(4) we see the groupoids Z4 (1, 1) is a semigroup and Z4 (2, 2) and Z4 (3, 3) are 
SGs. It is left for the reader to verify the fact. 
 
Since all semigroups are trivially SGs we are interested in studying only (n ‚Äì 2) of the 
groupoids in Zn (m, m) given by Zn (2, 2), Zn (3, 3), ‚Ä¶ , Zn (n ‚Äì 1, n ‚Äì 1) as Zn (1, 1) is a 
semigroup. Here also it is proper to mention when n is a prime Zp (1, 1) has no proper subset 
which is a semigroup as Zp (1, 1) has no proper subsemigroups. So we can only say Zp (1, 1) 
is a trivial SG as Zp (1, 1) is itself a semigroup and Zp(1, 1) may or may not have proper 
subsemigroups.

Example 5.3.4: Consider Z12 (6, 6) ‚àà Z‚àó‚àó(12); 62 ‚â° 0 (mod 12). Clearly, the table for the 
subset {0, 6} is a semigroup.  
 
‚àó 0 6 
0 0 0

Example 5.3.5: Consider Z14 (7, 7) now 72 ‚â° 7 (mod 14). The subset {0, 7} is given by the 
following table: 
 
‚àó 0 7 
0 0 7 
7 7 0 
 
is a semigroup. Hence, Z14 (7, 7) is a SG in Z‚àó‚àó(14).  
 
THEOREM 5.3.5: Let Zn (m, m) be a groupoid such that n is even m2 ‚â° m (mod n) and m + m 
‚â° 0 (mod n). Then Zn (m, m) is a SG of Z‚àó‚àó(n).  
 
Proof: Using the fact n is even m2 ‚â° m (mod n) and m + m ‚â° 0 (mod n) we see the subset {0, 
m} given by the following table is a semigroup.  
 
‚àó 
0 
m 
0 
0 
m 
m m 
0 
 
Thus Zn (m, n) in Z‚àó‚àó(n) is a SG. 
 
Example 5.3.6: Let Z18 (9, 9) in Z‚àó‚àó(18) is a SG as {0, 9} is given by the following table:  
 
‚àó 0 9 
0 0 9 
9 9 0 
 
is a semigroup.  
 
THEOREM 5.3.6: Let Zn (m, m) be a groupoid in Z‚àó‚àó(n). Zn (m, m) is a SG only if m + m ‚â° 1 
(mod n).  
 

 
 
82 
Proof: Now in Zn (m, m) ‚àà Z**(n) we have m + m ‚â° 1 (mod n). To show Zn (m, m) is a SG 
we have to obtain a proper subset in Zn (m, m) which is a semigroup. Now take any element r 
‚àà Zn.  
 
r ‚àó r 
 
‚â° 
 rm + rm (mod n) 
  
 
 
 
‚â° 
 r(m + m) (mod n) 
 
 
 
 
‚â° 
 1 (mod n) 
 
Thus r ‚àó r ‚â° r (mod n) so {r} is a semigroup in Zn (m, m), so Zn (m, m) is a SG in 
Z‚àó‚àó(n). 
 
THEOREM 5.3.7: The SG Zn (m, m) in Z‚àó‚àó(n) where m + m ‚â° 1 (mod n) and m2 ‚â° m (mod n) is  
 
1. Smarandache idempotent groupoid. 
2. Smarandache strong P-groupoid.  
3. Smarandache strong Bol groupoid.  
4. Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid. 
5. Smarandache strong alternative groupoid.

theoretic techniques.

5.4 Smarandache Groupoids in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó(n)  
 
In this section, we find which of the groupoids in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) are SGs. In our study, we 
concentrate SGs only in the class Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) \ Z‚àó‚àó(n). We obtain some interesting results about 
them. We just recall the definition of the class of groupoids in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n).  
 
DEFINITION: Let Zn = {0, 1, 2, ‚Ä¶ , n ‚Äì 1}, n ‚â• 3, n <  ‚àû. Define ‚àó for a, b‚àà Zn by a ‚àó b = ta + 
ub (mod n) where t, u ‚àà Zn. Here we permit the possibility of t = 0 or u = 0 also. Thus the 
class of groupoids in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) is such that Z‚àó‚àó(n) ‚äÇ Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n).  
 
Further, we have Z (n) ‚äÇ Z‚àó(n) ‚äÇ Z‚àó‚àó (n) ‚äÇ Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n). Here in this section we study only 
the SGs in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) \ Z‚àó‚àó(n).  
 
Example 5.4.1: Let Z5 (3,0) be the groupoid given by the following table:  
 
‚àó 0 1 2 3 4 
0 0 0 0 0 0 
1 3 3 3 3 3 

 
 
84 
2 1 1 1 1 1 
3 4 4 4 4 4 
4 2 2 2 2 2 
 
This is not a SG. This groupoid is both non-associative and non-commutative.  
 
We have in the class of groupoids Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) the groupoids Zn  (1, 0) and Zn (0, 1) to be 
semigroups so we are not interested in this section to study these groupoids.  
 
Example 5.4.2: Consider Z6 (2, 0) ‚àà Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(6) given by the following table:  
 
‚àó 0 1 2 3 4 5 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
1 2 2 2 2 2 2 
2 4 4 4 4 4 4 
3 0 0 0 0 0 0 
4 2 2 2 2 2 2 
5 4 4 4 4 4 4 
  
The subset {0, 3} is a semigroup. Hence, Z6 (2, 0) is a SG.  
 
THEOREM 5.4.1: The groupoid Zn (2, 0) ‚àà Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) where n = 2m is a SG.  
 
Proof: The set {0, m) is a semigroup given by the table: 
 
‚àó 
0 m 
0 
0 
0 
m 0 
0 
 
Hence, Zn (2, 0) is a SG.  
 
COROLLARY 5.4.2: The groupoid Zn (0, 2) in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) where n = 2m is a SG. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader to verify.   
 
THEOREM 5.4.3: The groupoid Zn (m, 0) ‚àà Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) where n = 2m is a SG.  
 
Proof: The subset {0, 2} is a semigroup; given by the following table:  
  
‚àó 0 2 
0 0 0 
2 0 0 
 
COROLLARY 5.4.4: The groupoid Zn (0, m) in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) where n = 2m is a SG. 
 
Proof: For the subset {0, 2} is given by the table:  
 

 
 
85 
‚àó 0 2 
0 0 0 
2 0 0 
 
is a semigroup. Hence Zn (m, 0) is a SG.  
 
THEOREM 5.4.5: Let Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) be the class of groupoids. Let p be a prime such that, p / n. then 
Zn (p, 0) is a SG.  
 
Proof: Now to show Zn (p, 0) is a SG we have to find a subset which is a semigroup. 
Consider {0, n/p} the subset given by the following table:  
 
‚àó 
0 
n/p 
0 
0 
0 
n/p 
0 
0 
 
This is a semigroup. Hence Zn (p, 0) is a SG.  
 
COROLLARY 5.4.6: The groupoid Zn (0, p) ‚àà Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) is a SG if p / m and p is a prime. 
 
Proof: It is easily verified on similar lines.    
 
COROLLARY 5.4.7: Zn (n/p, 0) is a SG.  
 
Proof: Consider the set {0, p} in Zn (n/p, 0). Clearly, this set is a semigroup as evident from 
the table:  
 
‚àó 0 p 
0 0 0 
p 0 0 
 
Thus Zn (p, 0) is a SG.  
 
From this, we get following theorem.  
 
THEOREM 5.4.8: Let Zn = {0, 1, 2, ... , n ‚Äì 1} , n > 3, n < ‚àû. Suppose n = p1, ‚Ä¶ , pm where 
each pi is a distinct prime. Then the class Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) has atleast m + mC2 + ‚Ä¶ + mCm-1 SGs.  
 
Proof: Clearly we see for each prime pi we get m distinct SGs as the sets {0, n/pi} is a 
semigroup. Now we get atleast mC2 distinct SGs as the sets {0, n/pipj}, i ‚â† j and i,j ‚àà {1, 2, 
‚Ä¶, m} is  a semigroup. (We have mC2 such distinct sets collected from p1, p2, ‚Ä¶ , pm). 
Similarly we get mC3 distinct SGs for the set {0, n / pipjpk}, i ‚â† j, j ‚â† k and i ‚â† k is a 
semigroup. i, j, k ‚àà {1, 2, ‚Ä¶ , m}. Continuing this process we see atleast mCm-1 distinct SGs 
as the set

 is a semigroup. 
ipÀÜ means it does not occur in the product 
p1 p2 p3 ... 
ipÀÜ pi+1 ... pm. Thus if n = p1, p2 ‚Ä¶ pm where m primes are distinct, we have atleast 
m + mC2 + ‚Ä¶+ mCm-1 SGs in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n).  

 
 
86 
 
COROLLARY 5.4.9: Let Zn = {0, 1, 2, ... , n ‚Äì 1} if n = p1p2 ... pm where pi are distinct primes 
then Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) has atleast 2(m + mC1 + mC2 + mCm‚Äì1) groupoids. 
 
Proof: We know if Zn (0, t) is a SG then Zn (t, 0) is also a SG. Using this principle and 
theorem 5.4.8 we see Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) has atleast 2(m + mC1 +mC2 + ... + mCm‚Äì1) SGs. 
  
COROLLARY 5.4.10: Let Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) be the class of groupoids with n = 
m
1
m
1
p
,....,
p
Œ±
Œ±
where pi are 
primes, then Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) has SGs.  
 
Proof: Zn(
i
ipŒ± , 0) is a SG. For the set (0, n/
i
ipŒ± ) is a semigroup given by the following table:  
 
‚àó 
0 
n/
i
ipŒ±  
0 
0 
0 
n/
i
ipŒ±

Hence the claim.  
 
Example 5.4.3: Let Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(30) be a groupoid. Clearly Z30 (3, 0), Z30 (2, 0), Z30 (5, 0), Z30 (6, 0), 
Z30 (10, 0) and Z30 (15, 0) are SGs in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(30). Thus, there are 12 SGs in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(30). It is 
important to note that these are not only the SGs. 
  
Example 5.4.4: Let Z6 (3, 0) belong to Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(6) given by the following table: 
 
‚àó 0 1 2 3 4 5 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
1 3 3 3 3 3 3 
2 0 0 0 0 0 0 
3 3 3 3 3 3 3 
4 0 0 0 0 0 0 
5 3 3 3 3 3 3 
  
{3} is a semigroup so Z6 (3, 0) is a SG.  
 
THEOREM 5.4.11: Let Zn (m, 0) belong to Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) with m ‚àó m = m (mod n). Then Zn (m, 0) is 
a SG, which is Smarandache strong Bol groupoid, Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid, 
Smarandache strong P-groupoid and Smarandache strong alternative groupoid.  
 
Proof: Since m ‚àà Zn \ {0} is such that m ‚àó m ‚â° m (mod n) so Zn (m, 0) and Zn (0, m) are SGs 
as {m} is a proper subset which is a semigroup. It is left for the reader to verify Zn (m, 0) and 
Zn (0, m) are Smarandache strong Bol groupoid, Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid, 
Smarandache strong P-groupoid and Smarandache strong alternative groupoid. 
 
COROLLARY 5.4.12:  Let Zn = {0, 1, 2, ... , n ‚Äì 1 }, n > 3, n < ‚àû.  Zn(m, 0) is a SG for every 
idempotent m ‚àà Zn.(m2 ‚â° m (mod n)).  
 

 
 
87 
Proof: If m2 ‚â° m (mod n) we have just proved in Theorem 5.4.11 Zn(m, 0) and Zn (0, m) are 
SGs.  
 
Example 5.4.5: The SGs in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(12) \ Z‚àó‚àó(12) are Z12 (4,0), Z12 (0, 4), Z12 (9, 0) and Z12 (0, 
9). 
  
Example 5.4.6: Consider the groupoids Z15 (6, 0), Z15 (0, 6), Z15 (10, 0) and Z15 (0, 10) in 
Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(15) \ Z‚àó‚àó(15) they are SGs which are Smarandache Bol groupoids, Smarandache 
Moufang groupoids, Smarandache alternative groupoids and Smarandache P-groupoid.  
 
This is left for the reader to verify the above facts.  
 
 
PROBLEM 1: Find the number of SGs in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(15). 
 
PROBLEM 2: Find the SG in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(8). 
 
PROBLEM 3: Prove Z33 (11,0) is a SG.  
 
PROBLEM 4: Find all the SGs in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(32). 
 
PROBLEM 5: Does Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(31) have SGs?  
 
(Note: A SG must be only in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(31) \ Z‚àó‚àó(31) and it is not Z31 (1, 0) or Z31 (0, 1)). 
 
PROBLEM 6: Find all SGs in Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(18) \ Z‚àó‚àó(18). 
 
PROBLEM 7: Is the groupoid Z7 (3, 0) a SG? Justify.

5.5 Smarandache Direct Product Using the New Class of Smarandache 
Groupoids 
 
In this section, we study the Smarandache direct product of groupoids using new 
classes of SGs. The main use of direct product is that in all the new classes of SGs built using 
Zn we saw the proper subsets which were semigroups just had order 2 or 1 elements,  but we 
are able to overcome this problem once we make use of Smarandache direct products. We 
can get semigroups of desired order by using desired number of groupoids. To get both 
heterogeneous and mixed structures we can use groupoids from the different classes Z (n), 
Z‚àó(n), Z‚àó‚àó(n) and Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n). Further, we can have proper Smarandache subgroupoids in them.  
 

 
 
88 
Example 5.5.1: Let Z6 (3, 4) ‚àà Z (6) and Z6 (5, 2) ‚àà Z (6). The direct product Z6 (3, 4) √ó Z6 
(5, 2) = {(x, y)/ x ‚àà Z6 (3, 4) and y ‚àà Z6 (5, 2)} has many subsets, which are semigroups.  
 
Example 5.5.2: G = Z7 (5, 3) √ó Z6 (3, 0) is a SG of order 42. This has atleast 2 proper 
Smarandache subgroupoids of order 6. 
Thus we can study about Smarandache normal subgroupoids and so on. Thus, we 
have an interesting result.  
 
THEOREM 5.5.1: Let G1, G2, ‚Ä¶ , Gn be n SGs from the class of groupoids Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(m) for varying 
m. Let G = G1 √ó G2 √ó‚Ä¶√ó Gn. Then G has atleast n + nC2 + ‚Ä¶ + nCn ‚Äì 1 Smarandache 
subgroupoids.  
 
Proof: Given G = G1 √ó G2 √ó‚Ä¶√ó Gn and each Gi is a SG. Now 
i
G ={0} √ó {0} √ó ‚Ä¶ √ó Gi √ó {0} 
√ó ‚Ä¶ √ó {0}. So for i = 1, 2, ‚Ä¶ , n we get n Smarandache subgroupoids of G. Take 
i
G
j
G  =  
{0} √ó {0} √ó ‚Ä¶ √ó Gi √ó ‚Ä¶ √ó Gj √ó‚Ä¶ √ó {0} with i ‚â† j we have nC2 distinct Smarandache 
subgroupoids of G. Similarly 
i
G
j
G
k
G  = {0} √ó {0} √ó ‚Ä¶ √ó Gi √ó ‚Ä¶ √ó Gj √ó‚Ä¶ √óGk √ó ‚Ä¶ √ó {0}, 
i, j and k are distinct. We get from this nC3 Smarandache subgroupoids of G and so on. Thus 
1
G √ó ‚Ä¶ √ó {0} √ó ‚Ä¶ √ó 
n
G  gives nCn-1 that is n Smarandache subgroupoids of G. Hence we 
have in G at least n + nC1 + ‚Ä¶ + nCn ‚Äì 1 number of Smarandache subgroupoids of G. Thus 
even if none of the groupoids G1, G2, ‚Ä¶ , Gn have proper Smarandache subgroupoids still we 
may at least get n + nC2 + ‚Ä¶ + nCn ‚Äì 1 number of Smarandache subgroupoids in G = G1 √ó ‚Ä¶ 
√ó Gn.  
 
Hence this theorem helps us to obtain just Smarandache Bol groupoids, Smarandache 
Moufang groupoids, Smarandache alternative groupoids and Smarandache P-groupoids 
which is got even if one of the groupoids in this set G1, G2, ‚Ä¶, Gn happens to be even 
Smarandache strong Bol groupoid or Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid and so on. 
Thus, we see from the technique of Smarandache direct product of groupoids we are able to 
get varieties of SGs. Just as in the case of direct product of groups, we see even if one of the 
SGs in this class is a Smarandache normal groupoid, G has Smarandache normal 
subgroupoids. Thus, Smarandache direct products helps us in many ways to get a desired 
form of SGs. This concept of Smarandache direct product of groupoids will find its 
application in the Smarandache semi-automaton and Smarandache automaton respectively 
discussed in chapter 6.  
 
Example 5.5.3: Let Z3 (2, 1) and Z4 (1, 3) be two groupoids. G = Z3(2, 1) √ó Z4 (1, 3). The 
groupoid G is even by the following table:

We denote the pairs (x, y) by (xy) in the above table for notational convenience.  
 
Let G = Z3 (2, 1) √ó Z4 (1, 3). This groupoid has 12 elements given by the table above. 
This has proper subgroupoids {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)} = {(00), (01), (02), (03)}, which is 
a Smarandache subgroupoid as {(0, 0), (0, 2)} = {(00), (02)} is a semigroup. This example is 
specially given because we see the groupoid Z3 (2, 1) is not a SG still we can using it with a 
SG get a SG having subgroupoids which are also Smarandache subgroupoids. Thus, direct 
product helps us to find many interesting results.

5.6 Smarandache Groupoids with Identity Using Zn 
 
Now we studied four new classes of groupoids Z (n), Z‚àó(n), Z‚àó‚àó(n) and Z‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) using 
Zn but none of them which are not semigroups have identity in them, so we have to define 
once again a new class of groupoids using Zn ‚à™ {e} = G where e ‚àâ Zn.  
 

 
 
90 
We define operation on G by  
 
1. a ‚àó a = e.  
2. a ‚àó e = e ‚àó a = a for all a ‚àà G.  
3. a ‚â† b, a ‚àó b = ta + ub (mod n) where t, u ‚àà Zn \ {0}, (t, u) = 1 and t ‚â† u.  
We denote this class of groupoids by G (n). If we make t, u ‚àà Zn \ {0}, (t, u) = d, with 
t ‚â† u then we denote the class by G‚àó(n). Similarly if we permit t, u ‚àà Zn \ {0} such that t = u 
can also occur then we denote this class by G‚àó‚àó(n). If we have one of t or u to be zero we 
denote it by G‚àó‚àó‚àó(n).  
 
Thus, we have groupoids with identity as G (n) ‚äÇ G‚àó(n) ‚äÇ G‚àó‚àó(n) ‚äÇ G‚àó‚àó‚àó(n). Now our 
aim is to study which of these groupoids are SGs, Smarandache P-groupoids and so on.  
 
Example 5.6.1: Let G = (Z4 ‚à™  {e}) define ‚àó on G by a ‚àó b = 2a + 3b (mod 4) for a, b ‚àà Z4 is 
given by the following table:  
 
‚àó e 0 1 2 3 
e e 0 1 2 3 
0 0 e 3 2 1 
1 1 2 e 0 3 
2 2 0 3 e 1 
3 3 2 1 0 e 
  
  This is a SG with identity of order 5 as {e, m} is a semigroup for m = 1, 2, 3.  
 
THEOREM 5.6.1: All groupoids in G‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) are SGs.  
 
Proof: Clearly by the definition of G‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) we have {e, m} for m = 1, 2, 3, ... , n ‚Äì 1 are 
semigroups. So every groupoid in G‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) are SGs. 
 
Remark: Since G (n) ‚äÇ G‚àó(n) ‚äÇ G‚àó‚àó(n) ‚äÇ G‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) for every n we see all groupoids in G (n), 
G‚àó(n), G‚àó‚àó(n) are SGs as we have proved in Theorem 5.6.1 that all groupoids in G‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) is a 
SG.  
 
THEOREM 5.6.2: No groupoid in G‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) is a Smarandache idempotent groupoid.  
 
Proof: Since by the very definition of G we see x ‚àó x = e, so no element in G is an 
idempotent element, so no groupoid in G‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) is a Smarandache idempotent groupoid.  
 
Example 5.6.2: Let G = Z6 ‚à™ {e} for a, b ‚àà Z6 define a ‚àó b = 5a + 3b. The groupoid is given 
by the following table:  
 
‚àó e 0 1 2 3 4 5 
e e 0 1 2 3 4 5 
0 0 e 3 0 3 0 3 
1 1 5 e 5 2 5 2 
2 2 4 1 e 1 4 1 

 
 
91 
3 3 3 0 3 e 3 0 
4 4 2 5 2 5 e 5 
5 5 1 4 1 4 1 e 
    
This groupoid is Smarandache strong right alternative, but it is not even Smarandache 
left alternative. Now we give an example of a left alternative groupoid in G (6), which is not 
right alternative.  
 
Example 5.6.3: The groupoid in G (6) is given by the following table:  
 
‚àó e 
0 1 2 3 4 5 
e 
e 
0 1 2 3 4 5 
0 0 e 
5 4 3 2 1 
1 1 4 e 
2 1 0 5 
2 2 2 1 e 
5 4 3 
3 3 0 5 3 e 
2 1 
4 4 4 3 2 1 e 
5 
5 5 2 1 0 5 4 e 
 
This is a Smarandache strong left alternative groupoid for     (x ‚àó x) ‚àó y = x ‚àó (x ‚àó y). 
Consider (x ‚àó x) ‚àó y = y. Now x ‚àó (x ‚àó y) = x ‚àó [4x + 5y] = 4x + 20x + 25y = y. Hence the 
claim.  
 
This is not Smarandache right alternative, it is left for the reader to verify. In view of 
this, we have the following theorem.  
 
THEOREM 5.6.3: Groupoids in G‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) are Smarandache strong right alternative groupoid if 
and only if t2 ‚â° 1 (mod n) and tu + u ‚â° 0 (mod n).  
 
Proof: A SG G in G‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) is Smarandache strong right alternative if for x, y ‚àà G we must 
have (x ‚àó y) ‚àó y = x ‚àó (y ‚àó y). (x ‚àó y) ‚àó y = (tx + uy) ‚àó y = t2x + tuy + uy (mod n). Now x ‚àó (y 
‚àó y) = x. (x ‚àó y) ‚àó y ‚â° x ‚àó (y ‚àó y) (mod n) if and only if t2 ‚â° 1 (mod n) and tu + u ‚â° 0 (mod n). 
Similarly we get the following characterization theorem for a groupoid in G‚àó‚àó‚àó(n) to be 
Smarandache strong left alternative.  
 
THEOREM 5.6.4: Let G be a groupoid in G‚àó‚àó‚àó(n). G is a Smarandache strong left alternative 
if and only if u2 ‚â° 1 (mod n) and (t + tu) ‚â° 0 (mod n).  
 
Proof: On similar lines, the proof can be given as in Theorem 5.6.3.  
THEOREM 5.6.5: Let G (n) be a groupoid in G‚àó‚àó‚àó(n), n not a prime. G (n) is a Smarandache 
strong Bol groupoid, Smarandache strong Moufang groupoid, Smarandache strong P-
groupoid only when t2 ‚â° t (mod n) and u2 ‚â° u (mod n).  
 
Proof: The verification is left for the reader.

The semi automaton and automaton are built using the fundamental algebraic 
structure semigroups. In this chapter we use the generalized concept of semigroups viz. 
Smarandache groupoids which always contains a semigroup in them are used to construct 
Smarandache semi automaton and Smarandache automaton. Thus, the Smarandache 
groupoids find its application in the construction of finite machines. Here we introduce the 
concept of Smarandache semi automaton and Smarandache automaton using Smarandache 
free groupoids. This chapter starts with the definition of Smarandache free groupoids. 
 
 
6.1 Basic Results  
 
DEFINITION: Let S be non empty set. Generate a free groupoid using S and denote it by 
<S>. Clearly the free semigroup generated by the set S is properly contained in <S>; as in 
<S> we may or may not have the associative law to be true. 
 
Remark: Even (ab) c ‚â† a (bc) in general for all a, b, c ‚àà <S>. Thus unlike a free semigroup 
where the operation is associative, in case of free groupoid we do not assume the 
associativity while placing them in justra position. 
 
THEOREM 6.1.1: Every free groupoid is a Smarandache free groupoid. 
 
Proof: Clearly if S is the set which generates the free groupoid then it will certainly contain 
the free semigroup generated by S, so every free groupoid is a Smarandache free groupoid. 
 
We just recall the definition of semi automaton and automaton from the book of 
R.Lidl and G.Pilz. 
 
DEFINITION: A Semi Automaton is a triple Y = (Z, A, Œ¥) consisting of two non - empty sets Z 
and A and a function Œ¥: Z √ó A ‚Üí Z, Z is called the set of states, A the input alphabet and Œ¥ 
the "next state function" of Y.  
 

 
 
94 
Let A = {a1, ..., an} and Z = {z1, ..., zk}. The semi automaton Y  = (Z, A, Œ¥). The semi 
automaton can also be described by the transition table.

as Œ¥ : Z √ó A ‚Üí Z, Œ¥(zi, aj) ‚àà Z. The semi automaton can also be described by graphs.  
 
Description by graphs:  
 
We depict z1, ..., zk as 'discs' in the plane and draw an arrow labeled ai from zr to zs if 
Œ¥(zr, ai) = zr. This graph is called the state graph.  
 
Example 6.1.1: Z ‚Äì set of states and A ‚Äì input alphabet. Let Z = {0, 1, 2} and A = {0, 1}. 
The function Œ¥: Z √ó A ‚Üí Z defined by Œ¥ (0, 1) = 1 = Œ¥ (2, 1) = Œ¥ (1, 1), Œ¥ (0, 0) = 0, Œ¥ (2, 0) = 
1, Œ¥ (1, 0) = 0. 
 
This is a semi automaton, having the following graph. 
 
 
 
The description by table is:

DEFINITION: An Automaton is a quintuple K  = (Z, A, B, Œ¥, Œõ) where (Z, A, Œ¥) is a semi 
automaton, B is a non-empty set called the output alphabet and Œª: Z √ó A ‚Üí B is the output 
function.  
 
If z ‚àà Z and a ‚àà A, then we interpret Œ¥ (z, a) ‚àà Z as the next state into which z is 
transformed by the input a, Œª (z, a) ‚àà B is the output resulting from the input a.

Thus if the automaton is in state z and receives input a, then it changes to state Œ¥ (z, a) 
with output Œª (z, a).  
 
If A = {a1, ..., an}, B = {b1, b2, ..., bm} and Z ={z1, ..., zk}, Œ¥ : Z √ó A ‚Üí Z and Œª : Z √ó 
A ‚Üí B given by the description by tables where Œ¥ (zk, ai) ‚àà Z and Œª (zk, aj) ‚àà B.

This automaton is know as the parity check automaton.  
 
 
Now it is important and interesting to note that Z, A and B are only non-empty 
sets. They have no algebraic operation defined on them. The automatons and semi 
automatons defined in this manner do not help one to perform sequential operations. 
Thus, it is reasonable to consider the set of all finite sequences of elements of the set A 
including the empty sequence Œõ.  
 
In other words, in our study of automaton we extend the input set A to the free 
monoid A  and 
B
A
Z
:
‚Üí
√ó
Œª
 where B  is the free monoid generated by B. We also 
extend functions Œ¥ and Œª from Z √ó A to Z √ó A  by defining z ‚àà Z and a1, ..., an ‚àà  A by

The semi automaton Y = (Z, A, Œ¥) and automaton K = (Z, A, B, Œ¥, Œª) is thus 
generalized to the new semi automaton Y = (Z,

A
) and automaton K  = (Z, 
Œª
Œ¥,
 ,
B
 ,
A
).  
 
We throughout in this book mean by new semi automaton Y = (Z,

6.2 Smarandache Semi Automaton and Smarandache Automaton  
 
The concept of Smarandache semi automaton and Smarandache automaton was 
first defined by the author in the year 2002. The study of Smarandache semi automaton 
and automata use the concept of groupoids and  free groupoids. 
  
Now we define Smarandache semi automaton and Smarandache automaton as 
follows: 
 

 
 
97
DEFINITION: Ys =  (Z, 
s
s ,
A Œ¥ ) is said to be a Smarandache semi automaton if 
s
A = ‚å©A‚å™ is 
the free groupoid generated by A with Œõ the empty element adjoined with it and 
s
Œ¥  is the 
function from Z √ó 
s
A ‚Üí Z. Thus the Smarandache semi automaton contains Y = (Z, 
Œ¥
,
A
) 
as a new semi automaton which is a proper sub-structure of Ys.  
 
Or equivalently, we define a Smarandache semi automaton as one, which has a 
new semi automaton as a sub-structure.  
 
The advantages of the Smarandache semi automaton are if for the triple Y = (Z, 
A, Œ¥) is a semi automaton with Z, the set of states, A the input alphabet and Œ¥ : Z √ó A ‚Üí Z 
is the next state function.  
 
When we generate the Smarandache free groupoid by A and adjoin with it the 
empty alphabet Œõ then we are sure that A has all free semigroups. Thus, each free 
semigroup will give a new semi automaton. Thus by choosing a suitable A we can get 
several new semi automaton using a single Smarandache semi automaton.  
 
We now give some examples of Smarandache semi automaton using finite 
groupoids. When examples of semi automaton are given usually the books use either the 
set of modulo integers Zn under addition or multiplication we use groupoid built using Zn. 
 
DEFINITION: 
'

Y = (Z1,
s

A Œ¥  ) is called the Smarandache sub semi automaton of 
s
Y  = 
(Z2,

A Œ¥ ) denoted by 
'
s
Y  ‚â§  
s
Y  if Z1 ‚äÇ Z2 and  
s'Œ¥ is the restriction of 
s
Œ¥ on Z1 √ó 
s
A  and 
'
s
Y  has a proper subset H ‚äÇ 
'
s
Y such that H  is a new semi automaton.  
 
Example 6.2.1: Let Z = Z4(2, 1) and A = Z6(2, 1). The Smarandache semi automaton (Z,  
A,  Œ¥) where Œ¥ :  Z  √ó  A ‚Üí Z is given by Œ¥(z, a) = z ‚Ä¢ a (mod 4). We get the following 
table:  
 
Œ¥

We get the following graph for this Smarandache semi automaton.  
 
This has a nice Smarandache sub semi automaton given by the table.

This Smarandache semi automaton is nothing but given by the states {0, 2}. 
 
Example 6.2.2: Let Z = Z3(1, 2) and A = Z4(2, 2) the triple (Z, A, Œ¥) is a Smarandache 
semi automaton with Œ¥ (z, a) = (z * a) (mod 3) ' ‚àó ' the operation in A given by the 
following table:

The graphical representation of the Smarandache semi automaton is  
 
 
Example 6.2.3: Now let Z = Z4(2, 2) and A = Z3(1, 2) we define Œ¥(z, a) = (z ‚àó a) (mod 4) 
‚Äò‚àó‚Äô as in Z. The table for the semi automaton is given by

Thus this has a Smarandache sub semi automaton Z1 given by Z1 = {0, 2} states.

Thus Smarandache automaton enables us to adjoin some more elements which is 
present in A and freely generated by A, as a free groupoid; that will be the case when the 
compositions may not be associative.  
 
Secondly, by using Smarandache automaton we can couple several automaton as

is the Smarandache Automaton.  
 
A machine equipped with this Smarandache Automaton can use any new 
automaton as per need.   
 
We give some examples of Smarandache automaton using Smarandache 
groupoids.  
 
Example 6.2.4: Let Z = Z4 (3, 2), A = B = Z5 (2, 3). K = (Z, A, B, Œ¥, Œª) is a Smarandache 
automaton defined by the following tables where Œ¥ (z, a) = z ‚àó a (mod 4) and  Œª (z, a) = z 
‚àó a (mod 5).  
  
 
Œª 0 1 2 3 4 
0 0 3 1 4 2

1 3 1 3 1 3

3 1 3 1 3 1 

 
 
100 
We obtain the following graph:  
 
 
Thus we see this automaton has 2 Smarandache sub automatons given by the sates {0, 
2} and {1, 3}.  
 
Example 6.2.5: Consider Z5 = Z5(3, 2) , A = Z3(0, 2), B = Z4(2, 3),  Œ¥ (z, a) = z ‚àó a (mod 5), 
Œª (z, a) = z ‚àó a (mod 4). The Smarandache automaton (Z, A, B, Œ¥, Œª) is given by the following 
tables:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This has no proper Smarandache sub automaton.

6.3 Direct Product of Smarandache Automaton  
 
We proceed on to define direct product Smarandache automaton and study about 
them. We can extend the direct product of semi automaton to more than two Smarandache 
automatons.  
 
Using the definition of direct product of two automaton K1 and K2 with an additional 
assumption we define Smarandache series composition of automaton.

The Smarandache automaton composition series denoted by 
1
K || 
2
K  of 
1
K  and 
2
K  
is defined as the series composition of the automaton K1 = (Z1, A1, B1, Œ¥1, Œª1) and K2  = (Z2, 
A2, B2, Œ¥2, Œª2) with 
1
K ||
2
K = (Z1 √ó Z2, A1, B2, Œ¥, Œª) where Œ¥ ((z1, z2), a1) = (Œ¥1(z1, a1), Œ¥2(z2, 
Œª1(z1, a1))  and Œª((z1, z2), a1) = (Œª2(z2, Œª1(z1, a1)) ((z1, z2) ‚àà Z1 √ó Z2, a1 ‚àà A1). 
 
This automaton operates as follows: An input a1 ‚àà A1 operates on z1 and gives a state 
transition into z1' = Œ¥1(z1, a1) and an output b1 = Œª1(z1, a2) ‚àà B1 = A2. This output b1 operates 
on Z2 transforms a z2 ‚àà Z2 into z2'  = Œ¥2(a2, b1) and produces the output  Œª2(z2, b1).  
 
Then 
1
K  || 
2
K  is in the next state (z1', z2') which is clear from the following circuit:  
 
 
 
Now a natural question would be do we have a direct product, which corresponds to 
parallel composition, of the 2 Smarandache automatons 
1
K  and 
2
K .

can be interpreted as two parallel blocks. A1 operates on Zi with output Bi (i ‚àà {1,2}), A1 √ó 
A2 operates on Z1 √ó Z2, the outputs are in B1 √ó B2.  
 
The circuit is given by the following diagram:

A2 = B1

PROBLEM 1:  Define Smarandache minimal automaton and give an example. 
 
PROBLEM 2: Let K2  = {(z1, z2, z3)}, {a1, a2}, {0, 1}, Œ¥, Œª}

PROBLEM 3: Give two examples of a Smarandache automaton using A = {a1, a2} and B = 
{b1, b2, b3} with Z = {z1, z2, z3, z4, z5} with varying Œª and Œ¥.

The Smarandache algebraic structure is a very new subject and there are a number of 
unsolved problems in this new subject. Here we concentrate only on problems connected 
with SGs. A list of problems is given to attract both algebraist students and researchers in the 
SGs. Some of the problems are difficult to solve. 
  
 
PROBLEM 1: For a fixed integer n, n a prime; obtain the number of SGs in the class Z (n). 
 
PROBLEM 2: How many SGs are there in the class Z (n) for a fixed n? 
 
Hint: We know that the number of groupoids in the class Z (n) is bounded by (n ‚Äì 1) (n ‚Äì 2), 
that is |Z (n)| < (n ‚Äì 1) (n ‚Äì 2). 
 
PROBLEM 3: If p is a prime. Prove Zp (m, m) (m < p) has no proper subgroupoid. 
 
PROBLEM 4: Find conditions on Zn (m, m), m and n so that Zn (m, m) has normal 
subgroupoids. 
 
Hint: If m is a prime, n any composite number. Can we say Zn (m, m) have no subgroupoids.

Definition: 
Generally, in any human field, a Smarandache Structure on a set A means a weak 
structure W on A such that there exists a proper subset B ‚äÇ‚äÇ‚äÇ‚äÇ A which is embedded 
with a stronger structure S. 
 
These types of structures occur in our everyday‚Äôs life, that‚Äôs why we study them in 
this book. 
 
Thus, as a particular case: 
A Smarandache Groupoid is a groupoid G which has a proper subset S ‚äÇ‚äÇ‚äÇ‚äÇ G such 
that S under the operation of G is a semigroup.
