Abstracts We compare the way two models of consciousness treat subjective timing. According to the standard "Cartesian Theater"
model, there is a place in the brain where "it all comes together," and the discriminations in all modalities are somehow put into
registration and "presented" for subjective judgment. The timing of the events in this theater determines subjective order. According
to the alternative "Multiple Drafts" model, discriminations are distributed in both space and time in the brain. These events do have
temporal properties, but those properties do not determine subjective order because there is no single, definitive "stream of
consciousness," only a parallel stream of conflicting and continuously revised contents. Four puzzling phenomena that resist
explanation by the Cartesian model are analyzed: (1) a gradual apparent motion phenomenon involving abrupt color change (Kolers &
von Griinau 1976), (2) an illusion of an evenly spaced series of "hops" produced by two or more widely spaced series of taps delivered
to the skin (Geldard & Sherrick's "cutaneous rabbit" [1972]), (3) backwards referral in time, and (4) subjective delay of consciousness
of intention (both reported in this journal by LIbet 1985a; 1987; 1989a). The unexamined assumptions that have always made the
Cartesian Theater so attractive are exposed and dismantled. The Multiple Drafts model provides a better account of the puzzling
phenomena, avoiding the scientific and metaphysical extravagances of the Cartesian Theater: The temporal order of subjective events
is a product of the brain's interpretational processes, not a direct reflection of events making up those processes.

a millionth of a second after they have cast their gaze on me,

When scientific advances contradict "common sense"
Intuitions, the familiar Ideas often linger on, not just
outliving their usefulness but even confusing the scien-
tists whose discoveries ought to have overthrown them.
Diagnosed here is a ubiquitous error of thinking that
arises from just such a misplaced allegiance to familiar
images, Illustrated with examples drawn from recent
work in psychology and neuroscience. Although this Is a
"theoretical" paper, It is addressed especially to those
who think, mistakenly, that they have no theories and no
need for theories. We show how uncontroversial facts
about the spatial and temporal properties of information-
bearing events In the brain require us to abandon a family
of entrenched intuitions about "the stream of conscious-
ness" and its relation to events occurring in the brain.
In Section 1, we Introduce two models of conscious-
ness, the standard Cartesian Theater and our alternative,
the Multiple Drafts model, briefly describing four phe-
nomena of temporal Interpretation that raise problems for
the standard model. Two of these, drawn from the re-
search of Libet, have been extensively debated on meth-
odological grounds, but concealed In the controversy
surrounding them are the mistaken assumptions we ex-
pose. In Section 2, we diagnose these Intuitive but er-
roneous Ideas and exhibit their power to create confusion
in relatively simple contexts. We demonstrate the superi-
ority of the Multiple Drafts model of consciousness by
showing how it avoids the Insoluble problems faced by
versions of the Cartesian Theater. In Section 3, we show
how covert allegiance to the Cartesian Theater has misled
Interpreters of Libet's phenomena and how the Multiple
Drafts model avoids these confusions.
1. Two models of consciousness
1.1. Cartesian materialism: Is there a "central obserwer" in
the brain? Wherever there is a conscious mind, there is a
point of view. A conscious mind is an observer who takes
in the information that Is available at a particular (roughly)
continuous sequence of times and places In the universe.
A mind is thus a locus of subjectivity, a thing it is like
something to be (Farrell 1950; Nagel 1974). What it Is like
to be that thing is partly determined by what Is available
to be observed or experienced along the trajectory
through space-time of that moving point of view, which
for most practical purposes Is just that: a point. For
instance, the startling dissociation of the sound and ap-
pearance of distant fireworks Is explained by the different

Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
transmission speeds of sound and light, arriving at the
observer (at that point) at different times, even though
they left the source simultaneously. But if we ask where
precisely in the brain that point of view is located, the
simple assumptions that work so well on larger scales of
space and time break down. It is now quite clear that
there is no single point in the brain where all information
funnels In, and this fact has some far from obvious
consequences.
Light travels much faster than sound, as the fireworks
example reminds us, but it takes longer for the brain to
process visual stimuli than to process auditory stimuli. As
Poppel (1985/1988) has pointed out, thanks to these
counterbalancing differences, the "horizon of simul-
taneity" Is about 10 meters: Light and sound that leave
the same point about 10 meters from the observer's sense
organs produce neural responses that are "centrally avail-
able" at the same time. Can we make this figure more
precise? There is a problem. The problem is not just
measuring the distances from the external event to the
sense organs, or the transmission speeds in the various
media, or allowing for individual differences. The more
fundamental problem Is deciding what to count as the
"finish line" In the brain. Poppel obtained his result by
comparing behavioral measures: mean reaction times
(button-pushing) to auditory and visual stimuli. The dif-
ference ranges between 30 and 40 msec, the time It takes
sound to travel approximately 10 meters (the time It takes
light to travel 10 meters is only infinitesimally different
from zero). Poppel used a peripheral finish line - external
behavior - but our natural Intuition is that the experience
of the light and sound happens between the time the
vibrations strike our sense organs and the time we man-
age to push the button to signal that experience. And It
happens somewhere centrally, somewhere In the brain
on the excited paths between the sense organ and muscles
that move the finger. It seems that If we could say exactly
where the experience happened, we could infer exactly
when It happened. And vice versa: If we could say ex-
actly when it happened, we could infer where In the brain
conscious experience was located.
This picture of how conscious experience must sit In the
brain Is a natural extrapolation of the familiar and unde-
niable fact that for macroscopic time intervals, we can
Indeed order events into the categories "not yet ob-
served" and "already observed" by locating the observer
and plotting the motions of the vehicles of information
relative to that point. But when we aspire to extend this
method to explain phenomena involving very short inter-
vals, we encounter a logical difficulty: If the "point" of
view of the observer is spread over a rather large volume
In the observer's brain, the observer's own subjective
sense of sequence and simultaneity must be determined
by something other than a unique "order of arrival"
because order of arrival Is Incompletely defined until we
specify the relevant destination. If A beats B to one finish
line but B beats A to another, which result fixes subjective
sequence In consciousness (cf. Minsky 1985, p. 61)?
Which point or points of "central availability" would
"count" as a determiner of experienced order, and why?
Consider the time course of normal visual information
processing. Visual stimuli evoke trains of events In the
cortex that gradually yield content of greater and greater
specificity. At different times and different places, various
"decisions" or "judgments" are made: More literally, parts
of the brain are caused to go into states that differentially
respond to different features, for example, first mere
onset of stimulus, then shape, later color (In a different
pathway), motion, and eventually object recognition. It Is
tempting to suppose that there must be some place in the
brain where "It all comes together" in a multimodal
representation or display that is definitive of the content
of conscious experience in at least this sense: The tem-
poral properties of the events that occur in that particular
locus of representation determine the temporal proper-
ties - of sequence, simultaneity, and real-time onset, for
instance â€” of the subjective "stream of consciousness."
This is the error of thinking we intend to expose. Where
does it all "come together?" The answer, we propose, is
nowhere. Some of the contentful states distributed
around in the brain soon die out, leaving no traces. Others
do leave traces,, on subsequent verbal reports of experi-
ence and memory, on "semantic readiness" and other
varieties of perceptual set, on emotional state, behavioral
proclivities, and so forth. Some of these effects - for
instance, influences on subsequent verbal reports - are at
least symptomatic of consciousness. But there Is no one
place In the brain through which all these causal trains
must pass to deposit their contents "In consciousness" (see
also Damasio 1989a).
The brain must be able to "bind" or "correlate" and
"compare" various separately discriminated contents, but
the processes that accomplish these unifications are
themselves distributed, not gathered at some central
decision point, and as a result, the "point of view of the
observer" Is spatially smeared. If brains computed at near
the speed of light, as computers do, this spatial smear
would be negligible. But given the relatively slow trans-
mission and computation speeds of neurons, the spatial
distribution of processes creates significant temporal
smear - ranging, as we shall see, up to several hundred
milliseconds - within which range the normal common-
sense assumptions about timing and arrival at the ob-
server need to be replaced. For many tasks, the human
capacity to-make conscious discriminations of temporal
order drops to chance when the difference in onset Is on
the order of 50 msec (depending on stimulus conditions),
but this variable threshold Is the result of complex Inter-
actions, not a basic limit on the brain's capacity to make
the specialized order judgments required in the Interpre-
tation and coordination of perceptual and motor phenom-
ena. We need other principles to explain the ways subjec-
tive temporal order is composed, especially in cases in which
the brain must cope with rapid sequences occurring at the
limits of its powers of temporal resolution. As usual, the
performance of the brain when put under strain provides
valuable clues about Its general modes of operation.
Descartes, early (1664) to think seriously about what
must happen Inside the body of the observer, elaborated
an Idea that Is superficially so natural and appealing that it
has permeated our thinking about consciousness ever
since and permitted us to defer considering the perplex-
ities - until now. Descartes decided that the brain did
have a center: the pineal gland, which served as the
gateway to the conscious mind. This was the only organ In
the brain that was in the midline, rather than paired, with
left and right versions. The pineal looked different, and
because its function was then quite inscrutable (and still
184

Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
is), Descartes posited a role for it: For a person to be
conscious of something, traffic from the senses had to
arrive at this station, where it thereupon caused a special
- indeed magical - transaction to occur between the
person's material brain and immaterial mind. When the
conscious mind then decided on a course of bodily action,
it sent a message back "down" to the body via the pineal
gland. The pineal gland, then, is like a theater in which
information is displayed for perusal by the mind.
Descartes' vision of the pineal's role as the turnstile of
consciousness (we might call it the Cartesian bottleneck)
is hopelessly wrong. The problems that face Descartes'
interactionistic dualism, with its systematically inexplica-
ble traffic between the realm of the material and the
postulated realm of the immaterial, were already well
appreciated in Descartes' own day, and centuries of
reconsideration have only hardened the verdict: The idea
of the Ghost in the Machine, as Ryle (1949) aptly pilloried
it, is a nonsolution to the problems of mind. But whereas
materialism of one sort or another is now a received
opinion approaching unanimity,l even the most sophisti-
cated materialists today often forget that once Descartes'
ghostly res cogitans is discarded, there is no longer a role
for a centralized gateway, or indeed for any functional
center to the brain. The brain itself is Headquarters, the
place where the ultimate observer is, but it is a mistake to
believe that the brain has any deeper headquarters, any
inner sanctum, arrival at which is the necessary or suffi-
cient condition for conscious experience.
Let us call the idea of such a centered locus in the brain
Cartesian materialism, because it is the view one arrives
at when one discards Descartes' dualism but fails to
discard the associated imagery of a central (but material)
theater where "it all comes together." Once made ex-
plicit, it is obvious that this is a bad idea, not only because,
as a matter of empirical fact, nothing in the functional
neuroanatomy of the brain suggests such a general meet-
ing place, but also because positing such a center would
apparently be the first step in an infinite regress of too-
powerful homunculi. If all the tasks Descartes assigned to
the immaterial mind have to be taken over by a "con-
scious" subsystem, its own activity will either be system-
atically mysterious or decomposed into the activity of
further subsystems that begin to duplicate the tasks of the
"nonconscious" parts of the whole brain. Whether or not
anyone explicitly endorses Cartesian materialism, some
ubiquitous assumptions of current theorizing presuppose
this dubious view. We show that the persuasive imagery
of the Cartesian Theater, in its materialistic form, keeps
reasserting itself, in diverse guises, and for a variety of
ostensibly compelling reasons. Thinking in its terms is not
an innocuous shortcut; it is a bad habit. One of its most
seductive implications is the assumption that a distinction
can always be drawn between "not yet observed" and
"already observed." But, as we have just argued, this
distinction cannot be drawn once we descend to the scale
that places us within the boundaries of the spatiotemporal
volume in which the various discriminations are accom-
plished. Inside this expanded "point of view," spatial and
temporal distinctions lose the meanings they have in
broader contexts.
The crucial features of the Cartesian Theater model can
best be seen by contrasting it with the alternative we
propose, the Multiple Drafts model:
All perceptual operations, and indeed all operations of
thought and action, are accomplished by multitrack pro-
cesses of interpretation and elaboration that occur over
hundreds of milliseconds, during which time various
additions, incorporations, emendations, and overwritings
of content can occur, in various orders. Feature-
detections or discriminations have to be made only once.
That is, once a localized, specialized "observation" has
been made, the information content thus fixed does not
have to be sent somewhere else to be ^discriminated by
some "master" discriminator. In other words, it does not
lead to a re-presentation of the already discriminated
feature for the benefit of the audience in the Cartesian
Theater. How a localized discrimination contributes to,
and what effect it has on the prevailing brain state (and
thus awareness) can change from moment to moment,
depending on what else is going on in the brain. Drafts of
experience can be revised at a great rate, and no one is
more correct than another. Each reflects the situation at
the time it is generated. These spatially and temporally
distributed content-fixations are themselves precisely lo-
catable in both space and time, but their onsets do not
mark the onset of awareness of their content. It is always
an open question whether any particular content thus
discriminated will eventually appear as an element
in conscious experience. These distributed content-
discriminations yield, over the course of time, something
rather like a narrative stream or sequence, subject to
continual editing by many processes distributed around
in the brain, and continuing indefinitely into the future
(cf. Calvin's [1990] model of consciousness as "scenario-
spinning"). This stream of contents is only rather like a
narrative because of its multiplicity; at any point in time
there are multiple "drafts" of narrative fragments at
various stages of "editing" in various places in the brain.
Probing this stream at different intervals produces differ-
ent effects, elicits different narrative accounts from the
subject. If one delays the probe too long (overnight, say)
the result is apt to be no narrative left at all - or else a
narrative that has been digested or "rationally recon-
structed" to the point that it has minimal integrity. If one
probes "too early," one may gather data on how early a
particular discrimination is achieved in the stream, but at
the cost of disrupting the normal progression of the
stream. Most important, the Multiple Drafts model
avoids the tempting mistake of supposing that there must
be a single narrative (the "final" or "published" draft) that
is canonical - that represents the actual stream of con-
sciousness of the subject, whether or not the experi-
menter (or even the subject) can gain access to it.
The main points at which this model disagrees with the
competing tacit model of the Cartesian Theater, may be
summarized:
1. Localized discriminations are not precursors of
re-presentations of the discriminated content for consid-
eration by a more central discriminator.
2. The objective temporal properties of discriminatory
states may be determined, but they do not determine
temporal properties of subjective experience.
3. The "stream of consciousness" is not a single,, defini-
tive narrative. It is a parallel stream of conflicting and
continuously revised contents, no one narrative thread of
which can be singled out as canonical - as the true version
of conscious experience.

Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
The different implications of these two models will be
exhibited by considering several puzzling phenomena
that seem at first to indicate that the mind "plays tricks
with time." (Other implications of the Multiple Drafts
model are examined at length in Dennett 1991b.)
1.2. Some "temporal anomalies" of consciousness. Un-
der various conditions people report experiences in
which the temporal ordering of the elements in their
consciousness, or the temporal relation of those elements
to concurrent activity in their brains, seems to be anoma-
lous or even paradoxical. Some theorists (Libet 1982;
1985a; Popper & Eccles 1977) have argued that these
temporal anomalies are proof of the existence of an imma-
terial mind that interacts with the brain in physically
inexplicable fashion. Others (Goodman 1978; Libet
1985b), although eschewing any commitment to dualism,
have offered interpretations of the phenomena that seem
to defy the accepted temporal sequence of cause and
effect. Most recently, another theorist (Penrose 1989 -
see also multiple book review in BBS 13 (4) 1990) has
suggested that a materialistic explanation of these phe-
nomena would require a revolution in fundamental
physics. These radical views have been vigorously crit-
icized, but the criticisms have overlooked the possibility
that the appearance of anomaly in these cases results from
conceptual errors that are so deeply anchored in everyday
thinking that even many of the critics have fallen into the
same traps. We agree with Libet and others that these
temporal anomalies are significant, but we hold a differ-
ent opinion about what they signify.
We focus on four examples, summarized below. Two,
drawn from the work of Libet, have received the most
attention and provoked the most radical speculation, but
because technical criticisms of his experiments and their
interpretation raise doubts about the existence of the
phenomena he claims to have discovered, we begin with a
discussion of two simpler phenomena whose existence
has not been questioned but whose interpretation raises
the same fundamental problems. We use these simpler
cases to illustrate the superiority of the Multiple Drafts
model to the traditional Cartesian Theater model, and
then apply the conclusions drawn in the more compli-
cated setting of the controversies surrounding Libet's
work. Our argument is that even if Libet's phenomena
were not known to exist, theory can readily account for
the possibility of phenomena of this pseudo-anomalous
sort, and even predict them.
hie Many experiments have demonstrated the
existence of apparent motion, or the phi phenomenon
(Kolers & von Griinau 1976; see also Kolers 1972; van der
Waals & Roelofs 1930; and the discussion in Goodman
1978). If two or more small spots separated by as much as
4 degrees of visual angle are briefly lit in rapid succession,
a single spot will seem to move. This is the basis of our
experience of motion in motion pictures and television.
First studied systematically by Wertheimer (1912; for a
historical account, see Kolers 1972; Sarris 1989), phi has
been subjected to many variations; one of the most
striking is reported in Kolers and von Griinau (1976). The
philosopher Nelson Goodman had asked Kolers whether
the phi phenomenon would persist if the two illuminated
spots were different in color, and if so, what would
happen to the color of "the" spot as "it" moved? Would the
illusion of motion disappear, to be replaced by two sepa-
rately flashing spots? Would the illusory "moving" spot
gradually change from one color to another, tracing a
trajectory around the color wheel? The answer, when
Kolers and von Griinau performed the experiments, was
striking: The spot seems to begin moving and then to
change color abruptly in the middle of its illusory passage
toward the second location. Goodman wondered: "How
are we able . . . to fill in the spot at the intervening place-
times along a path running from the first to the second
flash before that second flash occurs?" (1978, p. 73; the
same question can be raised about any phi, but the color-
switch in midpassage vividly brings out the problem.)
Unless there is p recognition, the illusory content cannot
be created until after some identification of the second
spot occurs in the brain. But if this identification of the
second spot is already "in conscious experience" would it
not be too late to interpose the illusory color-switching-
while-moving scene between the conscious experience of
spot 1 and the conscious experience of spot 2? How does
the brain accomplish this sleight-of-hand? Van der Waals
and Roelofs (1930) proposed that the intervening motion
is produced retrospectively, built only after the second
flash occurs, and "projected backwards in time" (Good-
man 1978, p. 74), a form of words reminiscent of Libet's
"backwards referral in time." But what does it mean that
this experienced motion is "projected backwards in
time"?
cutaneous "rabbit" The subject's arm rests
cushioned on a table, and mechanical square-wave tap-
pers are placed at two or three locations along the arm, up
to afoot apart (Geldard & Sherrick 1972; see also Geldard
1977; Geldard & Sherrick 1983; 1986). A series of rhyth-
mical taps is delivered, for example, 5 at the wrist fol-
lowed by 2 near the elbow and then 3 more on the upper
arm. These taps are delivered with interstimulus inter-
vals of between 50 and 200 msec. So a train of taps might
last less than a second, or as long as two or three seconds.
The astonishing effect is that the taps seem to the subjects
to travel in regular sequence over equidistant points up
the arm - as if a little animal were hopping along the arm.
Now how did the brain know that after the 5 taps on the
wrist there were going to be some taps near the elbow?
The experienced "departure" of the taps from the wrist
begins with the second one, yet in catch trials in which the
later elbow taps are never delivered, all five wrist taps are
felt at the wrist in the expected manner. The brain
obviously cannot "know" about a tap at the elbow until
after it happens. Perhaps, one might speculate, the brain
delays the conscious experience until after all the taps
have been "received" and then, somewhere upstream of
the seat of consciousness (whatever that is), revises the
data to fit a theory of motion, and sends the edited version
on to consciousness. But would the brain always delay
response to one tap in case more came? If not, how does it
"know" when to delay?
Ce "Referral backwards in time." Since Penfield and Jas-
per (1954) it has been known that direct electrical stimula-
tion of locations on the somatosensory cortex can induce
sensations on corresponding parts of the body. For in-
stance, stimulation of a point on the left somatosensory
186
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
cortex, can produce the sensation of a brief tingle in the
subject's right hand. Libet compared the time course of
such cortically induced tingles to similar sensations proâ„¢
duced in the more usual way, by applying a brief electrical
pulse to the hand itself (Libet 1965; 1981; 1982; 1985a;
Libet et al. 1979; see also Churchland 1981a; 1981b;
Dennett 1979; Honderich 1984; Popper & Eccles 1977).
He argued that although in each case it took considerable
time (approximately 500 msec) to achieve "neuronal ade-
quacy" (the stage at which cortical processes culminate to
yield a conscious experience of a tingle), when the hand
itself was stimulated, the experience was "automat-
ically , . . referred backwards in time."
Most strikingly, Libet reported instances in which a
subject's left cortex was stimulated before his left hand
was stimulated, something one would tend to expect to
give rise to two felt tingles: First right hand (cortically
induced) and then left hand. In fact, however, the subjec-
tive report was reversed: "first left, then right." Even in
cases of simultaneous stimulation, one might have
thought, the left-hand tingle should be felt second, be-
cause of the additional distance (close to a meter) nerve
impulses from the left hand must travel to the brain.
Libet interprets his results as raising a serious chal-
lenge to materialism: "A dissociation between the timings
of the corresponding 'mental' and 'physical' events would
seem to raise serious though not insurmountable difficul-
ties for the . . . theory ofpsychoneural identity" (1979, p.
222). According to Eccles, this challenge cannot be met:
This antedating procedure does not seem to be explica-
ble by any neurophysiological process, Presumably it is
a strategy that has been learnt by the self-conscious
mind . . . the antedating sensory experience is attrib-
utable to the ability of the self-conscious mind to make
slight temporal adjustments, i.e., to play tricks with
time. (Popper & Eccles 1977, p. 364)
BB Subjecfiwe delay of consciousness of intention* In
other experiments, Libet asked subjects to make "spon-
taneous" decisions to flex one hand at the wrist while
noting the position of a revolving spot (the "second hand"
on a clock, in effect) at the precise time they formed the
intention (Libet 1985a; 1987; 1989a; see also the accom-
panying commentaries). Subjects' reports of these subjec-
tive simultaneities were then plotted against the timing of
relevant electrophysiological events in their brains. Libet
found evidence that these "conscious decisions" lagged
between 350 and 400 msec behind the onset of "readiness
potentials" he was able to record from scalp electrodes,
which, he claims, tap the neural events that determine
the voluntary actions performed. He concludes that "ce-
rebral initiation of a spontaneous voluntary act begins
unconsciously" (1985a, p. 529). That one's consciousness
might lag behind the brain processes that control one's
body seems to some an unsettling and even depressing
prospect, ruling out a real (as opposed to illusory) "execu-
tive role" for "the conscious self." (See the discussions by
many commentators in BBS: Eccles 1985; Mortenson
1985; Van Gulick 1985; and in Pagels 1988, pp. 233ff; and
Calvin 1990, pp. 80-81. But see, for a view close to ours,
Hamad 1982.)
In none of these cases would there be prima facie
evidence of any anomaly were we to forego the oppor-
tunity to record the subjects' verbal reports of their
experiences and subject them to semantic analysis. No
sounds appear to issue from heads before lips move, nor
do hands move before the brain events that purportedly
cause them, nor do events occur in the cortex in advance
of the stimuli that are held to be their source. Viewed
strictly as the internal and external behavior of a biolog-
ically implemented control system for a body, the events
observed and clocked in the experiments mentioned
exhibit no apparent violations of everyday mechanical
causation â€” of the sort to which Galilean/Newtonian
physics provides the standard approximate model. Libet
said it first: "It is important to realize that these subjective
referrals and corrections are apparently taking place at
the level of the mental 'sphere'; they are not apparent, as
such, in the activities at neural levels" (1982, p. 241).
Put more neutrally (pending clarification of what Libet
means by the "mental 'sphere'"), only through the sub-
jects' verbalizations about their subjective experiences do
we gain access to a perspective from which the anomalies
can appear.2 Once their verbalizations (including com-
municative button-pushes, etc.; Dennett 1982), are inter-
preted as a sequence of speech acts, their content yields a
time series, the subjective sequence of the stream of
consciousness. One can then attempt to put this series
into registration with another time series, the objective
sequence of observed events in the environment and in the
nervous system. It is the apparent failures of registration,
holding constant the assumption that causes precede
their effects, that constitute the supposed anomalies (cf.
Hoy 1982).
One could, then, "make the problems disappear" by
simply refusing to take introspective reports seriously.
Although some hearty behaviorists may cling comfortably
to the abstemious principle, "Eschew content!" (Dennett
1978), the rest of us prefer to^accept the challenge to make
sense of what Libet calls "a primary phenomenological
aspect of our human existence in relation to brain func-
tion" (1985a, p. 534).
The reports by subjects about their different experi-
ences . . . were not theoretical constructs but empiri-
cal observations. . . . The method of introspection
may have its limitations, but it can be used appropri-
ately within the framework of natural science, and it is
absolutely essential if one is trying to get some experi-
mental data on the mind-brain problem. (Libet 1987,
p. 785)
In each example an apparent dislocation in time
threatens the prima facie plausible thesis that our con-
scious perceptions are caused by events in our nervous
systems, and our conscious acts, in turn, cause events in
our nervous systems that control our bodily acts. To first
appearances, the anomalous phenomena show that these
two standard causal links cannot be sustained unless we
abandon a foundational - some would say a logically
necessary - principle: Causes precede their effects. It
seems that in one case (subjective delay of awareness of
intention), our conscious intentions occur too late to be
the causes of their bodily expressions or implementa-
tions, and in the other cases, percepts occur too early to
have been caused by their stimuli. The vertiginous alter-
native, that something in the brain (or "conscious self")
can "play tricks with time" by "projecting" mental events
backwards in time, would require us to abandon the
foundational principle that causes precede their effects.

Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
There is a widespread conviction that no such revolu-
tionary consequence follows from any of these phenom-
ena, a conviction we share. But some of the influential
arguments that have been offered in support of this
conviction persist in a commitment to the erroneous
presuppositions that made the phenomena appear anom-
alous in the first place. These presuppositions are all the
more insidious because although in their overt, blatant
forms they are roundly disowned by one and all, they
creep unnoticed back into place, distorting analysis and
blinding theory-builders to other explanations.
action: Diagnosing the tempting
2.1 â€¢ ThÂ® representation of temporal properties wersus the
temporal properties of representations. The brain, as the
control system responsible for solving a body's real-time
problems of interaction with the environment, is under
significant time pressure. It must often arrange to modu-
late its output in light of its input within a time window
that leaves no slack for delays. In fact, many acts can be
only ballistically initiated; there is no time for feedback to
adjust the control signals. Other tasks, such as speech
perception, would be beyond the physical limits of the
brain's machinery if they did not use ingenious anticipa-
tory strategies that feed on redundancies in the input
(Libermann 1970).
How, then, does the brain keep track of the temporal
information it manifestly needs? Consider the following
problem: Because the toe-brain distance is much greater
than the hip-brain distance, or the shoulder-brain dis-
tance or the forehead-brain distance, stimuli delivered
simultaneously at these different sites will arrive at Head-
quarters in staggered succession, if travel-speed is con-
stant along all paths. How (one might be tempted to ask)
does the brain "ensure central simultaneity of representa-
tion for distally simultaneous stimuli"? This encourages
one to hypothesize some "delay loop" mechanism that
could store the early arrivers until they could be put "in
synch" with the latecomers, but this is a mistake. The
brain should not solve this problem, for an obvious
engineering reason: It squanders precious time by com-
mitting the full range of operations to a "worst case"
schedule. Why should important signals from the fore-
head (for instance) dawdle in the anteroom just because
there might someday be an occasion when concurrent
signals from the toes need to be compared to (or "bound
to") them?
The brain sometimes uses "buffer memories" to
cushion the interface between its internal processes and
the asynchronous outside world (Neisser 1967; Newell et
al. 1989; Sperling 1960), but there are also ways for the
brain to use the temporal information it needs without the
delays required for imposing a master synchrony. The
basic design principle is well illustrated in an example in
which a comparable problem is confronted and (largely)
solved, though on a vastly different temporal and spatial
scale.
Consider the communication difficulties faced by the
far-flung British Empire before the advent of radio and
telegraph, as illustrated by the Battle of New Orleans. On
January 8, 1815, 15 days after the truce was signed in
Belgium, more than a thousand British soldiers were
killed in this needless battle. We can use this debacle to
see how the system worked. Suppose on Day 1 the treaty
is signed in Belgium, with the news sent by land and sea
to America, India, Africa. On Day 15 the battle is fought
in New Orleans, and news of the defeat is sent by land and
sea to England, India, and so on. On Day 20, too late, the
news of the treaty (and the order to surrender) arrives in
New Orleans. On Day 35, let's suppose, the news of the
defeat arrives in Calcutta, but the news of the treaty
doesn't arrive there until Day 40 (via a slow overland
route). To the commander-in-chief in Calcutta, the battle
would "seem" to have been fought before the treaty was
signed - were it not for the practice of dating letters,
which permits him to make the necessary correction.
These communicators solved their problems of com-
municating information about time by embedding repre-
sentations of the relevant time information in the content
of their signals, so that the arrival time of the signals
themselves was strictly irrelevant to the information they
carried. A date written at the head of a letter (or a dated
postmark on the envelope) gives the recipient informa-
tion about when it was sent, information that survives any
delay in arrival.3 This distinction between time repre-
sented (by the postmark) and time of representing (the
day the letter arrives) is an instance of a familiar distinc-
tion between content and vehicle, and although the
details of this particular solution are not available to the
brain's communicators (because they don't "know the
date" when they send their messages), the general princi-
ple of the content/vehicle distinction is relevant to
information-processing models of the brain in ways that
have not been well appreciated.4
In general, we must distinguish features of represent-
ings from the features of representeds (Neumann 1990);
someone can shout "softly, on tiptoe" at the top of his
lungs, there are gigantic pictures of microscopic objects
and oil paintings of artists making charcoal sketches. The
top sentence of a written description of a standing man
need not describe his head, nor the bottom sentence his
feet. To suppose otherwise is confusedly to superimpose
two different spaces: The representing space and the
represented space. The same applies to time. Consider
the spoken phrase, "a bright, brief flash of red light." The
beginning of if is "a bright" and the end of it is "red light."
Those portions of that speech event are not themselves
representations of onsets or terminations of a brief red
flash (cÂ£ Efron 1967, p. 714). No informing event in the
nervous system can have zero duration (any more than it
can have zero spatial extent), so it has an onset and
termination separated by some amount of time. If it
represents an event in experience, then the event it
represents must itself have nonzero duration, an onset, a
middle, and a termination. But there is no reason to
suppose that the beginning of the representing repre-
sents the beginning of the represented.5
Similarly, the representing by the brain of "A before B"
does not have to be accomplished by first:
a representing of A,
followed by:
a representing of B.
"B after A" is an example of a (spoken) vehicle that
188
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

Dennett & Kinsbourae: Time and the observer
represents A as being before B, and the brain can avail
itself of the same freedom of temporal placement. What
matters for the brain is not necessarily when individual
representing events happen in various parts of the brain
(as long as they happen in time to control the things that
need controlling!) but their temporal content. That is,
what matters is that the brain can proceed to control
events "under the assumption that A happened before B"
whether or not the information that A has happened
enters the relevant system of the brain and gets recog-
nized as such before or after the information that B has
happened. (Recall the commander-in-chief in Calcutta:
First he is informed of the battle, and then he is informed
of the truce, but because he can extract from this the
information that the truce came first, he can act accord-
ingly.) Systems in various locations in the brain can, in
principle, avail themselves of similar information-
processing, and that is why fixing the exact time of onset of
some representing element in some place in the brain
does not provide a temporal landmark relative to which
other elements in the subjective sequence can - or must -
be placed.
How are temporal properties really inferred by the
brain? Systems of "date stamps" or "postmarks" are not
theoretically impossible (Glynn 1990), but there is a
cheaper, less foolproof but biologically more plausible
way: by what we might call content-sensitive settling. A
useful analogy would be the film studio where the sound
track is "synchronized" with the film. The various seg-
ments of audio tape may by themselves have lost all their
temporal markers, so that there is no simple, mechanical
way of putting them into apt registration with the images.
But sliding them back and forth relative to the film and
looking for convergences, will usually swiftly home in on a
"best fit." The slap of the slateboard at the beginning of
each take provides a double saliency, an auditory and a
visual clap, to slide into synchrony, pulling the rest of the
tape and the frames into position at the same time. But
there are typically so many points of mutually salient
correspondence that this conventional saliency at the
beginning of each take is just a handy redundancy. Get-
ting the registration right depends on the content of the
film and the tape, but not on sophisticated analysis of the
content. An editor who knew no Japanese would find
synchronizing a Japanese soundtrack to a Japanese film
difficult and tedious but not impossible. Moreover, the
temporal order of the stages of the process of putting the
pieces into registration is independent of the content of
the product; the editor can organize scene three before
organizing scene two, and in principle could even do the
entire job running the segments "in reverse."
Quite "stupid" processes can do similar jiggling and
settling in the brain. The computation of depth in
random-dot stereograms (Julesz 1971) is a spatial problem
for which we can readily envisage temporal analogues. If
the system receives stereo pairs of images, the globally
optimal registration can be found without first having to
subject each data array to an elaborate process of feature
extraction. There are enough lowest-level coincidences of
saliency - the individual dots in a random dot stereogram
â€” to dictate a solution. In principle, then, the brain can
solve some of its problems of temporal inference by such a
process, drawing data not from left and right eyes, but
from whatever information-sources are involved in a
process requiring temporal judgments. (See Gallistel,
1990, especially pp. 539-49, for a discussion of the re-
quirements for "spatiotemporal specification.")
Two important points follow from this. First, such
temporal inferences can be drawn (such temporal dis-
criminations can be made) by comparing the (low-level)
content of several data arrays, and this real time process
need not occur in the temporal order that its product
eventually represents. Second, once such a temporal
inference has been drawn, which may be before high-
level features have been extracted by other processes, it
does not have to be drawn again! There does not have to
be a later representation in which the high-level features
are "presented" in a real time sequence for the benefit of a
second sequence-judger. In other words, having drawn
inferences from these juxtapositions of temporal informa-
tion, the brain can go on to represent the results in any
format that fits its needs and resources - not necessarily a
format in which "time is used to represent time."
There remains a nagging suspicion that whereas the
brain may take advantage of this representational free-
dom for other properties, it cannot do so for the property
of temporal sequence. Mellor explicitly enunciates this
assumption, deeming it too obvious to need support:
Suppose for example I see one event e precede an-
other, e*. I must first see e and then e*, my seeing of e
being somehow recollected in my seeing of e*. That is,
my seeing of e affects my seeing of e*: This is what
makes me - rightly or wrongly - see e precede 0*rather
than the other way round. But seeing e precede e*
means seeing e first. So the causal order of my percep-
tions of these events, by fixing the temporal order I
perceive them to have, fixes the temporal order of the
perceptions themselves. . . . the striking fact . . .
should be noticed, namely that perceptions of temporal
order need temporally ordered perceptions. No other
property or relation has to be thus embodied in percep-
tions of it [our emphasis]: perceptions of shape and
colour, for example, need not themselves be corre-
spondingly shaped or coloured. (Mellor 1981, p. 8)
We believe this is false, but there is something right
about it. Because the fundamental function of representa-
tion in the brain is to control behavior in real time, the
timing of representings is to some degree essential to their
task, in two ways. First, the timing may, at the outset of a
perceptual process, be what determines the content.
Consider how to distinguish a spot moving from right to
left from a spot moving from left to right on a motion
picture screen. The only difference between the two may
be the temporal order in which two frames (or more) are
projected. If the brain determines "first A, then B" the
spot is seen as moving in one direction; if the brain
determines "first B, then A" the spot is seen as moving in
the opposite direction. This discrimination is, then, as a
matter of logic, based on the brain's capacity to make a
temporal order judgment of a particular level of resolu-
tion. Motion picture frames are usually exposed at the
rate of 24 per second, and so the visual system can resolve
order between stimuli that occur within about 50 msec.
This means that the actual temporal properties of signals -
their onset times, their velocity in the system, and hence
their arrival times - must be accurately controlled until
such a discrimination is made. But once it is made locally
by some circuit in the visual system (even as peripherally
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2
189

Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
as the ganglion cells of the rabbit's retina! - Barlow &
Levick 1965), the content "from left to right" can then be
sent, in a temporally sloppy way, anywhere in the brain
where this directional information might be put to use.
This way one can explain the otherwise puzzling fact that
at interstimulus intervals at which people are unable to
perform above chance on temporal order judgments, they
perform flawlessly on other judgments that logically call
for the same temporal acuity. Thus Efron (1973) showed
that subjects could easily distinguish sounds, flashes, and
vibrations that differed only in the order in which two
component stimuli occurred at a fraction of the inter-
stimulus interval at which they can explicitly specify their
order.
A second constraint on timing has already been noted
parenthetically above: It does not matter in what order
representations occur so long as they occur in time to
contribute to the control of the appropriate behavior. The
function of a representing may depend on meeting a
deadline, which is a temporal property of the vehicle
doing the representing. This is particularly evident in
such time-pressured environments as the imagined
Strategic Defense Initiative. The problem is not how to
make computer systems represent, accurately, missile
launches, but how to represent a missile launch accu-
rately during the brief time while one can still do some-
thing about it. A message that a missile was launched at
6:04:23.678 A.M. EST may accurately represent the time
of launch forever, but its utility may utterly lapse at 6:05
A.M. EST. For any task of control, then, there is a
temporal control window within which the temporal
parameters of representings may in principle be moved
around ad lib.
The deadlines that limit such windows are not fixed,
but rather depend on the task. If, rather than intercepting
missiles, you are writing your memoirs or answering
questions at the Watergate hearings (Neisser 1981), you
can recover the information you need about the sequence
of events in your life to control your actions in almost any
order, and you can take your time drawing inferences.
These two factors explain what is plausible in Mellor's
claim, without supporting the invited conclusion that all
perceptions of temporal order must be accomplished in a
single place by a process that observes seriatim a succes-
sion of "perceptions" or other representations. Once the
perceptual processes within an observer have begun to do
their work, providing the necessary discriminations,
there is no point in undoing their work to provide a job for
a yet more interior observer.
Causes must precede effects. This fundamental princi-
ple ensures that temporal control windows are bounded
at both ends: by the earliest time at which information
could arrive in the system, and by the latest time at which
information could contribute causally to the control of a
particular behavior. Moreover, the principle applies to
the multiple distributed processes that achieve such con-
trol. Any particular process that requires information
from some source must indeed wait for that information; it
can't get there till it gets there. This is what rules out
"magical" or precognitive explanations of the color-
switching phi phenomenon, for example. The content
green spot cannot be attributed to any event, conscious or
unconscious, until the light from the green spot has
reached the eye and triggered the normal neural activity
in the visual system up to the level at which the discrimi-
nation of green is accomplished. Moreover, all content
reported or otherwise expressed in subsequent behavior
must have been "present" (in the relevant place in the
brain, but not necessarily in consciousness) in time to
have contributed causally to that behavior. For instance,
if a subject in an experiment says "dog" in response to a
visual stimulus, we can work backwards from the be-
havior, which was clearly controlled by a process that had
the content dog (unless the subject says "dog" to every
stimulus, or spends the day saying "dog dog dog . . . "
etc.) And since it takes on the order of 100 msec to execute
a speech intention of this sort, we can be quite sure that
the content dog was present in (roughly) the language
areas of the brain by 100 msec before the utterance.
Working from the other end, we can determine the
earliest time the content dog could have been computed
or extracted by the visual system from the retinal input,
and even, perhaps, follow its creation and subsequent
trajectory through the visual system and into the language
areas.
What would be truly anomalous (indeed a cause for
lamentations and the gnashing of teeth) would be if the
time that elapsed between the dog-stimulus and the
"dog"-utterance were less than the time physically re-
quired for this content to be established and moved
through the system. No such anomalies have been un-
covered, however. It is only when we try to put the
sequence of events thus detectable in the objective pro-
cessing stream into registration with the subject's subjec-
tive sequence as indicated by what the subject subse-
quently says that we have any sign of anomaly at all.
2.2. Orwellian and Stalinesque rewisions: The illusion of a
distinction. Now let us see how the two different models,
the Cartesian Theater and Multiple Drafts, deal with the
presumed anomalies, starting with the simpler and less
controversial phenomena. The Cartesian Theater model
postulates a place within the brain where what happens
"counts"; that is, it postulates that the features of events
occurring within this functionally definable boundary
(whatever it is) are definitive or constitutive features of
conscious experience. (The model applies to all features of
subjective experience, but we are concentrating on tem-
poral features.) This implies that all revisions of content
accomplished by the brain can be located relative to this
place, a deeply intuitive - but false - implication that can
be illustrated with a thought experiment.
Suppose we tamper with your brain, inserting in your
memory a bogus woman wearing a hat where none was
(e.g., at the party on Sunday). If on Monday, when you
recall the party, you remember her, and can find no
internal resources for so much as doubting the veracity of
your memory, we could all agree that you never did
experience her; that is, not at the party on Sunday. Of
course your subsequent experience of (bogus) recollec-
tion can be as vivid as may be, and on Tuesday we can
certainly agree that you have had vivid conscious experi-
ences of there being a woman in a hat at the party, but the
first such experience, we would insist, was on Monday,
not Sunday (although it doesn't seem this way to you).
We lack the power to insert bogus memories by neu-
rosurgery, but sometimes our memories play tricks on us,
so what we cannot yet achieve surgically happens in the

brain on its own. Sometimes we seem to remember, even
vividly, experiences that never occurred. We might call
such post-experiential contaminations or revisions of
memory Orwellian, recalling George Orwell's chilling
vision of the Ministry of Truth in 1984, which busily
rewrote history and thus denied access to the (real) past to
all who followed.
Orwellian revision is one way to fool posterity. Another
is to stage show trials, carefully scripted presentations of
false testimony and bogus confessions, complete with
simulated evidence. We might call this ploy Stalinesque.
Notice that if we are usually sure which mode of falsifica-
tion has been attempted on us, the Orwellian or the
Stalinesque, this is just a happy accident. In any success-
ful disinformation campaign, were we to wonder whether
the accounts in the newspapers were Orwellian accounts
of trials that never happened at all, or true accounts of
phony show trials that actually did happen, we might be
unable to tell the difference. If all the traces - news-
papers, videotapes, personal memoirs, inscriptions on
gravestones, living witnesses, and so on - have been
either obliterated or revised, we will have no way of
knowing which sort of fabrication happened: a fabrication
first, culminating in a staged trial whose accurate history
we now have before us, or after a summary execution,
history-fabrication covering up the deed. No trial of any
sort actually took place.
The distinction between reality and (subsequent) ap-
pearance, and the distinction between Orwellian and
Stalinesque methods of producing misleading archives,
work unproblematically in the everyday world, at mac-
roscopic time scales. One might well think these distinc-
tions apply unproblematically all the way in. That is the
habit of thought that produces the cognitive illusion of
Cartesian materialism. We can catch it in the act in a
thought experiment that differs from the first one in
nothing but time scale.
Suppose a long-haired woman jogs by. About one
second after this, a subterranean memory of some earlier
woman â€” a short-haired woman with glasses â€” contami-
nates the memory of what you have just seen: When asked
a minute later for details of the woman you just saw, you
report, sincerely but erroneously, that she was wearing
glasses. Just as in the previous case, we are inclined to say
that your original visual experience, as opposed to the
memory of it seconds later, was not of a woman with

glasses. But because of the subsequent memory-
contaminations, it seems to you exactly as if at the first
moment you saw her, you were struck by her eyeglasses.
An Orwellian, postexperiential revision has happened:
There was a fleeting instant, before the memory con-
tamination took place, when it didn't seem to you she had
glasses. For that brief moment, the reality of your con-
scious experience was a long-haired woman without eye-
glasses, but this historical fact has become inert; it has left
no trace, thanks to the contamination of memory that
came one second after you glimpsed her.
This understanding of what happened is jeopardized by
an alternative account, however. Your subterranean ear-
lier memories of that short-haired woman with the glasses
could just as easily have contaminated your experience on
the upward path, in the processing of information that
occurs "prior to consciousness" so that you actually hallu-
cinated the eyeglasses from the very beginning of your
experience. In that case, your obsessive memory of the
woman with glasses would be playing a Stalinesque trick
on you, creating a "show trial" for you to experience,
which you then accurately recall at later times, thanks to
the record in your memory. To naive intuition these two
cases are as different as can be. Told the first way (Figure
2), you suffer no hallucination at the time the woman jogs
by, but suffer subsequent memory-hallucinations: You
have false memories of your actual ("real") experience.
Told the second way (Figure 3), you hallucinate when she
runs by, and then accurately remember that hallucination
(which "really did happen in consciousness") thereafter.
Surely these are distinct possibilities, no matter how
finely we divide up time?
No. Here the distinction between perceptual revisions
and memory revisions that works so crisply at other scales
is not guaranteed application. We have moved into the

foggy area in which the subject's point of view is spatially
and temporally smeared, and the question Orwellian or
Stalinesque? (post-experiential or pre-experiential) need
have no answer. The boundary between perception and
memory, like most boundaries between categories, is not
perfectly sharp, as has often been noted.
There is a time window that began when the long-
haired woman jogged by, exciting your retinas, and
ended when you expressed - to yourself or someone else
- your eventual conviction that she was wearing glasses.
At some time during this interval, the content wearing
glasses was spuriously added to the content long-haired
woman. We may assume (and might eventually confirm in
detail) that there was a brief time when the content long-
haired woman had already been discriminated in the
brain but before the content wearing glasses had been
erroneously "bound" to it. Indeed, it would be plausible
to suppose that this discrimination of a long-haired
woman was what triggered the memory of the earlier
woman with the glasses. What we would not know,
however, is whether this spurious binding was before or
after the fact - the presumed fact of "actual conscious
experience/' Were you first conscious of a long-haired
woman without glasses and then conscious of a long-
haired woman with glasses, a subsequent consciousness
that wiped out the memory of the earlier experience, or
was the very first instant of conscious experience already
spuriously tinged with eyeglasses? If Cartesian material-
ism were correct, this question would have to have an
answer, even if we - and you - could not determine it
retrospectively by any test, for the content that "crossed
the finish first" was either long-haired woman or long-
haired woman with glasses. But what happens to this
question if Cartesian materialism is incorrect (as just
about everyone agrees)? Can the distinction between pre-
experiential and post-experiential content revisions be
maintained?
An examination of the color phi phenomenon shows
that it cannot. On the first trial (i.e., without condition-
ing), subjects report seeing the color of the moving spot
switch in midtrajectory from red to green - a report
sharpened by Kolers's ingenious use of a pointer device
which subjects retrospectively-but-as-soon-as-possible
"superimposed" on the trajectory of the illusory moving
spot; such pointer locations had the content: "The spot
changed color right about here" (Kolers & von Griinau
1976, p. 330). Recall Goodman's (1978, p. 73) expression
of the puzzle: "How are we able . . . to fill in the spot at
the intervening place-times along a path running from the
first to the second flash before that second flash occurs?"
Consider, first, a Stalinesque mechanism: In the
brain's editing room, located before consciousness, there
is a delay, a loop of slack like the "tape delay" used in
broadcasts of "live" programs, which gives the censors in
the control room a few seconds to bleep out obscenities
before broadcasting the signal. In the editing room, first
frame A, of the red spot, arrives, and then, when frame B,
of the green spot, arrives, some interstitial frames (C and
D) can be created and then spliced into the film (in the
order A, C, D, B) on its way to projection in the theater of
consciousness. By the time the "finished product" arrives
at consciousness, it already has its illusory insertion.
Alternatively, there is the hypothesis of an Orwellian
mechanism: Shortly after the awareness of the first spot
and the second spot (with no illusion of apparent motion
at all), a revisionist historian of sorts, in the brain's
memory-library receiving station, notices that the unvar-
nished history of this incident doesn't make enough
sense, so he "interprets" the brute events, red-followed-
by-green, by making up a narrative about the intervening
passage, complete with midcourse color change, and
installs this history, incorporating his glosses, frames C
and D (in Figure 4), in the memory library for all future
reference. Because he works fast, within a fraction of a
second - the amount of time it takes to frame (but not
utter) a verbal report of what you have experienced â€” the
record you rely on, stored in the library of memory, is
already contaminated. You say and believe that you saw
the illusory motion and color change, but that is really a
memory hallucination, not an accurate recollection of
your original awareness.
How could we see which of these hypotheses is correct?
It might seem that we could rule out the Stalinesque
hypothesis quite simply, because of the delay in con-
sciousness it postulates. In Kolers and von Griinau's
experiment, there was a 200 msec difference in onset
between the red and green spot, and since, ex hypothesi,
the whole experience cannot be composed by the editing
room until after the content green spot has reached the
editing room, consciousness of the initial red spot will
have to be delayed by at least that much. (If the editing
room sent the content red spot up to the theater of
consciousness immediately, before receiving frame B and
then fabricating frames C and D, the subject would
presumably experience a gap in the film, a noticeable
delay of around 200 msec between A and C.)
Suppose we ask subjects to press a button "as soon as
you experience a red spot." We would find little or no
difference in response time to a red spot alone versus a
red spot followed 200 msec later by a green spot (in which
case the subjects report color-switching apparent mo-
tion). This could be because there is always a delay of at
least 200 msec in consciousness, but aside from the
biological implausibility of such a squandering of time,
there is the evidence from many quarters that responses
under conscious control, although slower than such re-
sponses as reflex blinks, occur with close to the minimum
latencies that are physically possible; after subtracting the
demonstrable travel times for incoming and outgoing
pulse trains, and the response preparation time, there is
little time left over in "central processing" in which to
hide a 200 msec delay. So the responses had to have been

initiated before the discrimination of the second stimulus,
the green spot. This would seem overwhelmingly to favor
the Orwellian, post-experiential mechanism: As soon
as the subject becomes conscious of the red spot, he
initiates a button-press. While that button press is form-
ing, he becomes conscious of the green spot. Then both
these experiences are wiped from memory, replaced in
memory by the revisionist record of the red spot moving
over and then turning green halfway across. He readily
and sincerely (but mistakenly) reports having seen the red
spot moving toward the green spot before changing color.
If the subject were to insist that he really was conscious
from the very beginning of the red spot moving and
changing color, the Orwellian theorist would firmly ex-
plain to him that he is wrong; his memory is playing tricks
on him; the fact that he pressed the button when he did is
conclusive evidence that he was conscious of the (station-
ary) red spot before the green spot had even occurred.
After all, his instructions were to press the button when
he was conscious of a red spot. He must have been
conscious of the red spot about 200 msec before he could
have been conscious of it moving and turning green. If
that is not how it seems to him, he is simply mistaken.
The defender of the Stalinesque (pre-experiential) al-
ternative is not defeated by this, however. Actually, he
insists, the subject responded to the red spot before he
was conscious of it! The directions to the subject (to
respond to a red spot) had somehow trickled down from
consciousness into the editing room, which unconsciously
initiated the button-push before sending the edited ver-
sion (frames AGDB) up to consciousness for "viewing."
The subject's memory has played no tricks on him; he is
reporting exactly what he was conscious of, unless he
insists that he pushed the button after consciously seeing
the red spot; his "premature" button-push was uncon-
sciously (or preconsciously) triggered (cf. Velmans 1991).
Where the Stalinesque theory postulates a button-
pushing reaction to an unconscious detection of a red
spot, the Orwellian theory postulates a conscious experi-
ence of a red spot that is immediately obliterated from
memory by its sequel So here is the rub: We have two
different models of what happens in the phi phenomenon:
one posits a Stalinesque "filling in" on the upward, pre-
experiential path, and the other posits an Orwellian
"memory revision" on the downward, post-experiential
path, and both of them are consistent with whatever the
subject says or thinks or remembers. Note that the
inability to distinguish these two possibilities does not
apply only to the outside observers who might be sup-
posed to lack some private data to which the subject had
"privileged access." You, as a subject in a phi phenome-
non experiment, could not discover anything in the expe-
rience from your own first-person perspective that would
favor one theory over the other; the experience would
"feel the same" on either account. As the interstimulus
interval is lengthened subjects pass from seeing apparent
motion to seeing individual stationary flashes. There is an
intermediate range of intervals where the phenomenol-
ogy is somewhat paradoxical: You see the spots as two
stationary flashes and as one thing moving. This sort
of apparent motion is readily distinguishable from the
swifter, smoother sort of apparent motion of cinema, for
instance, but your capacity to make this discrimination is
not relevant to the dispute between the Orwellian and the
Stalinesque theorist. They agree that you can make this
discrimination under the right conditions; what they
disagree about is how to describe the cases of apparent
motion that you cant tell from real motion - the cases in
which you really (mis-)perceive the illusory motion. To
put it loosely, in these cases is your memory playing tricks
with you, or are just your eyes playing tricks with you?
You can't tell "from the inside."
We can see the same indistinguishability even more
clearly when we see how the two different models handle
the well-studied phenomenon of metacontrast (for a re-
view, see Breitmeyer 1984). If a stimulus is flashed briefly
on a screen and then followed, after a brief interstimulus
interval, by a second "masking" stimulus, subjects report
seeing only the second stimulus. (And if you put yourself
in the subject's place you will see for yourself; you will be
prepared to swear that there was only one flash.) The
standard description of such phenomena is that the sec-
ond stimulus somehow prevents conscious experience of
the first stimulus (in other words, it somehow waylays the
first stimulus on its way to consciousness). But people can
nevertheless do much better than chance if required to
guess whether there were two stimuli. This only shows
once again that stimuli can have their effects on us without
our being conscious of them. This standard line is, in
effect, the Stalinesque model of metacontrast: The first
stimulus never gets to play on the stage of consciousness;
it has whatever effects it has entirely unconsciously. But
we have just uncovered a second, Orwellian model of
metacontrast: Subjects are indeed conscious of the first
stimulus (which would "explain" their capacity to guess
correctly) but their memory of this conscious experience
is almost entirely obliterated by the second stimulus
(which is why they deny having seen it, in spite of their
tell-tale better-than-chance guesses).6
Both the Orwellian and the Stalinesque version of the
Cartesian Theater model can deftly account for all the
data - not just the data we already have, but the data we
can imagine getting in the future. They both account for
the verbal reports: One theory says they are innocently
mistaken whereas the other says they are accurate reports
of experienced "mistakes." (A similar verdict is suggested
in the commentaries of Holender 1986; see especially
Dixon 1986; Erdelyi 1986; Marcel 1986; Merikle &
Cheesman 1986.) They agree about just where in the
brain the mistaken content enters the causal pathways;
they just disagree about whether that location is pre-
experiential or post-experiential. They both account for
the nonverbal effects: One says they are the result of
unconsciously discriminated contents while the other
says they are the result of consciously discriminated but
forgotten contents. They agree about just where and how
in the brain these discriminations occur; they just dis-
agree about whether to interpret those processes as
happening inside or outside the charmed circle of con-
sciousness. Finally, they both account for the subjective
data - whatever is obtainable "from the first-person-
perspective" - because they agree about how it ought to
"feel" to subjects: Subjects should be unable to tell the
difference between misbegotten experiences and imme-
diately misremembered experiences. So, in spite of first
appearances, there is really only a verbal difference
between the two theories (cf. Rein gold & Merikle 1990).
They tell exactly the same story except for where they
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
place a mythical Great Divide, a point in time (and hence
a place in space) whose fine-grained location is nothing
that subjects can help them locate, and whose location is
also neutral with regard to all other features of their
theories. This is a difference that makes no difference.
Consider a contemporary analogy. With the advent of
word-processing and desktop publishing and electronic
mail, we are losing the previously quite hard-edged
distinction between pre-publication editing, and post-
publication correction of "errata." With multiple drafts in
electronic circulation, and with the author readily making
revisions in response to comments received by electronic
mail, calling one of the drafts the canonical text - the text
of "record," the one to cite in one's own publications â€”
becomes a somewhat arbitrary matter. Often most of the
intended readers, the readers whose reading of the text
matters, read only an early draft; the "published" version
is archival and inert. If it is important effects we are
looking for, then, most if not all the important effects of
writing a text are now spread out over many drafts, not
postponed until after publication. It used to be otherwise;
virtually all of a text's important effects happened after
appearance in a book or journal and because of its making
such an appearance. All the facts are in, and now that the
various candidates for the "gate" of publication can be
seen no longer to be functionally important, if we feel we
need the distinction at all, we will have to decide ar-
bitrarily what is to count as publishing a text. There is no
natural summit or turning point in the path from draft to
archive.
Similarly - and this is the fundamental implication of
the Multiple Drafts model â€” if one wants to settle on some
moment of processing in the brain as the moment of
consciousness, this has to be arbitrary. One can always
"draw a line" in the stream of processing in the brain, but
there are no functional differences that could motivate
declaring all prior stages and revisions unconscious or
preconscious adjustments and all subsequent emenda-
tions to the content (as revealed by recollection) to be
post-experiential memory-contamination. The distinc-
tion lapses at close quarters.
Another implication of the Multiple Drafts model, in
contrast to the Cartesian Theater, is that there is no need
- or room - for the sort of "filling in" suggested by frames
C and D of Figure 4. Discussing Kolers' experiment,
Goodman notes that it "seems to leave us a choice be-
tween a retrospective construction theory and a belief in
clairvoyance" (1978, p. 88). What then is "retrospective
construction"?
Whether perception of the first flash is thought to be
delayed or preserved or retnembered [our emphasis], I
call this the retrospective construction theory - the
theory that the construction perceived as occurring
between the two flashes is accomplished not earlier
than the second.
It seems at first that Goodman does not choose between a
Stalinesque theory (perception of the first flash is delayed)
and an Orwellian theory (the perception of the first flash is
preserved or remembered), but his Orwellian revisionist
does not merely adjust judgments; he constructs material
to fill in the gaps; "Each of the intervening places along a
path between the two flashes is filled in . . . with one of
the flashed colors rather than with successive intermedi-
ate colors" (Goodman 1978, p. 85). What Goodman over-
looks is the possibility that the brain doesn't actually have
to go to the trouble of "filling in" anything with "construc-
tion," for no one is looking. As the Multiple Drafts model
makes explicit, once a discrimination has been made
once, it does not have to be made again; the brain just
adjusts to the conclusion that is drawn, making the new
interpretation of the information available for the modula-
tion of subsequent behavior. Recall the commander-in-
chief in Calcutta; he just had to judge that the truce came
before the battle; he didn't also have to mount some sort
of pageant of "historical reconstruction" to watch, in
which he receives the letters in the "proper" order.
Similarly, when Goodman (1978) proposes that "the
intervening motion is produced retrospectively, built
only after the second flash occurs, and projected back-
wards in time," this suggests ominously that a final film is
made and then run through a magical projector whose
beam somehow travels backwards in time onto the mind's
screen. Whether or not this is just what Van der Waals
and Roelofs (1930) had in mind when they proposed
"retrospective construction," it is presumably what led
Kolers (1972, p. 184) to reject their hypothesis, insisting
that all construction is carried out in "real time." Why,
though, should the brain bother to "produce" the "inter-
vening motion"? Why not just conclude that there was
intervening motion, and encode that "retrospective" con-
tent into the processing stream? This would suffice for it
to seem to the subject that intervening motion had been
experienced.
Our Multiple Drafts model agrees with Goodman that
retrospectively the brain creates the content (the judg-
ment) that there was intervening motion, and this content
is then available to govern activity and leave its mark on
memory. But our model claims that the brain does not
bother "constructing" any representations that go to the
trouble of "filling in" the blanks. That would be a waste of
time and (shall we say?) paint. The judgment is already
in, so the brain can get on with other tasks!7
Goodman's "projection backwards in time," like Libet's
"backwards referral in time," is an equivocal phrase. It-
might mean something modest and defensible: A refer-
ence to some past time is included in the content. On this
reading it could be a claim like, "This novel takes us back
to ancient Rome," which almost no one would interpret in
a metaphysically extravagant way, as claiming that the
novel was some sort of time travel machine. This is the
reading that is consistent with Goodman's other views,
but Kolers apparently took it to mean something meta-
physically radical: that there was some actual projection of
one thing at one time to another time. As we shall see, the
same equivocation bedevils Libet's interpretation of his
phenomena.
The model of the Cartesian Theater creates artifactual
puzzle questions that cannot be answered, whereas for
our model these questions cannot meaningfully arise.
This can be seen by applying both models to other
experiments that probe the limits of the distinction be-
tween perception and memory. A normally sufficient, but
not necessary, condition for having experienced some-
thing is subsequent verbal report, and this is the anchor-
ing case around which all the puzzle cases revolve. Sup-
pose that although one's brain has registered - that is,
responded to â€” (some aspects of) an event, something
intervenes between that internal response and a subse-
194
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
quent occasion for verbal report. If there was no time or
opportunity for an initial overt response of any sort, and if
the intervening events prevent later overt responses
(verbal or otherwise) from incorporating reference to
some aspect(s) of the first event, this creates a puzzle
question: Were they never consciously perceived, or
have they been rapidly forgotten?
Consider the familiar span of apprehension. Multiple
letters are simultaneously briefly exposed. Some are
identified. The rest were certainly seen. The subject
insists they were there, knows their number, and has the
impression that they were clearcut and distinct. Yet he
cannot identify them. Has he failed "really" to perceive
them, or has he rapidly "forgotten" them? Or consider an
acoustic memory span test, administered at a rapid rate,
for example, 4 items a second, so that the subject perforce
cannot respond till the acoustic event is over. He identi-
fies some, not others. Yet, subjectively he heard all of
them clearly and equally well. Did he not genuinely
perceive or did he forget the rest?
And if, under still more constricted circumstances such
as metacontrast, the subject even lacks all conviction that
the unrecallable items were there, should we take this
judgment as conclusive grounds for saying he did not
experience them, even if they prove to have left other
contentful traces on his subsequent behavior? If there is a
Cartesian Theater, these questions demand answers,
because what gets into the theater and when is sup-
posedly determinate, even if the boundaries appear fuzzy
because of human limitations of perception and memory.
Our Multiple Drafts model suggests a different per-
spective on these phenomena. When a lot happens in a
short time, the brain may make simplifying assumptions
(for a supporting view, see Marcel 1983). In metacontrast,
the first stimulus may be a disc and the second stimulus a
ring that fits closely outside the space where the disc was
displayed. The outer contour of a disc rapidly turns into
the inner contour of a ring. The brain, initially informed
just that something happened (something with a circular
contour in a particular place), swiftly receives confirma-
tion that there was indeed a ring, with an inner and outer
contour. Without further supporting evidence that there
was a disc, the brain arrives at the conservative conclusion
that there was only a ring. Should we insist that the disc
was experienced because if the ring hadn't intervened the
disc would have been reported? Our model of how the
phenomenon is caused shows that there is no motivated
way of settling such border disputes: Information about
the disc was briefly in a functional position to contribute
to a later report, but this state lapsed; there is no reason to
insist that this state was inside the charmed circle of
consciousness until it got overwritten, or contrarily, to
insist that it never quite achieved this state. Nothing
discernible to "inside" or "outside" observers could distin-
guish these possibilities.
In color phi, the processes that calculate that the
second spot is green and that there is motion proceed
roughly simultaneously (in different parts of the brain)
and eventually contribute to the process that concludes
that the red spot moved over and abruptly turned green
on the way. That conclusion is achieved swiftly enough, in
the standard case, to overwhelm or replace any compet-
ing contents before they can contribute to the framing of a
report. So the subject says - and believes - just what
Kolers and von Griinau report, and that is what the
subject was conscious of. Was the subject also conscious a
fraction of a second earlier of the stationary red spot? Ask
him. If the interstimulus interval is made somewhat
longer, there will come a point where the subject does
report an experience of first a stationary red spot, then a
green spot, and then a noticeably retrospective sense that
the red spot ("must have") moved over and changed color.
This experience has - as the subject will tell you - a quite
different phenomenology. Apparent motion is experi-
enced under such conditions, but it is obviously different
from ordinary motion, and from swifter varieties of appar-
ent motion. How is it different? The subject notices the
difference! In this case it does seem to him as if he only
later "realized" that there had been motion. But in cases
in which this retrospective element is lacking it is still the
case that the discrimination of motion-with-color-change
is achieved after the colors and locations of the spots were
discriminated - and there is no later process of "filling in"
required.
In the cutaneous "rabbit," the shift in space (along the
arm) is recorded over time by the brain. The number of
taps is also recorded. Although in physical reality the taps
were clustered at particular locations, the simplifying
assumption is that they were distributed regularly across
the space-time extent of the experience. The brain relaxes
into this parsimonious though mistaken interpretation
after the taps are registered, and this has the effect of
wiping out earlier (partial) interpretations of the taps, but
some side effects of those interpretations (e.g., the inter-
pretation that there were five taps, that there were more
than two taps, etc.) may live on.
Although different attributes are indeed extracted by
different neural facilities at different rates (e.g., location
vs. shape vs. color), and although if asked to respond to
the presence of each one in isolation we would do so with
different latencies, we perceive events, not a successively
analyzed trickle of perceptual elements or attributes. As
Efron remarks:
There are no grounds for an a priori assumption that the
specificity of our awareness of an object of perception,
or an aspect of that object, gradually increases or grows
following the moment of its onset from the least specific
experience to some maximally specific experience.
. . . We do not, when first observing an object with
central vision, fleetingly experience the object as it
would appear with the most peripheral vision, then as it
would appear with less peripheral vision. . . . Sim-
ilarly, when we shift our attention from one object of
awareness to another, there is no experience of "grow-
ing" specificity of the new object of awareness - we just
perceive the new object. (1967, p. 721)
Is there an "optimal time of probing"? On the plausible
assumption that after a while such narratives degrade
rather steadily through both fading of details and self-
serving embellishment (what I ought to have said at the
party tends to turn into what I did say at the party), one
can justify probing "as soon as possible" after the stimulus
sequence of interest. At the same time, one wants to avoid
interfering with the phenomenon by a premature probe.
Because perception turns imperceptibly into memory,
and "immediate" interpretation turns imperceptibly into
rational reconstruction, there is no single, all-context
summit on which to direct one's probes. Any probe may

elicit a narrative (or narrative fragment), and any such
elicited narrative determines a "time line," a subjective
sequence of events from the point of view of an observer.
This time line may then be compared with other time
lines, in particular with the objective sequence of events
occurring in the brain of that observer. For the reasons
discussed, these two time lines may not superimpose
themselves in orthogonal registration. There may be
order differences that induce kinks.
There is nothing metaphysically extravagant or
challenging about this failure of registration (Snyder
1988). It is no more mysterious or contracausal than the
realization that the individual scenes in movies are often
shot out of sequence, or that when you read the sentence,
"Bill arrived at the party after Sally, but Jane came earlier
than either of them," you learn of Bill's arrival before you
learn of Jane's earlier arrival. The space and time of the
representing is one frame of reference; the space and time
of what the representing represents is another. But this
metaphysically innocuous fact does nevertheless ground a
fundamental metaphysical category: When a portion of
the world comes in this way to compose a skein of
narratives, that portion of the world is an observer. That is
what it is for there to be an observer in the world, a
something it is like something to be.
e@ntrewersies re-examined
3.1. Lifegfs experiments allegedly showing "backwards
referral." Libet's experiments with direct cortical stimula-
tion have provoked a great deal of discussion and specula-
tion, in spite of the fact that they involved very few
subjects, were inadequately controlled, and have not
been replicated (Churchland 198ia; 1981b). No doubt
they have attracted this unusual attention, in spite of their
serious technical flaws because, according to Libet, they
demonstrate "two remarkable temporal factors":
1. There is a substantial delay before cerebral ac-
tivities, initiated by a sensory stimulus, achieve Â£i neuronal
adequacy" for eliciting any resulting conscious sensory
experience.
2. After neuronal adequacy is achieved, the subjective
timing of the experience is (automatically) referred back-
wards in time, utilizing a "timing signal" in the form of the
initial response of cerebral cortex to the sensory stimulus
(1981a, p. 182).
The "timing signal" is the primary evoked potential in
the cortex 10 to 20 msec after peripheral stimulation.
Libet suggests that the backwards referral is always "to"
the timing signal
Libet's model is Stalinesque: various editing processes
occur prior to the moment of "neuronal adequacy," at
which time a finished film is projected. How is it
projected? Here Libet's account vacillates between an
extreme view and a moderate view (cf. Honderich 1984):
a. Backwards projection: it is projected backwards in
time to some Cartesian Theater where it actually runs in
synch with the primary evoked potentials. (The primary
evoked potentials, as "timing signals," serve rather like
the slateboard used in film-making, showing the projector
exactly how far back in time to project the experience.)
b. Backwards referral: It is projected in ordinary
time, but it carries something like a postmark, reminding
the viewer that these events must be understood to have
occurred somewhat earlier. (In this case the primary
evoked potentials serve simply as dates, which might be
represented on the Cartesian screen by a title, "On the
eve of the Battle of Waterloo" or "New York City, Sum-
mer, 1942.")
Libet's own term is "referral" and he defends it by
reminding us of the "long recognized and accepted"
phenomenon of spatial referral, which might suggest the
moderate reading. But because he also insists that this
backwards referral is "remarkable" and a challenge to the
theory of "psychoneural identity," he invites the extreme
interpretation.8 And his interpretation is further sup-
ported by a passage at the close of Libet 1981:
There is experimental evidence for the view that the
subjective or mental "sphere" could indeed "fill in"
spatial and temporal gaps. How else, for example,
could one view that already mentioned enormous dis-
crepancy that is known to exist between a subjective
visual image and the configuration of neuronal ac-
tivities that gives rise to the experience of the image?
(p. 196)9
Let us consider the details. "Neuronal adequacy,"
which Libet estimates to require up to 500 msec of
cortical activity, is determined by seeing how late, follow-
ing initial stimulation, a direct cortical stimulation can
interfere with the consciousness subsequently reported.
Beyond that critical interval, a direct cortical stimulus
would be reported by the subject to be a subsequent
experience. (Having arrived too late for incorporation by
the editing room into the "final print" of the first stimulus
experience, it would appear in the next installment.)
Libet's data suggest a tremendously variable editing win-
dow: "The conditioning cortical stimulus could be started
more than 500 msec following the skin pulse and still
modify the skin sensation, although in most cases retroac-
tive effects were not observed with S-C intervals greater
than 200 msec" (1981, p. 185). Libet is careful to define
neuronal adequacy in terms of effects on subsequent
unhurried verbal report: "The subject was asked to re-
port, within a few seconds after the delivery of each pair
of... stimuli" (1979, p. 195), and he insists that "the
timing of a subjective experience must be distinguished
from that of a behavioral response (such as in reaction
time), which might be made before conscious awareness
develops" (1979, p. 193).
This proviso permits him to defend a rival interpreta-
tion of Churchland's data. Churchland (1981a) attempted
to discredit Libet's claim about the long rise time to
196
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
"neuronal adequacy" for consciousness by asking subjects
in an experiment to say "go" as soon as they were con-
scious of such a skin stimulus as those used by Libet. She
reported a mean response time over 9 subjects of 358
msec, which, she argued, showed that the subjects must
have achieved neuronal adequacy by the 200 msec mark
at the latest (allowing time for the production of a verbal
response). Libet's reply is Stalinesque: A verbal reaction
can be unconsciously initiated. "There is nothing magical
or uniquely informative when the motor response is a
vocalization of the word 'go' instead of the more usual one
of a finger tapping a button. . . . The ability to detect a
stimulus and to react to it purposefully, or be psychologi-
cally influenced by it, without any reportable conscious
awareness of the stimulus, is widely accepted" (Libet
1981, pp. 187-88). And to the objection, "But what did
Churchland's subjects think they were doing, if not say-
ing, as requested, just when they were conscious of the
stimulus?" Libet could give the standard Stalinesque
reply: They did indeed eventually become conscious of
the stimulus, but by then, their verbal report had already
been initiated.10
For this reason Libet rejects such reaction time studies
as Churchland's as having "an uncertain validity as a
primary criterion of a subjective experience" (1981, p.
188). He favors letting the subject take his time: "The
report is made unhurriedly within a few seconds after
each trial, allowing the subject to introspectively examine
his evidence" (p. 188). How, then, can he deal with the
rival prospect that this leisurely pace gives the Orwellian
revisionist in the brain plenty of time to replace the
veridical memories of consciousness with false memo-
ries? "Reporting after the trial of course requires that
processes of short-term memory and recallability be oper-
ative, but this presents no difficulty for subjects with no
significant defects in these abilities" (Libet, p. 188).
This begs the question against the Orwellian, who is
prepared to explain a variety of effects as the result of
normal misremembering or hallucinatory recall, in which
a prior, real event in consciousness is obliterated and
replaced by subsequent memories. (For related discus-
sions, see Allport 1988, pp. 171-76; Bisiach 1988, pp.
110-12.) Has Libet let the stew cook too long, or has
Churchland sampled it too soon? If Libet wants to claim a
privileged status for his choice of probe time, he must be
prepared to combat the counterarguments.
Libet comes close to pleading nolo contendere: "Admit-
tedly, a report of relative timing order cannot, in itself,
provide an indicator of the 'absolute' time (clock-time) of
the experience: As suggested, there is no known method
to achieve such an indicator" (1981, p. 188). This echoes
his earlier remark that there seemed to be "no method by
which one could determine the absolute timing of a
subjective experience" (Libet et al. 1979, p. 193). What
Libet misses, however, is the possibility that this is
because there is no such moment of absolute time (cf.
Hamad, unpublished; 1989).
Churchland too fails to distinguish time represented
from time of representing, in her criticisms (1981a;
1981b): "The two hypotheses differ essentially on just
when the respective sensations were felt [our emphasis],"
(1981a, p. 177) and
Even if it be supposed that the sensations arising from
the simultaneous skin and LM [medial lemniscus]
sensations are felt at exactly the same time [our em-
phasis], the delay in neuronal adequacy for skin stimuli
may well be an artifact of the setup. (1981b, p. 494)
Suppose that all such artifacts were eliminated, and still
the sensations are "felt at exactly the same time." Will this â€¢
mean that there is a time t such that stimulus 1 is felt at t
and stimulus 2 is felt at t (the anti-materialist prospect) or
only that stimulus 1 and stimulus 2 are felt as (experienced
as) simultaneous? Churchland doesn't discourage the
inference that Libet's findings, if vindicated, would wreak
havoc (as he claims) on materialism. Elsewhere, however,
she correctly notes that "intriguing as temporal illusions
are, there is no reason to suppose there is something
preternatural about them, and certainly there is nothing
which distinguishes them from spatial illusions or motion
illusions as uniquely bearing the benchmark of a non-
physical origin" (1981a, p. 178). This could only be the
case if temporal illusions were phenomena in which time
was misrepresented; if the misrepresentings take place at
the "wrong" times, something more revolutionary is
afoot.
Where does this leave Libet's experiments with corti-
cal stimulation? As an interesting but inconclusive at-
tempt to establish something about how the brain repre-
sents temporal order. Primary evoked potentials may
somehow serve as specific reference-points for neural
representations of time, although Libet has not shown
this, as Churchland's technical criticisms make clear.
Alternatively, the brain keeps its representations of time
more labile. We don't represent seen objects as existing
on the retina, but rather as various distances in the
external world. Why should the brain not also represent
events as happening when it makes the most "ecological"
sense for them to happen? When we are engaged in some
act of manual dexterity, "fingertip time" should be the
standard; when we are conducting an orchestra, "ear
time" might capture the registration. "Primary cortical
time" might be the default standard (rather like Green-
wich Mean Time for the British Empire) - a matter,
however, for further research.
The issue has been obscured by the >fact that both
proponent and critic have failed to distinguish consis-
tently between time of representing and time repre-
sented. They talk past each other, with Libet adopting a
Stalinesque position and Churchland making the Or-
wellian countermoves, both apparently in agreement that
there is a fact of the matter about exactly when (in
"absolute" time as Libet would put it) a conscious experi-
ence happens.11
3*2* Libet's claims about the "subjective delay" of con-
sciousness of intention* The concept of the absolute
timing of an experience is exploited in Libet's later
experiments with "conscious intentions," in which he
seeks to determine their absolute timing experimentally
by letting the subjects, who alone have direct access
(somehow) to their experiences, do self-timing. He asked
subjects to look at a clock (a spot of light circling on an
oscilloscope) while they experience consciously intend-
ing, and to make a judgment about the position on the
clock of the spot at the onset of intention, a judgment they
can later, at their leisure, report.
Libet is clearer than most of his critics about the
importance of keeping content and vehicle distinguished:

Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
"One should not confuse what is reported by the subject
with when he may become introspectively aware of what
he is reporting" (Libet 1985a, p. 559). He recognizes (p.
560), moreover, that a judgment of simultaneity need not
itself be simultaneously arrived at or rendered; it might
mature over a long period of time (consider, for instance,
the minutes it may take the stewards at the race track to
develop and then examine the photo-finish picture on
which they eventually base their judgment of the winner
or a dead heat).
Libet gathered data on two time series: (1) the objective
series, which includes the timing of the external clock and
the salient neural events: the readiness potentials (RPs)
and the electromyograms (EMGs), and (2) the subjective
series (as later reported), which consists of mental imag-
ery, memories of any preplanning, and, crucially, of a
single benchmark datum for each trial: a simultaneity
judgment of the form: My conscious intention (W) began
simultaneously with the clock spot in position P.
Libet seems to have wanted to approximate the elusive
acte gratuit discussed by the existentialists (e.g., Gide
1948; Sartre 1943), the purely motiveless - and hence in
some special sense "free" - choice, and as several com-
mentators have pointed out (Breitmeyer 1985; Bridge-
man 1985; Dan to 1985; Jung 1985; Latto 1985) such highly
unusual actions (what might be called acts of deliberate
pseudorandomness) are hardly paradigms of "normal vol-
untary acts" (Libet 1987, p. 784). But has he in any event
isolated a variety of conscious experience, however
characterized, that can be absolutely timed by such an
experimental design?
He claims that when conscious intentions to act (at least
of his special sort) are put into registration with the brain
events that actually initiate the acts, there is an offset:
Consciousness of intention lags 800-500 msec behind the
relevant brain events. This does look ominous to anyone
committed to the principle that "our conscious decisions"
control our bodily motions. It looks as if we are located in
Cartesian theaters where we are shown, with a half-
second tape delay, the real decision-making that is going
on elsewhere (somewhere we aren't). We are not quite
"out of the loop" (as they say in the White House), but
because our access to information is thus delayed, the
most we can do is intervene with last-moment "vetoes" or
"triggers." One who accepts this picture might put it this
way: "Downstream from (unconscious) command head-
quarters, I take no real initiative, am never in on the birth
of a project, but do exercise a modicum of executive
modulation of the formulated policies streaming through
my office."
This picture is compelling but incoherent. For one
thing, such a "veto" would itself have to be a "conscious
decision," it seems, and hence ought to require its own
300-500 msec cerebral preparation - unless one is assum-
ing outright Cartesian dualism (see MacKay, 1985, who
makes a related point). Setting that problem aside, Li-
bet's model, as before, is Stalinesque, and the obvious
Orwellian alternative is raised by Jasper (1985), who notes
that both epileptic automatisms and behaviors occurring
under the effect of such drugs as scopolamine show that
"brain mechanisms underlying awareness may occur
without those which make possible the recall of this
awareness in memory afterward." Libet concedes that
this "does present a problem, but was not experimentally
testable" (p. 560).12
Given this concession, is the task of fixing the absolute
microtiming of consciousness ill-conceived? Neither Li-
bet nor his critics draw that conclusion. Libet, having
carefully distinguished content from vehicle - what is
represented from when it is represented - nonetheless
tries to draw inferences from premises about what is
represented to conclusions about the absolute timing of
the representing in consciousness (cf. Salter 1989).
Wasseraian (1985) sees the problem: "The time when the
external objective spot occupies a given clock position can
be determined easily, but this is not the desired result."
But he then falls into the Cartesian trap: "What is needed
is the time of occurrence of the internal brain-mind
representation of the spot."
"The time of occurrence" of the internal representa-
tion? Occurrence where? There is essentially continuous
representation of the spot (representing it to be in various
different positions) in various different parts of the brain,
starting at the retina and moving up through the visual
system. The brightness of the spot is represented in some
places and times, its location in others, and its motion in
still others. As the external spot moves, all these repre-
sentations change, in an asynchronous and spatially dis-
tributed way. Where does "it all come together at an
instant in consciousness"? Nowhere. Wasseraian cor-
rectly points out that the task of determining where the
spot was at some time in the subjective sequence is itself a
voluntary task, and initiating it presumably takes some
time. This is difficult not only because it is in competition
with other concurrent projects (as stressed by Stamm
1985, p. 554), but also because it is unnatural â€” a con-
scious judgment of temporality of a sort that does not
normally play a role in behavior control, and hence has no
natural meaning in the sequence. The process of interpre-
tation that eventually fixes the judgment of subjective
simultaneity is itself an artifact of the experimental situa-
tion, and changes the task, therefore telling us nothing of
interest about the actual timing of normal representa-
tional vehicles anywhere in the brain.
Stamm likens the situation to Heisenbergian uncer-
tainty: "Self-monitoring of an internal process interferes
with that process, so that its precise measurement is
impossible" (p. 554). This observation betrays a commit-
ment to the mistaken idea that there is an absolute time of
intersection, "precise measurement" of which, alas, is
impossible for Heisenbergian reasons (see also Harnad
1989). This could only make sense on the assumption that
there is a particular privileged place where the intersec-
tion matters.
The all too natural vision that we must discard is the
following: Somewhere deep in the brain an act-initiation
begins; it starts out as an unconscious intention, and
slowly makes it way to the theater, picking up clarity and
power as it goes, and then, at an instant, t, it bursts on
stage, where a parade of visual spot-representations are
marching past, having made their way slowly from the
retina, getting clothed with brightness and location as
they moved. The audience or I is given the task of saying
which spot-representation was "on stage" exactly when
the conscious intention made its bow. Once identified,
this spot's time of departure from the retina can be

calculated, as well as the distance to the theater and the
transmission velocity. That way we can determine the
exact moment at which the conscious intention occurred
in the Cartesian Theater.
Some have thought that although that particular vision
is incoherent, one does not need to give up the idea of
absolute timing of experiences. There is an alternative
family of models for the onset of consciousness that avoids
the preposterousness of the Cartesian-centered brain.
Couldn't consciousness be a matter not of arrival at a point
but rather a matter of a representation exceeding some
threshold of activation over the whole cortex or large parts
thereof? On this model, an element of content becomes
conscious at some time t, not by entering some func-
tionally defined and anatomically located system, but by
changing state right where it is: by acquiring some prop-
erty or by having the intensity of one of its properties
boosted above some criterial level.
The idea that content becomes conscious not by enter-
ing a subsystem, but by the brain's undergoing a state
change of one sort or another has much to recommend it
(see, e.g., Crick & Koch 1990; Kinsbourne 1988; Neu-
mann 1990). Moreover the simultaneities and sequences
of such mode-shifts can presumably be measured by
outside observers, providing, in principle, a unique and
determinate sequence of contents attaining the special
mode. But this is still the Cartesian Theater if it is claimed
that the real ("absolute") timing of such mode shifts is
definitive of subjective sequence. The imagery is differ-
ent, but the implications are the same. Conferring the
special property that makes for consciousness at an instant
is only half the problem; discriminating that the property
has been conferred at that time is the other, and although
scientific observers with their instruments may be able to
do this with microsecond accuracy, how is the brain to do
this? We human beings do make judgments about simul-
taneity and sequence among elements of our own experi-
ence, some of which we express, so at some point or
points in our brains the corner must be turned from the
actual timing of representations to the representation of
timing. This is a process that takes effort in one way or
another (Gallistel 1990), and wherever and whenever
these discriminations are made, thereafter the temporal
properties of the representations embodying those judg-
ments are not constitutive of their content.
Suppose that a succession of widely spread activation
states, with different contents, sweeps over the cortex,
The actual, objectively measured simultaneities and se-
quences in this broad field are of no functional relevance
unless they can also be accurately detected by mecha-
nisms in the brain. What would make this sequence the
stream of consciousness if the brain could not discern the
sequence? What matters, once again, is not the temporal
properties of the representings, but the temporal proper-
ties represented, something determined by how they are
"taken" by subsequent processes in the brain.
3.3. Grey Waiter's experiment: A better demonstration of
the central contention of the Multiple Drafts model It was
noted above that Libet's experiment created an artificial
and difficult judgmental task that robbed the results of the
hoped-for significance. This can be brought out more
clearly by comparing it to a similar experiment by Grey
Walter (1963), with patients in whose motor cortex he had
implanted electrodes. He wanted to test the hypothesis
that certain burst of recorded activity were the initiators
of intentional actions, so he arranged for each patient to
look at slides from a carousel projector. The patient could
advance the carousel at will, by pressing the button on the
controller. (Note the similarity to Libet's experiment:
This was a "free" decision, timed only by an endogenous
rise in boredom, or curiosity about the next slide, or
distraction, or whatever.) Unbeknownst to the patient,
however, the controller button was a dummy, not at-
tached to the slide projector at all. What actually ad-
vanced the slides was the amplified signal from the
electrode implanted in the patient's motor cortex.
One might suppose that the patients would notice
nothing out of the ordinary, but in fact they were startled
by the effect, because it seemed to them as if the slide
projector was anticipating their decisions. They reported
that just as they were "about to" push the button, but
before they had actually decided to do so, the projector
would advance the slide - and they would find them-
selves pressing the button with the worry that it was going
to advance the slide twice! The effect was strong, accord-
ing to Grey Walter's account, but apparently he never
performed the dictated followup experiment: introducing
a variable delay element to see how large a delay had to be
incorporated into the triggering to eliminate the "precog-
nitive carousel" effect.
An important difference between Grey Walter's and
Libet's designs is that the judgment of temporal order
that leads to surprise in Grey Walter's experiment is part
of a normal task of behavior monitoring. In this regard it is
like the temporal order judgments by which our brains
distinguish moving left-to-right from moving right-to-
left, rather than "deliberate, conscious" order judgments.
The brain in this case has set itself to "expect" visual
feedback on the successful execution of its project of
advancing the carousel, and the feedback arrives earlier
than expected, triggering an alarm. This could show us
something important about the actual timing of content
vehicles and their attendant processes in the brain, but it
would not, contrary to first appearances, show us some-
thing about the "absolute timing of the conscious decision
to change the slide."
Suppose, for instance, that an extension of Grey Wal-
ter's experiment showed that a delay as long as 300 msec
(as implied by Libet) had to be incorporated into the
implementation of the act in order to eliminate the
subjective sense of precognitive slide-switching. What
such a delay would in fact show would be that expecta-
tions set up by a decision to change the slide are tuned to
expect visual feedback 300 msec later, and to report back
with alarm under other conditions. The fact that the alarm
eventually gets interpreted in the subjective sequence as
a perception of misordered events (change before button
push) shows nothing about when in real time the con-
sciousness of the decision to press the button first oc-
curred. The sense the subjects reported of not quite
having had time to "veto" the initiated button push when
they "saw the slide was already changing" is a natural
interpretation for the brain to settle on (eventually) of the
various contents made available at various times for incor-
poration into the narrative. Was this sense already there

Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
at the first moment of consciousness of intention (in which
case the effect requires a long delay to "show time" and is
Stalinesque) or was it a retrospective reinterpretation of
an otherwise confusing fait accompli (in which case it is
Orwellian)? This question should no longer seem to
demand an answer.
4. Conclusion
The Multiple Drafts model has many other implications
for scientific theories of consciousness (Dennett 1991b),
but our main conclusion in this target article is restricted
to temporal properties of experience: The representation
of sequence in the stream of consciousness is a product of
the brain's interpretative processes, not a direct reflec-
tion of the sequence of events making up those processes.
Indeed, as Jackendoff has pointed out to us, what we are
arguing for in this essay is a straightforward extension to
the experience of time of the common wisdom about the
experience of space; the representation of space in the
brain does not always use space-in-the-brain to represent
space, and the representation of time in the brain does not
always use time-in-the-brain. It may be objected that the
arguments presented here are powerless to overturn the
still obvious truth that our experiences of events occur in
the very same order that we experience them to occur. If
someone thinks the thought, "One, two, three, four,
five," his thinking "one" occurs before his thinking "two"
and so forth. The example does illustrate a thesis that is
true in general and does indeed seem unexceptioned, so
long as we restrict our attention to psychological phenom-
ena of "ordinary," macroscopic duration. But the experi-
ments we selected for discussion are concerned with
events that were constricted by unusually narrow time-
frames of a few hundred milliseconds. At this scale, we
have argued, the standard presumption breaks down.
It might be supposed, then, that we are dealing only
with special cases. These limiting cases may interestingly
reveal how the brain deals with informational overload,
but, one might suggest, they are unrepresentative of the
brain's more usual manner of functioning. The contrary is
the case, however, as might be anticipated, in view of the
brain's well-known propensity for applying a limited
number of basic mechanisms across a wide range of
situations. The processes of editorial revision that are
dramatically revealed in the time-pressured cases con-
tinue indefinitely as the brain responds to the continued
demands of cognition and control. For instance, as time
passes after an event has occurred, that event may be
recalled to episodic memory, but to an ever more limited
extent. After some days, an occurrence that may have
unrolled over minutes or more is remembered within as
restricted a time frame as those we have been discussing.
Such memories present not as randomly blurry or de-
pleted versions but as internally coherent, simplified
renderings of what are taken to be the most important
elements. Temporal succession is typically an early victim
of this reorganization of the event, sacrificed in favor of
(apparently) more useful information (as instanced in the
phi phenomenon).
We perceive - and remember - perceptual events, not
a successively analyzed trickle of perceptual elements or
attributes locked into succession as if pinned into place on
a continuous film. Different attributes of events are in-
deed extracted by different neural facilities at different
rates, (e.g., location vs. shape vs. color) and people, if
asked to respond to the presence of each one in isolation,
would do so with different latencies, depending on which
it was, and on other well-explored factors. The relative
timing of inputs plays a necessary role in determining the
information or content of experience, but it is not obli-
gatorily tied to any stage or point of time during central
processing. How soon we can respond to one in isolation,
and how soon to the other, does not exactly indicate what
will be the temporal relationship of the two in percepts
that incorporate them both.
There is nothing theoretically amiss with the goal of
acquiring precise timing information on the mental oper-
ations or informational transactions in the brain (Wasser-
man & Kong 1979). It is indeed crucial to developing a
good theory of the brain's control functions to learn
exactly when and where various informational streams
converge, when "inferences" and "matches" and "bind-
ings" occur. But these temporal and spatial details do not
tell us directly about the contents of consciousness. The
temporal sequence in consciousness is, within the limits
of whatever temporal control window bounds our inves-
tigation, purely a matter of the content represented, not
the timing of the representing.

1. A philosophical exception is Vendler (1972; 1984) who
attempts to salvage Cartesian dualism. A scientific exception is
Eccles (e.g., Popper & Eccles 1977).
2* What about the prospect of a solitary Robinson Crusoe
scientist who performs all these experiments wordlessly on
himself? Would the anomalies be apparent to this lone ob-
server? What about reconstructing these experiments with
languageless animals? Would we be inclined to interpret the
results in the same way? Would we be justified? These are good
questions, but their answers are complicated, and we must
reserve them for another occasion.
3Â» Such a "postmark" can be in principle be added to a vehicle
of content at any stage of its journey; if all materials arriving at a
particular location come from the same place, by the same route
at the same speed, their "departure time" from the original
destination can be retroactively stamped on them, by simply
subtracting a constant from their arrival time at the way station.
This is an engineering possibility that is probably used by the
brain for making certain automatic adjustments for standard
travel times.

carried out in the field of sensory coding can be distilled into a
single, especially important idea - any candidate code can
represent any perceptual dimension; there is no need for an
isomorphic relation between the neural and psychophysical

can represent quality, and certainly, nonlinear neural functions
can represent linear or nonlinear psychophysical functions
equally well" (Uttal 1979). This is a widely acknowledged idea,

but, as we will show, some theorists (mis-)understand it by
tacitly reintroducing the unnecessary "isomorphism" in a dimly
imagined subsequent translation or "projection" in con-
sciousness.
5o Cf. Pylyshyn 1979: "No one . . . is disposed to speak
literally of such physical properties of a mental event as its color,
size, mass, and so on - though we do speak of them as represent-
ing (or having the experiential content of) such properties. For
instance, no one would not properly say of a thought (or image)
that it was large or red, but only that it was a thought about
something large or red (or that it was an image of something
large or red)* . . . It ought to strike one as curious, therefore,
that we speak so freely of the duration of a mental event."
6. P. S. Churchland (1981a, p. 172) notes a difference be-
tween "masking in the usual sense" and "blanking in short term
memory," which perhaps is an allusion to these two possibilities,
but does not consider how one might distinguish between them.
7. Consider the medio-temporal region of cortex (MT),
which responds to motion (and apparent motion). Suppose then
that some activity in MT is the brain's concluding that there was
intervening motion. There is no further question, on the Multi-
ple Drafts model, of whether this is a pre-experiential or post-
experiential conclusion. It would be a mistake to ask, in other
words, whether this activity in MT was a "reaction to a conscious
experience" (by the Orwellian historian) as opposed to a "deci-
sion to represent motion" (by the Stalinesque editor).
8o See also his dismissal of MacKay's suggestion of a more
moderate reading (Libet 1981, p. 195; 1985b, p. 568).
9o Libet's final summation in 1981, on the other hand, was
inconclusive: "My own view . . . has been that the temporal
discrepancy creates relative difficulties for identity theory, but
that these are not insurmountable" (p. 196). Presumably they
would be undeniably insurmountable on the backwards
projection interpretation, and Libet later (1985b, p. 569) de-
scribes these difficulties in a way that seems to require the
milder reading: "Although the delay-and-antedating hypothesis
does not separate the actual time of the experience from its time
of neuronal production, it does eliminate the necessity for
simultaneity between the subjective timing of the experience
dnd the actual clock-time of the experience." Perhaps Eccles's
enthusiastic support for a radical, duaiistic interpretation of the
findings has misdirected the attention of Libet (and his critics)
from the mild thesis he sometimes defends.
10. In an earlier paper, Libet conceded the possibility of
Orwellian processes and supposed there might be a significant
difference between unconscious mental events and conscious-
but-ephemeral mental events: "There may well be an immedi-
ate but ephemeral kind of experience of awareness which is not
retained for recall at conscious levels of experience. If such
experiences exist, however, their content would have direct
significance only in later unconscious mental processes, al-
though, like other unconscious experiences, they might play an
indirect role in later conscious ones" (1965, p. 78). ,
11. Hamad (1989) sees an insoluble problem of measure-
ment, but denies our contention that there is no fact of the
matter: "Introspection can only tell us when an event seemed to
occur, or which of two events seemed to occur first. There is no
independent way of confirming that the real timing was indeed
as it seemed. Incommensurability is a methodological problem,
not a metaphysical one." So Hamad asserts what we deny: that
among the real timings of events in the brain is a "real timing" of
events in consciousness.
12. In a later response to a similar suggestion of Hoffman and
Kxavitz (1987) Libet asks the rhetorical question, "Are we to
accept the primary evidence of the subjects' introspective re-
port (as I do), or are we going to insist that the subject had a
conscious experience which he himself does not report and
would even deny having had?" (1987, p. 784). This is another
expression of Libet's a priori preference for a Stalinesque
position.

Dennett & Kinsbourne (D & K) set out to replace what they take
to be a bad picture of consciousness, "Cartesian materialism,"
with one they prefer, their "Multiple Drafts" model. Once made
explicit, they maintain, Cartesian materialism is an obvious
mistake (sect. 1.1., para. 10). Nevertheless it is hard to escape its
grip, they claim; its imagery continues to infect much current
thought about consciousness. In this commentary I shall not
discuss D & K's arguments against Cartesian materialism in any
detail. Instead, I shall argue that the most charitable reading of
their critique commits them to the view that consciousness does
not exist-to eliminativism about consciousness. Although elim-
inativism follows from their central claims, other passages sug-
gest that they believe consciousness does exist. Consequently,
their position on the ontological status of consciousness needs
clarification.
Cartesian materialism is the view that remains when Carte-
sian dualism is rejected but "the associated imagery of a central
(but material) theater where 'it all comes together'" is retained
(sect. 1.1, para. 8). Although Cartesian materialism includes the
questionable view that there is a single place in the brain where
all conscious experiences occur, it also includes the more plausi-
ble and widely held view that conscious states, processes, and so
forth, are functionally characterizable (sect. 1.1, para. 10; sect.
2.2, para. 1). According to functionalism, token brain states or
processes are conscious if and only if they bear appropriate
causal relations to other token states and processes (and inputs
and outputs). Consequently, on functionalist theories there
need be no single place in the brain that subserves only con-
sciousness, let alone a single place where all consciousness
occurs. Each experience must simply occur somewhere or
other.
In arguing against Cartesian materialism, D & K set out to
show that there are no facts about exactly when token experi-
ences happen (note 12), for example, when they begin or end.
Settling "on some moment of processing in the brain as the
moment of consciousness," they write, "has to be arbitrary"
(sect. 2.2, para. 21). There is no moment of absolute time of an
experience (sect. 3.1, para. 8; sect. 3.2, para. 8). From the
claims expressed in these passages, and others like them, it is
meant to follow that Cartesian materialism is false. The idea,
presumably, is that if there is a place in the brain where a given
experience occurs, there is necessarily some time when it oc-
curs also. But there is no such time and consequently no such
place.
Putting aside the question of whether D & K have argued
soundly for the claims expressed in the passages cited above, it is
worth considering how those claims are to be best understood. I
can think of three ways of interpreting their statements. The
first takes them as straightforwardly denying that conscious
experiences are temporally located, that they begin, persist for
some interval, and end. Clearly this interpretation leads di-
rectly to eliminativism, given materialistic assumptions. For
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

Commentary/ Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
every physical state, event, process, and so on, is temporally
located in this sense, if there exist conscious states and pro-
cesses, therefore, they are as well.
Perhaps, however, D & K's picture is a more subtle one.
What they seem to be critical of is the notion that experiences
have "exact" or "absolute" temporal locations, that they have
beginnings or endings that can be fixed upon with "precision."
Perhaps, then, their idea is that while conscious experiences are
temporally located in the sense in which everything is, the
temporal boundaries of conscious experiences are vague. Thus,
if one wished to state precisely (e.g., in milliseconds) when an
experience began or ended, one would have to choose ar-
bitrarily from among equally good alternatives, there being no
fact of the matter about which choice is correct. The trouble with
this interpretation, however, is that it is trivially true, since
everything has vague temporal boundaries relative to some
sufficiently fine-grained scale or other. Consider, for example, a
scale of microseconds (one millionth of a second), and everyday
events like a sneeze, the running of an engine, or an action
potential in a cortical cell. Fixing the beginnings or endings of
any of these events in microseconds would demand arbitrary
choices from among thousands of alternatives. The temporal
boundaries not only of experiences, therefore, but of every
neurophysiological state or event are vague relative to some
temporal scale. (Analogous points hold for spatial boundaries.)
Consequently, merely asserting that the temporal boundaries of
experiences are vague amounts to a truism, and has no bearing
on Cartesian materialism.
A third way of reading the above passages is to understand
them as claiming that conscious experiences are temporally
located, but the time scale appropriate for the measurement of
neurophysiological events (e.g., milliseconds) is too fine-
grained to determine nonarbitrary temporal boundaries for
experiences. This claim is not trivial since it implies that con-
scious experiences cannot be identified with functional states or
processes (assuming such states or processes are realized by
neurophysiological states or processes). The basic idea underly-
ing this interpretation, then, is that the temporal boundaries of
conscious experiences are "bigger and fuzzier" than the bound-
aries that carve up functional states and processes in the brain.
But now there is a difficulty: Conscious experiences have no role
in the functional organization of the brain. Hence they are not
causally related to any states or processes that are functionally
characterizable. (If they were they would be functional states or
processes themselves.) It follows that conscious experiences
cannot be introspected and reported on, they cannot be caused
by sensory input, they cannot play a role in causing behavior and
thought, and so on. Indeed it is difficult to see how one could
even think about one's own conscious experiences, if one's
thoughts were causally unconnected to those experiences. It
would seem, therefore, that this third interpretation reduces to
absurdity.
It appears that the only way D & K's remarks on the temporal
properties of experiences an be understood as expressing an
intelligible and substantive claim is by interpreting them in such
a way that eliminativism about consciousness is entailed. The
two alternative interpretations that seem possible are either
trivial or incoherent. The trouble with taking D & K as advocat-
ing eliminativism, however, is that nowhere do they explicitly
endorse eliminativism. On the contrary, their target article
contains numerous passages that imply that they think con-
sciousness does exist; for instance, their last sentence: "The
temporal sequence in consciousness is . . .purely a matter of
the content represented, not the timing of the representing."
(conclusion, para. 4). Thus if Dennett & Kinsbourne believe
consciousness exists, they must provide an interpretation ol
their remarks on the temporal properties of experience that is
distinct from the three I have discussed. If they do not, the
passages suggesting they do must be clarified.
Throwing the conscious baby out with
Cartesian bath water

Ms. Molly Bloom drifts off to sleep, consciously thinking these
last thoughts "... all perfume yes and his heart was going like
mad and yes I said yes I will Yes." When Ms. Bloom trades
consciousness for sleep, she is trading away a single, unified
narrative for none. This is what Joyce believed, this is what we
believe, but this isn't what Dennett & Kinsbourne (D & K)
believe. Instead, D & K believe that there is no unified stream
of consciousness, no place (even functionally speaking, see sect.
1.1, para. 8) where "it all comes together." They want to replace
the notion of consciousness as a master discriminator with
braided streams of consciousness (to use a geological metaphor,
the only one that hasn't been, used yet). Instead of a single
narrative, they want a "a skein of narratives."
D &â€¢ K have developed their view of consciousness, called the
"multiple drafts model," in order to avoid Cartesian materialism
and its associated view of consciousness: the Cartesian Theater
model. There are several things we like about this target article.
We applaud D & K's vigilance against Cartesianism (this per-
nicious doctrine has more lives than a cat; we tolerate even its
mild forms to our detriment); we agree that there is no one place
in the brain where consciousness occurs, and we do think that
their clever Orwellian-Staiinesque argument shows that there is
an unsolvable descriptive problem in the study of conscious-
ness. Furthermore, the multiple processing and time-stamping
aspects of their multiple drafts model are important additions to
cognitive science's growing understanding of consciousness.
But we think that they have thrown the baby out with the bath
water: They seem to have rejected the essential phenomenology
of consciousness in an attempt to avoid dualism and implausible
neurophysiology. At least, this shall be our plaint.
D & K reject two different versions of the Cartesian Theater
model: an anatomical version and a functional version. The
anatomical version is the materialistic cousin of Descartes'
original dualism. Descartes thought the pineal gland was the
gateway to the conscious mind. Rejecting Descartes' dualism
but keeping the anatomical sentiments, one might hypothesize
that the pineal gland is the seat of consciousness; it is where
consciousness takes place. But, as we learn from the neu-
roanatomists, neither in the pineal gland nor probably any-
where else in the brain is the seat of consciousness. Conscious-
ness, as D & K note, is distributed. However, they think that
rejecting the anatomical version of the Cartesian Theater re-
quires rejecting the functional version as well (sect. 1.1, para. 8).
This is a mistake. There could well be a functionally defined
locus of consciousness that is both physically distributed and
operates at different levels and times. One can believe as they
do that the subjective temporal properties of events are not
determined by the objective temporal properties of events
anywhere in the brain and yet still believe that "it all comes
together somewhere - functionally speaking." Put another way,
one can believe that contents are temporally stamped - that
they carry their temporal representations around with them -
without having to give up the notion that consciousness is a
single unified narrative.
There is more to this point than mere logic. Phenomenologi-
cally, it certainly seems that consciousness is unified and that
the stream of consciousness is a single narrative (it's not always
coherent, but it is a single narrative: Ms. Bloom's nocturnal
thoughts are the result of subconscious competing and parallel
processes). We will need much more than what we've been

given by D & K before we surrender this perception. For
starters, they owe us an explanation of why we have this
perception in the first place.
Our criticism of D & K as well as our positive position is
summed up in Figure 1. Figure la represents the position we
take D & K to be attacking, and we agree that it is incorrect.
Figure 1b represents our understanding of the multiple drafts
model. As one can tell from Figure 1b, the multiple drafts model
seems to predict that each person has multiple conscious selves,
each independent from one another. This seems wrong: There is
no logical reason we should adopt such a view, nor do the
experiences of individuals support it. Furthermore, such a view
could be construed as the very one D & K are attacking, namely
the Cartesian Theater - instead of just one theater, there are
several . . . a sort of theater district.
The view which captures what we like about D & K's ideas
while remaining faithful to the phenomenology is Figure 1c (the
functional theater). This model does not require a single location
for the seat of consciousness but still allows for a single stream of
consciousness, one which is constantly revised and updated, but
is nonetheless unified.
Finally, the functional theater model is not open to the charge
of dualism because it could be implemented as a computer
program. For example, one kind of metaprocessor is a machine
that takes as input the run-time trace of an object-level proces-
sor and outputs information implicit in that run-time trace. One
kind of information that is implicit in this sense is the data type of
the object-level process. (Determining that a trace is a trace of a
stack growing and shrinking is an example of the kind of thing

such a metaprocessor could do.) If we hypothesize that thinking
is the execution of various (instantiated) data types (this hypoth-
esis is one way of being a computationalist), then we can
describe consciousness as a metaprocessor that makes explicit
the implicit data type a current thought is, for example, the
belief that snow is cold or the desire for ice cream (see Dietrich
1985).
We conclude that while D & K are clear on what the multiple
drafts model is not (namfely, the anatomical version of the
Cartesian Theater), they are not at alLclear on what their model
is. And, they are stuck with a dilemma. If they are trying to
explain consciousness as it appears, and they therefore do hold
with some kind of unifying process, then they still owe us an
explanation of how the parallel and conflicting streams come
together; and talk of time stamping isn't a sufficient explanation.
On the other hand, if they deny that consciousness is unified,
then it seems that they have not explained consciousness at all,
but rather simply thrown it out.
Consciousness is associated with central as
well as distributed processes

Dennett & Kinsbourne (D & K) present a strong case that a
naive "point center" conception of consciousness is wrong.
However, their Multiple Drafts model seems to deny for con-
sciousness any integrative or executive function at all. Yet if
consciousness has no "central" function, why would the authors
want to bring their ideas to the consciousness of this audience?
They would surely be unhappy if all potential readers were
unable to pay conscious attention to their work, for example, by
listening to the radio while trying to read the target article. This
commonsense reductio ad absurdum makes a point that is also
backed by'much experimental evidence: Consciousness plays a
central role in integrative and executive functions (see Baars,
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2
203

Commentary/Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
1988, Chapter 2, and below). This central role, however, does
not rule out the existence of multiple distributed systems.
An extreme dichotomy between centrist and distributed
views of consciousness, as if only these alternatives existed, is
inimical to clear thought. These are not the only options. A more
comprehensive approach can integrate both central and dis-
tributed functions in a single, coherent framework. One such
framework has been worked out in detail by Baars (1983; 1988).
Fehling's Schemer II architecture (Fehling et al. 1990) supports
a principled implementation of this type of system with great
ease and flexibility.
Consider the extensive evidence about comparable conscious
and unconscious processes shown in Table 1, a highly con-
densed summary of the extensive experimental literatures on
immediate memory, selective attention, automaticity, errors,
and directly observed brain processes. Consciousness appears
to be closely associated with a limited capacity system, as is well
known. But Table 1 also suggests that the limited-capacity
system interacts constantly with a largely unconscious, highly
distributed "society" of special-purpose processes. At any single
time, most of these distributed processes are not available to
consciousness, nor are they under conscious control; yet they
certainly help shape conscious experiences and are indispens-
ible to the execution of conscious goals.
Table 1 suggests the existence of a parallel-interactive sys-
tem, one in which a vast society of anatomical and functional
systems in the brain is largely unconscious. Out of this great
collection of specialized functions - which certainly involve
multiple drafts of any particular input, as suggested by D & K -
there emerges a serial flow of remarkably restricted size. It can
hardly be accidental that this emergent serial flow happens to be
intimately associated with conscious experience. Our work with
the global-workspace architecture suggests that a serial compo-
nent of a massive parallel system becomes necessary when many
parallel distributed processors must interact in some maximally
integrative fashion. Interactivity enforces seriality.
Without defending Cartesian Materialism, we want to em-
phasize several central facts that remain unexplained by D & K's
Multiple Drafts model:

ferent conscious contents

Each routine process is
relatively context-free.
3. The set of routine, un-
conscious processes is di-
verse, can sometimes
operate in parallel, and
together have great pro-
cessing capacity.
1. Conscious experience is internally consistent. For exam-
ple, potentially ambiguous percepts are always experienced
unambiguously at any particular moment, although there is
much reason to suppose that unconscious representations of the
ambiguous stimulus co-exist with the internally consistent con-
scious one.
2. There is a need for some degree of functionally central
control and coordination of multiple, parallel lines of delibera-
tion and action.
3. Some particular stream of processing very quickly comes
to predominate in any particular context.
4. The dominant processing stream often incorporates and
refines information from other parallel streams.
5. An agent's ability to select among multiple streams is
limited by certain integrative constraints, such as the need to act
in a non-self-contradictory way. In driving a car, we do not step
on the accelerator and the brake pedal at the same time. Our
actions are somehow integrated in the service of global objec-
tives, although the details of those actions may be relegated to
distributed systems.
Our current thinking embodies the principal mechanisms
specified by Baars' Global Workspace (G W) theory (1988), which
suggests that conscious experience reflects the workings of a
global "broadcasting system," analogous to a bulletin board or
blackboard. The contents of a limited-capacity GW in our archi-
tecture are sufficient to initiate, coordinate, and integrate multi-
ple, otherwise independent processing streams. GW data must
include descriptions of properties of the processes themselves as
well as representations of data returned by those processes. No
confusion need arise in this architecture between the onset time
of a process constructing a temporal representation and the time
value encoded as a result. Both data produced by processes and
data describing process behavior can be encapsulated within
process streams, or within the globally accessible GW, or both, as
required. Local coordination among process streams can be
achieved by direct process-to-process communication as well as
indirectly via the contents of the GW. Consequently, this archi-
tecture manifests hierarchical functional organization that
changes in response to changing needs for interaction among its
constituent processes, as well as at the global level.
We are currently investigating such issues by means of a
principled, computer-based functional architecture developed
by Fehling et al. (1989). In this framework, consciousness,
reflection, self-concept and self-awareness, as well as a host of
unconscious processes, emerge as highly functional (e.g., Fehl-
ing et al. 1990). An agent's problem-solving, decision-making,
and control of actions is accomplished by a large collection of
distributed cognitive-process elements that operate indepen-
dently and concurrently except where they must be coordinated.
As most computer scientists who design distributed systems will
attest, a significant degree of explicit global coordination of the
distributed processes is needed for the cognitive system as a
whole to act in a coherent and integrated manner. The Schemer
architecture allows us to examine alternative ways to coordinate
the actions of these highly distributed cognitive processes as well
as the mechanisms that serve the need for integration.
In sure, though we have little disagreement with D & K's
critique of Cartesian Materialism, it seems that the Multiple
Drafts model errs on the side of an unnecessary extreme. It does
not address the need for overall coordination of distributed
processes and the manifestation of such coordination in con-
scious experience. Our own work suggests a less extreme
alternative. Although a global workspace architecture does
indeed use a functionally centralized "stream of consciousness,"
it appears quite able to handle the facts of temporal representa-
tion addressed by Dennett & Kinsbourne.

Begging the question against phenomenal
consciousness
Ned Block
Department of Linguistics and Philosophy, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139
Electronic mall: block@psyche.mit.edu
Dennett & Kinsboume's (D & K's) argument hinges on the
unmentioned and unargued assumption that there is no such
thing as phenomenal consciousness. Those readers who believe
in phenomenal consciousness should not find the argument
convincing.
What Is phenomenal consciousness? There is a great chasm
between those who think about the mind: On one side are those
who accept a concept of consciousness distinct from any cogni-
tive or information processing or functional notion; on the other
side are those who reject any such concept. Dennett (1991b)
gives a book-length argument against such a conception, draw-
ing on, among other things, the raw materials of this target
article, but there is no such argument in the target article.
The concept of consciousness at issue attracts descriptions
like "raw feel," "immediate phenomenological quality," and
Nagel's (1974) "what it is like." This is the concept of conscious-
ness that leads us to speak of an "explanatory gap": At this stage
in the relevant sciences we have no idea how the neural
substrate of my pain can explain why my pain feels like this
rather than some other way or no way at all. This is the concept
of consciousness that gives rise to the famous "inverted spec-
trum" hypothesis - things we both call "green" look to you the
way things we both call "red" look to me - and the "absent qualia
qualia" hypothesis, the idea that there could be a machine that
was computationally like us, but was nonetheless a phenome-
nally unconscious zombie. Note that these conundra are routes
to phenomenal consciousness - they do not constitute it. One
can accept phenomenal consciousness without accepting any of
them because our fundamental access to phenomenal conscious-
ness derives from our acquaintance with it.1
Of course, those who accept phenomenal consciousness do
not disparage other concepts of consciousness. We can speak of
information as conscious in the sense that it is inferentially
promiscuous (Stich 1978), that is, it is easily available to be used
as a premise in reasoning and in formulating plans, and it is
available for reporting. (For example, information that is re-
pressed is not inferentially promiscuous.) Or we can speak of a
state as conscious in the sense that it is accompanied by a
thought to the effect that one is having that state (Armstrong
1968; Rosenthal 1986). Or we can speak of a state as conscious in
the sense that one can monitor it or have internal soliloquies
about it.
The question begged. The point of the "multiple drafts"
metaphor is that with the various forms of electronic quasi-
publishing now flourishing, we may one day (though clearly not
yet) have a situation in which any decision as to which of the
many versions is to be counted as "the publication" will he
arbitrary. D & K write that since a perception of an event is
spread over the brain in space and therefore in time, labeling
any of the stages or revisions conscious would be similarly
arbitrary. But what if some of the brain representations of an
event making up this spatio-temporal volume are phenomenally
conscious whereas others are not? It is surely nonarbitrary to
label those phenomenally conscious events as conscious. D &
K's claim that it is arbitrary to select some representations as
conscious is plausible only if one swallows their unmentioned
irrealism about phenomenal consciousness. Only if there is no
such thing as phenomenal consciousness would it be arbitrary to
ascribe "it" to one representation rather than another.
If there is such a thing as phenomenal consciousness, then
presumably this fact will be reflected at the neural level.
Perhaps there will be differences between those brain represen-
tations that are phenomenally conscious and those that are not of
the sort that Crick and Koch (1990), have proposed. The D & K
argument depends on supposing that the Crick & Koch research
project is a confusion, a search for something that does not exist,
but we are given no argument to this effect.
Note that the D & K arguments against Cartesian materialism
(even assuming that they are successful) cast no doubt on the
reality of phenomenal consciousness. The hypothesis I just
mentioned, to the effect that some perceptual representations of
an event are conscious whereas others are not, makes no
commitment to there being any single place where all phenome-
nally conscious events live. Perhaps there are phenomenally
conscious events in many different areas of the brain. No one
endorses Cartesian materialism, but many of us endorse phe-
nomenal consciousness. Note also that one who accepts phe-
nomenal consciousness can also accept all sorts of borderline
cases between consciousness and nonconsciousness, and other
sorts of indeterminacies of consciousness; perhaps some of the
stages of perceptual processing will be like phenomenally con-
scious events in some ways but not in others. Antirealists often
try to stick realists with one or another version of the law of the
excluded middle: "If there is such a thing as phenomenal
consciousness, then every question about it has a definite yes or
no answer." Is phenomenal event A before phenomenal event
B? If one event contains the other, there will be no yes-or-no
answer.
Qrwellian wersus Stalinist accounts. D & K repeatedly write
that "nothing discernible to 'inside' or 'outside' observers could
distinguish" Orwellian from Stalinist options (sect. 2.2, para.
29). Both claims are false if phenomenal consciousness exists, as
I will now argue.
Inside/9 On the Orwellian story about the lady who runs by,
for example, there is a phenomenal experience of a lady with
long hair and no glasses. On the Stalinist story, there is no such
phenomenal experience. The difference between some such
phenomenal experience and no such phenomenal experience is
an "inside" difference if there ever was one. What D & K appear
to mean by something discernible "inside" is something discern-
ible in the subject's judgments. But to assume that the subjec-
tive is exhausted by judgments is to beg the question against
phenomenal consciousness, which, if it exists, is not just a
matter of judgments.
The question-begging nature of the argument is summed up
by the following lines about the Orwellian/ Stalinist disagree-
ment: " . . . they both account for the subjective data - what-
ever is obtainable 'from the first person perspective' - because
they agree about how it ought to 'feel' to subjects." (sect. 2.2,
para. 19) On the contrary, the Orwellian and Stalinist theories
do not agree about how things feel to the subject; the Orwellian
accepts the phenomenally conscious experience of a lady with
long hair and no glasses; the Stalinist rejects it. What the
Orwellian and the Stalinist agree on is the subject's judgments,
not on what he feels.
D & K may wish to retreat to the position that one cannot use
introspection as a source of data to decide between Orwellian
and Stalinist theories of one's own experiences. This is not
something that believers in phenomenal consciousness should
dispute, since we believe that our privileged access, such as it is,
extends to our experiences themselves, but does not make our
memories of them infallible. If we want to decide between
Orwellian and Stalinist accounts, we will need to appeal to
science, and to this matter we now turn.
"Outside." The D & K claim that "outside" observers could
never tell the difference between Orwellian and Stalinist hy-
potheses is equally question-begging. If the presence or ab-
sence of phenomenal consciousness is a real property, ingenious
experimenters will presumably find a way to get an experimen-
tal handle on it. (See Potter 1975 and 1976, for the beginnings of
a line of evidence for an Orwellian stance.) D & K say that the
Orwellian and the Stalinist can agree on where the mistaken
content enters the causal pathway, they just disagree about
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2
205

Commentary/Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
whether the content prior to the point at which the mistaken
content is introduced is phenomenally conscious or not. They
conclude that "this is a difference that makes no difference"
(sect. 2.2, para. 19). But it makes no difference only on the
assumption that there are no real facts about phenomenal
consciousness, an assumption which the target paper does not
state or support.
One crude approach to telling the difference between at least
some Orwellian and Stalinist pairs of hypotheses is this: In some
cases, the Orwellian postulates a change in memory representa-
tion not accepted by the Stalinist. (See for example, the case of
Chase and Sanborn in Dennett 1988.) In such cases, if the
relevant memory system could be independently isolated and
found not to change, that would support the Stalinist. I tried this
out on Dennett (he mentioned that it was independently sug-
gested by P. S. Churchland); his initial response was that we
could not rely on any independent identification of the relevant
memory system. If D & K want to pursue this line of thought,
they owe us a reason to believe that standard scientific pro-
cedures cannot succeed in making such an independent identi-
fication. The hypothesis that the earth is flat can be insulated
from data by the ad hoc postulation of special forces that make a
disk look like a sphere, for example. Why should we believe that
standard scientific criteria cannot possibly distinguish between
Orwellian and Stalinist hypotheses?
Another line of empirical investigation would be to isolate the
neurological nature of phenomenal consciousness itself as in the
Crick and Koch project mentioned earlier. Again, D & K owe us
a reason to think that this cannot be done.
Mellor, Churchland, and Hamad. D & K correctly point out
that the temporal order of outside events needn't be repre-
sented by the temporal order of inside events. This Kantian
point (Kant distinguished apprehension of succession from suc-
cession of apprehension) is certainly correct. D & K accuse P. S.
Churchland, and somewhat less directly, S. Hamad and H.
Mellor, of confusing order of representeds with order of repre-
sentings. In my view, the quotations that they give from
Churchland (1981a; 1981b) and Hamad (1982) show no signs of
such a confusion, but rather just a commitment to the reality of
phenomenal consciousness. I suggest you look at the quotations
(sect. 3.1, para. 9 and Note 12) to see for yourself.
The Mellor quotation (sect. 2.1, para. 11) raises a more
complex question. In addition to more ordinary phenomenal
experiences, we sometimes have phenomenal experience of
relations among some of our phenomenal experiences, relations
that involve "co-consciousness" of the experiences. Choosing a
nontemporal example, we may experience one pain as more
intense than another pain in part by experiencing both pains.
The more complex question is this: Can we be conscious
of the intensity relation between two pains (including co-
consciousness of the two pains) without the two pains them-
selves having the intensity relation? Of course, I can judge that
the headache was more intense than the backache without ever
being co-conscious at all of the two pains. But the issue here is
not one of judgments, but of experience of relations among
experiences. Mellor takes a stand on this issue for the special
case of temporal relations. D & K treat this view with scorn,
even linking it to "the invited conclusion that all perceptions of
temporal order must be accomplished in a single place" (sect.
2.1, para. 15). Their tacit rejection of phenomenal consciousness
influences their interpretation of those who accept it, and so
they see Cartesian materialism lurking under every bush.
Cartesian modularism. In concentrating on Cartesian mate-
rialism, a view that D & K concede probably no one holds
explicitly, they ignore a far more interesting view that is a
genuine object of contention. The more interesting view is
Cartesian modularism, the claim that there is a system for
phenomenal consciousness. In talking of Cartesian materialism,
D & K usually interpret "place" as physical place, but occasion-
ally they talk as if they want "place" to cover functional place as
well (sect. 1.1, para. 8). They don't elaborate, but on the
functional understanding of Cartesian materialism it would be
Cartesian modularism, the view that all conscious events occur
in a single system. Then, however, the neurophysiological
evidence D & K give against there being an actual place in the
brain where all phenomenally conscious events occur would
have no relevance. What does spatio-temporal spread have to do
with Cartesian modularism?
I explore Cartesian modularism elsewhere (Block, forthcom-
ing), but briefly, it is an interesting fact that the following co-
occur:
1. Phenomenally conscious events.
2. Events that have access to inferentially promiscuous rea-
soning processes.
3. Events that guide action and speech.
This co-occurrence, along with many other considerations,
suggests a model in which there is a single system or group of
closely connected systems that subserve these functions. Schac-
ter (1989) puts forward such a model; critics of phenomenal
consciousness should take it seriously.2

consciousness is not identical to any functional or information-
processing concept, that does not preclude an identification of the
property of consciousness (as opposed to the concept) from being
identified with a functional or information-processing property. The
property/concept distinction cannot be clarified here. See Loar (1990).

Dennett & Kinsbourne (D & K) take consciousness for granted
and go on to describe some of its characteristics. In a passage
reminiscent of the Bible's "In the beginning, when God cre-
ated . . . ," they start section 1.1 with "Where there Is a
conscious mind. . . . " Although their analysis is certainly pro-
ductive, it should be grounded in a functional perspective of the
conscious faculty as a neurological system like any other, with a
job to do and a way of doing it. This commentary will attempt to
provide that grounding. The result will come out somewhat
backwards, with the conscious mind emerging as a result of the
operation of other systems.
The starting point Is evolutionary theory. We know that
because of their complexity the neurological systems that sup-
port consciousness must have evolved over a very long time and
were retained because they had a function. The basic function
(elaborated from Norman & Shallice 1980 and Bridgeman 1988)
originates from the need of more advanced animals to separate
behavior from the immediate exigencies of the environment.
An organism that merely reacts to sensory information has no
need for consciousness â€” it simply does what the environment
demands and its psychology is one giant transfer function. As
soon as more than one plan drives behavior, however, there
must be an internal rather than an external trigger for action.

plans, stores them in memory, and keeps track of where the
execution of each one stands.
I suggest that the escape from stimulus-response behavior
makes consciousness necessary, a keeping track in memory of
internal rather than external controls on behavior. It is this
continuous plan-monitoring function, and nothing more or less,
that we define as consciousness. Thus consciousness is
emergent from the process of driving behavior from internally
held plans. Consciousness is not an object in itself, but a side
effect of other neurological operations. In defining conscious-
ness in this way we also redefine psychology, from a study of
stimulus-response contingencies to a study of the plans that
drive behavior.
There is no room for a "Cartesian Theater" in this conception,
but the function of consciousness clearly fits with a parallel
"multiple-drafts" notion, for many plans exist simultaneously
(everything from short-term plans such as cooking dinner to
long-term ones such as earning a Ph.D.). The control of be-
havior is a giant juggling act. Existing plans are evaluated along
with incoming sensory information and the execution of one
plan wins out. At the same time, new plans and new subparts of
existing plans are created.
This interpretation of the function of a conscious mind has
consequences in several illusions where the differences be-
tween consciousness and reality are particularly evident. One
such consequence is the illusion of the knife-edge of time
discussed by D & K. There is no need to micromanage temporal
relationships in a range where time distortions in the incoming
sensory channels and the motor apparatus begin to become
significant. But the concept of the knife-edge precision of
definition is necessary to assign a temporal order, however
arbitrary, to events and actions. As D & K point out, the
temporal tag is not itself a temporal event; it is useful in the
planning and plan-executing processes, not in the real-time
operation of the brain.
A second illusion, not discussed by D & K but illuminating in
this context, is the feeling that the visual field presents a detailed
and veridical representation of the surrounding world. Every-
one shares an almost irresistible introspection that the visual
world present in consciousness is, for example, in full color and
sharp focus. Yet we know that reasonable color coding exists
only in the central 30Â° or so of the retinal image, and that
sharpest focus and high-acuity imaging occupy only a tiny region
in the fovea. We see not the retinal image, but some idealized
combination of sensory information, memory, and assumption
combined so seamlessly that we are unaware that most of what
we perceive isn't actually available in the retinal signal. It is just
this composite that is useful in making decisions based on visual
information - the immediately present visual image is just a
processing stage, a small part of the available information.
A third illusion is the distal reference that characterizes both
sensory and motor operations. We perceive objects in the
world, not in the eye or ear, and we feel objects, not deforma-
tions on the skin. Awareness arises only where it is functionally
advantageous, at a level of coding where sensory and motor
processes are coded as common, distally oriented events (Prinz
1991). A wealth of empirical work (summarized by Bridgeman
1990) is now available that distinguishes what processing is
available in consciousness and what is not.
It may seem ironic that the processes of creating plans,
accessing memory, and keeping track of everything are them-
selves unconscious, that we are unaware in consciousness of the
functions that support consciousness. But if we think of con-
sciousness as a result of planning capabilities, not as a system in
itself that must be modeled, there is no reason why conscious-
ness should appear at a mechanism level and there is no
mechanism to make that possible. Consciousness is not a moni-
tor of mental life but a result of mental operations separated
from the immediate sensorimotor world.
Experiential facts?

In this timely piece, Dennett & Kinsbourne (D & K) attack what
they term the image of the Cartesian Theater. The key move in
their argument is to insist that just as judgments about, for
example, redness do not require corresponding brain events
that are actually red, so, too, judgments about temporal se-
quence need not involve the construction, somewhere in the
brain, of an actual sequence of brain events that are temporally
related in just the same way as the events which figure in the
judgment (see e.g., sect. 1.1, para. 6; sect. 2.1, para. 6). To
suppose that judgments of sequence must depend on the abso-
lute sequence of brain events at some (functional) point where
"it all comes together" is a mistake that, it is claimed, can make a
variety of phenomena involving subjective judgments of tem-
porality seem needlessly anomalous. I believe D & K are right to
reject this strong image of the Cartesian Theater, but their
argument goes further, for they then go on to deny the distinc-
tion between:
a. cases where an agent actually has a subjective experience
of some event (like seeing a woman without glasses) but later
comes to judge that the woman wore glasses all along (the
"Qrwellian" story - sect. 2.2., para. 7), and
b. cases where the agent's original experience was of seeing a
woman with glasses (even though the woman in question was
not wearing any), and this experience is accurately recalled in
the later judgment that she had glasses on (the "Stalinesque"
story, sect. 2.2, para. 8).
It is not obvious (to me at least) why this distinction needs to
be denied. For such a denial is not forced upon us when we give
up the image of the Cartesian Theater. We may agree that later
judgments of the temporal order of events need not be
grounded in a kind of action replay in which we construct brain
events of matching temporality. But we may still believe that
there were facts about the immediate contents of conscious
experience so that it can (for example) simply be true (or false)
that at time t, you had the experience of seeing a woman without
glasses. Such conscious states may surely form an absolute
temporal sequence independent of the agent's propensity to
later judge that given conscious states did or did not occur. And
this is, on the face of it, all that is needed to justify the
Orwellian/Stalinesque distinction. In short, I don't see why
recognising the errors D & K point out undermines the idea of
an absolute timing of conscious contents or of absolute facts
about conscious contents. Such facts could be quite indepen-
dent of our later judgments, and be facts nonetheless.
D & K's position is somewhat clarified by the example of
metacontrast. Here, faced with the question "Did conscious
perception of a disc occur?" they decline to answer, saying that
"information about the disc was briefly in a functional position to
contribute to a later report, but this state lapsed" (sect. 2.2,
para. 29). The question of whether the disc perception was ever
conscious is one that D & K claim is opaque to both the agent
and to any outside observers. Probe the agent at different times
and you will get different answers. Both Stalinesque and Or-
wellian stories are, it seems, "consistent with whatever the
subject says, or thinks, or remembers" (sect. 2.2, para. 36). But
this is surely only true if "thinks" here means "later judges to be
the case." If we believe that there are facts about conscious
contents and that such facts are in principle independent of later
verbal reports, the distinction can be maintained. Perhaps it is
the idea of facts about conscious mental experiences indepen-
dent of facts about later verbal judgments that D & K really seek
to displace?
I suspect that this is indeed the case and that D & K really
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2
207

Commentary/Dennett & Kinsboume: Time and the observer
want to cast doubt on the very idea of an experiential fact - a fact
about the content of conscious experience at a given moment.
The arguments concerning temporal and spatial smear (sect.
1.1) suggest that they wish to reject the very idea of a single
conscious observer as a locus of experiential facts. But nothing in
the explicit argument seems to justify this radical conclusion.
We could grant that a variety of brain states (spatially dis-
tributed) could be implicated in the construction of immediate
conscious contents- and yet still discover that there is some
functional property (e.g., of synchrony of neural activity in
certain regions), which is both necessary for a content to become
consciously known and yields an absolute temporal order of
experiences (with specific contents) - an order that need not,
however, be preserved in later judgments about the order. I
cannot see that this possibility is ruled out by anything that
Dennett and Kinsbourne tell us.
To sum up, the move from the (proper and important)
rejection of the idea that judgments of temporality require a
matching temporal sequence of brain events to the denial of the
Orwellian/Stalinesque distinction looks problematic. The tran-
sition could be oiled by some radical views about the nonexis-
tence of experiential facts or the relation between conscious
content and verbal report. If there is indeed such a hidden
agenda, it should come on stage for the curtain calls.
ThÂ® selfless consciousness

I enjoyed reading Dennett & Kinsbourne's (D & K's) target
article. It provides interesting ammunition against the intuition
that consciousness depends on a single brain locus where
multifarious information comes together, in spatial and tem-
poral terms. This notion, which D & K modestly refer to as a
"prevailing view," is far worse than that: It informs virtually all
research on mind and brain, explicitly or implicitly, and is
certainly the common sense concept of the nonscientist and
nonphilosopher in the street. My other comments are as follows:
(1) The evidence presented by D & K ..draws on cognitive
science and is damaging enough to the Cartesian Theater
model. I think, however, that D & K could have made an even
stronger case by using evidence from experimental neuroana-
tomy, neurophysiology, neuropsychology, and computational
neuroscience. Elsewhere I have analyzed part of that evidence
to construct an argument against one or even a few "integrative"
brain sites (Damasio 1989a; 1989b; 1990). For instance, there is
no neuroanatomical structure in the cerebral cortex to which
signals from all the sensory modalities that may be represented
in our experience can converge, spatially and temporally. The
entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus might be candidates for
that sort of "integrative" role but they do not pass the necessary
anatomical tests. Also, we know for certain that they cannot do
the job because patients in whom such structures are destroyed
bilaterally (e.g., patients Boswell [see Damasio et al. 1989] and
H. M. [see Corkin 1984]) do not have a disturbance of conscious-
ness in the sense discussed by D & K. (It can be argued that
BoswelFs highest level of self-consciousness is not intact since
he cannot access a large body of unique memories from his past,
but it is clear that he deals quite self-consciously and appropri-
ately with the universe, at categorical level). The prefrontal
cortex, another region associated with consciousness in the
minds of most people that have ever thought about the brain, is
an even less adequate candidate than the entorhinal cortex for
the "integrative" locus underlying a Cartesian Theater. It pro-
vides many anchor points for signals hailing from various sen-
sory streams and from the motor system, but there is no single
site to which "representations" can cohere spatially and tem-
porally. Extensive bilateral ablation of prefrontal cortices in
humans does not preclude basic consciousness, although, again,
we have argued that the highest levels of self-consciousness are
not possible without these structures.
(2) I had two problems with D & K's proposal. The first and
most important is that the rejection of one biologically impossi-
ble Cartesian Theater does not amount to rejecting the sense of
one self doing the experiencing. There are, without a doubt,
neural systems whose operation generates the sense of self, and
on the basis of which we construct the false intuition that there is
one brain site where experience happens. A satisfactory model of
consciousness should indicate how the dis-integrated fragments
operate to produce the integrated self. My impression is that the
Multiple Drafts model is part of an alternative to the Cartesian
Theater model but not a complete one. I would suggest that
there are two necessary functions missing from the Multiple
Drafts model without which I cannot fathom how consciousness,
illusory phenomenon that it may be, will emerge. The first
function is the sustained updating of critical sets of knowledge of
the individual doing the experiencing. The sets encompass both
taxonomically categorical levels of knowledge ("supraordinate"
and "basic object"), as well as unique level ("subordinate" and
autobiographical). The updated knowledge refers not only to the
past but also to the future, that is, to memories of intended
actions and plans. The second function is the sustained monitor-
ing of somatic states of the experiencer, to include both visceral
and musculoskeletal sectors ot Ihe organism. I suspect that
the updating of previously acquired knowledge is implied in the
Multiple Drafts hypothesis, but I saw no reference to the
possible role of somatic states. I do not believe consciousness is
possible without having something like the multiple drafts of D
& K referred to the somatic base of the experiencer. Only
awareness, in the sense used by Crick and Koch (1990), might be
possible without a somatic reference.
I am persuaded that the multiple drafts mechanism alone will
produce a selfless, disembodied consciousness. Incidentally,
selfless consciousness can almost happen in some circum-
stances. An example is anosognosia, a neurological condition
caused by extensive parietal and frontal damage in the human
right hemisphere. The patients are unable to monitor their
somatic states comprehensively and become unconcerned with
their medical problems and with their future implications. They
can give evidence that some externally generated representa-
tions of their own body do not pertain to themselves. I usually
teach about this condition by stating that the lesion has "chipped
part of consciousness away," that many percepts and thoughts of
these patients are no longer referred to their bodies (for a similar
perspective on the neurobiological basis of the self, see Merleau
Ponty or, more recently, Edelman, 1989). Deep level medita-
tion is another circumstance in which consciousness loses itself,
so to speak, and eventually dissolves (this can be achieved in
certain forms of Buddhist meditation).
(3) My second problem has to do with the degree of dissolu-
tion of the Cartesian Theater in D & K's alternative. How dis-
integrated, neurally speaking, need dis-integration be? I agree
that there is no single Cartesian Theater, but I suspect that there
may be many such theaters, or, to use my own metaphor, many
stages on which relatively coherent drafts of ongoing neural
activity play out, at slightly different times. The point here is
that it is plausible that some components of our experience
actually depend on a local integration of neural sets of activity.
For example, under certain circumstances this might happen in
primary sensory cortices as a result of synchronization gener-
ated by feedback.
My closing comment is about the connection between con-
sciousness and the timing of neural events. This is an important
issue and is finally receiving the attention it deserves. That time
can provide the illusion of a single place has been proposed by

Dennett & Kinsbourne's (D & K's) discussion of "the where and
when of consciousness in the brain" is an example of the growing
trend toward using neuroscientific data to address questions
about consciousness. Such projects are often informative and
worthwhile, but emphatically not for what they tell us about
consciousness.
What do D & K establish in this target article? They show us
that the representation of a given event or sequence of events
may be distributed across brain regions and over time, and that
the representation of temporal order need not be the temporal
order of representations. Once we have accepted these very
reasonable points, certain empirical findings that might have
seemed paradoxical before seem unremarkable. This may be a
useful contribution to the psychology of time perception, but it
tells us nothing about consciousness. Their analysis would apply
equally well to the nonconscious representations of an appropri-
ately programmed PC. The constant reference to conscious-
ness, rather than to time information or time representation, is
gratuitous.
Similar complaints can be made about the recent work on
consciousness in visual perception. Parietal-lobe-damaged pa-
tients with an attentional impairment known as "extinction" may
fail to identify stimuli presented in the affected region of space,
but they can nevertheless classify those stimuli as the same as, or
different from, other stimuli (Volpe et al. 1979). This has been
taken as a demonstration that the parietal lobe is needed for
visual percepts to reach consciousness. However, it can also be
explained without invoking consciousness, by the far less sensa-
tional hypothesis that the parietal lobe plays a role in visual
information processing, and that a less precise visual represen-
tation is needed to decide whether a stimulus is the same as or
different from another one, compared to identifying it uniquely
(Farah et al. 1991). Prosopagnosic patients (unable to identify
faces) seem to respond appropriately to previously familiar faces
in certain indirect ways. For example, they can learn to associate
faces with their correct names faster than with incorrect names,
suggesting to some authors that the problem in such cases is not
in face recognition per se, but in conveying the products efface
recognition to conscious awareness (e.g., De Haan et al. 1987).
Again, these data can be understood more simply and without
any need for the concept of consciousness by the hypothesis that
face recognition is impaired in these patients and that the tests of
"unconscious" face recognition, such as savings in relearning,
are simply more sensitive tests to detecting residual functioning
of a damaged visual system (Wallace & Farah, in press).
The dissociations among different kinds of visual abilities after
brain damage are interesting for what they tell us about graded
information processing in the brain and about the ability of
partial or low-quality information to support certain computa-
tions and not others. They have not, so far, shed any light on the
mechanisms of consciousness. Similarly, D & K's collection of
puzzling phenomena in time perception highlights the dis-
tributed nature of time representation and the importance of
distinguishing the sequence of representations from the repre-
sentation of the sequence. But, despite the subtitle of their
target article and the numerous tantalizing references to con-
sciousness in their text, D & K offer no insights at all about
consciousness. Take the most eliminative and unsexy definition
of the word "consciousness" you like, for example, control
mechanisms, or accessibility to speech - D & K have still told us
nothing about it. The most that can be said is that they clarify
certain properties of a type of information processing (the
information processing underlying time perception) that could
be conscious or unconscious and that happens in at least some
cases to be conscious.
The fact that D & K's ideas apply to time perception rather
than vision or some other perceptual modality may reinforce the
illusion of their relevance to consciousness. For reasons that
cannot be discussed in the space of a brief commentary, time
perception has long been associated with conscious awareness
by psychologists (e.g., Ornstein 1977) and philosophers (e.g.,
Bergson 1910). If D & K had written a similar article accounting
for anomalies in color perception rather than time perception,
entitled "Color and the Observer," we would not be so tempted
to look for insights into consciousness. [See Thompson et al.:
"Ways of Coloring" BBS 15(1) 1992.]
In sum, as a claim about the computational and neural
mechanisms of time perception, Dennett & Kinsbourne's idea
about representations distributed in space and time seems fine.
But as a claim about "the where and when of consciousness," it
misses the mark just as widely as Descartes' theory of the pineal
gland.

Even though we do not reject Dennett & Kinsbourne's (D &
K's) conclusion, we have several difficulties with their argu-
ments for the distinction between a Cartesian Theater model
and a Multiple Drafts model. D & K argue that the Cartesian
Theater model of Cartesian materialism fails because it requires
that mental content cross a unique experiential finishing line in
order to become conscious experience, that temporal content be
carried only by temporal properties of representations, and that
there be an empirically unavailable distinction between Sta-
linesque and Orwellian revision; they claim that the Multiple
Drafts model succeeds on all three counts. However, Cartesian
materialism need not fall prey to their criticisms; the Multiple
Drafts model becomes either a version of a Cartesian Theater
model or an eliminativist theory.
Cartesian materialism does presuppose a finishing line, be-
cause it assumes a single determinate stream of consciousness.
Cartesian Theater models do require that there are facts about
when a represented content becomes part of the stream. How-
ever, they do not require that the activity of one particular area
in the brain be correlated with consciousness - there may be
many such areas. Grounds for rejecting a unique neurobiologi-
cal finishing line are therefore not sufficient for rejecting Carte-
sian Theater models. One should instead reject the idea of a
single "film" whose observation is equated with consciousness.
Moreover, the Cartesian Theater model, just like the Multi-
ple Drafts model, allows the representation of temporal content
by nontemporal features of the representations. What the Car-
tesian Theater requires is only that whenever a representation
does reach a neurobiological finishing line, the content of the
representation be experienced at that time, regardless of how
broad or "smeared" that finishing line may be. We suspect that
D & K mean to deny that an experienced temporal sequence is
identical to the sequence of the individual experiences that
compose it, but to deny that would be a mistake. Suppose a
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2
209

Commentary/Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
temporal sequence is composed of experiences El, E2, E3, in
that order. Either the content of the three individual experi-
ences is experienced in that order, too, or that temporal se-
quence is not experienced at all. The issue might be that the
sequence of experiences represents a temporal fact about three
vents el, e2, and e3. El, E2, E3 could mean that the events
represented occurred in the order e2, el, e3. This is a perfectly
possible state of affairs the Cartesian Theater model does not
rule out. However, this is not an example of the order of
experiences differing from the experienced order; to believe
that would be to confuse the order of experiences with the order
of events represented by the content and order of the
experiences.
Finally, D & K present the Cartesian Theater model as
landing us in the empirically unresolvable Stalinesque/ Or-
wellian pickle, while the Multiple Drafts model obviates the
need for the distinction. They conclude that there is no fact
about whether any revision is Stalinesque or Orwellian and so
the Multiple Drafts model is preferable. But even if D & K's
epistemological verificationism were acceptable, there is still a
way to answer questions about types of revision (at least in some
cases). D & K accept verbal reports as indicators of conscious
experience; however, they do not argue that these reports are
the only such indicators, nor that they are not correlated with
neurobiological activity. At first blush, neurobiological evi-
dence might well prove a robust indicator of consciousness. For
example, if we restrict ourselves to measuring verbal reports
and gross bodily movement, there is no observable difference -
in either first or third person - between drugs that render
subjects unconscious and oblivious to painful stimuli (a Stalin-
esque experience) and drugs that do not prevent pain from
being experienced but that temporarily paralyze the subjects
and keep the pain from being recalled (an Orwellian experi-
ence). But we do have access to more"than mere verbal reports.
For example, anesthesiologists know that alleged analgesics
produce EEG waves similar to those found in unconscious
sleeping subjects, while alleged paralytic amnesics produce
EEC's similar to alert subjects. (For similar notions, see Kulli &
Koch 1991). Once again, we are left without a good reason to
prefer the Multiple Drafts model to the Cartesian Theater
model.
Moreover, as long as the Multiple Drafts model includes the
notion of consciousness as an observer and interpreter of some
"draft," it seems reasonably close to a version of Cartesian
materialism in which the "theater" shifts around in the brain,
since it still requires a privileged and unique temporal "finishing
line" for each content probed in the multiple drafts. If there
were no such line and no definitive narrative of conscious
experience, then it would not matter whether any contentful
state were probed at all. D & K suppose contentful states can be
causally efficacious without leaving any trace in consciousness,
and their Multiple Drafts model would support the lack of
functional significance between conscious and nonconscious
states. But in this case, a Multiple Drafts model would not
preserve the role for consciousness as an interpreter, which D &
K explicitly include. And if they do not go on to draw this more
radical conclusion, D & K have not really departed from the
Cartesian Theater.
Mottling is instantaneous5 ewen in sensation

Electronic mail: rag655@csc2.anu.edu.au
Let us start with processing time; a stimulus input that may be
virtually instantaneous to the external observer, like a Dirac
delta function, is converted into one or more temporally ex-
tended representations in the neural mass of the brain. For
sensations, at least two pathways appear to be implicated (Mish-
kin & Appenzeller 1987) and each can form closed loops. This
initial activity can be short lived or turned into limit cycling,
which at lower phyletic levels may then perseverate for hours,
even days. The ostensive "finish line" is a consequence, then, of
tapping the extended representation and converting the sample
of such activity into phenomenology, which in turn becomes a
verbal or motor response to the outside observer. Or perhaps
the phenomenology is bypassed completely, if we create a
demand situation that induces that bypassing.
The two externally observable events can be at almost exact
points in time, but unless they were coincident, which they
never are, any intervening events need not themselves be
instantaneous. Theory that assumes they are temporally ex-
tended can be constructed and can fit some qualitative facts in
psychophysics (Gregson 1988; 1991). The response, a sensation,
can itself be quite long and apparently slowly evolving, as is the
case in gustation. I see no reason to be depressed if my
consciousness production mechanisms lags behind my other
more efficient brain processes; quite the contrary, I could argue
that any organisms built that way might have evolutionary
advantages or that we have inherited something that was advan-
tageous in our primitive ancestors and now is mostly innocuous.
From such a position it seems we could rule out the Cartesian
Theatre and only consider the Multiple Drafts. The question
that interests me is where in all this do we get our basis for
reporting when events arise in our consciousness, and how do
we estimate the passing of time between two or more successive
events? The distinction between time represented and time of
reporting seems to suggest that when we initiate a brain process,
we also set running in parallel a clock which puts markers on the
record. The coarser the clock's resolution in real time, the more
fuzzy the representations of successive process stages. Now,
there are three alternatives which dangle themselves before our
metaphorical eyes:
i. each process initiates its own clock, autonomous from all
other clocks and the last register on that specific clock is when
the process is terminated, vacated, or overwritten, or
ii. there is a common master clock and each process picks up
a starting label (the postmark) and runs at the same rate in real
time thereafter, or
iii. there aren't any clocks but the processes have paths in
real time that are characterized by intrinsic and inescapable
periodicities.
Such quasiperiodicities are typical of nonlinear dynamics, which
we know do occur in the brain. This third position is a strong
version of the first, it says that all processes are autonomous and
clocks are not needed because every process is a time series
which is generated by an attractor's dynamics. The autonomy
part of this is not strongly asserted; we can have dynamics that,
as it were, leak into one another. This third position is the one to
which I have subscribed (Gregson 1988; 1991) but it leaves us
with the problem of how we can ever talk about the simultaneity
of steps in two contemporaneous processes. If it is felt that we
must have in the brain a third process, which acts as a monitor to
the first two, then we are halfway back to the Cartesian Theatre
with one great monitor, like Bentham's panopticon. This is
dubious, for even if there are no special continuously running
processes always accessible to act as monitors, each coupling of
two or more processes should still be able to function as a single
dynamic with a single time marker, but with three coupled
processes (or even three degrees of freedom) the process be-
comes sometimes chaotic (Nicolis 1986). Coupled dynamics
typically exhibit a master to slave relationship, one inducing a
forcing function onto the periodicity and hence the timing of the
other (Haken 1985). It is possible to write dynamics that are only
open to input at periodic points (Zak 1991) and would therefore
only collect input from another process at those "windows,"
even if the processes are continuously coupled.

BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

Commentary/Dennett & Kinsbourne^ Time and the observer
Suppose we have two processes, a and b, with values Vqi, Vbi,
t = 1,2, . . . . , starting at times tao, tbÂ°, taÂ° < tho. Let a have a
quasiperiodicity 8a and b have Qb; both can interact only when
their own dynamics admit input (in technical terms, when the
Lipschitz condition is violated). Then a is first influenced by b
only at the first synchrony of Qa and %h, and when this occurs
depends on all of {tb<> â€” tao, Qa, Qb}. If a tries to "deduce" from its
first input, Vbl from b, whether tbÂ° â€” tao is positive or negative, it
has a most uncertain basis on which to do just that, even if both
processes have, for a while, monotonically increasing values
that are intermittently revealed through their windows.
I don't think we need all the delightful illustrations the
authors have provided, for if the percepts are based on the
consequences of nonlinear dynamics we should expect and even
predict curiosities in any comparative responses involving two
channels of input when those responses are constrained to
happen quickly, and particularly when the internal representa-
tions of inputs rise and fall at different rates. The reported
paradoxes will happen in sensation mechanisms, even if those
mechanisms have error-free internal memories of the outputs of
their lower level processes such as Va, Vb.
From my perspective, neither the Stalinesque nor the Or-
wellian theories seem necessary, and certainly no projections
backwards in time; we are not into parapsychology. Quite
simply, coupled discontinuous nonlinear processes can create
information that is misleading if there is an attempt to recon-
struct, at a fine-grained level, the precise history of the past
inputs, be it their past values x>r their past starting points.
I distrust examples about long-term memory errors in this
context; for example, if I cannot recall (without access to my
appointment book) whether I visited my bank manager or my
dentist first on a Tuesday six weeks ago, this is not the same sort
of failure as that occurring in phi-phenomena. There was no
confusion on that Tuesday, even if both visits involved painful
extraction, but each on that day had a clocktime label, and there
was for a while recall of the journey from one office to another
between the visits. Such vignettes are perhaps extended meta-
phors to illustrate Dennett & Kinsbourne's own theory, but
they actually arise in such slow real time, with so much collateral
input about clocktimes and sequence, that they are better
eschewed.
Some mistakes about consciousness and
their motivation

Consider the relationships between, and motivations for, the
various mistakes Dennett & Kinsbourne (D & K) diagnose,
which, as they rightly note, are strangely persistent. The first
mistake, Ml, is embodied in the metaphor of the Cartesian
Theatre, and is labelled by D & K "Cartesian materialism,"
which they describe in terms of the idea of a centered locus of
subjectivity in the brain where "it all comes together" into
consciousness, and which, though material, takes over the role
Descartes gave to the immaterial mind. The second mistake,
M2, is the conflation of properties of representings, or vehicles
of content, with properties represented, or of content itself. D &
K are especially concerned with temporal properties, where the
conflation is particularly tempting, but the conflation is mis-
taken quite generally.
These mistakes seem independent, in the (A) and (B) describe
possible positions:
A. There might be a central processing unit in which the
vehicles of all contents of consciousness were to be found, but
which did not use properties of those vehicles to represent
properties in content: did not use temporal sequence to repre-
sent temporal sequence, spatial properties to represent spatial
properties, and so forth.
B. Conversely, there might be a noncentral, temporally and
spatially distributed process that did use properties of vehicles
to represent properties in content (however inefficient that
might be). D & K in effect recognize that (B) is a possible
position in section 3.2. I suggest that what is really at issue here
is not the centrality in some privileged place of representation,
but rather the tendency to conflate properties of vehicles of
content with properties of their content, and that these issues
are indeed in many respects independent (but see remarks on
the unity of consciousness below). Sometimes in D & K's pre-
sentation their use of the theatre metaphor and talk of a central
privileged place obscures the fact that the work of their argu-
ment is really being done by the exposure of M2 (as is the case
with respect to M3 - see below). It is not clear why they regard
Ml and M2 as necessarily associated or how the central place
idea might explain the hold M2 has on us.
Why do we find it so hard to give the M2 conflation up? I don't
sympathize with M2, but I want to speculate further about the
source of its hold on us and to suggest that it has to do with both
the unity and reflexivity of consciousness. We seem to want the
relationship between vehicle and content to be an intrinsic one:
This vehicle must, by its very intrinsic nature, bear this content.
Moreover, it must do so transparently, so that the vehicle
displays the content it bears to anyone who cares to look. If
vehicles give themselves content in virtue of the copying of
properties of vehicles into their content, then these desires
seem to be met: Someone, some homunculus, can simply Ipok at
their intrinsic properties to see what their content is. And we're
off on the regress. We get started on it because we cannot accept
that properties of vehicles may carry their content, as it were,
blindly, in virtue of some mere mapping or contextual relation-
ship: Content then seems somehow too arbitrary, or too extrin-
sic and abstract to reflect the unity of self-conscious experience.
How could various abstract functional properties of mere events
amount to this specific unified field of experience, as I reflect on
my experience when I look out the window? Perhaps Ml, the
central place idea, is connected with M2, the conflation, by
reflection on the unity of consciousness: Perhaps out of a
misguided urge to understand the unity of the contents of
consciousness, we attribute features of unity to some central
processing place where all the vehicles get together - the
Cartesian Theatre. If we insist with D & K that relations of
vehicles cannot be just bodily hauled across the vehicle/qontent
distinction into content, and that properties of content cannot
be projected back onto their vehicles, the unity of consciousness
can be left looking very mysterious. Well, it is very mysterious;
but the point to keep hold of here is that the unity of the
collection of vehicles in the theatre provides only an illusion of
understanding the unity of consciousness. Part of the hold M2
has on us may also stem from a certain view of self-
consciousness: namely, that consciousness is a fully reflexive
relation; whatever it is that is conscious must be fully self-
conscious, conscious that it is conscious, so that the content of
consciousness must reflect that which is conscious. Hence the
tendency to project properties of "bearers" of contents of con-
sciousness into the contents of consciousness: to assume, in the
style of some of those D & K criticize, that the time of a
representing must be represented in the content of the repre-
senting, and hence that the representing of times licenses
inferences to the times of representing.
D & K also identify the mistake, M3, of thinking that there
must always be a fact of the matter as to whether experience is
revised by memory or tinkered with ab initio, whether the
Orwellian or Stalinesque ploys are operative. They illustrate
persuasively the way in which M3 depends in various cases on
M2. Just because certain temporal distinctions must apply to
vehicular processes, it doesn't follow that isomorphic distinc-
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2
211

Commentary/Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
tions must apply within content, so that there must be a fact of
the matter: was experience like this, then immediately altered
with all traces of revisionary tinkering removed, or like that all
along? In certain cases, D & K claim, there may be no difference
from any possible point of view, including the first person,
between these two possibilities, hence no fact of the matter.
Might M3 be motivated by anything other than M2? It might
seem to be independently motivated by antiverificationism or
by a kind of realism about experience. However, it's not at all
clear that the fact-of-the-matter view that M3 identifies as
mistaken can be defended by a sound antiverificationism or by
realism about experience. To claim that a difference in the
content of conscious experience must be a consciously experi-
enceable difference is not to subscribe to verificationism, of
which some may be tempted to accuse D & K. Nor is there an
issue here about possible inability to manifest nevertheless real
differences in experience: D & K's argument does not depend
on requiring manifestations to observers of differences of experi-
ence, but will run entirely from the unexpressed, introspective
first person viewpoint of content of experience. "Do the experi-
ments on yourself and see," they can say. Since D & K's position
onM3 does not need antirealism about experience, their view
cannot be resisted by means of realism about experience. To
object that the "observer" to whom manifestation is being
required is oneself at a slightly later time is to assume the
temporal atomism about consciousness that is D & K's target.
But one can reject such atomism without thereby adopting
antirealism about experience. If there are arguments indepen-
dent of antirealism about experience for rejecting such atomism,
such as arguments from what D & K call "temporal smear," then
realists as much as antirealists must adjust their conception of
the nature of consciousness - not merely their view of the
possibility of manifesting it.

There are situations in everyday life where actions in response
to visual events are clearly dissociated from conscious experi-
ence of the same events. We respond first and become aware
later. One example is when in driving a car we have to make a
change in trajectory because of a sudden obstacle: We con-
sciously see the obstacle after we have avoided it (and only then
do we experience retrospective fear!). Castiello et al. (1991)
designed a series of experiments in which they measured this
temporal dissociation. Suppose you are a subject in this experi-
ment: You are instructed to reach with a hand for an object
placed in front of you, as soon as it becomes illuminated, it will
take you approximately 330 ms on average to start moving. Now
suppose that, on a different set of trials, the experimenter's
instructions are simply that you signal (with a vocal utterance:
Tah!) at what instant you became aware of the illumination of the
object. The vocal response will take 380 ms to appear. Finally,
on still another set of trials, the instructions are to perform the
two tasks at the same time. Not unexpectedly, the values for
both the motor and the vocal reaction times will be found to be
very close to those measured in the previous sets of trials, that is,
the onset of hand movement aimed at the object will precede
the vocal response signalling your awareness of its change in
visual appearance by about 50 ms. This difference will not be
noticeable to you; you will feel that your hand movement
coincides with your perception of the illumination of the object.
Does this result mean that it takes approximately the same
amount of time for the brain to generate a motor response to a
visual event as it takes it to generate a subjective experience of
that same event? What would happen if the motor reaction time
were reduced? Would the time to awareness also become
shorter, or would it remain the same? The experiment for
answering these questions becomes a little more complicated:
You are now facing three identical objects, each separated by
about 10 cm. The instructions are as in the earlier version of the
experiment: reach for the object that is illuminated and signal
vocally the time at which you become aware of it. On most trials,
the central object alone is illuminated. On some occasions,
however, the light that illuminates the central object is sud-
denly shifted to one of the other two. This shift is triggered
exactly at the time of onset of the hand movement. In this event,
according to the instructions you received, you will have to
correct the direction of your hand movement in order to track
the second illuminated object, and to give a second vocal signal
to indicate the time when you became aware of the shift in
illumination. The first sign of correction of the hand trajectory
will appear early (about 100 ms) following the shift in illumina-
tion. By contrast, the vocal utterance corresponding to this same
event will come much later, on the order of 300 ins after the
beginning of the change in movement trajectory. Your subjec-
tive report will be in accordance with this temporal dissociation
between the two responses: You will report that you saw the
light jumping from the first to the second object near the end of
your movement, just at the time you were about to take the
object (sometimes even after you took it!).
The clearest effect observed in this series of experiments is
that the time to awareness of a visual event, as inferred from the
vocal response, retains a relatively constant value across differ-
ent conditions (for details and control experiments, see Castiello
et al. 1991). Under "normal" circumstances (i.e., where no time
pressure is imposed on performing the task) this value is roughly
compatible with the duration of motor reaction times. The
consequence of this compatibility is that when you make a
movement toward an object, you become aware of this object
near the time when the movement starts, or shortly after it has
started. Hence the apparent consistency between our actions
and the flow of our subjective experience. This consistency does
not seem to be affected by small differences in timing (up to 50
ms), but it breaks down when the difference increases, for
instance, when the motor reaction time becomes shorter under
conditions of time pressure, such as avoiding sudden obstacles
or tracking unexpected object displacements.
It would be tempting to speculate about the long duration of
our motor reaction times in normal, unperturbed, conditions.
Long reaction times might have the function of keeping our
subjective experience in register with our actions. Imagine what
our life would be if the above temporal dissociation were the
usual case, and if our awareness of the external events were
systematically delayed relative to our actions in response to
these events! More seriously, this dissociation between motor
responses and subjective experience, when it happens, as well
as the more usual synchrony between the two, reflect the
constraints imposed by brain circuitry during the processing of
neural information. Different aspects of the same event are
processed in different pathways. Pathological cases give many
examples of such dissociations created by lesions affecting one of
those pathways while sparing the others.
I do not fully agree with Dennett & Kinsboume when they
conclude that "the representation of sequence in the stream of
consciousness is a product of the brain's interpretive processes,
not a direct reflection of the sequence of events making up those
212

& Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
processes." I can certainly accept that the experienced sequence
of events does not reflect a sequence of processes, but this' is
only because the neural processing (of motor responses, of
object recognition, etc.) is not sequential and because it occurs
in parallel pathways (this is indeed what the Multiple Drafts
model is about). It happens that these pathways are tuned to
processing information at about the same rate, or, more cor-
rectly, that the rate of processing is globally constrained by the
slowness of the representational pathway. But the impression of
simultaneity that one gets is not an illusion or a post-hoc
reconstruction. The apparent synchrony (or the apparent dis-
synchrony) of awareness with other events (or the fact that the
awareness of a given event does or does not occur at all, are
directly related to the amount and the duration of neural
processing needed to achieve conscious experience. As shown
by the above experiments, consciousness is not immediate, it
takes time to appear (see Jeannerod, 1990, for review). Ade-
quate timing of neuronal activity in different brain areas is a
critical condition for achieving subjective temporal consistency
between external events.
Models of conscious timing and the
experimental ewidence

1. Cartesian Theater wersus Multiple Drafts models. The prob-
lem of how the brain "binds" various separately discriminated
contents into a unified subjective experience is an old one (e.g.,
Sherrington 1940). D & K argue that unifying processes are
themselves distributed, and as a result, the "point of view of the
observer is spatially smeared" (sect. 1.1). Such a spatially (and
also, they claim, temporally) smeared point of view will hardly
solve the problem of a unified conscious experience. If the
"Multiple Drafts model avoids the tempting mistake of suppos-
ing that there must be a single narrative . . . that represents the
actual stream of consciousness of the subject" (sect. 1.1, para. 9),
how does the Multiple Drafts model explain the actual experi-
ence of a single narrative we all have?
D & K's reason for believing that "slow transmission and
computation speeds of neurons" would create a temporal smear
of up to several hundred milliseconds is not a valid representa-
tion of the neurophysiological evidence. Transmission is fast
enough to get messages around in milliseconds, or tens of msec,
even when sy nap tic stations are involved. That there is nev-
ertheless a neural delay of up to 500 msec for the development of
a conscious experience is based on a requirement for suitable
repetition of neuronal patterns, as experimentally demon-
strated by Libet et al. (see Libet 1.973; 1982; 1989b; Libet et al.
1991). D & K go on to propose, mistakenly, that "we need other
principles to explain the ways in which subjective temporal
order is composed, especially in cases in which the brain must
cope with rapid sequences occurring at the limits of its powers of
temporal resolution" (sect. 1.1, para. 6). Rapid cognitive and
conative responses can be mediated by shorter-lasting activity
patterns and can be made unconsciously, without or before the
appearance of the subjective experience of an event (Libet 1965;
Libet et al. 1991). D & K confuse the ability to make conscious
discriminations of temporal intervals of, say, 50 msec with the
question of when one becomes aware of the discrimination; that
is, one may be able to discriminate a 50 msec interval and even
act on that (in a reaction time test) but not be aware of the
discrimination until some hundreds of msec later.
It seems clear to me that the various "temporal anomalies" of
consciousness (sect. 1.2), which D & K claim are best explained
by their Multiple Drafts model without the alleged erroneous
and confusing implications of the Cartesian Theater, can be
encompassed by either model. If D & K are proposing a serious
scientific theory it is incumbent upon them to indicate experi-
mental designs that could test and potentially falsify their
proposal. Since no such tests are offered by them, the Multiple
Drafts model is simply one special philosophical construction
that competes with the others.
Incidentally, D & K erroneously state that Libet (1982; 1985a)
"argued that these temporal anomalies are proof of the existence
of an immaterial mind that interacts with the brain in a physi-
cally inexplicable fashion" (sect. 1.2, para. 1; emphasis mine).
Libet has in fact said that the evidence and phenomena are
compatible with any theory of the mind-brain relation (e.g.,
Libet 1985a, pp. 536, 563, 564; 1981, p. 196). My statement
(Libet 1981, p. 196) that "the temporal discrepancy, (between
neural and subjective timing) creates relative difficulties for
identity theory, but that these are not insurmountable" does not
match D & K's ascription.
1.1. The representation of temporal properties versus the tem-
poral properties of representations. Libet etal. (1979; Libet 1982;
1989b) had already not only made this distinction explicitly but
they also obtained experimental evidence that directly demon-
strated it (in the subjective appearance of sensory experience
before the time of the adequate neural representation for the
experience). The timing content of the sensory experience does
not, however, appear in a "temporally sloppy way, anywhere in
the brain" (sect. 2.1), as D & K would have us believe in their
model. The experimental finding was that subjective timing of a
sensory event is rather rigidly correlated with, though not
necessarily identical to, that of the early primary cortical re-
sponse to the signal, even though this response does not itself
elicit the experience (Libet et al. 1979). In fact, in the absence of
that early neural reference signal the subjective timing is not
antedated and the sensory signal is subjectively experienced as
actually having a substantial delay related to the delayed neural
representation! Such a timing signal or "postmark" to instruct
the content of a subjective experience was thus experimentally
established by us long before Glynn (1990) suggested it was
theoretically possible (see Libet, 1991a, reply to Glynn).
1.2. "Orwellian" and "Stalinesque" revisions (sect. 2.2). The so-
called Orwellian postexperiential revision of memory or the
Stalinesque preexperiential introduction of unconscious pro-
cesses are both logically possible alternative explanations of
some observed responses by a subject. They have in principle
both been suggested earlier as possibilities (e.g., Libet et al.
1979; Libet 1978; 1.981; 1985a), without applying the pejorative
names of Stalin and Orwell to them.
Let us examine how D & K apply these arguments to the
phenomenon of metacontrast, in which a second stimulus can
inhibit or mask the reportable conscious experience of a preced-
ing, first stimulus. They add that "both the Orwellian and the
Stalinesque versions of the Cartesian Theater model can deftly
account for all the data - not just the data we already have, but
the data we can imagine getting in the future" (sect. 2.2, para.
19). Well, in our study of retroactive effects of a delayed cortical
stimulus on the reportable awareness of a preceding skin stim-
ulus, we found not only retroactive inhibition or masking but
also retroactive enhancement of the conscious sensation of the
initial skin stimulus (Libet 1978). Now, one might argue that our
retroactive masking could be due to obliteration of memory for
the skin sensation by the delayed cortical stimulus (although
there is no evidence for such a process when one uses a highly
localized cortical stimulus, and not a massive electroconvulsive
shock to the whole brain). But in retroactive enhancement there
is no memory loss at all; this finding therefore clearly supports
the view that the content of the experience can be modulated
before the experience appears. Of course, D & K may argue that
the retroactive enhancement could be due to an "intensified"
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2
213

Commentary/Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
memory rather than to a pre-experiential modification of con-
tent; but "intensification" of memory would be an ad hoc
construction without any evidence for such a process.
In our more recent study, we have shown that a brief train of
stimulus pulses (say 0.25 sec duration) in somatosensory
thalamus can elicit correct detection of the signal by subjects
even when they report feeling nothing and just guessing,
whereas a longer stimulus train (about 0.5 sec or more) converts
the responses from correct-with-no awareness to correct-with-
awareness (Libet et al. 1991). Memory is not an issue in any of
these trials; whether stimulus trains were short or long, subjects
made their forced choice detection selections and their reports
of awareness some seconds after stimulus delivery. Clearly,
subjects had a memory of the brief stimulus, which they later
correctly identified, but no reportable awareness. How would D
& K's models deal with this unconscious detection of brief
stimuli? Is there still no distinction between unconscious and
conscious time factors?
2* "The Libet controwersies re-examined" (sect. 3)
2.1. Technical criticisms. D & K takes it upon themselves to
pronounce that Libet's experiments have "serious technical
flaws" (sect. 3.1), that the experiments only "allegedly" show
backwards referral, that "technical criticisms of his experiments
and their interpretation raise doubts about the existence of the
phenomena he claims to have discovered" (sect. 1.2, para. 2),
etc. One would have expected thoughtful scholars to be more
cautious about such pronouncements. D & K's referenced
authority for all this is P. S. Churchland (1981a), who is a
philosopher with minor experience in experimental neuro-
science. Churchland's criticisms were replied to in detail by
Libet (1981), for readers who wish to re-examine that con-
troversy. There were some "additional arguments about inter-
pretation of some of the data by some of the commentators on
my BBS target article on voluntary action fo which I also replied
(Libet 1985a). It should be noted that both of our experimental
papers on the temporal anomalies had to pass rigorous peer
review by the leading journal of neurology Brain (Libet et al.
1979; 1983a), whose editorial staff included distinguished ex-
perimental neuroscientists. These experimental findings have
also received acceptance in international and national forums of
neuroscience where they have been frequently presented since
1964. Interested readers should, in any case, check our original
papers to satisfy themselves about the technical questions
raised. When I challenged Dennett in a recent symposium to
name specific difficulties with our findings, he raised that of
regarding the subject's reported "clock time" as a valid indicator
of the actual time of the subjects' conscious intention. The
difficulty could arise in view of our own evidence for a delay of
up to 0.5 sec before there is neuronal adequacy for the appear-
ance of the visual experience of the clock-time. This difficulty
had already been raised in commentaries by Latto (1985) and
Rollman (1985) and replied to by Libet (1985a), to which readers
are referred.
D & K specifically state as technical indictments that Libet's
experiments "involved very few subjects, were inadequately
controlled, and have not been replicated" (sect. 3.1, para. 1). In
fact hundreds of subjects have been studied by us over the
years. As indicated in our paper on subjective referral (Libet et
al. 1979), results in a large number of subjects contributed to the
development of the argument, but only in a relatively small
number of patients could we run sufficiently elaborate and
complete studies amenable to rigorous statistical analysis. How-
ever, this was sufficient to make the findings not only qualita-
tively but statistically convincing. Since when is the precise
number of subjects necessarily a controlling factor in obtaining
significant results? It is of course the amount and kind of data on
each individual that is crucial. Clearly, the editors of Brain, with
a professional background in dealing with research on human
patients, regarded the data as sufficient for establishing our
conclusions. They also found no difficulties with the controls, as
detailed in the paper, something that scientific reviewers pay
special attention to. But readers may check these points for
themselves, in our original papers.
The additional charge, that our experiments "have not been
replicated," displays a lack of understanding about such re-
search as well as of awareness of some actual replications. To
carry out the studies with intracranial electrodes in fully awake,
cooperative human subjects requires the availability of special
patients as well as an interested neurosurgeon willing to make
the proper effort needed for a basic research study that has no
direct clinical implications at all; it also requires a neuroscientist
(like myself) with the dogged determination and patience to
pursue such a difficult study and with the ability to ask soluble
questions amenable to workable experimental designs. It is
therefore frustrating to be told that our basic experimental
findings are questionable and flawed because others have not
sweated it out through similar studies. Mind you, D & K do not
cite any contradictory results. In fact, to the extent that others
have attempted similar experiments, there have been some
confirmations. The study on the timing of conscious intention in
relation to onset of cerebral activity (readiness-potential) has
been completely duplicated by Keller and Heckhausen (1990),
although these authors proposed a different interpretation of
our results (to which I have now submitted a reply, Libet
1991b). Further information of that study, which does not
require intracranial electrodes, has been made by Howard
Shevrin and a co-worker (unpublished). The inability of a single
stimulus pulse to somatosensory cortex or to sensory (ven-
trobasal) thalamus to elicit any conscious sensory experience in a
human subject (Libet et al. 1964; 1967) has been confirmed
separately by the neurosurgeons Ronald Tasker and Robert G.
Grossman (personal communications) and by Vahe Amassian et
al. (who stimulated sensory cortex with an extracranial elec-
trode); the more elaborate studies of full neural delay and
subjective antedating have yet to be attempted by others.
2.2. Neural delay for sensory experience and subjective antedat-
ing. D &â€¢ K mistakenly believe that our estimate of up to 500
msec, for achieving "neuronal adequacy" to elicit a conscious
sensory experience, "is determined by seeing how late, fol-
lowing initial stimulation (to the skin) a direct cortical stimula-
tion can interfere with the consciousness subsequently re-
ported" (sect. 3.1, para. 5). The "up to 500 msec" value was in
fact based upon (a) the stimulus duration required in the
cerebral sensory pathway from skin to somatosensory cortex; (b)
the requirement of late event-related-potentials in the cortical
response to a skin stimulus; (c) the interval for retroactive effects
of a delayed initial stimulus (the one mentioned by D & K); and
(d) the discontinuous jump in reaction times, from 200-300
msec to 600-700 msec, when subjects are asked to slow their
reaction time deliberately by only 100 msec or so (e.g., Libet
1981).
Later in section 3.1, D & K ask how Libet can deal with the
possibility that there could have been a replacement of the
veridical memory of an early conscious experience of the skin
stimulus with a false memory, namely, that the skin sensation
never occurred. (This alternative would be opposed to our
proposal that our retroactive masking is evidence for inter-
ference with cortical processes that are developing the sensory
experience during the hundreds of msec after the skin pulse). I
have already replied to this possible alternative by noting that
we observed retroactive enhancement as well as masking (Libet
1978; 1981); there is no loss of memory with enhancement. Of
course, I cannot prevent D & K from inserting an Orwellian
demon who will also change the memory of the nature of an
experience so that the sensation is "falsely" remembered as
being stronger than with no conditioning cortical stimulus; why
this demon should revise memories in this specific way only
when skin stimuli are followed by cortical stimuli is a question D
& K will have to answer!
Since "falsifying the memory" of an experience is offered by D
214
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

Commentary/Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
& K as a general alternative explanation for instances of non-
reportable awarenesses, how would they deal with the following
experimental findings in our tests of the subjective referral
hypothesis: Stimulation of medial lemniscus (LM) was set at an
intensity that required a minimum 200 msec train of pulses to
elicit any conscious sensation. If we reduced the train to 150
msec the subject reported feeling absolutely nothing. But if the
200 msec LM stimulus was paired with a single stimulus pulse to
the skin, delivered at the start of the 200 msec LM stimulus, the
subject reported that the LM-induced sensation started at the
same time as the skin-induced sensation (Libet et al. 1979). In D
& K's Orwellian model, the experience should have actually
occurred at the beginning of the LM train (or at least at the same
early time as that reported for the skin stimulus), rather than (as
in our "Stalinesque" antedating model) at or after the end of the
LM train and then subjectively referred back in time to the
cortical response to the first of the LM stimulus pulses. If D &
K's Orwellian model were a valid alternative, why does the
subject report no sensation at all with a 150 msec train in LM?
That is, if the experience actually appeared at the onset of the
LM train, why should it "disappear" if the train lasts 150 msec
but be reportable if the train is 200 msec? Our clear explanation
for this paradox is that the primary evoked cortical response to
even the first LM stimulus serves as a specific timing reference
for subjective antedating of the experience, which cannot actu-
ally appear until the end of the 200 msec train. Also, how would
Orwellian memory revision explain the different subjective
timings for LM versus cortically induced sensations? Our postu-
late in fact also explains simply (a) why the sensation induced by
a stimulus train to somatosensory cortex is not subjectively
reported to coincide with a skin pulse, contrary to the case for
LM, as the cortical stimulus does not generate the required
primary evoked response; and (b) why a patient with unilateral
destruction of the ascending specific pathway (that elicits the
primary evoked response) subjectively times a stimulus to the
affected hand as coming several hundred msec after one to
the normal hand when both stimuli are simultaneous (Libet et
al. 1979; see also Libet 1981)!
D & K also present (sect. 3.1) an extended criticism of our
asking subjects to report their awarenesses unhurriedly, within
a few seconds after each stimulus trial. They ask what is wrong
with the vocal reaction time (R.T.) experiment of Churchland
(1981a), who asked subjects to say "go" as soon as they were
conscious of a skin stimulus. This issue was already replied to
(Libet 1981), but this apparently needs repeating. The point is
not that we can disprove Churchland's contention about what
her subjects were reporting; it is rather that it is clearly possible
for those subjects to yell "go" before they are actually aware of
the stimulus and that, therefore, such responses cannot be taken
to be valid primary indicators of the time of the experience.
What do D & K (and Churchland) think subjects think they are
doing in the usual R.T. experiment when asked to press a button
(instead of yelling "go") as soon as they are conscious of the
stimulus? Well, there is conclusive evidence that, regardless of
what they think, subjects can press a button with exactly the
same reaction time whether they are aware of the stimulus or
not (Taylor & McCloskey 1990)!
Incidentally, the spurious comments related to "'absolute'
time, as Libet would put it" (see end of sect. 3.1), are based on a
misrepresentation of my position against being able to discern
absolute subjective time (e.g., Libet, 1989a, in reply to a BBS
Editorial Commentary).
2.3. "Libet's claims about the 'subjective delay' of consciousness
of intention" (sect. 3.2). It's difficult to deal with D & K arguments
on this (and other issues) as they are distributed among a variety
of contexts in their target article. In an earlier section (sect.
1.2D) D & K argue that this temporal anomaly may appear to
violate the principle that causes precede their effects. This
would only be true if D & K want to insist that neural events that
initiate a voluntary act must also immediately produce the
conscious intention for that act. But the experimental evidence
is precisely that the initiating neural events produce conscious
intention, but only after a delay of about 350 msec; where is the
violation of cause and effect if conscious intention is not in fact
the initiator of a voluntary action?
D & K attribute to me a description of events leading to the
appearance of conscious intention (sect. 3.2, para. 9) that seems
patently irrelevant. Nowhere in our findings or interpretation is
it necessary for the subject's task to include having to decide
which of the "spot-representations marching past, having made
their way slowly from the retina" should designate the moment
of conscious intention. The visual signals from the "clock" move
rapidly (not slowly) to their representations at the cortex in a
matter of some tens of msec at most; but such intervals are not
significant when we are finding a delay of 350 msec for report-
able conscious intention to appear after onset of a cerebral
volitionary process. Further, our finding is noncommittal about
whether the representation of the conscious experience is one of
"arrival at a point" or "a matter of representation exceeding some
threshold of activation over the whole cortex or large parts
thereof."
In Section 3.3, D & K state that "Libet's experiment created
an artificial and difficult judgmental task that robbed the results
of the hoped-for significance." The task was no more artificial
than many other experimental designs and the subjects did not
find it difficult after some practice. The Grey Walter experiment
that D & K believe to be a superior one easily involved as
artificial and difficult a task as ours. Grey Walter's use of the
signal from motor cortex to activate the slide projector only
showed that motor cortex becomes active before one's muscles
move in a voluntary action; he did not determine quantitatively
the subject's reportable time of conscious intention. Grey Wal-
ter's subjects evidently reported not being able to veto their
own initiated button push. That is of course explainable by the
observation that the "motor potential" at the motor cortex
appears at about 50 msec before muscle activation (Deecke et al.
1976); this is too late for any conscious control to be able to
intervene, as the final motor commands are already in process
(McCloskey et al. 1983). In our study (Libet et al. 1983b)
subjects were able to veto after the time of conscious intention
(W) which appears 200 msec before muscle activation and well
before the motor potential. D & K's attempt to explain the
inability of Grey Walter's subject to veto, as a "natural interpre-
tation for the brain to settle on," is a meaningless non-neural
construction.
Toward an identity theory of consciousness
Dan Lloyd
Department of Philosophy, Trinity College, Hartford, CT 06106
Electronic mail: dlloyd@trincc.bitnet
The concept of representation is perhaps the single most useful
idea in cognitive science, and Dennett & Kinsbourne (D & K)
apply it well in their diagnosis of anomalies of subjective experi-
ence of sequence. Representations can misrepresent; vehicles
of representation need not share properties with what they
represent (specifically, representations need not mimic the
spatial and temporal properties of their objects). Either of these
ideas is sufficient to undermine the extravagant conclusions (of
Libet and others) criticized in the target article.
Descartes, pioneer of the good idea of the representational
mind, also left us several bad ideas. D & K indict the idea of a
Cartesian bottleneck, a single central theater in which the brain
projects its information into subjective consciousness. Two
Cartesian ideas are combined in the theater metaphor: The
singularity of states of consciousness, one per brain per instant,
and the introspective interiority of states of consciousness, each
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

Commentary I Dennett & Kinsboorne: Time and the observer
a state of self-consciousness arising from and directed at an-
other, separate, brain state. D & K effectively summarize the
case against singularity, but are less explicit on introspection.
For example, the authors state that the onsets of many dis-
tributed "localized discriminations" and "content-fixations" "do
not mark the onset of awareness of their content. It is always an
open question whether any particular content thus discrimi-
nated will eventually appear as an element in conscious experi-
ence." The motivation for this distinction may be a desire to
undermine the correspondence between subjective (reported)
sequences and the underlying sequence of sensory discrimina-
tions, introduced in the discussion of the Libet experiments.
Nonetheless, the general skepticism about representation of
judgments and the mistrust of verbal reports as an absolute
index of consciousness suggest that D & K are no friends of
consciousness-as-introspection.
Beyond these important critical contributions, do D & K
advance a positive theory of consciousness? I think that, con-
trary to their claim, the multiple drafts model is not a theory of
consciousness, for the reason suggested by the quotation above:
Some parts of the multiple parallel streams are conscious, and
some are not. In this unexplicated distinction of conscious and
unconscious cognition, D & K run the risk of replacing the
central Cartesian theater with the equivalent of a suburban
cinema complex, wherein many parallel streams of information
project onto various screens of conscious awareness. The bot-
tleneck may be gone, but the problem of consciousness remains
at each of cinemas I through N. Ironically, D & K's deconstruc-
tive strategy - emphasizing the conspiracy of the where and
when of consciousness - can afflict each rough draft in the
multiple drafts model as surely as it undermines the Cartesian
theater. Where does a local discrimination begin and end?
When does the rough draft of an experience form? The problem
of spatial and temporal smearing persists all the way down.
Consider an arbitrary neuron in the visual cortex. Should its
activity be regarded as a single cognitive event or process, or
part of an event involving other neurons? If the latter, should
this neuron be grouped with others in its layer? Its column? Its
inputs and outputs? Should its activity be regarded as part of a
state of consciousness?
From the difficulty of these questions - a spatial and temporal
smear campaign - D & K correctly conclude that the distinction
between conscious and unconscious processing is arbitrary and
"lapses at close quarters." At this point one might be tempted by
some form of antirealism about consciousness, and indeed
similar arguments recur in Dennett's work, undermining naive
faith in the reality of a wide variety of cognitive states. Unfortu-
nately for antirealism, all such arguments collapse in the face of
the reality of conscious experience, as undeniable for us as it was
for Descartes. There are states of conscious awareness. The job
of a theory of consciousness is to say what consciousness is. The
multiple drafts model may identify an important property of
consciousness, but fragmenting consciousness neither dissolves
nor explains it.
The positive theory, however, is at hand. D & K argue that no
effective distinction can be drawn between conscious and un-
conscious cognition. Why not view this result positively? If
there is no distinction between conscious and unconscious
representation, why not just identify consciousness and repre-
sentation? An identity theory of consciousness would hold that
conscious processing is cognitive (representational) processing,
that conscious experience and cognitive science offer different
descriptions of one and the same complex process. This is a
substantive view, offering a genuine account of the nature of
consciousness, and it has many independent virtues (see Lloyd
1989; 1991). Dennett and Kinsbourne may balk at the proposal
on the grounds that any complex cognition results from elabo-
rate preprocessing, necessitating swarms of unconscious micro-
representations. But their parsimonious rejection of unneces-
sary re-presentations should also undermine unnecessary
pr^-presentations. Models of distributed representation and
processing, abundant in both connectionism and cognitive neu-
roscience, indicate the power of simultaneous soft constraints to
mold complex recognitions with very little preprocessing of
inputs. Narrative consciousness might well frame its first extem-
poraneous drafts on otherwise blank pages.
The target article undermines every attempt at a functional
distinction between conscious and unconscious processing. I for
one will be very interested to see what Dennett & Kinsbourne
are willing to conclude from their own well-argued premises.
UnCartesian materialism
introspection
William G. Lycan
Department of Philosophy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC
27599-3125
Dennett & Kinsbourne (D & K) have made a solid case against
Cartesian materialism. In particular, I am persuaded that rela-
tive to present evidence, the "turnstile of consciousness" as-
sumption is unmotivated if not gratuitous, and that the famous
"temporal anomalies" give us excellent reason to reject it in favor
of the Multiple Drafts model.1 My purpose in this commentary
is only to assess the impact of the Multiple Drafts model on my
favorite theory of consciousness, that is, Locke's introspective or
"inner sense" account, as physicalistically implemented by
Armstrong (1968; see also Lycan 1987, Ch. 6; 1990).
According to the inner sense theory, conscious awareness is
the successful operation of an internal scanner or monitor that
outputs second-order representations of first-order psychologi-
cal states. But an "internal scanner" sounds awfully like an
internal audience seated in a Cartesian Theater, even if it and
the Theater are made of physical stuff; is the inner sense view
not then committed to Cartesian materialism? And do D & K's
arguments not bear negatively on the probity of introspection
itself?2
It should be clear that the inner sense view itself is in no way
committed to Cartesian materialism. For even if an internal
scanner resembles an internal audience in some ways, the
"audience" need not be seated in a Cartesian Theater: There
need be no single, executive scanner, and no one scanner or
monitor need view the entire array of first-order mental states
accessible to consciousness. Accordingly, there need be neither
a "turnstile of consciousness" nor one central inner stage on
which the contents of consciousness are displayed in one fixed
temporal order. An internal monitor is an attention mechanism
that can presumably be directed upon representational sub-
systems and their stages; no doubt internal monitors work
selectively and piecemeal and their operations depend on con-
trol windows and other elements of conative context, just as is
predicted by the Multiple Drafts model On this point, the
inner sense theory has already parted with Cartesian material-
ism, and in the direction of D & K's view.
Indeed, the Multiple Drafts model supports the inner sense
theory in an important way: It predicts introspective fallibility of
two characteristic sorts. First, D & K emphasize that the result
of a probe is a. judgment made by the subject, a judgment that
does not (or not eo ipso) simply report a "presentation" to an
inner audience. And the "temporal anomalies" alone should
have made us question the reliability of introspective reports.
Introspection (Orwellian, Stalinist, or neuter) gets small tem-
poral details wrong. That tends to confirm rather than to impugn
the inner sense view of consciousness. If conscious awareness is
indeed a matter of introspective attention and if introspection is
the operation of a monitor or self-scanner, then such anomalies
216
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

Commentary/Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
were to be expected - for monitors and scanners are charac-
teristically fallible on details, and D & K show admirably how
such devices might corporately mix up temporal sequence in
particular.
Second, the Multiple Drafts model predicts the nonexistence
of a single "optimal time of probing," and (more drastically)
ensures that probing "changes the task," that is, interferes with
the very process it purports to be monitoring. That too is good
news for the inner sense theory. For if introspection is the
operation of a monitor or self-scanner, then revisionary effects of
the present sort are again just what we should have expected;
monitoring instruments (such as ammeters) typically do affect
the values of the magnitudes they measure.
What, then, of introspection's own efficacy? Note carefully
that this question is entirely independent of the inner sense
issue. But note also that the scope of unreliability exhibited by
the anomalies and the Multiple Drafts model is very small, tied
to temporal differences within the tiny intervals involved, a
small fraction of a second in each case. Thus, so far as has been
shown, the fallibility is insignificant for most scientific and
philosophical purposes even though it is crucial in sorting out
the "temporal anomalies."
In any case, the inner sense theory of consciousness survives
the collapse of Cartesian materialism, and is even strengthened
by it.
NOTES
1. But for the record, I am completely wnpersuaded by D & K's claim
that the Orwellian and Stalinesque accounts of (e.g.) color phi differ
"only . . . verbal[ly]." Can't we finally call a halt to these creaking
verificationist arguments? (Putnam 1965).
2. In an earlier draft of their paper which I was given in February of
1991, D & K made several arguments more specifically against the
efficacy of introspection. Foolishly continuing to work with that MS
instead of transferring my marginalia to BBS's official preprint, I wrote a
commentary criticizing the several arguments point for point. When I
then checked my own commentary draft against the preprint for page-
numbering purposes, I was aghast to find that each of the three sections
on which I had focussed had been crisply excised - it seems temporally
before I had written my commentary (!). At first this seemed magical, a
precognition on D & K's part enabling them to avoid criticism by
retroactive withdrawal; but then I realized it was only an instance of the
Multiple Drafts phenomenon itself, indeed a better case than D & K's
own word-processing example; more power to the Multiple Drafts
model.
Little "me"
Drew McDermott
Computer Science Department, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520
Electronic mail: mcdermott@cs.yale.edu
My problem with commenting on this target article is that I
agree with it so completely and have trouble seeing how anyone,
in this day and age, could disagree. I suppose one could take
issue with the details of the Multiple Drafts model, but the
details aren't really the issue. We find the world divided
between those, like Dennett & Kinsboume (D & K), who think
that the computing brain is primary and the conscious mind
derivative, and their traditionalist opponents, who think the
opposite. For the first camp, the anomalies discussed by D & K
are not really anomalies. There is just not that much to explain.
It is too bad that they seem so bizarre to those who think that a
primary fact about the conscious mind is that it is an infallible
knower of itself. Unfortunately, those who persist in this quaint
traditional attitude are in the majority.
I take the Multiple Drafts model, in essence, to be this: I am a
character in a story my brain is making up. Consciousness is a
property I have by virtue of my brain's attributing it to me. My
story doesn't have to cohere completely to be useful. Sometimes
it gets a bit ragged around the edges, as in the experiments
discussed by D & K.
It's not hard to find other examples of the breakdown of the
concept of the self. Consider the following true story: I recently
had to badger some colleagues about some bureaucratic forms. I
got a bundle of these forms, and went looking for the colleagues.
I didn't find many of them, so I switched to a different errand. It
involved carrying a very similar bundle of papers to a completely
different destination. Along the way, I encountered one of the
colleagues I had been seeking before. I told him I had been
looking for him to give him a form, and proceeded to hand him
one of the papers in my hand. I realized my mistake halfway
through the gesture. I took the paper back, and went on my way.
Then I met another wayward colleague, and went through
roughly the same encounter again, including the mistake.
Question: On each occasion, at the moment I grasped the
paper with the intention of unloading it, did I or did I not believe
that I had grasped a copy of Bureaucratic Form A? To which the
correct answer is: The concept of "I" has broken down in this
situation. You can investigate the phenomenology of such an
experience ad infinitum (Did I believe for an instant? Did I
believe one way and act another?) but you'd be on a wild-goose
chase. The proper explanation lies in tracing the flow of signals
in my brain. Furthermore, the phenomenology is just another
consequence of that flow.
The support for computational models of consciousness like
Multiple Drafts is that they are the only current contenders for a
materialist theory of consciousness. Against that support we
have (by my count) three sorts of objection: introspective,
epistemological, and ethical. The introspective objection is that
I feel quite different from what the theory suggests I am. The
epistemological objection is that all my knowledge is grounded
in what I perceive, so "I" can't be derivative. The ethical
objection is that if selves turn out to be constructs of
information-processing systems, it will be hard to say why they
are of any value.
These are serious objections, and one might be justified in
heeding them, given the weak support for computationalist
theories. But let me try to explain why the objections have so
little force for me.
The introspective objection goes like this: I wake up in the
morning. My eye opens, and a "point of view" pops into being. I
ponder whether to try to go back to sleep or get up. Or do I only
seem to ponder? Can it really be that there are several equally
complex agents governing my behavior at such a moment, that
conspire to invent this single person who is now thinking about
getting up? Could they be inventing other persons at the same
time, that I am unaware of? How many selves could my head
hold?
Or put it another way: Suppose I met a person who behaved
just like a real person, but was actually an unconscious zombie.
Perhaps that's not possible, but if is, then presumably there
would be a difference in the way that person's brain processed
information. Upon inspection, one could find the exact place
where my brain maintained a model of a conscious self, and his
did not. But intuitively it seems that one could stare at my
"circuit diagram" all day and still not believe that that was all
there was to being conscious. Surely, you would speculate, one
could have all that circuitry and still be a zombie (or still_not have_
qualia, or whatever).
This is where you have to decide whether you are really a
materialist or, in your heart, a dualist. Presumably, on any
materialist theory, there is something like a circuit diagram (or a
chemical reaction, or something) which goes through certain
motions that constitute consciousness. Introspection is always
going to be at odds with such a theory. The nice thing about a
Multiple-Drafts-style model is that it explains exactly why the
conflict seems so irreconcilable: The brain makes up a story in
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2
217

Commentary/Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
which the main character is quite different from a piece of
circuitry.
Even if you dislike computationalist theories, I don't see how
you can take introspective evidence seriously and still be a
materialist. Introspection long ago ceased to be an important
tool of psychological experimentation because it became so clear
how unreliable it is. Episodes like my adventure with the
bureaucratic forms routinely expose cracks in our attempts to
trust the introspective model of the self. The experimental
results discussed by D & K drive wedges deeply into those
cracks.
The second objection, the epistemological one, has the least
force for me, but, I suspect, the most for the average philoso-
pher. For hundreds of years, the problem of extrapolating from
sensory experience to knowledge has been central to philoso-
phy. A materialist theory of experience will make it necessary to
rethink the epistemological issues without starting from experi-
ence. The basic data of knowledge were supposed to be facts like
"I am experiencing a barn-shaped visual percept," from which
one was supposed to infer conjectures like "There's a barn in
front of me." If we take a computationalist model seriously, then
this whole story is a fantasy about a fantasy. What actually
happens is that (a) people are quite good at recognizing barns -
i.e., they have reliable barn detectors; (b) they also, when
required, automatically make up stories about how they do it,,
involving barn-shaped percepts.
So what's the problem? The epistemologist wants to ask how
the person can ever be sure there's a barn there. He can't be
sure, we answer, but if we perform experiments we discover
he's right 99% of the time. No, no, that's not the problem, the
epistemologist explains. The problem is, How can I be sure? I
can't step outside myself and do the experiments on my brain
and the alleged barns.1
This is where a computationalist theory of consciousness
demands that you rethink the problem. The epistemological
problem is not about how I can be sure, because "I" am not that
important. I'm just something my brain made up. It seems to my
self that it could exist without my brain existing, or any other
physical object, but this impression turns out to be an error.
Once it's explained what selves actually are, it will be clear that
they require a computational substrate to exist. Solipsism as
even a logical possibility will fade away. A self can no more exist
by itself than a wave can exist without water.2
The dethroning of the self brings us to the third objection,
ethics, which is the most crucial. Perhaps the consequences of
believing D & K's theory are so awful that even if it is true we
should suppress it. It has always seemed axiomatic that if I care
about nothing else in the world, I can about "the dear self."3 If
the self is just a construct, then who cares whether it cares about
itself? But what else is there to care about?
I don't know how to answer this objection, but we had better
think of an answer, lest the twenty-first century be even more
wasteful of human life than the twentieth. We used to be able to
say things like "I impose cognitive categories on the world (space
and time), and I impose ethical categories, too." But it is a
consequence of materialism that such powers are far beyond
little "I." If people are valuable, it is not because they are
imperishable souls connected to bodies only for a brief sojourn.
They have to be valuable for some other reason. For now, we
just have to take it as a postulate that creatures that invent
conscious selves are to be cherished and protected more than
other information-processing systems. We're not going to get
very far with inanities like "All life wants to survive and repro-
duce," which, even if were true, would only explain why people
keep going when they don't stop to think. If we don't find a
better ethical foundation, then well have to conclude that the
examined life is not worth living.
Kant used to claim that he had wrought a "Copernican
revolution" in philosophy, but it is becoming clear that what he
actually achieved was a "Ptolemaic counter-reformation" that
postponed the true revolution for a couple of centuries. Now a
real Copernican shift is upon us. Such things are never pleasant.

1. I realize that few philosophers nowadays would accept such a naive
statement of the classic empiricist puzzle. So substitute a more sophisti-
cated version, such as: How can I achieve intentionality â€” the ability to
think about a particular object outside myself â€” when a brain can only
process signals and symbols?

Can conscious and unconscious processes be distinguished
empirically? No amount of precision in measurement is in itself
sufficient. Equal emphasis, on methodological rigor and concep-
tual clarity is necessary for genuine progress. Methodologically,
the study of the unconscious involves illusive and fragile phe-
nomena, difficult to replicate findings, and inconsistent and
sometimes inadequate measurement criteria (see Eriksen 1960;
Holender 1986; Merikle 1982; Reingold & Merikle 1988; 1990).
Conceptually, definitional and terminological chaos and implicit
assumptions that are rarely acknowledged fuel the often futile
controversy between "believers" and "nonbelievers" in the
unconscious (see Dunn & Kirsner 1988; 1989; Erdelyi 1985;
1986; Lockhart 1989; Reingold & Merikle 1988; 1990;
Richardson-Klavehn & Bjork 1988). Not surprisingly, these
difficulties have prompted practical researchers to stay clear of
the conscious/unconscious distinction (Searle 1991), while re-
lated phenomena have been investigated under a variety of
different dichotomies (e.g., attended/unattended, inten-
tional/incidental, explicit/implicit, overt/covert, controlled/
automatic, etc.). Yet the terms consciousness and awareness still
seem to preserve best the historical link among related ideas;
moreover their very ambiguity is an accurate reflection and a
constant reminder of the vagueness of the theoretical constructs
and their relation to empirical work in this area.
It is precisely in this context that Dennett & Kinsbourne (D &
K) make a truly unique contribution. They not only expose
brilliantly an important confusion between the temporal prop-
erties of the process of representing and the temporal content of
the representations themselves, but they also provide powerful
metaphors that may help one avoid sliding back into this
ingrained confusion.
An inadvertent consequence, however, of D & K's very
compelling case against attempts to time the emergence of
consciousness and against the Cartesian notion of a transition
between the unconscious and the conscious realms, may be
an underestimation of the importance of the conscious/
unconscious distinction. Although one can agree with the au-
thors' portrayal of the graceful interplay between conscious and
unconscious processes, and its temporal indeterminacy, this
should not prevent us from trying to explore and explain the
qualitative differences between these processes. This line of
work would complement D & K's arguments; their very effec-
tive critique of nonquestions should be coupled with alternative
questions. It is precisely because consciousness cannot be
temporally or spatially localized in the brain that identifying
qualitative differences between conscious and unconscious pro-
cesses is crucial for the conscious/unconscious distinction. In-

deed, the method of establishing such differences (e.g., Chees-
man & Merikle 1986; Dixon 1971; 1981; Jacoby & Whitehouse
1989; Jacoby et al. ' 1989; Merikle & Reingold 1990; 1991;
Shevrin & Dickman 1980) may provide the ultimate test for the
value of the conscious/unconscious distinction. More specifi-
cally, if the difference between conscious and unconscious
processing is quantitative rather than qualitative, then the merit
of agonizing over this distinction becomes highly questionable
(see Cheesman & Merikle 1986). Perhaps in their response, D &
K could specify where they stand on this issue.
On a more general level, Libet's work (see Libet 1985a; 1987;
1989a), reconsidered by D & K, is an example of the dissociation
paradigm for the study of the unconscious (see Erdelyi .1985;
1986). Briefly, this requires two indices of processing, one
which reflects information available to consciousness and an-
other which reflects information available irrespective of con-
sciousness. As elaborated elsewhere (Reingold & Merikle 1988;
1990), when consciousness is defined in terms of subjective
report or claimed awareness, as in Libet's research, the dissocia-
tion paradigm yields ample evidence for unconscious process-
ing. However, there is no general consensus as to the adequacy
of such a definition. In fact, no operational definition of con-
scious awareness can be justified solely on an a priori basis; each
requires convergent empirical evidence to establish its validity.
Thus, the qualitative-differences approach may help validate
any proposed index of consciousness.
Content and conformation: isomorphism in
neural sway
Mark Rollins
Department of Philosophy, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63130
Electronic mail: c34801mr@wuvmd.bitnet
Dennett & Kinsbourne (D & K) make a compelling case against
two assumptions: (a) There is a canonical description of the
content of consciousness, (b) Temporal content must be repre-
sented by temporal properties of neural events. However, the
argument leaves open the possibility of a role for temporal
isomorphism. D & K argue primarily against the general need
for isomorphism and secondarily against the plausibility of it.
The primary attack is convincing; but two points have to be
reckoned with for the second: (1) The necessity claim can be
seen as inherently task-relative. Isomorphism may be required
for some temporal tasks only, not across the board. (2) The
appeal to isomorphism need not commit the canonical fallacy.
Thus, isomorphism cannot be seen as incredible merely because
it keeps bad company.
1. Indeterminacy of content goes all the way in; there are
many accounts that the brain itself might construct that are
equally compatible with the data available to it. Of course, we do
behave as if our experience made sense to us. Though multiple
representations of conscious experience can coexist, they could
not, without pathology, all actually constitute consciousness
simultaneously. Thus, anticanonical arguments notwithstand-
ing, D & K can claim that there is a "natural" interpretation for
the brain to settle on; namely, a state that is typically the
proximal cause of the subjects' reports. The state is natural
because it is an inference caused to occur by the events in
question, guided by the need to simplify and explain. But the
fact that people impose a reportable interpretation does not
mean it is the best possible one.
The temptation, then, is to try to rescue a canon by relativiz-
ing privileged versions of experience to passing "situations:"
One version will rule, but it's one per situation. Unfortunately,
the taxonomy of tasks that would distinguish different situations
is underdetermined and indeterminate, too; no matter how
narrowly a task is circumscribed, there will always be more than
one good version of the experiences that occur in its
performance.
But this raises an obvious problem. D & K give a reluctant
nod to isomorphism by conceding that content is partly deter-
mined by when representing begins and ends. But, they argue,
initiating constraints only matter early in the representational
process (they can be disregarded later); and temporal control
boundaries are only significant for certain kinds of task.
The problem is that, given the indeterminacy of tasks and D &
K's emphasis on changes from moment to moment, there will be
no single beginning and ending points, no one temporal window
on the brain's representing. That might be thought to make any
concession to isomorphism unnecessary. But the point cuts both
ways: If the need for isomorphism is taken to be task-relative,
then a defender can argue for an extensive role for it by arguing
independently for the right sort of task parameters: narrow
subevents, with significant beginning and ending constraints,
on which larger events depend.
2. It's important that no best isomorphism need be implied;
no "optimorphism," as we might call it. The unspoken assump-
tion is that order is the one sort of temporal property that
matters; and since there are objective constraints on it, any
isomorphism between order and representation must be singu-
lar. The apparent counterargument is that since representation
of order is not singular isomorphism should play no role in
conscious experience.
However, there are at least two types of task in these experi-
ments, event identification and temporal location. They are
analogous to object identification and spatial location. These
tasks are not reducible to one another. Events like tappings and
light flashes have duration and thus temporal identities and they
belong to an ordered set. But the duration of an event need not
be established by fixing exactly a sequence of other events, nor
do gross before-and-after relations require precise event identi-
ties. This makes possible a variety of temporal "perspectives."
Faced with this, the brain can be seen as a strategy user whose
strategy requires attaching authority to its own favored interpre-
tations; a provisional stipulation of authority for the guidance of
behavior.
In that case, the brain might authorize interpretations via
isomorphism, if their authority is somehow secured thereby.
There is at least one mechanism that could account for this
tendency: The brain may be vulnerable to encoding effects.
Specific differences in ability can derive from the way informa-
tion is processed during learning. For example, word recogni-
tion is enhanced for action verbs if the action is mimed, for
nouns if the denoted object is observed (Englekamp 1988). The
effects are item-specific. And the differences do not require
overt behavior or actual observation; internal simulations can
produce them as well.
In some cases, then, the items might be events and move-
ment sequences. Learning is not obviously involved here; but
something like encoding effects could occur during the selective
evolution of neural capacities. Of course, nature could econo-
mize with an amodal system. But nature tempers frugality with
provision for individual difference, a known aid to evolution.
Mode-specific encoding effects might result merely from the
use of precise configurations as opposed to gross generic ones,
all with a common interpretive "vocabulary." It isn't clear,
however, why we should think that is the case, except to
preserve amodalism in away that begs the question. Moreover,
this seems to miss the spirit of nature's interest in real diversity.
If the motor encoding of actions translates into different sorts
of neural representings compared to the sensory encoding of
perceived objects, then the experience of temporal order in
movement sequences can translate into forms of representing
different from those of seeing events. As D & K suggest in one
analogy, the inconsistency of a loud request for quiet may be

effective by calling attention to the authority and power of the
speaker. But an exaggerated whisper can amplify the force of the
same content, too. The need for complementary isomorphism is
not for the sake of representing per se; it is for an effective
strategy with limited means. In any case, isomorphism need not
work alone or have the final say. Given our repertoire of
resources, it may be part of nature's best effort so far, a
compromise solution.

What is it for a mental representation to be conscious? It is a
familiar Cartesian doctrine that being conscious is part of what it
is for a state or a representation to be mental. Since being
conscious is part of being mental, not only are all mental states
conscious; being conscious must be an intrinsic property of
mental states. A state's being intrinsically conscious captures
the idea that, as Descartes put it, we are immediately conscious
of all mental states; nothing mediates between a mental state
and our being conscious of it.
Given these Cartesian assumptions, there is no room for the
brain (or mind) to reinterpret or revise the way I am conscious of
my mental states, since my being conscious of them is intrinsic
to the states themselves. Once a mental state exists, its very
nature fixes what my being conscious of that state can tell me
about it. Because being conscious of mental states is immediate
and is intrinsic to the states, what it tells us about our mental
states is not only the final draft on that subject, but the only
draft.
All this has consequences for subjective temporal succession.
Suppose I first see event a and then event b. If being conscious is
intrinsic to every mental state, both cases of seeing will, at the
exact moment they occur, be conscious states; simultaneously
with seeing each event I will be conscious that I do. I will be
conscious of seeing a, and then conscious of seeing b.
Consciously perceiving temporal succession between a and b
is part of the way my seeing a and seeing b are conscious
perceptions. So if being conscious is intrinsic to those percep-
tions, there's no room for the mind (or brain) to adjust how I
consciously perceive that temporal succession. Put another
way, if a state is intrinsically conscious, then the state represents
its own occurrence; so there can be no disparity between the
timing of a state and that timing as the state represents it. There
will be no alternative, then, to my seeing a as having occurred
before b. Mellor (cited in D & K sect. 2.1, para. II) will be right
that we perceive the subjective temporal succession of two
events simply by way of the objective temporal succession of our
representations of those events.l
If mental states were all conscious, being conscious might
well be an intrinsic property of those states. But it's widely
recognized that many mental states are not conscious. That they
are not would be hard to explain if being conscious were an
intrinsic property of mental states. So we must reject the idea
that being conscious is an intrinsic property of mental states.2
The one thing that's uncontroversial about a mental state's
being conscious is that it involves one's being conscious of that
state in some way or other. Let us call our being conscious of our
conscious states in the relevant way transitive consciousness,
since it's a case of being conscious of something. If being
conscious is an extrinsic property of mental states, our being
transitively conscious of those states will also be extrinsic to
them. A mental state will be distinct from our being transitively
conscious of it.
The idea that mental states are distinct from our transitive
consciousness of them fits well with D & K's Multiple Drafts
model. When we are conscious of something, we are conscious
of it under certain aspects and not others; we represent the thing
we are conscious of in certain ways, and not others. So it is with
our being conscious of our mental states. Being transitively
conscious of a mental state means representing that state in a
certain way, and how we represent it will determine what sort of
state we think we're in. [See also Searle: "Consciousness,
Explanatory Inversion, and Cognitive Science" BBS 13(4)
1990.]
How we represent the things we are conscious of, moreover,
can change over time, and there is no reason why this too should
not happen with our transitive consciousness of our mental
states. Our being transitively conscious of our mental states
involves representing them in certain ways. These representa-
tions can change, and as they do, corresponding changes will
occur in what mental states we seem to be in. In effect, we'll
have a series of drafts about the contents of our minds. Since
how transitive consciousness represents our mental states is
distinct from those states, these changes need involve no shift in
the nature of the mental states themselves; all that has to change
is the character that our transitive consciousness of those states
represents them as having. Moreover, we will not consciously
notice these changes, since it is only in virtue of how our
transitive consciousness of our mental states represents them
that we are conscious of those states at all. The latest draft will
seem, for the purposes of consciousness, to be the only draft.
Things would be different if our transitive consciousness of
our mental states were intrinsic to those states. How we are
transitively conscious of them would then be part of their
nature. Our transitive consciousness would occur simultane-
ously with the state, and the way our transitive consciousness
represents the state could not change without a change in the
very nature of the state itself. But apart from discredited
doctrines about having infallible or exhaustive access to our
mental states, we have no reason to think that our transitive
consciousness of our mental states is intrinsic to them.
Let us turn again to subjective temporal succession. Con-
sciously perceiving a temporal succession between a and b
involves representing my perception of temporal succession in a
particular way. Since my transitive consciousness of that per-
ception is extrinsic to it, nothing about my perceptions of a and b
fixes the way I represent my perception of their temporal
relations. In particular, the objective temporal succession of my
perceptions of a and b cannot fix how my transitive conscious-
ness of my perception represents that perception of temporal
succession.
Moreover, the way my transitive consciousness represents
that perception can change over time.3 The way my transitive
consciousness of my perceptions represents them determines
what perceptions I seem to have; so the latest transitive con-
sciousness will seem to be the only one I've ever had. This is so
even when I am perceiving temporal succession. So if the way I
represent my perception of temporal succession changes, it will
seem that that is the only way I ever perceived things. This is
just what is needed to explain the cutaneous rabbit and the phi
phenomenon.
According to the foregoing model, one's transitive conscious-
ness of one's mental states is distinct from those states and can
change independently of them. And it is this transitive con-
sciousness of one's mental states that determines what one takes
those states to be. Is this model Stalinesque or Orwellian?
For the Stalinesque theorist, perceiving something fixes my
memories, but I can edit my perceptions; for the Orwellian, I
can eradicate the effect of my initial perception by rewriting my
memories. If by "perception" we mean conscious perception,
the model I have put forth may look Stalinesque. A conscious
perception is a perception plus the transitive consciousness of it;
so the brain can edit my conscious perception by altering how
220
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

Commentary/Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
my transitive consciousness represents the perception. But
given the latest version of my transitive consciousness, my
conscious perception may well fix subsequent memories.
We might instead mean by "perception" just the non-
conscious perceptual state, apart from any transitive conscious-
ness of it. The foregoing model may then seem Orwellian.
Without transitive consciousness, perceptions don't by them-
selves determine subsequent memories, since memories will
follow the way my transitive consciousness of my perceptions
represents them. The model I have proposed gives us no reason
to think we can edit these nonconscious perceptual states. But if
we can edit our transitive consciousness of our perceptions,
surely we can alter our memories of them.
The deeper issue, however, is whether whatever revising
does take place should count as an alteration of memories or of
initial perceptions. Here the foregoing model resists easy classi-
fication. The brain edits our conscious perceptions by changing
the way our transitive consciousness of those perceptions repre-
sents them. This can happen earlier or later. The Stalinesque
theorist thinks we edit our perceptions, while the Orwellian
maintains that we rewrite our memories. So the brain's revising
of our transitive consciousness of our perceptions will seem
more Stalinesque the earlier it happens, and more Orwellian
the later it happens. The line between Stalinesque and Or-
wellian is, as D & K insist, arbitrary. Since the revising of our
transitive consciousness can happen earlier or later, at small
time scales we won't be able to draw a principled line between
what's "not yet observed" and what's "already observed."
If being conscious were intrinsic to mental states, it would be
natural to fix the time each mental state occurs by the time at
which it becomes conscious. Can we do that with those mental
states that are conscious, even though being conscious is not an
intrinsic property of them? We could not reliably fix compara-
tive timing this way, since there is no single place in the brain at
which the transitive consciousness of every mental state occurs.
Still, we might be able to draw a nonarbitrary distinction
between rewriting memories and editing conscious per-
ceptions.
This move is unavailable. Our transitive consciousness of a
perception can be revised; so which transitive consciousness
should count for purposes of timing? Is it the first, which fixes
when the perception initially become conscious? Or the last,
after which no more changes occur in the way our transitive
consciousness of the perception represents it? Or should we
pick the time, possibly in between first and last, at which the
way our transitive consciousness represents the perception
becomes relatively stable? Since there is no principled answer
to these questions, we cannot time mental states by reference to
the time of their being conscious.
Finally, are Dennett and Kinsbourne right that there is no
"fact of the matter about exactly when (in 'absolute' time . . .) a
conscious experience happens" (sect. 3.1, para. 12)? That de-
pends on what we mean. We have no reason to doubt that we
can fix the time of whatever mental state we're conscious of,
independently of our transitive consciousness of it. But the
brain can revise the way our transitive consciousness of any
experience represents that experience, and each successive
transitive consciousness is subjectively no less authoritative
than the preceding ones. So if by "conscious experience" we
mean the experience plus our transitive consciousness of it,
there is indeed no fact of the matter about its timing.

One gets the impression that Dennett and Kinsbourne (D & K)
are busily nailing the last few tacks into a big Out of Business
sign stretched across the Cartesian Theater. However, upon
closer inspection the sign discloses a far less definitive message:
Closed for Remodeling â€” Reopening Soon as Cinema 1-2-Many
of the Mind.
The stated goal of D & K's target article is to expose and
dismantle the Cartesian Theater. Although we agree with much
of their diagnosis, in particular their central conclusion that the
neural events subserving conscious experience are spatially and
temporally distributed and that there is no single "where" and
no single "when" to look for them in the brain, we have serious
reservations about the Multiple Drafts model proposed as an
alternative. The Multiple Drafts model not only fails to close the
Cartesian Theater as D & K intend, it retains and multiplies
some of the deficiencies of that model by replicating the major
mysteries of conscious experience across an indefinite number
of ill-characterized Multiple Drafts. In effect, D & K are
replacing the single Cartesian stage with a multi-screen Cinema
1-2-Many of the Mind.
The major virtues of the Multiple Drafts model are what it
says about what conscious experience is not: (a) that there is no
single where and when of conscious experience in the brain and
(b) the temporal properties of conscious experience need not
correspond with the temporal properties of the neural events
that mediate conscious experience. However, when it comes to
proposing what conscious experience is, the Multiple Drafts
model is decidedly silent about a number of key issues:
1. Why do some neural processes constitute "drafts" having
content that can contribute to conscious experience while others
do not?
2. How do the various layers of D & K's mental palimpsest
interact, compete, and gain primacy to produce the sense of a
(quasi-) coherent series of perceptions, intentions, and actions
that characterize our interaction with the world?
3. What constitutes "editorial revision" and who/what does
the revising?
4. How is the metaphor of a "draft" an improvement over the
metaphor of a theater in dispelling the "infinite regress of too-
powerful homunculi"?
D & K are, of course, not alone in having a less than
satisfactory account of conscious experience and its relationship
to the brain. The chasm between the subjective and the objec-
tive has stumped thinkers since Descartes and we confess to
finding ourselves in exactly the same muddle. So what are
would-be theater-goers to do for entertainment in the faced of D
& K's "Out of Business" sign? Are we to concede that the "where
and when of consciousness in the brain" are totally outside the
bounds of science-as-usual? Not quite, for there are directions to
proceed in which considerable progress, albeit somewhat indi-
rect, can be made.
One promising direction to proceed is down. Although inves-
tigations of the brain do not address the subjective-objective
relationship head-on, any attempt to characterize this relation-
ship will benefit from a more thorough understanding of either
the subjective or objective component taken separately. Neu-
roscience has only begun to scratch the surface of the deep
mysteries of the brain and we are convinced that science-as-
usual will reveal that many puzzling phenomena, including
some of the temporal paradoxes that D & K view as particularly
problematic, are understandable consequences of neural struc-
ture and function. Just as visual spatial illusions have been
treated as discrepancies between the subjective and objective

that can be informative about the properties of the visual
system, we believe that D & K's "temporal anomalies" should be
viewed as illusions in the temporal domain that can be informa-
tive about the normal operation of the system (cf. Churchland
1981a), not as reasons to invoke a model like Multiple Drafts
which only exacerbates the muddle. In the remainder of this
commentary we outline three examples of phenomena at the
level of neuroscience that may help shed light on the "para-
doxes" investigated by D & K. Although these examples do not
address the subjective-objective relationship directly, they can
provide significant constraints on the nature of that rela-
tionship. 1
Color-filling. The eye has a natural jitter that causes the visual
field to "dance in place" on the retina. When images are
artificially stabilized on the retina, imaged contours appear to
fade and colors spread to fill spaces delineated by unstabilized
boundaries. This phenomenon is called color-filling. The ob-
server perceives colors that are not present in the corresponding
location in the retinal image and fails to perceive colors that are
retinally represented. Somewhere between the level of the
retina and what is accessible to conscious experience a signifi-
cant change occurs in the neural representation of color informa-
tion. In their analysis of Orwellian versus Stalinesque "revi-
sion," D & K argue that the nature of the "revision" is forever
inaccessible: We (either as observers or scientists) can never
know whether the brain really "fills in" the perceived color, or
whether it sends an executive signal indicating "color filled." To
the extent that this question is posed relative to the assumption
of a single time and place in the brain subserving conscious
experience, we agree with D & K that it is unresolvable. But if
we broaden the question to "Where and when in the brain does
the representational change occur?" then there is constructive
work to be done. Neuroscientific evidence suggests that the
visual system actually constructs the filled-in information by the
time visual cortex is reached (Piantanida 1985; Piantanida &
Larimer 1989). Neurons in visual cortex whose receptive fields
coincide with the location of the filled-in but not-actually-
present-at-the-retina color demonstrate the same adaptation
effects as neurons that actually see that color. Thus, the illusory
color information is constructed and present in visual cortex as
color information of the usual sort. Color-filling therefore pro-
vides an example of an identifiable modification of informational
content that provides a candidate explanation for observers'
reported subjective experience. One cannot, of course, con-
clude that these particular neuronal effects are the only basis or
the most important one for the subjective experience of color-
filling. As D & K emphasize, the neuronal events that con-
tribute to the subjective effects may be distributed widely in
multiple regions of the brain. Like many methods in neuro-
science, single-cell recording techniques suffer from significant
sampling limitations and the reported single-cell "color-filling"
effects could be merely distant and indirect manifestations of the
mechanisms that subserve the subjective effects. Nevertheless,
what we do know from these results is that the brain has the
capacity to generate color-filling at the neuronal level in visual
cortex and this knowledge can place useful constraints on
theories of color perception.
Apparent motion. Although we find it natural to think of cells
as having spatial receptive fields, the notion of temporal recep-
tive fields in vision is more rarely discussed. However, just as
neurons have morphological properties that enable them to
code for and respond to particular spatial patterns, their rich
array of dynamical properties such as membrane capacitance
and channel kinetics make them well-suited for computations in
the time domain as well. Neurons in visual areas VI and MT
respond both to real movement (i.e., stimuli moving con-
tinuously across a neuron's receptive field) and apparent move-
ment (i.e., stroboscopic presentation of stationary stimuli).
Moreover, their responses vary systematically with spatial and
temporal parameters of the stimuli that closely parallel the
psychophysically defined limits of apparent motion in human
observers (Newsome et al. 1986). Again, one should not overin-
terpret these results, either with respect to their necessary
contribution to subjective effects or their representativeness of
neuronal mechanisms of real or apparent motion in general (cf.
Hildreth & Koch 1987). Nevertheless, these single cell results,
together with knowledge of the temporal properties of neurons,
can lead to interesting and testable hypotheses. For example,
the perception of apparent motion might begin with an initially
nondirectional priming from the first flashed stimulus. If an-
other stimulus with similar characteristics should appear within
the primed region before the activation has decayed, a motion
signal might be generated, either by potentiating the interven-
ing circuit or by sending a signal that is interpreted by other
areas as coding motion. As D & K point out, color phi is a special
case of apparent motion, and a mechanism similar to the one
operative in color-filling may serve to create a spread of color
information which parallels the spatial interpolation.
Simultaneous manipulation of neuronal and subjective effects.
D & K are acutely aware of the difficulties attending attempts to
link brain activity and conscious experience, but their treatment
obscures the important point that, objectively speaking, there is
a fact of the matter about brain states and processes, not
multiple, indistinguishable versions of facts. In the color-filling
and apparent motion examples discussed above, the experimen-
tal strategy is to attempt to find cells or cell populations that bear
relationships to stimulus manipulations similar to those re-
ported by human observers in psychophysical experiments. As
we have noted, such correspondences can provide candidate
explanations from which one can begin to form hypotheses
about neural substrates of a given subjective effect. However,
one can go further and test such hypotheses by experimentally
manipulating the neuronal populations in question using stim-
ulation, lesion, pharmacological, or other techniques. For ex-
ample, in the motion domain, Newsome and colleagues (Salz-
man et al. 1990) have recently demonstrated that a monkey's
behavioral responses in a motion judgment task can be influ-
enced by local microstimulation in area MT, the cortical region
in which neurons appear to be especially sensitive to real and
apparent motion. We emphasize that the results of such manip-
ulation experiments do not necessarily indicate that area MT is
the or even a system that subserves subjective experience of
motion. Nevertheless, by systematically applying this experi-
mental strategy across a variety of visual areas it may be possible
to assemble a catalogue of regions that do and do not appear
capable of biasing subjective experience (as inferred from be-
havioral report) according to the experimental manipulation
employed.
In summary, although we readily acknowledge that neuro-
science is unlikely to provide a bridge across the subjective-
objective chasm in any direct sense, we believe that it can
provide a much richer body of data from which to formulate
bridging hypotheses than the sterile, no-fact-of-the-matter posi-
tion advocated by the Multiple Drafts model. Data and theories
from neuroscience can place significant constraints on what the
subjective-objective relationship might be and perhaps allow us
to address several important questions sorely lacking treatment
in the Multiple Drafts account:
1. Which neural processes (where and when) appear to
covary with subjective report and which do not?
2. Which regions and processes can we manipulate to bias
subjective report and which not?
3. What characteristics of these processes distinguish them
from processes that cannot be biased in this manner (i.e., what
counts as a "draft")?
We agree wholeheartedly with D & K that the Cartesian
Theater is doomed to fail. But after remodeling by the Dennett
& Kinsbourne Co., what we have instead is hardly more radical
222

than a series of minitheaters. In short, after (rightly) discarding
the assumption that there is a single where and when of
conscious experience in the brain, the Multiple Drafts model
seems to incur the most serious remaining problems of the
Cartesian Theater, as well as new ones of its own. Moderniza-
tion of old standbys will not result in the conceptual break-
throughs necessary to understand consciousness and its relation
to the brain. What is really lacking are new forms of entertain-
ment that genuinely dispel, not just obscure, the insidious
Cartesian homunculus. In the Multiple Drafts model he can be
found sitting in any or all of the minitheaters, this time clothed
in the dapper attire of the Editor(s) of the Drafts.
NOTE
1. Neuroscience also provides abundant evidence in support of D &
K's point that "we must distinguish features of representings from the
features of representeds" in the brain's representation of temporal
information. For example: (a) the frequency of an acoustic stimulus
appears to be represented in the nervous system both as spatial and
temporal codes (e.g., Javel et al. 1988); (b) interaural time (phase)
differences that convey information about sound localization appear to
be computed by temporal comparisons at one level of the owl's auditory
system and represented as a spatial map at a subsequent level (Konishi
et al. 1988); and (c) complex acoustic features mediating biosonar,
including Doppler sensitivity, appear to be organized into spatial maps
in the mustached bat's auditory cortex (Suga 1988).
Mental representation: Always delayed but
not always ephemeral

There Is much that Is right about Dennett & Kinsbourne's (D &
K's) likening of mental representation to unending revision of
"multiple drafts" concerning what Is going on in the external
world. After noting two points that are In particular agreement
with ones I have previously advocated, I must, however, draw
attention to two points of divergence.
Representation of physical properties wersus physical proper-
ties of representation. Certainly, I agree (with the target article,
sect. 2.1) that the representation of timing is not the same thing
as the timing of representation and that the experience of (A
before B) does not entail (the experience of A) before (the
experience ofB). In statements about mental events generally,
terms may not be commutative or distributive. As Kubovy
(1983) succinctly observed in reviewing work that my associates
and I had reported on mental rotation (Shepard & Cooper 1982),
to imagine (a rotation of (an object)) is not necessarily to rotate
(an image of (an object)). The second statement in each of these
three italicized pair entails the problematic attribution of physi-
cal relations (spatial orientations or temporal orders) to non-
physical objects (mental images or subjective events). In con-
trast, the first statement in each pair focuses on the
representation of the physical properties of physical objects and,
in so doing, provides both for the objective study of mental
representations in the psychological laboratory (Shepard 1990)
and for the natural selection of representational systems in the
physical world (Shepard 1987).
The distributed nature of the physical processes underlying
representation. Also in agreement with D & K, I once charac-
terized the brain as "a community of pretuned monads that
come into harmonious action, with each other and with the
world outside, through many glasses darkly" (Shepard 1984, p.
438-439). Implicitly equating "darkly" with "slowly," I further
noted that "the necessarily finite velocity of signal propagation
within a body must limits its processing of information"
(Shepard, 1984, pp. 426-27). Indeed, I have regarded this
processing limitation as the source of the fundamental law of
apparent motion (Korte's third law) according to which apparent
motion requires slower rates of alternation for more widely
separated stimuli (Shepard 1981; 1984; 1989).
The representational system, despite Its inherent time de-
lays, has been evolutionarily shaped to represent biologically
significant events In the external world. As D & K observe,
instructions to report the temporal order of the internal repre-
sentational events themselves call, in contrast, for "judgment of
temporality of a sort that does not normally play a role In
behavior control" (target article, sect. 3.2). Not surprisingly,
subjects' attempts to comply with such instructions can yield
anomalous results when the temporal intervals between the
relevant neurophysiological events are less than the propagation
and relaxation times of the neuronal system as a whole.
The sometimes perceptually concrete character of retrospec-
tiwe representations. I do question, however, D & K's insistence
that "drafts" concerning external events are always like abstract
descriptions of "narratives" (target article, sect. 1.1); that "the
brain doesn't actually have to go to the trouble of 'filling in'
anything," perceptually; and that to do so "would be a waste of
time and (shall we say?) paint" (target article, sect. 2.2). My
coworkers and I have demonstrated that processes of mental
rotation (Cooper 1976; Cooper & Shepard 1973) and apparent
motion (Robins & Shepard 1977) are analog processes in the
sense that they successively activate (or "fill in") intermediate
states corresponding, in concrete detail, to what would be
successive intermediate states in the external world (see
Shepard & Cooper 1982).
In the experiment by Robins and Shepard (1977), for exam-
ple, apparent motion was ambiguously induced by alternately
displaying a vertical and a horizontal bar. Subjects reported
seeing a single bar rotating 90Â° back aa.d forth either through the
upper right and lower left quadrants or, instead, through the
upper left and lower right quadrants. Was the difference be-
tween these two distinct perceptions of the same external
stimulus merely a difference in after-the-fact description? Pur-
suing this question, we^ briefly flashed a small probe dot at a
randomly selected time and location along the circular path of
experienced motion and asked subjects to indicate whether the
dot flashed before or after the bar appeared to pass through the
location of the dot. For dots that were presented in a quadrant
through which motion was experienced, dots further along the
path of that motion could be flashed after longer delays and still
elicit the response "before" - just as if a bar had actually moved
through that quadrant.
Even more direct, neurophysiological evidence for the analog
nature of a type of mental rotation (cf. Shepard & Metzler 1971)
has subsequently been reported by Georgopoulos et al. (1989).
They found that the cortical firing patterns recorded from
monkeys who were preparing for a rotational movement passed
through patterns corresponding to intermediate orientations. If
the brain does sometimes "go to the trouble" of such a concrete
"filling in," there must be some adaptive value in representing
significant external events in the most accurate, complete,
perceptual and, as I shall now argue, memorable form.
Mdaptiwe functions of enduring retrospectiwe representations.
Here, I question D & K's supposition that each "draft," reflect-
ing "the situation at the time it is generated," is no more "correct
than another" and, by implication, is never destined to attain a
more enduring (metaphorically, "published") form (sect. 1.1).
True, our evolutionary fitness depends on our ability to respond
to challenging events before our representational system has
had time to relax into a final Interpretive state. Typically,
however, events are followed by more quiescent interludes
during which the evolutionarily shaped Interpretational process
may run its course. The resulting more stable representation,

ceding events (Libet 1985b; Libet et al. 1979), may be more
veridical and, hence, more worthy of preservation for the
guidance of future behavior.
Certainly, natural selection must have favored accuracy in
learning, memory, and generalization as well as in perception.
For example, experienced motion, though illusory in the con-
trived situation of apparent motion, nevertheless represents the
external event that is both most consistent with the retinal
stimulation and most probable in a world in which material
objects are conserved (Shepard 1984). Normally, the represen-
tation of such a motion yields not only a more veridical percept
but also a more useful memory. In short, retrospective "drafts"
that achieve a sufficient degree of concrete consolidation, an-
swering the call of consciousness to "publish," may not soon
"perish."

Sn defense off the pineal gland

The straw man stands near the top of the list of useful strategies
for the introduction of new ideas. Whatever the objective merits
of a new theory, it can be made to seem even more compelling
by contrasting it with an alternative so flawed, or even openly
ludicrous, that the reader must either endorse the author's
proposal or support the patently absurd. I write this comment
not to find fault with the Multiple Drafts (MD) model (which I in
fact believe to be ingenious and useful) but to suggest that
Dennett & Kinsbourne (D & K) might have been more charita-
ble in their treatment of Descartes, and to argue that there is
some evidence to support a modern version of his basic idea, a
sort of conceptual pineal gland.
Of course Descartes has been scolded for his metaphysics for
centuries and D & K have nothing new to add here. But in this
context the objection to a distinct res cogitans is gratuitous.
Whether discriminations are distributed and multiple, as in the
MD model, or central and single, as in the Cartesian Theater,
the option of positing an immaterial agency to process that
discrimination still exists. The decision against exercising that
option seems more a matter of metaphysical prudence than of
some intrinsic merit in the model. I don't see anything in the
MD model precluding the assumption of a million small homun-
culi, each responding to peripherally located discriminations.
Descartes might argue that, in closing his Theater, D & K have,
without admitting it, reserved the right to operate in the same
building a large number of rehearsal rooms where assistant
directors examine the talent and revise the material, com-
municating with one another by e-mail. More complicated? Yes.
Metaphysically superior? I doubt it.
The nub of the issue has not so much to do with metaphysics as
it does with the question of whether there are places in the brain
that receive inputs from various sources and perform some
coordinating transformation of that data. I think the important
contribution made by Descartes is the recognition that at some
level there must be mechanisms that serve such coordinating
functions. Had he had the opportunity to know modem neu-
roanatomy, we may suppose that Descartes would have insisted
on neither a single mechanism nor a single location for the
collation and processing of incoming data. But whether the
Theater is large or small, and whether there is one such locus or
many, we need to know first whether there are any coordinating
operations performed on inputs from diverse sources and, if the
answer is yes, what the nature of these transformations is and
what subsequent use is made of the results.
One line of evidence has been developed from the study of
perceived magnitude, the line of research begun in the 1950's
by the Harvard psychologist S. S. Stevens (1975), who asked
observers to attend to simple signals varying only in intensity,
and to make judgments of their perceived magnitudes. Whether
the signals were pure tones of a given frequency varying only in
amplitude, discs of white light varying only in luminosity, or
weights varying only in mass (to give but a few examples), and
whether observers made their judgments by assigning numeri-
cal values or by adjusting the intensity of some other stimulus
dimension, the result was consistently found to be a power
function relating the observer's judgments to the intensities of
the stimuli presented. Of equal importance was the discovery
by Stevens that each perceptual continuum (loudness, bright-
ness, heaviness, and the like) has a characteristic exponent for
the power function, taking values in the range from about 0.3 to
about 3.
In various reports (Teghtsoonian 1971; 1974) I have noted that
low exponents are typical for continua with large dynamic
ranges, while high exponents characterize continua with short
dynamic ranges, and that there is reason to believe that at some
level these varying dynamic ranges are, through processes of
compression or expansion as needed, mapped into a single scale
of subjective magnitudes. Indeed, it is as if intensity information
from all inputs is routed to a single monitor whose output
defines the experience of subjective magnitude (how loud a
sound seems to a listener and how bright a source of light
appears to be), and it is the maximum range of outputs of this
device that makes the brightest light subjectively equivalent to
the loudest sound. It is the apparent subjective equality of the
many different dynamic ranges that suggests the likelihood of a
central monitor whose properties define the limits of perceived
magnitude. (Another, more empirical way of stating the argu-
ment is that there is no value on any given continuum that
cannot be subjectively matched by some value within the
dynamic range for any other perceptual continuum. During the
several years since this rule of complete and exhaustive inter-
rnappability was first proposed, there has been [to my knowl-
edge] no discontinuing evidence.) If the idea of a central
monitor for intensity information proves to be valid, it could
qualify as a kind of Cartesian minitheater, and, could be placed
in the pineal gland, the big toe, or anywhere else that may be
implicated by neuroanatomical research.
I might add one further line of argument in favor of such a
monitoring device, although this one has been the subject of
criticism and claims of discontinuing evidence. In earlier pub-
lications I have noted that the several perceptual continua are
distinguished not only by characteristic power law exponents,
but also by marked differences in resolving power. Despite the
inaccuracies embodied in the traditional version of Weber's
Law, it is possible to specify an approximate percentage change
in intensity below which no change is noticed, and this value,
like the exponent of the power law, depends on the perceptual
continuum being tested. Thus, human observers may be aware
of relative changes in the intensity of electric shock delivered to
the fingertips that would be quite undetected if expressed as
changes in sound intensity. I have noted (in the sources cited
above) that resolving power appears to be inversely related to
dynamic range, with differential sensitivity being greatest for
continua with the shortest dynamic range. And if differential
sensitivity is ultimately defined by the resolving power of the
central intensity monitor described above, and if just-noticeably
changed stimulus ratios are subjectively equivalent across all
perceptual continua, the inverse relation between DR and
resolving power would be seen as further evidence for the
existence of a single monitoring device for intensity.
Presumably similar monitoring systems exist for other at-

tributes, and the ways in which the outputs of these devices are
assembled remain a matter of speculation. Indeed, as Dennett
& Kinsbourne themselves observe, it is essential "to learn
exactly when and where various informational streams con-
verge." The hard empirical work will continue to focus on
attempts to discover how each variety of information is pro-
cessed, and the ways in which the results of that processing are
assembled and combined. It seems quite plausible to me that, in
pursuit of that goal, some variety of Cartesian mini-theaters may
be needed.

We are born naive realists, believing that we see the world as we
do because that is how it is. But sooner or later we have
experiences which may lead us to distinguish between the real
world that physicists' descriptions refer to and a realm of
phenomenological experience. We learn that sticks that "look
bent" in water are not bent in the physicist's space. To a major
extent, it is to the phenomenological aspect of perception that
terms such as "conscious awareness" refer. The distinction
between phenomenological experience (the content of "con-
scious awareness") and the world inferred by the sciences has a
strong intuitive force, although it is understood in different ways
by different people.
What is the relation between these two realms of description?
Physical instruments could measure the mass, reflectance, and
location of the word-processor before me and thus confirm its
presence. In practice I am satisfied to note its beige space-filling
bulk, red label, and low-pitched murmur. I have also been
persuaded that intermediate between these two realms of de-
scription, and necessary for their concurrence, lies a special part
of the physical world, a network of active neural mechanisms
constantly engaged in processing the information coming in
from the sense organs. The observer who has graduated from
naive realism and discovered the role of neural mechanisms may
ask: What is the relation between the elements of phenomeno-
logical experience and the corresponding neural events? We
must admit that the best answer currently on offer is that this
relation - let us call it Relationu - is undefined and that there is
nothing that we know about it with certainty. If we suppose that
this relation is a reliable correlation between two realms, we
have dualism. If Relationu represents causal interchanges in
both directions this may be recognized as interactionist dualism.
If we define Relationu as "is an aspect of" (whatever "aspect" may
mean) or "is a property of," or "is identical to," we have
materialism. Dennett & Kinsbourne's (D & K's) target article
attempts to assess what implications certain observations on
subjective timing may have for our understanding of Relationu.
D & K's target article stresses important points which we do
well to be reminded of. The time represented by an element of
phenomenological experience is not the time at which that
element is generated - as the naive realist with respect to time
would suppose â€” but the time to which it refers, just as beige is
not the color of a conscious sensation but of my word-processor.
(I leave aside problems about "representation" and "referring.")
We do not need a central observer to reperceive the products of
perception.
D & K's main arguments relate to four experimental results
which have been supposed to raise problems in relation to the
timing of conscious experiences or timing in conscious experi-
ence. They involve apparently paradoxical relations between
subjective timing and physical events.
Timing is an old topic in psychology. Before discussing D &
K's treatment of these results, it will be useful to remind
ourselves of some relevant earlier observations. James (1890)
recorded that it had long been noticed when "expectant atten-
tion" was concentrated on one of two sensations, the subjective
experience of the other might be delayed. "Thus, to use the
stock example of the books, the surgeon would sometimes see
the blood flow from the arm of the patient . . . before he saw the
instrument penetrate the skin. . . . There is thus a certain
difficulty in perceiving the exact date of two impressions when
they do not interest our attention equally (p. 409). This effect
was extensively investigated by psychologists as the phenome-
non of "prior entry." If a subject watched a pointer move over a
dial and at some time in its traverse a click occurred, or if a click
and a brief tactual stimulus were both given with the interval
between them varying, and in each case the subject was re-
quired to direct his attention to one stimulus of the two, then
that attended stimulus would be judged to occur earlier in time
relative to the other than the physical difference in their times of
presentation warranted (Boring 1950; James 1890; Stone 1926).
The minimal moral to be drawn from such observations is that
the neural mechanisms that assign times of occurrence to
external events are labile and can be affected by instructions and
other factors. This should surprise only naive mechanists who
imagine that the nervous system functions like a mechanical
system of fixed characteristics which must always give the same
output for the same stimulus input, mediating a simple immedi-
ate translation of stimulus impact into neural event and neural
event into experiential element; but it should not surprise
psychologists who accept that the nervous system has computa-
tional abilities and processes information.
Gestalt psychology conveyed a similar message. One dot on
a page carries no implication of an extended pattern, but three
placed at random define a triangle, or a straight line: A con-
figuration emerges that was not previously present as its com-
ponents, again confounding simple mechanists. Gestalten were
not only spatial but also temporal. If one briefly exposed point
is followed after a suitable short interval by a second point at
a suitable distance, we see only a single point that moves
smoothly between the two locations (Ternus 1926/1938). This
is a temporal gestalt. What it shows is that the neural computa-
tion of movement can take account of patterning of input over a
short period of time, and give a correspondingly complex
output.
Evidently such a computation cannot conclude before the
second point has been received. For how long a period can the
conclusion of a neural computation be delayed? Light is thrown
on this question by an experiment of Treisman and Howarth
(1959). Earlier work had shown that if the threshold for detec-
tion of a faint stimulus (the critical, to-be-detected stimulus) is
measured, this threshold is lowered if a preceding accessory or
"warning" stimulus is given that conveys information about the
time at which the critical stimulus will subsequently be pre-
sented. This threshold lowering may be seen even when the
critical stimulus is delayed four seconds or more after the
accessory stimulus (Treisman 1946). Treisman and Howarth
(1959) extended this paradigm to examine the effect of an
accessory stimulus that came at a fixed interval after the presen-
tation of the critical stimulus. Figure 1 shows the results of one
such experiment. Here the subject listened to a constant 500 Hz
tone presented over earphones at 60-70 dB SL. The stimulus to
be detected was a 50 msec increment in the intensity of the tone.
A prewarning (the onset of a neon light which came on and
stayed on) initiated the trial. After a randomly chosen interval of
2-7 seconds, a near-threshold intensity increment was pre-
sented. In the warning conditions, this was followed after a fixed
interval known to the subject (3, 1, 0.5, or 0 seconds) by

presentation of the accessory stimulus, the onset of a second
neon light which stayed on until the subject responded.
The data show that the threshold for detecting the intensity
increment is lowered when the onset of the accessory stimulus
occurs at the same time as the increment is given, or even when
the accessory stimulus follows the critical stimulus by as much as
one second. This effect was not accompanied by any increase in
variance or in false positive rate (Treisman & Howarth 1959).
This demonstrates that the neural sensory mechanisms can store
sensory input information for a period of up to one second, and
can use subsequent contextual information received during that
delay to revise the criterion that is eventually applied to deter-
mine the detection decision regarding the stored sensory infor-
mation. This stored information is not "conscious," to the extent
that this is indexed by verbal report: If the subsequent warning
is not given, the subject will deny hearing any increment on a
proportion of trials on which, if the warning stimulus had been
given following the critical stimulus at the expected interval, a
positive response would have been made. Thus, not only are the
sensory neural mechanisms capable of storing and "editing"
information, but the length of this storage can be of the order of
as much as a second.
It is hardly necessary to note that many types of observations
preclude such delays being obligatory and universal. We can
safely conclude that the extent of the delay before the neural
mechanisms reach a perceptual decision on an input may vary
with the context in which the subject operates and the nature of
the task.
The experiments discussed by D & K report apparent motion
between two differently colored shapes, in which the color that
is perceived changes during the course of the motion (Kolers &
von Griinau 1976); apparent movement of mechanical or electri-
cal cutaneous pulses given successively at different positions on
the skin (Geldard & Sherrick 1972) - both of which are temporal
gestalts; and two experiments in which subjects reported "the
subjective timing order of two sensory experiences" (Libet et al.
1979; Libet 1985a; 1985b).
At the neurophysiological level, there is nothing puzzling
about these results. The Kolers and von Grunau experiment
adds nothing of theoretical significance (for the present purpose:
the mismatch between perceived timing and a naive mechanis-
tic account of its basis) to earlier reports of apparent motion:
When a point is seen moving from one position to another, the
second position must be defined by sensory input before the
neural mechanisms can determine the direction of movement.
What any observation of apparent movement or displacement
tells us is that the processing capacity of the neural mechanisms
that determine the eventual perception is sufficient to allow the
conclusion of the processing to be timed to accommodate the
physical delays embodied in the complex stimulus. This point is
also relevant to Libet's observations, although the standing of
his data is somewhat vitiated by serious methodological prob-
lems. He notes (Libet 1985a): "We tended to place the subjec-
tive experience at the times reported by the subject, these
reports being the only available directly valid indicators of such
times" (p. 564). "Validity" can only be claimed for a measure of a
variable when that measure can be compared with and shown to
agree with an accepted objective indicator of the value of the
variable we wish to measure. There is no way of doing that here:
The validity claimed is based on hopeful thinking. When the
subject must report what he believes the clock position was at
the time he believes he observed in himself a conscious inten-
tion to act, we are back with the prior entry phenomenon, with
its known susceptibility to internal and external factors. The
belief that various electrophysiological measures provide infor-
mation about the timing of conscious experiences also cannot be
validated: It depends on the interpretation of the content of
verbal reports.
Leaving these problems aside, what we have are situations
such as the subject reporting a clock position and an intention to
act and the experimenter recording a cortical potential; and the
constellation of observations and reports in such a situation can
be attributed to a corresponding constellation of neural process-
ing. Without a semantic analysis of the subjects' reports, no
metaphysical problems arise, as D & K appreciate (sect. 1.2,
para. 9).
I suggest we can take this further. Even if the semantic
content of subjects' reports is taken into account, none of the
experimental observations above will present any paradox if we
accept the following two points:
1. Neural information processing does not simply mirror the
physical input to the senses. The neural state that is the
response to a complex of stimuli is not simply the superposition
of the neural states that would be produced by the component
stimuli presented alone. The pattern of the stimuli (in space or
time, subject in each case to limits) determines the specific
complex neural response. This is not a novel point: it was made
by the gestalt psychologists and is contained in almost every
theory of neural information processing.
2. We take it that Relationu guarantees a consistent and
unvarying association between states of conscious awareness
and neurophysiological states; for example, Relationu might be
taken to be an identity or similar relation.
If these points are accepted, no paradoxes arise from the
contents of subjects' reports because the constant relation be-
tween the relevant complex neural activity and what D & K call
"the subjective sequence of the stream of consciousness" (sect.
1.2, para. 10) means that there can be no information in the
latter that is not contained in the former. All that can be
transferred from the neural computation to its conscious corre-
late is information, and the constant relation hypothesis implies
that there is no additional information in the latter, generated in
some immaterial manner. Speech cannot convey more than
information, thus the information in subjects' reports must
correspond equally well to the information manifesting in or as
"conscious experience" and to the same information computed
neurally. Thus nothing in a subject's report can be paradoxical in
the sense of implying something not possible physically, since it
can imply no more than the information content of the neural
computation giving rise to it, and (it is generally accepted that)
neural activity complies with the laws of physics.
This is not to say that experimental reports such as those

Commentary/Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
discussed above may not cause surprise, but the surprise is that
of the naive mechanist forced to acknowledge that in the
nervous system he faces something more complex than a simple
mechanism.
This explanation for these results does not accord with the
lines taken by D & K. What leads them to their different view?
Basically, it would seem, mistaking the details of poor models of
neural processing for necessary conditions on such activity.
D & K accept that paradoxes seem to arise from observations
of the perception of temporal sequence, and compare "two
models of consciousness" that they consider have a claim to
explain them. First,
According to the standard "Cartesian Theater" model, there is a
place in the brain where "it all comes together" and the discrimina-
tions in all modalities are somehow put into registration and "pre-
sented" for subjective judgment. The timing of the events in this
Theater determines subjective order, (target article, Abstract)
As an alternative to the "standard Cartesian Theater model"
(CT model) they put forward a "Multiple Drafts" (MD) model.
According to this,
All perceptual operations . . . are accomplished by multitrack
processes . . . discriminations have to be made only once . . . what
effect [a localized discrimination] has on the prevailing brain state
(and thus awareness) can change from moment to moment. . . .
Drafts of experience can be revised. . . . These content-fixations are
themselves precisely locatable in both space and time, but their
onsets do not mark the onset of awareness of their content. It is always
an open question whether any particular content thus discriminated
will eventually appear as an element in conscious experience. . . . at
any point in time there are multiple "drafts" of narrative fragments at
various stages of "editing" in various places in the brain, (sect. 1.1,
para. 10)
Unfortunately, D & K do not use a precisely defined vocabu-
lary to describe their model, and this creates ambiguities. It is
not always clear whether terms such as "content" or "discrimina-
tion" refer to neural processes or to subjective phenomena or
have an ambiguous double life'in both spheres. Attempting to
resolve these ambiguities, I take it that what the MD model
claims is
1. Afferent information from the sense organs undergoes
neural processing, which extracts information. This processing
occurs at various parts of the brain. The ongoing neural process-
ing is continuously modified by the impact of further incoming
sensory information. (Neural processing in general, and the
incorporation of additional information in such processing is
what I take the metaphors of "drafts" and "editing" to refer to.)
These assumptions are compatible with most accepted ac-
counts of the neural computation underlying continuing action
in the real world, such as the performance and control of skilled
movements. A memorable illustration of this point was given by
Lashley (195.1) in his example of the spoken sentence "Rapid
righting with his uninjured hand saved from loss the contents of
the capsized canoe": He noted that the spoken word "righting"
(which may be heard at first as "writing") receives its final
meaning 3 to 5 seconds after it is first heard.
2. "Contents," which I take to mean information extracted by
neural information processing, may or may not "appear as an
element in conscious experience."
3. The "stream of consciousness" . . . is a parallel stream of
conflicting and continuously revised contents, no one narrative
thread of which [is] the true version of conscious experience"
(sect. 1.1, para. 11).
What basis do these views rest on? D & K reject "Descartes'
interactionistic dualism, with its systematically inexplicable
traffic" between two realms, and note that "materialism . . . is
now a received opinion approaching unanimity" (sect. 1.1, para.
8). But it seems to be a materialism that allows "many commen-
tators" to feel "That one's consciousness might lag behind the
brain processes . . . seems . . . unsettling . . . ruling out a real
"executive role" for "the conscious self" (sect. 1.2, para. 8); and
that is compatible with "the prima facie plausible thesis that our
conscious perceptions are caused by events in our nervous
systems, and our conscious acts, in turn, cause events in our
nervous systems that control our bodily acts" (sect. 1.2, para.
12).
But a more concrete vision moves them, a vision of the brain,
extended in space, continuing through time, in which "repre-
sentations" of various stimuli follow their erratic courses (like
the Wandering Rocks in the Odyssey) perhaps eventually
provoking action. How in this fuzzy context can order of arrival
be determined? D & K see it as a "logical difficulty" that "if A
beats B to one finish line but B beats A to another, which result
fixes subjective sequence in consciousness" (sect. 1.1, para. 3)?
D & K's answer is to deny the existence of a unique sequence:
Different questions will evoke different answers. No one answer
is canonical.
There is no "logical difficulty." The conclusion D & K derive
from this vision is fallacious. It is based on what I consider to be
two errors. The first is that they confound different meanings of
"represent." In one sense this word refers merely to causal
consequences: Weakness may represent a result of malnutri-
tion. Firing in the afferent nerves from the knee, in the spinal
cord, in the motor nerve to the quadriceps, and the final knee
jerk, all represent consequences of a tap on the patellar tendon.
But none of them is a "representation" of the tap. A stimulus
does not produce a "representation" that travels through the
nervous system. Nothing in that sense travels. Neurons fire in
complex patterns, and this firing is modulated by the causal
consequences of continuing sensory stimulation.
A "representation" in the second sense is a signal or event
which has been assigned the burden of carrying a certain
meaning: A skull and cross-bones may represent danger; a
collection of letters may represent a spoken word; a painting
may represent a scene. In this way, some pattern of firing at a
limited or extended neural location could carry the meaning that
a certain stimulus pattern exists in the external world. This
neural activity could be temporally and spatially restricted or
localised. It should not be confused with the complete set of
neural consequences caused by the original peripheral
stimulation.
The second error is the assumption that "subjective se-
quence" is determined "in consciousness." I believe it is deter-
mined by neural processing, just like any other aspect of the
stimulus, such as color, shape, or location in space. The process-
ing of the location of a sound-source in auditory space provides
an interesting example. The location of the source determines
the time of arrival of sound waves at each ear. Each auditory
input has multiple neural consequences that almost certainly
include specific neural messages directed to a locus in the
midbrain at which the difference between their times of arrival
is determined, giving a measure which further neural computa-
tion uses to determine the azimuth of the sound-source. We
may be conscious of and able to report the computed direction in
space of the sound-source but we are not conscious of the time
disparity measure itself.
It is perfectly possible that such neural processing provides a
valid model for analogous neural processing used to compare the
times of arrival of different stimuli over longer intervals to
provide a basis for overt judgments of sequential order. The
point here is that it is not a matter of different "representations"
being seen to arrive (by what implicit observer?) at an arbitrary
"finish line" in consciousness. It is sufficient to establish that it is
coherent to propose, as a neural model, that specific neural
messages, engendered in relation to the action of given stimuli
on the sensorium, are directed to a dedicated temporal locus of
comparison-which extracts relative times of arrival, just as other
messages from the same stimuli may travel to areas which
determine color or analyse binocular disparity. All that is re-

mechanism could bias its measures to take account of whether
the stimulus timed acted on the foot or the forehead.
On this understanding, D & K are led astray by failing to
distinguish between neural processing on the one hand, and
hypothetical processes proceeding "in consciousness" on the
other, and their "model of consciousness" solves a nonexistent
problem. Their belief that it is impossible to establish temporal
sequence uniquely is a consequence of a mistaken model, not a
necessary limitation in information processing.
A related difficulty is D & K's reluctance to accept the
possibility of delayed processing. If the form of a temporal
gestalt depends on the later stimulation "would the brain always
delay response to one tap in case more came? If not, how does it
'know' when to delay" (sect. 1.2, para. 4)? D & K note "the
biological implausibility of such a squandering of time" (sect.
2.2, para. 14). But it is not a question of plausibility; it is a
question of what the facts are. The answers to these questions
are given by the experimental work discussed above, which
shows that in certain situations quite extensive delays may occur
before a perceptual computation is concluded. These delays
may reflect task requirements, and the subject's experience of
the situation.
D &â€¢ K attempt to solve these problems in a way that will avoid
assuming such delays, and their explanation has implications
they have not adequately considered. They reject the explana-
tions for apparent motion which they attribute to the Cartesian
Theater (CT) model, which apparently involve surgery on the
contents of conscious experience, evoked by subsequent infor-
mation. They offer instead a Multiple Drafts (MD) account in
which, when two flashes are presented in succession each is
discriminated, each presumably providing a corresponding
phenomenal experience. Where then does the movement come
from? When does it arise? According to the MD model: "Retro-
spectively the brain creates the content (the judgment) that
there was intervening motion, and this content is then available
to govern activity and leave its mark on memory. But . . . the
brain does not bother 'constructing' any representations that go
to the trouble of 'filling in' the blanks. . . . The judgment is
already in, so the brain can get on with other tasks!" (sect. 2.2,
para. 24).
This evades the difficulty of later phenomenal experience
adjusting earlier phenomenal experience, whether by insertion
or overwriting. But it fails to explain why, if we phenomenally
experience two flashes, and judge that there was movement
between them, we see one flash (not the two that on the MD
account we phenomenally experienced). The MD claim is that
we have a mosaic, two flashes that are experienced in a phenom-
enological sense, and movement between them that is not so
experienced but is actually inferred and misremembered as
having been experienced. This is a strange outcome for a theory
that sets out to avoid "extravagances," not least because this
account does not match what subjects report, whereas this
debate rests heavily on the authority given to subjective report.
But this account must seem even stranger if we consider that
apparent movement is not a rare phenomenon. When we watch
a cinema film we phenomenally experience projected frames 48
times a second, and "just conclude that there was intervening
motion" (sect. 2.2, para. 23) (of the many different directions and
speeds required by the many constituents of each frame) and
lodge this in memory, 24 times a second. Thus D & K have
perception (of form) racing along in its naive mechanist way to
keep in time with the stimulus input, frame by frame (avoiding
biologically implausible delays), while consciousness limps
along behind (conscious processes are allowed to tarry) "just
concluding" what the motion was, at this fantastic rate per
second. What a complex theoretical price to pay to preserve the
naive mechanistic assumption that two successive flashes must
give two phenomenal experiences, and to avoid accepting that it
is within the powers of neural mechanisms to lag sufficiently
behind input to give the best integrated interpretation of it.
D & K's view that "fixing the exact time of onset of some
representing element in some place in the brain does not
provide a temporal landmark" (sect. 2.1, para. 7), that is, there is
no "fact of the matter about exactly when . . . a conscious
experience happens" (sect. 3.1, para. 12) - raises the problem of
how different trains of sensory stimulation - such as the auditory
and visual consequences of external events - are matched up in
perception. To solve this problem they propose a "biolog-
ically . . . plausible" model of "content-sensitive settling" (sect.
2.1, para. 8). This is based on an analogy with the process of
synchronizing an audio tape with the corresponding length of
film by finding convergences between events recorded in each.
But this implies that the perception of these multimodal events
must be determined after they have been recorded on the dif-
ferent media and the media then matched up, which seems
incompatible with their stance above; and it overlooks that ac-
curate time recording in the construction of each tape is neces-
sary for such a process to work: Two such tapes could only be
matched up if timing devices have determined the rate at which
each was recorded. If the rate at which the film camera recorded
frames and the speed of the tape-recorder motor were not fixed
in a known relation, we would be unlikely to be able to find a
match between patterns of salient events on the two records.
The criticisms above are those that appeal to a psychologist:
failure to appreciate the potentialities of the neurophysiological
mechanisms underlying processing; and the misconceptions
that result if conclusions based on introspection are projected
onto the neural processing mechanisms. But they do appear
considerably to weaken the basis for Dennett & Kinsbourne's
philosophical superstructure.
Time for more alternatives

Dennett & Kinsbourne (D & K) argue in favor of their Multiple
Drafts (MD) model of consciousness and against what they call
the Cartesian Theater model by showing that the former is able
to explain various facts about the subjective timing of experience
that remain anomalous on the latter. They make a convincing
case against the Cartesian Theater, but they are less than clear
about just what the MD model entails and about exactly which
aspects of it are supposed to be supported by their arguments.
There are four main sorts of problems.
1. To what extent is the Cartesian Theater a straw man whose
defeat confers little credit on the MD model? That is, what other
alternatives are there?
2. In particular one can accommodate the temporal data on a
model that is not so antirealist or indeterministic about the
stream of consciousness?
3. Are there possible sources of evidence to decide questions
about the content of conscious experience beyond those that D
& K consider?
4. Can the phenomena to which D & K appeal support the
general conclusions they want to draw or are they special cases
of only limited relevance?
Let me deal briefly with each of these in turn.
D &â€¢ K intend the Cartesian Theater as a model not only of
historical Cartesianism but also of the Cartesian materialism
they find implicit and widespread in current thinking about the
mind. The theater metaphor is that of a place where "it all comes
together," a materialist version of the Cartesian bottleneck
between mind and body. The notion of place is understood quite
literally as a spatial location; the view as D & K put it is that if we
knew when, on the inward pathway of the stimulus, experience
occurred, then we could say where it occurred, and vice versa.

BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

Commentary/Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
Whatever the historical facts, it seems unfair to saddle current
friends of consciousness with the view that it occurs at a distinct
spatial location in the brain. The distinction between conscious
and unconscious processing can be significant and fairly clear
even if consciousness does not occur at a special place. Con-
scious states differ from unconscious ones in the processes they
involve, not in where they occur. Consciousness may well be a
more or less global brain state involving the simultaneous
activation and interaction of many different brain regions and
systems of representation; being spatially "smeared" in D & K's
sense does not rule out a clear divide between conscious and
unconscious stages of processing and awareness. Other features
of the Cartesian Theater seem to unburden it unfairly also. As D
& K present it, the model requires an observer who is all-seeing
and all-knowing regarding the perfectly determinate projec-
tions on the screen of the inner theater. What is projected there
can never be fuzzy or indeterminate, and though the observer
may succumb to rapid loss of memory, he can never fail to notice
anything on the screen before him at the instant of its presence.
Such strong commitments make the Cartesian Theater an easy
model to defeat, but again it is not clear that those who want to
be more realist about consciousness than the MD model allows
need to buy into such strong commitments.
Thus, turning to our second point, what might an alternative
model look like? One possibility is to distinguish as conscious
those representations and states of awareness that have phe-
nomenal properties and structure; my present conscious visual
awareness of the computer screen on which I am writing would
be a good example. Such states need not be locally realized;
indeed, the rich informational structure of phenomenal repre-
sentation (e.g., when I am visually aware of the computer I am
also aware of what it is and of its myriad relations to other sorts of
items) would probably require the simultaneous interaction of
many brain regions and representational systems. Since such
states would be the global, integrative of activity in many
subsystems, and would have phenomenal properties, we can
call this alternative the Global Integrative Phenomenal State (or
GIPS) model of consciousness. Like the MD model it denies
that there is any central homunculus or any special location in
which consciousness takes place. But unlike the MD model, it
takes seriously the distinction between phenomenal and non-
phenomenal representation; not all drafts and not all represen-
tations or content fixations count as conscious (nor is the differ-
ence just a matter of whether they can be reported, a criterion
that would make all the mental states of nonhuman animals
nonconscious). On the GIPS model, questions about a person's
state of consciousness at a given moment are questions about the
content of her phenomenal representations.
Can the GIPS model handle the data about subjective timing
without anomaly? I think it can. Consider the color phi. The
GIPS explanation would be more or less of the sort D & K call
Stalinesque. Apparent motion in phenomenal consciousness
would result when the interstimulus interval was shorter than
that of the integrative interactions producing the phenomenal
representation (note that representation need not be a com-
pletely independent downstream product of earlier representa-
tion as opposed to being a stabilized cooperative activation of
them) The resultant lag (of 200 ms or less) need not be biolog-
ically implausible, as D & K claim given
1. that it is so important to be aware of motion,
2. that the relevant integrative processes (not unlike what D
& K call content-sensitive settling) will take some time, and
3. that it is possible to make automatic or reflex responses
prior to and in the absence of conscious phenomenal awareness,
as D & K themselves note.
The third of these facts can also explain why the lag or delay is
not manifest in reaction time tests. Since the role of phenomenal
awareness does not seem to be to trigger automatic responses
but to provide a representation capable of planning and guiding
flexible and variable responses, a delay of a few hundred
milliseconds to carry out the integration generating such repre-
sentations need not have any costly consequences.
The GIPS model would also favor the standard or Stalinesque
explanation of meta-contrast or backward masking experiments.
The mask prevents the initial brief stimulus from being inte-
grated into phenomenal representation. D & K argue that the
Orwellian and Stalinesque accounts disagree about "a difference
that makes no difference." Their position is based on a
quasiverificationist claim that the two versions can equally
account for all the imaginable data. But (coming now to our third
point), it seems that there could be evidence relevant to settling
the dispute. D & K consider first person introspective evidence
and third person evidence of verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But there is also the possibility of third person neurological
evidence, which at least in the future might be evaluated in
terms of a theory of the neural basis of phenomenal experience
that could tell us whether or not the masked stimulus even
briefly generated what we independently knew to be the neural
correlate of phenomenal representation of the relevant stim-
ulus. Utopian hopes? Perhaps so. But in the absence of any
principled reasons to rule out such a possibility a priori, it seems
premature to conclude that the dispute is devoid of content.
In their summary D & K acknowledge that some critics may
accuse them of overgeneralizing from special cases (the fourth
sort of problem). And they admit with their mental counting
example that in typical macroscopic cases our experiences occur
in the temporal order in which we experience them to occur.
They nonetheless claim that the special cases are representative
of the brain's normal manner of functioning. However, the
reasons they cite in favor of this claim seem somewhat beside the
point. They appeal to the fact that our memories of past events
tend to be in the form of internally coherent simplified descrip-
tions that frequently lose or misrepresent details of temporal
sequence. This is undeniably true and it is consistent with their
view of the mind as continuously trying to spin consistent and
coherent scenarios, but it leaves untouched the central claim
that in our perceptual experience of events (as opposed to our
memories of such events) we experience the sequence of events
by experiencing them in that sequence. The claim of Mellor's
(1981) that D & K dispute is entirely about the perceptual
experience of succession, and it seems untouched with respect
to macroscopic perception. Facts about memory consolidation
seem irrelevant to the issue.
Thus I don't think D & K can be said to have dislodged or dealt
adequately with the view that phenomenal consciousness in-
volves what Kant called intuitions, i.e., continuous sensuous
manifolds of time and space within which phenomenal objects
and events are presented. Kant and a multitude of others may
have been wrong in supposing that conscious experience re-
quires such manifolds, but that remains to be shown. The GIPS
model draws a clear distinction between phenomenal and non-
phenomenal representation, and thus in the end it must provide
some account of the structure of phenomenal space and time.
The Multiple Drafts model as I understand it would give little or
no weight to the phenomenal/nonphenomenal distinction and
might thus avoid giving any such account. In order to avoid that
burden, however, it must make its case for rejecting the distinc-
tion and I don't think that case has yet been made.

Commentary/Dennett & Kinsbourae: Time and the observer
inner and outer event sequences arrive through different sense
organs at different times and are likewise distributed. Objects
are nevertheless perceived as integrated wholes - and event
sequences are experienced to form a coherent "consciousness
stream." In their thoughtful target article, Dennett &
Kinsbourne (D & K) ask how this is achieved.
According to Descartes (1644/1972), integration requires a
single interface between conscious experience and the brain,
provided by the pineal gland. Its central location is well suited to
transforming volitions originating in the soul into movements
and it provides a suitable point of convergence where disparate
retinal images can be combined into a single, integrated visual
field. In current theorizing the status of the pineal gland is less
exalted, but it is still widely assumed that information arriving at
the various sense organs is somehow integrated (with stored
knowledge, needs, intentions, etc.) not only to allow co-
ordinated, adaptive response, but also to provide an integrated
conscious stream (e.g., Baars 1989; Dixon 1981; Marcel 1983;
Navon 1991; van Gulick 1991; Velmans 1991b). A few theorists
follow Descartes in suggesting a central co-ordinating system
(for example, Dimond 1980; Penfield 1975); others allow that
the integrated neural correlates of consciousness may be widely
distributed throughout the brain (e.g., John 1976; Koch & Crick
1991; Pribram 1971; 1986).
According to D & K, these models subscribe to a form of
Cartesian Theatre in that they assume human information
processing relating to any given even to present a final, inte-
grated representation (of that event) to the "footlights" of con-
sciousness. Other than their commitment to cerebral integra-
tion, however, there is very little that is Cartesian about these
views. No current theory adopts Descartes' neurophysiology or
his account of processing. So it might be more accurate to call
this the "integrationist" position.
In D & K's Multiple Drafts model there is no integrated
"definitive stream of consciousness" in which information about
the world all comes together; there is only a "parallel stream of
conflicting and continuously revised contents." They claim that
this avoids the "scientific and metaphysical extravagances" of the
Cartesian Theatre, which assumes (1), that there is a place in the
brain where information from all relevant inputs is presented for
a final subjective judgement and (2), that the temporal ordering
of experienced events reflects the temporal ordering in which
representations of those events arrive in the theatre. By con-
trast, representations in the Multiple Drafts model are (1)
distributed both in space and time in the brain, and (2) "a
product of the brain's interpretational processes, not a direct
reflection of events making up those processes" (Abstract). This
characterization of current integrationist views, however, is
very misleading.
As noted above, only a few supporters of cerebral integration
propose that this occurs in a specific place within the brain, and
even fewer would assume that integration requires prior subjec-
tive judgement (one exception night be Eccles 1980). Indeed,
with respect to processing there is very little in D & K's
description of the Multiple Drafts model that differentiates it
from an integrationist account. Few integrationists would deny
that representations are distributed, both in space and time
within the brain; nor would they take issue with the view that
information encoded within neural representational states may
enter into subsequent mental functioning, rather than the
physical properties of such states (cf. Uttal 1978; Velmans
1991b, note 30). D & K accept the integrationist assumption that
in order to function with distributed representations, "the brain
must be able to 'bind' or 'correlate' and 'compare' various
separately discriminated contents" (sect. 1.1, para. 6). To allow
integration, interpretational processes must combine informa-
tion about inputs (contained within distributed representations)
with stored contextual information in "real time" (cf. Blu-
menthal 1977). Indeed, few integrationists would deny the
existence of "multiple drafts." The stream of consciousness
might be integrated, but it is in continuous flux and change. It is
difficult to envisage how dynamic change could be represented
without constant redrafting of representational states. Even in
the Cartesian Theatre the show must go on.
Consequently, the only difference between the models that
"makes a difference" is whether or not an integrated conscious
stream, with its corresponding integrated neural correlates,
exists. This is the core of what D & K deny.
Faced with the obvious - that we normally experience just
one world, not multiple worlds, and that we normally do so
without conflict about what we perceive - they plead massive
cortical self-deception! In the fraction of a second between
multiple, conflicting "drafts of experience" and subjective re-
ports, the "Orwellian" brain continuously rewrites history (on
the basis of the latest available information) to produce a consis-
tent "party line." Hence, we report having integrated experi-
ences, although there are no prior integrated experiences to
report. According to D & K, this scenario is more plausible than
the "extravagant" integrationist alternative - a "Stalinesque"
doctoring of the conflicting evidence prior to its presentation
before the "show trial" of conscious experience.
The integrationist model, however, requires neither doctor-
ing of the evidence nor adherence to any given party line. On
the contrary, it usually assumes the brain to be making the most
accurate mental model it can of what is going on, based on the
best available information, stored knowledge, and so on, at the
time of integration. As D & K ably demonstrate, relevant
information may arrive at different times, even that relating to
temporal sequencing. Provided that the information does not
arrive too late, information about temporal sequence (rather
than the arrival time of the information itself) is integrated into
the way temporal sequence is experienced (thus accounting for
Libet's "backward referral" findings). Colour phi and the cuta-
neous rabbit provide persuasive demonstrations of the way
cerebral processes integrate what is often partial information,
into a coherent, integrated experience.
Contrary to D & K's claim, this integrationist model is
theoretically less "extravagant" than their Multiple Drafts ac-
count. It assumes that within any given time window, informa-
tion is integrated into a single conscious stream and that unless
there is evidence to the contrary, subjects' reports about what
they experience are accurate. D & K require us to believe that
subjective reports are not reports of prior experience; for exam-
ple, subjects' claims to have experienced colour phi prior to
reporting it are based, they suggest, on rapid forgetting of
parallel, conflicting contents. It is what subjects believe at the
time of report that defines "what the subject was conscious of"
(sect. 2.2, para. 36).
This is theoretically self-defeating, for the reason that, at the
time of report, subjects believe that they are describing a prior,
integrated experience. A theoretical account that denies the
accuracy of this belief is in danger of being unfalsifiable. Unless
the conditions under which rapid forgetting occurs are precisely
stated (cf. Velmans 1991b, Note 6), one can invoke it at will to
deny the legitimacy of any. theoretically inconvenient reports.
In short, Dennett & Kinsbourne can be accused of doctoring the
evidence. It is their argument, rather than the integrationist
model, which is Stalinesque.

occurring in the brain "do have temporal properties, but those

properties do not determine subjective order." I also agree (with
qualifications given below) that "we perceive - and remember -
perceptual events, not a successively analyzed trickle of percep-
tual elements or attributes locked into succession as if pinned
into place on a continuous film" (Conclusion, para. 3). However,
since I have reached these general conclusions through a rather
different route, my formulation of basic principles is somewhat
different.
The conclusions drawn in the target article are based largely
upon analyses of illusions and apparent paradoxes involving
successive events, which are called "some 'temporal anomalies'
of consciousness" (sect. 1.2). I believe that these anomalies can
be explained most readily with the help of two principles
enunciated by Helmholtz during the last century: (1) We are
unable to observe our sensations accurately except as they are
useful in enabling us to recognize external objects; and (2)
illusions are the consequence of relating our sensory input to
objects (or events) which would normally produce a similar
input (Warren & Warren 1968, pp. 129, 175-76). Both the
"cutaneous rabbit" (sect. 1.2B) and "color phi" (sect. 1.2A) can
be considered as an interpretation of sensory input in terms of
events which would produce similar patterns.
Recall that the cutaneous rabbit appears to be a single salta-
tory object (the hopping rabbit) traveling up the arm in equidis-
tant steps, despite the fact that the stimulus consists of se-
quences of taps delivered in turn to each of three fixed positions
on the arm (wrist, near the elbow, upper arm). On catch trials
when only the series of taps to the wrist are given, the rabbit
hops in place. Yet, if this same succession of stationary wrist taps
is followed by elbow taps, the rabbit is perceived to move after
the very first wrist tap. This observation loses its paradoxical
flavor if we consider that a particular series of repetitive taps is
interpreted not as a succession of independent events (taps), but
rather as an integrated pattern produced by a single causative
agent. This agent cannot readily jump abruptly from one of the
three stimulated positions to the next within a single inter-tap
interval (which ranged from 50 to 200 ms).
The classical phi illusion is'produced by two stationary lights
separated by a few degrees: One of the lights is on while the
other is off, each flashing at a rate not too far below the flicker
fusion frequency. This display resembles that produced by a
single light source which is lit continuously and moves back and
forth between two end points. Such a moving object would have
the longest dwell time at the end positions as it slows to zero
velocity and reverses direction. Midway between these posi-
tions, the velocity would be greatest, and the retinal image
dimmest. The illusion of phi occurs when the neural response
pattern approximates that which would be produced by such a
moving object. In the modification of the classical monochroma-
tic phi described in the target article (see sect. 1.2A), the
flashing lights producing phi have different colors. The illusion
of movement still takes place (and the explanation offered for the
classical illusion still applies), with the change from one color to
the other referred to a location equidistant from the two
endpoints.
This alternative analysis of the illusions differs from that given
by D & K, but is nevertheless consistent with their statement
that "the temporal order of subjective events is a product of the
brain's interpretational processes, not a direct reflection of
events making up those processes" (last sentence of Abstract).
However, I believe that it is not only "the temporal order of
subjective events" that reflects interpretational processing by
the brain, but that perception in general follows this interpreta-
tional principle. As an example of the broader application of this
rule, I have suggested that when someone is asked to provide
quantitative judgments of sensory intensity, the "brain's inter-
pretive processes" evaluate input in terms of quantitative
changes of some familiar physical scale associated in a regular
fashion with changes in the level of stimulation. This approach to
psychophysical scales has served as the basis for a target article
on the measurement of sensory intensity in this Journal (Warren
1981).
To return to the topic of the temporal ordering of sensory
events, experiments with auditory sequences have indicated
that much of what appears to be direct perception of temporal
order involves recognition of a familiar pattern, followed by a
learned or inferred analytical description of components in their
proper order. Since this hypothesis has implications not only for
the "temporal anomalies" (sect. 1.2) described by D & K, but
also for the way sequences of brief items are normally processed
and interpreted, I will summarize briefly some empirical find-
ings and conclusions based upon this research.
The threshold for direct naming of the order of items in
iterated sequences of four sounds ranges from about 100 ms for
sequences of vowels (Dorman et al. 1975; Thomas et al. 197.1) to
about 300 ms for a succession of unrelated items such as hisses,
tones, and buzzes (Warren & Obusek 1972). The limiting
duration for direct identification of order in such sequences
appears to be the time required for attaching verbal labels to
successive items as they occur, with the minimum time re-
quired for sequences of vowels - for which the name identifying
the sound is the same as the sound itself (Teranishi 1977; Warren
1974a). This would appear to present difficulties for understand-
ing speech, since the phonetic components have average dura-
tions below 100 ms. However, when listeners are charged with
the task of discriminating between permuted orders of items,
they can do so readily at all item durations down to at least 10
ms, not only for sequences of vowels (Warren et al. 1990), but
also for sequences of tones (Warren et al. 1991) and unrelated
sounds (Warren & Ackroff 1976).
These and related experiments led to the hypothesis that
series of brief events are perceived holistically as "temporal
compounds" having different ensemble characteristics with dif-
ferent arrangements. Although such compounds cannot be
decomposed into their elements directly, it is quite easy for
listeners to learn the appropriate verbal labels describing the
components in their proper order (Warren 1974b). When this
occurs, listeners are not always aware that their temporal
analysis is inferential rather than direct.
Thus it appears that the identification of order within se-
quences of brief items involves a two-step process: (1) recogni-
tion of the patterns; and (2) recitation of a learned analytical
description. It should be emphasized that while the identifica-
tion of temporal order with brief events depends upon prior
pattern recognition, recognition of temporal patterns does not
require the identification of order, or even the identification of
the items themselves (for a discussion of the application of this
principle to speech perception, see Warren et al. 1990). How-
ever, D & K reverse the order of the two steps outlined above in
their description of the basis for phi. They consider that, when
two spots are projected successively at different positions on a
screen, "If the brain determines 'first A, then B' the spot is seen
as moving in one direction; if the brain determines 'first B, then
A' the spot is seen as moving in the opposite direction." They go
on to say that "this discrimination is, then, as a matter of logic,
based on the brain's capacity to make a temporal order judgment
of a particular level of resolution" (sect. 2.1, para. 12). I believe
that if we consider instead that patterns are recognized first and
then properties of these are patterns inferred, the conceptual
difficulties involving temporal anomalies and paradoxes de-
scribed by D & K are avoided.
In conclusion, although disagreeing on details, I agree with
the basic position of Dennett & Kinsbourne that we perceive
events rather than an ordered series of discrete elements. I hope
that my commentary will be considered as furnishing support
and extending the scope of this basic principle.

psfchoanatomy of consciousness:
integration occurs in single cells

There is much that is very attractive about Dennett &
Kinsbourne's (D & K's) psychoanatomy. Not the least is the
frank and forthright rejection of the shopworn notion that "the
brain has any deeper headquarters, any inner sanctum" that
mediates conscious experience. Flourens and Lashley would no
doubt approve. Moreover, it was particularly interesting to read
their scholarly discussion of the difference between what I had
called (in Wasserman 1985, p. 556) "a measuring operation and
the thing being measured." In D & K's terminology, this is the
difference between "the temporal properties of representa-
tions" and "the representation of temporal properties." Finally,
D & K offer an elegant and thorough presentation of the
obligatory implications of the spatial and temporal dispersion of
sensory signals in the brain. The intertwining of such dispersive
effects with the possibility of conversion from temporal to spatial
representation and vice versa (Uttal 1973) is fundamental to any
understanding of mental function.
To this generally sound discussion, I would only add the
caution that very little of the temporal "smear" in brain, ranging,
according to D & K, "up to several hundred milliseconds," is
due to axonal conduction delays. Even considering structures
that are putatively distant from the brain (like hands), the
conduction times of most axons are usually at least an order of
magnitude smaller than the times that would be necessary to
account for the temporal dispersion actually found in the brain.
Much of the dispersion is due to the temporal summation of slow
potentials inside single cells, of which more below. Hence, we
should distance ourselves from the tendentious notion - pro-
mulgated in the work of Libet cited by D & K - that the brain is
particularly far removed in time from the hand. It is not.
Certain particular features of the target article, however, are
problematic. Most troubling is the fact that the justified ringing
down of the curtain of the Cartesian Theater goes too far - to the
point where the authors neglect the constraints imposed by the
way neural integration actually occurs. D & K do recognize that
integrative activities are "precisely beatable in both space and
time" and that the "objective temporal properties of discriminat-
ing states may be determined . . . ," but they recognize no
important consequences of these facts.
Yet there are consequences for, as far as is now known, neural
integration only occurs in the brain in one way: by the summa-
tion of graded potentials inside single cells. In this regard, it is
worth stressing that the behavioral data under discussion by D
& K were elicited by experiments in which the relations of at
least.two stimuli were under investigation. For such stimuli to
interact, the neural representations of the two stimuli must
integrate. Despite certain interesting speculations (e.g., Pen-
rose 1990, pp. 643-706), there is no action at a distance in
brains. This means, as far as I know, that there is no way in which
the representation of one thing can integrate with the represen-
tation of another thing unless those representations integrate in
the literal sense of the word - by coming together. The only way
this can be done is by both projecting to at least one cellular
locus.
This does not mean that a single cell is any sort of theater
observed by a homunculus; what expresses the outcome of
integration in a projection neuron is the depolarization of its
axonal pacemaker at the axon hillock; in an intrinsic neuron,
what also matters are the depolarizations of the several pre-
synaptic specializations of its dendritic arborization.
To be certain of not being misunderstood: The distributed
anatomy of the brain and the consequent spatiotemporal disper-
sion of biological signals influences neural integration by deter-
mining what connects to what and when. Regional influences
are also known: Activity-dependent accumulation of potassium
in extracellular space modifies potentials across neighboring cell
membranes, as do field potentials produced by current flows
generated in neighboring cells. But the integration itself only
occurs in a particular way and in very small places - by
summation of slow potentials inside the membrane of single
neurons. All these other influences only determine whether
integration will occur and to what degree; they do not in
themselves produce any integration.
It is because of this fundamental property of the brain that we
have been studying the temporal dispersion of the cellular
representations of sensory signals. We find that such cellular
signals in natural neurons have properties that correlate with
temporal aspects of perception (see the reviews given in
Wasserman & Kong 1979; Felsten & Wasserman 1981; Nisly &
Wasserman 1989; Wasserman et al. 1990). And we find that
modifying the temporal waveform of such signals in artificial
neurons influences human perception (Wasserman et al. 1990).
The fact that such correlates exist in a single cell, of course, by no
means implies the vulgar concept that conscious perception
occurs there.
A second, less troubling, aspect of the target article is the
overinterpretation of certain experimental data, particularly
those on the color phi phenomenon reported by Kolers and von
Griinau (1971). It is difficult for me to see why it matters at all, in
the present context, that color phi is putatively discontinuous
while shape phi is putatively smooth. However, if this claimed
difference is of any theoretical importance, it should be recog-
nized that the experiment had certain procedural characteristics
that should lead to caution in accepting this characterization.
It will be recalled that Kolers and von Griinau did not rely on
introspection, which we now know is vulnerable to Orwellian or
Stalinesque distortion. Instead, they did an actual experiment-
they measured the colors and shapes of perceptions exhibiting
apparent motion at varying positions along their movement
trajectory. They made these measurements by providing ob-
servers with stationary comparison stimuli which they could
adjust to match their perception of the movement.
The measurements of shape phi and color phi, however, were
not equally sensitive: In the former case, the apparatus was
arranged-so that the shape of the comparison stimulus could be
adjusted to provide a completely satisfactory match to the shape
of the moving perception for two of their three subjects and a fair
match for the third.
But the control of color was considerably less satisfactory: The
color of the comparison stimulus could never match anything
any subject perceived. This limitation occurred because the test
stimuli that evoked the apparent movement perception were
produced by broad band light reflected from colored construc-
tion papers while the comparison stimulus was produced by
narrow band light selected by a grating monochromator. Hence
the saturations of the perceptions evoked by these stimuli were
perforce always markedly different.
All the subjects could do to "match" the color of the moving
perception was to vary the wavelength of the monochromator.
Hence, they were judging the similarity of one quality, hue, in
the presence of large differences in sensory quality. And they
had no way of producing measurements that would indicate a
graduated change of color appearance other than a change in
dominant wavelength.
In hindsight, one can see that a satisfactory answer to the
question now under discussion by D & K would have emerged
had Kolers and van Griinau provided their subjects with the
controls of a tristimulus colorimeter instead of just the single
knob of a monochromator. (In fairness to Kolers and von
Griinau, it should be noted [as D & K do note] that the principal
question they had designed their experiment to answer was
different from the one now under discussion: Kolers and von
282
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

Commentary/Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
Griinau wondered whether the hue of the moving perception
would go across the color circle from red to green or around the
color circle from red through yellow to green. Kolers and von
Griinau's experiment quite satisfactorily rejected the latter
alternative in favor of the former.)
I do not see that the smoothness of color phi matters very
much, but even if there is no god in the brain machine, God is
always in the details.
Closing the Cartesian Theatre

When we look around us, we experience an orderly arrange-
ment of objects in a three-dimensional environment. The appar-
ent orderliness and unity of everyday experience can seem hard
to reconcile with the evidence that perception is achieved
through the deployment of functionally separable mechanisms
for processing different types of information (and not just in
terms of information represented in different sensory
modalities; even within the visual system there is evidence of
differences between the processing of shape, colour, move-
ment, etc.). It is tempting to resolve this paradox by thinking
that somehow, somewhere in the brain, there must be some
form of higher-level integration.
Perhaps there is, but of course there is no need to integrate
everything. Integration is needed for certain purposes and not
others. As Dennett & Kinsbourne (D & K) make clear, we do not
need to assume that consciousness reflects what is now showing
at a central Cartesian Theatre. Yet, as the target article demon-
strates, this notion has proved difficult to shake off, and still
pervades much of our thinking. Until quite recently I had a
season ticket too.
There are other reasons than problems in subjective timing
for closing the Cartesian Theatre. The problems have become
clear to me in considering the mounting evidence that brain
injury can create different forms of selective loss of awareness
(Schacter et al 1988; Weiskrantz 1.986; Young & de Haan 1990).
For example, cases have been described in which brain-injured
people can accurately localise visual stimuli they claim to be
unable to see, can show evidence of recognising faces without
awareness of recognition, can learn characteristics of visual
stimuli they do not remember having seen, and so on. Nearly all
such reports emphasise that there is no evidence of any overall,
global change in consciousness, but rather a selective loss of
certain aspects of normal experience. Although it is possible to
accommodate these findings by thinking in terms of disconnec-
tion from a single conscious mechanism (Schacter et al. 1988),
the sheer diversity of the phenomena has led some of us to
wonder if this will prove adequate (Young & de Haan 1990). As
Stone and Davies (in press) point out, the multiple dissociations
revealed "make us realise that the phenomenon of mind is much
more complex and heterogeneous than we may initially be
disposed to believe." The Multiple Drafts model therefore looks
more plausible.
Returning to the point that some things do need to be
integrated, it is useful to consider an example; I will use
lipreading. Understanding speech only by lipreading is very
difficult, but there is now considerable evidence that lipreading
none the less provides support for speech comprehension, even
in people with normal hearing (Campbell 1989). To do this, the
brain must integrate information specified in auditory and visual
sensory modalities. An illusion discovered by McGurk and
MacDonald (1976) shows this neatly. In this illusion, a mismatch
between auditorily and visually specified phonemes results in
the perceiver blending the two; when watching a video of a
person mouthing the phoneme "ga," which is synchronised with
the soundtrack "ba," most people hear the fusion as "da." Yet
neither the visual nor the auditory recording track carries the
signal "da"; it is a genuine fusion. The reason we possess this skill
is not yet known with certainty, but it is likely that it relates
to the demands of learning to decode speech in infancy, when a
lot of time is spent watching people talking. Lipreading would
then be particularly useful because some of the sounds which
are difficult to distinguish auditorily are amongst those which
are relatively easy to lipread. [See also BBS multiple book
review of Massaro's Speech Perception by Ear and Eye, BBS
12(4) 1989.]
Like many illusions, the McGurk and MacDonald (1976)
effect is very compelling. You can easily convince yourself what
is on the auditory recording track by shutting your eyes, but as
soon as you open them again, the audio-visual fusion takes over.
Roberts and Summerfield (1981), however, have shown that if
one measures selective adaptation to these fused stimuli (with
eyes open), this is influenced only by what is on the auditory
recording track, not by the fused percept we hear. At one level,
this is entirely consistent with the Multiple Drafts model. One
(auditory + visual) draft corresponds to what we report that we
hear, but another (purely auditory) draft is the locus of the
selective adaptation effect. However, the perceiver is not con-
scious of the existence of the purely auditory draft. Perhaps we
are only meant to give something draft status if it is a conscious
draft, but even if this is so, there are nonconscious contributions
to be accounted for under whatever alternative name they are
allocated.
This is an obvious point, but I think it is important. In
accepting that the Cartesian Theatre oversimplified the prob-
lem of consciousness by giving it a single locus, we should not
commit the opposite error of assuming that consciousness is
everywhere in the brain. The idea of Multiple Drafts is a help,
but some aspects of its relation to consciousness still need to be
worked out.
Editorial Commentary
If there are Orwellian (misremembered) and Stalinesque (mis-
perceived) events then it would seem that there must be
unproblematic Reaganesque (veridical) ones too (such as the
instant when I actually had my simple, punctate, "pink-
elephant-now" thought) - otherwise, relative to what are the
other two mistaken? Moreover, if the fact of a matter is neither
objectively nor subjectively ascertainable, it is not clear why it
should follow that it does not exist (e.g., the fact about whatever
the true correlation - surely nonzero - might be between how
things appear and how they are). Not only does there seem to be
no reason to believe that the nonlocalizability of conscious
events in real time is a metaphysical rather than just a meth-
odological problem, but, as S. Sternberg (private communica-
tion) has pointed out, it may not even be a methodological
problem in principle, only in practice: In principle, if I could
have enough punctate pink-elephant-now thoughts in enough
otherwise variable contexts, their neural invariants could be
identified by sufficiently powerful techniques of signal/noise
averaging and analysis. It may be like looking for a needle in a
haystack, but surely there is a point in real time when at least my
Reaganesque pink-elephant-now thoughts really occurred,
even if their neural substrate was complicated and distributed.
Problems with mental timing are manifestations only of the
incommensurability (apart from quantitative correlation) of ob-
jective and subjective qualities, not the nonexistence or indeter-
minacy of the latter. As long as the Cartesian Theatre is not
occupied by a homunculus, it seems a perfectly reasonable

setting for a Reaganesque melodrama experienced by me. And
it's the absolute timing of my experiences, not my "representa-
tions" that's at issue, is it not? [Note that none of this has
anything to do with (1) veridicality relative to any external object
or event that the pink-elephant-now thought is "about" because
the experience is completely endogenous. Nor is (2) the accu-
racy of memory relevant, because all we want to know is when
the actually experienced now actually occurred. Likewise irrel-
evant is (3) the possibly distributed ("imperial") nature of the
concurrent neural event that corresponded to now. And surely
irrelevant too is (4) the signal-detection-theoretic platitude that
at a sufficiently minute scale the punctate now experience, like
all psychophysical judgments, turns out to be smeared across an
interval of uncertainty rather than being mathematically punc-
tate, because the "grain" of that smear is subexperiential. ]

We wish to thank the commentators for their largely
constructive criticism. It is gratifying to discover that
some of them had been thinking â€” and in some cases
publishing - ideas along similar lines. We claimed that
Cartesian materialism, the view of the brain with some
deep center where "it all comes together" for conscious-
ness, often seduces even those who explicitly reject it. As
Neisser (1976), an early critic of the view, has said: "It is
currently a very popular notion, and with good reason. It
represents a theoretical coup: Not only are the facts of
attention apparently explained, but psychology's most
elusive target is finally nailed down to a box in a flow
chart" (p. 103). Even now, Damasio remarks, it "informs
virtually all research on mind and brain, explicitly or
implicitly." Indeed, serial information processing models
generally run this risk (Kinsbourne 1985). The commen-
taries provide a wealth of confirming instances of the
seductive power of this idea. Our sternest critics (Block,
Farah, Libet, and Treisman) adopt fairly standard Carte-
sian positions; more interesting are those commentators
who take themselves to be mainly in agreement with us,
but who express reservations or offer support with argu-
ments that betray a continuing allegiance to one or an-
other tenet of the view we sought to discredit.
The issues are extraordinarily slippery, and reading the
commentaries has been a daunting experience. If only we
had thought of putting it this way, rather than that way -
it would have forestalled one all-too-reasonable objection
or another. We first present, then, a refined summary of
our central view, much improved, we think, by its anneal-
ing in reaction to the commentaries. Then we turn to the
major themes expressed in the commentaries, and finally
we respond to additional important issues raised.
1. Multiple Drafts: An improwed summary
All the work that was dimly imagined to be done in the
Cartesian Theater has to be done somewhere, and no
doubt it is distributed around in the brain. This work is
largely a matter of responding to the "given" by taking it -
by responding to it with one interpretive judgment or
another. This corner must be turned somehow by any
model of observation. In the traditional view, all the
taking is deferred until the raw given, the raw materials of
stimulation, have been processed in various ways. Once,
each bit is "finished" it can enter consciousness and be
appreciated for the first time. As C. S. Sherrington (1934)
put it: "The mental action lies buried in the brain, and in
that part most deeply recessed from the outside world
that is furthest from input and output."
In our model, this single unified taking is broken up in
cerebral space and real time. We suggest that the judg-
mental tasks are fragmented into many distributed mo-
ments of microtaking (Damasio 1989a; Kinsbourne 1988).
The novelty in what we attempt here lies in how we
develop the implications of this fragmentation. We have
not merely broken the Cartesian Theater into thousands
of minicinemas (Moskies & Wood, Lycae, Glymour et
al.). Here is where the intuitive distinction between
conscious taking and unconscious taking tends to beguile
the theorist. It seems as if we are stuck with only three
alternatives:
A. Each of these distributed microtakings is an episode
of unconscious judgment, and the consciousness of the
taken element must be deferred to some later process (the
Stalinesque show trial in a Cartesian Theater). But then
how long must each scene wait, pending potential revi-
sion, before the curtain rises on it?
B. Each of these distributed microtakings is an episode
of conscious judgment (multiple minicinemas). But then
why don't we all have either a kaleidoscopic and jumbled
"stream of consciousness" or (if these distributed micro-
takings are not "co-conscious") a case of "multiple selves"?

BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

Response/Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
Is our retrospective sense of unified, coherent conscious-
ness just the artifact of an Orwellian historian's tampering
with memory? As several commentators (Baars & Fehl-
ing, Libet9 Aronsoe et al.) ask, how can the manifest
coherence, seriality, or unity of conscious experience be
explained?
C. Some of the distributed micro takings are conscious
and the rest are not (e.g., Block's "Cartesian modularism"
with a spatially distributed "module"). The problem then
becomes: What'special property distinguishes those that
are conscious, and how do we clock the onset of their
activity (Clark)? And, of course, since distributed micro-
takings may occur slightly "out of order," what "mecha-
nism" serves to unify the scattered microtakings that are
conscious (Teghtsooeiae), and in each case, does it oper-
ate before or after the onset of consciousness (i.e., which
phenomena are Orwellian and which are Stalinesque)?
Our view is that there is yet a fourth alternative:
D. The creation of conscious experience is not a batch
process but a continuous one. The microtakings have to
interact. A microtaking, as a sort of judgment or decision,
cannot just be inscribed in the brain in isolation; it has to
have its consequences - for guiding action and modu-
lating further microjudgments made "in its light," creat-
ing larger fragments of what* we called narrative. In the
target article we were silent on the mechanisms of inter-
action, but we did not mean to rule out processes that
amount to partial construction .of intermediate cases as an
effect of a microtaking, rather than as its basis, as a way of
ensuring the appropriate further influences (see our dis-
cussion of Shepard and Roskies & Wood? below). This
interaction of microtakings, however it is accomplished in
particular cases, has the effect that a modicum of coher-
ence is maintained, with discrepant elements dropping
out of contention, and without the assistance of a Master
Judge. Because there is no Master judge, there is no
further process ofbeing-appreciated-in-consciousness, so
the question of exactly when a particular element was
consciously (as opposed to unconsciously) taken admits no
nonarbitrary answer.
Jeaeeerod provides an elegant demonstration of one
prediction of this model when he and his colleagues
demonstrate disunity of the self when examined in terms
of timings of a fraction of a second. The time when the
subject initiates a reaction to a stimulus depends on which
effector â€” in this case hand or voice â€” is used, a finding
incompatible with a single locus of decision in the Carte-
sian Theater (see also Marcel; in press). Whether they
have really shown a dissociation between a preconscious
(hand) response and a response based on a subjective
experience (voice) is open to question. The amount of
reprogramming needed to redirect a motor response
already in formation would appear to be minimal and the
reprogramming is accomplished under circumstances of
very high stimulus-response compatibility. The vocal
response, its relation to the stimulus being arbitrary, is
less compatible. Possibly, had the task called for an
imitative vocal response, subject to occasional minor
modification, and an arbitrary manual response to such a
change, the opposite difference would have been found:
far briefer vocal than manual latency. There is no way of
knowing whether the vocal response preceded, coincided
with, or followed awareness of the stimulus. Indeed,
there is nothing to know; all that can be said is that the two
response types are directed by separate "drafts."
Some of the commentators (Libet, Trelsman, Vel-
mans) took us to be defending B, the Orwellian view.
Patently we were not; we were instead demonstrating
that it was the mirror image of A, the Stalinesque view,
and that neither of them could evade the charge of
unfalsifiability. Glymoer et al. mistakenly supposed that
our model "includes the notion of consciousness as an
observer and interpreter of some 'draft.'" This is precisely
not our view; interpretation is not reserved for some one
draft; all drafts are products of (not just candidates for)
interpretation, independently of consciousness. At least
one commentator (Lloyd) took us to be defending C and
criticized us for failing to provide the distinguishing mark
of the conscious takings. Other commentators did under-
stand that we were defending something like D, but they
took it to be too radical, metaphysically. Because this Is an
almost overpoweringly plausible view, we will respond to
it first, before going on to other objections.
2. Is there a fact of the matter?
The commentators generally agree with us that (1) the
time of representing should not be confused with the time
represented, and (2) there is no privileged place within
the brain "where it all comes together." They do not all
agree with us, however, that it follows from (1) and (2) that
the Orwellian/Stalinesque distinction must break down
at some scale of temporal resolution, leaving no fact of the
matter about whether one is remembering mis-
experiences or mis-remembering experiences. Here,
some claim, we have gone overboard, lapsing into "ver-
ificationism" (Lycan, Van Gulick, Clymour et al.) or
"eliminativism" (Antony, Glymoer et al., Aronson et al.)
or "antirealism" (Lloyd, Van Gulick), or some other gra-
tuitously radical position (Velmans, Treisman). This is
curious, for we consider our position to be un-
problematically "realist" and materialist: Conscious expe-
riences are real events occurring in the real time and
space of the brain, and hence they are dockable and
locatable within the appropriate limits of precision for real
phenomena of their type. (For an extended defense of this
version of realism, see Dennett 1991a.) Certain sorts of
questions one might think it appropriate to ask about
them, however, have no answers because these questions
presuppose inappropriate - unmotivatable - temporal
and spatial boundaries that are more fine-grained than the
phenomena admit.
In the same spirit we are also realists about the British
Empire - it really and truly existed in the physical space
and time of this planet - but, again, we think that certain
sorts of questions about the British Empire have no
answers, simply because the British Empire was nothing
over and above the various institutions, bureaucracies,
and individuals that composed it. The question "Exactly
when did the British Empire become informed of the
truce in the War of 1812?" cannot be answered. The most
that can be said is "Sometime between December 24,
1814, and mid-January, 1815." The signing of the truce
was one official, intentional act of the Empire, but the
later participation by the British forces in the Battle of
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2
235

Response/Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
New Orleans was another, and it was an act performed
under the assumption that no truce had been signed.
Even if we can give precise times for the various moments
at which various officials of the Empire became informed,
no one of these moments can be singled out - except
arbitrarily - as the time the Empire itself was informed.
Similarly, since You are nothing over and above the
various subagencies and processes in your nervous sys-
tem that compose you, the following sort of question is
always a trap: "Exactly when did I (as opposed to various
parts of my brain) become informed (aware, conscious) of
some event?" Conscious experience, in our view, is a
succession of states constituted by various processes oc-
curring in the brain and not something over and above
these processes that is caused by them.
The idea is still very compelling, however, that "real-
ism" about consciousness guarantees that certain ques-
tions have answers (even if they are currently unknow-
able). Embedded in the target article were grounds for
rejecting this position but they did not stand forth for
some of the commentators. Here, thanks to the light
thrown by the commentaries, is a more succinct version of
the basic argument.
The only difference between the Orwellian and Sta-
linesque treatment of any phenomenon is whether the
editing or adjustment or tampering occurs before or after
a presumed moment of onset of consciousness for the
contents in question. The distinction can survive only if
the debut into consciousness for some content is at least as
accurately timable as the events of micro-taking (the
binding, revising, interpreting, etc.) whose order relative
to the onset of consciousness defines the two positions. If
the onset of consciousness is not so sharply marked, the
difference between pre-presentation Stalinesque revi-
sion and post-presentation Orwellian revision may disap-
pear, and be restorable only by arbitrary fiat.
As "realists" about consciousness, we believe that there
has to be something - some property K - that distin-
guishes conscious events from nonconscious events. Con-
sider the following candidate for property K: A contentful
event becomes conscious if and when it becomes part of
a temporarily dominant activity in cerebral cortex
(Kinsbourne, 1988, and in preparation). This is deliber-
ately general and undetailed and it lacks any suggestion of
a threshold. How long must participation in this domi-
nance last, and how intense or exclusive does this domi-
nance need to be, for an element to be conscious? There is
no suggestion of a principled answer. Such a definition of
property K meets the minimal demands of "realism," but
threatens the presumed distinction between Orwellian
and Stalinesque revisions. Suppose some contentful ele-
ment briefly flourishes in such a dominant pattern but
fades before leaving a salient, reportable trace on memory
(a plausible example would be the representation of the
first stimulus in a case of metacontrast). Would this
support an Orwellian or a Stalinesque model? If the
element participated for "long enough" it would be "in
consciousness" even if it was never properly remembered
(Orwell), but if it faded "too early" it would never quite
make it into the privileged category, even if it left some
traces in memory (Stalin). But how long is long enough?
There is no way of saying (contra Libet, see below). No
discontinuity divides the cases in two.
But perhaps we are overlooking some source of discon-
tinuity; perhaps there is a sharp (enough) break after all,
so that the third alternative, view C, can be maintained.
Clark claims as much: We might "still discover that there
is some functional property . . . which is both necessary
for a content to become consciously known and yields an
absolute temporal order of experiences. . . . I cannot see
that this possibility is ruled out by anything that D & K
tell us."
Suppose, then, that what makes some contentful brain
events conscious is a property K that has a rather clear-cut
onset. On such a view, contentful events, like plants,
have rather long histories; they are unconsciously sown,
develop, briefly bloom (rather suddenly acquiring some
salient property K), and then fade into long-term memory
or oblivion (losing property K). A single contentful event,
let us suppose, can have a temporal subpart that is
conscious, marked by the onset and offset of property K.
To identify the subset of conscious events, just identify
property K and motivate its identification. In order for
any such claim to be taken seriously, some reason(s) must
be given for singling out this property K, whatever it is, as
the mark of consciousness (and hence the time of onset of
K as the time of onset of consciousness). It will not do just
to announce without further explanation that when
events acquire property K, unlike their unconscious kin,
they glow in the dark, as it were.
It is this independent motivation, we claim, that cannot
be provided. There is no further functional or neu-
rophysiological property K over and above the properties
that account for the various "bindings" and effects on
memory, speech, and other behavior, and those proper-
ties cannot distinguish between Orwellian and Stalin-
esque models. Once discrimination and control get dis-
tributed around to many subagencies, operating on
different schedules, all the accomplishments of con-
sciousness occur, one way or another, at one time or
another, but no grounds remain for deeming one version
of these events the "actual conscious experience."
The EDITORIAL COMMENTARY provides a minimal test
case: a "simple, punctate, 'pink-elephant-now' thought."
Surely its onset in consciousness is unproblematically
dockable! As the Editor writes, "all we want to know is
when the actually experienced now actually occurred."
Let's consider the details. However "simple" and "punc-
tate" it appears to be, the thought has to be composed, for
it consists in (at least) three content components, pink,
elephant, and - a tricky one - now, which must be
generated and "bound" together somehow (the thought Is
of an elephant that is pink, and pink now, not just the
thought of elephant, and pink, and now). The first two
components may be generated in different regions, at
slightly different times, and could presumably even ac-
quire property K at different times. Or presumably they
could get bound together but fail to acquire property K
and fade away without ever being experienced, an uncon-
scious pink-elephant-now content. This raises the ques-
tion: Does the content pink become conscious before or
after it is bound to elephant? That is, does the "binding"
happen before property K is acquired by each element
(the Stalinesque theory) or do the content elements
acquire property K seriatim, perhaps in the order that
they are generated in the brain, with the binding taking
place only after all the elements are conscious (the Or-
wellian theory)? Or does the question not make sense (our
236
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

Response/Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
theory)? An analysis of the neural invariants recorded
over hundreds of variations of pink-elephant-now
thoughts may show precisely what conditions ensure that
such a thought occurs at roughly such-and-such a time,
and may even show considerable variation in time of
binding relative to such other temporal landmarks as
onset of pink activity and onset of motor response forma-
tion activity, but the one landmark that matters has no
independent anchor: onset of K. The subject cannot
provide any clues unobtainable by an analysis of the
neural activity, because ex hypothesi the different in-
stances are all the same subjectively - simple and punctate.
But what about "the actually experienced now'? The
content now is tricky because, unlike pink and elephant,
it is indexical: It refers to its own vehicle of representa-
tion, and hence bridges the gap between temporal prop-
erties represented and temporal properties of represent-
ings. But this fact creates a problem instead of solving
one: The "concurrent neural event that corresponded to
now' (the tokening of now, in philosophers' jargon) is
presumably spread over a preconscious forming period
and a postconscious remembered period (like a postcard
on which you write "Please visit me now' and later mail to
a friend, on whose desk it sits for weeks). Unless one can
independently identify the onset of consciousness, the
discovery of a "now" token in the brain hopelessly under-
specifies a time of intended "utterance." The actually
experienced now is presumably not the preparatory,
forming-but-not-yet conscious now, or the reverberating-
in-memory now, but the blooming-with-property-K now.
How the Editor proposes to identify the thresholds that
mark the transition of the tokening of now between these
three states remains a mystery, because no functional
difference has been shown to depend on these transitions
and all the subjective evidence concerns only the
temporal properties represented in the thought (e.g.,
the content: "Now" is I was simultaneous with "pink-
elephant"), not the temporal properties of the represent-
ing. So even in the case of such a simple "punctate"
thought, in which no questions arise about its veridicality
relative to any external world it is portraying, when the
Stalinesque/Orwellian distinction looms, nothing could
settle it.
It is unclear to us why the Editor chose the epithet
"Reaganesque" for his example, but it strikes us in any
case as peculiarly apt for making our point, not his. Recall
the question that rang through the land during the Iran-
Con tra hearings: What did the President know and when
did he know it? This question mattered only because it
was presumed that the President was actually in charge,
actually a responsible decision-maker. But (according to
widespread opinion) while the Great Communicator was
an excellent public relations officer, he was otherwise a
mere figurehead whose authority was more a convenient
fiction than the wellspring of decision. If this is so, there
were surely many times when it didn't make any political
difference whether Reagan actually said the things that
his staff had decided it would be good for him to say - or to
have said. He could "fill in" the words if he wished, but if
he didn't, no harm would be done. In the case of Reagan,
there actually always was a (negligible) fact of the matter,
but unless you think there is a Reagan homunculus in you,
whose activities are for some reason constitutive of con-
sciousness, there is no reason to believe in the analogous
fact of the matter for "Reaganesque" events in your brain.
In systems in which the authority and decision-making
are distributed as they were in the Reagan White House
and are in the brain, there is a sort of Virtual President but
there is no fact of the matter about exactly where and
when a Virtual President announces to himself "pink
elephant now."
The onset of property K (whether it is gradual or sharp)
is a temporal property of the representing, not a temporal
property represented and, as all agree, we must be
careful not to confuse these. There is a danger of confu-
sion precisely because there is bound to be some sort of
regular relation between them: It is no accident that
representations of sequences of events will tend to be
represented by sequences of representations of those
events, that events represented as simultaneous will tend
to be simultaneously represented, and so forth. A similar
point applies to spatial properties: The representation of x
surrounded hy afield ofy will tend to be accomplished by
a representation of x surrounded by a representation oft/,
and so forth, but the space in the brain in which the
representation is accomplished is not the space repre-
sented, however regular the correlation between spatial
properties represented and spatial properties of the
representation.
Rollins makes two points in this regard that we accept:
(1) Temporal isomorphism may be required for some
temporal tasks, and (2) the appeal to isomorphism need
not commit what he calls the canonical fallacy. Sometimes
the freedom to order events shrinks for all practical
purposes to zero and isomorphism returns. It is easier to
understand this point if we remind ourselves of its spatial
analogue: Even though there is no general reason why the
brain should always represent spatially contiguous re-
gions of the world (or the body, or the retinal image of the
world) by spatially contiguous vehicles of representation,
there are circumstances in which the exigencies of engi-
neering make this a very good, well nigh inevitable,
solution to the design problem. But even when this is the
case, we must be careful not to view the spatial isomor-
phism as a determining feature of the representational
content rather than a limiting condition on the freedom of
the vehicles. We must also not make the mistake of
"restoring" the isomorphism in some dimly imagined
later process. (The back-to-back semicircles of excitation
that occur on the occipital cortex when one is visually
stimulated by a large circular ring don't have to be
reunited into a circular representation somewhere in
order to be the brain's way of representing a circle. The
same moral applies to time.)
3. When does "filling In" happen?
Shepard9 while largely in agreement with us, claims we
have gone too far in disparaging "filling in." We agree with
Shepard that the target article permitted the inference to
be drawn that the brain never bothers doing something
like filling in and that this would be an overstatement. His
work has shown clearly that there are phenomena in
which there are analog or roughly continuous processes
that do amount to a sort of filling in: As he puts it, these
processes "successively activate (or 'fill in') intermediate
states corresponding, in concrete detail, to what would be
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2
237

Response/ Dennett & Kinsbourae: Time and the observer
successive intermediate states in the external world."
Moskies & Wood make the same point citing further
phenomena in which a sort of filling has been shown to
occur. Their discussion also provides oft-repeated warn-
ings â€” they appreciate the need for eternal vigilance -
against the dangers of overinterpretation: "One cannot, of
course, conclude that these particular neuronal effects are
the only basis or the most important one for the subjective
experience of color-filling." Indeed one must be careful
not to jump to the conclusion that a particular instance or
neuronal filling in (or, as the connectionists would say,
vector completion) should be viewed as the basis, as
opposed to an effect, of subjective experience. Vector
completion - for example, in remembering - is not filling
in of the sort we were criticizing. Vector completion is not
"paint" used to render the evidence for some ulterior
conclusion; vector completion is the conclusion. No more
"giving" is needed because no more "taking" is going to
occur. Such a process has the nice property of merging
the distinction between presentation and judgment,
turning the corner from given to taken without turning
the corner sharply. Notice how we can accommodate
Shepard's phenomena, for instance, without lapsing back
into the Cartesian Theater. Suppose, in his illusory mo-
tion experiment, a visual subsystem in the subject's brain
has arrived at the microjudgment that the vertical bar
moved clockwise. But of course not just clockwise, but at
a particular rate and during a particular window of (repre-
sented) time. Suppose this elaborated microjudgment is
represented by an analog process, which in turn provides
the grounds for a second microjudgment, provoked by
the precisely timed probe spot flashed along the illusory
trajectory of the moving bar, to the effect that the spot
flashed before or after the bar had crossed that point.
Each bit of judgment becomes the basis for further
judgment, blurring the distinction between given and
taken. The taking that there was motion happened before
the taking that the spot was such and such - it had to,
logically - but it also provided the basis for the judg-
ment that in midcourse the dot was in such and such a
location.
Such processes do provide, as Roskies & Wood claim,
"a candidate explanation for observers' reported subjec-
tive experience," which does not mean that they provide
an explanation of the construction of the "given" that is
then subsequently taken by some further process of
subjective experiencing. In their discussion of apparent
motion, they propose a testable hypothesis:
The perception of apparent motion might begin with an
initially nondirectional priming from the first flashed
stimulus. If another stimulus with similar characteris-
tics should appear within the primed region before the
activation has decayed, a motion signal [our emphasis]
might be generated, either by potentiating the inter-
vening circuit or by sending a signal that is interpreted
by other areas as coding motion.
The point we would make - and we gather that
Shepard and Roskies & Wood would agree - is that a
motion signal is not to be confused with a motion picture,
even when it is accomplished by a process (which is not
itself accessible to consciousness) that generates inter-
mediate states. (For more on "filling in" and evidence of
analog or "roughly continuous" processes in perception,
see Dennett 1991b).
4e Consciousness as a "system" with a function
One of philosophy's virtues is that it sometimes makes
explicit the assumptions that are more covertly driving
the imaginations of theorists in other disciplines, expos-
ing them for assessment. A fine case is provided by the
commentaries; the assumption that might be formulated
in the following slogan:
Every real thing must be in its own box.
According to Antony 9 the most charitable interpreta-
tion of our position is "eliminativism": "Consciousness
does not exist." He eventually arrives at the correct
reading of our view: "Conscious experiences are tem-
porally located, but the time scale appropriate for the
measurement of neurophysiological events (e.g., milli-
seconds) is too fine-grained to determine nonarbitary
temporal boundaries for experiences." From this, how-
ever, he draws the ominous - and mistaken - conclusion
that "conscious experiences have no role in the functional
organization of the brain." (See Velmaiis for a similar
conclusion, and also his BBS target article, 1991.) The
conclusion we would draw instead is that conscious expe-
riences have no role in the functional organization of the
brain in virtue of meeting some criterion of consciousness.
Becoming a conscious experience does not clearly endow
an event with potencies it previously lacked. Antony says
it follows from this that "conscious experiences cannot be
identified with functional states or processes," but this is
true only in the sense that conscious experiences cannot
be identified as a' type with any particular functional type.
That is a far cry from "eliminativism." The events that
constitute conscious experiences do play functional roles
that can be timed down to the millisecond, but when or
whether they play those roles is independent of when or
whether they make the cut into the elite circle of con-
scious events.
The assumption that consciousness cannot be real un-
less there is a consciousness subsystem can be seen
playing a slightly less visible role in the commentaries of
Teghtsoonian, Baars & Fehling, Velmans9 and Farah.
(Bridgemae clearly expresses the case against the
assumption.)
Teghtsoonian argues for a "central monitor" on the
grounds that cross-modal comparison is a demonstrably
real phenomenon. (Contrary to what he supposes, we do
not claim to offer any arguments, new or old, against
dualism. We assume that dualism is a dead horse, but that
Cartesian materialism is alive and well, and worth com-
batting.) We agree with him that very many experiments,
by S. S. Stevens and others, demonstrate conclusively
that people can do cross-modal comparisons, which in-
volve getting all the information into the same physical
system. This "single monitor" is called the brain. Teght-
soonian takes the brain's capacity to serve all these com-
parative purposes as evidence for the existence of moni-
toring "systems" and then goes on to say that presumably
similar monitoring systems exist for other attributes.
Depending on how we understand "system" this is either
trivially true, or entirely unlikely. People can compare
the experience of falling in love with the experience of
contracting a disease, or going into battle, but this gives
no grounds for thinking that there is a monitor system (a
"module" as some would say) specifically made for this
238
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

Response/Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
comparison task. We can construct comparison "machin-
ery" on the fly, ad lib., as we need it - thanks to the richly
interconnected brain that provides the underlying hard-
ware. The risk we run if we start diagramming these feats
with the "boxological" flow charts of functionalism is that
we will assume that the boundaries of the boxes we draw
have a salience and integrity that project beyond the cases
that inspired us to draw them.
(Our only misgivings about Lycan's "inner sense" ver-
sion of "UnCartesian materialism" concern his eagerness
to reify all the episodes of corner-turning from given to
taken into the acts of "internal scanners," which then
encourages him to assert that "An internal monitor is an
attention mechanism that can presumably be directed
upon representational subsystems and stages of same."
The difference in emphasis is slight, but the effects
multiply. Before you know it, you are apt to have a
warehouse of Crick-style (Crick 1984) searchlights il-
luminating - for their operators? - various attention-
grabbing scenes. We urge Lycan to read Bridgemae's
concluding point: "Consciousness is not a monitor of
mental life but a result of mental operations separated
from the immediate sensorimotor world.")
In the same vein, our only quarrel with Baars &
Fehling concerns their assumption that they cannot be
realists about consciousness unless* they consider their
global workspace to be a "system" of limited capacity (and
every item is either inside or outside the system), instead
of saying that the brain has a limited capacity to perform
the feats described on the left of their Table 1, and its
performance of them can be seen as constituting the
establishment of something rather like a global workspace
(see also Bridgemaii9 who expresses the same view,
which is elaborated in Dennett 1991b). Responding to
Reingold's well-put request, we would view Baars &
Fehling's Table 1 not as marking distinct qualitative
marks of consciousness but as perspicuously describing
two poles (there are others) between which quantitative
(but not easily quantified!) variation establishes the intui-
tive opposition between unconscious and conscious.
The difference between Velmans's "integrationist"
model and our Multiple Drafts model can be very suc-
cinctly stated: We agree with him that there are dis-
tributed processes of integration that tend, normally, in
the fullness of time, to achieve a relatively integrated
version of the world â€” the stream of consciousness that
emerges in subjects' introspective and retrospective pro-
tocols; we just insist that there is no bridge across the
stream! Velmans claims that in his view "within any given
time window, information is integrated into a single
conscious stream and that unless there is evidence to the
contrary, subjects' reports about what they experience
are accurate." If one were to expand this time window of
consciousness to include% every instant between initial
stimulation and ultimate report, one would rule out all
pre-experiential and post-experiential editing: For exam-
ple, the subject would be held to be just as conscious of a
raw retinal image as of any subsequent interpretations of
it. If one tries to shrink the window so that all adjustments
of content can be located as pre-experiential or post-
experiential, one must draw in the bridge across the
stream. What counts as "evidence to the contrary" de-
pends on where one draws these boundaries (consider the
insanely radical Orwellian hypothesis that we are con-
scious of the dizzying swim of imagery on our moving
retinas in spite of what we subsequently say - we just
continually forget it). Velmans notes, correctly, that the
Orwellian view is in danger of being unfalsifiable. Indeed,
and the same danger faces its Stalinesque twin.
Farah provides a nice demonstration of a familiar sort
of theoretical blindness: Since you can (if you insist on it)
redescribe any phenomena without mentioning con-
sciousness, you can convince yourself that models of those
phenomena that do mention consciousness tell us nothing
about it. The target article is about consciousness because
the phenomena in question are invisible to any research
program that does not interpret subjects' protocols as
accounts of conscious experience. If you treat the sub-
jects' verbal behavior as so much emitted noise, the
questions about subjective sequence, for instance, just
cannot arise. Farah says that we "have not, so far, shed
any light on the mechanisms of consciousness." What
does she think these are, if not the very mechanisms of
which we treat? If she means that there are additional
mechanisms of consciousness, she has simply revealed
her own unregenerate Cartesianism, materialist or dual-
ist. If Farah Is merely insisting that it is open to the
theorist to claim that a subject who performs speech acts
apparently descriptive of conscious experience might be a
zombie just unconsciously mouthing the words, we would
agree, but we did not think it necessary to direct our
argument to those who still believe in zombies.
More explicit exploitation of the assumption that if it is
real, it must be a system, can be found in the commen-
taries of the philosophers, Lloyd9 Block, and Van Gulick.
It beguiles Lloyd when he misattributes view C to us,
claiming that our theory is not a theory of consciousness at
all because "some parts of the multiple parallel streams
are conscious, and some are not." Rather, we claim that
there is no crisp way of telling exactly which parts of the
multiple parallel streams are conscious. Any one of the
streams sometimes contributes to awareness and some-
times not. No one stream is necessarily conscious by its
very nature (see Kinsbourne, in preparation, for an ex-
tended discussion). And that is our theory of conscious-
ness. It is a bad day for "realism" when only phenomena
with hard-edged, necessary and sufficient conditions can
be considered real. More pointedly, when Lloyd goes on
to declare that our "antirealist" arguments "collapse in the
face of the reality of conscious experience, as undeniable
for us as it was for Descartes," he pledges his allegiance to
one of the most persistent illusions of Cartesian material-
ism: how it seems to be fixes how the seeming must be.
Consciousness seems to be all or nothing, but as undenia-
ble as that fact is, it does not license the conclusion that
consciousness is all or nothing, that either there is a box in
which consciousness, and nothing but consciousness,
exists, or consciousness does not exist at all.
Block proposes that the seeming is accomplished in a
"Cartesian Module," the one functional place in the brain
that provides us with "phenomenal consciousness." He
claims that we mistakenly assume without argument that
there is no such thing as phenomenal consciousness.
Well, what is it? Block supposes that we all just know:
"Our fundamental access to phenomenal consciousness
derives from our acquaintance with it." Whatever phe-
nomenal consciousness is, Block tells us it is not any of the
sorts of consciousness captured by such functional prop-

Response!Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
erties as "inferential promiscuity" (essentially, the prop-
erty represented on the left of Table 1 in Baars & Fehling)
or accompanying second-order thoughts (see Rosenthal).
Block sees an opening for what he thinks will be a
nonarbitrary way of sorting brain events into the con-
scious and unconscious: "What if some of the brain repre-
sentations of an event . . . are phenomenally conscious
whereas others are not?" Indeed, what if? Shall we find
out which these are by asking subjects? If so, all the
arguments of the target article apply, for the quandaries
arise precisely because of the problems encountered in
interpreting the protocols or introspective claims of sub-
jects. Does Block then hold, perhaps, that it is only
possible to determine correlations of phenomenal con-
sciousness with brain events by autocerebroscopy? Even
here we will run into problems, according to Block's own
account, for even the most careful and persistent auto-
cerebroscopist is stuck relying on his own judgments of
what seems to be happening, but "to assume that the
subjective is exhausted by judgments is to beg the ques-
tion against phenomenal consciousness, which, if it exists,
is wot just a matter of judgments." So a subject studying
himself with an autocerebroscope (and his native intro-
spective talents) will not be able to avoid begging the
questions against the existence of phenomenal con-
sciousness.
It may be folly for us to attempt to say anything more
about a putative phenomenon so sublimely inaccessible
to investigation as phenomenal consciousness, but since
both Block and Van Gulick venture to propose models of
it, a comment is in order. The main attraction of Stalin-
esque theories, apparently, is that they agree with Des-
cartes that the Show Must Go On, and it is worth noting
that both models are Stalinesque. This is explicitly stated
in the case of Van Gulick's GIPS model. It is less obvious
in the case of Block's Cartesian Modularism, the view that
"all conscious events occur in a single system," but it
follows from the supposition that events occurring in a
single system will be the effects of events occurring in
other systems - the idea is that after some unconscious
discriminatory machinery does its work, it sends some
effect to the Consciousness Module so that its results can
be properly bathed in phenomenal properties. We are in
no position to assert that any model of "phenomenal"
consciousness would have to be Stalinesque, but it looks
like a good bet.
Consider Van Gulick's GIPS model. Like Block, he
claims that his model "draws a clear distinction between
phenomenal and nonphenomenal representation," but he
similarly does not venture any account of what this dis-
tinction is. He claims that neurological evidence could be
used to secure it, however, and in his account of meta-
contrast supposes that we could confirm or disconfirm his
Stalinesque interpretation by relying on "what, we inde-
pendently [our emphasis] know to be the neural correlate
of phenomenal representation of the relevant stimulus."
But this cannot just be asserted - as if we could tell by
looking at the neurological evidence that some of the
neural events glowed in the dark. Our point is that when
we turn to the only imaginable source of "independent"
evidence for the distinction - the judgments of subjects,
as expressed in their protocols (or our own judgments, if
we use the autocerebroscope) - we find the Janus-faced
evidence of Orwell/Stalin. Moreover, when we acknowl-
edge, as Van Gulick insists, that such judgments cannot
be viewed as infallible (he mistakenly supposes that our
attack on the "straw man" of Cartesian materialism de-
pends on this), we must admit the need for some Archi-
medean point that can impeach a particular judgment on
neurological grounds, throwing us back on the require-
ment of motivating, independently, the identification of
some neurological feature (some property K) as the mark
of "phenomenal" representation. Can this be done? The
target article claims that it cannot, drawing for support on
a general argument that makes no specific mention of
"phenomenal" consciousness. Block has given us no rea-
son to think that phenomenal consciousness (whatever
that is) would be more rather than less readily anchored to
independent neural correlates, and as he notes, there are
plenty of detailed arguments directed against the concept
of phenomenal consciousness in Dennett (1991b).
lisman tilt at
and Treisman both reveal that they expect no
illumination of the issues from the efforts of philosophers,
and perhaps this shared attitude â€” and its accompanying
low estimate of how informed they presume the authors
to be - contributes to their egregious misreadings of the
target article.
Libet makes it clear that he is not a dualist. We are
happy to have given him the opportunity to disengage
himself more sharply than before from his dualist sup-
porters. We also accept his clarification of what we had
viewed as an equivocation between a radical and mild
version of "backwards referral." We note, however, that
in the very sentence in which he claims to have been clear
about the distinction, he uses a dangerously equivocal
phrase; he claims to have demonstrated "the subjective
timing of sensory experience as appearing [our emphasis]
before the time of the adequate neural representation for
the experience." In the absence of his declaration, one
might well be tempted -to read this the way the dualists
did: as the claim that a sensory experience actually
appears (blooms in consciousness) before the time of the
adequate neural representation, rather than what he
apparently means: It only appears to appear in conscious-
ness before that time.
Libet makes it clear at the outset that his primary
motive for preferring a Stalinesque model is that it seems
to him to explain "the actual experience of a single
narrative" - something our view, in his opinion, cannot
handle. (Aronson et al. and Van Gulick also seem to think
that it is easier to explain the observed unity of conscious-
ness by positing a single Stalinesque theater, but as
Hurley notes, "the unity of the collection of vehicles in
the theatre provides only an illusion of understanding the
unity of consciousness.") Often Libet simply assumes the
Stalinesque interpretation of his experiments. When he
does address the Orwellian alternative (which is not, as he
thinks, our model), he misunderstands it. For instance,
he thinks he can eliminate the Orwellian alternative to his
Stalinesque account of metacontrast by claiming that
Orwellian "intensification" of memory is more ad hoc than
"obliteration," ignoring the fact that the Orwellian alter-
native was introduced by us as one in which memory
"improvements" were inserted. And in his description of
240
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

Response /Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
his study of somatosensory thalamus stimulation (Libet et
al. 1991) he mixes the Stalieesque and Orwellian inter-
pretations of his results without noticing it: "Clearly,
subjects had a memory of a brief stimulus, which they
later correctly identified [in a forced choice guess], but no
reportable [our emphasis] awareness." That is just what
the Orwellian would say, insisting that this showed that
subjects were (briefly) conscious of the stimulus in spite of
the fact that it was not subsequently reportable.
Libet's response to the technical criticisms we men-
tioned is misplaced. We chose to direct attention to his
interesting work in spite of the widespread opinion that
they "involved very few subjects, were inadequately
controlled, and have not been replicated." Referees and
readers of early drafts of the target article had objected to
our choice of his phenomena on these grounds (see also
Treisman), so we felt obliged to acknowledge that opin-
ion. In fact we share it, and are quite qualified, as is
Churchland (see especially 1981b), to express criticisms
about both his methods and interpretations. We do view
the target article as supporting his conviction that there
should be further attempts to replicate this difficult work.
Libet points out that there were three factors in addi-
tion to the one we cited for his estimate of the time of
"neuronal adequacy" for consciousness, but the other
three are more obviously question-begging in the context
offending off Orwellian alternative models. His discus-
sion in sections 3.2 and 3.3 repeats his misunderstandings
of the Orwellian alternative (and the idea that it is our
alternative) mentioned above. For instance, he fails to
notice that (1) the Taylor and McCloskey (1990) results are
neutral between an Orwellian and Stalinesque treatment,
(2) his claim that "the experimental evidence is precisely
that the initiating neural events produce conscious inten-
tion, but only after a delay of about 350 msec" is itself
question-begging, and (3) in his analysis of the Grey
Walter experiment, he is not entitled to take the subjects'
reports at face value as an indication of the order in which
the crucial events actually happened in the brain.
Treisman misreads the target article, and then directs
his lengthy discussion against a fantasy of his own con-
struction. Most of his points are simply versions of points
we make ourselves, or thought too obvious to need
rehearsal, and his assertions about the implications of our
view are almost all far wide of the mark. Perhaps we are to
blame, but others did not misread it as radically as he
appears to have done. For instance, Treisman says there
is no paradox; that was our point. The paradox arises only
when one interprets the events through a mistaken view,
the Cartesian Theater. He reads the questions we put in
the mouth of a naive mechanist as questions we ourselves
set out to answer, when in fact we set out to discredit
those questions much as he does (we are not Orwellians, a
fact that has escaped him).
He claims that we make two major errors. First, we
confuse two different senses of "represent." He cites no
instances, and in fact we use the term always in a sense
that carries a connotation of content that is potentially
usable by the system. Second, we suppose that "subjec-
tive sequence is "determined in consciousness." This idea
that we "fail to distinguish between neural processing on
the one hand and hypothetical processes proceeding 'in
consciousness' on the other" is a wild misreading, since it
is precisely our point that there is no such arena in which
anything could be determined by any hypothetical pro-
cesses. Of course it is neural processing that determines
subjective sequence. Our point is that once this has
happened, there is no further phenomenon: There is no
"running in proper sequence" or "projection" of the con-
tents whose order has been fixed by those neural
processes.
Once Treisman's views are sorted out, they emerge,
not as he thinks, as an alternative to ours, but as a
truncated or underspecified version of ours. For example,
he agrees with us that thanks to the in variance of what he
calls relation U the subjective sequence need not mirror
the objective sequence of events in the brain. And he also
says that "we can safely conclude that the extent of the
delay before the neural mechanisms reach a perceptual
decision on an input may vary with the Context in which
the subject operates and toe nature of the task." Of
course. But he does not go on to address the question of
whether this implies that consciousness of the relevant
events is in all respects delayed until all such perceptual
decisions have been made. Does Treisman think, for
instance, that there is no consciousness at all of the second
tap in a cutaneous rabbit test until the brain has had a
chance to arrive at the perceptual decision that the tap Is
displaced? Until he actually confronts such questions, we
won't know whether Treisman is In complete agreement
with us, or is seduced by either an Orwellian or a Stalin-
esque vision.
68 Other objections
Wasserman (see also Libet) points out that the problems
of temporal smear - ranging up to several hundred
milliseconds - are not due directly, as we suggested, to
the slow speed of axonal transmission but rather to the
competition between larger patterns of neuronal activity
that take time to be resolved. The fact remains, however,
that the speed limit for such resolution is ultimately a
function of the basic cycle times for individual neural
elements. Although we also agree with Wasserman that
the ultimate basis for any neural integration must be the
summation of graded potentials inside single cells, single
neurons are too "stupid" to be responsible, on their own,
for whole micro takings, so we must advance to the level of
larger patterns of activity to find appropriate machinery
for accomplishing such judgments.
We ventured no details on how to model these pro-
cesses, but Gregsoe provides an elegant account of hy-
pothesized dynamics of neural systems that predicts the
existence In principle of temporal anomalies of conscious-
ness; his analysis may contribute to an explanation of how
the multiple draft machinery works. In particular, it
provides a response to Wasserman (who argues that
integration in the last analysis must take place by summa-
tion, on the minltheatrical stage of the individual neuron)
by suggesting coupled neural dynamics as an integrative
principle. Incidentally, Wasserman's point that three or
more coupled processes sometimes become chaotic ap-
pears neatly applicable to Norman's (1967) observation
that when subjects rapidly identify successive sequences
of visual or auditory stimuli, they often believe them-
selves to have experienced the last two stimuli in reverse
order. Clearly, according to Gregson, such an occurrence
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2
241

Response/ Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
-does not necessitate belief in a sequence concretely
located in the brain.
Wasserman usefully elaborates the details of the
Kolers and von Griinau (1976) experiment with color phi,
but we would hold that he is mistaken in claiming that
their choice of dependent variable, having the subjects do
a matching task instead of giving an oral response, altered
the situation in such a way as to avoid the Orwell/Stalin
quandary. Given the instructions, when a subject leaves
the knob in a particular orientation, this amounts to
uttering a predefined speech act, a more refined and
accurate speech act than would be verbally achievable,
but still the product of judgmental processes that allow
room for the quandary to arise.
Warren is in more agreement with us than he realizes.
He slightly misreads our remark about how, as a matter of
logic, certain discriminations must amount to temporal
discriminations. We agree with him that "patterns are
recognized first, and then properties of these patterns
inferred" - when they are, which is seldom the case for
some such properties. Consider the same point in a
different domain. If subjects can distinguish between
tachistoscopic presentations of the words "back" and
"buck," this must be, as a matter of logic, a case of being
able to distinguish two stimuli that differ only in one
property: The presence or absence of the tiny bit of
black that distinguishes the "A" from the "[/" in the
typeface used. But of course the subject doesn't make
this discrimination by first looking for that bit of black
and then drawing an inference about the identity of the
word.
Block begs to differ from our interpretation of the
quotations of Hamad (1982; 1989), Mellor (1981), and
Churchland (1981b), and invites the reader to look again.
We second the invitation. In his discussion of the Mellor
quote, he says "the issue here is not one of judgments, but
of experience of relations among experiences." We take
Van Gulick to attempt the same defense of Mellor. This
seems to mean that the experience of having the experi-
ence of A-as-happening-before-B must be the experience
of having the experience of A before having the experi-
ence of B, but Mellor offers no argument for this (deeming
it self-evident, we presume), and as we argued in the
target article, there are reasons for abandoning this tradi-
tional prejudice. Glymour et al. produce a passage that
succinctly illustrates the fundamentally tempting confu-
sion: "Suppose a temporal sequence composed of experi-
ences Â£1, Â£2, Â£3, in that order. Either the content is
experienced in that order too [our emphasis], or that
temporal sequence is not experienced at all." To sustain
their claim, the italicized phrase must be read to carry no
implications at all about whether the content is experi-
enced as in that order, but this is hardly a familiar
reading. Suppose, for instance, that the temporal se-
quence in question is a dream and suppose it is actually
dreamt backwards (Â£1 is the shocking conclusion, Â£2 is
the midgame, Â£3 is the opening scene). Now if dreams are
experiences, then either the content is experienced in the
order conclusion-midgame-opening or it is not experi-
enced at all, but it must not be supposed to follow that
such a dream would be experienced as anomalous in any
way (Dennett 1976). If the dreamer found the whole
experience anomalous, this would not be because of the
order in which the content was experienced but because,
for one reason or another, the content was experienced as
being in the anomalous order.
Shepard faults us for claiming that no one draft is more
"correct than another." Here he overlooks our intended
meaning, which was not, as he supposes, that no one draft
is apt to be a more veridical account of what happened in
the environment and in the control structure of the agent
(we agree with his remarks about this), but simply that no
subsequent introspective report can claim to be a veridi-
cal account of "what happened in consciousness" - as
opposed to an account of what happened in the brain one
way or another.
Aronsoe et al. offer figures that do not accurately
represent the claims made in the target article. Their
Figure la shows Orwellian editing to be preconscious,
and Figure 1b apparently models view C, not the multi-
ple drafts view (the same misreading found in Lloyd). We
are unclear about how to interpret their preferred dia-
gram 1c, but the lines from "local discriminations" to the
"functional theater" make it appear to be some version of
the Cartesian Theater after all.
7= Sypporting arguments
We want to express our appreciation to Damasio?
Hurley 9 McDermott5 Meiegold5 Mosentliat, and Young
for commentaries that support our position with consider-
ations drawn from very different quarters.
Damasio, MeiegolcS9 and Young all confirm our convic-
tion that, in spite of disclaimers, allegiance to the imagery
of the Cartesian Theater is a widespread bad habit of
thought, not a straw man as some commentaries suggest.
Damasio cites neuroanatomical grounds for resisting
this temptation, which is a valuable antidote (though not,
of course, a refutation) to Libel's claim that "the existence
of such a single locus is not yet experimentally excluded."
Damasio says, correctly, that a satisfactory model of
consciousness should indicate how the unintegrated frag-
ments operate to produce the integrated self; we have
tried to respond to this demand in sections 1 and 2 above.
We agree that somatic states play an ineliminable role in
any robust integration of consciousness, but the issues
raised by the specifics of such a proposal are beyond the
scope of our discussion.
Damasio also alludes to Sherrington's idea, recently
refurbished by von der Malsburg (1987) and others, that -
one might say - timing is binding. We agree that there
may well be something deeply right about this idea but if
so, two implications should be noted: (1) The timing that
binds is not a photo-finish but a phasic relation between
concurrent events whose neural consequences have a
considerable temporal spread, and (2) insofar as simul-
taneity of phase behavior plays the role of pure binding, it
necessarily becomes unavailable to play the role of a basis
for a judgment of simultaneity. (For example, the succes-
sive notes of a melody are bound but certainly are not
represented as occurring simultaneously, nor does the
use of delay lines to create a simultaneous representation
of the successive notes appear to be a workable mecha-
nism for binding. For an analysis of some of the relevant
issues, see Port 1990, and Port & Anderson 1990.)
Young uses the McGurk effect to support the Multiple
Drafts model by showing how unreliable introspection is
242
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1992) 15:2

References/Dennett & Kinsbourne: Time and the observer
as a source of knowledge about how what seems to happen
actually happens.
Roseethal and Hurley both note that a particularly
tempting traditional Cartesian assumption is that what-
ever consciousness is, it is an intrinsic property of those
mental states that are conscious. Both then show, by
somewhat different routes, how this assumption suffices
to make the Cartesian Theater seem inevitable. Giving up
consciousness as an intrinsic property, Rosenthal recom-
mends that we adopt the term transitive consciousness for
what we have called property K: the property the acquisi-
tion of which makes a mental state conscious. At first this
appears to open up what might be called a forced choice
for the theorist: Orwellian or Stalinesque? But he shows
that any answer will be, as we claim, arbitrary. Hurley
arrives at the same verdict. These commentaries provide
valuable support for our position, by showing how its
most "radical" conclusions are consistent with a tradi-
tional metaphysical position that relinquishes only one
dubious feature of the Cartesian heritage: the idea of
consciousness as an intrinsic property.
Hurley also anticipates and rebuts the objection that
our view is "verificationist," and in particular notes that
"to object that the 'observer' to whom manifestation is
being required is oneself at a slightly later time is to
assume the temporal atomism about consciousness that is
[our] target."
McBeraiott speculates about the underlying moral
anxieties that may well provide a hidden agenda In sup-
port of Cartesian materialism. As he says, in a forthright
rejection of this theme, "if people are valuable, it is not
because they are imperishable souls connected to bodies
only for a brief sojourn." There is more on this Important
topic in Dennett (1991b).
