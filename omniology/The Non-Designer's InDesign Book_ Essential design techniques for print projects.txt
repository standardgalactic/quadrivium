fAP
And being fap, sir, was (as they say) cashiered:   
and so conclusions passed the careers.
bardolph, The Merry Wives of Windsor, 1.1.163–164
fap: on a drinking bout; fuddled;   
confused or stupefied with alcohol
Bardolph responds to Slender’s charge that his 
purse was stolen by Falstaff and his cohorts.
To be cashiered is to be dismissed from   
an office or from military service in disgrace. 
So Slender being fap, his conclusions, or 
his judgments and reasonings, passed the 
careers, which is to make a charge in a jousting 
tournament. In other words, the matter got   
out of hand, but it was Slender’s own fault.

vastidity
Ay just, perpetual durance, a restraint—
Though all the world’s vastidity you had—
To a determined scope.
isabella, Measure for Measure, 3.1.67–69
vastidity: immensity, vastness
Isabella's brother is to be executed, and she has 
just told him there is a way he might live, but it 
will fetter him till death. He asks if it’s perpetual 
durance (imprisonment), and she replies as 
above—that his freedom would entail a perpetual 
imprisonment that would bind his soul to a limited 
scope (through guilt and shame, which her brother 
doesn’t know yet), even though his body could 
wander through the vastidity of the world.

exsufflicate
Think’st thou, I’d make a Life of Jealousy, 
To follow still the changes of the Moon 
With fresh suspicions? No: to be once in doubt,
Is to be resolved. Exchange me for a Goat,
When I shall turn the business of my Soul
To such exsufflicate and blow’d Surmises,
Matching thy inference.
othello, Othello, 3.3.191–197
exsufflicate: inflated, swollen, improbable
Othello, bless his heart, believes he will not make 
a habit of jealousy and be forever changing his 
heart as often as the moon changes phases. He 
assures Iago that he needs proof of the inferences 
that Desdemona is untrue. If Othello were to 
listen to such exsufflicate and blown rumors, 
then you can turn him into a goat.
The word blow’d (or blown) means insinuated, 
inflated or blown out of proportion, or fly-blown 
(tainted with fly poop). Or all of the above.

BlInd-worm’s StiNg
The blind-worm is a legless lizard. 
It isn’t blind and it has no sting at 
all; that is, it rarely bites and if it 
does, it has no venom and very 
tiny teeth. Adding a Blind-Worm’s 
Sting to a potion is like adding 
chicken’s teeth.
Lizard’s lEg
Lizard’s Leg is sometimes believed to be any creeping ivy 
plant, but is more likely to be a reference to the Lizard 
Orchid (himantoglossum hircinum). The orchid, shown 
above, looks like a lizard diving into a ower. The blossoms 
are stinky, though—as the Latin name indicates (hircinum = 
of male goat), they smell very strongly of goats. 
Because the roots of most orchids look like testicles (the 
Greek word orchis means testicle), they have long been 
used in love potions in many forms, including a simple  
spell of carrying the tuberous root in a sachet. Also for  
this reason, orchids are believed to be the food of satyrs. 
The Lizard Orchid grows almost exclusively in Kent, an 
area of England that appears in the Shakespeare plays more 
than any other in the country, besides London. 
How let’s wing
An howlet is an owl or a baby owl and, as usual, a “wing” 
is a leaf, in this case a downy leaf from the Holy Thistle 
(carduus benedictus), “the best remedy that grows 
against all melancholy diseases,” per Gerard. (This is 
not the milk thistle.) Holy Thistle was used to cure the 
plague and induce mother’s milk, and was also known 
as an aphrodisiac for men. Hieronymus Bock, an early 
sixteenth-century botanist and physician, explains that 
Holy Thistle is singularly good against all poison, making 
it an interesting choice of herb to be thrown into 
the cauldron.
Shakespeare mentions this plant by both its 
English and Latin names in Much Ado About 
Nothing: Margaret teases Beatrice about 
Benedick and tells her, “Get you 
some of this distilled Carduus 
Benedictus, and lay it to your 
heart: it is the only thing for  
a qualm.”

Scale Of DrAgon
Dragonwort or Dragon’s-Wort (wort refers to 
a plant, herb, or vegetable used for food or 
medicine) is known more commonly to us as 
tarragon, that delightfully different herb that 
has a slight licorice flavor and whose roots 
are serpentine. The Latin name for tarragon, 
artemisia dracunculus, means “little dragon” 
(of the artemisia family). It was used it to cure 
snakebites, toothache, and scurvy, as well as
to flavor food. Gerard calls it “biting dragon.” 
A “scale” is a leaf, so the Wyrd Sisters are 
throwing a leaf of tarragon into the pot.  
ToOt H of WolF
Wolf’s Tooth is another name for 
ergot, a fungal disease on cereal 
grains, particularly rye, in which 
elongated, black spurs that look 
like wolves’ teeth (shown to 
the left) grow in the ears of the 
cereal. Eating food made from 
contaminated grain can result in 
ergotism. Research now shows 
that ergotism is the probable 
cause of an epidemic of “madness” 
in England in 1355; of visions, 
convulsions, and compulsive 
dancing in Germany in 1374; and 
of many cases of hallucinations, 
strange behavior, and even 
uncontrollable blaspheming that 
were the basis for numerous witch 
hunts throughout history. How 
ironic that the witches add this 
item to the cauldron!
Culpeper describes how to make a mummy 
out of a jay bird and cumin seeds, then
pulverize the bird and use the dried powder 
as a medicine for epilepsy. 
In Oswald Croll’s early seventeenth-century 
book, Royal Chemistry (Basilica Chymica), he 
provides a recipe to make your own mummy, 
should you deplete your Egyptian supply: “Take 
the fresh corpse of a red-haired, uninjured, 
unblemished man, 24 years old and killed 
no more than one day before, preferably by 
hanging, breaking on the wheel or impaling . . .
Leave it one day and one night in the light of the 
sun and the moon, then cut into shreds or rough 
strips. Sprinkle on a little powder of myrrh and 
aloes, to prevent it from being too bitter. . . . 
Steep the flesh in spirit of wine for several days. 
Then dry the strips by hanging in the air.” 
Witches’ 
Mummy
Mummy is an ancient medicine 
made from wrapped and dried 
bodies, mostly from Egypt. 
Paracelsus, the sixteenth-century
physican, alchemist, and occultist
states, “There is no remedy more 
certain and more tting for the human 
body than the human body itself reduced 
to a medicament.” He compares its power 
(especially of one of his own recipes) to that 
of the alchemical Philosopher’s Stone. Mummy 
is seen in old recipes and medical books to cure 
a remarkable variety of illnesses, and was hugely 
popular among the Elizabethans—Sir Francis Bacon 
always carried a pouch full of it on his person. Certain 
kinds of mummy could reconcile estranged husbands and 
wives—a useful medicament for Macbeth!
The pharmaceutical rm Merck & Co. sold Egyptian 
mummy in their catalogs up until 1908.

GalL ±f goAt
The Wyrd Sisters lead you to believe they are 
tossing the gallbladder of a goat into the pot. But 
a gall is an abnormal growth formed on plants 
and trees in response to insect larvae or parasites. 
The Goat Willow (salix caprea, also known as 
Pussy Willow) is more susceptible to gall forma-
tions than almost any other plant or tree. It has 
apparently been called Goat Willow since at least 
the time of Hieronymus Bock’s illustrated herbal 
(Kreutterbuch) of 1546 that shows the shepherds’ 
custom of grazing their goats on the plant.
Gerard suggests one spread the green boughs 
of Goat Willow with its leaves around the beds 
of “those that be sicke with agues, for they do 
mightily coole the heate of the aire, which thing 
is a woonderfull refreshing to the sicke patients.” 
Gerard also cites the 
work of the ancient Greek, 
Discorides, who recom-
mends burning the bark to 
ashes and mixing the ashes 
with vinegar to alleviate 
corns on your toes.   
Slips of Yew
Every mention of yew in Shakespeare relates 
to death. Not only is the yew (taxus baccata)
poisonous, but since ancient times it has been 
seen as a protector of the dead. Ancient yew 
trees are found in many graveyards in England 
(especially in the west of England), typically 
planted on the west side of an old church, which
is where the bodies are buried. The trees, 
some more than 2,000 years old, are found 
in churchyards because this tree was sacred 
to the Celts and Druids; the Catholic church 
appropriated the ancient religions by using the 
sacred Celtic spaces and objects as a means of 
transitioning their belief system.  
In Macbeth, Shakespeare mentions that the Slips 
of Yew are to be cut off in slivers: “Sliver’d in 
the Moon’s Eclipse.” The moon’s eclipse is the 
waning of the moon, which is traditionally the 
best time to collect herbs and plants if you want 
to use them for curses or banishings. 
Nose of Turk
The “nose” is the pistil from the Turk’s Cap lily; the flower 
droops and the petals curve upward, creating a turban 
shape, thus the pistil and stamens are underneath the “cap.” 
The word martagon in its Latin name, lilium martagon, 
is a Turkish word meaning turban or cap; 
Gerard calls this flower the Lily 
of Constantinople. The roots 
of lilies have always been 
used to alleviate a variety of 
conditions, from childbirth to 
“swellings in the privities” to 
eye inflamations and speech 
inrmities.

The Shakespeare Papers
One that was a woman Sir; 
but rest her Soul, 
she’s dead.
3
Emelia is murdered 
by her husband.
Her dying thought 
is of Desdemona, whom
she has befriended, served, 
and loved.
Gratiano:
The woman falls:
Sure he hath kill’d his Wife.
Emelia: 
Ay, ay: oh lay me by 
my Mistress’ side.
Gratiano:
He’s gone, but his wife’s kill’d.
Othello, 5.2.244–246
Her maid, Emelia

Cordelia
“Dead as earth” 
is such a gripping and complex 
little phrase. 
We tend to think of earth 
as rich and life-giving. 
Why did Shakespeare choose 
“dead as earth”?
Enter Lear with Cordelia in his arms.
Lear:
Howl, howl, howl: O you are men of stones,
Had I your tongues and eyes, I’d use them so,
That Heaven’s vault should crack: she’s gone for ever.
I know when one is dead, and when one lives,
She’s dead as earth.
King Lear, 5.3.262–266

Lavinia
Titus:
Die, die, Lavinia and thy shame with thee,
And with thy shame thy Father’s sorrow die.
 [Titus kills his daughter Lavinia]
Saturninus:
What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind? 
Titus:
Kill’d her for whom my tears have made me blind.
Titus Andronicus, 5.3.46–49
Lavinia, who has been 
brutally ravished 
and mutilated 
by Tamora’s sons, 
willingly goes 
 to her father’s arms 
to die.

Diana, the Moon Goddess
There were three common goddesses of the moon in the later 
myths: Diana (also known as Artemis), Phoebe (also known 
as Selene), and Hecate. Their realms eventually separated 
to allow Diana as the moon goddess on earth, Phoebe in the 
heavens, and Hecate in the underworld. Shakespeare brings 
all of these aspects into the play, recognizing the three-fold 
unity of Diana.
Four days will quickly steep themselves in nights:
Four nights will quickly dream away the time:
And then the Moon, like to a silver bow,
Now bent in heaven, shall behold the night
Of our solemnities.
Hippolyta, 1.1.7–11
 
The moon is the focus of the first eleven lines of the play, and Hippolyta, 
Queen of the Amazons, describes it “like to a silver bow, now bent 
in heaven.” Diana is usually portrayed carrying a bow and a quiver 
of arrows, accompanied by a dog or a deer. The bow is important to 
Hippolyta both as a warrior and as a worshipper of Diana, a champion 
of Amazon women. This thin crescent moon is often seen on statues of 
looks almost 
Diana, where she wears the upturned crescent as a crown; it 
like horns. There is another reference to this crown in the last act of 
the play, when Moonshine speaks of the hornèd moon, and Demetrius 
replies that he should have worn the horns on his head.
To morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
Her silver visage, in the wat’ry glass,
Decking with liquid pearl, the bladed grass
(A time that Lovers’ flights doth still conceal)
Through Athens’ gates, have we devised to steal.
Lysander, 1.1.
watery 
Phoebe is the Moon who sees her silver image in the lake, “the 
glass” (a “glass” is a mirror), and it is she who creates the dew, “the liquid 
pearl.” Her lake is identified in ancient stories as Nemi Lake, about 
twenty miles south of Rome, and referred to by poets as “Diana’s Mirror.”
In ancient stories, Phoebe is often conflated with Selene who loved the 
handsome shepherd Endymion and kept him asleep in a cave where 
she visited him nightly. Thus Shakespeare brings in not only the Moon 
goddess by other names, but also another pair of lovers. 
In the first scene, we are told that Lysander sang 
love songs to Hermia in the moonlight, and a 
few lines later Theseus threatens Hermia wtih 
virginity and “chanting faint hymns to the cold 
fruitless moon” in a cloister. One of Diana’s roles 
is as a virgin, sworn to never marry, which is 
why the vivacious Hermia faces a potential life 
of austerity at “Diana’s altar.”

Diana, the Woodland Goddess
Diana is also the goddess of the woodlands and forest. Titania, Queen 
of the Fairies, describes the trouble in the countryside caused by the 
quarrel between the fairy king and queen which has angered Diana. 
Therefore the Moon (the governess of floods)
Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
That Rheumatic diseases do abound.
And through this distemperature, we see
The seasons alter; hoary-headed frosts
Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson Rose,
And on old Hyem’s thin and Icy crown,
An odorous Chaplet of sweet Summer buds
Is as in mock’ry set. The Spring, the Summer,
The childing Autumn, angry Winter change
Their wonted Liveries, and the mazèd world,
By their increase, now knows not which is which;
And this same progeny of evils,
Comes from our debate, from our dissension,
We are their parents and original.
Titania, 2.1.
There are interesting parallels between Diana, goddess of the woodlands 
with her nymphs, and Titania with her “moonlight revels” and fairies.
The flower that Oberon uses to enchant the eyes of Titania, Lysander, and 
Demetrius was created when Cupid shot his arrow at a virgin (possibly a 
reference to Queen Elizabeth) but the watery beams of Diana’s moon put 
out the “fiery shaft” (the golden tip of Cupid’s arrow). The arrow missed 
the virgin, but landed on a flower. 
That very time I say (but thou couldst not)
Flying between the cold Moon and the earth,
Cupid all arm’d; a certain aim he took
At a fair Vestal, thronèd by the West,
And loos’d his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts,
But, I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft
Quenched in the chaste beams of the wat’ry Moon;
And the imperial Vot’ress passèd on,
In maiden meditation, fancy free.
Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.
It fell upon a little western flower;
Before, milk-white; now purple with love’s wound,
And maidens call it, Love-in-idleness.
Fetch me that flower; the herb I show’d thee once,
The juice of it, on sleeping eye-lids laid,
Will make or man or woman madly dote
Upon the next live creature that it sees.
Oberon, 2.1.

The wildest hath not such a heart as you;
Run when you will, the story shall be chang’d:
Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase;
The Dove pursues the Griffin, the mild Hind
Makes speed to catch the Tiger.
Helena, 2.1.
Helena complains when Demetrius runs away from her that it is the 
opposite of the natural way in the world, where the boy is supposed to 
chase the girl, such as when Apollo chased Daphne (to rape her) and the 
gods turned her into a laurel tree. Apollo is Diana’s twin brother. 
There is another reference to Diana’s brother, who in later stories was 
known as the sun god:
I’ll believe as soon
This whole earth may be bored, and that the Moon
May through the Center creep, and so displease
Her brother’s noontide, with th’ Antipodes.
Hermia, 3.2.
This is quite an amazing image—boring a hole through the center of 
the earth so Diana, the moon, can creep through the hole and upset her 
brother Apollo/Phoebus, the sun, in his noon time on the other side of 
the earth, the Antipodes (which literally means opposite feet).
Diana, as Sister
My Fairy Lord, this must be done with haste,
For night-swift Dragons cut the Clouds full fast,
And yonder shines Aurora’s harbinger,
At whose approach Ghosts wand’ring here and there,
Troop home to Church-yards; damnèd spirits all . . .
Puck, 3.2
Aurora is the goddess of the Morning, and she is sister to Diana and 
Apollo. The triple-goddess Diana/Hecate/Phoebe drags the Night across 
the sky in a chariot pulled by dragons, thus “night-swift dragons” are 
almost finished with their task and the dawn approaches (the harbinger 
of the dawn is Venus, the morning star).  
I, with the Morning’s love have oft made sport,
And like a Forester, the groves may tread,
Even till the Eastern gate all fiery red,
Opening on Neptune, with fair blessèd beams,
Turns into yellow gold, his salt green streams. 
Oberon, 3.2
Oberon tells us that he has often had good times with the lover of 
Morning/Aurora (also known as Eos); her lover was Cephalus, whom she 
kidnapped while he was hunting. Aurora eventually returned him to the 
woman he really loved, Procris. Shakespeare mentions Cephalus and 
Procris again in Act 5 (see page XX).

Diana, the Hunter
Diana, with her spear and quiver and bow, with
her dog or deer, was also the goddess of the hunt, 
so naturally there is a hunting scene in this play.
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,
When in a wood of Crete they bayed the Bear
With hounds of Sparta; never did I hear
Such gallant chiding. For besides the groves,
The skies, the fountains, every region near,
Seem all one mutual cry. I never heard
So musical a discord, such sweet thunder. 
Hippolyta, 4.1.
It is surely not an accident that Hippolyta talks of the dogs
baying the bear just a dozen lines before they find the lovers
asleep on the ground, in that earlier in the play Helena had
claimed she was “as ugly as a bear,” and the other three did
bay at her and make her run from them. 
Cadmus, who founded Thebes, could never have been in
the company of Hercules and Hippolyta, which Shakespeare
knew, so we should wonder why his name is included. See
page XX.

Forests are sacred to Diana, and especially oak
trees. There cannot be a play so filled with Diana
that does not mention the oak.
And meet me in the Palace Wood, a mile
without the Town, by Moon-light, there we will 
rehearse. . . . At the Duke’s Oak we meet.
Quince, 1.2.
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
So flew’d, so sanded, and their heads are hung
With ears that sweep away the morning dew,
Crook kneed, and dew-lapt, like Thessalian Bulls,
Slow in pursuit, but match’d in mouth like bells,
Each under each. A cry more tuneable
Was never hallowed to, nor cheer’d with horn,
In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly;
Theseus, 4.1.
Hippolyta (on the opposite page) praises the hounds of Sparta, and
Theseus brags that his hounds are also bred of “the Spartan kind” and
their musical baying is better than that of hounds from Crete or Sparta. 
When Diana was accidentally seen by Actaeon the young hunter while
she was bathing, she turned him into a stag and it was his own hounds
of Crete and Sparta that tore him to pieces. “Their baying filled the sky,”
writes Ovid. Actaeon is the grandson of Cadmus, whom Hippolyta just
mentioned.

Diana, the Fertility Goddess
The name of Titania, Queen of the Fairies, comes from Ovid, the ancient 
Roman poet, who sometimes calls Diana by the name of Titania. Diana 
is the goddess of fertility and childbirth, which is why Titania is so 
concerned with the welfare of the child of her votaress. Diana is a midwife 
and protects childbirth to make sure the human race regenerates. 
As Titania leads Bottom to her bower, she says:
The Moon me-thinks, looks with a watery eye,
And when she weeps, weep every little flower,
Lamenting some enforcèd chastity.
Titania, 3.1
This quotation is often interpreted to mean that Diana is lamenting a 
rape, a young woman whose virginity is forced upon. But Diana, although 
a virgin herself, firmly believes in procreation. Here Diana/the Moon, 
laments when someone has chastity enforced upon her, a reference to 
Hermia at the beginning of the play.
His mother was a Vot’ress of my Order,
And in the spicèd Indian air, by night
Full often hath she gossipt by my side,
And sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands,
Marking th’embarkèd traders on the flood,
When we have laught to see the sails conceive,
And grow big bellied with the wanton wind:
Which she with pretty and with swimming gait,
Following (her womb then rich with my young squire)
Would imitate, and sail upon the Land,
To fetch me trifles, and return again,
As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
But she being mortal, of that boy did die,
And for her sake I do rear up her boy,
And for her sake I will not part with him.
Titania, 2.1.
It is Diana’s job to bless men and women with 
offspring, as Titania does at the end of the play.*
Now until the break of day,
Through this house each Fairy stray.
To the best Bride-bed will we,
Which by us shall blessèd be:
And the issue there create,
Ever shall be fortunate.
Titania, 5.1.
*Modern editors often give this speech (or song) to 
Oberon, although in the First Folio it is Titania who
gives this blessing.

The Veiled Lovers
In addition to the  motif of Diana in all her forms, Shakespeare mentions 
a number of mythological lovers in a very subtle manner. Is there a 
message to be found amongst these lovers? Why did Shakespeare choose 
to mention these particular couples?
Theseus is the legendary or perhaps mythical co-founder and king of 
Athens around 1230 BCE. Shakespeare knows the background of Theseus 
and his women from the ancient stories, and apparently wants us to 
recognize it as well. Oberon says to Titania:
How canst thou thus for shame Titania,
Glance at my credit vvith Hippolita?
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
From Peregenia, whom he ravishèd?
And make him with fair Aegle break his faith
With Ariadne, and Atiopa?
Oberon, 2.1.
This is a reference to the tales in which Ariadne of Minos betrays her 
father to help Theseus escape the minotaur; she leaves her father to run 
off with Theseus, who promptly abandons Ariadne for the nymph Aegle. 
father while 
Apparently that didn’t last long. Theseus murders Perigenia’s 
she hides in an asparagus patch, then rapes her and when she has a 
child, marries her off to someone else and runs off with Titania. He then 
battles Antiopa (another name for Hippolyta, or perhaps Hippolyta’s 
little sister), whom he kidnaps and marries, but after their child is born, 
he abandons Antiopa/Hippolyta for Phaedra (Ariadne’s little sister), 
whom he also marries. 
In Act 1, Lysander describes how “the course of true love never did run smooth”:
 Or if there were a sympathy in choice,
War, death, or sickness, did lay siege to it;
Making it momentary, as a sound,
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream  .  .  .
So quick bright things come to confusion.
Hermia agrees: 
If then true Lovers have been ever crossed,
It stands as an edict in destiny.
And Shakespeare fills the play with subtle references to crossed lovers:
Cadmus (Act 4.1) was led to the place where he founded Thebes by a calf with a 
half moon tattoo; he immediately built a temple to the moon goddess. Cadmus 
was given Harmonia as a wife, and when he was later turned into a serpent, his 
wife, watching, begged to share his fate (she did). 
In the same sentence where Hippolyta mentions Cadmus, she also mentions 
Hercules. Hercules also died as the result of a gift from his wife, a gift she was 
craftily given by the Centaur who tried to rape her and whom Hercules killed. 
When she discovered that she had unwittingly caused her husband’s death, 
she killed herself. 
Bottom mentions the true love of “Shafalus and Procrus,” a mistake for 
Cephalus and Procris, devoted lovers. Cephalus accidentally kills Procris with 
a magical spear that she had given him, then she kills herself with the same 
weapon.
Bottom also refers to the lovers Helen and Limander, a mistake for Hero and 
Leander (with a subtle undercurrent of Helena and Lysander). Leander swam 
the Hellespont (a strait in Turkey now called the Dardanelles) every night to be 
with Hero, led by the lamp she lit. One night she fell asleep and didn’t light the 
lamp, Leander drowned, and Hero killed herself. 
12
13
Pyramus and Thisbe are the focus of the play within the play. Both
Pyramus and Thisbe kill themselves: he, believing she has been eaten by
a lion, stabs himself; when Thisbe sees him dead, she stabs herself.
In Act I, Hermia swears by Cupid’s bow (Cupid is a child and blind, so
he shoots his arrows indiscriminately, not a dependable thing to swear
by). Hermia also swears “by that fire, which burned the Carthage queen, 
when the false Trojan under sail was seen.” This is a reference to Dido, 
Queen of Carthage, who threw herself on a funeral pyre when her lover, 
Aeneas, abandoned her by sailing away. 
In Act 5, Theseus considers several options for a play to “abridge” the
wait until bedtime. This is one of the options:
“The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.”
That is an old device; and it was played
When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
Theseus, 5.1.
In this story, the “tipsy Bacchanals” are drunken women honoring the god
Bacchus. The Thracian singer is Orpheus, whose music could move rocks
and calm beasts. Orpheus was mourning the loss of his beloved wife and
so refused to join in the tipsy orgy, thus the women tore him to pieces and
sent his head floating down the river, still singing.
The fairies sing a lullaby in which they mention Philomela:
Philomel with melody,
Sing in our sweet Lullaby.
Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby.
Fairies, 2.2
Philomela, whose name means “love song,” was raped by her
brother-in-law, who then cut out her tongue so she couldn’t 
tell anyone. The gods turned her into a nightingale.
Even Titania’s reference to Corin and Phillida, which have
come to be seen as generic names of shepherds, were
immortalized in 1557 in a short poem of unrequited love.
Perhaps the collection of star-crossed and devastated lovers
that Shakespeare has chosen to sprinkle throughout the play
is merely a coincidental occurrence. Or perhaps we should
trust the writer and seek to puzzle out the message.

Introduction
I do everything in InDesign—letters to my 102-year-old Grandmother, recipes 
for friends, play lists for my Shakespeare reading groups, signage for events, 
dissertations for school. When I write a book, I write it directly in InDesign.
Booklets, banners, envelopes, door hangers, posters, flyers, postcards, 
business cards and letterhead, bookmarks, greeting cards, menus, note 
pads, rack cards, table tents, brochures, catalogs, newsletters, bookplates, 
books, packaging, tickets, labels . . . the possibilities are endless! And with 
the remarkable online printing sites where you can get professional color 
printing for unbelievable prices, it is immensely useful to know the basics of 
graphic design and how to use a page layout application such as InDesign. 
Or if you want to create product such as coffee mugs, t-shirts, hats, one-off 
posters, dog clothes, postage stamps, or even jewelry boxes, you can create 
and upload files to sites such as CafePress.com or Zazzle.com, then buy them 
for yourself or make them available to the public. Such a world we live in! 
I have to assume you are motivated, so this book involves discovery and 
exploration. The basics are here, but I fully expect you to take the basics 
and run with them! This is not a manual, so it’s up to you to explore settings 
you haven’t worked with before, menu items that aren’t mentioned in this 
book, etc. My hope is that you will feel confident, after following the tasks 
in this book, to take off on your own. Don’t forget the Help files!
And if you plan to use Adobe’s new web design application (as I write this 
book, the application is called Muse), you’ll have a head start in designing 
web pages with it because it is very similar to InDesign.
So you see, all sorts of new worlds open up once you are adept at using a 
great tool for design! Go design something!

SECTION  I
So . . .
This section introduces you to the 
basics of working in InDesign, before 
getting to text frames and graphics. 
If you take the time to work through 
the few exercises in this section, you’ll 
feel much more confident when you 
launch into any project. 
Because InDesign is an advanced 
application, I expect that you know 
how to use your mouse and the 
windows; the difference between a 
single click and a double click; how 
to find, open, and save files; how to 
access contextual menus (right-click 
or Control-click on a Mac); and how 
to use your computer in general. But 
you probably know all those things 
already or you wouldn’t be jumping 
into InDesign! 

Type  
is one of the most  
eloquent means of expression  
in every epoch of style.  
Next to architecture,  
it gives the most  
characteristic portrait of a period  
and the most severe testimony  
of a nation’s  
intellectual status.
Peter Behrens 
architect and designer, 1868–1940

Introduction  
to InDesign
The general way to use InDesign is to place 
some graphics on the page, get some text 
on the page, and design them into a piece. 
Putting the graphics and text on the page is 
the easy part—the fine-tuning is what takes 
time to master. This book merely gets you 
started in the right direction.
This primary chapter introduces you to a few 
of the background basics that you’ll use in 
every project. It’s not very exciting, but it’s 
useful, and if it is useful, it is beautiful.

If there is a page format you 
use regularly, such as tabloid 
size, 24 pages, 6 columns, etc., 
select your options and then 
click “Save Preset….” Give 
the preset a name. From 
then on, it will appear in the 
“Document Preset” menu at 
the top of this dialog box. 
When you need to set a bleed
(where elements or color 
extend past the page size) or  
a slug (space in which to write 
notes that won’t print), click 
“More Options.”
When the icon is locked,  all the fields 
will automatically change to match a 
number you enter in any one of them.
The measurement 
system in most fields 
picks up whatever 
increments the rulers 
on the page are 
using at the moment.   
See page 20.
Document setup
As in any other program, to create a new document you go to the File menu 
and choose “New.” In InDesign, you have a choice of creating a new Document 
(shown below), a Book (a file for managing individual chapter files in a book), 
or a Library (for easy access to items you use often; see page 196). If you don’t 
have a new, blank document open yet, follow the steps below.
	
Make a new document
Any settings you make while creating a new document can always be 
changed, so don’t worry too much about choosing the wrong thing.
1 From the File menu, choose “New,” then “Document.” 
2 In the “Intent” option, make sure “Print” is chosen. 
3 Let’s make several pages to play on—enter 2 or 3 in the “Number  
of Pages” field.
4 If there’s a check in the box for “Facing Pages,” uncheck it.
5 Choose the “Page Size” option of “Letter,” with a portrait (tall) 
“Orientation.”
6 If the margins are 3p0 or .5 in. all the way around, leave them like that 
(or enter those numbers, if not).  
7 Click ok. You should now have a single, untitled, blank page  
on the screen, as shown opposite. 
8 Save this document into the folder of your choice, just as you  
do with all your other documents.

You can also choose a different 
workspace from this menu   
(if the Application bar is showing). 
Control panel. 
See page 9.
Application bar.
Get to know the workspace
InDesign opens your document in a workspace, as shown below. A workspace 
determines which panels are open for you and where they are placed, your 
ruler settings, what is visible in the Control panel, etc. You can customize the 
workspace endlessly and save various workspaces for different sorts of projects. 
For now, we’re going to use the workspace that InDesign has already created, 
called “Essentials.” If that’s not what you see at the moment, go to the 
Window menu at the top of the screen, choose “Workspace,” and then choose 
“Essentials.” It will look like the screen below.
Delete the Application bar: The Application bar takes up a lot of room on the 
screen. Everything in the bar can be accessed from a menu or the Tools panel. If 
you want to get rid of it, go to the Window menu and uncheck “Application bar.”
When you’re familiar with InDesign and have figured out how you like to arrange 
the tools and panels on your screen, you can save your own arrangement: Go 
to the Window menu, the “Workspace” command, choose “New Workspace,” 
and give it a name. Whenever your panels get all messy, choose your workspace 
again and all will be returned to how you like it.

The panels
It can make you crazy if you don’t understand how the panels work. If you’re 
proficient in Photoshop or Illustrator, you are probably comfortable working 
with panels, so skip this section. If you’ve never worked with them before, take 
a few minutes to familiarize yourself because you’re going to be working with 
panels every minute in InDesign. 
To open panels if they’re not already on the screen, get them from the Window 
menu or the Type menu. Learn their keyboard shortcuts so you can open 
them quickly.  
	
Open the docked panels on the side of the screen
If you just opened a document and are using the Essentials workspace, you 
have several panels docked at the side of your screen (Mac) or application 
frame (PC). Docking the panels is a good option if you’re working on a very 
small screen or just want to keep everything obsessively tidy.
To open a docked panel, just single-click on its name. 
Each of these is a 
panel, docked to the 
side of the screen. 
You can dock panels 
to either side. 
These dividers indicate 
panels that have been 
grouped together. 
Below is the Stroke panel. 
Because it was grouped with 
the Color panel, they both 
pop out together.
Click a panel name 
to open or close 
that panel.
Tear off a panel so you can exper-
iment with it in the tasks on the 
next few pages. Just grab its title 
tab, drag it off to the side, and drop 
it on the window. It looks like this: 
To dock a panel to the side, grab it by its title tab and drag it toward the 
edge. When it gets within a few pixels, the panel snaps to the edge. You can 
dock an open panel, like the Stroke panel above, or collapse it as shown on 
the opposite page and then dock it.

  1 :  i n t r o d u c t i o n  t o  i n d e s i g n

Every panel has a menu;  
click the hash marks to display it.
Double-click in this space to 
roll a panel up or expand it.
Click the close button 
to close the panel.
Click this to 
cycle through 
displaying more 
or fewer options.
Click these tiny triangles to collapse the panel. 
Once it is collapsed, as shown to the far left, 
click its name to show the panel again, as  
shown here.
Once the panel is open, it will collapse itself as 
soon as you click on another collapsed panel. 
This saves you a thousand clicks a day. 
What will really save you time and frustration 
is a big monitor so you don’t have to open and 
close panels every few seconds. 
This is the 
collapsed panel. 
You can drag the 
left or right edge 
to resize it even 
smaller:
	
Play with a typical panel
Use the Stroke panel shown on the opposite page, or open another, such as 
the Character panel, which you can open from the Type menu. Read each 
of the captions below and follow their directions until you can click on 
something and know what to expect.

The Transform panel is being 
stacked at the bottom of the 
Swatches panel. You can stack a 
panel on top of another, beneath 
another, insert it between two 
other stacked panels, or attach 
them at the sides. 
Notice the blue bar—this is 
your visual clue that you’ve 
connected the two. 
This is the stack. Drag the top 
bar to move the whole stack.
Drag the top part of any panel 
into the top part of any other 
panel. Watch for this blue border 
around the entire panel! When 
you see the blue border, let go. 
This panel is being added 
to an existing group.
	
Group and ungroup panels
Panels can be grouped together to save space on your screen. You can move 
the group around, collapse it, dock it, etc. When a panel is grouped, you 
have to click on its tab bar (or double-click in the empty space to the right 
of the tab) to see the panel.
	
Stack and unstack panels
If you have room on your screen to keep your most-used panels open and 
available, stack them. To stack panels, drag one on top of another. When 
you see a blue bar across the top, bottom, or either side (whichever end you 
want the panel to stack onto), let go, as shown on the top of the opposite 
page. To unstack a panel, drag its title tab away and drop it on the window. 
The trick to grouping a panel is to make sure when you drag it into the 
collection, the blue bar appears around the entire group, as shown below, 
and not just a blue bar at the top or the bottom. To ungroup, drag a title 
tab away and drop it on the window. 
This is a collapsed 
group. Work with it 
as explained on the 
previous page. 
This is a group of panels I use frequently, but not 
often enough to keep them stacked on my screen.

The Tools panel
The Tools panel might be familiar to you from other applications. In InDesign, 
you can change its shape and move it, but you can’t add or delete tools from 
it. The Tools panel, like the Control panel, cannot be grouped, stacked, nor 
docked on the side.  
If the Tools panel is not showing, choose it from the Window menu. 
Black Selection tool.
White Direct Selection tool (select 
points, plus graphics within frames).
Type tool.
Line tool.
Shape tools. 
Zoom tool.
A tiny triangle in the corner indicates there 
is more than one tool in that spot. Press-and-
hold (don’t click) your pointer on the existing 
tool to display and choose the other tools. 
Click these tiny arrows to cycle the Tools panel 
from a vertical one-row column to a horizontal 
row to a vertical two-row column. 
This is what the Control panel looks like when a shape is selected. 
By the way, this is a 
hugely useful button;   
see pages 150, 151, 155.
The Control panel
The Control panel is that area across the top of your window, just below the 
menu commands. Options in the Control panel change depending on what is 
selected in the document. For instance, if your insertion point is flashing in text, 
you’ll see text options in the Control panel; if you use the black Selection Tool to 
select a graphic object, you’ll see different options for manipulating the graphic.
This means that you should not try looking for an option or specification in 
the Control panel until after you have selected the item you want to affect!
There is an overwhelming collection of tiny little icons in the Control panel. 
Keep checking the tool tips, as shown below (hover over an icon and the tool 
tip appears). As you learn InDesign, more and more of the icon buttons will 
become useful to you in your daily creativity. 
tip: For information on every tool, go to the Window 
menu and choose Utilities > Tool Hints. Click on a 
tool in the Tools bar for an explanation of that item. 
The letter you see is the key
you can press to select that tool 
(as long as you’re not currently 
typing with the Text tool!).

Hide or show the rulers
You will be using the rulers constantly for pulling out guides and for setting 
measurements in formatting fields. Whichever measurement system the ruler 
displays becomes the measurement system in the panels and dialog boxes. 
Mostly, you will be changing the rulers back and forth between inches and 
picas (see page 20 about picas)—maybe you don’t think so yet, but trust me, 
you will. So learn this nifty shortcut for changing the measurement now. 
	
Change the ruler settings
1 If the rulers aren’t showing: From the View menu, choose “Show Rulers.”
2 Right-click on the horizontal ruler across the top of the window  
or the vertical ruler down the side.
3 In the contextual menu that appears, choose a measurement 
increment. (For the future, also note the other options in this 
contextual menu!) 
	
Using ruler guides on the page
1 Make sure the rulers are showing, as in Step 1, above.
2 Simply press the cursor in the ruler and drag onto the page.
3 To move a ruler guide, get the black Selection tool, press on it  
and drag it.
4 To remove guides, get the black Selection tool, click on a guide,  
then hit Delete or Backspace. Also, see the options in “Grids & 
Guides” from the View menu—you can hide the guides, lock them, 
and delete all at once.
5 When “Snap to Guides” is turned on (from the “Grids & Guides” 
options mentioned in Step 6), objects will jump to the nearest guide 
when you drag close to it. It’s kind of freaky because you can actually 
feel the guide pull the graphic to it and then bump into it.
6 To create a horizontal guide while dragging a vertical one, or  
to create a vertical guide while dragging a horizontal one,  
hold down the Option key (PC: Alt key) while dragging. 
7 To create a guide across a double-page spread, hold down the 
Command key (PC: Control key) and drag the ruler. 
8 To set the same guides on all the pages of a document, put them  
on the Master Pages; see pages 14–15.

  1 :  i n t r o d u c t i o n  t o  i n d e s i g n
11
Create and hide or show the guides
If you didn’t change the default settings when you created your page at the 
beginning of this chapter, you should see margin guidelines a half inch from 
the edges of the page. These guides do not print, nor do they prevent you from 
doing anything—they are there only to show you the margins you set up when 
you created the document. They are for you to design around. 
The menu command to hide, show, and lock the guides is in the View menu, 
under “Grids & Guides.” Learn the keyboard shortcut to hide and show the 
guides because you will be constantly turning them off and on.
Smart Guides
Smart Guides appear automatically to help you line things up. If they’re turned 
on, you’ll see green guides showing up all the time. They can show you when 
an element is placed the same distance between another element, when frame 
edges are aligned, when centers of items are aligned, and more. 
Smart Guides are very handy, but they sometimes make it difficult to place a 
guideline or an element in an exact position because the Smart Guides want 
to take over. So if you have trouble with a guide or item jerking away from the 
place where you want to put it, turn off Smart Guides (View > Grids & Guides). 
Learn the keyboard shortcut so you can do it instantly whenever you want. 
When I moved this box, the green Smart 
Guides appeared to show me not only 
when it was aligned horizontally with the 
other two images, but when the distance 
between the green box and the yellow 
box was the same as between the orange 
and the yellow one. 
tip: If you hit the Tab key (not while you’re typing), all the panels 
and the rulers disappear so all that’s left is the window. This is a 
great way to remove all the clutter so you can see your page.  
This also might happen accidentally, so don’t freak out—just tap 
the Tab key again to bring everything back.

Know your defaults 
As you type in InDesign or create shapes, the text appears with a font and 
size and color, and shapes appear with a stroke (a border) and a fill inside the 
shape. They automatically appear with whatever has been set as the defaults, 
and then you change the text or the shape to what you want. 
But that wastes a lot of time, changing things every time you create them. So 
it’s really important to set your own defaults. It’s this easy: Choose what you 
want to see before you create it. 
That is, if you plan to create a lot of type in 11-point purple Garamond text, 
then first make sure nothing is selected. Either get the black Selection tool and 
click on an empty space, or go to the Edit menu and choose “Deselect All” 
(learn the keyboard shortcut so you can do it quickly whenever you want). 
Now, while nothing is selected, choose 11-point Garamond text and the color 
purple from the menus or the panels. 
Now when you type (as explained in Chapter 2), it will always be in 11-point 
Garamond purple until you change the defaults again. 
Keep this in mind as you work in InDesign. 
If you want to draw seven circles, all with a blue fill (the inside color) and a 
dotted line stroke (the border) that is 5 points wide, first make sure nothing 
is selected, then choose those specifications, and then get the Ellipse tool and 
draw your seven circles. 
This will create defaults for the document that you are working in. 
But you can also create application defaults for all documents that you open 
from here on out. Just open InDesign, but do not open a document. Now 
choose what you want from the menus and the Preferences (Preferences are in 
the InDesign menu). Anything you can choose from a menu or the Preferences 
pane becomes the default for every new document you open. 
This might not seem so important right now, but keep it in mind. The day 
will come when you’ll say, “Aha! I want to set this as an application default!” 
And you will know exactly what to do.

All sorts of visual clues
Over the years you have become accustomed to noticing the tiny changes in 
a cursor or items on the page (like red dots under text) that give you clues 
about what is going on. Heighten that awareness while working in InDesign.
The cursors change constantly while you’re using them—the black Selection 
tool cursor changes when it’s near the corner of a frame or on a handle or 
inside a selected object, etc. The Eyedropper tool flips back and forth, the 
white Selection tool adds tiny symbols to itself, and more. Every cursor change 
indicates something that tool can do specifically because it is in that position 
(hovering over a handle, for instance). Throughout the book I will call your 
attention to them, but there’s not room to mention them all! Keep a lookout. 
Be conscious.
Tool tips abound. Hover any tool over fields and icons in the panel, and a tool 
tip appears to tell you what that item is for. This is hugely useful. 
Hover the tip of your pointer over any 
item in a panel to display the tool tip 
that tells you what that item does.
Every graphic and every piece of text is contained within a frame. Every 
frame has eight handles (one on each corner and each side), plus several other 
gadgets, as shown below. When a cursor is positioned on one of these handles 
or gadgets, it changes to give you a visual clue that tells you something will 
happen if you were to press-and-drag. Watch for these! 
I suggest you turn off some of these gadgets (hide them) until you need to 
use them; if you don’t, weird things happen that you won’t know how to fix. 
To turn them off, from the View menu, choose “Extras” and hide the items.
Notice the donut in the middle of the 
frame. This is the Content Grabber;  
you can tell because the cursor has turned 
into a grabber hand. See page 146.
This is the Live Corners control, 
which allows you to adjust the 
corners. See page 139.
When the Selection tool cursor is near a 
corner, it turns into a curved arrow; if you 
drag at that point, it rotates the frame.
This is the Anchored Object control, which lets you attach any 
frame to a text frame so it flows along with the text—drag this 
into text. When anchored, this square becomes an anchor (see 
page 219); delete the anchor to unattach the frame from the text.

Master pages
When you create a document with more than one page, typically there are 
items you want to put on all the pages, such as page numbers, or perhaps a 
header or a logo. Every document has “Master Pages” built into it, which is 
where you put items that you want to appear on every page. At any point, you 
can override any item to remove it from a particular page, so don’t think you 
are stuck with whatever you put there. 
There is lots you can do with master pages, so I hope this introduction will 
lead you to discovering more. Check out the panel options and the Help files. 
	
Set up a document and use master pages
1 Create a new document, and in the “New Document” dialog  
(as shown on page 4), make it 8 pages, letter sized, portrait, and  
make sure to check the box for “Facing Pages.”
2 When “Facing Pages” is checked, the “Margins” change so you can set 
a different inside margin from the outside, as shown below. Typically 
the margin on the inside is larger to allow for the binding on that 
edge, whether it be a book or a stapled booklet or a bound report.
 
 To set different measurements for the various margins, click the lock 
icon so it turns into a broken lock icon, as shown. 
 
 If the measurement system is something you don’t know what to do 
with, such as points and picas, you can enter a number in inches—
just type the letter i after the number of inches. For instance, enter 
.75i if you want a three-quarter–inch margin. InDesign will automati-
cally translate it into the current measurement system (see page 10).
When using facing pages, you can 
set the inside margin separately 
from the outside. 
3 You can change the settings at any time; for now, click ok.
4 Your document opens and you only see one page, even though you 
chose facing pages! That’s because odd-numbered pages, such as page 1, 
are always on the right-hand side. Think of a book—the first page 
is a single page, then you turn the page and you see the double-page 
spread, the facing pages (they face each other). 
So turn the page of your document: Choose a page from the page field 
in the bottom-left corner of the window, or open the Pages panel from 
the Window menu and double-click the page numbers. 

  1 :  i n t r o d u c t i o n  t o  i n d e s i g n
15
Explore the options in the 
panel menu.
To go to the 
master pages, 
double-click here.
Important: When choosing actions from the 
panel menu, the action applies to the page 
that is selected in the panel window, not to 
the page you are looking at on the screen!
Double-click a page icon to  
center that page on the screen.
Double-click the page numbers  
to center the spread on the screen. 
5 Go to the master page spread: Choose “A-Document Master” from 
the page menu in the bottom-left corner of the window, or double-
click on the master page icon in the Pages panel, as shown above.
6 On this master page spread, you can draw or place any graphic on 
these pages that you want to appear on all pages in the document.
 
 You can drag in guidelines for placement, as explained on page 10.
 
 You can change the margins and add columns: From the Layout 
menu, choose “Margins and Columns….”
 
 You can create text frames for headers and footers (see Chapter 2 
about text frames). To create automatic page numbers:
  
Get the Type tool. Press-and-drag diagonally downward to the right 
to create a small text frame. From the Type menu, choose “Insert 
Special Character,” then “Markers,” then “Current Page Number.” 
  
Now get the black Selection tool. Hold down the Option key 
(PC: Alt key), and with the Selection tool, press-and-drag that text 
frame to the opposite page. 
7 Go to your document page, as described in the callout above (double-
click a page icon in the Pages panel). Flip through the pages on the 
screen and you’ll see that they are automatically numbered, and any 
margins or columns you added are shown on every page. Notice that 
on document pages, you cannot select anything that was placed on a 
master page. You can, however, “Hide Master Items” from the panel 
menu. If you choose to “Override All Master Page Items,” you can 
select individual master items, then move, change, or delete them.

If everything goes goofy
If you or someone else has been playing with defaults and now every time 
you try to do something, goofy things happen, you might want to reset all the 
defaults back to the factory settings and start over. 
	
Reset all defaults
1 Quit InDesign, if it’s open.
2 Hold down all these keys: 
 
  Mac: Shift Option Command Control
 
  
PC: 
Shift Ctrl Alt 
3 With those keys held down, open InDesign. 
4 When you see the message asking if you want to delete  
the preference files, click “Yes.”
Try this!
Discover how to zoom in and out of your page (check the View menu). Practice 
doing it and using the keyboard shortcuts until you can resize the page easily. 
InDesign zooms in on whatever is selected on the page. 
Also experiment with the Zoom tool from the Tools panel—press-and-drag 
with the tool to zoom into exactly the spot you want. Then use the keyboard 
shortcut to fit the page back into the window. 
Set up the panels you think you will want to use—stack them and dock them 
and group them as you like. Make a workspace, as explained on page 5, and 
give it your name so you can choose it whenever you want. Experiment with 
changing the workspaces: Choose various setups from the Window > Workspace 
menu. Then carry on to the next chapter!
tip: Best keyboard shortcut: While working in InDesign, use the 
W key to see a preview of your page without all the ruler guides, 
frame guides, etc. Hit W again to show everything. (The only trick 
is that you can’t use this shortcut if you’re typing!) You can also 
click the Preview icon at the bottom of the Tools panel to hide and 
show the preview.

SECTION  II
Graphic design is about text. If there is no 
text on the page, it’s not graphic design—
it’s art. The secret to professional-looking 
graphic design is knowing how to format that 
text. Not just choosing a font and making it 
bold or italic, but knowing how to space the 
text properly, use tabs and indents, organize 
information with tables, etc.
And part of working professionally is 
working efficiently, so in this section you’ll 
learn how to use style sheets and how 
to take advantage of the defaults so you 
don’t waste time changing your formatting 
constantly.
So although this isn’t the sexiest section, 
knowing all these things will make the 
difference between mediocre graphic  
design and masterful graphic design.

with

The modern typographer  
must have the capacity  
for taking great pains  
with seemingly  
unimportant detail.  
To her, one typographic point  
must be as important  
as one inch,  
and she must  
harden her heart  
against the accusation  
of being too fussy.
Hans Schmoller, typographer, 1916–1985

2
One of the most important things to learn in 
InDesign is how to control the text frames, 
which is completely different from anything 
you’ve experienced in a word processor. It’s 
very empowering. Being able to pick up the 
text in a neat little package and move it and 
set it down anywhere you want—amazing. 
Roll it up, widen the columns, thread the copy 
throughout the pages, separate headlines from 
the body, choose background colors—oh the 
things you can do.
And since graphic design is mostly text, 
knowing how to control your text frames  
is also a really important feature.

Get used to points and picas
When working with text, you really need to get used to working with points 
and picas. You’re already familiar and comfortable with point sizes of type 
because you’ve been choosing font sizes for years in all your other applications. 
So you have a pretty good idea of how big 12 points is, and 12 points is one 
pica. There are 6 picas in one inch. Which of course makes 72 points per inch. 
And that’s all there is to it. 
12 points = 1 pica
6 picas = 1 inch
72 points = 1 inch
The reason it’s better to use a measuring system of points and picas when 
working with type is because the incremental units are small and thus easier 
to work with. You might want to add half of a point to the leading value (the 
space between the lines), or use a type size of 10.3 because 10 point is just too 
small and 10.5 is a wee bit too large for that particular project. It’s much easier 
to get an idea of how much space is between the paragraphs when you can set 
6 points of space instead of .0833 inches of space. 
Know how to change the rulers
You can change the rulers with the click of the mouse; when you change the 
rulers, all the settings in every measurement panel change as well. That is, when 
you change the horizontal ruler to inches, the horizontal field in the Transform 
panel changes as well, and so does the horizontal field in the Preferences and 
the Document Setup, etc. 
The horizontal measurement (width) displays inches  
right now because I set the horizontal ruler to inches.
The vertical measurement (height) displays points and 
picas right now because I set the vertical ruler to picas. 
To change the ruler measurement system: Right-click on one of the rulers 
(horizontal or vertical) and choose the increment from the menu that appears. 
I regularly flip back and forth between picas and inches because it’s still easier 
to specify a page size in inches or some boxes in inches. Generally, though, 
I tend to leave the rulers in picas until I need inches for something specific. 
A measurement is written as, for example, 6p3 or 39p0.
The number before the p is picas, and the number after the  
p is points. It’s just like writing “6 ft. 3”  for 6 feet and 3 inches.

Putting text on the page
Since you’ve been working with a computer for a while, you already know 
that you need to first select the text and then choose the formatting.* So all 
you need to know here is how to do that specifically in InDesign. You’re also 
accustomed to using a toolbar or a panel to change formatting, so all you need 
to know is where those are. (Both of these things are explained in Chapter 1).
But first, you need to know how to put text on the page. Putting text on a page 
in InDesign is completely different from doing it in a word processor or an 
email message. (If you’re accustomed to using text in Illustrator or Photoshop, 
it will seem a little more familiar.) 
Every piece of text in InDesign is inside a text frame. This frame is movable; 
that is, you can pick it up and move it anywhere you want. You can resize 
it, reshape it, rotate it, fill it with color, put a shadow on it, put it in front 
or behind other objects. You can break the text frame into many individual 
frames and connect them all together so the story flows continuously through 
the individual pieces. 
The following task walks you through the process of creating a text frame, 
typing into it, and then manipulating the frame. What you learn here will 
apply to every project you ever create in InDesign.
	
Create a text frame and type into it
You can import text from any word processor (see page 29), but often 
you will type directly on the page. 
1 Get the Type tool from the Tools panel.
2 Create a text frame in which to type: 
 
 With the Type tool, press (don’t click) on an empty area of the page 
and drag diagonally downward to the right to create a rectangular 
frame several inches wide and a couple inches deep, then let go.
3 As soon as you let go of the mouse, the insertion point starts flashing 
in the upper-left corner of the text frame, signaling that you can start 
typing. (It doesn’t matter at this point where the cursor is.)
 
 Before you start typing, read the information on the following page 
about frame edges.
* Just as in any application, when the insertion point is flashing you can change the 
formatting specs and what you type next will be in that formatting. For instance, if your 
next word is to be italic, use the keyboard shortcut to choose italic, then type. When 
finished with the italic text, hit the same keyboard shortcut again to toggle off italic. Try it!

22
A note on text frames and edges: Now, whether or not you actually see
the rectangular text frame when you let go of the mouse depends on 
whether the “Frame Edges” are showing or not (turn them on or off as 
described below). If they are showing, you’ll see a frame edge with the 
insertion point flashing, as shown below-left; if they are not, you will 
still see the insertion point flashing, but the frame will be invisible, as 
shown below-right.  
You can type into either one, and whether you choose to show the frame 
edges or not depends on how you like to work. For now, it’s probably 
a good idea to see them so you understand what’s happening on your 
page. At any time you can turn them off so you can see the page design 
better. Learn the keyboard shortcut so you can flip them on and off easily.
To show or hide frame edges, go to the View menu, to “Extras,” and 
choose “Show Frame Edges” so they are visible, or “Hide Frame Edges” 
so they disappear. Try it. 
4 Your insertion point should still be flashing in the upper-left corner  
of the frame.* Type into the text frame. 
 
 The text will use the font, size, and color that has been set as a  
default. (Remember what you learned about defaults and how to 
control them on page 12, but for now, just type.)
 
 As you type, the text bumps into the right edge and automatically 
wraps back to the left edge (so do not hit a Return or Enter key at the 
ends of the lines!). Type several lines, until the text stops appearing in 
the frame and you see a red plus sign, as shown below.
* If there are any type settings you weren’t aware of, such as a centered 
alignment or an indent, the insertion point won’t be flashing in the upper-left 
corner. That’s okay. Type anyway, or see page 35 about defaults. 
William Butler Yeats

tip: If you’re using one of the Selection tools (black or white),  
double-click in a text frame to switch to the Type tool automatically. 
5 Now that you've got a text frame, let’s look carefully at it. You are 
going to work with thousands of text frames, so it’s best you really 
understand them. And the first thing to understand is this:
The Type tool directly affects the individual characters.  
To enter text into a frame or edit existing text in a frame,  
use the Type tool.
The black Selection tool treats the frame as an object. 
To move, resize, or colorize a frame, use the black Selection tool.
The white Direct Selection tool manipulates the individual  
points on the object (points, not handles). To alter a frame’s shape, 
use the white Direct Selection tool.
 
 We want to see the frame as an object right now, so get the black 
Selection tool and single-click on the frame. You will see something 
like this:
In Port.
Live Corners;
see page 139. 
You will only see 
these handles when 
you click on the 
text with the black 
Selection tool. 
I call this the windowshade 
handle because you can drag it up 
and down like a windowshade.
Frame edge. The frame edge 
has eight handles (just like a 
graphic, shown in Chapter 7). 
Blue Anchored Object control;
see page 13. 
Out Port.
6 I recommend that you turn off things you don’t need right now,  
such as the yellow Live Corners control (which lets you change the 
shape of the corners) and the blue Anchored Object control (which  
lets you anchor a text frame or graphic to other text, which is great, but 
you end up doing it accidentally all the time, which is really annoying 
and frustrating to fix). If you see the yellow and blue boxes on your 
frame, hide them (if you don’t see them, they’re already hidden):
 
 From the View menu, choose “Extras,” and then choose to hide each 
of those items. 
 
 Now let’s go play with the text frames.
—continued

24
With the black Selection tool, 
drag any handle to resize the 
frame. Watch the text reflow.
Keep an eye on the Out Port 
as you resize.
7 Resize the text frame: 
 
 Get the black Selection tool and drag any side handle or corner handle. 
Do not click in an In or Out Port for now! If you accidentally do so, 
your cursor loads up with text—single-click on the black Selection 
tool in the Tools panel to let it go.
 
 Notice as you resize the frame, the Out Port either displays a red + sign,
or it’s empty. 
 
 
A red + sign indicates there is more text in the frame that  
has not been placed on the page; this is called overset text.
 
 
An empty Out Port means all the text in that story  
has been placed on a page.
 
 Practice resizing the frame until you feel comfortable doing so. 
Threaded text frames 
Often you will work with individual text frames, but just as often you will 
work with longer text that needs to be broken up into several frames. Because 
it’s something you will do millions of times, spend a couple of minutes now 
so you clearly understand the process.
	
Create a long story and break it into frames
1 With the Type tool, create a text frame that is about 3 inches wide  
and about 7 or 8 inches deep.
2 While the insertion point is flashing in that frame, go to the Control 
panel across the top of the window and choose 10-point type and 
“Auto” leading (see page 30 if you don’t know how to do that). 
3 Go to the Type menu and choose, “Fill with Placeholder Text.”   
Your entire frame should now be filled with 10-point mumbo jumbo. 
That’s good.  
4 With the black Selection tool, single-click on the frame and you see  
that the Out Port is empty. What you have is one complete story,  
and at the moment the entire story is in one frame. 
In Port.
Handle.

  2 :  t e x t  f r a m e s  &  f o r m a t t i n g
25
The concept of a story is important: A story might be totally contained 
in one frame, or it might be threaded through dozens of frames or an 
entire chapter. You can always tell when you’ve reached the end of a 
story because the Out Port is empty.
5 We’re going to separate the story you created into several frames,  
and the text is going to “thread” from one frame to the next. 
 
 With the black Selection tool, roll up the text frame so it’s only  
about two inches deep. Notice that the red plus sign appears. 
6 With the black Selection tool, single-click in the Out Port. The cursor 
gets loaded with the rest of the text from that frame, shown below-left. 
7 With that loaded cursor, press-and-drag a frame about the same size 
as the first one, as shown below-right. Let go, and text fills the frame.
8 Continue loading the cursor from the red plus sign and creating new 
frames with it. You’ll know when all the text is placed when the frame 
has an empty Out Port. 
Click on the red plus sign in the 
Out Port and your cursor loads up 
the text in the rest of the frame.
Press-and-drag that loaded cursor to create 
another frame. If your Smart Guides are on (see 
page 11), you’ll see green guides when the frame 
size you’re drawing matches the one it is next to.
This is the original story. Notice 
that both of its ports are empty.
This is the same story broken into several text frames. 
Notice: The In Port at the beginning of the story is 
empty—that’s your visual clue that this is where the 
story begins. The other In and Out Ports have blue 
triangles in them, indicating that the text threads to 
another frame. The last Out Port is empty, which is 
your visual clue that the story ends here. 
To see 
exactly 
how the 
text threads, 
go to the 
View menu, 
to “Extras,” 
and check 
“Show Text 
Threads.”

Frames are holographic!
Threaded frames don’t have to be on the same page—they can be spread 
throughout the entire document, even hundreds of pages away. When you 
have the cursor loaded with the text, you can continue to turn pages, zoom 
in and out, move to another part of the page, and even create new pages, all 
while the cursor is loaded with text waiting to be placed. 
To cancel a loaded cursor, click any tool in the Tools panel. No text gets lost. In 
fact, you’ll discover that it’s actually difficult to get rid of the text. It is always 
all contained within any remaining frame (kind of like a hologram in that 
you can cut a hologram into a dozen pieces, and each piece retains the entire 
image). You can cut the text directly with the Type tool, but while using the 
black Selection tool, you can’t destroy any text until you delete every existing 
frame of the entire story. 
tip: You can also click the empty In Port and then create a new 
frame. The beginning of the text will flow into that new frame.
These are the same six text frames as on the previous page, but I colored the 
text in each one  to show what will happen to the text when you delete a frame.
I deleted the second frame, and as you can see, all the text just moved on to the next 
threaded frame. The last frame now has the red plus sign indicating there is overset 
text, or text that has not been placed on any page. No text has been deleted.

  2 :  t e x t  f r a m e s  &  f o r m a t t i n g
27
	
Experiment with those frames
Use the frames you created in Task 2 to do the following exercises.
1 Rearrange the frames on the page: With the black Selection tool, 
press-and-drag a frame or selected frames.  
2 Delete a frame or two: With the black Selection tool, click on a frame 
or select more than one, then hit the Delete or Backspace key.
3 Make more frames: With the black Selection tool, click in either the 
In Port or the Out Port of any frame; this loads the cursor. Either click 
somewhere to automatically create a frame the width of a column 
on the page, or press-and-drag to draw a frame. Click an In Port as 
opposed to an Out Port, place the text, and see what happens.
	
Break the thread
In this task you’re going to break the thread between the frames and put 
all the text back into one frame.
1 If your frame edges are hiding, show them now so you can be very 
clear on what is happening: From the View menu, choose “Extras,” 
then choose “Show Frame Edges.” Every frame should now display  
a thin blue border. 
2 Find the first frame in the story (it’s the only frame with an empty 
In Port). If you have lots of frames, make sure you’ve got the black 
Selection tool, then press Command A (PC: Control A) to select all 
the frames so you can see their ports.
3 With the black Selection tool, single-click on the first frame to select it.
4 Now with the black Selection tool, double-click on the blue triangle 
in the Out Port. Bingo! All the other frames are blank because when 
you break the thread from one frame, it breaks it from all the subsequent 
frames. The Out Port in the first frame shows the overset + sign.
5 With the black Selection tool, drag the windowshade handle of the 
first text frame (which now holds all the text) all the way down until 
the Out Port is empty.
6 Delete all the empty text frames.  
tip: With the black Selection tool, click to select a frame, then hit 
Delete or Backspace. Now keep the Delete or Backspace key down 
and click on the other frames—they disappear instantly.

  2 :  t e x t  f r a m e s  &  f o r m a t t i n g
28
	
Break the thread between non-consecutive frames
The previous task disconnects the first frame from all other frames. But 
what if you want to break the thread between two other frames? 
1 Using the same frame you put back together in Task 4, separate it 
again into at least three frames.
2 With the black Selection tool, click on the first frame (you could do 
this with any frame).
3 Single-click on the blue Out Port; this gives you a loaded text icon. 
When you position this loaded icon over the next frame in the thread, 
a broken lock symbol appears on it, as shown here.
4 With that loaded icon, click anywhere in the frame  
to sever the thread.
You can also click on an In Port and disconnect from the previous frame 
in the thread. While the cursor is loaded, even if it’s with a lock icon, 
you can click or press-and-drag with it to create another linked frame.
	
Link frames that are not yet threaded
You can link frames together that are not threaded yet. 
1 Create three individual text frames, each with a little text.  
Make sure you can tell the text in one frame from another  
(maybe it’s a different color or a different font or size).
2 With the black Selection tool, single-click on a frame to select it.
3 Single-click in the empty In Port or Out Port (you can also click  
on a red overset plus sign). The cursor loads. 
 
 When you position that cursor over another unlinked frame,  
the loaded cursor displays a lock icon, as shown here:
4 With that loaded lock cursor, click anywhere  
in the frame to link those two frames together. 
Of course, at any time you can paste text inside any frame and it will all 
flow through.
reminder: You can always click a loaded icon on any 
tool in the Tools panel to release all the loaded text.

Import text
Some people (I mean me) use InDesign as a word processor. But most people 
create lengthy text in a word processor and then import it into InDesign. 
Someone might give you a text file to place, or perhaps you work in an office 
where you are the Star Design Geek and the others write words on which you 
perform Formatting Magic.
When you import, or place, a file that was created in a word processor, it always 
drops into your document as a single story, even if it covers many pages.
To place a file, you’ll go to the File menu and choose “Place…,” find your file, 
then double-click on it; you get a loaded text cursor, shown below. This is the 
manual text flow cursor, with which you can: 
• Click on the page and InDesign creates a text frame for 
you, making it the width of a column and the depth of the 
page margin. The red plus sign will indicate overset text. 
• Or press-and-drag with the loaded cursor to create 
individual frames to put the text in, as you did in 
Task 2. The red plus sign will indicate overset text.
Hold down the Option key (PC: Alt key) and you get the semiautomatic   
text flow cursor:
• Click on the page and InDesign creates a text frame 
for you, automatically loading up the cursor with any 
overset text, ready for you to click and place. This is 
hugely helpful.
Hold down the Shift key and you get the automatic text flow cursor:
• Click on the page and InDesign places the entire text 
file. It creates as many new pages as necessary to hold 
the text. Amazing.
Hold down the Shift and Option keys (PC: Shift and Alt keys) and you   
get the fixed-page auto flow cursor:
• This is similar to the auto flow cursor, but InDesign 
will only fill the existing pages; that is, it won’t create as 
many pages as necessary. 
The manual 
text flow 
cursor icon 
looks like 
lines of text.
The semi-
automatic text 
flow cursor 
looks like a 
dotted snake.
The auto flow 
cursor looks 
like a snake.
The fixed-
page auto 
flow cursor 
is a boring 
straight line.
tip: You might want to set some options on text as it is 
imported. To do so, choose the file to place, then click the 
box to “Show Import Options” in the Place dialog box.

Formatting text
You already know how to format text—select it with the Type tool, then choose 
the font, size, color, etc. All you need to know is where to find the formatting 
specifications.
Character-specific formatting
Character-specific formatting is that which applies to individual characters. The 
characters must be highlighted with the Type tool or your formatting choices 
won’t be applied. This kind of formatting is found in the Character panel or 
the Character Formatting Controls in the Control panel (they have the same 
options), as shown below. 
Character formatting
includes font, size, small 
caps, underline, horizontal 
or vertical scaling, and all 
the other things you see 
in this panel. 
Everything  in the Character panel is also in the Control 
panel across the top of the window, easily accessible.
This text was formatted with character-specific formatting. 
(See Chapter 8 for more specifics on formatting text with color.)
Click the A button to get the 
Character Formatting Controls. 
Look at me!  
I’m a CharactEr!
tip: Although you can switch back and forth between the Character
and Paragraph Formatting Controls in the Control panel, if you have 
a large screen, both panels actually show up at the same time—they 
just switch places horizontally. Check your panel. 

  2 :  t e x t  f r a m e s  &  f o r m a t t i n g
31
Character- or paragraph-specific formatting
There is one time when you can apply character or paragraph formatting 
without using the Type tool. You can select the entire frame or many frames 
with a click of the black Selection tool, and then apply any formatting you 
want. The formatting will apply to everything in the frame. 
Paragraph formatting 
includes alignment, indents and 
tabs (Chapter 5), paragraph 
space before and after (Chapter 
3), style sheets (Chapter 6), 
and everything you see listed   
in the panel menu.
Most things  in the Paragraph panel are also in the Control 
panel across the top of the window, easily accessible.
This text was 
formatted with 
character-specific 
formatting for the 
fonts, point sizes, 
and colors, but the 
spacing between 
paragraphs, the 
alignment, and the 
style sheets are 
paragraph-specific.
Click the ¶ button to get the 
Paragraph Formatting Controls. 
Paragraph-specific formatting
Paragraph-specific formatting is that which applies to the entire paragraph, no 
matter how many characters in that paragraph are selected. In fact, you don’t 
even need to select characters to apply any paragraph specific formatting—
merely clicking the Type tool in a paragraph to set an insertion point flashing 
is enough to select the entire paragraph. 
Don’t forget to 
use the tool tips!

Formatting text frames
The text frame itself has many formatting options. You can create columns 
directly inside a frame, choose a border stroke and customize it, fill the frame 
with color or a gradient, alter the shape, and much more. This book can’t cover 
all the possibilities, but here are some techniques to get you started. Chapter 7 
on Graphics has more details about strokes and fills, and Chapter 8 on Color 
has all the details on creating and choosing colors.  
	
Add a stroke and fill to the text frame
Every frame has a stroke (the default is “None” so you don’t see it)  
and a fill (also “None”), but you can change those when appropriate. 
1 Create a frame with text, or use one of the frames you’ve already created.
2 With the black Selection tool, click on the frame to select it.
3 Open the Swatches panel. Click the Container box to make sure  
the formatting changes apply to the frame, not the text.
 
 Click the Stroke box (shown below), then click a color. 
4 Open the Stroke panel. Choose a stroke “Type” from the pop-up menu. 
Enter a “Weight” in the field, or choose from the options.
5 Go back to the Swatches panel and click on the Fill box (see below).
 
 Choose a fill color, then make it a tint of the color: Click in the “Tint” 
field and then drag the slider that appears, or enter a value.
The timid folk beseech me, the wise ones warn me,  
They say that I shall never grow to stand so high;  
But I climb among the hills of cloud  
and follow vanished lightning,  
I shall stand knee-deep in thunder  
with my head against the sky.

Use frame options to add inset spacing
The “Text Frame Options” dialog lets you set the text a certain amount 
of space from the edge of the frame. This easily expands your design 
options. Follow these steps to create something like the example below.
1 Make a text frame and put some text in it. 
2 Format the text appropriately.
3 While the insertion point is in the text frame or when it is selected  
with the black Selection tool, go to the Object menu and choose 
“Text Frame Options….” You’ll get the dialog box shown below. 
 
 Change the “Inset Spacing” and experiment with the “Vertical 
Justification.” 
 
 Click the “Preview” button so you can see the changes.
Double double toil and trouble
mummy is an ancient medicine made 
from wrapped and dried bodies,   
mostly from Egypt. Paracelsus, the 
sixteenth-century physician, alchemist, 
and occultist states, “There is no 
remedy more certain and more fitting 
for the human body than the human 
body itself reduced to a medicament.” 
He compares its power to that of the 
alchemical Philosopher’s Stone. Mummy 
is seen in old recipes and medical books 
to cure a remarkable variety of illnesses, 
and was hugely popular among the 
Elizabethans—Sir Francis Bacon always 
carried a pouch full of it on his person. 
Certain kinds of mummy could reconcile 
estranged husbands and wives—a useful 
medicament for Macbeth!
The pharmaceutical firm Merck & Co. 
sold Egyptian mummy in their catalogs 
up until 1908.
To set different spacing 
between all four edges,  
click the lock to unlock it.  
(See page 20 about using  
points and picas for measuring.)
This sets the text within 
the space vertically.
Keep in mind that you can 
tell a text frame to create 
columns. I personally 
don’t care for the spacing 
issues when using this 
feature, but you should 
experiment with it.
On the left, you can see 
the selected frame and 
how the text sits inside of 
it with an inset of 10 points.
I put a stroke type   
of “Thin-Thick” on the 
frame and changed its   
“Gap Color” to a pale tint.

Manipulating frames
Practice doing these tasks until you feel comfortable and know what to expect 
when you do it. All of the steps below require a text frame on the page. 
	
Rotate a text frame
1 Get the black Selection tool.
2 Select the frame or frames you want to rotate. 
3 Position the tip of the pointer near any corner point and watch for it 
to become a curved arrow. Press and drag.
 
 You can also enter a value into the Transform panel, in the “Rotation 
Angle” field. This makes it easy to match angles of different frames. 
	
Resize the text and the frame
Try this on a headline in its own frame and also on a paragraph of text.
1 Get the black Selection tool.
2 Single-click on the frame you want to resize (this selects it, of course).
3 Hold down the Command and Shift keys (PC: Control and Shift keys), 
then press on any handle and drag.
This is a quick and easy way to resize text. The field that displays the font size will give 
both measurements—the original point size, plus the size it is now in parentheses.
	
Reshape the frame
You might need to change the shape of a text frame to align with an 
object or to create a special shape for text. It’s easy to do.
1 Get the white Direct Selection tool.
2 Click on an empty space somewhere to deselect the frame.  
Now click on it with the white Direct Selection tool.
3 Drag any corner point to reshape. 
 
 You can add more points to use for reshaping: Get the “Add Anchor 
Point Tool,” which is under the Pen tool (see pages 142–143 about the 
Pen tool). Click on the frame edge to add points. Then get the white 
Direct Selection tool again and drag those new points.

Text defaults
Be conscious of the text defaults. Whatever options are already selected, 
including any style sheets in the Paragraph Styles or Character Styles panels, 
the font chosen, the point size, the leading value, the tabs and indents, the 
color swatches, the drop caps—anything at all—whatever is already selected 
is what will show up when you click the Type tool and start typing. That’s why 
sometimes you start typing and things look completely crazy.
You have total control over the defaults. Whatever you choose from any menu 
when there is nothing selected on the page—those options become the defaults
for that document. You need to get in the habit of constantly checking to see 
what they are, and of setting the options before you click the insertion point.
	
Set the text defaults
1 Make sure nothing is selected: From the Edit menu, choose  
“Deselect All.” 
2 Choose the Type tool.
3 From the Control panel or the Character panel, choose a font and a size. 
From the Swatches panel, choose a color.
4 Press-and-drag with the Type tool to create a text frame, then type  
into it. The text is formatted with the settings you just chose.
5 Create another text frame and type into it. Still has the defaults.
6 Create another text frame and type into it. Still has the defaults.
Take advantage of this! When you learn to use style sheets (Chapter 6), you 
can choose to set a particular style sheet as a default so you don’t have to select 
all the formatting elements individually. 
As I explained in Chapter 1, you can set defaults for just this open document, 
as you just did in Task 12, above. And you can set defaults for every new 
document that you create (see page 12). 
When I heard 
the learn’d 
astronomer; 
when the proofs, 
the figures, were 
ranged in columns 
before me; when I was 
shown the charts and the 
diagrams, to add, divide, and 
measure them; when I, sitting, 
heard the astronomer, where he 
lectured with much applause in the 
lecture-room, how soon, unaccountable, I 
became tired and sick; till rising and gliding out, 
I wander’d off by myself, in the mystical moist night-air, and 
from time to time, look’d up in perfect silence at the stars .
—Walt Whitman
I reshaped this text frame with the 
white Direct Selection tool and the Pen 
tools. You can also use a text wrap (see 
page 191), but sometimes you need the 
frame itself to be a different shape.

The Glyphs panel
One of my favorite features of InDesign is the Glyphs panel. “Glyph” is an 
all-encompassing word that includes not only the characters of an alphabet, but 
all the numbers, punctuation marks, fractions, ligatures, ornaments, swashes, 
foreign characters, special characters, etc., that might be included in a font. 
The Glyphs panel is particularly important if you’re using a large OpenType 
font, which can hold up to 16,000 glyphs—there is no way to access many 
of these glyphs on your keyboard. You can find some of them in the “Special 
Characters” panel on the Mac or the “Character Map” on a PC, but InDesign 
makes the process much easier and downright fun.

Insert a glyph into your text
1 Create a new text frame, or use one you’ve already got on the screen.
2 With the Type tool, click anywhere inside the frame. 
3 From the Type menu, choose “Glyphs” (if it isn’t already on your 
screen).
4 Scroll through and see the options for the font that is shown  
(which is the font loaded into your insertion point).  
When you see a character you want to add, such as a fraction,  
double-click it. 
Once you have used a glyph, you’ll see it in the “Recently Used” row across 
the top of the panel (as shown on the opposite page). When it’s in that row, 
you can type in your paragraph, double-click a glyph from the “Recently Used” 
row, then continue typing in your original font. You get to skip all the steps 
of having to switch to another font and back again. 
You can make your own set of glyphs for easy access to ones you need all the time. 
1 Go to the panel menu in the Glyphs panel and choose,  
“New Glyph Set….” 
2 Name it something memorable, such as “Fractions” or “Foreign  
Monetary Symbols.” Click ok.
3 Now you can add glyphs to that particular set: 
 
 Right-click on the glyph and choose “Add to Glyph Set,” then  
choose the set you named.
 
 To access that set, from the panel menu choose “View Glyph Set.”
 
 To see all the characters again, click on the “Show” menu under  
the Glyphs tab, and choose “Entire Font.”

Photography
A photograph represents a single fixed image 
of light reflected from a scene onto film or 
digital capture medium from one particular 
angle, reproduced point-for-point. Cutting a 
photograph in half results in each piece only 
retaining half of the original scene.
Holography
A hologram differs from a photograph in 
several ways:
Photography vs. Holography
Information about any given point in the 
scene is recorded across the entire medium, 
rather than one fixed area as in a photograph. 
Cutting a hologram in half results in two 
complete representations of the original 
scene, each merely having a more limited 
viewport. Think of viewing a street outside 
your house through a 4 ft. x 4 ft. window, and 
then through a 2 ft. x 2 ft. window; You can 
see nearly all the same things through the 2 ft. 
window, but you can see more at once through 
the 4 ft. window.

A hologram represents a recording of infor-
mation regarding the light which came from 
the original scene as scattered in a range of 
directions, rather than only one, so that the 
scene can be viewed from different angles as 
if it were still present.
The reproduced range of a hologram adds 
many of the same depth perception cues that 
were present in the original scene, which 
are again recognized by the human brain 
and translated into the same perception of a 
three-dimensional image as when the original 
scene might have been viewed.
The developed hologram surface itself consists 
of a very fine, seemingly random pattern, 
which appears to bear no relationship to the 
scene which it has recorded.

Spacing 
Features
You might not believe this at the moment, 
but knowing how to control spacing issues 
in InDesign is probably the most important 
difference between a project that looks 
amateurish and one that appears profes-
sional. Spacing includes the space between 
letters, between lines, between paragraphs, 
and between elements. Inappropriate or 
unconscious letterspacing can make type 
difficult to read, difficult to comprehend, 
and difficult to respect.  
There is no formulaic method for adjusting 
the spacing—it is entirely dependent on the 
typeface, the type size, the paper, the color of 
ink, the purpose of the piece. The final judge 
is your eyes. Your eyes know if the spacing is 
uneven, too tight, or too loose. 
Listen to your eyes. 
That is, listen to your eyes—and know how  
to control your software.

What a difference a letter space makes 
• Kerning is the process of adjusting the space between characters 
(discussed on the following seven pages).  
• A good font has auto kern pairs built into it that make  
your type automatically look pretty good (see pages 42–43). 
• To refine the spacing between individual characters,  
you can apply manual kerning (pages 44–45). 
• To adjust a selected range of type, you can use tracking  
(see pages 46–47).
• Sometimes you might need to adjust the space between words
(see page 48).
• You almost always need to adjust the spacing between the 
lines, called leading (see pages 49–53).
• And you must always control the spacing between paragraphs
(see pages 54–57).
• To add specific amounts of spacing between all the characters 
in a paragraph, use the “Letter Spacing” options in the 
Justification dialog box (see pages 60–61).
Units of an em
An em (also called a mutton) is a typographic unit that is the width and height 
of the point size of the type. That is, if you’re setting type in 24 point, an em 
is 24 points square. InDesign kerns and tracks based on thousandths of an em, 
which essentially means that it deletes or adds space based on the point size of 
the type. When you kern 12-point type, the unit of space added or removed is 
proportional; when you enlarge that 12-point type to 120 point, the kerning 
values are enlarged proportionally. This is a good thing. 
Although it might sound like removing space equal to a few thousandths of 
an em is overkill, you’ll be surprised at how critical it becomes as your eyes 
become more and more attuned to letter spacing. 
reminder: When working with type, it’s easiest to work in points and picas, 
as explained in Chapter 1 (page 20), so be sure to change at least the vertical 
measuring system to picas (right-click on the vertical ruler and choose “Picas”).

  3 :  s p a c i n g  f e a t u r e s
41
First, set your defaults 
Before we start playing with the various spacing options, let’s first look at 
the preferences that control your kerning values. You should change these 
preferences while no document is open on your screen because these values 
will serve as the defaults for all new documents (existing documents will retain 
their own defaults). Even if you have no idea what I’m talking about, please 
trust me and do this:
	
Set the defaults for kerning and tracking
1 Open InDesign, if it isn’t already, and make sure no document is 
open; close any open documents. All you should see is the menu bar 
across the top of your screen or window, and perhaps some panels  
on the right and the Toolbar on the left (or wherever).
2 From the InDesign menu, choose “Preferences…,” then “Units and 
Increments….” 
3 Change the specifications in the callout below. Type in the values  
you see, including the letters, such as 0.5 pt.
 
 Click ok.
Set these increments in the units shown above. Even if your 
measurement system is currently in inches or something else, 
just type exactly what you see above and it will be okay.
These settings will allow you to adjust various elements and 
formatting in tiny increments.

  3 :  s p a c i n g  f e a t u r e s

Understand the auto kern pairs 
A well-designed typeface includes a number of auto kern pairs. Certain pairs of 
letters always need kerning, such as “To” or “Va,” so the letters tuck into each 
other nicely. The spacing happens automatically as you type, as shown here:
The
Toe
To remove the auto kern pairs (I can’t think of 
a reason why you would do this), select the text 
and enter “0” (zero) in the Kerning field.
Metrics kerning
A well-designed face has the kerning built into the font metrics so when 
you type certain combinations of characters, they automatically snuggle up 
together. A font might have anywhere from fifty to several thousand auto kern 
pairs. InDesign, by default, applies these auto kern pairs, as you can tell by 
the Kerning field—when you select a range of text, it typically says “Metrics.”
You can see that the spacing between 
the Th is different from that in the To. 
The spacing is based on the auto kern 
pairs that the designer built into the font.
The “Metrics” in the Kerning field is your clue 
that InDesign is using the auto kern pairs. 
The other option in this field is “Optical.”
This means InDesign is using the font metrics and applying the kerning values 
built into the font (which is why type automatically looks better in InDesign 
than it does in most word processors because most word processors do not apply 
the auto kern pairs). However, when you click the insertion point between two 
characters, this same Kerning field displays a number in parentheses—that’s 
the kerning value of the auto pair. (That number will change if you manually 
kern the characters, and the number will no longer be in parentheses.)

Optical kerning
If you use a typeface that does not have built-in kern pairs, that’s when you want 
to choose the “Optical” option in the Kerning field (shown on the opposite 
page). Optical looks at the shapes of the letters and tries to adjust them as well 
as it can—without eyes. 
This is a typeface designed by my daughter, Scarlett, 
when she was seven years old; it has no kerning pairs.
No auto kern pairs can be applied.
But you can use Optical kerning 
and it will do the best it can.
You’ll also want to choose Optical kerning when you’re using a combination 
of fonts, styles, or sizes because the metrics cannot apply to characters unless 
they are the same font, style, and size. Below is a typical case in which you 
would want to choose Optical kerning (you will probably need to do some 
manual kerning as well). 
NOTe: Kerning values always apply to the character on the left, so if you want 
to apply Optical kerning, select only the characters you want to apply it to. 
For instance, in the example above, you would select the V or just click your 
insertion point directly after the V. If you select two characters, such as Va, 
you will also apply the Optical kerning between the a and the next letter to 
the right, which might not be what you want! 

  3 :  s p a c i n g  f e a t u r e s

Manual kerning the space between letters
Manual kerning is when you adjust the space between two characters (that 
is, two characters as opposed to a range of text). This important letterspacing 
feature is the only one dependent on your eyes. Manual kerning is what you’ll 
use to fine-tune your text (typically only your headline text) after all the other 
options have been adjusted. Manual kerning is the most important feature to 
master because it is a key to creating professional-level typography. 
The most efficient way to manually kern is with the keyboard shortcuts (shown 
below). With each tap of the shortcut, InDesign applies the amount you have 
set in the preferences pane shown on page 41.    
Any manual kerning you apply is added to the auto pair kern that might be 
built into the two characters. The Kerning field displays the total amount of 
the auto pair kern and any manual kerning you apply. But you don’t really have 
to worry about the numerical value—kerning is by eye, not by number. So 
ignore all the numbers in the boxes and listen to your eyes.

  3 :  s p a c i n g  f e a t u r e s
46
Tracking the space between letters
Tracking is when you adjust the space between a selected range of characters. 
Instead of applying an individual amount between a pair of letters, tracking 
applies the same amount to all the characters that are selected. Because tracking 
does not take into account the shapes of the letters, it’s only useful to get a 
start on adjusting the space—you still need to fine-tune with manual kerning. 
Any tracking you apply is added to the manual kerning and to the auto pair 
kerns. That’s why you might select an entire word and apply one value of 
tracking, but when you click between two characters in that same word, the 
Kerning field displays a different value. But the Tracking value does not affect
the Kerning value! You can manually kern between individual characters until 
they are visually consistent, then apply tracking and everything will tighten 
or loosen proportionally.

2 Format the text: Use 10.5-point type.
3 Select all the text and apply some tracking. Just keep hitting the

tighten the spacing to see how that looks. Try to get a sense of what 
makes the text the most readable (it’s a fine line).

The space between words
Occasionally you might need to adjust the space between words. One common 
circumstance is with some script faces where the tails of the letters encroach on 
the word spaces; you might need to tighten the letterspacing so the characters 
connect to each other, but open the word spacing so you can read it easily.

You can also adjust the word spacing in any style sheet (see Chapter 6 on Style 
Sheets). For instance, if you have a font that always needs more or less word 
spacing and you want to use it in the headlines of your newsletter, adjust the 
word spacing in the headline style sheet (use the Justification dialog box, as 
explained on pages 60–61).

The space between lines
It is amazing how adding a wee bit of space between the lines makes the text 
not only look more appealing, but easier to read. The space between lines is 
called leading (pronounced ledding), a name that comes from the thin strips 
of lead that were used for centuries to separate lines of metal type. 
As with most things in life, leading has a standard from which we can deviate. 
The standard value for leading is 20 percent added to the point value of the 
type. For instance, if you use 10-point type, the standard leading value—the 
Auto leading—that InDesign applies to the text is 12 points (20 percent of 
10, added to the 10, equals 12). This is written as 10/12, which means 10 point 
type with 12 points of leading.
I will be bright and
shine in pearl and gold.
But even though it’s called 12-point leading, there are really only 2 extra points 
of space between the lines! I know, it’s confusing. 
The 12 points are distributed from the baseline (the invisible line upon which 
the type sits) of one line of text to the baseline of the text above. 
When InDesign applies the standard 
value, the Auto leading, it is displayed 
in parentheses, as shown here. 
The leading is measured 
from baseline to baseline.
The text above-right is 
20/24, and it uses Auto 
leading, as shown here 
in the Control panel and 
the Character panel. 
{
It’s important to know these things because if you can’t control your leading, 
it can make you crazy. So let’s talk about how to control it. 

  3 :  s p a c i n g  f e a t u r e s
50
Once you become conscious of linespacing, you’ll start getting very fussy with 
it. It never ceases to amaze me what a difference even a half point of leading 
can do. If you have read The Non-Designer’s Design Book, you understand how 
important the concept of proximity is to communication, and now in InDesign 
you will understand how to create exactly the amount of proximity you need 
between items for clear communication.
	
Experiment with the leading in body copy
1 Create a text frame about four inches wide, then fill it with text  
(from the Type menu, choose “Fill with Placeholder Text”).  
Or type a paragraph of text, or copy and paste some text.  
2 Format the text: Select all the text and choose 10.5-point type, plus 
Auto leading (choose “Auto” from the Leading field pop-out menu).
3 Select all the text and change the leading values. Experiment: Take out 
leading, add more, add an excess, etc. Either choose an amount from 
the Leading menu or type in any amount. Print up a page of these 
paragraphs using different amounts of spacing. How do the various 
amounts of linespace affect the readability of the text?

Play with negative leading
The leading value does not always have to be larger than the point size. In 
fact, the larger the font size, the less leading you need. You will regularly 
find yourself decreasing the leading in headlines.
1 Create a text frame and type the headline you see below. 
 
 Do not hit a Return after “Crush”—either make the text frame 
smaller so the line breaks at that point, or hit Shift Return or  
Shift enter to force a line break (this breaks the line but does  
not create a new paragraph).
2 Notice how much unnecessary empty space is between the lines.  
Select all the text and reduce the leading amount. Use the keyboard 
shortcuts (shown below) so you can judge the appropriate amount 
with your eyes. You’ll see the value in the Leading field change as you 
use the shortcut.

Auto leading versus fixed leading
Auto leading: When the leading applied to text is Auto (which will be displayed 
in parentheses in the Control panel and Character panel, as shown on the 
opposite page), the space between the lines adapts as you resize the type. No 
matter how large or small you make the text, the leading is always proportionate 
to the size of the type (120 percent of the point size). 
This is fine for many things. You will run into issues, however, if you enlarge 
the point size of any character in a line that uses Auto leading because the 
character with the largest amount of Auto leading takes over the whole line. 
It creates this kind of look: 
In the time of your life, live . . . so 
that in that wondrous time you shall 
not add to the Misery and Sorrow 
of the world, but smile to the infinite 
delight and Mystery of it.

In the time of your life, live . . . so 
that in that wondrous time you shall 
not add to the Misery and Sorrow 
of the world, but smile to the infinite 
delight and Mystery of it. 
—william saroyan
The solution is to use fixed leading. 
Fixed leading: When you fix the leading by typing in your own value (even if 
it’s exactly the same amount as the Auto leading value), the leading stays that 
value, no matter how large or small you make the text. By fixing the leading, 
you avoid problems like the one shown above because the line spacing will 
stay the same no matter what the point size of the type.
The Ms and the S are in a larger point 
size with their own Auto leading,  
which is greater than the Auto leading  
of the smaller text. 
The larger characters force more space 
above the lines because the leading value 
goes from the baseline of the text up to 
the baseline above. 
With fixed leading, you 
can ensure that the space 
between all lines is the same. 

  3 :  s p a c i n g  f e a t u r e s
53
If there are any blank characters at the end of a line (which are invisible to 
you!), they hold on to their leading value and can impact the line spacing. 
When changing the leading in a line or paragraph, make sure you select the 
entire line or paragraph, as shown here:
I didn’t realize that there are three extra spaces at the end of the byline. 
If I “Show Hidden Characters” (from the Type menu), I can see them, 
as shown circled above. 
Mirth is in His Face
by Princess le France    
But when I selected the characters in the byline and reduced the font 
size with its Auto leading, the space between the lines did not change! 
Mirth is in His Face
by Princess le France    
I typed the headline (the font is Pious Henry), hit a Return/Enter,  
and typed the byline. I plan to make the byline a smaller font size.
So I selected the entire line (I triple-clicked it), and then when I 
changed the leading value, it affected the entire line, not just the 
selected characters.

The space between paragraphs
This is one of the most critical spacing features you can learn to use, in which 
you can add wee bits of space between paragraphs without having to hit the 
Enter or Return key twice. In fact, after you read this, you are never again 
allowed to hit Enter/Return more than once. (I’m just going to call it a Return 
from now on, but know that it works for the Enter or Return key.)
When you hit Return, InDesign starts a new paragraph, as you know. Auto -
matically included in that Return is a certain amount of space between the 
paragraph you just finished and the new one you are starting. The default is 
usually 0 points or 0 inches of space, which is why one might automatically 
hit two Returns to make more space. 
But two Returns makes a big, dorky space and all your paragraphs end up 
looking like disparate elements on the page. So ideally you want just about 
a half line between paragraphs, like what you see in this text you’re reading 
and in the example below-right. That’s where Paragraph Space After comes in.   
tip: If you get confused about whether to add paragraph 
space before or after, just remember this guideline: Always 
use Paragraph Space after. The day will come when you hit 
upon a design problem and discover that there is the perfect 
place to add Space Before, and then you will feel comfortable 
doing so. Until then, use Space After. 
The older Rajah was still more surprised at this. He 
could not think any one was really concerned about 
Guzra Bai, and he feared the young Rajah wished, 
for some reason, to quarrel with him. But he agreed 
to send for his wife, and messengers were at once 
dispatched to bring Guzra Bai to the palace.
No sooner had she come than the young Ranee began 
to weep, and she and the Princes gathered about their 
mother. Then they told the Rajah the whole story of 
how his mother and the nurse had sought to destroy 
Guzra Bai and her children, how they had been 
saved, and had now come to safety and great honor.
The Rajah was overcome with joy when he found 
that Guzra Bai was innocent. He asked her to forgive 
him, and this she did, and all was joy and happiness.

I hit the Return key twice at the end 
of each of these paragraphs. The 
big gaps between them separate 
the thoughts too much.
Above, I set a Paragraph Space After  
of about half the type size. That is, if the 
point size of the type is 11 points, add 
about 5.5 or 6 points of space after each 
paragraph.

The amount of space between paragraphs is determined in the Paragraph panel, 
as shown below. Let’s start with the Paragraph Space After because it’s a little 
easier to understand. 
The tool tips, as shown here, will 
appear when you hover over the 
icon label as a reminder of which 
field to use. 
	
Experiment with the Paragraph Space After
In this example, you’ll adjust the spacing between several paragraphs. First, 
make sure your measuring system is in picas: Right-click (or Control-click) 
on the vertical ruler on the left side of the window, and choose “Picas.” Then:
1 Create a text frame about three inches wide and five inches deep.
2 While the insertion point is flashing in your text frame, choose  
10 point for the font size. 
3 Type three short paragraphs of anything. At the end of each 
paragraph, hit one Return or Enter—not two! At the moment, it 
might look like there is no space between the paragraphs; that’s okay.
4 When you’ve got three paragraphs, each at least two or three lines 
long, select all the text.
5 In the Paragraph panel or in the Control panel with the paragraph 
specs showing (as shown above), enter 0p6 in the Space After field, 
then hit Enter. You should now see 6 points of space between each 
paragraph. 
 
 Experiment with other values until you can predict what will happen 
when you hit Enter.
tip: Any Paragraph Space After or 
Before is added onto the leading value.

Combine leading and Paragraph Space After
In something like a bulleted or numbered list, you want the lines in the 
paragraph to be closely connected, but you want more space after each 
section. So tighten up the leading a wee bit, and open up the Space After.
1 Recreate the list shown below with any list of your choice.
2 Tighten the leading just a tiny bit, like half a point, and add 
Paragraph Space After to all paragraphs, including the headline 
(separately). You can immediately see the huge difference  
in clarity.

A place to use Paragraph Space Before
This example is one of the few times when it’s perfect to use the Space 
Before feature instead of the Space After. When you have body text that is 
broken up with subheads, you want the subheads to be closer to the body 
copy it refers to and farther away from the text above/before the subhead. 
So add Space Before to subheads.
In something like a newsletter or a brochure, you’ll create a style sheet (as 
explained in Chapter 6) for subheads to make the space appear automatically.
1 Create several short paragraphs, each with a subheading. Hit a Return 
after each subheading, and a Return at the end of each paragraph.
2 To each subheading, add 9 or 10 points of space to the Paragraph 
Space Before.

Each of these subheads has 
Paragraph Space Before, which adds 
space above the paragraph/subhead. 
This separates each subhead from 
the text above/before it.
This heading has 3 points of Space After.  
This subhead has 9 points of Space Before. 
Thus there is a total of 12 extra points of 
space between the head and the subhead 
(plus the leading value).

Although it can seem so dry to learn, 
understanding how to adjust the spacing 
values throughout a designed piece 
is truly one of the biggest differences 
between amateur and professional work. 
And not only does a project look better, 
it communicates better when you pay 
careful attention to spacing issues.
These bylaws also use tabs and indents,  
as explained in Chapter 4.
Whether your project is as boring 
as bylaws or as fun as a poster, the 
ability to control the spacing is an 
essential key to its success.

If you really have to make it fit . . .
Sometimes the text just doesn’t fit and you have to cheat a little here and there 
to force it into the space. For instance, you might want to bring the short last 
word of a column up to the line above, or make a one-line statement fit on 
one line, or send a couple of words to the last line. Here are a few extra tricks 
you can use, and probably no one in the entire world will notice (which is 
kind of sad). 
• If your text frame is flush left, widen or narrow it just a hair. 
Or two. 
• To force one line that’s just a little too long into one line, 
justify it. 
If that doesn’t work, select the entire line and use the tracking 
keyboard shortcut to take out wee bits of space.
Or do both of the above.
• If you have many pages and you want to make everything just 
a tiny bit shorter or a tiny bit longer, remove something like 
one-quarter or one-half of a point out of the leading, or add  
a tiny bit. 
Or select the appropriate text and use the Justification dialog 
box (see the following two pages) to delete/add a tiny bit of 
Letter Space to all of it.  
• Change the Horizontal Scale of the selected characters. You 
can make them 2 percent wider or narrower and few people 
will notice. In headlines, you can get away with a little more 
compressing or stretching because people seem to almost expect 
it, which means few people will worry about it too much.
This is the Horizontal Scale field in the 
Control panel or the Character panel.
• Triple-click to select an entire paragraph, then use the keyboard 
shortcuts to track the text, adding either a tiny bit of space or 
deleting. This can bring the last word, an orphan, up into the 
paragraph, or send a couple more words down to the last line  
so you don’t have an orphan at all.

Advanced tips: Paragraph-specific letterspacing
Feel free to skip this section—you can probably live your entire life without 
reading it. But if you are feeling confident about spacing issues in InDesign 
and want to know even more, learn about the Justification dialog box and 
how it impacts spacing.
First, understand that kerning values are “character-specific,” meaning you can 
apply them to selected characters. Tracking values are also character-specific, 
but can be added to style sheets in the “Basic Character Formats” pane; when 
added to a style sheet, the tracking affects every character in the paragraph.
But there’s another way to adjust the letterspacing in a paragraph of text, or in 
all headlines, a story, or an entire document—paragraph-specific letterspacing. 
Because this letterspacing does not take into consideration any tracking, 
kerning, or pair kern values, it is the fastest and most processor-efficient way 
for InDesign to adjust the space between lots of characters. This is the feature 
you want to use if you have pages of text to open up or tighten. (You won’t see 
the paragraph letterspacing value reflected in the tracking or kerning fields.)
The specifications in the Justification dialog box affect all the type on the page, 
whether you realize it or not. 
The Justification dialog box
Open the Justification dialog box in either your style sheet options or from 
the Paragraph panel menu. These specifications tell InDesign how much it can 
adjust the word spacing, the letter spacing, and even the width of characters 
(glyphs) when the text is justified (lined up on both the left and right sides). 
For instance, the defaults shown below tell InDesign that if you justify the text, 
it is allowed to squish the word spacing up to 75 percent to make text fit on 
the line, or it can expand the word spacing up to 150 percent. If necessary, it 
is also allowed to adjust the letter spacing where necessary, but in these specs 
it cannot squish or expand the letterforms/glyphs.
This is also where 
InDesign is told to add 20 
percent of the point size 
of the type to create the 
Auto Leading value. You 
can change this if you can 
think of a reason to do so.

  3 :  s p a c i n g  f e a t u r e s
61
tip: To force a line break without 
making a new paragraph, use  
Shift Return or Shift Enter.
Now, there are two things to remember about these specs: 
• The “Minimum” and “Maximum” amounts only apply if you 
justify the text. That is, flush right or flush left text will ignore 
whatever is in those fields and will simply apply the “Desired” 
amount.
• The “Desired” amount must be between (or including) the 
“Minimum” and “Maximum.” For instance, if you want to change 
the “Desired” letterspacing to 30 percent, first you must change the 
“Maximum” to 30 percent or more. 
The smaller the type size, the more letterspacing it needs, proportionally, 
and the larger the type, the less letterspacing it needs. So let’s say you have a 
page of small type and you want to open up the space a little. You could do 
it with tracking, but it will be faster and more efficient to use the paragraph 
letterspacing. 
So select the text or style sheet. In the Justification dialog box, first enter an 
amount in the Letter Spacing “Maximum” field. If your text is justified, enter 
the percentage that you want to increase the spacing by, and enter that same 
amount in the “Desired” field. If your text is not justified, enter any amount in 
the “Maximum” field, then enter your desired increase in the “Desired” field. 
If you’re working with large type that needs less letterspacing, you can enter 
negative numbers in the “Minimum” and “Desired” fields.  
The Word Spacing in the Justification dialog box works the same as Letter 
Spacing: The designer has built into the font metrics the “spaceband,” or the 
amount of space that appears on the page when you hit the Spacebar. You can 
deviate from this amount by a desired percentage. I sometimes open up the 
word spacing just a wee bit for clarity. 
The Glyph Scaling, as I mentioned, can allow InDesign to squish or expand the 
actual letterforms to fit the text in the desired line length. Alternatively, you 
can use these fields for an intentionally distorted type effect! (For short pieces 
of text, such as the one below, you can also use the Horizontal Scale field in 
the Control panel or the Character panel.)
Vile BezOnianS!

Try this!
Recreate a letter like the one below. Do not hit double Returns/Enters to 
create the spacing! Everything can be done with Paragraph Space After and 
with leading. Once you have the letter set up, you can use it as a template for 
future letters. 
Child of Fancy Lane
Xabier, Basque 12277
October 9, 1593
Ferdinand, King of Navarre
Castle of Olite
Oligicus, Navarre 31745
Dear King Ferdinand,
re: The oath to abstain from the company of women
Love, first learnèd in a lady’s eyes, lives not alone immured in the 
brain, but with the motion of all elements, courses as swift as thought 
in every power, and gives to every power a double power, above their 
functions and their offices. 
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods makes heaven drowsy 
with the harmony. Never durst poet touch a pen to write until his ink 
were tempered with Love’s sighs. From women’s eyes this doctrine I 
derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire. They are the books, 
the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world. 
Then fools you were, these women to forswear, or keeping what is 
sworn, you will prove fools. For Wisdom’s sake (a word that all men 
love), or for Love’s sake (a word that loves all men), or Women’s 
sake (by whom we men are men), let us once lose our oaths to find 
ourselves, or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.  
Sincerely,
Lord Berowne
I did not hit   
the Spacebar   
to move this 
text over!   
I used a tab— 
see the 
following 
chapter.

Tabs and 
Indents
I realize that most people hate tabs and 
indents, mainly because they don’t quite 
understand how they work. You see, tabs and 
indents always do what you tell them to do! 
If you have trouble with tabs and indents, 
it is only because you don’t know what you 
are telling them! Don’t holler at those poor 
tabs—they are trying to do what you want; 
it’s your responsibility to figure out how to tell 
them what to do. They always work. They are 
extremely dependable and reliable and logical 
(yes, logical). So this chapter teaches you how 
to take advantage of their dependability.
Also check out Chapter 5 about the table 
feature because some designers prefer to use 
tables rather than tabs and indents. 

  4 :  t a b s  a n d  i n d e n t s
64
The Tabs panel displays the ruler increments that are showing in the Ruler on the 
page (as explained on page 10). Here you see picas (see page 20). To see larger 
and more detailed increments in this ruler, enlarge the view of the document; 
unfortunately, this doesn’t enlarge the tiny little markers.
Things you should know about tabs and indents
You must first understand how tabs and indents behave.
A The Tabs panel is where the tabs and indents are set and displayed,  
and every paragraph has its own ruler settings. 
This is critical. Any tabs or indents you set in the Tabs panel  
will apply only to the paragraph that is currently selected; that is,  
tab settings are paragraph-specific, as explained on page 31.
Open the Tabs panel from the Type menu.
	
Experiment with the Tabs panel and paragraphs
1 Create a text frame three or four inches wide and type several lines  
of text (do not hit a Return at the ends of the lines).
2 After a couple of lines, hit a Return (which creates a new paragraph)  
and type several more lines of text.
3 While the insertion point is at the end of the second paragraph,  
go to the Type menu and choose “tabs,” or if the tabs ruler is already 
on the screen, click the tiny magnet icon to snap it to the text frame.
4 Find the triangle at the far right end (that’s the Right Indent marker) 
and drag it inward (to the left) about an inch. 
 
 The right margin in the second paragraph indents an inch inward 
because that is the paragraph that is selected. 
 
 Notice that the first paragraph did not indent its right margin. 
5 Now single-click in the first paragraph to set the insertion point within 
that paragraph.
 
 In the Tabs panel, you see that the Right Indent marker (the triangle) 
is back in its original position. That’s because every paragraph has its 
own settings. 
To change the settings of more than one paragraph at once, select 
all the paragraphs you want to change. (These paragraphs must be 
contiguous, or connected to each other, to select them.)  

  4 :  t a b s  a n d  i n d e n t s
65
B The Tabs panel ruler has invisible tab settings every half inch. 
As soon as you set your own tab, every default tab setting  
to the left of that new tab disappears.
	
I put colored dots on the image to represent the invisible default tab markers.
However, any tabs that you manually set will not disappear.
Click the magnet 
icon to snap the 
Tabs panel to the 
selected text frame.
	
Experiment with a tab marker
1 Make sure the Ruler across the top of the screen is showing  
(from the View menu).
 
 Make sure the Ruler is in inches for now. If it isn’t displaying inches, 
you can change it: Control-click or right-click on the Ruler;  
from the menu that appears, choose “Inches.”  
2 Create a text frame three or four inches wide.
3 Hit the Tab key, then type a silly word, such as Dogfood.
4 If the Tabs panel is open, single-click on its magnet icon to make it 
snap to the text frame you just made. Or open the Tabs panel (from 
the Type menu), and it will position itself directly over the text box.  
The word you typed is aligned with the half-inch mark. 
5 Single-click in the Tabs panel ruler near the 2-inch mark; the word 
you typed will instantly jump to that new marker because all the 
invisible default tab settings to its left have disappeared.
 
 Drag that tab marker left or right and watch the word snap to that 
new position.

  4 :  t a b s  a n d  i n d e n t s
66
C Tabs are cumulative, and they accumulate in the word you type  
after you hit the Tab key. 
Huh? Well, if you hit the Tab key three times and then type the word 
Rosalind, that word Rosalind holds onto those three tabs. Rosalind will 
jump over to the third tab she can find (which does not necessarily mean 
the third tab in the Tabs panel!).
If you then hit two more tabs and type the word Celia, the word Celia
holds onto five tabs—the tabs accumulate. And again, Celia will jump to 
the fifth tab she can find. 
I say “the fifth tab she can find” because perhaps Rosalind’s name is too 
long and extends past the fourth tab in the ruler; in that case, Celia
doesn’t count that tab—she only counts two more beyond Rosalind, the 
two she can find. 
This is probably the most crazy-making thing about tabs, so spend  
a couple of minutes to understand it and control it.  
	
Experiment with accumulating tabs
1 Create a text frame four to six inches wide.
2 Follow these directions precisely (that is, do not type  
more than one tab between words).
 
 Hit the Tab key once. 
Type Cat, then hit the Tab key once. 
Type Dog, then hit the Tab key once. 
Type Rhinoceros, then hit the Tab key once. 
Type Ape, then hit the Tab key once.
 
 Hit the Enter key to create a new paragraph.
 
 Hit the Tab key once.  
Type Rat, then hit the Tab key once. 
Type Bird, then hit the Tab key once. 
Type Shrew, then hit the Tab key once. 
Type Monkey (even if it doesn’t line up!), then hit the Tab key once.
3 To see the tab markers, go to the Type menu and choose “Show 
Hidden Characters.” You will see one tab marker before each word.
You can see there is one 
tab marker (») pushing 
each word to the right, to 
align with the default tabs 
set every half inch.

  4 :  t a b s  a n d  i n d e n t s
67
 
 Notice that as you manually set a tab marker, the default and invisible 
markers every half-inch to the left disappear (they remain every 
half-inch to the right of the last manual tab marker). You can tell they 
are no longer in place because tabbed text doesn’t stop there. 
 
 Continue to experiment: Select both paragraphs, and drag the tab 
markers left and right; watch everything follow along. Hit Enter and 
type another line of four animals; adjust the tabs if necessary.
Oh, what nice, 
neat columns 
you have now!
	

  4 :  t a b s  a n d  i n d e n t s
68
D You can remove extra tabs in the text just as if the tabs were 
characters. 
One reason why tabs can be so confusing is that not only are the 
default tab markers in the ruler invisible, but the characters in the 
text are invisible. As you saw in Step 3, you can “Show Hidden 
Characters” to see them.
4 Hit the Delete key. Watch how James Clifton now goes to the second 
tab he can find. When you delete one tab from James, notice that Ryan
also has one less tab; he now goes to the fourth tab he can find. 
Here you can clearly see the three tab characters that James is obeying, 
and you can see that Ryan has accumulated five tabs. 
Even when you cannot see the actual tab characters, you can remove 
them just as if they were letters. If you had typed three periods in front 
of the words “James Clifton,” you know how to delete those periods. 
In exactly the same way, you can delete tab characters.
	
Delete tabs from the text
1 Create a text frame about four or five inches wide.
2 Hit the Tab key three times, then type James Clifton. 
Hit the Tab key two more times, then type Ryan Nigel.
3 Click to set the insertion point in front of James Clifton. 
Drag a wee bit to the left, just enough to select the chunk of tab. 
You will notice that you cannot select only a portion of that tab 
character—it’s all or nothing. 

  4 :  t a b s  a n d  i n d e n t s
69
Tab alignments and symbols
InDesign provides four tab alignments, and each one has its own symbol. 
When you hit the Tab key and it goes to a 
left-aligned tab, the insertion point goes to the 
tab marker and the text types to the right (it 
aligns on the left). Notice the visual clue of the 
direction of the tail on the symbol—it shows you 
which direction the type will head. 
When you hit the Tab key and it goes to a right-
aligned tab, the insertion point goes to the tab 
marker and the text types to the left (it aligns on 
the right).
When you hit the Tab key and it goes to a 
centered tab, the insertion point goes to the tab 
marker and the text types outward on both sides 
of the marker.
When you hit the Tab key and it goes to a 
decimal tab, the insertion point goes to the tab 
marker. The text extends to the left until you type 
a decimal (a period), then the text continues on 
the other side, typing to the right. 
The following pages walk you through exercises to become familiar with these 
tabs. As I’ve mentioned before, it is worth your time to become proficient!
tip: Before you do the exercises, make sure your Tabs 
panel has no prior defaults set. Use the panel menu to 
“Clear All” and “Restore Indents” if necessary.

  4 :  t a b s  a n d  i n d e n t s
70
tip: When working with tabs, get in the habit of never
hitting more than one tab to get to the column you want. 
Trust me, typing extra tabs is only crazy-making when you 
want to format the text.
Tab basics
• The ruler across the top of the document window has nothing to 
do with tabs. Do not try to align your text by measuring in that 
ruler! The only way the ruler across the top of the document 
and the Tabs panel ruler are related is that the horizontal 
measurement you choose in the document ruler changes  
the measurement in the Tabs panel ruler. 
• The Tabs panel ruler applies to the selected text frame  
or the selected text. 
• Every paragraph has its own tab settings.
• Always use a left alignment with tabs! If you set tabs and 
it’s all messed up, check to make sure the text alignment is 
left-aligned.
• You can set up tabs before you begin typing, or type some  
text and then add the tabs.
• To add a tab marker to the Tabs panel ruler, single-click the type 
of tab you want (explained on the previous page), then single-
click in the Tabs panel ruler to set the tab marker.
• To move a tab marker, drag the marker left or right.
• To delete a tab marker, drag the marker off the ruler— 
up, down, or diagonally.
• To change the tab marker to another alignment, single-click 
on the marker you want to change. Then single-click on the 
symbol for the type of tab you want to replace it with.
• If you open the Tabs panel and set tab markers when there is 
no text selected and no frame selected, the tabs you set will be 
the new defaults. That is, any new text frame you create in that 
document will have those tab settings. Take advantage of this!
• To clear all tab markers and return the invisible defaults at every 
half inch, use the panel menu and choose “Clear tabs.”

Left-aligned tabs
A left-aligned tab is the most commonly used, where the text aligns on the left 
side and moves out to the right, just as you expect when you type or write in 
English. If you did Task 3 on page 66, you were using left-aligned tabs. Here 
is another small exercise. 
	
Create a chart using left-aligned tabs
1 Create a new text frame about five or six inches wide.
2 Type the text below. Do not hit a tab at the beginning of each line; 
only hit the Tab key before the words True and False. As shown below, 
the text will not align, but that’s okay, as long as True has one tab and 
False has another tab. 
Solpugids have ten legs. 
True 
False
Solpugids are related to Harvestmen.  
True 
False
Solpugids belong to the order of Solifugids. True 
False
Solpugids cannot kill you.  True 
False
Solpugids liquefy their prey.  
True 
False
3 Select all the text.
4 Open the Tabs panel if it isn’t already. If necessary, click the magnet 
icon to snap the panel to the text frame. 
5 Click the left-aligned tab marker.
6 Single-click in the ruler at a position beyond the end of the longest 
question. That new tab marker deletes all the default tabs to its left, so 
now all the Trues jump to that first tab marker. 
 
 All the Falses jump to the second tab marker, which will be the next 
default they can find. Click in the ruler to set another tab a little 
farther to the right. Feel free to move them around!

  4 :  t a b s  a n d  i n d e n t s
73
	
Create another chart using left-aligned tabs
This exercise is different from the previous one only in that you are going 
to set the tabs before you begin typing. 
1 Create a text frame about five inches wide.
2 With the insertion point flashing in the text frame  
(which means that text frame is selected), open the Tabs panel  
(from the Type menu, or use the keyboard shortcut  
(Command Shift T or PC: Control Shift T).
3 Set tabs at .75 inch and 2.5 inch.
4 Choose a font size of 10 point.
5 Type the text shown below.
 
 After the first paragraph of body copy (“Below is a list . . . ”),  
hit tabs before the headings and the entries in the “Relation”  
and “rsvp yes” columns.
 
 Hit Enter at the end of each row. 
 
 At any point, select all of the text and move the tab markers  
as necessary.
tip: If you want to center “rsvp yes” over the column of bullets, 
single-click with the Text tool in that line of type. Drag the tab 
marker to the left until the text is centered over that column.
If the hidden characters are showing, you should see one 
tab symbol before the “Relation” column and another tab 
symbol before the “rsvp yes” column.

This handout for a group of 
Shakespeare readers uses 
a right-aligned tab for the 
numbers of lines, a left-
aligned tab for the character 
names, then another left-
aligned tab for the act/scene 
numbers. 
By using tabs appropriately, 
the information is easier to 
understand.
(See Chapter 5 on Tables 
for an alternative to a 
tabular arrangement.)

Right-aligned tabs
Right-aligned tabs are useful for numbers that don’t have a decimal point, or 
for any items that you want to align on the right. 
	
Create a numbered chart using right-aligned tabs
This exercise involves whole numbers. You’ll type a few lines with tabs 
before you set up the markers. 
1 Create a new text frame about five inches wide.
2 Type the following text in 10-point type, hitting the Tab key once to 
move to the next column, whether it aligns or not at this point. Hit 
Enter or Return at the end of each line.

3 Select all the text.
4 Open the Tabs panel. Or if it is already open, single-click the  
magnet icon so the panel snaps to the text frame. 
5 If there are any tab markers in the ruler, click the tiny menu symbol at 
the right end of the panel (circled, below) and choose “Clear All” (this 
clears any tabs you added and restores the invisible defaults).
 
 Single-click the right-aligned tab symbol (circled below, left).
6 Single-click six tab markers, starting at about 1 inch. Watch the text 
numbers align appropriately.
7 Continue typing to finish the chart, as shown below.

Decimal-aligned tabs
The decimal tab does not just align decimal points in numbers—you can assign 
any character to align. For instance, you might want the dollar signs to align, 
or the right brackets, or a bullet.  
	
Align text to a decimal point
This exercise involves numbers with the decimal point in various places. 
1 Create a new text frame about five inches wide.
2 Type the following text in 10-point type, hitting the Tab key once  
to move to the next column, whether it aligns or not at this point.  
Hit Enter or Return at the end of each line.

3 Select the heading line (“Original Planet,” etc.) and set left-aligned 
tabs for the two headings that label the numbers columns.
4 Select the lines with numbers and set decimal tabs so the numbers 
are visually centered under their headings (choose the decimal tab 
symbol, then click in the ruler).
Rather than set a tab  
in front of each line,  
I indented these lines 
by dragging both of the 
left markers in the ruler 
to the right a wee bit, as 
you can see above (see 
pages 82–86 about the 
indent markers).

Align text to a character
Don’t limit yourself to aligning text on a period. When you use a decimal 
tab, it actually aligns the text according to the symbol that is in the “Align 
On” field, which by default is a period. But you can type or paste any 
character into that little field and have your text align with it.
1 Create a text frame about 3 inches wide; choose 10-point type.
2 Type the text below, hitting a tab at the beginning of each line. At the 
moment, the tab will go to the default ½-inch marker. That’s okay.
 
 To type the heart in Zapf Dingbats, see pages 36–37 on using the 
Glyphs panel (or feel free to use any dingbat you want). 
3 Open the Tabs panel and click the magnet to snap it to the frame.
4 Select all the text.
5 Single-click on the decimal tab to select it. Once it is selected,  
the “Align On” field is available.
tip: Once tabs are set in a line of text, you can hit 
the Enter key to type the next line and the tabs will 
continue to carry on in the same format. 
 
 Copy the heart from the text; click in the “Align On” field  
and paste it in. All the heart symbols are aligned. (If they are not 
aligned, show the hidden characters to make sure you hit a tab  
at the beginning of each line.)

Right-aligned tabs with leaders
“Leaders” are the dots or lines that lead your eye from one column to another, 
most often seen in tables of contents. When working with leaders, remember 
that the tab marker holds on to the leader specs, so if you delete that tab, you 
delete the leaders.
task 10 Create tabs with leaders
1 Create a text frame about 3 inches wide; choose 10-point type.
2 Type the first line or two of the list shown below, hitting a tab  
before the page number. Do not type the dots!
3 Select the text. 
4 Open the Tabs panel and click the magnet to snap it to the frame. 
5 Single-click the right-aligned tab; click in the Tabs panel ruler  
close to the right edge. 
6 While that tab is still selected, type the leader character that you want 
to use in the “Leader” field. For now, type a period. You will instantly 
see the leaders connect from the name to the number, which is now 
right-aligned as well.
7 Click at the end of the last line (after the number) to put your 
insertion point in that position. Hit Enter to make a new paragraph.
 
 Continue typing the rest of the list. As long as you keep hitting the 
Enter (or Return) key at the end of each line (which turns that line into 
a paragraph), the tab formatting will carry over to the next line.
tip: You can type or paste any character into 
the "Leader" field. In fact, you can use up to 
eight characters. Experiment with this!

task 11 Match the leaders
One sign of unprofessional typography is when the leaders in a list have 
differently sized dots. This happens because the leader automatically picks 
up the formatting from the last character before the tab, as shown below-left. 
You can see the consistent formatting for leaders and page numbers in the 
example, below-right.
1 Recreate the text above, using a heavy bold face for the headings. Set 
the right-aligned tab with leaders, as explained on the opposite page.
2 The leaders are simply formatted characters, so there are several ways 
to make the leaders match. Experiment with these options:
 • Select the leaders in each line and change the formatting  
(to 8-point Light, for instance).
 • Or select the smaller leaders in one of the lines.  
Copy the leaders.  
Select the larger leaders in one of the headings. 
Paste. Paste to replace the others as well. 
 • Or create a style sheet for character formatting, as explained in 
Chapter 6. Assign a keyboard shortcut to it, then apply it to  
the selected leaders. 
 • Or create a paragraph style sheet with nested character styles,  
as explained in Chapter 6, so the leaders and the page numbers 
appear in the proper formatting automatically.
 • Or if you use the Table of Contents feature (from the Layout 
menu), your paragraph and character style sheets will be applied 
automatically as InDesign generates your table of contents. You 
can see an example in this book’s contents—the entire table was 
formatted when I clicked the button. Unfortunately, I don’t have 
room in this small book to explain InDesign’s book features, but 
they are in the Adobe online manual.

  4 :  t a b s  a n d  i n d e n t s

 Now you can widen or narrow the frame and the text will always 
align. If you want this text on every page in your document, put the 
frame on the master page, as explained on pages 14–15.
The Repeat tab
I love this feature. You can create a series of tabs across the frame that are exactly 
the same distance apart from each other. Try this small task:
	
Repeat a typographic element
1 Type a bullet or an ornament over and over, hitting a tab between  
each one.
2 Set a tab in the Tabs panel ruler, and make sure it is selected.
3 From the panel menu on the right end of the ruler, choose  
“Repeat tab.” The distance between each tab will be the distance  
from the selected tab and the tab or margin to its left. 
4 To change the spacing, select the tab, move it left or right, then choose 
“Repeat tab” again. 
Right- and left-align the text
Have you ever wanted to put a header across the top of a page where the text 
aligns both on the left and the right sides? Here’s the trick:
	
Create a header aligned on both sides
1 Create a one-line text frame that stretches across the column.
2 Type the text you want to align on the left.
3 Hit a tab.
4 Type the text you want to align on the right.
5 Select the line (your insertion point in the line  
selects it).
6 Right-justify the line: In the Paragraph panel,  
single-click the Align right icon. 

  4 :  t a b s  a n d  i n d e n t s
81
Try this!
Here is a small exercise that utilizes both left- and right-aligned tabs in a 
practical situation. Format the text in A so it looks like the text in B.

The Tabs panel ruler, as you know by now, snaps to the selected text frame 
(selected with either the black Selection tool or by clicking the Type tool inside 
the text frame). The text frame itself creates the margins. The left and right 
indents indent the text in relation to those margins, or edges, of the text frame. 
The indents have nothing to do with the ruler across the top of the window 
nor with the document margins!
The indents make perfect sense if you just remember this: 
The text in a paragraph begins at the First-Line Indent marker.
As you type, the text moves to the right and at the end of the  
line bumps into the Right Indent marker (as long as you don’t  
hit a Return or the Enter key).
After it hits the Right Indent, the text bounces back to the  
Left Indent marker (the bottom triangle) and carries on, bouncing 
back and forth between the Right and Left Indent markers.
As soon as you hit Enter or Return, the line starts over again at the 
First-Line Indent marker.  
Here you can see that the First-Line Indent marker has been moved to 
the right, and the Right Indent has been moved to the left.
Indent the text
Indents are easier to understand than tabs, as long as you know that each 
paragraph has its own Tabs panel ruler settings. 
There are three indent markers: 
First-Line Indent 
Left Indent
Right Indent

  4 :  t a b s  a n d  i n d e n t s
83
	
Experiment with the indents
This exercise involves playing with the indents. As you move the markers, 
watch the text move. Get to a point where you can predict what will happen 
as you move the markers. 
1 Create a small text frame, about 3 x 3 inches.
2 Choose a font, choose 10-point type, and justify the text. 
3 From the Type menu, choose “Fill with Placeholder Text”  
(it’s toward the bottom of the menu). Divide the text into three 
paragraphs (click to set the insertion point, then hit Enter).
Fuga, bearianditis quatem at omni hicae. Bore 
pre ndi cipsunt, que natem fuga. Ut occulla 
prorias core plit volup taquo teni re.
Voluptatur sum desti ilit ut res as doluptia 
voluptam, offic tet maior ehenis earum velec-
tibus aute nim am, sus aut precto te vellis.
Olorpos explate sam elenditatium estotate eos 
volenihitias ut es aut harchicid magni corrovid 
quidende volorendam ex exero offic tesed unt 
eture, offic to volorem sam eum est, volor sit.
4 Select all the text, then open the Tabs panel; if it’s already open,  
click the magnet icon to snap the ruler to the text frame.  
5 Drag the First-Line Indent marker (the top triangle on the left)  
inward toward the right. Only the first lines will indent. 
6 Drag the Right Indent marker in toward the left; the right side  
of the text will indent itself from the edge of the text frame.
 
 Experiment with the margin: Choose the black Selection tool; single-
click on the text frame. Drag the right edge of the text frame to the 
right, then to the left. Notice that the Right Indent is always the same 
proportional distance from the right edge of the text frame.
7 Get the Type tool again, and drag the Left Indent marker in toward 
the right. Notice it automatically drags the First-Line Indent marker 
with it! This is so the indent and margin remain in proportion. 
 
 To drag the Left Indent marker by itself, hold down the Shift key and 
drag the marker.  
8 Now select individual paragraphs and change the indents.
9 When you can move a marker and predict what will happen, reset  
the indents: Select all the text, then from the Tabs panel menu, 
choose “Reset Indents.”
Your text will look 
something like this.
To get a little extra space 
between the paragraphs, 
use the “Paragraph 
Space After” field  
(see page 55).

  4 :  t a b s  a n d  i n d e n t s

Create a hanging indent
This is a setting you’ll use all the time, where you have something like a 
bullet or a name that begins the line, but you want the text to align with 
the main body copy, not under the bullet. It’s easier than you might think.
1 In a text frame, type something like the lines below. After the bullet, 
hit a tab to start the text.
• 
Lindy Hop developed in the late 1920s from the Charles-
ton. It has an 8-count basic and an emphasis on improvisation. You can 
dance the Lindy Hop to almost every style of music.
• 
Balboa emphasizes quick footwork and a close embrace for 
crowded floors. It is usually danced to fast jazz, though you can Balboa 
to slower tempos.
• 
Jitterbug is actually a term coined by Cab Calloway that 
describes the dancer, not the dance; that is, a jitterbug might dance 
the Lindy Hop, Charleston, Shag, or any other swing dance.
2 Select all the text, then open the Tabs panel; if it’s already open,  
click the magnet icon to snap the panel to the frame.
3 You can see, above, that the first line, beginning with the bullet, starts 
where the Left Indent marker is set, all the way to the left. The text 
begins at the first tab stop, probably the default half-inch mark. What 
we want is for the text, after it bounces off the right edge, to align 
with the first words. All it takes is one small move. 
 
 Hold down the Shift key and drag the Left Indent marker, the lower 
triangle on the left, to about the ¼-inch mark on the ruler. (If a tab 
marker appears, drag it off the ruler and try again.) The Left Indent 
marker acts as the first tab, so everything lines up at once. 
In this example, I also moved the First-Line Indent a wee bit so the 
bullet is closer to the text. 

  4 :  t a b s  a n d  i n d e n t s
85
	
Create a numbered indent
You can see that the setting on the opposite page will work for a numbered 
list, right? Type the number, hit the tab, type the text; after you hit Enter, 
start over again.
But when the list goes above 9 items, the numbers are no longer aligned 
properly. This is a sure sign of unprofessional type. The trick is that you 
must type a tab before the number so it aligns on the right, then type a tab 
after the number to get to the text. 
1 In a text frame, type the first line of the list below. Make sure to hit 
the Tab key before you type the number, as well as after the number.
2 Select all the text, and open the Tabs panel.
3 Click the right-aligned or decimal tab symbol, then click in the ruler 
at about the ¼-inch mark.
4 Hold down the Shift key and drag the Left Indent marker a little way 
past the tab, to its right.
5 Hit a Return or Enter at the end of the first line of text, and carry on 
with typing the rest of the list. Don’t forget those two tabs! 
6 At any point, select all the text and adjust the tab and indent markers 
as necessary.
You can see that when you  
hit Enter, the text goes all  
the way back to the left,  
to the First-Line Indent marker. 
You hit the Tab key and the 
insertion point aligns at the  
tab marker. Type the number.
You hit the Tab key and  
the insertion point jumps 
to the Left Indent marker, 
which doubles as a tab.
When you hit Return,  
it starts over again.

Automatic bullets and numbering
InDesign has a Bullets and Numbering feature that will number a list for you 
automatically. This is enormously helpful because you can rearrange the list, 
add new items, delete items, and the entire list is automatically renumbered.
This feature does not align the numbers appropriately, as shown below-left, 
but this might be a small price to pay when you have a long list. 
	
Use automatic numbering
1 Create a text frame and type the first word or two in a list. 
2 With the insertion point flashing in that first line, go to the  
Type menu and choose “Bulleted & Numbered Lists…,”  
then choose “Apply Numbers.” 
3 The number 1 will appear at the beginning of the line.  
Hit Return or Enter and continue on with your list. 
4 To remove the numbers or switch to a bulleted list, go back to the 
menu and choose the option you want.
5 For more control over the formatting, select all the text in the list. 
From the Paragraph panel menu, choose “Bullets and Numbering,” 
then experiment with the options.
 
 Also use the formatting options you learned in this chapter!
You can fix the issue shown in lines 6, 10, 
and 12: Use the Tabs panel (move the Left 
Indent to align with the tab marker).
The numbers are aligned properly, ones in 
the ones place and tens in the tens place. 
The text is also aligned properly.

Try this!
On this page and the next are examples of things you can do if you know how 
to control your tabs and indents. Use these as exercises to experiment with 
what you know!

This is exactly the same format  
as the hanging indent on 
page 84, except instead of a 
bullet, I placed a graphic at that 
insertion point (see page 219 for 
a brief intro to anchored objects).
As I edit the text, the photos  
flow along in position. 
Also experiment with using 
beautiful ornaments instead  
of bullets. 
There are so many ways to use tabs. In this example, 
I put a right-aligned tab close to the right edge, and 
used two Zapf Dingbats characters as leaders, as 
shown above (I copied and pasted them in). Then  
I simply hit the Tab key, Enter, tab, Enter, tab, Enter, 
etc. I colored the leaders as you would color any text. 

  4 :  t a b s  a n d  i n d e n t s
88
These lines are simply right-
aligned tabs with leaders, which 
creates a perfectly aligned edge 
on the right. 
Instead of creating lines using 
Shift _ across the page, set a 
right-aligned tab at the end of 
the line and type Shift _ into the 
“Leaders” field. Or use a period 
and a space as the leader, and 
then reduce the point size (as 
explained on page 79).
This little piece uses right-aligned 
and decimal tabs. Remember, 
each paragraph can have its own 
ruler settings, so the first line here 
(which is considered a paragraph) 
has different tabs: the first and 
last are right-aligned, the others 
are visually centered over the 
columns.
If you’re feeling confident, add a new column 
between two existing columns, as shown below. 
As long as you remember that the text must 
have a tab in front of it so it will align with the tab 
marker, you can work this out. The tabbed text 
will go exactly where you tell it!

Here are a couple more common uses of the tabs and indents. You already

InDesign’s tables can be gorgeous. You might 
think you don’t need tables, but I guarantee that 
if you work through the tasks in this chapter, 
you will become enamored of tables and their 
possibilities. You will start thinking of work to 
do just so you can create a table to put it in. 
One could write an entire book on the table 
feature in InDesign, but this chapter provides 
just an introduction to get you started. If you 
are a veteran table creator in a program like 
Microsoft Word, tables will make sense to you 
and you will perform wonders. 
Any text you import from Word that includes 
tables will convert to InDesign text and 
tables just fine (you’ll need to do some design 
tweaking). Microsoft Excel data will import into 
tables as well.
There are no individual tasks in this chapter 
because everything builds on what went before. 
So I suggest you start at the beginning and carry 
on to the end, and then you will know how to 
build tables!

When to use a table
Tables are fabulous for when you need to create columns of data, but tabs are 
too limited. You can create an entire project in tables, as shown on the opposite 
page, or you might want to embed a small table into an existing document. 
An embedded table will move with the rest of the text as you edit it.
In a table, text is typed into individual cells, and these cells expand as you type. 
Within a cell you can put any amount of text, graphics, or even other tables. 
You can choose to have a wide variety of borders around individual cells, groups 
of cells, the entire table—or no borders at all. 
A table must be inserted within a text frame; you cannot create a table without 
first creating a text frame.
The text in table cells is not threaded from one cell to the next (as text frames in 
a story are threaded, as you learned in Chapter 2), so you don’t have to worry 
when you edit text in one cell that it will affect the text in any other cell. As 
you add text, the cell grows deeper (not wider, but deeper).
At any point you can go back and format anything in the table, as you will 
see in the following tasks. 
This is the text frame in 
which the table is built.
You can see there are four rows in this table, 
and there are four columns.
Each one of these 
little containers   
(a total of 16 in this 
example) is a cell 
within the table. 
Each cell can have 
its own border, 
text, graphics, and 
background color.

Leading
Because leading in InDesign does not have to apply to the entire 
paragraph, you’ll find it in the Character palette. 
To add or decrease leading to selected text:  
Option DownArrow (add) or Option UpArrow (decrease) 
(If you’re increasing the leading for an entire paragraph,  
be sure to triple-click to select the entire paragraph!)
If you like, you can make the leading apply to the entire paragraph, 
like it does in Quark. (The auto-leading value is in the Justifica-
tion dialog box, found in the Paragraph palette menu.)
Apply auto-leading to selected text: Command Option Shift A
Justified lines
You have a choice of four justified alignments:
With the last line  justified on the left side.
With the last line centered.
With the last line aligned to the right.
With the last line stretched across the paragraph  
to align it both left and right.

Create outlines
To change a single letter to outline, or a word, sentence, or 
paragraph: Select the text with the Text tool. Go to the Type 
menu and choose “Create Outlines.”
To change an entire text block to outlines: Select the frame with the 
Pointer tool. Go to the Type menu and choose “Create Outlines.”
To manipulate the points: Use the white Direct Selection tool.
Drop shadows
To add a drop shadow to type: You have to select the text frame with 
the Pointer tool. Then add a drop shadow as you would  
to a graphic (get “Drop Shadow” from the Object menu). 
Experiment with text and a drop shadow on top of a photograph; 
use the “Mode” menu in the dialog box.
Although you have to select the text with the Pointer tool to add  
the shadow, you can then edit the text and the shadow will 
redraw to match.
Gradient tool
Select the text with the Text tool, then get the Gradient tool. Press-
and-drag the tool over the text. It will use the default gradient.
If you select text with the Pointer tool, the Gradient tool will fill the 
text frame, not the text itself.
OpenType fonts
OpenType fonts are incredibly wonderful. They can have up to 
16,000 characters in one font. Use the Glyph palette to access  
and type with OpenType fonts.

Selecting elements of a table
As you work through the table-building process in the rest of this chapter, refer 
to this page when you need to select the text or cells.
All selections use the Type tool. The only time you’ll use the black Selection 
tool is when you want to move the frame as an object or resize the text frame. 
All cell selections are contiguous (touching); that is, you cannot select one cell 
in the bottom right plus one cell in the upper left at the same time. 
Select the text   
in a cell
With the Type tool, select text as usual: 
• Press-and-drag over the characters
• Double-click to select a word
• Triple-click to select a paragraph
• Press Command A (pc: Control A) to select  
all the text in the cell
Select the cell 
itself
With the Type tool, click in the cell, then hit the Esc key.
Or with the Type tool, press-and-drag from inside  
the cell to the edge.
Select a row
With the Type tool, move the cursor to the left edge of the 
row; the cursor turns into a right-pointing arrow.
With that right-pointing arrow, single-click on the left 
border and the entire row highlights in black.
Select a column 
With the Type tool, move the cursor to the top edge of the 
column; the cursor turns into a down-pointing arrow.
With the down-pointing arrow, single-click on the top edge 
and the entire column highlights in black.
Select more than   
one cell
With the Type tool, press-and-drag from one cell to 
another. The cells will turn black as they are selected.
Select the entire 
table to apply 
table formatting
With the Type tool, single-click anywhere in the table. 
Choose formatting from the Table Options dialog box 
(from the Table menu) or the Table panel.
Select the entire 
table to apply text 
formatting
With the Type tool, move the cursor to the upper-left 
corner; the cursor turns into a one-headed diagonal arrow.
Single-click on the upper-left corner; the entire table, even  
if part of it is on another page, turns black.
Select the table   
to resize it
With  the Type tool, move the cursor to the bottom edge, 
right edge, or bottom-right corner; the cursor turns into a 
double-headed arrow. Press-and-drag inward or outward.

Panels and menus for formatting a table
The most important thing to understand is how to select what you want to 
format, as explained on the opposite page. Once the item is selected properly, 
you can access the table formatting in four different ways, as shown below, 
plus you can use contextual menus with a right-click or Control-click (too 
many options for my pea brain, methinks). Use whichever option feels most 
comfortable to you, or use a combination of them. 
When a cell/s in a table is selected, the Control panel across the top of 
the window displays formatting options. Hover over an item to display 
the tool tip that tells you what it does.
When a cell/s in a table is 
selected, the Control panel 
menu at the far right end of 
the Control panel displays 
table formatting options. 
The Table panel 
is handy to keep 
open when working 
in a table.
The Table menu at 
the top of the window 
is always available. 
Various options are 
available, depending 
on what is selected. 
tip: You can embed a table within a table—
just set your insertion point inside a cell and 
begin a table as usual.

5 :  t a b l e s
94
Settings you choose in the Table Options dialog box apply to the entire table.
Click anywhere in the table to select it, then go to the Table menu and choose 
“Table Options,” then “Table Setup….”
Settings you choose in the Cell options apply to the individual cells that are 
selected. Select a cell or cells, then go to the Table menu and choose “Cell 
Options,” then “Text….” 
Table formatting and cell formatting
You learned in Chapter 2 that there is formatting that applies to the entire 
paragraph (paragraph-specific) and formatting that applies only to the selected 
characters (character-specific). The same is true of a table—there are table-
specific options that will apply to the entire table, and cell-specific options that 
apply only to the selected cells. Selections are made according to the chart on 
the previous page. Poke around in these dialog boxes for a while to familiarize 
yourself with the possibilities.
These options set the 
spacing amount above and 
below a table when you 
have embedded a table 
within your text, as on the 
previous page. This is the 
same as the paragraph 
spacing you learned about 
in Chapter 4.
These options determine 
how close the text is to 
the borders of the cell. 
To set the distances 
individually, click the 
chain-link icon to “break” 
the link between them all.

The following information about how to create and format tables will work most 
easily if you start here at the beginning and work your way through. Everything 
you learn in these tasks will apply to any table you create in the future. 
Let’s build a simple table
There are two ways to build a table: from scratch, and from existing text  (select 
the text, then from the Table menu, choose “Convert Text to Table”). In this 
chapter, we’re going to start from scratch.
1 With the Type tool, create a text frame about four inches across  
and eight inches deep.
2 From the Table menu at the top of the window,  
choose “Insert table….” You’ll see this dialog box:
3 Enter the numbers you see above to create a table with 4 rows,  
4 columns, and 1 header row. 
 
 A header row is a special row that always appears at the top of  
the table. If your table spans several pages, this exact header will 
duplicate itself on each page. 
 
 Click ok. A table appears on your screen with these specifications  
(as shown below), and it is the width of the text frame you created. 
Header row. 
tip: If you have either the black or white 
Selection tool chosen, double-click in the text 
in any cell and it will switch to the Type tool. 

5 :  t a b l e s
96
4 Enter the following information into your table, as shown below. You 
can, of course, enter any other data you prefer: sports teams, music 
groups, your relatives, favorite books, etc., with your own headings in 
the header row. Don’t worry about the text formatting for now, except 
to make sure your font is small enough to fit into the cells (10-point 
should be great). 
 
 If you run out of space, get the black Selection tool, click on the Table 
to show its text frame, and drag the bottom handle on the text frame 
as low as necessary. 
To move the table, drag it with the black Selection tool. 
 
 If you end up with a red dot in a cell and all your text disappears, just 
press on that column edge and drag it to the right.

Format the text in a table
Formatting the text is exactly the same as formatting text on any InDesign 
page: Select the text (see the table on page 92 for a reminder on how to select 
the text) and choose the formatting! When changing the color, select the text 
and then make sure the T is chosen in the Swatches or Color panel.
For now, just choose a font, a size, and a color. We’ll do other stuff later.
For clear communication, we want the text in the header (the first row, because 
we chose to have a header row) to be bolder than the rest, and perhaps in small 
caps. Your table might look something like the one below.
Format the header
Let’s format the header row with a black background fill and white text, as 
shown on the following page. Follow these instructions carefully.
1 With the Type tool, position the cursor on the left edge of the header 
row—it turns into a right-pointing arrow. 
2 Single-click with the right-pointing arrow to select the row.  
The row turns black when selected.
3 In the Swatches panel, make sure the Fill box is selected  
(which it should be, by default). Choose “Black.” 
4 Now click the T in the Swatches panel to change the selection to text; 
choose the “Paper” color. Click outside the table. It should look like 
the example on the following page.

Resize columns and rows
To resize any column or row, press-and-drag the column or row dividing line. 
1 With the Type tool, press on any column edge, then drag left or right.
 
 Or press on any row edge, top or bottom, then drag up or down.
2 You’ll notice that when you drag a column or row edge, the columns to 
the right of or the rows below the one you select move as well. 
 
 To resize just your column or row without dragging another column or 
row along with it, hold down the Shift key and drag the edge. Try it! 
Standardize the column or row sizes
Sometimes you want some or all the columns to be the same width, or some 
or all of the rows to be the same height. This is easy to do, although keep in 
mind it can affect the text flow in the cells.  
1 With the Type tool, drag across the columns that you want to 
standardize or across the rows you want to standardize. You only 
need to select one cell in each of the columns or rows in order to tell 
InDesign which columns or rows you want to affect. 
 
 For instance, in the example above, select the two cells in the middle 
of the bottom row. Because these two cells are in two different 
columns, these are the only columns that will be affected.
2 Go to the Table menu and choose “Distribute Columns Evenly.”
Experiment with distributing rows and columns until you can predict what 
will happen.

Adjust the text frame
The table doesn’t really care whether it is wider or narrow than the text frame, 
but when the table gets to the bottom of the frame, the last row will disappear 
if it doesn’t have enough room. As usual, you’ll see a red plus sign in the Out 
Port of the frame, as shown below:
At that point, get the black Selection tool and adjust the text frame as you 
would any text frame—drag the bottom handle down to deepen the frame, 
or drag it upward to shorten the frame. 
To divide up the table and put part of it on another page, treat it just like a text 
frame (because it is one): With the black Selection tool, shorten the frame, 
click in the Out Port (shown circled, above), and click on another page to set 
the rest of the frame. 
But let’s get back to formatting the table.
Apply color to cells
You probably already know how to change the fill color of a cell: Select the cells 
with the Type tool (see the chart on page 92 for selection tips) and choose a 
color from the Color panel or the Swatches panel. Try it on your table—make 
it look like the one below. Make sure the Fill box is selected before you choose 
the color. 
I selected the left-hand 
column and chose a fill 
color from the Color 
panel. I lightened it to 10 
percent by dragging the 
slider (circled, above).

Add rows at the end of a table as you type
If you are entering your data into a table, simply hit the Tab key at the end of 
the row and it automatically creates a new row with formatting that matches 
the one it came from.
1 Make sure your text frame is deep enough to hold at least two more 
rows. If not, use the black Selection tool to drag the window shade 
handle down a few inches, as you learned in Chapter 2.
2 With the Type tool, click at the end of the text in the last cell.
3 Hit the Tab key. You’ll see that a new row is automatically created.
 
 Fill in the data for this row, as shown below (or make up your own).
4 At the end of that row, hit the Tab key again to start a new row and 
continue on. 
tip: To snap the text frame to the size of the table, click 
on the table with the black Selection tool. Go to the Object 
menu, choose “Fitting,” and then choose “Fit Frame to 
Content.” Learn the keyboard shortcut so you can do it easily.

Add rows or columns anywhere in a table
To add a row or column, first click in the row directly above or below where you 
want to insert a new row, or in a column directly to the left or right of where you 
want to insert a new column. 
1 With the Type tool, click anywhere in the fourth column.
2 From the Table menu, choose “Insert,” and then “Column….”
3 Enter “1” and click the “Right” button. Click ok. 
4 Add a new title in the header: 
 
 With the Type tool, click at the end of the word “Terrain.”  
Then hit the Tab key to move to the next cell. Type “Moon”  
and it will pick up the formatting in the header. 
5 Add the rest of the data:  At the end of entering the data into a cell, 
hit the DownArrow key to send the insertion point into the cell 
directly below, ready for typing the next bit of information. 
 
 (To move the insertion point to the next horizontal cell, hit the Tab 
key instead of the DownArrow.)
Delete rows or columns
Select the rows or columns you want to delete (see page 92 about selecting), 
then press Command Delete (PC: Control Backspace).

As you continue to add data to the table and come to the end of a row, 
hit the Tab key to create the next row. It will automatically pick up the 
fill color in the appropriate rows.
discovery: Make a copy of 
your table and experiment with 
these options for a while! Change 
the colors, try coloring columns, 
use a tint, change the number of 
alternating rows or columns, etc. 
Add a pattern of color to rows or columns
When you have many rows or columns, alternating colors can make the 
information easier to read. InDesign lets you create this effect with the click 
of a button.
1 With the Type tool, click anywhere in the table.
2 From the Table menu, choose “Table Options,” then choose  
“Alternating Fills….”
 
 This opens the “Table Options” dialog, as explained on page 94,  
with the “Fills” pane showing, as shown below.
3 From the “Alternating Pattern” menu, choose “Every Other Row.”
 
 Change “Skip First” to 1 Row. 
 
 Put a check in “Preserve Local Formatting” if you have already 
colored some cells and don’t want them to change. Click ok.

  5 :  t a b l e s
103
More text formatting
Earlier in this chapter you changed the font, the size, and the color of the type 
using the standard character formatting. You can also use leading, paragraph 
spacing, kerning, justification, and everything else you learned in Chapters 
2 and 3. But tables have other special formatting you can take advantage of, 
using the “Cell Options” dialog box that I introduced on page 94. 
To change any settings, be sure the insertion point is flashing within the cell that 
you want to affect, or select all the cells to which you want to apply the setting. 
Then go to the Table menu and choose “Cell Options,” and then “Text….”
To create a small space between the cell border and the text, use the “Cell Insets” 
fields. This moves the text a little away from the border (an example is on page 
108). It’s an option you’ll use regularly. Unclick the chain icon to set different 
amounts in the fields. experiment with this in the table you created: Select a 
column and change the “Cell Inset” for the text. 
To align text left or right, use the Paragraph panel. But to align text vertically 
within the cell, use “Vertical Justification” in the “Cell Options” dialog box. 
experiment with this in the table you created: Select a column and change the 
“Vertical Justification” for the text. For an example, see page 108.
tip: You can start a table within your text; that is, a table does not 
have to stand alone. That way the table will move along with the 
other (non-table) text as you edit. Use the Table Setup dialog box 
as shown on page 94 to set a “Table Spacing” amount above and 
below the table, like paragraph spacing. 

5 :  t a b l e s

Customize the strokes
You can customize the strokes or borders around the cells to your heart’s 
content. Make them bold or invisible, dotted or striped, doubled or wavy, 
any color you like, or even two colors (color the “gap” a different color from 
the line itself). 
Now, selecting the exact stroke so you can change it can be a wee bit tricky 
and crazy-making. Follow these steps to understand how to control them, and 
then you just have to spend time practicing until you can predict the results. 
It’s worth taking the time now so you won’t go crazy later! 
1 To practice, create a small table, 4 rows and 4 columns.
Your table should now look like this. 
2 First, let’s put a border around the table:  
With the Type tool, click inside any cell.  
From the Table menu, choose “Table Options,” then “Table Setup….” 
Under “Table Border,” change the “Weight” to 3 pts. Click ok.
3 Select two cells in the middle, as shown here:
Stroke color.
Cell fill color.
Stroke weight.
Stroke proxy  
(see the 
opposite page).
Stroke type.
4 Get the Stroke panel (if it’s not on your screen, choose it from the 
Window menu), shown on the opposite page.
 
 If your Stroke panel doesn’t look like that one, go to its panel menu 
(click on the tiny hash marks in the upper right of the panel) and 
choose “Show Options.” 
 
 You can also use the settings in the Control panel; they look like this:

  5 :  t a b l e s
105
5 In the Stroke panel, you see the formatting for the selected strokes,  
as shown below. Let’s look at these settings carefully. 
These settings tell me all of the strokes 
in the selected cells are 1 point and 
they are all a solid black line. 
Just what we wanted and expected!
The Stroke panel 
cannot tell us the weight 
and type of stroke that 
is applied because the 
selection includes more 
than one weight and 
more than one type.
This is the proxy, and it displays the lines that are 
in the selection in the table. As you can see here, 
there is an outer border and a vertical line in the 
proxy, just as there is in the selection. 
 
 Any changes you make in the Stroke panel (or changes to the stroke 
color in the Color or Swatches panel) will apply to the strokes bordering 
the selected cells.
Try it: Change the “Weight” to 2 points and the “Type” to a dotted line. 
Click anywhere outside the selected cells to see what it looks like.
6 The tricky part is when you select a cell that has a custom stroke applied 
to one or more of its borders. See what happens: Select the four bottom 
corner cells, and look at the Stroke panel again. 
7 So to change the stroke, you must very carefully choose the lines in the 
proxy that you want to change. In this example, let’s change the crossbar 
strokes in the middle of those four selected cells. Try it:
 
 In the proxy, deselect the four lines around the outside  
(click each one, or double-click one to remove them all).
 
 Select the two crossed lines inside the proxy 
(click each one, or double-click one to select them both).
 
 Choose a dashed line type and a weight of .5 points. 
Ta da! Now practice some more!

Merge and split cells in a table
Tables don’t need to consist of only rows and columns like a spreadsheet—you 
can merge connecting cells to create shapes of all sorts to fit the needs of your 
data. You might want to merge several cells into one so you can insert a graphic 
into the space. Try this:
1 Create a new table, as you did on page 104, but make it 5 rows  
and 3 columns, no header or footer.
2 Select the cells as shown below (press-and-drag over them).
FLEAS
Siphonaptera: Fleas can jump 
200 times their body size, which is 
as if a human jumped about 1200 
feet in the air—imagine jumping 
from the ground and leaping up  
to the 120th floor of a building. 
pablo neruda
ogden nash
jonathan swift
Fleas interest me so much
that I let them bite me for hours.
They are perfect, ancient, Sanskrit,
machines that admit of no appeal.
They do not bite to eat,
they bite only to jump;
they are the dancers of the celestial sphere,
delicate acrobats
in the softest and most profound circus;
let them gallop on my skin,
divulge their emotions,
amuse themselves with my blood,
but someone should introduce them to me.
I want to know them closely,
I want to know what to rely on.
Adam
Had ’em.  
So, naturalists observe, a flea
Has smaller fleas that on him prey;
And these have smaller still to bite ’em,
And so proceed ad infinitum.
Thus ever poet, in his kind,
Is bit by him that comes behind.
3 From the Table menu, choose “Merge Cells.” Those six cells are now 
one cell. 
4 By merging cells, you can easily create tables such as this one:
To insert a graphic, use the 
Type tool and click in the cell.
From the File menu, choose 
“Place….” 
See Chapter 7 for details on 
how to move a graphic, crop it, 
resize it, etc. Everything you 
learn about graphics will apply 
to a graphic within a cell.
tip: Unless you know how 
large the graphic is, it’s a good 
idea to place the graphic on 
the page somewhere, resize 
it to the size you want in the 
table, then cut the graphic 
and paste it into the cell. 
In the example 
below, can you see 
the other place 
where I merged 
two cells?

  5 :  t a b l e s
107
Use a table instead of tabs and indents
In the previous chapter I mentioned that some designers prefer to use tables 
instead of tabs. This is an example of where you could use either method, but 
the table format allows you to colorize columns and structure complex pieces 
of information quite easily.  
If you plan to use numbers in your table, be sure to select those columns and 
give them a flush-right alignment.
To enter the data, use the Tab key to move the text insertion point to the next 
cell, and use Shift Tab to move it backwards to the left. 
The Tab key, as you’ve probably noticed, does not create tabs—it moves the 
insertion point to the next cell. To use a tab setting within a cell, set it up as 
usual (using the Tabs panel) and just remember to type Option Tab in the cell 
when you want to move to a tab marker.

Double Falsehood by Lewis Theobald
I deleted all the 
border lines and 
now it looks so 
neat and tidy.
Here you can see the 
table structure. There 
is nothing in this table 
that you don’t know 
how to do.

Try this!
Below is a table that incorporates many of the tasks you completed in this 
chapter. Can you recreate this—or something like it? Don’t forget you can use 
CreativeCommons.org to find images to use for your project. 
I merged the four cells to 
create one cell for the title.
I created a table with 7 rows and 4 columns, 
with no header or footer.
I set the border in the 
“Table Options” dialog box 
(see page 102). It’s a 2-point 
dotted black border.
I added a graphic into the cells as 
explained on page 106. 
I sized the graphic frames all to 
the same size using the Transform 
panel (page 155) and resized 
the graphic images inside those 
frames with the white arrow 
Direct Selection tool. 
I selected the middle two columns  
and filled them with black. 
I filled the fourth column with a tint of 
another color (see Chapter 8 about tints).
I used the “Cell 
Options” dialog box to 
vertically align the text 
in the center of the 
cells (also in the last 
column). See page 103 
for how to do that.
I used the same dialog 
box to indent the text 
in the first column 9 
points from the right. 
The text in the fourth 
column is centered (using 
the Paragraph panel) and 
is aligned in the center of 
the cell using the “Cell 
Options” dialog box  
(see page 103).

Style  
Sheets
Style sheets allow you to label, or tag, text 
with a style name. That style name calls on the 
style sheet to tell the text exactly what form to 
take. For instance, you might want all headings 
in your 24-page brochure to be 18-point 
Garamond Bold in small caps. So you create 
the style sheet, or definition, and as you build 
the brochure, you apply that style sheet (with 
a click) to all the headings so the formatting 
just appears as you type. Then your boss tells 
you, “No, no! The headings must be 16-point 
Myriad Black.” No need to put a hex on your 
boss—you merely change the style sheet definition 
and all the headings that had that style applied 
will instantly change. 
Style sheets have got to be the most wonderful 
invention since the computer itself—it’s hard 
to imagine living without them. Even on a 
one-page document, style sheets can save time 
and frustration. If you are not using style sheets, 
you are not tapping into the power of InDesign.

A quick example of paragraph style sheets
Paragraph style sheets apply to entire paragraphs, but remember—every 
time you hit a Return or the Enter key, you create a paragraph, which means 
every headline is a paragraph. You can set up paragraph space before and after, 
hyphenation controls, and all other paragraph settings in a style sheet.
Don’t get style sheets confused with type styles. Type styles are things like bold, 
italic, underlined, etc.; you will apply type styles within the style sheet definition. 
Follow the steps below to create and use style sheets!
	
Create a style sheet for body copy
This will be your “Body copy” style sheet for the main text. In the next 
task, you will create a Heading style sheet, and then apply it, and in the 
third task you will change the style sheets to understand why to use them.
1 Open a new, one-page document.
2 Choose the Type tool. Even though there is no text on your page yet, 
choose a readable font and a type size of 10 or 12 point. Make sure the 
alignment is flush left. These are now your defaults.
3 Type the text below, hitting Enter or Return at the end of each heading 
and after the periods you see in the copy.
Balsamic Vinegar
Traditional Italian Balsamic vinegar is 
made from white grapes and is aged in 
wooden barrels for at least twelve to 
twenty-five years.
Apple Cider Vinegar 
Because it is so similar to our stomach 
acids, apple cider vinegar has been used to 
ease stomach ailments and actually creates 
an alkaline reaction in the body. 
Beer Vinegar
Depending on the type of beer used, this 
vinegar tends to be sharp and malty.
4 Open the “Paragraph Styles” panel (you can open it from the Type 
menu if you can’t find it on your screen).
5 There are two main ways to make style sheets: From the dialog box, and 
from type that is already on the page. First, we’re going to make a 
style sheet from type already on the page. 
 
 So single-click in the second paragraph, the one that begins with 
“Traditional Italian Balsamic vinegar is . . . .”

  6 :  s t y l e  s h e e t s
111
6 In the Paragraph Styles panel, shown below, single-click the  
Create new style icon at the bottom of the panel.
 
 This creates a new style sheet called “Paragraph Style 1.”  
(If you already have a number of style sheets listed in that panel, you 
might not see this new one until you scroll through the list.)
7 Double-click on “Paragraph Style 1” to open the style sheet 
specifications dialog box, as shown below. 
8 Name this style sheet “Description.”
 
 Notice that the style sheet has picked up the formatting from  
the paragraph in which you had the insertion point flashing. 
9 Add an extra point to the “Leading” value, both to open up the 
linespacing a bit and to make sure it’s not using Auto leading. 
 
 Use the Tabs pane to move both of the left indent markers about  
a quarter inch to the right, which will indent the text.
10 Click ok when you’re done. Now let’s make the Heading style sheet 
by going straight to the dialog box and choosing attributes (on the 
following page).
—continued
Click on this little ridged 
mark to open the panel 
menu for more options. 

  6 :  s t y l e  s h e e t s
112
	
Create a style sheet for the headings
I assume you completed the previous exercise to create the “Description”   
style sheet. This new one will be your “Heading” style sheet. If the 
description copy is a serif typeface, try a bold sans serif for the headings. 
1 Open the Paragraph Styles panel, if it isn’t already.
2 Choose the black Selection tool and click on a blank spot on the page, 
just to make sure no text or text frame is selected. 
3 Click the “Basic Paragraph” style at the top of the pane.  
(The new style sheet picks up the formatting from the selected  
style sheet. Later you will use this to your advantage.)
 
 From the panel menu, choose “New Paragraph Style….”
 
 You’ll get the same dialog box as on the previous page, but this time 
it’s not picking up the formatting of any selected text. It is, however, 
picking up the formatting of any style sheet in the list that may have 
been selected, which in this case is “Basic Paragraph.” That’s okay for 
now, or click the “Reset to Base” button. 
4 Name this style sheeting “Heading.”
5 Select “Basic Character Formats” from the pane on the left;  
choose a bold sans serif font for the heading.
 
 Choose a font size. (Since sans serifs are generally larger than serif 
fonts, you probably don’t need to make it any larger.)
 
 Select “Indents and Spacing” and add about 8 points of space  
in the “Space Before” field (as explained in Chapter 4). You can type 
in 0p8, no matter what the current measurement system it’s using.
6 Check the other specs to see what your options are and to make sure 
there is no unnecessary formatting that you don’t want. Click ok.
If you see a list of settings 
in this box that you don’t 
want or don’t know what 
they are, click the button, 
“Reset to Base.”

Balsamic Vinegar
Traditional Italian Balsamic vinegar 
is made from white grapes and is 
aged in wooden barrels for at least 
twelve to twenty-five years.
Apple Cider Vinegar 
Because it is so similar to our 
stomach acids, apple cider vinegar 
has been used to ease stomach 
ailments and actually creates an 
alkaline reaction in the body. 
Beer Vinegar
Depending on the type of beer 
used, this vinegar tends to be sharp 
and malty.
	
Apply the style sheets
Now you have two new styles in your Paragraph Styles panel, called 
“Description” and “Heading.” You need to apply them to the text. 
1 Select the Type tool.
2 Single-click in the “Balsamic Vinegar” heading.
 
 From the Paragraph Styles panel, single-click on the “Heading”  
style sheet. It should instantly change to the formatting you selected 
in Step 2. (If you see a plus sign in the style sheet name, that means 
there is an override; hold down the Shift and Option/Alt keys and 
click on the style sheet again. See page 124.)
3 Repeat the above steps to apply the Heading style sheet to the other two 
vinegar headings.
4 Single-click in the first paragraph of text under the first heading. 
 
 From the Paragraph Styles panel, single-click on “Description.” 
 
 Repeat the above steps to apply the Description style sheet to the 
other two paragraphs. Your text should look something like this:
 
 Now the best is yet to come. Not only do style sheets help keep your 
formatting consistent in your document, but they make it incredibly 
efficient to make changes and fine-tune your typography.
 
 Carry on to the next page!
—continued

  6 :  s t y l e  s h e e t s
114
	
Fine-tune the style sheets
This is the part that is so incredibly great about style sheets. Let’s say that 
the short piece you just created is actually a 12-page catalog with hundreds 
of listings, and your boss tells you to change the color and the size of the 
heading font throughout the entire document. 
All you need to do is change the definition, the formatting specifications, 
of the style sheet. Every paragraph to which you had applied that style sheet 
reformats instantly. 
1 From the Paragraph Styles panel, double-click the “Heading” style 
sheet name.
2 In the dialog box that opens, change the font, the color, the size,  
or whatever you want.
3 If the “Preview” box in the bottom-left corner is not checked,  
check it so you can view the changes.
4 When you’re finished making changes, click ok. 
5 Follow the steps above to change the formatting for “Description.”
 
 Your text should look something like the one below. Your specs are 
different, of course, but the point is that all the text reformatted when 
you changed the style sheet definition. 
Balsamic Vinegar
Traditional Italian Balsamic vinegar is 
made from white grapes and is aged 
in wooden barrels for at least twelve to 
twenty-five years.
Apple Cider Vinegar 
Because it is so similar to our stomach 
acids, apple cider vinegar has been 
used to ease stomach ailments and 
actually creates an alkaline reaction in 
the body. 
Beer Vinegar
Depending on the type of beer used, 
this vinegar tends to be sharp and 
malty.
tip: To create a new color while you’re in the process of making 
a new style sheet, Option–double-click (PC: Alt–double-click) on 
the color box  in the upper-left of the Character Color pane. 

  6 :  s t y l e  s h e e t s
115
The basic steps to create style sheets
If you followed the steps on the previous pages, you created style sheets using 
the two basic methods:
• Format a paragraph the way you want it to be, then create the 
style sheet based on that formatting: 
With the Type tool, click in the formatted paragraph.
From the Paragraph Styles panel menu, choose “New 
Paragraph Style….” 
Name the new style, then click ok. 
Apply the style to selected paragraphs. 
• Create a new paragraph style from scratch:
From the Paragraph Styles panel menu,  
choose “New Paragraph Style….” 
Name the new style. 
Select options in the side panel and make your  
formatting choices. 
When finished, click ok.
Apply the style to selected paragraphs.
Everything you see in this entire book has style sheets applied, including the 
graphics (see Chapter 7 about “object styles”). For book-length projects such 
as this one where every chapter is a different file, InDesign lets me synchronize 
the style sheets across the files and import individual style sheets from any 
other InDesign document. When you import a word processing document 
in which you’ve used style sheets, InDesign adds those to the Paragraph Styles 
panel (see pages 126–127 for details about importing Microsoft Word files).
tip: To end a line but not create a new paragraph, 
use Shift Return or Shift Enter. The line will break, 
but it won’t pick up all the paragraph formatting, 
such as space before or after, Next Style, etc. This 
 is called a soft Return.

  6 :  s t y l e  s h e e t s
116
tip: Choosing a “Next Style” does not change 
any text that is already on the page—it only 
applies as you’re in the process of typing.
Take advantage of “Next Style”
If you’re typing your text directly into InDesign, you can take advantage of 
this great feature where the text automatically becomes a new style after you 
hit a Return or the Enter key. 
For instance, use the text and the style sheet you created on pages 110–114 for 
the following exercise.
	
Add a “next style” to the existing style sheets
1 In the Paragraph Styles panel, double-click on the “Heading” style 
sheet you made earlier.
2 In the “General” pane that appears, find the “Next Style” pop-up 
menu; choose the “Description” style sheet you created earlier. 
 
 Click ok.
3 In the Paragraph Styles panel, double-click on the “Description” style.
4 In the “General” pane that appears, from the “Next Style” pop-up 
menu, choose the “Heading” style sheet. 
 
 Click ok.
	
Continue typing in the text
1 Get the text sample that you created earlier. 
 
 With the black Selection tool, enlarge the size of the text frame  
so it will easily hold more type. 
2 Get the Type tool. 
 
 Click at the end of the last paragraph in that text frame.
3 Hit Enter or Return and type a new heading. It should be 
automatically formatted in the “Heading” style sheet!
4 At the end of the heading, hit Enter or Return and type a description. 
The text should appear in the “Description” formatting. 
 
 Hit Enter or Return at the end of the description text and type a new 
heading, repeating the process over and over.
The trick to using “Next Style,” obviously, is that you have to have the style 
sheets created so you can choose them. 

  6 :  s t y l e  s h e e t s
117
Here is another example of when the “Next Style” feature is useful. Let’s say 
you’re working on a newsletter and as you enter the text, you typically type 
a subhead, hit Enter, type the first paragraph which does not have an indent 
(because first paragraphs should not be indented), then you type the next 
paragraph which does have an indent. That makes three style sheets: one for 
the Subhead, one for the First Paragraph, and one for the Body Copy. 
	
Try another example of using “Next Style”
1 Create the Body Copy style sheet and include an indent  
(use either the “Indents and Spacing” pane or the “Tabs” pane  
for the indent). For “Next Style,” choose “Same Style.” Click ok.
2 In the Paragraph Styles panel, single-click to select “Body Copy,”  
then from the panel menu, choose “New Paragraph Style….”
3 Name this “Body Copy First Paragraph.”
 
 Because “Body Copy” was chosen in the panel before you made this 
new style, this new style is automatically based on “Body Copy” and 
holds all the same formatting. 
 
 So in this new style sheet, delete the indent, which will be the only 
difference from “Body Copy.” 
 
 From the “Next Style” pop-up menu, choose “Body Copy.” Click ok.
4 Create a new style sheet, and name this one “Subhead.”
 
 From the “Based on” pop-up menu, choose “No paragraph style.”
 
 Format it as you wish, perhaps a bold sans serif. 
 
 From the “Next Style” pop-up menu, choose “Body Copy First 
Paragraph.” Click ok.
	
Now type the text
1 Create a new text frame.
2 Choose the paragraph style called “Subhead”; type a short subhead  
and hit Enter or Return.
3 Type the first paragraph—notice the style changed and it is now  
“Body Copy First Paragraph”; hit Enter or Return.
4 Type the next couple of paragraphs—notice the style automatically 
changed to “Body Copy.” The Body Copy text will continue in the 
same style until you manually choose another.

Be careful with the “Based On” feature!
The option to base one style sheet on another can be great, as long as you 
are clear about what will happen. The basic idea is this: Let’s say you have a 
newsletter. For the body copy, you create a Body Copy style sheet that uses 
Garamond Regular, 11/14. For the captions, you create a Captions style sheet 
that is based on the Body Copy style sheet, but it uses Garamond Italic, 9/10. 
For the headlines, you create a Headlines style sheet that is based on the Body 
Copy style sheet, but it uses Garamond Bold 13/18.
Now let’s say your client tells you she doesn’t want to use Garamond; she 
wants you to change the font to Minion. All you need to do is change Body 
Copy to Minion Regular—the other styles that are based on Body Copy will 
change as well. The Captions will automatically change to Minion Italic and 
the Headlines to Minion Bold. They will maintain the specifications you set 
up that were different; that is, the Captions will still be 9/10 and the Headlines 
will still be 13/18. This is great!
The problem arises when you don’t realize that you based StyleB on StyleA,  or 
you didn’t know what you were doing or you forget that you did that. Then 
when you change StyleA, you’re surprised when StyleB changes as well! 
It is safest to only base one style on another when you are really clear about 
exactly why you are doing it and what the consequences might be. At any 
time, of course, you can change StyleB so it is no longer based on StyleA, but 
that’s a painful waste of time. Although, it will teach you not to do it again.
	
Base one style on another
1 In the Paragraph Styles panel, create a new style (as explained  
on page 115 or pages 110–112). 
 
 Make sure the new style is not based on any style: In the “Based 
On” pop-up menu in the panel, choose “No paragraph style.” You 
might also want to click the “Reset to Base” button to get rid of any 
previous formatting.
 
 Name this style “Headline,” and make it something like Calibri Bold 
(a sans serif), 18-point text with 20-point leading. Click ok.
2 In the Paragraph Styles panel, single-click on your new style, “Headline.” 
From the panel menu, choose “New Paragraph Style.”
 
 Call this one “Subhead.” Notice it is already based on “Headline” 
because that is the style you had selected when you chose to make a 
new style. 

  6 :  s t y l e  s h e e t s
119
 
 Change the font size to 12 point, the leading value to 14, and make it 
Calibri Regular. Click ok.
3 If you still have the “Body copy” style sheet you created on page 96,  
skip to Step 4; if not, make a quick “Body copy” style sheet.
4 Okay. Now create a text frame and type something like the piece  
shown below, left.
5 When finished, open the “Headline” style sheet. Change the font to 
a serif face, such as Garamond or Georgia. Also change the color to 
something noticeable, such as bright blue or red. Click ok. 
6 Your sample should have changed similar to the one below, right. 
The Body copy should not change because it was not based on the 
Headline, but the Subheads should reflect the font and color changes.  
 
 Can you imagine how this could mess up your entire project if you 
randomly base style sheets on other style sheets?
Mosaic Tiles
There is a wide variety of mosaic tiles 
available for creating projects galore. 
Explore the possibilities with the set 
provided in this special box.
Smalti
Smalti is the handmade glass used 
in the mosaics of medieval and 
Renaissance Europe. Molten glass is 
poured onto a slab for cooling, and 
then cut by hand into tiny, irregular 
pieces. The colors never fade.
Pebbles
Pebble mosaics are especially useful 
in high traffic areas, such as in 
parks, on walkways, or even in a 
busy, urban street. 
Millefiori
Millefiori are tiny, round, 
ornamental glass pieces cut from 
glass rods of fused colors. Use them 
to create patterns amongst a field of 
plainer tiles.

Create and use character styles
Character styles function in exactly the same way as paragraph styles, except 
they apply only to selected characters, not to the entire paragraph. You can 
choose basic text formatting, such as font, style, size, color, kerning or tracking 
values, and more. 
Just like paragraph styles, once you have applied the styles to text, you can 
change the style sheet definition and all instances of that character style 
throughout the document will change. It’s miraculous. You’ve seen a lot of 
character styles throughout this book—the numbers of the steps in the tasks, 
the bullets, the task headings, etc. The bold sans serif that begins the paragraph 
above is a character style—all I did was select the text, then click the name of 
the style and voilà, the formatting changed. If I want to make all those bold 
words in this whole chapter a bright pink color, all it would take is a click in 
the style sheet definition. 
	
Create a character style
1 Open the Characters Styles panel.
2 From the panel menu, choose “New Character Style….”
3 Name the style something that will tell you what it will be used for.
4 Make sure “Based On” is “None” (for this example, anyway).
5 Click each of the options in the side pane and make your formatting 
choices. You don’t have to make a choice for every item—you might 
only have one or two formatting specifications. Anything you leave 
blank will be picked up by the paragraph formatting. 
 
 For instance, perhaps you want to highlight words in your report in 
bold magenta. In your character style, only change the “Font Style” 
to Bold and the “Character Color” to magenta. Do that for this task, 
and click ok. 
	
Apply a character style
1 Select text in a paragraph.
2 Click the style name you just created. That’s it!
To remove any character style, select the formatted text, go to the 
Character Styles panel, and choose “None.”

Oh boy—nested styles!
Nested styles are really amazing. Once you make a character style or two, 
you can set up a paragraph style that automatically applies a character style at 
certain points. For instance, when I type a task heading, as on the opposite 
page, the first words automatically appear in a tint of the blue color and in 
small caps; when I hit the Tab key, the formatting automatically changes to 
the paragraph style sheet. 
You’re not limited to using only one character style—you can use many, surely 
more than you’ll ever want to use in one paragraph. 
If you’re feeling confident in your ability to create style sheets that include tabs, 
indents, spacing, etc., let’s create a nested style that creates the format shown 
below; it is created automatically as you type.
	
Sun’s Day: The Sun is personified as a goddess.
	
Create a nested style sheet
1 First, you need to create a character style sheet. 
 
 Create one new character style sheet called “Red Day.” Make it a 
sans serif bold font, 9 point, 10.2 leading, small caps. Choose a color 
of your choice (if you know how to create colors, as explained in 
Chapter 11, double-click on the color swatch in the “Character Color” 
section to create a new swatch). 
2 Now create the paragraph style sheet. 
 
 Name it “Days of week.” Choose a serif font, 10/12, left alignment, 
paragraph “Space After” of 0p4 (in the “Indents and Spacing” pane,  
as on page 112). Set the left indent marker at 5 picas, as shown below.
Drag the bottom marker, 
which is the Left Indent 
marker, to the 5-pica mark in 
the ruler. This will make the 
indented text align, as shown 
on the following page.   
—continued
3 Click on “Drop Caps and Nested Styles” in the left pane.

  6 :  s t y l e  s h e e t s
122
4 Click the button, “New Nested Style.” 
 
 This puts a pop-up menu in the “Nested Styles” pane, as shown below. 
Click on it to choose your character style named “Red Day.”
 
 Recreate the settings you see below (“through 1” and “Tab 
Characters”). This tells the style sheet to use that character style  
until you hit the first Tab key. Click ok. 
The English days of the week preserve the original pagan associations 
(except Saturday, which is of Roman origin).
	
Sun’s Day: The Sun is personified as a goddess.
	
Moon’s Day: The Moon is personified as a god.
	
Tiw’s Day: Tiw, or Tyr, is a Norse god similar to Mars,  
the Roman god of war.
	
Woden’s Day: Woden, or Odin, is a Norse psychopomp.
	
Thor’s Day: Thor is the god of thunder.
	
Frige’s Day: Frige is an Anglo-Saxon love goddess.
	
Saturn’s day: Named after the Roman god Saturn,  
god of agriculture and harvest.
Spend a couple of minutes 
perusing this list of options. 
The character style will appear 
until you type one or more of 
these items. The item itself will 
be included in the character 
style depending on whether 
you choose “through” or  
“up to.”
Click in this field to make 
the menu arrows appear.
5 Create a text frame and choose the paragraph style, “Days of week.”
 
 Type the list below, typing the day of the week in all lowercase  
(the intro paragraph, obviously, has a different paragraph style!).  
Hit a Tab after the name of each day. Ta da!
The left indent marker you set at 5 picas (in Step 2) 
is what makes the text line up at this point.

Saturn’s day: Named after the Roman god Saturn,

6 If you’re feeling sassy, create a second character style called  
“Blue Deity.” Make it the same sans serif, bold, 9/10.2.  
Choose (or create and choose) a teal color. 
 
 Add it to the same paragraph style, “Days of week.” 
 
 Make the second character style begin after you type a colon. 
 
 All the text with that paragraph style applied will automatically 
change. Amazing.
Here are some other tips about the nested styles and drop caps.
E
xperiment with the Drop 
Caps feature. It creates a 
large initial cap, as shown 
here. To apply a drop cap to a 
single paragraph instead of to  
the paragraph style, click in  
a paragraph and then choose 
“Drop Caps and Nested Styles” 
from the Paragraph panel menu.
To move a nested 
character style up or 
down in the appearance 
order, select it, then click 
one of these buttons. 
To make a character style appear for a 
certain number of entire lines, add it here 
and choose the number of lines.

Know your overrides
Even though you’ve applied style sheets to just about everything, you can still 
change selected characters. For instance, this paragraph you’re reading has a 
“Body copy” style applied, but I can make selected characters italic. This is called 
an override, where I override the basic settings. You can override everything. 
InDesign considers a character style, such as the bold in the previous sentence, 
also an override, but recognizes it is a character style. 
When you select an entire paragraph (triple-click in it) and see a + sign in 
the style name in the panel, as shown below, that means there is at least one 
override in that paragraph. Sometimes you don’t know even how they got there. 
There are many ways to get rid of overrides, depending on what they are and 
what you want to do, but I’m just going to mention the two most useful. Check 
the Adobe Help files for all the complex ways of clearing local formatting!
discovery: Also experiment with contextual 
menus—right-click on a selected style name in 
the panel to see what your options are!
Hover over a style sheet that 
displays a + sign, and a tool 
tip appears to tell you what the 
override is and how to clear it.
When a paragraph is selected that has 
overrides in it, the Clear Override button 
is available. Hover to read its message. 
Keyboard shortcuts to remove overrides: With the Type tool, single-click in a 
paragraph, or press-and-drag to select more than one.

Tips for style sheets
Here are some tips that make using style sheets even easier:
• Give the style sheet a name that tells you what it does.  
That is, don’t randomly name them things like Body 1 and 
Body 2, or New Headline and Newer Headline. Be specific  
so you know exactly what you’ll be getting.
• Name the styles in related groups. For instance, if you have a 
quiz included in your handouts document, name the style sheets 
pertinent to that portion, something like Quiz Headings, Quiz 
Questions, Quiz Answers, etc. This way you can group them 
together in the panel so you can find them easily. 
• Assign keyboard shortcuts to the styles you use the most:  
In the Style Options for either paragraph or characters styles,  
go to the “General” pane and click in the “Shortcut” field.  
Hold down the Command, Option, or Shift key (PC: Control, 
Alt, or Shift), then tap a number on the numeric keypad. You must 
use the numeric keypad for this—if your keyboard doesn’t have 
one, you can’t create a shortcut. Dang.
If you hear a beep when you try to type the shortcut, that means 
your Num Lock is not on. Cancel the dialog box, and turn on 
Num Lock (even if you don’t have a Num Lock key, the Clear key 
usually acts as one). Try again. 
• When placing or pasting text, choose a style sheet before placing or 
pasting, and the text will appear on the page in that style.  
This is a particularly great feature. 
• If you start typing with a style sheet and the text appears in 
completely different formatting from what you specified, it 
somehow grabbed some overrides. To fix this, use the keyboard 
shortcut on the opposite page to “Clear local formatting and 
character styles.” Also, click in an empty spot (not in a text  
frame) and then clear the overrides when nothing is selected;  
this prevents the problem from happening again.
tip: At any point you can remove the style sheet 
from the text without removing the formatting. 
Select the text, go to the panel menu, and choose 
“Break Link to Style.”

Import style sheets along with a Word doc
If you use Microsoft Word, either you know how to use your style sheets, or 
you just type away and style sheets (some that include settings such as “Next 
Style”) are automatically applied for you (which I find really annoying). 
When you place a Word doc into InDesign, the default is set so Word’s style 
sheets are added to your Paragraph Styles panel. You’ll know they’re there 
because the panel displays old-fashioned floppy disk icons next to each imported 
style sheet name, as shown below. 
These silly icons tell you these styles 
came in with the file you imported. 
As soon as you edit a style sheet, this 
icon disappears, indicating the style is 
now an official InDesign style sheet.
Imported style sheets in InDesign
If a style sheet in Word is named exactly the same as a style sheet in your 
InDesign file, InDesign’s style takes over. For instance, the panel you see above 
included a style sheet named “Heading 1,” so when the Word style sheet was 
imported along with the text, my InDesign style sheet applied its settings to 
every paragraph tagged with “Heading 1.” This is great for me.  :-)
Any style sheets in the Word doc that don’t find the exact name in the panel 
are imported and added to your panel. This is also great because it doesn’t really 
matter what the original formatting was—once it is tagged and in InDesign, 
you can format the entire document so easily. 
More control over importing style sheets
Occasionally, however, someone has monkeyed with the defaults and weird 
things happen when you import a Word file, or perhaps the defaults simply 
don’t do just what you want. For instance, you might have spent a lot of time 
in Word creating exactly the style sheets you need for this project, and you want 
to make sure those don’t get overridden when you import the file to InDesign. 
In that case, follow the steps below.

  6 :  s t y l e  s h e e t s
127
Customize the import and map the style sheets
1 In the InDesign file, go to the File menu and choose “Place….” 
2 Check the box in the lower-left of the Place window to “Show Import 
Options.”
3 Find and double-click the Word document that you want to import.
4 In the “Microsoft Word Import Options” dialog box that appears, 
carefully read the options and make decisions about the incoming file.
5 Click “Customized Style Import,” and then click “Style Mapping….”
 
 In the “Style Mapping” dialog box that appears (shown below), click 
on the InDesign style on the right that matches up with the Word 
style; this pops up a menu. 
This is the standard default.
Click here to remap the incoming styles.
 
 To maintain the imported Word style, choose “Redefine InDesign 
Style.” This forces the InDesign’s style sheet to reformat itself 
according to the Word style.   
To format the imported style sheet with the InDesign style, 
choose an existing InDesign style. 
 
 To rename the Word style, choose “Auto Rename.”
6 To close the “Style Mapping” dialog box, click ok, and then click ok 
in the main dialog box (far above) to finish importing the file.

Try This! 
Where style sheets really shine is in longer documents (although I end up using 
style sheets on everything). Recreate the project you see below, using style sheets 
for each different formatting. 
A handy resource for lots of copyright-free text to work with is:
http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top
Just choose a story on the Gutenberg site (with grateful appreciation), copy 
a bunch of text, and add your own headlines and subheads to divide it into 
sections. Take advantage of everything you have learned about tabs and indents, 
leading, paragraph spacing, kerning, etc.   
The text in the project below is from How to Analyze People on Sight Through the 
Science of Human Analysis: The Five Human Types, 1921, by Elsie Lincoln Benedict, 
available on the Gutenberg site (I did a little editing on the text below).
Whenever you are considering your fitness for any vocation, 
ask yourself the following questions.
Self-Question 1
Am I considering this vocation chiefly because I would 
enjoy the things it would bring—such as salary, fame, social 
position or change of scene? If, in your heart, your answer 
is “Yes,” this is not a vocation for you. 
The Movie Hopeful
The above test can best be illustrated by the story of a young 
woman who wanted to be told that she had ability to act.  
“I am determined to go into the movies,” she told us. “Do 
you think I would be a success?”
We asked, “When you picture yourself in this profession 
what do you see yourself doing?” 
“Oh, everything wonderful,” she replied. “I see myself 
driving my own car—one of those cute little custom-made 
ones, you know—and wearing the most stunning clothes 
and meeting all those big movie stars—and living all the 
year round in California!”
“Is that all you ever see yourself doing?” we inquired.
“Yes—but isn’t that enough?”
“All but one—the acting.”
She then admitted that in the eight years she had been 
planning to enter the movies she had never once really 
visualized herself acting, or studying any part, or doing any 
work—nothing but rewards and emoluments.
Self-Question 2
Knowing the requirements of this vocation—its tasks, 
drudgeries, hours of work, concentration and kind of 
activity—would I choose to follow them in preference to 
any other kind of activity even if the income were the same?
Pleasure or Pay
Would I do these things for the pleasure of doing them and 
not for the pay?
If, in your heart, you can answer “Yes” to these questions, 
your problem is settled; you will succeed in that vocation. 
For you will so enjoy your work that it will be play. Being 
play, you will do it so happily that you will get from it new 
strength each day.
Because you are doing what you were built to do, you 
will think of countless improvements, inventions, ways of 
marketing. This will promote you over the others who are 
there only for the pay envelope; it will raise your salary;  
it will eventually and inevitably take you to the top.
A man we know aptly illustrates this point. He was a 
bookkeeper. He had held the same position for twenty-three 
years and was getting $125 a month. He had little leisure 
but used all he did have—evenings, Saturday afternoons, 
Sundays and his ten-day vacations—making things.
In that time he had built furniture for his six-room house—
every kind of article for the kitchen, bathroom. and porch. 
And into everything he had put little improving touches 
such as are not manufactured in such things.
We convinced him that his wife was not the only woman 
who would appreciate these step-saving, work-reducing, 
leisure-giving conveniences. He finally believed it enough 
to patent some of his inventions, and today he is a rich man.
Self-Question 3
One more question will shed much light on the matter 
of your talents. Here it is: Do I tend to follow, of my 
own accord, for the sheer joy of it, the kinds of activity 
demanded by this vocation which I am contemplating?
If you do not you will never succeed in this line of work.
Thought it Would Do Him Good
One incident will serve to illustrate the foregoing test. A 
young man asked us if he could succeed as a public speaker. 
He had decided to become a lecturer and had spent two 
years studying for that work.
“Do you enjoy talking? Do you like to explain and 
expatiate? When out with others do you furnish your share 
of the conversation or a little more?” were the questions we 
put to him. To all of the questions he answered “No.”
“But I thought this was just the line of work I ought to 
go into,” he explained. “I have always been diffident and I 
thought the training would do me good.”
Life Pays the Producer
Expecting the world to pay you handsomely while 
remaking you is short-sighted, to say the least. The public 
schools are free, like Life’s education, but you don’t get a 
salary for attending them.
To be a success you must produce something out of the 
ordinary for the world. And you will produce nothing 
unusual save what you were built to produce. To know what 
this is, classify the kind of activities you take to naturally. 
You can be a star in some line that calls for those activities. 
You will never succeed in any calling that demands the 
opposite kinds of activities or reactions.
How to Test Yourself
“Fame and Failure”
The masses of mankind form a vast pyramid. At the very 
tip-top peak are gathered the few who are famous. In the 
bottom layer are the many failures. Between these extremes 
lie all the rest—from those who live near the ragged edge of 
Down-and-Out-Land to those who storm the doors of the 
House of Greatness.
Again, between these, and making up the large majority, 
is the myriad of laborers, clerks, small business owners, 
housekeepers—that myriad-headed mass known as “the 
back bone of the world.”
Yet the great distance from the lower layer to the tip-top 
peak is not insurmountable. Many have covered it almost 
overnight.
A Favorite Fallacy
For fame is not due, as we have been led to believe, solely 
to years of plodding toil. A thousand years of labor could 
never have produced an Edison, a Marconi, a Madame 
Curie, a Rockefeller, a Roosevelt, a Wilson, a Grace Hopper, 
a Ford, an Alice Paul, a Carpentier, a Mary Pickford, a 
Caruso, a Spencer, or a Mary Edwards Walker.
Fame’s Foundation
The reserved seat in the tip-top peak of the pyramid is 
procured only by him who has found his real vocation.
To such a one her work is not hard. No hours are long 
enough to tire her body; no thought is difficult enough to 
weary her mind; to her there is no day and no night, no 
quitting time, no Saturday afternoons and no Sundays. She 
is at the business for which she was created—and all is play.
Edison Sleeps Four Hours
Thomas A. Edison so loves his work that he sleeps an 
average of less than four hours of each twenty-four. When 
working out one of his experiments he forgets to eat, cares 
not whether it is day or night, and keeps his mind on his 
invention until it is finished.
Yet he has reached the age of seventy-four with every 
mental and physical faculty doing one hundred per cent 
service—and the prize place in the tip-top peak of the 
Wizards of the World is his! He started at the very bottom 
layer, an orphan newsboy. He made the journey to the 
pinnacle because early in life he found his vocation.
Failures Who Became Famous
Each one of the world’s great successes was a failure first.
It is interesting to note the things at which some of them 
failed. Darwin was a failure at the ministry, for which he 
was educated. Herbert Spencer was a failure as an engineer, 
though he struggled years in that profession. Abraham 
Lincoln was such a failure at thirty-three as a lawyer that 
he refused an invitation to visit an old friend “because,” he 
wrote, “I am such a failure I do not dare to take the time.”
Babe Ruth was a failure as a tailor. Josephine Baker lived 
as a street child and scavenged in garbage cans. Nathaniel 
Hawthorne was a failure as a Custom House clerk when he 
wrote The Scarlet Letter. Grace Hopper was born a woman 
in 1906 yet became a Rear Admiral in the U. S. Navy and 
pioneered in computers. Theodore Roosevelt was a failure 
as a cowboy in North Dakota. 
These people were failures because they tried to do things 
for which they were not intended. But each at last found 
their work, and when they did, it was so easy for them it 
made them famous.
Play, Not Work, Brings Fame
Fame comes only to the person who loves her work so well 
that it is not work but play. It comes only to she who does 
something with marvellous efficiency. Work alone can not 
produce that kind of efficiency.
Outdistancing Competition
Fame comes from doing one thing so much better than 
your competitors that your results stand out above and 
beyond the results of all others. Any person who will do 
efficiently any one of the many things the world is crying 
for can place his own price upon his work and get it. He 
can get it because the world gladly pays for what it really 
wants, and because the efficient person has almost no 
competition.
Efficiency Comes from Enjoyment
But here’s the rub. You will never do anything with that 
brilliant efficiency save what you like to do. Efficiency 
does not come from duty, or necessity, or goading, or 
lashing, or anything under heaven save enjoyment of 
the thing itself.
Nothing less will ever release those hidden powers, those 
miraculous forces which, for the lack of a better name, we 
call “genius.”
 Knowing What are Not Your Vocations
Elimination of what are distinctly not your vocations will 
help you toward finding those that are. To that end here 
are some tests which will clear up many things for you. 
They will help you to know especially whether or not the 
vocations you have been contemplating are fitted to you.

sexier than text. And InDesign 
has lots to offer in this area. In 
fact, as packed as this section is 
with things to do, there is more 
that just couldn’t fit in. But I 
hope you take some of these 
techniques and ideas and really 
explore the possibilities beyond 
these pages!

A man who works with  
his hands is a laborer;  
a man who works with  
his hands and his brain  
is a craftsman.  
But a man who works  
with his hands  
and his brain  
and his heart  
is an artist.
Louis Nizer, attorney and artist, 1902–1994

All About 
Graphics
Well, certainly not all about graphics, 
but enough to get you started and keep 
you busy for a while. 
InDesign has added more and more 
graphic capabilities to its page layout 
features. If you are an Illustrator user, 
you’ll find the drawing tools are very 
similar, though more limited. If you 
are a Photoshop user, you’ll be pleased 
to see how quickly you can pop into 
Photoshop from InDesign to adjust 
your images. And if you’ve never used 
any of Adobe’s Creative Suite before, 
you will be astounded at what you can 
do with your unleashed creativity.

Graphic formats
The short story: Use pdf, .ai, .psd, or .tif for graphics to be printed (although 
you can get away with .jpg files on your small desktop printer). Scan images 
as tiffs. You can actually place another InDesign file onto an InDesign page.
Avoid pict, wmf, bmp, png, and only use eps and dcs if you know what you’re 
doing and have no choice.  
Vector files from Illustrator
When saving an .ai file in Illustrator, make sure the box is checked to “Create 
pdf Compatible File” in the options when you save the file or InDesign won’t 
be able to read it. Avoid eps files, if you can, only because they are an old 
technology and not as dependable as .ai files. 
Graphic color
When you view graphics on your computer screen, they are displayed in RGB
(red, green, blue) mode. Graphics that have been commercially printed—like 
those in this book, in any magazine, or on your cereal box—were created in 
CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) mode. 
These two modes are not interchangeable. Most commercial printers cannot 
accurately print an rgb image, and what you see on screen is not what you’ll 
get in your printed project.
So, when you are creating a graphic that is to be viewed on a screen, like a new 
logo for your web site, you’ll want that image to be in rgb mode. Anything 
you’re going to have printed by a commercial printer should be in cmyk.
Many home and office printers print in rgb. However, if your printer takes
four (or more) separate color cartridges, you will usually get better results if 
you work in cmyk. See Chapter 8 on Color for more details.
Graphic resolution
Photographs and Photoshop graphics are raster images; they are comprised of a fixed 
number of pixels and are measured in pixels per inch (ppi). A high-resolution image, 
say  300 ppi, is one that contains enough pixels to resolve the image clearly. The image 
resolution is determined by the original source file; that is, if the photo is from your 
old cell phone, it’s pretty low-res and there’s not much you can do about it (well, John 
has some great tips in our book, The Non-Designer’s Photoshop Book; see the image of 
Scarlett on page 159 of this book for an example of a low-res image made beautiful). 

  7 :  a l l  a b o u t  g r a p h i c s
133
The display performance
Even if your graphics are high resolution, they might appear to be low resolution 
on the InDesign page, depending on the “Display Performance” settings in 
the preferences. Go to the Preferences dialog box (from the InDesign menu 
on a Mac; from the File menu on a PC), where you can set a document default
so all your graphics display either “Fast,” “Typical,” or “High Quality.” To set 
an application default for all new documents that you create, choose a display 
option before you open any document.
The advantage of a “Fast” display is that if you have an old and slow machine, 
the images are all gray boxes and so your pages load very fast and you can 
move the graphics around quickly—but you can’t see the images. A “Typical” 
display shows a lower resolution image, again for faster working time, and 
“High Quality,” of course, shows your best high-quality image.
You can override the default for individual graphics: Select one or more images, 
then right-click to get the contextual menu shown below.
Generally, for commercial printing use 
300 ppi images; desktop printing on an 
inexpensive inkjet printer is of pretty low 
quality anyway, so low-res photos don’t look 
much worse than anything else. 
However, when you reduce the size of a 
bitmap image on the page in InDesign, you 
effectively increase its ppi—the pixels in the 
image become smaller and so they appear
to be better resolved. This lets you cheat on 
some images, although they still won’t have 
as much detail. InDesign’s Links panel keeps 
track of an image’s actual ppi and its effective 
ppi; see page 160. 
This is what images look like 
when you choose a “Fast 
Display” performance.
Contextual menu. 
You can set a default for the document 
(right-click on an empty space), but 
choose separate settings for individual 
graphics (right-click on the graphic). 
Then make sure to check “Allow 
Object-Level Display Settings.” 
The cropped 
image above has 
an actual ppi   
of 72 and is placed 
on the page at 100 
percent size, so its 
effective ppi
is also 72. 
Reducing the same image to 25 
percent reduced its effective ppi to 
288, legitimately printable. But you 
can see that even though it is not as 
pixelated, there is still a lack of detail.  

7 :  a l l  a b o u t  g r a p h i c s
The line and shape tools
You have probably used shape tools before, and InDesign’s work the same as 
any other: Get the tool, press-and-drag on the page. Every shape has a frame,
whether you can see it or not. You can change the stroke and the fill, as explained 
on page 136. To reshape a drawn shape, see pages 138–139. Do these easy tasks:
Drawn Graphics
There is a lot you can do with graphics that you draw right on the page in 
InDesign. You can make quick and easy shapes to use as lively frames and 
backgrounds for text or to enhance other images you draw or import. If you 
actually know how to draw, take advantage of the Pen and Pencil tools.
More importantly, all the things you can do to the frames and fills and strokes 
in drawn graphics, you can do to text and graphic frames. So don’t skip this 
section just because you don’t think you’ll be using drawing tools for illustration! 
All graphics drawn on the page in InDesign are in the vector format so you can 
enlarge them as much as you want and they will always print nice and crisp.
Shape tools.
Line tool.
Drawing tools.
To constrain proportions to a perfect square  
or circle, hold the Shift key while dragging.
To start a shape from its center instead of its corner, 
hold the Option (PC: Alt key) while dragging.
To move a shape before letting go, hold down  
the Spacebar and drag to another position.
Rectangle and ellipse tools: Click on the page 
(instead of press-and-drag) to get a dialog box 
where you can enter a specific size. 
Polygon tool: Click on the page (instead of press-
and-drag) to get a dialog box where you can enter a 
height and width, and also the number of sides and 
how deeply they are inset (which makes points).  
An inset of zero prevents a star shape; an inset of 
100 percent gives you straight lines connected in 
the middle. Try it!
Double-click on the Polygon tool icon in the  
Tools panel to set just the sides and inset.
134

The Polygon tool is crazy wild
I’m not quite sure how useful this is, but the Polygon tool can do things no 
other tool can do. First experiment with it by using the techniques explained 
at the bottom of the opposite page. InDesign retains the settings for the next 
polygon you draw. When you’re comfortable creating them, try these tasks. 
	
Go insane with the Polygon tool
• Reshape a drawn polygon: With the black Selection tool, select the 
shape. Double-click on the Polygon tool icon in the Tools panel  
and enter new specs. 
• Reshape the polygon as you create it: Drag out a polygon, but  
don’t let go of the mouse or trackpad button. Tap the Spacebar once 
(nothing appears to happen), then use the arrow keys. The UpArrow 
and DownArrow increase and decrease the number of sides; the 
LeftArrow and RightArrow increase and decrease the inset. 
If you’re feeling confident, use this technique combined with 
the next two, below. 
• Multiply the polygons: Draw a polygon, but don’t let go of the 
mouse or trackpad button; tap the UpArrow key. Each time 
you tap, another polygon appears, above the first one; tap the 
DownArrow key to delete a polygon. Since your button is still 
down, drag to resize all of those polygons at once. 
• Make a grid of polygons: Follow the steps above to multiply the 
polygons. When you’ve got a nice tall column of them, tap the 
RightArrow key to make a new column. Drag to the right and 
simultaneously tap the RightArrow key to create a whole darn 
grid. To delete a column, tap the LeftArrow key.
• Use the technique mentioned on the opposite page to move  
the polygon before you’re finished: Hold down the Spacebar 
and drag the entire collection.
• When you let go of the collection of polygons, they are 
automatically all selected. This would be a great time to group 
them together (see page 140) or change their fills and strokes,  
as explained on the following page. 
• Also see page 139 to alter individual points, sides, or insets  
on any polygon. 
• Also see page 138 to add corner options to polygons!

Strokes and fills
Every frame has a stroke around it (a border), whether or not you can see it. 
And the inside has a fill color. A frame can have a fill and at the same time 
have content, such as an image (in which case it is a graphic frame) or text (in 
which case it is a text frame). The three frames (shape, image, and text) are 
each a little different from each other, but all can have strokes and fills.  
	
Change the fill and stroke of a shape
 The trick to changing a stroke or a fill is to first select these three things:
• Select the object with the black Selection tool. 
• Select the Container Formatting box in the Swatches panel,  
as shown below (if you selected a shape frame, this box is 
already chosen; get in the habit of checking anyway). 
• Select the Fill or Stroke box in the Swatches panel, as shown below.
1 Select and change the fill: Make sure you have selected the three items 
listed above (including the Fill box), then choose your color.  
2 Select and change the stroke: Make sure you have selected the three 
items listed above (including the Stroke box), then: 
• Choose your stroke color from the Swatches panel.
• From the Stroke panel, choose a “Weight” and a “Type.”
• If you choose any stroke besides the solid one, you can also choose 
a color for the gap between the lines. Try it! Don’t be a wimp— 
play with the possibilities of giant wavy strokes or dots!
• Be aware that the “Align Stroke” options change the size of your 
shape. Below, all the boxes are the same size, with a 3-point stroke.

137
Manipulating the shapes
Knowing how to manipulate the shapes and frames and fills is important 
because, as I mentioned before, these techniques apply to all frames in 
InDesign—drawn shapes, placed graphics, and text. 
	
Resize an object
Resizing a shape (not a frame with an image in it; see pages 148–149 
for that) is the same as in many other programs you may have used. 
Essentially, you are resizing the frame itself in this operation, but since a 
shape frame has no content (just a fill), it works to resize the shape.
1 With the black Selection tool, drag any handle.
2 To maintain the same proportion, hold down the Shift key and drag.
To resize from the center outwards, press on the handle, and then hold 
down the Option key (PC: Alt key) and drag.
	
Copy an object 
1 Get the black Selection tool.
2 Hold down the Option key (PC: Alt key), then press-and-drag  
the object. 
To drag the object perfectly horizontally or vertically, hold down the 
Shift key as well as the Option key. 
	
Rotate an object 
1 With the black Selection tool, single-click the image. 
2 Position the pointer just outside any corner handle—you’ll see  
the curved double-arrow appear. At that point, press-and-drag 
to rotate the object. 
 
 Or select the object, then choose the Rotate tool from the Tools 
panel. Position the rotate cursor (which looks like crosshairs) 
anywhere on the page and drag.  
 
 Or enter a rotation amount in the Rotation Angle field in the 
Transform panel (see page 155). 
To put the image back into its normal rotation, select the graphic with the 
black Selection tool. Right-click on the P icon in the Control panel; this 
pops up a contextual menu with one option, to “Clear Transformations.”   
Or select the object, go to the Transform panel (page 155), and from its 
panel menu choose “Clear Transformations.”  
Or enter zero in the Rotation Angle field in the Transform panel.

7 :  a l l  a b o u t  g r a p h i c s
	
Use the Corner Options
You have a choice of several corner options for any frame. They’re not 
terribly useful, but it’s good to know they’re there. Sometimes you might 
want to take the harsh edge off the corners, or add a bit of a fancy one on 
a text frame for a special invitation. If you combine a shaped corner with 
a fancy stroke with a gap color, you can create some interesting effects. 
1 With the black Selection tool, select the frame (try this on a shape  
or graphic frame for now).
2 From the Object menu, choose “Corner Options….”
3 You can see the changes on your frame as you enter values in these 
corner fields. Click ok when finished. 
 
 To remove all corner styles, make sure the chain icon is locked, then 
choose the square corner from any pop-up menu, as shown above.
To change each corner individually, click the 
chain link icon so it is unlocked. If you want all the 
corners the same, make sure the chain is locked.
To change a corner, choose a corner style 
from the pop-up menu. If the square corner is 
chosen, that means no style is applied. 
This image uses 
“Inverse Rounded” 
corners, 0p10,  
with a 3-point 
Thick-Thin stroke 
with a gap color  
of Paper. 
Try this for fun!
The crazy shapes below are actually polygons that have had their corners 
reshaped with the “Corner Options” dialog box (above) and various 
strokes applied with colored gaps. The first three are groups of two 
polygons each; I used the Smart Guides to center the small shapes 
within the larger shapes.
138

7 :  a l l  a b o u t  g r a p h i c s
	
Reshape an object
There are many opportunities in design for altering the shape of a frame, 
and there are several ways to do it in InDesign. Try these:
1 With the black Selection tool, select a frame of any sort. 
2 Double-click on the Polygon tool in the Tools panel. 
3 Set the number of sides and the inset, then click ok. Voilà.
Also try this more useful technique
1 With the white Direct Selection tool, single-click on any object.
2 Then with the same tool, single-click directly on the frame so you  
see the individual white points. They are really tiny, so it’s hard  
to see them. Watch the cursor—you’ll see a tiny square when  
you are positioned over a point. 
3 Press-and-drag on that point. Do the same  
to any other point that you wish to reshape.
	
Use the Live Corners controls
If you haven’t turned off the Live Corners control, you see a little yellow 
box on the upper-right edge of most frames. This control lets you adjust 
corners directly on the frame, and you can adjust them individually.
To hide or show this control, go to the View menu, choose “Extras,”  
and then choose to “Hide [or Show] Live Corners.” (Since you’ll use  
it so rarely, I recommend turning the control off until you need it.) 
1 Click the yellow Live Corner control; all four corners now have  
a yellow diamond-shaped control.
2 To reshape all the corners the same, drag any yellow diamond.
3 To reshape just one corner, hold down the Shift key and drag.
4 To change the corner shapes to any of those listed in the dialog box 
on the opposite page, hold down the Option key (PC: Alt key) and 
click on any yellow diamond. Continue to hold down the key and 
click to cycle through the options.
I held down both the Shift key and 
the Option/Alt key to change just 
the one corner in the upper-left. 
I held down the Shift key to change 
the other corners individually.
139

Group elements together
You can group as many objects together as you like, and then apply settings 
to all of them at once, or move them all, delete them, resize them, etc. 
1 Draw a number of shapes on the page.
2 With the black Selection tool, do one of the following:
• To select more than one object, hold down the Command 
key (PC: Control key) and single-click on various items. 
Each one you click becomes part of the group.  
To deselect an object from the group, Command-click  
(PC: Control-click) on that individual item.
• Or with the black Selection tool, press on an empty spot 
outside of any shape, then drag the selection area to include at 
least one corner of any object you want to include.
3 You can keep the objects grouped together so they move as a unit: 
From the Object menu, choose “Group.” 
 
To ungroup the collection, from the Object menu, choose “Ungroup.”
	
Select an object in a group 
When objects are grouped, individual items can be difficult to select. 
• With the black Selection tool, double-click on the object you want.
• To edit text, click in it with the Type tool, even though it’s grouped. 
	
Send back and forward
Throughout InDesign, any object in any sort of frame can be in front 
of or behind any other object. Simply select the item, from the Object 
menu, choose “Arrange,” and then choose the action you want. 
Now, keep in mind that every single thing you have placed on the page 
is on its own private layer (completely different from the Layers panel); 
it’s as if each object is on a separate piece of plastic wrap. In general, it’s 
most efficient to choose “Bring to Front” or “Send to Back.” Learn the 
keyboard shortcuts!
	
Select an object beneath another object 
When objects are layered in front or back of others, they can be difficult 
to select; sometimes you can’t even see them. 
• Hold down the Command key (PC: Control key) and single-click 
on the item you want to grab. Each click takes you down through 
the layers of plastic wrap.

  7 :  a l l  a b o u t  g r a p h i c s
141
The Pencil Tool
The Pencil tool lets you draw as if you were drawing or writing with a pencil 
on paper. It creates a path full of points that you can alter, apply effects to,  set 
curved type along (see pages 192–195), or insert graphics inside of. This tool 
is great for when you need a simple shape and don’t want to—or know how 
to—use the Pen tools.
	
Draw a cloud
1 Select the Pencil tool.
2 Press-and-drag to draw squiggly lines all over the page. Try writing 
your name. You can change the stroke type, weight, and end caps 
of the line, just as if it were a shape (see page 136).
3 Once you’ve got the feel of it, draw a cloud 
shape. Be sure to make the ends meet so you 
have a closed shape.
4 To add color to your cloud, select the cloud 
with the black Selection tool. 
 
Open the Swatches panel; select the Stroke box  
(as explained on page 136). Choose a color for  
the stroke of your cloud.
 
Click the Fill box to select it, and select a color  
for the inside of your cloud. Or select the  
cloud and place a graphic inside of it,  
as explained on pages 154.
	
Smooth out a bumpy line
1 Press (don’t click) on the Pencil tool in the Tools panel to get  
the little fly-out menu; choose the Smooth tool.
2 Press-and-drag over any bumpy parts in your penciled path. 
 
Or if you know how to use direction handles and points, get the white 
Direct Selection tool. Drag points and handles to alter the shape. 
 
Double-click the Pencil tool icon in the Tools panel to get a pane  
of preferences to experiment with.
I selected these lines drawn with the Pencil tool, 
then in the Strokes panel, chose the “Cap” called
Round Cap to make the ends rounded, and the 
“Join” called Round Join to round off the pointy bits.

142
Pen tools
The Pen tools in InDesign are very similar to the Pen tools in Illustrator and 
Photoshop, so if you are familiar with those, you can skip this section. If you’ve 
never used a Pen tool before, this might be confusing because it operates like 
nothing you’ve ever seen. On these two pages I’m going to explain just the 
very bare necessities; please see The Non-Designer’s Illustrator Book for a much 
more thorough explanation of the Pen tool as well as exercises for using it. 
	
Experiment with the Pen tools 
Create a star shape. 
1  Clear your page of other objects. Make sure nothing is selected. 
Get the Pen tool. 
2 In the Swatches panel, choose a black stroke of .5, and a fill of None.
3 Click with the Pen; you get a little dot. 
 
Click somewhere else, and you see a line between the two clicks. 
Continue to click until you’ve created a star shape. 
 
Make the last click on top of the first one—you’ll know you’re in the 
correct position because the Pen tool displays a tiny round circle.  
4 To release the Pen from the path, click on any other tool,  
or hold down the Command key and click on an empty space. 
Why do they make 
these important 
symbols so tiny?  
Can you see the 
teeny little circle?
Once you have a 
shape, you can alter 
the points, just as 
you did on page 139.
5 Alter the shape: Get the white Direct Selection tool, then select the 
star. If you don’t see tiny white squares at each point, click again.
 
Press-and-drag to move the points of the star to reshape it.
6 Once you have a shape you want, get the black Selection tool again. 
You can resize the star, change its stroke and fill, place a graphic 
inside, and do everything else to it. You can edit its shape forever.

  7 :  a l l  a b o u t  g r a p h i c s
143
Create a curved shape.
1  Follow Steps 1 and 2 on the opposite page. 
2 Do not click with the Pen tool—press-and-drag a short ways.  
This puts down a point and drags direction handles out (see below). 
3 Continue to press-and-drag points and handles to make a blob.
4 Make the last click/drag directly on top of the first one, but drag 
slightly in the opposite direction you’ve been going (this is to 
prevent the line from getting twisted). 
5 To release the Pen from the path, click on any other tool,  
or hold down the Command key and click on an empty space. 
6 Alter the shape: Get the white Direct Selection tool, then select the 
blob. If you don’t see tiny white squares at each point, click again.
7 This time, use the white Direct Selection tool to click on a point to 
display its direction handles. Then drag the end of a direction handle 
to alter the shape. Drag the handle outward, inward, or any way.  
It takes a while to figure out which way to drag to affect the shape the 
way you want. Practice until you kinda know what to expect.
 
You can also drag the point itself to another position.
 
Reshape your blob into an amoeba. 
There—a perfect blob.
Experiment with the other Pen tools, and 
check the Help files, find tutorials on the web, 
and read the twenty pages about the Pen tool 
in The Non-Designer’s Illustrator Book to really 
learn to control and use it. With the Pen tool, 
you will have more options for techniques such 
as isolating part of a photo (as on page 190) or 
creating curves for type on a path (see pages 
192–195).

Graphic Manipulation
Once you place a graphic on a page, you usually need to customize it in some 
way. You might want to crop it, resize it, rotate it, put it inside a round frame, 
add a shadow to it, or many other things. For working through the tasks in this 
section, put several photographs in a folder where you can get to them easily. 
I scanned an engraving  
from an old book, then  
placed it on a photograph of  
a hand, using Photoshop. I then 
placed the .tif file on the InDesign page.
Placing images in InDesign
You might think of this action as importing or inserting graphics, as it is often 
called in other applications. But in InDesign, you place a graphic. It’s exactly 
the same process as in other apps, except you get to choose where the image 
lands on the page. You can even choose to resize it as you place it. 
	
Place a graphic on the page
There are several ways to place a graphic on the page, but the steps below 
explain the primary and safest method (also see page 160).
1 First make sure nothing is selected on the page—single-click on 
a blank area. You especially don’t want an insertion point flashing 
in the text right now! Or to deselect everything, press Command 
Shift A (PC: Control Shift A).
2 From the File menu, choose “Place….” 
3 Navigate to the folder in which you stored your photos.  
Double-click on the image you want to place.
144

  7 :  a l l  a b o u t  g r a p h i c s
145
4 On the screen, you will see a “loaded” cursor—your pointer is now 
loaded with the graphic image, as shown below.  
tip: If  the insertion point happens to be inside a text frame, the 
graphic will drop into that frame automatically! Just Undo the 
action and the cursor will reload with the graphic, ready to re-place. 
The cursor even tells you what kind of file it is—vector, raster, 
movie, etc! The clue is in the tiny icon in the upper-left of 
the thumbnail. In this example, I see it is an Illustrator file.
The cursor tells me there are 
three files, and this one is 
raster (the paintbrush icon).
 
To put the graphic on the page, single-click anywhere.  
The upper-left corner of the graphic will appear wherever you click  
the tip of the pointer to place it.
5 Also try this: Do the steps again to place a graphic. This time, instead 
of clicking to drop the graphic on the page, press-and-drag with the 
loaded cursor to place the graphic inside a contained area. You might 
want to do this, for instance, if you have columns on a page and want 
to place the graphic in the exact size you need it. Notice, below, that 
the info box tells you the percentage of the file size as you drag it.
6 Also try this: You can select and place more than one file at a time.  
The cursor loads up with them all, provides a tiny thumbnail of the 
image about to be placed, and tells you how many files are left.  
 
If Smart Guides are on (see page 11), you can drag to place the first 
item, then as you drag other items, the Smart Guides tell you when 
they are a matching size. Try it!
A loaded cursor.
When you drag, the 
container stays in the 
proportion of the graphic. 
The placed image. 
7 Also try this: Place into a shape. Create or select a shape on the page 
and select it. Go to the File menu to place a graphic, and make sure to 
check the box to “Replace Selected Item.” The graphic will be placed 
inside the shape (see page 141). Use the white Direct Selection tool to

tip: You can turn off the Content Grabber feature 
if you want. Go to the View menu, choose “Extras,” 
and then choose “Hide Content Grabber.” 
	
Now that the image is on the page
1 To move the photo somewhere, choose the black Selection tool. 
2 Press on the image anywhere except in the middle; then drag the graphic 
around on the page. Drop it in the middle of the page for now. 
3 The photo is contained inside a frame, just like all the drawn 
graphics you worked with earlier in this chapter. This means you 
can change the frame—put a stroke on it, color the stroke, reshape 
the frame, etc. Try it!
Very important: A placed graphic consists of the content and the 
frame. Whenever you see a brown bounding box (not the frame, but 
the line that indicates the graphic), that means you have selected 
the content, not the frame. You can select the content separate from 
the frame by clicking on the Content Grabber (if it’s showing) or by 
using the white Direct Selection tool. Experiment with this! You can 
resize the content, move it, rotate it (with the black Selection tool), 
etc., independently from its frame. Also see page 152.
This is the bounding box of the 
content. When you crop an image 
in InDesign, nothing from the 
image is ever lost.
Live Corners control; see page 138.

as opposed to the brown outline that 
indicates the content, shown below.

modify the frame.
White Direct Selection Tool:

147
If you accidentally press in the 
middle of a graphic to move it, you 
might find that the graphic moves 
out of the frame, as shown above. 
That’s because you dragged on the 
Content Grabber (shown above),
that target or donut symbol that 
appears in the center of the image 
when your mouse passes over it. 
If you accidentally move the graphic out of the frame
If your graphic won’t move sideways
If you place a graphic and find that you can’t move it sideways, only up 
or down, that means you accidentally placed the image inside a block 
of text (which can be a handy thing—check the Help files for anchored 
images—but for now, you need to correct the situation). 
If you notice it right away, simply Undo. The image will load itself back 
into your cursor and you can now click anywhere to drop the graphic 
on the page. 
If you did it a few minutes (or days) ago, get the black Selection tool, 
single-click on the graphic, cut it, and paste it somewhere else. Make 
sure you click in any empty spot on the page before you paste so the 
graphic doesn’t end up in a text frame again. InDesign maintains the 
link to the original source file. 
Undo and see if that works. If moving the graphic was the very last 
thing you did, it will work. If not:
If you can see a bit of the image or the empty frame: With the black 
Selection tool, click on the bit of image or the frame to select it. You 
will see the thin, blue bounding box and the handles.
Or if the image has completely disappeared and you can’t see the frame:
With the black Selection tool, click around on the page where the 
graphic used to be. When the eight handles of the frame appear, that 
means it’s selected. (Or select everything, then pick out that one frame.)
Then go to the Object menu, down to “Fitting,” and choose “Fit 
Content to Frame.” The image will snap back where it belongs. It’s  
a good idea to memorize the keyboard shortcut for that command.

Vector graphics resized
A vector image created in an application such as Illustrator is built with 
math ematical formulas instead of with pixels. It has no ppi count (as explained 
on pages 132–133). You can make a vector graphic as large or as small as you 
like, and it will always print beautifully. 
If you have a vector image in your collection, do this task so you can compare 
it with a raster image resized, as on the opposite page.
	
Place and resize a vector graphic  
1 Place a vector graphic on the page. You can use an Illustrator file 
(.ai), a pdf, an eps file, or any shape or collection of shapes drawn 
in InDesign. 
2 With the black Selection Tool, single-click on the image to select it 
so its handles show up.  
3 Hold down both the Command and Shift keys (PC: Ctrl and Shift 
keys); press-and-drag a handle. Drag inward to resize smaller; drag 
outward to resize larger. You can make it as big or as small as you want!

7 :  a l l  a b o u t  g r a p h i c s
Raster graphics resized
You cannot make a raster image (.psd, .tif, .jpg) much larger than its 100- 
percent size without it looking pixelated. If you plan to place a lot of photos 
in your projects, you need to buck up and prepare them appropriately—resize 
them in Photoshop so they are the correct resolution and close to the size you 
will use them on the page. I know, it’s annoying. 
	
Place and resize a raster graphic  
1 Place a photograph on the page. 
2 With the black Selection tool, single-click on the image to select it.  
3 Hold down both the Command and Shift keys (PC: Ctrl and Shift 
keys); press-and-drag a handle. Drag inward to resize smaller; drag 
outward to resize larger. 
 
(The Command/Ctrl key resizes the image, and the Shift key keeps 
it in the proper proportion.)
4 Check the Links panel (shown on page 160) to see how the actual ppi
of the image (its resolution at 100 percent) changes to the effective ppi 
(the resolution at which it will print, based on its enlarged or reduced 
size). For a commercial press, the ppi should ideally be between 
250–300 for raster images; your desktop printer is a little less fussy, 
but a higher ppi will still look better. 
 
Higher resolution in a raster image is not always better, though! If you 
have a giant photo that you reduced on the page to an itty bitty thing 
and the effective ppi is something like 1296, stop it! Make a copy of 
the photo and reduce it appropriately in Photoshop before placing it. 
You can get away with reducing 
some low-res photos for print. The 
actual resolution for this image at 
100 percent (as shown here) is only 
185 ppi.
I reduced this image on the InDesign 
page and its effective ppi is now 370. 
This is not the best practice, but can be 
done in a pinch.

Crop a graphic
Sometimes you want to crop a graphic slightly (or a lot), either for composition 
or to fit it into a particular space. It’s very easy to do.
	
Crop a graphic 
1 Place a graphic on your page. 
2 Get the black Selection tool.
3 Single-click on the photo so its eight handles show up. 
4 Press on any handle and drag inward to crop the photo in that direction 
(dragging a corner handle will crop two sides at once). This does not 
destroy anything—drag the handle back out and the image is still there.
To crop all sides of the image proportionally, hold down the Shift key  
and drag any handle.
To do major cropping, such as to crop a group photo so only one face is 
showing, you really should do that in Photoshop. If you place the entire 
large graphic in InDesign and then crop down to the one face, you still 
have to send the entire large graphic to the printer. This slows down the 
printing and also makes your InDesign file unnecessarily large.  
To show the entire image again, select it. From the Object menu, slide 
down to “Fitting” and choose “Fit Frame to Content.”

look better to remove the 
backs of the two guys on 
the right, as well as the 
distracting bits on the left.

Expand or compress a graphic
It’s rare that you want to expand or compress an image, but it does happen. 
Sometimes (because the camera adds weight to everyone) you might want to 
squeeze an image horizontally just a wee bit so a person looks the same size in 
the photo as they do in person. Or perhaps you want to widen a photograph to 
fit into the column in your newsletter, but you don’t want to crop or resize it.
	
Adjust a photo’s width or height without cropping
1 Place any graphic of your choice. 
2 With the black Selection tool, single-click on the photo to select it 
so its eight handles show up. 
3 Hold down the Command key (PC: Control key) and drag any 
handle. Drag inward, of course, to compress, and drag outward  
to expand. 
To get the correct proportions back, select the image with the black Selection 
tool. From the Object menu, slide down to “Fitting,” then choose “Fit 
Content Proportionally.” This will make the frame a different size from the 
image, so you need to go back to the Fitting menu and choose “Fit Frame 
to Content” (check that menu to learn the keyboard shortcut).

I compressed this image by more than 
a quarter of an inch. Now it fits into 
the allotted space, but doesn’t look 
disproportionate.

Reposition a graphic within its cropped frame
You might want to crop a graphic so the frame fits within your layout, but then 
you decide you want to see a different portion of that image within the frame. 
Because InDesign crops images in a non-destructive way, none of your picture 
is ever really gone. Once you have the size frame you want, you can adjust the 
image inside that frame. 
	
Reposition the graphic in the frame  
1 Place a graphic on the page. 
2 Get the black Selection tool; single-click on the photo to select it. 
3 Drag a corner handle inward so the shape of the photo is smaller.  
It doesn’t matter right now what it looks like.
4 Hover the black Selection tool over the image and you’ll see the 
Content Grabber; it looks like a donut in the middle of the image. 
If you have previously hidden the Content Grabber, no problem—
use the white Direct Selection tool.
5 Press on the image and hold for a second until you see the shadow 
of the full image, then drag the pointer and the image will move 
inside the frame. At any time, you can reposition it again.
Step 3.
Step 4.

This is an alternative crop 
and rotation that leaves room 
in the photo to add text. The

* If the Content Grabber is not showing, use the 
white Direct Selection tool to select the entire photo, 
then switch to the black Selection tool to rotate. 
Working with a graphic in a frame
Here is an example that uses a variety of techniques to edit and crop an image 
within InDesign, including the technique on the opposite page.
Original image. To emphasize the 
compositional similarity between 
Samuel ClemensTwain and his friend, 
we need to get rid of the distractions on 
both sides of the bench. So let’s crop it 
(with the black Selection tool).
Cropped image. The piece of sculpture 
in the top left and the unknown leg in 
the bottom right are now cropped out. 
Using the black Selection tool, I clicked 
on the Content Grabber donut to get the 
entire image*, then rotated the image to 
straighten out the bench.
Cleaned-up image. I right-clicked 
on the photo to open it in Photoshop 
(see page 161), where I cloned out 
the distracting bit of window by 
Mr. Clemens’ shoulder, as well as the 
lighting fixture above and behind the 
bench on the right. 
Consistent format. To match the rest of 
the newsletter, I added a 3-point border 
aligned to the inside (page 136). I used the 
Eyedropper tool (page 176) to pick up a 
stroke color from Mr. Clemens, and used 
the Live Corners control (page 139) to 
alter the shape of the corner.

Step 3.  
I had earlier  
made a clipping 
path around this 
pen in Photoshop 
to isolate it.
Step 4.
Step 6.
I filled the 
shape with 
color, then 
added text.
Paste Into and adjust
The “Paste Into” command in the Edit menu is very useful. It allows you 
to paste an element inside a frame, even though the content is a completely 
different shape from the frame. With the white Direct Selection tool, you can 
move or resize the inside image easily, within the frame. 
	
Paste a graphic into a frame and adjust the graphic 
1 With either a frame tool or a shape tool, create a shape. 
 
Fill it with None, and a 1-point black stroke. (You can use any fill 
or stroke you want, actually, but it’s easier if you can see the stroke 
at first; you can always change the stroke and fill later.)
2 Make sure the frame is not selected.
3 Place a graphic on the page: Don’t click to place it—drag a shape 
so it’s about twice the size of the frame (because many graphics 
drop onto the page in their full, huge size).
4 Resize the graphic to about the size you want it to be in the final piece.
 
Choose a section of the image that you want to appear in the frame 
you created, and position that section over the top of the frame. 
5 Select and cut the graphic.
6 Select the frame. From the Edit menu, choose “Paste Into.” 
 
It pastes into exactly the spot from where you had cut it. Use the 
white Direction Selection tool to reposition the graphic, resize it, 
rotate it, etc. Fill the frame with color, if you like. 
 
If your graphic is not isolated, as this pen is, you won’t see any fill in 
the frame. See page 157 for an example of pasting an opaque image.

Transform panel
Everything in the Transform panel is also in the Control panel when an object
is selected. The options you’ll find yourself using most often are the width and 
height fields for checking and for specifying sizes of objects, and the scaling 
fields for resizing. The most important thing to recognize in the Transform 
panel (as well as in the Control panel) is that the measurements must have a 
reference point. InDesign chooses one for you, but you can change it: In the 
little Reference Point icon (also called the Proxy), shown below, click on the 
dot that represents the handle on the object that you wish to stay stationary. 
	
Resize and rotate a drawn line (or any frame)
1 Using the Line tool, choose a colored 2-point stroke, and draw a 
6-inch line. Watch the width field in the Transform panel to see 
when your line is 6-inches long (or 36 picas). If you get close, let 
go, and enter 6i or 36p in the width field; the line (which is still 
selected) snaps to that exact measurement.
2 Now rotate the line: With the black Selection tool, select the line. 
 
In the Proxy, you see three dots selected; click on one of them. That 
is the reference point that will stay stationary when the line rotates.
 
From the panel menu (or the Control panel), choose “Rotate 90° cw.” 
Did it do what you expect? Undo that rotation, choose another proxy 
point, and rotate the line again. Practice with this until you can 
predict what will happen. 
3 Place a graphic on the page and use Scaling fields in the Transform 
panel to resize it. Don’t forget to pick a proxy, and make sure the 
chain icon is locked so the scaling is proportional.
tip: When you resize using a measurement in the Transform panel, the content 
and frame resize, but the blue bounding box around the original graphic doesn’t 
change. To match the bounding box to the content, go to the Object menu, 
down to “Fitting,” and choose “Fit Frame to Content.” Memorize the keyboard 
shortcut for this because you’ll use it constantly. 
These are very handy 
actions. The Control 
panel also has tiny little 
icons representing these 
same actions.
Scaling fields.

The Rotation Angle field is 
handy when you need to rotate 
various items at the same angle.

Align panel
The Align panel is enormously useful. Use it to align objects along their edges 
or centers, or to distribute the space between objects evenly. 
	
Align a variety of graphic images (or text frames)
1 Draw or place five or six objects on the page. 
Get the Align panel from the Window menu.
2 Select all the objects and click the “Align top edges” button  
(or align the bottom edges, whichever you prefer), as shown below.
3 Now position the first and last photos at the outer boundaries 
of where you want them to fit, as shown below. Arrange them 
horizontally for this exercise.
4 Click the “Distribute Spacing” horizontal space button (see below). 
The spaces between the elements will adjust themselves,  
and the first and last photos will stay in their positions.
With two clicks, the top edges are aligned and the space 
is distributed evenly between the images. 
The photos are placed randomly on the page. 
This is the horizontal space button that distributes 
the space evenly between selected objects. 
Check this button and enter an amount if you 
want a specific amount of space between objects.
Spend a few minutes checking 
all the tool tips so you know what 
your options are.

Effects panel
You can experiment endlessly with the effects. The combinations of effects from 
the dialog box (shown on the following pages) and the ones in the Effects panel 
(below) are mind-boggling. You can do lots of crazy things, but you can also 
do very practical things. Below are two tasks using the Effects panel. 
	
Make an object semi-transparent
1 Select an object or objects of any sort.
2 From the Window menu, open the Effects panel. 
3 Drag the Opacity slider, or enter a number in the field. 
I cropped 
the blot, as 
explained on 
page 150.
	
Blend an item into the background
This effect doesn’t work for all combinations of objects and colors,  
but can be a lifesaver when it is appropriate. Here’s an example: 
Let’s say you want to use this photo of a cabinet door, below, as the 
background for a poster, and this scan of a watercolor blot on top of it. 
But the blot makes a big opaque shape. 
Select the blot, go to the Effects panel (above), and choose “Multiply” 
from the Blending Mode menu. Now you can create the poster.
You can also use the Opacity 
slider in the Control panel.
The lower the opacity, the more 
transparent the object will be.

I knew who I was when I woke 
up this morning, but I must have 
changed several times since then. 
This is just to show how different combinations of effects and colors can 
create infinite possibilities. The three variant ovals (that use Inner Glow,  
Bevel & Emboss, and Satin with a Drop Shadow) have a text frame on top 
that uses “Color Dodge” from the Effects panel, not the Effects dialog box. 
Choose to apply the effect to the 
stroke, fill, text, or the entire object.
Make sure, after you check an 
item, that you also click its name 
to select the blue highlight bar. 
Otherwise you won’t see the 
options for that effect.
Effects dialog box
You can open the Effects dialog box by choosing one of the effects from the 
panel menu in the Effects panel (see the previous page), from the Object menu, 
from the contextual menu when you right-click on an object, and from the 
small fx icon in the Control panel. To experiment, let’s apply a drop shadow.
	
Create a drop shadow on an object
The quickest way to add a drop shadow is to select the object, then 
click the drop shadow button in the Control bar. It applies the current 
settings that are in the Effects dialog box, as shown below. But to have 
more control:
1 With the black Selection tool, select an object.
2 From the Object menu, choose “Effects,” then “Drop Shadow….”
3 Make sure the blue bar is highlighting “Drop Shadow.” Choose 
your settings. “Multiply” is the best mode, and an opacity of 
something like 40% is not too obnoxious. The x and y offsets 
determine how far the shadow is from the object. Experiment! 
Try some other effects on selected objects, such as the various feathering 
effects and embossing. Also see page 186 for drop shadow effects on type.

The black shape on this spread was too harsh and it was inconsistent with the 
rest of the booklet, but without it, the text on the image was difficult to read.
I selected the black shape and gave it a Gradient Effect from the right 
edge. Now the type is readable and the shape is not obnoxious. 
This is a cell phone portrait of my daughter Scarlett (that John Tollett enlarged to two

Linked images and the Links panel
One very important thing to remember: Even though, yes, it is possible to 
do it, do not ever copy and paste a graphic from another application into an 
InDesign document. Why? Because InDesign doesn’t embed images into 
its files—it merely displays an image as a placeholder with a link that tells 
InDesign where to go to find the actual image. The display on the page and in 
print comes from the linked image; if there is no link, the image will display 
crummy, and print even crummier. So never, ever.* Got that?
You can, however, drag files from another InDesign file, from Bridge, and even 
from your Desktop, and InDesign will link to them appropriately. Or you can 
place a graphic in InDesign, then cut it and paste it (as on page 154) and it will 
come back in with its link intact.
The Links panel keeps track of every image you place in InDesign. If an image 
gets updated outside of InDesign (that is, you didn’t use the technique on the 
opposite page), you’ll see a yellow warning symbol, shown below. If you change 
a file’s name or move its location, you’ll see a red question mark. InDesign 
prints from the original file, not from the placeholder you see on the page, so 
the symbols warn you of a discrepancy or a broken link. 
	ok, the one exception to this rule is a vector image created in Illustrator. 
Turn on the aicb setting in Illustrator’s Preferences (under “File Handling & 
Clipboard”), then when you copy and paste a file from Illustrator into InDesign, 
the paths are editable in InDesign! If this makes no sense to you, ignore it.
If you know that the editing 
changes to the file are 
okay, just double-click the 
warning symbol and the 
file on the InDesign page is 
immediately updated. 
To relink a file to a new graphic 
because you moved it or changed  
its name, double-click the warning 
symbol or use the panel menu. 
Click a page number to go right to 
that page with that graphic selected.
Select a file, then click this 
disclosure triangle to show 
you important information 
about the file, including 
where it is stored, its color 
space, the resolution of 
the file (Actual ppi), the 
resolution based on any 
resizing you did on the page 
(Effective ppi), and more.

This is really great. It’s for those times when you are looking over the photos 
in your project and say to yourself, “Omigoodness, my teeth need whitening!” 
This technique lets you pop into Photoshop, whiten your teeth, go right back 
to the InDesign page, and la, there you are, teeth whitened. InDesign makes 
it easy to edit almost any file on the page and updates the link immediately.
	
Edit an image
1 Right-click on an image that needs an adjustment. 
2 In the contextual menu that appears, choose “Edit Original” if the 
file is internally linked to the original application.
 
Or go down to “Edit With” and choose an application in which  
to open and edit the file.
3 Edit your file and save it. If you look at the InDesign page, you’ll 
see that as soon as you save it, the changes are reflected on the 
InDesign page. When you’re happy with the image, save it and 
close it and go back to InDesign. 
tip for Macs: If your files constantly want to open in Preview, go 
to your Desktop and click on any .tif file; press Command I to get 
the Get Info window. Click the “Open with” button. Choose “Adobe 
Photoshop,” and then click the “Change All…” button. All .tif files will 
now default to your version of Photoshop.
You can see here that this 
file wants to default to 
Preview, so that is what 
will open when you choose 
“Edit Original.” See the tip 
below for how to change 
this default on a Mac.

Wonderful 
Color 
Such a world of wonder we live in today, where 
color can be printed so inexpensively and easily! 
I won’t bore you with stories of how tremen-
dously expensive it was to print color just a few 
short years ago, and how tremendously tedious 
it was to design and produce the paste-up to go 
to press. Suffice it to say that just stopping by a 
site like PrintPlace.com makes me itch to create 
something! A thousand rack cards printed in 
full color on both sides for $75, and all I do 
is upload the file? Unbelievable! And I can 
create hundreds of full-color handouts for my 
workshops right here on my color laser printer? 
I’m in heaven!
InDesign makes the process of designing in 
color so satisfying. I hope you enjoy this as 
much as I do. 
p.s. This chapter tells you how to create and apply colors.

It’s important to know the difference between rgb and cmyk colors, as well as 
process colors and spot colors, so don’t skip this short section!
CMYK color
The color model cmyk is what is used for all printed matter (except that from 
your little inkjet printer). If you have a magnifying glass, look at a magazine 
cover and you will see tiny rosettes where varying  dots of four colors—cyan, 
magenta, yellow, and black (cmyk)—overlap each other to visually represent 
the color. It’s quite amazing.
jt
Use cmyk for projects that will be printed on a commercial press, at an online 
print shop, or on product you might create to sell on sites like CafePress.com 
or Zazzle.com. 
Inexpensive inkjet printers usually prefer rgb (red, green, blue). If you send 
cmyk graphics to it, they will print up just fine, although the colors might 
not be exactly what you expect. If you own an expensive color laser printer (as 
opposed to a color inkjet printer), cmyk gives you better color; the printer will 
translate any rgb colors that happen to be in the file to cmyk.
cmyk is based on the color model we see in the world. 
A red apple appears red because when the light from the 
sun shines on it, all colors in the spectrum are absorbed 
except red, so red is what gets reflected to our eyes. 
Color mixing in cmyk works like one would expect: 
When you mix blue and yellow, you get green.
RGB color
The color model rgb is what is used on all monitors—television screens, 
computer screens, mobile devices, projection monitors, etc. The color 
is made of red, green, and blue light coming 
from inside the device and going straight 
into your eyes (as opposed to cmyk which is 
light reflected off an object). 
These are representations of the four printing plates (cyan, 
magenta, yellow, and black) that create the photo on the left.

note: The color you see on your computer 
screen is not necessarily what will print! Think 
about it: What you see on the screen is created with 
rgb, even if you’ve specified it as cmyk. What shows 
up on the paper uses completely different physics. 
The color will probably be close, but if you need 
exact color, you need to learn to calibrate your 
monitor and work with the commercial press.
Use rgb color for graphics that will be displayed on a screen, such as a web 
site or a PowerPoint or Keynote presentation, a mobile device or an iPad or a 
television. If the light comes from behind the color, use rgb.
You can also use rgb for jobs that you will output on your own inexpensive 
inkjet printer (although if it uses four toner cartridges, use cmyk). 
Color mixing in rgb is crazy: When you mix red and green, you get yellow!
Process color versus spot color
The Swatches panel gives you the option to create Spot Color or Process Color. 
A process color is one that will go through the separation process to get printed 
on the page; that is, it is cmyk that will be divided up into the four dots of the 
rosette I mentioned on the opposite page.
Spot color is ink from a can on a printing press. In years past when four-color 
printing (cmyk) was horrendously expensive, we used spot colors at the local 
print shop to get two-color jobs (say, black and red inks on white paper). With 
spot colors you can get colors on paper that cmyk can’t create very well, such 
as a deep red, or you can use a spot color as a varnish. This entails a lot more 
expense, though, because the printer has to use the spot color as a fifth color. 
Today, you will rarely run into a reason to have a spot color unless you are 
creating very expensive and professional work, in which case you’re probably 
not reading this book. 
The bottom line is this: Unless you have a specific reason and understand totally 
why you need a spot color, don’t use one. Your inexpensive inkjet printer doesn’t 
really care whether you use rgb, cmyk, or spot colors, but if you’re printing 
to an online print shop or your local professional press, don’t use spot colors 
unless you have a good reason. 
This tiny yellow symbol is an out-of-gamut
warning that the color you created cannot 
be accurately reproduced in that color 
model. Click the small color box next  
to the symbol to automatically get the 
closest color that is in gamut.

A really important thing to remember!
Keep in mind that every object, frame, and text character can have both a Fill 
color and a Stroke color. 
The color gets applied according to 1) what is selected on the page, and   
2) whether the Container formatting or the Text formatting box is selected, 
and 3) whether the tiny Fill box or Stroke box is selected.  
You’ll probably forget often to check all three things. Well, maybe you won’t 
forget, but I’ve been working with a page layout application for more than 
twenty years now and have selected colors at least five billion times, and I still 
forget to check each box before I apply color. Aaarrghh. 
Here are the several places where you can choose whether to apply the color 
to a Container or to Text and whether you want it to apply to the Fill or the 
Stroke (border). Use the tool that feels more convenient for you.

Color panel
There are a number of ways to create and apply colors in InDesign. First, let’s 
walk through the process of using the Color panel.
	
Open the Color panel
1 Find the Color panel either on your screen, or choose it from the 
Window menu.
2 If all you see is a color bar, as shown below, click the panel menu  
and choose “Show Options.”
3 If you don’t see the cmyk colors, as shown below, click the panel 
menu again and choose “cmyk.”
	
Change the color in the Color panel
1 Open the Color panel as explained above.
2 Click the Fill box to bring it forward.
3 Try each of these methods to change the color in the Fill box:
 
• Drag the sliders for the four colors back and forth to see 
how the colors get mixed. Try to predict how the color will 
change as you add or delete more of each color.
 
• Click in the color bar across the bottom. 
 
• Double-click the Fill box to open the Color Picker. If you’ve 
used the Color Picker in Photoshop, you’ll see that it’s just 
the same (see page 170 for more about the Color Picker).
4 Click the Stroke box to bring it forward, and change the colors  
as above.
To save the color so you can use it again, 
click “Add to Swatches.” This puts the color in 
the Swatches panel; see pages 171–173.

8 :  w o n d e r f u l  c o l o r
168
	
Apply color to an object
1 The colors in the Fill and Stroke boxes will be applied to the next 
object you create, so get the Rectangle tool or Ellipse tool and draw  
a shape (with the tool, press-and-drag diagonally). 
2 While that object is selected, choose the Fill box and change the color, 
then select the Stroke box, choose a size for the stroke, and color it. 
	
Apply color to text
There are two ways to apply color to text: 
• To change selected text characters: With the Type tool, select 
the characters. Select the Fill box in the Color panel or the 
Swatches panel. Select the color. (If you want to add an outline
to each selected text character, choose the Stroke box, choose a 
stroke weight, and choose a color.)
• To change all the text in a frame: With the black Selection  
tool, select the text frame. Click the tiny T (the Text Formatting box) 
in the Color or the Swatches panel, choose the Fill box, then choose 
a color. (This only works if the entire story is in one frame; see pages 
24–26 about stories in relation to text frames.)
Try both methods several times until you feel confident in the task.
Essentially, the process of applying a color is like everything else in InDesign: 
Select the item appropriately, then choose the color.
Ute Lake • New Mexico
I selected the photo to apply the 4-point 
stroke and color it black.
I added the bar along the side using the 
Rectangle tool and applied the black color.
I set the type, turned it ccw (counter-
clockwise, using the Transform panel; see 
page 155), set it in position and adjusted it, 
and then used the Eyedropper tool to pick 
up a color in the sky and apply it to the text   
(see pages 176–179).

I added a half-point purple stroke 
to these characters in the Zanzibar 
font, as explained above.

I drew this with the Polygon tool,  
set with 8 sides and 40 percent inset 
(as explained on page 134). The 
stroke is a 6-point “Thick–Thin”  
line, black, and in the Stroke panel  
I chose yellow for the gap color. 
I placed a graphic with a 
transparent background  
(the mermaid) inside a frame.
I applied a 1-point black  
stroke to the frame.
I applied a gradient fill to the 
inside of the frame (see pages 
180–181).

This photo advertising “ho-made 
pies” has a simple 5-point black 
stroke around it. 
This uses the “Thin–Thin” stroke with a color in 
the gap (see page 136). The flower ornament 
is a 50 percent tint of the text (see page 175). 
There are three separate objects in this—the 
oval, the text, and the ornament (which is from 
the font db Fancy Flourishes).

The dingbat beneath the name is a tint of the 
rose color in the letters (see page 175 on tints).

I used the “Straight Hash” stroke from the Stroke 
panel, and clicked the “Align Stroke” button called 
Align Stroke to Inside. The red dot is a separate 
object, aligned using Smart Guides (page 11).

Color Picker
You might have used the Color Picker in Photoshop or Illustrator. The one in 
InDesign is very similar.  
	
Create a color in the Color Picker
1 Double-click on the Fill or Stroke boxes in the Color panel, 
the Tools panel, or the Control panel. This opens the Color Picker.
2 Drag around inside the color field; you’ll see crosshairs that indicate 
the color, and that color appears in the top half of the color box. 
3 To change the color field, click inside the tall color spectrum bar  
or drag the sliders up and down.
4 If you know the cmyk or rgb values of another color that you want to 
match (in another file, for instance, or in Photoshop or Illustrator or 
on a web page), enter the values in the fields shown here. 
5 To save the color as a swatch in the Swatches panel, click in one of the 
value fields for cmyk, then click the button “Add cmyk Swatch.”
 
To apply this color to whatever you had selected, click ok.
 
To make sure a color does not get accidentally applied to something 
that was selected, click “Cancel.”
This button changes, depending on which 
value field you click in. For instance, click 
in one of the cmyk fields to make this 
button display “Add cmyk Swatch.”
These numbers are the values, or 
percentages, of each ink in a cmyk color.

The Color panel versus the Swatches panel
The Color panel creates local, unnamed colors. This is hugely important. When 
you create a local, unnamed color and apply it to an object or text, the color 
exists only in that object. If you want to edit that color, you have to select 
that object. 
Colors in the Swatches panel are global, and all colors are named. When you 
create a swatch and apply that swatch to an object here, some text there, a style 
sheet definition, etc., that color is linked back to its swatch. If you change the 
swatch, everything that has that color applied will change! This is a terrific thing, 
as long as you understand what will happen. 
You can customize a swatch color in an individual object: Apply a swatch color 
to an object, then select that swatch color in the object or text and use the Color 
panel to adjust the color. The color in the object or text is no longer a swatch 
color and will not change if you edit the original swatch. This is very useful for 
times when you have a main color throughout a piece, but here and there you 
need that color a little darker or lighter, as in the red example on page 182. 
The Swatches panel
Most of the time you will be creating and selecting colors in the Swatches panel 
because if you are creating a job to be printed, you need to be aware of the 
color mode and whether a swatch is a spot color or process color (as explained 
on pages 164–165). This is the Swatches panel; see Task 4 for applying color.
Color mode: 
rgb shows three bars.
cmyk shows four quadrants.
Process colors are a gray box.
Spot colors are a round dot.
Mouse over these buttons 
to see what they are. 
Hover over a color to 
display its values. 
Do a slow double-click to 
rename the color here. 
This is the panel icon.
Click on these hash marks 
to open the panel menu. 
Be sure to check out all 
the options.

Create a new color in the Swatches panel
1 Open the Swatches panel, of course.
2 From the panel menu, choose “New Color Swatch.” 
3 Uncheck the box, “Name with Color Value,” then change the name  
of the color (you don’t have to change its name, however).
4 Drag the sliders to create your color. 
 
 If you know the values of the color you want (perhaps you want to 
match a color from somewhere else), enter those values. 
 
 If you’re working with a professional press and they have a color 
matching system they want you to use, click on “Color Mode” and 
choose from thousands of swatch colors in the appropriate list. 
5 If you need to, you can change the Color Type (process or spot;  
see page 165) or Color Mode (cmyk or rgb; see pages 164–165).
6 If you want to make more than one color, click “Add.” The color gets 
added to the Swatches panel and you can now create another.
 
 When you are finished creating colors, click ok.
Change the type of color (process or spot) 
and change the mode (cmyk or rgb) in this 
dialog box.
These are the values of each of the four inks in 
a cmyk color. In any other dialog box or in any 
other application, you can enter these values to 
create an exact printed match (they will probably 
look slightly different on every monitor). 
You can create hundreds 
of colors.  Give them 
identifiable names so you 
know what you used them for.
To rearrange the order, just drag 
the color boxes up or down.   
If you have a series of colors that 
belong to a particular project in 
the job, group them together so 
you can find them easily. 
You can click this button to create a 
new color. The new color is based on the 
color that was selected when you clicked 
the button, and it immediately appears in 
the panel at the bottom of the list. 
Double-click its color box to edit  
the color. 

  8 :  w o n d e r f u l  c o l o r
173
	
Edit an existing color in the Swatches panel
There are two ways to rename a swatch:
 
• Double-click on the color swatch to open the “Swatch Options” 
dialog box. If there is a checkmark in the box labeled “Name with 
Color Value,” uncheck that box, then type in your name. Click ok. 
 
• Or click once on the name in the Swatches panel. Wait just a second, 
then click again on the name. The field opens and you can enter the 
name you want.  
To change its color, type, and mode: Double-click on the swatch color box to 
open the “Swatch Options” dialog box. 
	
Add Color panel colors to the Swatches panel
If you have created colors in the Color panel and applied them to text or 
objects, you can easily add those colors to the Swatches panel so you can 
use them globally: Click the hash mark in the Swatches panel to open the 
panel menu, and choose “Add Unnamed Colors.” They all appear at the 
bottom of the panel, named with their color values; you can rename them.
Whenever you create a color in the Colors panel, you can use its panel 
menu to “Add to Swatches,” which adds just that color. 
tip: Here are some handy shortcuts!
1. Select the text or object.
2. Click the Fill box or Stroke box.
3. In the Tools panel, choose one of the following:
To apply the last selected color,  
click the Color button.
To apply the last selected gradient,  
click the Gradient button.
To remove the fill or stroke,  
click the None button.
Tools panel, double  
column and single column.

Working with the colors Registration, Black, 
None, and Paper
There are three colors that show a crossed pencil, which means you cannot edit 
nor delete these colors, and a fourth color, Paper, that is special. 
Registration: Don’t ever use the Registration color unless you know 
why you’re doing it. Whatever is colored Registration 
will appear on every color plate for printing four-color 
process jobs. If that doesn’t make sense to you, ignore 
Registration.
Black:
Black is black. See the opposite page and page 182 for 
examples of when you might want a rich black, which is 
more than black. 
None:
None is not white; it is an absence of color. You can 
see through None because it’s not there. 
Paper:
The default color for Paper is white, although you can 
change it. White Paper is opaque; you can click on 
it because it is actually a thing, a color. It covers up 
other colors, which means it lets the color of the paper 
show through in that place. 
Do not use Paper when you want to remove color! 
Always use None to remove color from an object  
or text.
You can change the color of Paper, although that color 
will not print! The point of Paper is to simulate the 
color of paper that you will print your job on. For 
instance, maybe you’re going to print your flyer onto 
goldenrod paper. The ink or toner is impacted by 
the goldenrod color, so if you want to know what it 
will look like when printed, change your Paper color 
to goldenrod to approximate the finished piece. The 
Paper color does not print. Leave Paper white until you 
know you need to simulate the printed page.
tip: You can drag a color box from any panel 
and drop it on an object to change its color!

  8 :  w o n d e r f u l  c o l o r

Black
Rich Black
When to create a rich black
If you plan to send a job to a high-quality press and it includes areas of black, 
consider creating a rich black with the values 20/20/20/100 (see page 172 about 
values). They look the same on the screen, but you can see the difference on 
the printed page:
Make a tint of a color
A tint is when you add white to a color to make it appear lighter in value. 
There are several ways to do this in InDesign—try each of these techniques!
 
• To change the color of an object or text to a tint value, select it.  
Then in the Color panel or the Swatches panel, change the tint value 
(the number) or drag its slider. Only the selected color is changed.
This is the tint value. 
You can also click anywhere in this color bar.
 
• To create a Tint Swatch of an existing swatch color, single-click the 
existing color in the Swatches panel. From the panel menu, choose 
“New Tint Swatch….” Change the tint value or drag the slider.
 
 Because it is based on a swatch, if you change the original swatch,  
the tint will automatically change at the same time, based on the tint 
value. You cannot rename a tint that is based on an existing swatch. 
 
• To lighten an existing swatch (which changes the existing swatch), 
double-click its color box in the Swatches panel. Hold down the  
Shift key and drag any slider—all the other sliders will move at the 
same time, creating a lighter version.
 
 If you want to keep the original, first make a copy of the original color 
(drag it to the New Swatch button, which is next to the Trash icon), 
and lighten the copy.

Fill box.
Take advantage of the Eyedropper tool
The Eyedropper tool is great—use it to pick up colors and formatting from 
somewhere else in your document. For instance, perhaps you placed a photo-
graph in your brochure and you want to pull colors from that photograph into 
your brochure; maybe you want a background color and a type color. If you 
pick the colors from the photograph, you can create a unified look. 
Now, when you pick up a color in the Eyedropper, it is applied to whatever 
happens to be selected at the moment. So it is very important to be conscious 
of what is selected (as usual)!
	
Pick up a color and add it to the Swatches panel
1 Place a colorful photo of something on your page.
2 Make sure nothing is selected on any page of your document: 
With the black Selection tool, click on a blank space.
3 Open the Swatches panel.
 
Click on the Fill box and the Container formatting box,  
as shown here:
4 Get the Eyedropper tool.
5 Position the very tippy tip of the eyedropper 
over a color in the photo, then click. The 
Fill box in the Swatches panel changes to 
that color, and the Eyedropper flips itself 
horizontally and looks like it’s loaded with ink. 
If that’s the color you want, go to Step 5.
If that’s not the color you want, hold down the Option key  
(PC: Alt key) and you’ll see the Eyedropper flip back to its unloaded 
position and it is again “empty” of color, ready to pick up another.
 
You can keep the Option/Alt key held down and keep picking up 
colors until you get one you like. 
6 When you like the color you see in the Fill box, let go of the Option/
Alt key, open the Swatches panel menu and choose, “New Color 
Swatch.” Uncheck “Name with Color Value,” type in a name, and 
click ok.
This is the 
part of the 
Eyedropper 
that picks up 
the color.

Change the color of selected text
 
• To change the color of selected text (as opposed to all the text in a 
selected frame), select the text with the Type tool, then follow Steps 
4 and 5 above. Because the text is highlighted, though, you won’t be 
able to see the actual color of the type until you deselect it!
	
Change the color of text in a frame
1 Place a colorful photo of something on your page.
2 Create a few words of text in a frame. 
3 With the black Selection tool, click on the text frame.
4 In the Color panel (or in the Swatches panel or the Tools panel), click 
the Text formatting box and the Fill box (which now has a T in it),  
as shown below.
5 With the Eyedropper tool, position the tip over a color in the photo, 
then click. The text within the frame immediately changes to that 
color. To keep that color, add it to the Swatches panel as explained  
in Step 6 on the opposite page. 
 
To experiment with other colors, hold down the Option key  
(PC: Alt key) and click on other hues. As long as you keep the 
Option/Alt key down, you can keep changing the color. Let go  
of Option/Alt to click on an item to apply that color.
There are so many shades of blue 
to choose from in this image!
 
Notice that the Eyedropper tool adds a text cursor to its icon 
when you position it over text. This is your visual clue that 
if you press and drag over text, the text will change to the 
loaded color. See the example on page 182.

Pick up graphic formatting and apply to objects
You can either load the Eyedropper with attributes and then click on things 
to apply those attributes, or you can select text or objects first, then use 
the Eyedropper to pick up attributes from somewhere else which will be 
immediately applied to the selected object/s. 
1 With the Pencil tool, draw two shapes. Apply different fills and 
strokes to the shapes. 
If an attribute is not listed in 
this dialog box, it cannot be 
copied with the Eyedropper 
tool. For instance, corner 
options are not listed.
2 Make sure nothing is selected (either click on an empty space,  
or go to the Edit menu and choose “Deselect All”).
3 Get the Eyedropper tool. 
4 Click on one of the shapes to load the Eyedropper with its attributes.
 
Now click on the other shape to pour those attributes from the 
Eyedropper into that shape. 
tip: To pick up only the fill or stroke of an object and no other 
attributes, first choose either the Fill box or Stroke box in a panel. 
Then with the Eyedropper tool, Shift-click the object to pick up 
the attribute, and Shift-click on the object you want to apply it to.
Check the Eyedropper options
Double-click on the Eyedropper tool in the Tools panel to get the “Eyedropper 
Options” dialog box, as shown below. These are all the things you can pick 
up with the Eyedropper! Select and deselect as needed for different projects.

  8 :  w o n d e r f u l  c o l o r
179
Try this!
To experiment with the eyedropper tool, follow these steps. Try to predict what 
will happen before you click! If something different happens from what you 
expect, take a moment to figure out why. 
1 With the shape tools, create three shapes on the page.
 
You can either set some defaults before you create them (as explained 
on page 12), or just create some shapes and see what shows up. 
2 Create a fourth shape and customize it to your liking: Choose a fill 
color, a stroke, a stroke weight, a stroke type, and a stroke color.  
If you chose a stroke with a gap, perhaps color the gap. 
3 With the black Selection tool, Shift-click to select all three of the 
shapes that you made in Step 1.
4 Now get the Eyedropper tool. While the three shapes are selected,  
single-click on the fancy shape you made in Step 2— its settings  
will be applied to all the shapes that were selected. 
You can also use the eyedropper tool the other way around, as in the Task on 
the opposite page: 
1 Recreate Steps 1 and 2, above. 
2 Get the Eyedropper tool, and click on the fourth, fancy shape;  
this loads the attributes into the Eyedropper. 
3 Click on each of the plain shapes; what is loaded in the Eyedropper 
pours into the shape (or into text as well, if you drag over text). 
tip: Whatever the Eyedropper picks up 
become your new defaults! This can be 
crazy-making. Be alert.

Create and apply a gradient
A gradient blends from one color to another, or from different tints of the same 
color. The gradation can be radical or very subtle. It’s easy to overdo gradients 
because they are so pretty and so fun to create, so try to restrain yourself from 
littering them all over the place! 
You can apply a gradient to text. 
You can, of course, apply gradients to objects. 
The gradient can be linear, as in the examples 
above, or radial, as shown to the left, where 
the color concentrates in a central point and 
radiates out from there. The central point does 
not need to be in the center of the object. 
You can apply a gradient 
to a text frame.

Now is the Winter of our Discontent,
Made glorious Summer by this Son of York:
And all the clouds that lour’d upon our house
In the deep bosom of the Ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with Victorious Wreaths,
Our bruisèd arms hung up for Monuments;
Our stern Alarums chang’d to merry Meetings;
Our dreadful Marches, to delightful Measures.
	
Create a gradient
1 Make sure nothing is selected (either click on an empty space  
or go to the Edit menu and choose “Deselect All”).
2 Open the Swatches panel, and from the panel menu,  
choose “New Gradient Swatch….”
3 Single-click on the first color stop, shown circled below.
This color well 
shows you the 
color in the 
selected stop.

  8 :  w o n d e r f u l  c o l o r
181
4 Adjust or choose a color: Either drag the sliders, or from the “Stop 
Color” menu, choose “Swatches” and choose a color from your list.
5 Click on the end color stop and adjust or choose a color for it.
You can add more color stops: Single-click directly beneath the 
Gradient Ramp. To remove stops, drag them off toward the bottom.
6 Choose whether the gradient “Type” is Linear or Radial, and name 
the gradient swatch. Click ok.
	
Apply a gradient
1 As usual, a gradient is applied to whatever has been selected.  
Select text with the Type tool, or use the black Selection tool to select 
a text frame or an object, or the white Direct Selection tool to select 
the object inside a frame. Choose the Fill or Stroke box, as usual.
2 Once the item is selected appropriately, choose the gradient swatch 
you just created. (If you don’t see your named gradient in the 
Swatches panel, click one of the buttons at the bottom of the panel, 
either Show Gradient Swatches or Show All Swatches.) The gradient  
will fill your selection, but don’t stop there!
3 Choose the Gradient tool from the Tools panel. 
 
While the item is still selected, press-and-drag with the Gradient tool 
over the item. You don’t need to start or stop an edge! Experiment 
with beginning to drag from inside the item or way off to the side, 
and try dragging way beyond the object. Drag diagonally or from 
bottom to top. As long as you’ve got the Gradient tool, you can drag, 
take a look, drag again, take a look, etc. 
4 At any point, you can edit the gradient swatch and all the items that 
use that color will automatically update themselves. 
5 Also experiment with the Gradient Feather tool! Use it just like the 
Gradient tool—it fades an edge of the gradient. Try it. 
The Gradient Ramp shows you 
the full range of the gradient.
Drag the color stops to change 
the gradient.
Drag the midpoint to change  
the exact point where both 
colors are at 50 percent.

The red color on the rich black is a 
little brighter than the red I used for 
the text on the page. 
The words “Santa Fe” and “Society” 
are a 30 percent tint of black. 
For the small headings, I picked up 
the color with the Eyedropper from  
the image on the flip side.
The title is three different text

InDesign is such a remarkable 
program. I do hope this book 
inspires you to go off and learn 
more about it because there is 
so much missing from this small 
introduction! InDesign is one of 
those applications that makes your 
computer-time a rich and exciting 
creative adventure. 

You can’t wait  
for inspiration.  
You have to go after it

Creative  
Tidbits
Really, everything in InDesign is a creative 
tidbit. But here are a few extra tips for 
your artistic pleasure. Each page in this 
chapter is merely an introduction to a 
particular technique, and I encourage you 
to spend discovery time exploring the 
further possibilities.
Also keep an eye out for design projects 
that use any of these techniques—put 
them in your Idea File. And keep your 
wheels turning for ways in which you can 
push the boundaries of your creativity in 
InDesign!

Drop shadows and other effects
You learned to apply a drop shadow on graphics in Chapter 7; you can also 
apply effects to text. Remember, to apply effects to text as an object, you must 
select the text frame with the black Selection tool. This means the effect will 
apply to everything in the frame. If you want individual characters within the 
frame to have a shadow, see the opposite page. 
	
Create a shadow on text in a frame
1 Make a text frame with a headline in it.
2 With the black Selection tool, click on the text frame.
3 From the Object menu, choose “Effects,” and then “Drop Shadow….”
4 Make sure the “Preview” button is checked, and start exploring!

You can apply more than 
one effect to the text.
Make sure the settings  
you want to work with are 
highlighted in blue!
When you check a box, that 
does not automatically 
display the settings for that 
effect. The settings are 
always shown for the effect 
with the blue highlight. 
The circled settings are the ones you’ll probably 
work with the most, but experiment with all of them!
Typical shadow: Blending mode is Multiply, 
40% opacity, 0p2 offsets, size of 0p5.
Blending mode is Multiply, 40% opacity, –0p6 
and –0p8 offsets, size of 0p2, angle –53.
Blending mode is Multiply, 40% opacity, dark 
plum color, 1p5 and 0p10 offsets, size of 0p2, 
noise of 9%, angle 150.
Blending mode is Multiply, 90% opacity, dark 
blue color, 0p0 offsets, size of 0p3, angle 180, 
text is white.
This is an Inner Shadow, blending mode is Multiply, 
60% opacity, 0p3 offsets, size of 0p4, text is white.

Outline the text for graphic possibilities
As you have surely noticed, there are some effects that you cannot apply to 
text unless you apply them to the entire frame. But you can turn any character 
into an object and then apply effects just to that object. Follow these steps to 
apply a drop shadow to one or more characters in a text frame.
thou art an 
without a figure
said the fool in king lear
	
Create a shadow on individual characters
1 Make a text frame with some fairly large text in it, including one or 
more characters that you want to drop a shadow on.
2 With the Type tool, select the character/s you want to affect.
3 From the Type menu, choose “Create Outlines.” That character is 
now an object. 
4 Get the black Selection tool and click on the character. Even if you 
did this to more than one character, you can only select one at a time.
5 Now you can apply just about any effect: From the Object menu, 
choose “Effects,” and then “Drop Shadow…” (or other effect of your 
choice). Choose your options and click ok. 
	
Reshape a character outline
When a character is an outline, you can use the white Direct Selection 
tool to alter its shape. This uses Bezier curves and control points, which 
I don’t have room in this book to explain fully (see pages 142–143), but if 
you know how to use them from Illustrator or Photoshop, then have at it! 
1 Create a large character in a text frame. Create outlines, as above.
2 With the black Selection tool, select the outline, cut it from the text 
frame, and paste it on the page somewhere (you can alter the points 
while it’s in a frame, but it’s tricky).
3 With the white Direct Selection tool, press and drag the anchor 
points and direction handles.
tip: To preserve the original characters as editable text, you 
can create the outlines as a copy. Just hold down the Option key   
(PC: Alt key) when you choose “Create Outlines” from the Type 
menu. The outlines will appear directly on top of the original.

Type into an outlined text character
The outlines that you created in Tasks 2 and 3 on the previous page can 
actually be used as text frames. 
1 Create a giant character, big enough to put text inside of. Use a bold 
sans serif or decorative face.
2 With the Type tool, select the character/s you want to affect.
3 From the Type menu, choose “Create Outlines.” Now that character 
is an outline. 
4 With the Type tool, click in the outline and type! 
 
If nothing happens when you click and type, you need to change 
this preference: Go to the InDesign menu, choose “Preferences…,” 
then choose “Type….”
 
Check in the box, “Type Tool Converts Frames to Text Frames.”
 
Click ok.
 
Now you can click in the outline and type or paste text. 
5 Format the text inside the frame as usual. 
 
To change the color of the outlined character, select it with either of 
the Selection tools (black or white) and choose another color. 
π (sometimes writ ten pi) is a 
mathematical constant whose value is 
the ratio of any circle’s circumference 
to its diameter; this is the same value as 
the ratio of a circle’s area to the square 
of its radius. π is approximately equal 
to 3.14159 in the usual decimal 
positional notation. Many 
formulae from mathematics, 
science, and engineering 
involve π, which makes it 
one of the most important 
mathematical constants. π 
is an irrational number, which means 
that its value cannot be expressed 
exactly as a fraction, the numerator 
and denominator of which are 
integers. Consequently, its decimal 
r e p r e s e n t a t i o n  n e v e r 
ends or repeats. π is also 
a transcendental number, 
which implies, among other 
things, that no finite sequence 
of algebraic operations on 
integers (powers, roots, sums, etc.) can 
be equal to its value; proving this was a 
late achievement in mathematical history 
and a significant result of 19th century 
German mathematics. Throughout the 
history of mathematics, there has been 
m u c h 
effort to determine 
π more accurately and 
to understand its nature; 
fascination with the number 
has even carried over into non-
mathematical culture. Probably 
because of the simplicity of 
its definition, the concept of 
π has become entrenched in 
popular culture to a degree 
far greater than almost 
any other mathematical 
construct. It is, perhaps, the 
m o s t co m m o n g ro u n d 
between mathematicians 
and non-mathematicians. 
Reports on the latest, 
most-precise calculation of 
π are common news items. 
The current record for the 
decimal expansion of π, if 
verified, stands at 5 trillion 
digits. The Greek letter π 
was first adopted for the number 
as an abbreviation of the Greek 
word for perimeter (π), or as an 
abbreviation for “periphery/
diameter,” by William Jones 
in 1706. The constant is also

Put a photo inside text characters
Not only can text outlines be used as text frames, they can be used as 
containers for images. Find a photo on your computer and put it somewhere 
where you can find it, for use in this task. You’re going to create something 
like one of the examples shown at the bottom of this page. 
1 Create a large word in a text frame. Choose a heavy face, very bold. 
Kern the letters close together. 
2 With the black Selection tool, click on the text frame to select it.
3 From the Type menu, choose “Create Outlines.” Now every character 
in the frame is an outline.
4 You can, at this point, place the photo (from the File menu) into the 
selected outlines. But I find it easier to do this:
 
Do not select the text outlines yet. First, get the photo: Go to the  
File menu and choose “Place…,” and double-click your photo.
 
Click to put the photo on the page, anywhere. 
5 Resize the photo to about the size you want it to be when it will be 
inside the outlines.
6 Position the photo directly on top of the outlines. This is because 
when you choose the “Paste Into” command, it gets pasted into the 
exact position it came from, as long as you don’t move the outlines.
 
Once the photo is in position, go to the Edit menu and choose “Cut.”
7 With the black Selection tool, select the outlined characters.
8 Go to the Edit menu and choose “Paste Into.” Voilà! 
9 Get the white Direction Selection tool. Click on the photo to get its 
brown outline. Drag the image into the position you want, or resize it 
from one of the brown corners. 
10 To resize the entire graphic, outlines and all, use the black Selection 
tool. Don’t enlarge it past the appropriate resolution of the graphic,  
as explained on page  133.

Isolate a photographic image
It enhances your design options if you know how to isolate an element in a 
photograph. This technique uses the Pen tools, to which there is a much-too-
brief introduction on pages 142–143. If you do feel comfortable using the Pen, 
this is a very useful procedure.  
	
Isolate an area of a photo
1 Place a graphic on the page (File > Place).
2 Get the Pen tool. 
3 Choose a 1-point or half-point black stroke and a fill of None. 
4 Draw a path around the object you want to isolate, on top of the photo. 
5 Select the photo, then cut it (from the Edit menu), leaving the path 
behind. Don’t move the path.
6 With the black Selection tool, select the path.
7 From the Edit menu, choose “Paste Into.” Ta da! 
 
When you move the entire object, make sure to use the black 
Selection tool. To adjust the position of the photo inside the path,  
use the white Direct Selection tool. 
 
You can use the white Direction Selection tool to adjust the paths  
at any point.
 
If you don’t want to see the path, select it with either the white or 
black Selection tools and give it a swatch color of None. 
This is the original photo. 
The art is stunning, but the 
wall detracts from it.
I made the path around the 
art extra thick here so you 
can see it.
Finished result.  
The path is still there 
(.5 pt. and None) and 
the entire image is still 
there, but hidden.

Wrap text around an object
You can wrap text around any sort of object, including drawn objects, imported 
graphics, and even text frames. The wrap is actually applied to the object, not
to the text; the object holds a boundary around itself to repel the text. This 
means if you move the object onto another body of text, that new text will 
wrap around the object boundary. This is the simplest form of text wrap, just 
to get you started using it. 
	
Wrap text around an object
1 Create a text frame full of small type, and justify the text.
2 Then place a photo or draw any sort of shape on the page.  
Position the graphic so it overlaps the text at least halfway.
3 With the black Selection tool, select the object. 
4 From the Window menu, choose “Text Wrap.”
5 Click the button to Wrap around object shape.
6 Explore the options in the “Wrap To” and  
Contour “Type” pop-up menus.
7 If you know how to use the Pen tools and the 
white Direction Selection tool, you can create 
new points and customize the shape.  
shall be gone tomorrow!
Once upon a time, a young man visiting the 
kingdom of Patan was very much surprised 
to see that an old man, named Raghu, was 
harnessed to an oil-crushing wheel and 
was made to go round and round 
like a bullock or buffalo.
“How long can you pull on like 
this?” asked the visitor. The old 
man replied, “Don’t worry, my 
young man, all this shall be 
gone tomorrow!”
Some time later, the young 
man visited the place again, 
and this time also, he was in 
for yet another surprise. He 
found the same Raghu, who 
had earlier been working at 
the oil-mill like an animal, had 
now become the mill’s owner himself! 
As he congratulated Raghu for his rise 
in life, the old man replied, “Thank you, 
young friend, but all this shall also be gone 
tomorrow”.
Next time the young man came back to 
the same town, he was further amazed. For, 
Raghu, the old man, had already become the 
king of Patan! “How come, my old friend? he 
asked. Raghu replied that the previous king 
of Patan had died and, according to the local 
custom, a new king was to be chosen by the 
royal elephant by garlanding whomsoever the 
animal chose. When everyone amongst the 
townsfolk had gathered at the large city-square, 
the elephant walked straight towards 
Raghu, threw the garland around 
his neck and turned back!
“Oh, I am so happy to hear this 
exciting story, Raghuji. My 
hearty congratulations!”
But old Raghu embraced 
the young man and said, as 
usual, “Never mind, all this 
shall be gone tomorrow!”
Sometime later, the young 
man happened to pass by 
the same town once again. 
But, to his utter surprise, all 
he saw there was a heap of 
rubble and ruined houses. There 
was no trace of the palace, or the 
town, including Raghu.
Shocked to the extreme, he made 
enquiries with the few people he met and 
learnt that an earthquake had destroyed almost 
everything in that city-state.
Now the wisdom of Raghu’s repeated sayings 
dawned on the young man, and he said to 
himself, “Yes, all this shall be gone tomorrow”!
moral: Nothing lasts forever.
This is one text 
frame that I divided 
into two columns 
using the “Text 
Frame Options” 
shown on page 33. 
The text wrap 
picked up the 
path I created on 
this photo, and 
I expanded the 
boundary in the   
Text Wrap panel.

Press or right-click on the Type tool to 
get to the Type-on-a-Path tool. 
Type on a curve
Type on a curve is not only fun to create, it’s useful. You might want to curve 
type around a logo, a seal, or a patch, add energy to an ad or poster, or simply 
draw attention in an appropriate way. InDesign makes this easy to do—as 
long as you follow the directions and are aware of the visual clues in the cursor.

Create a path and set the type
Text gets set along a path, which is a vector line of any sort. A path is made 
whenever you create any frame, shape, or draw a line with the Pen tool 
or the Pencil tool. (You cannot, however, create type on a compound path, 
which is when several paths are combined into a single object. For instance, 
when you convert type to outlines, as shown on pages 187–189, the type 
becomes compound paths.)
So your first step is to create a path. Let’s start with an oval.
1 Get the Ellipse tool. Make sure nothing is selected, and then choose a 
Fill of None, and a Stroke of 1 point in any color. Choose 12-point type.
2 Draw an oval several inches wide, with a gentle arch.  
3 Get the Type-on-a-Path tool (it’s under the regular Type tool).
4 Position the tool on the line, toward the left, upper edge of the oval; 
you will see a teeny tiny little + sign when you are positioned properly 
on the line, as shown below-left.
 
Press-and-drag the tool to the opposite side of the oval. You will see the 
in and out ports on the text brackets, as you do on a regular text frame, 
as shown below-right. Let go when the right bracket is positioned 
where you want the text to end. 
If your default text has an alignment 
(such as centered) or an indent, the 
text won’t begin at the beginning. 
Just as you would with straight text, 
adjust your text settings.

  8 :  c r e a t i v e  t i d b i t s
193
5 As soon as you let go, the text insertion point flashes at the beginning 
of the line. Start typing. Ta da! For this task, continue typing until the 
text doesn’t fit anymore and you see the red plus sign in the Out Port, 
as shown below. Uh oh, overset text.
6 Get the black arrow Selection tool, and single-click on the text.
 
Position the tip of the Selection tool on either of the brackets at the 
ends of the text frame—do not position the tip over the in or out port. 
A really tiny symbol appears in the cursor when you are in the correct 
position, as shown below. Drag the bracket until all the text appears.

Look for this tiny symbol:    or   depending on which end you position the pointer. 
7 Now that the text is set on the path, format it as usual: Select the text 
and change its color, the font, center it, kern it, etc. You will probably 
have to adjust the end brackets as you change the formatting.
8 To get the Options dialog box, select the text with the black Selection 
tool, then double-click on the Type-on-a-Path tool in the Tools panel. 
Experiment with these options! Make several copies of your text 
(Option- or Alt-drag) and see how the various effects compare. 
9 Select the oval with the black Selection tool and change its color to 
None. The oval is still there, but now all you see is the text.  
From the Options dialog, above, I chose the 
alignment called “Descender” to move the text 
away from the path. The text is centered.
Using the Edit command, “Paste Into” (see  
page 154), I pasted a photo inside the oval. 
I used the Eyedropper (pages 176–177) to pick 
up a color from the photo and apply it to the text.  
You can also get this dialog box from 
the Type menu; choose “Type on a 
Path, then choose “Options.”
The “Spacing” feature applies only to 
text positioned on a tight curve.

Set text all along a circle
In the first Task, you defined the space in which to type. In this short Task, 
you’re going to simply click and start typing.
1 Get the Ellipse tool and draw a circle (hold down the Shift key to 
make a perfect circle).
2 Fill the circle with None, and give it a 1-point Stroke of any color. 
3 Get the Type tool. Choose 10- or 12-point type, depending on the size 
of your circle (bigger circle, bigger type).
 
From the Type menu, choose “Tabs” and make sure all the indent 
markers are all the way to the left.
 
From the Paragraph specs in the Control panel or the Paragraph 
panel, choose a left alignment.
 
You can, of course, do all of the above after you set the type instead of 
doing it before. 
4 Get the Type-on-a-Path tool (it’s under the regular Type tool).
5 Position the tool at the top of the circle; you will see a tiny + sign 
when you are positioned properly on the line.
 
Click. Type. The text goes all the way around the circle. Follow  
Steps 6–9 on the previous page to format your text and shape.

Set text along a line
1 Using the Pencil tool or the Pen tool (see pages 141–143 for how  
to use the Pencil and the Pen tools), draw a curved line.
2 With the Text-on-a-Path tool, click on the line, then type!
3 With the white Direct Selection tool, move or adjust the points on 
the line as explained on pages 139 or 143.
For both the line and the circle,  
I selected the shapes with the black 
Selection arrow and changed the 
Strokes to None.

same as you thread regular text frames 
(pages 24–28).

Reposition the text on a curve
You can reposition the text on the line at any time. For this Task, use the 
circle of text you created in Task 9, or recreate another circle of text.
1 With the black Selection tool, single-click on the text so you see 
all the handles. Find the teeny weeny little tiny blue marker in the 
middle of the line of text, as shown below-right.
Can you see the itty bitty blue line?  
It’s at the center point of the text.  
When the pointer is positioned over it,  
the cursor displays an even tinier marker:
2 Position the cursor over that tiny blue center bracket (make sure you 
see the tiny symbol, shown above), then press-and-drag the bracket 
outside the text. This moves the end brackets around the shape or back 
and forth on a line, as shown below-left. When the end brackets are 
positioned where you want the text to begin and end, let go.
3 If, during the process above, you drag the cursor toward the center of 
the shape, you’ll notice that the text flips to the inside. If you want 
this, great—just let go of the pointer. If not, drag the cursor back to 
the outside of the text and it will flip back to its original position. 
Keep an eye on the end 
brackets; let go when they are 
positioned where you want.
This might be exactly what 
you want at some point.
rings with foils
Several times Shakespeare refers to a foil, which is a thin leaf of metal (such as gold leaf) 
set under a precious stone to increase its brilliance. 
In Richard ii, John of Gaunt attempts to console his son, Bolingbroke (later to 
become Henry iv), about his six-year banishment from England upon which he 
is about to embark.
The sullen passage of thy weary steps 
Esteem as foil, wherein thou art to set 
The precious Jewel of thy home return.
Richard ii, 1.3.265–267
In Henry iv, Part One, Prince Hal (later to become Henry v) reveals to the 
audience that he has a covert plan to intentionally display loose behavior now, so 
when he becomes King, the contrast between his apparently dissolute conduct 
as a young man and his noble conduct as King will therefore shine the greater. 
And like bright Metal on a sullen ground: 
My reformation, glittering o’er my fault, 
Shall show more goodly, and attract more eyes, 
Than that which hath no foil to set it off. 
1 Henry iv, 1.2.206–209
In Richard iii, Richmond (later to become Henry vii) describes Richard iii as:
A base, foul stone, made precious by the foil 
Of England’s Chair, where he is falsely set . . .  
[chair = throne]
Richard iii, 5.3.250–251
The “only pretty ring time” is 
believed to refer to the best 
time for marriage, the ringing 
of wedding bells, the exchange 
of wedding rings, a ring dance 
accompanied by a carol (which 
was originally a flute song 
specifically for a dance), or  
to a magical fairy ring in the 
spring grass. Or, as is typical  
of Shakespeare, all of the above.
It’s from this original use of the word that we get the later meaning of a foil as a person or 
thing that enhances and emphasizes another by contrast.

Libraries
When you find you use a certain element over and over, you can create a 
Library to keep it in and make it easy to access. You can store drawn shapes, 
grouped items, logos, text frames, even ruler guides. Each element preserves 
all attributes that you gave it, and when you drop it into another document, 
all those attributes go with it, including any file link information. 
If you remove the element from the InDesign document, its thumbnail stays 
intact in the Library, still available for you to use. 
	
Create a new Library and put things in it
1 From the File menu, choose “New,” and then “Library….”
2 Name the library. This name will display in the Library panel tab,  
so give it a descriptive title that will tell you what is in it. 
 
You can have as many Libraries as you want, perhaps categorized  
for different projects.
3 With the black Selection tool, select an 
item on the page to put into the Library. 
You can either drag-and-drop it into the 
Library pane, or click the New Library 
Item button. 
 
Option-click (PC: Alt key) the New 
Library Item button to get an infor-
mation pane where you can name the 
item and add keywords to make it easy to search and find later. (If you 
forget to do that, you can always double-click an item once it’s in the 
Library to get the information pane).
4 To place an item from the Library onto a page, just drag it out of the 
Library pane. Or select an item in the pane and use the panel menu. 
Try this!
If you’re in a class, use the features explored in this chapter (and the others), 
and discover something new! Experiment with all the options, try something 
wild, combine effects, push things to the limit. For instance, find out more 
about the text wrap feature and all the things you can do with it; learn to use 
the Pen tool and create paths for isolating graphics and curving lines of text, 
discover what else can be done with the Paste Into command or outlined text 
characters. Share the results with your classmates.

This chapter is filled with design projects that 
you can recreate as practice or use as templates 
for your own work. As in any field of art, 
recreating a piece teaches you so much about 
working in that field and with those tools. 
This chapter should also inspire you to 
create your own Idea File—pages you have 
torn from magazines, printed from the web, 
received in the mail, copied from a book 
cover, etc. Whenever you see something that 
you recognize as good design, file it away for 
yourself. When you have a project to work on, 
pull out your file and browse through it for 
ideas. Don’t worry about copying—the project 
inevitably becomes your own as you develop it 
with your own information and graphics.  
If you’ve read The Non-Designer’s Design Book,
make notes on these pages where each design 
uses contrast, alignment, repetition, and 
proximity.

The page below, designed by Laura Egley Taylor and Melyssa Holik for 
Mothering Magazine, has nothing on it that you don’t know how to do (if you 
worked through the tasks in this book, that is!). On the opposite page, every-
thing is selected on the original page so you can see how Laura put it together. 
With a few images from your own iPhoto collection or CreativeCommons.org, 
you can create something very similar, but with your own focus on a topic. 
There are only two fonts on this page: Myriad and 
Wiesbaden Swing. Myriad is an OpenType sans serif 
font with a wide variety of styles, and it contrasts 
beautifully with the soft and curvy script face. 
This is the 
oldstyle 
version of 
the numbers.
You can see there are a number of tints used to lighten objects 
in the background (see page 175 on tints). The colors in the 
text and objects were picked up from the photos with the 
Eyedropper tool, as you learned to do on pages 176–179.
Two of the frames 
on this page have 
dotted strokes.
The text frame for 
“Listen up!” was 
filled with Paper 
color to block out 
part of the stroke 
behind it.

To use bookmark, just fit it over the top of a page. 
Step 1: You will need a square 
sheet of paper measuring 3 by 
3 or 4 by 4 inches. Fold paper 
diagonally in half so that it forms 
a right triangle.
Step 2: Fold left side up to 
apex of triangle.
Step 3: Fold right side up to 
apex of triangle. Paper is now in 
the shape of a diamond.
Step 4: Unfold the two flaps you 
have just folded, so that paper is 
again triangular.
Step 5: In middle of triangle you 
will see a perfect diamond. Fold 
down upper layer of top half of 
this diamond until point reaches 
bottom fold of paper.
Step 6: Bring left side of triangle 
toward top of diamond. Fold and 
tuck top half behind center fold 
in middle of diamond, almost as if 
you were forming a pocket.
Step 7: It’s done!  
Follow these quick and easy steps to create this handy place-holder.

Flyer
You wouldn’t want to create a flyer with a solid sheet of color that bleeds off 
all edges if you have to print it on your desktop printer—five copies and your 
toner would be gone! But if you’re using an online printer who is going to 
print in full color, then by all means, use lots of bold color. 
tip: I realize that new designers might look at a 
beautifully simple page as the one above and think, 
“Okay, I see how I could recreate it, but I could never 
think up the layout!” That’s why you need to start an 
Idea File and make notes about the good and bad 
design you see. Design works by osmosis, as long as 
you are consciously noticing.
For a border around a 
photo, as in this flyer, 
use the black Selection 
tool. Click on the photo, 
then drag the handles 
(circled, below) in the 
centers of the edges 
outward. Fill the graphic 
frame with a color.

Text-heavy page
Just because there is a lot of text on a page doesn’t mean it has to be boring. Most 
of what makes lengthy text appear elegant and readable is based on the spacing 
features you learned in Chapter 3—spacing between the letters, between the 
lines, between the paragraphs—and between the various graphic elements, as 
discussed in The Non-Designer’s Design Book. For your own project, try adding 
subheads (using style sheets, of course) to guide readers through the text.
You know how 
to format text 
as shown in this 
sidebar (tall text 
frame, flush right, 
fixed leading). 
The giant 
quotation 
marks are set 
in separate text 
frames and   
sent behind   
the main text.
Notice the first paragraph of the text is not indented, 
which is a typographical standard of excellence. Also 
notice the text uses a small indent, not the half-inch 
indent (or five spaces) you might have been trained 
to do. You can use space between the paragraphs or
an indent—never both!
This is a drawn 
line using the 
stroke type called 
“Wavy,” about 
6 points thick. 
This photo 
has a text 
wrap on it;

In 1973 I was living in southern New Mexico, pregnant with 
my first child and looking for a midwife. I didn’t know how to 
find one, so I went to a local obstetrician for prenatal care, all 
the while still hoping to find a midwife.
A woman my husband worked with had been a midwife 
in England, and two of my friends, who lived 200 miles away, 
were planning to become midwives. I called the New Mexico 
Department of Health, only to find that the state no longer 
licensed midwives.
My friends and I all wanted to have homebirths, but there 
were no midwives where we lived. We were awestruck by  
The Birth Book, the first book to publish graphic, step-by-step pho-
tos of birth for the layman, and were reassured by the National 
Association of Parents and Professionals for Safe Alternatives in 
Childbirth (NAPSAC), an organization that held conferences on 
and published evidence about the safety of homebirth. Having a 
do-it-yourself mentality and trying to live lives of self-sufficiency, 
we naturally began to birth our babies ourselves.
Six months before our own first baby was born, my hus-
band and I saw our friend Stephanie birth her son, Aram, at her 
home. We later helped to deliver the babies of three friends. I 
love birth, and was on my way to becoming a midwife, starting 
out, as had so many women before me, by helping a friend 
or neighbor. As Shafia Monroe, president of the International 
Center for Traditional Childbearing (ICTC), says, “Every woman 
is a potential midwife waiting to be born.”
As it turned out, while I loved helping the laboring mom, I
was afraid of catching the baby. My husband always did that. Nor 
could I figure out how to be a midwife while being the mother of 
my own babies. In short, my life went in other directions.
Many of my contemporaries entered midwifery in a similar 
fashion and actually went on to become midwives. Elizabeth 
Gilmore, who cofounded the Northern New Mexico Birth Cen-
ter and the Midwifery Education Accreditation Council (MEAC), 
and created the National College of Midwifery, began by help-
ing her friends deliver their own babies on Martha’s Vineyard. 
Gilmore was instrumental in preserving and improving New
Mexico’s licensure of midwives in the late 1970s, but when I 
interviewed her and her midwife partners in the early ’80s, they 
knew nothing about the legal status of midwifery in other 
states; they were too busy developing their own practices.
Supporting midwifery was part of the original mission of 
Mothering. I realized that, for midwifery to grow, we had to know 
what one another was doing, which legal strategies were work-
ing, which licensure processes were most effective. Parents and 
midwives alike needed to know the legal status of midwifery.
In 1981 we compiled our first edition of Midwifery and the 
Law, at first a special section in the magazine and then a small 
book. I remember how fellow editor Pacia Sallomi and I pored 
over the distinctions between the legal 
statuses of midwives in different states 
until we had distilled them down to a 
concise taxonomy. We published this 
book from 1981 to 1988, until the newly 
formed Midwives Alliance of North 
America (MANA) and other advocacy 
groups took over the task of identifying 
the legal status of midwives; they still 
use the taxonomy we created. 
In 1982, sociologist Barbara Katz Rothman wrote her semi-
nal work, In Labor: Women and Power in the Birthplace, in which 
she contrasts the midwifery and medical models of care. She 
put the yearning for midwifery care felt by so many of us within 
a context of human rights.
While that larger context of human rights may come as a 
surprise to those of us in the US, accustomed as we are to inferior 
care, it is not lost on Amnesty International. Their March 2010 
report, Deadly Delivery: The Maternal Health Care Crisis in the USA, 
trains a spotlight on the US crisis in maternal health care. Accord-
ing to the report, a total of 1.7 million women a year—one-third 
of all pregnant women in the US—suffer from pregnancy-related 
complications. At greatest risk are minorities, Native Americans, 
immigrants, non-English speakers, and those living in poverty. 
“Good maternal care should not be considered a luxury available 
only to those who can access the best hospitals and the best 
doctors,” said Larry Cox, executive director of Amnesty Interna-
tional USA. “Women should not die in the richest country on 
earth from preventable complications and emergencies.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC), US infant mortality failed to improve from 2000 to 
2005. This plateau represents the first time since the 1950s that 
US infant mortality has seen no improvement. Even though 
the US spends more on health care than any other country in 
the world, we are ranked 33rd in the world in infant mortality. 
A baby born in Cuba, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, or South 
Korea has a greater chance of surviving the first year of life than 
a baby born in the US. In fact, a baby born in Singapore is twice 
as likely as a US baby to survive that first year.
The rate of infant mortality among non-Hispanic black 
women is 2.4 times what it is among non-Hispanic white 
women. One of the chief contributing factors to infant mortal-
ity is premature birth. In 2005, 36.5 percent of all infant deaths 
in the US were due to preterm-related causes; among the non-
Hispanic black community, nearly half (46 percent) of infant 
deaths were related to prematurity.
Maternal mortality, too, is on the rise in the US, as it is 
elsewhere. In a joint statement, the World Health Organization 
(WHO), UNICEF, and other groups called maternal mortality the

Table of contents
Magazine tables of contents have got to be one of the most fun projects to 
design, and one of the most overlooked. There should be prizes for tables of 
contents. Next time you’re in the dentist’s office, instead of reading the magazine 
articles, study the contents pages. Make notes about the design, the typefaces 
used, how the page numbers are presented, what impression is projected, and 
is that impression appropriate for the magazine, and why?

contents without having to stop to 
apply a lick of formatting: 
Use a Nested Style so the page 
number appears in the Myriad 
oldstyle numbers, then switches 
to the Wiesbaden Swing font 
automatically for the title. 
When you hit a Return, it picks 
up the next style sheet for the 
descriptive copy.
When you hit the next Return,   
it picks up the byline style sheet.
 Hit the next Return and it picks up 
the page number style sheet again 
and starts all over!  
Laura picked up elements 
from the inside pages to 
illustrate the contents, as you 
can see by the following page. 
This text frame is a master 
page element, of course.

Mothering is a leader in environmentally  
responsible paper use, and has been creating 
a demand for it for nearly 20 years. Circula-
tion Director John McMahon works with the 
Magazine Paper Project at Co-op America and 
advises other publishers about recycled paper. 
In recent years, recycled paper has achieved 
new levels of brightness and opacity that rival 
those of papers made from virgin fiber. How-
ever, only 5 percent of magazines are printed 
on recycled paper, and only 1 percent on pa-
per made from post-consumer waste (PCW).
Our paper, Leipa Gloss, is manufactured 
from 95 percent PCW and 5 percent recycled 
content. The PCW comes from de-inked maga-
zines, newspapers, and commercial and house-
hold paper waste. Only a handful of paper 
plants in the world manufacture PCW. 
When made with Leipa paper instead of new 
trees, every issue of Mothering saves:
34,000 pounds of virgin fiber
205 trees
18,000 pounds of solid waste
21,000 gallons of water
26,600 kilowatt-hours of electricity
33,800 pounds of greenhouse gases
Our printer, Quad Graphics, is a leader in  
environmental stewardship. In 2008, the  
Wisconsin Environmental Working Group 
recognized Quad as a Business Friend of the 
Environment, and Graphic Arts Monthly 
recognized the company as being among the 
Top 5 Print Industry Brands associated with 
sustainability.

Notice how Laura has used decorative elements behind  
the main elements. The decorative pieces all use tints of colors 
(see page 175) or the opacity of the object has been lightened 
(page 157). This lets the decorations add texture and interest 
to the page, yet not overwhelm the visual impression.
This is a text 
frame with a 
dotted stroke  
and a color fill.  
The tree has 
an opaque 
background, but  
Laura created 
a clipping path 
around it (see 
page 190) to 
isolate the image.

Inside spread
This is an inside spread in an issue of Mothering Magazine. I included this one 
because of its beautiful use of a large element and plenty of white space. New 
designers seem to have trouble making elements LARGe, and they also have 
trouble letting the white space be there. So here is an example to recreate with 
your own images, text, and topic. Let there be White Space! And Big Stuff!
As Laura demonstrates below, the beauty of the Big Stuff is usually in direct 
proportion to its contrast with the Small Stuff.

“And what did you do this summer?”
“We went to a different country each week,” responded my 
four-year-old matter-of-factly.
The adult who’d asked the question looked at me in wide-
eyed envy and disbelief.
The truth is, we’d gone on a staycation, and traveled the 
world without ever leaving our hometown.
I have three children. My twins, a girl and a boy, are four, and 
their older sister is eight. We came up with the idea of a stayca-
tion last May, when summer loomed ahead with only the usual 
dismal daycare options for my younger children, who refer to 
daycare as “play, play, and cleanup.” More exciting options were 
available for my older daughter for portions of the day, but I 
wanted her to have time to relax and enjoy her siblings.
In fact, I was seeking something new and different for all 
three. My goal was to have them learn something this sum-
mer—and, of course, have fun. I wanted to be with them,  
but not spend the whole time breaking up their squabbles.  
I wanted all of us to be engaged, exploring and enjoying not 
only one another, but something more—a taste of the world 
beyond our own backyard. On a staycation there is no jet 
lag, no lost luggage, no time wasted navigating bus terminals, 
subways, and airports, none of the challenges of negotiating 
language barriers.
It all began when my elder daughter and I were celebrat-
ing some alone time with breakfast at a local restaurant. She

Mayor Yvette  
Dobisonne under-
stands that building  
a better Clovis means creating a better quality of life   
for all its members—stray dogs and cats included.
On Thursday, November 20th our City Commission  
has an opportunity to improve the lives of stray 
dogs and cats. We hope to:
❤ Implement a spay and neuter program
❤ Enhance the adoption program
❤ Support a licensing program
❤ Transition to a lethal injection program  
and ban the gas chamber
Please join Mayor Dobisonne in support of better 
treatment of our stray cat and dog population.
Contact your local City Commissioner today and  
let them know that our stray cats and dogs deserve 
humane treatment:

A professional (and affordable) photo from a vendor such as iStockPhoto.
com, Shutterstock.com, or Veer.com can make an effective ad easy to create. 
An image like the one below already has the background removed. You can 
practice with free images from CreativeCommons.org, and it’s possible you 
can even find exactly what you need there for a real job. 
This piece consists of three text frames and a photo.  
Having interesting fonts on hand (like Profumo, above)

Death, a necessary end
Of all the Wonders that I yet have heard, 
It seems to me most strange that men should fear, 
Seeing that death, a necessary end 
Will come, when it will come.
Caesar, Julius Caesar, 2.2.34–37
The readiness is all
There’s a special Providence in the fall of a sparrow.  
If it be now, ’tis not to come: if it be not to come, it will be now:  
if it be not now, yet it will come; the readiness is all. Since no  
man has aught of what he leaves, what is’t to leave be-times?  
Let be. 
Hamlet, Hamlet, 5.2.217–222
Ripeness is all
Edgar: 
Give me thy hand. Come on.
Gloucester: No further Sir, a man may rot even here. 
Edgar: 
What, in ill thoughts again?  
Men must endure 
Their going hence, even as their coming hither,  
Ripeness is all. Come on. 
Gloucester: And that’s true too.
The blinded Gloucester and his son, Edgar, King Lear, 5.2.6–11
Untimely death 
 
My mind misgives, 
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars, 
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date 
With this night’s revels, and expire the term 
Of a despisèd life closed in my breast: 
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
Romeo, Romeo and Juliet, 1.4.106–111
My grave
Go ask his name: if he be married, 
My grave is like to be my wedded bed.
Juliet, Romeo and Juliet, 1.5.135–136
Bid me go into a new made grave
Oh bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, 
From off the Battlements of any Tower, 
Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk 
Where Serpents are: chain me with roaring Bears 
Or hide me nightly in a Charnel house, 
O’ercovered quite with dead men’s rattling bones, 
With reeky shanks and yellow chopless skulls: 
Or bid me go into a new made grave, 
And hide me with a dead man in his grave, 
Things that to hear them told, have made me tremble, 
And I will do it without fear or doubt, 
To live an unstained wife to my sweet Love. 
Juliet, Romeo and Juliet, 4.1.77–88

Booklet handouts
InDesign has a fabulous feature for creating booklets. If you have a desktop 
printer that will print double-sided automatically, oh joy! Create a document 
with a page count that is a multiple of four, in “Letter - Half” size, “Portrait” 
(tall) orientation, with facing pages. Use master page items and automatic 
numbering as explained on pages 14–15. Use style sheets (Chapter 6) for the text. 
When you’re ready to print, go to the File menu and choose “Print Booklet…” 
to choose your specs (most likely 2-up Saddle Stitch with its default settings). 
Click “Print Settings…” to make any changes, and then click the “Printer…” 
button to get to your specific desktop printer settings; check the box for 
two-sided printing. I love making booklets.  :-)

Be absolute for death
Be absolute for death: either death or life 
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing 
That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art, 
Servile to all the skyie-influences 
That dost this habitation where thou keepst 
Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art death’s fool, 
For him thou labor’st by thy flight to shun, 
And yet runst toward him still. Thou art not noble, 
For all th’ accommodations that thou bearst, 
Are nursed by baseness. Thou’rt by no means valiant, 
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork 
Of a poor worm: thy best of rest is sleep, 
And that thou oft provok’st, yet grossly fear’st 
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thy self, 
For thou exists on many a thousand grains 
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not, 
For what thou hast not, still thou striv’st to get, 
And what thou hast, forget’st. Thou art not certain, 
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects, 
After the Moon. If thou art rich, thou’rt poor, 
For like an Ass, whose back with Ingots bows; 
Thou bearst thy heavy riches but a journey, 
And death unloads thee; Friend hast thou none. 
For thine own bowels which do call thee Sire, 
The mere effusion of thy proper loins, 
Do curse the Gout, Serpigo, and the Rheum 
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth, nor age 
But as it were an after-dinner’s sleep 
Dreaming on both, for all thy blessèd youth 
Becomes as agèd, and doth beg the alms 
Of palsied-Eld and when thou art old, and rich 
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty 
To make thy riches pleasant: what’s yet in this 
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life 
Lie hid moe thousand deaths; yet death we fear 
That makes these odds, all even. 
Duke Vincentio in disguise as a Friar, Measure for Measure, 3.1.5–41
p r e p a r i n g  f o r  d e a t h
He’s not prepared for death
To morrow? Oh, that’s sudden, Spare him, spare him: 
He’s not prepared for death; even for our kitchens 
We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven 
With less respect than we do minister 
To our gross-selves?
Isabella, Measure for Measure, 2.2.88–92
I would not kill thy Soul
If you bethink your self of any Crime 
Unreconcil’d as yet to Heaven, and Grace, 
Solicit for it straight.   .   .   .  
Well, do it, and be brief, I will walk by: 
I would not kill thy unpreparèd Spirit, 
No, Heavens fore-fend; I would not kill thy Soul.
Othello, Othello, 5.2.28–34
The secret house of death
Then is it sin, to rush into the secret house of death, 
Ere death dare come to us? How do you, Women? 
What, what good cheer? Why how now Charmian? 
My Noble Girls?  Ah Women, women! Look 
Our Lamp is spent, it’s out. Good sirs, take heart, 
We’ll bury him: And then, what’s brave, what’s Noble, 
Let’s do’t after the high Roman fashion, 
And make Death proud to take us.
Cleopatra, Antony and Cleopatra, 4.15.85–93

Give me my Robe, put on my Crown, I have

Writ in remembrance
Shakespeare was never afraid to think about or talk about or write 
about death. He left us with the most profound observations about 
this most profound moment of our lives. 
We can do as Shakespeare did—think about our deaths, about the 
deaths of our loved ones, about what we want to do for our own 
deaths, our last words. Write your thoughts down. Don’t ignore the 
most intense experience of your life. 
Write down your remembrances of friends and family so if you are 
gone before they are, they will have your memories of themselves.
To sue to live, I find I seek to die, 
And seeking death, find life. Let it come on.
Claudio, Measure for Measure, 3.1.42–43
I have hope to live and am prepared to die.
Claudio
My day is dim.
Henry ıv
I know my hour is come.
Brutus
Now my Spirit is going, I can no more. 
Antony
Open thy Gate of Mercy, gracious God,  
York
My Soul flies through these wounds, to seek out thee.  
The rest is silence.
Hamlet

Compound me with forgotten dust
What? Canst thou not forbear me half an hour? 
Then get thee gone, and dig my grave thy self, 
And bid the merry Bells ring to thy ear 
That thou art Crownèd, not that I am dead. 
Let all the Tears, that should bedew my Hearse 
Be drops of Balm, to sanctify thy head: 
Only compound me with forgotten dust. 
Give that, which gave thee life, unto the Worms.
Henry, 2 Henry ıv, 4.5.109–116
I am a scribbled form
Ay marry, now my soul hath elbow room, 
It would not out at windows, nor at doors, 
There is so hot a summer in my bosom, 
That all my bowels crumble up to dust: 
I am a scribbled form drawn with a pen 
Upon a Parchment, and against this fire 
Do I shrink up.
King John, King John, x.x.x
I here importune death a-while
I am dying Egypt, dying; only 
I here importune death a-while, until
Of many thousand kisses, the poor last 
I lay upon thy lips.
Antony, Antony and Cleopatra, 4.15.19–22
p r o c e s s  o f  d y i n g
importune: to beg not only urgently 
but persistently and to risk 
making a pest of yourself
scribbled form: hastily drafted 
document; a perishable,  
a momentary thing
forbear: spare
compound: mix
glose: flatter, deceive; 
a specious show.
I see my life in death
And to survey his dead and earthy Image: 
What were it but to make my sorrow greater?   .   .   .
That is to see how deep my grave is made, 
For with his soul fled all my worldly solace: 
For seeing him, I see my life in death.
King Henry on seeing the murdered Gloucester, 2 Henry vı, 3.2.148–152
Music at the close
Oh but (they say) the tongues of dying men 
Inforce attention like deep harmony; 
Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain, 
For they breathe truth, that breath their words in pain. 
He that no more must say, is listen’d more, 
Then they whom youth and ease have taught to glose, 
More are men’s ends mark’d, than their lives before, 
The setting Sun, and Music at the close 
As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last, 
Writ in remembrance, more than things long past; 
Though Richard my life’s counsel would not hear, 
My death’s sad tale, may yet undeaf his ear.
John of Gaunt, Richard īī, 2.1.5–16

Half-sheet flyer
For flyers you plan to print on your desktop printer, consider a half-sheet size. 
Create the flyer on half of a regular letter-size document, and when finished, 
select all, then Option-drag (PC: Alt-drag) the entire thing to the other side 
of the page. Cut them down the middle when printed.

A distinctive font in a large size can make a 
huge difference when competing with other 
flyers on a bulletin board. The tall, skinny size 
makes a visual impact as well. And use color!
This text is in one 
frame. This is easy to 
do when you know 
how to use the spacing 
features in InDesign 
(Chapter 3) and tabs 
(Chapter 4).
Notice this entire horizontal piece is one text frame. I used 
a Paragraph Rule (page 219) above the “Life Guidance” line, 
and Space After (page 55) in the cell phone style sheet. 
Because I used a style sheet (Chapter 6), I was able to add 
or delete points of Space After to quickly make it fit. 
This is not a text frame sitting on a 
rectangle. I filled the text frame itself 
with color, centered the text horizontally, 
and used the Text Frame Options to 
provide space above and below the text 
(as explained on page 33).

Experiment!
InDesign makes it easy to experiment with lots of possibilities for any job. 
Take your elements (or the elements your client wants) and keep playing with 
them—the more you play, the more ideas that appear. Look through your Idea

Going  
to Press
If you really are a new designer, chances 
are you’re not creating really complex jobs 
that need to be babied through a million-
dollar printing press. On the other hand, 
with the combination of InDesign in 
your hands and online print shops that 
can print your uploaded files in gorgeous 
full-color, there’s no reason for you to 
limit yourself. 
If you follow the guidelines in this 
chapter, your work should print just fine. 
I know I’ve said it before, but I’ll say it 
again—it is so exciting to be living in a 
world where we can print in full color for 
such affordable prices! Go to your room 
and design something!

Printing to your desktop printer
If you plan to print to your inexpensive little inkjet, you really don’t need to 
do anything but set up your printing specs in the Print dialog box, then click 
the Print button. The paper and quality that you choose in the Print dialog 
boxes for your specific printer make a huge difference in the output, so be sure 
to check them (see below). 
If you have a more expensive desktop laser printer, you have even more control 
over the quality. Surely you have downloaded the latest print driver so you have 
options for quality control. In the Print dialog box, click the button at the 
bottom, “Printer…,” to get access to your specific printer options. InDesign 
will yell at you (a little message pops up), but that’s okay. 
This is the opening 
Print dialog box. 
Click these options to 
customize the settings.
These are typical printing 
options—they will vary 
from printer to printer. 
For instance, my beloved 
Xerox Phaser prints two 
sides automatically.
Peruse each of these 
options so you know what 
the possibilities are.

• Page Setup: It’s always a good idea to check the Page Setup 
options before you print a new job for the first time. Click  
the “Page Setup…” button and make the simple adjustments, 
if necessary.
• Print Presets: If you print a certain type of job regularly, such as 
horizontal postcards or lengthy reports, set up your specs exactly 
how you want them, then click the “Save Preset” button at the 
bottom of the dialog box; name that preset collection of options.
From then on, those preset options will appear in the “Print Preset” 
menu at the top of the main Print dialog box, or you can choose it 
from the File menu to send the job straight to the printer. 
• If you’ve used an OpenType font with a huge character set, be sure to 
set the Fonts/Download option as “Subset,” as shown below.
If you find that really large graphic files choke your printer, change 
the Images/Send Data option to “Optimized Subsampling.”
Adjust these specs if large font 
files or graphic files cause trouble 
(like very slow printing, or no 
printing at all).

Preparing your files for a commercial press
If you plan to print anywhere besides your desktop printer, clean up your files 
before sending them off. Here is a list of the things I check:
• Check the Links panel to ensure that all graphics are linked properly. 
Also check that you don’t have any .jpg or .gif files in the document.
• Get rid of all unnecessary swatches, character styles, and paragraph 
styles: Go to each of the panel menus and choose, “Select All 
Unused.” InDesign will highlight all the unused swatches and styles. 
While they are selected, Option-click (PC: Alt-click) the Trash icon. 
In the Paragraph Styles panel, if “Basic Paragraph” is selected, you 
can’t throw anything away, so with the Command key held down, 
single-click on “Basic Paragraph” to deselect it from the collection, 
and then throw the rest of them away. 
• Make sure all Swatches are cmyk. If you have an rgb or lab color, 
double-click it and change it to cmyk. You can select more than 
one color to apply this change to them all at once.
• Make sure all Swatches are process colors, not spot colors.  
If you have a spot color, double-click it (or select and double- 
click several at once) and change it to “Process” (assuming you  
are printing cmyk).
• Check the fonts in the document: Use “Find Font…” from the  
Type menu to make sure there are no missing fonts and to make 
sure you haven’t used any TrueType fonts unnecessarily.
• If the press you use doesn’t like TrueType and you have to use it, 
outline it (select the text, go to the Type menu, and choose  
“Create Outlines”).
• Check every page to ensure there are no empty frames hanging 
around (only because it’s like having dirty socks all over the floor 
when company comes over): From the View menu, go down to 
Extras and choose, “Show Frame Edges.” If you see any empty 
frames, delete them. 
Also check the Preflight panel, as shown on page 214, then package your files 
(page 215) or make a pdf for print (page 216).

213
Check the press specs
The printing specifications for various projects have been mentioned here and 
there throughout this book, but I’ve made a table for easy reference, below. 
Desktop Printer
Commercial Press
document size
Depends on the paper tray 
in your printer. Check your 
manual.
Start at the end—that is, the 
printer determines the size of 
your document. Check the web 
site or call the press. 
document bleed
Not many desktop printers 
can print bleeds, so you 
must design with that in 
mind. 
Almost always provide a bleed, 
even if you don’t use it. Add 
one-eighth inch around all 
edges, generally. Check with 
the printer. See page 4.
color model
of images and text
Low-end desktop printers 
don’t care. If you have a 
high-end desktop printer, 
you probably care, so check 
the manual.
Always use cmyk.
See pages 132 and 164–165.
resolution of images
Even on low-end 
desktop printers, a very 
low-resolution file, such as 
72 ppi (typical of phone 
photos) will be fuzzy. Try 
to use at least 150 ppi for 
print.
Always use 300 ppi. You can 
get away with a little less, 
perhaps even down to 225, but 
try to stay around 300 ppi.
See pages 133 and 149.
fonts
Low-end printers don’t 
really care what font 
formats you use, and 
most high-end printers 
won’t either. But even so, 
PostScript or OpenType 
formats are generally safer 
than TrueType. 
The only problem format 
is TrueType, especially old 
TrueType. If you have a 
TrueType font you really have 
to use, change it to outlines., 
just to be safe. See page 187.

214
Check the Preflight panel
The Preflight panel is great. You might have seen a tiny message in the bottom-
left corner telling you there are “No errors” or “17 errors.” That’s the Preflight 
panel constantly checking your document to make sure it’s printable. It has its 
own defaults that it checks, but you can create customized profiles so it checks 
what you want it to check. For instance, for my jobs that go to a high-end 
press, such as this book, I tell the Preflight panel to make sure all my graphics 
are cmyk, of a certain resolution, the links are good, no fonts are missing, etc.
	
Check out the Preflight panel
1 There are two easy ways to open the Preflight panel: 
• Click on the very tiny triangle in the bottom-left corner 
of the window, as shown below, to pop up the menu. 
Choose “Preflight Panel.”
• Or from the Window menu, slide down to “Output,” and 
then choose “Preflight.”
2 This opens the Preflight panel that tells you what is wrong with your 
document, according to its defaults. 
Click on the page number to go 
directly to that item so you can fix it. 
Your custom profile will appear here.
3 To customize the panel, go to the Preflight panel menu and choose 
“Define Profiles…,” or choose “Define Profiles…” from the pop-up 
menu as shown in Step 1. 
 
 Click the + button to add 
a new profile. Name it, and 
disclose each of the headings 
and make your selections. 
If you don’t know what 
something is, leave it alone.

  1 1 :  g o i n g  t o  p r e s s
215
Package your files
When sending your files off to be printed, you need to include the InDesign 
file itself, of course, plus every graphic that is linked to the file, plus the fonts. 
To make this process so easy, InDesign has a Package feature. It gathers up 
everything it needs and puts copies of everything into a new folder, with the 
word “folder” at the end of the name. 
In the process of packaging, InDesign does a preflight check, similar to the 
one you can do yourself on the opposite page. If you did a good job cleaning 
up your file and doing a preflight, there should be no errors in the packaging. 
	
Package your file
1 From the File menu, choose “Package….” You’ll see this dialog box:
note: As mentioned above, InDesign puts a copy of everything in the packaged folder, 
so now you have duplicates of every little thing in that file. You might want to delete the 
original folder in which you were storing most of these files, but first check to make sure you 
don’t throw out some great graphics that you thought you were going to use, but didn’t.
2 If there are errors, as shown above, click the heading in the sidebar to 
see what the problems are. If they can’t be fixed by selecting the file 
and clicking the “Update” button, you have to cancel this and go back 
to the InDesign file and fix it. 
The warning symbol indicates 
there is an issue. In this case, the 
file accidentally includes  
an rgb graphic.
Click the appropriate heading 
in the sidebar to see specifically 
what the problem is. 
Click the button, “Show Problems 
Only,” to pinpoint the issue. 
If there are no issues, click 
“Package…” and let InDesign  
do its work. 

  1 1 :  g o i n g  t o  p r e s s
216
Export to pdf
If you have created a lovely piece and you either want to send it via email, post 
it online, or upload it to an online print shop for printing, you can create a 
pdf very quickly in InDesign. 
1 From the File menu, slide down to “Adobe pdf Presets.”
2 Of the options in the submenu, choose the one appropriate for the 
destination of the pdf:
• If the pdf is to be viewed on a screen of any sort, choose 
“Smallest File Size….”
• If you’re sending the pdf to someone to print on her desktop 
printer, choose “High Quality Print….”
• If you are sending this job to a high-end press and they have 
told you to send a press-quality file, choose “Press Quality….”
• If you’re uploading the file to a print shop and their specs say to 
create a pdf/x-4, then, of course, choose “pdf/x-4….”
3 Name the file and save into a folder where you can find it again.
Now, that is the quick and easy way to make a pdf and will probably be 
sufficient for most of your needs. However, pdfs are hugely complex and 
mysterious and magical files. If you plan to produce a pdf for the press, get in 
touch with a representative of that press and make sure you are preparing the 
file appropriately. She may give you certain specifications to add to the dialog 
boxes before you save the file. 

  1 1 :  g o i n g  t o  p r e s s
217
Save a file for earlier versions
InDesign doesn’t have an option to save in an earlier version, but you can export 
any file as an “InDesign Markup” file. A file saved this way can be opened with 
a cs4 version of the program, although if it includes features that are specific to 
cs5 or cs5.5, those features (and perhaps the content) will be lost. The person 
running cs4 must make sure his app is completely up to date (go to the Help 
menu, choose “Updates…,” and follow the directions).
1 From the File menu, choose “Export….”
2 At the bottom of the Export window, click the “Format” menu  
(PC: “File type” menu) and choose “InDesign Markup (idml).”
3 Choose the folder in which to save the file, then click Save. 
The new file will have a .idml extension on the file name, instead  
of .indd.
If you need to take a file all the way back to cs3, you’ll need to export it as an 
idml file, open it in cs4, then from cs4, export it in the Interchange inx format. 
Save a corrupted file
Sometimes a file starts crashing InDesign and you don’t know why. The first 
thing to try is the technique mentioned above—export the file as an idml file, 
then reopen it in InDesign. This has saved my boompah a number of times, 
including this very chapter file. Also try making a snippet of a page that you 
think is causing trouble, delete the original page, and replace with the snippet 
(see page 219).
Occasionally I have had files that crashed when creating an index or making a 
table of contents. I have been able to save the files by cleaning them up with 
the proverbial fine-tooth comb—getting rid of missing fonts that the file was 
still calling on, deleting unused style sheets, updating graphics, etc. 
To prevent a file from crashing, this is the most important tip: Regularly do 
a “Save As” and replace the file. InDesign has almost unlimited Undos (the 
number of times you can undo something you just did). But it has to keep 
track of these in memory; when memory gets full, InDesign crashes and you 
risk corruption. So every time you do something big, such as delete pages, 
add pages, add or delete large graphics, or make global changes such as search-
and-replace, save the file with the same name and replace it. Also “Save As” 
every hour or so. I can’t stress enough how important this is to keep things 
running smoothly!

Where to go from here
As I’ve mentioned, this small book only touches the tip of the InDesign iceberg. 
I hope it makes you want to find out more! Here are a couple of great places 
to learn more about this great tool.
• Help files: Adobe’s help files are pretty good. They include not 
only the entire manual (searchable), but links to people in the 
community who offer support, video tutorials from Adobe and 
others, and much more. 
• Real World Adobe InDesign cs5 (with free cs5.5 bonus content), 
an 800-page book by Olav Kvern, David Blatner, and Bob 
Bringhurst. If you can’t find the info you need in that book, it 
doesn’t exist. It’s available from Peachpit Press.
• Adobe InDesign cs5: Learn by Video series from Peachpit Press.
• Before & After: How to Design Cool Stuff        
You really must subscribe to Before & After, from John McWade. 
It’s the best thing I’ve ever seen on design, and now you know 
enough about InDesign to understand and benefit from the 
concepts John talks about. He provides short bits on specific 
aspects of design, with brilliant examples and explanations.  
www.BAmagazine.com
• The Non-Designer series, from Peachpit Press. These books 
comprise a pretty good education in the basics of design, plus 
the basics of using the Adobe Creative Suite software:
The Non-Designer’s Design Book 
The Non-Designer’s Type Book 
The Non-Designer’s Presentation Book 
The Non-Designer’s InDesign Book 
The Non-Designer’s Photoshop Book (by John Tollett; I helped)
The Non-Designer’s Illustrator Book (by John Tollett; I helped)
Plus these more advanced books:
Robin Williams Design Workshop (with John Tollett)
Robin Williams Handmade Design Workshop:  
Create Handmade Elements for Digital Design  
(my most favorite book ever, by Carmen Sheldon, and I helped)

Things yet to know!
Sadly, this small book does not do justice to the depth of InDesign. Here are a few other things  
I use all the time. To learn more about these, check the resources listed on the opposite page.   
Paragraph Rules: I love paragraph rules. They are 
lines/strokes that you can attach to text. Every 
heading in this book that has a dotted line 
beneath it is using a paragraph rule; it is built 
into that style sheet so I just type and the dotted 
line appears. In fact, paragraph rules are dividing 
each of the paragraphs on this page (and nested 
styles that format the words in front of the 
colons automatically). 
More on the Pen tool: The Pen tool is amazingly 
useful and it would be worth your time to learn 
it well. 
Layers: InDesign has a Layers panel that makes 
it easy to create variations of a job and to 
organize lots of pieces. The layers are similar 
to the layers in Photoshop, except they do not 
interact with each other.  
Spell Check: InDesign’s spell check can check 
many different languages, and you can create 
your own user dictionary. Turn on Dynamic 
Spelling (from the Edit menu) so typos are fixed 
while you write. 
Find and Change (search and replace): The 
Find/Change feature (in the Edit menu) is very 
powerful. Not only can you search for text 
and formatting, you can also search for object 
formatting as well, such as 3-point red strokes 
and change them to 4-point green strokes. If you 
know what grep is, you can search with grep.
Notes: You can attach notes to your work, 
either to remind you of things to do or to add 
comments for your client or to share a job with 
your coworkers, etc. They are quite powerful. 
Get “Notes” from the Type menu. 
Preferences: Be sure to poke around in the 
Preferences panes! 
Snippets: Select everything on your page and 
drag it to the Desktop; InDesign creates a 
snippet with the extension of .idms. Send this 
to someone else who uses InDesign (along 
with any linked graphics) and she can drag it 
onto an InDesign page, on which the snippet 
completely recreates itself. If you’re having 
trouble with corruption, this can sometimes 
help clean up a file. 
Object styles: Just like paragraph styles, you 
can create object styles to quickly format 
graphics. For instance, you might want a light 
drop shadow and a half-point black stroke on 
every photograph in your brochure; make that 
an object style and apply it with a click. Get 
the Object Styles panel from Window > Styles.
Guides: You can change the colors of the 
guides, which can be very useful. For instance, 
when working on a page that is completely 
covered by a graphic, you can change your 
guides to a very pale gray and choose to show 
them in front so you can see them. 
Anchored objects: The little blue square on 
a text frame lets you attach, or anchor, any 
object (including another text frame) to a 
text frame. You might want to insert a photo 
directly into the text, as shown on page 87, or 
let it float outside the frame and move along 
with the text as you edit, as shown above-
right. Just hover over the blue square and read 
its tool tip to learn how to use it. If you want 
to remove it, from the Object menu, choose 
Anchored Object > Release. 
Import options: Both text files and graphic 
files have import options in which you can 
customize the file as you bring it in. To get 
the options, check the box in the Place dialog 
box, “Show Import Options.”
