Introduction
H
i there, and welcome to BlackBerry Curve For Dummies. If you already 
have a BlackBerry Curve, this is a great book to have around when you 
want to discover new features or need something to slap open and use as a 
quick reference. If you don’t have a Curve yet and have some basic questions 
(such as “What is a BlackBerry Curve?” or “How can a BlackBerry Curve help 
me be more productive?”), you can benefit by reading this book cover to 
cover. No matter what your current BlackBerry user status (BUS, for short), 
this book helps you get the most out of your BlackBerry Curve.
Right off the bat, BlackBerry Curve isn’t a fruit you find at the supermarket 
but rather an always-connected smartphone that has e-mail capabilities and 
a built-in Internet browser. With your BlackBerry Curve, you’re in the privi­
leged position of always being able to receive e-mail and browse the Web.
On top of that, a BlackBerry Curve has all the features you expect from a per­
sonal organizer, including a calendar, to-do lists, and memos. Oh, and did we 
mention that a BlackBerry Curve also has a built-in mobile phone? Talk about 
multitasking! Imagine being stuck on a commuter train: With your Curve by 
your side, you can compose e-mail while conducting a conference call, all 
from the comfort of your seat.
That’s not all. BlackBerry Curve goes a step further to make it more fun for 
you to own this device. You can snap a picture with its camera, record a 
funny video, listen to your music collection, and enjoy watching that video 
on YouTube.
In this book, you find all the basics, but we also go the extra mile and high­
light some of the lesser-known (but still handy) features of the BlackBerry 
Curve. Your Curve can work hard for you when you need it to and can play 
hard when you want it to.
About This Book
BlackBerry Curve For Dummies is a comprehensive user guide as well as a 
quick user reference. The book is designed so that you can read it cover to 
cover if you want, but you don’t need to read one chapter after the other. 
Feel free to jump around while you explore the different functionalities of 
your BlackBerry Curve.

BlackBerry Curve For Dummies 
We cover basic and advanced topics, but we’ll stick to those that we think 
are the most practical and frequently used. If you use or want to use a certain 
function of your BlackBerry Curve, it’s likely covered here.
Who Are You?
We tried to be considerate of your needs, but because we’ve never met you, 
our picture of you is as follows. If you find that some of these images are true 
about you, this might just be the book for you:
	
✓	You have a BlackBerry Curve and want to find out how to get the most 
from it.
	
✓	You don’t have a BlackBerry Curve yet and are wondering what one 
could do for you.
	
✓	You’re looking for a book that doesn’t assume that you know all the 
jargon and tech terms used in the PDA industry. (PDA stands for per­
sonal digital assistant, by the way. Take that, you jargon, you!)
	
✓	You want a reference that shows you, step by step, how to do useful 
and cool things with a BlackBerry Curve without bogging you down with 
unnecessary background or theory.
	
✓	You are tired of hauling your 10-pound laptop with you on trips and are 
wondering how to turn your BlackBerry Curve into a miniature traveling 
office.
	
✓	You no longer want to be tied to your desktop system for the critical 
activities in your life, such as sending and receiving e-mail, checking 
your calendar for appointments, getting directions, and surfing the Web.
	
✓	You like to have some fun, play games, and be entertained from a device 
but don’t want to carry an extra game gadget in your bag.
What’s in This Book
BlackBerry Curve For Dummies consists of six parts, and each part consists of 
different chapters related to that part’s theme.

 Introduction
Part I: Getting Started 
with BlackBerry Curve
Part I starts with the basics of your Curve. You know: what it is, what you 
can do with it, and what elements make it up. We describe how you navigate 
using the QWERTY keyboard. We also show you how to personalize and 
express yourself through your BlackBerry Curve. This part wraps up with 
must-knows about security and where to go for help when you get into trou­
ble with your BlackBerry Curve.
Part II: Organizing with Curve
Part II deals with the fact that your BlackBerry Curve is also a full-fledged 
PDA. We show you how to get your Curve to keep your contacts in Contacts 
as well as how to manage your appointments and meetings in Calendar. You 
also find out how to use the Clock application to set an alarm, set a timer, 
and set your device to Bedside mode. You explore the Password Keeper 
application to centralize your passwords. And finally, you see that most 
BlackBerry applications interconnect, working hard for you.
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve
Part III shows you what made BlackBerry what it is today: always-connected 
e-mail. We also get into the other strengths of the BlackBerry — Web surfing 
functionality — but we don’t stop there. We point out how you can use other 
forms of messages, such as text messaging and instant messaging. You also 
find out about unique forms of messages on the BlackBerry, PIN-to-PIN mes­
sages and BlackBerry Messenger. And if you have a BlackBerry Curve 8900, 
rest assured that your BlackBerry will be a good companion when you’re 
traveling because we show you how to use its GPS. (The BlackBerry Curve 
8500 doesn’t have an internal GPS.)
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies 
on Your Curve
You find the fun stuff in Part IV. Rock your world and use your Curve to play 
music, watch videos, and take pictures. You also get the scoop on how to 
record videos and sample ring tones. Plus you get timesaving shortcuts on 
the Media applications.

Part V: Working with BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager
In Part V, you find details of BlackBerry Desktop Manager and some of the 
hoops you can put it through with your BlackBerry Curve, including making 
backups and installing BlackBerry applications from your desktop to your 
Curve. You also find out how to port data from older devices — BlackBerry 
or not — to your new Curve. And we didn’t forget to cover important stuff, 
such as data-syncing your appointments and contacts with desktop applica­
tions, such as Outlook.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
All For Dummies books include The Part of Tens, and this book is no differ­
ent. In Part V, we show you places to get cool BlackBerry Curve accessories, 
where to get great applications, and useful mobile Web sites to visit.

Getting Started 
with BlackBerry 
Curve

In this part . . .
T
he road to a happy and collaborative relationship 
with your BlackBerry Curve starts here. Chapter 1 
covers all the nuts and bolts: how the BlackBerry Curve 
works, its look and feel, and its connectivity. Chapter 2 
describes how to navigate the Curve using the QWERTY 
keyboard. Chapter 3 discusses customizing your Curve 
and offers timesaving shortcuts.

Chapter 1
Can’t Go Wrong with the 
Best-Selling Smartphone
In This Chapter
▶	Checking out your BlackBerry Curve behind the scenes
▶	Seeing what your BlackBerry Curve can do
▶	Handling the hardware
A
s of May 2009, the BlackBerry Curve family was deemed the best-selling 
smartphones in the United States. We’re curious — what convinced 
you to buy this particular handheld mobile device? Was it the stats? The 
BlackBerry Curve 8500’s cool optical trackpad? The compact size? The 
always-connected e-mail? The multimedia player to replace your iPod or 
iPhone? Or did you get a really good deal? The list goes on and on — and 
we might never hit on the exact reason you got yours. For whatever reason 
you bought your BlackBerry Curve, congratulations; you made an intelligent 
choice.
The same smarts that made you buy your BlackBerry Curve are clearly at 
it again. This time, your intelligence led you to pick up this book, perhaps 
because your intuition told you there’s more to your BlackBerry Curve than 
meets the eye.
Your hunch is right. Your BlackBerry Curve can help you do more than you 
thought. For example, your BlackBerry Curve is a whiz at making phone calls, 
but it’s also a computer that can check your e-mail and surf the Web. We’re 
talking World Wide Web here, so the sky’s the limit. Help is always at your fin­
gertips instead of sitting on some desk at home or at the office:
	
✓	Need to check out the reviews of that restaurant on the corner?
	
✓	Need to know — right now — what’s showing in your local movie the­
aters, or what the weather will be like tonight, or what’s the best place 
to shop the sales?
	
✓	Need to know your current location and get directions to that cozy bed-
and-breakfast, or retrieve news headlines, or check stock quotes?

10
Part I: Getting Started with BlackBerry Curve 
	
✓	Want to do some online chatting or view some pictures online?
	
✓	Hanker to network with your old classmates?
You can do all these things (and more) with your BlackBerry Curve.
	
BlackBerry Curve is also a full-fledged personal digital assistant (PDA). Out of 
the box, it provides you with the organizational tools you need to set up to-do 
lists, manage your appointments, take care of your address books, and more.
Being armed with a device that’s a phone, an Internet connection, a PDA, a 
GPS device (Curve 8900), and a full-on media player makes you a powerful 
person. With your BlackBerry Curve (along with this resourceful book), you 
really can increase your productivity and become better organized. Watch 
out, world! BlackBerry Curve–wielding powerhouse coming through!
If you stick with us, you find out all you need to get the most out of your 
device or maybe even save a troubled relationship. (Well, the last one is a bit 
of an exaggeration, but we got your attention, right?)
How It All Works: The Schematic 
Approach
If you always ask, “How do they do that?” you don’t have to go far. This sec­
tion is just for you.
The role of the network service provider
Along with wondering how your BlackBerry Curve actually works, you might 
be wondering why you received your BlackBerry Curve from a network ser­
vice provider such as T-Mobile or AT&T rather than from RIM (Research In 
Motion). After all, RIM makes the BlackBerry Curve. Why did you need to go 
through a middle person?
That’s an excellent question, and here’s the quick-and-dirty answer: RIM 
needs a delivery system — a communication medium, as it were — for its 
technology to work. Not in a position to come up with such a delivery system 
all by its lonesome, RIM partnered (and built alliances across the globe) with 
what developed into its network service providers — the big cellphone com­
panies. These middlemen support the wireless network for your BlackBerry 
Curve so that you can connect to the BlackBerry Internet service and get 
all those wonderful e-mails (and spend so much valuable time surfing the 
Internet). See Figure 1-1 for an overview of this process.

Network service providers don’t build alliances for nothing, right? In return, 
RIM gave them the right to customize the BlackBerry Curve firmware and add 
their carrier version of Application Center.
Connecting to your computer
Nowadays, a personal computer is a household necessity. You probably 
spend a lot of time using one, and it holds information you need. No surprise 
that BlackBerry works hand in hand with your PC and Mac. The USB cable 
that comes with your BlackBerry Curve does more than just charge your 
device.
Part V helps you use your PC connection with the help of BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager and all the utilities that come with it. For instance, in Chapter 16, 
you find how to sync your device with the personal information manager 
(PIM) data that you keep in your PC. You can also read Chapter 17 for direc­
tions about switching from another device (even a non–BlackBerry device) to 
a new BlackBerry Curve. For example, you find out how to import your con­
tacts list into your new BlackBerry Curve. Chapter 18 tells you how to protect 
your data. Last, Chapter 19 talks about installing new applications on your 
BlackBerry Curve with the help of your PC.

12
Part I: Getting Started with BlackBerry Curve 
If you have a Mac, you’ll be happy to hear that RIM has rolled out BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager on the Mac. Read more in Chapter 17.
Rule the world with BlackBerry Curve 
in your hands
If you got your BlackBerry Curve from AT&T, chances are that your 
BlackBerry Curve will continue to work when you travel to, say, London 
or Beijing. All you need to worry about is remembering to turn on your 
BlackBerry Curve (and maybe the extra roaming charges).
Because your BlackBerry Curve is quad band, it works in more than 90 coun­
tries. What is quad band? Basically, different cellphone networks in different 
countries operate on different frequencies. For example, the United States 
and Canada operate on 850 and 1900 MHz, and Europe and Asia Pacific oper­
ate on 900 and 1800 MHz.
	
Your quad-band BlackBerry Curve is designed to work on 850 MHz, 900 MHz, 
1800 MHz, and 1900 MHz, so you’re covered almost wherever you go. Just to 
be sure, however, check with your network service provider to see whether 
your BlackBerry Curve will work at your destination before you hop on a 
plane.
	
Nothing stands still in this world, and this saying is proved by the fact that 
Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) has spawned High Speed 
Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), which is a technology that has been growing 
because it works on the same GSM phone infrastructure. HSDPA is available 
in the United States through most major network service providers and com­
petes in the marketplace against EvDo (Evolution Data Optimized) from Code 
Division Multiple Access (CDMA).
What’s all this alphabet soup mean to you? CDMA and GSM aren’t compat­
ible. Your phone works on only one technology. When you travel outside 
North America, you face the burning question: CDMA or GSM? (Read: Will 
my BlackBerry Curve work on this country’s network?)
Your BlackBerry Curve runs on GSM, so you should be okay to travel outside 
the United States. Most non–North American countries are on GSM networks. 
If you’re a CDMA kind of person, you might have some “issues,” as they say. 
When in doubt, talk to your network service provider.

13
 Chapter 1: Can’t Go Wrong with the Best-Selling Smartphone 
Oh, the Things You Can Do!
Always-connected e-mail used to be one of the primary factors that made 
BlackBerry very attractive and was likely first in the long list of reasons you 
got yours. And if you need to go global, you can use your BlackBerry in more 
than 100 countries. Just hop off your flight, turn on your BlackBerry Curve, 
and voilà: You can receive and send e-mails whether you’re in Hong Kong, 
London, or Paris. Your significant other can get in touch with you wherever 
you are — just to say hi or to remind you that you promised Aunt Edna a 
bottle of Chanel No. 5.
	
Make sure that your network service provider has the technology to go global. 
See the preceding section for more info. Generally, you can receive and send 
e-mails just like you do when you’re at home. Whether you have T-Mobile in 
the United States or Rogers in Canada, your BlackBerry Curve will work if you 
have a full data and voice plan. Check with your carrier before you start your 
trip.
Although e-mail and communication are your BlackBerry Curve’s strengths, 
they aren’t the only things it can do. The following sections go beyond e-mail 
to point out some of the device’s other major benefits.
Know your BlackBerry history
Your BlackBerry Curve is truly a wondrous 
thing, boasting many features beyond your ordi­
nary mobile phone. And its “sudden” popularity 
didn’t happen overnight. Like any other good 
product, BlackBerry has come a long way from 
its (relatively humble) beginnings.
In the days when the PalmPilot ruled the PDA 
world, RIM was busy in its lab, ignoring the 
then-popular graffiti input method and design­
ing a device with a QWERTY keyboard (the kind 
of keyboard people were already used to from 
working on their computers). RIM didn’t stop 
there, however. It added an always-connected 
e-mail capability, making this device a must-
have among government officials as well as 
finance and health professionals.
To meet the needs of government officials and 
industry professionals, RIM made reliability, 
security, and durability the priorities when man­
ufacturing its devices. Today, the BlackBerry 
Curve comes from the same line of RIM family 
products, inheriting all the good genes while 
boosting usability and adding more functions 
to its core BlackBerry applications. As a result, 
BlackBerry is popular among both prosum­
ers (professional customers) and consumers. 
Starting with BlackBerry Pearl, RIM has been 
targeting the mainstream consumer market. 
Clearly, with BlackBerry Curve, RIM is winning 
the hearts of consumers while maintaining its 
hold on the enterprise market.

All-in-one multimedia center
Previously, many people hesitated to buy a BlackBerry because of the lack of 
multimedia functions. They wanted a camera and audio and full video play­
back. BlackBerry has changed all that and has more features than you may 
expect. Not only does your BlackBerry Curve have a high-resolution mega­
pixel camera (see Chapter 13) — but it also has a memory slot for a microSD 
chip (see Chapter 2).
Your BlackBerry Curve can function as the following:
	
✓	A music player
	
✓	A video player and recorder
	
✓	A digital camera
	
✓	A portable flash drive
	
✓	Your personal photo collection
Internet and social networking 
at your fingertips
Yup, with the new BlackBerry Curve on a 3G network, you can surf the 
Internet nearly as smoothly as you do on a desktop computer. You’ll get an 
alert when your stock is tanking. True, that isn’t fun, but you want this infor­
mation as quickly as possible. With your BlackBerry Curve, you can continue 
chatting with your friends through all types of instant messaging applica­
tions, just as if you never left your desktop PC, and your friends will thank 
you for persuading them not to buy that losing stock.
Intrigued? Read how BlackBerry Curve can take full advantage of the Web in 
Chapter 11.
On-the-go GPS
Your BlackBerry Curve (only the 8900 and some 8500 models) comes with an 
onboard GPS that allows you to pinpoint your location with the BlackBerry 
Map application and other third-party applications such as Google Maps and 
TeleNav.

 Chapter 1: Can’t Go Wrong with the Best-Selling Smartphone 
Me and my great personal assistant
You might be saying, “But I’m really a busy person, and I don’t have time to 
browse the Web. What I do need is an assistant to help me better organize my 
day-to-day tasks.” If you can afford one, by all means go ahead and hire a per­
sonal assistant. The next best thing is a personal digital assistant (PDA). Just 
as people come in many types, so do many PDAs.
Whip out that BlackBerry Curve of yours and take a closer look. That’s right; your 
BlackBerry Curve is also a full-fledged PDA, helping you increase productivity:
	
✓	Remember all your acquaintances (Chapter 4)
	
✓	Manage your appointments (Chapter 5)
	
✓	Securely keep a list of passwords (Chapter 6)
A computer in the palm of your hand
Remarkable communication device? Check.
Full-fledged PDA? Check.
Full-featured media player? Check.
These capabilities are just the tip of the iceberg. Don’t underestimate the 
device because of its size: Your BlackBerry Curve is also a powerful computer.
Need convincing? Here goes. Out of the box, with no fiddling, it comes with 
a great set of organizational and productivity tools. Software developers 
besides RIM are taking advantage of this growing market, which means that 
hundreds of applications are out there for you. For example, you can down­
load graphics-intensive games or a mortgage calculator.
Download? Absolutely! BlackBerry Curve supports the downloading of 
applications through BlackBerry Browser. And, of course, downloading the 
application can be accomplished both wired and wirelessly (or over the air 
[OTA]). In April 2009, RIM rolled out BlackBerry App World (the company’s 
response to the popular Apple’s App Store),which allows BlackBerry owners 
to easily browse for BlackBerry applications on their device and download 
them directly. Other third-party BlackBerry application stores are tremen­
dously popular in the BlackBerry community, such as the CrackBerry.com 
App Store powered by MobiHand. (For more information on downloading 
third-party applications, see Chapter 19.)

16
Part I: Getting Started with BlackBerry Curve 
	
What’s the difference between BlackBerry App World and BlackBerry 
Application Center?
	
✓	Application Center most likely came with your BlackBerry Curve.
	
✓	Application Center contains only applications that your network service 
provider wants you to see.
	
✓	App World needs to be manually downloaded by you from RIM’s Web 
site.
	
✓	App World has an unfiltered list of BlackBerry applications for you.
Look, Dad! No hands!
Your BlackBerry Curve can be equipped with a stereo headset that doubles 
as a mic for hands-free talking. This accessory is your doctor’s prescription 
for preventing the stiff neck that comes from wedging your BlackBerry Curve 
against your ear with your shoulder. It helps free your hands so that you 
can eat Chinese takeout. Some places require you by law to use an earphone 
while driving and talking on a cellphone.
	
Avoid using your cellphone while driving, hands-free or not.
But RIM didn’t stop with just your standard wired earphones. BlackBerry 
Curve also supports cool wireless earphones based on Bluetooth technology. 
How could a bizarrely colored tooth help you here? Bluetooth is the name 
for a (very) short-distance wireless technology that connects devices. See 
Chapter 7 for how to connect your BlackBerry Curve to a Bluetooth headset.
Putting a sentry on duty
The virtual world isn’t exempt from general human nastiness; in fact, every 
day a battle is fought between those trying to attack a system and those 
trying to protect it. A computer connected to the Internet faces an extra risk 
of being cracked by a hacker or infected by a virus. (Viruses try to replicate 
themselves and generally bug you.)
Fortunately, security is a BlackBerry strong point. Viruses often come as 
e-mail attachments. However, BlackBerry supports very few file types out of 
the box (mostly images and documents). You won’t face threats from e-mails 
with these attachments. And in an enterprise environment, the data that you 
send to or get from the PDA is encrypted (coded) to prevent snooping.

17
 Chapter 1: Can’t Go Wrong with the Best-Selling Smartphone 
	
RIM also has a Signature process for application developers that forces devel­
opers to identify themselves and their programs if they’re developing any 
applications for the BlackBerry that need to integrate with either BlackBerry 
core applications or the OS.
Remember the I love you and Anna Kournikova viruses? These are virtual evils 
transmitted through e-mail, scripts, or sets of instructions in the e-mail body 
or attachment that can be executed either by the host e-mail program — or, 
in the case of an attachment, by the program associated with the attached 
file. Fortunately, BlackBerry’s Messages doesn’t support scripting languages. 
BlackBerry’s viewer for such files doesn’t support scripting either, so you 
won’t be facing threats from e-mails having these attachments.
	
The security measures that RIM implemented on the BlackBerry platform have 
gained the trust of the U. S. government as well as many of the Forbes Top 500 
enterprises in the financial and health industries.
Saving power
Anyone with previous BlackBerry experience 
knows that BlackBerry is typically a highly 
efficient power consumer. With the older 
BlackBerry, you can go for five days on a single 
charge. The addition of a color, high-resolution 
screen, GPS (only Curve 8900 and some 8500 
models) and Bluetooth support have weakened 
the power efficiency. Power requirements have 
increased so much that you need to recharge 
roughly every two days. But hey, now you have 
a GPS on deck!

R
egardless of whether you previously owned a BlackBerry, you might 
have heard that the new BlackBerry Curve is totally different. You 
might be wondering how you spot a new BlackBerry Curve. Looks aren’t 
deceiving in this case. From the outside, the new BlackBerry Curve 8500 is 
updated with an optical trackpad instead of a trackball — no more problems 
with the trackball getting stuck. The BlackBerry Curve 8500 design also has 
three media keys on the top. The BlackBerry Curve 8900 is slim and has a 
simple and elegant physical design. Bear with us, and you will be master of 
your BlackBerry Curve in no time.
Anatomy 101: The Body and Features 
of Your BlackBerry Curve
In this section and the following sections, we show you all the keys and fea­
tures on your BlackBerry Curve. Figure 2-1 shows the primary ones for the 
Curve 8500 (see Figure 2-2 for the additional keys on the 8900), which are as 
follows:
	
✓	Convenience keys: With BlackBerry Curve, you have two convenience 
keys. By default, the convenience keys are preprogrammed to open an 
application.

20
Part I: Getting Started with BlackBerry Curve 
	
	In Chapter 3, we show you how to reprogram the convenience keys so 
that they display the programs you use the most.
	
✓	Display screen: This screen is the graphical user interface (GUI) on your 
BlackBerry Curve.
	
✓	End key/Power key: While on a phone call, use this key to end your call. 
If not on a phone call, press this key to jump straight back to the Home 
screen from wherever you are. Press and hold this key to turn your 
BlackBerry Curve on or off.
	
✓	Escape key: This is the key to the right of the trackball or trackpad. 
Use this key to cancel a selection or return to a previous page within an 
application. If you hold this key down, it returns you to the Home screen 
from any program.
	
✓	Media keys (BlackBerry Curve 8500): There are three media keys: Play/
Pause key, Next Track key, Previous Track key. Play/Pause is used also 
to open Media Player (Chapter 14).
	
✓	Menu key: Use this key to display the full menu of the application you’re 
using.
	
✓	microSD slot: The BlackBerry Curve has a microSD slot beneath the bat­
tery cover.
	
✓	Mute key: This key mutes a call when on a call.
	
✓	Screen Lock key: This key lets you quickly lock your screen before you 
slide your phone into your pocket.
	
✓	Send key: Because your BlackBerry Curve can also function as a cel­
lular phone, this key allows you to go straight to the Phone application, 
regardless of which application you are currently using. When you are 
already in the Phone application, the send key starts dialing the number 
you entered.
	
✓	Trackball or trackpad: The Curve 8900 has a trackball; the 8500 has a 
trackpad. Navigate the display screen in four directions with the track­
ball or trackpad. When you press the trackball or trackpad, the short 
menu of the application you’re using appears.
	
✓	QWERTY keyboard: The keyboard is the input for your BlackBerry 
Curve — very straightforward.

21
 Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry Curve
Two types of contextual menus can appear on your BlackBerry Curve:
	
✓	Full menu: Lists all the options and features you can perform (see 
Figure 2-3, left). The full menu is accessed by pressing the menu key.
	
✓	Short menu: An abbreviated list of the full menu (see Figure 2-3, right). 
The short menu is accessed by pressing the trackball when you aren’t 
prompted by a dialog box.

When you first turn on your BlackBerry Curve, the display screen dis­
plays the Home screen, which is your introduction to the interface of your 
BlackBerry Curve. The different icons represent the different applications 
in your BlackBerry Curve. See Figure 2-4 for an example of what your Home 
screen might look like.

Depending on the theme you’re using, your applications might be listed in 
text form rather than as icons. Remember that how your GUI looks depends 
on how you want it to look because the font and theme are customizable. For 
more on personalizing your BlackBerry Curve, see Chapter 3.
QWERTY keyboard
Unlike some PDA manufacturers — and they know who they are — RIM 
(Research In Motion) chose the same QWERTY keyboard you know and love 
from your personal computer as the BlackBerry Curve input method. That 
was a great decision because it means you don’t have to master some new 
way of writing — graffiti or whatever — to get data into your Curve. All you 
have to do is type on a familiar keyboard — and you already know how to 
do that.
How you type on your BlackBerry Curve is up to you, but most people find 
that typing with two thumbs is the most efficient method.
Escape key
Simple yet useful, the escape key allows you to return to a previous screen or 
cancel a selection. The escape key is the arrow key to the right of the trackball.
Trackball and trackpad
You can perform two functions with the trackball or trackpad: navigating and 
pressing. When you navigate with your trackball or trackpad, you can move 

24
Part I: Getting Started with BlackBerry Curve 
the cursor about the display screen in four directions. In a text-filled screen, 
such as the body of an e-mail, you can usually navigate through the text in 
four directions.
Depending on where you are on the BlackBerry Curve’s screen, different situ­
ations determine what happens when you press the trackball or trackpad, 
also called the trackball or trackpad click:
	
✓	Display a drop-down list: When you’re in a choice field, pressing the 
trackball or trackpad displays a drop-down list of choices for that field.
	
✓	Confirm a choice: The trackball or trackpad can also function as a 
confirmation key. For example, when you need to select a choice in a 
drop-down list, you can press the trackball or trackpad to confirm the 
highlighted choice.
	
✓	Display a short menu: When you’re in a text-filled screen (an e-mail 
body or a Web page), pressing the trackball or trackpad displays a short 
menu (refer to Figure 2-3, right), which is just an abbreviated version of 
the full menu. You get the full menu by pressing the menu key.
Menu key
The menu key brings up the full menu for the application you’re using. When 
on the Home screen, pressing the menu key displays a list of applications 
installed on your BlackBerry Curve. If you want to change the order of the 
applications in the list, see Chapter 3.
	
When you are on the Home screen, the behavior of the menu key depends 
on the BlackBerry Curve theme. The behavior just described is based on the 
default theme. See Chapter 3 for more on changing themes.
The microSD slot
Your BlackBerry Curve comes with 1GB of internal memory. If you’re a music 
or video fan, you know that 1GB can’t keep you entertained for a long com­
mute. But no need to worry. The folks at RIM incorporated a microSD slot 
into your BlackBerry Curve so that you can add extended memory and store 
all the media files you want. The BlackBerry Curve supports up to a whop­
ping 32GB microSD card.
You can purchase a microSD card separately for a relatively low price these 
days. At the time of this writing, a 16GB microSD card costs about $20, and a 
32GB microSD costs about $40.

Changing options
Throughout this book, you see examples of an options field being changed 
to a different value. The easiest way to change the value in a field is to first 
use the trackball or trackpad to highlight the field. Then press the trackball 
or trackpad to display a drop-down list of choices, such as the ones shown 
in Figure 2-6, and finally press the trackball or trackpad again to make your 
selection.

 Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry Curve
General Keyboard Shortcuts
In many instances in this book, when you’re asked to go to a BlackBerry 
Curve application (Profile, for example), you have to first highlight the appli­
cation icon from the Home screen and then click the trackball or trackpad. 
You may be thinking, “Hey, there must be a shortcut for this,” and you’re 
right. This section and the ones that follow cover such general keyboard 
shortcuts, all in the name of making your life easier. (Shortcuts that are more 
application-specific are covered in the chapter dealing with the particular 
application.)
Before you get all excited about shortcuts, you need to take care of one bit 
of housekeeping. To use some of these general keyboard shortcuts, you first 
have to make sure that the Dial from Home Screen setting — buried deep 
within the Phone application — is turned off.
Inquiring minds want to know, so we’ll tell you. The Dial from Home Screen 
option is designed for users who make frequent BlackBerry Curve phone 
calls. If you aren’t a frequent phone user and want to access all applications 
with a press of a button, get ready to ditch Dial from Home Screen.
Here’s how to turn off the Dial from Home Screen setting:
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Curve Home screen, highlight the Phone applica­
tion and then press the trackball or trackpad.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select the Options menu.
	
	 A screen that lists a range of options appears.
	
3.	Select General Options.
	
	 The General Options screen appears.
	
4.	Highlight the Dial from Home Screen field and then select No.
	
	Doing so shuts down the Dial from Home Screen option, enabling you to 
use Home-screen shortcuts.
	
5.	To confirm your changes, press the menu key and then select Save 
from the menu that appears.
	
If you’re a frequent phone user on your BlackBerry Curve, as opposed to 
an e-mail or Internet user, you may not want to turn off the Dial from Home 
Screen feature.

28
Part I: Getting Started with BlackBerry Curve 
Using Home screen shortcuts
When you disable the Dial from Home Screen feature, you are free to use any 
Home screen shortcut. (The name for these shortcuts is actually a pretty 
good fit because you can use these shortcuts only while you are on the Home 
screen.)
Okay, here goes. To call up the application listed in the first column of Table 2-2, 
press the key listed in the table’s second column.

Other (non–Home screen) shortcuts
The following shortcuts can be used at any time, regardless of which screen 
you’re in — or whether you have Dial from Home Screen enabled, for that 
matter:
	
✓	Soft Device Reset (also known as the three-button salute): Pressing 
Alt+Shift+Del forces a manual soft reset, which is just what you need 
when your BlackBerry Curve crashes or when you install an applica­
tion and it needs a manual reset. You can do a hard reset by pulling 

29
 Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry Curve
out the battery from the back of the BlackBerry Curve. Without getting 
into the technical jargon, from a BlackBerry Curve user’s perspective, a 
hard reset takes longer and is usually the last resort to solve any issues 
before contacting the help desk.
	
✓	HelpME: In the BlackBerry world, SOS is actually spelled Alt+Shift+H. 
Use it when you’re on the phone with technical support. (It gives sup­
port personnel info such as your BlackBerry PIN, memory space, and 
version number so that they have information about your BlackBerry 
Curve when they try to troubleshoot your problems.)
	
	The BlackBerry PIN isn’t a security password; rather, it is a unique 
number that identifies your BlackBerry Curve, sort of like a serial 
number. But unlike a serial number, a BlackBerry can message another 
BlackBerry by using PIN-to-PIN messages (please see Chapter 9).

egardless of how long you’ve had your BlackBerry Curve — one week, 
one month, one year, or more — you’ll want to have it around for as 
long as you possibly can. (Or at least until you have the bucks for that way-
cool new model that’s surely coming down the pike.) And for the duration 
that you do have your device, you’ll want to trick it out so that it doesn’t feel 
and sound exactly like the millions of other BlackBerry Curve devices out 
there. (C’mon, admit it — your BlackBerry Curve is definitely a fashion state­
ment, so you’d better feel comfortable with what that statement is saying.)
In addition to customizing your BlackBerry Curve so that it expresses the 
inner you, you want to make sure that you keep your Curve in tip-top shape 
by watching out for such things as its battery life and information security. 
Luckily for you, this chapter puts all such worries to rest by filling you in on 
all you need to know to keep your BlackBerry Curve a finely tuned (and yet 
quirkily personal) little smartphone.
Making Your BlackBerry Curve Yours
BlackBerry smartphones are increasingly popular, so much so that close to 
30 million BlackBerry smartphones are out there serving the needs of people 
like you. Because of this fact, we’re certain that finding ways to distinguish 
your BlackBerry Curve from your colleagues’ is high on your list of priorities.

32
Part I: Getting Started with BlackBerry Curve 
Branding your BlackBerry Curve
Like any number of other electronic gadgets, your BlackBerry Curve comes 
to you off the shelf fitted with a collection of factory settings. This section 
helps you put your name on your BlackBerry Curve, figuratively and literally. 
You can start by branding your name on your BlackBerry Curve. Follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Press the menu key, and then highlight and select the Options 
(wrench) icon.
 	
2.	Select the Owner setting.
	
	 You see places to enter your owner information.
	
3.	Enter your name in the Name field and your contact information in 
the Information field.
	
	 The idea here is to phrase a message (like the one shown in Figure 3-1) 
that would make sense to any possible Good Samaritan who might find 
your lost BlackBerry Curve and want to get it back to you.
	
	 If you lock or don’t use your BlackBerry Curve for a while, the standby 
screen comes on, displaying the owner information that you entered. 
Read how to lock your BlackBerry Curve, either manually or by using an 
auto setting, in the later section “Keeping Your BlackBerry Curve Safe.”
	
4.	Press the menu key and then select Save from the menu that appears.
	
Figure 3-1: 
List your 
owner info 
here.
	
Choosing a language, any language
Branding your BlackBerry Curve with your own John Hancock is a good start, 
but setting the language to your native tongue so that you don’t need to hire a 
translator to use your Curve is equally important — and equally easy. You can 

33
 Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry Curve — and Keeping It Happy
also set your input method of choice here, which can affect whether AutoText 
shows up. Don’t worry. We explain what that means in the next section.
Here’s how you choose a language:
	
1.	Press the menu key and then select the Options (wrench) icon.
	
2.	Select the Language setting.
	
	 Here, you can choose the language and input method of your choice.
	
3.	 Select the Language field and then select your native tongue.
	
	 Depending on your network provider, as well as your region (North 
America, Europe, and so on), the language choices you have can vary. 
Most smartphones sold in North America default to English or English 
(U.S.).
	
	 If your network provider supports it, you can install more languages 
in your BlackBerry Curve by using Application Loader in BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager. For more information on Application Loader, see 
Chapter 19.
	
4.	Press the menu key and then select Save from the menu that appears.
Isn’t it great when you can actually read what’s onscreen? But don’t think 
that you’re finished quite yet. You still have some personalizing to do.
Typing with ease using AutoText
Even the most devoted BlackBerry Curve user has to admit that typing on 
a full keyboard is easier than thumb-typing on a BlackBerry Curve. In an 
attempt to even the score a bit, your BlackBerry Curve comes equipped with 
an AutoText feature, which is a kind of shorthand that can cut down on how 
much you have to type.
AutoText basically works with a pool of abbreviations that you set up. You 
then just type an abbreviation to get the word you associated with that 
abbreviation. For example, after setting up b/c as an AutoText word for 
because, any time you type b/c, you automatically get because onscreen.
	
Your BlackBerry Curve comes with a few default AutoText entries. Here are 
some useful ones:
	
✓	mypin: Displays your BlackBerry PIN
	
✓	mynumber: Displays your BlackBerry phone number
	
✓	myver: Displays your BlackBerry model number and OS version

34
Part I: Getting Started with BlackBerry Curve 
	
The whole AutoText thing works best if you set up your own personal code, 
mapping your abbreviations to their meanings. (This is why we discuss 
AutoText as part of personalization.)
To set up your own code, do the following:
	
1.	Press the menu key and then select the Options (wrench) icon.
	
2.	Select the AutoText option.
	
	 Here, you can choose to see (or search for) existing AutoText words or 
create new ones.
	
3.	Press the menu key and then select New.
	
	The AutoText screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-2.
	
Figure 3-2: 
Create 
AutoText 
here.
	
	
4.	In the Replace field, enter the characters that you want to replace (in 
this example, b/c). In the With field, type what replaces your charac­
ters (in this example, because).
	
5.	In the Using field, choose between the SmartCase and Specified Case 
options.
 
• SmartCase capitalizes the first letter when the context calls for 
that, such as the first word in a sentence.
 
• Specified Case replaces your AutoText with the exact text found in 
the With field.
	
	 For example, say you have the AutoText bbg set up for the term blackber­
ryGoodies.com and you want it to appear as is, in terms of letter cases 
(the first b isn’t capitalized). If you use Specified Case, your AutoText 
always appears as blackberryGoodies.com no matter where it is in the 
sentence. If you instead were to choose SmartCase for this particular 
AutoText, it would be capitalized as the first word in a sentence, which 
isn’t what you want.

35
 Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry Curve — and Keeping It Happy
	
6.	In the Language field, select All Locales from the list of options.
	
	 Our preference for this setting for any self-created AutoText is All 
Locales. What this means is that regardless of the language input 
method (for example, English UK, English U.S., or French), any self-
created AutoText is available for you to use. So in the case of the 
AutoText bbg (blackberryGoodies.com), whether you are typing in French 
or Chinese, you can use this AutoText. On the other hand, if you select 
only the French input method for bbg as the Language field, you would 
be able to use this only if your input method is set to French in the 
Language option.
	
	 You can choose the input method in the Language options. We go over 
choosing a language input method next.
	
7.	Press the menu key and then select Save from the menu that appears.
If you specify a language input method other than All Locales, your input 
method setting in the Language option must match the Language field in 
AutoText to use your newly created AutoText. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Press the menu key and then select the Options (wrench) icon.
	
2.	Scroll through the list of options until you find the Language setting 
and then select it.
	
	 Here, you can choose the language and input method.
	
3.	Select the Input Method field and then select the input method you 
need from the list.
	
	 For your new AutoText setting to work (assuming that you didn’t choose 
All Locales as the language for your AutoText), this option needs to 
match the input method set in your Language option.
	
4.	Press the menu key and then choose Save.
Getting your dates and times lined up
Having the correct date, time, and time zone is important when it comes to 
your BlackBerry Curve for, we hope, obvious reasons. Many of the fine fea­
tures that make up the BlackBerry Curve core experience, as it were, depend 
on the time, date, and time zone being accurate.
Need an example? How about your BlackBerry Curve calendar events? 
Imagine, if you will, that you have a make-or-break meeting set for 9 a.m. (in 
your time zone) with a client in Paris, who is in who-knows-what time zone. 

36
Part I: Getting Started with BlackBerry Curve 
You definitely want to be on time for that appointment, but you probably 
won’t be if you’re planning on having your BlackBerry Curve remind you — 
that is, if you haven’t set up the appropriate date, time, and time zone. Follow 
these steps to do that:
	
1.	Press the menu key and then select the Options (wrench) icon.
	
2.	Select the Date/Time setting.
	
	 The Date/Time screen appears.
	
3.	For the Time Zone field, select a time zone.
	
	 The Date/Time screen confirms the time zone that you chose. Note 
that if you travel to a different time zone, you need to adjust this field 
because it does not adjust automatically.
 	
4.	For the Time field, select the proper hour and minutes.
	
	 Here, you adjust the time to current hours and minutes.
	
5.	For the Date field, select the date.
	
6.	For the Date/Time Source field, select Network.
	
	 This sets your date and time source to your service provider’s server 
time (see Figure 3-3). By having this option set to Network, the time will 
always be accurate. However, if you are someone who always has the 
time set 10 minutes earlier than the actual time (so you can be on time 
for those important meetings), you would set the Date/Time Source field 
to BlackBerry.
	
7.	Press the menu key and then select Save from the menu that appears.
	
	 Doing so saves your date and time settings in perpetuity — a really long 
time, in other words.

 Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry Curve — and Keeping It Happy
Customizing your screen’s look and feel
Right up there with making sure that your date and time settings are accu­
rate is getting the display font, font size, and screen contrast to your liking. 
Now we know that some of you don’t give a hoot if your fonts are Batang or 
Bookman as long as you can read the text, but we also know that other folks 
won’t stop configuring the fonts until they get them absolutely right. For all 
you tweakers out there, here’s how you play around with your BlackBerry 
Curve’s fonts:
	
1.	Press the menu key and then select the Options (wrench) icon.
	
2.	Select the Screen/Keyboard setting.
	
	 The Screen/Keyboard screen appears with various customizable fields, 
as shown in Figure 3-4.
	
Figure 3-4: 
The Screen/
Keyboard 
screen, 
waiting for 
personaliza-
tion.
	
	
3.	For the Font Family field, select a font from the drop-down list.
	
	 You can choose three to ten fonts, depending on your provider.
	
4.	For the Font Size field, select a font size.
	
	 One thing to keep in mind is that the smaller the font size, the more you 
can see onscreen; however, a smallish font is harder on the eyes.
	
	 Note: As you scroll up and down the list of fonts and font sizes, notice 
that the text The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog 
below the Font Style setting takes on the look of the selected font and 
size so that you can preview what the particular text looks like. (In case 
you were wondering, this sentence uses every letter in the alphabet.)
	
5.	Press the menu key and then select Save from the menu that appears.

38
Part I: Getting Started with BlackBerry Curve 
Similar to setting Font Size, you can play with Font Style to set it to Bold, 
Italic, or Plain.
With fonts out of the way, it’s time to change the brightness of your screen 
as well as a few other viewing options, including how to program the conve­
nience key to exactly what is convenient to you:
	
1.	Press the menu key and then select the Options (wrench) icon.
	
2.	Select the Screen/Keyboard setting.
	
	 The Screen/Keyboard screen appears with its various customizable 
fields (refer to Figure 3-4).
	
3.	For the Backlight Brightness field, select the desired brightness from 
the drop-down list.
	
	 You can choose 0 to 100, where 0 is the darkest and 100 is the brightest.
	
4.	For the Left Side Convenience Key Opens field, select from the drop-
down an application for your left convenience key to open when you 
press it.
	
5.	Repeat Step 4 for the Right Side Convenience Key Opens field.
	
6.	For the Backlight Timeout field, select the time period for the back­
light timeout.
	
	 You can choose 10 seconds up to 2 minutes. The lower this setting, the 
less time you’ll have backlighting (after you press each key). However, a 
low setting helps you conserve battery life.
	
7.	Change the Automatically Dim Backlight field, if necessary.
	
	 When you’re outdoors with a bright sun on your BlackBerry 
Curve, you’ll probably have difficulty reading the screen. When the 
Automatically Dim Backlight feature is on (the default), it autoadjusts 
the backlight to be bright enough for you to read your BlackBerry Curve 
while outdoors.
	
8.	For the Horizontal Sensitivity field, select how sensitive you want the 
trackball or trackpad to be horizontally.
	
	 You can choose 20 to 100, where 20 is the least sensitive and 100 is the 
most sensitive.
	
9.	For the Vertical Sensitivity field, select how sensitive you want the 
trackball or trackpad to be vertically.
	
	 Again, 20 is the least sensitive and 100 is the most sensitive. Keep in 
mind that if your trackball or trackpad is too sensitive, it will be hard to 
control.
	
10.	To confirm your changes, press the menu key and then select Save.

39
 Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry Curve — and Keeping It Happy
Choosing themes for your 
BlackBerry Curve
Your BlackBerry Curve is preloaded with different themes, which are pre­
defined sets of looks (wallpaper, fonts, menu layout). You can download 
themes from BlackBerry Curve’s mobile Web site.
Follow these steps to change your theme:
	
1.	Press the menu key and then select the Options (wrench) icon.
	
2.	Select the Theme setting.
	
	 You see a list of available themes.
	
3.	Select the theme you want.
	
	 You see a preview of the theme you selected (see Figure 3-5).
	
4.	Press the menu key and then select Activate.
	
	You should be able to see the change immediately.
It usually takes a while for a new theme to fully activate.
	
You can download other themes. Just remember that you have to use your 
BlackBerry Curve, not your PC, to access the following URL: http://
mobile.blackberry.com.

Wallpapering your BlackBerry Curve
Like your desktop PC, the BlackBerry Curve Home screen can be personal­
ized with wallpaper. You set an image to be your BlackBerry Curve Home 
screen background by using the BlackBerry Curve Media application. Follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Press the menu key and then select the Media icon.
	
	 The following categories are in Media: Music, Video, Ring Tones, 
Pictures, and Voice Notes.
	
2.	Select the Pictures category.
	
	 Doing so brings up four choices:
  
• Camera: Turns on the BlackBerry camera.
 
• All Pictures: Displays all the pictures stored on your BlackBerry.
 
• Picture Folders: Displays the pictures stored on your BlackBerry, 
organized by folders.
 
• Sample Pictures: Displays the pictures that came with your 
BlackBerry.
	
3.	Select the picture you want to use for your Home screen background.
	
	 The selected picture appears in full-screen view.
	
4.	Press the menu key and then select Set as Home Screen Image.
	
	 The picture is now your new Home screen wallpaper.
	
5.	Press and hold the escape key to return to the Home screen and see 
the result.
You can download free wallpapers from the following Web sites (as long as 
you use your BlackBerry Curve, not your PC, to access the URLs):
	
✓	http://mobile.blackberry.com
	
✓	www.blackberrywallpapers.com
	
✓	www.crackberry.com/free-wallpapers
After you have your BlackBerry Curve’s look and feel just the way you want, 
there’s just one thing left to do before you can move on. You need to get your 
BlackBerry Curve to sound how you want it to.

 Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry Curve — and Keeping It Happy
Letting freedom ring
The whole appeal of the BlackBerry phenomenon is the idea that this little 
electronic device can make your life easier. One of the ways it accomplishes 
this is by acting as your personal reminder service — letting you know when 
an appointment is coming up, a phone call is coming in, an e-mail has arrived, 
and so on. Basically, your BlackBerry Curve is set to bark at you if it knows 
something it thinks you should know, too. Figure 3-6 lists the kinds of things 
your BlackBerry Curve considers bark-worthy, ranging from browser alerts to 
task deadlines.
	
Figure 3-6: 
Set 
attention-
needy 
applications 
here.
	
Different people react differently to different sounds. Some BlackBerry Curve 
barks would be greatly appreciated by certain segments of the population, 
whereas other segments might react to the same sound by pitching their 
BlackBerry Curve under the nearest bus. The folks at Research In Motion are 
well aware of this and have devised a great way for you to customize how 
you want your BlackBerry Curve to bark at you — they call it your profile.
You can jump right into things by using a predefined profile, or you 
can create your own profile. The upcoming sections take a look at both 
approaches.
Whether you create your own profile or customize a predefined profile, each 
profile is divided into several categories that represent the application for 
which you can define alerts.

42
Part I: Getting Started with BlackBerry Curve 
	
In BlackBerry OS 4.6, the application to set your profiles is named Profiles and 
includes the following categorizations:
	
✓	BlackBerry Messenger Alert: Alerts you when BlackBerry Messenger 
has something to notify you regarding new contact notification.
	
✓	BlackBerry Messenger New Message: Alerts you when BlackBerry 
Messenger has a new message from a BlackBerry Messenger contact.
	
✓	Browser: Alerts you when you receive a new channel push, which is just 
a Web page sent to your BlackBerry Curve.
	
✓	Calendar: Alerts you when you have upcoming appointments.
	
✓	Level 1: Alerts you with a special tone when you have an urgent (as 
defined by your sender) e-mail. A BlackBerry PIN-to-PIN message can 
also be considered urgent. For more on PIN-to-PIN, see Chapter 9.
	
✓	Messages [Email]: Alerts you when a new e-mail message is in your 
inbox.
	
✓	Phone: Alerts you if you have an incoming call or a new voice mail.
	
✓	SMS Text: Alerts you when you have an SMS (Short Messaging Service) 
message.
	
✓	Tasks: Alerts you to an upcoming to-do deadline.
	
In BlackBerry OS 5.0, profiles can be found in the Sounds application, and 
Sound items are organized into the following categories:
	
✓	Phone: Alerts you if you have an incoming call or voice mail.
	
✓	Messages: Alerts you if you have an incoming e-mail, SMS, MMS, or 
BlackBerry PIN message. Also, you can set different alerts for each indi­
vidual e-mail account.
	
✓	Instant Messages: Alerts you if you have any BlackBerry Messenger 
Alerts; if you have third-party instant messaging installed (such as 
Google Talk), you can set the alerts here as well.
	
✓	Reminders: Alerts you if you have set up calendar reminders, tasks 
reminders, or e-mail follow-up flags (see Chapter 8).
	
✓	Other: This category is a notification setting for third-party applications 
such as Facebook a well as the Browser application. 
You can personalize all the listed applications according to how you want to 
be alerted. Because how you customize them is similar, we use one applica­
tion, Messages, as an example in the text that follows.
After this, we go over creating a profile from scratch. You may be wondering 
why you need to create a profile if you can personalize the predefined ones. If 
your needs are different from the predefined settings, creating a profile is the 
way to go.

 Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry Curve — and Keeping It Happy
Using factory settings
	
If you’re okay with customizing a predefined, factory-loaded profile, just do 
the following if you have OS 4.6:
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Curve Home screen, select the Profile application.
	
	A pop-up screen appears, listing different profiles (Quiet, Vibrate, 
Normal).
	
2.	Select Advanced, which appears at the end of the list.
	
	 A screen appears, listing different profiles.
	
3.	Highlight the Normal profile in the list, press the menu key, and then 
select Edit.
	
	 The Normal screen appears, listing the applications with alert capabili­
ties mentioned in the preceding section (refer to Figure 3-6).
	
4.	Select the Messages [Email] application.
	
	 You’re faced with the Messages for Normal profile, which is divided into 
an Out of Holster section and an In Holster section, as shown in Figure 3-7. 
A holster (in this context) is simply the belt clip or case that houses your 
BlackBerry Curve while you aren’t using it. BlackBerry Curve is smart 
enough to know when it is in a holster. With RIM’s BlackBerry holster, a 
magnet built into the holster autoswitches the Curve to In Holster mode 
within the selected profile.
	
5.	For the Out of Holster field, select a tone from the drop-down list of 
alert options.
	
	 Doing so enables sound in Out of Holster mode.
	
Figure 3-7: 
Choose 
a tone to 
alert you 
when your 
BlackBerry 
Curve is out 
of its 
holster.
	

44
Part I: Getting Started with BlackBerry Curve 
	
6.	For the Ring Tone field, select the tune you want from the drop-down 
list.
	
	 As you scroll through the tunes and pause, your BlackBerry Curve plays 
the tune so that you know what it sounds like before you change it.
	
7.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
As you may have guessed from how Messages in the Normal profile is 
divided, your BlackBerry Curve can notify you in different ways based on 
whether your BlackBerry Curve is in plain view (Out of Holster) or tucked 
away next to your belt (In Holster). To set up a different sound for In Holster 
mode, just put the necessary info in the fields for the In Holster section — 
and be sure to choose a different tune this time. (Choosing the same tune 
kind of defeats the purpose, doesn’t it?)
	
If you’re like us and get more than 200 e-mails daily, you probably don’t want 
your BlackBerry Curve sounding off 200 times a day. You can set up your 
Curve so that it notifies you only if an e-mail has been marked urgent, requir­
ing your immediate attention. You can do this by setting the notification for 
your Messages application to None for both In Holster and Out of Holster. 
Then, in the Level 1 option (refer to Figure 3-6), you can set your desired noti­
fication for both In Holster and Out of Holster. That way, you conveniently 
filter any unnecessary e-mail notifications, leaving just the urgent stuff to 
sound off to you.
	
For BlackBerry OS 5.0, follow these steps to customize alerts for your 
BlackBerry:
	
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Curve Home screen, select the Sounds application.
	
	
	A pop-up screen appears, listing different profiles (Silent, Vibrate, 
Normal, Loud, Medium, Phone Calls Only, All Alerts Off).
	
2.	Select Edit Profiles, which appears at the end of the list.
	
	 A screen appears, listing different profiles.
	
3.	Highlight the Normal profile in the list, press the menu key, and then 
select Edit.
	
	 The Normal screen appears, listing the applications with alert capabili­
ties mentioned in the preceding section (refer to Figure 3-6).
	
4.	Expand the Messages heading by pressing the trackball or trackpad 
once, and select any of the e-mail accounts you have.
	
	A screen appears with options to set the ring tone, LED, and vibration.
 	
5.	For Ring Tone, you can set the following options:
 
• Ring Tone: The ring tone you want.
 
• Volume: How loud you want the ring tone, from Silent to 10 (the 
loudest).

45
 Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry Curve — and Keeping It Happy
 
• Count: The number of times the ring tone repeats, from 1 to 3.
 
• Play Sound: Whether the ring tone will play while your BlackBerry 
Curve is in or out of the holster or whether it will always play.
	
6.	For LED, set it On or Off.
	
7.	For vibration, set it to be On, Off, or Custom.
	
	  If you choose Custom, you have the following options:
 
• Length: How long each vibration lasts: Short, Medium, or Long.
 
• Count: The number of times the vibration occurs; you can choose 
1, 2, 3, 5, or 10.
 
• Vibrate: Whether the vibration will occur while your BlackBerry is 
in or out of holster or will always vibrate.
	
8.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
Creating your own profile
You need to know which applications on your BlackBerry Curve have alert 
capabilities because then you can personalize each “Hey, you!” to your 
liking. You can have your BlackBerry Curve so personalized that you can tell 
whether you have a phone call or an incoming message just by how your 
BlackBerry Curve sounds.
If you’re already familiar with the different applications and are clear how 
you want each one to alert you, go on and create your own profile. As we 
mention earlier, you can achieve the same result by personalizing the pre­
defined profiles that come with your BlackBerry Curve. But if you like to keep 
the predefined profiles the way they are, create a new profile by following the 
steps for your OS version.
	
If you have OS 4.6, follow these steps to create a new profile:
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Curve Home screen, select the Profile application.
	
	A pop-up screen appears, listing different profiles (Quiet, Vibrate, 
Normal).
	
2.	Select Advanced, which appears at the end of the list.
	
	 A screen appears, listing different profiles.
	
3.	Press the menu key and then select New.
	
	 A new Profile screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-8, prompting you to 
name your profile.

46
Part I: Getting Started with BlackBerry Curve 
	
Figure 3-8: 
Create your 
own profile 
from this 
menu in 
OS 4.6.
	
	
4.	In the Name field, enter a name for your profile.
	
	 For this example, just type MyOwnProfile.
	
5.	Configure your new profile.
	
	 To customize each of the nine applications, refer to the OS 4.6 part of 
the preceding section, “Using factory settings,” Steps 3–7.
	
6.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
	
	 Your newly created profile appears in the Profile screen.
	
7.	Select My Profile.
	
	 You can start to use your newly created profile.
	
If you have OS 5.0, follow these steps to create a new profile:
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Curve Home screen, select the Sound application.
	
	A pop-up screen appears, listing different profiles.
	
2.	Select Edit Profiles, which appears at the end of the list.
	
	 A screen appears, with a line Add Custom Profile and also a list of 
profiles.
	
3.	Select Add Custom Profile.
	
	 A New Custom Profile screen appears, prompting you to name your profile.
	
4.	In the Name field, enter a name for your profile.
	
	 For this example, just type MyOwnProfile.
	
5.	Configure your new profile.

47
 Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry Curve — and Keeping It Happy
	
	 To customize each of the categories of applications, refer to the OS 5.0 
part of the preceding section, “Using factory settings,” Steps 3–7.
	
6.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
	
	 Your newly created profile appears in the Profile screen.
	
7.	Select My Profile.
	
	 You can start to use your newly created profile.
	
You can switch between your current profile and the Quiet profile by pressing 
and holding the # key.
Regardless of whether the ring tone is for an incoming call or an incoming 
e-mail, you can download more ring tones to personalize your BlackBerry 
Curve. Also, you can use any MP3 file in your Media application as your per­
sonalized ring tone. Follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Home screen, press the menu key and then select the Media 
application.
	
2.	In Media, select the Music category.
	
	 Doing so brings up various music classifications such as Artist, Album, 
and Genres.
	
3.	Highlight the music file you want to use for your ring tone.
	
4.	Press the menu key and then select Set as Phone Tune.
	
	 This sets the music file as your new phone tune.
	
5.	Press and hold the escape key to return to the Home screen.
Keeping Your BlackBerry Curve Safe
The folks at RIM take security seriously, and so should you. Always set 
up a password on your BlackBerry Curve. If your BlackBerry Curve hasn’t 
prompted you to set up a password, you should do so immediately. Here’s 
how:
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Curve Home screen, select the Options (wrench) 
icon.
	
2.	Select the Password option.
	
3.	Highlight the Password field and then select Enabled.

48
Part I: Getting Started with BlackBerry Curve 
	
	 All this does for now is enable the Password feature. You won’t be 
prompted to type a password until you save the changes you just made.
	
4.	Click the Set Password button.
	
	 At this time, you should be prompted to enter a new password, as 
shown in Figure 3-9.
	
	 If you have set a password before, the button will be called Change 
Password.
	
Figure 3-9: 
It’s time to 
enter a new 
password.
	
	
5.	Type a password and then type it again for verification.
	
	 From this point on, whenever you lock your BlackBerry Curve and want 
to use it again, you have to type the password. How do you lock your 
BlackBerry Curve? Good question. Keep reading.
	
When you set your password on a BlackBerry Curve, you must make sure 
that you know what letters your password uses and not just which keys you 
pressed. You need the same password if you link your BlackBerry Curve with 
Desktop Manager for synchronization. For more on Desktop Manager, read 
Chapters 16, 17, and 18.
Setting up your password is a good first step, but just having a password 
won’t help much if you don’t take the further step of locking your BlackBerry 
Curve when you aren’t using it. (You don’t want people at the office or at 
the table next to you at the coffee shop checking out your e-mails or phone 
history when you take a bathroom break, do you?) So how do you lock your 
BlackBerry Curve? Let us count the ways . . . we came up with two.

49
 Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry Curve — and Keeping It Happy
You can go the Autolock after Timeout (also known as Security Timeout) 
route by following these steps:
	
1.	Press the menu key and then select the Options (wrench) icon.
	
2.	Select the Password option.
	
	 The Password screen appears.
	
3.	Highlight the Security Timeout field and then select the desired 
minutes.
	
	 The preset times range from 1 minute to 1 hour.
	
4.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
	
	 If you’re more the hands-on kind of person, you can go the Manual Lockout 
route by scrolling to the keyboard Lock icon on your Home screen and press­
ing the trackball. (Pressing K while on the Home screen does the same thing. 
Make sure to turn off the Dial from Home Screen option. See Chapter 2 for 
more info on using Home screen shortcuts.)
As a shortcut, to lock your BlackBerry Curve, just press and hold the asterisk 
(*) key.
No matter what route you take to lock your BlackBerry Curve, you use your 
(newly created) password to unlock it when you get back from wherever 
you’ve been.
Blocking That Spam
With your BlackBerry Curve, you can block certain e-mails, SMS numbers, or 
BlackBerry PINs from getting to your inbox. It’s like having your own spam 
blocker on your Curve!
To set up your personal spam blocker, follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Home screen, select the Options (wrench) icon.
	
2.	Select the Security option.
	
3.	Select the Firewall option.
	
	 This opens the Firewall screen.
	
4.	Highlight the Status field and select Enable.
	
	 This enables the spam blocker.

50
Part I: Getting Started with BlackBerry Curve 
	
5.	Under Block Incoming Message, make sure what you want to block is 
selected:
 
• SMS: Blocks SMS messages.
 
• PIN: Blocks BlackBerry PIN messages.
 
• BlackBerry Internet Service: Blocks e-mail messages (for example, 
the e-mail account that you set up from Google or Yahoo! Mail).
 
• Enterprise Email: Blocks enterprise e-mail (if you’re in a corporate 
e-mail network).
	
6.	In the Except Messages From area, select the desired options:
 
• Contact: Blocks everything except the e-mails and phone numbers 
in your Contacts.
 
• Specific Address: Blocks everything specified by you (you can set 
up the list described in Steps 7 and 8).
	
7.	Press the menu key and then select Configure Exception.
	
	 This opens the Firewall exception screen.
	
8.	Press the menu key and then select the desired options:
 
• Add Email: Specify the e-mail you want to block by selecting this 
check box.
 
• Add PIN: Specify the BlackBerry PIN you want to block by selecting 
this check box.
 
• Add Phone Number: Specify the SMS number you want to block by 
selecting this check box.

A
ddress books were around long before the BlackBerry was conceived. 
And BlackBerry Contacts serves the same function as any address 
book: a place where you record and organize information about people. 
However, Contacts also affords you a central place to reach your contacts in 
myriad ways: by landline phone; cellphone; e-mail; or the speedy messaging 
of PIN, SMS, MMS, or BlackBerry Messenger.
Most likely, in your busy lifestyle, you can benefit from using your BlackBerry 
Contacts if any of the following fits:
	
✓	You travel.
	
✓	You meet clients frequently.
	
✓	You spend a lot of time on the phone.
	
✓	You ask people for their phone number or e-mail address more than 
once.
	
✓	You carry around a paper day planner.
	
✓	Your wallet is full of important business cards, with phone numbers 
written on the backs, that you can never find.

54
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
If you’re one of those stubborn folks who insist they don’t need an address 
book — “I’m doing just fine without one, thank you very much!” — think of it 
this way: You’ve probably been using a virtual address book all the time, the 
one buried in your cellphone. That address book probably isn’t even a very 
good one! Read this chapter to see how to transfer all that good contact info 
from an old phone into your new BlackBerry–based Contacts.
Accessing Contacts
The Contacts icon looks like an old-fashioned address book. (Remember 
those?) You can see it highlighted in Figure 4-1. Opening Contacts couldn’t be 
simpler: Select the Contacts icon from the Home screen.
	
Figure 4-1: 
The 
Contacts 
icon.
	
You can also access Contacts from Phone, Messages, BlackBerry Messenger, 
and Calendar. For example, say you’re in Calendar and you want to invite 
people to one of your meetings. Look no further — Contacts is in the menu, 
ready to lend a helping hand.
	
Another way to get to Contacts is by pressing A while on the Home screen. Go 
to Chapter 2 for more on Home-screen shortcuts.
Working with Contacts
Getting a new gizmo is always exciting because you just know that your 
newest toy is chock-full of features you’re dying to try out. We bet you feel 
that way about your BlackBerry Curve. The first thing you’ll want to do is try 

55
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
to call or e-mail someone, right? But wait a sec. You don’t have any contact 
information yet, which means you have to type in someone’s e-mail address 
each time you send an e-mail — what a hassle.
It’s time to get with the plan. Most of us humans — social creatures that we 
are — maintain a list of contacts somewhere, such as in e-mail program, on 
an old cellphone, or on a piece of paper kept tucked away in a wallet. We’re 
pretty sure that you have some kind of list somewhere. The trick is getting 
that list into your BlackBerry Curve so that you can access your info more 
efficiently. The good news for you is that getting contact info into your 
BlackBerry Curve isn’t hard.
	
Often, the simplest way to get contact information into your BlackBerry Curve 
is to enter it manually. However, if you’ve invested a lot of time and energy in 
maintaining some type of Contacts application on your desktop computer, you 
may want to hot-sync that data into your Curve. For more on synchronizing 
data, check Chapter 16.
Creating a contact
Imagine that you just ran into Jane Doe, an old high school friend whom you 
haven’t seen in years. Jane is about to give you her number, but you don’t 
have a pen or pencil handy to write down her information. Are you then 
forced to chant her phone number to yourself until you can scare up a writ­
ing implement? Not if you have your handy BlackBerry Curve with you.
With BlackBerry in hand, follow these steps to create a new contact:
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Home screen, select the Contacts application.
	
	 As we mention earlier, you also can access Contacts from different appli­
cations. For example, see Chapter 9 to find out how to access Contacts 
from Messages.
	
2.	In Contacts, highlight Add Contact and then press the trackball or 
trackpad.
	
	 The New Contact screen appears, as shown in Figure 4-2.
	
3.	Enter the contact information in the appropriate fields.
	
	 Use your BlackBerry Curve keyboard to enter this information. Scroll 
down to see additional fields.
	
	 When entering an e-mail address, press the Space key to insert an at 
symbol (@) or a period (.). BlackBerry is smart enough to figure out that 
you need an @ or a period.

56
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
	
Figure 4-2: 
Create a 
new contact 
here.
	
	
	 We don’t think you can overdo it when entering a person’s contact infor­
mation. Enter as much info as you possibly can. Maybe the benefit won’t 
be obvious now, but when your memory fails you or your boss needs 
a critical piece of info that you happen to have, you’ll thank us for this 
advice.
	
4.	(Optional) For those contacts who have more than one e-mail address — 
say, work and home — just create another new, blank Email field for the 
same contact.
	
a.	Press the menu key.
	
b.	Select Add Email Address.
	
	 You can have up to three e-mail addresses per contact.
	
5.	Press the trackball or trackpad, and then select Save.
	
	 Your new contact is added to the list, as shown in Figure 4-3.
	
Figure 4-3: 
The 
Contacts 
screen after 
adding a 
contact.
	

57
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
	
Here’s something slick to know when you’re entering phone information for a 
contact: BlackBerry Curve can also dial an extra number after the initial phone 
number. That extra number can be someone’s extension, or a participant code 
on a conference number, or simply your voice mail PIN. When you’re entering 
the contact’s phone number, type the primary phone number, press the 
Alt key and press X, and then add the extension number. Say you enter 
11112345678X1111; when you tell your Curve to call that number, it will dial 
11112345678 first. Then you’ll see a prompt asking you to continue or skip 
dialing the extension.
	
The menu is always available through the menu key, but just for convenience, 
we prefer to use the trackball or trackpad, which displays a shortened menu 
list based on where you are.
Adding notes
The Notes field on the New Contact screen (you may need to scroll down a 
bit to see it) is useful for adding a unique description about your contact. For 
example, use the field to hold info to jog or refresh your memory with tidbits 
such as Knows somebody at ABC Corporation or Can provide introduction to a 
Broadway agent. Or perhaps your note is something personal, such as Likes 
golf; has 2 children: boy, 7, & girl, 3; husband’s name is Ray. It’s up to you. 
Again, the more useful the information, the better it will serve you.
Customizing with your own fields
Perhaps you’d like to add contact information that doesn’t fit into any of 
the available fields. Although you can’t really create additional fields from 
scratch, you can commandeer one of the User fields for your own purposes.
The User fields are located at the bottom of the screen, so you have to scroll 
down to see them. Basically, you can use these fields any way you want 
(which is great), and you can even change the field’s name. (Face it, User field 
isn’t that helpful as a descriptive title.) For example, you can rename User 
fields to capture titles that follow a name (such as MD, PhD, and so on). Or 
how about profession, birthdate, hobbies, school, or nickname? You decide 
what information is important to you.
	
Changing the field name for this particular contact changes it for all your contacts.
To rename a User field, follow these steps:
	
1.	Scroll to the bottom of the screen to navigate to one of the User fields.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Change Field Name.
	
	 The Change Field Name selection on the menu appears only if the cursor 
is in a User field.

58
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
	
3.	Use the keyboard to enter the new User field name.
	
4.	Press the trackball, trackpad, or enter key to save.
	
	 You’re all set.
Adding a picture for a contact
Like most phones, your BlackBerry Curve can display a picture of the caller. 
Here’s how to add a photo for a contact:
	
1.	Have access to a digital picture of the person.
	
	 See Chapter 13 for more about taking photos with your BlackBerry 
Curve.
	
2.	Get the photo to your BlackBerry Curve.
	
	 You can send it via e-mail, copy it to the microSD card, or copy it to the 
built-in memory of Curve. If you don’t know how to use the microSD, 
Chapter 16 is your gateway to media satisfaction.
	
	
3.	From the Home screen, select the Contacts icon.
	
	
4.	Highlight a contact.
	
5.	Press the menu key and then select Add Picture (see Figure 4-4).
	
Figure 4-4: 
Add a 
picture 
here.
	
	
6.	Use the trackball or trackpad to navigate to the drive and folder that 
contains the picture.
	
	 You can use multiple locations for storing media files, such as pictures. 
Chapter 15 gives you the scoop.
	
7.	Select the picture.
	
	 The picture you choose is displayed in full onscreen with a rectangle on it.
	
8.	Slide the trackball or trackpad to position the rectangle on the face.

59
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
	
	 Contacts uses a tiny image, just enough to show the face of a person. 
The rectangle you see here indicates how the application crops the 
image.
	
9.	Press the trackball or trackpad and then select Crop and Save.
	
	 You’re all set. Just save this contact to keep your changes.
	
10.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
Assigning a tone
Oh, no, your ringing Curve has woken you. Ring tones help you decide 
whether to ignore the call or get up. We hope, you can easily switch to Sleep 
mode if you decide to ignore the call.
	
If you have OS 4.6 (perhaps BlackBerry Handheld Software v4.6), follow these 
steps to assign a ring tone to one of your contacts:
	
1.	While editing a contact, press the trackball or trackpad and then 
select Add Custom Ring Tone from the menu (refer to Figure 4-4).
	
2.	Press the trackball or trackpad.
	
	 A screen similar to Figure 4-4 gives you an option to customize the 
ring tone settings. From this screen, you can select a ring tone; set the 
volume; and control whether to make the LED blink, the phone vibrate, 
and the settings work while you’re on a call.
	
3.	Select the ring tone you want.
	
4.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
	
If you have OS 5.0 (possibly BlackBerry Handheld Software v5.0), follow these 
steps to assign a ring tone to one of your contacts:
	
1.	While editing a contact, scroll to the Ring Tones/Alerts section.
	
	 Under the Ring Tones/Alerts section, you should see Phone and 
Messages. You can customize the ring tone when you receive a call and 
when you have a new message, such as an e-mail or an SMS.
	
2.	Select Phone and customize the ring tone on the screen that follows.
	
	 You see and can change the following options:
 
• Ring Tone: You select a ring tone from a list of tones here.
 
• Volume: Allows you to control the volume. The default is set to use 
the Active Profile settings. Other values are 1 to 10; 10 is the loudest.
 
• Play Sound: Lets you control in what state to play the tone. Values 
are Active Profile, In Holster, Out of Holster, and Always; the 
default is set to Active Profile.
 
• LED: Allows you to use LED to indicate a call.

60
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
 
• Vibration: Allows you to enable vibration as a way of notification. 
Choices are Active Profile, Off, On, and Custom. The default is 
Active Profile. Choosing Custom allows you to control how long 
you want the vibration to last.
 
• Vibrate with Ring Tone: Allows you to choose between vibrating 
and playing the tone. Choices are Active Profile, On, and Off. The 
default value is Active Profile.
	
3.	Press the escape key.
	
	 You’re back to the Edit Contact screen.
	
4.	Select Messages.
	
	 You are presented with the Messages screen, allowing you to customize 
the ring tone when you receive a message. You can do all the customiza­
tions listed in Step 2 plus the following:
 
• Notify Me During Calls: Allows you to toggle notification while you 
are actively on a call. Your choices are Yes or No, and the default 
is No.
	
5.	Press the escape key.
	
6.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
	
Spend a little bit of time adding your own contact record(s). We recommend 
adding at least one record for your business contact info and one for your 
personal contact info. This saves you from having to type your own contact 
information every time you want to give it to someone. You can share your 
contact record by sending it as an attachment to an e-mail. (See the later sec­
tion “Sharing a Contact.”)
Adding contacts from other 
BlackBerry applications
When you get an e-mail message or a call, that person’s contact information 
is in Messages or Phone. It’s just logical to add the information. You may 
have noticed that Phone lists only outgoing numbers. That’s half of what you 
need. You can access incoming phone calls in Messages:
	
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Messages.
	
	
2.	In Messages, press the menu key and then select View Folder.
	
3.	Select Phone Call Logs.

61
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
	
A phone log entry stays only as long as you have free space on your 
BlackBerry Curve. When BlackBerry runs out of space (which could take 
years, depending on how you use it), it deletes read e-mails and phone logs, 
starting from the oldest.
	
You can view your device memory information by going to Options from the 
Home screen and selecting Memory. The next screen shows you two types of 
memory: application memory and media card. Pay close attention to applica­
tion memory. This is where your applications are installed, including data 
from out-of-the-box applications such as Contacts, Messages, and Calendar. 
Your Curve has 128MB total application memory, and you should see how 
much is free from this screen.
Creating a contact from an existing e-mail address or phone number in 
Messages is easy:
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Messages.
	
2.	In Messages, select the e-mail address or the phone number.
	
3.	Select Add to Contacts.
	
	 A New Contact screen appears, filled with that particular piece of information.
	
4.	Enter the rest of the information you know.
	
5.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
	
The best solution for capturing contact information from e-mail is an applica­
tion called gwabbit. The app has the intelligence of detecting contact infor­
mation and gives you a quick and easy way to add it to Contacts. You can 
purchase gwabbit for $9.99 a year and download the app from their Web site 
at www.gwabbit.com.
Viewing a contact
Okay, you just entered your friend Jane’s name into your BlackBerry, but you 
have this nagging thought that you typed the wrong phone number. You want 
to quickly view Jane’s information. Here’s how you do it:
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
	
2.	In Contacts, scroll to and highlight the contact name you want and 
then press the trackball or trackpad.
	
	 Pressing the trackball, trackpad, or enter key while a name is highlighted 
is the same as opening the menu and choosing View — just faster.
	
	 View mode displays only information that’s been filled in, as shown in 
Figure 4-5. It doesn’t bother showing blank fields.

Editing a contact
Change is an inevitable part of life. Given that fact, your contact information 
is sure to change as well. To keep current the information you diligently put 
in Contacts, you have to do some updating now and then. To update a con­
tact, follow these steps:
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
	
2.	In Contacts, scroll to and highlight a contact name, press the menu 
key, and then select Edit.
	
	 The Edit Contact screen for that contact makes an appearance.
	
	 In Contacts (or any BlackBerry application, for that matter), displaying 
a menu involves a simple press of the menu key. You see the Edit option 
on the menu right below View.
	
3.	Scroll through the various fields of the Edit Contact screen, editing the 
contact information as you see fit.
	
	 If you want to edit only a few words or letters in a field (instead of 
replacing all the text), slide the trackball or trackpad while pressing 
and holding the Alt key (located to the left of the Z key) to position 
your cursor precisely on the text you want to change. Then make your 
desired changes.
	
4.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
	
	 The edit you made for this contact is saved.
	
When you’re editing information, and you want to replace the entry with a 
new one, it’s much faster to first clear the contents, especially if you have a 
lot of old data. When you are in an editable field (as opposed to a selectable 
field), just press the menu key and then select Clear Field. This feature is avail­
able in all text-entry fields and for most BlackBerry applications.

63
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
Deleting a contact
It’s time to get rid of somebody’s contact information in your Contacts. 
Maybe it’s a case of duplication or a bit of bad blood. Either way, BlackBerry 
Curve makes it easy to delete a contact.
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
	
2.	In Contacts, scroll to and highlight a contact name you want to delete, 
press the menu key, and then select Delete.
	
	 A confirmation screen appears, as shown in Figure 4-6.
	
Figure 4-6: 
The con-
firmation 
screen 
when you’re 
about to 
delete a 
contact.
	
	
3.	Select Delete.
	
	 The contact you selected is deleted and disappears from your Contacts 
list.
	
Dealing with the confirmation screen can be a pain if you want to delete sev­
eral contacts in a row. If you are 100 percent sure that you want to ditch a 
number of contacts, you can suspend the Confirmation feature by setting the 
Confirm Delete option to No on the Contacts Options screen. See the “Setting 
preferences” section, later in this chapter, for more on Contacts Options.
Copying Contacts from 
Desktop Applications
Most people use desktop applications to maintain their contacts — you 
know, Microsoft Outlook, IBM Lotus Notes, or Novell GroupWise. And a word 
to the wise: You don’t want to maintain two address books. That’s a recipe 
for disaster. Luckily for you, RIM (Research In Motion) makes it easy to get 
your various contacts — BlackBerry, desktop, laptop, whatever — in sync.

64
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
Your BlackBerry Curve comes with a collection of programs called 
BlackBerry Desktop Manager, one of which is Synchronize. You can use 
Synchronize to
	
✓	Sync between your device and the PC software for managing contacts 
such as Outlook.
	
✓	Set up and configure the behavior of the program, including how the 
fields in the desktop version of Contacts map to the Contacts fields in 
your BlackBerry.
Chapter 16 shows how to use Synchronize.
Looking for Someone?
Somehow — usually through a combination of typing skills and the shuttling 
of data between various electronic devices — you’ve created a nice, long list 
of contacts in Contacts. Nice enough, we suppose, but useless unless you can 
find the phone number of Rufus T. Firefly at the drop of a hat.
That’s where the Find screen comes in. In fact, the first thing you see in 
Contacts when you open it is the Find screen, as shown in Figure 4-7.
	
Figure 4-7: 
Your search 
starts here.
	
You can conveniently search through your contacts by following these steps:
	
1.	In the Find field, enter the starting letters of the name you want to 
search for.

65
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
	
	 Your search criterion is the name of the person. You could enter the last 
name or first name or both, although the list is usually sorted by first 
name and then last name. As you type the letters, the list shrinks based 
on the matches. Figure 4-8 illustrates how this works.
	
Figure 4-8: 
Enter more 
letters to 
shorten the 
potential 
contacts list 
search.
	
	
2.	Using the trackball or trackpad, scroll to and highlight the name from 
the list of matches.
	
	 If you have a long list in Contacts, and you want to scroll down a page 
at a time, just hold down the Alt key (it’s located to the left of the Z key) 
and scroll. You get where you need to go a lot faster.
	
3.	Press the menu key and select from the possible actions listed on the 
menu that appears.
	
	 After you find the person you want, you can select among these options, 
as shown in Figure 4-9:
 
• Activity Log: Opens a screen listing e-mails, calls, and SMS mes­
sages you’ve made to the contact.
 
• View Work Map: Appears only if you have filled in the work 
address information. This allows you to map the location using 
Maps.
 
• Email: Starts a new e-mail message. See Chapter 8 for more infor­
mation about e-mail.
 
• PIN: Starts a new PIN-to-PIN message, which is a messaging feature 
unique to BlackBerry. With PIN-to-PIN, you can send a quick mes­
sage to someone with a BlackBerry. See Chapter 9 for more details 
about PIN-to-PIN messaging.

66
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
 
• Call: Uses Phone to dial the number.
 
• SMS: Starts a new SMS message. SMS stands for Short Messaging 
Service, which is used in cellphones. See Chapter 9 for more 
details about SMS.
 
• SIM Phone Book: This menu option enables you to view contacts 
saved on the SIM card. For more information on how to use this 
option, see the “Transferring Contacts” section, later in this 
chapter.
 
• MMS: Starts a new MMS message. MMS is short for Multimedia 
Messaging Service, an evolution from SMS that supports voice and 
video clips. See Chapter 9 for more details about MMS.
	
	The MMS item appears in the menu only if you have filled in the 
contact’s Mobile field.
 
• Send as Attachment: Starts a new e-mail message with the contact 
as an attachment. See Chapter 8 for more information.
 
• Invite to Messenger Contact: This menu option, which is near the 
top of the menu list (so you don’t see it in Figure 4-9), allows you 
to add this contact to your contacts list in BlackBerry Messenger. 
(Note that this option appears only if you have BlackBerry 
Messenger installed.)
You can attach a contact, a security certificate or a file. Those three choices 
are in the menu displayed after pressing the menu key.
The Add Custom Ring Tone you see in Figure 4-9 was described previously, in 
the “Assigning a tone” section.
If you have a finger-fumble and press a letter key in error, press the escape 
key once to return to the original list (the one showing all your contacts), or 
press the trackball or trackpad once and then select View All.
	
Figure 4-9:

the selected

67
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
	
You aren’t hallucinating: Sometimes Email <contact name> or Call 
<contact name> appears on the menu, and sometimes it doesn’t. Contacts 
knows when to show those menu options. If a contact has a phone number, 
Call <contact name> and SMS <contact name> show up, and the same 
is true for e-mail and the personal identification number (PIN). In fact, this list 
of actions is a convenient way to find out whether you have particular infor­
mation — a phone number or an e-mail address — for a particular contact.
	
In a corporate environment, your BlackBerry Enterprise server administra­
tor may disable PIN-to-PIN messaging because it doesn’t go to the corporate 
e-mail servers and, therefore, can’t be monitored. If this is the case, the menu 
option PIN<contact name> won’t appear, even though you entered PIN 
information for your contacts. Note that you’ll still be able to receive a PIN-to-
PIN message, but you won’t be able to send one.
Organizing Your Contacts
You’ve been diligent by adding your contacts to Contacts, and your list has 
been growing at a pretty good clip. It now has all the contact information 
for your business colleagues, clients, and (of course) family and friends. In 
fact, Contacts has grown so much that it holds hundreds of contacts, and it’s 
taking more time to find someone.
Imagine that you just saw an old acquaintance, and you want to greet the 
person by name. You know that if you saw the name, you’d recognize it. The 
trouble is that your list has 300-plus names, which would take you a long 
time to scroll through — so long, in fact, that this acquaintance would surely 
come right up to you in the meantime, forcing you to hide the fact that you 
can’t remember his name. (How embarrassing.) In this scenario, the tried-
and-true Find feature wouldn’t be much help. What you need is a smaller pool 
of names to search.
	
This isn’t rocket science. You’ll want to do one of the following:
	
✓	Organize your contacts into groups. Using groups (as every kinder­
garten teacher could tell you) is a way to arrange something (in your 
case, contacts) to make them more manageable. How you arrange your 
groups is up to you. You should base the principle on whatever makes 
sense to you and fits the group you set up. For example, you can place 
all your customer contacts in a Clients group and family members in a 
Family group.
	
✓	Set up your contacts so that you can filter them. Use the Filter feature in 
combination with BlackBerry’s Categories. (Using Categories, you can label 
your contacts to make it easy to filter them.) The Filter feature can narrow 
the Contacts list to such an extent that you only have to scroll down and 
find your contact — no need to type search keywords, in other words.

68
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
Whether you use the Group or Filter feature is up to you. You find out how to 
use both methods in the next sections of this chapter.
Creating a group
A BlackBerry group in Contacts — as opposed to any other kind of group 
you can imagine — is just a simple filter or category. In other words, using a 
group just arranges your contacts into subsets without affecting the contact 
entries themselves. In Contacts, a group shows up in the contacts list just like 
any other contact. The only wrinkle here is that when you select the group, 
the contacts associated with that group — and only the contacts associated 
with that group — appear onscreen.
Need some help visualizing how this works? Go ahead and create a group, fol­
lowing these steps:
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
	
2.	In Contacts, press the menu key and then select New Group.
	
	 A screen similar to that shown in Figure 4-10 appears. The top portion of 
the screen is where you type the group name, and the bottom portion is 
where you add your list of group members.
	
Figure 4-10: 
An empty 
screen 
ready for 
creating a 
group.
	
	
3.	Type the name of the group in the New Group field.
	
	 You can name it anything. For this example, let’s name it Poker Buddies.
	
4.	Press the trackball or trackpad and then select Add Member.
	
	 The main Contacts list shows up in all its glory, ready to be pilfered.

69
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
	
5.	Select the contact you want to add to your new group list, press the 
trackball or trackpad, and then select Continue from the menu that 
appears.
	
	 Everybody knows a Rob Kao, so select him. Doing so places Rob Kao in 
your Poker Buddies group list, as shown in Figure 4-11.
	
	 You can’t add a contact to a group if that contact doesn’t have at least 
an e-mail address or a phone number. (BlackBerry Curve is very strict 
on this point.) If you need to skirt this roadblock, edit that contact’s 
information and put in a fake (and clearly inactive) e-mail address, such 
as notareal@emailaddress.no.
	
Figure 4-11: 
Your new 
group 
has one 
member.
	
	
6.	Repeat Steps 4 and 5 to add more contacts to your list.
	
	 After you’re satisfied, save your group in the next step.
	
7.	Press the trackball or trackpad and then select Save Group from the 
menu that appears.
	
	 Your Poker Buddies group is duly saved, and you can now see Poker 
Buddies in your main Contacts list.
Using the Filter feature on your contacts
Are you a left-brainer or a right-brainer? Yankees fan or Red Sox fan? Innie 
or Outie? Dividing up the world into categories is something everyone does 
(no divisions there), so it should come as no surprise that BlackBerry divides 
your contacts into distinct categories as well.

70
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
By default, two categories are set for you on the BlackBerry Curve:
	
✓	Business
	
✓	Personal
Why stop at two? BlackBerry makes it easy to create more categories. In this 
section, you first find out how to categorize a contact and then you see how 
to filter your Contacts list. Finally, you find out how to create categories.
Categorizing your contacts
Whether you’re creating a contact or editing one, you can categorize a par­
ticular contact as long as you’re in Edit mode.
If the trick is getting into Edit mode, it’s a pretty simple trick. Here’s how it’s done:
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
	
2.	In Contacts, highlight the contact, press the menu key, and then select Edit.
	
	 Contacts is now in Edit mode for this particular contact, which is exactly 
where you want to be.
	
3.	Press the menu key and then select Categories.
	
	 A Categories list appears, as shown in Figure 4-12. By default, you see 
only the Business and the Personal categories.
	
Figure 4-12: 
Default 
categories.
	
	
4.	Press the trackball, trackpad, or Space key to select the check box 
next to Personal.

71
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
	
5.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
	
	 You are brought back to the Edit screen for this particular contact.
	
6.	Press the trackball or trackpad and then select Save (again) from the 
menu that appears.
Filtering your contacts
You now have one — count ’em, one — contact with Personal as its category, 
which means you can filter your Contacts list by using a category. Here’s 
how:
	
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
	
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Filter.
	
	 Your Categories list appears.
	
	 If you haven’t added any categories in the meantime, you see only the 
default Business and Personal categories.
	
3.	Select the Personal check box.
	
	 Your Contacts list shrinks to just the contacts assigned to the Personal 
category, as shown in Figure 4-13.
	
Figure 4-13: 
The 
Contacts list 
after a filter 
is applied.
	
	
As you add contacts to a category, you can use Find. Enter the first few letters of 
the name to further narrow the contact search. If you need a refresher on how 
Find works, see the “Looking for Someone?” section, earlier in this chapter.

72
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
Adding a category
Whoever thought the default categories (Business and Personal) were 
enough for the complexities of the real world probably didn’t know many 
people. BlackBerry makes it easy to add categories, so you can divide your 
world as much as you like:
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
	
2.	In Contacts, press the menu key and then select Filter.
	
	 You get a view of the default categories (refer to Figure 4-12).
	
3.	Press the menu key (again) and then select New.
	
	 A pop-up screen asks you to name the new category.
	
4.	Type the name of the category in the Name field and then press Enter.
	
	 The category is automatically saved. The Filter screen lists all the cat­
egories, including the one you just created. Just press the escape key to 
get back to the Contacts main screen.
Setting preferences
Vanilla, anyone? Some days you’ll wish that your Contacts list were sorted 
differently. For example, there’s the day when you need to find the guy who 
works for ABC Company but has a foreign name that you can hardly pro­
nounce, let alone spell. What’s a body to do?
You’re in luck. Contacts Options navigates some out-of-the-ordinary situa­
tions. Figure 4-14 shows the Contacts Options screen. Despite its simplicity, it 
provides you with four important options that change Contacts behavior:
	
✓	Sort By: Changes how the list is sorted. You can use First Name, Last 
Name, or Company. Use the Space key to toggle among the choices. 
Remember that guy from ABC Company? You can use the Sort By option 
to sort by company. By doing that, all contacts from ABC Company are 
listed next to one another, and with any luck, the guy’s name will jump 
out at you.
	
✓	Separators: Changes the dividers in the Contacts list. It’s purely an 
­aesthetic change, but check it out — you may like the stripes.
	
✓	Allow Duplicate Names: Self-explanatory. If you turn this on, you can 
have multiple people who happen to share the same name in your 
Contacts. If you disable this option, you get a warning when you try to 
add a name that matches one already on your list. Maybe you’re just 
tired and are mistakenly trying to add the same person twice to your 

73
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
list. Then again, sometimes people just have the same name. We recom­
mend keeping the default value of Yes, allowing you to have contacts 
with the same names.
	
✓	Confirm Delete: Displays a confirmation screen for all contact deletions.
	
	Always keep this feature turned on for normal usage. Because there are 
many ways you could delete someone from your Contacts, this feature is 
a good way of minimizing accidents.
How do you change any of these options? The fields behave like any other on 
a BlackBerry application. Simply highlight the field and then press the track­
ball or trackpad to bring up a menu from which you can select the possible 
Options values. For example, Figure 4-15 shows the possible Sort By fields.

Part II: Organizing with Curve 
Sharing a Contact
Suppose you want to share your contact information with a friend who also 
has a BlackBerry. A vCard — virtual (business) card — is your answer and 
can make your life a lot easier. In BlackBerry land, a vCard is a contact in 
Contacts that you send to someone as an attachment to an e-mail.
At the receiving end, the BlackBerry Curve (being the smart device that it is) 
recognizes the attachment and informs the BlackBerry owner that he or she 
has the option of saving it, making it available for his or her viewing pleasure 
in Contacts.
Sending a vCard
Because a vCard is nothing more than a Contacts contact attached to an 
e-mail, sending a vCard is a piece of cake. (Of course, you do need to make 
sure that your recipient has a BlackBerry device to receive the information.)
Here’s how you go about sending a vCard:
	
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Home screen, select the Messages application.
	
	
2.	In Messages, press the menu key and then select Compose Email.
	
	 A screen where you can compose a new e-mail appears.
	
3.	In the To field, start typing the name of the person to whom you want 
to send this vCard.
	
4.	When you see the name in the drop-down list, highlight it and then 
press the trackball or trackpad.
	
	 You see an e-mail screen with the name you just selected as the To 
recipient.
	
5.	Type the subject and message.
	
6.	Press the menu key and then select Attach Contact.
	
	 Contacts opens.
	
7.	Highlight the name of the person whose contact information you want 
to have attached and then press the trackball or trackpad.
	
	 The e-mail composition screen reappears, and an icon that looks like a 
book indicates that the e-mail now contains your attachment. Now all 
you have to do is send your e-mail.

75
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
	
8.	Press the trackball or trackpad and then select Send from the menu 
that appears.
	
	 You just shared the specified contact information. (Don’t you feel right 
neighborly now?)
Receiving a vCard
If you get an e-mail with a contact attachment, here’s how you save it to your 
Contacts:
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Messages.
	
2.	Select the e-mail that contains the vCard.
	
	 The e-mail with the vCard attachment opens.
	
3.	Scroll down to the attachment. When the cursor is hovering over 
the attachment, press the trackball or trackpad and then select View 
Attachment from the menu that appears.
	
	 The vCard makes an appearance onscreen. Now save the contact in 
Contacts.
	
4.	Press the menu key and then select Add to Contacts.
	
	 The vCard is saved and is available in Contacts.
Transferring Contacts
Are you switching to BlackBerry Curve from an old AT&T or Cingular cell­
phone? You’ve probably accumulated contacts on that phone by painstak­
ingly typing them. Good news! Maybe you don’t have to type them into 
BlackBerry Curve!
The trick is to use the old phone’s SIM card (see Figure 4-16) as an external 
storage device, such as a flash drive. The SIM card is an electronic chip that 
can store information, including your phone numbers and contacts.

76
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
	
Figure 4-16: 
Transfer 
contacts 
with a SIM 
card.
	
	
This should work on almost any GSM-compatible phone. The big U.S. GSM 
­carriers are AT&T (including old Cingular phones) and T-Mobile; in Canada, 
Rogers. To find whether you have a GSM phone, look for the SIM card. Take 
the battery out of your cellphone; behind the battery, you should see a SIM 
card. If you don’t see a SIM card, you don’t have a GSM phone.
Copying contacts from a GSM phone
The process for copying contacts on a BlackBerry Curve is pretty straightfor­
ward, but the steps for retrieving them depend on your old phone.
For the purpose of showing you what’s what, we use a Nokia 6300 phone as 
an example. You will probably need the manual for your old phone because 
it’s likely that the exact steps aren’t the same.
To copy contacts from an old GSM cellphone to a BlackBerry Curve, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Take out the SIM card out of your BlackBerry Curve, and put it in the 
old cellphone.
	
	 Moving a SIM card is no big deal. The SIM card is usually behind the bat­
tery, so you have to remove the back cover of the device to get to it:
 
• On the Curve, there’s a lock at the bottom of the back of the 
device. Just press this with your thumb to unlock the cover. You 
can pull the cover out starting from where the lock is located. You 
should be able to gently pry the BlackBerry Curve battery out with 
your fingernail.
 
• Follow the instructions from the old cellphone’s manual to open it 
and remove the old SIM card, and then insert the BlackBerry Curve 
SIM card into the old cellphone. Put the battery back in the old 
cellphone, and switch it on.
	
2.	Use the old cellphone’s menu to copy the old contacts list to the 
SIM card.

77
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
	
	The contacts list may be called something like Contacts or Names. You’ll prob­
ably need the old cellphone’s manual to work through the process. The side­
bar “Copying the contacts list” shows how it works on a Nokia 6300.
	
	 If your old cellphone phone doesn’t recognize your BlackBerry SIM card, 
perhaps the phone is locked. Phone providers can “lock” phones to their 
network, making the phones unusable in other networks. If this is the 
case, call your phone provider, and ask for instructions to unlock your 
phone.
	
3.	Put the SIM card back into your BlackBerry.
	
	 Reinserting the SIM card and battery resets your BlackBerry.
	
	Don’t forget to put the old SIM card back into the old phone!
	
4.	On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
	
5.	In Contacts, press the menu key and then select SIM Phone Book.
	
	 It might take some time to load the contacts from your SIM card; how 
long depends on how many contacts you’ve saved to the card. (You’ll 
see a progress bar on the screen.) After the contacts are loaded, they 
are listed on the screen, and you can start browsing or copying them to 
your Contacts list.
	
	 The SIM Phone Book menu item is located toward the bottom of the 
menu, as shown in Figure 4-17. You need to scroll down to see it.

	 To do so, highlight the contact, press the menu key and select Add to 
Contacts. Repeat this step for each contact you want to copy. (It’s still a 
lot better than actually typing each contact on your BlackBerry.)

Part II: Organizing with Curve 
Copying the contacts list
The steps for copying the contacts list depend 
on your old phone. You probably need the own­
er’s manual for your own phone, but here’s how 
it works on a Nokia 6300:
	 1.	 Select Names by pressing the top of the 
rightmost top button.
	
	 On this phone, Names is the equivalent 
of Contacts. The phone displays a list of 
contacts.
	 2.	 Select Options by pressing the leftmost top 
button.
	
	 The Names menu appears, as shown in the 
figure.
	 3.	 On the Names menu, select Mark All.
	 4.	 Select Options by pressing the leftmost top 
button.
	
	 The Names menu appears.
	 5.	 Select Copy Marked.
	
	 A menu displays two options: From Phone 
to SIM Card and From SIM Card to Phone.
	 6.	 Select From Phone to SIM Card.
	 7.	 Select All and then select Keep Original 
from the next menu.
	
	 A confirmation screen appears.
	 8.	 Select OK to confirm the copy.
              
	
	 The Nokia 6300 phone starts copying the 
contents of the Phone Book to the SIM 
card. While it’s making the copy, the screen 
displays a bar that moves back and forth. If 
you have many contacts on your phone, this 
process can take some time, so be patient. 
When the contacts are loaded onto the 
SIM card, the screen displays the number 
of contacts that were copied.
	
	 When the contacts are copied, you can 
switch the SIM card back to the BlackBerry 
Curve.
	
SIM cards have a limited capacity. If one or two old contacts don’t fit on your 
SIM card, just type them into your BlackBerry Curve. But if you need to move 
many more contacts, you can clear and refill the SIM card as many times as 
needed to move all your old contacts:

79
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
	
1.	On your Curve, launch Contacts.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select SIM Phone Book.
	
	 On this screen, you should see the already-copied contacts in your SIM 
card. Deleting the contact here deletes it only from the SIM card, not 
from the Contacts application. There’s no facility to delete all at once — 
only one at a time.
	
3.	Press the Del key to delete a contact and then select Delete on the 
confirmation screen.
	
	 This is the best time to disable the confirmation screen and speed up 
the deletion. If you need a refresher on how to do it, check the “Setting 
Preferences” section, earlier in this chapter.
	
4.	Swap the BlackBerry SIM card back into the old cellphone.
	
5.	Use the old cellphone’s menu to copy individual contacts that didn’t 
fit when you copied “all” contacts.
	
	 Put the BlackBerry SIM card back in the BlackBerry Curve, and follow 
Steps 4–6 of the preceding instructions to copy the extra contacts from 
the SIM card to BlackBerry Contacts.
Copying a BlackBerry Curve contact
Someday, you may want to copy your carefully constructed BlackBerry 
Contacts list to another cellphone. It’s possible, with a little help from two 
BlackBerry experts.
	
This is one of the most difficult tricks unless someone shows you how.
So here’s how to copy each contact you want to move:
	
1.	View the contact information.
	
	 Follow the steps in the “Viewing a contact” section, earlier in this 
chapter.
	
2.	On the view screen, scroll to a Phone Number field, press the menu 
key, and then select Copy to SIM Phone Book.
	
	 The Copy to SIM Phone Book feature (see Figure 4-18) shows up only 
when you position the cursor in a Phone Number field.
	
3.	On the Phone Book entry screen, press the trackball or trackpad, and 
then select Save.
	
	 The screen immediately returns to the View contact screen. You can 
repeat these steps to copy more contacts from the BlackBerry Curve.

80
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
	
Figure 4-18: 
Copy 
BlackBerry 
info to a 
cellphone.
	
When all the contacts you want are on the BlackBerry SIM card, insert the 
SIM card into the other phone, and follow its instructions to copy contacts 
from the SIM card.
	
If your other phone doesn’t recognize your BlackBerry SIM card, perhaps the 
phone is locked. Phone providers lock the phones to their network, making 
the phones unusable in other networks, all the time. If this is the case, call 
your phone provider, and ask for instructions on how to unlock your phone.
Searching for Someone Outside 
Your Contacts
Does your employer provide your BlackBerry Curve? Do you use Outlook 
or Lotus Notes on your desktop machine at work? If you answer yes to both 
questions, this is for you.
BlackBerry Contacts allows you to search for people in your organization, basi­
cally using any of the following software, which contains employee databases:
	
✓	Microsoft Exchange (for Outlook)
	
✓	IBM Domino (for Lotus Notes)
	
✓	Novell GroupWise
	
Exchange, Domino, and GroupWise serve the same purposes:
	
✓	Facilitate e-mail delivery in a corporate environment
	
✓	Enable access to a database of names:
 
• Global Address Lists (GALs) in Exchange
 
• Notes Address Books in Domino
 
• GroupWise Address Books in GroupWise

81
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
To search for someone in your organization through a database of names, 
simply follow these steps:
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Lookup.
	
	 Some corporations may not enable the Lookup feature. Please check 
with your IT department for more information.
	
3.	Type the name you’re searching for and then press the trackball or 
trackpad.
	
	 You could enter the beginning characters of a person’s last or first 
name. You are searching your company’s database, not Contacts, so this 
step may take some time.
	
	 For big organizations, we recommend being more precise when search­
ing. For example, searching for Dan yields more hits than searching for 
Daniel. The more precise your search criteria, the fewer hits you’ll get 
and the faster the search will be.
	
	 While the search is in progress, you see the word Lookup and the cri­
teria you put in. For example, if you enter Daniel, the top row reads 
Lookup: Daniel. After the search is finished, BlackBerry displays the 
number of hits, or matches — for example, 20 matches: Daniel.
	
4.	Select the number of matches.
	
	 The matches appear. A header at the top of this screen details the 
matches displayed in the current screen as well as the total hits. For 
example, if the header reads something like Lookup Daniel (20 of 
130 matches), 130 people in your organization have the name Daniel, 
and BlackBerry is displaying the first 20. You have the option of fetching 
more by pressing the trackball or trackpad and then choosing Get More 
Results from the menu that appears.
	
	 You can add the listed name(s) to your Contacts by using the Add com­
mand (for the currently highlighted name) or the Add All command for 
all the names in the list. (As always, press the trackball or trackpad to 
call up the menu that contains these options.)
	
5.	Select the person whose information you want to review.
	
	The person’s contact information is displayed on a read-only screen 
(you can read but not change it). You may see the person’s title; e-mail 
address; work, mobile, and fax numbers; and snail-mail address at work. 
Any of that information gives you confirmation about the person you’re 
looking for. Of course, what shows up depends on the availability of this 
information in your company’s database.

82
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
Synchronizing Facebook Contacts
Do you network like a social butterfly? You must be using one of the popular 
social networking BlackBerry applications, such as MySpace or Facebook. 
You must have tons of friends from these networking sites and want to copy 
their contact information to your Curve. There are ways to achieve this, and 
individual networking sites will have their own unique way. But if you’re in 
Facebook, you’re lucky.
With the latest Facebook application (version 1.6 as of this writing), it’s much 
easier to get Facebook contacts to your Curve. The Facebook app also allows 
you to synchronize information between your Curve and your friend’s infor­
mation in Facebook.
Adding a Facebook friend’s info to Contacts
Pulling down your friend’s information from Facebook is quite easy:
	
1.	Select the Facebook icon from the Home screen.
	
	 The Facebook application is filed under the Downloads folder.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then press F.
	
	 Your friends list shows up in the screen similar to the one on the left in 
Figure 4-19.
	
Figure 4-19: 
Select 
Facebook 
friends 
to add to 
Contacts 
here.
	
	
3.	In the Find field, start typing your friend’s name.
	
	 This narrows the list, as shown on the right in Figure 4-19.

83
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
	
4.	Highlight the friend you want to add to Contacts, press the menu key, 
and select Connect to BlackBerry Contact.
	
	 A dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-20, allowing you to choose 
whether to connect this Facebook friend to an existing contact or add 
the friend as a new contact to your Curve. In this case, you want to add.
	
	 If the same person exists in your Curve and in Facebook, you can simply 
link the contact here. Also, see the next section to get an automatic 
update on your BlackBerry whenever your friend changes his or her pro­
file in Facebook.
	
Figure 4-20: 
Connect a 
Facebook 
friend to 
an existing 
contact or 
add a new 
contact 
here.
	
	
	 The term connect in the Facebook application means telling the app 
which contact is associated with a Facebook friend. After the app 
records this linkage, it knows which contact to update when information 
in Facebook changes.
	
5.	Select New Contact.
	
	 A progress screen appears momentarily, telling you that it’s getting the 
contact information from Facebook. When it’s finished, a new contact is 
added to your Curve with the contact info shown on the screen.
	
6.	Press the escape key.
	
	 The Facebook app displays a prompt, asking you whether to ask for a 
phone number. This is a default behavior even if the phone number is 
already in your BlackBerry.
	
7.	Select either Yes or No in the prompt to request for phone number.
	
	 You’re back to the previous Facebook screen, and an Address Book icon 
has been added to the right of your friend’s name, indicating that this 
friend is now connected, or linked, to a BlackBerry contact, as shown in 
Figure 4-21.

84
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
Automatic syncing between Facebook 
profiles and Contacts
When running the Facebook application for the first time, you’re asked to 
enable synchronization. Here are Facebook and BlackBerry connections you 
can choose among:
	
Figure 4-21: 
The Address 
Book icon 
shows 
that your 
Facebook 
friend is 
connected 
to a 
BlackBerry 
contact.
	
	
✓	BlackBerry Message application: When enabled, you’ll see new 
Facebook notifications in your Messages application.
	
✓	BlackBerry Calendar application: When enabled, a calendar item is 
automatically created in your Curve whenever you have a new Facebook 
event.
	
✓	BlackBerry Contacts application: When enabled, your Curve contacts 
are periodically updated with the latest Facebook information, including 
the profile pictures. For this to happen, your Curve contacts also will be 
sent to Facebook.
If you opted out of these options the first time you ran Facebook, you can still 
enable them from the Facebook Options screen. The following steps enable 
Contacts synchronization:
	
1.	Select the Facebook icon from the Home screen.
	
	 The Facebook application is filed under the Downloads folder.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Options.

85
 Chapter 4: Remembering and Locating Your Acquaintances
	
	 The Options screen appears. A lot of information and text are on this 
screen, and you have to scroll down to see all the options. Feel free to 
check other options, but for synchronizing contacts, refer to the first two 
pages of the screen, which should look like the one shown in Figure 4-22.
	
3.	Add a check mark to the BlackBerry Contacts application.
	
	 There’s explanatory text right below this check box. If you scroll down, 
you should see another check box, which allows you to synchronize 
Facebook profile photos with Contacts photos.
	
4.	Add a check mark to the option titled Update Existing Photos in 
Your BlackBerry Contacts List with Facebook Friend Profile Photos 
(Figure 4-22, right).
	
5.	Press the escape key, and select Yes on the Save Changes prompt.
	
	 Your Contacts will now be periodically updated with Facebook friends.

In This Chapter

▶	Making your Calendar your own
▶	Scheduling a meeting
▶	Viewing an appointment
▶	Sending and receiving meeting requests
T
o some folks, the key to being organized and productive is mastering 
time management and using their time wisely (and we aren’t just talk­
ing about reading this book while you’re commuting to work). Many have 
discovered that there is no better way to organize their time than to use a 
calendar — a daily planner tool. Some prefer digital to paper, so they use a 
planner software program on their PC, whether installed on their hard drive 
or accessed through an Internet portal (such as Yahoo!). The smartest of the 
bunch, of course, use their BlackBerry handheld because it has the whole 
planner thing covered in handy form with its Calendar application.
In this chapter, we show you how to keep your life (personal and work) 
in order by managing your appointments with your BlackBerry Calendar. 
What’s great about managing your time on a BlackBerry instead of on your 
PC is that your BlackBerry is always with you to remind you. Just remember 
that you won’t have any more excuses for forgetting that important quarterly 
meeting or Bertha’s birthday bash.
Accessing BlackBerry Calendar
	
	 BlackBerry Calendar is one of the BlackBerry core applications, like Contacts 
or Phone (read more about the others in Chapter 2), so it’s easy to get to. 
From the Home screen, press the menu key and then select Calendar. Voilà! 
You have Calendar.

88
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
Choosing Your Calendar View
The first time you open Calendar, you’ll likely see Day view, the default set­
ting, as shown in Figure 5-1. However, you can change the Calendar view to a 
different one that works better for your needs:
	
✓	Day view: Gives you a summary of your appointments for the day. By 
default, it lists all your appointments from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
	
✓	Week view: Shows you a seven-day summary of your appointments. In 
this view, you can see how busy you are in a particular week.
	
✓	Month view: Shows you every day of the month. You can’t tell how 
many appointments are in a day, but you can see on which days you 
have appointments.
	
✓	Agenda view: A bit different from the other views. It isn’t a time-based 
view like the others; it basically lists your upcoming appointments. In 
the list, you can see details of the appointments, such as where and 
when.
	
Figure 5-1: 
Day view in 
Calendar.
	
	
Different views (such as Week view, shown in Figure 5-2) offer you a different 
focus on your schedule. Select the view you want based on your scheduling 
needs and preferences. If your life is a little more complicated, you can switch 
between views for a full grasp of your schedule.

To switch between different Calendar views, simply follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Home screen, press the menu key and then select Calendar.
	
	 Doing so calls up the Calendar application in its default view — Day 
view.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select the view of your choice from the 
menu that appears (shown in Figure 5-3).
	
	 As we mention earlier, depending on your current calendar view, you 
can switch among Day, Week, Month, and Agenda views.

Part II: Organizing with Curve 
Moving between Time Frames
Depending on what view of Calendar you’re in, you can easily move to the 
preceding or next day, week, month, or year. For example, if you’re in Month 
view, you can move forward to the next month. Likewise, you can also move 
back to the preceding month. In fact, if you like to look at things in the long 
term, you can jump ahead (or back) a year at a time. (See Figure 5-4.)
	
Figure 5-4:

All Things Appointments: Adding,

After you master navigating the different Calendar views (and that should 
take you all of about two minutes) and you have Calendar customized to your 
heart’s content (another three minutes, tops), it’s time (pun intended) to set 
up, review, and delete appointments. We also show you how to set up a meet­
ing with clients or colleagues.
Creating an appointment
Setting up a new appointment is easy. You need only one piece of informa­
tion: when your appointment occurs. Of course, you can easily add related 
information about the appointment, such as the meeting’s purpose, its loca­
tion, and whatever additional notes are helpful.

93
 Chapter 5: Never Miss Another Appointment
	
In addition to setting a standard one-time, limited-duration meeting, you can 
set all-day appointments, recurring meetings, and reminders. Sweet!
Creating a one-time appointment
To add a new one-time appointment, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open Calendar.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select New.
	
	 The New Appointment screen appears.
	
3.	Fill in the key appointment information.
	
	 Type all the information regarding your appointment in the appropri­
ate spaces. You should at least enter the time and the subject of your 
appointment. See Figure 5-6.
Managing multiple calendars
Like your e-mail accounts, you may have mul­
tiple calendars. For example, say you have a 
calendar from your day job and a calendar from 
your personal life or softball club. Whatever the 
reason, your BlackBerry Curve has a great way 
for you to manage multiple calendars.
From Calendar Options, you see a screen simi­
lar to the following figure. The colored squares 
represent different calendars to give you a 
better view of which event belongs to which 
calendar. For example, you can assign red to 
your day job calendar and green to your softball 
club calendar. When two events conflict (share 
the same time slot), you can better prioritize 
with the color.
To change the color of each calendar, follow 
these steps:
	 1.	 Open Calendar.
	 2.	 Press the menu key and select Options 
Menu.
	
	 This opens a screen similar to the following 
figure.
	 3.	 Select a calendar of your choice.
	
	 The calendar properties screen opens.
	 4.	 Highlight the colored square and then 
select the desired color. (You can choose 
among six colors.)
	
	 If you have more than one e-mail address 
“hooked” into your BlackBerry, you will see 
them here.
	 5.	 Press the menu key and tap the Save 
button.

94
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
	
4.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
	
	 This saves your newly created appointment.
	
Figure 5-6: 
Set an 
appointment 
here.
	
Your new appointment is now in Calendar and viewable from any Calendar 
view.
	
You can have more than one appointment in the same time slot. Your 
BlackBerry Calendar allows conflicts in your schedule because it lets you 
make the hard decision about which appointment to forgo.
Creating an all-day appointment
If your appointment is an all-day event — for example, if you’re in corpo­
rate training or have an all-day doctor’s appointment — select the All Day 
Event check box on the New Appointment screen, as shown in Figure 5-7. 
You can do so by scrolling to the check box and pressing the trackball or 
trackpad. When this check box is selected, you can’t specify the time of your 
appointment — just the start date and end date (simply because it doesn’t 
make sense to specify a time for an all-day event).

95
 Chapter 5: Never Miss Another Appointment
	
Figure 5-7: 
Set an 
all-day 
event here.
	
Setting your appointment reminder time
Any appointment you enter in Calendar can be associated with a reminder 
alert — either a vibration or a beep, depending on how you set things up in 
your profile. (For more on profiles, see Chapter 3.) You can also choose to 
have no reminder for an appointment. From the New Appointment screen, 
simply scroll to the Reminder field and select a reminder time anywhere from 
None to 1 Week before your appointment time.
	
The native Profile application is simply another useful BlackBerry application 
that allows you to customize how your BlackBerry alerts you when an event 
occurs. Examples of events are an e-mail, a phone call, or a reminder for an 
appointment.
By default, whatever reminder alert you set goes off 15 minutes before the 
event. However, you don’t have to stick with the default. You can choose 
your own default reminder time. Here’s how:
	
1.	Open Calendar.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Options.
	
	 Doing so calls up the Calendar Options screen.
	
3.	Select Default Reminder.
	
4.	Choose a default reminder time anywhere from None to 1 Week 
before your appointment.
So from now on, any new appointment has a default reminder time of what 
you just set up. Assuming that you have a reminder time other than None, 
the next time you have an appointment coming up, you see a dialog box like 
the one shown in Figure 5-8, reminding you of the appointment.

96
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
	
Figure 5-8: 
You get a 
reminder 
dialog box if 
you want.
	
Creating a recurring appointment
You can set up recurring appointments based on daily, weekly, monthly, or 
yearly recurrences. Everyone has some appointment that repeats, such as 
birthdays or anniversaries (or taking out the trash every Thursday at 
7:30 a.m. — ugh).
For all recurrence types, you can define an Every field. For example, say you 
have an appointment that recurs every nine days. Just set the Recurrence 
field to Daily and the Every field to 9, as shown in Figure 5-9.
	
Figure 5-9: 
An appoint-
ment 
recurring 
every nine 
days.
	
Depending on what you select in the Recurrence field, you have the option 
to fill in other fields. If you enter Weekly in the Recurrence field, for example, 
you have the option of filling in the Day of the Week field. (It basically allows 
you to select the day of the week on which your appointment recurs.)
If you enter Monthly or Yearly in the Recurrence field, the Relative Date 
check box is available. With this check box selected, you can ensure that 
your appointment recurs relative to today’s date. For example, if you choose 

97
 Chapter 5: Never Miss Another Appointment
the following, your appointment occurs every two months on the third 
Sunday until July 31, 2012:
Start: Sunday, June 21, 2009 at 12 p.m.
End: Sunday, June 21, 2009 at 1 p.m.
Recurrence: Monthly
Every: 2
Relative Date: Selected
End: Saturday, July 31, 2012
On the other hand, if all options in this example remain the same except that 
Relative Date isn’t selected, your appointment occurs every two months, on 
the 21st of the month, until July 31, 2012.
If all this “relative” talk has you dizzy, don’t worry: The majority of your 
appointments won’t be as complicated as this.
Opening an appointment
After you set an appointment, you can view it in a couple of ways:
	
✓	If you set up reminders for your appointment and the little Reminder 
dialog box appears onscreen at the designated time before your appoint­
ment, you can view your appointment by clicking the box’s Open button. 
In the same dialog box, you can Snooze the reminder (refer to Figure 5-8).
	
✓	In Calendar, go to the exact time of your appointment and view it there.
	
While looking at an appointment, you can make changes (a new appointment 
time and new appointment location) and then save them.
Appointments versus Meetings
Technically, any event in your Calendar counts as an appointment, whether 
it’s a reminder for your best friend’s birthday or a reminder of a doctor’s 
appointment for a checkup. However, when you invite people to an appoint­
ment or you get invited to one, regardless of whether it’s a face-to-face meet­
ing or a phone conference, that appointment becomes a meeting.

Sending a meeting request
Sending a meeting request to others is similar to creating a Calendar appoint­
ment. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Open Calendar.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select New.
	
3.	Fill in the key appointment information (subject, location, and time).
	
4.	Press the menu key and then select Invite Attendee.
	
	 You’re taken to Contacts to select your meeting attendee.
	
5.	Select your contact via Contacts:
	
• If your contact is in Contacts: Highlight the contact you want and 
then press the trackball or trackpad.
 
• If you don’t yet have contacts or if the one you want isn’t in 
Contacts: Select the Use Once option to enter the appropriate 
e-mail address and then press the enter key to finish and return to 
Calendar.
	
	 After returning from Contacts, you see the attendees in your Calendar 
meeting notice.
	
6.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
	
	 An e-mail is sent to your meeting attendees, inviting them to your meeting.
Responding to a meeting request
Whether for work or a casual social event, you’ve likely received a meeting 
request by e-mail, asking you to respond to the meeting by choosing one of 
three options: Accept, Tentative, or Decline. (If it’s from your boss for an all-
staff meeting, and you just can’t afford to decline again because it’s so close 
to Christmas bonus time, that’s an Accept.)
You can accept any meeting request from your managers or colleagues on 
your BlackBerry just as you would on your desktop PC. In the PC world, you 
respond to an e-mail request for a meeting by clicking the appropriate button 
in your e-mail client (Microsoft Outlook, for the vast majority of you). In the 
BlackBerry world, a meeting request also comes in the form of an e-mail; after 
reading the e-mail, just choose Accept, Tentative, or Decline in the Messages 
application. Your response is sent back in an e-mail. We go into more detail 
about the Messages application in Chapter 9.

99
 Chapter 5: Never Miss Another Appointment
After you respond to the meeting request, the meeting is added to your 
Calendar automatically. If you have a change of heart later, you can change 
your response (yes, you can later decline that useless meeting after all) in 
Calendar, and the declined event disappears from your Calendar.
Setting your meeting dial-in number
You may have colleagues and friends all over the country or even on another 
continent. Group phone meetings may require a
	
✓	Dial-in number
	
✓	Moderator code (if you are the moderator)
	
✓	Participation code
To set your phone conference dial-in details, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open Calendar.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Options menu item.
	
3.	Select Conference Call Options.
	
	A screen similar to Figure 5-10 appears.
	
4.	Enter the appropriate numbers.
	
5.	Press the menu key and select Save.
	
	 Your conference call number is saved.

▶	Making your life easier with Password Keeper
I
n this chapter, we introduce you to the Clock application, which not only 
tells you the time, but also allows you to set alarms and a timer. In addi­
tion, you can use the application as a stopwatch. And in keeping with one of 
the key themes of this book — making your life easier — the Clock app has 
a feature called Bedside mode that turns your Curve into a quiet bedside 
companion.
To add to the theme of making your life a little easier, we make sure that you 
get the scoop on keeping your passwords in a single location safely by using 
the Password Keeper application.
Accessing Clock
Clock can be found right on the Home screen, as you can see on the left side 
of Figure 6-1. Just look for the icon of an alarm clock. Once you find the Clock 
icon, simply select it, and you should see a screen similar to the one on the 
right side of Figure 6-1.

102
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
	
Figure 6-1: 
Launch 
Clock (left) 
and view 
your clock 
(right).
	
	
If you’ve changed themes, different icons might be displayed (refer to Chapter 
3 for more on themes). Just remember that the Clock application is always 
located on the Home screen.
Customizing Your Clock
If the default analog clock doesn’t fit your taste, you can change it. 
Customizing your clock is easy and doesn’t take much time.
You customize the clock in the Options screen. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Select Clock from the Home screen.
	
	 The Clock application opens.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Options.
	
	 The Clock Options screen appears, as shown on the left side of Figure 6-2, 
ready and willing to be customized.
	
Figure 6-2: 
Customize 
your clock 
here.
	

103
 Chapter 6: Setting Alarms and Keeping Your Passwords
	
3.	Move to each field and choose the option you want.
	
	 Each of these fields is described shortly.
	
4.	Press the escape key and then select Save from the prompt.
The Clock Options screen is divided into five sections, as follows:
	
✓	Clock section: This is where you choose the type of clock, time zone, 
and time.
	
•	Clock Face: Allows you to set the type of clock. The options are 
Analog (the default; refer to the right side of Figure 6-1), Digital, 
Flip Clock, and LCD Digital. Digital looks like the clock shown on 
left side of Figure 6-3, and Flip Clock is shown on the right side of 
Figure 6-3.
	
•	Home Time Zone: Select your time zone from the list.
 
• When Charging: Allows you to control the behavior of the clock 
when you connect your Curve to the charger. Possible choices are 
Do Nothing, Display Clock (the default), and Enter Bedside Mode.
 
• Set Time: Click this button, and you see a Date/Time screen that 
displays the current time in edit mode, allowing you to change the 
time. You can also change the time zone, as well decide whether to 
synchronize your BlackBerry time to the network carriers’ time.
	
✓	Alarm section: Navigate here if you want to customize the behavior of 
the alarm:
	
•	Alert Type: Choose the type of notification. The options are Tone 
(the default), Vibrate, and Tone + Vibrate.
	
•	Alarm Tune: Choose from a list of ring tones you want to play. 
This setting applies only if you have Tone or Tone + Vibrate 
selected for the Alert Type. The default tone is Alarm_Antelope.
	
Figure 6-3:

104
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
	
•	Volume: You can set the volume of the tone to Low, Medium (the 
default), High, or Escalating. Escalating means that the tone starts 
from Low and gradually goes to High.
	
•	Snooze Time: Just like with your ordinary alarm clock, you have 
the option to hit the snooze. You can choose 30, 15, 10, or 5 (the 
default) minutes, 1 minute, or None.
	
•	Number of Vibrations: The default is 1, which is a quick vibration 
of your Curve as your alarm. Choices are to repeat the vibration 
either 2 or 3 times.
	
✓	Bedside Mode section: This section allows you to set the behavior of 
your Curve when it is in Bedside mode:
	
•	Disable LED: Allows you to disable LED notifications during 
Bedside mode. Choices are Yes (the default) and No.
	
•	Disable Radio: Allows you to disable the radio during Bedside 
mode. Choices are Yes and No (the default).
	
	Disabling the radio means that all communication-related applica­
tions — such as e-mail, SMS, BlackBerry Messenger, instant mes­
saging clients, and Phone — cannot receive incoming signals.
	
•	Dim Screen: Choose the Yes (the default) or No option to control 
the dimming of the screen when in Bedside mode.
	
✓	Stopwatch section: A section to change the face of the stopwatch:
	
•	Stopwatch Face: Choose between an Analog (the default) and a 
Digital stopwatch.
	
✓	Countdown Timer section: Navigate here if you want to customize the 
behavior of the timer:
	
•	Timer Face: Your choices are Analog (the default) and Digital.
	
•	Timer Tune: Choose from a list of ring tones you want to play 
when the timer reaches the time you set.
	
•	Volume: You can either select Mute or set the volume of the tone 
to Low, Medium (the default), High, or Escalating. Escalating 
means that the tone starts Low and gradually goes to High.
	
•	Vibrate: Choose Yes if you want the Curve to vibrate when the 
timer reaches the time set; otherwise, choose No (the default).
Setting a Wake-Up Alarm
The Clock application is also your bedside alarm clock. You can set it to wake 
you up once or on a regular basis.

105
 Chapter 6: Setting Alarms and Keeping Your Passwords
Here’s how you tell your wake-up buddy to do the work for you:
	
1.	Select Clock from the Home screen.
	
	 The Clock appears.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Set Alarm.
	
	 A time field appears on the bottom of the screen, as shown in Figure 6-4. 
The time defaults to the previous set alarm time or, if you haven’t used 
the alarm before, the current time. If the default time isn’t your intended 
alarm time, proceed to Step 3 to change the time.
	
Figure 6-4: 
Set your 
alarm time 
here.
	
	
3.	Scroll sideways to select the specific portion of the time that you want 
to change, and enter the values.
	
	 Any highlighted portion of the time is editable. You can change the 
hours; minutes; AM/PM; and whether the alarm is ON, OFF, or only 
WEEKDAYS. Setting a value doesn’t create an entry in Calendar or Tasks. 
You can either enter the value or scroll up or down to choose among 
possible values.
	
4.	Press the trackball or trackpad to accept all your changes.
Setting and Exiting Bedside Mode
You can use a setting in the Clock application called Bedside mode to mini­
mize disturbances by your Curve. With Bedside mode, you can dim the 
screen, disable the LED, and even turn off the radio, all of which pretty much 
make your Curve behave like a brick. Bear in mind that when you turn off the 
radio, you won’t get incoming phone calls or any type of messaging. If you 
want a refresher on how to set these options, see “Customizing Your Clock,” 
previously in this chapter.

106
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
To set your BlackBerry Curve in Bedside mode:
	
1.	Select Clock from the Home screen.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Enter Bedside Mode (see Figure 6-5, 
left).
	
	 That’s it. Your Curve should now behave like a good bedside companion.
	
Figure 6-5: 
Enter and 
exit Bedside 
mode here.
	
	
Buy a charging pod from shop.blackberry.com or shop.crackberry.
com. Then you can put your Curve on a bedside table in an upright position 
while the charging pod is adding juice to your device. Make sure that the 
Clock setting (not just the Curve) is in Bedside mode when charging. (To do 
so, select Clock from the Home screen. Press the menu key and then select 
Options. Under the Clock section, change When Charging to Enter Bedside 
Mode.)
To exit from Bedside mode:
	
1.	Select Clock from the Home screen.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Exit Bedside Mode, as shown on 
the right side of Figure 6-5.
Using Stopwatch
In case you ever need a stopwatch, you need look no further than your 
BlackBerry Curve. Here’s how to run the stopwatch:
	
1.	Select Clock from the Home screen.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Stopwatch.
	
	 You see a screen similar to Figure 6-6. There are two buttons on this 
screen:

107
 Chapter 6: Setting Alarms and Keeping Your Passwords
 
• Stopwatch button: Select this button to start and stop the 
stopwatch.
 
• Lap button: The image on this button looks like a circular arrow. 
This button is useful when someone is doing multiple laps in a 
swimming pool or on a track field and you want to record how long 
each lap takes. Select this to record the completion of a single lap; 
the lap and the lap time will be listed on the screen. Lap is labeled 
as Lap 1 for the first lap, Lap 2 for the second lap, and so on.
	
Figure 6-6: 
Start (left) 
and stop 
(right) your 
stopwatch.
	
	
3.	To start the stopwatch, select the Stopwatch button.
	
4.	To stop the stopwatch, select the Stopwatch button again.
Using Timer
Have you overcooked something? Not if you have a good timer to warn you:
	
1.	Select Clock from the Home screen.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Timer.
	
	 A screen similar to the left side of Figure 6-7 appears. The left button 
with the stopwatch image is the start and pause button. You can use 
the right one with the circular arrow image to stop and reset the timer. 
The default time for your timer is based on what you set earlier. If you 
haven’t set a time, proceed to the next step.
	
3.	Press the menu key and then select Set Timer.
	
	 A screen similar to the right side of Figure 6-7 appears.
	
4.	Enter the time.
	
	 You can enter the time based on hours, minutes, and seconds by using the 
numeric keys. Enter the time from left to right. For example, if you want to set 
the timer for 5 minutes and 20 seconds, just press 5, 2, and 0 in succession.

108
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
	
Figure 6-7: 
Start and 
set the time 
of the timer.
	
	
5.	Select Start.
	
	 Your timer starts ticking. Once it reaches the time, it will notify you.
You can customize the type of timer notification to a tone, a vibration, or both. 
To do so, select Clock from the Home screen. Press the menu key and then 
select Options. Under the Countdown Timer section, make your selections.
Using Password Keeper
Suppose that you’re in front of an Internet browser, trying to access an online 
account. For the life of you, you just can’t remember the account password. 
It’s your third login attempt, and if you fail this time, your account will be 
locked. Then you have to call the customer hotline and wait hours before you 
can speak to a representative. Argghh! We’ve all done it. Luckily, BlackBerry 
Curve gives you an application to avoid this headache.
Password Keeper is the simple yet practical BlackBerry Curve applica­
tion that makes your life that much easier. Password Keeper is filed in 
Applications (as shown in Figure 6-8).
Setting a password for Password Keeper
	
The first time you access Password Keeper, you’re prompted to enter a 
password. Be sure to remember the password you choose, because this is the 
password to all your passwords. Forgetting this password is like forgetting the 
combination of your safe. There is no way to retrieve a forgotten Password 
Keeper password. You are prompted to enter this master password every 
time you access the application.
Trust us — one password is much easier to remember than many passwords.

109
 Chapter 6: Setting Alarms and Keeping Your Passwords

folder.
	
Creating credentials
Okay, so you’re ready to fire up your handy-dandy Password Keeper appli­
cation. Now, what kinds of things does it expect you to do for it to work its 
magic? Obviously, you’ll need to collect the pertinent info for all your various 
password-protected accounts so that you can store them in the protected 
environs of Password Keeper. So when creating a new password entry, be 
sure you have the following information (see Figure 6-9):
	
✓	Title: This one’s straightforward. Just come up with a name to describe the 
password-protected account — My Favorite Shopping Site, for example.
	
✓	Username: This is where you enter the username for the account.
	
✓	Password: Enter the password for the account here.
	
✓	Website: Put the Web-site address (its URL) here.
	
✓	Notes: Not exactly crucial, but the Notes field does give you a bit of 
room to add a comment or two.
	
The only required field is Title, but a title alone usually isn’t of much use to 
you. We suggest that you fill in as much other information here as possible, 
but at the same time, be discreet about those locations where you use your user­
name and password — so don’t put anything in the Website field or use My 
eBay Account as a title. That way, in the unlikely case that someone gains 
access to your password to Password Keeper, the intruder will have a hard 
time figuring out where exactly to use your credentials.

110

Figure 6-9:

Generating random passwords
If you’re the kind of person who uses one password for everything but knows 
deep in your heart that this is just plain wrong, wrong, wrong, random pass­
word generation is for you. When creating a new password for yet another 
online account (or when changing your password for an online account you 
already have), fire up Password Keeper, press the trackball or trackpad, 
and then select Random Password from the menu that appears, as shown in 
Figure 6-10. Voilà! A new password is automatically generated for you.
	
Using random password generation makes sense in conjunction with 
Password Keeper because you don’t have to remember the randomly gener­
ated password that Password Keeper came up with for any of your online 
accounts — that’s Password Keeper’s job.
Using your password
The whole point of Password Keeper is to let your BlackBerry Curve’s 
electronic brain do your password remembering for you. So imagine this 
scenario: You can no longer live without owning a personal copy of the A 
Chipmunk Christmas CD, so you surf on over to your favorite online music 
store and attempt to log in. You draw a blank on your password, but instead 
of seething, you take out your Curve, open Password Keeper, and do a find.
Type the first letters of your account title in the Find field to search for the 
title of your password. After you find (and highlight) the title, you press the 
trackball or trackpad, and the screen for your account appears, conveniently 
listing the password. All you have to do now is enter the password in the 
login screen for the online music store, and Alvin, Simon, and Theodore will 
soon be wending their way to your address, ready to sing “Chipmunk Jingle 
Bells.”

111
 Chapter 6: Setting Alarms and Keeping Your Passwords
	
Yes, you can copy and paste your password from Password Keeper to another 
application — BlackBerry Browser, for instance. Just highlight the password 
name, press the trackball or trackpad, and select Copy to Clipboard from the 
menu that appears. Then navigate to where you want to enter the password, 
press the trackball or trackpad, and select Paste from the menu. Keep in mind 
that for the copy-and-paste function to work for passwords from Password 
Keeper, you need to enable the Allow Clipboard Copy option in Password 
Keeper options (see the upcoming Table 6-1). You can copy and paste only 
one password at a time.
	
After you paste your password in another application, clear the Clipboard by 
pressing the trackball or trackpad and choosing Clear Clipboard. The 
Clipboard keeps your last copied password until you clear it.
	
Figure 6-10: 
Generate 
a random 
password.
	
Password Keeper options
Password Keeper’s Options menu, accessible by pressing the menu key while 
in Password Keeper, allows you to control how Password Keeper behaves. 
For example, you can set what characters can make up a randomly generated 
password. Table 6-1 describes all the options in Password Keeper.
Changing your password to 
Password Keeper
If you want to change your master password to Password Keeper — the pass­
word for opening Password Keeper itself — follow these steps:
	
1.	Select Password Keeper.
	
	 The initial login screen for the Password Keeper application appears.

112
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
	
2.	Enter your old password to access Password Keeper.
	
3.	In Password Keeper, press the menu key and then select Change 
Password.
	
	 Doing so calls up the Password Keeper screen that allows you to enter 
your new password, as shown in Figure 6-11.
	
4.	Enter a new password, confirm it by entering it again, and then use 
your trackball or trackpad to click OK.

T
he BlackBerry phone operates no differently from any other phone 
you’ve used. So why bother with this chapter? Although your BlackBerry 
phone operates like any other phone, it has capabilities that far outreach 
those of your run-of-the-mill cellphone. For example, when was the last time 
your phone was connected to your to-do list? Have you ever received an 
e-mail and placed a call directly from that e-mail? We didn’t think so. But with 
your BlackBerry, you can do all these things and more.
In this chapter, we first cover phone basics and then show you some of 
the neat ways the BlackBerry Phone application intertwines with other 
BlackBerry applications and functions.
Using the BlackBerry Phone Application
Accessing the Phone application from the BlackBerry is a snap. You can 
press the green Send button located right below the display screen to get 
into the Phone application.
You can get to the Phone application also by pressing any of the numeric 
keys. To do this, however, you have to make sure that the Dial from Home 

114
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
Screen option is enabled in Phone Options. If you’re a frequent phone user, 
we recommend that you enable this option.
To enable dialing from the Home screen, follow these steps:
	
1.	From your BlackBerry Curve, press the green send key.
	
	 Phone opens, showing the dial screen as well as your call history list.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select the Options (wrench) icon.
	
3.	Select General Options.
	
4.	Highlight the Dial from Home Screen option, press the trackball or 
trackpad, and then select Yes from the drop-down list.
	
	 This enables you to make a phone call by pressing the numeric keys 
from the Home screen.
	
5.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
Making and Receiving Calls
The folks at RIM have created an intuitive user interface to all the essential 
Phone features, including making and receiving calls.
Making a call
To make a call, start from the Home screen, and type the phone number you 
want to dial. As soon as you start typing numbers, the Phone application opens. 
When you finish typing the destination number, press the green send key.
Calling from Contacts
Because you can’t possibly remember the phone numbers of all your friends 
and colleagues, calling from Contacts is convenient and useful. To call from 
Contacts, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Phone application.
	
2.	Press the menu key.
	
	 The Phone menu appears, as shown in Figure 7-1.
	
3.	Select Call from Contacts.
	
	 Contacts opens. From here, you can search as usual for the contact 
you’d like to call.

115
 Chapter 7: Calling Your Favorite Person
	
4.	From Contacts, highlight your call recipient and then select Call.
	
	 This makes the call. Note that if your contact has more than one 
number, the BlackBerry Curve is smart enough to list all available num­
bers (through a pop-up dialog box).
	
Figure 7-1: 
The Phone 
menu.
	
Dialing letters
	
One of the nice features of BlackBerry Phone is that you can dial letters, and 
BlackBerry will figure out the corresponding number. For example, to dial 
1-800-11-LEARN, do the following on your BlackBerry:
	
1.	From the Home screen or the Phone application, dial 1-8-0-0-1-1.
	
	 As you type the first number, the Phone application opens (if it isn’t 
open already) and displays the numbers you dialed.
	
2.	Press and hold the Alt key, and then dial (press) L-E-A-R-N.
	
	 The letters appear onscreen as you type.
	
3.	Press the green send key.
	
	 The call is initiated.
Receiving a call
Receiving a call on your BlackBerry is even easier than making a call. You 
can receive calls in a couple of ways. One is by using your BlackBerry’s auto­
mated answering feature, and the other is by answering manually.
Automated answering is triggered whenever you take your BlackBerry out of 
your holster; in other words, just taking out the BlackBerry forces it to auto­
matically pick up any call, so you can start talking right away. However, 
you don’t have time to see who is calling you (on your Caller ID). Note: To 

116
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
disable autoanswering, be sure that your BlackBerry isn’t in its holster when 
an incoming call arrives.
What’s the advantage of disabling autoanswering? Well, manual answering 
prompts you to answer a call or ignore a call when you receive an incoming 
call (see Figure 7-2). This way, you can see on your Caller ID who is calling 
you before you decide to pick up or ignore the call.
However, if you want to turn on autoanswer, you can do this in Phone Options:
	
1.	Open the Phone application.
	
2.	Press the menu key.
	
	 The Phone menu appears (refer to Figure 7-1).
	
3.	Select Options.
	
	 The Phone Options screen appears, listing the categories of options.
	
4.	Select General Options.
	
	 This opens the General Options screen.
	
5.	In the Auto Answer Calls field, select Out of Holster.
	
6.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
	
Figure 7-2: 
An incom-
ing call on a 
BlackBerry 
Curve.
	
Handling missed calls
So you missed a call from that important client. What made it worse is that 
you didn’t notice the missed call because you didn’t see the little Missed Call 
icon. That happened because you pay attention only to what is in your e-mail 
message box. What can you do to make sure that you return that call?

117
 Chapter 7: Calling Your Favorite Person
	
You can make missed calls appear in your e-mail message box so that you are 
sure to return your missed calls (if you choose to, that is).
To have your missed calls appear in your inbox, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Phone application.
	
2.	Press the menu key.
	
	 The Phone menu appears (refer to Figure 7-1).
	
3.	Select Options.
	
	 The Phone Options screen appears, listing the different categories of 
options.
	
4.	Select Call Logging.
	
	 This opens the Call Logging screen.
	
5.	Highlight the Missed Calls option, and press the trackball or trackpad.
	
	 You can also select All Calls, which means that incoming and outgoing 
calls will be displayed in your e-mail inbox.
	
6.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
Phone Options while on a Call
When you’re on the phone, situations might arise in which you’d want to 
mute your conversation, place a call on hold, or change the call volume. No 
problem. BlackBerry Curve makes such adjustments easy.
Muting your call
You may want to use the Mute feature while on a conference call (see the 
upcoming section “Arranging Conference Calls”) when you don’t need to 
speak but do need to hear what is being discussed. Maybe you’re on the bus 
or have kids in the background, making your surroundings noisy. By using 
Mute, these background noises are filtered out from the conference call.
To mute your call, follow these steps:
	
1.	While in a conversation, press the menu key.
	
	 The Phone menu appears in all its glory.
	
2.	Select Mute.
	
	 You hear a tone, indicating that your call is being muted.

Part II: Organizing with Curve 
Follow these steps to unmute your call:
	
1.	While a call is on mute, press the menu key.
	
	 The Phone menu makes another appearance.
	
2.	Select Turn Mute Off.
	
	 You hear a tone, indicating that your call is now unmuted.
Placing your call on hold
Unlike muting a call, placing a call on hold prohibits both you and your caller 
from hearing each other. To put a conversation on hold, follow these steps:
	
1.	While in a conversation, press the menu key.
	
	 The Phone menu appears yet again.
	
2.	Select Hold.
	
	 Your call is now on hold.
Follow these steps to unhold your call:
	
1.	While a call is on hold, press the menu key.
	
	 A new menu appears.
	
2.	Select Resume.
	
	 You can continue your conversation.
Adjusting the call volume
Adjusting the call volume, a simple yet important action on your BlackBerry 
phone, can be performed by simply pressing the volume up or volume down 
key on the side of your BlackBerry.
Customizing Your BlackBerry Phone
Would you like to change some things about how the BlackBerry phone 
works? In the following sections, we go through some settings that can make 
you the master of your BlackBerry phone.

Setting up your voice mail number
This section shows you how to set up your voice mail access number. 
Unfortunately, the instructions for setting up your voice mailbox vary, 
depending on your service provider. However, most service providers are 
more than happy to walk you through the steps to get your mailbox set up in 
a jiffy.
To set up your voice mail access number, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Phone application.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Options.
 	
	 A list of phone options appears.
	
3.	Select Voice Mail.
	
	 This opens the voice mail configuration screen.
	
4.	Scroll to the Access Number field, and enter your voice mail access 
number.
	
	 If this field is empty, and you don’t know the voice mail access number, 
contact your service provider.
	
5.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
Using call forwarding
On the BlackBerry Curve, you have two types of call forwarding:
	
✓	Forward all calls: Any calls to your BlackBerry Curve are forwarded 
to the number you designate. Another name for this feature is uncondi­
tional forwarding.
	
✓	Forward unanswered calls: Calls that meet different types of conditions 
are forwarded to different numbers as follows:
 
• If busy: You don’t have call waiting turned on, and you’re on the 
phone.
 
• If no answer: You don’t hear your phone ring or somehow are 
unable to pick up your phone (perhaps you’re in a meeting).
 
• If unreachable: You’re out of network coverage and cannot receive 
any signals.

120
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
Out of the box, your BlackBerry forwards any unanswered calls, regardless of 
conditions, to your voice mail number by default. However, you can add new 
numbers to forward a call to.
You need to be within network coverage before can you change your call for­
warding option. After you’re within network coverage, you can change your 
call forwarding settings by doing the following:
	
1.	Open the Phone application, press the menu key, and select Options.
	
	 A list of phone options appears.
	
2.	Select Call Forwarding.
	
	 Your BlackBerry now attempts to connect to the server. If it’s success­
ful, you’ll see the Call Forwarding screen.
	
	 If you don’t see the Call Forwarding screen, wait until you have network 
coverage and try again.
	
3.	From the Call Forwarding screen, press the menu key and then select 
Edit Numbers.
	
	 A list of numbers appears. If this is the first time you’re setting call for­
warding, most likely only your voice mail number is in this list.
	
4.	To add a new forwarding number, press the menu key and then select 
New Number.
	
	 A pop-up menu appears, prompting you to enter the new forwarding 
number.
	
5.	In the pop-up window, enter the number you want to forward to and 
then press the trackball or trackpad.
	
	 The new number you entered now appears on the call forward number 
list. You can add this new number to any call forwarding types or 
conditions.
	
6.	Press the escape key.
	
	 You are returned to the Call Forwarding screen.
	
7.	Select the If Unreachable field.
	
	 A drop-down list appears, listing numbers from the call forwarding 
number list, including the one you just added.
	
8.	Select the number you want to forward to.
	
	Doing so places the selected number into the If Unreachable field. You 
can see this on the Call Forwarding screen.
	
9.	Confirm your changes by pressing the menu key and then selecting 
Save.

Configuring speed dial
Speed dial is a convenient feature on any phone. And after you get used to 
having it on a phone system, it’s hard not to use it on other phones, including 
your BlackBerry phone.
Viewing your speed dial list
To view your speed dial list, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Phone application.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select View Speed Dial List.
	
	 This displays a list of speed dial entries, as shown in Figure 7-3. If you 
haven’t set up any speed dials, this list will be empty.
	
	 Note that the A and Q keys have already been assigned. The A key locks 
the screen, and the Q key changes profile settings to vibrate.
	
Figure 7-3:

dial list on a 
BlackBerry 
Curve.
	
Adding a number to speed dial
Setting up speed dial numbers is as easy as using them. It takes a few sec­
onds to set them up, but you benefit every time you use this feature.
To assign a number to a speed dial slot, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Phone application.
	
2.	Press the menu key, select Options, and then select View Speed Dial 
List.
	
	 This displays your list of speed dial numbers.

122
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
	
3.	Scroll to an empty speed dial slot, press the menu key, and then select 
New Speed Dial.
	
	 BlackBerry Contacts appears so that you can select a contact’s phone 
number. Note that the phone number you are assigning is associated 
with the letters on the left side of the screen.
	
4.	From the contacts list, select a contact.
	
	 If more than one number is associated with the selected contact, you’re 
prompted to select which number to add to the speed dial list. The 
number appears in the speed dial list.
Using speed dial
After you have a few speed dial entries set up, you can start using them. To 
do so, while on the Home screen or in the Phone application, press a speed 
dial key. The call is initiated to the number associated with that particular 
speed dial key.
Arranging Conference Calls
To have two or more people on the phone with you — the infamous confer­
ence call — do the following:
	
1.	Use the Phone application to place a call to the first participant.
	
2.	While the first participant is on the phone with you, press the menu 
key and then select New Call.
	
	 This automatically places the first call on hold and brings up a New Call 
screen, as shown in Figure 7-4, prompting you to place another call.
	
Figure 7-4: 
A meeting 
participant 
is on hold.
	

123
 Chapter 7: Calling Your Favorite Person
	
3.	Place a call to the second participant by dialing a number, pressing 
the menu key, and then selecting Call.
	
	 You can dial the number by using the number pad, or you can select a 
frequently dialed number from your call log. To place a call from your 
Contacts, press the menu key from the New Call screen and then select 
Call from Contacts. Your BlackBerry then prompts you to select a con­
tact to dial.
	
	 The call to the second meeting participant is just like any other phone 
call (except that the first participant is still on the other line).
	
4.	While the second participant is on the phone with you, press the 
menu key and then select Join Conference, as shown in Figure 7-5.
	
	 This reconnects the first participant with you. Now you can talk to both 
participants at the same time.
	
Figure 7-5: 
Join two 
other people 
in a confer-
ence call.
	
	
Another name for having two people on the phone with you is three-way call­
ing, which isn’t a new concept. If you want to chat with four people or even ten 
people on the phone at the same time, you certainly can. Simply repeat Steps 
2 through 4 until all the participants are on the phone.
Talking privately to a 
conference participant
During a conference call, you may want to talk to one participant privately. 
This is called splitting your conference call. Here’s how you do it:

124
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
	
1.	While on a conference call, press the menu key and then select Split 
Call.
	
	 A pop-up screen appears, listing all the participants of the conference 
call.
	
2.	From the pop-up screen, select the participant with whom you want to 
speak privately, as shown in Figure 7-6.
	
	 This action places all other participants on hold and connects you to the 
participant you selected. On the display screen, you can see to whom 
you are connected — this confirms that you selected the right person to 
chat with privately.
	
Figure 7-6: 
Split your 
conference 
call.
	
	
3.	To talk to all participants again, press the menu key and then select 
Join Conference.
	
	Doing so brings you back to the conference call with everyone else.
Alternating between phone conversations
Whether you’re in a private conversation during a conference call or you’re 
talking to someone while you have someone else on hold, you can switch 
between the two conversations by swapping them. Follow these steps:
	
1.	While talking to someone with another person on hold, press the 
menu key and then select Swap.
	
	Doing so switches you from the person with whom you’re currently talk­
ing to the person who was on hold.
	
2.	Repeat Step 1 to go back to the original conversation.

125
 Chapter 7: Calling Your Favorite Person
Dropping that meeting-hugger
If you’ve been on conference calls, you can identify those chatty “meeting-
huggers” who have to say something about everything. Don’t you wish that 
you could drop them off the call? Well, with your BlackBerry, you can (as 
long as you are the meeting moderator or the person who initiated the call). 
Follow these steps to perform the drop-kick:
	
1.	While on a conference call, press the menu key and then select Drop Call.
	
	 A pop-up screen appears, listing all conference call participants.
	
2.	Select the meeting-hugger you want to drop.
	
	 That person is disconnected.
	
3.	Everyone else now can continue the conversation as usual.
Communicating Hands-Free
More and more places prohibit the use of mobile phones without a hands-
free headset. Here are the hands-free options for your BlackBerry.
Using the speaker phone
The Speaker Phone function is useful under certain situations, such as when 
you’re in a room full of people who want to join your phone conversation. 
Or you might be all by your lonesome in your office but are stuck rooting 
through your files — hard to do with a BlackBerry scrunched up against your 
ear. (We call such moments multitasking — a concept so important that we 
devote an entire upcoming section to it.)
To switch to the speaker phone while you’re on a phone call, press the menu 
key and then select Activate Speaker Phone. You can also use the Speaker 
key (the same as the $ key) to turn on the speaker phone.
Pairing your BlackBerry 
with a Bluetooth headset
Because BlackBerry smartphones come with a wired hands-free headset, you 
can start using yours by simply plugging it into the headset jack on the left 
side of the BlackBerry. You adjust the volume of the headset by pressing up 
or down on the volume keys, the same way you would adjust the call volume 
without the headset.

126
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
Using the wired hands-free headset can help you avoid being a police target, 
but if you’re multitasking on your BlackBerry, the wired headset can get in 
the way and become inconvenient.
This is where the whole Bluetooth wireless thing comes in. You can purchase a 
BlackBerry Bluetooth headset to go with your Bluetooth-enabled BlackBerry. 
After you purchase a BlackBerry-compatible Bluetooth headset, you can 
pair it with your BlackBerry. Think of pairing a Bluetooth headset with your 
BlackBerry as registering the headset with your BlackBerry so that it recog­
nizes the headset.
First things first: You need to prep your headset for pairing. Now, each head­
set manufacturer has a different take on this, so you’ll need to consult your 
headset documentation for details. With that out of the way, continue with 
the pairing as follows:
	
1.	From the Home screen, press the menu key and then select Bluetooth.
	
2.	Press the menu key to display the Bluetooth menu.
	
	 You see the Enable Bluetooth option. If you see the Disable Bluetooth 
option instead, you can skip to Step 4.
	
3.	From the menu, select Enable Bluetooth.
	
	 This enables Bluetooth on your BlackBerry.
	
4.	Press the menu key to display the Bluetooth menu and then select 
Add Device.
	
	 You see the Searching for Devices progress bar, um, progressing, as 
shown in Figure 7-7. When your BlackBerry discovers the headset, a 
Select Device dialog box appears with the name of the headset.
	
5.	From the Select Device dialog box, select the Bluetooth headset.
	
	 A dialog box appears to prompt you for a passkey code to the headset.
	
Figure 7-7: 
Searching 
for a 
headset.
	

127
 Chapter 7: Calling Your Favorite Person
	
6.	Enter the passkey, and press the trackball or trackpad.
	
	 Normally, the passkey code is 0000, but refer to your headset docu­
mentation. After you successfully enter the passkey code, you see your 
headset listed in the Bluetooth setting.
	
7.	Press the menu key to display the Bluetooth menu and then select 
Connect.
	
	 Your BlackBerry now attempts to connect to the Bluetooth headset.
	
8.	When you see a screen similar to Figure 7-8, you can start using your 
Bluetooth headset.
	
Figure 7-8: 
Now 
you can 
use your 
Bluetooth 
headset.
	
Using voice dialing
With your headset and the Voice Dialing application, you can truly be hands-
free from your BlackBerry. You may be thinking, how do I activate the Voice 
Dialing application without touching my BlackBerry? Good question. The 
majority of hands-free headsets (Bluetooth or not) come with a multipurpose 
button.
	
Usually, a multipurpose button on a hands-free headset can mute, end, and initi­
ate a call. Refer to the operating manual of your hands-free headset for more info.
After your headset is active, press its multipurpose button to activate the 
Voice Dialing application. You will be greeted with a voice stating, “Say a 
command.” At this point, simply say, “Call,” and state the name of a person 
or say the number. (For example, say, “Call President Obama” or “Call 555-
2468.”) The Voice Dialing application is good at recognizing the name of the 
person and the numbers you dictate. However, we strongly suggest that you 
try out the voice dialing feature before you need it.

128
Part II: Organizing with Curve 
Multitasking while on the Phone
One of the great things about the BlackBerry Curve is that you can use it for 
other tasks while you’re on the phone. For example, you can take notes or 
make a to-do list. Or you can look up a phone number in BlackBerry Contacts 
that your caller is requesting. You can even compose an e-mail and receive 
e-mails while on a call!
	
When multitasking, you really need to be using a hands-free headset or a 
speaker phone. Otherwise, your face would be stuck to your BlackBerry, and 
you couldn’t engage in your conversation and multitask at the same time.
Accessing applications while on the phone
After you have donned your hands-free headset or have turned on a speaker 
phone, you can start multitasking by doing the following:
	
You can turn on the speaker phone by pressing the Speaker key (the same as 
the $ key).
	
1.	While in a conversation, from the Phone application, press the menu 
key and then select the Home screen.
	
	 (Alternatively, you can simply press the escape key while in the Phone 
application to return to the Home screen.) This returns you to the Home 
screen without terminating your phone conversation.
	
2.	From the Home screen, you can start multitasking.
While on the phone and multitasking, however, you can still access the 
Phone menu from other applications. For example, from your to-do list, you 
can end a call or put a call on hold.
Taking notes while on the phone
To take notes of your call, follow these steps:
	
1.	During a phone conversation, press the menu key and then select 
Notes.
	
	 This displays the Notes screen.
	
2.	Type notes for the conversation, as shown in Figure 7-9.
	
	 When the call ends, the notes are automatically saved for you.

129
 Chapter 7: Calling Your Favorite Person

while on a 
phone call.
	
Accessing phone notes
From the call history list (see Figure 7-10), you can access notes that you’ve 
made during a call or a conference call. In addition, you can edit notes and 
add new notes.
	
Figure 7-10: 
Call history,

Forwarding phone notes
You can forward your phone notes just like any e-mail. While on the Call 
History screen (refer to Figure 7-10), press the menu key and then select 
Forward.
	
You can add notes not only while you’re on the phone but also afterward. 
While you are viewing a call history, press the menu key. Then select Add 
Notes if you have no notes for the call, or select Edit Notes if you already have 
notes for the call.

H
ere’s the good stuff: using your BlackBerry for e-mail 
(Chapter 8), text messaging (Chapter 9), messaging 
using the BlackBerry Messenger (Chapter 10) and going 
online and Web surfing (Chapter 11). 

Chapter 8
You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
In This Chapter
▶	Linking your e-mail accounts to your BlackBerry Curve
▶	Adding your own e-mail signature
▶	Reconciling e-mails on your Curve and PC
▶	Receiving, sending, and spell-checking e-mails
▶	Deleting and filtering your e-mails
▶	Searching your e-mail
▶	Saving messages
Your BlackBerry Curve brings a fresh new face to the convenience and 
ease of use that you associate with e-mail. You can “hook” as many as 
ten e-mail accounts (from your work e-mail to personal e-mail from providers 
such as Yahoo! and AOL) to your Curve. You can set up an e-mail signature, 
configure e-mail filters, and search for e-mails.
In this chapter, you find answers on how to use and manage the e-mail capa­
bilities of your Curve to their full potential. From setup to sorts, it’s all cov­
ered here.
Getting Up and Running with E-Mail
Regardless of your network service provider (such as T-Mobile, or Rogers, 
or Vodafone), you can set up your Curve to receive mail from at least one 
of your e-mail accounts. Thus, with whatever address you use to send and 
receive e-mail from your PC (Yahoo!, Gmail, and so on), you can hook up your 
Curve to use that same e-mail address. Instead of checking your Gmail from 
your desktop, for example, you can now get it on your Curve.

134
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
	
Most network service providers allow you to connect as many as ten e-mail 
accounts to your Curve. This provides you with the convenience of one cen­
tral point from which you can get all your e-mail, without having to log on to 
multiple e-mail accounts. Such convenience!
	
In an enterprise environment — depending on your company policy — you 
might not be able to access the BlackBerry Internet Service site to link your 
personal e-mail accounts to your Curve. If you work for a Fortune 500 com­
pany, most likely you can’t access BlackBerry Internet Service. However, 
you can still configure e-mail settings (such as the BlackBerry e-mail filter 
and BlackBerry e-mail reconciliation) to make your e-mail experience that 
much better. (See the upcoming section “Enabling Wireless Reconciliation.”) 
If you’re an enterprise user, skip to the parts where you see the Enterprise 
icon to configure your e-mail settings. If you haven’t set up e-mail on your 
company-owned Curve, see the upcoming section “Setting up e-mail in an 
enterprise environment.”
Using the BlackBerry 
Internet Service client
You can pull together all your e-mail accounts into one by using the 
BlackBerry Internet Service client (formerly known as the BlackBerry Web 
client). The BlackBerry Internet Service client allows you to do the following:
	
✓	Manage multiple e-mail accounts: As we mention earlier, you can com­
bine as many as ten of your e-mail accounts onto your Curve. See the 
next section for details.
	
✓	Use wireless e-mail reconciliation: No more trying to match your Curve 
e-mail against e-mail in your combined account(s). Just turn on wireless 
e-mail reconciliation, and you’re good to go. For more on this, see the 
upcoming section “Enabling Wireless Reconciliation.”
	
✓	Create e-mail filters: You can filter e-mails on your Curve so that you get 
only those messages that you truly care about. See the “Filtering your 
e-mail” section, near the end of this chapter.
Think of the BlackBerry Internet Service client as an online e-mail account 
manager, but one that doesn’t keep your e-mails. Instead, it routes the e-mails 
from your other accounts to your Curve (because it’s directly connected to 
your Curve).

135
 Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
Combining your e-mail accounts into one
To start aggregating, or combining, e-mail accounts (such as Gmail) onto 
your Curve, you must first run a setup program from the BlackBerry Internet 
Service client. You can access the Service client from your Curve or from 
your desktop computer.
To access the BlackBerry Internet Service client from your PC, you need the 
URL that is specific to your network service. Contact your network service 
provider (T-Mobile, Verizon, and so on) directly to get that information.
After you’ve logged on to the BlackBerry Internet Service client, you should 
see a screen similar to Figure 8-1. If your network provider has activated your 
account, you should see one e-mail address — the default address of your 
account.
You will see a set of options on the left navigation bar. The Email Accounts 
option allows you to add, edit, and delete e-mail accounts. In addition, for 
each e-mail address, you can set up filters and an e-mail signature.
	
Figure 8-1: 
Set up 
an e-mail 
account 
here.
	

136
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
As we mention previously, your Curve already has a default e-mail address 
that you can use to receive and send e-mail. If you don’t have any other 
e-mail account that you want to meld into your BlackBerry e-mail account, 
simply skip to the upcoming “Configuring Your E-Mail Signature” section.
Adding an e-mail account
To add an e-mail account to your BlackBerry account, follow these steps 
from your desktop PC:
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Internet Service client (refer to Figure 8-1), click 
the Set Up Account button.
	
2.	On the e-mail account screen, enter the e-mail address and logon cre­
dentials for that e-mail address:
 
• E-mail address: The address from which you want to receive e-mail 
(for example, myid@yahoo.com)
 
• Account logon: The one you use to log on to this e-mail account
 
• Password: The one you use with the logon
	
3.	Click Next.
	
	 You’re finished. It’s that easy!
You can also manage your accounts from your Curve. From the Home screen, 
press the menu key and select Set Up Internet E-Mail. The rest is pretty much 
the same on the Curve as it is on a PC.
	
With your BlackBerry Curve, you can create and set up the BlackBerry 
Internet Service account as you would on your PC. Although you could do 
this even before OS 5.0, the new interface has made setting up a BlackBerry 
Internet Service account much easier.
To add an e-mail account to your BlackBerry account from your BlackBerry, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	From your BlackBerry Home screen, select Setup Folder.
	
2.	Select the Person E-mail Setup icon.
	
	 You are prompted with a login screen similar to Figure 8-2. If you haven’t 
created your account, you see a Create button to create your BlackBerry 
Internet Service account username and a password for you to log in.

Setting up e-mail in an 
enterprise environment
	
This section is for you if your Curve can’t receive and send e-mail yet — such 
as when you first get your Curve or you swap an old model for a new one.
If your e-mail function works properly on your Curve, you can skip this section.
Follow these steps to activate your BlackBerry Curve for enterprise use:
	
1.	From the Home screen, press the menu key and then select Enterprise 
Activation.
	
	 The Enterprise Activation screen opens, with two fields for you to fill in:
 
• Your corporate e-mail address: For example, myaccount@abc
Company.com
 
• Your password: From your IT department
	
2.	Type your corporate e-mail account along with the appropriate 
password.
	
	 If you don’t know this information, contact your corporate system 
administrator.
	
3.	Press the menu key and then select Activate.
	
	 Your Curve attempts to activate itself with your corporation.
	
	Some corporations don’t allow any employee-purchased BlackBerry 
smartphones to be activated with corporate e-mail. Check with your 
system administrator for corporate BlackBerry policies.

If you are a sole proprietor or consultant who works in a corporation that 
runs Exchange or Lotus, and you would like to get enterprise e-mails on your 
Curve, this section is for you.
Typically, to get enterprise e-mail, your Curve would have to be configured 
with the BlackBerry Enterprise Server. Expect this if your employer hands 
you a Curve. However, if you work for a company as a contractor, you prob­
ably won’t be getting a BlackBerry from that company. When you want to get 
enterprise e-mail so that you don’t fall behind, you need Desktop Redirector 
so that you can get company e-mail on your personal BlackBerry.
To start using Desktop Redirector, you first need to install BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager; see Chapter 16 for details about how to do this. After you 
install Desktop Manager with Redirector, make sure that Redirector starts 
every time you boot your PC.
	
Depending on the corporate security policy, some corporations allow Desktop 
Redirector, and some do not. Before you start using Desktop Redirector, con­
tact the IT department in the company you work for.
Here are just a few caveats when using Desktop Redirector:
	
✓	You can get enterprise e-mail as long as your PC is turned on and has an 
Internet connection.
	
✓	When someone sends you an attachment, you can’t retrieve it from your 
Curve. Unfortunately, that is the limitation for Desktop Redirector.
	
✓	When someone sends you a meeting notice, you can’t accept or reject it.
Configuring Your E-Mail Signature
If you’re tired of writing Regards, John Smith over and over to close an e-mail, 
set an e-mail signature. By default, your e-mail signature is something like 
“Sent via My BlackBerry,” which can be cool in the first week, showing off to 
people that you are à la mode with your BlackBerry. But sooner or later, you 
may not want people to know that you are out and about while answering 
e-mail. Or you may want something more personal.

Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
Follow these steps to configure your e-mail signature by using the BlackBerry 
Internet Service client:
	
1.	Log on to the client on your PC.
	
2.	In the BlackBerry Internet Service client (refer to Figure 8-1), click the 
Edit icon for the desired e-mail account.
	
	 The edit screen appears, as shown in Figure 8-4.

3.	In the Signature field, type the desired text for your e-mail signature.
	
4.	Click Save.
Enabling Wireless Reconciliation
With wireless reconciliation, you don’t need to delete the same e-mail in two 
places (on your computer and on your Curve). The two e-mail inboxes reconcile 
with each other — hence, the term wireless reconciliation. Convenient, huh?

141
 Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
Enabling wireless e-mail synchronization
You can start wireless e-mail synchronization by configuring your Curve. 
Follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Home screen, press the menu key and then select Messages.
	
	This opens the Messages application. You see the message list.
	
2.	In the message list, press the menu key and then select Options.
	
	 The Options screen appears, with two option types: General Options 
and E-mail Reconciliation.
	
3.	Select E-mail Reconciliation.
	
	This opens the E-mail Reconciliation screen, which has the following 
options:
 
• Delete On: Configures how BlackBerry handles your e-mail 
deletion.
 
• Wireless Reconciliation: Turns on or off the wireless sync function.
 
• On Conflict: Controls how BlackBerry handles any inconsistencies 
between e-mail on your Curve and the BlackBerry Internet Service 
client.
	
	With this option, you can choose who “wins”: your Curve or the 
BlackBerry Internet Service client.
	
4.	Select Delete On and then select one of the following from the drop-
down list:
 
• Handheld: A delete on your Curve takes effect only on your Curve.
 
• Mailbox & Handheld: A delete on your Curve takes effect on both 
your Curve and your inbox on the BlackBerry Internet Service 
client.
 
• Prompt: This option prompts your Curve to ask you at the time of 
deletion where the deletion takes effect.
	
5.	Select Wireless Reconciliation and then select On from the drop-down 
list.
	
6.	Select On Conflict, and make a selection from the drop-down list.
	
	 If you choose Handheld Wins, the e-mail messages in your e-mail 
account will match the ones on the handheld.
Next, you need to configure BlackBerry Internet Service to ensure that 
Synchronize Deleted Items is selected:

142
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
	
1.	Log on to the client on your PC.
	
2.	In the BlackBerry Internet Service client (refer to Figure 8-1), click the 
Edit icon for the desired e-mail account.
	
	 The edit screen appears (refer to Figure 8-4).
	
3.	In the Synchronize Deleted Items field, make sure the check box is 
selected.
	
4.	Click Save.
	
Unfortunately, some e-mail accounts might not work well with the e-mail rec­
onciliation feature of the BlackBerry, so you still may have to delete an e-mail 
twice.
Permanently deleting e-mail 
from your Curve
When deleting e-mail on your Curve, the same message in that e-mail account 
is placed in the Deleted folder. You can set up your Curve to permanently 
delete e-mail, but use this option with caution because after that e-mail is 
gone, it’s truly gone.
To permanently delete e-mail on your BlackBerry Internet Service client from 
your Curve, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	In the message list, press the menu key and then select Options.
	
3.	On the Options screen, select E-mail Reconciliation.
	
4.	On the E-mail Reconciliation screen, press the menu key and then 
select Purge Deleted Items.
	
	 You see all your e-mail accounts.
	
5.	Choose the e-mail account from which you want to purge deleted 
items.
	
	A screen appears, warning you that you are about to purge deleted 
e-mails on your Service client.
	
6.	Select Yes.
	
	 Deleted e-mails in the selected e-mail account are purged.
	
Unfortunately, some e-mail accounts may not work with the Purge Deleted 
Items feature.

 Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
Working with E-Mail
From the Messages application, you send and receive your e-mails and also 
configure wireless e-mail reconciliation with your e-mail account(s). See the 
preceding section for information on e-mail reconciliation.
To access Messages, press the menu key from the Home screen and then 
select Messages. The first thing you see after opening Messages is the mes­
sage list. Your message list can contain e-mail, voice mail messages, missed-
phone-call notices, Short Messaging Service (SMS) messages, and even saved 
Web pages.
Receiving e-mails
Whether you’re concerned about security or speed of delivery, with 
BlackBerry’s up-to-date secured network, you’re in good hands when receiv­
ing e-mail on your Curve.
And whether you’ve aggregated accounts or just use the plain-vanilla 
BlackBerry e-mail account, you receive your e-mail the same way. When you 
receive an e-mail message, your Curve notifies you by displaying a numeral 
next to a mail icon (an envelope) at the top of the screen. This number rep­
resents how many new (unread) e-mails you have (see Figure 8-5). A red 
asterisk next to the envelope indicates that you have new mail and that you 
haven’t opened the Messages application yet. Your Curve can also notify you 
of new e-mail by vibration, a sound alert, or both. You can customize this 
from the Profile application, detailed in Chapter 3.
	
Figure 8-5: 
You’ve 
got (333) 
e-mails!

Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
Retrieving e-mail
Retrieving your e-mail is simple. Follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Home screen, press the menu key and then select Messages.
	
2.	In the message list, scroll to any e-mail, and press the trackball or 
trackpad.
	
	 You can tell whether an e-mail is unopened by the small, unopened 
envelope icon on the left side of the e-mail. A read e-mail bears an 
opened envelope icon, a sent e-mail has a check mark as its icon, and a 
document icon represents a draft e-mail.
	
3.	After you finish reading the message, press the escape key to return to 
the message list.
Sorting the message list
Your Curve mail lists messages in order by the date and time they were 
received, but you can sort by different criteria. For example, to see only 
incoming e-mail, press Alt+I. (For more predefined hot keys, see the upcom­
ing section “Reusing saved searches.”)
Sorting and searching are closely related on your Curve. In a sense, searching 
is really sorting your e-mail based on your search criteria. You can search 
your e-mail by the name of the sender or by keywords. Or you could run a 
search as broad as looking through all the e-mail that has been sent to you. 
See the later section “Searching through Messages Like a Pro” for more on 
searching and sorting.
Saving a message to the saved folder
You can save any important e-mail in a folder so that you can find it with­
out sorting through tons of e-mail. To do so, simply scroll to the e-mail you 
want to save, press the menu key, and then select Save from the menu. A 
pop-up message confirms that your e-mail has been saved. Your saved e-mail 
remains in the message list.
To retrieve or view a saved e-mail, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	In the message list, press the menu key and then select View Saved 
Messages.
	
	You see the list of messages you saved.
	
3.	Select the message you want and then press the trackball or trackpad 
to open it.

Viewing attachments
Your Curve is so versatile that you can view most e-mail attachments just 
like you can on a desktop PC. And we’re talking sizable attachments, too, 
such as JPEGs (photos), Word docs, PowerPoint slides, and Excel spread­
sheets. Table 8-1 shows a list of supported attachments viewable from your 
BlackBerry.
	
If you are using BlackBerry Desktop Redirector to get your e-mail onto your 
Curve, you won’t get attachments on your Curve.

To tell whether an e-mail has an attachment, look for the standard paper-clip 
icon next to your e-mail in the message list.
You retrieve all the different types of attachments the same way. This makes 
retrieving attachments an easy task. To open an attachment, follow along:
	
1.	While reading an e-mail, press the menu key and then select Open 
Attachment.

146
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
	
	 You see a screen that contains the name of the file, a Table of Contents 
option, and a Full Contents option. For Word documents, you can see 
different headings in outline form in the Table of Contents option. For 
picture files, such as JPEGs, you can go straight to the Full Contents 
option to see the graphic.
	
	 For all supported file types, you see Table of Contents and Full Contents 
as options. Depending on the file type, use your judgment on when you 
should use the Table of Contents option.
	
2.	Scroll to Full Contents, press the menu key, and then select Retrieve.
	
	 Your Curve attempts to contact the BlackBerry Internet Service client to 
retrieve your attachment. This retrieves only part of your attachment. 
As you peruse a document, your Curve retrieves more as you scroll 
through the attachment.
Editing attachments
Your Curve comes with Documents To Go, which means that out of the box, 
you not only can view, but also edit Word and PowerPoint documents. You can 
even save the documents to your Curve and transfer them later to your PC.
As an example, imagine editing a Word document that you received as an 
attachment to an e-mail:
	
1.	Open the e-mail.
	
2.	In the message list, open an e-mail with a Word document attached.
	
	 This opens the e-mail for you to read. Notice the little paper clip, indicat­
ing that it has an attachment.
	
3.	Press the menu key and then select Open Attachment.
	
	You’re prompted with a pop-up that asks whether you want to view the 
Word document or edit with Documents To Go.
	
4.	Select Edit with Documents To Go.
	
	Here, you can view and edit a document.
	
5.	Press the menu key and then select Edit Mode.
	
	In Edit mode, you can edit your document.
	
6.	When you are finished editing and viewing, you can either save the 
document on your Curve or e-mail it:
 
• To e-mail the edited document, press the menu key and then select 
Send via E-mail.
	
	You see an e-mail message with the Word document. Follow the 
steps described in the next section to send this e-mail attachment 
as you would any other e-mail.
 
• To save the document, press the menu key and then select Save.

147
 Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
	
	If you want to save the attachment to your Curve, you have to navi­
gate its folder structure. For documents, the default save location 
usually is the Documents folder.
Sending e-mail
The first thing you probably want to do when you get your BlackBerry to 
write an e-mail to let your friends know that you just got a BlackBerry. Follow 
these steps to send an e-mail message:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	In the message list, press the menu key, and select Compose E-mail.
	
	You are prompted with a blank e-mail that you need to fill out, just like 
you would do on your PC.
	
3.	In the To field, type the recipient’s name or e-mail address.
	
	 As you type, you see a list of contacts from your Contacts that match 
the name or address you’re typing. You can make a selection from this 
list.
	
4.	Enter a subject in the Subject field, and type your message in the Body 
field.
	
5.	When you’re finished, press the menu key and then select Send.
	
	 Your message has wings.
Forwarding e-mail
When you need to share an important e-mail with a colleague or a friend, you 
can forward that e-mail. Simply do the following:
	
1.	Open the e-mail.
	
	 For information on opening e-mail, see “Retrieving e-mail,” previously in 
this chapter.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Forward.
	
3.	Type the recipient’s name or e-mail address in the To field and then 
add a message if needed.
	
	 When you start typing your recipient’s name, a drop-down list of your 
contacts appears, and you can choose the recipient from it.
	
4.	Press the menu key and then select Send.
	
	 Your message is on its way to your recipient.

148
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
Sending e-mail to more than one person
When you need to send an e-mail to more than one person, just keep adding 
recipient names as needed. You can also add recipient names to receive a Cc 
(carbon copy) or Bcc (blind carbon copy). Here’s how:
	
1.	Open the e-mail.
	
	 For information on opening e-mail, see the previous section “Retrieving 
e-mail.”
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Compose E-mail.
	
3.	Specify the To field for the e-mail recipient and then press the 
Return key.
	
	Another To field is added automatically below the first. The Cc field 
works the same way.
	
4.	To add a Bcc recipient, press the menu key and then select Add Bcc.
	
	You see a Bcc field. You can specify a Bcc recipient the same way you 
do To and Cc recipients.
	
Whether you’re composing a new e-mail, replying, or forwarding an e-mail, you 
add new Cc and Bcc fields the same way.
Attaching a file to your e-mail
Many people are surprised that you can attach any document on your Curve 
or on the microSD card. You can attach Word, Excel, and PowerPoint docu­
ments as well as pictures, music, and videos. To send an e-mail with a file 
attached, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	In the message list, press the menu key and then select Compose 
E-mail.
	
	You are prompted with a blank e-mail that you can fill out as you would 
on your PC. Enter the recipient’s name in the To field and then enter the 
subject and body of the message.
	
3.	Press the menu key and then select Attach File.
	
	You’re prompted with a list of your folders. Think of these as the folders 
on your PC.
	
4.	Navigate to the file of your choice, and press the trackball or trackpad.
	
	 After you select a file, you see the file in the e-mail message.
	
5.	When you’re finished, press the menu key and then select Send.
	
	 Your message and attached file wing their way to the recipient.

149
 Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
Spell-checking your outgoing messages
Whether you’re composing an e-mail message or an SMS text message, you 
can always check your spelling with the built-in spell checker. Simply press 
the menu key and then select Check Spelling. When your Curve finds an 
error, the spell checker makes a suggestion, as shown in Figure 8-6. To skip 
the spell check for that word and go on to the next word, press the escape 
key. If you want to skip spell-checking for an e-mail, simply press and hold 
the escape key.
	
Figure 8-6: 
The 
BlackBerry 
spell 
checker in 
action.
	
	
Your Curve, just like Microsoft Word, underlines a misspelled word.
By default, the spell checker doesn’t kick in before you send your message, 
but you can configure it to check spelling before you send an e-mail. Follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Options.
	
3.	Select the Spell Check option.
	
4.	Select the Spell Check E-mail before Sending check box.
	
5.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
	
The underline feature is a default setting called Check Spelling as You Type. 
To turn off this feature, disable the Spell Check option in Message Options.

Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
Deleting e-mail
If you want to really clean up your old e-mails, and you don’t want to scroll 
through tons of messages, you can do the following:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	From the message list, highlight a horizontal date mark, press the 
menu key, and then choose Delete Prior.
	
	 The date mark is simply a horizontal bar with dates. Just like you can 
highlight e-mails in the message list, you can highlight the date mark. 
You are prompted to confirm the deletion.
	
	 Before you take the plunge, remember that going ahead will delete all the 
e-mails before the particular date mark. You cannot retrieve deleted items 
from your BlackBerry.
	
3.	Select Delete to confirm your deletion.
	
	All your e-mails before the date mark are history.
Filtering your e-mail
Most of us get e-mail that isn’t urgent or doesn’t concern us. Instead of 
receiving these e-mails on your Curve — and wasting both time and effort 
to check them — you can filter them out. While in the BlackBerry Internet 
Service client, set up filters to make your BlackBerry mailbox receive only the 
e-mails that you care about. (Don’t worry; you’ll still receive all your e-mails 
on your main computer.)
To create a simple filter that treats messages as urgent and forwards them to 
your Curve, follow these steps. In this example, we’re setting a filter to mark 
work-related messages as urgent.
	
1.	From your PC, log on to the BlackBerry Internet Service client (refer 
to Figure 8-1).
	
2.	Click the Filter icon for the desired e-mail account.
	
	 The Filter screen that appears shows a list of filters that have been cre­
ated. Figure 8-7 doesn’t have any filters yet.
	
3.	Click the Add a filter link.
	
	 The Add Filter screen appears, as shown in Figure 8-8.

Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
	
4.	Enter a name in the Filter Name text box.
	
	 The filter name can be anything you like. We’re using “from Me”.
	
5.	From the Apply Filter When drop-down list, choose the condition to 
place on the filter:
 
• A High-Priority Mail Arrives: The filter applies only to urgent 
e-mail.
 
• Subject Field Contains: The Contains field is enabled (you can type 
text in it). You can specify what keywords the filter will look for in 
the subject field. Separate entries with a semicolon (;).
 
• From Field Contains: The Contains field is enabled (you can type 
text in it). You can type full addresses or part of an address. For 
example, you can type rob@robkao.com or just kao. Separate 
entries with a semicolon (;).
 
• To Field Contains: Similar to From Field Contains, enter e-mail 
address(es).
	
• CC Field Contains: Similar to From Field Contains, enter e-mail 
address(es).
	
	If you need more conditions, just add filters. Each filter can have one 
condition.
	
	 For this example, we select From Field Contains.
	
6.	Specify the text in the Contains field.
	
	 See the details in Step 5 for what to enter in the Contains field. 
Continuing this example, type the domain of your work e-mail address. 
For example, if your work e-mail address is myName@XYZCo.com, enter 
XYZCo.com.
	
7.	Select one of the following options:
	
	Forward Messages to Device: Select this radio button, and you can then 
select either or both check boxes below it:
 
• Header Only: You want only the header of the e-mails that meet 
the condition(s) you set in Steps 3, 4, and 5 to be sent to you. (A 
header doesn’t contain the body of the e-mail — just who sent it, 
the subject, and the time it was sent.) Choose this check box if you 
get automated alerts, where receiving only the subject is sufficient.
 
• Level 1 Notification: Level 1 Notification is another way of saying 
urgent e-mail. When you receive a Level 1 e-mail, it appears in bold 
in Messages.
	
	 Do Not Forward Messages to Device: Any e-mail that meets the condi­
tions you set in Steps 3, 4, and 5 aren’t sent to your BlackBerry.

153
 Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
	
8.	Confirm your filter by clicking the Save button.
	
	 You return to the Filter screen, where you can see your newly created 
filter in the list.
	
If you have a hard time setting the criteria for a filter, just make a best guess 
and then check it by having a friend send you a test e-mail. If the test e-mail 
isn’t filtered correctly, set the conditions until you get them right.
Searching through Messages Like a Pro
Searching is a function you probably won’t use every day, but when you run 
a search, you usually need the information fast. Take a few minutes here to 
familiarize yourself with general searching.
The BlackBerry Messages application provides three ways to search through 
your messages. Two of the three ways are specific, and one is a broad search:
	
✓	Search by sender or recipient: Specific. This method assumes that you 
already know the sender or recipient.
	
✓	Search by subject: Specific. This approach assumes that you already 
know the subject.
	
✓	General search: Broad. You don’t have a specific assumption.
	
You can search through anything listed in the messages list. This means that 
you can search through SMS and voice mail as well as e-mail.
Searching by sender or recipient
Search by sender or recipient when you’re looking for a specific message 
from a specific person. For example, suppose that your brother constantly 
sends you e-mail (which means your message list has many entries from 
him). You’re trying to locate a message he sent you approximately two weeks 
ago regarding a fishing-trip location. You scrolled down the message list, but 
you just can’t seem to find that message. Or maybe you want to find a mes­
sage you sent to Sue but can’t lay your hands on it.

154
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
To find a message when you know the sender or recipient, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	In the message list, highlight a message that you sent to or received 
from that particular person.
	
	The choice you get in the next step depends on whether you highlighted 
a sent message or a received message.
	
3.	Press the menu key and then select one of these options:
 
• To search for a message from someone specific: Because that cer­
tain someone sent you the message, choose Search Sender.
 
• To search for a message to someone specific: Because you sent 
that certain someone the message, choose Search Recipient.
	
	 This starts the search. Any results appear onscreen.
Searching by subject
Search by subject when you’re looking for an e-mail titled by a specific sub­
ject that you already know. As is the case when running a search by sender 
or recipient, first scroll to an e-mail that bears the same subject you’re 
searching for. Then follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	In the message list, highlight an e-mail titled by the specific subject 
you’re searching for.
	
3.	Press the menu key and then select Search Subject.
	
	 The search starts, and the results appear onscreen.
Running a general search
A general search is a broad search from which you can perform keyword 
searches of your messages. To run a general search, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	In the message list, press the menu key and then select Search.
	
3.	In the Search screen that appears, fill in your search criteria (see 
Figure 8-9).

155
 Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
	
Figure 8-9: 
The Search 
screen in 
Messages.
	
	
	 The search criteria for a general search follow:
 
• Name: This is the name of the sender or recipient to search by.
 
• In: This is related to the Name criterion. Use this drop-down list to 
indicate where the name may appear, such as in the To or Cc field. 
From the drop-down list, your choices are From, To, Cc, Bcc, and 
any address field.
 
• Subject: This is where you type some or all keywords that appear 
in the subject.
 
• Message: Here, you enter keywords that appear in the message.
 
• Service: If you set up your BlackBerry to receive e-mail from more 
than one e-mail account, you can specify which e-mail account to 
search.
 
• Folder: This is the folder in which you want to perform the search. 
Generally, you should select All Folders.
 
• Show: This drop-down list specifies how the search result will 
appear — namely, whether you want to see only e-mails that you 
sent or e-mails that you received. From the drop-down list, your 
choices are Sent and Received, Received Only, Sent Only, Saved 
Only, Draft Only, and Unopened Only.
 
• Type: This drop-down list specifies the type of message that you’re 
trying to search for: e-mail, SMS, or voice mail. From the drop-
down list, your choices are All, E-mail, E-mail with Attachments, 
PIN, SMS, Phone, and Voice Mail.
	
	From the Search screen shown in Figure 8-9, you can have multiple 
search criteria or just a single one. It’s up to you.

4.	Press the menu key and then select Search to launch your search.
	
	The search results appear onscreen.
	
You can narrow the search results by performing a second search on the ini­
tial results. For example, you can search by sender and then narrow those hits 
(results) by performing a second search by subject.
You can also search by sender or recipient when you’re looking for a specific 
message from a specific person. Scroll to an e-mail that bears the specific 
sender or recipient. Press the menu key and then select Search Sender or 
Search Recipient. If the e-mail that you highlighted is an incoming e-mail, 
you’ll see Search Sender. If the e-mail is outgoing, you’ll see Search Recipient.
Saving search results
If you find yourself searching with the same criteria over and over, you may 
want to save the search and then reuse it. Here’s how:
	
1.	Follow Steps 1–3 in the preceding section for an outgoing e-mail 
search.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
	
	 The Save Search screen appears, from which you can name your search 
and assign it a shortcut key (see Figure 8-10).

Name your 
search, and 
assign it a

3.	In the Title field, enter a name.
	
	 The title is the name of your search, which appears on the Search 
Results screen.

4.	Scroll to the Shortcut Key field, press the trackball or trackpad, and 
select a letter from the drop-down list.
	
	 You can choose among ten letters.
	
5.	Confirm your saved search by pressing the menu key and then select­
ing Save.
Reusing saved searches
Right out of the box, your BlackBerry comes with five saved search results. 
Any new saved result will make your search that much more robust.
Follow these steps to see all saved search results:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	In the message list, press the menu key and then select Search.
	
3.	Press the menu key and then select Recall.
	
	 The recall screen opens, and you can see the five preloaded search 
shortcuts, as well as any searches you saved, as shown in Figure 8-11.
	
Figure 8-11: 
The Recall 
screen, 
showing

To reuse one of the saved search results, simply select a desired search from 
the list, press the menu key, and select Search.

Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
	
If you have multiple e-mail accounts set up, you can set up a search shortcut 
so that you view only one specific account. For example, say you have both 
your personal e-mail and your small-business e-mail accounts set up on your 
BlackBerry. In the Message application, you see e-mails from both, which can 
be overwhelming at times. From the general Search screen (refer to Figure 
8-9), set the Service drop-down list to the one you want, and follow the preced­
ing steps to save the search and assign a shortcut key. The next time you want 
to see only a certain account, you can get to it in an instant!
Follow Up Your E-Mail
With OS 5.0, your can automatically add reminders to any e-mail that you want 
to follow up. This is similar to the follow-up flag in Microsoft Outlook. Why would 
you want to do this on your BlackBerry? If you get a flurry of e-mail in the morn­
ing and read through them before replying, sometimes you’ll forget which ones 
need a response. This is one example where a follow-up flag would help.
To add a follow-up flag:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	Highlight the e-mail in need of a follow up, and press the menu key.
	
3.	Select Flag for Follow Up.
	
	 You see a red flag next to your message.
	
4. 	While the flagged e-mail is still highlighted, press the menu key again.
	
5.	Select Flag Properties.
	
	 You can select the following: 
 
• Request: This is the type of follow up. You can choose from Call, 
Review, Forward, and more.
 
• Color: Yup, you guessed it. This is the color of the flag.
 
• Status: You can choose whether the status is completed or not.
 
• Due: This is the due date for this follow up. When the due date 
arrives, you get a pop-up reminder, similar to a calendar reminder.
Long Live E-Mail
No closet has unlimited space, and your BlackBerry e-mail storage has limits, 
too. You’ve likely pondered how long your e-mails are kept in your BlackBerry. 
(The default is 30 days. Pshew.) You can choose several options: from 15 days 
to forever (well, for as long as your BlackBerry has enough space for them).

159
 Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
	
Because any message you save is kept for as long as you want, a good way to 
make sure that you don’t lose an important message is to save it.
To change how long your e-mails live on your BlackBerry, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Messages application.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Options.
	
3.	Select General Options.
	
4.	Scroll to the Keep Messages option and then press the trackball or 
trackpad.
	
5.	From the drop-down list that appears, choose the time frame that you 
want and then press the trackball or trackpad:
 
• Forever: If you choose Forever, you’ll seldom need to worry 
about your e-mails being automatically deleted. On the downside, 
though, your BlackBerry will eventually run out of memory. At 
that point, you must manually delete some e-mails to free space to 
accept new e-mails.
	
	A good way to archive your e-mail is to back up your e-mails by 
using BlackBerry Desktop Manager. See Chapter 18 for more on 
backing up your BlackBerry on your PC.
 
• Time option: If you choose a time option, any message older than 
that time frame is automatically deleted from your BlackBerry the 
next time you reboot your BlackBerry. However, the message will 
be deleted only on your BlackBerry — even if you turn on e-mail 
reconciliation — because these deletions are only on the device.
	
6.	Confirm your changes by pressing the menu key and then selecting 
Save.

Y
our BlackBerry is primarily a communication tool, with e-mail messages 
and phone conversations as the major drivers. It’s a wonderful technol­
ogy, but sometimes, another means of communication is more appropriate. 
For instance, e-mail isn’t the tool of choice for instant messaging — most 
people would find that method slow and cumbersome. Nor is e-mail the best 
tool to use when you want to alert someone to something.
Your BlackBerry offers some less-obvious ways to communicate — ways 
that may serve as the perfect fit for a special situation. In this chapter, you 
get the scoop on PIN-to-PIN messaging and text messaging (also known as 
Short Messaging Service, or SMS). We also give you tips on how to turn your 
BlackBerry into a lean (and not-so-mean) instant messaging (IM) machine.
Sending and Receiving 
PIN-to-PIN Messages
PIN-to-PIN messaging is based on the technology that underpins two-way 
pager systems. Unlike sending a standard e-mail, when you send a BlackBerry 
PIN-to-PIN message, the message doesn’t venture outside the RIM infrastruc­
ture in search of an e-mail server and (eventually) an e-mail inbox. Instead, 
it stays solidly in the RIM world, where it is shunted through the recipient’s 
network provider until it ends up on the recipient’s BlackBerry.
So when you use PIN-to-PIN messaging, that’s another way of saying sending a 
message from one BlackBerry to another BlackBerry.

162
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
	
PIN stands for personal identification number (familiar to anyone who’s ever 
used an ATM) and refers to a system for uniquely identifying your device.
Here’s the neat part. According to RIM (Research In Motion), the message 
isn’t saved anywhere in this universe except on the one device that sends 
the PIN message and the other device that receives it. Compare that with an 
e-mail, which is saved in at least four separate locations (the mail client and 
e-mail servers of both sender and recipient), not to mention all the system’s 
redundancies and the backups employed by the server. Think of it this way: If 
you whisper a little secret in someone’s ear, only you and that special some­
one know what was said. In a way, PIN-to-PIN messaging is the same thing, 
with one BlackBerry whispering to another BlackBerry. Now, that’s discreet.
If you tend to read the financial newspapers — especially the ones that cover 
corporate lawsuits extensively — you’ll know that there’s no such thing as pri­
vacy in e-mail. PIN-to-PIN messaging, in theory at least, is as good as the old Code 
of Silence. Now, is such privacy really an advantage? You can argue both sides of 
the issue, depending on what you want to use PIN-to-PIN messaging for.
Basically, if you like the idea that your communications can be kept discreet, 
PIN-to-PIN messaging has great curb appeal. If you don’t care about privacy 
issues, you still may be impressed by PIN-to-PIN messaging’s zippy nature. (It 
really is the Ferrari of wireless communication — way faster than e-mail.)
A little bit of RIM history
Sometime during the last millennium, Research 
In Motion (RIM) wasn’t even in the phone busi­
ness. Before BlackBerry became all the rage 
with smartphone features, RIM was doing a tidy 
little business with its wireless e-mail.
Back then, RIM’s primitive wireless e-mail ser­
vice was served by network service providers 
on a radio bandwidth: DataTAC and Mobitex 
networks. These were separate from a typical 
cellphone infrastructure’s bandwidth.
RIM devices at that time already had PIN-to-
PIN messaging. This type of messaging is akin 
to a pager, where a message doesn’t live in a 
mailbox but is sent directly to the BlackBerry 
with no delay. (No one wants a paging system 
that moves at turtle speed when you can get 
one that moves like a jackrabbit, right?)
Several interesting facts followed from RIM’s 
initial decision. Of note, most cellphone users in 
New York City were left without service during 
the 9/11 disaster. The entire cellphone infra­
structure in New York and surrounding areas 
was overwhelmed when faced with too many 
people trying to use the bandwidth available. 
However, one communication device continued 
to work during that stressful time: RIM’s PIN-to-
PIN messaging kept the information flow going.

163
 Chapter 9: Too Cool for E-Mail
	
The Code of Silence in an enterprise environment has always been a thorny 
issue in companies that have strict regulatory requirements. As expected, 
RIM addressed this issue with a new feature in later operating systems allow­
ing BlackBerry Enterprise Server administrators to flip a flag, forcing the 
device to forward all PIN-to-PIN messages to the BlackBerry Enterprise 
Server. A company can also install on the device third-party applications to 
report PIN-to-PIN messages.
Getting a BlackBerry PIN
When you try to call someone on the telephone, you can’t get far without a 
telephone number. As you may expect, the same principle applies to PIN-to-
PIN messaging: no PIN; no PIN-to-PIN messaging.
	
In practical terms, you need the PIN of any BlackBerry to which you want to 
send a PIN message. (You also need to find out your own PIN so that you can 
hand it out to folks who want to PIN-message you.)
The cautious side of you may wonder why on earth you’d give your PIN to 
someone. Here’s the difference: Unlike a PIN for an ATM account, this PIN 
isn’t your password. In fact, this PIN doesn’t give anyone access to your 
BlackBerry or do anything to compromise security. It’s simply an ID; think of 
it like a phone number.
Here are three quick paths to PIN enlightenment:
	
✓	From the Help screen: You can find the PIN for any device right there 
on its Help screen. Open the Help screen by pressing Alt+Num+H.
	
✓	From the Message screen: Send your PIN from the Message screen with 
the help of a keyword. When you type a preset word, your BlackBerry 
replaces what you type with a bit of information specific to your device.
	
	Sound wacky? It’s easier than it sounds:
	
a.	Compose a new message.
	
	If you need a refresher on the whole e-mail message and messaging 
thing, visit Chapter 8.
	
b.	In the subject or body of your message, type mypin and add a 
space.
	
	See the left side of Figure 9-1. As soon as you type the space, 
mypin is miraculously transformed into your PIN in the format 
pin:your-pin-number, as shown on the right side of Figure 9-1. 
Isn’t that neat? Note: Case doesn’t matter here.

164
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
	
	mypin isn’t the only keyword that RIM predefines for you. mynumber 
and myver give you the phone number and OS version, respectively, of 
your BlackBerry Curve.
	
✓	From the Status screen: You can also find your PIN on the Status screen. 
Display the Status screen by choosing the following links in succession, 
starting from the Home screen: Settings, Options, and Status. Use the 
trackball or trackpad to highlight and click each link. Figure 9-2 shows a 
typical Status screen.

word (left) 
and add a

gets trans-
lated (right).

Assigning PINs to names
So you convince your BlackBerry-wielding buddies to go to the trouble of 
finding out their PINs and passing said PINs to you. Now the trick is finding 
a convenient place to store your PINs so that you can use them. Luckily for 

165
 Chapter 9: Too Cool for E-Mail
you, you have an obvious choice: BlackBerry Contacts. And RIM, in its infinite 
wisdom, makes storing such info a snap. To add a PIN to someone’s contact 
info in Contacts, do the following:
	
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
	
	
	 Contacts opens.
	
2.	Highlight a contact name, press the menu key, and then select Edit.
	
	 The Edit Contact screen for the contact name you selected makes an 
appearance.
	
3.	On the Edit Contact screen, scroll down to the PIN field (as shown in 
Figure 9-3).
	
4.	Type the PIN.
	
5.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
	
	The edit you made for this contact is saved.
	
Figure 9-3: 
Add a con-
tact’s PIN 
info here.
	
It’s that simple. Of course, it’s even easier if you think ahead and enter the 
PIN information you have when you set up your initial contact info (by using 
the New Contact screen), but we understand that a PIN isn’t the kind of infor­
mation people carry around.
	
If all this talk about New Contact screens and Edit Contact screens doesn’t 
sound familiar, check out Chapter 4, which covers the Contacts application in 
more detail.

Sending a PIN-to-PIN message
	
PIN-to-PIN just means from one BlackBerry to another.
Sending a PIN-to-PIN message is no different from sending an e-mail. Here’s how:
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
	
2.	In Contacts, highlight a contact name and then press the menu key.
	
	 If a contact has a PIN, you see a menu item titled PIN <contact name>. Say, 
for example, you have a contact named Dante Sarigumba. When you high­
light Dante Sarigumba in the list and then press the menu key, the menu 
item PIN Dante Sarigumba appears as an option, as shown in Figure 9-4.
	
3.	Select PIN <contact name> from the menu.
	
	 You see the ever-familiar New Message screen, with the PIN of your 
buddy already entered as an address.
	
4.	Enter the rest of the text fields — subject, message, and signature 
text — just as you would with an e-mail.
	
Figure 9-4: 
Send a PIN 
message 
via your 
Contacts.
	
Alternatively, if you know the PIN, you can type it directly. Here’s how:
	
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Home screen, select Messages.
	
	
	 The Messages application opens.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Compose PIN.
	
	 The New Message screen makes an appearance.
	
3.	In the To field, enter the PIN and then press the trackball or trackpad.
	
	 You just added a recipient in the To field.
	
4.	Add a subject line, the message, and then the signature text, just like 
you would in an e-mail.

167
 Chapter 9: Too Cool for E-Mail
	
Unlike e-mails, when you send a PIN-to-PIN message, you can tell almost 
instantly whether the recipient got your message. Viewing the Message list, 
you see the letter D — which means delivered — on top of the check mark 
next to the PIN-to-PIN message you sent.
	
Because of the nature of PIN-to-PIN messaging (the conspicuous lack of a 
paper trail, as it were), companies can disable PIN-to-PIN messaging on your 
BlackBerry device. (No paper trail can mean legal problems down the road — 
can you say Sarbanes-Oxley?)
Receiving a PIN-to-PIN message
Receiving a PIN-to-PIN message is no different from receiving a standard 
e-mail. You get the same entry in your Messages list for the PIN-to-PIN mes­
sage, and the same screen appears when you open the message.
By default, your BlackBerry vibrates to alert you, but you can change this 
in Profiles. (Check out Chapter 3 for more details on changing your profile.) 
When you reply to the message, the reply is a PIN-to-PIN message as well.
Keeping in Touch, the SMS/MMS Way
Short Messaging Service (also known as SMS, or text messaging) is so popu­
lar that you’ve probably seen TV shows asking for your feedback via SMS. 
Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is a much later evolution of SMS. 
Rather than sending a simple text message, you can also send someone an 
audio or a video clip.
	
How short is short? The maximum size per message is about 160 characters. If 
you send more than that, it gets broken down into multiple messages.
SMS is an established technology (not a new and unproven thing, in other 
words) that’s been popular for years in Europe and Asia.
	
Text messaging does pose a challenge for beginners. It isn’t tough; it’s just 
cumbersome to type the letters on a small keyboard and keep up with the con­
versation. Also, you need to know the trends and options for text messaging. 
In-the-know folks use abbreviations that may be difficult for you to understand 
in the beginning, so don’t dive in without your oxygen tank.
A quick preparation goes a long way toward avoiding being labeled uncool 
when it comes to your SMS syntax. The upcoming sections help smooth your 
path a bit by filling you in on the basics of SMS-speak.

168
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
Using shorthand for speedy replies
On a regular cellphone, three letters share a single key. Typing even a single 
paragraph can be a real pain.
Human ingenuity prevails. Abbreviations cut down on the amount of text you 
need to enter. Texting (short for text messaging) language is quite fashionable, 
especially among the 14–18-year-old set. Veteran text messagers (the hip 
ones, at least) can easily spot someone who’s new to SMS technology by how 
that person doesn’t use the right lingo — or uses such lingo incorrectly.
AWHFY?
In text messaging, the challenge lies in using abbreviations to craft a sentence 
with as few letters as possible. Because text messaging has been around for 
a number of years, plenty of folks have risen to this challenge by coming up 
with a considerable pool of useful abbreviations. Don’t feel that you have to 
rush out and memorize the whole shorthand dictionary at once, though.
	
As with mastering a new language, start with the most commonly used words 
or sentences. When you become familiar with those, slowly gather in more 
and more terms. In time, the language will be second nature.
Table 9-1 gives you our take on the most common abbreviations, which are 
enough to get you started. With these under your belt, you can at least follow 
the most important parts of an SMS conversation. Feel free to check out the 
Web site associated with this book (www.blackberryfordummies.com) for 
a more comprehensive list of shorthand abbreviations.

Showing some emotion
Written words can get folks into trouble every now and then; the very same 
words can mean different things to different people. A simple example is the 
phrase “You’re clueless.” When you speak such a phrase (with the appropri­
ate facial and hand gestures), your friend knows (you hope) that you’re teas­
ing and that it’s all a bit of fun. Write that same phrase in a text message, and, 
well, you may get a nasty reply in return — which you then have to respond 
to, which prompts another response, and soon enough, you’ve just ended a 
seven-year friendship.

170
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
SMS is akin to chatting, so emoticons show what you mean when you write 
“You’re clueless.” (I’m joking! I’m happy! I’m mad!) These cutesy codes help 
you telegraph your meaning in sledgehammer-to-the-forehead fashion.
We’re talking smileys here — those combinations of keyboard characters 
that, when artfully combined, resemble a human face. The most popular 
example — one that you’ve probably encountered in e-mails from especially 
chirpy individuals — is the happy face, which (usually at the end of a state­
ment) conveys good intentions or happy context, like this :). (Tilt your head 
to the left to see the face.)
Table 9-2 shows you the range of smiley choices. Just remember that smileys 
are supposed to be fun. They could be the one thing you need to make sure 
that your “gently teasing remark” isn’t seen as a hateful comment. Smileys 
help, but if you aren’t sure if what you’re about to send can be misconstrued 
even with the help of the smileys, just don’t send it.

Messaging etiquette and a few words of caution
Here are some commonsense messaging rules 
as well as a few words of caution. Even if you’re 
new to messaging, being a neophyte doesn’t 
give you license to act like a jerk. Play nice and 
take the following pointers to heart:
	✓	Use smileys to avoid misunderstandings. 
Read more about emoticons and smileys 
earlier in this chapter.
	✓	Don’t ever forward chain letters. We mean 
it. Never.
	✓	If you need to forward a message, check 
the entire message content first. Make 
sure nothing offends the recipient.
	✓	Some things in this world need to be said 
face to face, so don’t even think of using 
messaging for it. Ever try dumping your girl­
friend or boyfriend over the phone? Guess 
what? Using messaging is far worse.
	✓	Keep your tone gender neutral. Some mes­
sages that are forwarded through e-mails 
are inappropriate to the opposite sex.
	✓	Capital letters are as rude as shouting, so 
DON’T USE THEM.
	✓	Know your recipient. A newbie might not 
easily grasp smileys and shorthand at 
first, so act accordingly. (Read more about 
shorthand earlier in this chapter.)
	✓	Don’t reply to any message when you’re 
angry. You can’t unsend a sent message. 
It’s better to be prudent than sorry.
	✓	Don’t gossip or be rude. Beware! Your mes­
sages can end up in the wrong hands and 
haunt you in the future.
	✓	Easy does it. No documented evidence 
reveals the deleterious effects (physi­
cal or psychological) of too much tex­
ting. However, don’t text as if you want to 
enter the books as the first recorded case 
of Instantmessagingitis. As your great-
grandma would tell you, too much of any­
thing is bad for you. It’s easy to lose track 
of time when IMing.
	✓	Drive safely. Tuck away your BlackBerry 
whenever you’re in the driver’s seat.

172

Sending a text message
After you have the shorthand stuff and smileys under control, get your fin­
gers pumped up and ready for action: It’s message-sending time! Whether it’s 
SMS or MMS, here’s how to do it:
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Home screen, select Contacts.
	
2.	In Contacts, highlight a contact who has a cellphone number, press 
the menu key, and select SMS (or MMS) <contact name> from the 
menu that appears.
	
	 SMS works only on mobile phones.
	
	 The menu item for SMS or MMS is intelligent enough to display the name 
of the contact. For example, if you choose John Doe, the menu item 
reads SMS John Doe or MMS John Doe, as shown in Figure 9-5.
	
Figure 9-5: 
Start your 
text mes-
sage here.
	
	
3.	If you choose MMS, browse your multimedia folders, and select the 
audio or video file you want to send.
	
	 When choosing MMS, this extra step allows you to choose the multime­
dia file, which is the only difference from composing an SMS message.
	
4.	Type your message.
	
	 Remember that shorthand business? You should start taking advantage 
of it the first chance you get. (Practice makes perfect.)
	
5.	Press the trackball or trackpad and then select Send from the menu 
that appears.
	
	 Your message is sent on its merry way.

Viewing a message you receive
If you have an incoming SMS or MMS message, you get a notification just like 
you do when you receive an e-mail. Also, as with e-mail, the e-mail icon at the 
top of the Home screen indicates a new message. Viewing an SMS or MMS 
message is the same as reading an e-mail. The basic run-through is as follows:
	
1.	Open Messages.
	
2.	Scroll and highlight the unread message.
	
3.	Press the trackball or trackpad.
	
	 Bob’s your uncle: The message appears onscreen.
	
Customize how your BlackBerry notifies you when you receive an SMS mes­
sage. Look for the “Using factory settings” and “Creating your own profile” sec­
tions in Chapter 3 for more details.
Always Online Using Instant Messaging
Real-time (as they happen) conversations with your friends over the Internet 
are easier with IM (instant messaging). IM enables two or more people to 
send and receive messages over the Internet. It all started with pure text mes­
sages and evolved into a rich medium involving voice and even video conver­
sation in real time.
	
IM may not be available on your BlackBerry Curve. Service providers choose 
whether to include it. (Most providers, however, do support it for the 
BlackBerry Curve.) You can add IM to your BlackBerry even if it didn’t come 
with it.
	
1.	Open your browser.
	
2.	Go to http://mobile.blackberry.com.
	
3.	Navigate to IM and Social Networking.
	
	 Here, you’ll find download links for all the free applications for the popu­
lar IM networks and also a download link for BlackBerry Messenger. 
(Chapter 10 covers BlackBerry Messenger.)

Chatting using IM rules
When you’re IMing — that’s right; it’s a verb — you can tell lots of things:
	
✓	When someone’s typing a message to you
	
✓	Whether your buddies are online
	
✓	When your buddies are away from their computers
	
✓	When your buddies are simply too busy to be interrupted at the moment
IM adds a totally different slant on long-distance communication, opening a 
wide array of possibilities — possibilities that can be used for good (team 
collaboration) or ill (mindless gossip), depending on the situation.
As you may expect, IM is great for both personal and business applications. 
Whether you’re maintaining friendships or working to create new ones, IM is 
definitely one powerful tool to consider adding to your social-skills toolbox.
Instant messaging on your BlackBerry
Most network providers dish out the three most popular IM services to their 
BlackBerry customers:
	
✓	Google Talk
	
✓	Yahoo! (Y!) Messenger
	
✓	Windows Live Messenger
Those three IM programs aren’t the only popular ones. Here are a few more:
	
✓	AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)
	
✓	ICQ Instant Messenger
	
✓	iChat AV (on the Macintosh)
	
✓	Jabber (open source)
If you’re using an IM network that isn’t preloaded, you can always check the 
RIM Web site to download the applications: mobile.blackberry.com. On 
this page, go to IM and Social Networking. The list of IM applications should 
be listed on the next page with a link for download.

175
 Chapter 9: Too Cool for E-Mail
IM basics: What you need
Assuming that you have the IM application available on your BlackBerry, you 
need just two things to start using the standard five IM programs:
	
✓	User ID
	
✓	Password
Getting a user ID/password combo is a breeze. Just go to the appropriate 
registration Web page (from the following list) for the IM application(s) you 
want to use. Note that it’s easier and faster to use your desktop or laptop to 
sign up.
	
✓	Google Talk
www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount?service=talk
	
✓	AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)
https://reg.my.screenname.aol.com/_cqr/registration/initRegistration.psp
	
✓	ICQ Instant Messenger
www.icq.com/register
	
✓	Windows Live Messenger
http://messenger.msn.com/download/getstarted.aspx
	
✓	Yahoo! Messenger
http://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_register?.src=pg&.done=http://
messenger.yahoo.com
	
Given the many IM network choices available, your friends are probably 
signed up on a bunch of different networks. You might end up having to sign 
up for multiple networks if you want to reach them all via IM.
Going online with IM
After you obtain the user ID/password combo for one (or more) of the IM 
services, you can use your BlackBerry to start chatting with your buddies by 
following these steps:
	
1.	From the BlackBerry Home screen, select the IM application of your 
choice.
	
	 To illustrate how to do this, we use Google Talk. An application-specific 
logon screen shows up for you to sign on, similar to the one shown in 
Figure 9-6. It’s straightforward, with the standard screen name (also 
called a username or ID) line and password line.

176
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
	
Figure 9-6: 
Logon 
screen for 
Google Talk.
	
	
2.	Enter your screen name/ID and password.
	
3.	(Optional) If you want, select the Remember Password check box. 
Also if you want, select the Automatically Sign Me In check box.
	
	When the Remember Password check box is enabled, the ID/password 
information is pre-entered the next time you come back to this screen. 
(Um, that is, you don’t have to type this stuff every time you want to IM.)
	
	 We recommend that you select this check box to save time but also set 
your handheld password to Enabled so that security isn’t compromised. 
Refer to Chapter 3 if you need a refresher on how to enable passwords 
on your BlackBerry.
	
	 The Automatically Sign Me In check box turns on and off sign-in when 
your BlackBerry Curve is powered up. This is helpful if you have a habit 
of turning off your BlackBerry periodically.
	
4.	Press the trackball or trackpad and then select Sign In.
	
	 At this point, IM tries to log you on. This can take a few seconds, during 
which time the screen reads Sending request to AOL or something 
similar while it’s in this phase. After you’re logged on, a simple listing of 
your contacts, or buddies, appears onscreen.
	
5.	Select the person you’d like to chat with.
	
	 A menu appears, listing various things you can do. Features could differ 
a little bit for each IM application, but for Google Talk, here’s a sample of 
what you can do: Start Chat, Send File, Add a Friend, Rename, Remove, 
and Block.
	
6.	Select the action you’d like.

177
 Chapter 9: Too Cool for E-Mail
Adding a contact/buddy
Before you can start chatting with your buddies, you need to know their user 
IDs (see Table 9-3).
Table 9-3	
How to Obtain Your Friend’s Credentials
Provider
Where You Get Someone’s User ID
AOL Instant 
Messenger
Your friend or by searching AOL’s directory
Google Talk
The text before the @ sign in his or her Google e-mail address
ICQ Instant 
Messenger
Your friend’s e-mail or the ICQ Global Directory
MSN Live 
Messenger
MSN passport ID or Hotmail ID
Yahoo! 
Messenger
The text before the @ sign in his or her Yahoo! e-mail address
Luckily for you, you don’t need to search around for IDs every time you want 
to IM someone. You can store IDs as part of a contacts list. Follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Starting within the IM service of your choice, press the menu key.
	
2.	Select Add a Friend, as shown in Figure 9-7.
	
	 The Add a Friend screen appears.
	
Figure 9-7: 
Adding a 
friend.
	

178
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
	
3.	Enter the user ID of your contact on the Add a Friend screen.
	
4.	Press the trackball or trackpad.
	
	 IM is smart enough to figure out whether this contact has a valid user ID. 
If the ID is valid, the application adds the ID to your list of contacts. The 
buddy goes either to the Online or Offline section of your list, depending 
on whether he or she is logged on. You’ll be warned if the ID you entered 
isn’t valid.
Doing the chat thing
Suppose you want to start a conversation with one of your contacts (a safe 
assumption, we think). When you send a message within the IM application, 
you’re initiating a conversation. Here’s how:
	
1.	Log on to the IM application of your choice.
	
2.	Select the person you want to contact.
	
	 A typical online chat screen shows up. The top portion lists old mes­
sages sent to and received from this contact. You type your message in 
the bottom part of the screen.
	
3.	Type your message.
	
4.	Press the enter key.
	
	 Your user ID and the message you just sent show up in the topmost (his­
tory) section of the chat screen. When you get a message, it’s added to 
the history section so that both sides of your conversation stay in view.
Sending your smile
You can quickly add emoticons to your message (without having to remem­
ber all the character equivalents in Table 9-1). Follow these steps:
	
1.	While you’re typing your message, press the menu key.
	
2.	From the menu that appears, select Show Symbols.
	
	 All the icons appear, as shown in Figure 9-8.
	
3.	Select the emoticon you want.
	
	 The emoticon is added to your message.
Taking control of your IM app
If you use IM frequently — and you tend to chat with many contacts at the 
same time — your BlackBerry’s physical limitations may cramp your IM style. 
No matter whether you use AIM, Y! Messenger, ICQ Instant Messenger, MSN 

179
 Chapter 9: Too Cool for E-Mail
Live Messenger, or BlackBerry Messenger (see Chapter 10), it’s still slower to 
type words on the tiny keypad than it is to type on your PC.
	
Figure 9-8: 
You can 
choose 
among 
many 
smileys.
	
Do you just give up on the dream of IMing on the go? Not necessarily. The fol­
lowing sections show how you can power up your BlackBerry IM technique.
Less is more
If you can’t keep up with all your buddies, your best bet is to limit your 
exposure. Take a whack at your contacts list so that only your true buddies 
remain as contacts whom you want to IM from your BlackBerry. Trimming 
your list is easy. To delete a contact from your IM application, highlight the 
contact from the main screen of the IM application, press the menu key, and 
select Delete.
	
Deleting a contact or buddy from an IM application on your BlackBerry also 
deletes it from the desktop or laptop computer version of the app. That’s 
because the list of contacts is maintained at a central location — an IM server, 
to be precise — and not on your BlackBerry.
	
Set up two accounts of your favorite IM application: one for your BlackBerry 
and one for your desktop PC. By using these accounts separately, you can 
limit the number of contacts you have on your BlackBerry and still maintain a 
full-blown list of contacts on your desktop.
Less typing — use shorthand
Cut down your typing time. Don’t forget the shorthand described earlier in 
this chapter. It’s widely used in IM as well as texting, so refer to Table 9-1 
whenever you can so that you can respond quickly. Before you know it, you 
will have the abbreviations memorized and will be using them with ease. 
Emoticons also make your conversation interesting, so make sure you take 
them out of your toolbox. Refer to Table 9-2 earlier in this chapter for a list of 
the most common ones.

180
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
SMS versus connecting via the Web
	
SMS messages are short messages designed for cellphones. IM is a step up, 
evolving from the Internet, where bandwidth is no longer a concern. It pro­
vides a better real-time conversation experience across distances. These two 
technologies evolved in parallel. As more people use IM, it becomes apparent 
that this technology has a place in handheld devices, where mobility is an 
advantage. Some of the IM programs developed and used in the BlackBerry in 
the past use SMS behind the scenes. And because your BlackBerry can connect 
to the Internet, other programs use the Internet directly. These differences can 
affect your monthly bill as well as your messaging experience. Read on.
	
If you don’t have unlimited SMS but have an unlimited data plan, be careful with 
any third-party IM software. Make sure that it uses the Internet instead of SMS. 
If it uses SMS, you’ll incur charges for every message sent and received, and 
most network providers charge 20 cents for every SMS message, which can 
add up quickly and lead to a nasty surprise on your monthly bill.
Jive on
If you want to make sure that you won’t have 
text-messaging fees for using an IM client, 
check out these IM programs:
	✓	BeejiveIM (www.beejive.com/
download/blackberry.htm): This 
one-time-fee program connects directly 
to the Web instead of using SMS. It works 
with multiple IM networks and multiple 
accounts per network: AIM, Windows Live 
Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, Google 
Talk, ICQ Instant Messenger, Jabber, 
and MySpace IM. This is one of the best 
options. On their Web site, they have ver­
sions to support old BlackBerry devices, 
BlackBerry Storm, and high-resolution 
screens. Download the version for high-
resolution screens.
	✓	Nimbuzz (www.nimbuzz.com): Nimbuzz 
supports many of the popular IM networks. 
It even supports calls using the Skype net­
work. And the best thing is that it’s free and 
doesn’t use SMS.
	✓	IM+ (www.shapeservices.com/
eng/im/blackberry): If you don’t 
want to pay annually, consider this service. 
IM+ asks for a one-time fee and also sup­
ports Yahoo!, MSN, AOL, ICQ, Google Talk, 
and Jabber networks. The best thing about 
IM+ is that it sends messages by using the 
Internet rather than SMS, so it’s best suited 
for people who have the unlimited data 
plan. You have to choose a version: The 
Regular version connects to BlackBerry 
Enterprise Server, which is used by compa­
nies as a way of connecting the BlackBerry 
platform to a corporate network and e-mail 
server. The WAP version allows a personal 
BlackBerry to use the network provider’s 
WAP gateway to connect to the Internet. 
The Shape Services Web site has a com­
prehensive FAQ list for details about the 
software.
Check out the Web site associated with this 
book (www.blackberryfordummies.
com) for updates regarding these (and other) 
recommendations.

I
n Chapter 9, you find a slew of ways to send messages on your BlackBerry 
Curve. In this chapter, you get the scoop on another way to send mes­
sages, using a special application known and loved by BlackBerry.
RIM has entered the IM (instant messaging) horse race in the form of a spir­
ited filly named (you guessed it) BlackBerry Messenger. This application is 
based on the PIN-to-PIN messaging technology (refer to Chapter 9), which 
means that it is mucho fast and quite reliable.
	
However, with BlackBerry Messenger, you can chat with only those buddies who 
have a BlackBerry and also have PIN-to-PIN messaging enabled. The application 
supports IM features common to many other applications, such as group chat­
ting and the capability to monitor the availability of other IM buddies.
Using BlackBerry Messenger
You can access BlackBerry Messenger in the Applications folder from the 
Home screen, as shown in Figure 10-1. The first time you run BlackBerry 
Messenger, a welcome screen asks you to enter your display name. This 
display name is the one you want other people to see on their BlackBerry 
Messenger when you send them a message.

You see a contacts list the next time you open the application, as shown on the 
left in Figure 10-2. (Okay, the picture here displays some contacts, but your list 
should be empty; we’ll show you how to populate the list in a minute.)
	
Figure 10-2:

(left) and 
menu (right).
	
Pressing the menu key lets you do the following, as shown on the right side 
of Figure 10-2:
	
✓	Broadcast Message: Send a message to multiple contacts in your 
BlackBerry Messenger. The messages appear as conversations in the 
recipients’ BlackBerry Messenger.
	
✓	Open Chat: Initiate a conversation with the currently highlighted 
contact.
	
✓	Start Group Chat: Initiate a group conversation. See the later section 
“Starting a group conversation” for details.
	
✓	Add Contact: Add a new contact to BlackBerry Messenger (see the next 
section).
	
✓	Add Group: Create custom groupings for your contacts.

183
 Chapter 10: Instant Messaging on BlackBerry Messenger
	
	This option is helpful if you have a lot of contacts in BlackBerry 
Messenger. Simply select this menu item, and an Add Group screen 
appears so you can enter a group name.
	
✓	Contact Info: When selected, display a screen showing the information 
of the currently highlighted contact.
	
✓	Delete Contact: Allows you to delete the currently highlighted contact.
The menu has more items. Although these items are not shown on the right 
side of Figure 10-2, scroll down the menu screen to see the following:
	
✓	Edit My Info: Customize your personal information and control how you 
want others to see you from their BlackBerry Messenger Contacts list. 
You can do the following (see Figure 10-3):
 
• Change your picture
 
• Change your display name
 
• Allow others to see the title of the song you’re currently listening to
 
• Allow others to see that you’re currently using the phone
 
• Enter a personal message that others could see
 
• Set your time zone
 
• Allow others to see your country and time zone information
	
✓	Back Up Contacts List: Save your list of BlackBerry Messenger contacts 
to the file system. The location defaults to the media card, but the 
screen that follows after you select this option allows you to select a dif­
ferent folder and enter a different name for the backup file.
	
✓	Restore Contacts List: Restore your list of BlackBerry Messenger con­
tacts from the file you created from the Back Up Contacts List option.
	
✓	Delete Backup Files: Delete a backup file. If you have multiple backups, 
this option allows you to choose which file to delete.
	
✓	Options: Customize the behavior of your BlackBerry Messenger.

Adding a contact
With no one in your contacts list, BlackBerry Messenger is a pretty useless 
item. Your first order of business is to add a contact to your list — someone 
you know who
	
✓	Has a BlackBerry
	
✓	Is entered in your Contacts
	
✓	Has PIN-to-PIN messaging enabled
	
✓	Has a copy of BlackBerry Messenger installed on his or her device
If you know someone who fits these criteria, you can add that person to your 
list by doing the following:
	
1.	In BlackBerry Messenger, press the menu key.
	
2.	Select Add a Contact.
	
	 The Add Contact screen appears, listing actions related to adding a con­
tact, as shown on the left side of Figure 10-4. The top two options in the 
list are ways to add a contact in BlackBerry Messenger.
	
Figure 10-4:

contact 
(left) and an 
invitation 
barcode 
(right).
	
	
3. 	If you want to scan your friend’s BlackBerry barcode:
	
a.	On the same screen (Figure 10-4, left), but using your friend’s 
BlackBerry, select the third option, which says Show Your 
Invitation Barcode to Another BlackBerry.
	
	A barcode image similar to Figure 10-4, right, appears on your 
friend’s BlackBerry.

185
 Chapter 10: Instant Messaging on BlackBerry Messenger
	
b.	On your BlackBerry Curve, select the second option, Scan 
Invitation Barcode from Another BlackBerry.
	
	A Camera application appears to allow you to capture the barcode. 
Once captured, the contact information is immediately added to 
your BlackBerry Messenger contacts list.
	
	 That’s it. You’re finished. The following steps show how to enter your 
contact directly from the Add Contact screen.
	
4.	If instead you want to enter your contact directly:
	
a.	On the Add Contact screen, select the first option, Add a Contact 
by Entering Their Email Address or PIN.
	
b.	Start typing the name of the contact, and when a list of possible 
contacts appears, select the name you want to add.
	
c.	Type your message.
	
	A default message is provided, as you can see in Figure 10-5, but 
you can edit this message. This is the message that the contact will 
receive after you’re finished with Step d.
	
d.	Select OK and then select OK again in the screen that follows.
	
	The application sends your request. As long as the person hasn’t 
responded to your request, his or her name appears as part of the 
Pending group, as shown in Figure 10-6. When your contact responds 
positively to your request, that name goes to the official contacts list.

You can easily start a conversation with any of your contacts. Follow these 
steps:
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Messenger main menu, select the name in your 
contacts list.
	
	 A traditional chat interface opens, with a list of old messages at the top 
and a text box for typing messages at the bottom.
	
2.	Type your message.
	
3.	Press the enter key.
	
	 Any messages you send (as well as any responses you get) are appended 
to the history list at the top.
Starting a group conversation
You can easily invite others to your BlackBerry Messenger conversation. 
Follow these steps:
	
1.	During a conversation, press the menu key.
	
	 The BlackBerry Messenger main menu appears. This time, an Invite 
option has been added.
	
2.	Select Invite to Group Chat.
	
	 The Select Contacts screen opens, listing your BlackBerry Messenger 
contacts who are currently available (see Figure 10-7). For each contact, 
you can select the check box to indicate that you want to invite that 
person to the chat.

187
 Chapter 10: Instant Messaging on BlackBerry Messenger
	
3.	Select people by selecting the corresponding check boxes.
	
	 You can choose any number of people.
	
4.	Select OK.
	
	 You’re back to the preceding conversation screen, but this time, the his­
tory list shows the contacts you added to the conversation. The newly 
selected contact(s) can now join the conversation.
	
Figure 10-7: 
See your 
available

You can set a subject for your message. This is especially useful for group 
conversations. To add a subject to a conversation, follow these simple steps:
	
1.	Press the menu key while you’re on the conversation screen and then 
select Set Subject.
	
	 On the screen that follows, the cursor is in the subject line, waiting for 
you to enter a subject (see Figure 10-8).
	
2.	On the screen that follows, enter the subject and then select OK.
	
	 The conversation screen is updated with the subject.
	
You can make your name appear snazzy by adding symbols, such as DanteJ 
and Yosma (see Figure 10-9):
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Messenger screen, press the menu key.
	
2.	Select Edit My Info.
	
3.	Press the menu key, and select Add Smiley to choose the symbol you 
want.

Sending a file
BlackBerry Messenger, like any other IM application, can send files. While on 
a conversation, just press the menu key, and you’ll see several menu items 
allowing you to share a file:
	
✓	Send Picture: Selecting this option shows a screen similar to the left 
side of Figure 10-10, where you can either launch the Camera applica­
tion to take a picture to send or select the picture file you want to send 
(you can navigate to a specific folder if necessary). The default location 
for picture files is the Media Card pictures folder. Just select Camera to 
launch the Camera application.
	
✓	Send Voice Note: Selecting this option gives you the Voice Note screen 
(refer to Figure 10-10, right), where you can record the voice message 
you want to send. When you’re ready to record, follow these steps:

189
 Chapter 10: Instant Messaging on BlackBerry Messenger
	
a.	Select Start.
	
	Curve is ready to record your voice message. A screen indicating 
recording appears with a Stop button, as shown on the left side of 
Figure 10-11.
	
b.	When you have finished speaking your message, select Stop.
	
	A screen similar to the right side of Figure 10-11 appears. You can 
play the message to review what you said, send the message if 
you’re satisfied, or cancel sending a voice note.
	
c.	Select Send.
	
	A prompt asks you to add a description of your voice message. 
Selecting No sends the message right away.
	
d.	Select Yes.
	
e.	Enter a description and then select OK.
	
	A request to transfer the file is sent, and your friend needs to accept 
it in his or her BlackBerry Messenger for the transmission to begin.
	
✓	Send File: Displays a screen that lists which file types you can send. 
Aside from giving you a different way of sending picture and voice mes­
sage, the screen lists the following options:
 
• File: Sends any type of file. When selected, it shows an Explorer-
type screen so you can navigate to the file you want to send. The 
default folders shown are Media Card and Device Memory.
 
• BlackBerry Contact: Sends a vCard (see Chapter 4 for details on 
the vCard). When selected, it displays Contacts, allowing you to 
select the contact you want to send.
 
• Messenger Contact: Lets you choose a contact from your list of 
BlackBerry Messenger contacts and send the info as a file.

Saving the conversation history
While you are on the conversation screen, you can save your chat history in 
two ways. Both methods are accessible by a simple press of the menu key:
	
✓	Copy History: Copies the existing chat history to the Clipboard. Then 
you paste it into the application where you want it saved, such as 
Calendar or MemoPad.
	
✓	Email History: Displays the Compose Message dialog screen, shown 
in Figure 10-12, with the Subject field prepopulated with Chat with 
<Contact> on <Date> and the body of the message prepopulated 
with the chat history.

Broadcasting a Message
Do you feel the need to start a conversation on the same subject with several 
people? You can start with a group chat, but what if you want to get a per­
sonal opinion from each individual, something that each person isn’t com­
fortable saying in front of the crowd? The best way to do this is to broadcast 
a message to multiple recipients:

191
 Chapter 10: Instant Messaging on BlackBerry Messenger
	
1.	On the BlackBerry Messenger screen, press the menu key.
	
2.	Select Broadcast Message.

t’s hard to believe that about 15 years ago, more folks didn’t have access 
to the Internet than did. Today, you can surf the Web anytime and any­
where from a desktop computer, a netbook, or even a tiny mobile device 
such as a PDA or a smartphone. Having said that, it should be no surprise 
that your BlackBerry Curve has a Web browser of its own.
In this chapter, we show you how to use BlackBerry Browser. We give you 
shortcuts and timesaving tips, including the coolest ways to make pages load 
faster, as well as a complete neat-freak’s guide to managing your bookmarks.
And because your network service provider may also have its own custom 
browser for you to use, we compare these proprietary browsers with the 
default BlackBerry Browser so you can decide which best suits your needs.
Kicking Up Browser
BlackBerry Browser comes loaded on your smartphone and accesses 
the Web with a cellphone connection. Browser can be named differently, 
depending on how the service provider customizes it. Sometimes it’s named 
BlackBerry Browser; Internet Browser; Hotspot Browser; or, most likely, just 
Browser. We just use Browser to make things easier.

194
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
Browser has multiple personalities:
	
✓	One that’s connected to your company’s BlackBerry Enterprise Server
	
	BlackBerry Enterprise Server is a software application from RIM 
(Research In Motion) that companies can use to control and manage 
BlackBerry devices. The software also allows your device to see your 
company’s network and connect to your company’s databases.
	
	If you’re a corporate BlackBerry user, your company administrator 
may turn off or not install all browsers except for the one that connects 
through the company’s BlackBerry Enterprise Server.
	
✓	One that goes directly to your service provider’s network
	
	This might be called by the network service provider’s brand name.
	
✓	A browser that uses a Wi-Fi connection
	
✓	A WAP browser
	
	Wireless application protocol, or WAP, was popular in the 1990s, when 
mobile device displays were limited and could display only five or six 
rows of text. WAP lost its appeal with the advent of high-resolution 
screens.
The following sections get you started using Browser. After you get your feet 
wet, we promise that you’ll be champing at the bit to find out more!
Getting to Browser
Browser is one of the main applications of your device, with its Globe icon 
visible right on the Home screen, as shown in Figure 11-1. In most cases, you 
open Browser by scrolling to this icon and then pressing the trackball or 
trackpad.
	
Figure 11-1: 
You can 
open 
Browser 
from the 
Home 
screen.
	

195
 Chapter 11: Surfing the Internet Wave
Opening Browser by clicking its icon on the Home screen gives you a list of 
bookmarks.
If you haven’t yet added bookmarks, the opening Browser screen looks like 
Figure 11-2. You find out more about adding bookmarks later in this chapter.
	
Figure 11-2: 
Browser 
with the 
default 
empty 
Bookmarks 
screen.
	
	
If Browser is your default browser, you can access it from any application 
that distinguishes a Web address. For example, from Contacts, you can open 
Browser by opening the link on the Web Page field. If you get an e-mail that 
contains a Web address, just scroll to that link. The link is highlighted, and 
you can open the page by pressing the trackball or trackpad.
	
When you access Browser from another application, you don’t have to close 
that application to jump to Browser. Just press the Alt key (to the left of the Z 
key) and the escape key at the same time to open a pop-up screen with appli­
cation icons. Use your trackball or trackpad to highlight the Browser icon; 
then press the trackball or trackpad to launch Browser.
By default, accessing Browser by clicking a Web address or a Web link within 
another application opens the Web page associated with that address. (In 
Figure 11-3, we’re opening Browser from the Messages application.)
Hitting the (air)waves
After you locate Browser, you’re ready to surf the Web. Here’s how:
	
1.	Open Browser.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Go To.
	
3.	Type a Web address, as shown in Figure 11-4.

196
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
	
4.	Select OK.
	
	 While the page is loading, progress is indicated at the bottom of the 
screen.
Unless you change its configuration (see Start Page in the “Configuring 
Browser” section, later in this chapter), BlackBerry displays your bookmarks 
when you open Browser. And if you already have bookmarks, just select the 
bookmark. For the lowdown on adding bookmarks, see the upcoming section 
“Bookmarking Your Favorite Sites.”
	
When you see a phone number or an e-mail address on a Web page, you can 
scroll to that information to highlight it. Then press the trackball or trackpad 
to initiate a phone call or open a new e-mail message (depending on which 
type of link you highlighted).

 Chapter 11: Surfing the Internet Wave
Navigating Web pages
Using Browser to navigate to a Web page is easy. Note that hyperlinks are 
highlighted onscreen. To jump to a particular hyperlink, scroll to the high­
lighted link and press the trackball or trackpad.
Here are a few shortcuts you can use while navigating a Web page:
	
✓	Move up and down one full display page at a time. Press 9 (down 
arrow) or 3 (up arrow).
	
✓	Switch between full-screen mode and normal mode. Press the exclamation-
point (!) key. In full-screen mode, the BlackBerry doesn’t show anything 
extra (for example, the signal level) on the top portion of the display 
screen. Normal mode is the default.
	
✓	Stop loading a page. Press the escape key.
	
✓	Go back to the previous page (if there is one). Press the escape key.
And don’t forget the Browser menu (press the menu key). It has some useful 
shortcuts, as shown in Figure 11-5.
Here are the Browser menu options:
	
✓	Help: Like the rest of BlackBerry applications, Help is always available in 
the menu screen to display a quick guide.
	
✓	Column View: The default view; it appears only if you are in Page view. 
With this view, the Web page is displayed vertically, meaning that a wide 
Web page wraps down, and you can use the trackball or trackpad to 
scroll up and down the page.
	
Figure 11-5: 
The 
Browser 
menu has 
lots of good 
stuff.
	

198
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
	
✓	Page View: Appears only if you are in Column view. (See the preceding 
bullet.) With this view, you see the page as you typically would in a PC’s 
Internet browser. The compressed version of the Web page takes up the 
entire screen first.
	
✓	Zoom In/Out: Zooms in and out.
	
✓	Find: Locates and highlights text within the current page. Like any other 
basic Find tool, this option displays a prompt to enter the text you want 
to find. After the initial search, a Find Next menu appears for finding the 
next matching text.
	
✓	Select: Appears only if the trackball or trackpad pointer is placed on 
text. Use this feature to highlight text onscreen for copying.
	
✓	Stop: Appears only if you’re in the middle of requesting a page. Use Stop 
to cancel such a request. This is the same as pressing the escape key.
	
✓	Copy: Appears if you have highlighted text. Selecting Copy copies the 
highlighted text into memory so that you can use it later for pasting 
somewhere else, such as in MemoPad.
	
✓	Full Image: Appears only if you highlight an image and only a portion of 
the image is displayed onscreen.
	
✓	Save Image: Appears only if you highlight an image, allowing you to save 
the image in the Curve’s built-in memory or to an SD card.
	
✓	Home: The shortcut to your Home page. The default Home page can vary 
from carrier to carrier, but to change it, open the Browser menu, choose 
Options➪Browser Configuration, and change the Home Page Address field.
	
✓	Get Link: Appears only if you have a highlighted link. Choosing this 
menu item opens that page of the link.
	
	The faster way to open a link is to press Enter.
	
✓	Go To: Opens a Web page when you enter a Web address and press the 
trackball or trackpad. As you enter more addresses, they are listed in 
the History portion of the screen so you don’t have to retype them. To 
find out how to clear this list, see the “Cache operations” section, later 
in this chapter.
	
✓	Back: This menu item appears only if you have navigated to more than one 
Web page. The Back option goes back to the preceding page you viewed.
	
	You can achieve the same function by pressing the escape key.
	
✓	Forward: This menu item appears only if you have gone back at least 
one Web page. The Forward option progresses one page at a time.
	
✓	Recent Pages: Jumps to any of those Web pages when you highlight the his­
tory page and press the enter key twice. Browser can track up to 20 pages 
of Web addresses you’ve visited, which you can view on the History screen.
	
✓	History: Displays a list of the Web pages you’ve visited and allows you 
to jump back quickly to those pages. The list is grouped by date.

199
 Chapter 11: Surfing the Internet Wave
	
✓	Refresh: Updates the current page. This is helpful when you’re viewing a 
page with data that changes frequently (such as stock quotes).
	
✓	Set Encoding: Specifies the encoding used in viewing a Web page. This 
is useful when viewing foreign languages that use different characters. 
Most BlackBerry users don’t have to deal with this and probably don’t 
know what type of encoding a particular language could display.
When you try to open a Web page, indicators that show the progress of your 
request appear at the bottom of the screen. Figure 11-6 (left) shows Browser 
requesting a page. Figure 11-6 (right) shows that you’ve reached the page and 
the page is still loading.
	
Figure 11-6: 
Requesting 
a page (left) 
and then 
loading 
it (right).
	
The icons in the top-right corner of both screens in Figure 11-6 are (from 
right to left)
	
✓	Your connection type appears in the rightmost portion. In Figure 11-6, 
WiFi means that the connection is using a Wi-Fi network.
	
	If you’re not connected to Wi-Fi, an icon with vertical bars and an antenna 
appears to the right of the connection type, showing the strength of the 
network signals (the same signal indicators for phone and e-mail).
	
✓	The lock icon indicates whether you’re at a secure Web page. Figure 11-6 
shows a nonsecure page. Whether a page is secure depends on the Web 
site you’re visiting. If you’re accessing your bank, you most likely see the 
secured icon (a closed lock). On the other hand, most pages don’t need to 
be secure, so you see the unsecured icon (an open lock).
	
✓	The connection information icon to the left of the lock is a way for 
you to know the amount of Web page data transferred between your 
BlackBerry Curve and the network provider. In Browser, you should see 
a trackball or trackpad pointer in the screen, which is similar to a PC 
mouse pointer. Scroll the trackball or trackpad until the pointer hovers 
in the connection information icon; then press the trackball or trackpad. 
The next screen displays the connection information.

200
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
	
If you lose patience waiting for a page to load and want to browse somewhere 
else, press the escape key to stop the page from loading.
Saving a Web page address
Entering a Web address to view a page can get tedious. Fortunately, you can 
return to a page without typing the same address. While you’re viewing a 
Web page, simply use the Browser menu (shown in Figure 11-7) to save that 
page’s address.
	
Figure 11-7: 
Use the 
Browser 
menu to 
save a 
Web page 
address.
	
You can save a Web page address in several ways:
	
✓	Page Address: This option allows you to view the Web address of the cur­
rent page through a pop-up screen, which presents you with two options:
 
• Copy Address saves the page’s address to your BlackBerry 
Clipboard and allows you to paste it somewhere else.
 
• Send Address is the same Send Address you see in the Browser 
menu (as described in the next item).
	
✓	Send Address: Presents another screen so that you can choose whether 
to send the address by e-mail (Chapter 8), MMS (Chapter 9), PIN 
(Chapter 9), SMS (Chapter 9), or Messenger Contact (Chapter 10).
	
✓	Save Page: Use this option to save the Web address of the current page 
to Messages. A message appears with the Browser globe icon to indicate 
that it’s a Web link, as shown in Figure 11-8. Highlighting that entry and 
pressing the trackball or trackpad launches Browser and opens the page 
for your viewing pleasure.

201
 Chapter 11: Surfing the Internet Wave
	
	Saving a page to your message list has a different purpose from book­
marking a page. The saved page initially shows as unread in Messages, 
to remind you to check back later.
	
Figure 11-8: 
Save a Web 
page link in 
Messages.
	
Note: When you don’t have network coverage, and you try to access a Web page, 
you’re prompted to save your request. When you do, your request is automati­
cally saved in the message list. When you do have coverage later, you can open 
the same Web page from the message list, with the content loaded already!
	
If you press a letter key while a menu is displayed, you select the first menu 
item that starts with that letter. Pressing the same letter again selects the next 
menu item that starts with that letter.
Sending an address by e-mail
You can send a Web address to any recipient via e-mail by using the Page 
Address option in the Browser menu. For a more direct way, simply select 
Send Address from the Browser menu while the Web page is displayed. If you 
know right away that you’ll need to send an address to someone, save a few 
clicks and use the more direct method.
Saving Web images
You can save images in JPEG, PNG, GIF, and BMP formats from a Web page. 
Any saved image is kept in the Pictures application, which enables you to 
view it later. To save an image, just click the image and then select Save 
Image from the menu that appears.

Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
Bookmarking Your Favorite Sites
You don’t have to memorize all the addresses of your favorite sites. Instead, 
use BlackBerry Browser to keep a list of sites you want to revisit. In other 
words, make a bookmark so that you can come back to a site quickly.
Adding and visiting a bookmark
Add a new bookmark this way:
	
	
1.	Open Browser, and go to the Web page you want to bookmark.
	
	
2.	Select Add Bookmark from the Browser menu.
	
	 The menu is always accessible by pressing the menu key.
	
3.	(Optional) In the Add Bookmark dialog box, change the bookmark 
name.
	
	 The name of the bookmark defaults to the Web site title and, in most 
cases, is appropriate to use as the name. You always have the option to 
change this name; refer to the next section, “Modifying a bookmark.”
	
4.	In the Add Bookmark dialog box, navigate to the folder where you 
want to save the bookmark.
	
	 The dialog box is shown in Figure 11-9. The default bookmark save folder 
is BlackBerry Bookmarks, but you can save the bookmark in any folder 
you create. To see how to create a bookmark folder, skip to the section 
“Adding a bookmark subfolder.”
	
5.	Scroll to the bottom of the dialog box, and Select Add.
No place like Home
Changing your Home screen background is 
a neat trick. You can use an image you have 
saved in your Pictures list as the background 
on your Home screen. Here’s how:
	 1.	 From the Home screen, select the Media 
icon and then select Pictures.
	
	 The Pictures application opens.
	 2.	 Scroll to and select the image you want to 
set as your background.
	 3.	 Press the menu key and then select Set as 
Home Screen Image.

203
 Chapter 11: Surfing the Internet Wave
	
Figure 11-9: 
Name the 
bookmark, 
and specify 
where to 
store it.
	
Here’s how to go to a bookmarked page:
	
1.	In Browser, select Bookmarks from the Browser menu.
	
	 You’re taken to the Bookmarks screen. From here, you can find all the 
pages you’ve bookmarked.
	
2.	Select the bookmark for the page you want to visit.
Modifying a bookmark
You have the option of changing the attributes of existing bookmarks. Why 
change them? Say you bookmarked a few pages from the same Web site, but 
the author of the Web pages didn’t bother to have a unique title for each 
page. While happily bookmarking pages, you didn’t bother to change the 
names of the bookmarks that default to the Web page title. Now you end up 
with several bookmarks with the same name. But changing a bookmark is a 
snap. Follow these steps:
Available offline
In the Add Bookmark dialog box is the Available 
Offline check box. When that check box is 
selected, you not only save a page as a book­
mark, but also cache it so you can see it even 
when you’re out of range (such as when you’re 
stuck deep in a mountain cave). The next time 
you click the bookmark, that page comes up 
very fast. We recommend making bookmarks 
available offline for pages that don’t change 
from day to day, such as search engines (for 
example, Google).

204
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
	
1.	Select Bookmarks from the Browser menu.
	
2.	From the Bookmarks screen, highlight the name of the bookmark you 
want to modify, press the menu key, and then select Edit Bookmark.
	
3.	On the screen that follows, edit the existing name, the address the 
bookmark is pointing to, or both.
	
4.	Select Accept to save your changes.
Organizing your bookmarks
Over time, the number of your bookmarks will grow. And trying to find a cer­
tain site on a tiny screen can be tough. A handy work-around is to organize 
your bookmarks with folders. For example, you can group related sites in a 
folder, and each folder can have one or more other folders inside it (subfold­
ers). Having a folder hierarchy narrows your search and allows you to easily 
find a site.
For example, your sites might fall into these categories:
	
✓	Reference
	
	NY Times
	
	Yahoo!
	
✓	Fun
	
	Flickr
	
	The Onion
	
✓	Shopping
	
	Etsy
	
	Gaiam
Adding a bookmark subfolder
You can add subfolders only to folders that are already listed on the 
Bookmarks page. That is, you can’t create your own root folder. Your choices 
for adding your first subfolder are under WAP Bookmarks or BlackBerry 
Bookmarks.
Suppose you want to add a Reference subfolder within your BlackBerry 
Bookmarks folder. Here are the quick and easy steps:
	
1.	On the Bookmarks screen, highlight BlackBerry Bookmarks.
	
	 The BlackBerry Bookmarks folder is the parent of the new subfolder. In 
this case, the BlackBerry Bookmarks folder will contain the Reference 
subfolder.

205
 Chapter 11: Surfing the Internet Wave
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Add Subfolder, as shown in Figure 11-10.
	
	 You see a dialog box where you can enter the name of the folder. 
(We’re using Reference.)
	
Figure 11-10: 
Add a folder 
here.
	
	
3.	Type the folder name, and select OK.
	
	 The Reference folder now appears on the Bookmarks screen (as shown 
in Figure 11-11), bearing a folder icon.
	
Figure 11-11: 
The 
Bookmarks 
screen with 
a new 
subfolder.
	
Renaming a bookmark folder
Although you can’t rename the root bookmark folders, such as BlackBerry 
Bookmarks and WAP Bookmarks, the folders you create under them are fair 
game. Renaming a bookmark folder that you created is as easy as editing a 
bookmark. Follow these steps:
	
1.	On the Bookmarks screen, highlight the name of the folder you want 
to change.

206
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Rename Folder.
	
3.	Type the name of the folder.
	
4.	Select OK to save your changes.
Moving a bookmark
If you keep going astray looking for a bookmark that you think exists in a par­
ticular folder but is instead in another, move that bookmark where it belongs. 
Follow these steps:
	
1.	Highlight the bookmark, press the menu key, and then select Move 
Bookmark.
	
2.	Use the trackball or trackpad to move the bookmark to the location in 
the list where you want it to appear.
	
3.	After you find the right location, press the trackball or trackpad.
	
	 Your bookmark is in its new home.
Cleaning up your bookmarks
Maybe you really like a site but eventually stop visiting it. Or maybe a site 
disappears, and every time you click the bookmark, you get a 404 Not Found 
error. Time for a little spring cleaning. From the Bookmarks screen, highlight 
the name of the bookmark you want to delete. Press the menu key and then 
select Delete Bookmark. It’s just that easy.
	
You can — repeat, can — clean up bookmarks wholesale by deleting a folder. 
A word to the wise, though: All contents of that folder will be deleted, so purge 
with caution.
Exercising Options and Optimization 
Techniques
Sure, Browser works out of the box, but folks have their own tastes, right? 
Look to Browser Options for attributes and features you can customize.
Press the menu key and then select Options. The Browser Options screen 
that opens offers three main categories to choose among, as shown in 
Figure 11-12:
	
✓	Browser Configuration: A place to toggle Browser features
	
✓	General Properties: Settings for the general look and feel of Browser
	
✓	Cache Operations: Options for clearing file caches used by Browser

207
 Chapter 11: Surfing the Internet Wave
If you feel speed-greedy after adjusting the options, see the sidebar 
“Speeding up browsing,” later in this chapter.

Configuring Browser
You can define browser-specific settings from the Browser Configuration 
screen, which you access from the Browser Options screen. The 
customization items you can amend (shown in Figure 11-13) are as 
follows:
	
✓	Support JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language used heavily to 
make dynamic Web pages. A Web page might not behave normally when 
this option is turned off. This option is off by default.
	
Figure 11-13: 
The 
Browser 
Configu­
ration 
screen.
	

208
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
	
✓	Allow JavaScript Popups: Most ad pages are launched as JavaScript 
pop-ups, so having this check box selected minimizes these ads. 
Be aware, though, that some important pages are also displayed as 
JavaScript pop-ups.
	
	Note: This option appears only if you select the Support JavaScript 
check box.
	
✓	Prompt to Enable JavaScript: This option appears and comes into 
play only if you haven’t selected Support JavaScript. The default value 
for this option is selected (if you browse a page that has JavaScript, 
Browser will prompt you to either enable JavaScript or not).
	
✓	Terminate Slow Running Scripts: Sometimes you find Web pages 
with scripts that aren’t written well. Leave this option selected to 
keep Browser from hanging. This option appears only if you select the 
Support JavaScript check box.
	
✓	Show Images: This option controls the display of images depending on 
the content mode of WML, HTML, or both. Think of WML pages as Web 
pages made just for mobile devices, such as the BlackBerry. We recom­
mend leaving this option selected for both WML and HTML.
	
	Turn on and off the display of image placeholders if you opt to not 
display images.
	
✓	Use Background Images: A Web page background image can make 
the page look pleasing, but if the image is big, it could take time to 
download it.
	
✓	Support Embedded Media: Select this option to support media such as 
SVG (scalable vector graphics). Think of SVG as Adobe Flash for mobile 
devices such as the BlackBerry Curve. SVG can be a still image or an ani­
mated one.
	
✓	Browser Identification: This option specifies which browser type your 
browser emulates. The default is BlackBerry, but Browser can also emu­
late Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.
	
	Keep the default BlackBerry mode. We don’t see much difference in any 
of them.
	
✓	Start Page: Use this to specify a starting page to load when you open 
Browser.
	
✓	Home Page Address: Use this to set your home page. Note that the 
Home page is always available from the Browser menu.
General Browser properties
The General Properties screen is similar to the Browser Configuration screen 
(see the preceding section) in that you can customize some Browser behav­
iors. General Properties, however, is geared more toward the features of the 

209
 Chapter 11: Surfing the Internet Wave
Browser content. As shown in Figure 11-14, you can configure features and 
also turn features off or on.
	
Figure 11-14: 
The General 
Properties 
screen.
	
From this screen, use the Space key to change the value of a field. You can 
configure the following features:
	
✓	Default Browser: If you have multiple browsers available, use this to 
specify which one you want to use when opening a Web link.
	
✓	Default Font Family: When a Web page doesn’t specify the text font, 
Browser will use the one you selected here.
	
✓	Default Font Size: When a Web page doesn’t specify the text font size, 
Browser uses the one you selected here. The smaller the size, the more 
text can fit onscreen.
	
✓	Minimum Font Size: A Web page might specify a font size too small to 
be legible. Specifying a legible font size will override the Web page.
	
✓	Minimum Font Style: When Browser is using the minimum font size, 
you can choose what font to use. Some fonts are more legible, even in a 
small size, than others. If you aren’t sure which one to use, leave this set 
to the default.
	
✓	Default View: You can toggle the default view:
 
• Column: Wraps all Web page elements vertically, so you just scroll 
up and down by panning the page.
 
• Page: Displays the page as you normally see it in your PC’s Internet 
browser. Pan the page to scroll left, right, up, and down.
	
✓	Image Quality: The higher the quality, the slower the page loads. You 
have three options: low, medium (the default), and high.
	
✓	Repeat Animations: Sets the number of times an animation repeats. This 
pertains to animated images that most banner ads use. Your choices 

210
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
are Never, Once, 10 Times, 100 Times (the default), and As Many as the 
Image Specifies.
	
✓	Enable JavaScript Location Support: Web pages that have scripts that 
take advantage of your BlackBerry’s location through GPS will work if 
you have this selected.
	
✓	Prompt Before: You can have BlackBerry Browser give you a second 
chance before you do the following:
 
• Closing Browser on Escape: You’re notified right before you exit 
BlackBerry Browser.
 
• Closing Modified Pages: You’re notified right before you exit a 
modified Web page (for example, some type of online form you 
fill out).
 
• Running WML Scripts: WML is a script that tells a wireless device 
how to display a page. It was popular years ago, when resolutions 
of device screens were low, but very few Web sites are using it 
now. We recommend leaving this field deselected.
Cache operations
	
At any given time, your BlackBerry uses a few cache mechanisms. A cache 
(pronounced cash) temporarily stores information used by Browser so that 
the next time the info is needed, Browser doesn’t have to go back to the source 
Web site. The cache can speed up displays when you want to view the Web 
page again and is also useful when you’re suddenly out of network coverage. 
When you visit a site that uses cookies, Browser caches that cookie. (Think of a 
cookie as a piece of text that a Web site creates and places in your BlackBerry’s 
memory to remember something about you, such as your username.)
	
Some Web sites push (send) Web pages to BlackBerry devices. An icon will 
appear on the Home screen, allowing you to quickly view the page. After the 
Web page is delivered to your BlackBerry, it becomes available even if you 
go out of the coverage area. If you subscribe to this service, your device will 
store Web pages in the cache. Also, the addresses of the pages that you vis­
ited (or your latest 20 in your history list) comprise a cache.
The Cache Operations screen, shown in Figure 11-15, allows you to manually 
clear your cache. To view the Cache Operations screen, follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Browser screen, press the menu key.
	
2.	Select Options.
	
3.	Select Cache Operations.

Speeding up browsing
On a wireless network, many factors can affect 
the speed with which Web pages display. If 
you find that browsing the Web is extremely 
slow, you can make your pages load faster in 
exchange for not using a few features. Here are 
some of the speed-enhancing work-arounds 
you can use:
	✓	Don’t display images. You can achieve 
a big performance improvement by turn­
ing off image display. From the Browser 
menu, select Browser Options➪Browser 
Configuration, scroll to Show Images, and 
change the value to No.
	✓	Check your BlackBerry memory. When 
your BlackBerry’s memory is depleted, its 
performance degrades. The BlackBerry 
low-memory manager calls each applica­
tion every now and then, telling each one 
to free resources.
	
	 Hint #1: Don’t leave many e-mail messages 
unread. When the low-memory manager 
kicks in, Messages tries to delete old mes­
sages, but it can’t delete unread messages.
	
	 Hint #2: Purge the BlackBerry event log to 
free needed space. Enter the letters LGLG 
while pressing down the Shift key. This 
opens an event log. The event log entries 
may not make sense to you because they’re 
mostly cryptic and in codes. These are usu­
ally helpful for technical folks to figure out 
what’s going on in your BlackBerry but are 
something you don’t really need. You can 
clear the event log to free memory.
	✓	Turn off other features. If you’re mostly 
interested in viewing content, consider 
turning off features that pertain to how 
the content is processed, such as Support 
HTML Tables, Use Background Images, 
Support JavaScript, Allow JavaScript 
Popups, and Support Style Sheets. To turn 
off other Browser features, navigate to 
Browser Options➪General Properties.
	
	 Warning: We don’t advise turning off fea­
tures while performing an important task 
such as online banking. If you do, you may 
not be able to perform some of the actions 
on the page. For example, the Submit button 
might not work. Not good.

212
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
The size for each type of cache is displayed on this screen. If the cache has 
content, you also see the Clear button, which you can use to clear the speci­
fied cache type. This is true for all types of cache except for history, which 
has its own Clear History button. You find four types of cache:
	
✓	Content Cache: Any offline content. You may want to clear this when­
ever you’re running out of space on your BlackBerry and need to free 
some memory. Or maybe you’re tired of viewing old content or tired of 
pressing the Refresh option.
	
✓	Pushed Content: Any content that was pushed to your BlackBerry from 
Push Services subscriptions. You may want to clear this to free memory 
on your BlackBerry.
	
✓	Cookie Cache: Any cookies stored on your BlackBerry. You may want 
to clear this for security’s sake. Sometimes you don’t want a Web site to 
remember you.
	
✓	History: The list of sites you’ve visited by using the Go To function. You 
may want to clear this for the sake of security if you don’t want other 
people knowing which Web sites you’re visiting on your BlackBerry.
	
You can easily check how much memory your device has in the Help Me! 
screen. To go to the Help Me! screen, press and hold Alt+Shift+H while in the 
Home screen. Shift is the ↑ bottom-left key to the left of the 0 key.
Installing and Uninstalling Applications 
from the Web
You can download and install applications on your BlackBerry via Browser — 
that is, if the application has a link that lets you download and install the files 
(see Chapter 19 for other installation options). The downloading and install­
ing parts are easy. Follow these steps:
	
1.	From Browser, click the application’s link.
	
	 You see a simple prompt that looks like the screen shown in Figure 11-16.
	
2.	Select the Download button.
	
	 The download starts, and you’ll see a progress screen.
As long as you stay within network coverage while the download is progressing, 
your BlackBerry can finish the download and install the application for you. If it 
finishes without any problems, you see the screen shown in Figure 11-17.

Figure 11-17: 
The down-
load and 
installation 
were 
completed.
	
As with a desktop computer, the download might or might not work for a 
variety of reasons. Sometimes the application
	
✓	Requires you to install libraries
	
✓	Works only on a certain version of the BlackBerry OS
These issues can be prevented, depending on the sophistication of the site 
where the link is published. With most reputable sources, these issues have 
been resolved, and successful downloading and installation are a snap.
	
Installing applications from a source that is not reputable can cause your 
BlackBerry to become unstable. Before you download an application from the 
Web, be sure to read reviews about that particular application. Most of the 
time, other people who tried the software provide reviews or feedback. Don’t 
be the first to write the bad review!
	
Your BlackBerry Enterprise Server administrator can disable the feature 
in your BlackBerry to download and install an application. This is mostly 
the case for a company-issued device. If you have problems downloading 
and installing an application, check your company policy or contact the 
BlackBerry support person in your company.

214
Part III: Getting Online with Your Curve 
If you download an application that turns out to be a dud, you need to unin­
stall it. See Chapter 19 for more on uninstalling an application from your 
BlackBerry.
Browser’s Behavior in Business
Getting a device from your employer has both a good and an ugly side:
	
✓	Good: Your company foots the bill.
	
✓	Ugly: Your company foots the bill.
Because your company pays, the company dictates what you can and cannot 
do with your BlackBerry Curve. This is especially true with respect to brows­
ing the Web.
Two scenarios come into play when it comes to your browser:
	
✓	Your browser might be running under your company’s BlackBerry 
Enterprise Server. With this setup, your BlackBerry Browser is connect­
ing to the Internet by using your company’s Internet connection. It’s like 
using your desktop machine at work.
	
✓	Your browser is connected through a network service provider. Most of 
the time, this kind of browser is called by the company’s name.
In most cases, your device fits in only one scenario, which is the case where 
your browser is connected through your company’s BlackBerry Enterprise 
Server server. Some lucky folks may have both. Whatever scenario you’re in, 
the following sections describe the major differences between the two and 
indicate what you can expect.
Using Browser on your company’s 
BlackBerry Enterprise Server
In an enterprise setup, your BlackBerry Browser is connected through your 
company’s BlackBerry Enterprise Server server. With this setup, the browser 
is actually named BlackBerry Browser. BlackBerry Enterprise Server is located 
inside your company’s intranet. This setup allows the company to better 
manage the privileges and the functions you can use on your device.
For the BlackBerry Browser application, this setup allows the company to 
use the existing Internet infrastructure, including the company’s firewall. 

215
 Chapter 11: Surfing the Internet Wave
Because you are within the company’s network, the boundaries that your 
network administrator set up on your account apply to your BlackBerry as 
well. For example, when browsing the Web, your BlackBerry won’t display 
any Web sites that are blocked by your company’s server.
The good thing, though, is that you can browse the company’s intranet: That 
is, all the Web pages you have access to inside your company through your 
company’s PC are available also in your BlackBerry.
	
Know (and respect) your company’s Web-browsing policy. Most companies 
keep logs of sites you view on your browser and might even have software to 
monitor usage. Also, your company might not allow downloading from the Web.
Using your network provider’s browser
Any new device coming from a network service provider can come with its 
own branded Web browser. It’s the same BlackBerry Browser, but the behav­
ior might differ in the following ways:
	
✓	The name is different.
	
✓	The default home page usually points to the provider’s Web site. This 
isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Most of the time, the network provider’s 
Web site is full of links that you may not find on BlackBerry Browser.
	
✓	You can browse more sites. You aren’t limited by your company’s policy.
Setting the default browser
If you have two Web browsers on your Curve, you have the option to set the 
default browser. This comes into play when you view a Web address by using 
a link outside the Browser application. For example, when you view an e-mail 
with a Web link, selecting that link launches the default browser.
To set up the default browser, follow these steps:
	
1.	Go to the Home screen.
	
2.	Choose Settings➪Options➪Advanced Options➪Browser.
	
3.	Use the Space key to change the value of the default browser configu­
ration, as shown in Figure 11-18.

Getting Around with Your 
BlackBerry GPS
In This Chapter
▶	Using GPS safely
▶	Preparing to use GPS on your BlackBerry
▶	Choosing a GPS application
A
few years back, when some of the North American network carriers 
introduced GPS on their versions of the BlackBerry, we were quite 
impressed . . . until we tried it. The response time was slow, and it wasn’t 
accurate. On top of that, the network carriers charged users an arm and 
a leg for this inferior service. As it turns out, those GPS functions were 
implemented by using the network — that is, GPS wasn’t embedded in the 
BlackBerry. How low-tech!
Today, your BlackBerry Curve can come with built-in GPS, which makes find­
ing yourself easy. In this chapter, we show you how to use your BlackBerry’s 
built-in GPS and show you the best GPS applications you can use on your 
BlackBerry, two of which are free!
	
The BlackBerry Curve 8900 model has built-in GPS, but some BlackBerry 
Curve 8500 models do not. If you have a BlackBerry Curve 8500, please check 
with your network carrier for the status of your Curve.
Putting Safety First
	
Some GPS features are useful while you’re driving a car. However, even when 
tempted to use your BlackBerry GPS while driving, we strongly suggest that 
you do not adjust it while you’re driving.
Before you start using BlackBerry GPS in your car, you need a BlackBerry car 
holder — preferably a car kit with a car charger. You can buy a car kit on the 
Internet; just search for BlackBerry car kit. Or go to one of the following Web sites:

220
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
	
✓	www.shopblackberry.com
	
✓	http://shop.crackberry.com
Now that you have all you need to keep you safe, keep on reading.
What You Need
For GPS to work on your BlackBerry, it needs navigation maps, which are 
usually downloaded in little pieces as required. And because these maps are 
downloaded, you must be subscribed to a data plan and have a radio signal 
to obtain them.
	
If you didn’t subscribe to an unlimited data plan from your network carrier, 
be aware that the more you use your GPS as you move about, the more data 
(map pieces) you’ll download, which means the more charges you’ll incur.
In summary, for your BlackBerry GPS to work, you need
	
✓	A data plan from your network carrier. We recommend an unlimited 
data plan.
	
✓	To be in an area where you have a radio signal. That way, you can 
download the maps.
Your GPS Application Choices
The four GPS applications that you can use on your BlackBerry are
	
✓	BlackBerry Maps (comes with your BlackBerry): Free
	
✓	Google Maps (m.google.com/maps): Free
	
✓	Garmin Mobile (garmin.com/mobile/mobilext): $99 one-time fee
	
✓	TeleNav GPS Navigator (telenav.com/products/tn/): $9.99 per month
The icons for all are pictured in Figure 12-1.
BlackBerry Maps
As we mention earlier, your BlackBerry comes with the BlackBerry Maps 
application loaded (refer to Figure 12-1).

If you have a BlackBerry with AT&T as your network carrier, you might not 
have BlackBerry Maps installed out of the box. No worries; you can down­
load it via mobile.blackberry.com. (Keep reading, too, for alternatives to 
BlackBerry Maps that still take advantage of your BlackBerry GPS.)
With or without GPS (built-in or external), you can use BlackBerry Maps to do 
the following (see Figure 12-2):
	
✓	Find a location by typing an address or by using Contacts
	
✓	Get point-to-point directions
	
✓	E-mail or SMS a location to colleagues and friends
	
✓	Turn GPS on or off
	
✓	Zoom in and out of the map
Of course, with GPS turned on, you can track where you are and follow point-
to-point directions.
Google Maps
Google Maps is the mobile version of http://maps.google.com. It has 
most of the features of the online version, including satellite imaging and traf­
fic information. Best of all, it’s free.
Like BlackBerry Maps, you can use Google Maps even without a GPS. With 
Google Maps, you can search for businesses and landmarks; it’s like having 
the ultimate 411 (with a map) at the tip of your fingers.

222
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
	
Figure 12-2:

Because Google Maps doesn’t come with your BlackBerry, you need to down­
load it. To do so, go to www.google.com/gmm. After the program down­
loads, its icon appears on your Home screen (refer to Figure 12-1).
After Google Maps is loaded, press the menu key to display the menu shown 
in Figure 12-3.
	
Figure 12-3: 
Google 
Maps menu.
	
From the menu, you can do the following:
	
✓	Find businesses and landmarks, including phone numbers, address 
information, and Web addresses
	
✓	Find and map exact addresses
	
✓	Get step-by-step directions from point A to point B
	
✓	View a satellite image of the current map (see Figure 12-4)
	
✓	Get traffic information for major highways

With GPS or Google’s MyLocation on, you can see your current location as a 
blue blinking dot.
Here are some keyboard shortcuts for Google Maps:
	
✓	Zoom in: I key
	
✓	Zoom out: O key
	
✓	Go to the current location: 0 (zero) key
	
You need to have a radio signal to download maps to your BlackBerry. In addi­
tion, we recommend that you have an unlimited data plan if you are a frequent 
user of the GPS feature on your BlackBerry.
TeleNav GPS Navigator
TeleNav GPS Navigator is a full-featured GPS solution. It’s intended as a GPS 
device replacement, which means the folks at TeleNav want you to use your 
BlackBerry in the car. TeleNav’s feature list is extensive. From 3D maps to a 
real-time compass to finding Wi-Fi hotspots, the list goes on and on. It even 
lets you input the address by speaking aloud instead of typing, and responds 
by speaking the directions aloud to you. Figure 12-5 shows the main menu 
for TeleNav. (Note that there are network-branded versions of TeleNav; 
for example, Figure 12-5 shows an AT&T version. The functionalities from 
TeleNav are the same, regardless of network branding.)
The extensive features come at a price. Depending on your network carrier, 
TeleNav costs about $10 per month. TeleNav does offer a 30-day free trial. 
Visit www.telenav.com/products/tn for more information. After the 
product is downloaded, its icon appears on your screen (refer to Figure 12-1).

Garmin Mobile
Like TeleNav, Garmin offers a full-featured GPS solution. They charge a 
one-time fee of $99, which is good for the life of the device. The features 
of Garmin Mobile are very similar to its GPS counterpart. If you have ever 
owned a Garmin GPS, the user interface is similar and friendly. Figure 12-6 
shows the main menu for Garmin Mobile.

▶	Saving and organizing your pictures
▶	Sharing your photos with other people
▶	Getting ready to say “action”
▶	Configuring your video camera
O
h, shoot, you forgot your camera. Don’t worry! Your BlackBerry is 
there when you need to capture the unbelievable: Grandma doing a 
handstand, Grandpa doing a cartwheel, or your roommate doing her laundry. 
And if pictures aren’t enough, you can record your unbelievable scene in full 
motion.
Before you try taking pictures, read this chapter so you know what to expect 
and how to get the best shot. We walk you through the easy steps for captur­
ing that funny pose and tell you how to store those photos and videos. And 
don’t miss reading how to share the joy with your buddies.
Saying “Cheese”
Snapping shots with your BlackBerry Curve couldn’t be easier. Just turn on 
the Camera app, line up your shot, and snap away. Here’s the bird’s-eye view:
	
1.	Press the right convenience key (bottom key on the right side of your 
BlackBerry) to bring up the Camera application.

226
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
	
	 Figure 13-1 shows the 8900, and Figure 13-2, the 8500. Most network car­
riers set the right convenience key on the Curve to bring up the Camera 
application. However, network carriers may change this setting. So if 
you don’t see the Camera app when pressing the right-side key, the 
alternative to launching the Camera application is selecting the Camera 
icon from the Home screen.
	
	 Make sure that your finger isn’t blocking the lens on the back side of 
your device.
	
	 The camera button on the right side of your Curve is really a conve­
nience key, which you can program to open your favorite application. By 
default, it’s set to launch Camera. Chapter 3 shows how to change this 
setting.
	
2.	When you see the image onscreen, press the Camera key to take the 
picture.
	
	 You should hear a funky shutterlike sound. Neat and easy, isn’t it?
That’s the quick version. Keep reading to discover more about Camera’s 
features.

screen shows you the image you’re about to capture. Immediately below the 
preview are icons that indicate (starting from the left)
	
✓	Number of pictures you can capture
	
✓	Zoom
	
✓	Flash for 8900
	
✓	Low-light indicator

228
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
Choosing the picture quality
Your Curve can capture images with as much resolution as 2.0 megapixels 
(MP) for the 8500 and 3.2 MP for the 8900. Saving images at this resolu­
tion requires considerable space, though. Just be mindful when shooting, 
and consider saving images at a lower quality to save some space on your 
BlackBerry.
	
Get a big microSD card. Nowadays, even a 32GB microSD card is inexpensive, 
and it holds thousands of pictures.
Here are the three resolutions you can choose:
	
✓	Normal: The default setting. This is the lowest quality but lets you save 
the most pictures. The trade-off is that Normal picture quality won’t be 
as smooth or as fine as the other resolution choices.
	
	If you’re just taking pictures of your friends’ faces so you can attach 
them as Caller IDs, Normal is appropriate.
	
✓	Fine: A middle setting between Normal and SuperFine. This is a com­
promise if you’re concerned about space and want to capture more pic­
tures. The best use is for any electronic viewer; this option isn’t good for 
printing.
	
✓	SuperFine: The best quality that your Camera can capture. Choose this 
if you plan on printing the images.
Changing picture quality is a snap. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Open the Camera application.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select the Options icon.
	
3.	Highlight Picture Quality and then press the Space key until the set­
ting you want is highlighted.
	
	 Pressing the Space key toggles the picture quality value among Normal, 
Fine, and SuperFine.
	
4.	Press the menu key and then select Save.
	
	 The picture quality you chose is active.
Zooming and focusing
You need to be steady to get a good focus while taking your shots. Although 
it’s convenient to use one hand while taking pictures, most of the time, you’ll 
get a blurry image if you try that.

229
 Chapter 13: Taking Great Pictures and Capturing Videos
	
When taking pictures, hold your Curve with both hands, one holding the 
smartphone steady and the other pressing the trackball or trackpad. If the 
right convenience key is set to Camera, you can press that instead of the 
trackball or trackpad.
Holding the smartphone with both hands is even more important if you’re 
zooming in. Yes, your camera is capable of up to 3.0x digital zoom. Here’s 
what you need to do to focus and zoom:
	
✓	To focus: Your camera has autofocus. Just hold it steady.
	
✓	To zoom in: Slide up with the trackball or trackpad.
	
✓	To zoom out: Slide down with the trackball or trackpad.
While zooming, the value in the indicator changes from 1.0x to 2.0x to 3.0x 
and vice versa, depending on the direction you scroll.
When zooming, your thumb is already on the trackball or trackpad. What a 
convenient way to take the picture — just press.
	
We don’t recommend using the zoom. Digital zoom (which is what your 
camera has) gives poor results because it’s done through software and 
degrades the quality of the picture. The higher the zoom factor, the more pix­
elated the picture becomes. To get a clearer picture, get closer to the object.
Setting the flash
	
If you have the BlackBerry Curve 8900, your smartphone comes with a flash. 
The rightmost indicator on the Camera screen is the flash. The default is 
Automatic, which shows a lightning bolt with the letter A. Automatic means 
that the camera detects the amount of light you have at the moment you cap­
ture the image. Where it’s dark, the flash fires; otherwise, it doesn’t.
	
You can turn the flash on, off, or to automatic. The default setting is 
Automatic. When set to Off, the lightning bolt is encircled with a diagonal line, 
just like you see on No Smoking signs. You can toggle the settings on the cam­
era’s Options screen, which is accessible by pressing the menu key and select­
ing Options.
	
The 8500 has no flash.

230
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
Setting the white balance
In photography, filters are used to compensate for the dominant light. For 
instance, a fluorescent versus an incandescent light could affect how warm 
the picture appears. Instead of using filters, most digital cameras, including 
the Curve, have a feature called white balance that corrects or compensates 
for many types of light settings.
You can choose Sunny, Cloudy, Night, Incandescent, Fluorescent, or 
Automatic (the default). Automatic means your camera determines what 
it thinks are the best settings to apply. You can change the white balance 
through the camera’s Options screen, which is accessible by pressing the 
menu key and then selecting Options.
Setting the picture size
Aside from picture quality, you can adjust the size of the photo:
	
✓	Large: 1600 x 1200. This is the default setting.
	
	Large uses more memory.
	
✓	Medium: 1024 x 768
	
✓	Small: 640 x 480
Again, camera settings are accessible through the camera’s Options screen — 
press the menu key and then select Options from the menu that appears.
Geotagging
Because your Curve has GPS capability, your location based on longitude 
and latitude can be determined easily. This information can be added to your 
media files, including pictures taken from your camera. Now you don’t have 
to wonder where you took that crazy pose. Adding geographic information is 
known as geotagging.
Geotagging is disabled by default. Enable it from the camera’s Options 
screen: Press the menu key and then select Options to get to the Options 
screen.
	
If you have longitude and latitude information from one of your photos, 
you can use one of the free sites on the Web to locate where you were when 
you took the photo. One such site is www.travelgis.com/geocode/
default.aspx.

 Chapter 13: Taking Great Pictures and Capturing Videos
Working with Pictures
You’ve taken a bunch of pictures, and you want to see them. And maybe 
delete the unflattering ones. Or perhaps organize them. No problem.
Viewing pictures
If you take a picture, you want to see it, right? You can see an image you just 
captured right then and there, as shown in Figure 13-3.
	
Figure 13-3: 
The Camera 
screen after 
taking a 
picture.
	
All the pictures you took on your Camera are filed directly to a folder in your 
system. The possible default folder location of pictures is based on whether 
you opted to save it in
	
✓	Device Memory: /Device Memory/home/user/pictures
	
✓	Media Card: /Media Card/BlackBerry/pictures
	
Let your device file the pictures in the media card (microSD). The first time 
you use Camera, it prompts you whether to save pictures to the media card. 
If you aren’t sure what the current setting is, simply close the Camera applica­
tion and then take out the microSD card and put it back in. The next time you 
open Camera, it displays the same prompt about letting you save pictures to 
the media card.
The format of the filename is based on the current date and time and named 
as IMG<counter>-<yyyymmdd>-<hhmm>.jpg. So if you took the 21st pic­
ture at 9:30 a.m. on December 20, 2009, you end up with IMG00021-20091220-
0930.jpg.

To see your pictures in a slide show, follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Camera screen, press the menu key, and then select View 
Pictures from the menu that appears.
	
2.	Press the menu key.
	
3.	Select Slide Show.
	
	 Voilà! Your BlackBerry displays your pictures one at a time at a regular 
time interval. The default interval between each picture is two seconds; 
if you aren’t happy with this interval, change it in the Options screen. 
(Press the menu key and then select Options to get to the Options 
screen.)
Trashing pictures
If you don’t like an image you captured, you can delete it. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Highlight the picture you want to trash.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Delete from the menu that 
appears; alternatively, press the Del key.
	
	 A confirmation screen appears.
	
3.	Select Delete.
You can also delete an image right after taking the picture; just select the 
trash-can icon when viewing the photo (refer to Figure 13-3).
Listing filenames versus thumbnails
When you open a folder packed with pictures, your BlackBerry automatically 
shows thumbnails, which are small previews of your pictures.
A preview is nice, but suppose you want to search for a picture by filename. 
Here’s how:

233
 Chapter 13: Taking Great Pictures and Capturing Videos
	
1.	Go to a picture folder.
	
2.	Press the menu key.
	
3.	Select View List.
	
	 That’s exactly what you get: a list of all the pictures in the folder. What’s 
neat is that the option also displays the file size, which can give you a 
clue about what settings you used to take the picture. For example, a 
photo taken at a SuperFine quality produces a much bigger file size com­
pared with one taken at Normal.
Checking picture properties
Curious about the amount of memory your picture is using? Want to know 
the time you took the photo?
	
1.	Highlight the picture from a list.
	
	 On the Camera screen, view the list of your pictures by pressing the 
menu key and then selecting View Pictures.
	
2.	Press the menu key.
	
3.	Select Properties.
	
	 You see a screen similar to Figure 13-4, which displays the file’s loca­
tion in your BlackBerry, size, and last modification. The arrow with 
Removable text indicates that it’s filed in the media card. The Hidden 
check box allows you to hide the file when navigating through your pic­
ture list. Once hidden, the file disappears from the list, and the only way 
to see the file in your Curve again is to use Explore. Check Chapter 14 for 
details about Explore.

Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
Organizing your pictures
Organization is all about time and the best use of it. After all, you want to 
spend your time enjoying looking at your pictures — not looking for them. 
Your BlackBerry Curve enables you to rename and move pictures to different 
folders. You can create folders, too. With those capabilities, you should be on 
your way to organization nirvana.
Renaming a picture file
BlackBerry autonames a file when you capture a picture. However, the name 
of the picture is generic, something like IMGxxxx-currentdate-time, where x is 
a number. Not very helpful.
	
Make it a habit to rename a photo as soon as you capture it. Using a name like 
Dean blows birthday candles is much more helpful than IMG0029-20081013-0029.
Renaming a photo file is a snap. Here’s how:
	
1.	Display the picture screen or highlight the photo file in the list.
	
	 The list is displayed from Camera when you press the menu key and 
select View Pictures.
	
2.	Press the menu key and select Rename.
	
	 A Rename screen appears, as shown in Figure 13-5.
	
3.	Enter the name you want for this picture and then select Save.
	
	 Your picture is renamed.
	
Figure 13-5: 
Rename 
your picture 
here.
	
Creating a folder
Being the organized person you are, you must be wondering about folders. 
Don’t fret; it’s simple to create one. Here’s how:

235
 Chapter 13: Taking Great Pictures and Capturing Videos
	
1.	From the Camera screen, press the menu key and then select View 
Pictures.
	
	 The screen displays the list of pictures in the folder where Camera saves 
the pictures.
 
• If the current folder is still the default pictures-folder location, this 
folder will be the root of where you can create your subfolder. You 
can proceed to Step 3.
 
• Otherwise, follow Step 2 to select the Up icon to navigate up to the 
folder above this folder.
	
2.	Select the Up icon to navigate to the main folder where you want your 
new folder to be created.
	
	 You should be within the folder where you want your new folder to be 
created. If you are not, repeat this step to navigate to that folder.
	
3.	Press the menu key and then select New Folder.
	
4.	Type the name of the folder and then select OK.
	
	 Your folder is created.
Moving pictures
Here’s how to move pictures to a different folder:
	
1.	From the Camera screen, press the menu key and then select View 
Pictures.
	
	 The screen displays the list of pictures in the current folder. If the pic­
ture you want to move isn’t in this folder, click the Up icon to navigate 
up to other folders.
	
2.	Highlight the picture you want to move, press the menu key, and then 
select Move.
	
	 In the screen that opens, navigate to the folder where you want to move 
this picture.
	
3.	Click the Up icon, and use the trackball or trackpad to navigate to the 
folder where you want to move this picture.
	
4.	Press the menu key and then select Move Here.
	
	 Your picture is moved.
	
You can easily transfer your pictures to your PC or copy pictures from your 
PC to your Curve. See Chapter 15 for details.

236
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
Sharing your pictures
Where’s the joy in taking great pictures if you’re the only one seeing them? 
Your BlackBerry has several options for sharing your bundle of joy:
	
1.	From the Camera screen, press the menu key and then select View 
Pictures.
	
2.	Highlight a picture you want to share.
	
3.	Press the menu key.
	
4.	Select one of the choices listed here:
 
• Send as E-mail: This goes directly to the Message screen for com­
posing an e-mail, with the selected picture as an attachment.
 
• Send as MMS: Similar to Send as Email, this opens a Compose 
MMS screen with the selected picture as an attachment. MMS first 
displays Contacts, though, letting you select the person’s phone 
number to receive the MMS before going to the Compose screen. 
Another difference is that in MMS, the Curve sends a tiny version 
of the picture.
 
• Send to Messenger Contact: This option is available if you have 
BlackBerry Messenger installed. This function is similar to Send 
as MMS but displays only those contacts you have in BlackBerry 
Messenger. It uses BlackBerry Messenger to send a tiny version of 
the picture file.
 
• Send Using Bluetooth: Send the picture to any Bluetooth-capable 
device.
	
You might see other ways to send a picture file if you have other instant mes­
saging (IM) clients installed. For example, if you have Google Talk installed, 
you will see the Send as Google Talk option.
Setting a picture as Caller ID
Wouldn’t it be nice when your girlfriend calls if you also could see her beauti­
ful face? You can. Start with a photo of her saved on your BlackBerry Curve. 
Then follow these steps:
	
	
1.	Select the Media icon from the Home screen and then select Pictures.
	
	
2.	Navigate to the location of the photo.
	
3.	Highlight the photo you want to appear when the person calls.

237
 Chapter 13: Taking Great Pictures and Capturing Videos
	
4.	Press the menu key and then select Set as Caller ID.
	
	 The photo is displayed onscreen, with a superimposed, portrait-size 
cropping rectangle. Inside the rectangle is a clear view of the photo; 
outside the rectangle, the photo is blurry. The clear view represents 
the portion of the photo that you want to show up as Caller ID. You can 
move the trackball or trackpad to move the rectangle to make sure that 
you crop to capture the face.
	
5.	Crop the photo by pressing the trackball or trackpad and selecting 
Crop and Save.
	
	 Contacts appears.
	
6.	Select the contact you want this picture to appear for.
	
	 A message indicating a picture is set for that contact appears. 
You’re set.
	
	 Adding a photo to your contacts can also be done through the Contacts 
application (refer to Chapter 4).
Setting a Home screen image
Suppose you have a stunning picture that you want to use as the background 
image for your BlackBerry. Follow these steps to set the image:
	
1.	Select the Media icon from the Home screen and then select Pictures.
	
2.	Navigate to the location of the picture you want to use.
	
3.	Highlight the picture.
	
4.	Press the menu key and then select Set as Wallpaper.
	
	 You can always reset the screen image or go back to the default Home 
screen image by following the preceding steps but selecting Reset 
Wallpaper from the Menu screen in Step 4.
Say Action: Capturing Video
Your BlackBerry Curve camera application can do more than take still 
photos. You can also use it to take videos.
Here are the quick and easy steps to use Video Camera mode:
	
1.	Open the Camera application.

238
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Video Camera.
	
	 The screen displays like a viewfinder on a typical digital video camera, as 
shown in Figure 13-6. Press the trackball or trackpad to start recording.
	
Figure 13-6: 
Toggle 
to Video 
Camera 
mode here.
	
The onscreen controls are all context related. When you first launch the 
video camera, all you see is the Record button with the big white dot at the 
bottom of the screen (shown in Figure 13-7). When you use the trackball or 
trackpad to select the Record button, the video camera starts taking video, 
and the only available control is a Pause button.

The indicators on your screen, as shown in Figure 13-7, are as follows:

239
 Chapter 13: Taking Great Pictures and Capturing Videos
	
✓	Available Memory: The more squares you see, the more free space you 
have for saving videos to the device memory or the media card.
	
✓	Video Light: Shows up only if you have the 8900. A circle around the 
lightning icon, like you see on the left side of Figure 13-7, indicates that 
Video light is off, which is the default setting.
	
	The following section shows how to enable Video light.
	
✓	Zoom: Like your still camera, it’s capable of giving you 3.0x digital zoom.
	
✓	Recorded Time: Tells you how long, in seconds, you’ve been recording.
You can use the escape key to stop recording and save the captured video 
or press the trackball or trackpad to pause recording. When you pause the 
recording, the screen updates to show the rest of the controls, as you see in 
Figure 13-8.

The controls are the familiar buttons you see on a typical video recorder/
player. From left to right, they are as follows:
	
✓	Record: Continue recording.
	
✓	Stop: End the current recording.
	
✓	Play: Play the current video you just recorded.
	
✓	Rename: Rename the video file.
	
✓	Delete: Get rid of the video file of the current recording.

240
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
	
✓	Send: Share your current video recording. You have the option to 
send it as e-mail, as MMS, or through Bluetooth. If you have IM clients 
installed, such as Google Talk or Yahoo! Messenger, the IM client will be 
listed as one of the options for sending the video file.
Customizing the Video Camera
Your BlackBerry has a few settings you can tweak to change the behavior 
of the video camera. And as with every other BlackBerry application, to 
see what you can customize, don’t look anywhere else but the application’s 
Options screen — in this case, the Video Camera Options screen.
Follow these steps to get to the Video Camera Options screen:
	
1.	Open the Camera application.
	
2.	Press the menu key and then select Video Camera (refer to Figure 13-6).
	
3.	Press the menu key and then select Options.
	
	 The Video Camera Options screen appears, as shown in Figure 13-9.
	
Figure 13-9: 
Customize 
your video 
camera 
here.
	
The available options are easy to digest, but in case you need a little help, 
here’s what you can tweak:
	
✓	Video Light: In case it’s a little dim, you can turn on the video camera’s 
lights. This is available only if you have the 8900. The Curve 8500 doesn’t 
have a video light. While on the video camera screen, you can toggle this 
setting on or off simply by pressing the Space key.

241
 Chapter 13: Taking Great Pictures and Capturing Videos
	
	Dropped something in a dark alley? This video light is a good alternative 
to a flashlight when you need one.
	
	Video Light is the flash that you use when taking still pictures. It stays lit 
when you set the setting to On and open the Video Camera. The default 
is Off.
	
	Using Video Light is a drain on your battery.
	
✓	Color Effect: The default color effect is Normal, which is standard color. 
If you’re in the mood for effects, you can opt for Black & White or Sepia.
	
✓	Video Format: This option is the screen resolution size. The default here 
is Normal, at 240 x 180 for the 8900 and 320 x 240 for the 8500. If you’re 
planning to send your video to friends through MMS, you can choose 
MMS mode, which has the smaller size of 176 x 144 and is optimal for 
MMS.
	
✓	Folder: You can use this option to change the default location where 
your BlackBerry saves the video file.

Satisfy Your Senses 
with Media Player
In This Chapter
▶	Listening to music
▶	Selecting a ring tone
▶	Recording your voice
▶	Controlling your media files
I
f one word describes today’s phone market trends, it’s convergence. Your 
BlackBerry Curve is among the participants in this convergence race. In 
addition to sending and receiving e-mail and being a phone, a camera, and a 
PDA, the Curve is an excellent portable media player.
In this small package, you can
	
✓	Listen to music
	
✓	Record and watch video clips
	
✓	Sample ring tones
	
✓	Snap and view pictures
These capabilities are bundled into an application with a name you’d recog­
nize even after sipping a couple of pints of strong ale — Media.
Accessing Media
	
	 To run Media, simply select the Media icon from the Home screen. The Media 
icon is easy to distinguish because it bears the image of a CD and a musical 
note.

244
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
Media is a collection of the following media applications:
	
✓	Music
	
✓	Video
	
✓	Ring Tones
	
✓	Pictures
	
✓	Voice Notes
When you open Media, you see that each application is represented with an 
icon, as shown in Figure 14-1. It’s not that difficult to figure out what each one 
of these media applications is used for. Ready to have some fun?
	
Figure 14-1: 
Explore 
Media here.
	
Let the music play
You don’t need a quarter to play music on your BlackBerry Curve. Just select 
the Music application from the Home screen (the left side of Figure 14-2) or 
Music from the Media screen (refer to Figure 14-1). Either method launches 
the same Music application.
Several potential views of your music collection appear, as shown on the 
right side of Figure 14-2. Music is the screen heading. The views are
	
✓	All Songs: Displays all your music files in alphabetical order.
	
✓	Artists: Lists your music files by artist so that you can play your 
John Mayer songs in one go.
	
✓	Albums: Views your music collection one album at a time.

245
 Chapter 14: Satisfy Your Senses with Media Player
	
✓	Genres: If you prefer not to mingle your country with your cutting-edge 
techno, navigate through this view.
	
✓	Playlists: Organizes and plays songs as you prefer — the perfect mix 
tape!
	
✓	Sample Songs: Go here when you’re dying to check the player but 
haven’t yet put your collection into the BlackBerry.
	
✓	Shuffle Songs: Life is all about variety, and when you’re tired of the song 
order in your playlist, select this.
	
Figure 14-2: 
Launch 
Music from 
the Media 
screen (left), 
and choose 
how to view 
your music 
collection 
(right).
	
After you choose a view, select one of the songs to start playing it. After 
BlackBerry starts playing a song, it plays the rest of the music listed in the 
view you selected. The standard interface shown in Figure 14-3 doesn’t 
require much explanation.
	
Figure 14-3: 
The music 
plays here.
	

246
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
	
The two small icons at the bottom left indicate repeat and shuffle:
	
✓	If you want the songs to be played again after the last song in the list is 
played, just press the menu key and select Repeat.
	
✓	Tired of hearing the same sequence of songs played? Press the menu 
key and select Shuffle. Your songs will be played randomly.
	
You can’t fast-forward or rewind, but you can position where Curve is playing 
by dragging the progress slider. Use the trackball or trackpad to select the 
progress slider and then slide the trackball or trackpad to change the slider’s 
position. Press the trackball or trackpad again, and the music starts playing 
from that position.
BlackBerry supports many music formats. The following list shows the sup­
ported formats, along with the file extensions:
	
✓	ACC: Audio compression formats AAC, AAC+, EAAC+, and AAC-LC (.aac 
and .m4a)
	
✓	AMR: Adaptive Multi-Rate–Narrow Band (AMR-NB) speech coder stan­
dard (.mmr and .3gp)
	
✓	MIDI: Polyphonic MIDI (.mid, .midi, and .smf)
	
✓	MP3: MPEG Part 1 and Part 2 audio layer 3 (.mp3 and .mp4)
	
✓	WMA: Windows Media Audio 9, Pro, and 10 (.wma and .asf)
	
The earpiece/mic combo that comes with your Curve is for one ear only. This 
is an issue when you’re on a train. You may prefer using a stereo (two-ear) 
headset — or a Bluetooth headset is a good option.
	
The 8500 series has three media keys at the top. Starting from left, they are
	
✓	Backward: This is the standard two arrow keys pointing to the left, 
which you can use to go back to the previous song or movie in your 
playlist.
	
✓	Play/Pause: Pressing this middle media key launches the Media applica­
tion. If the list of songs or videos is displayed, pressing this key plays 
the currently highlighted media file. If a media file is playing, pressing 
this key pauses the file.
	
✓	Forward: This is the standard two arrow keys pointing to the right. 
Press this key to go to the next media file.
Creating a playlist
Sure, you have favorites in your song library. Having a playlist would be nice, 
right? On your Curve, you can create two types of playlists:

247
 Chapter 14: Satisfy Your Senses with Media Player
	
✓	Standard: A bare-bones playlist in which you manually add the music 
you want.
	
✓	Automatic: You can specify a combination by Artists, by Album, by 
Genres, or any combination thereof.
To create a playlist, follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Music screen, select Playlists.
	
	 To get to the Music screen, select Music in Media or from the Home 
screen.
	
2.	Select [New Playlist].
	
3.	Select Standard Playlist or Automatic Playlist.
	
	 The screen that follows allows you to enter the name of your playlist 
and either
 
• Add songs you select (Standard Playlist).
 
• Specify your playlist criteria (Automatic Playlist).
	
	 Skip to Step 5 if you selected Automatic Playlist.
	
4.	If you select Standard Playlist, do the following:
	
a.	Press the menu key and then select Add Songs.
	
	Your music library listing appears.
	
b.	Scroll to your music list, and select the song you want to add to 
your playlist.
	
	You return to the preceding screen, with the selected song added 
to your playlist. Repeat this step for each song you want to add.
	
c.	After you’ve added all the songs you want in Standard Playlist, 
press the menu key and select Save.
	
	You’re finished!
	
5.	If you select Automatic Playlist, do the following:
	
a.	Select the + button to the right of the music type criteria, and 
select one of the listed combinations.
	
	Again, you can choose by Artist, by Albums, by Genres, or a combi­
nation of any of the three options. If you choose by Artist, you’ll be 
presented with the list of artists; the same is true for by Albums, 
where a list of albums will be shown for you to select.
	
b.	Repeat Step 5a to add more values to your criteria.
	
c.	After you add all the criteria you want in Automatic Playlist, 
press the menu key and select Save.
	
	You’re finished!

248
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
	
From time to time, you may have played a song and happened to like it. Want 
to add it to your playlist? No problem. While you’re playing the song, simply 
press the menu key and select Add to Playlist. Then select the playlist you 
want that song added to from the screen that follows.
Playing from your playlist
Playing your playlist is a no-brainer:
	
1.	From the Music screen, select Playlists.
	
	 To get to the Music screen, select Music in Media or from the Home screen.
	
2.	Scroll to highlight the playlist you want to start playing.
	
3.	Press the menu key and then select Play.
Now showing
Playing or recording a video is similar to playing music:
	
1.	From the Media screen, select Video.
	
	 You can launch Media by selecting the Media icon from the Home 
screen. The screen shows Video Camera, and a list of video files appears 
at the bottom. If you want to watch a video, skip to Step 5.
	
2.	To start video recording, select Video Camera.
	
	 A screen shows the image in front of the camera.
	
3.	Select the screen again to start recording.
	
	 Don’t wait for “Cut!” You can pause the camera by pressing the trackball 
or trackpad. The familiar video and audio controls appear. From left to 
right, they are Continue Recording, Stop, and Play. The other buttons 
are Rename (for renaming the filename), Delete, and Send via e-Mail.
	
4.	Select the Stop button when you’re ready to wrap up your home video.
	
	 You wind up at the previous screen ,with the video clip file listed. We 
know you’re itching to watch it.
	
5.	Select the file to play it onscreen.
Lord of the ring tones
Ah, the proliferation of ring tones. Nothing beats hearing a loud funky ring 
tone while you’re sleeping on a bus or a train. You can wake other passen­
gers, too, whether you want to use the Top 40, old-fashioned digital beats, or 
something you recorded.

249
 Chapter 14: Satisfy Your Senses with Media Player
To hear ring tones that come with your BlackBerry, do the following:
	
1.	From the Media screen, select Ring Tones.
	
	 You see three views: All Ring Tones, My Ring Tones, and Preloaded Ring 
Tones.
	
2.	Select Preloaded Ring Tones.
	
	 The preloaded ring tones are displayed.
	
3.	Select any one of them, and enjoy.
	
	 While playing a ring tone, select the right arrow to go to the next tone; 
select the left arrow to go the preceding one.
	
4.	Choose a ring tone you like.
	
5.	Press the menu key, and select Set as Ring Tone.
	
	 That ring tone is what plays when your phone rings.
	
A ring tone is similar to a music file and includes many of the same music 
formats:
	
✓	ACC: Advanced Auto Coding format, used by iTunes
	
✓	AMR: Adaptive Multi-Rate, a popular audio format for mobile transmis­
sion and mobile applications
	
✓	M4A: A subset of ACC for audio only
	
✓	MIDI: Musical Instrument Digital Interface, a popular audio format for 
musical instruments
	
✓	MP3: MPEG Audio Layer 3, the most popular music format
	
✓	WMA: Windows Media Audio, a Microsoft audio file format
If you’re familiar with any audio-editing software, you can make your own ring 
tones. Save the file in one of the formats in the preceding list and copy it to 
your Curve. You can also find many free ring tones on the Internet. The only 
possible harm from downloading one is being annoyed with how it sounds. The 
Browser default Home page (http://mobile.blackberry.com) has links to 
sources of ring tones as well. See the Fun and Pages link on the Home page.
Picture this
If you upgraded from an older BlackBerry, you may already know about 
Pictures, which you use to view, zoom into, and rotate pictures:
	
1.	From the Media screen, select Pictures.
	
	 Your options are similar to those for other Media applications.

250
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
	
2.	Navigate to the view you want.
	
3.	Find the picture you’re looking for.
	
4.	Select the file.
	
	 Pretty easy, right? At this point, your photo file is displayed in the 
screen.
	
Check out Sample Pictures. Your BlackBerry comes with a collection of pic­
tures that you can use as your Home screen background. Or assign one of the 
cartoons to a contact as a Caller ID until you get a chance to take the person’s 
picture and use that instead. (We describe how to do that in Chapter 13.)
	
Your Curve supports the following standard picture formats:
	
✓	BMP: Bitmap file format (.bmp)
	
✓	JPEG: Developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group committee 
(.jpg); typically compresses the image file to a tenth of its size with 
little perceptible loss of image quality
	
✓	PNG: Portable Network Graphics (.png), which is a bitmapped image 
format that employs a lossless data transmission
	
✓	TIFF: Tagged Image File Format (.tif), which is mostly used in scan­
ners and is under the control of Adobe Systems
	
✓	WBMP: Wireless Bitmap (.wbmp) file format, which is optimized for 
mobile devices
View in Pictures
When you’re in Pictures and navigating in a folder, the default view is always 
showing thumbnails. This allows you to quickly view many pictures at the 
same time before deciding which one to open.
Want to view all of them? Run a slide show. Press the menu key and select 
View Slide Show.
	
A convenient way to view pictures in OS 5.0 is to slide the trackball or track­
pad sideways. Scrolling right transitions the view to the next picture, and 
you’ll see a smooth sideways movement of the picture in the screen. Scrolling 
left transitions in the opposite direction until the preceding picture is 
displayed.
Zoom to details
To zoom in a photo, open it, press the trackball or trackpad, and then select 
Zoom. A tiny unobtrusive slider bar appears on the left side of the image. 
Now use your trackball or trackpad: Sliding up zooms in, and sliding down 
zooms out.

251
 Chapter 14: Satisfy Your Senses with Media Player
While you’re scrolling, the slider bar indicates the degree of zoom. The exact 
center of this bar is the original image (no zooming applied). You can easily 
go back to the original zoom size by pressing the menu key and selecting 
Zoom All.
	
An image normally defaults to fit the screen, but you can toggle it by pressing 
the menu key and selecting one of these options:
	
✓	Fit to Screen
	
✓	View Actual Size
	
Pressing the trackball or trackpad while a picture is displayed is equivalent to 
zooming in 5.0. Once zoomed in, you can zoom out by pressing the escape key.
Record your voice
A feature-packed smartphone like your Curve should come with a voice 
recorder, and it does. Within Media, you can find Voice Notes, a neat record­
ing application. Now you can record your billion-dollar ideas:
	
1.	Select Voice Notes (that little microphone icon) from the Media screen.
	
	 The Voice Notes application launches, sporting the simple and clean 
screen shown in Figure 14-4. At the top of the screen is a Record button, 
and the bottom part lists your previous recordings.
	
2.	Select Record.
	
3.	Press the trackball or trackpad.
	
	 Your BlackBerry’s microphone is designed to be close to your mouth, 
like any mobile phone’s mic should be.
Rotating a photo
Want to view yourself upside down? Maybe not. 
But sometimes your pictures look better when 
viewed horizontally. If your Curve runs OS 4.6, 
you can rotate an image on the screen while you 
view it in Pictures: Just press the trackball or 
trackpad and select Rotate. The image rotates 
90 degrees clockwise. By repeating the same 
steps, you can keep rotating it; each press is 
an additional 90-degree clockwise rotation. The 
Rotate feature isn’t available in OS 5.0.

	 You can pause any time you want by pressing the Pause button. Familiar 
video/audio controls appear. From left to right, they are Continue 
Recording, Stop, and Play. Other buttons are Rename (for renaming the 
file), Delete, and Send via E-Mail.
	
4.	Press the trackball or trackpad and then select the Stop button to 
wrap it up.
	
	 You return to the preceding screen. Your recent voice recording 
appears in the list.
	
5.	Select the voice recording to play it.

Viewing and Controlling Media Files
The previous sections show what types of files you can record or play on 
your BlackBerry. The following sections give you the lowdown on controlling 
those files when you’re playing or viewing them.
Turning it up (or down)
Whether you’re listening to music or watching a video, adjusting the volume 
is easy.
	
Your Curve comes with dedicated volume buttons on the upper-right side of 
the device. The top button (with the plus sign) turns up the volume, and the 
button below (with the minus sign) turns down the volume. The onscreen 
volume slider reflects anything you did with the volume buttons.

 Chapter 14: Satisfy Your Senses with Media Player
Navigating the menu
Almost all Media applications have a common menu, with the exception of 
Pictures. The menu items are mostly self-explanatory, but the following sec­
tions quickly highlights what you’ll see.
Navigating the Pictures menu
You can easily jump to the next item in the list. Press the menu key while you 
are viewing an image. In the menu that appears, you see the following items:
	
✓	Next: Jumps to the next item in the list. This item appears only if there’s 
an item after this image file in the current folder.
	
✓	Previous: Jumps to the preceding item. This item appears only if there’s 
a previous item in the current folder.
	
✓	Delete: Deletes the image file.
	
✓	Move: Moves the file to a different folder.
	
✓	Rename: Renames the image file.
	
✓	Properties: Displays a screen that shows the location of the image file, 
its size, and the time it was last modified.
Navigating the Music, Videos, Ring Tones, and Voice Notes menu
Whether you are watching a video, playing music, hearing a ring tone, or lis­
tening to a voice note, you see the following after pressing the menu key:
	
✓	Replay: Plays the media file again from the start.
	
✓	Repeat: Plays the same media after it reaches the end.
Media shortcuts
Taking the time to master the following short­
cuts now will pay you back in time later. Here 
are the must-know Media shortcuts:
	✓	Mute: Toggle between pausing and playing 
music and video. (The key is located at the 
upper right of the device and has a muted-
speaker label.)
	✓	6: Move to the next item.
	✓	4: Move to the preceding item.
	✓	3: Zoom in on a picture.
	✓	9: Zoom out on a picture.
	✓	5: Zoom back to the original picture size.
	✓	, (comma): Rotate a picture counterclock­
wise.
	✓	Space: Toggle between pausing and 
resuming a slide show.

254
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
	
✓	Show Playlist: Displays the list of media files on the current folder or 
playlist.
	
✓	Activate Handset: Mutes the device’s speaker. Use this if you want to 
use the earpiece. This menu item appears only if you have activated the 
speakerphone.
	
✓	Activate Speakerphone: Uses the device’s speaker and mutes the ear­
piece. This menu item appears only if the handset is activated.
Using Explore
You can navigate to your media file in many ways, but Explore is probably 
the quickest way to find a file. It’s easy to use because it has some similarities 
to Windows Explorer, and it also has a search facility similar to Find in other 
BlackBerry applications such as Contacts, MemoPad, and Tasks.
To launch Explore, simply select Media from the Home screen, press the 
menu key, and select Explore. The Explore screen starts with the device root 
folders: Media Card, Device Memory, and System.
Folders are in a tree hierarchy. You can get into the child folders (subfolders) 
by selecting from the parent folder, starting from one of the root folders.
	
If you’ve set a property of a picture to hidden, Explore is the only place in 
your Curve through which you’ll be able to locate the file again:
	
1.	Navigate to the folder where your picture file is located.
	
2.	Press the menu key and select Show Hidden.
	
The default location for pictures taken by Camera is either /Device 
Memory/home/user/pictures or /Media Card/BlackBerry/pictures.
Changing the media flavor
Like the rest of your BlackBerry applications, you can customize Media:
	
1.	From the Media screen, press the menu key.
	
2.	Select Options.
	
	 The screen looks like the one shown in Figure 14-5. Each media custom­
ization option is described in the following sections.

255
 Chapter 14: Satisfy Your Senses with Media Player
	
Figure 14-5: 
The Media 
Options 
screen.
	
Customizing pictures
You can change the Pictures application in the following ways:
	
✓	Sort By: Toggle file sorting based on recent updates or name.
	
✓	Thumbnails per Row: When your files appear as a grid of thumbnails 
(small versions of your photos), this number of thumbnails is displayed 
per row. The higher the number, the smaller the thumbnails.
	
✓	Slide Show Interval: When you’re viewing your files in a slide show, 
a picture appears for this many seconds before moving to the next 
picture.
	
✓	Exclude Folders: Use this option when you don’t want to display any 
pictures inside a particular folder. This makes it faster to load the list of 
pictures. (The fewer pictures you have, the faster the Pictures applica­
tion can load the list.) This option isn’t for your secret folders.
	
✓	Set Convenience Keys: A button available only in OS 5.0 allows you to 
change the settings for the right and left convenience keys, which are 
shortcut keys to an application. The defaults are for the right-side key to 
launch Camera and the left-side key to launch Voice Dialing.
Customizing media
You can finesse the rest of Media as follows:
	
✓	Auto Stop Media Player When Idle: You can set this to Off (the default), 
5, 10, 20, 30, or 45 minutes. This can save you battery life if you get dis­
tracted and leave your Curve on a table playing video.

256
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
	
✓	Turn Off Auto Backlighting: The backlighting feature provides addi­
tional screen lighting when Curve detects that you need it. You’ll notice 
it when you move your Curve from shade to direct sunlight. We find it 
bothersome when watching a movie. For that reason — and to extend 
battery life — toggle it Off here.
	
✓	Audio Boost: Allows you to increase the volume beyond the normal 
level. The default setting is Off. If you set it On, it gives you a fair warn­
ing about possible ear discomfort when you’re using headphones.
	
✓	Headset Equalizer: The default is Off, but if you want to have a different 
audio setting, you have several options: Bass Boost, Bass Lower, Dance, 
Hip Hop, Jazz, Lounge, Loud, R&B, Rock, Treble Boost, Treble Lower, 
and Vocal Boost.

▶	Exploring and using Roxio
T
he ways that you can get your hands on media constantly evolve. Ten 
years ago, who would have thought that you could buy music from a tiny 
card or from an “all you can download” monthly subscription?
Someday, you’ll wake up with a technology that doesn’t require you to con­
stantly copy media files to your handheld music player. But for now, enjoying 
music while on the move means managing these files.
Media, the BlackBerry application on your Curve, is a great music player, but 
without music files, it’s as useless as a guitar without strings. And to satisfy 
your quest for mobile media satisfaction, this chapter gives you good infor­
mation on ways to manage your media files.
	
This chapter is for PC users. BlackBerry Desktop Manager for Mac is not yet 
released at the time of writing, so it will not be covered in this chapter.
Working with Media Files
To acquire media files for your BlackBerry Curve, there are as many choices 
as there are ice cream flavors. The succeeding sections describe the most 
common ways.
Using your Curve as a flash drive
The most common way of manipulating media files into and out of your 
Curve is to attach it to a PC and use Windows Explorer:

258
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
	
1.	Connect your BlackBerry to your PC, using the USB cable that came 
with your Curve.
	
	 Only folders and files stored on the microSD will be visible to your PC. 
Make sure to have the microSD card in your BlackBerry Curve before 
you connect your Curve to the PC.
	
	 When connected, the Curve screen displays a prompt for enabling mass 
storage mode.
	
2.	On the Curve screen, select Yes.
	
	 A screen appears on your Curve, asking for your password.
	
3.	On the Curve screen, type your BlackBerry password.
	
	 The device is now ready to behave like an ordinary flash drive. On your 
PC, the Removable Disk dialog box opens.
	
4.	On your PC, in the Removable Disk dialog box, click Open Folder to 
View Files and then click OK.
	
	 This opens the familiar Windows Explorer screen.
	
5.	Manipulate your media files as you want.
	
	 You can do anything you typically do with a normal Windows folder, 
such as drag and drop, copy, and delete files.
	
6.	Close Windows Explorer when you’re finished.
Meet and greet BlackBerry 
Desktop Media Manager
Roxio is known for its CD-ripping software. (Ripping converts music files in 
CD format to other popular compressed formats.) RIM licensed a portion of 
Roxio and packaged it with BlackBerry Desktop Software. Even though this 
version doesn’t offer the entire Roxio software suite, you can still take advan­
tage of fantastic features, such as
	
✓	Ripping CDs
	
✓	Converting files to get the best playback on your Curve
	
✓	Managing music files
	
✓	Syncing media files to your device
	
If you have an old version of Media Manager, just point your desktop Internet 
browser to http://na.blackberry.com/eng/services/desktop for direc­
tions on downloading the latest version for free and installing it on your PC.

259
 Chapter 15: Managing Media Files
In the following sections, we show you the Media Manager interface and how 
to copy a video file onto your Curve.
Accessing Media Manager
You can access Media Manager through BlackBerry Desktop Manager, which 
Chapter 16 describes in detail. Get to Desktop Manager this way:
	
1.	On your PC, click the Windows Start button.
	
2.	Choose All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
	
	 BlackBerry Desktop Manager appears, as shown in Figure 15-1.
	
Figure 15-1: 
Access

3.	Click the Media icon.
	
	 A screen appears, showing Media Manager and BlackBerry Media Sync 
sections. Each section has a Start button.
	
4.	In the Media Manager section, click the Start button.
	
	 The initial Media Manager screen is well organized and gives you the fol­
lowing options:
 
• Manage Pictures
 
• Manage Music
 
• Manage Videos
 
• View Connected Devices
	
5.	Click one of the options.

260
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
The Media Manager screen (shown in Figure 15-2) is easy to use, plus it has 
the same interface as Windows Explorer:
	
✓	The left side is where you navigate to your folders and files.
	
✓	The right side displays the files in the folder you selected from the left side.
	
Figure 15-2: 
View your 
media files 
on this 
screen.
	
The top section looks the same as the bottom section. The top half — My 
Media — represents your desktop; the bottom — My Devices — represents 
your Curve. You can move or copy files easily. When you’re copying, for 
example, one section can be the source, and the other section, the destina­
tion. By simply dragging the files between the two sections, you can copy on 
the same screen. Neat, right?
Other features of Media Manager
Spend some time exploring Media Manager. 
It has interesting features you may find useful. 
Here’s a quick rundown of what you can do 
with Media Manager:
	✓	Import media files
	✓	E-mail media files
	✓	Enhance photos and apply special effects 
to photos by using PhotoSuite
	✓	Set song info (such as title, artist, album, 
genre, year, or an image) to show as track 
art when playing a song
	✓	Record audio
	✓	Customize photo printing

261
 Chapter 15: Managing Media Files
Importing media files to Media Manager
Here’s a quick and easy way to import media files:
	
1.	In Windows Explorer, navigate to find the media files you want.
	
2.	Drag and drop the files into Media Manager.
	
	 You can drag and drop files to the folder in the left part of the screen 
(where the folder tree appears) or to the right part (where the files are 
listed). Just make sure that when you’re doing the latter, the current 
folder in the tree view is the folder where you want the media files to be 
imported.
You can also use Media Manager to locate the files you want without going 
through Windows Explorer. The trick is to change the view to Folders. Check 
out the two tabs at the upper left. The first tab, My Media, is the default view. 
The Folders tab, just to the right of My Media, bears an icon of (go figure) a 
folder.
Click the Folders tab. You see a tree view, but this time, it looks exactly like 
you see it in Windows Explorer, as shown in Figure 15-3. The files can be on 
your local hard drive or in a network folder accessible by your desktop 
computer.
	
Figure 15-3: 
Navigate to 
your desk-
top media 
files here.
	
	
Not all media file types are directly compatible with your Curve. This is espe­
cially true for video files. But Media Manager can convert most media files to a 
usable Curve format.

262
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
Adding a media file to your Curve
Time to copy files to your Curve. Here’s the rundown:
	
1.	Connect your Curve to your PC, using the USB cable that came with 
your BlackBerry.
	
2.	On the Media Manager screen, drag and drop your media files from 
the My Media view to any folder in My Devices.
	
	 You can drag and drop an entire album. After dropping a media file, 
you’re prompted to convert the file to a format that’s usable by your 
Curve, as shown in Figure 15-4.
	
Figure 15-4: 
Choose to 
convert your 
media files 
for optimum 
playback.
	
	
3.	Select a conversion option:
 
• Convert for Optimal Playback: This is the safest bet and is the default. 
This option is applicable to video files where the converter makes 
sure that the video fits perfectly with Curve’s screen resolution.
 
• Copy with No Conversion: Copies the file faster. The file is copied 
to your Curve as is, but it might not play on your Curve.
 
• Advanced Conversion Options: From here, another screen lets you 
downgrade the quality to minimize the file size. It also allows you 
to crop video so that the entire screen is filled instead of seeing 
dark margins.
	
4.	Click OK to begin the transfer.
Synchronizing with iTunes using 
BlackBerry Media Sync
If you have an iPod, you’re probably using iTunes and maintaining a playl­
ist and perhaps a subscription to podcasts or videocasts. Podcast files are 
downloaded to iTunes using RSS. (RSS — Really Simple Syndication — is 
a kind of digital file publish–subscribe mechanism. This is the mechanism 
iTunes uses to receive audio and video recordings, which most people refer 
to as podcasts and videocasts, respectively.)

263
 Chapter 15: Managing Media Files
To sync your Curve with iTunes, follow these quick and easy steps:
	
1.	Click the Windows Start button.
	
2.	Choose All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
	
3.	When BlackBerry Desktop Manager appears (refer to Figure 15-1), 
click the Media icon.
	
	 A screen appears, showing Media Manager and BlackBerry Media Sync 
sections. Each section has a Start button.
	
4.	In the BlackBerry Media Sync section, click the Start button.
	
	 In the dialog box that appears (such as the one shown in Figure 15-5), 
click the double-chevron icon in the lower left of the window to display 
options for the section of iTunes you want to synchronize.
	
Figure 15-5: 
 The 
BlackBerry

screen.
	
	
5.	Click the Show iTunes Playlist icon (lower left).
	
	 A selection of what you have in iTunes appears, as shown in Figure 15-6. 
This is the part of the screen where you choose iTunes media file types.
	
6.	Select the iTunes media you want copied to your Curve.
	
7.	Click the Sync button.
	
	 There you go. You see a progress bar showing the synchronization of 
the media files from iTunes.
Downloading sounds
RIM offer a Web site from which you can sample and download new ring 
tones, alarms, notifiers, and tunes. On your Curve, simply go to http://
mobile.blackberry.com.
On this page, scroll down to the Personalize section, and click the Ringtones 
link. A list of available ring tones will be displayed. And did we mention that 
they’re free?

264
Part IV: Music, Pictures, and Movies on Your Curve 
	
Figure 15-6: 
Choose 
your iTunes 
media here.
	
Clicking the ring tone link gives you an option to either play it or download 
to your Curve. Downloaded ring tones are filed in the My Ring Tones section 
when you open the Ring Tones inside the Media application.
	
RIM isn’t the only site where you can find ring tones. The Web is a treasure 
trove, and ring tones and other media files are safe to download, so go hunting.
	
And the best place to find BlackBerry-related software — including ring tones — 
is to visit the ever-growing BlackBerry community on the Web. Check out 
http://crackberry.com, http://blackberrycool.com, and http://
blackberryreview.com, to name a few.

W
hat better way to keep your BlackBerry Curve updated than to syn­
chronize it with your desktop application’s data?
Arguably, most of the data you need to synchronize is from your personal 
information manager (PIM) applications: notes, appointments, addresses, 
and tasks. The crucial piece for data synchronization to and from your device 
and desktop computer is Synchronize. This software within BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager allows you to synchronize your PIM data as well as upload 
and download media files between your PC and your Curve.
In this chapter, you explore Synchronize and see how to manually and auto­
matically synchronize your Curve with your desktop computer. You find tips 
about which options you may want to use. Before all that, however, is a sec­
tion on BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
If you’re a Mac user, good news! The folks at Research In Motion have finally 
rolled out a Mac version of BlackBerry Desktop Manager. You no longer have 
to use PocketMac, which is way behind on features and capabilities com­
pared to its Windows cousin BlackBerry Desktop Manager. In this book, we 
focus mainly on the PC version of BlackBerry Desktop Manager, but we also 
show screenshots of the Mac version of the application in different areas to 
let you Mac users out there know that you can do the same tasks in the Mac 
BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
	
If you’re using a corporate BlackBerry Curve that’s running under BlackBerry 
Enterprise Server, you can skip this chapter. BlackBerry smartphones running 
under BlackBerry Enterprise Server synchronize over the air (OTA), via serial 
bypass, or wirelessly.

268
Part V: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
Meeting BlackBerry Desktop Manager
The centerpiece of your desktop activities — such as data synchronization, 
switching smartphones, and data backup on the BlackBerry — is BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager, which is a suite of programs that includes the following:
	
✓	Application Loader: Installs BlackBerry applications and updates the 
BlackBerry OS.
	
✓	Backup and Restore: Backs up your Curve data and settings. Check out 
Chapter 18 for details.
	
✓	Synchronize: Synchronizes Curve data with your PC (um, the topic of 
this chapter).
	
✓	Media Manager: Uploads media files to your Curve from your PC and 
vice versa (another topic in this chapter).
	
✓	Device Switch Wizard: Helps you transfer data from your existing 
mobile device to your Curve. See Chapter 17 for details.
BlackBerry Desktop Manager is software loaded on the CD that comes with 
your Curve. Your Curve’s packaging provides instructions on how to install 
BlackBerry Desktop Manager on your desktop computer. For corporate 
users, check with your BlackBerry system administrator for more details.
Installing BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
and Desktop Redirector
As we mention, use the CD that comes with your Curve to install BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager on your computer. At the same time, you can also install 
Desktop Redirector. (Read more about this in Chapter 8.) Desktop Redirector 
allows you to redirect e-mail that you receive in Outlook. This means that 
even if you get e-mails through Outlook (such as work e-mails), you can have 
those e-mails redirected to your Curve.
	
Only e-mails from mailboxes connected to your Outlook mailbox are redi­
rected. Your PC and the redirector must run all the time to keep redirection 
active.
When you insert the CD, the installation wizard runs automatically. Follow 
the onscreen instructions. On one of the wizard screens, you choose whether 
this installation is for personal or work e-mail. Choosing the option for work 
e-mail enables you to use Desktop Redirector for both personal and work 
e-mail.

269
 Chapter 16: Syncing the Synchronize Way
	
If you aren’t using a corporate BlackBerry Enterprise Server, and you want to 
redirect your Outlook e-mail to your Curve, when you’re installing BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager, make sure that you select the Redirect Messages Using the 
BlackBerry Desktop Redirector option on the installation screen, as shown in 
Figure 16-1.
	
Figure 16-1:

If your Curve is running under a corporate BlackBerry Enterprise Server, your 
e-mail is already redirected to your smartphone wirelessly, and choosing the 
BlackBerry Desktop Redirector could really mess things up. So don’t do it! 
Most companies are protective of corporate data, including your work e-mails. 
Make sure you aren’t violating your company’s policy before you decide to 
redirect your work e-mails to your personal BlackBerry.
Launching BlackBerry Desktop Manager
In most Windows installations, you find the shortcut to launch BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager through your computer’s Start menu. Follow these steps to 
launch BlackBerry Desktop Manager:
	
1.	Choose Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
	
2.	Connect your Curve to your computer, using the USB cable that came 
with your device.
	
	 With the microSD card in your Curve, upon connecting to your PC, your 
Curve screen displays a prompt for enabling mass storage mode. It also 
asks for your Curve’s password when you answer Yes to the prompt. 
Upon answering Yes and entering your password, your Curve will 
behave like a flash drive. A drive letter will be added to My Computer 

270

(or just plain Computer in Microsoft Vista) in Windows Explorer, allow­
ing you to treat the microSD card as a normal flash drive.
	
3.	Launch BlackBerry Desktop Manager.

 Chapter 16: Syncing the Synchronize Way
BlackBerry Desktop Manager installation can vary from phone provider to 
provider. You should see at least the following four icons, or applications:
	
✓	Application Loader (see Chapter 19)
	
✓	Backup and Restore (see Chapter 18)
	
✓	Media (see Chapter 15)
	
✓	Synchronize
Connecting BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager to your Curve
You establish a connection between your Curve and BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager through the USB cable. After BlackBerry Desktop Manager is running, 
it tries to find a BlackBerry (your Curve) on the type of connection specified. 
The default connection is USB, so you shouldn’t need to configure anything.
Follow these steps to connect your Curve to BlackBerry Desktop Manager:
	
1.	Plug in your device to your desktop.
	
	 Keep your device on.
	
2.	Launch BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
	
	 BlackBerry Desktop Manager tries to find a BlackBerry (your Curve) on a 
USB connection.
	
3.	If your device has a password, BlackBerry Desktop Manager prompts 
you for the password.
	
4.	Enter the password.
	
	 You see Connected as the screen heading. If, for some reason, you 
see Disconnected and no password prompt, one of the following is 
happening:
 
• BlackBerry Desktop Manager can’t find the device being con­
nected via the USB cable. Make sure that the USB cable is properly 
attached at both ends.
 
• The connection setting isn’t set to use USB. To check this connec­
tivity setting, go to Step 5.
	
5.	Choose Options➪Connection Options on the right side of the 
BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen.
	
	 The screen shown in Figure 16-4 appears. Make sure that the connection 
setting uses USB.

Running BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager for the first time
If you’re running BlackBerry Desktop Manager for the first time, the program 
does the following:
	
✓	Tries to make the initial configuration on your machine, which includes 
security encryption setup. It asks you to randomly move your mouse to 
generate security encryption keys.
	
✓	Checks which applications are on your device and which required appli­
cations need to be installed. If it can’t find a required application on 
your device, it prompts you to install it. Of course, you have the option 
to cancel and install later.
	
✓	Looks at the settings you have for your Synchronize software. If auto­
synchronization is turned on, BlackBerry Desktop Manager attempts 
to run synchronization for your PIM. This is discussed in the section 
“Synchronizing automatically,” later in this chapter.
Setting Up Synchronize
Synchronize is the part of BlackBerry Desktop Manager that allows you to 
synchronize your data between your desktop computer and your Curve. (If 
your Curve is running on BlackBerry Enterprise Server, your data is already 
synced wirelessly, so you don’t need your desktop for synchronization.) 
Synchronize is an icon on the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen with two 
opposing arrows on top of two paper images. To launch Synchronize, simply 
double-click its icon. A screen like the one shown in Figure 16-5 appears.

 Chapter 16: Syncing the Synchronize Way
	
Figure 16-5: 
The 
Synchronize 
screen.
	
The Synchronize screen is divided into two sections. You can navigate 
through the links on the left:
	
✓	Synchronize, the default view, allows you to manually trigger synchroni­
zation (refer to Figure 16-5). See the “Using on-demand synchronization” 
and “Synchronizing Automatically” sections, later in this chapter, for 
more details and for when you use this screen.
	
✓	Configuration is where you can set up configuration and rules for reconcil­
ing data. Under the Configuration link are two subsections, Synchronization 
and Add-ins. These further help you organize the interface (see Figure 16-6). 
The first thing you need to work with is the Synchronization Configuration 
screen. The following section helps you do that.
Configuring PIM synchronization
The important item in the Synchronization Configuration subsection, as 
shown in Figure 16-6, is the Synchronization button. You use that button to 
configure PIM synchronization.
Click the Synchronization button to display the screen shown in Figure 16-7. 
You can see that the names correspond to the BlackBerry Curve applications, 
except for Contacts, which goes by the name Address Book. This screen is 
the entry point of the entire synchronization configuration for PIM applica­
tions. Selecting an application on this screen allows you to pair the PIM hand­
held application to a desktop application (most likely Outlook).

From the PIM configuration screen, select which application data you want to 
sync with your Curve. The following popular PIM applications can be synced 
to your Curve: ACT!, ASCII Text File Converter, Lotus Notes, Lotus Organizer, 
Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Microsoft Schedule.

275
 Chapter 16: Syncing the Synchronize Way
The types of application data that can be synchronized to your Curve are
	
✓	Calendar: Synchronize your appointments and events stored in your 
favorite PIM application.
	
✓	MemoPad: Synchronize any notes or text that you have been storing in 
your PIM application.
	
✓	Address Book: Synchronize any contact information with your Curve.
	
✓	Tasks: Synchronize your to-do list.
Follow these steps to set up your device’s synchronization:
	
1.	Connect your Curve to BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
	
2.	Click the Synchronize icon.
	
3.	Click the Synchronization link.
	
	 (The link is below the Configuration link on the left side of the screen; 
refer to Figure 16-6.) In the Synchronization Configuration section is the 
Configure Synchronization Settings for My Desktop Program label.
	
4.	Click the Synchronization button.
	
5.	Select the check box next to an application data type (Calendar, 
MemoPad, Address Book, or Tasks) that you want to synchronize.
	
	For example, we selected the Calendar application data type.
	
6.	Click the Setup button.
	
	 This opens the Calendar Setup screen.
	
7.	Select a PIM application from which to retrieve application data by 
clicking your desired application.
	
	 BlackBerry Desktop Manager pulls your selected application data from 
the application selected from this screen. In Figure 16-8, we selected 
Microsoft Outlook. This means that when we synchronize the Curve, 
BlackBerry Desktop Manager retrieves Calendar data from Microsoft 
Outlook.
	
8.	Click Next.
	
9.	 On the Synchronization Options screen that opens, select which direc­
tion the synchronization will follow (see Figures 16-9 and 16-10).
	
	 Here are the three available synchronization options:
	
•	Two Way Sync allows you to synchronize changes in both your 
Curve and in your desktop application.

276
Part V: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
• One Way Sync from Device synchronizes only the changes made to 
your Curve. Changes to your desktop application aren’t reflected 
in your Curve.
	
•	One Way Sync to Device synchronizes changes made in your desk­
top application with your Curve. Any changes made in your Curve 
aren’t reflected in your desktop application.

278
Part V: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
	 For synchronization to Microsoft Outlook, make sure that you select the 
correct user profile in the Outlook User Profile drop-down list. This is 
particularly pertinent in cases in which you have multiple user profiles 
in your computer. Choosing the wrong one may result in putting the 
wrong data into your Curve.
	
	 The amount of data that is reconciled or synchronized in a given appli­
cation can also be controlled. For example, as shown in Figure 16-11, 
the center portion of the configuration allows you to specify whether 
to transfer all Calendar items, transfer just a set of appointments in the 
future, or transfer items within a range of dates you enter.
	
	 Select the Remove Alarm for Past Items check box if you don’t want to 
keep the alarm setting for events that have already occurred.
	
11.	Click Next and then click Finish.
	
	 Clicking the Next button brings you to the Calendar Setup Finish screen, 
and clicking the Finish button completes configuring the Calendar syn­
chronization you selected.
Mapping fields for synchronization
For all four PIM applications, Synchronize is intelligent enough to know what 
information — such as names, phone numbers, and addresses in Contacts — 
corresponds to Outlook. A specific bit of information, or attribute, is a field. 
For instance, the value of a home phone number field in Contacts needs to 
be mapped to the corresponding field in Outlook so that information is trans­
ferred correctly.
But not all fields on the desktop side exist on the handheld (and vice versa). 
For example, a Nick Name field doesn’t exist in Curve Contacts but is avail­
able in Exchange (Outlook) Address Book. In some instances, Synchronize 
provides an alternative field and lets you decide whether to map it.
If you ever need to change the default mapping, you can. The interface is the 
same for all PIM applications. To illustrate how to map and unmap fields, we 
use Contacts in the following steps :
	
1.	From BlackBerry Desktop Manager, click the Synchronize link.
	
	 The Synchronize screen appears.
	
2.	Click the Synchronization link.
	
3.	Click the Synchronize button.
	
	 The PIM configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 16-7).

279
 Chapter 16: Syncing the Synchronize Way
	
4.	Select the Address Book check box.
	
	 The Advanced button is enabled.
	
5.	Click the Advanced button.
	
	 The Advanced screen opens, as shown in Figure 16-12.
	
Figure 16-12:

6.	Click the Map Fields button.
	
	 The Map Fields screen for the Address Book/Contacts application 
appears (see Figure 16-13). To map or unmap, click the arrow icons.
	
	 If you aren’t careful, you can inadvertently unclick a mapping (such as 
Job Title), and suddenly your titles aren’t in sync. Double-check your 
mapping before you click OK. If you think you made a mistake, click 
Cancel to save yourself from having to restore settings.
	
7.	Click OK to save your changes.

Confirming record changes
Face facts: Doing a desktop synchronization isn’t a very interesting task, and 
few people perform it on a regular basis.
You can tell Synchronize to prompt you for any changes it’s trying to make 
(or perhaps undo) on either side of the fence. The Advanced screen comes 
into picture here. To get to this view, follow these steps:
	
1.	From BlackBerry Desktop Manager, click the Synchronize link.
	
	 The Synchronize screen appears.
	
2.	 Click the Synchronization link.
	
3.	Click the Synchronize button.
	
	 The PIM configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 16-7).
	
4.	Select the Address Book check box.
	
	 If you want a PIM application other than Address Book, select that 
application from the list.
	
5.	Click the Advanced button.
	
	 The Advanced screen for Address Book appears (refer to Figure 16-12). 
This screen has a Confirmations section and gives you two options:
 
• Confirm Record Deletions (Recommended)
 
• Confirm Changes and Additions (Recommended)
	
	 Regardless of whether you select the first option, Synchronize displays a 
prompt if it detects that it’s about to delete all records.

281
 Chapter 16: Syncing the Synchronize Way
Resolving update conflicts
Synchronize needs to know how you want to handle any conflicts between 
your Curve and your desktop application. A conflict normally happens when 
the same record is updated on your Curve and also in Outlook. For instance, 
you change Jane Doe’s mobile number on both your Curve and PC in Outlook. 
Where you resolve these conflicts is the same for all PIM applications. Again, 
for illustration, we use Address Book as an example:
	
1.	From BlackBerry Desktop Manager, click the Synchronize link.
	
	 The Synchronize screen appears.
	
2.	Click the Synchronization link.
	
3.	Click the Synchronize button.
	
	 The PIM configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 16-7).
	
4.	Select the Address Book check box.
	
	 If you want a PIM application other than Address Book, select that appli­
cation from the list.
	
5.	Click the Advanced button.
	
	 The Advanced screen for Address Book appears (refer to Figure 16-12). 
This screen has five sections, and the third section is Conflict Resolution.
	
6.	Click the Conflict Resolution button.
	
	 The Conflict Resolution screen is shown in Figure 16-14. From the 
Conflict Resolution screen, you can tell Synchronize to handle conflicts 
in a few ways. Here are the options:
 
• Add All Conflicting Items: When a conflict happens, adds a new 
record to the Curve for the changes on the desktop, and adds a 
new record to the desktop for the changes on the Curve.
 
• Ignore All Conflicting Items: Ignores the change and keeps the data 
the same on both sides.
 
• Notify Me When Conflicts Occur: This option is the safest. Synchronize 
displays the details of the conflict and lets you resolve it.
 
• Device Wins: Unless you’re sure this is the case, you shouldn’t 
choose this option. It tells Synchronize to disregard the changes in 
the desktop and use handheld changes every time it encounters a 
conflict.
 
• Microsoft Outlook Wins: If you aren’t using MS Outlook, this 
option is based on your application. This option tells Synchronize 
to always discard changes on the handheld and use the desktop 
application change when it encounters a conflict. We don’t recom­
mend this option, because there’s no telling on which side you 
made the good update.

Ready, Set, Synchronize!
Are you ready to synchronize? Previously in this chapter, we show you ways 
to define synchronization filters and rules for your e-mail and PIM data. Now 
it’s time to be brave and click the button. You can synchronize in one of two 
ways:
	
✓	Manually: Click the Synchronize Now icon.
	
✓	Automatically: Choose How Often on the calendar.
Using on-demand synchronization
On-demand synchronization is a feature in Synchronize that lets you run syn­
chronization manually. Remember that even if you set up automatic synchro­
nization, actual synchronization doesn’t happen right away. So if you make 
updates to your appointments in Outlook while your Curve is connected to 
your PC, this feature allows you to be sure that your updates make it to your 
Curve before heading out the door.
Without delay, here are the steps:
	
1.	From BlackBerry Desktop Manager, click the Synchronize link.
	
	 The Synchronize screen appears (refer to Figure 16-5). The following 
four check boxes let you be selective:
 
• Reconcile Messages: Synchronize your e-mails between Outlook 
and your Curve.

283
 Chapter 16: Syncing the Synchronize Way
 
• Synchronize Organizer Data: Include notes, appointments, 
addresses, and tasks.
 
• Run Add-in Actions: You have third-party applications that require 
data synchronization between your PC and your Curve.
 
• Update Device Date and Time: You want both the PC and Curve 
to have the same time. This ensures that you’re reminded of your 
appointments at the same time for both Outlook and your Curve.
	
2.	Select the check boxes for the data you want to synchronize.
	
3.	Click the Synchronize button.
	
	 Synchronize starts running the synchronization, and you see a progress 
screen. If you set up prompts for conflicts, and Synchronize encounters 
one, a screen appears so that you can resolve that conflict. When finished, 
the progress screen disappears and the Synchronize screen reappears.
	
	 If you turned on automatic synchronization (see the next section), the 
items you select in Step 2 automatically sync every time you connect 
your Curve to your PC.
	
4.	Click the Close button.
Synchronizing automatically
How many times do you think you reconfigure your Synchronize setup? 
Rarely, right? After you have it configured, that’s it. And if you’re like us, the 
reason you open BlackBerry Desktop Manager is because you want to run 
Synchronize. So opening Synchronize and clicking the Synchronize button 
are somewhat annoying.
	
To make Synchronize run automatically every time you connect your Curve 
to your PC, simply make sure that you select the last check box on the 
Synchronize screen (refer to Figure 16-5) — Synchronize the Selected Items 
When Your Device Is Connected to the BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
You may be asking, “What items will autosynchronization sync?” Good ques­
tion. Synchronize automatically syncs the items you selected in the top por­
tion of the Synchronize screen. Note that if you make a change, selecting or 
deselecting an item on the Synchronize screen, only the selected items will 
be synced automatically the next time you connect your Curve to your PC.

W
ouldn’t it be nice if you could just make one device’s data available to 
another? That’s the future. But right now, RIM (Research In Motion) 
wants to make switching devices as painless as possible. That’s why Device 
Switch Wizard is part of the suite of applications in BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager.
Device Switch exists in Windows, but we’re sure that by the time you read this, 
a Mac version will be available. We included screenshots of the prerelease ver­
sion of Device Switch on the Mac, but be aware that the actual release version 
may differ slightly.
Switching to a New BlackBerry
Switching from an older BlackBerry to your new Curve is no big deal. When 
you want to transfer application data (e-mails and contacts, for example) to 
your new Curve, BlackBerry Desktop Manager Device Switch Wizard backs up 
your old BlackBerry and loads that backup to your new device.
On your PC, the following steps help you transition from your old device to 
your new BlackBerry Curve:
	
1.	On your PC, choose Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
	
	 The Desktop Manager screen opens, where you can find Device Switch 
Wizard, as shown in Figure 17-1.
	
2.	Click the Device Switch Wizard icon.
	
	 The Device Switch Wizard screen lets you choose whether to switch 
from BlackBerry to BlackBerry Curve or from non-BlackBerry to 
BlackBerry Curve. The BlackBerry-to-BlackBerry section tells you to con­
nect your current (old) BlackBerry to your PC.

3.	Connect your old BlackBerry to your PC with the USB cable.
	
	 Keep your BlackBerry on when connecting.
	
4.	Click the Start button below Switch BlackBerry Devices.
	
	 The next screen lets you verify the PINs for both devices — the old 
BlackBerry on the left and your new Curve on the right, as shown in 
Figure 17-2. Because you connected only your old BlackBerry, it should 
be preselected.
	
	 Your BlackBerry PIN isn’t a password — it’s your BlackBerry smart­
phone identifier. You can find the PIN by choosing Options➪Status on 
your BlackBerry.
	
5.	Decide whether to include user data and third-party applications and 
then click Next.
	
	 If you want all the data, leave the screen untouched; this backs up every­
thing. Third-party applications are all the programs you installed — the 
ones that didn’t come with the device originally.
	
	 A status screen appears, showing the progress of the backup operation. 
When the backup is finished, the next screen prompts you to connect 
your new BlackBerry Curve.
	
6.	Connect your BlackBerry Curve to your PC with the USB cable.
	
	 The next screen, as shown in Figure 17-3, lets you verify that your Curve is 
connected properly, with your Curve’s PIN preselected in the drop-down

list. It also asks for the password. Because data is already backed up from 
the old BlackBerry, the old device is no longer needed on succeeding 
steps, and it doesn’t matter whether you keep the old one connected.

device. Nothing has been done to your new BlackBerry Curve yet, and 
this is your last chance to cancel the process.

Switching from a Non-BlackBerry Device
This section is applicable only to Windows. The prerelease version of 
BlackBerry Desktop Manager on the Mac does not show support for any 
other devices.
Device Switch Wizard supports two types of non-BlackBerry devices:
	
✓	Palm
	
✓	Microsoft Windows Mobile
This doesn’t mean that you can’t import your old data if you have another 
device; Device Switch Wizard just makes it simpler for these two types of 
devices. Check Chapter 16 for synchronization options for your Desktop PIM 
application if your old device is neither a Palm nor a Microsoft Windows 
Mobile device.
Palm device requirements
Your PC and Palm have to meet three prerequisites for Device Switch Wizard 
to import data from Palm to your BlackBerry Curve:
	
✓	Your PC must be running Windows 2000 or later.
	
✓	One of the following Palm Desktop Software versions must be installed 
on your desktop: 4.0.1, 4.1, 4.1.4, or 6.0.1.
	
✓	The Palm Desktop software installed is synchronizing properly with the 
Palm device.

290
Part V: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
You can check your Palm user guide for more details about your Palm device 
and synchronizing it to your PC. You can also download the user guide from 
www.palm.com/us/support/index.hml. Navigate to this page by selecting 
the Palm model you have and the wireless network provider on which it runs.
Windows Mobile device requirements
You need the following for Device Switch Wizard to work properly with a 
Windows Mobile device:
	
✓	Your PC must be running Windows 2000 or later.
	
✓	Microsoft ActiveSync versions must be installed on your PC.
	
✓	The mobile device must run one of the following operating systems: 
Microsoft Windows Mobile 2000, 2002, 2003, 2003SE, or 2005/5.0 for 
Pocket PC or Microsoft Windows Mobile SmartPhone software 2002, 
2003, or 2003 SE.
Running the wizard
Before you run the wizard, make sure that all the requirements for your 
device are in place.
	
We recommend hot-syncing or synchronizing your Palm or Windows Mobile 
device; this ensures that the data you’re sending to your Curve is current. 
Palm Desktop Software, as well as Microsoft ActiveSync, should come with 
help information on how to hot-sync.
Although the following steps migrate Windows Mobile data to the Curve, the 
steps are similar for Palm. We indicate at what point the steps vary. Do the 
following to get your other device’s data migrated to your new Curve:
	
1.	Connect both the Windows Mobile device and BlackBerry Curve to 
your desktop computer.
	
2.	On your PC, choose Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
	
	 The Desktop Manager screen appears (refer to Figure 17-1).
	
3.	Click the Device Switch Wizard icon.
	
4.	When Device Switch Wizard appears, click the image next to Switch 
from Another Device to BlackBerry Device.
	
	 The Welcome screen, as shown in Figure 17-7, describes what the tool 
can do.

5.	Click Next.
	
	 A screen prompts you to decide whether you’re migrating from Palm

a series of screens for each of the application’s data, such as Calendar, 
Contacts, and MemoPad. A sample for the Calendar data is shown in 
Figure 17-9. The screen indicates what to sync and will be empty if you 
already performed a hot-sync before running the wizard. Otherwise, 
it will take some time, depending on how much data there is to sync 
between the device and the desktop software.

following buttons on this screen to either confirm or reject the change:
 
• Details: You want to know the records the wizard is trying to apply.
 
• Accept: You just want the data migrated.

I
magine that you left your beautiful Curve in the back of a cab. You lost 
your Curve for good! Okay, not so good. What happens to all your informa­
tion? How will you replace all those contacts? What about security?
Take a deep breath, and relax a bit. One thing you don’t need to worry about 
is information security — if you set up a security password on your Curve, 
that is. With security password protection enabled, anyone who finds your 
Curve has only ten chances to enter the correct password; after those ten 
chances are up, it’s self-destruction time. Although the conclusion isn’t as 
smoky as those self-destructing tapes from Mission Impossible, your Curve 
does erase all its information, thwarting your would-be data thief. Sad but 
safe.
	
If you haven’t set up a password for your Curve, do it now! For information on 
how to do so, see Chapter 3.
Hmm. But how do you get back all the information that was on your Curve? 
That’s what this chapter is all about. Vital information — clients’ and friends’ 
contact information; notes from phone calls with clients; and, of course, 
those precious e-mail messages — shouldn’t be taken lightly. Backing up this 
information is a reliable way to protect it from being lost forever.

294
Part V: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
If your Curve isn’t on a BlackBerry Enterprise Server, BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager is the only way to back up and restore information 
to and from your desktop PC. And SmrtGuard (pronounced smart guard) 
offers a wireless backup and restore service if you don’t have the 
habit of plugging your Curve into your PC. If that sounds like you, go to 
the end of this chapter to find an introduction to SmrtGuard’s backup 
and restore solution, which can give you peace of mind when it comes 
to protecting your data.
Accessing Backup and Restore
Backup and Restore — a BlackBerry Desktop Manager application — allows 
you to back up all the sensitive data on your Curve, including contacts, 
e-mails, memos, to-do’s, and personal preferences and options.
For most users, your e-mails are already stored in accounts, such as Gmail or 
Yahoo! Mail. But you can still back up e-mails just in case.
To back up information on your Curve, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open BlackBerry Desktop Manager on your PC by choosing Start➪
All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
	
	 If you haven’t already installed BlackBerry Desktop Manager on your PC, 
see Chapter 16.
	
2.	Connect your Curve to your PC with the USB cable that came with 
your Curve.
	
	 If everything is set up right, a pop-up window on your PC asks you 
to type your BlackBerry security password. Make sure your Curve is 
turned on.
	
3.	Type your password.
	
	 The Curve connects to the PC.
	
4.	On the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen, double-click the Backup 
and Restore icon.
	
	 The Backup and Restore screen opens (see Figure 18-1). You’re ready to

Backing Up, BlackBerry Style
Everyone knows that backing up data provides tremendous peace of mind. So 
do the folks at RIM, which is why backing up your information is quite easy. 
You can back up your Curve manually or by autopilot.
Backing up your Curve manually
To back up your Curve on demand, follow these steps:
	
1.	Connect your Curve to your PC with the USB cable. Then, from the 
PC’s BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen, double-click the Backup 
and Restore icon.
	
	 The Backup and Restore screen appears (refer to Figure 18-1).
	
2.	Click the Back Up button.
	
	 The dialog box shown in Figure 18-2 appears, where you can name the 
backup file and figure out where on your PC you want to save it.

296

Name and 
find a home 
for your 
backup file.
	
	
3.	Name your backup file, and choose a place to save it.
	
4.	Click Save.
	
	BlackBerry Desktop Manager starts backing up your Curve information 
to your PC. Figure 18-3 shows the backup progress in the Transfer in 
Progress window. Depending on how much information you have on 
your Curve, the backup might take ten minutes to finish.
	
Figure 18-3: 
A backup is 
in progress.
	
	
	 Don’t unplug your Curve from the PC until the backup is finished!
	
5.	When the Transfer in Progress window disappears, unplug the Curve 
from the PC.
Setting up automatic backups
What’s better than backing up your information once? Remembering to back 
up regularly! And what’s better than backing up regularly? You guessed it — 
running backups automatically. After you schedule automated BlackBerry 
backups, you can really have peace of mind when it comes to preventing 
information loss.

297
 Chapter 18: Protecting Your Information
Follow these steps to set up an automatic backup:
	
1.	From the PC’s BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen, double-click the 
Backup and Restore icon.
	
2.	In the Backup and Restore screen, click the Options button.
	
	 The Backup Options screen appears, where you can schedule automatic 
backups (see Figure 18-4).
	
Figure 18-4: 
Set 
automatic 
backups 
here.
	
	
3.	Select the Back Up My Device Automatically Every xx Days check box.
	
	 Choosing this option allows you to make more decisions (check boxes 
and options become active), such as how often you want BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager to back up your Curve.
	
4.	In the Days field, enter a number of days between 1 and 99.
	
	 This interval sets how often your Curve is backed up. For example, if 
you enter 14, your Curve is backed up every 14 days. Go figure.
	
5.	Select the Back Up All Device Application Data radio button.
	
	This option backs up all the data on your Curve each time autobackup 
runs.
	
	 Although you can exclude e-mail messages and information (such as 
from Contacts, to-do’s, and memos), we recommend that you back 
up everything each time. That way, when it’s time to restore to a new 
BlackBerry, you get everything where you left off, including e-mail.
	
6.	Click OK.
	
	 Now you can go on with your life without worrying when to back up.

298
Part V: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
To run a backup, you must have your Curve connected to your PC. Make sure 
that you plug your Curve into your PC once in a while so that autobackup has 
a chance to back up your information.
Restoring Your Data from 
Backup Information
We hope that you never have to read this section more than once. A full 
restore means bringing back all your BlackBerry information from a previous 
backup stored on your PC.
The steps to fully restoring your backup information are simple:
	
1.	Connect your Curve to your PC using the USB cable. Then, from the 
PC’s BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen, double-click the Backup 
and Restore icon.
	
2.	In the Backup and Restore screen, click the Restore button.
	
	 An Open File dialog box asks where the backup file is on your PC.
	
3.	Choose the desired backup file, and click Open.
	
	A warning window appears when you’re about to do a full restore (see Figure 
18-5), alerting you that you’re about to overwrite existing information.
	
4.	Click Yes to go ahead with the full restore.
	
	 A progress bar appears. It might take a while for the full restore to finish.
	
	 Don’t unplug your BlackBerry from your PC during this time!
	
5.	When the progress bar disappears, unplug the device from the PC.

 Chapter 18: Protecting Your Information
Protecting Your Data, Your Way
A certain burger joint and BlackBerry both say that you can have it your way 
with their products. Just like you can get your burger with or without all the 
toppings and condiments, you can choose to not back up and restore things 
that you know you won’t need.
For example, say you accidentally deleted all your Internet bookmarks, and 
now you want them back. Don’t restore all the information from your last 
backup, which could be more than 90 days ago (depending on how often 
your autobackup runs, if at all). You may unintentionally overwrite other 
information, such as e-mail or new contacts. You want to restore bookmarks 
only.
If you lose something in particular or want something specific restored on 
your Curve, use the selective backup and restore function in BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager to restore only what you need. The same goes with backing 
up. If you’re a big e-mail user, back up just your e-mails, nothing else.
	
In the following sections, we use the term databases. Don’t worry; this isn’t as 
technical as you think. Just think of a database as an information category on 
your Curve. For example, saying “backing up your Browser bookmarks data­
base” is just a fancy way of saying “backing up all your Browser bookmarks on 
your Curve.”
Backing up, your way
To back up specific information — selectively — follow these steps:
	
1.	Connect your Curve to your PC using the USB cable. Then, from the 
PC’s BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen, double-click the Backup 
and Restore icon.
	
2.	In the Backup and Restore screen, click the Advanced button.
	
	 The advanced Backup/Restore screen appears, as shown in Figure 18-6. 
The right side of the screen shows different information categories, or 
databases.
	
3.	In the Device Databases list on the right side, Ctrl+click the databases 
you want to back up.
	
4.	Click the left-pointing (backup) double arrow.
	
	 This step merely transfers the databases onto your PC; it doesn’t save 
them. That’s next.
	
	 A progress bar moves while your Curve is backed up. When the backup 
transfer is finished, you can see the databases on the left side.

300
Part V: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
Figure 18-6:

screen.
	
	
5.	Choose File➪Save As.
	
	A file chooser appears.
	
6.	Name your file, specify where you want to save it on your PC, and 
click Save.
	
	 Make sure to name the file something specific so that you know exactly 
what is in the backup.
	
You need to manually save the backup file on your PC even after you choose a 
location for the file in Step 6. Remember that a selective backup doesn’t auto­
matically save your backup on your PC.
Looking at backup BlackBerry files
Whether you use the one-button backup 
method or manually back up your files, backup 
files are saved on your PC as IPD files. Are you 
asking, “Can I read these backup files without 
a BlackBerry?” The answer is yes! With the 
third-party product ABC Amber BlackBerry 
Converter, you can view any nonencrypted IPD 
file. What’s the point? Suppose you lost your 
BlackBerry but need to read an old e-mail or 
get contacts from your backup files. This tool 
allows you to convert anything in your backup 
file (e-mails, SMS messages, PIM messages, 
and contacts) to PDF or Word documents.

BlackBerry Converter for free, go to www.

 Chapter 18: Protecting Your Information
Restoring, your way
When you’re restoring selectively, you must already have a backup file to 
restore from. Although this may sound obvious, the point here is that you 
can selectively restore from any backup — auto or manual.
For example, say you have autobackup running every other day, and you 
want to restore only your e-mail messages from two days ago. You don’t 
need to do a full restore; that would overwrite that new contact you put in 
Contacts yesterday. Rather, you can use the selective restore method and get 
back only your e-mail messages.
To restore your way, follow these steps:
	
1.	Connect your Curve to your PC with the USB cable. Then, from the 
PC’s BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen, double-click the Backup 
and Restore icon.
	
2.	In the Backup and Restore screen, click the Advanced button.
	
	 The advanced Backup/Restore screen appears (refer to Figure 18-6). The 
right side of the screen shows your different information categories, or 
databases.
	
3.	Choose File➪Open.
	
	 A window opens so that you can choose which backup file you want to 
restore from.
	
	 A BlackBerry backup file has the .ipd extension.
	
4.	Select a backup file.
	
5.	Click Open.
	
	 The different information categories, or databases, appear on the left 
side of the screen. You are now ready for a selective restore.
	
6.	Select the database(s) you want to restore.
	
	 You can select multiple databases by Ctrl+clicking the databases you 
want.
	
7.	Click the right-pointing (restore) double arrow.
	
	You see a warning window asking whether you want to replace all the 
information with the data you’re restoring (refer to Figure 18-5).
	
	 If your Curve has the same categories as the ones you’re restoring 
(which is likely), you’ll overwrite any information you have on your 
Curve.
	
	 You can confidently move on to Step 8 (clicking the Yes button) if you 
know that the database you’re restoring has the information you’re 
looking for.

302
Part V: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
8.	Click Yes.
	
	 A progress bar appears while the selected databases are being restored. 
When the progress bar window disappears, the information categories 
that you selected are restored on your BlackBerry.
Clearing Curve information, your way
You can also selectively delete information on your Curve from BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager. Suppose you want to clear only your phone logs from 
your Curve. One way is to tediously select one phone log at a time and press 
Delete, repeating until all phone logs are gone. However, you could instead 
delete a database from the advanced Backup/Restore screen by using the 
Backup and Restore function.
To selectively delete databases on your Curve, follow these steps:
	
1.	Connect your Curve to your PC with the USB cable. Then, from the 
PC’s BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen, double-click the Backup 
and Restore icon.
	
	 The Backup and Restore screen appears.
	
2.	In the Backup and Restore screen, click the Advanced button.
	
	 The advanced Backup/Restore screen appears (refer to Figure 18-6). The 
right side of the screen shows your Curve’s databases.
	
3.	Ctrl+click the database(s) you want to delete.
	
	 The database is highlighted.
	
4.	 Click the Clear button on the right side of the screen.
	
	A warning window asks you to confirm your deletion.
	
5.	Click Yes.
	
	A progress bar shows the deletion. When the progress bar disappears, 
the information categories you selected are cleared from your Curve.
Backup and Restore Wirelessly
You can even back up and restore wirelessly without being on the BES or 
going through the trouble of plugging your Curve to your PC via BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager. However, you do have to pay a little bit for this service.
SmrtGuard (www.smrtguard.com/smrtguard.jsp) offers software 
you can install on your BlackBerry that can wirelessly back up your data. 
Currently, SmrtGuard supports backing up contacts, memos, calendar items, 
call logs, to-do’s, SMS, and e-mails.

303
 Chapter 18: Protecting Your Information
In addition to its backup and restore capabilities, SmrtGuard has features to 
help you locate, recover, and destroy data on your device. SmrtGuard has 
a BlackBerry tracking feature (a similar concept to LoJack for cars), which 
helps you determine whether you simply misplaced your device or your 
device was stolen. If you determine that your device was stolen, you can send 
a signal to have your data destroyed via the SmrtGuard Dashboard on the 
SmrtGuard Web site.
SmrtGuard has three pricing plans:
	
✓	Monthly plan: $3.99 a month
	
✓	6-month plan: $22.99
	
✓	12-month plan: $44.99

▶	Installing a BlackBerry Curve application
▶	Uninstalling applications
▶	Upgrading your Curve’s operating system
▶	Installing app store applications
▶	Managing applications on the Mac
T
hink of your Curve as a minilaptop where you can run preinstalled appli­
cations as well as install new applications. You can even upgrade the 
operating system. (Yup, that’s right — your Curve has an OS.)
This chapter starts by introducing Application Loader, which you use to load 
applications (who’d have guessed?) onto your Curve. Next, you find ways to 
install and uninstall apps to and from your Curve. Then we explore the por­
tion of Application Loader that allows you to upgrade the OS.
This chapter describes Application Loader, which is available only under 
Windows. As of this writing, BlackBerry Desktop Manager for the Mac is not 
yet available. The screenshots you see in this book and toward the end of 
this chapter are based on a prerelease version, which is subject to change. If 
you are a Mac user, some of the topics discussed in this chapter that relate 
to Application Loader will not be applicable to you. However, other topics 
should be able to assist you with regard to installing and uninstalling applica­
tions on your Curve.
	
In the Part of Tens, you’ll find a few great applications that make your 
BlackBerry Curve that much more productive.

306
Part V: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
Accessing Application Loader
In this chapter, you work closely with your PC and your Curve. On your PC, 
you use the BlackBerry Desktop Manager application, which comes on a 
CD along with your Curve. You can find Application Loader in BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager.
	
For an introduction to BlackBerry Desktop Manager, see Chapter 16.
After installing BlackBerry Desktop Manager on your PC, do the following to 
access Application Loader:
	
1.	On your PC, choose Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop 
Manager.
	
2.	In BlackBerry Desktop Manager, connect your Curve to your PC via 
your USB cable.
	
	If the connection is successful, you see the password dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 19-1.
	
Figure 19-1: 
The pass-
word dialog 
box on your 
PC.
	
	
	 If the connection isn’t successful, see whether the USB cable is con­
nected properly to both your PC and your Curve and then try again. If 
all else fails, contact the technical support department of your service 
provider.
	
3.	Enter your password.
	
	Your Curve-to-PC connection is complete.
	
4.	On your PC, double-click the Application Loader icon in BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager.
	
	The Application Loader screen opens, as shown in Figure 19-2. At this 
point, you’re ready to use Application Loader.

Installing an Application
	
In this chapter, we show you how to install iSkoot for Skype for BlackBerry. 
iSkoot is a free application that connects to the Web directly and allows you to 
use Skype. You can download this application at
www.download.com/iSkoot-for-Skype-BlackBerry-/3000-7242_4-10797721.html
No matter what application you’re installing from your PC to your Curve, the 
steps are the same. Use the following steps as a guide to installing the appli­
cation of your choice:
	
1.	Install the application on your PC.
	
	 The installation varies, so refer to the manual.
	
2.	Locate the application’s ALX file.
	
	 You can usually find a file with the .alx extension in the folder where 
you installed the application on your PC.
	
	 The ALX file doesn’t get installed on your Curve. It tells Application 
Loader where the actual application file is located on your PC.
	
3.	Double-click the Application Loader icon in BlackBerry Desktop 
Manager.
	
	The Application Loader screen appears (refer to Figure 19-2).

308
Part V: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
4.	Connect your Curve to your PC, using the USB cable.
	
	A screen appears, prompting you to enter your Curve password.
	
5.	Enter your password (refer to Figure 19-1).
	
	 After you enter your password, the Application Loader screen indicates 
that your device is connected.
	
6.	Click the Start button below Add/Remove Applications.
	
	 The screen listing of what applications to install appears.
	
7.	Click the Browse button, and locate and select the ALX file you want 
to install.
	
	 You return to the Application Loader screen, where iSkoot is one of the 
applications in the list, as shown in Figure 19-3.
	
Figure 19-3: 
Your 
application 
is added 
to the list 
of installed 
applications 
and can be 
installed on 
your Curve.
	
	
8.	Select the application you want to install (for this example, select 
iSkoot Skype for BlackBerry) and then click Next.
	
	 A summary screen appears, listing only the applications that will be 
installed or upgraded.
	
9.	Click Finish.
	
	 The installation process starts, and a progress window appears. When the 
progress window disappears — and if all went well — the application is on 
your Curve. The application should be in the Applications folder of your 
Curve.

309
 Chapter 19: Installing and Managing Third-Party Applications
If you get an invalid signature error after clicking the Finish button, the solu­
tion depends on how you received your Curve:
	
✓	You didn’t get your Curve from your employer. Something is probably 
wrong with the application. You need to contact the software vendor.
	
✓	You got your Curve from your employer. You don’t have permission to 
install applications on your Curve. The IT department rules the school.
	
You don’t have to use Application Loader to get the goods onto your Curve, 
though. You can install applications in other ways as well:
	
✓	Wirelessly, through an over-the-air (OTA) download: See Chapter 11 
for more on wireless installations.
	
✓	BlackBerry Enterprise Server wireless install (if your Curve was pro­
vided by your employer): In this case, you have no control over the 
installation process. Your company’s BlackBerry system administrator 
controls which applications are on your Curve.
	
✓	Through the PC using Microsoft Installer: Some application installations 
automate the preceding steps. All you need to do is connect your Curve to 
the PC and then double-click the installation file. The application installa­
tion’s file using Microsoft Installer bears the .msi file extension.
Uninstalling an Application
You can uninstall an application in two ways:
	
✓	Using Application Loader
	
✓	Using your Curve
We use iSkoot as an example here and assume that you’ve already installed 
the iSkoot application. You can follow the same steps for uninstalling other 
applications.
Uninstalling with Application Loader
To uninstall a BlackBerry application, follow these steps:
	
1.	On your PC, double-click the Application Loader icon in BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager.
	
2.	Connect your Curve to your PC, using the USB cable.
	
	A screen prompting you to enter your Curve password appears.

310
Part V: Working with BlackBerry Desktop Manager 
	
3.	Enter your password (refer to Figure 19-1).
	
	 If your handheld isn’t connected properly, the PIN of your device won’t 
appear in the Application Loader screen. Connect your Curve to the USB 
cable and then connect the USB cable to the PC.
	
	 After you enter your password, the Application Loader screen indicates 
that your device is connected.
	
4.	Click the Start button below Add/Remove Applications.
	
	 The screen listing applications appears, similar to Figure 19-3, earlier in 
this chapter.
	
5.	Scroll to the application you want to delete and then deselect its 
check box.
	
	 For example, when we deselect the iSkoot Skype for BlackBerry check 
box, the Action column for iSkoot indicates Remove.
	
6.	Click Next.
	
	 You see a summary screen that lists the action of Application Loader. It 
indicates that iSkoot is to be removed from your Curve.
	
7.	Click Finish.
	
	The uninstall process starts, and a progress window appears. When the 
progress window disappears, you have uninstalled the application from 
your Curve.
Uninstalling with your Curve
When you don’t have access to your PC, you can uninstall an application 
directly from your Curve. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Locate the application icon on the BlackBerry Home screen.
	
	 By default, any applications you installed on your Curve are filed in the 
Downloads folder of the Home screen. However, you always have the 
option to move it.
	
2.	Highlight the application icon and then press the menu key.
	
3.	From the menu that appears, select Delete.
	
4.	In the confirmation dialog box that appears, select Delete to confirm 
the deletion.
	
	 You’re given a choice to restart now or at a later time. After restarting, 
the deleted application is uninstalled.

311
 Chapter 19: Installing and Managing Third-Party Applications
Upgrading Your BlackBerry Curve OS
The OS used by Curve has gone through a few revisions. The BlackBerry OS 
update comes from BlackBerry Handheld Software, which is available from 
three sources:
	
✓	Your network service provider
	
✓	The Research In Motion Web site
	
✓	Your BlackBerry system administrator
	
Because the handheld software might differ from provider to provider, we rec­
ommend getting it from the service provider’s Web site. RIM has a download 
site for different service providers at
http://na.blackberry.com/eng/support/downloads/download_sites.jsp
In this section, we assume that the latest BlackBerry Handheld Software for 
Curve is already installed on your PC. For help with installing BlackBerry 
Handheld Software, refer to the instructions that come with it.
	
If you plan to upgrade your BlackBerry OS, and you’ve installed many third-
party applications, check whether those applications support the new OS revi­
sion. Third-party applications work as is most of the time, but there is always 
a possibility of losing third-party application data.
Start the upgrade process by doing the following:
	
1.	Enter your Curve password (if you have set one) into BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager on your PC.
	
2.	Double-click the Application Loader icon on the Desktop Manager 
screen.
	
	The Application Loader screen appears (refer to Figure 19-2).
	
3.	Click the Start button below Add/Remove Applications.
	
	 A list of software appears, as shown in Figure 19-4.
	
4.	With your mouse, you can opt out of the upgrade by deselecting the 
OS portion.
	
	 This appears as BlackBerry 5.0 System Software in Figure 19-4.
	
	The OS is listed only if you need an upgrade — meaning that your 
BlackBerry OS is out of date. If the OS doesn’t appear in the list, the 
handheld software you installed on the desktop machine is the same 
as the one installed on your device or a previous version compared 
with the one installed on your device.

updates 
that are 
available.
	
	
	 You also need to back up your device in case something goes wrong with 
the upgrade. Backup options can be accessed through the Options button.
	
5.	Click Options.
	
	 The Options screen appears, as shown in Figure 19-5. This is where you 
decide whether you want to back up your Curve content before upgrad­
ing your OS. We suggest that you do.
	
Figure 19-5:

6.	Select the Back Up Device Data Automatically During the Installation 
Process check box and then click OK.
	
	 You return to the screen shown in Figure 19-4.
	
7.	Click Next.
	
	A summary page confirms your actions — a final chance for you to pro­
ceed with the OS upgrade or not.

313
 Chapter 19: Installing and Managing Third-Party Applications
	
8.	Click Finish.
	
	 The BlackBerry OS upgrade starts, complete with a progress window 
that shows a series of steps and a progress bar. The entire process takes 
about ten minutes, depending on your PC model and the OS version 
you’re upgrading to.
	
	 At times during the BlackBerry OS upgrade, your Curve’s display goes 
on and off. Don’t worry; this is normal.
	
	 When the progress window disappears, the OS upgrade is complete.
Finding and Installing Applications 
from App Stores
With the success of the iPhone App Store, several copycats sprouted 
up for other platforms, including the BlackBerry. Broadly, an “app store” 
is an online storefront that showcases applications that you can download 
directly to your device. Applications can be free or not:
	
✓	Handango (www.handango.com): Handango is one of the oldest store­
fronts that sells applications for mobile devices. It started selling apps 
through the Web but now has an app store that you can download from 
its Web site.
	
✓	CrackBerry On-Device App Store (http://crackberryappstore.
com): Partnering with MobiHand, CrackBerry also provides an app store 
where you can find great applications to download.
	
✓	BlackBerry Application Center: This is software built by RIM, but the 
carrier has control over what shows up in Application Center.
	
✓	BlackBerry App World: RIM has full control over what applications are 
available. This is in contrast with BlackBerry Application Center, where 
the carrier has control.
	
	If you don’t have App World on your Curve, you can download it from 
the RIM Web site at http://na.blackberry.com/eng/services/
appworld.
Just recently, RIM created a Web version of App World. Using your desktop 
Internet browser, you can visit the site at http://appworld.blackberry.
com/. The site allows you to send an e-mail to your device with a download 
link for the app that you are interested in.

Managing Applications on Your Mac
Again, BlackBerry Desktop Manager for the Mac is not released as of this 
writing. The screen shown in Figure 19-6, which you see when you click the 
Applications button, is based on the prerelease version and is subject to 
change.

he BlackBerry retail box contains a few essentials: a battery, a charger, a 
micro USB cable, a belt clip, and possibly a 1GB microSD card. If you’re 
like most of us, though, you’re not satisfied with what is included in the box. 
In this chapter, you find accessories that supplement your Curve — and find 
out where to get them.
	
Check out our companion Web site, www.blackberryfordummies.com, for 
an updated accessories list.
	
If you like to accessorize your Curve, check out site promotions. Every now 
and then, a site such as CrackBerry.com runs promotions and gives big dis­
counts. Also look at RIM’s Web site at www.shopblackberry.com. It usually 
offers accessory bundles.

Unify AV Solution
Unify AV Solution is an innovative product of Unify4Life that makes a smart­
phone (including your BlackBerry) a universal remote control.
You can find a suite of features on the Unify4Life Web site, but a sample 
includes complete TV listings in your BlackBerry for informative channel 
switching. You can purchase it directly from http://unify4life.com/
products.html.
microSD Card
Your new BlackBerry normally comes with external memory: a microSD card. 
But if you’re not satisfied with its capacity, go hunt for a much bigger one. 
After all, you want to carry with you a boatload of music and video files, 
right? Many electronic gadgets use microSD cards, so they’re easy to find.
A normal price range at the time of this writing is $20 for 8GB capacity and 
$40 for 16GB capacity. Special promotions come and go, but you can always 
find a good deal somewhere on the Internet. And for any Internet purchase, 
take into consideration the shipping and handling costs plus the vendor’s 
return policy (or lack thereof).
	
Any brand will do, as long as you make sure that you’re buying a microSD card.
Full Keyboards
As netbooks become more popular, people forget that the BlackBerry they 
already carry is a “mini netbook.” Internet? Check! E-mail? Check! Microsoft 
Word docs and Microsoft Excel? Check! Sure, the screen is a bit smaller, and 
the keyboard is small, but with a little help from a Bluetooth keyboard, your 
BlackBerry will save you the cost of a netbook and still be productive.
We recommend the pFreedom Universal Bluetooth keyboard, which you can 
find under Bluetooth keyboards at shop.crackberry.com or Amazon.com.
	
You have the choice of Bluetooth and non-Bluetooth connection options. 
We recommend Bluetooth to minimize the clutter. A Bluetooth keyboard is 
the most convenient option for the obvious reasons: You don’t have to carry 
cables, and you can position your BlackBerry any way you want.

319
 Chapter 20: Ten Great BlackBerry Accessories
For less than $100, you can own the cool iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth 
keyboard, available at www.amazon.com. Or you can buy the ThinkOutside 
Stowaway Shasta Bluetooth keyboard for BlackBerry, available at http://
yahooshopping.com for $45.
Stereo Headsets
Although your new BlackBerry is a stereo music player, it doesn’t come with 
stereo headphones. You will definitely yearn for stereo sound the moment 
you listen to music or watch video clips. A quick search on the Internet for 
BlackBerry + stereo headphones yields many results. But you want to be able 
to talk, too.
You could spend $30 to $200. Several good headsets follow:
	
✓	BlackBerry stereo headset with noise-isolating ear gels
	
✓	V-MODA Vibe duo in-ear headphones with mic
	
✓	Motorola S9 stereo Bluetooth headset
	
The best place to get stereo headphones for your BlackBerry is good ol’ 
Amazon: www.amazon.com.
Case and Belt Clip
You have plenty of cases to choose among, with looks ranging from sporty to 
professional. These cases can set you back anywhere from $20 to $40, which 
isn’t too bad for looking hip.
Here’s where you can buy a new case or belt clip:
	
✓	http://www.smrtcase.com
	
✓	http://shop.crackberry.com
	
✓	www.amazon.com
	
✓	www.bberry.com
	
✓	www.blackberryden.com
	
✓	www.blackberrysource.com

320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
	
When you buy a new belt case or clip, buy one made specifically for your 
BlackBerry model. Also, it’s important that the case or clip come with a small 
magnet. BlackBerry is holster-aware and conserves battery juice, and this 
magnet is the key for the BlackBerry to know that it is inside a holster.
Screen Protector and Skins
If the protector case described in the preceding section is a bit stressful for 
your wallet, try the Blackberry Pro high-definition screen protector with 
mirror effect. That’s a mouthful, but for about $10, it protects your screen 
from scratches. Go to www.accessorygeeks.com.
Other popular bestsellers are skin cases. They come in many colors and keep 
your BlackBerry looking new. The price is usually between $9 and $12. Go to 
http://shop.crackberry.com or www.accessorygeeks.com.
Extra Battery, Charger, 
and Charging Pod
An extra battery for your BlackBerry will come in handy if you’re a daily user.
	
Buy your battery only from Research In Motion, at www.shopblackberry.
com, or an authorized RIM reseller, not from some unknown vendor. A faulty 
battery can damage your BlackBerry beyond repair.
Make sure that the battery you buy is for your BlackBerry model. You’ll 
spend around $50 for the extra battery.
If you watch video on your BlackBerry, you know that the battery needs to be 
charged every couple of hours. And if you’re always on the go, you’d better 
have a portable charger on hand. The charger included with your BlackBerry 
is great to carry around town (and the world) because it has multiple adapt­
ers for different countries’ electric plugs.
If you’re a road warrior, get the BlackBerry car charger. It will set you back 
around $30. To top it off, you can also get a power station or charging pod, 
which connects to a power supply for charging and at the same time holds 
your BlackBerry firmly in place on your desk or nightstand. On your night­
stand, you can take advantage of sleep mode, which sets the device to not 
disturb you by doing things such as dimming the light and turning off the 
LED. The charging pod costs $12 to $30, depending on how fancy it is.

321
 Chapter 20: Ten Great BlackBerry Accessories
	
Make sure that the charger and the charging pod you buy are for your 
BlackBerry model.
You can get a BlackBerry car charger and charging pod from the following 
sites:
	
✓	http://shop.crackberry.com
	
✓	www.amazon.com
	
✓	www.blackberrysource.com
	
✓	www.shopblackberry.com (RIM’s official store)
External Speaker
BlackBerry comes with a speaker, but if the sound quality just isn’t good 
enough for your listening taste, an external Bluetooth speaker can bring your 
outdoor listening to the next level. We recommend the following:
	
✓	Blueant M1 Bluetooth stereo speakers
	
✓	Motorola EQ5 wireless travel stereo speaker
For about $110, you can get either of them from http://shop.
crackberry.com.
Bluetooth Music Gateway
If you already have a great set of speakers or an audio entertainment system, 
using a RIM Bluetooth Music Gateway is the perfect way to stream music to 
your existing system. Simply pair your BlackBerry to the Bluetooth Music 
Gateway via Bluetooth (hence the name), and you are ready to go. What is 
even better is that this hockey puck–like Music Gateway can be paired with 
your PC or Mac, so you get more use out of it. Find it at http://shop.
crackberry.com.
Car Mount
To complete your BlackBerry car experience, mount your BlackBerry in 
your car. The market offers many products, ranging from $15 to $30. You 

322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
can search the major search sites. You can also get a car mount from these 
BlackBerry sites:
	
✓	http://shop.crackberry.com
	
✓	www.amazon.com
	
✓	www.blackberrysource.com
	
Make sure that the product you’re choosing supports your BlackBerry model.
The latest wireless speakerphone from RIM is BlackBerry Visor Mount 
SpeakerPhone VM-605. It’s a Bluetooth speakerphone that you attach to your 
car’s visor, just like you attach your garage door opener. You can get one for 
$99 at www.shopblackberry.com.

Ten Must-Have Applications
In This Chapter

▶	VibAndRing

T
he availability of BlackBerry software is growing at a dizzying rate. In 
this chapter, we introduce ten must-have applications that make your 
BlackBerry Curve experience that much better.
We don’t quotes specific reviews. These choices are the results of our 
quest to find programs that people use, discerned from discussions with 
BlackBerry users, postings on message boards, and commentaries in the 
public domain. The applications featured here are just the tip of the iceberg. 
By all means, feel free to surf the Internet, because by the time this book is 
published, more software will likely be available. And don’t forget to visit our 
Web site at www.blackberryfordummies.com.
SmrtGuard, Your BlackBerry Guardian
If you lost your BlackBerry, have you wondered what would happen to 
your data, such as your sensitive e-mails, phone call histories, contacts, 
and appointments? It’s scary to think of a stranger getting to know you 
through your e-mails and knowing what you’re going to do next. These same 

324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
thoughts haunt us as well. Fortunately, there’s SmrtGuard (formerly known 
as BerryFinder.com), which provides the following tools:
	
✓	Locate and “LoJack” your BlackBerry: With no GPS signal required, 
you can track your Curve’s approximate location to determine whether 
you simply misplaced it or someone stole it.
	
✓	Wireless data backup: This is another must-have feature that 
SmrtGuard provides. If you self-destroyed your data and don’t have a 
backup, the scheduled wireless backup of your PIM data will come in 
handy. From the SmrtGuard Web site (www.smrtguard.com), you can 
even see and browse through your backed-up data and export it to a file 
(a Microsoft Excel file or a text file).
	
✓	Sound the homing beacon: If you simply misplaced your BlackBerry but 
can’t find it by calling because you muted it, don’t worry. Just send a 
homing beacon, and your BlackBerry will emit a loud sound regardless 
of your Profile setting. We wish our remote controls had this feature!
	
✓	Self-destroy in five seconds: Okay, perhaps not in five seconds, but 
you can decide when to destroy all your BlackBerry data. That includes 
e-mails, contacts, appointments, to-do’s, memos, phone logs, text mes­
sages, and even all the files on your microSD card.
	
Always protect your BlackBerry Curve with a password. That way, if your 
Curve gets into the wrong hands, your data will be self-erased after ten unsuc­
cessful password entries. However, the files on your microSD card aren’t 
deleted. This is why SmrtGuard is so helpful.
With SmrtGuard by your side, you can concentrate on your business instead 
of worrying about your BlackBerry data being stolen. You can get SmrtGuard 
for $3.99 a month, or $49.99 for a whole year’s subscription. There’s also a 
10-day free trial. Check it out at www.smrtguard.com.
TetherBerry
Subscribing to mobile broadband for your laptop is expensive. TetherBerry 
provides an inexpensive solution for connecting to the Internet from your 
laptop by using your BlackBerry Curve. You can check the details at www.
tetherberry.com.
On the Web site, you can order the application for a one-time fee of $49.95. 
That’s spare change considering that you get connectivity to your laptop 
using your Curve. There’s also a 30-day money-back guarantee.

325
 Chapter 21: Ten Must-Have Applications
VibAndRing
Don’t like the fact that you can’t get your BlackBerry to alert you the way you 
want? Do you need custom vibration when a phone call comes in?
Time to get your hands on VibAndRing. With it, you can customize how many 
vibrate bursts you get before the Curve starts ringing and how long each 
vibration lasts.
To download a free trial, go to www.mobihand.com, and search for vibandring.
Viigo for BlackBerry
An application that you’ll use on a daily basis is Viigo. Viigo is an RSS reader. 
The application is really a one-stop shop for almost all information you 
need, whether you want news, blogs, podcasts, weather info, entertainment, 
finance, flight info, or more.
Download Viigo for free from your BlackBerry at http://www.viigo.com.
PeeKaWho — E-mail and SMS Alerts
Ever find yourself in the middle of browsing or composing an e-mail, and all 
of a sudden a new e-mail finds its way to your inbox? Instead of stopping what 
you’re doing and heading to the inbox, with PeeKaWho you can get a preview 
of the e-mail or SMS message that has just arrived, and you can dismiss, mark 
as read, go to your inbox, or delete the message — all from the alert pop-up.
To find out more, go to www.smrtguard.com/peek.jsp.
Zodiac
What’s Zodiac? It’s a simple yet addictive game where you match three or 
more cute animal figures; you hear a satisfying “bing” that will keep you 
going. The best part is that your spouse and kids will enjoy Zodiac as well. 
Try it for free by downloading it from http://www.mobihand.com/
product.asp?id=29358&n=Zodiac.

326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Google Talk Mobile and Yahoo! 
Messenger Mobile
If you currently use Google Talk or Yahoo! Messenger on your PC, both 
mobile versions are must-downloads to keep up with your buddies no matter 
where you are. To download, point your BlackBerry browser to
	
✓	Google Talk Mobile: www.blackberry.com/GoogleTalk
	
✓	Yahoo! Messenger Mobile: www.blackberry.com/YahooDownload
WeatherEye
Numerous weather programs are available, but we like the one from 
WeatherEye for its simplicity. You set up the weather location you want, 
and WeatherEye displays an icon on your Home screen to indicate the 
current weather information, updated daily. This application is free; down­
load it from http://blackberry.theweathernetwork.com.
Nobex Radio Companion
FM radio on your BlackBerry? That’s right. With Nobex, you can get stream­
ing radio on your BlackBerry for free (for now)!
More than a hundred stations are available for streaming. Nobex works best 
if you have a 3G or EvDo network (the faster the network, the better your 
experience with Nobex). To find out more, go to www.nobexrc.com. 
Online Personal Music Players
Two applications, Pandora and Slacker, stream CD-quality music right to your 
BlackBerry. After you download and sign up for Pandora, you just search 
for the music that you like to hear, and Pandora will automatically feed you 
similar songs. If you indicate to Pandora whether you like or dislike a particu­
lar song that it feeds you, future Pandora selections should be more to your 
liking. Try Pandora for free at http://www.pandora.com/blackberry. To 
try Slacker for free, download it at http://www.slacker.com.

Ten Important Types of Web Sites
In This Chapter
▶	Weather
▶	News
▶	Search engines, directories, and portals
▶	Business
▶	Travel
▶	Sports
▶	Advice and self-help
▶	Social and virtual networking
▶	Shopping and shipping information
▶	Other browsing categories
W
eb surfing with a BlackBerry has improved dramatically with the 
newer models. With higher screen resolution and bigger real estate, 
your BlackBerry Curve should give you one good mobile Web-browsing 
experience. And with a 3G connection, your Web browsing should be faster. 
Remember that by using Page view, where the Web page displays like it does 
in your PC Web browser, you can maintain on your BlackBerry the browsing 
habits you have on your PC, but in a smaller package. The Web site recom­
mendations in this chapter are based on reviews in the public domain and 
sites that definitely help when you’re on the go.
Weather
Weather changes often, but you can keep up with it at these sites:
	
✓	AccuWeather.com (www.accuweather.com): AccuWeather.com pro­
vides the local weather forecast.
	
✓	Weather.com (www.weather.com): Weather.com is smart enough to 
know that you’re using a mobile device and displays a nice, trim version 
of its page with a few links to non-weather–related information.

328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
If these two sites aren’t enough, check out the “Search Engines, Directories, 
and Portals” section, later in this chapter. Major portals have weather infor­
mation as well as traffic alerts and airport delays.
News
Most major news companies have mobile versions of their sites. This section 
gives you just a sampling of what’s out there. We list the same Web address 
you’d expect when browsing from your desktop. These sites detect that you’re 
using a smartphone and redirect you to the mobile-friendly version of their sites:
	
✓	ABC News (www.abcnews.com): Get ABC News on your BlackBerry.
	
✓	BBC News (www.bbc.com): You can read BBC News right from your 
BlackBerry, even if you’re not in the United Kingdom.

mation or links to other sites:

charm on your BlackBerry.

related pages, which give you up-to-the-minute stock quotes.
	
✓	 RIM mobile home page (http://mobile.blackberry.com): This is 
the default home page setting for most BlackBerry browsers. The ser­
vice provider can customize it, though, so your BlackBerry browser may 

329
 Chapter 22: Ten Important Types of Web Sites
point to your service provider’s home page. RIM’s home page is defi­
nitely a place to start browsing the Web.
	
	You should definitely bookmark this site.
	
✓	Yahoo! Mobile (www.yahoo.com): Yahoo! is a smart portal because it 
knows you’re using a mobile device and formats the page accordingly — 
meaning a smaller page with no advertisements. The portal site allows 
BlackBerry users to employ regular Yahoo! functions, such as Yahoo! 
Mail, Messenger, Finance, and Games, as well as driving directions and 
weather.
	
	This is another site you should bookmark.

BlackBerry. Visit the following sites for finance-related articles and news:

age firm.
	
✓	Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com): This is a great site for 
checking the performance of your stocks.

access frequent-flier benefits:

you who has the best rooms and who doesn’t.
	
✓	WikiTravel (www.wikitravel.com): This is one of the most up-to-date

gate to IM & Social Networking.
