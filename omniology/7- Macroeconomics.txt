About the Author
N. Gregory Mankiw is the Robert M. Beren Professor of Economics at Harvard 
University. He began his study of economics at Princeton University, where 
he received an A.B. in 1980. After earning a Ph.D. in economics from MIT, he 
began teaching at Harvard in 1985 and was promoted to full professor in 1987. 
At Harvard, he has taught both undergraduate and graduate courses in macro­
economics. He is also author of the best-selling introductory textbook Principles 
of Economics (Cengage Learning).
Professor Mankiw is a regular participant in academic and policy debates. His 
research ranges across macroeconomics and includes work on price adjustment, 
consumer behavior, financial markets, monetary and fiscal policy, and economic 
growth. In addition to his duties at Harvard, he has been a research associate of 
the National Bureau of Economic Research, a member of the Brookings Panel 
on Economic Activity, and an adviser to the Congressional Budget Office and 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and New York. From 2003 to 2005 he was 
chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers.
Professor Mankiw lives in Wellesley, Massachusetts, with his wife, Deborah; 
children, Catherine, Nicholas, and Peter; and their border terrier, Tobin.

To Deborah

T
hose branches of politics, or of the laws of social life, on which there 
exists a collection of facts sufficiently sifted and methodized to form 
the beginning of a science should be taught ex professo. Among the 
chief of these is Political Economy, the sources and conditions of wealth and 
material prosperity for aggregate bodies of human beings. . . .
The same persons who cry down Logic will generally warn you against Politi­
cal Economy. It is unfeeling, they will tell you. It recognises unpleasant facts. For 
my part, the most unfeeling thing I know of is the law of gravitation: it breaks 
the neck of the best and most amiable person without scruple, if he forgets for 
a single moment to give heed to it. The winds and waves too are very unfeeling. 
Would you advise those who go to sea to deny the winds and waves—or to make 
use of them, and find the means of guarding against their dangers? My advice 
to you is to study the great writers on Political Economy, and hold firmly by 
whatever in them you find true; and depend upon it that if you are not selfish or 
hardhearted already, Political Economy will not make you so.
John Stuart Mill, 1867

Preface
A
n economist must be “mathematician, historian, statesman, philosopher, 
in some degree . . . as aloof and incorruptible as an artist, yet sometimes 
as near the earth as a politician.” So remarked John Maynard Keynes, 
the great British economist who, as much as anyone, could be called the father 
of macroeconomics. No single statement summarizes better what it means to be 
an economist.
As Keynes’s assessment suggests, students who aim to learn economics need 
to draw on many disparate talents. The job of helping students find and develop 
these talents falls to instructors and textbook authors. My goal for this textbook 
is to make macroeconomics understandable, relevant, and (believe it or not) fun. 
Those of us who have chosen to be professional macroeconomists have done so 
because we are fascinated by the field. More important, we believe that the study 
of macroeconomics can illuminate much about the world and that the lessons 
learned, if properly applied, can make the world a better place. I hope this book 
conveys not only our profession’s accumulated wisdom but also its enthusiasm 
and sense of purpose.
This Book’s Approach
Macroeconomists share a common body of knowledge, but they do not all 
have the same perspective on how that knowledge is best taught. Let me begin 
this new edition by recapping my objectives, which together define this book’s 
approach to the field.
First, I try to offer a balance between short-run and long-run issues in macro­
economics. All economists agree that public policies and other events influence 
the economy over different time horizons. We live in our own short run, but 
we also live in the long run that our parents bequeathed us. As a result, courses 
in macroeconomics need to cover both short-run topics, such as the business 
cycle and stabilization policy, and long-run topics, such as economic growth, the 
natural rate of unemployment, persistent inflation, and the effects of government 
debt. Neither time horizon trumps the other.
Second, I integrate the insights of Keynesian and classical theories. Although 
Keynes’s General Theory provides the foundation for much of our current under­
standing of economic fluctuations, it is important to remember that classical eco­
nomics provides the right answers to many fundamental questions. In this book I 
incorporate many of the contributions of the classical economists before Keynes 
and the new classical economists of the past several decades. Substantial cover­
age is given, for example, to the loanable-funds theory of the interest rate, the 
quantity theory of money, and the problem of time inconsistency. At the same 
time, I recognize that many of the ideas of Keynes and the new Keynesians are 

xxiv |  Preface
necessary for understanding economic fluctuations. Substantial coverage is given 
also to the IS–LM model of aggregate demand, the short-run tradeoff between 
inflation and unemployment, and modern models of business cycle dynamics.
Third, I present macroeconomics using a variety of simple models. Instead of 
pretending that there is one model that is complete enough to explain all facets 
of the economy, I encourage students to learn how to use and compare a set 
of prominent models. This approach has the pedagogical value that each model 
can be kept relatively simple and presented within one or two chapters. More 
important, this approach asks students to think like economists, who always keep 
various models in mind when analyzing economic events or public policies.
Fourth, I emphasize that macroeconomics is an empirical discipline, motivated 
and guided by a wide array of experience. This book contains numerous Case 
Studies that use macroeconomic theory to shed light on real-world data and 
events. To highlight the broad applicability of the basic theory, I have drawn the 
Case Studies both from current issues facing the world’s economies and from 
dramatic historical episodes. The Case Studies analyze the policies of Alexander 
Hamilton, Henry Ford, George Bush (both of them!), and Barack Obama. They 
teach the reader how to apply economic principles to issues from fourteenth-
century Europe, the island of Yap, the land of Oz, and today’s newspaper.
What’s New in the Ninth Edition?
Economics instructors are vigilant in keeping their lectures up to date as the 
economic landscape changes. Textbook authors cannot be less so. This book is 
therefore updated about every three years. In this ninth edition, you will find 
several kinds of changes.
Most obviously, tables and figures throughout the book have been revised to 
include the latest available data. College students take courses in economics to 
understand the world in which they live. It is important, therefore, that the data 
presented be as current as possible.
The book has also been updated to take into account recent events and eco­
nomic developments. For example:
C
C In 2013, the Bureau of Economic Analysis revised the definition of GDP 
to include investment in intellectual property products; a new section in 
Chapter 2 discusses the change.
C
C Over the past few years, Bitcoin has arisen as a modern medium of 
exchange; a new box in Chapter 4 examines this unusual form of money.
C
C Between 2007 and 2014, the U.S. economy experienced a large decline 
in labor-force participation; a new case study in Chapter 7 examines the 
reasons for this development.
C
C In 2014, U.S. policymakers were concerned about the increasing fre­
quency of corporate inversions; a new case study in Chapter 17 discusses 
the policy debate over inversions and corporate tax reform.

Preface  | xxv
C
C In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008–2009, policymakers are 
increasingly taking a more macroeconomic perspective on regulating 
financial institutions; a new section in Chapter 20 discusses macropruden­
tial regulation.
In addition, the book reflects the evolution of macroeconomic thought based 
on recent research. For example:
C
C A new case study in Chapter 9 discusses work by Nicholas Bloom and 
John Van Reenen on management practices as a source of productivity 
differences.
C
C A new case study in Chapter 11 examines research by Emi Nakamura, Jón 
Steinsson, and others on the size of the fiscal-policy multipliers.
C
C A new case study in Chapter 18 discusses work by Scott Baker, Nicholas 
Bloom, and Steven Davis on economic policy uncertainty.
Perhaps most important, this edition includes a significant pedagogical 
innovation. In most of the core chapters, some end-of-chapter problems are 
identified with this icon:
. For these problems, students can go to 
LaunchPad to find a Work It Out tutorial for a similar problem. Because the 
Work It Out has a similar structure to the in-text problem, it is a resource for 
students to learn how to tackle the in-text problem. But because the Work It 
Out has different numbers and thus a different answer, the in-text problem can 
still be used as assigned homework. The Work It Out tutorials can be found at 
http://www.macmillanhighered.com/launchpad/mankiw9e.
Finally, very careful readers of this book will notice a subtle change in the 
use of pronouns. A nagging problem for authors is which pronoun to use for a 
person of unspecified gender. The traditional “he” sounds sexist to some modern 
readers, while “he or she” is cumbersome. So, in this edition, I use “she” in odd-
numbered chapters and “he” in even-numbered chapters. That will have to do, 
until we all adopt some more perfect language.
As always, all the changes I made and the many others I considered were 
evaluated keeping in mind the benefits of brevity. From my own experience as a 
student, I know that long books are less likely to be read. My goal in this book is 
to offer the clearest, most up-to-date, most accessible course in macroeconomics 
in the fewest words possible.
The Arrangement of Topics
My strategy for teaching macroeconomics is first to examine the long run, when 
prices are flexible, and then to examine the short run, when prices are sticky. 
This approach has several advantages. First, because the classical dichotomy per­
mits the separation of real and monetary issues, the long-run material is easier 
for students to understand. Second, when students begin studying short-run 
fluctuations, they understand fully the long-run equilibrium around which the 
economy is fluctuating. Third, beginning with market-clearing models clarifies 

xxvi |  Preface
the link between macroeconomics and microeconomics. Fourth, students learn 
first the material that is less controversial among macroeconomists. For all these 
reasons, the strategy of beginning with long-run classical models simplifies the 
teaching of macroeconomics.
Let’s now move from strategy to tactics. What follows is a whirlwind tour of 
the book.
Part One, Introduction
The introductory material in Part One is brief so that students can get to the 
core topics quickly. Chapter l discusses the broad questions that macroecono­
mists address and the economist’s approach of building models to explain the 
world. Chapter 2 introduces the key data of macroeconomics, emphasizing gross 
domestic product, the consumer price index, and the unemployment rate.
Part Two, Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
Part Two examines the long run, over which prices are flexible. Chapter 3 presents 
the basic classical model of national income. In this model, the factors of production 
and the production technology determine the level of income, and the marginal 
products of the factors determine its distribution to households. In addition, the 
model shows how fiscal policy influences the allocation of the economy’s resources 
among consumption, investment, and government purchases, and it highlights how 
the real interest rate equilibrates the supply and demand for goods and services.
Money and the price level are introduced next. Chapter 4 examines the mon­
etary system and the tools of monetary policy. Chapter 5 begins the discussion of 
the effects of monetary policy. Because prices are assumed to be fully flexible, the 
chapter presents the prominent ideas of classical monetary theory: the quantity 
theory of money, the inflation tax, the Fisher effect, the social costs of inflation, 
and the causes and costs of hyperinflation.
The study of open-economy macroeconomics begins in Chapter 6. Maintain­
ing the assumption of full employment, this chapter presents models to explain 
the trade balance and the exchange rate. Various policy issues are addressed: the 
relationship between the budget deficit and the trade deficit, the macroeconomic 
impact of protectionist trade policies, and the effect of monetary policy on the 
value of a currency in the market for foreign exchange.
Chapter 7 relaxes the assumption of full employment by discussing the 
dynamics of the labor market and the natural rate of unemployment. It examines 
various causes of unemployment, including job search, minimum-wage laws, 
union power, and efficiency wages. It also presents some important facts about 
patterns of unemployment.
Part Three, Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
Part Three makes the classical analysis of the economy dynamic by developing the 
tools of modern growth theory. Chapter 8 introduces the Solow growth model 
as a description of how the economy evolves over time. This chapter emphasizes 
the roles of capital accumulation and population growth. Chapter 9 then adds 

Preface  | xxvii
technological progress to the Solow model. It uses the model to discuss growth 
experiences around the world as well as public policies that influence the level 
and growth of the standard of living. Finally, Chapter 9 introduces students to the 
modern theories of endogenous growth.
Part Four, Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
Part Four examines the short run when prices are sticky. It begins in Chapter 10 
by examining some of the key facts that describe short-run fluctuations in eco­
nomic activity. The chapter then introduces the model of aggregate supply and 
aggregate demand as well as the role of stabilization policy. Subsequent chapters 
refine the ideas introduced in this chapter.
Chapters 11 and 12 look more closely at aggregate demand. Chapter 11 pres­
ents the Keynesian cross and the theory of liquidity preference and uses these 
models as building blocks for developing the IS–LM model. Chapter 12 uses the 
IS–LM model to explain economic fluctuations and the aggregate demand curve. 
It concludes with an extended case study of the Great Depression.
The study of short-run fluctuations continues in Chapter 13, which focuses 
on aggregate demand in an open economy. This chapter presents the Mundell–
Fleming model and shows how monetary and fiscal policies affect the economy 
under floating and fixed exchange-rate systems. It also discusses the debate over 
whether exchange rates should be floating or fixed.
Chapter 14 looks more closely at aggregate supply. It examines various 
approaches to explaining the short-run aggregate supply curve and discusses the 
short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.
Part Five, Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
After developing basic theories to explain the economy in the long run and in 
the short run, the book turns to several topics that refine our understanding of 
the economy. Part Five focuses on theoretical topics, and Part Six focuses on 
policy topics. These chapters are written to be used flexibly, so instructors can 
pick and choose which topics to cover. Some of these chapters can also be cov­
ered earlier in the course, depending on the instructor’s preferences.
Chapter 15 develops a dynamic model of aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply. It builds on ideas that students have already encountered and uses those 
ideas as stepping-stones to take the student close to the frontier of knowledge 
concerning short-run economic fluctuations. The model presented here is a 
simplified version of modern dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium (DSGE) 
models.
The next two chapters analyze more fully some of the microeconomic deci­
sions behind macroeconomic phenomena. Chapter 16 presents the various 
theories of consumer behavior, including the Keynesian consumption func­
tion, Fisher’s model of intertemporal choice, Modigliani’s life-cycle hypothesis, 
Friedman’s permanent-income hypothesis, Hall’s random-walk hypothesis, and 
Laibson’s model of instant gratification. Chapter 17 examines the theory behind 
the investment function.

xxviii |  Preface
Part Six, Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
Once students have solid command of standard macroeconomic models, the 
book uses these models as the foundation for discussing some of the key debates 
over economic policy. Chapter 18 considers the debate over how policymakers 
should respond to short-run economic fluctuations. It emphasizes two broad 
questions: Should monetary and fiscal policy be active or passive? Should policy 
be conducted by rule or by discretion? The chapter presents arguments on both 
sides of these questions.
Chapter 19 focuses on the various debates over government debt and budget 
deficits. It gives a broad picture about the magnitude of government indebted­
ness, discusses why measuring budget deficits is not always straightforward, recaps 
the traditional view of the effects of government debt, presents Ricardian equiva­
lence as an alternative view, and discusses various other perspectives on govern­
ment debt. As in the previous chapter, students are not handed conclusions but 
are given the tools to evaluate the alternative viewpoints on their own.
Chapter 20 discusses the financial system and its linkages to the overall 
economy. It begins by examining what the financial system does: financing 
investment, sharing risk, dealing with asymmetric information, and fostering 
economic growth. It then discusses the causes of financial crises, their macro­
economic impact, and the policies that might mitigate their effects and reduce 
their likelihood.
Epilogue
The book ends with a brief epilogue that reviews the broad lessons about which 
most macroeconomists agree and discusses some of the most important open 
questions. Regardless of which chapters an instructor chooses to cover, this cap­
stone chapter can be used to remind students how the many models and themes 
of macroeconomics relate to one another. Here and throughout the book, I 
emphasize that despite the disagreements among macroeconomists, there is much 
that we know about how the economy works.
Alternative Routes Through the Text
Although I have organized the material in the way that I prefer to teach 
intermediate-level macroeconomics, I understand that other instructors have 
different preferences. I tried to keep this in mind as I wrote the book so that it 
would offer a degree of flexibility. Here are a few ways that instructors might 
consider rearranging the material:
C
C Some instructors are eager to cover short-run economic fluctuations. For 
such a course, I recommend covering Chapters 1 through 5 so that stu­
dents are grounded in the basics of classical theory and then jumping to 
Chapters 10, 11, 12, 14, and 15 to cover the model of aggregate demand 
and aggregate supply.
C
C Some instructors are eager to cover long-run economic growth. These 
instructors can cover Chapters 8 and 9 immediately after Chapter 3.

Preface  | xxix
C
C An instructor who wants to defer (or even skip) open-economy macro­
economics can put off Chapters 6 and 13 without loss of continuity.
C
C An instructor who wants to emphasize economic policy can skip 
Chapters 8, 9, 15, 16, and 17 in order to get to Chapters 18, 19, and 20 
more quickly.
The successful experiences of hundreds of instructors with previous editions 
suggest this text complements well a variety of approaches to the field.
Learning Tools
I am pleased that students have found the previous editions of this book user-friendly. 
I have tried to make this ninth edition even more so. I am most excited about the 
parallel problems that students can see in LaunchPad’s Work It Out feature. 
Case Studies
Economics comes to life when it is applied to understanding actual events. There­
fore, the numerous Case Studies (many new or revised in this edition) are an impor­
tant learning tool, integrated closely with the theoretical material presented in each 
chapter. The frequency with which these Case Studies occur ensures that a student 
does not have to grapple with an overdose of theory before seeing the theory 
applied. Students report that the Case Studies are their favorite part of the book.
FYI Boxes
These boxes present ancillary material “for your information.” I use these boxes 
to clarify difficult concepts, to provide additional information about the tools of 
economics, and to show how economics relates to our daily lives. Several are new 
or revised in this edition.
Graphs
Understanding graphical analysis is a key part of learning macroeconomics, and I 
have worked hard to make the figures easy to follow. I often use comment boxes 
within figures to briefly describe and draw attention to the important points that 
the figures illustrate. The pedagogical use of color, detailed captions, and com­
ment boxes makes it easier for students to learn and review the material.
Mathematical Notes
I use occasional mathematical footnotes to keep more difficult material out of 
the body of the text. These notes make an argument more rigorous or present a 
proof of a mathematical result. They can easily be skipped by those students who 
have not been introduced to the necessary mathematical tools.
Chapter Summaries
Every chapter ends with a brief, nontechnical summary of its major lessons. Stu­
dents can use the summaries to place the material in perspective and to review 
for exams.

xxx |  Preface
Key Concepts
Learning the language of a field is a major part of any course. Within the chapter, 
each key concept is in boldface when it is introduced. At the end of the chapter, 
the key concepts are listed for review.
Questions for Review
After studying a chapter, students can immediately test their understanding of its 
basic lessons by answering the Questions for Review.
Problems and Applications
Every chapter includes Problems and Applications designed for homework assign­
ments. Some are numerical applications of the theory in the chapter. Others 
encourage the student to go beyond the material in the chapter by addressing new 
issues that are closely related to the chapter topics. In most of the core chapters, a 
few problems are identified with this icon:
. For each of these prob­
lems, students can find a Work It Out tutorial on LaunchPad for Macroeconomics, 
Ninth Edition: http://www.macmillanhighered.com/launchpad/mankiw9e.
Chapter Appendices
Several chapters include appendices that offer additional material, sometimes at 
a higher level of mathematical sophistication. These appendices are designed so 
that instructors can cover certain topics in greater depth if they wish. The appen­
dices can be skipped altogether without loss of continuity.
Glossary
To help students become familiar with the language of macroeconomics, a glos­
sary of more than 250 terms is provided at the back of the book.
International Editions
The English-language version of this book has been used in dozens of countries. 
To make the book more accessible for students around the world, editions are (or 
will soon be) available in 15 other languages: Armenian, Chinese, French, German, 
Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Romanian, 
Russian, Spanish, and Ukrainian. In addition, a Canadian adaptation coauthored 
with William Scarth (McMaster University) and a European adaptation coauthored 
with Mark Taylor (University of Warwick) are available. Instructors who would like 
information about these versions of the book should contact Worth Publishers.
Acknowledgments
Since I started writing the first edition of this book, I have benefited from the input 
of many reviewers and colleagues in the economics profession. Now that the book is 
in its ninth edition, these people are too numerous to list in their entirety. However, I 
continue to be grateful for their willingness to have given up their scarce time to help

NEW Work It Out Tutorials
New to this edition, these tutorials guide students through the process of apply­
ing economic analysis to solve a problem similar to the end-of-chapter problems 
found in the text. Choice-specific feedback and video explanations provide stu­
dents with interactive assistance for each step of the problem.
Macro Models
These modules provide simulations of the models presented in the book. Stu­
dents can change the exogenous variables and see the outcomes in terms of shift­
ing curves and recalculated numerical values of the endogenous variables. Each 
module contains exercises that instructors can assign as homework.
Fed Chairman Game
Created by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, this game allows students

W
hen Albert Einstein made the above observation about the nature 
of science, he was probably referring to physics, chemistry, and 
other natural sciences. But the statement is equally true when 
applied to social sciences like economics. As a participant in the economy, and as 
a citizen in a democracy, you cannot help but think about economic issues as you 
go about your life or when you enter the voting booth. But if you are like most 
people, your everyday thinking about economics has probably been casual rather 
than rigorous (or at least it was before you took your first economics course). 
The goal of studying economics is to refine that thinking. This book aims to help 
you in that endeavor, focusing on the part of the field called macroeconomics, 
which studies the forces that influence the economy as a whole.
 1-1   What Macroeconomists Study
Why have some countries experienced rapid growth in incomes over the past 
century while others have stayed mired in poverty? Why do some countries have 
high rates of inflation while others maintain stable prices? Why do all countries 
experience recessions and depressions—recurrent periods of falling incomes and 
rising ­unemployment—and how can government policy reduce the frequency 
and severity of these episodes? Macroeconomics attempts to answer these and 
many related questions.
To appreciate the importance of macroeconomics, you need only head over to some 
online news Web site. Every day you can see headlines such as INCOME GROWTH 
REBOUNDS, FED MOVES TO COMBAT INFLATION, or STOCKS FALL 
AMID RECESSION FEARS. These macroeconomic events may seem abstract, 
but they touch all of our lives. Business executives forecasting the demand for their 
products must guess how fast consumers’ incomes will grow. Senior citizens living on 
fixed incomes wonder how fast prices will rise. Recent college graduates looking for 
jobs hope that the economy will boom and that firms will be hiring.

The whole of science is nothing more than the refinement of everyday thinking.

2 |  P A R T  I   Introduction
Because the state of the economy affects everyone, macroeconomic issues play 
a central role in national political debates. Voters are aware of how the economy 
is doing, and they know that government policy can affect the economy in 
­powerful ways. As a result, the popularity of an incumbent president often rises 
when the economy is doing well and falls when it is doing poorly.
Macroeconomic issues are also central to world politics, and the international 
news is filled with macroeconomic questions. Was it a good move for much of 
Europe to adopt a common currency? Should China maintain a fixed exchange 
rate against the U.S. dollar? Why is the United States running large trade deficits? 
How can poor nations raise their standards of living? When world leaders meet, 
these topics are often high on their agenda.
Although the job of making economic policy belongs to world leaders, the 
job of explaining the workings of the economy as a whole falls to macroecono­
mists. Toward this end, macroeconomists collect data on incomes, prices, unem­
ployment, and many other variables from different time periods and ­different 
countries. They then attempt to formulate general theories to explain these 
data. Like astronomers studying the evolution of stars or biologists studying the 
evolution of species, macroeconomists cannot conduct controlled experiments 
in a laboratory. Instead, they must make use of the data that history gives them. 
Macroeconomists observe that economies differ across countries and that they 
change over time. These observations provide both the motivation for develop­
ing macroeconomic theories and the data for testing them.
To be sure, macroeconomics is an imperfect science. The macroeconomist’s 
ability to predict the future course of economic events is no better than the 
meteorologist’s ability to predict next month’s weather. But, as you will see, mac­
roeconomists know quite a lot about how economies work. This knowledge is 
useful both for explaining economic events and for formulating economic policy.
Every era has its own economic problems. In the 1970s, Presidents Richard 
Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter all wrestled in vain with a rising rate of 
inflation. In the 1980s, inflation subsided, but Presidents Ronald Reagan and 
George H. W. Bush presided over large federal budget deficits. In the 1990s, with 
President Bill Clinton in the Oval Office, the economy and stock market enjoyed 
a remarkable boom, and the federal budget turned from deficit to surplus. As 
Clinton left office, however, the stock market was in retreat, and the economy was 
heading into recession. In 2001 President George W. Bush reduced taxes to help 
end the recession, but the tax cuts contributed to a reemergence of budget deficits.
President Barack Obama moved into the White House in 2009 during a period 
of heightened economic turbulence. The economy was reeling from a financial 
crisis, driven by a large drop in housing prices, a steep rise in mortgage defaults, 
and the bankruptcy or near-bankruptcy of many financial institutions. As the 
financial crisis spread, it raised the specter of the Great Depression of the 1930s, 
when in its worst year one out of four Americans who wanted to work could not 
find a job. In 2008 and 2009, officials in the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and other 
parts of government acted vigorously to prevent a recurrence of that outcome. 
And while they succeeded—the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent—the 
downturn was nonetheless severe, the subsequent recovery was painfully slow, and 
the policies enacted left a legacy of greatly expanded government debt.

Macroeconomic history is not a simple story, but it provides a rich motivation 
for macroeconomic theory. While the basic principles of macroeconomics do not 
change from decade to decade, the macroeconomist must apply these principles 
with flexibility and creativity to meet changing circumstances.
CASE STUDY
The Historical Performance of the U.S. Economy
Economists use many types of data to measure the performance of an economy. Three 
macroeconomic variables are especially important: real gross domestic product (GDP), 
the inflation rate, and the unemployment rate. Real GDP measures the total income 
of everyone in the economy (adjusted for the level of prices). The inflation rate 
measures how fast prices are rising. The unemployment rate measures the fraction 
of the labor force that is out of work. Macroeconomists study how these variables are 
determined, why they change over time, and how they interact with one another.
Figure 1-1 shows real GDP per person in the United States. Two aspects of 
this figure are noteworthy. First, real GDP grows over time. Real GDP per person 
Real GDP per Person in the U.S. Economy   Real GDP measures 
the total income of everyone in the economy, and real GDP per 
person measures the income of the average person in the economy. 
This figure shows that real GDP per person tends to grow over time 
and that this normal growth is sometimes interrupted by periods of 
declining income, called recessions or depressions.
Note: Real GDP is plotted here on a logarithmic scale. On such a scale, equal 
distances on the vertical axis represent equal percentage changes. Thus, the 
distance between $5,000 and $10,000 (a 100 percent change) is the same as the 
distance between $10,000 and $20,000 (a 100 percent change).

The Inflation Rate in the U.S. Economy  The inflation rate measures the percent­
age change in the average level of prices from the year before. When the inflation 
rate is above zero, prices are rising. When it is below zero, prices are falling. If the 
inflation rate declines but remains positive, prices are rising but at a slower rate.
Note: The inflation rate is measured here using the GDP deflator.

today is about eight times higher than it was in 1900. This growth in average 
income allows us to enjoy a much higher standard of living than our great-
grandparents did. Second, although real GDP rises in most years, this growth 
is not steady. There are repeated periods during which real GDP falls, the most 
dramatic instance being the early 1930s. Such periods are called recessions if 
they are mild and depressions if they are more severe. Not surprisingly, periods 
of declining income are associated with substantial economic hardship.
Figure 1-2 shows the U.S. inflation rate. You can see that inflation varies substan­
tially over time. In the first half of the twentieth century, the inflation rate averaged 
only slightly above zero. Periods of falling prices, called deflation, were almost as 
common as periods of rising prices. By contrast, inflation has been the norm dur­
ing the past half century. Inflation became most severe during the late 1970s, when 
prices rose at a rate of almost 10 percent per year. In recent years, the inflation rate 
has been about 2 percent per year, indicating that prices have been fairly stable.
Figure 1-3 shows the U.S. unemployment rate. Notice that there is always 
some unemployment in the economy. In addition, although the unemployment 
rate has no long-term trend, it varies substantially from year to year. Recessions

 1-2   How Economists Think
Economists often study politically charged issues, but they try to address these 
issues with a scientist’s objectivity. Like any science, economics has its own set 
of tools—terminology, data, and a way of thinking—that can seem foreign and 
arcane to the layman. The best way to become familiar with these tools is to 
practice using them, and this book affords you ample opportunity to do so. To 
make these tools less forbidding, however, let’s discuss a few of them here.
FIGURE  1-3
The Unemployment Rate in the U.S. Economy  The unemployment rate ­measures

that the economy always has some unemployment and that the amount fluctuates

and depressions are associated with unusually high unemployment. The high­
est rates of unemployment were reached during the Great Depression of the 
1930s. The worst economic downturn since the Great Depression occurred in 
the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008–2009, when unemployment rose 
substantially. Even several years after the crisis, unemployment remained high.
These three figures offer a glimpse at the history of the U.S. economy. In the 
chapters that follow, we first discuss how these variables are measured and then 
develop theories to explain how they behave. n

Theory as Model Building
Young children learn much about the world around them by playing with toy 
versions of real objects. For instance, they often put together models of cars, 
trains, or planes. These models are far from realistic, but the model-builder learns 
a lot from them nonetheless. The model illustrates the essence of the real object it 
is designed to resemble. (In addition, for many children, building models is fun.)
Economists also use models to understand the world, but an economist’s 
model is more likely to be made of symbols and equations than plastic and glue. 
Economists build their “toy economies” to help explain economic variables, 
such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment. Economic models illustrate, often 
in mathematical terms, the relationships among the variables. Models are useful 
because they help us dispense with irrelevant details and focus on underlying 
connections. (In addition, for many economists, building models is fun.)
Models have two kinds of variables: endogenous variables and exogenous vari­
ables. Endogenous variables are those variables that a model tries to explain. 
Exogenous variables are those variables that a model takes as given. The pur­
pose of a model is to show how the exogenous variables affect the endogenous 
variables. In other words, as Figure 1-4 illustrates, exogenous variables come from 
outside the model and serve as the model’s input, whereas endogenous variables 
are determined within the model and are the model’s output.
To make these ideas more concrete, let’s review the most celebrated of all 
economic models—the model of supply and demand. Imagine that an economist 
wants to figure out what factors influence the price of pizza and the quantity 
of pizza sold. She would develop a model that described the behavior of pizza 
buyers, the behavior of pizza sellers, and their interaction in the market for pizza. 
For example, the economist supposes that the quantity of pizza demanded by 
consumers Qd depends on the price of pizza P and on aggregate income Y. This 
relationship is expressed in the equation
Qd 5 D(P, Y),
where D( ) represents the demand function. Similarly, the economist supposes 
that the quantity of pizza supplied by pizzerias Q s depends on the price of pizza 
FIGURE  1-4

How Models Work  Models are simplified theories that show the key 
relationships among economic variables. The exogenous variables are 
those that come from outside the model. The endogenous variables 
are those that the model explains. The model shows how changes in 
the exogenous variables affect the endogenous variables.

C H A P T E R  1   The Science of Macroeconomics  | 7
P and on the price of materials Pm, such as cheese, tomatoes, flour, and anchovies. 
This relationship is expressed as
Q s 5 S(P, Pm),
where S( ) represents the supply function. Finally, the economist assumes that 
the price of pizza adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and quantity demanded 
into balance:
Q s 5 Qd.
These three equations compose a model of the market for pizza.
The economist illustrates the model with a supply-and-demand diagram, as in 
Figure 1-5. The demand curve shows the relationship between the quantity of pizza 
demanded and the price of pizza, holding aggregate income constant. The demand 
curve slopes downward because a higher price of pizza encourages consumers to 
buy less pizza and switch to, say, hamburgers and tacos. The supply curve shows the 
relationship between the quantity of pizza supplied and the price of pizza, holding 
the price of materials constant. The supply curve slopes upward because a higher 
price of pizza makes selling pizza more profitable, which encourages pizzerias to 
produce more of it. The equilibrium for the market is the price and quantity at 
which the supply and demand curves intersect. At the equilibrium price, consum­
ers choose to buy the amount of pizza that pizzerias choose to produce.
This model of the pizza market has two exogenous variables and two endog­
enous variables. The exogenous variables are aggregate income and the price of

The Model of Supply and 
Demand  The most famous 
economic model is that of 
supply and demand for a 
good or service—in this case, 
pizza. The demand curve is 
a downward-­sloping curve 
relating the price of pizza to 
the quantity of pizza that 
consumers demand. The 
supply curve is an upward-­
sloping curve relating the 
price of pizza to the quan­
tity of pizza that pizzerias 
supply. The price of pizza 
adjusts until the quantity 
supplied equals the quantity 
demanded. The point where 
the two curves cross is the 
market equilibrium, which 
shows the equilibrium price 
of pizza and the equilibrium 
quantity of pizza.

materials. The model does not attempt to explain them but instead takes them as 
given (perhaps to be explained by another model). The endogenous variables are 
the price of pizza and the quantity of pizza exchanged. These are the variables 
that the model attempts to explain.
The model can be used to show how a change in one of the exogenous 
variables affects both endogenous variables. For example, if aggregate income 
increases, then the demand for pizza increases, as in panel (a) of Figure 1-6. 
The model shows that both the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quan­
tity of pizza rise. Similarly, if the price of materials increases, then the supply of 
pizza decreases, as in panel (b) of Figure 1-6. The model shows that in this case 
the equilibrium price of pizza rises and the equilibrium quantity of pizza falls.

Changes in Equilibrium  
In panel (a), a rise in 
aggregate income causes 
the demand for pizza to 
increase: at any given price, 
consumers now want to 
buy more pizza. This is 
represented by a rightward 
shift in the demand curve 
from D1 to D2. The market 
moves to the new intersec­
tion of supply and demand. 
The equilibrium price rises 
from P1 to P2, and the 
equilibrium quantity of 
pizza rises from Q1 to Q2. 
In panel (b), a rise in the 
price of materials decreases 
the supply of pizza: at any 
given price, pizzerias find 
that the sale of pizza is less 
profitable and therefore 
choose to produce less 
pizza. This is represented by 
a leftward shift in the sup­
ply curve from S1 to S2. The 
market moves to the new 
intersection of supply and 
demand. The equilibrium 
price rises from P1 to P2, 
and the equilibrium quan­
tity falls from Q1 to Q2.

C H A P T E R  1   The Science of Macroeconomics  | 9
Thus, the model shows how changes either in aggregate income or in the price 
of materials affect price and quantity in the market for pizza.
Like all models, this model of the pizza market makes simplifying assumptions. 
The model does not take into account, for example, that every pizzeria is in a 
different location. For each customer, one pizzeria is more convenient than the 
others, and thus pizzerias have some ability to set their own prices. The model 
assumes that there is a single price for pizza, but in fact there could be a different 
price at every pizzeria.
How should we react to the model’s lack of realism? Should we discard the 
simple model of pizza supply and demand? Should we attempt to build a more 
complex model that allows for diverse pizza prices? The answers to these ques­
tions depend on our purpose. If our goal is to explain how the price of cheese 
affects the average price of pizza and the amount of pizza sold, then the diversity 
of pizza prices is probably not important. The simple model of the pizza market 
does a good job of addressing that issue. Yet if our goal is to explain why towns 
with ten pizzerias have lower pizza prices than towns with only two, the simple 
model is less useful.
The art in economics lies in judging when a simplifying assumption (such as 
assuming a single price of pizza) clarifies our thinking and when it misleads us. 
All economic models express relationships among 
economic variables. Often, these relationships 
are expressed as functions. A function is a math­
ematical concept that shows how one variable 
depends on a set of other variables. For example, 
in the model of the pizza market, we said that the 
quantity of pizza demanded depends on the price 
of pizza and on aggregate income. To express 
this, we use functional notation to write
Qd 5 D(P, Y).
This equation says that the quantity of pizza 
demanded Q d is a function of the price of pizza P 
and aggregate income Y. In functional notation, 
the variable preceding the parentheses denotes 
the function. In this case, D( ) is the func­
tion expressing how the variables in parentheses 
determine the quantity of pizza demanded.
If we knew more about the pizza market, we could 
give a numerical formula for the quantity of pizza 
demanded. For example, we might be able to write
Qd 5 60 2 10P 1 2Y.
Using Functions to Express Relationships 
Among Variables
In this case, the demand function is
D(P, Y ) 5 60 2 10P 1 2Y.
For any price of pizza and aggregate income, 
this function gives the corresponding quantity 
of pizza demanded. For example, if aggregate 
income is $10 and the price of pizza is $2, then 
the quantity of pizza demanded is 60 pies; if the 
price of pizza rises to $3, the quantity of pizza 
demanded falls to 50 pies.
Functional notation allows us to express the 
general idea that variables are related, even 
when we do not have enough information to 
indicate the precise numerical relationship. 
For example, we might know that the quantity 
of pizza demanded falls when the price rises 
from $2 to $3, but we might not know by 
how much it falls. In this case, functional 
notation is useful: as long as we know that 
a relationship among the variables exists, we 
can express that relationship using functional 
notation.

10 |  P A R T  I   Introduction
Simplification is a necessary part of building a useful model: any model con­
structed to be completely realistic would be too complicated for anyone to 
understand. Yet if models assume away features of the economy that are crucial 
to the issue at hand, they may lead us to conclusions that do not hold in the real 
world. Economic modeling therefore requires care and common sense.
The Use of Multiple Models
Macroeconomists study many facets of the economy. For example, they examine 
the role of saving in economic growth, the impact of minimum-wage laws on 
unemployment, the effect of inflation on interest rates, and the influence of trade 
policy on the trade balance and exchange rate.
Economists use models to address all of these issues, but no single model can 
answer every question. Just as carpenters use different tools for different tasks, 
economists use different models to explain different economic ­phenomena. 
Students of macroeconomics therefore must keep in mind that there is no 
single “correct” model that is always applicable. Instead, there are many models, 
each of which is useful for shedding light on a different facet of the economy. 
The field of macroeconomics is like a Swiss army knife—a set of comple­
mentary but distinct tools that can be applied in different ways in different 
circumstances.
This book presents many different models that address different questions 
and make different assumptions. Remember that a model is only as good as its 
assumptions and that an assumption that is useful for some purposes may be 
misleading for others. When using a model to address a question, the economist 
must keep in mind the underlying assumptions and judge whether they are rea­
sonable for studying the matter at hand.
Prices: Flexible Versus Sticky
Throughout this book, one group of assumptions will prove especially 
important—­those concerning the speed at which wages and prices adjust to 
changing economic conditions. Economists normally presume that the price 
of a good or a service moves quickly to bring quantity supplied and quantity 
demanded into balance. In other words, they assume that markets are normally in 
equilibrium, so the price of any good or service is found where the supply and 
demand curves intersect. This assumption, called market clearing, is central to 
the model of the pizza market discussed earlier. For answering most questions, 
economists use market-clearing models.
Yet the assumption of continuous market clearing is not entirely realistic. For 
markets to clear continuously, prices must adjust instantly to changes in supply 
and demand. In fact, many wages and prices adjust slowly. Labor contracts often 
set wages for up to three years. Many firms leave their product prices the same 
for long periods of time—for example, magazine publishers typically change 
their newsstand prices only every three or four years. Although market-clearing 

C H A P T E R  1   The Science of Macroeconomics  | 11
models assume that all wages and prices are flexible, in the real world some 
wages and prices are sticky.
The apparent stickiness of prices does not make market-clearing models use­
less. After all, prices are not stuck forever; eventually, they adjust to changes in 
supply and demand. Market-clearing models might not describe the economy at 
every instant, but they do describe the equilibrium toward which the economy 
gravitates. Therefore, most macroeconomists believe that price flexibility is a 
good assumption for studying long-run issues, such as the growth in real GDP 
that we observe from decade to decade.
For studying short-run issues, such as year-to-year fluctuations in real GDP 
and unemployment, the assumption of price flexibility is less plausible. Over 
short periods, many prices in the economy are fixed at predetermined levels. 
Therefore, most macroeconomists believe that price stickiness is a better assump­
tion for studying the short-run behavior of the economy.
Microeconomic Thinking and Macroeconomic Models
Microeconomics is the study of how households and firms make decisions 
and how these decisionmakers interact in the marketplace. A central principle 
of microeconomics is that households and firms optimize—they do the best they 
can for themselves given their objectives and the constraints they face. In micro­
economic models, households choose their purchases to maximize their level of 
satisfaction, which economists call utility, and firms make production decisions 
to maximize their profits.
Because economy-wide events arise from the interaction of many households 
and firms, macroeconomics and microeconomics are inextricably linked. When 
we study the economy as a whole, we must consider the decisions of individual 
economic actors. For example, to understand what determines total consumer 
spending, we must think about a family deciding how much to spend today 
and how much to save for the future. To understand what determines total 
investment spending, we must think about a firm deciding whether to build a 
new factory. Because aggregate variables are the sum of the variables describing 
many ­individual decisions, macroeconomic theory rests on a microeconomic 
­foundation.
Although microeconomic decisions underlie all economic models, in many 
models the optimizing behavior of households and firms is implicit rather than 
explicit. The model of the pizza market we discussed earlier is an example. 
Households’ decisions about how much pizza to buy underlie the demand for 
pizza, and pizzerias’ decisions about how much pizza to produce underlie the 
supply of pizza. Presumably, households make their decisions to maximize ­utility, 
and pizzerias make their decisions to maximize profit. Yet the model does not 
focus on how these microeconomic decisions are made; instead, it leaves these 
decisions in the background. Similarly, although microeconomic decisions 
underlie macroeconomic phenomena, macroeconomic models do not neces­
sarily focus on the optimizing behavior of households and firms; again, they 
sometimes leave that behavior in the background.

The Nobel Prize in economics is announced every 
October. Over the years, many winners have been 
macroeconomists. Here are a few of them, along 
with some of their own words about how they 
chose their career paths:
Milton Friedman (Nobel 1976): “I graduated 
from college in 1932, when the United States was 
at the bottom of the deepest depression in its 
history before or since. The dominant problem 
of the time was economics. How to get out of 
the depression? How to reduce unemployment? 
What explained the paradox of great need on the 
one hand and unused resources on the other? 
Under the circumstances, becoming an econo­
mist seemed more relevant to the burning issues 
of the day than becoming an applied mathemati­
cian or an actuary.”
James Tobin (Nobel 1981): “I was attracted to 
the field for two reasons. One was that economic 
theory is a fascinating intellectual challenge, 
on the order of mathematics or chess. I liked 
analytics and logical argument. . . . The other 
reason was the obvious relevance of economics 
to understanding and perhaps overcoming the 
Great Depression.”
Franco Modigliani (Nobel 1985): “For a while 
it was thought that I should study medicine 
because my father was a physician. . . . I went to 
the registration window to sign up for medicine, 
but then I closed my eyes and thought of blood! 
I got pale just thinking about blood and decided 
under those conditions I had better keep away 
from medicine. . . . Casting about for something 
to do, I happened to get into some economics 
activities. I knew some German and was asked to 
translate from German into Italian some articles 
for one of the trade associations. Thus I began to 
be exposed to the economic problems that were 
in the German literature.”
Robert Solow (Nobel 1987): “I came back [to 
college after being in the army] and, almost 
without thinking about it, signed up to finish my 
undergraduate degree as an economics major. 
The time was such that I had to make a decision in 
a hurry. No doubt I acted as if I were maximizing 
Nobel Macroeconomists
an infinite discounted sum of one-period utilities, 
but you couldn’t prove it by me. To me it felt as if 
I were saying to myself: ‘What the hell.’”
Robert Lucas (Nobel 1995): “In public school 
science was an unending and not very well 
organized list of things other people had discov­
ered long ago. In college, I learned something 
about the process of scientific discovery, but 
what I learned did not attract me as a career 
­possibility. . . . What I liked thinking about were 
politics and social issues.”
George Akerlof (Nobel 2001): “When I went to 
Yale, I was convinced that I wanted to be either an 
economist or an historian. Really, for me it was a 
distinction without a difference. If I was going to 
be an historian, then I would be an economic his­
torian. And if I was to be an economist, I would 
consider history as the basis for my economics.”
Edward Prescott (Nobel 2004): “Through discus­
sion with [my father], I learned a lot about the 
way businesses operated. This was one reason 
why I liked my microeconomics course so much 
in my first year at Swarthmore College. The price 
theory that I learned in that course rationalized 
what I had learned from him about the way busi­
nesses operate. The other reason was the textbook 
used in that course, Paul A. Samuelson’s Principles 
of Economics. I loved the way Samuelson laid out 
the theory in his textbook, so simply and clearly.”
Edmund Phelps (Nobel 2006): “Like most Amer­
icans entering college, I started at Amherst Col­
lege without a predetermined course of study or 
without even a career goal. My tacit assumption 
was that I would drift into the world of ­business—
of money, doing something terribly smart. In 
the first year, though, I was awestruck by Plato, 
Hume, and James. I would probably have gone 
into philosophy were it not that my father cajoled 
and pleaded with me to try a course in econom­
ics, which I did the second year. . . . I was hugely 
impressed to see that it was possible to subject 
the events in those newspapers I had read about 
to a formal sort of analysis.”
Christopher Sims (Nobel 2011): “[My Uncle] 
Mark prodded me regularly, from about age 13

 1-3   How This Book Proceeds
This book has six parts. This chapter and the next make up Part One, the 
“­Introduction.” Chapter 2 discusses how economists measure economic vari­
ables, such as aggregate income, the inflation rate, and the unemployment rate.
Part Two, “Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run,” presents the 
classical model of how the economy works. The key assumption of the classical 
model is that prices are flexible. That is, with rare exceptions, the classical model 
assumes that markets clear. The assumption of price flexibility greatly simplifies 
the analysis, which is why we start with it. Yet because this assumption accurately 
describes the economy only in the long run, classical theory is best suited for 
analyzing a time horizon of at least several years.
Part Three, “Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run,” builds on 
the classical model. It maintains the assumptions of price flexibility and market 
clearing but adds a new emphasis on growth in the capital stock, the labor force, 
and technological knowledge. Growth theory is designed to explain how the 
economy evolves over a period of several decades.
Part Four, “Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run,” exam­
ines the behavior of the economy when prices are sticky. The non-market-
clearing model developed here is designed to analyze short-run issues, such as 
the reasons for economic fluctuations and the influence of government policy 
on those fluctuations. It is best suited for analyzing the changes in the economy 
we observe from month to month or from year to year.
The last two parts of the book cover various topics to supplement, reinforce, 
and refine our long-run and short-run analyses. Part Five, “Topics in Macroeco­
nomic Theory,” presents advanced material of a somewhat theoretical nature, 
including macroeconomic dynamics, models of consumer behavior, and theories 
of firms’ investment decisions. Part Six, “Topics in Macroeconomic Policy,” con­
siders what role the government should have in the economy. It discusses the 
policy debates over stabilization policy, government debt, and financial crises.

I took my first course in economics, I remember

argument to support it. For years I thought he 
was having the opposite of his intended effect, 
and I studied no economics until my junior

Summary
	1.	Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole, including growth 
in incomes, changes in prices, and the rate of unemployment. Macroecono­
mists attempt both to explain economic events and to devise policies to 
improve economic performance.
	2.	To understand the economy, economists use models—theories that simplify 
reality in order to reveal how exogenous variables influence endogenous 
variables. The art in the science of economics lies in judging whether a 
model captures the important economic relationships for the matter at 
hand. Because no single model can answer all questions, macroeconomists 
use different models to look at different issues.
	3.	A key feature of a macroeconomic model is whether it assumes that prices 
are flexible or sticky. According to most macroeconomists, models with 
flexible prices describe the economy in the long run, whereas models with 
sticky prices offer a better description of the economy in the short run.
	4.	Microeconomics is the study of how firms and individuals make decisions 
and how these decisionmakers interact. Because macroeconomic events 
arise from many microeconomic interactions, all macroeconomic models 
must be consistent with microeconomic foundations, even if those founda­
tions are only implicit.

S
cientists, economists, and detectives have much in common: they all 
want to figure out what’s going on in the world around them. To do 
this, they rely on theory and observation. They build theories in an 
attempt to make sense of what they see happening. They then turn to more 
systematic observation to evaluate the theories’ validity. Only when theory 
and evidence come into line do they feel they understand the situation. This 
chapter discusses the types of observation that economists use to develop and 
test their theories.
Casual observation is one source of information about what’s happening in 
the economy. When you go shopping, you notice whether prices are rising, 
falling, or staying the same. When you look for a job, you learn whether firms 
are hiring. Every day, as we go about our lives, we participate in some aspect of 
the economy and get some sense of economic conditions.
A century ago, economists monitoring the economy had little more to go on 
than such casual observations. Such fragmentary information made economic 
policymaking difficult. One person’s anecdote would suggest the economy was 
moving in one direction, while another’s would suggest otherwise. Economists 
needed some way to combine many individual experiences into a coherent 
whole. There was an obvious solution: as the old quip goes, the plural of 
“anecdote” is “data.”
Today, economic data offer a systematic and objective source of information, 
and almost every day you can hear or read a story about some newly released 
statistic. Most of these statistics are produced by the government. Various gov­
ernment agencies survey households and firms to learn about their economic 
activity—how much they are earning, what they are buying, what prices they 
are charging, how much they are producing, and so on. From these surveys, the 
government computes various statistics that summarize the state of the economy. 
Economists use these statistics to study the economy; policymakers use them to 
monitor developments and formulate policies.

The Data of Macroeconomics
It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to 
twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to fit facts.

18 |  P A R T  I   Introduction
This chapter focuses on the three statistics that economists and policymakers 
use most often. Gross domestic product, or GDP, tells us the nation’s total 
income and the total expenditure on its output of goods and services. The 
consumer price index, or CPI, measures the level of prices. The unemployment 
rate tells us the fraction of workers who are unemployed. In the following 
pages, we see how these statistics are computed and what they tell us about 
the economy.
 2-1   Measuring the Value of Economic 
Activity: Gross Domestic Product
Gross domestic product, or GDP, is often considered the best measure of 
how well an economy is performing. In the United States, this statistic is com­
puted every three months by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a part of the U.S. 
Department of Commerce, from a large number of primary data sources. These 
primary sources include both (1) administrative data, which are byproducts of 
government functions such as tax collection, education programs, defense, and 
regulation, and (2) statistical data, which come from government surveys of, for 
example, retail establishments, manufacturing firms, and farms. The purpose of 
GDP is to summarize all these data with a single number representing the dollar 
value of economic activity in a given period of time.
There are two ways to view this statistic. One way to view GDP is as the 
total income of everyone in the economy; another way is as the total expenditure on the 
economy’s output of goods and services. From either viewpoint, it is clear why GDP 
is a gauge of economic performance. GDP measures something people care 
about—their incomes. Similarly, an economy with a large output of goods and 
services can better satisfy the demands of households, firms, and the government.
How can GDP measure both the economy’s income and its expenditure 
on output? The reason is that these two quantities are really the same: for the 
economy as a whole, income must equal expenditure. That fact, in turn, follows 
from an even more fundamental one: because every transaction has a buyer and a 
seller, every dollar of expenditure by a buyer must become a dollar of income to 
a seller. When Jack paints Jill’s house for $10,000, that $10,000 is income to Jack 
and expenditure by Jill. The transaction contributes $10,000 to GDP, regardless 
of whether we are adding up all income or all expenditure.
To understand the meaning of GDP more fully, we turn to national income 
accounting, the system used to measure GDP and many related statistics.
Income, Expenditure, and the Circular Flow
Imagine an economy that produces a single good, bread, from a single input, 
labor. Figure 2-1 illustrates all the economic transactions that occur between 
households and firms in this economy.

C H A P T E R  2   The Data of Macroeconomics  | 19
The inner loop in Figure 2-1 represents the flows of bread and labor. 
The households sell their labor to the firms. The firms use the labor of their 
workers to produce bread, which the firms in turn sell to the households. 
Hence, labor flows from households to firms, and bread flows from firms to 
households.
The outer loop in Figure 2-1 represents the corresponding flow of dollars. 
The households buy bread from the firms. The firms use some of the revenue 
from these sales to pay the wages of their workers, and the remainder is the 
profit belonging to the owners of the firms (who themselves are part of 
the household sector). Hence, expenditure on bread flows from households 
to firms, and income in the form of wages and profit flows from firms to 
­households.
GDP measures the flow of dollars in this economy. We can compute it 
in two ways. GDP is the total income from the production of bread, which 
equals the sum of wages and profit—the top half of the circular flow of dollars. 
GDP is also the total expenditure on purchases of bread—the bottom half of 
the circular flow of dollars. To compute GDP, we can look at either the flow 
of dollars from firms to households or the flow of dollars from households 
to firms.

The Circular Flow  
This figure illustrates 
the flows between firms 
and households in an 
economy that produces 
one good, bread, from 
one input, labor. The 
inner loop represents 
the flows of labor and 
bread: households sell 
their labor to firms, 
and the firms sell the 
bread they produce to 
households. The outer 
loop represents the 
corresponding flows 
of dollars: households 
pay the firms for the 
bread, and the firms 
pay wages and profit to 
the households. In this 
economy, GDP is both 
the total expenditure 
on bread and the total 
income from the pro­
duction of bread.

20 |  P A R T  I   Introduction
These two ways of computing GDP must be equal because, by the rules 
of accounting, the expenditure of buyers on products is income to the sell­
ers of those products. Every transaction that affects expenditure must affect 
income, and every transaction that affects income must affect expenditure. 
For example, suppose that a firm produces and sells one more loaf of bread 
to a household. Clearly this transaction raises total expenditure on bread, but 
it also has an equal effect on total income. If the firm produces the extra loaf 
without hiring any more labor (such as by making the production process 
more efficient), then profit increases. If the firm produces the extra loaf by 
hiring more labor, then wages increase. In both cases, expenditure and income 
increase equally.
Many economic variables measure a quantity 
of something—a quantity of money, a quan­
tity of goods, and so on. Economists distinguish 
between two types of quantity variables: stocks 
and flows. A stock is a quantity measured at a 
given point in time, whereas a flow is a quantity 
measured per unit of time.
A bathtub, shown in Figure 2-2, is the classic 
example used to illustrate stocks and flows. The 
amount of water in the tub is a stock: it is the 
quantity of water in the tub at a given point in 
time. The amount of water coming out of the 
faucet is a flow: it is the quantity of water being 
added to the tub per unit of time. Note that 
we measure stocks and flows in different units. 
We say that the bathtub contains 50 gallons of 
water but that water is coming out of the faucet 
at 5 gallons per minute.
GDP is probably the most important flow 
variable in economics: it tells us how many dol­
lars are flowing around the economy’s circular 
flow per unit of time. When someone says that 
the U.S. GDP is $17 trillion, this means that it is 
$17 trillion per year. (Equivalently, we could say 
that U.S. GDP is $539,000 per second.)
Stocks and flows are often related. In the 
bathtub example, these relationships are clear. 
The stock of water in the tub represents the accu­
mulation of the flow out of the faucet, and the 
flow of water represents the change in the stock. 
When building theories to explain economic 
variables, it is often useful to determine whether 
the variables are stocks or flows and whether any 
relationships link them.
Here are some examples of related stocks and 
flows that we study in future chapters:
■	 A person’s wealth is a stock; his income and 
expenditure are flows.
■	 The number of unemployed people is a stock; 
the number of people losing their jobs is a flow.
■	 The amount of capital in the economy is a 
stock; the amount of investment is a flow.
■	 The government debt is a stock; the govern­
ment budget deficit is a flow.

Rules for Computing GDP
In an economy that produces only bread, we can compute GDP by adding up 
the total expenditure on bread. Real economies, however, include the produc­
tion and sale of a vast number of goods and services. To compute GDP for such 
a complex economy, it will be helpful to have a more precise definition: Gross 
domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services produced within 
an economy in a given period of time. To see how this definition is applied, let’s dis­
cuss some of the rules that economists follow in constructing this statistic.
Adding Apples and Oranges The U.S. economy produces many differ­
ent goods and services—hamburgers, haircuts, cars, computers, and so on. GDP 
combines the value of these goods and services into a single measure. The diver­
sity of products in the economy complicates the calculation of GDP because 
different products have different values.
Suppose, for example, that the economy produces four apples and three 
oranges. How do we compute GDP? We could simply add apples and oranges 
and conclude that GDP equals seven pieces of fruit. But this makes sense only 
if we think apples and oranges have equal value, which is generally not true. 
(This would be even clearer if the economy produces four watermelons and 
three grapes.)
To compute the total value of different goods and services, the national 
income accounts use market prices because these prices reflect how much people 
are willing to pay for a good or service. Thus, if apples cost $0.50 each and 
oranges cost $1.00 each, GDP would be
	GDP  (Price of Apples  Quantity of Apples)
	
 (Price of Oranges  Quantity of Oranges)
  ($0.50 3 4)  ($1.00  3)
	 $5.00.
GDP equals $5.00—the value of all the apples, $2.00, plus the value of all the 
oranges, $3.00.
Used Goods When the Topps Company makes a pack of baseball cards and 
sells it for $2, that $2 is added to the nation’s GDP. But when a collector sells a 
rare Mickey Mantle card to another collector for $500, that $500 is not part of 
GDP. GDP measures the value of currently produced goods and services. The sale 
of the Mickey Mantle card reflects the transfer of an asset, not an addition to the 
economy’s income. Thus, the sale of used goods is not included as part of GDP.
The Treatment of Inventories  Imagine that a bakery hires workers to 
produce more bread, pays their wages, and then fails to sell the additional bread. 
How does this transaction affect GDP?
The answer depends on what happens to the unsold bread. Let’s first suppose 
that the bread spoils. In this case, the firm has paid more in wages but has not 
received any additional revenue, so the firm’s profit is reduced by the amount that 
wages have increased. Total expenditure in the economy hasn’t changed because 

22 |  P A R T  I   Introduction
no one buys the bread. Total income hasn’t changed either—although more is 
distributed as wages and less as profit. Because the transaction affects neither 
expenditure nor income, it does not alter GDP.
Now suppose, instead, that the bread is put into inventory (perhaps as frozen 
dough) to be sold later. In this case, the national income accounts treat the 
transaction differently. The owners of the firm are assumed to have “purchased” 
the bread for the firm’s inventory, and the firm’s profit is not reduced by the 
additional wages it has paid. Because the higher wages paid to the firm’s workers 
raise total income, and the greater spending by the firm’s owners on inventory 
raises total expenditure, the economy’s GDP rises.
What happens later when the firm sells the bread out of inventory? This case is 
much like the sale of a used good. There is spending by bread consumers, but there 
is inventory disinvestment by the firm. This negative spending by the firm offsets the 
positive spending by consumers, so the sale out of inventory does not affect GDP.
The general rule is that when a firm increases its inventory of goods, this 
investment in inventory is counted as an expenditure by the firm owners. Thus, 
production for inventory increases GDP just as much as does production for 
final sale. A sale out of inventory, however, is a combination of positive spending 
(the purchase) and negative spending (inventory disinvestment), so it does not 
influence GDP. This treatment of inventories ensures that GDP reflects the 
economy’s current production of goods and services.
Intermediate Goods and Value Added  Many goods are produced in stages: 
raw materials are processed into intermediate goods by one firm and then sold to 
another firm for final processing. How should we treat such products when comput­
ing GDP? For example, suppose a cattle rancher sells one-quarter pound of meat to 
McDonald’s for $1, and then McDonald’s sells you a hamburger for $3. Should GDP 
include both the meat and the hamburger (a total of $4) or just the hamburger ($3)?
The answer is that GDP includes only the value of final goods. Thus, the ham­
burger is included in GDP but the meat is not: GDP increases by $3, not by $4. 
The reason is that the value of intermediate goods is already included as part of the 
market price of the final goods in which they are used. To add the intermediate 
goods to the final goods would be double counting—that is, the meat would be 
counted twice. Hence, GDP is the total value of final goods and services produced.
One way to compute the value of all final goods and services is to sum the value 
added at each stage of production. The value added of a firm equals the value of 
the firm’s output less the value of the intermediate goods that the firm purchases. 
In the case of the hamburger, the value added of the rancher is $1 (assuming that 
the rancher bought no intermediate goods), and the value added of McDonald’s is 
$3  $1, or $2. Total value added is $1  $2, which equals $3. For the economy 
as a whole, the sum of all value added must equal the value of all final goods and 
services. Hence, GDP is also the total value added of all firms in the economy.
Housing Services and Other Imputations Although most goods and 
services are valued at their market prices when computing GDP, some are not 
sold in the marketplace and therefore do not have market prices. If GDP is to 
include the value of these goods and services, we must use an estimate of their 
value. Such an estimate is called an imputed value.

C H A P T E R  2   The Data of Macroeconomics  | 23
Imputations are especially important for determining the value of housing. 
A person who rents a house is buying housing services and providing income 
for the landlord; the rent is part of GDP, both as expenditure by the renter and as 
income for the landlord. Many people, however, own their homes. Although they 
do not pay rent to a landlord, they are enjoying housing services similar to those 
that renters purchase. To take account of the housing services enjoyed by home­
owners, GDP includes the “rent” that these homeowners “pay” to themselves. 
Of course, homeowners do not in fact pay themselves this rent. The Department 
of Commerce estimates what the market rent for a house would be if it were 
rented and includes that imputed rent as part of GDP. This imputed rent is 
included both in the homeowner’s expenditure and in the homeowner’s income.
Imputations also arise in valuing government services. For example, police 
officers, firefighters, and senators provide services to the public. Assigning a value 
to these services is difficult because they are not sold in a marketplace and there­
fore do not have a market price. The national income accounts include these 
services in GDP by valuing them at their cost. That is, the wages of these public 
servants are used as a measure of the value of their output.
In many cases, an imputation is called for in principle but, to keep things 
simple, is not made in practice. Because GDP includes the imputed rent on 
owner-occupied houses, one might expect it also to include the imputed rent 
on cars, lawn mowers, jewelry, and other durable goods owned by households. 
Yet the value of these rental services is left out of GDP. In addition, some of the 
output of the economy is produced and consumed at home and never enters the 
marketplace. For example, meals cooked at home are similar to meals cooked at 
a restaurant, yet the value added when a person prepares a meal at home is left 
out of GDP.
Finally, no imputation is made for the value of goods and services sold in the 
underground economy. The underground economy is the part of the economy that 
people hide from the government either because they wish to evade taxation or 
because the activity is illegal. Examples include domestic workers paid “off the 
books” and the illegal drug trade. The size of the underground economy varies 
widely from country to country. In the United States, the underground economy 
is estimated to be less than 10 percent of the official economy, whereas in some 
developing nations, such as Thailand, Nigeria, and Bolivia, the underground 
economy is more than half as large as the official one.
Because the imputations necessary for computing GDP are only approximate, 
and because the value of many goods and services is left out altogether, GDP 
is an imperfect measure of economic activity. These imperfections are most 
problematic when comparing standards of living across countries. Yet as long as 
the magnitude of these imperfections remains fairly constant over time, GDP is 
useful for comparing economic activity from year to year.
Real GDP Versus Nominal GDP
Economists use the rules just described to compute GDP, which values the 
economy’s total output of goods and services. But is GDP a good measure of 
economic well-being? Consider once again the economy that produces only 

24 |  P A R T  I   Introduction
apples and oranges. In this economy, GDP is the sum of the value of all the apples 
produced and the value of all the oranges produced. That is,
GDP  (Price of Apples  Quantity of Apples)
 
 (Price of Oranges  Quantity of Oranges).
Economists call the value of goods and services measured at current prices 
nominal GDP. Notice that nominal GDP can increase either because prices 
rise or because quantities rise.
It is easy to see that GDP computed this way is not a good gauge of eco­
nomic well-being. That is, this measure does not accurately reflect how well the 
economy can satisfy the demands of households, firms, and the government. 
If all prices doubled without any change in quantities, nominal GDP would 
double. Yet it would be misleading to say that the economy’s ability to satisfy 
demands has doubled because the quantity of every good produced remains 
the same.
A better measure of economic well-being would tally the economy’s output 
of goods and services without being influenced by changes in prices. For this 
purpose, economists use real GDP, which is the value of goods and services 
measured using a constant set of prices. That is, real GDP shows what would 
have happened to expenditure on output if quantities had changed but prices 
had not.
To see how real GDP is computed, imagine we want to compare output 
in 2014 with output in subsequent years for our apple-and-orange economy. 
We could begin by choosing a set of prices, called base-year prices, such as the 
prices that prevailed in 2014. Goods and services are then added up using these 
base-year prices to value the different goods in each year. Real GDP for 2014 
would be
Real GDP  (2014 Price of Apples  2014 Quantity of Apples)
 
 (2014 Price of Oranges  2014 Quantity of Oranges).
Similarly, real GDP in 2015 would be
Real GDP  (2014 Price of Apples  2015 Quantity of Apples)
 
 (2014 Price of Oranges  2015 Quantity of Oranges).
And real GDP in 2016 would be
Real GDP  (2014 Price of Apples  2016 Quantity of Apples)
	
 (2014 Price of Oranges  2016 Quantity of Oranges).
Notice that 2014 prices are used to compute real GDP for all three years. 
Because the prices are held constant, real GDP varies from year to year only 
if the quantities produced vary. Because a society’s ability to provide economic 
satisfaction for its members ultimately depends on the quantities of goods and 
services produced, real GDP provides a better measure of economic well-being 
than does nominal GDP.

The GDP Deflator
From nominal GDP and real GDP we can compute a third statistic: the GDP 
deflator. The GDP deflator, also called the implicit price deflator for GDP, is the 
ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP:
GDP Deflator  Nominal GDP
Real GDP
.
The GDP deflator reflects what’s happening to the overall level of prices in the 
economy.
To better understand this, consider again an economy with only one good, 
bread. If P is the price of bread and Q is the quantity sold, then nominal GDP 
is the total number of dollars spent on bread in that year, P 3 Q. Real GDP is 
the number of loaves of bread produced in that year times the price of bread in 
some base year, Pbase 3 Q. The GDP deflator is the price of bread in that year 
relative to the price of bread in the base year, P/Pbase.
The definition of the GDP deflator allows us to separate nominal GDP into 
two parts: one part measures quantities (real GDP) and the other measures prices 
(the GDP deflator). That is,
Nominal GDP  Real GDP  GDP Deflator.
Nominal GDP measures the current dollar value of the output of the economy. Real GDP 
measures output valued at constant prices. The GDP deflator measures the price of output 
relative to its price in the base year. We can also write this equation as
Real GDP  Nominal GDP
GDP Deflator .
In this form, you can see how the deflator earns its name: it is used to deflate 
(that is, take inflation out of ) nominal GDP to yield real GDP.
Chain-Weighted Measures of Real GDP
We have been discussing real GDP as if the prices used to compute this 
measure never change from their base-year values. If this were truly the case, 
over time the prices would become more and more dated. For instance, the 
price of computers has fallen substantially in recent years, while the price of 
a year at college has risen. When valuing the production of computers and 
education, it would be misleading to use the prices that prevailed ten or twenty 
years ago.
To solve this problem, the Bureau of Economic Analysis used to periodically 
update the prices used to compute real GDP. About every five years, a new 
base year was chosen. The prices were then held fixed and used to measure 
year-to-year changes in the production of goods and services until the base year 
was updated once again.
In 1995, the Bureau announced a new policy for dealing with changes in 
the base year. In particular, it now uses chain-weighted measures of real GDP. 

26 |  P A R T  I   Introduction
With these new measures, the base year changes continuously over time. 
In essence, average prices in 2014 and 2015 are used to measure real growth 
from 2014 to 2015, average prices in 2015 and 2016 are used to measure real 
growth from 2015 to 2016, and so on. These various year-to-year growth rates 
are then put together to form a “chain” that can be used to compare the output 
of goods and services between any two dates.
This new chain-weighted measure of real GDP is better than the more 
traditional measure because it ensures that the prices used to compute real 
GDP are never far out of date. For most purposes, however, the differences 
are not significant. It turns out that the two measures of real GDP are highly 
correlated with each other. As a practical matter, both measures of real GDP 
reflect the same thing: economy-wide changes in the production of goods 
and services.
For manipulating many relationships in econom­
ics, there is an arithmetic trick that is useful to 
know: The percentage change of a product of two vari­
ables is approximately the sum of the percentage changes 
in each of the variables.
To see how this trick works, consider an 
example. Let P denote the GDP deflator and Y 
denote real GDP. Nominal GDP is P 3 Y. The 
trick states that
Percentage Change in (P  Y) 
 (Percentage Change in P) 
 (Percentage Change in Y).
For instance, suppose that in one year, real GDP 
is 100 and the GDP deflator is 2; the next year, 
real GDP is 103 and the GDP deflator is 2.1. 
We can calculate that real GDP rose by 3 percent 
and that the GDP deflator rose by 5 percent. 
Nominal GDP rose from 200 the first year to 
216.3 the second year, an increase of 8.15 per­
cent. Notice that the growth in nominal GDP 
Two Arithmetic Tricks for Working with 
Percentage Changes
(8.15 percent) is approximately the sum of the 
growth in the GDP deflator (5 percent) and the 
growth in real GDP (3 percent).1
A second arithmetic trick follows as a corol­
lary to the first: The percentage change of a ratio is 
approximately the percentage change in the numera­
tor minus the percentage change in the denominator. 
Again, consider an example. Let Y denote GDP 
and L denote the population, so that Y/L is GDP 
per person. The second trick states that
Percentage Change in (Y/L) 
     (Percentage Change in Y) 
     (Percentage Change in L).
For instance, suppose that in the first year, Y is 
100,000 and L is 100, so Y/L is 1,000; in the 
second year, Y is 110,000 and L is 103, so Y/L is 
1,068. Notice that the growth in GDP per person 
(6.8 percent) is approximately the growth in 
income (10 percent) minus the growth in popu­
lation (3 percent).

1Mathematical note: The proof that this trick works begins with the product rule from calculus:
d(PY) 5 Y dP 1 P dY.
Now divide both sides of this equation by PY to obtain:
d(PY)/(PY) 5 dP/P 1 dY/Y.
Notice that all three terms in this equation are percentage changes.

The Components of Expenditure
Economists and policymakers care not only about the economy’s total output of 
goods and services but also about the allocation of this output among alternative 
uses. The national income accounts divide GDP into four broad categories of 
spending:
n	 Consumption (C )
n	 Investment (I )
n	 Government purchases (G )
n	 Net exports (NX ).
Thus, letting Y stand for GDP,
Y 5 C 1 I 1 G 1 NX.
GDP is the sum of consumption, investment, government purchases, and net 
exports. Each dollar of GDP falls into one of these categories. This equation is an 
identity—an equation that must hold because of the way the variables are defined. 
It is called the national income accounts identity.
Consumption consists of household expenditures on goods and services. 
Goods are tangible items, and they in turn are divided into durables and non­
durables. Durable goods are goods that last a long time, such as cars and TVs. 
Nondurable goods are goods that last only a short time, such as food and cloth­
ing. Services include various intangible items that consumers buy, such as haircuts 
and doctor visits.
Investment consists of items bought for future use. Investment is divided 
into three subcategories: business fixed investment, residential fixed investment, 
and inventory investment. Business fixed investment, also called nonresidential 
fixed investment, is the purchase by firms of new structures, equipment, and 
intellectual property products. (Intellectual property products include software, 
research and development, and entertainment, literary, and artistic originals.) 
Residential investment is the purchase of new housing by households and 
landlords. Inventory investment is the increase in firms’ inventories of goods 
(if inventories are falling, inventory investment is negative).
Government purchases are the goods and services bought by federal, state, 
and local governments. This category includes such items as military equipment, 
highways, and the services provided by government workers. It does not include 
transfer payments to individuals, such as Social Security and welfare. Because 
transfer payments reallocate existing income and are not made in exchange for 
goods and services, they are not part of GDP.
The last category, net exports, accounts for trade with other countries. Net 
exports are the value of goods and services sold to other countries (exports) 
minus the value of goods and services that foreigners sell us (imports). Net 
exports are positive when the value of our exports is greater than the value of 
our imports and negative when the value of our imports is greater than the value 
of our exports. Net exports represent the net expenditure from abroad on our 
goods and services, which provides income for domestic producers.

28 |  P A R T  I   Introduction
Newcomers to macroeconomics are sometimes 
confused by how macroeconomists use familiar 
words in new and specific ways. One example 
is the term “investment.” The confusion arises 
because what looks like investment for an indi­
vidual may not be investment for the economy as 
a whole. The general rule is that the economy’s 
investment does not include purchases that 
merely reallocate existing assets among differ­
ent individuals. Investment, as macroeconomists 
use the term, creates a new physical asset, called 
capital, which can be used in future production.
Let’s consider some examples. Suppose we 
observe these two events:
■	 Smith buys himself a 100-year-old Victorian 
house.
■	 Jones builds herself a brand-new contempo­
rary house.
What is total investment here? Two houses, one 
house, or zero?
A macroeconomist seeing these two transac­
tions counts only the Jones house as investment. 
What Is Investment?
Smith’s transaction has not created new hous­
ing for the economy; it has merely reallocated 
existing housing to Smith from the previous 
owner. By contrast, because Jones has added 
new housing to the economy, her new house is 
counted as investment.
Similarly, consider these two events:
■	 Gates buys $5 million in IBM stock from 
Buffett on the New York Stock Exchange.
■	 General Motors sells $10 million in stock to 
the public and uses the proceeds to build a 
new car factory.
Here, investment is $10 million. The first trans­
action reallocates ownership of shares in IBM 
from Buffett to Gates; the economy’s stock of 
capital is unchanged, so there is no investment 
as macroeconomists use the term. By contrast, 
because General Motors is using some of the 
economy’s output of goods and services to add 
to its stock of capital, its new factory is counted 
as investment.

GDP and Its Components
In 2013, the GDP of the United States totaled about $16.8 trillion. This number 
is so large that it is almost impossible to comprehend. We can make it easier to 
understand by dividing it by the 2013 U.S. population of 316 million. In this 
way, we obtain GDP per person—the amount of expenditure for the average 
American—which equaled $53,142 in 2010.
How did this GDP get used? Table 2-1 shows that about two-thirds of it, 
or $36,382 per person, was spent on consumption. Investment was $8,446 per 
person. Government purchases were $9,887 per person, $2,438 of which was 
spent by the federal government on national defense.
The average American bought $8,722 of goods imported from abroad and 
produced $7,149 of goods that were exported to other countries. Because the 
average American imported more than he exported, net exports were negative. 
Furthermore, because the average American earned less from selling to foreigners 
than he spent on foreign goods, he must have financed the difference by taking 
out loans from foreigners (or, equivalently, by selling them some of his assets). 
Thus, the average American borrowed $1,573 from abroad in 2013. n

Other Measures of Income
The national income accounts include other measures of income that differ 
slightly in definition from GDP. It is important to be aware of the various mea­
sures, because economists and the media often refer to them.
To see how the alternative measures of income relate to one another, we 
start with GDP and modify it in various ways. To obtain gross national product 
(GNP), we add to GDP receipts of factor income (wages, profit, and rent) 
from the rest of the world and subtract payments of factor income to the rest 
of the world:
GNP 5 GDP 1 Factor Payments from Abroad 2 Factor Payments to Abroad.
Whereas GDP measures the total income produced domestically, GNP measures 
the total income earned by nationals (residents of a nation). For instance, if a 
Japanese resident owns an apartment building in New York, the rental income he 
earns is part of U.S. GDP because it is earned in the United States. But because 
this rental income is a factor payment to abroad, it is not part of U.S. GNP. In the 
United States, factor payments from abroad and factor payments to abroad are 
similar in size—each representing about 4 percent of GDP—so GDP and GNP 
are quite close.

30 |  P A R T  I   Introduction
To obtain net national product (NNP), we subtract from GNP the depreciation 
of capital—the amount of the economy’s stock of plants, equipment, and resi­
dential structures that wears out during the year:
NNP 5 GNP 2 Depreciation.
In the national income accounts, depreciation is called the consumption of fixed 
capital. It equals about 16 percent of GNP. Because the depreciation of capital is 
a cost of producing the output of the economy, subtracting depreciation shows 
the net result of economic activity.
Net national product is approximately equal to another measure called national 
income. The two differ by a small correction called the statistical discrepancy, which 
arises because different data sources may not be completely consistent.
National Income 5 NNP 2 Statistical Discrepancy.
National income measures how much everyone in the economy has earned.
The national income accounts divide national income into six components, 
depending on who earns the income. The six categories, and the percentage of 
national income paid in each category in 2013, are the following:
n	 Compensation of employees (61%). The wages and fringe benefits earned by 
workers.
n	 Proprietors’ income (9%). The income of noncorporate businesses, such as 
small farms, mom-and-pop stores, and law partnerships.
n	 Rental income (4%). The income that landlords receive, including the 
imputed rent that homeowners “pay” to themselves, less expenses, such as 
depreciation.
n	 Corporate profits (15%). The income of corporations after payments to 
their workers and creditors.
n	 Net interest (3%). The interest domestic businesses pay minus the interest 
they receive, plus interest earned from foreigners.
n	 Taxes on production and imports (8%). Certain taxes on businesses, such as 
sales taxes, less offsetting business subsidies. These taxes place a wedge 
between the price that consumers pay for a good and the price that 
firms receive.
A series of adjustments take us from national income to personal income, the 
amount of income that households and noncorporate businesses receive. Four 
of these adjustments are most important. First, we subtract taxes on production 
and imports because these taxes never enter anyone’s income. Second, we reduce 
national income by the amount that corporations earn but do not pay out, 
either because the corporations are retaining earnings or because they are pay­
ing taxes to the government. This adjustment is made by subtracting corporate 
profits (which equal the sum of corporate taxes, dividends, and retained earnings) 
and adding back dividends. Third, we increase national income by the net 
amount the government pays out in transfer payments. This adjustment equals 

C H A P T E R  2   The Data of Macroeconomics  | 31
government transfers to individuals minus social insurance contributions paid to 
the government. Fourth, we adjust national income to include the interest that 
households earn rather than the interest that businesses pay. This adjustment is 
made by adding personal interest income and subtracting net interest. (The dif­
ference between personal interest and net interest arises in part because interest 
on the government debt is part of the interest that households earn but is not 
part of the interest that businesses pay out.) Thus,
	
Personal Income 5 National Income
	
2 Indirect Business Taxes
	
2 Corporate Profits
	
2 Social Insurance Contributions
	
2 Net Interest
	
1 Dividends
	
1 Government Transfers to Individuals
	
1 Personal Interest Income.
Next, if we subtract personal taxes, we obtain disposable personal income:
Disposable Personal Income 5 Personal Income 2 Personal Taxes.
We are interested in disposable personal income because it is the amount house­
holds and noncorporate businesses have available to spend after satisfying their 
tax obligations to the government.
Seasonal Adjustment
Because real GDP and the other measures of income reflect how well the econ­
omy is performing, economists are interested in studying the quarter-to-quarter 
fluctuations in these variables. Yet when we start to do so, one fact leaps out: all 
these measures of income exhibit a regular seasonal pattern. The output of the 
economy rises during the year, reaching a peak in the fourth quarter (October, 
November, and December) and then falling in the first quarter (January, February, 
and March) of the next year. These regular seasonal changes are substantial. From 
the fourth quarter to the first quarter, real GDP falls on average about 8 percent.2
It is not surprising that real GDP follows a seasonal cycle. Some of these 
changes are attributable to changes in our ability to produce: for example, 
­building homes is more difficult during the cold weather of winter than during 
other seasons. In addition, people have seasonal tastes: they have preferred times 
for such activities as vacations and Christmas shopping.
2Robert B. Barsky and Jeffrey A. Miron, “The Seasonal Cycle and the Business Cycle,” Journal of 
Political Economy 97 (June 1989): 503–534.

32 |  P A R T  I   Introduction
When economists study fluctuations in real GDP and other economic vari­
ables, they often want to eliminate the portion of fluctuations due to predictable 
seasonal changes. You will find that most of the economic statistics reported 
are seasonally adjusted. This means that the data have been adjusted to remove 
the regular seasonal fluctuations. (The precise statistical procedures used are too 
elaborate to discuss here, but in essence they involve subtracting those changes 
in income that are predictable just from the change in season.) Therefore, when 
you observe a rise or fall in real GDP or any other data series, you must look 
beyond the seasonal cycle for the explanation.3
The New, Improved GDP of 2013
The Bureau of Economic Analysis regularly updates the procedures used to calculate 
GDP and the many other statistics in the national income accounts. An especially 
important revision occurred in 2013. Here are some questions you might ask about it.
Q: Do I really need to read about this? Data revision sounds boring.
A: Normally, it is. But this time is different. The BEA made some interesting 
changes.
Q: Okay, what changes?
A: First of all, think about some old movie you like watching, such as Titanic 
or Star Wars.
Q: Yeah, those are good films. What about them?
A: When they were produced many years ago, the BEA’s national income 
accountants had to figure out how to treat the expenditures of the production 
companies on actors, film crews, sets, and so on.
Q: What did they do?
A: They treated those expenditures as spending on intermediate goods. 
Ticket sales were considered the final good. As a result, a movie’s contribution 
to GDP in the year it was created was only the revenue earned from ticket 
sales that year.
Q: That sounds reasonable. What’s wrong with it?
A: A popular movie such as Titanic or Star Wars can be watched by viewers 
and thus generate income for its creators for many years. A person who owns 
the rights to a movie has something of value, just as if he owned a factory or 
a house. So, in 2013, the BEA changed its mind and decided that expenditures

Perspectives 22 no.2 (2008): 193–216.

C H A P T E R  2   The Data of Macroeconomics  | 33
on filming a movie would be treated like expenditures on building a factory 
or a house. These expenditures are now added to the investment component 
of GDP.
Q: What about other forms of entertainment?
A: The same is true for the production of other artistic works that are expected 
to have a long life, such as books, music recordings, and TV shows. They are all 
now part of investment. Expenditures to produce short-lived entertainment like 
newspapers and radio shows, however, are not treated as capital investments.
Q: Did anything else change?
A: Yes. The treatment of research and development changed in much the same 
way as the treatment of artistic products. When firms spend money on research 
and development, they are building up a valuable stock of knowledge that they 
can use in the future. Before 2013, research and development was treated as an 
intermediate good. Now, spending on research and development is counted as 
investment.
Q: Why did these changes occur only recently?
A: Traditionally, capital has been viewed as tangible items produced in the 
past and used in the production process. Think of a farmer’s tractor or a wood­
worker’s lathe. But the modern economy is very different from the one when 
the national income accounts were first devised. As the economy has evolved 
away from agriculture and manufacturing, production is increasingly based on 
less tangible intellectual capital, including artistic works and the knowledge from 
research and development. The national income accounts needed to keep pace 
with the changing world.
Q: Are these data revisions a big deal?
A: Counting the production of entertainment originals as investment added 
about 0.5 percent to GDP. Counting research and development as investment 
added about 2 percent more.
Q: Does this change mean we cannot compare GDP before the change with 
GDP afterwards?
A: The BEA knows that people like to compare GDP over time, so when it 
makes a conceptual change like this, it also revises all the old data to be consistent 
with the newer procedures. In a sense, by changing to the new, better treatment 
of artistic works and research and development, the BEA discovered additional 
GDP for previous years. Of course, this extra GDP was really there all along but 
just wasn’t being counted.
Q: You’re right. That was more interesting than I expected. Is there a broader 
lesson here?
A: Yes. The construction of macroeconomic data is often based on judgment 
calls, which can be reevaluated and revised over time. Whenever you use these 
data, keep in mind that they are not perfect, even if they are the best we have. n

 2-2   Measuring the Cost of Living: 
The Consumer Price Index
A dollar today doesn’t buy as much as it did twenty years ago. The cost of almost 
everything has gone up. This increase in the overall level of prices is called 
inflation, and the percentage change in the price level from one period to the 
next is called the inflation rate. Inflation is a primary concern of economists and 
policymakers. In later chapters we examine in detail the causes and effects of 
inflation. Here we discuss how economists measure changes in the cost of living.
The Price of a Basket of Goods
The most commonly used measure of the level of prices is the consumer price 
index (CPI). The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is part of the U.S. Depart­
ment of Labor, has the job of computing the CPI. It begins by collecting the 
prices of thousands of goods and services. Just as GDP turns the quantities of 
many goods and services into a single number measuring the value of produc­
tion, the CPI turns the prices of many goods and services into a single index 
measuring the overall level of prices.
How should economists aggregate the many prices in the economy into a 
single index that reliably measures the price level? They could simply compute 
an average of all prices. But this approach would treat all goods and services 
equally. Because people buy more chicken than caviar, the price of chicken 
should have a greater weight in the CPI than the price of caviar. The Bureau 
of Labor Statistics weights different items by computing the price of a basket 
of goods and services purchased by a typical consumer. The CPI is the price 
of this basket of goods and services relative to the price of the same basket in 
some base year.
For example, suppose that the typical consumer buys five apples and two 
oranges every month. Then the basket of goods consists of five apples and two 
oranges, and the CPI is
CPI. 5 (5 3 Current Price of Apples) 1 (2 3 Current Price of Oranges)
(5 3 2014 Price of Apples) 1 (2 3 2014 Price of Oranges)
 .
In this CPI, 2014 is the base year. The index tells us how much it costs now to 
buy five apples and two oranges relative to how much it cost to buy the same 
basket of fruit in 2014.
The consumer price index is the most closely watched index of prices, but 
it is not the only such index. Another is the producer price index, which measures 
the price of a typical basket of goods bought by firms rather than consumers. 
In addition to these overall price indexes, the Bureau of Labor Statistics com­
putes price indexes for specific types of goods, such as food, housing, and energy. 
Another statistic, sometimes called core inflation, measures the increase in price 
of a consumer basket that excludes food and energy products. Because food and 
energy prices exhibit substantial short-run volatility, core inflation is sometimes 
viewed as a better gauge of ongoing inflation trends.

C H A P T E R  2   The Data of Macroeconomics  | 35
How the CPI Compares to the GDP and PCE Deflators
Earlier in this chapter we saw another measure of prices—the implicit price 
deflator for GDP, which is the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP. The GDP 
deflator and the CPI give somewhat different information about what’s happen­
ing to the overall level of prices in the economy. There are three key differences 
between the two measures.
The first difference is that the GDP deflator measures the prices of all 
goods and services produced, whereas the CPI measures the prices of only the 
goods and services bought by consumers. Thus, an increase in the price of goods 
bought only by firms or the government will show up in the GDP deflator but 
not in the CPI.
The second difference is that the GDP deflator includes only those goods 
produced domestically. Imported goods are not part of GDP and do not show 
up in the GDP deflator. Hence, an increase in the price of Toyotas made in 
Japan and sold in this country affects the CPI, because the Toyotas are bought by 
consumers, but it does not affect the GDP deflator.
The third and most subtle difference results from the way the two measures 
aggregate the many prices in the economy. The CPI assigns fixed weights 
to the prices of different goods, whereas the GDP deflator assigns changing 
weights. In other words, the CPI is computed using a fixed basket of goods, 
whereas the GDP deflator allows the basket of goods to change over time as 
the composition of GDP changes. The following example shows how these 
approaches differ. Suppose that major frosts destroy the nation’s orange crop. 
The quantity of oranges produced falls to zero, and the price of the few oranges 
that remain on grocers’ shelves is driven sky-high. Because oranges are no lon­
ger part of GDP, the increase in the price of oranges does not show up in the 
GDP deflator. But because the CPI is computed with a fixed basket of goods 
that includes oranges, the increase in the price of oranges causes a substantial 
rise in the CPI.
Economists call a price index with a fixed basket of goods a Laspeyres index 
and a price index with a changing basket a Paasche index. Economic theorists 
have studied the properties of these different types of price indexes to determine 
which is a better measure of the cost of living. The answer, it turns out, is that 
neither is clearly superior. When prices of different goods are changing by dif­
ferent amounts, a Laspeyres (fixed basket) index tends to overstate the increase in 
the cost of living because it does not take into account the fact that consumers 
have the opportunity to substitute less expensive goods for more expensive ones. 
By contrast, a Paasche (changing basket) index tends to understate the increase in 
the cost of living. Although it accounts for the substitution of alternative goods, 
it does not reflect the reduction in consumers’ welfare that may result from such 
substitutions.
The example of the destroyed orange crop shows the problems with Laspeyres 
and Paasche price indexes. Because the CPI is a Laspeyres index, it overstates the 
impact of the increase in orange prices on consumers: by using a fixed basket 
of goods, it ignores consumers’ ability to substitute apples for oranges. By con­
trast, because the GDP deflator is a Paasche index, it understates the impact on

consumers: the GDP deflator shows no rise in prices, yet surely the higher price 
of oranges makes consumers worse off.4
In addition to the CPI and the GDP deflator, another noteworthy measure of 
inflation is the implicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures, or 
PCE deflator. The PCE deflator is calculated like the GDP deflator but, rather 
than being based on all of GDP, it is based on only the consumption component 
of GDP. That is, the PCE deflator is the ratio of nominal consumer spending to 
real consumer spending.
The PCE deflator resembles the CPI in some ways and the GDP deflator in 
others. Like the CPI, the PCE deflator includes only the prices of goods and 
services that consumers buy; it excludes the prices of goods and services that are 
part of investment and government purchases. Also like the CPI, the PCE deflator 
includes the prices of imported goods. But like the GDP deflator, the PCE 
deflator allows the basket of goods to change over time as the composition of 
consumer spending changes. Because of this mix of attributes, the Federal Reserve 
uses the PCE deflator as its preferred gauge of how quickly prices are rising.
Luckily, the differences among these various measures of inflation are usually 
small in practice. Figure 2-3 shows inflation as measured by the CPI, the GDP 
deflator, and the PCE deflator for each year from 1948 to 2013. All three mea­
sures usually tell the same story about how quickly prices are rising.
Does the CPI Overstate Inflation?
The consumer price index is a closely watched measure of inflation. Policymakers 
in the Federal Reserve monitor it, along with many other variables, when setting 
monetary policy. In addition, many laws and private contracts have cost-of-living 
allowances, called COLAs, which use the CPI to adjust for changes in the price 
level. For instance, Social Security benefits are adjusted automatically every year 
so that inflation will not erode the living standard of the elderly.
Because so much depends on the CPI, it is important to ensure that this mea­
sure of the price level is accurate. Many economists believe that, for a number of 
reasons, the CPI tends to overstate inflation.
One problem is the substitution bias we have already discussed. Because the 
CPI measures the price of a fixed basket of goods, it does not reflect the ability 
of consumers to substitute toward goods whose relative prices have fallen. Thus, 
when relative prices change, the true cost of living rises less rapidly than does 
the CPI.
A second problem is the introduction of new goods. When a new good is 
introduced into the marketplace, consumers are better off because they have 
more products from which to choose. In effect, the introduction of new goods 
increases the real value of the dollar. Yet this increase in the purchasing power of 
the dollar is not reflected in a lower CPI.
4Because a Laspeyres index overstates inflation and a Paasche index understates it, one might strike 
a compromise by taking an average of the two measured rates of inflation. This is the approach 
taken by another type of index, called a Fisher index.

C H A P T E R  2   The Data of Macroeconomics  | 37
A third problem is unmeasured changes in quality. When a firm changes the 
quality of a good it sells, not all of the good’s price change reflects a change in the 
cost of living. The Bureau of Labor Statistics does its best to account for changes 
in the quality of goods over time. For example, if Ford increases the horsepower 
of a particular car model from one year to the next, the CPI will reflect the 
change: the quality-adjusted price of the car will not rise as fast as the unadjusted 
price. Yet many changes in quality, such as comfort or safety, are hard to measure. 
If unmeasured quality improvement (rather than unmeasured quality deteriora­
tion) is typical, then the measured CPI rises faster than it should.
Because of these measurement problems, some economists have suggested 
revising laws to reduce the degree of indexation. For example, Social Security 
benefits could be indexed to CPI inflation minus 1 percent. Such a change 
would provide a rough way of offsetting these measurement problems. At the 
same time, it would automatically slow the growth in government spending.
In 1995, the Senate Finance Committee appointed a panel of economists 
to study the magnitude of the measurement error in the CPI. The panel con­
cluded that the CPI was biased upward by 0.8 to 1.6 percentage points per year, 
Three Measures of Inflation  This figure shows the percentage change in the CPI, the GDP 
deflator, and the PCE deflator for every year from 1948 to 2013. These measures of prices 
diverge at times, but they usually tell the same story about how quickly prices are rising. 
Both the CPI and the GDP deflator show that prices rose slowly in most of the 1950s and 
1960s, that they rose much more quickly in the 1970s, and that they have risen slowly again 
since the mid-1980s.

changes in the way the CPI is calculated, so the bias is now thought to be under 
1 percentage point. The CPI still overstates inflation, but not by as much as it 
once did.5
 2-3    Measuring Joblessness: 
The Unemployment Rate
One aspect of economic performance is how well an economy uses its 
resources. Because an economy’s workers are its chief resource, keeping 
workers employed is a paramount concern of economic policymakers. The 
unemployment rate is the statistic that measures the percentage of those 
people wanting to work who do not have jobs. Every month, the U.S. Bureau 
of Labor Statistics computes the unemployment rate and many other statistics 
that economists and policymakers use to monitor developments in the labor 
market.
The Household Survey
The unemployment rate comes from a survey of about 60,000 households 
called the Current Population Survey. Based on the responses to survey ques­
tions, each adult (age 16 and older) in each household is placed into one of 
three categories:
■	 Employed. This category includes those who at the time of the survey 
worked as paid employees, worked in their own business, or worked as 
unpaid workers in a family member’s business. It also includes those who 
were not working but who had jobs from which they were temporarily 
absent because of, for example, vacation, illness, or bad weather.
■	 Unemployed. This category includes those who were not employed, were 
available for work, and had tried to find employment during the previous 
four weeks. It also includes those waiting to be recalled to a job from 
which they had been laid off.
■	 Not in the labor force. This category includes those who fit neither of the 
first two categories, such as a full-time student, homemaker, or retiree.
Notice that a person who wants a job but has given up looking—a discouraged 
worker—is counted as not being in the labor force.

C H A P T E R  2   The Data of Macroeconomics  | 39
The labor force is the sum of the employed and unemployed, and the 
unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. 
That is,
Labor Force 5 Number of Employed 1 Number of Unemployed
and
Unemployment Rate 5 Number of Unemployed
Labor Force
 3 100.
A related statistic is the labor-force participation rate, the percentage of the 
adult population that is in the labor force:
Labor-Force Participation Rate 5 
Labor Force
Adult Population 3 100.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics computes these statistics for the overall popula­
tion and for groups within the population: men and women, whites and blacks, 
teenagers and prime-age workers.
Figure 2-4 shows the breakdown of the population into the three categories 
for April 2014. The statistics broke down as follows:
Labor Force 5 145.7 1 9.7 5 155.4 million.
Unemployment Rate 5 (9.7/155.4) 3 100 5 6.2%.
Labor-Force Participation Rate 5 (155.4/247.4) 3 100 5 62.8%.

CASE STUDY
Men, Women, and Labor-Force Participation
The data on the labor market collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics reflect not 
only economic developments, such as the booms and busts of the business cycle, but 
also a variety of social changes. Longer-term social changes in the roles of men and 
women in society, for example, are evident in the data on labor-force participation.
Figure 2-5 shows the labor-force participation rates of men and women in 
the United States from 1950 to 2013. Just after World War II, men and women 
had very different economic roles. Only 34 percent of women were working or 
looking for work, in contrast to 86 percent of men. Since then, the difference 
between the participation rates of men and women has gradually diminished, as 
growing numbers of women have entered the labor force and some men have 
left it. Data for 2013 show that more than 57 percent of women were in the labor 
force, in contrast to 70 percent of men. As measured by labor-force participation, 
men and women are now playing more equal roles in the economy.
There are many reasons for this change. In part, it is due to new tech­
nologies, such as the washing machine, clothes dryer, refrigerator, freezer, and 

C H A P T E R  2   The Data of Macroeconomics  | 41
The Establishment Survey
When the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports the unemployment rate 
every month, it also reports a variety of other statistics describing condi­
tions in the labor market. Some of these statistics, such as the labor-force 
participation rate, are derived from the Current Population Survey. Other 
statistics come from a separate survey of about 160,000 business establish­
ments that employ over 40 million workers. When you read a headline that 
says the economy created a certain number of jobs last month, that statistic is 
the change in the number of workers that businesses report having on their 
payrolls.
Because the BLS conducts two surveys of labor-market conditions, it pro­
duces two measures of total employment. From the household survey, it obtains 
an estimate of the number of people who say they are working. From the 
establishment survey, it obtains an estimate of the number of workers firms have 
on their payrolls.
One might expect these two measures of employment to be identical, but 
that is not the case. Although they are positively correlated, the two measures can 
diverge, especially over short periods of time. An example of a large divergence 
occurred in the early 2000s, as the economy recovered from the recession of 
2001. From November 2001 to August 2003, the establishment survey showed 
a decline in employment of 1.0 million, while the household survey showed an 
increase of 1.4 million. Some commentators said the economy was experiencing 
a “jobless recovery,” but this description applied only to the establishment data, 
not to the household data.
Why might these two measures of employment diverge? Part of the expla­
nation is that the surveys measure different things. For example, a person who 
dishwasher, which have reduced the amount of time required to complete 
routine household tasks. In part, it is due to improved birth control, which 
has reduced the number of children born to the typical family. And in part, 
this change in women’s role is due to changing political and social attitudes. 
Together, these developments have had a profound impact, as demonstrated 
by these data.
Although the increase in women’s labor-force participation is easily explained, 
the fall in men’s participation may seem puzzling. There are several developments 
at work. First, young men now stay in school longer than their fathers and grand­
fathers did. Second, older men now retire earlier and live longer. Third, with 
more women employed, more fathers now stay at home to raise their children. 
Full-time students, retirees, and stay-at-home fathers are all counted as out of 
the labor force.
Figure 2-5 shows that, in the most recent decade, the labor-force participa­
tion rate declined for both men and women. This phenomenon is examined in a 
case study in Chapter 7. We will see that this recent decline is due in part to the 
start of retirement for the large baby-boom generation and in part to the weak 
economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008–2009. n

runs his or her own business is self-employed. The household survey counts that 
person as working, whereas the establishment survey does not because that per­
son does not show up on any firm’s payroll. As another example, a person who 
holds two jobs is counted as one employed person in the household survey but 
is counted twice in the establishment survey because that person would show up 
on the payrolls of two firms.
Another part of the explanation for the divergence is that surveys are imper­
fect. For example, when new firms start up, it may take some time before 
those firms are included in the establishment survey. The BLS tries to estimate 
employment at start-ups, but the model it uses to produce these estimates is 
one possible source of error. A different problem arises from how the household 
survey extrapolates employment among the surveyed households to the entire 
population. If the BLS uses incorrect estimates of the size of the population, these 
errors will be reflected in its estimates of household employment. One possible 
source of incorrect population estimates is changes in the rate of immigration, 
both legal and illegal.
In the end, the divergence between the household and establishment surveys 
from 2001 to 2003 remains a mystery. Some economists believe that the estab­
lishment survey is the more accurate one because it has a larger sample. Yet one 
study suggests that the best measure of employment is an average of the two 
surveys.6
More important than the specifics of these surveys or this particular episode 
when they diverged is the broader lesson: all economic statistics are imperfect. 
Although they contain valuable information about what is happening in the 
economy, each one should be interpreted with a healthy dose of caution and a 
bit of skepticism.
 2-4    Conclusion: From Economic Statistics 
to Economic Models
The three statistics discussed in this chapter—gross domestic product, the 
consumer price index, and the unemployment rate—quantify the perfor­
mance of the economy. Public and private decisionmakers use these statistics 
to monitor changes in the economy and to formulate appropriate policies. 
Economists use these statistics to develop and test theories about how the 
economy works.
In the chapters that follow, we examine some of these theories. That is, we 
build models that explain how these variables are determined and how economic 
policy affects them. Having learned how to measure economic performance, we 
are now ready to learn how to explain it.

Summary
	1.	Gross domestic product (GDP) measures the income of everyone in the 
economy and, equivalently, the total expenditure on the economy’s output 
of goods and services.
	2.	Nominal GDP values goods and services at current prices. Real GDP values 
goods and services at constant prices. Real GDP rises only when the amount 
of goods and services has increased, whereas nominal GDP can rise either 
because output has increased or because prices have increased. The GDP defla­
tor is the ratio of nominal to real GDP and measures the overall level of prices.
	3.	GDP is the sum of four categories of expenditure: consumption, invest­
ment, government purchases, and net exports. This relationship is called the 
national income accounts identity.
	4.	The consumer price index (CPI) measures the price of a fixed basket of 
goods and services purchased by a typical consumer relative to the same 
basket in a base year. Like the GDP deflator and the personal consumption 
expenditure (PCE) deflator, the CPI measures the overall level of prices, but 
unlike the deflators, it does not allow the basket of goods and services to 
change over time as consumers respond to changes in relative prices.
	5.	The labor-force participation rate shows the fraction of adults who are 
working or want to work. The unemployment rate shows the fraction of 
those in the labor force who do not have a job.

National Income: Where It Comes 
From and Where It Goes
A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of.
—Jane Austen
T
he most important macroeconomic variable is gross domestic prod­
uct (GDP). As we have seen, GDP measures both a nation’s total 
output of goods and services and its total income. To appreciate the 
significance of GDP, one need only take a quick look at international data: 
compared with their poorer counterparts, nations with a high level of GDP 
per person have everything from better childhood nutrition to more comput­
ers per household. A large GDP does not ensure that all of a nation’s citizens 
are happy, but it may be the best recipe for happiness that ­macroeconomists 
have to offer.
This chapter addresses four groups of questions about the sources and uses of 
a nation’s GDP:
n	 How much do the firms in the economy produce? What determines a 
nation’s total income?
n	 Who gets the income from production? How much goes to compensate 
workers, and how much goes to compensate owners of capital?
n	 Who buys the output of the economy? How much do households pur­
chase for consumption, how much do households and firms purchase 
for investment, and how much does the government buy for public 
­purposes?
n	 What equilibrates the demand for and supply of goods and services? 
What ensures that desired spending on consumption, investment, and 
government purchases equals the level of production?
To answer these questions, we must examine how the various parts of the econ­
omy interact.
A good place to start is the circular flow diagram. In Chapter 2 we traced the cir­
cular flow of dollars in a hypothetical economy that used one input (labor services)

to produce one output (bread). Figure 3-1 more accurately reflects how real econ­
omies function. It shows the linkages among the economic actors—households, 
firms, and the government—and how dollars flow among them through the vari­
ous markets in the economy.
Let’s look at the flow of dollars from the viewpoints of these economic 
actors. Households receive income and use it to pay taxes to the government, 
to consume goods and services, and to save through the financial markets. 
Firms receive revenue from the sale of the goods and services they produce 
and use it to pay for the factors of production. Households and firms borrow 
in financial markets to buy investment goods, such as houses and factories. 
The government receives revenue from taxes and uses it to pay for govern­
ment purchases. Any excess of tax revenue over government spending is 
called public saving, which can be either positive (a budget surplus) or negative 
(a budget deficit).

In this chapter we develop a basic classical model to explain the economic 
interactions depicted in Figure 3-1. We begin with firms and look at what 
­determines their level of production (and thus the level of national income). 
Then we examine how the markets for the factors of production distribute this 
income to households. Next, we consider how much of this income households 
consume and how much they save. In addition to discussing the demand for 
goods and services arising from the consumption of households, we discuss the 
demand arising from investment and government purchases. Finally, we come 
full circle and examine how the demand for goods and services (the sum of 
consumption, investment, and government purchases) and the supply of goods 
and services (the level of production) are brought into balance.
 3-1   What Determines the Total Production 
of Goods and Services?
An economy’s output of goods and services—its GDP—depends on (1) its quan­
tity of inputs, called the factors of production, and (2) its ability to turn inputs 
into output, as represented by the production function.
The Factors of Production
Factors of production are the inputs used to produce goods and services. The 
two most important factors of production are capital and labor. Capital is the 
set of tools that workers use: the construction worker’s crane, the accountant’s 
calculator, and this author’s personal computer. Labor is the time people spend 
working. We use the symbol K to denote the amount of capital and the symbol 
L to denote the amount of labor.
In this chapter we take the economy’s factors of production as given. In other 
words, we assume that the economy has a fixed amount of capital and a fixed 
amount of labor. We write
K 5 K–.
L 5 L–.
The overbar means that each variable is fixed at some level. In Chapter 8 we 
examine what happens when the factors of production change over time, as 
they do in the real world. For now, to keep our analysis simple, we assume fixed 
amounts of capital and labor.
We also assume here that the factors of production are fully utilized. That 
is, no resources are wasted. Again, in the real world, part of the labor force is 
unemployed, and some capital lies idle. In Chapter 7 we examine the reasons 
for unemployment, but for now we assume that capital and labor are fully 
employed.

50 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
The Production Function
The available production technology determines how much output is produced 
from given amounts of capital and labor. Economists express this relationship 
using a production function. Letting Y denote the amount of output, we write 
the production function as
Y 5 F (K, L).
This equation states that output is a function of the amount of capital and the 
amount of labor.
The production function reflects the available technology for turning capital 
and labor into output. If someone invents a better way to produce a good, the 
result is more output from the same amounts of capital and labor. Thus, techno­
logical change alters the production function.
Many production functions have a property called constant returns to 
scale. A production function has constant returns to scale if an increase of an 
equal percentage in all factors of production causes an increase in output of 
the same percentage. If the production function has constant returns to scale, 
then we get 10 percent more output when we increase both capital and labor 
by 10 percent. Mathematically, a production function has constant returns to 
scale if
zY 5 F (zK, zL)
for any positive number z. This equation says that if we multiply both the amount 
of capital and the amount of labor by some number z, output is also multiplied 
by z. In the next section we see that the assumption of constant returns to scale 
has an important implication for how the income from ­production is distributed.
As an example of a production function, consider production at a bakery. The 
kitchen and its equipment are the bakery’s capital, the workers hired to make the 
bread are its labor, and the loaves of bread are its output. The bakery’s production 
function shows that the number of loaves produced depends on the amount of 
equipment and the number of workers. If the production function has constant 
returns to scale, then doubling the amount of equipment and the number of 
workers doubles the amount of bread produced.
The Supply of Goods and Services
We can now see that the factors of production and the production function 
together determine the quantity of goods and services supplied, which in turn 
equals the economy’s output. To express this mathematically, we write
Y 5 F (K–, L–)
	
5 Y–.
In this chapter, because we assume that the supplies of capital and labor and 
the technology are fixed, output is also fixed (at a level denoted here as –Y ). 

C H A P T E R  3   National Income: Where It Comes From and Where It Goes  | 51
When we discuss economic growth in Chapters 8 and 9, we will examine how 
increases in capital and labor and advances in technology lead to growth in the 
economy’s output.
 3-2     How Is National Income Distributed to 
the Factors of Production?
As we discussed in Chapter 2, the total output of an economy equals its total 
income. Because the factors of production and the production function together 
determine the total output of goods and services, they also determine national 
income. The circular flow diagram in Figure 3-1 shows that this national 
income flows from firms to households through the markets for the factors of 
­production.
In this section we continue to develop our model of the economy by discuss­
ing how these factor markets work. Economists have long studied factor markets 
to understand the distribution of income. For example, Karl Marx, the noted 
nineteenth-century economist, spent much time trying to explain the incomes 
of capital and labor. The political philosophy of communism was in part based 
on Marx’s now-discredited theory.
Here we examine the modern theory of how national income is divided 
among the factors of production. It is based on the classical (eighteenth-
century) idea that prices adjust to balance supply and demand, applied here 
to the markets for the factors of production, together with the more recent 
(nineteenth-­century) idea that the demand for each factor of production 
depends on the marginal productivity of that factor. This theory, called the 
neoclassical theory of distribution, is accepted by most economists today as the best 
place to start in understanding how the economy’s income is distributed from 
firms to households.
Factor Prices
The distribution of national income is determined by factor prices. Factor 
prices are the amounts paid to each unit of the factors of production. In an 
economy where the two factors of production are capital and labor, the two 
factor prices are the wage workers earn and the rent the owners of capital 
collect.
As Figure 3-2 illustrates, the price each factor of production receives for its 
services is in turn determined by the supply and demand for that factor. Because 
we have assumed that the economy’s factors of production are fixed, the factor 
supply curve in Figure 3-2 is vertical. Regardless of the factor price, the quantity 
of the factor supplied to the market is the same. The intersection of the down­
ward-sloping factor demand curve and the vertical supply curve determines the 
equilibrium factor price.

52 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
To understand factor prices and the distribution of income, we must examine 
the demand for the factors of production. Because factor demand arises from the 
thousands of firms that use capital and labor, we start by examining the decisions 
a typical firm makes about how much of these factors to employ.
The Decisions Facing a Competitive Firm
The simplest assumption to make about a typical firm is that it is competitive. 
A competitive firm is small relative to the markets in which it trades, so it has 
little influence on market prices. For example, our firm produces a good and sells 
it at the market price. Because many firms produce this good, our firm can sell 
as much as it wants without causing the price of the good to fall or it can stop 
selling altogether without causing the price of the good to rise. Similarly, our 
firm cannot influence the wages of the workers it employs because many other 
local firms also employ workers. The firm has no reason to pay more than the 
market wage, and if it tried to pay less, its workers would take jobs elsewhere. 
Therefore, the competitive firm takes the prices of its output and its inputs as 
given by market conditions.
To make its product, the firm needs two factors of production, capital and 
labor. As we did for the aggregate economy, we represent the firm’s production 
technology with the production function
Y 5 F (K, L),
where Y is the number of units produced (the firm’s output), K the number of 
machines used (the amount of capital), and L the number of hours worked by 
the firm’s employees (the amount of labor). Holding constant the technology as 
expressed in the production function, the firm produces more output only if it 
uses more machines or if its employees work more hours.

How a Factor of Production 
Is Compensated  The price 
paid to any factor of produc­
tion depends on the supply 
and demand for that factor’s 
services. Because we have 
assumed that supply is fixed, 
the supply curve is vertical. The 
demand curve is ­downward 
sloping. The intersection of 
supply and demand determines 
the equilibrium factor price.

C H A P T E R  3   National Income: Where It Comes From and Where It Goes  | 53
The firm sells its output at a price P, hires workers at a wage W, and rents 
capital at a rate R. Notice that when we speak of firms renting capital, we are 
assuming that households own the economy’s stock of capital. In this analysis, 
households rent out their capital, just as they sell their labor. The firm obtains 
both factors of production from the households that own them.1
The goal of the firm is to maximize profit. Profit equals revenue minus 
costs; it is what the owners of the firm keep after paying for the costs of pro­
duction. Revenue equals P 3 Y, the selling price of the good P multiplied by 
the amount of the good the firm produces Y. Costs include labor and capital 
costs. Labor costs equal W 3 L, the wage W times the amount of labor L. 
Capital costs equal R 3 K, the rental price of capital R times the amount of 
capital K. We can write
Profit 5 Revenue 2 Labor Costs 2 Capital Costs
	
5	
PY	
2

RK.
To see how profit depends on the factors of production, we use the production 
function Y 5 F (K, L) to substitute for Y to obtain
Profit 5 PF (K, L) 2 WL 2 RK.
This equation shows that profit depends on the product price P, the factor prices 
W and R, and the factor quantities L and K. The competitive firm takes the 
product price and the factor prices as given and chooses the amounts of labor 
and capital that maximize profit.
The Firm’s Demand for Factors
We now know that our firm will hire labor and rent capital in the quantities that 
maximize profit. But what are those profit-maximizing quantities? To answer 
this question, we first consider the quantity of labor and then the quantity 
of capital.
The Marginal Product of Labor The more labor the firm employs, the 
more output it produces. The marginal product of labor (MPL) is the extra 
amount of output the firm gets from one extra unit of labor, holding the amount 
of capital fixed. We can express this using the production function:
MPL 5 F (K, L 1 1) 2 F (K, L).
The first term on the right-hand side is the amount of output produced with 
K units of capital and L 1 1 units of labor; the second term is the amount of 
output produced with K units of capital and L units of labor. This equation 
1This is a simplification. In the real world, the ownership of capital is indirect because firms own 
capital and households own the firms. That is, real firms have two functions: owning capital and 
producing output. To help us understand how the factors of production are compensated, however, 
we assume that firms only produce output and that households own capital directly.

54 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
states that the marginal product of labor is the difference between the amount 
of output produced with L 1 1 units of labor and the amount produced with 
only L units of labor.
Most production functions have the property of diminishing marginal 
product: holding the amount of capital fixed, the marginal product of labor 
decreases as the amount of labor increases. To see why, consider again the produc­
tion of bread at a bakery. As a bakery hires more labor, it produces more bread. 
The MPL is the amount of extra bread produced when an extra unit of labor is 
hired. As more labor is added to a fixed amount of capital, however, the MPL falls. 
Fewer additional loaves are produced because workers are less productive when 
the kitchen is more crowded. In other words, holding the size of the kitchen 
fixed, each additional worker adds fewer loaves of bread to the bakery’s output.
Figure 3-3 graphs the production function. It illustrates what happens to the 
amount of output when we hold the amount of capital constant and vary the 
amount of labor. This figure shows that the marginal product of labor is the slope 
of the production function. As the amount of labor increases, the production 
function becomes flatter, indicating diminishing marginal product.
From the Marginal Product of Labor to Labor Demand When the 
competitive, profit-maximizing firm is deciding whether to hire an additional 
unit of labor, it considers how that decision would affect profits. It therefore 
compares the extra revenue from increased production with the extra cost from 
FIGURE  3-3
The Production Function  This curve shows how output 
depends on labor input, holding the amount of capital con­
stant. The marginal product of labor MPL is the change in 
output when the labor input is increased by 1 unit. As the 
amount of labor increases, the production function becomes 
flatter, indicating diminishing marginal product.

hiring the additional labor. The increase in revenue from an additional unit of 
labor depends on two variables: the marginal product of labor and the price of 
the output. Because an extra unit of labor produces MPL units of output and 
each unit of output sells for P dollars, the extra revenue is P 3 MPL. The extra 
cost of hiring one more unit of labor is the wage W. Thus, the change in profit 
from hiring an additional unit of labor is
DProfit 5 DRevenue 2 DCost
	
5 (P 3 MPL) 2 W.
The symbol D (called delta) denotes the change in a variable.
We can now answer the question we asked at the beginning of this section: 
how much labor does the firm hire? The firm’s manager knows that if the extra 
revenue P 3 MPL exceeds the wage W, an extra unit of labor increases profit. 
Therefore, the manager continues to hire labor until the next unit would no lon­
ger be profitable—that is, until the MPL falls to the point where the extra rev­
enue equals the wage. The competitive firm’s demand for labor is determined by
P 3 MPL 5 W.
We can also write this as
MPL 5 W/P.
W/P is the real wage—the payment to labor measured in units of output rather 
than in dollars. To maximize profit, the firm hires up to the point at which the 
marginal product of labor equals the real wage.
For example, again consider a bakery. Suppose the price of bread P is 
$2 per loaf, and a worker earns a wage W of $20 per hour. The real wage W/P is 
10 loaves per hour. In this example, the firm keeps hiring workers as long as the 
additional worker would produce at least 10 loaves per hour. When the MPL falls 
to 10 loaves per hour or less, hiring additional workers is no longer profitable.
Figure 3-4 shows how the marginal product of labor depends on the amount 
of labor employed (holding the firm’s capital stock constant). That is, this figure 
graphs the MPL schedule. Because the MPL diminishes as the amount of labor 
increases, this curve slopes downward. For any given real wage, the firm hires up 
to the point at which the MPL equals the real wage. Hence, the MPL schedule 
is also the firm’s labor demand curve.
The Marginal Product of Capital and Capital Demand The firm 
decides how much capital to rent in the same way it decides how much labor to 
hire. The marginal product of capital (MPK ) is the amount of extra output 
the firm gets from an extra unit of capital, holding the amount of labor constant:
MPK 5 F (K 1 1, L) 2 F (K, L).
Thus, the marginal product of capital is the difference between the amount of output 
produced with K 1 1 units of capital and that produced with only K units of capital.
Like labor, capital is subject to diminishing marginal product. Once again con­
sider the production of bread at a bakery. The first several ovens installed in the 

56 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
kitchen will be very productive. However, if the bakery installs more and more 
ovens, while holding its labor force constant, it will eventually contain more 
ovens than its employees can effectively operate. Hence, the marginal product of 
the last few ovens is lower than that of the first few.
The increase in profit from renting an additional machine is the extra revenue 
from selling the output of that machine minus the machine’s rental price:
DProfit 5 DRevenue 2 DCost
	
5 (P 3 MPK ) 2 R.
To maximize profit, the firm continues to rent more capital until the MPK falls 
to equal the real rental price:
MPK 5 R/P.
The real rental price of capital is the rental price measured in units of goods 
rather than in dollars.
To sum up, the competitive, profit-maximizing firm follows a simple rule 
about how much labor to hire and how much capital to rent. The firm demands 
each factor of production until that factor’s marginal product falls to equal its real factor price.
The Division of National Income
Having analyzed how a firm decides how much of each factor to employ, we 
can now explain how the markets for the factors of production distribute the 
economy’s total income. If all firms in the economy are competitive and profit 
maximizing, then each factor of production is paid its marginal contribution to 
the production process. The real wage paid to each worker equals the MPL, and 
FIGURE  3-4

the real rental price paid to each owner of capital equals the MPK. The total real 
wages paid to labor are therefore MPL 3 L, and the total real return paid to 
capital owners is MPK 3 K.
The income that remains after the firms have paid the factors of production 
is the economic profit of the owners of the firms:
Economic Profit 5 Y 2 (MPL 3 L) 2 (MPK 3 K ).
Note that income Y and economic profit are here being expressed in real 
terms—that is, in units of output rather than in dollars. Because we want to 
examine the distribution of income, we rearrange the terms as follows:
Y 5 (MPL 3 L) 1 (MPK 3 K ) 1 Economic Profit.
Total income is divided among the return to labor, the return to capital, and 
economic profit.
How large is economic profit? The answer is surprising: if the production function 
has the property of constant returns to scale, as is often thought to be the case, then 
economic profit must be zero. That is, nothing is left after the factors of production 
are paid. This conclusion follows from a famous mathematical result called Euler’s 
theorem,2 which states that if the production function has constant returns to scale, then
F (K, L) 5 (MPK 3 K) 1 (MPL 3 L).
If each factor of production is paid its marginal product, then the sum of these 
factor payments equals total output. In other words, constant returns to scale, 
profit maximization, and competition together imply that economic profit is zero.
If economic profit is zero, how can we explain the existence of “profit” in the 
economy? The answer is that the term “profit” as normally used is different from 
economic profit. We have been assuming that there are three types of agents: work­
ers, owners of capital, and owners of firms. Total income is divided among wages, 
return to capital, and economic profit. In the real world, however, most firms own 
rather than rent the capital they use. Because firm owners and capital owners 
are the same people, economic profit and the return to capital are often lumped 
together. If we call this alternative definition accounting profit, we can say that
Accounting Profit 5 Economic Profit 1 (MPK 3 K ).
Under our assumptions—constant returns to scale, profit maximization, and 
competition—economic profit is zero. If these assumptions approximately 
describe the world, then the “profit” in the national income accounts must be 
mostly the return to capital.
2Mathematical note:  To prove Euler’s theorem, we need to use some multivariate calculus. Begin with the 
definition of constant returns to scale: zY 5 F (zK, zL). Now differentiate with respect to z to obtain:
Y 5 F1(zK, zL) K 1 F2(zK, zL) L,
where F1 and F2 denote partial derivatives with respect to the first and second arguments of the 
function. Evaluating this expression at z 5 1, and noting that the partial derivatives equal the 
marginal products, yields Euler’s theorem.

58 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
We can now answer the question posed at the beginning of this chapter about 
how the income of the economy is distributed from firms to households. Each 
factor of production is paid its marginal product, and these factor payments 
exhaust total output. Total output is divided between the payments to capital and the 
payments to labor, depending on their marginal productivities.
The Cobb–Douglas Production Function
What production function describes how actual economies turn capital and 
labor into GDP? One answer to this question came from a historic collaboration 
between a U.S. senator and a mathematician.
Paul Douglas was a U.S. senator from Illinois from 1949 to 1967. In 1927, 
however, when he was still a professor of economics, he noticed a surprising 
fact: the division of national income between capital and labor had been roughly 
­constant over a long period. In other words, as the economy grew more prosper­
ous over time, the total income of workers and the total income of capital owners 
grew at almost exactly the same rate. This observation caused Douglas to wonder 
what conditions might lead to constant factor shares.

(New York: Norton, 1980), 200–202.
The Black Death and Factor Prices
According to the neoclassical theory of distribution, factor prices equal the 
marginal products of the factors of production. Because the marginal products 
depend on the quantities of the factors, a change in the quantity of any one 
factor alters the marginal products of all the factors. Therefore, a change in the 
supply of a factor alters equilibrium factor prices and the distribution of income.
Fourteenth-century Europe provides a grisly natural experiment to study how 
factor quantities affect factor prices. The outbreak of the bubonic plague—the 
Black Death—in 1348 reduced the population of Europe by about one-third with­
in a few years. Because the marginal product of labor increases as the amount of 
labor falls, this massive reduction in the labor force should have raised the marginal 
product of labor and equilibrium real wages. (That is, the economy should have 
moved to the left along the curves in Figures 3-3 and 3-4.) The evidence confirms 
the theory: real wages approximately doubled during the plague years. The peasants 
who were fortunate enough to survive the plague enjoyed economic prosperity.
The reduction in the labor force caused by the plague should also have affected 
the return to land, the other major factor of production in medieval Europe. With 
fewer workers available to farm the land, an additional unit of land would have 
produced less additional output, and so land rents should have fallen. Once again, 
the theory is confirmed: real rents fell 50 percent or more during this period. While 
the peasant classes prospered, the landed classes suffered reduced incomes.3 n
CASE STUDY

C H A P T E R  3   National Income: Where It Comes From and Where It Goes  | 59
Douglas asked Charles Cobb, a mathematician, what production function, if 
any, would produce constant factor shares if factors always earned their marginal 
products. The production function would need to have the property that
Capital Income 5 MPK 3 K 5 aY
and
Labor Income 5 MPL 3 L 5 (1 2 a) Y,
where a is a constant between zero and one that measures capital’s share of 
income. That is, a determines what share of income goes to capital and what 
share goes to labor. Cobb showed that the function with this property is
F (K,L) 5 A KaL12a,
where A is a parameter greater than zero that measures the productivity of 
the available technology. This function became known as the Cobb–Douglas 
­production function.
Let’s take a closer look at some of the properties of this production function. 
First, the Cobb–Douglas production function has constant returns to scale. That 
is, if capital and labor are increased by the same proportion, then output increases 
by that proportion as well.4
Next, consider the marginal products for the Cobb–Douglas production 
­function. The marginal product of labor is5
MPL 5 (1 2 ) A KaL2a,
4Mathematical note: To prove that the Cobb–Douglas production function has constant returns to 
scale, examine what happens when we multiply capital and labor by a constant z:
F (zK, zL) 5 A(zK)a(zL)12a.
Expanding terms on the right,
F (zK, zL) 5 Aza K az12aL12a.
Rearranging to bring like terms together, we get
F (zK, zL) 5 Aza z12a K aL12a.
Since za z12a 5 z, our function becomes
F (zK, zL) 5 z A K aL12a.
But A K aL12a 5 F(K,L). Thus,
F (zK, zL) 5 zF(K,L) 5 zY.
Hence, the amount of output Y increases by the same factor z, which implies that this production 
function has constant returns to scale.
5Mathematical note: Obtaining the formulas for the marginal products from the production function 
requires a bit of calculus. To find the MPL, differentiate the production function with respect to L. 
This is done by multiplying by the exponent (1 2 a) and then subtracting 1 from the old expo­
nent to obtain the new exponent, 2a. Similarly, to obtain the MPK, differentiate the production 
function with respect to K.

60 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
and the marginal product of capital is
MPK 5  A K21L12a.
From these equations, recalling that a is between zero and one, we can see what 
causes the marginal products of the two factors to change. An increase in the 
amount of capital raises the MPL and reduces the MPK. Similarly, an increase 
in the amount of labor reduces the MPL and raises the MPK. A technological 
advance that increases the parameter A raises the marginal product of both fac­
tors proportionately.
The marginal products for the Cobb–Douglas production function can also 
be written as6
MPL 5 (1 2 )Y/L.
	
MPK 5 Y/K.
The MPL is proportional to output per worker, and the MPK is proportional to 
output per unit of capital. Y/L is called average labor productivity, and Y/K is called 
average capital productivity. If the production function is Cobb–Douglas, then the 
marginal productivity of a factor is proportional to its average productivity.
We can now verify that if factors earn their marginal products, then the 
parameter a indeed tells us how much income goes to labor and how much 
goes to capital. The total amount paid to labor, which we have seen is MPL 3 L, 
equals (1 2 a)Y. Therefore, (1 2 a) is labor’s share of output. Similarly, the total 
amount paid to capital, MPK 3 K, equals aY, and a is capital’s share of output. 
The ratio of labor income to capital income is a constant, (1 2 a)/a, just as 
Douglas observed. The factor shares depend only on the parameter a, not on 
the amounts of capital or labor or on the state of technology as measured by the 
parameter A.
More recent U.S. data are also consistent with the Cobb–Douglas produc­
tion function. Figure 3-5 shows the ratio of labor income to total income in the 
United States from 1960 to 2013. Despite the many changes in the economy 
over the past five decades, this ratio has remained about 2/3. This division of 
income is easily explained by a Cobb–Douglas production function in which the 
parameter a is about 1/3. According to this parameter, capital receives a third of 
income, and labor receives two-thirds.
Although the capital and labor shares are approximately constant, they are not 
exactly constant. In particular, Figure 3-5 shows that the labor share fell from a 
high of 72 percent in 1970 to 63 percent in 2013. The flip side, of course, is that 
the capital share increased during this period from 28 percent to 37 percent. The 
reason for this change in factor shares is not well understood. One possibility is 
that technological progress over the past several decades has not simply increased

tion function for Y to show that these expressions are equivalent to the earlier formulas for the 
marginal products.

the parameter A but may have also changed the relative importance of capital 
and labor in the production process, thereby altering the parameter a as well. 
But it is also possible that there are important determinants of incomes that are 
not well captured by the Cobb–Douglas production function together with the 
competitive model of factor markets.7
The Cobb–Douglas production function is not the last word in explain­
ing the economy’s production of goods and services or the distribution 
of national income between capital and labor. It is, however, a good place 
to start.

The Ratio of Labor Income to Total Income  Labor income has 
remained about two-thirds of total income over a long period of time. 
This approximate constancy of factor shares is consistent with the 
Cobb–Douglas production function.
Data from: U.S. Department of Commerce. This figure is produced from U.S. national 
income accounts data. Labor income is compensation of employees. Total income 
is the sum of labor income, corporate profits, net interest, rental income, and 
depreciation. Proprietors’ income is excluded from these calculations, because it is a 
combination of labor income and capital income.

CASE STUDY
Labor Productivity as the Key Determinant of
Real Wages
The neoclassical theory of distribution tells us that the real wage W/P equals the 
marginal product of labor. The Cobb–Douglas production function tells us that 
the marginal product of labor is proportional to average labor productivity Y/L. 
If this theory is right, then workers should enjoy rapidly rising living standards 
when labor productivity is growing robustly. Is this true?
Table 3-1 presents some data on growth in productivity and real wages for 
the U.S. economy. From 1960 to 2013, productivity as measured by output per 
hour of work grew about 2.1 percent per year. Real wages grew at 1.8 percent—
almost the same rate. With a growth rate of 2 percent per year, productivity and 
real wages double about every 35 years.
Productivity growth varies over time. The table shows the data for three 
shorter periods that economists have identified as having different productivity 
experiences. (A case study in Chapter 9 examines the reasons for these changes 
in productivity growth.) Around 1973, the U.S. economy experienced a signifi­
cant slowdown in productivity growth that lasted until 1995. The cause of the 
productivity slowdown is not well understood, but the link between productivity 
and real wages was exactly as standard theory predicts. The slowdown in produc­
tivity growth from 2.9 to 1.5 percent per year coincided with a slowdown in real 
wage growth from 2.7 to 1.2 percent per year.
Productivity growth picked up again around 1995, and many observers hailed 
the arrival of the “new economy.” This productivity acceleration is often attrib­
uted to the spread of computers and information technology. As theory predicts, 
growth in real wages picked up as well. From 1995 to 2010, productivity grew 
by 2.3 percent per year and real wages by 2.0 percent per year.

The Growing Gap Between Rich and Poor
One striking development about the U.S. economy, as well as many other 
economies around the world, is an increase in income inequality over the past 
several decades. Figure 3-6 illustrates this phenomenon by showing the Gini 
coefficient for family incomes from 1947 to 2012. The Gini coefficient is a 
measure of income dispersion: it is between zero and one, with zero representing 
perfect equality (all families have the same income) and one representing perfect 
inequality (all income goes to one family).8 The figure shows that the Gini coef­
ficient fell from 0.38 in 1947 to a low of 0.35 in 1968, a period when incomes 
were becoming slightly more equal. But the economy then entered a period of 
rising inequality. The Gini coefficient rose to 0.45 in 2012.
Theory and history both confirm the close link between labor productivity 
and real wages. This lesson is the key to understanding why workers today are 
better off than workers in previous generations. n
8Mathematical note: The Gini coefficient can be interpreted as follows. If you randomly select two 
incomes from the population, the absolute value of their difference, as a share of the population’s 
average income, is expected to be twice the Gini coefficient.

What explains increasing inequality in family incomes? Part of the story is 
the change in factor shares discussed earlier. Because capital income tends to be 
more concentrated in higher-income households than is labor income, a fall in 
the labor share and rise in the capital share tends to increase inequality. But the 
change in factor shares is only a small piece of the puzzle. More important, if we 
look within labor income, we find that the gap between the earnings of high-
wage workers and the earnings of low-wage workers has grown substantially 
since the 1970s.
Economists have spent much research effort trying to explain increasing 
inequality of labor earnings. As yet no definitive conclusion has emerged, but 
a prominent diagnosis comes from economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence 
Katz in their book The Race Between Education and Technology.9 Their bottom 
line is that “the sharp rise in inequality was largely due to an educational 
slowdown.”
According to Goldin and Katz, for the past century technological progress 
has been a steady economic force, not only increasing average living standards 
but also increasing the demand for skilled workers relative to unskilled workers. 
Skilled workers are needed to apply and manage new technologies, while less 
skilled workers are more likely to become obsolete. By itself, this skill-biased 
technological change tends to raise the wages of skilled workers relative to the 
wages of unskilled workers, thereby increasing inequality.
For much of the twentieth century, however, skill-biased technological change 
was outpaced by advances in educational attainment. In other words, while tech­
nological progress increased the demand for skilled workers, our educational sys­
tem increased the supply of skilled workers even faster. As a result, skilled workers 
did not benefit disproportionately from economic growth. Indeed, until the 
1970s, wages for the skilled workers grew more slowly than wages for unskilled 
workers, reducing inequality.
Recently things have changed. Over the last several decades, technological 
progress kept up its pace, but educational advancement slowed down. Numbers 
from Goldin and Katz show the magnitude of what happened. The cohort of 
workers born in 1950 averaged 4.67 more years of schooling than the cohort 
born in 1900, representing an increase of 0.93 years of schooling in each decade. 
By contrast, the cohort born in 1975 had only 0.74 more years of schooling than 
that born in 1950, an increase of only 0.30 years per decade. That is, the pace of 
educational advancement fell by 68 percent.
Because growth in the supply of skilled workers has slowed, their wages have 
grown relative to those of the unskilled. This phenomenon is evident in Goldin 
and Katz’s estimates of the financial return to education. In 1980, each year 
of college raised a person’s wage by 7.6 percent. In 2005, each year of college 
yielded an additional 12.9 percent. Over this time period, the rate of return 
from each year of graduate school rose even more—from 7.3 to 14.2 percent.

(Implication for personal decisionmaking: for most people, college and graduate 
school are investments well worth making.)
Increasing income inequality has become a prominent topic in the debate 
over public policy. In response to these economic developments, some policy­
makers advocate a more redistributive system of taxes and transfers, to take from 
those higher on the economic ladder and give to those on the lower rungs. Such 
an approach treats the symptoms but not the underlying causes of rising inequal­
ity. If the conclusions of Goldin and Katz are correct, reversing the rise in income 
inequality will likely require putting more of society’s resources into education 
(which economists call human capital). Educational reform is a topic beyond the 
scope of this book, but it is worth noting that, if successful, such reform could 
have profound effects on the economy and the distribution of income.
 3-3   What Determines the Demand for 
Goods and Services?
We have seen what determines the level of production and how the income from 
production is distributed to workers and owners of capital. We now continue our 
tour of the circular flow diagram, Figure 3-1, and examine how the output from 
production is used.
In Chapter 2 we identified the four components of GDP:
n	 Consumption (C )
n	 Investment (I )
n	 Government purchases (G )
n Net exports (NX ).
The circular flow diagram contains only the first three components. For now, 
to simplify the analysis, we assume our economy is a closed economy—a coun­
try that does not trade with other countries. Thus, net exports are always zero. 
(We examine the macroeconomics of open economies in Chapter 6.)
A closed economy has three uses for the goods and services it produces. These 
three components of GDP are expressed in the national income accounts identity:
Y 5 C 1 I 1 G.
Households consume some of the economy’s output, firms and households use 
some of the output for investment, and the government buys some of the output 
for public purposes. We want to see how GDP is allocated among these three uses.
Consumption
When we eat food, wear clothing, or go to a movie, we are consuming some of 
the output of the economy. All forms of consumption together make up about 
two-thirds of GDP. Because consumption is so large, macroeconomists have 
devoted much energy to studying how households make their consumption 

66 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
decisions. Chapter 16 examines this topic in detail. Here we consider the simplest 
story of consumer behavior.
Households receive income from their labor and their ownership of capital, 
pay taxes to the government, and then decide how much of their after-tax income 
to consume and how much to save. As we discussed in Section 3-2, the income 
that households receive equals the output of the economy Y. The government 
then taxes households an amount T. (Although the government imposes many 
kinds of taxes, such as personal and corporate income taxes and sales taxes, for 
our purposes we can lump all these taxes together.) We define income after the 
payment of all taxes, Y 2 T, to be disposable income. Households divide their 
disposable income between consumption and saving.
We assume that the level of consumption depends directly on the level of dispos­
able income. A higher level of disposable income leads to greater ­consumption. Thus,
C 5 C (Y 2 T ).
This equation states that consumption is a function of disposable income. 
The relationship between consumption and disposable income is called the 
­consumption function.
The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the amount by which 
consumption changes when disposable income increases by one dollar. The MPC 
is between zero and one: an extra dollar of income increases consumption, but 
by less than one dollar. Thus, if households obtain an extra dollar of income, 
they save a portion of it. For example, if the MPC is 0.7, then households spend 
70 cents of each additional dollar of disposable income on consumer goods and 
services and save 30 cents.
Figure 3-7 illustrates the consumption function. The slope of the consump­
tion function tells us how much consumption increases when disposable income 
increases by one dollar. That is, the slope of the consumption function is the MPC.

Investment
Both firms and households purchase investment goods. Firms buy investment 
goods to add to their stock of capital and to replace existing capital as it wears 
out. Households buy new houses, which are also part of investment. Total invest­
ment in the United States averages about 15 percent of GDP.
The quantity of investment goods demanded depends on the interest rate, 
which measures the cost of the funds used to finance investment. For an invest­
ment project to be profitable, its return (the revenue from increased future pro­
duction of goods and services) must exceed its cost (the payments for borrowed 
funds). If the interest rate rises, fewer investment projects are profitable, and the 
quantity of investment goods demanded falls.
For example, suppose a firm is considering whether it should build a 
$1 million factory that would yield a return of $100,000 per year, or 10 per­
cent. The firm compares this return to the cost of borrowing the $1 mil­
lion. If the interest rate is below 10 percent, the firm borrows the money 
in financial markets and makes the investment. If the interest rate is above 
10 percent, the firm forgoes the investment opportunity and does not build 
the factory.
The firm makes the same investment decision even if it does not have to 
borrow the $1 million but rather uses its own funds. The firm can always deposit 
this money in a bank or a money market fund and earn interest on it. Building 
the factory is more profitable than depositing the money if and only if the inter­
est rate is less than the 10 percent return on the factory.
A person wanting to buy a new house faces a similar decision. The higher the 
interest rate, the greater the cost of carrying a mortgage. A $100,000 mortgage 
costs $6,000 per year if the interest rate is 6 percent and $8,000 per year if the 
interest rate is 8 percent. As the interest rate rises, the cost of owning a home 
rises, and the demand for new homes falls.
When studying the role of interest rates in the economy, economists dis­
tinguish between the nominal interest rate and the real interest rate. This dis­
tinction is relevant when the overall level of prices is changing. The nominal 
interest rate is the interest rate as usually reported: it is the rate of interest 
that investors pay to borrow money. The real interest rate is the nominal 
interest rate corrected for the effects of inflation. If the nominal interest rate 
is 8 percent and the inflation rate is 3 percent, then the real interest rate is 
5 percent. In Chapter 5 we discuss the relation between nominal and real 
interest rates in detail. Here it is sufficient to note that the real interest rate 
measures the true cost of borrowing and, thus, determines the quantity of 
investment.
We can summarize this discussion with an equation relating investment I to 
the real interest rate r:
I 5 I (r).
Figure 3-8 shows this investment function. It slopes downward, because as the 
interest rate rises, the quantity of investment demanded falls.

If you look in the business section of a newspaper 
or on a financial Web site, you will find many 
different interest rates reported. By contrast, 
throughout this book, we will talk about “the” 
interest rate, as if there were only one interest 
rate in the economy. The only distinction we will 
make is between the nominal interest rate (which 
is not corrected for inflation) and the real interest 
rate (which is corrected for inflation). Almost all 
of the interest rates reported by financial news 
organizations are nominal.
Why are there so many interest rates? The 
various interest rates differ in three ways:
n	 Term. Some loans in the economy are for 
short periods of time, even as short as over­
night. Other loans are for thirty years or even 
longer. The interest rate on a loan depends 
on its term. Long-term interest rates are usu­
ally, but not always, higher than short-term 
interest rates.
n	 Credit risk. In deciding whether to make a 
loan, a lender must take into account the 
probability that the borrower will repay. The 
law allows borrowers to default on their 
loans by declaring bankruptcy. The higher the 
The Many Different Interest Rates
perceived probability of default, the higher 
the interest rate. Because the government 
has the lowest credit risk, government bonds 
tend to pay a low interest rate. At the other 
extreme, financially shaky corporations can 
raise funds only by issuing junk bonds, which 
pay a high interest rate to compensate for 
the high risk of default.
n	 Tax treatment. The interest on different types 
of bonds is taxed differently. Most important, 
when state and local governments issue bonds, 
called municipal bonds, the holders of the bonds 
do not pay federal income tax on the interest 
income. Because of this tax advantage, munici­
pal bonds pay a lower interest rate.
When you see two different interest rates report­
ed, you can almost always explain the difference 
by considering the term, the credit risk, and the 
tax treatment of the loan.
Although there are many different interest 
rates in the economy, macroeconomists often 
ignore these distinctions because the ­various 
interest rates tend to move up and down ­together. 
For many purposes, we will not go far wrong by 
assuming there is only one interest rate.

Government Purchases
Government purchases are the third component of the demand for goods and 
services. The federal government buys guns, missiles, and the services of gov­
ernment employees. Local governments buy library books, build schools, and 
hire teachers. Governments at all levels build roads and other public works. All 
these transactions make up government purchases of goods and services, which 
account for about 20 percent of GDP in the United States.
These purchases are only one type of government spending. The other type 
is transfer payments to households, such as public assistance for the poor and 
Social Security payments for the elderly. Unlike government purchases, transfer 
payments are not made in exchange for some of the economy’s output of goods 
and services. Therefore, they are not included in the variable G.
Transfer payments do affect the demand for goods and services indirectly. Transfer 
payments are the opposite of taxes: they increase households’ disposable income, just as 
taxes reduce disposable income. Thus, an increase in transfer payments financed by an 
increase in taxes leaves disposable income unchanged. We can now revise our defini­
tion of T to equal taxes minus transfer payments. Disposable income, Y 2 T, includes 
both the negative impact of taxes and the positive impact of transfer ­payments.
If government purchases equal taxes minus transfers, then G 5 T and the 
government has a balanced budget. If G exceeds T, the government runs a budget 
deficit, which it funds by issuing government debt—that is, by borrowing in the 
financial markets. If G is less than T, the government runs a budget surplus, which 
it can use to repay some of its outstanding debt.
Here we do not try to explain the political process that leads to a particular 
fiscal policy—that is, to the level of government purchases and taxes. Instead, we 
take government purchases and taxes as exogenous variables. To denote that these 
variables are fixed outside of our model of national income, we write
G 5 G–.
T 5 –T.
We do, however, want to examine the impact of fiscal policy on the endogenous 
variables, which are determined within the model. The endogenous variables 
here are consumption, investment, and the interest rate.
To see how the exogenous variables affect the endogenous variables, we must 
complete the model. This is the subject of the next section.
  3-4   What Brings the Supply and 
Demand for Goods and Services into 
Equilibrium?
We have now come full circle in the circular flow diagram, Figure 3-1. We began 
by examining the supply of goods and services, and we have just discussed the 
demand for them. How can we be certain that all these flows balance? In other 

70 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
words, what ensures that the sum of consumption, investment, and govern­
ment purchases equals the amount of output produced? In this classical model, 
the interest rate is the price that has the crucial role of equilibrating supply 
and demand.
There are two ways to think about the role of the interest rate in the economy. 
We can consider how the interest rate affects the supply and demand for goods 
or services. Or we can consider how the interest rate affects the supply and 
demand for loanable funds. As we will see, these two approaches are two sides 
of the same coin.
Equilibrium in the Market for Goods and Services: 
The Supply and Demand for the Economy’s Output
The following equations summarize the discussion of the demand for goods and 
services in Section 3-3:
Y 5 C 1 I 1 G.
	
C 5 C (Y 2 T ).
	
I 5 I (r).
	
G 5  –G.
	
T 5  –T.
The demand for the economy’s output comes from consumption, investment, 
and government purchases. Consumption depends on disposable income, invest­
ment depends on the real interest rate, and government purchases and taxes are 
the exogenous variables set by fiscal policymakers.
To this analysis, let’s add what we learned about the supply of goods and 
services in Section 3-1. There we saw that the factors of production and the 
production function determine the quantity of output supplied to the economy:
Y 5 F ( –K, –L)
	
5 Y–.
Now let’s combine these equations describing the supply and demand for output. 
If we substitute the consumption function and the investment function into the 
national income accounts identity, we obtain
Y 5 C (Y 2 T ) 1 I (r) 1 G.
Because the variables G and T are fixed by policy, and the level of output Y is 
fixed by the factors of production and the production function, we can write
Y– 5 C (Y– 2 –T ) 1 I (r) 1  –G.
This equation states that the supply of output equals its demand, which is the 
sum of consumption, investment, and government purchases.

C H A P T E R  3   National Income: Where It Comes From and Where It Goes  | 71
Notice that the interest rate r is the only variable not already determined in 
the last equation. This is because the interest rate still has a key role to play: it 
must adjust to ensure that the demand for goods equals the supply. The higher 
the interest rate, the lower the level of investment, and thus the lower the 
demand for goods and services, C 1 I 1 G. If the interest rate is too high, then 
investment is too low and the demand for output falls short of the supply. If the 
interest rate is too low, then investment is too high and the demand exceeds 
the supply. At the equilibrium interest rate, the demand for goods and services equals 
the supply.
This conclusion may seem somewhat mysterious: how does the interest rate 
get to the level that balances the supply and demand for goods and services? The 
best way to answer this question is to consider how financial markets fit into 
the story.
Equilibrium in the Financial Markets: The Supply and 
Demand for Loanable Funds
Because the interest rate is the cost of borrowing and the return to lending in 
financial markets, we can better understand the role of the interest rate in the 
economy by thinking about the financial markets. To do this, rewrite the national 
income accounts identity as
Y 2 C 2 G 5 I.
The term Y 2 C 2 G is the output that remains after the demands of consumers 
and the government have been satisfied; it is called national saving or simply 
saving (S). In this form, the national income accounts identity shows that saving 
equals investment.
To understand this identity more fully, we can split national saving into two 
parts—one part representing the saving of the private sector and the other rep­
resenting the saving of the government:
S 5 (Y 2 T 2 C ) 1 (T 2 G) 5 I.
The term (Y 2 T 2 C) is disposable income minus consumption, which is 
private saving. The term (T 2 G) is government revenue minus govern­
ment spending, which is public saving. (If government spending exceeds 
government revenue, then the government runs a budget deficit and public 
saving is negative.) National saving is the sum of private and public saving. 
The ­circular flow diagram in Figure 3-1 reveals an interpretation of this 
equation: this equation states that the flows into the financial markets (pri­
vate and ­public saving) must balance the flows out of the financial markets 
(investment).
To see how the interest rate brings financial markets into equilibrium, sub­
stitute the consumption function and the investment function into the national 
income accounts identity:
Y 2 C (Y 2 T ) 2 G 5 I (r).

72 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
Next, note that G and T are fixed by policy and Y is fixed by the factors of 
production and the production function:
Y– 2 C (Y– 2  –T ) 2  –G 5 I (r)
	
 –S 5 I (r).
The left-hand side of this equation shows that national saving depends on 
income Y and the fiscal-policy variables G and T. For fixed values of Y, G, and 
T, national saving S is also fixed. The right-hand side of the equation shows that 
investment depends on the interest rate.
Figure 3-9 graphs saving and investment as a function of the interest rate. The 
saving function is a vertical line because in this model saving does not depend on the 
interest rate (we relax this assumption later). The investment function slopes down­
ward: as the interest rate decreases, more investment projects become profitable.
From a quick glance at Figure 3-9, one might think it was a supply-and-
demand diagram for a particular good. In fact, saving and investment can be 
interpreted in terms of supply and demand. In this case, the “good” is loanable 
funds, and its “price” is the interest rate. Saving is the supply of loanable funds—
households lend their saving to investors or deposit their saving in a bank that 
then loans the funds out. Investment is the demand for loanable funds—investors 
borrow from the public directly by selling bonds or indirectly by borrowing from 
banks. Because investment depends on the interest rate, the quantity of loanable 
funds demanded also depends on the interest rate.
The interest rate adjusts until the amount that firms want to invest equals the 
amount that households want to save. If the interest rate is too low, investors 
want more of the economy’s output than households want to save. Equivalently, 
the quantity of loanable funds demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. When 
this happens, the interest rate rises. Conversely, if the interest rate is too high, 
households want to save more than firms want to invest; because the quantity of

ing and investment into

the supply of loanable 
funds. The downward-

for loanable funds. The 
intersection of these two

loanable funds supplied is greater than the quantity demanded, the interest rate 
falls. The equilibrium interest rate is found where the two curves cross. At the 
equilibrium interest rate, households’ desire to save balances firms’ desire to invest, and the 
quantity of loanable funds supplied equals the quantity demanded.
Changes in Saving: The Effects of Fiscal Policy
We can use our model to show how fiscal policy affects the economy. When the 
government changes its spending or the level of taxes, it affects the demand for 
the economy’s output of goods and services and alters national saving, invest­
ment, and the equilibrium interest rate.
An Increase in Government Purchases  Consider first the effects of an 
increase in government purchases by an amount DG. The immediate impact is 
to increase the demand for goods and services by DG. But because total output is 
fixed by the factors of production, the increase in government purchases must be 
met by a decrease in some other category of demand. Disposable income Y 2 T 
is unchanged, so consumption C is unchanged as well. Therefore, the increase in 
government purchases must be met by an equal decrease in investment.
To induce investment to fall, the interest rate must rise. Hence, the increase 
in government purchases causes the interest rate to increase and investment to 
decrease. Government purchases are said to crowd out investment.
To grasp the effects of an increase in government purchases, consider the impact 
on the market for loanable funds. Because the increase in government purchases is 
not accompanied by an increase in taxes, the government finances the additional 
spending by borrowing—that is, by reducing public saving. With private saving 
unchanged, this government borrowing reduces national saving. As Figure 3-10 
shows, a reduction in national saving is represented by a leftward shift in the supply 
of loanable funds available for investment. At the initial interest rate, the demand

FIGURE  3-10
A Reduction in Saving  
A reduction in saving, 
possibly the result of a 
change in fiscal policy, 
shifts the saving sched­
ule to the left. The new 
equilibrium is the point 
at which the new sav­
ing schedule crosses the 
investment schedule. A 
reduction in saving lowers 
the amount of investment 
and raises the interest 
rate. Fiscal-policy actions 
that reduce saving are said 
to crowd out investment.

74 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
for loanable funds exceeds the supply. The equilibrium interest rate rises to the 
point where the investment schedule crosses the new saving schedule. Thus, an 
increase in government purchases causes the interest rate to rise from r1 to r2.
A Decrease in Taxes  Now consider a reduction in taxes of DT. The immedi­
ate impact of the tax cut is to raise disposable income and thus to raise consump­
tion. Disposable income rises by DT, and consumption rises by an amount equal 
to DT times the marginal propensity to consume MPC. The higher the MPC, 
the greater the impact of the tax cut on consumption.
Because the economy’s output is fixed by the factors of production and the 
level of government purchases is fixed by the government, the increase in con­
sumption must be met by a decrease in investment. For investment to fall, the 
interest rate must rise. Hence, a reduction in taxes, like an increase in government 
purchases, crowds out investment and raises the interest rate.
We can also analyze the effect of a tax cut by looking at saving and invest­
ment. Because the tax cut raises disposable income by DT, consumption goes up 
by MPC 3 DT. National saving S, which equals Y 2 C 2 G, falls by the same 
amount as consumption rises. As in Figure 3-10, the reduction in saving shifts 
the supply of loanable funds to the left, which increases the equilibrium interest 
rate and crowds out investment.
Changes in Investment Demand
So far, we have discussed how fiscal policy can change national saving. We can also 
use our model to examine the other side of the market—the demand for investment. 
In this section we look at the causes and effects of changes in investment demand.
One reason investment demand might increase is technological innovation. 
Suppose, for example, that someone invents a new technology, such as the rail­
road or the computer. Before a firm or household can take advantage of the 
innovation, it must buy investment goods. The invention of the railroad had no 
value until railroad cars were produced and tracks were laid. The idea of the 
computer was not productive until computers were manufactured. Thus, tech­
nological innovation leads to an increase in investment demand.
Investment demand may also change because the government encourages 
or discourages investment through the tax laws. For example, suppose that the 
government increases personal income taxes and uses the extra revenue to pro­
vide tax cuts for those who invest in new capital. Such a change in the tax laws 
makes more investment projects profitable and, like a technological innovation, 
increases the demand for investment goods.
Figure 3-11 shows the effects of an increase in investment demand. At any 
given interest rate, the demand for investment goods (and also for loanable funds) 
is higher. This increase in demand is represented by a shift in the investment 
schedule to the right. The economy moves from the old equilibrium, point A, to 
the new equilibrium, point B.
The surprising implication of Figure 3-11 is that the equilibrium amount of 
investment is unchanged. Under our assumptions, the fixed level of saving ­determines 
the amount of investment; in other words, there is a fixed supply of loanable funds. 
An increase in investment demand merely raises the equilibrium interest rate.

C H A P T E R  3   National Income: Where It Comes From and Where It Goes  | 75
We would reach a different conclusion, however, if we modified our simple 
consumption function and allowed consumption (and its flip side, saving) to 
depend on the interest rate. Because the interest rate is the return to saving (as 
well as the cost of borrowing), a higher interest rate might reduce consumption 
and increase saving. If so, the saving schedule would be upward sloping rather 
than vertical.
With an upward-sloping saving schedule, an increase in investment demand 
would raise both the equilibrium interest rate and the equilibrium quantity of 
investment. Figure 3-12 shows such a change. The increase in the interest rate 
causes households to consume less and save more. The decrease in consumption 
frees resources for investment.

turn allows investment 
to increase.

 3-5   Conclusion
In this chapter we have developed a model that explains the production, distribution, 
and allocation of the economy’s output of goods and services. The model relies on the 
classical assumption that prices adjust to equilibrate supply and demand. In this model, 
factor prices equilibrate factor markets, and the interest rate equilibrates the supply 
and demand for goods and services (or, equivalently, the supply and demand for 
loanable funds). Because the model incorporates all the interactions illustrated in the 
circular flow diagram in Figure 3-1, it is sometimes called a general equilibrium model.
Throughout the chapter, we have discussed various applications of the model. 
The model can explain how income is divided among the factors of production 
and how factor prices depend on factor supplies. We have also used the model 
to discuss how fiscal policy alters the allocation of output among its alternative 
uses—consumption, investment, and government purchases—and how it affects 
the equilibrium interest rate.
At this point it is useful to review some of the simplifying assumptions we 
have made in this chapter. In the following chapters we relax some of these 
assumptions to address a greater range of questions.
n	 We have ignored the role of money, the asset with which goods and ser­
vices are bought and sold. In Chapters 4 and 5 we discuss how money 
affects the economy and the influence of monetary policy.
n	 We have assumed that there is no trade with other countries. In Chapter 6 
we consider how international interactions affect our conclusions.
n	 We have assumed that the labor force is fully employed. In Chapter 7 we 
examine the reasons for unemployment and see how public policy influ­
ences the level of unemployment.
n	 We have assumed that the capital stock, the labor force, and the production 
technology are fixed. In Chapters 8 and 9 we see how changes over time in 
each of these lead to growth in the economy’s output of goods and services.
n	 We have ignored the role of short-run sticky prices. In Chapters 10 
through 14, we develop a model of short-run fluctuations that includes 
sticky prices. We then discuss how the model of short-run fluctuations 
relates to the model of national income developed in this chapter.
Before going on to these chapters, go back to the beginning of this one and 
make sure you can answer the four groups of questions about national income 
that begin the chapter.
Summary
	1.	The factors of production and the production technology determine the 
economy’s output of goods and services. An increase in one of the factors 
of production or a technological advance raises output.
	2.	Competitive, profit-maximizing firms hire labor until the marginal product 
of labor equals the real wage. Similarly, these firms rent capital until the 

C H A P T E R  3   National Income: Where It Comes From and Where It Goes  | 77
marginal product of capital equals the real rental price. Therefore, each fac­
tor of production is paid its marginal product. If the production function 
has constant returns to scale, then according to Euler’s theorem, all output is 
used to compensate the inputs.
	3.	The economy’s output is used for consumption, investment, and ­government 
purchases. Consumption depends positively on disposable income. Investment 
depends negatively on the real interest rate. ­Government purchases and taxes 
are the exogenous variables of fiscal policy.
	4.	The real interest rate adjusts to equilibrate the supply and demand for 
the economy’s output—or, equivalently, the supply of loanable funds 
(saving) and the demand for loanable funds (investment). A decrease in 
national saving, perhaps because of an increase in government purchases 
or a decrease in taxes, decreases the supply of loanable funds, reduces the 
equilibrium amount of investment, and raises the interest rate. An increase 
in investment demand, perhaps because of a technological innovation or a 
tax incentive for investment, increases the demand for loanable funds and 
also raises the interest rate. An increase in investment demand increases 
the quantity of investment only if a higher interest rate stimulates addi­
tional saving.

	1.	Use the neoclassical theory of distribution to pre­
dict the impact on the real wage and the real rental 
price of capital of each of the following events:
	a.	A wave of immigration increases the labor force.
	b.	An earthquake destroys some of the capital 
stock.
	c.	A technological advance improves the pro­
duction function.
	d.	High inflation doubles the prices of all factors

	2.	
 • Suppose the production func­
tion in medieval Europe is Y 5 K 0.5L0.5, where 
K is the amount of land and L is the amount 
of labor. The economy begins with 100 units 
of land and 100 units of labor. Use a calculator 
and equations in the chapter to find a numerical 
answer to each of the following questions.
	a.	How much output does the economy ­produce?
	b.	What are the wage and the rental price of land?
	c.	What share of output does labor receive?
	d.	If a plague kills half the population, what is 
the new level of output?
	e.	What is the new wage and rental price of land?
	f.	What share of output does labor receive now?
	3.	If a 10 percent increase in both capital and labor 
causes output to increase by less than 10 ­percent, 
the production function is said to exhibit decreas­
ing returns to scale. If it causes output to increase 
by more than 10 percent, the production func­
tion is said to exhibit increasing returns to scale. 
Why might a production function exhibit 
decreasing or increasing returns to scale?
	4.	Suppose that an economy’s production function 
is Cobb–Douglas with parameter a 5 0.3.
	a.	What fractions of income do capital and labor 
receive?
	b.	Suppose that immigration increases the labor 
force by 10 percent. What happens to total 
P R O B L E M S  A N D  A P P L I C A T I O N S
output (in percent)? The rental price of 
­capital? The real wage?
	c.	Suppose that a gift of capital from abroad 
raises the capital stock by 10 percent. What 
happens to total output (in percent)? The 
rental price of capital? The real wage?
	d.	Suppose that a technological advance raises 
the value of the parameter A by 10 percent. 
What happens to total output (in percent)? 
The rental price of capital? The real wage?
	5.	Figure 3-5 shows that in U.S. data, labor’s share 
of total income is approximately a constant over 
time. Table 3-1 shows that the trend in the real 
wage closely tracks the trend in labor productiv­
ity. How are these facts related? Could the first 
fact be true without the second also being true? 
Use the mathematical expression for labor’s share 
to justify your answer.
	6.	According to the neoclassical theory of distribu­
tion, a worker’s real wage reflects her productiv­
ity. Let’s use this insight to examine the incomes 
of two groups of workers: farmers and barbers. 
Let Wf and Wb be the nominal wages of farmers 
and barbers, Pf and Pb be the prices of food and 
haircuts, and Af and Ab be the marginal produc­
tivity of farmers and barbers.
	a.	For each of the six variables defined above, 
state as precisely as you can the units in 
which they are measured. (Hint: Each answer 
takes the form “X per unit of Y.”)
	b.	Over the past century, the productivity of 
farmers Af has risen substantially because of 
technological progress. According to the neo­
classical theory, what should have happened 
to farmers’ real wage, Wf/Pf ? In what units is 
this real wage measured?
	c.	Over the same period, the productivity of bar­
bers Ab has remained constant. What should 
have happened to barbers’ real wage, Wb/Pb? 
In what units is this real wage ­measured?
	7.	What makes the demand for the economy’s 
output of goods and services equal the 
­supply?
	8.	Explain what happens to consumption, invest­
ment, and the interest rate when the govern­
ment increases taxes.

	d.	Suppose that, in the long run, workers can 
move freely between being farmers and being 
barbers. What does this mobility imply for 
the nominal wages of farmers and barbers, 
Wf and Wb?
	e.	What do your previous answers imply for the 
price of haircuts relative to the price of food, 
Pb/Pf ?
	f.	Suppose that barbers and farmers consume 
the same basket of goods and services. Who 
benefits more from technological progress in 
farming—farmers or barbers? Explain how 
your answer is consistent with the results on 
real wages in parts (b) and (c).
	7.	(This problem requires the use of calculus.) 
Consider a Cobb–Douglas production function 
with three inputs. K is capital (the number of 
machines), L is labor (the number of workers), and 
H is human capital (the number of college degrees 
among the workers). The production function is
Y 5 K 1/3 L1/3 H 1/3.
	a.	Derive an expression for the marginal product 
of labor. How does an increase in the amount 
of human capital affect the marginal product 
of labor?
	b.	Derive an expression for the marginal product 
of human capital. How does an increase in 
the amount of human capital affect the mar­
ginal product of human capital?
	c.	What is the income share paid to labor? 
What is the income share paid to human 
­capital? In the national income accounts of 
this economy, what share of total income do 
you think workers would appear to receive? 
(Hint: Consider where the return to human 
capital shows up.)
	d.	An unskilled worker earns the marginal 
product of labor, whereas a skilled worker 
earns the marginal product of labor plus 
the marginal product of human capital. 
Using your answers to parts (a) and (b), 
find the ratio of the skilled wage to the 
unskilled wage. How does an increase in 
the amount of human capital affect this 
ratio? Explain.
	e.	Some people advocate government funding 
of college scholarships as a way of ­creating 
a more egalitarian society. Others argue 
that scholarships help only those who are 
able to go to college. Do your answers to 
the ­preceding questions shed light on this 
debate?
	8.	The government raises taxes by $100 billion. If 
the marginal propensity to consume is 0.6, what 
happens to the following? Do they rise or fall? 
By what amounts?
	a.	Public saving
	b.	Private saving
	c.	National saving
	d.	Investment
	9.	Suppose that an increase in consumer confi­
dence raises consumers’ expectations about their 
future income and thus increases the amount 
they want to consume today. This might be 
interpreted as an upward shift in the consump­
tion function. How does this shift affect invest­
ment and the interest rate?
	10.

	12.	When the government subsidizes investment, 
such as with an investment tax credit, the sub­
sidy often applies to only some types of invest­
ment. This question asks you to consider the 
effect of such a change. Suppose there are two 
types of investment in the economy: business 
investment and residential investment. The inter­
est rate adjusts to equilibrate national saving and 
total investment, which is the sum of business 
investment and residential investment. Now sup­
pose that the government institutes an invest­
ment tax credit only for business investment.
	a.	How does this policy affect the demand curve 
for business investment? The demand curve 
for residential investment?
	b.	Draw the economy’s supply and demand 
curves for loanable funds. How does this 
policy affect the supply and demand for 
loanable funds? What happens to the 
equilibrium interest rate?
	c.	Compare the old and the new equilibria. 
How does this policy affect the total quan­
tity of investment? The quantity of busi­
ness investment? The quantity of residential 
­investment?
	13.	Suppose that consumption depends on the inter­
est rate. How, if at all, does this alter the conclu­
sions reached in the chapter about the impact of 
an increase in government purchases on invest­
ment, consumption, national saving, and the 
interest rate?
	14.	Macroeconomic data do not show a strong 
correlation between investment and interest 
rates. Let’s examine why this might be so. Use 
our model in which the interest rate adjusts to 
equilibrate the supply of loanable funds (which 
is upward sloping) and the demand for loanable 
funds (which is downward sloping).
	a.	Suppose the demand for loanable funds is 
stable but the supply fluctuates from year 
to year. What might cause these fluctua­
tions in supply? In this case, what correlation 
between investment and interest rates would 
you find?
	b.	Suppose the supply of loanable funds is 
stable but the demand fluctuates from year 
to year. What might cause these fluctuations 
in demand? In this case, what correlation 
between investment and interest rates would 
you find now?
	c.	Suppose that both supply and demand in this 
market fluctuate over time. If you were to 
construct a scatterplot of investment and the 
interest rate, what would you find?
	d.	 Which of the above three cases seems most 
empirically realistic to you? Why?

The Monetary System: 
What It Is and How It Works
There have been three great inventions since the beginning of time: fire, the 
wheel, and central banking.
—Will Rogers
T
he two arms of macroeconomic policy are monetary and fiscal policy. 
Fiscal policy encompasses the government’s decisions about spending 
and taxation, as we saw in the previous chapter. Monetary policy refers 
to decisions about the nation’s system of coin, currency, and banking. Fiscal pol­
icy is usually made by elected representatives, such as the U.S. Congress, British 
Parliament, or Japanese Diet. Monetary policy is made by central banks, which 
are typically set up by elected representatives but allowed to operate indepen­
dently. Examples include the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the 
Bank of Japan. Will Rogers was exaggerating when he said that central banking 
was one of the three greatest inventions of all time, but he was right in imply­
ing that these policymaking institutions have a great influence over the lives and 
livelihoods of citizens of all nations around the world.
Much of this book is aimed at explaining the effects and proper role of 
monetary and fiscal policy. This chapter begins our analysis of monetary policy. 
We address three related questions. First, what is money? Second, what is the 
role of a nation’s banking system in determining the amount of money in the 
economy? Third, how does a nation’s central bank influence the banking system 
and the money supply?
This chapter’s introduction to the monetary system provides the founda­
tion for understanding monetary policy. In the next chapter, consistent with 
the long-run focus of this part of book, we examine the long-run effects of 
monetary policy. The short-run effects of monetary policy are more complex. 
We start discussing that topic in Chapter 10, but it will take several chapters 
to develop a complete explanation. This chapter gets us ready. Both the long-
run and short-run analysis of monetary policy must be grounded in a firm 
understanding of what money is, how banks affect it, and how central banks 
control it.

 4-1	 What Is Money?
When we say that a person has a lot of money, we usually mean that he or she 
is wealthy. By contrast, economists use the term “money” in a more specialized 
way. To an economist, money does not refer to all wealth but only to one type 
of it: money is the stock of assets that can be readily used to make transactions. 
Roughly speaking, the dollars (or, in other countries, for example, pounds or 
yen) in the hands of the public make up the nation’s stock of money.
The Functions of Money
Money has three purposes: it is a store of value, a unit of account, and a medium 
of exchange.
As a store of value, money is a way to transfer purchasing power from the 
present to the future. If I work today and earn $100, I can hold the money and 
spend it tomorrow, next week, or next month. Money is not a perfect store of 
value: if prices are rising, the amount you can buy with any given quantity of 
money is falling. Even so, people hold money because they can trade it for goods 
and services at some time in the future.
As a unit of account, money provides the terms in which prices are quoted 
and debts are recorded. Microeconomics teaches us that resources are allocated 
according to relative prices—the prices of goods relative to other goods—yet 
stores post their prices in dollars and cents. A car dealer tells you that a car costs 
$20,000, not 400 shirts (even though it may amount to the same thing). Similarly, 
most debts require the debtor to deliver a specified number of dollars in the 
future, not a specified amount of some commodity. Money is the yardstick with 
which we measure economic transactions.
As a medium of exchange, money is what we use to buy goods and ser­
vices. “This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private” is printed on 
the U.S. dollar. When we walk into stores, we are confident that the shopkeep­
ers will accept our money in exchange for the items they are selling. The ease 
with which an asset can be converted into the medium of exchange and used to 
buy other things—goods and services—is sometimes called the asset’s liquidity. 
Because money is the medium of exchange, it is the economy’s most liquid asset.
To better understand the functions of money, try to imagine an economy 
without it: a barter economy. In such a world, trade requires the double coincidence 
of wants—the unlikely happenstance of two people each having a good that the 
other wants at the right time and place to make an exchange. A barter economy 
permits only simple transactions.
Money makes more indirect transactions possible. A professor uses his salary 
to buy books; the book publisher uses its revenue from the sale of books to buy 
paper; the paper company uses its revenue from the sale of paper to buy wood that 
it grinds into paper pulp; the lumber company uses revenue from the sale of wood 
to pay the lumberjack; the lumberjack uses his income to send his child to col­
lege; and the college uses its tuition receipts to pay the salary of the professor. In a 
complex, modern economy, trade is usually indirect and requires the use of money.

The Types of Money
Money takes many forms. In the U.S. economy we 
make transactions with an item whose sole function 
is to act as money: dollar bills. These pieces of green 
paper with small portraits of famous Americans 
would have little value if they were not widely 
accepted as money. Money that has no intrinsic 
value is called fiat money because it is established 
as money by government decree, or fiat.
Fiat money is the norm in most economies today, 
but most societies in the past have used a commod­
ity with some intrinsic value for money. This type 
of money is called commodity money. The most 
widespread example is gold. When people use gold as 
money (or use paper money that is redeemable for gold), the economy is said to be 
on a gold standard. Gold is a form of commodity money because it can be used for 
various purposes—jewelry, dental fillings, and so on—as well as for transactions. The 
gold standard was common throughout the world during the late nineteenth century.

CASE STUDY
Money in a POW Camp
An unusual form of commodity money developed in some Nazi prisoner of war 
(POW) camps during World War II. The Red Cross supplied the prisoners with 
various goods—food, clothing, cigarettes, and so on. Yet these rations were allo­
cated without close attention to personal preferences, so the allocations were often 
inefficient. One prisoner might have preferred chocolate, while another might 
have preferred cheese, and a third might have wanted a new shirt. The differing 
tastes and endowments of the prisoners led them to trade with one another.
Barter proved to be an inconvenient way to allocate these resources, however, 
because it required the double coincidence of wants. In other words, a barter 
system was not the easiest way to ensure that each prisoner received the goods 
he valued most. Even the limited economy of the POW camp needed some form 
of money to facilitate transactions.
Eventually, cigarettes became the established “currency” in which prices were 
quoted and with which trades were made. A shirt, for example, cost about 80 
cigarettes. Services were also quoted in cigarettes: some prisoners offered to do 
other prisoners’ laundry for two cigarettes per garment. Even nonsmokers were 
happy to accept cigarettes in exchange, knowing they could trade the cigarettes 
in the future for some good they did enjoy. Within the POW camp the cigarette 
became the store of value, the unit of account, and the medium of exchange.1 n

189–201. The use of cigarettes as money is not limited to this example. In the Soviet Union in 
the late 1980s, packs of Marlboros were preferred to the ruble in the large underground economy.

The Development of Fiat Money
It is not surprising that in any society, no matter how primitive, some form of 
commodity money arises to facilitate exchange: people are willing to accept a 
commodity currency such as gold because it has intrinsic value. The develop­
ment of fiat money, however, is more perplexing. What would make people 
begin to value something that is intrinsically useless?
To understand how the evolution from commodity money to fiat money 
takes place, imagine an economy in which people carry around bags of gold. 
When a purchase is made, the buyer measures out the appropriate amount of 
gold. If the seller is convinced that the weight and purity of the gold are right, 
the buyer and seller make the exchange.
The government might first get involved in the monetary system to help people 
reduce transaction costs. Using raw gold as money is costly because it takes time to 
verify the purity of the gold and to measure the correct quantity. To reduce these 
costs, the government can mint gold coins of known purity and weight. The coins 
are easier to use than gold bullion because their values are widely recognized.
The next step is for the government to accept gold from the public in 
exchange for gold certificates—pieces of paper that can be redeemed for a cer­
tain quantity of gold. If people believe the government’s promise to redeem the 
paper bills for gold, the bills are just as valuable as the gold itself. In addition, 
because the bills are lighter than gold (and gold coins), they are easier to use in 
transactions. Eventually, no one carries gold around at all, and these gold–backed 
government bills become the monetary standard.
Finally, the gold backing becomes irrelevant. If no one ever bothers to redeem 
the bills for gold, no one cares if the option is abandoned. As long as everyone 
continues to accept the paper bills in exchange, they will have value and serve as 
money. Thus, the system of commodity money evolves into a system of fiat money. 
Notice that in the end the use of money in exchange is a social convention: 
everyone values fiat money because they expect everyone else to value it.
Money and Social Conventions on the Island of Yap
The economy of   Yap, a small island in the Pacific, once had a type of money that 
was something between commodity and fiat money. The traditional medium of 
exchange in Yap was fei, stone wheels up to 12 feet in diameter. These stones had 
holes in the center so that they could be carried on poles and used for exchange.
Large stone wheels are not a convenient form of money. The stones were heavy, 
so it took substantial effort for a new owner to take his fei home after completing a 
transaction.  Although the monetary system facilitated exchange, it did so at great cost.
Eventually, it became common practice for the new owner of the fei not to 
bother to take physical possession of the stone. Instead, the new owner accepted 
a claim to the fei without moving it. In future bargains, he traded this claim 
for goods that he wanted. Having physical possession of the stone became less 
important than having legal claim to it.

In 2009, the world was introduced to a new 
and unusual asset, called bitcoin. Conceived 
by an anonymous computer expert (or group 
of experts) who goes by the name Satoshi 
Nakamoto, bitcoin is intended to be a form 
of money that exists only in electronic form. 
Individuals originally obtain bitcoins by using 
computers to solve complex mathematical prob­
lems. The bitcoin protocol is designed to limit 
the number of bitcoins that can ever be “mined” 
in this way to 21 million units (though experts 
disagree whether the number of bitcoins is truly 
limited). After the bitcoins are created, they can 
be used in exchange. They can be bought and 
sold for U.S. dollars and other currencies on 
organized bitcoin exchanges, where the exchange 
rate is set by supply and demand. You can use 
bitcoins to buy things from any vendor who is 
willing to accept them.
As a form of money, bitcoins are neither com­
modity money nor fiat money. Unlike commodity 
money, they have no intrinsic value. You can’t use 
bitcoins for anything other than exchange. Unlike 
fiat money, they are not created by government 
decree. Indeed, many fans of bitcoin embrace the 
fact that this electronic cash exists apart from 
government (and some users of it are engaged 
in illicit transactions such as the drug trade). 
Bitcoins have value only to the extent that people 
accept the social convention of taking them in 
Bitcoin: The Strange Case of a Virtual Money
exchange. From this perspective, the modern bit­
coin resembles the primitive money of Yap.
Throughout its short history, the value of a 
bitcoin, as measured by its price in U.S. dollars, 
has fluctuated wildly. On its first day of trading 
in 2009, the price of a bitcoin was only about 
5 cents, and it stayed below 10 cents for the fol­
lowing year. In 2011, the price rose to above $1, 
and in 2013, it briefly exceeded $1,200, before 
falling below $500 in 2014. Gold is often con­
sidered a risky asset, but the day-to-day volatility 
of bitcoin prices has been about seven times the 
volatility of gold prices.
The long-term success of bitcoin depends on 
whether it succeeds in performing the functions 
of money: a store of value, a unit of account, and 
a medium of exchange. Many economists are 
skeptical that it will do these tasks well. Bitcoin’s 
volatility makes it a risky way to hold wealth and 
an inconvenient measure in which to post prices. 
At least so far, few retailers accept it in exchange, 
and those that do apparently have only a small 
volume of bitcoin transactions. In 2014, the 
bankruptcy of Mt. Gox, a large bitcoin exchange, 
possibly due to theft of bitcoins by computer 
hackers, shook the public’s confidence in this 
new virtual currency.
Advocates of bitcoin see it as the money of the 
future. Another possibility, however, is that it is a 
speculative fad that will eventually run its course.3

This practice was put to a test when a valuable stone was lost at sea during a 
storm. Because the owner lost his money by accident rather than through negligence, 
everyone agreed that his claim to the fei remained valid. Generations later, when no 
one alive had ever seen this stone, the claim to this fei was still valued in exchange.
Even today, stone money is still valued on the island. It is, however, not the 
medium of exchange used for most routine transactions. For that purpose, the 
11,000 current residents of   Yap use something a bit more prosaic: the U.S. dollar.2 n

How the Quantity of Money Is Controlled
The quantity of money available in an economy is called the money supply. 
In a system of commodity money, the money supply is simply the quantity of 
that commodity. In an economy that uses fiat money, such as most economies 
today, the government controls the supply of money: legal restrictions give the 
government a monopoly on the printing of money. Just as the level of taxation 
and the level of government purchases are policy instruments of the government, 
so is the quantity of money. The government’s control over the money supply is 
called monetary policy.
In the United States and many other countries, monetary policy is del­
egated to a partially independent institution called the central bank. The 
central bank of the United States is the Federal Reserve—often called the 
Fed. If you look at a U.S. dollar bill, you will see that it is called a Federal 
Reserve Note. Decisions about monetary policy are made by the Fed’s Federal 
Open Market Committee. This committee consists of two groups: (1) mem­
bers of the Federal Reserve Board, who are appointed by the president 
and confirmed by Congress, and (2) the presidents of the regional Federal 
Reserve Banks, who are chosen by these banks’ boards of directors. The 
Federal Open Market Committee meets about every six weeks to discuss and 
set monetary policy.
The primary way in which the Fed controls the supply of money is through 
open-market operations—the purchase and sale of government bonds. When 
the Fed wants to increase the money supply, it uses some of the dollars it has to 
buy government bonds from the public. Because these dollars leave the Fed and 
enter into the hands of the public, the purchase increases the quantity of money 
in circulation. Conversely, when the Fed wants to decrease the money supply, it 
sells some government bonds from its own portfolio. This open–market sale of 
bonds takes some dollars out of the hands of the public and, thus, decreases the 
quantity of money in circulation. (Later in the chapter, we explore in more detail 
how the Fed controls the supply of money.)
How the Quantity of Money Is Measured
One of our goals is to determine how the money supply affects the economy; 
we turn to that topic in the next chapter. As a background for that analysis, let’s 
first discuss how economists measure the quantity of money.
Because money is the stock of assets used for transactions, the quantity of 
money is the quantity of those assets. In simple economies, this quantity is easy to 
measure. In the POW camp, the quantity of money was the number of cigarettes 
in the camp. On the island of   Yap, the quantity of money was the number of fei 
on the island. But how can we measure the quantity of money in more complex 
economies? The answer is not obvious, because no single asset is used for all 
transactions. People can use various assets, such as cash in their wallets or deposits 
in their checking accounts, to make transactions, although some assets are more 
convenient to use than others.

C H A P T E R  4   The Monetary System: What It Is and How It Works  | 87
The most obvious asset to include in the quantity of money is currency, the 
sum of outstanding paper money and coins. Most day–to–day transactions use 
currency as the medium of exchange.
A second type of asset used for transactions is demand deposits, the funds 
people hold in their checking accounts. If most sellers accept personal checks 
or debit cards that access checking accounts balances, then assets in a checking 
account are almost as convenient as currency. That is, the assets are in a form 
that can easily facilitate a transaction. Demand deposits are therefore added to 
currency when measuring the quantity of money.
Once we admit the logic of including demand deposits in the measured 
money stock, many other assets become candidates for inclusion. Funds 
in savings accounts, for example, can be easily transferred into checking 
accounts or accessed by debit cards; these assets are almost as convenient for 
transactions. Money market mutual funds allow investors to write checks 
against their accounts, although restrictions sometimes apply with regard to 
the size of the check or the number of checks written. Because these assets 
can be easily used for transactions, they should arguably be included in the 
quantity of money.
Because it is hard to judge which assets should be included in the money 
stock, more than one measure is available. Table 4–1 presents the three mea­
sures of the money stock that the Federal Reserve calculates for the U.S. 
economy, together with a list of which assets are included in each measure. 
From the smallest to the largest, they are designated C, M1, and M2. The most 
common measures for studying the effects of money on the economy are M1 
and M2.

 4-2	 The Role of Banks in the Monetary 
System
Earlier, we introduced the concept of “money supply” in a highly simplified 
manner. We defined the quantity of money as the number of dollars held by the 
public, and we assumed that the Federal Reserve controls the supply of money 
by increasing or decreasing the number of dollars in circulation through open-
market operations. This explanation was a good starting point for understanding 
what determines the supply of money, but it is incomplete because it omits the 
role of the banking system in this process.
In this section we see that the money supply is determined not only by 
Fed policy but also by the behavior of households (which hold money) and 
banks (in which money is held). We begin by recalling that the money sup­
ply includes both currency in the hands of the public and deposits (such as 
checking account balances) at banks that households can use on demand 
for transactions. If M denotes the money supply, C currency, and D demand 
deposits, we can write
Money Supply 5 Currency 1 Demand Deposits

D.
Many people use credit or debit cards to make pur­
chases. Because money is the medium of exchange, 
one might naturally wonder how these cards fit 
into the measurement and analysis of money.
Let’s start with credit cards. One might guess 
that credit cards are part of the economy’s stock 
of money, but in fact measures of the quantity 
of money do not take credit cards into account. 
This is because credit cards are not really a 
method of payment but a method of deferring 
payment. When you buy an item with a credit 
card, the bank that issued the card pays the store 
what it is due. Later, you repay the bank. When 
the time comes to pay your credit card bill, you 
will likely do so by writing a check against your 
checking account. The balance in this checking 
account is part of the economy’s stock of money.
The story is different with debit cards, which 
automatically withdraw funds from a bank account 
How Do Credit Cards and Debit Cards Fit into the 
Monetary System?
to pay for items bought. Rather than allowing users 
to postpone payment for their purchases, a debit 
card allows users immediate access to deposits in 
their bank accounts. Using a debit card is similar 
to writing a check. The account balances that lie 
behind debit cards are included in measures of the 
quantity of money.
Even though credit cards are not a form of 
money, they are still important for analyzing the 
monetary system. Because people with credit 
cards can pay many of their bills all at once at 
the end of the month, rather than sporadically as 
they make purchases, they may hold less money 
on average than people without credit cards. 
Thus, the increased popularity of credit cards 
may reduce the amount of money that people 
choose to hold. In other words, credit cards are 
not part of the supply of money, but they may 
affect the demand for money.

C H A P T E R  4   The Monetary System: What It Is and How It Works  | 89
To understand the money supply, we must understand the interaction between 
currency and demand deposits and how the banking system, together with Fed 
policy, influences these two components of the money supply.
100–Percent–Reserve Banking
We begin by imagining a world without banks. In such a world, all money takes 
the form of currency, and the quantity of money is simply the amount of cur­
rency that the public holds. For this discussion, suppose that there is $1,000 of 
currency in the economy.
Now introduce banks. At first, suppose that banks accept deposits but do not 
make loans. The only purpose of the banks is to provide a safe place for deposi­
tors to keep their money.
The deposits that banks have received but have not lent out are called 
reserves. Some reserves are held in the vaults of local banks throughout the 
country, but most are held at a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve. In 
our hypothetical economy, all deposits are held as reserves: banks simply accept 
deposits, place the money in reserve, and leave the money there until the deposi­
tor makes a withdrawal or writes a check against the balance. This system is 
called 100–percent–reserve banking.
Suppose that households deposit the economy’s entire $1,000 in Firstbank. 
Firstbank’s balance sheet—its accounting statement of assets and liabilities—
looks like this:
Firstbank’s Balance Sheet
	
Assets	
Liabilities
Reserves	
$1,000	
Deposits	
$1,000
The bank’s assets are the $1,000 it holds as reserves; the bank’s liabilities are the 
$1,000 it owes to depositors. Unlike banks in our economy, this bank is not mak­
ing loans, so it will not earn profit from its assets. The bank presumably charges 
depositors a small fee to cover its costs.
What is the money supply in this economy? Before the creation of Firstbank, 
the money supply was the $1,000 of currency. After the creation of Firstbank, 
the money supply is the $1,000 of demand deposits. A dollar deposited in a bank 
reduces currency by one dollar and raises deposits by one dollar, so the money 
supply remains the same. If banks hold 100 percent of deposits in reserve, the banking 
system does not affect the supply of money.
Fractional–Reserve Banking
Now imagine that banks start to use some of their deposits to make loans—for 
example, to families who are buying houses or to firms that are investing in 
new plants and equipment. The advantage to banks is that they can charge 
interest on the loans. The banks must keep some reserves on hand so that 

90 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
reserves are available whenever depositors want to make withdrawals. But as 
long as the amount of new deposits approximately equals the amount of with­
drawals, a bank need not keep all its deposits in reserve. Thus, bankers have 
an incentive to make loans. When they do so, we have fractional–reserve 
banking, a system under which banks keep only a fraction of their deposits 
in reserve.
Here is Firstbank’s balance sheet after it makes a loan:
Firstbank’s Balance Sheet
	
Assets	
Liabilities
Reserves	
$200	
Deposits	
$1,000
Loans	
$800
This balance sheet assumes that the reserve–deposit ratio—the fraction of deposits 
kept in reserve—is 20 percent. Firstbank keeps $200 of the $1,000 in deposits in 
reserve and lends out the remaining $800.
Notice that Firstbank increases the supply of money by $800 when it 
makes this loan. Before the loan is made, the money supply is $1,000, equal­
ing the deposits in Firstbank. After the loan is made, the money supply is 
$1,800: the depositor still has a demand deposit of $1,000, but now the bor­
rower holds $800 in currency. Thus, in a system of fractional–reserve banking, 
banks create money.
The creation of money does not stop with Firstbank. If the borrower deposits 
the $800 in another bank (or if the borrower uses the $800 to pay someone who 
then deposits it), the process of money creation continues. Here is the balance 
sheet of Secondbank:
Secondbank’s Balance Sheet
	
Assets	
Liabilities
Reserves	
$160	
Deposits	
$800
Loans	
$640
Secondbank receives the $800 in deposits, keeps 20 percent, or $160, in reserve, 
and then loans out $640. Thus, Secondbank creates $640 of money. If this $640 is 
eventually deposited in Thirdbank, this bank keeps 20 percent, or $128, in reserve 
and loans out $512, resulting in this balance sheet:
Thirdbank’s Balance Sheet
	
Assets	
Liabilities
Reserves	
$128	
Deposits	
$640
Loans	
$512
The process goes on and on. With each deposit and subsequent loan, more 
money is created.

C H A P T E R  4   The Monetary System: What It Is and How It Works  | 91
This process of money creation can continue forever, but it does not create 
an infinite amount of money. Letting rr denote the reserve–deposit ratio, the 
amount of money that the original $1,000 creates is
	
Original Deposit 5 $1,000
	
Firstbank Lending 5 (1 2 rr) 3 $1,000
	
Secondbank Lending 5 (1 2 rr)2 3 $1,000
	
Thirdbank Lending 5 (1 2 rr)3 3 $1,000
	
Total Money Supply 5 [1 1 (1 2 rr) 1 (1 2 rr)2
	
1 (1 2 rr)3 1 . . . ] 3 $1,000
	
5 (1/rr) 3 $1,000.
Each $1 of reserves generates $(1/rr) of money. In our example, rr 5 0.2, so the 
original $1,000 generates $5,000 of money.4
The banking system’s ability to create money is the primary difference 
between banks and other financial institutions. As we first discussed in Chapter 3, 
financial markets have the important function of transferring the economy’s 
resources from those households that wish to save some of their income for the 
future to those households and firms that wish to borrow to buy investment 
goods to be used in future production. The process of transferring funds from 
savers to borrowers is called financial intermediation. Many institutions in the 
economy act as financial intermediaries: the most prominent examples are the 
stock market, the bond market, and the banking system. Yet, of these financial 
institutions, only banks have the legal authority to create assets (such as check­
ing accounts) that are part of the money supply. Therefore, banks are the only 
financial institutions that directly influence the money supply.
Note that although the system of fractional–reserve banking creates money, 
it does not create wealth. When a bank loans out some of its reserves, it gives 
borrowers the ability to make transactions and therefore increases the supply of 
money. The borrowers are also undertaking a debt obligation to the bank, how­
ever, so the loan does not make them wealthier. In other words, the creation of 
money by the banking system increases the economy’s liquidity, not its wealth.
Bank Capital, Leverage, and Capital Requirements
The model of the banking system presented so far is simplified. That is not 
necessarily a problem; after all, all models are simplified. But it is worth drawing 
attention to one particular simplifying assumption.
4Mathematical note: The last step in the derivation of the total money supply uses the algebraic result for 
the sum of an infinite geometric series. According to this result, if x is a number between 21 and 1, then
1 1 x 1 x2 1 x3 1 . . . 5 1/(1 2 x).
In this application, x 5 (1 2 rr )..

92 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
In the bank balance sheets we just examined, a bank takes in deposits and 
either uses them to make loans or holds them as reserves. Based on this discus­
sion, you might think that it does not take any resources to open up a bank. 
That is, however, not true. Opening a bank requires some capital. That is, the 
bank owners must start with some financial resources to get the business going. 
Those resources are called bank capital or, equivalently, the equity of the 
bank’s owners.
Here is what a more realistic balance sheet for a bank would look like:
Realbank’s Balance Sheet
	
Assets	
Liabilities and Owners’ Equity
Reserves	
$200	
Deposits	
$750
Loans	
$500	
Debt	
$200
Securities	
$300	
Capital (owners’ equity)	
$50
The bank obtains resources from its owners, who provide capital, and also by 
taking in deposits and issuing debt. It uses these resources in three ways. Some 
funds are held as reserves; some are used to make bank loans; and some are used 
to buy financial securities, such as government or corporate bonds. The bank 
allocates its resources among these asset classes, taking into account the risk and 
return that each offers and any regulations that restrict its choices. The reserves, 
loans, and securities on the left side of the balance sheet must equal, in total, the 
deposits, debt, and capital on the right side of the balance sheet.
This business strategy relies on a phenomenon called leverage, which is the 
use of borrowed money to supplement existing funds for purposes of investment. 
The leverage ratio is the ratio of the bank’s total assets (the left side of the balance 
sheet) to bank capital (the one item on the right side of the balance sheet that 
represents the owners’ equity). In this example, the leverage ratio is $1000/$50, 
or 20. This means that for every dollar of capital that the bank owners have con­
tributed, the bank has $20 of assets and, thus, $19 of deposits and debts.
One implication of leverage is that, in bad times, a bank can lose much of 
its capital very quickly. To see how, let’s continue with this numerical example. 
If the bank’s assets fall in value by a mere 5 percent, then the $1,000 of assets is 
now worth only $950. Because the depositors and debt holders have the legal 
right to be paid first, the value of the owners’ equity falls to zero. That is, when 
the leverage ratio is 20, a 5 percent fall in the value of the bank assets leads to a 
100 percent fall in bank capital. The fear that bank capital may be running out, 
and thus that depositors may not be fully repaid, is typically what generates bank 
runs when there is no deposit insurance.
One restriction that bank regulators put on banks is that the banks must 
hold sufficient capital. The goal of such a capital requirement is to ensure 
that banks will be able to pay off their depositors and other creditors. The 
amount of capital required depends on the kind of assets a bank holds. If the 
bank holds safe assets such as government bonds, regulators require less capital 
than if the bank holds risky assets such as loans to borrowers whose credit is 
of dubious quality.

C H A P T E R  4   The Monetary System: What It Is and How It Works  | 93
The arcane issues of bank capital and leverage are usually left to bankers, regu­
lators, and financial experts, but they became prominent topics of public debate 
during and after the financial crisis of 2008–2009. During this period, declining 
house prices caused many banks and other financial institutions to incur losses 
on mortgage-backed securities. Because of leverage, the losses to bank capital 
were proportionately much larger than the losses to bank assets. Sometimes these 
losses were so large that the bank became insolvent—that is, its assets fell below 
its liabilities, sending bank capital to below zero. These events had ramifications 
not only within the financial system but more broadly throughout the economy. 
In the aftermath of the crisis, many observers suggested that banks be subject to 
much higher capital requirements.5
For the rest of this chapter, we can put aside the issues of bank capital and 
leverage. But they will resurface when we discuss financial crises in Chapters 12 
and 20.
 4-3	 How Central Banks Influence the 
Money Supply
Now that we have seen what money is and how the banking system affects the 
amount of money in the economy, we are ready to examine how the central 
bank influences the banking system and the money supply. This influence is the 
essence of monetary policy.
A Model of the Money Supply
If the Federal Reserve adds a dollar to the economy and that dollar is held as cur­
rency, the money supply increases by exactly one dollar. But as we have seen, if 
that dollar is deposited in a bank, and banks hold only a fraction of their deposits 
in reserve, the money supply increases by more than one dollar. As a result, to 
understand what determines the money supply under fractional–reserve banking, 
we need to take account of the interactions among (1) the Fed’s decision about 
how many dollars to create, (2) banks’ decisions about whether to hold deposits 
as reserves or to lend them out, and (3) households’ decisions about whether to 
hold their money in the form of currency or demand deposits.
The model has three exogenous variables:
■	 The monetary base B is the total number of dollars held by the public 
as currency C and by the banks as reserves R. It is directly controlled by 
the Federal Reserve.
5On the case for greater capital requirements, see Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig, The Bankers’ 
New Clothes: What’s Wrong with Banking and What to Do About It (Princeton NJ: Princeton 
University Press, 2013).

■	 The reserve–deposit ratio rr is the fraction of deposits that banks hold 
in reserve. It is determined by the business policies of banks and the laws 
regulating banks.
■	 The currency–deposit ratio cr is the amount of currency C people 
hold as a fraction of their holdings of demand deposits D. It reflects 
the preferences of households about the form of money they wish 
to hold.
By showing how the money supply depends on the monetary base, the reserve–
deposit ratio, and the currency–deposit ratio, this model is useful for understand­
ing how Fed policy and the choices of banks and households influence the 
money supply.
We begin with the definitions of the money supply and the monetary base:
	
M 5 C 1 D,
	
B 5 C 1 R.
The first equation states that the money supply is the sum of currency and 
demand deposits. The second equation states that the monetary base is the sum 
of currency and bank reserves. To solve for the money supply as a function of 
the three exogenous variables (B, rr, and cr), we divide the first equation by the 
second to obtain
​ M 
__ 
B ​ 5 ​ C 1 D 
______ 
C 1 R ​.
We then divide both the top and bottom of the expression on the right by D.
​ M 
__ 
B ​ 5 ​ C/D 1 1 
___________ 
 
C/D 1 R/D ​.
Note that C/D is the currency–deposit ratio cr and that R/D is the reserve–
deposit ratio rr. Making these substitutions, and bringing the B from the left to 
the right side of the equation, we obtain
M 5 ​ cr 1 1 
______ 
cr 1 rr ​ 3 B.
This equation shows how the money supply depends on the three exogenous 
variables.
We can now see that the money supply is proportional to the monetary base. 
The factor of proportionality, (cr 1 1)/(cr 1 rr), is denoted m and is called the 
money multiplier. We can write
M 5 m 3 B.
Each dollar of the monetary base produces m dollars of money. Because the 
monetary base has a multiplied effect on the money supply, the monetary base is 
sometimes called high–powered money.

C H A P T E R  4   The Monetary System: What It Is and How It Works  | 95
Here’s a numerical example. Suppose that the monetary base B is $800 billion, 
the reserve–deposit ratio rr is 0.1, and the currency–deposit ratio cr is 0.8. In this 
case, the money multiplier is
m 5  0.8 1 1 
________ 
0.8 1
 
0.1 ​ 5 2.0,
and the money supply is
M 5 2.0 3 $800 billion 5 $1,600 billion.
Each dollar of the monetary base generates two dollars of money, so the total 
money supply is $1,600 billion.
We can now see how changes in the three exogenous variables—B, rr, 
and cr —cause the money supply to change.
	1.	The money supply is proportional to the monetary base. Thus, an increase 
in the monetary base increases the money supply by the same percentage.
	2.	The lower the reserve–deposit ratio, the more loans banks make, and the 
more money banks create from every dollar of reserves. Thus, a decrease 
in the reserve–deposit ratio raises the money multiplier and the money 
supply.
	3.	The lower the currency–deposit ratio, the fewer dollars of the monetary 
base the public holds as currency, the more base dollars banks hold as 
reserves, and the more money banks can create. Thus, a decrease in the 
currency–deposit ratio raises the money multiplier and the money supply.
With this model in mind, we can discuss the ways in which the Fed influences 
the money supply.
The Instruments of Monetary Policy
Although it is often convenient to make the simplifying assumption that the 
Federal Reserve controls the money supply directly, in fact the Fed controls 
the money supply indirectly using a variety of instruments. These instruments 
can be classified into two broad groups: those that influence the monetary 
base and those that influence the reserve–deposit ratio and thereby the money 
multiplier.
How the Fed Changes the Monetary Base  As we discussed earlier in 
the chapter, open–market operations are the purchases and sales of government 
bonds by the Fed. When the Fed buys bonds from the public, the dollars 
it pays for the bonds increase the monetary base and thereby increase the 
money supply. When the Fed sells bonds to the public, the dollars it receives 
reduce the monetary base and thus decrease the money supply. Open–market 
operations are the policy instrument that the Fed uses most often. In fact, 
the Fed conducts open–market operations in New York bond markets almost 
every weekday.

96 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
The Fed can also alter the monetary base and the money supply by lending 
reserves to banks. Banks borrow from the Fed when they think they do not 
have enough reserves on hand, either to satisfy bank regulators, meet depositor 
withdrawals, make new loans, or satisfy some other business requirement. When 
the Fed lends to a bank that is having trouble obtaining funds from elsewhere, it 
is said to act as the lender of last resort.
There are various ways in which banks can borrow from the Fed. Traditionally, 
banks have borrowed at the Fed’s so-called discount window; the discount rate 
is the interest rate that the Fed charges on these loans. The lower the discount 
rate, the cheaper are borrowed reserves, and the more banks borrow at the Fed’s 
discount window. Hence, a reduction in the discount rate raises the monetary 
base and the money supply.
In response to the financial crisis of 2008–2009, the Federal Reserve set up 
a variety of new mechanisms for banks to borrow from it. For example, under 
the Term Auction Facility, the Fed set a quantity of funds it wants to lend to 
banks, and eligible banks then bid to borrow those funds. The loans went to 
the highest eligible bidders—that is, to the banks that had acceptable collateral 
and offered to pay the highest interest rate. Unlike at the discount window, 
where the Fed sets the price of a loan and the banks determine the quantity of 
borrowing, at the Term Auction Facility the Fed set the quantity of borrowing 
and a competitive bidding process among banks determined the price. The last 
Term Auction Facility auction was conducted in 2010, but this policy illustrates 
that the Federal Reserve has various ways to alter the monetary base and the 
money supply.
How the Fed Changes the Reserve–Deposit Ratio  As our model of 
the money supply shows, the money multiplier is the link between the 
monetary base and the money supply. The money multiplier depends on 
the reserve–deposit ratio, which in turn is influenced by various Fed policy 
instruments.
Reserve requirements are Fed regulations that impose a minimum 
reserve–deposit ratio on banks. An increase in reserve requirements tends 
to raise the reserve–deposit ratio and thus lower the money multiplier and 
the money supply. Changes in reserve requirements are the least frequently 
used of the Fed’s policy instruments. Moreover, in recent years, this particu­
lar tool has become less effective because many banks hold more reserves 
than are required. Reserves above the minimum required are called excess 
reserves.
In October 2008, the Fed started paying interest on reserves. That is, when 
a bank holds reserves on deposit at the Fed, the Fed now pays the bank interest 
on those deposits. This change gives the Fed another tool with which to influ­
ence the economy. The higher the interest rate on reserves, the more reserves 
banks will choose to hold. Thus, an increase in the interest rate on reserves will 
tend to increase the reserve–deposit ratio, lower the money multiplier, and lower 
the money supply. Because the Fed has paid interest on reserves for a relatively 
short time, it is not yet clear how important this new instrument will be in the 
conduct of monetary policy.

CASE STUDY
Quantitative Easing and the Exploding Monetary Base
Figure 4-1 shows the monetary base from 1960 to 2014. You can see that some­
thing extraordinary happened in the last few years of this period. From 1960 to 
2007, the monetary base grew gradually over time. But then from 2007 to 2014 
it spiked up substantially, increasing about fivefold over just a few years.
This huge increase in the monetary base is attributable to actions the Fed­
eral Reserve took during the financial crisis and economic downturn of this 
period. With the financial markets in turmoil, the Fed pursued its job as a 
lender of last resort with historic vigor. It began by buying large quantities of 
mortgage-backed securities. Its goal was to restore order to the mortgage market 
so that would-be homeowners could borrow. Later, the Fed pursued a policy 
of buying long-term government bonds to keep their prices up and long-term 
interest rates down. This policy, called quantitative easing, is a kind of open-market 
operation. But rather than buying short-term Treasury bills, as the Fed normally 
does in an open-market operation, it bought longer-term and somewhat riskier 
securities. These open-market purchases led to the substantial increase in the 
monetary base.
FIGURE  4-1
The Monetary Base  The monetary base has historically grown relatively 
smoothly over time, but from 2007 to 2014 it increased approximately fivefold. 
The huge expansion in the monetary base, however, was not accompanied by 
similar increases in M1 and M2.

The huge expansion in the monetary base, however, did not lead to a similar 
increase in broader measures of the money supply. While the monetary base 
increased about 400 percent from 2007 to 2014, M1 increased by only 100 per­
cent and M2 by only 55 percent. These figures show that the tremendous expan­
sion in the monetary base was accompanied by a large decline in the money 
multiplier. Why did this decline occur?
The model of the money supply presented earlier in this chapter shows that a 
key determinant of the money multiplier is the reserve ratio rr. From 2007 to 2014, 
the reserve ratio increased substantially because banks chose to hold substantial 
quantities of excess reserves. That is, rather than making loans, the banks kept much 
of their available funds in reserve. (Excess reserves rose from about $1.5 billion in 
2007 to about $2.5 trillion in 2014.) This decision prevented the normal process of 
money creation that occurs in a system of fractional-reserve banking.
Why did banks choose to hold so much in excess reserves? Part of the reason 
is that banks had made many bad loans leading up to the financial crisis; when 
this fact became apparent, bankers tried to tighten their credit standards and make 
loans only to those they were confident could repay. In addition, interest rates had 
fallen to such low levels that making loans was not as profitable as it normally is. 
Banks did not lose much by leaving their financial resources idle as excess reserves.
Although the explosion in the monetary base did not lead to a similar 
explosion in the money supply, some observers feared that it still might. As the 
economy recovered from the economic downturn and interest rates rose to 
normal levels, they argued, banks could reduce their holdings of excess reserves 
by making loans. The money supply would start growing, perhaps too quickly.
Policymakers at the Federal Reserve, however, thought they could handle this 
problem if and when it arose. One possibility would be to drain the banking system 
of reserves by engaging in the opposite open-market operation that had created 
them in the first place—that is, by selling the Treasury bonds and other securities 
in the Fed’s portfolio. Another policy option for the Fed would be to increase 
the interest rate it pays on reserves. A higher interest rate on reserves would make 
holding reserves more profitable for banks, thereby discouraging bank lending and 
keeping the money multiplier low. Which of these “exit strategies” the Fed would 
use was still to be determined as this book was going to press.6 n

of Kansas, 2013.
Problems in Monetary Control
The various instruments give the Fed substantial power to influence the money 
supply. Nonetheless, the Fed cannot control the money supply perfectly. Bank 
discretion in conducting business can cause the money supply to change in 
ways the Fed did not anticipate. For example, banks may choose to hold more 
excess reserves, a decision that increases the reserve–deposit ratio and lowers the 

C H A P T E R  4   The Monetary System: What It Is and How It Works  | 99
money supply. As another example, the Fed cannot precisely control the amount 
banks borrow from the discount window. The less banks borrow, the smaller 
the monetary base, and the smaller the money supply. Hence, the money supply 
sometimes moves in ways the Fed does not intend.
CASE STUDY
Bank Failures and the Money Supply in the 1930s
Between August 1929 and March 1933, the money supply fell 28 percent. As 
we will discuss in Chapter 12, some economists believe that this large decline in 
the money supply was the primary cause of the Great Depression of the 1930s, 
when unemployment reached unprecedented levels, prices fell precipitously, and 
economic hardship was widepread. In light of this hypothesis, one is naturally 
drawn to ask why the money supply fell so dramatically.
The three variables that determine the money supply—the monetary base, the 
reserve–deposit ratio, and the currency–deposit ratio—are shown in Table 4–2 for 
1929 and 1933. You can see that the fall in the money supply cannot be attrib­
uted to a fall in the monetary base: in fact, the monetary base rose 18 percent 
over this period. Instead, the money supply fell because the money multiplier fell 
38 percent. The money multiplier fell because the currency–deposit and reserve–
deposit ratios both rose substantially.
Most economists attribute the fall in the money multiplier to the large number 
of bank failures in the early 1930s. From 1930 to 1933, more than 9,000 banks sus­
pended operations, often defaulting on their depositors. The bank failures caused 
the money supply to fall by altering the behavior of both depositors and bankers.
Bank failures raised the currency–deposit ratio by reducing public confidence 
in the banking system. People feared that bank failures would continue, and they

began to view currency as a more desirable form of money than demand depos­
its. When they withdrew their deposits, they drained the banks of reserves. The 
process of money creation reversed itself, as banks responded to lower reserves 
by reducing their outstanding balance of loans.
In addition, the bank failures raised the reserve–deposit ratio by making 
bankers more cautious. Having just observed many bank runs, bankers became 
apprehensive about operating with a small amount of reserves. They therefore 
increased their holdings of reserves to well above the legal minimum. Just as 
households responded to the banking crisis by holding more currency relative to 
deposits, bankers responded by holding more reserves relative to loans. Together 
these changes caused a large fall in the money multiplier.
Although it is easy to explain why the money supply fell, it is more difficult to 
decide whether to blame the Federal Reserve. One might argue that the mon­
etary base did not fall, so the Fed should not be blamed. Critics of Fed policy 
during this period make two counterarguments. First, they claim that the Fed 
should have taken a more vigorous role in preventing bank failures by acting as 
a lender of last resort when banks needed cash during bank runs. This would 
have helped maintain confidence in the banking system and prevented the large 
fall in the money multiplier. Second, they point out that the Fed could have 
responded to the fall in the money multiplier by increasing the monetary base 
even more than it did. Either of these actions would likely have prevented such 
a large fall in the money supply, which in turn might have reduced the severity 
of the Great Depression.
Since the 1930s, many policies have been put into place that make such a large 
and sudden fall in the money supply less likely today. Most important, the system 
of federal deposit insurance protects depositors when a bank fails. This policy is 
designed to maintain public confidence in the banking system and thus prevents 
large swings in the currency–deposit ratio. Deposit insurance has a cost: in the 
late 1980s and early 1990s, for example, the federal government incurred the large 
expense of bailing out many insolvent savings-and-loan institutions. Yet deposit 
insurance helps stabilize the banking system and the money supply. That is why, 
during the financial crisis of 2008–2009, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora­
tion raised the amount guaranteed from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. n
 4-4	 Conclusion
You should now understand what money is and how central banks affect its 
supply. Yet this accomplishment, valuable as it is, is only the first step toward 
understanding monetary policy. The next and more interesting step is to see how 
changes in the money supply influence the economy. We begin our study of that 
question in the next chapter. As we examine the effects of monetary policy, we 
move toward an appreciation of what central bankers can do to improve the 
functioning of the economy and, just as important, an appreciation of what they 
cannot do. But be forewarned: you will have to wait until the end of the book 
to see all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place.

Summary
	1.	Money is the stock of assets used for transactions. It serves as a store 
of value, a unit of account, and a medium of exchange. Different sorts 
of assets are used as money: commodity money systems use an asset 
with intrinsic value, whereas fiat money systems use an asset whose 
sole function is to serve as money. In modern economies, a central bank 
such as the Federal Reserve is responsible for controlling the supply 
of money.
	2.	The system of fractional–reserve banking creates money because each dollar 
of reserves generates many dollars of demand deposits.
	3.	To start a bank, the owners must contribute some of their own finan­
cial resources, which become the bank’s capital. Because banks are 
highly leveraged, however, a small decline in the value of their assets can 
potentially have a major impact on the value of bank capital. Bank regu­
lators require that banks hold sufficient capital to ensure that depositors 
can be repaid.
	4.	The supply of money depends on the monetary base, the reserve–deposit 
ratio, and the currency–deposit ratio. An increase in the monetary base leads 
to a proportionate increase in the money supply. A decrease in the reserve–
deposit ratio or in the currency–deposit ratio increases the money multi­
plier and thus the money supply.
	5.	The Federal Reserve influences the money supply either by changing the 
monetary base or by changing the reserve ratio and thereby the money 
multiplier. It can change the monetary base through open-market opera­
tions or by making loans to banks. It can influence the reserve ratio by 
altering reserve requirements or by changing the interest rate it pays banks 
for reserves they hold.

Inflation: Its Causes, Effects, and 
Social Costs
Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist 
System was to debauch the currency. . . . Lenin was certainly right. There 
is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than 
to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic 
law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in 
a million is able to diagnose.

n 1970 the New York Times cost 15 cents, the median price of a single-family 
home was $23,400, and the average wage for production workers was $3.39 
per hour. In 2014 the Times cost $2.50, the median price of a home was 
$265,700, and the average wage was $20.58 per hour. This overall increase in 
prices is called inflation, which is the subject of this chapter.
The rate of inflation—the percentage change in the overall level of prices—
varies greatly over time and across countries. In the United States, according to 
the consumer price index, prices rose at an average annual rate of 2.3 percent 
in the 1960s, 7.1 percent in the 1970s, 5.6 percent in the 1980s, 3.0 percent in 
the 1990s, and 2.4 percent from 2000 to 2014. Even when the U.S. inflation 
problem became severe during the 1970s, however, it was nothing compared to 
the episodes of extraordinarily high inflation, called hyperinflation, that other 
countries have experienced from time to time. A classic example is Germany 
in 1923, when prices increased an average of 500 percent per month. In 2008, 
a similar hyperinflation gripped the nation of Zimbabwe.
In this chapter we examine the classical theory of the causes, effects, and social 
costs of inflation. The theory is “classical” in the sense that it assumes that prices are 
flexible. As we first discussed in Chapter 1, most economists believe this assumption 
describes the behavior of the economy in the long run. By contrast, many prices are 
thought to be sticky in the short run, and beginning in Chapter 10 we incorporate 
this fact into our analysis. For now, we ignore short-run price stickiness. As we will 
see, the classical theory of inflation not only provides a good description of the long 
run, it also provides a useful foundation for the short-run analysis we develop later.

The “hidden forces of economic law” that lead to inflation are not as mysteri­
ous as Keynes claims in the quotation that opens this chapter. Inflation is simply 
an increase in the average level of prices, and a price is the rate at which money 
is exchanged for a good or a service. To understand inflation, therefore, we must 
understand money—what it is, what affects its supply and demand, and what 
influence it has on the economy. In the previous chapter, we introduced the 
economist’s concept of “money” and discussed how, in most modern econo­
mies, a central bank set up by the government controls the quantity of money 
in the hands of the public. This chapter begins in Section 5-1 by showing that 
the quantity of money determines the price level and that the rate of growth in 
the quantity of money determines the rate of inflation.
Inflation in turn has numerous effects of its own on the economy. Section 5-2 
discusses the revenue that governments can raise by printing money, sometimes 
called the inflation tax. Section 5-3 examines how inflation affects the nominal 
interest rate. Section 5-4 discusses how the nominal interest rate in turn affects 
the quantity of money people wish to hold and, thereby, the price level.
After completing our analysis of the causes and effects of inflation, in 
Section 5-5 we address what is perhaps the most important question about 
inflation: Is it a major social problem? Does inflation amount to “overturning 
the existing basis of society,” as the chapter’s opening quotation suggests?
Finally, in Section 5-6, we discuss the dramatic case of hyperinflation. Hyper­
inflations are interesting to examine because they show clearly the causes, effects, 
and costs of inflation. Just as seismologists learn much about plate tectonics by 
studying earthquakes, economists learn much about money and prices by study­
ing how hyperinflations begin and end.
 5-1   The Quantity Theory of Money
In Chapter 4 we defined what money is and learned that the quantity of money 
available in the economy is called the money supply. We also saw how the money 
supply is determined by the banking system together with the policy decisions of 
the central bank. With that foundation, we can now start to examine the broad 
macroeconomic effects of monetary policy. To do this, we need a theory that 
tells us how the quantity of money is related to other economic variables, such 
as prices and incomes. The theory we develop in this section, called the quantity 
theory of money, has its roots in the work of the early monetary theorists, including 
the philosopher and economist David Hume (1711–1776). It remains the leading 
explanation for how money affects the economy in the long run.
Transactions and the Quantity Equation
If you hear an economist use the word “supply,” you can be sure that the word 
“demand” is not far behind. Indeed, having fully explored the supply of money, 
we now focus on the demand for it.

C H A P T E R  5   Inflation: Its Causes, Effects, and Social Costs  | 107
The starting point of the quantity theory of money is the insight that people 
hold money to buy goods and services. The more money they need for such 
transactions, the more money they hold. Thus, the quantity of money in the 
economy is related to the number of dollars exchanged in transactions.
The link between transactions and money is expressed in the following 
equation, called the quantity equation:
Money 3 Velocity 5 Price 3 Transactions
	
M	
3	
V	
5 P	
3	
T.
Let’s examine each of the four variables in this equation.
The right-hand side of the quantity equation tells us about transactions. 
T represents the total number of transactions during some period of time, 
say, a year. In other words, T is the number of times in a year that goods or 
services are exchanged for money. P is the price of a typical transaction—the 
number of dollars exchanged. The product of the price of a transaction and 
the number of transactions, PT, equals the number of dollars exchanged in 
a year.
The left-hand side of the quantity equation tells us about the money used to 
make the transactions. M is the quantity of money. V, called the transactions 
velocity of money, measures the rate at which money circulates in the econ­
omy. In other words, velocity tells us the number of times a dollar bill changes 
hands in a given period of time.
For example, suppose that 60 loaves of bread are sold in a given year at $0.50 
per loaf. Then T equals 60 loaves per year, and P equals $0.50 per loaf. The total 
number of dollars exchanged is
PT 5 $0.50/loaf 3 60 loaves/year 5 $30/year.
The right-hand side of the quantity equation equals $30 per year, the dollar value 
of all transactions.
Suppose further that the quantity of money in the economy is $10. By rear­
ranging the quantity equation, we can compute velocity as
V 5 PT/M
5 ($30/year)/($10)
5 3 times per year.
That is, for $30 of transactions per year to take place with $10 of money, each 
dollar must change hands three times per year.
The quantity equation is an identity: the definitions of the four variables 
make it true. This type of equation is useful because it shows that if one of the 
variables changes, one or more of the others must also change to maintain the 
equality. For example, if the quantity of money increases and the velocity of 
money remains unchanged, then either the price or the number of transactions 
must rise.

108 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
From Transactions to Income
When studying the role of money in the economy, economists usually use a 
slightly different version of the quantity equation than the one just introduced. 
The problem with the first equation is that the number of transactions is difficult 
to measure. To solve this problem, the number of transactions T is replaced by 
the total output of the economy Y.
Transactions and output are related because the more the economy produces, 
the more goods are bought and sold. They are not the same, however. When 
one person sells a used car to another person, for example, they make a trans­
action using money, even though the used car is not part of current output. 
Nonetheless, the dollar value of transactions is roughly proportional to the dollar 
value of output.
If Y denotes the amount of output and P denotes the price of one unit of 
output, then the dollar value of output is PY. We encountered measures for 
these variables when we discussed the national income accounts in Chapter 2: Y 
is real GDP; P, the GDP deflator; and PY, nominal GDP. The quantity equation 
becomes
Money 3 Velocity 5 Price 3 Output
	
M	
3 
V	
5	 P	 3	
Y.
Because Y is also total income, V in this version of the quantity equation is called 
the income velocity of money. The income velocity of money tells us the 
number of times a dollar bill enters someone’s income in a given period of time. 
This version of the quantity equation is the most common, and it is the one we 
use from now on.
The Money Demand Function and the 
Quantity Equation
When we analyze how money affects the economy, it is often useful to express 
the quantity of money in terms of the quantity of goods and services it can buy. 
This amount, M/P, is called real money balances.
Real money balances measure the purchasing power of the stock of money. 
For example, consider an economy that produces only bread. If the quantity of 
money is $10, and the price of a loaf is $0.50, then real money balances are 20 
loaves of bread. That is, at current prices, the stock of money in the economy 
is able to buy 20 loaves.
A money demand function is an equation that shows the determinants 
of the quantity of real money balances people wish to hold. A simple money 
demand function is
(M/P )d 5 kY,
where k is a constant that tells us how much money people want to hold for 
every dollar of income. This equation states that the quantity of real money 
balances demanded is proportional to real income.

C H A P T E R  5   Inflation: Its Causes, Effects, and Social Costs  | 109
The money demand function is like the demand function for a particular 
good. Here the “good” is the convenience of holding real money balances. Just 
as owning an automobile makes it easier for a person to travel, holding money 
makes it easier to make transactions. Therefore, just as higher income leads to a 
greater demand for automobiles, higher income also leads to a greater demand 
for real money balances.
This money demand function offers another way to view the quantity equa­
tion. To see this, add to the money demand function the condition that the 
demand for real money balances (M/P )d must equal the supply M/P. Therefore,
M/P 5 kY.
A simple rearrangement of terms changes this equation into
M(1/k) 5 PY,
which can be written as
MV 5 PY,
where V 5 1/k. These few steps of simple mathematics show the link between 
the demand for money and the velocity of money. When people want to hold 
a lot of money for each dollar of income (k is large), money changes hands 
infrequently (V is small). Conversely, when people want to hold only a little 
money (k is small), money changes hands frequently (V is large). In other words, 
the money demand parameter k and the velocity of money V are opposite sides 
of the same coin.
The Assumption of Constant Velocity
The quantity equation can be viewed as a definition: it defines velocity V as 
the ratio of nominal GDP, PY, to the quantity of money M. Yet if we make the 
additional assumption that the velocity of money is constant, then the quan­
tity equation becomes a useful theory about the effects of money, called the 
quantity theory of money.
Like many of the assumptions in economics, the assumption of constant 
velocity is only a simplification of reality. Velocity does change if the money 
demand function changes. For example, when automatic teller machines were 
introduced, people could reduce their average money holdings, which meant a 
fall in the money demand parameter k and an increase in velocity V. Nonethe­
less, experience shows that the assumption of constant velocity is a useful one 
in many situations. Let’s therefore assume that velocity is constant and see what 
this assumption implies about the effects of the money supply on the economy.
With this assumption included, the quantity equation can be seen as a theory 
of what determines nominal GDP. The quantity equation says
MV– 5 PY,
where the bar over V means that velocity is fixed. Therefore, a change in the 
quantity of money (M ) must cause a proportionate change in nominal GDP (PY ). 

110 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
That is, if velocity is fixed, the quantity of money determines the dollar value of 
the economy’s output.
Money, Prices, and Inflation
We now have a theory to explain what determines the economy’s overall level 
of prices. The theory has three building blocks:
	 1.	The factors of production and the production function determine the level 
of output Y. We borrow this conclusion from Chapter 3.
	 2.	The money supply M set by the central bank determines the nominal value 
of output PY. This conclusion follows from the quantity equation and the 
assumption that the velocity of money is fixed.
	 3.	The price level P is then the ratio of the nominal value of output PY to the 
level of output Y.
In other words, the productive capability of the economy determines real GDP, 
the quantity of money determines nominal GDP, and the GDP deflator is the 
ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP.
This theory explains what happens when the central bank changes the supply 
of money. Because velocity V is fixed, any change in the money supply M must 
lead to a proportionate change in the nominal value of output PY. Because 
the factors of production and the production function have already determined 
output Y, the nominal value of output PY can adjust only if the price level 
P changes. Hence, the quantity theory implies that the price level is proportional 
to the money supply.
Because the inflation rate is the percentage change in the price level, this 
theory of the price level is also a theory of the inflation rate. The quantity equa­
tion, written in percentage-change form, is
% Change in M 1 % Change in V 5 % Change in P 1 % Change in Y.
Consider each of these four terms. First, the percentage change in the quantity 
of money M is under the control of the central bank. Second, the percent­
age change in velocity V reflects shifts in money demand; we have assumed 
that velocity is constant, so the percentage change in velocity is zero. Third, 
the percentage change in the price level P is the rate of inflation; this is the 
variable in the equation that we would like to explain. Fourth, the percentage 
change in output Y depends on growth in the factors of production and on 
technological progress, which for our present purposes we are taking as given. 
This analysis tells us that (except for a constant that depends on exogenous 
growth in output) the growth in the money supply determines the rate of 
inflation.
Thus, the quantity theory of money states that the central bank, which controls the 
money supply, has ultimate control over the rate of inflation. If the central bank keeps the 
money supply stable, the price level will be stable. If the central bank increases the money 
supply rapidly, the price level will rise rapidly.

Inflation and Money Growth
“Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.” So wrote Milton 
Friedman, the great economist who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1976. 
The quantity theory of money leads us to agree that the growth in the quantity 
of money is the primary determinant of the inflation rate. Yet Friedman’s claim 
is empirical, not theoretical. To evaluate his claim, and to judge the usefulness 
of our theory, we need to look at data on money and prices.
Friedman, together with fellow economist Anna Schwartz, wrote two treatises 
on monetary history that documented the sources and effects of changes in the 
quantity of money over the past century.1 Figure 5-1 uses some of their data and

plots the average rate of money growth and the average rate of inflation in the 
United States over each decade since the 1870s. The data verify the link between 
inflation and growth in the quantity of money. Decades with high money growth 
(such as the 1970s) tend to have high inflation, and decades with low money 
growth (such as the 1930s) tend to have low inflation.
As you may have learned in a statistics class, one way to quantify a relationship 
between two variables is with a measure called correlation. A correlation is 11 if 
the two variables move exactly in tandem, 0 if they are unrelated, and 21 if they 
move exactly opposite each other. In Figure 5-1, the correlation is 0.79.
Figure 5-2 examines the same question using international data. It shows the 
average rate of inflation and the average rate of money growth in 126 countries 
during the period from 2000 to 2013. Again, the link between money growth 
and inflation is clear. Countries with high money growth (such as Angola and 
Belarus) tend to have high inflation, and countries with low money growth (such as 
­Singapore and Switzerland) tend to have low inflation. The correlation here is 0.72.
If we looked at monthly data on money growth and inflation, rather than data 
for decade-long periods, we would not see as close a connection between these 
two variables. This theory of inflation works best in the long run, not in the 
short run. We examine the short-run impact of changes in the quantity of money 
when we turn to economic fluctuations in Part Four of this book. n

 5-2   Seigniorage: The Revenue from 
Printing Money
So far, we have seen how growth in the money supply causes inflation. With 
inflation as a consequence, what would ever induce a central bank to increase 
the money supply substantially? Here we examine one answer to this question.
Let’s start with an indisputable fact: all governments spend money. Some of 
this spending is to buy goods and services (such as roads and police), and some is 
to provide transfer payments (for the poor and elderly, for example). A govern­
ment can finance its spending in three ways. First, it can raise revenue through 
taxes, such as personal and corporate income taxes. Second, it can borrow from 
the public by selling government bonds. Third, it can print money.
The revenue raised by the printing of money is called seigniorage. The term 
comes from seigneur, the French word for “feudal lord.” In the Middle Ages, 
the lord had the exclusive right on his manor to coin money. Today this right 
belongs to the central government, and it is one source of revenue.
When the government prints money to finance expenditure, it increases 
the money supply. The increase in the money supply, in turn, causes inflation. 
Printing money to raise revenue is like imposing an inflation tax.
At first it may not be obvious that inflation can be viewed as a tax. After all, 
no one receives a bill for this tax—the government merely prints the money it 
needs. Who, then, pays the inflation tax? The answer is the holders of money. 
As prices rise, the real value of the money in your wallet falls. Therefore, when 
the government prints new money for its use, it makes the old money in the 
hands of the public less valuable. Inflation is like a tax on holding money.
The amount of revenue raised by printing money varies from country to 
country. In the United States, the amount has been small: seigniorage has usually 
accounted for less than 3 percent of government revenue. In Italy and Greece, 
seigniorage has often been more than 10 percent of government revenue.2 
In countries experiencing hyperinflation, seigniorage is often the government’s 
chief source of revenue—indeed, the need to print money to finance expendi­
ture is a primary cause of hyperinflation.
Paying for the American Revolution
Although seigniorage has not been a major source of revenue for the U.S. gov­
ernment in recent history, the situation was very different two and a half cen­
turies ago. Beginning in 1775, the Continental Congress needed to find a way 
to finance the Revolution, but it had limited ability to raise revenue through 
taxation. It therefore relied on the printing of fiat money to help pay for the war.
The Continental Congress’s reliance on seigniorage increased over time. 
New issues of continental currency were about $6 million in 1775, $19 million

 5-3   Inflation and Interest Rates
As we first discussed in Chapter 3, interest rates are among the most important 
macroeconomic variables. In essence, they are the prices that link the present and 
the future. Here we discuss the relationship between inflation and interest rates.
Two Interest Rates: Real and Nominal
Suppose you deposit your savings in a bank account that pays 8 percent interest 
annually. Next year, you withdraw your savings and the accumulated interest. 
Are you 8 percent richer than you were when you made the deposit a year 
earlier?
The answer depends on what “richer” means. Certainly, you have 8 percent 
more dollars than you had before. But if prices have risen, each dollar buys less, 
and your purchasing power has not risen by 8 percent. If the inflation rate was 
5 percent over the year, then the amount of goods you can buy has increased by 
only 3 percent. And if the inflation rate was 10 percent, then your purchasing 
power has fallen by 2 percent.
The interest rate that the bank pays is called the nominal interest rate, 
and the increase in your purchasing power is called the real interest rate. If i 
denotes the nominal interest rate, r the real interest rate, and p the rate of infla­
tion, then the relationship among these three variables can be written as
r 5 i 2 p.
The real interest rate is the difference between the nominal interest rate and the 
rate of inflation.3
3Mathematical note: This equation relating the real interest rate, nominal interest rate, and inflation 
rate is only an approximation. The exact formula is (1 1 r) 5 (1 1 i)/(1 1 p). The approximation 
in the text is reasonably accurate as long as r, i, and p are relatively small (say, less than 20 percent 
per year).
in 1776, and $13 million in 1777. This amount increased to $63 million in 1778 
and $125 million in 1779.
Not surprisingly, this rapid growth in the money supply led to massive inflation. 
At the end of the war, the price of gold measured in continental dollars was more 
than 100 times its level of only a few years earlier. The large quantity of the con­
tinental currency made the continental dollar nearly worthless. This experience 
also gave birth to a once-popular expression: people used to say something was 
“not worth a continental” to mean that the item had little real value.
When the new nation won its independence, there was a natural skepti­
cism about fiat money. Upon the recommendation of the first secretary of the 
Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, Congress passed the Mint Act of 1792, which 
established gold and silver as the basis for a new system of commodity money. n

C H A P T E R  5   Inflation: Its Causes, Effects, and Social Costs  | 115
The Fisher Effect
Rearranging terms in our equation for the real interest rate, we can show that 
the nominal interest rate is the sum of the real interest rate and the inflation rate:
i 5 r 1 p.
The equation written in this way is called the Fisher equation, after economist 
Irving Fisher (1867–1947). It shows that the nominal interest rate can change 
for two reasons: because the real interest rate changes or because the inflation 
rate changes.
Once we separate the nominal interest rate into these two parts, we can 
use this equation to develop a theory that explains the nominal interest rate. 
Chapter 3 showed that the real interest rate adjusts to equilibrate saving and 
investment. The quantity theory of money shows that the rate of money 
growth determines the rate of inflation. The Fisher equation then tells us to add 
the real interest rate and the inflation rate together to determine the nominal 
interest rate.
The quantity theory and the Fisher equation together tell us how money 
growth affects the nominal interest rate. According to the quantity theory, an 
increase in the rate of money growth of 1 percent causes a 1 percent increase in the rate 
of inflation. According to the Fisher equation, a 1 percent increase in the rate of infla­
tion in turn causes a 1 percent increase in the nominal interest rate. The one-for-one 
relation between the inflation rate and the nominal interest rate is called the 
Fisher effect.
Inflation and Nominal Interest Rates
How useful is the Fisher effect in explaining interest rates? To answer this ques­
tion, we look at two types of data on inflation and nominal interest rates.
Figure 5-3 shows the variation over time in the nominal interest rate and 
the inflation rate in the United States from 1954 to 2013. You can see that the 
Fisher effect has done a good job of explaining fluctuations in the nominal 
interest rate during this period. When inflation is high, nominal interest rates 
are typically high, and when inflation is low, nominal interest rates are typically 
low as well. The correlation between the inflation rate and the nominal interest 
rate is 0.75.
Similar support for the Fisher effect comes from examining the varia­
tion across countries. As Figure 5-4 shows, a nation’s inflation rate and its 
nominal interest rate are related. Countries with high inflation tend to have 
high nominal interest rates as well, and countries with low inflation tend to 
have low nominal interest rates. The correlation between these two variables 
is 0.66.
The link between inflation and nominal interest rates is well known to 
Wall Street investment firms. Because bond prices move inversely with 
interest rates, one can get rich by correctly predicting the direction in

Two Real Interest Rates: Ex Ante and Ex Post
When a borrower and lender agree on a nominal interest rate, they do not know 
what the inflation rate over the term of the loan will be. Therefore, we must distin­
guish between two concepts of the real interest rate: the real interest rate that the bor­
rower and lender expect when the loan is made, called the ex ante real interest rate, 
and the real interest rate that is actually realized, called the ex post real interest rate.
Although borrowers and lenders cannot predict future inflation with certainty, 
they do have some expectation about what the inflation rate will be. Let p denote 
actual future inflation and Ep denote expected future inflation. The ex ante real 
interest rate is i 2 Ep, and the ex post real interest rate is i 2 p. The two real 
interest rates differ when actual inflation p differs from expected inflation Ep.
How does this distinction between actual and expected inflation modify the 
Fisher effect? Clearly, the nominal interest rate cannot adjust to actual inflation, 
because actual inflation is not known when the nominal interest rate is set. The 
nominal interest rate can adjust only to expected inflation. The Fisher effect is 
more precisely written as
i 5 r 1 Ep.
The ex ante real interest rate r is determined by equilibrium in the market for 
goods and services, as described by the model in Chapter 3. The nominal interest 
rate i moves one-to-one with changes in expected inflation Ep.
which interest rates will move. Many Wall Street firms hire Fed watchers to 
monitor monetary policy and news about inflation to anticipate changes in 
interest rates. n
Nominal Interest Rates in the Nineteenth Century
Although recent data show a positive relationship between nominal interest rates 
and inflation rates, this finding is not universal. In data from the late nineteenth 
and early twentieth centuries, high nominal interest rates did not accompany 
high inflation. The apparent absence of any Fisher effect during this time puzzled 
Irving Fisher. He suggested that inflation “caught merchants napping.”
How should we interpret the absence of an apparent Fisher effect in 
nineteenth-century data? Does this period of history provide evidence against 
the adjustment of nominal interest rates to inflation? Recent research suggests 
that this period has little to tell us about the validity of the Fisher effect. The 
reason is that the Fisher effect relates the nominal interest rate to expected infla­
tion and, according to this research, inflation at this time was largely unexpected.
Although expectations are not easily observable, we can draw inferences about 
them by examining the persistence of inflation. In recent experience, inflation 
has been very persistent: when it is high one year, it tends to be high the next 
year as well. Therefore, when people have observed high inflation, it has been 
rational for them to expect high inflation in the future. By contrast, during

 5-4   The Nominal Interest Rate and the 
Demand for Money
The quantity theory is based on a simple money demand function: it assumes 
that the demand for real money balances is proportional to income. The quan­
tity theory is a good place to start when analyzing the effects of money on the 
economy, but it is not the whole story. Here we add another determinant of the 
quantity of money demanded—the nominal interest rate.
The Cost of Holding Money
The money you hold in your wallet does not earn interest. If, instead of holding 
that money, you used it to buy government bonds or deposited it in a savings 
account, you would earn the nominal interest rate. Therefore, the nominal 
interest rate is the opportunity cost of holding money: it is what you give up by 
holding money rather than bonds.
Another way to see that the cost of holding money equals the nominal inter­
est rate is by comparing the real returns on alternative assets. Assets other than 
money, such as government bonds, earn the real return r. Money earns an expect­
ed real return of 2Ep, because its real value declines at the rate of inflation. 
When you hold money, you give up the difference between these two returns. 
Thus, the cost of holding money is r 2 (2Ep), which the Fisher equation tells 
us is the nominal interest rate i.
Just as the quantity of bread demanded depends on the price of bread, the 
quantity of money demanded depends on the price of holding money. Hence, 
the demand for real money balances depends both on the level of income and 
on the nominal interest rate. We write the general money demand function as
(M/P )d 5 L (i, Y ).
The letter L is used to denote money demand because money is the economy’s 
most liquid asset (the asset most easily used to make transactions). This equation 
states that the demand for the liquidity of real money balances is a function of 
income and the nominal interest rate. The higher the level of income Y, the 
greater the demand for real money balances. The higher the nominal interest 
rate i, the lower the demand for real money balances.
the nineteenth century, when the gold standard was in effect, inflation had 
little persistence. High inflation in one year was just as likely to be followed the 
next year by low inflation as by high inflation. Therefore, high inflation did not 
imply high expected inflation and did not lead to high nominal interest rates. So, 
in a sense, Fisher was right to say that inflation “caught merchants napping.”4 n

Future Money and Current Prices
Money, prices, and interest rates are now related in several ways. Figure 5-5 
illustrates the linkages we have discussed. As the quantity theory of money 
explains, money supply and money demand together determine the equilibrium 
price level. Changes in the price level are, by definition, the rate of inflation. 
Inflation, in turn, affects the nominal interest rate through the Fisher effect. But 
now, because the nominal interest rate is the cost of holding money, the nomi­
nal interest rate feeds back to affect the demand for money.
Consider how the introduction of this last link affects our theory of the price 
level. First, equate the supply of real money balances M/P to the demand L(i, Y ):
M/P 5 L (i, Y ).
Next, use the Fisher equation to write the nominal interest rate as the sum of 
the real interest rate and expected inflation:
M/P 5 L (r 1 Ep, Y ).
This equation states that the level of real money balances depends on the 
expected rate of inflation.
The last equation tells a more sophisticated story about the determination of 
the price level than does the quantity theory. The quantity theory of money 
says that today’s money supply determines today’s price level. This conclusion 
remains partly true: if the nominal interest rate and the level of output are held 
constant, the price level moves proportionately with the money supply. Yet the 
nominal interest rate is not constant; it depends on expected inflation, which 
in turn depends on growth in the money supply. The presence of the nominal

The Linkages Among Money, Prices, and Interest Rates  This figure illustrates the relationships 
among money, prices, and interest rates. Money supply and money demand determine the price 
level. Changes in the price level determine the inflation rate. The inflation rate influences the nomi­
nal interest rate. Because the nominal interest rate is the cost of holding money, it may affect money 
demand. This last link (shown as a blue line) is omitted from the basic quantity theory of money.

120 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
interest rate in the money demand function yields an additional channel through 
which money supply affects the price level.
This general money demand equation implies that the price level depends 
not only on today’s money supply but also on the money supply expected in 
the future. To see why, suppose the Fed announces that it will increase the 
money supply in the future, but it does not change the money supply today. 
This announcement causes people to expect higher money growth and higher 
inflation. Through the Fisher effect, this increase in expected inflation raises the 
nominal interest rate. The higher nominal interest rate increases the cost of hold­
ing money and therefore reduces the demand for real money balances. Because 
the Fed has not changed the quantity of money available today, the reduced 
demand for real money balances leads to a higher price level. Hence, expecta­
tions of higher money growth in the future lead to a higher price level today.
The effect of money on prices is complex. The appendix to this chapter pres­
ents the Cagan model, which shows how the price level is related to current and 
expected future monetary policy. In particular, the analysis concludes that the 
price level depends on a weighted average of the current money supply and the 
money supply expected to prevail in the future.
 5-5  The Social Costs of Inflation
Our discussion of the causes and effects of inflation does not tell us much about 
the social problems that result from inflation. We turn to those problems now.
The Layman’s View and the Classical Response
If you ask the average person why inflation is a social problem, she will prob­
ably answer that inflation makes her poorer. “Each year my boss gives me a raise, 
but prices go up and that takes some of my raise away from me.” The implicit 
assumption in this statement is that if there were no inflation, she would get the 
same raise and be able to buy more goods.
This complaint about inflation is a common fallacy. As we know from Chapter 
3, the purchasing power of labor—the real wage—depends on the marginal pro­
ductivity of labor, not on how much money the government chooses to print. If 
the central bank reduces inflation by slowing the rate of money growth, workers 
will not see their real wages increasing more rapidly. Instead, when inflation slows, 
firms will increase the prices of their products less each year and, as a result, will 
give their workers smaller raises.
According to the classical theory of money, a change in the overall price level is 
like a change in the units of measurement. It is as if we switched from measuring 
distances in feet to measuring them in inches: numbers get larger, but nothing ­really 
changes. Imagine that tomorrow morning you wake up and find that, for some 
reason, all dollar figures in the economy have been multiplied by ten. The price 
of everything you buy has increased tenfold, but so have your wage and the value 
of your savings. What difference would such a price increase make to your life? 

C H A P T E R  5   Inflation: Its Causes, Effects, and Social Costs  | 121
All numbers would have an extra zero at the end, but nothing else would change. 
Your economic well-being depends on relative prices, not the overall price level.
Why, then, is a persistent increase in the price level a social problem? It turns 
out that the costs of inflation are subtle. Indeed, economists disagree about the 
size of the social costs. To the surprise of many laymen, some economists argue 
that the costs of inflation are small—at least for the moderate rates of inflation 
that most countries have experienced in recent years.5

Society (Reading, MA: Addison Wesley, 1987).
6Robert J. Shiller, “Why Do People Dislike Inflation?” in Reducing Inflation: Motivation and Strategy, edited 
by Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997), 13–65.
What Economists and the Public Say 
About Inflation
As we have been discussing, laymen and economists hold very different views 
about the costs of inflation. In 1996, economist (and 2013 Nobel Prize winner) 
Robert Shiller documented this difference of opinion in a survey of the two 
groups. The survey results are striking, for they show how the study of economics 
changes a person’s attitudes.
In one question, Shiller asked people whether their “biggest gripe about inflation” 
was that “inflation hurts my real buying power; it makes me poorer.” Of the general 
public, 77 percent agreed with this statement, compared to only 12 percent of econo­
mists. Shiller also asked people whether they agreed with the following statement: 
“When I see projections about how many times more a college education will cost, 
or how many times more the cost of living will be in coming decades, I feel a sense of 
uneasiness; these inflation projections really make me worry that my own income will 
not rise as much as such costs will.” Among the general public, 66 percent said they 
fully agreed with this statement, whereas only 5 percent of economists agreed with it.
Survey respondents were asked to judge the seriousness of inflation as a policy 
problem: “Do you agree that preventing high inflation is an important national 
priority, as important as preventing drug abuse or preventing deterioration in 
the quality of our schools?” Shiller found that 52 percent of laymen, but only 18 
percent of economists, fully agreed with this view. Apparently, inflation worries 
the public much more than it does the economics profession.
The public’s distaste for inflation may be psychological. Shiller asked those 
surveyed if they agreed with the following statement: “I think that if my pay 
went up I would feel more satisfaction in my job, more sense of fulfillment, even 
if prices went up just as much.” Of the public, 49 percent fully or partly agreed 
with this statement, compared to 8 percent of economists.
Do these survey results mean that laymen are wrong and economists are right 
about the costs of inflation? Not necessarily. But economists do have the advan­
tage of having given the issue more thought. So let’s now consider what some of 
the costs of inflation might be.6 n
CASE STUDY

122 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
The Costs of Expected Inflation
Consider first the case of expected inflation. Suppose that every month the price 
level rose by 1/2 percent. What would be the social costs of such a steady and 
predictable 6 percent annual inflation?
One cost is the distorting effect of the inflation tax on the amount of 
money people hold. As we have already discussed, a higher inflation rate leads 
to a higher nominal interest rate, which in turn leads to lower real money 
balances. If people hold lower money balances on average, they must make 
more frequent trips to the bank to withdraw money—for example, they might 
withdraw $50 twice a week rather than $100 once a week. The inconvenience 
of reducing money holding is metaphorically called the shoeleather cost of 
inflation, because walking to the bank more often causes one’s shoes to wear 
out more quickly.
A second cost of inflation arises because high inflation induces firms to 
change their posted prices more often. Changing prices is sometimes costly; 
for example, it may require printing and distributing a new catalog. These costs 
are called menu costs, because the higher the rate of inflation, the more often 
restaurants have to print new menus.
A third cost of inflation arises because firms facing menu costs change prices 
infrequently; therefore, the higher the rate of inflation, the greater the variability 
in relative prices. For example, suppose a firm issues a new catalog every January. 
If there is no inflation, then the firm’s prices relative to the overall price level 
are constant over the year. Yet if inflation is 1/2 percent per month, then from 
the beginning to the end of the year the firm’s relative prices fall by 6 percent. 
Sales from this catalog will tend to be low early in the year (when its prices are 
relatively high) and high later in the year (when its prices are relatively low). 
Hence, when inflation induces variability in relative prices, it leads to microeco­
nomic inefficiencies in the allocation of resources.
A fourth cost of inflation results from the tax laws. Many provisions of the 
tax code do not take into account the effects of inflation. Inflation can alter 
individuals’ tax liability, often in ways that lawmakers did not intend.
One example of the failure of the tax code to deal with inflation is the tax 
treatment of capital gains. Suppose you buy some stock today and sell it a year 
from now at the same real price. It would seem reasonable for the government 
not to levy a tax, because you have earned no real income from this investment. 
Indeed, if there is no inflation, a zero tax liability would be the outcome. But 
suppose the rate of inflation is 6 percent and you initially paid $100 per share for 
the stock; for the real price to be the same a year later, you must sell the stock 
for $106 per share. In this case the tax code, which ignores the effects of inflation, 
says that you have earned $6 per share in income, and the government taxes you 
on this capital gain. The problem is that the tax code measures income as the 
nominal rather than the real capital gain. In this example, and in many others, 
inflation distorts how taxes are levied.
A fifth cost of inflation is the inconvenience of living in a world with a 
changing price level. Money is the yardstick with which we measure eco­
nomic transactions. When there is inflation, that yardstick is changing in length. 

C H A P T E R  5   Inflation: Its Causes, Effects, and Social Costs  | 123
To continue the analogy, suppose that Congress passed a law specifying that 
a yard would equal 36 inches in 2016, 35 inches in 2017, 34 inches in 2018, 
and so on. Although the law would result in no ambiguity, it would be highly 
inconvenient. When someone measured a distance in yards, it would be necessary 
to specify whether the measurement was in 2016 yards or 2017 yards; to compare 
distances measured in different years, one would need to make an “inflation” 
correction. Similarly, the dollar is a less useful measure when its value is always 
changing. The changing value of the dollar requires that we correct for inflation 
when comparing dollar figures from different times.
For example, a changing price level complicates personal financial planning. 
One important decision that all households face is how much of their income 
to consume today and how much to save for retirement. A dollar saved today 
and invested at a fixed nominal interest rate will yield a fixed dollar amount in 
the future. Yet the real value of that dollar amount—which will determine the 
retiree’s living standard—depends on the future price level. Deciding how much 
to save would be much simpler if people could count on the price level in 
30 years being similar to its level today.
The Costs of Unexpected Inflation
Unexpected inflation has an effect that is more pernicious than any of the costs 
of steady, anticipated inflation: it arbitrarily redistributes wealth among indi­
viduals. You can see how this works by examining long-term loans. Most loan 
agreements specify a nominal interest rate, which is based on the rate of inflation 
expected at the time of the agreement. If inflation turns out differently from 
what was expected, the ex post real return that the debtor pays to the creditor 
differs from what both parties anticipated. On the one hand, if inflation turns 
out to be higher than expected, the debtor wins and the creditor loses because 
the debtor repays the loan with less valuable dollars. On the other hand, if infla­
tion turns out to be lower than expected, the creditor wins and the debtor loses 
because the repayment is worth more than the two parties anticipated.
Consider, for example, a person taking out a mortgage in 1960. At the time, a 
30-year mortgage had an interest rate of about 6 percent per year. This rate was 
based on a low rate of expected inflation—inflation over the previous decade 
had averaged only 2.5 percent. The creditor probably expected to receive a real 
return of about 3.5 percent, and the debtor expected to pay this real return. In 
fact, over the life of the mortgage, the inflation rate averaged 5 percent, so the 
ex post real return was only 1 percent. This unanticipated inflation benefited the 
debtor at the expense of the creditor.
Unanticipated inflation also hurts individuals on fixed pensions. Workers and 
firms often agree on a fixed nominal pension when the worker retires (or even 
earlier). Because the pension is deferred earnings, the worker is essentially pro­
viding the firm a loan: the worker provides labor services to the firm while 
young but does not get fully paid until old age. Like any creditor, the worker is 
hurt when inflation is higher than anticipated. Like any debtor, the firm is hurt 
when inflation is lower than anticipated.

124 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
These situations provide a clear argument against variable inflation. The more 
variable the rate of inflation, the greater the uncertainty that both debtors and 
creditors face. Because most people are risk averse—they dislike uncertainty—the 
unpredictability caused by highly variable inflation hurts almost everyone.
Given these effects of uncertain inflation, it is puzzling that nominal contracts 
are so prevalent. One might expect debtors and creditors to protect themselves 
from this uncertainty by writing contracts in real terms—that is, by indexing to 
some measure of the price level. In economies with high and variable inflation, 
indexation is often widespread; sometimes this indexation takes the form of 
writing contracts using a more stable foreign currency. In economies with mod­
erate inflation, such as the United States, indexation is less common. Yet even in 
the United States, some long-term obligations are indexed. For example, Social 
Security benefits for the elderly are adjusted annually in response to changes in 
the consumer price index. And in 1997, the U.S. federal government issued 
inflation-indexed bonds for the first time.
Finally, in thinking about the costs of inflation, it is important to note a 
widely documented but little understood fact: high inflation is variable infla­
tion. That is, countries with high average inflation also tend to have inflation 
rates that change greatly from year to year. The implication is that if a country 
decides to pursue a high-inflation monetary policy, it will likely have to accept 
highly variable inflation as well. As we have just discussed, highly variable infla­
tion increases uncertainty for both creditors and debtors by subjecting them to 
arbitrary and potentially large redistributions of wealth.
The Free Silver Movement, the Election of 1896, 
and The Wizard of Oz
The redistributions of wealth caused by unexpected changes in the price level 
are often a source of political turmoil, as evidenced by the Free Silver move­
ment in the late nineteenth century. From 1880 to 1896 the price level in the 
United States fell 23 percent. This deflation was good for creditors, primarily 
the bankers of the Northeast, but it was bad for debtors, primarily the farmers 
of the South and West. One proposed solution to this problem was to replace 
the gold standard with a bimetallic standard, under which both gold and silver 
could be minted into coin. The move to a bimetallic standard would increase the 
money supply and stop the deflation.
The silver issue dominated the presidential election of 1896. William McKinley, 
the Republican nominee, campaigned on a platform of preserving the gold stan­
dard. William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic nominee, supported the bimetallic 
standard. In a famous speech, Bryan proclaimed, “You shall not press down upon 
the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a 
cross of gold.” Not surprisingly, McKinley was the candidate of the conserva­
tive eastern establishment, whereas Bryan was the candidate of the southern and 
western populists.

One Benefit of Inflation
So far, we have discussed the many costs of inflation. These costs lead many 
economists to conclude that monetary policymakers should aim for zero infla­
tion. Yet there is another side to the story. Some economists believe that a little 
bit of inflation—say, 2 or 3 percent per year—can be a good thing.
The argument for moderate inflation starts with the observation that cuts in 
nominal wages are rare: firms are reluctant to cut their workers’ nominal wages, 
and workers are reluctant to accept such cuts. A 2 percent wage cut in a zero-
inflation world is, in real terms, the same as a 3 percent raise with 5 percent 
inflation, but workers do not always see it that way. The 2 percent wage cut may 
seem like an insult, whereas the 3 percent raise is, after all, still a raise. Empirical 
studies confirm that nominal wages rarely fall.
This finding suggests that some inflation may make labor markets work 
better. The supply and demand for different kinds of labor are always changing. 
Sometimes an increase in supply or decrease in demand leads to a fall in the 
equilibrium real wage for a group of workers. If nominal wages can’t be cut, 
then the only way to cut real wages is to allow inflation to do the job. Without 
inflation, the real wage will be stuck above the equilibrium level, resulting in 
higher unemployment.
This debate over silver found its most memorable expression in a children’s 
book, The Wizard of Oz. Written by a Midwestern journalist, L. Frank Baum, just 
after the 1896 election, it tells the story of Dorothy, a girl lost in a strange land 
far from her home in Kansas. Dorothy (representing traditional American values) 
makes three friends: a scarecrow (the farmer), a tin woodman (the industrial 
worker), and a lion whose roar exceeds his might (William Jennings Bryan). 
Together, the four of them make their way along a perilous yellow brick road 
(the gold standard), hoping to find the Wizard who will help Dorothy return 
home. Eventually they arrive in Oz (Washington), where everyone sees the world 
through green glasses (money). The Wizard (William McKinley) tries to be all 
things to all people but turns out to be a fraud. Dorothy’s problem is solved only 
when she learns about the magical power of her silver slippers.7
The Republicans won the election of 1896, and the United States stayed on 
a gold standard, but the Free Silver advocates got the inflation that they wanted. 
Around the time of the election, gold was discovered in Alaska, Australia, and 
South Africa. In addition, gold refiners devised the cyanide process, which 
facilitated the extraction of gold from ore. These developments led to increases 
in the money supply and in prices. From 1896 to 1910 the price level rose 
35 percent. n
7The movie made about forty years later hid much of the allegory by changing Dorothy’s slippers 
from silver to ruby. For more on this topic, see Henry M. Littlefield, “The Wizard of Oz: Parable on 
Populism,” American Quarterly 16 (Spring 1964): 47–58; and Hugh Rockoff, “The Wizard of Oz as a 
Monetary Allegory,” Journal of Political Economy 98 (August 1990): 739–760. It should be noted that 
there is no direct evidence that Baum intended his work as a monetary allegory, so some people believe 
that the parallels are the work of economic historians’ overactive imaginations.

126 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
For this reason, some economists argue that inflation “greases the wheels” of 
labor markets. Only a little inflation is needed: an inflation rate of 2 percent lets 
real wages fall by 2 percent per year, or about 20 percent per decade, without 
cuts in nominal wages. Such automatic reductions in real wages are impossible 
with zero inflation.8
 5-6  Hyperinflation
Hyperinflation is often defined as inflation that exceeds 50 percent per month, 
which is just over 1 percent per day. Compounded over many months, this rate 
of inflation leads to very large increases in the price level. An inflation rate of 
50 percent per month implies a more than 100-fold increase in the price level 
over a year and a more than 2-million-fold increase over three years. Here we 
consider the costs and causes of such extreme inflation.
The Costs of Hyperinflation
Although economists debate whether the costs of moderate inflation are large or 
small, no one doubts that hyperinflation extracts a high toll on society. The costs 
are qualitatively the same as those we discussed earlier. When inflation reaches 
extreme levels, however, these costs are more apparent because they are so severe.
The shoeleather costs associated with reduced money holding, for instance, 
are serious under hyperinflation. Business executives devote much time and 
energy to cash management when cash loses its value quickly. By diverting this 
time and energy from more socially valuable activities, such as production and 
investment decisions, hyperinflation makes the economy run less efficiently.
Menu costs also become larger under hyperinflation. Firms have to change 
prices so often that normal business practices, such as printing and distributing 
catalogs with fixed prices, become impossible. In one restaurant during the 
German hyperinflation of the 1920s, a waiter would stand up on a table every 
30 minutes to call out the new prices.
Similarly, relative prices do not do a good job of reflecting true scarcity during 
hyperinflations. When prices change frequently by large amounts, it is hard for cus­
tomers to shop around for the best price. Highly volatile and rapidly rising prices 
can alter behavior in many ways. According to one report, when patrons entered 
a pub during the German hyperinflation, they would often buy two pitchers of 
beer. Although the second pitcher would lose value by getting warm over time, 
it would lose value less rapidly than the money left sitting in the patron’s wallet.
8For an examination of this benefit of inflation, see George A. Akerlof, William T. Dickens, and 
George L. Perry, “The Macroeconomics of Low Inflation,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 
1996, no. 1: 1–76. Another argument for positive inflation is that it allows for the possibility of 
negative real interest rates. This issue is discussed in Chapter 12 in an FYI box on The Liquidity Trap.

C H A P T E R  5   Inflation: Its Causes, Effects, and Social Costs  | 127
Tax systems are also distorted by hyperinflation—but in ways that are 
different from the distortions of moderate inflation. In most tax systems there 
is a delay between the time a tax is levied and the time it is actually paid to the 
government. In the United States, for example, taxpayers are required to make 
estimated income tax payments every three months. This short delay does not 
matter much under low inflation. By contrast, during hyperinflation, even a 
short delay greatly reduces real tax revenue. By the time the government gets the 
money it is due, the money has fallen in value. As a result, once hyperinflations 
start, the real tax revenue of the government often falls substantially.
Finally, no one should underestimate the sheer inconvenience of living with 
hyperinflation. When carrying money to the grocery store is as burdensome as 
carrying the groceries back home, the monetary system is not doing its best to 
facilitate exchange. The government tries to overcome this problem by adding 
more and more zeros to the paper currency, but often it cannot keep up with 
the exploding price level.
Eventually, these costs of hyperinflation become intolerable. Over time, 
money loses its role as a store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange. 
Barter becomes more common. And more stable unofficial monies—cigarettes 
or the U.S. dollar—start to replace the official money.
The Causes of Hyperinflation
Why do hyperinflations start, and how do 
they end? This question can be answered at 
different levels.
The most obvious answer is that hyper­
inflations are due to excessive growth in the 
supply of money. When the central bank prints 
money, the price level rises. When it prints 
money rapidly enough, the result is hyperin­
flation. To stop the hyperinflation, the central 
bank must reduce the rate of money growth.
This answer is incomplete, however, for 
it leaves open the question of why central 
banks in hyperinflating economies choose 
to print so much money. To address this 
deeper question, we must turn our attention 
from monetary to fiscal policy. Most hyperinflations begin when the govern­
ment has inadequate tax revenue to pay for its spending. Although the govern­
ment might prefer to finance this budget deficit by issuing debt, it may find itself 
unable to borrow, perhaps because lenders view the government as a bad credit 
risk. To cover the deficit, the government turns to the only mechanism at its dis­
posal—the printing press. The result is rapid money growth and hyperinflation.
Once the hyperinflation is under way, the fiscal problems become even more 
severe. Because of the delay in collecting tax payments, real tax revenue falls as 
inflation rises. Thus, the government’s need to rely on seigniorage is self-reinforcing.

128 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
Rapid money creation leads to hyperinflation, which leads to a larger budget deficit, 
which leads to even more rapid money creation.
The ends of hyperinflations almost always coincide with fiscal reforms. Once 
the magnitude of the problem becomes apparent, the government musters the 
political will to reduce government spending and increase taxes. These fiscal 
reforms reduce the need for seigniorage, which allows a reduction in money 
growth. Hence, even if inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenom­
enon, the end of hyperinflation is often a fiscal phenomenon as well.9
Hyperinflation in Interwar Germany
After World War I, Germany experienced one of history’s most spectacular exam­
ples of hyperinflation. At the war’s end, the Allies demanded that Germany pay 
substantial reparations. These payments led to fiscal deficits in Germany, which the 
German government eventually financed by printing large quantities of money.
Panel (a) of Figure 5-6 shows the quantity of money and the general price 
level in Germany from January 1922 to December 1924. During this period 
both money and prices rose at an amazing rate. For example, the price of a daily 
newspaper rose from 0.30 mark in January 1921 to 1 mark in May 1922, to 
8 marks in October 1922, to 100 marks in February 1923, and to 1,000 marks 
in September 1923. Then, in the fall of 1923, prices took off: the newspaper sold 
for 2,000 marks on October 1, 20,000 marks on October 15, 1 million marks on 
October 29, 15 million marks on November 9, and 70 million marks on Novem­
ber 17. In December 1923 the money supply and prices abruptly stabilized.10
Just as fiscal problems caused the German hyperinflation, a fiscal reform ended 
it. At the end of 1923, the number of government employees was cut by one-
third, and the reparations payments were temporarily suspended and eventually 
reduced. At the same time, a new central bank, the Rentenbank, replaced the old 
central bank, the Reichsbank. The Rentenbank was committed to not financing 
the government by printing money.
According to our theoretical analysis of money demand, an end to a hyperin­
flation should lead to an increase in real money balances as the cost of holding 
money falls. Panel (b) of Figure 5-6 shows that real money balances in Germany 
did fall as inflation increased and then increased again as inflation fell. Yet the 
increase in real money balances was not immediate. Perhaps the adjustment of 
real money balances to the cost of holding money is a gradual process. Or per­
haps it took time for people in Germany to believe that the inflation had ended, 
so that expected inflation fell more gradually than actual inflation. n

Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe
In 1980, after years of colonial rule, the old British colony of Rhodesia became 
the new African nation of Zimbabwe. A new currency, the Zimbabwe dollar, was 
introduced to replace the Rhodesian dollar. For the first decade, inflation in the 
new nation was modest—about 10 to 20 percent per year. That, however, would 
soon change.
The hero of the Zimbabwe independence movement was Robert Mugabe. 
In general elections in 1980, he became the nation’s first prime minister and later, 
after a government reorganization, its president. Over the years, he continued to 
get reelected. In his 2008 reelection, however, there were widespread claims of 
electoral fraud and threats against voters who supported rival candidates. At the 
age of 84, Mugabe was no longer as popular as he once was, but he gave no sign 
of any willingness to relinquish power.
Throughout his tenure, Mugabe’s economic philosophy was Marxist, 
and one of his goals was to redistribute wealth. In the 1990s his govern­
ment instituted a series of land reforms with the ostensible purpose of 
redistributing land from the white minority who ruled Zimbabwe during 
the colonial era toward the historically disenfranchised black population. 
One result of these reforms was widespread corruption. Many abandoned 
and expropriated white farms ended up in the hands of cabinet ministers 
and senior government officials. Another result was a substantial decline in 
farm output. Productivity fell as many of the experienced white farmers fled 
the country.
The decline in the economy’s output led to a fall in the government’s tax 
revenue. The government responded to this revenue shortfall by printing money 
to pay the salaries of government employees. As textbook economic theory 
predicts, the monetary expansion led to higher inflation.
Mugabe tried to deal with inflation by imposing price controls. Once again, 
the result was predictable: a shortage of many goods and the growth of an 
underground economy where price controls and tax collection were evaded. 
The government’s tax revenue declined further, inducing even more mon­
etary expansion and yet higher inflation. In July 2008, the officially reported 
inflation rate was 231 million percent. Other observers put the inflation rate 
even higher.
The repercussions of the hyperinflation were widespread. In an article in 
the Washington Post, one Zimbabwean citizen describes the situation as follows: 
“If you don’t get a bill collected in 48 hours, it isn’t worth collecting, because 
it is worthless. Whenever we get money, we must immediately spend it, just go 
and buy what we can. Our pension was destroyed ages ago. None of us have any 
savings left.”
The Zimbabwe hyperinflation finally ended in March 2009, when the gov­
ernment abandoned its own money. The U.S. dollar became the nation’s official 
currency. Inflation quickly stabilized. Zimbabwe still had its problems, but at least 
hyperinflation was not among them. n

 5-7  Conclusion: The Classical Dichotomy
Over the course of this and the previous chapter, we have studied the meaning 
of money and the impact of the money supply on inflation and various other 
variables. This analysis builds on our model of national income in Chapter 3. 
Let’s now step back and examine a key assumption that has been implicit in our 
discussion.
In Chapter 3, we explained many macroeconomic variables. Some of these 
variables were quantities, such as real GDP and the capital stock; others were 
relative prices, such as the real wage and the real interest rate. But all of these 
variables had one thing in common—they measured a physical (rather than a 
monetary) quantity. Real GDP is the quantity of goods and services produced 
in a given year, and the capital stock is the quantity of machines and structures 
available at a given time. The real wage is the quantity of output a worker earns 
for each hour of work, and the real interest rate is the quantity of output a person 
earns in the future by lending one unit of output today. All variables measured 
in physical units, such as quantities and relative prices, are called real variables.
In this chapter we examined nominal variables—variables expressed in 
terms of money. The economy has many nominal variables, such as the price 
level, the inflation rate, and the dollar wage a person earns.
At first it may seem surprising that we were able to explain real variables 
without introducing nominal variables or the existence of money. In Chapter 3 
we studied the level and allocation of the economy’s output without mentioning 
the price level or the rate of inflation. Our theory of the labor market explained 
the real wage without explaining the nominal wage.
Economists call this theoretical separation of real and nominal variables the 
classical dichotomy. It is the hallmark of classical macroeconomic theory. The 
classical dichotomy is an important insight because it simplifies economic theory. 
In particular, it allows us to examine real variables, as we have done, while ignor­
ing nominal variables. The classical dichotomy arises because, in classical eco­
nomic theory, changes in the money supply do not influence real variables. This 
irrelevance of money in the determination of real variables is called monetary 
neutrality. For many purposes—in particular for studying long-run issues—
monetary neutrality is approximately correct.
Yet monetary neutrality does not fully describe the world in which we 
live. Beginning in Chapter 10, we discuss departures from the classical model 
and monetary neutrality. These departures are crucial for understanding many 
macroeconomic phenomena, such as short-run economic fluctuations.
Summary
	1.	The quantity theory of money assumes that the velocity of money is stable 
and concludes that nominal GDP is proportional to the stock of money. 
Because the factors of production and the production function determine 

132 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
real GDP, the quantity theory implies that the price level is proportional 
to the quantity of money. Therefore, the rate of growth in the quantity of 
money determines the inflation rate.
	2.	Seigniorage is the revenue that the government raises by printing money. 
It is a tax on money holding. Although seigniorage is quantitatively small 
in most economies, it is often a major source of government revenue in 
economies experiencing hyperinflation.
	3.	The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate (the interest rate as usually 
reported) corrected for the effects of inflation. The ex post real interest rate 
is based on actual inflation, whereas the ex ante real interest rate is based 
on expected inflation. The Fisher effect says that the nominal interest rate 
moves one-to-one with expected inflation.
	4.	The nominal interest rate is the opportunity cost of holding money. Thus, 
one might expect the demand for money to depend on the nominal inter­
est rate. If it does, then the price level depends on both the current quantity 
of money and the quantities of money expected in the future.
	5.	The costs of expected inflation include shoeleather costs, menu costs, the 
cost of relative price variability, tax distortions, and the inconvenience 
of making inflation corrections. In addition, unexpected inflation causes 
arbitrary redistributions of wealth between debtors and creditors. One 
possible benefit of inflation is that it improves the functioning of labor 
markets by allowing real wages to reach equilibrium levels without cuts in 
nominal wages.
	6.	During hyperinflations, most of the costs of inflation become severe. 
Hyperinflations typically begin when governments finance large budget 
deficits by printing money. They end when fiscal reforms eliminate the 
need for seigniorage.
	7.	According to classical economic theory, money is neutral: the money supply 
does not affect real variables. Therefore, classical theory allows us to study 
how real variables are determined without any reference to the money sup­
ply. The equilibrium in the money market then determines the price level 
and, as a result, all other nominal variables. This theoretical separation of real 
and nominal variables is called the classical dichotomy.

The Cagan Model: How Current 
and Future Money Affect the 
Price Level
A P P E N D I X
In this chapter we showed that if the quantity of real money balances demanded 
depends on the cost of holding money, the price level depends on both the 
current money supply and the future money supply. This appendix develops the 
Cagan model to show more explicitly how this relationship works.11
To keep the math as simple as possible, we posit a money demand function 
that is linear in the natural logarithms of all the variables. The money demand 
function is
	
mt 2 pt 5 2(  pt 11 2 pt),	
(A1)
where mt is the log of the quantity of money at time t, pt is the log of the price 
level at time t, and  is a parameter that governs the sensitivity of money demand 
to the rate of inflation. By the property of logarithms, mt 2 pt is the log of real 
money balances, and pt 11 2 pt is the inflation rate between period t and period 
t 1 1. This equation states that if inflation goes up by 1 percentage point, real 
money balances fall by  percent.
We have made a number of assumptions in writing the money demand func­
tion in this way. First, by excluding the level of output as a determinant of money 
demand, we are implicitly assuming that it is constant. Second, by including 
the rate of inflation rather than the nominal interest rate, we are assuming that 
the real interest rate is constant. Third, by including actual inflation rather than 
expected inflation, we are assuming perfect foresight. All of these assumptions are 
made to keep the analysis as simple as possible.
We want to solve Equation A1 to express the price level as a function of cur­
rent and future money. To do this, note that Equation A1 can be rewritten as
	
pt 5 ​( ​  1 
____ 
1 1  ​ ) ​mt 1 ​( ​ 
 
____ 
1 1  ​ ) pt11.	
(A2)
This equation states that the current price level pt is a weighted average of the 
current money supply mt and the next period’s price level pt 11. The next period’s 
price level will be determined the same way as this period’s price level:
	
pt 11 5 ​( ​  1 
____ 
1 1  ​ )​ mt 11 1 ​( ​ 
 
____ 
1 1  ​ ) pt 12.	
(A3)
11This model is derived from Phillip Cagan, “The Monetary Dynamics of Hyperinflation,” in 
­Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money, edited by Milton Friedman (Chicago: University of 
Chicago Press, 1956): 25–117.

136 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
Now substitute Equation A3 for pt +1 in Equation A2 to obtain
	
pt 5 ​  1 
____ 
1 1  ​  mt 1 ​ 
 
______ 
(1 1 )2 ​  mt 11 1 ​ 
2 
______ 
(1 1 )2 ​   pt12.	
(A4)
Equation A4 states that the current price level is a weighted average of the cur­
rent money supply, the next period’s money supply, and the following period’s 
price level. Once again, the price level in period t 1 2 is determined as in 
­Equation A2:
	
pt 12 5 ​( ​  1 
____ 
1 1  ​ )​ mt 12 1 ​( ​ 
 
____ 
1 1  ​ )​ pt 13.	
(A5)
Now substitute Equation A5 into Equation A4 to obtain
	
pt 5 ​  1 
____ 
1 1   ​ mt 1 ​ 
 
______ 
(1 1 )2 ​  mt 11 1  
2 
______ 
(1 1 )3 ​  mt 12 1 ​ 
3 
______ 
(1 1 )3 ​  ​ pt 13.	
(A6)
By now you see the pattern. We can continue to use Equation A2 to substitute 
for the future price level. If we do this an infinite number of times, we find
	
pt 5 ​( ​  1 
____ 
1 1  ​ ) ​[ mt 1 ​( ​ 
 
____ 
1 1  ​ )​mt 11 1 ​( ​ 
 
____ 
1 1  ​ )​
2
mt 12 1 ​( ​ 
 
____ 
1 1  ​ )
3
mt 13 1 … ]​,	(A7)
where “. . .” indicates an infinite number of analogous terms. According to Equa­
tion A7, the current price level is a weighted average of the current money sup­
ply and all future money supplies.
Note the importance of , the parameter governing the sensitivity of real 
money balances to inflation. The weights on the future money supplies decline 
geometrically at rate /(1 1 ). If  is small, then /(1 1 ) is small, and the 
weights decline quickly. In this case, the current money supply is the primary 
determinant of the price level. (Indeed, if  equals zero, we obtain the quantity 
theory of money: the price level is proportional to the current money supply, and 
the future money supplies do not matter at all.) If  is large, then /(1 1 ) is 
close to 1, and the weights decline slowly. In this case, the future money supplies 
play a key role in determining today’s price level.
Finally, let’s relax the assumption of perfect foresight. If the future is not 
known with certainty, then we should write the money demand function as
	
mt 2 pt 5 2 (Ept 11 2 pt),	
(A8)
where Ept 11 is the expected price level. Equation A8 states that real money bal­
ances depend on expected inflation. By following steps similar to those above, 
we can show that
	pt 5 ( ​  1 
____ 
1 1  ​ )​[ mt 1 ( ​ 
 
____ 
1 1  ​ )​Emt 11 1 ​( ​ 
 
____ 
1 1  ​ )​
2
Emt 12 1 ​( ​ 
 
____ 
1 1  ​ )​
3
Emt 13 1 … ]​.	(A9)
Equation A9 states that the price level depends on the current money supply and 
expected future money supplies.
Some economists use this model to argue that credibility is important for 
ending hyperinflation. Because the price level depends on both current and 

C H A P T E R  5   Inflation: Its Causes, Effects, and Social Costs  | 137
expected future money, inflation depends on both current and expected future 
money growth. Therefore, to end high inflation, both money growth and 
expected money growth must fall. Expectations, in turn, depend on credibility—
the perception that the central bank is committed to a new, more stable policy.
How can a central bank achieve credibility in the midst of hyperinfla­
tion? Credibility is often achieved by removing the underlying cause of the 
hyperinflation—the need for seigniorage. Thus, a credible fiscal reform is often 
necessary for a credible change in monetary policy. This fiscal reform might 
take the form of reducing government spending and making the central bank 
more independent from the government. Reduced spending decreases the need 
for seigniorage, while increased independence allows the central bank to resist 
government demands for seigniorage.

The Open Economy
No nation was ever ruined by trade.

ven if you never leave your hometown, you are an active participant in 
the global economy. When you go to the grocery store, for instance, you 
might choose between apples grown locally and grapes grown in Chile. 
When you make a deposit into your local bank, the bank might lend those funds 
to your next-door neighbor or to a Japanese company building a factory outside 
Tokyo. Because our economy is integrated with many others around the world, 
consumers have more goods and services from which to choose, and savers have 
more opportunities to invest their wealth.
In previous chapters we simplified our analysis by assuming a closed economy. 
In actuality, however, most economies are open: they export goods and services 
abroad, they import goods and services from abroad, and they borrow and lend 
in world financial markets. Figure 6-1 gives some sense of the importance of 
these international interactions by showing imports and exports as a percentage 
of GDP for ten major countries. As the figure shows, exports from the United 
States are about 14 percent of GDP, and imports are about 17 percent. Trade is 
even more important for many other countries—imports and exports are about 
a quarter of GDP in China, a third in Canada, and a half in Germany. In these 
countries, international trade is central to analyzing economic developments and 
formulating economic policies.
This chapter begins our study of open-economy macroeconomics. We begin 
in Section 6-1 with questions of measurement. To understand how an open 
economy works, we must understand the key macroeconomic variables that 
measure the interactions among countries. Accounting identities reveal a key 
insight: the flow of goods and services across national borders is always matched 
by an equivalent flow of funds to finance capital accumulation.
In Section 6-2 we examine the determinants of these international flows. 
We develop a model of the small open economy that corresponds to our model 
of the closed economy in Chapter 3. The model shows the factors that determine 
whether a country is a borrower or a lender in world markets and how policies 
at home and abroad affect the flows of capital and goods.

140 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
In Section 6-3 we extend the model to discuss the prices at which a country 
makes exchanges in world markets. We examine what determines the price of 
domestic goods relative to foreign goods. We also examine what determines the 
rate at which the domestic currency trades for foreign currencies. Our model 
shows how protectionist trade policies—policies designed to protect domestic 
industries from foreign competition—influence the amount of international 
trade and the exchange rate.
 6-1   The International Flows of 
Capital and Goods
The key macroeconomic difference between open and closed economies is that, 
in an open economy, a country’s spending in any given year need not equal 
its output of goods and services. A country can spend more than it produces 
by borrowing from abroad, or it can spend less than it produces and lend the 
difference to foreigners. To understand this more fully, let’s take another look at 
national income accounting, which we first discussed in Chapter 2.

The Role of Net Exports
Consider the expenditure on an economy’s output of goods and services. In a 
closed economy, all output is sold domestically, and expenditure is divided into 
three components: consumption, investment, and government purchases. In an 
open economy, some output is sold domestically and some is exported to be sold 
abroad. We can divide expenditure on an open economy’s output Y into four 
components:
n	 Cd, consumption of domestic goods and services,
n	 Id, investment in domestic goods and services,
n	 Gd, government purchases of domestic goods and services,
n	 X, exports of domestic goods and services.
The division of expenditure into these components is expressed in the identity
Y 5 Cd 1 Id 1 Gd 1 X.
The sum of the first three terms, Cd 1 Id 1 Gd, is domestic spending on domes­
tic goods and services. The fourth term, X, is foreign spending on domestic goods 
and services.
A bit of manipulation can make this identity more useful. Note that domestic 
spending on all goods and services equals domestic spending on domestic goods 
and services plus domestic spending on foreign goods and services. Hence, total 
consumption C equals consumption of domestic goods and services Cd plus con­
sumption of foreign goods and services Cf; total investment I equals investment in 
domestic goods and services Id plus investment in foreign goods and services If; 
and total government purchases G equals government purchases of domestic goods 
and services Gd plus government purchases of foreign goods and services Gf. Thus,
C 5 Cd 1 C f,
I 5 Id 1 If,
G 5 Gd 1 Gf.
We substitute these three equations into the identity above:
Y 5 (C 2 Cf ) 1 (I 2 If ) 1 (G 2 Gf ) 1 X.
We can rearrange to obtain
Y 5 C 1 I 1 G 1 X 2 (Cf 1 If 1 Gf ).
The sum of domestic spending on foreign goods and services (Cf 1 If 1 Gf ) 
is expenditure on imports (IM ). We can thus write the national income accounts 
identity as
Y 5 C 1 I 1 G 1 X 2 IM.
Because spending on imports is included in domestic spending (C 1 I 1 G ), 
and because goods and services imported from abroad are not part of a country’s 

142 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
output, this equation subtracts spending on imports. Defining net exports to be 
exports minus imports (NX 5 X 2 IM ), the identity becomes
Y 5 C 1 I 1 G 1 NX.
This equation states that expenditure on domestic output is the sum of con­
sumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports. This is the most 
common form of the national income accounts identity; it should be familiar 
from Chapter 2.
The national income accounts identity shows how domestic output, domestic 
spending, and net exports are related. In particular,
	
NX	
5	
Y	
2	
(C 1 I 1 G )
Net Exports 5 Output 2 Domestic Spending.
This equation shows that in an open economy, domestic spending need not 
equal the output of goods and services. If output exceeds domestic spending, we export 
the difference: net exports are positive. If output falls short of domestic spending, we import 
the difference: net exports are negative.
International Capital Flows and the Trade Balance
In an open economy, as in the closed economy we discussed in Chapter 3, 
financial markets and goods markets are closely related. To see the relationship, 
we must rewrite the national income accounts identity in terms of saving and 
investment. Begin with the identity
Y 5 C 1 I 1 G 1 NX.
Subtract C and G from both sides to obtain
Y 2 C 2 G 5 I 1 NX.
Recall from Chapter 3 that Y 2 C 2 G is national saving S, which equals the 
sum of private saving, Y 2 T 2 C, and public saving, T 2 G, where T stands 
for taxes. Therefore,
S 5 I 1 NX.
Subtracting I from both sides of the equation, we can write the national income 
accounts identity as
S 2 I 5 NX.
This form of the national income accounts identity shows that an economy’s net 
exports must always equal the difference between its saving and its investment.
Let’s look more closely at each part of this identity. The easy part is the right-
hand side, NX, net exports of goods and services. Another name for net exports 
is the trade balance, because it tells us how our trade in goods and services 
departs from the benchmark of equal imports and exports.

C H A P T E R  6   The Open Economy  | 143
The left-hand side of the identity is the difference between domestic saving and 
domestic investment, S 2 I, which we’ll call net capital outflow. (It’s sometimes 
called net foreign investment.) Net capital outflow equals the amount that domestic 
residents are lending abroad minus the amount that foreigners are lending to us. 
If net capital outflow is positive, the economy’s saving exceeds its investment, and it 
is lending the excess to foreigners. If the net capital outflow is negative, the econ­
omy is experiencing a capital inflow: investment exceeds saving, and the economy 
is financing this extra investment by borrowing from abroad. Thus, net capital 
outflow reflects the international flow of funds to finance capital accumulation.
The national income accounts identity shows that net capital outflow always 
equals the trade balance. That is,
Net Capital Outflow 5 Trade Balance
	
S 2 I	
5	
NX.
If S 2 I and NX are positive, we have a trade surplus. In this case, we are net 
lenders in world financial markets, and we are exporting more goods than we are 
importing. If S 2 I and NX are negative, we have a trade deficit. In this case, 
we are net borrowers in world financial markets, and we are importing more 
goods than we are exporting. If S 2 I and NX are exactly zero, we are said to 
have balanced trade because the value of imports equals the value of exports.
The national income accounts identity shows that the international flow of funds to 
finance capital accumulation and the international flow of goods and services are two sides 
of the same coin. If domestic saving exceeds domestic investment, the surplus 
saving is used to make loans to foreigners. Foreigners require these loans because 
we are providing them with more goods and services than they are providing us. 
That is, we are running a trade surplus. If investment exceeds saving, the extra 
investment must be financed by borrowing from abroad. These foreign loans 
enable us to import more goods and services than we export. That is, we are 
running a trade deficit. Table 6-1 summarizes these lessons.
Note that the international flow of capital can take many forms. It is easiest 
to assume—as we have done so far—that when we run a trade deficit, foreigners 
make loans to us. This happens, for example, when the Chinese buy the debt

issued by U.S. corporations or by the U.S. government. But the flow of capital 
can also take the form of foreigners buying domestic assets, such as when a citizen 
of Germany buys stock from an American on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Whether foreigners buy domestically issued debt or domestically owned assets, 
they obtain a claim to the future returns to domestic capital. In both cases, 
foreigners end up owning some of the domestic capital stock.
International Flows of Goods and Capital: An Example
The equality of net exports and net capital outflow is an identity: it must hold 
because of how the variables are defined and the numbers are added up. But it 
is easy to miss the intuition behind this important relationship. The best way to 
understand it is to consider an example.
Imagine that Bill Gates sells a copy of the Windows operating system to a 
Japanese consumer for 10,000 yen. Because Mr. Gates is a U.S. resident, the sale 
represents an export of the United States. Other things equal, U.S. net exports 
rise. What else happens to make the identity hold? It depends on what Mr. Gates 
does with the 10,000 yen.
Suppose Mr. Gates decides to stuff the 10,000 yen in his mattress. In this 
case, Mr. Gates has allocated some of his saving to an investment in the Japanese 
economy (in the form of the Japanese currency) rather than to an investment in 
the U.S. economy. Thus, U.S. saving exceeds U.S. investment. The rise in U.S. net 
exports is matched by a rise in the U.S. net capital outflow.
If Mr. Gates wants to invest in Japan, however, he is unlikely to make currency 
his asset of choice. He might use the 10,000 yen to buy some stock in, say, the 
Japanese firm Sony, or he might buy a bond issued by the Japanese government. 
In either case, some of U.S. saving flows abroad. Once again, the U.S. net capital 
outflow exactly balances U.S. net exports.
The opposite situation occurs in Japan. When the Japanese consumer buys a 
copy of the Windows operating system, Japan’s purchases of goods and services 
(C 1 I 1 G ) rise, but there is no change in what Japan has produced (Y  ). Japan’s 
imports increase, and its net exports decrease. In addition, the transaction reduces 
Japan’s saving (S 5Y 2 C 2 G ) for a given level of investment (I ). While the United 
States experiences a net capital outflow, Japan experiences a net capital inflow.
Now let’s change the example. Suppose that instead of investing his 10,000 yen 
in a Japanese asset, Mr. Gates uses it to buy something made in Japan, such as 
a supersize box of Pokémon cards. In this case, imports into the United State 
rise. Together, the Windows export and the Pokémon import represent balanced 
trade between Japan and the United States. Because exports and imports rise 
equally, net exports and net capital outflow are both unchanged.
A final possibility is that Mr. Gates exchanges his 10,000 yen for U.S. dollars at 
a local bank. But this doesn’t change the situation: the bank now has to do some­
thing with the 10,000 yen. It can buy Japanese assets (a U.S. net capital outflow); 
it can buy a Japanese good (a U.S. import); or it can sell the yen to another 
American who wants to make such a transaction. If you follow the money, you 
can see that, in the end, U.S. net exports must equal U.S. net capital outflow.

The Irrelevance of Bilateral Trade Balances
The trade balance we have been discussing measures the difference between a 
nation’s exports and its imports with the rest of the world. Sometimes you might 
hear a media report on a nation’s trade balance with a specific other nation. This 
is called a bilateral trade balance. For example, the U.S. bilateral trade balance with 
China equals exports that the United States sells to China minus imports that the 
United States buys from China.
The overall trade balance is, as we have seen, inextricably linked to a nation’s 
saving and investment. That is not true of a bilateral trade balance. Indeed, a 
nation can have large trade deficits and surpluses with specific trading partners 
while having balanced trade overall.
For example, suppose the world has three countries: the United States, China, 
and Australia. The United States sells $100 billion in machine tools to Australia, 
Australia sells $100 billion in wheat to China, and China sells $100 billion in toys 
to the United States. In this case, the United States has a bilateral trade deficit 
with China, China has a bilateral trade deficit with Australia, and Australia has a 
bilateral trade deficit with the United States. But each of the three nations has 
balanced trade overall because it has exported and imported $100 billion in goods.
Bilateral trade deficits receive more attention in the political arena than they 
deserve. This is in part because international relations are conducted country to 
country, so politicians and diplomats are naturally drawn to statistics measuring 
country-to-country economic transactions. Most economists, however, believe that 
bilateral trade balances are not very meaningful. From a macroeconomic stand­
point, it is a nation’s trade balance with all foreign nations put together that matters.
The same lesson applies to individuals as it does to nations. Your own personal 
trade balance is the difference between your income and your spending, and you 
may be concerned if these two variables are out of line. But you should not be 
concerned with the difference between your income and spending with a par­
ticular person or firm. Economist Robert Solow once explained the irrelevance 
of bilateral trade balances as follows: “I have a chronic deficit with my barber, 
who doesn’t buy a darned thing from me.” But that doesn’t stop Mr. Solow from 
living within his means—or getting a haircut when he needs it.
 6-2   Saving and Investment in a 
Small Open Economy
So far in our discussion of the international flows of goods and capital, we have 
rearranged accounting identities. That is, we have defined some of the variables 
that measure transactions in an open economy, and we have shown the links 
among these variables that follow from their definitions. Our next step is to 
develop a model that explains the behavior of these variables. We can then use 
the model to answer questions such as how the trade balance responds to changes 
in policy.

146 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
Capital Mobility and the World Interest Rate
In a moment we present a model of the international flows of capital and goods. 
Because the trade balance equals the net capital outflow, which in turn equals 
saving minus investment, our model focuses on saving and investment. To develop 
this model, we use some elements that should be familiar from Chapter 3, but 
unlike with the Chapter 3 model, we do not assume that the real interest rate 
equilibrates saving and investment. Instead, we allow the economy to run a trade 
deficit and borrow from other countries or to run a trade surplus and lend to 
other countries.
If the real interest rate does not adjust to equilibrate saving and investment in 
this model, what does determine the real interest rate? We answer this question 
here by considering the simple case of a small open economy with perfect 
capital mobility. By “small” we mean that this economy is a small part of the 
world market and thus, by itself, can have only a negligible effect on the world 
interest rate. By “perfect capital mobility” we mean that residents of the country 
have full access to world financial markets. In particular, the government does not 
impede international borrowing or lending.
Because of this assumption of perfect capital mobility, the interest rate in our 
small open economy, r, must equal the world interest rate r *, the real interest 
rate prevailing in world financial markets:
r 5 r *.
Residents of the small open economy need never borrow at any interest rate 
above r *, because they can always get a loan at r * from abroad. Similarly, residents 
of this economy need never lend at any interest rate below r *, because they can 
always earn r * by lending abroad. Thus, the world interest rate determines the 
interest rate in our small open economy.
Let’s briefly discuss what determines the world real interest rate. In a closed 
economy, the equilibrium of domestic saving and domestic investment deter­
mines the interest rate. Barring interplanetary trade, the world economy is a 
closed economy. Therefore, the equilibrium of world saving and world invest­
ment determines the world interest rate. Our small open economy has a negligi­
ble effect on the world real interest rate because, being a small part of the world, 
it has a negligible effect on world saving and world investment. Hence, our small 
open economy takes the world interest rate as exogenously given.
Why Assume a Small Open Economy?
The analysis in the body of this chapter assumes that the nation being studied 
is a small open economy. (The same approach is taken in Chapter 13, which 
examines short-run fluctuations in an open economy.) This assumption raises 
some questions.
Q: Is the United States well described by the assumption of a small open economy?
A: No, it is not, at least not completely. The United States does borrow and 
lend in world financial markets, and these markets exert a strong influence over 

C H A P T E R  6   The Open Economy  | 147
the U.S. real interest rate, but it would be an exaggeration to say that the U.S. real 
interest rate is determined solely by world financial markets.
Q: So why are we assuming a small open economy?
A: Some nations, such as Canada and the Netherlands, are better described by 
the assumption of a small open economy. Yet the main reason for making this 
assumption is to develop understanding and intuition for the macroeconomics 
of open economies. Remember from Chapter 1 that economic models are built 
with simplifying assumptions. An assumption need not be realistic to be useful. 
Assuming a small open economy simplifies the analysis greatly and, therefore, 
helps clarify our thinking.
Q: Can we relax this assumption and make the model more realistic?
A: Yes, we can, and we will. The appendix to this chapter (and the appendix 
to Chapter 13) considers the more realistic and more complicated case of a large 
open economy. Some instructors skip directly to this material when teaching 
these topics because the approach is more realistic for economies such as that of 
the United States. Others think that students should walk before they run and, 
therefore, begin with the simplifying assumption of a small open economy.
The Model
To build the model of the small open economy, we take three assumptions from 
Chapter 3:
n	 The economy’s output Y is fixed by the factors of production and the 
production function. We write this as
Y 5 Y– 5 F(K–, L–).
n	 Consumption C is positively related to disposable income Y 2 T. 
We write the consumption function as
C 5 C(Y 2 T ).
n	 Investment I is negatively related to the real interest rate r. We write the 
investment function as
I 5 I(r).
These are the three key parts of our model. If you do not understand these 
relationships, review Chapter 3 before continuing.
We can now return to the accounting identity and write it as
NX 5 (Y 2 C 2 G) 2 I
NX 5 S 2 I.
Substituting the Chapter 3 assumptions recapped above and the assumption that 
the interest rate equals the world interest rate, we obtain
NX 5 [Y– 2 C(Y– 2 T ) 2 G] 2 I(r *)
	
5 	
S–	
2 I(r *).

148 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
This equation shows that the trade balance NX depends on those variables that 
determine saving S and investment I. Because saving depends on fiscal policy 
(lower government purchases G or higher taxes T raise national saving) and 
investment depends on the world real interest rate r* (a higher interest rate 
makes some investment projects unprofitable), the trade balance depends on 
these variables as well.
In Chapter 3 we graphed saving and investment as in Figure 6-2. In the 
closed economy studied in that chapter, the real interest rate adjusts to equili­
brate saving and investment—that is, the real interest rate is found where the 
saving and investment curves cross. In the small open economy, however, the real 
interest rate equals the world real interest rate. The trade balance is determined by 
the difference between saving and investment at the world interest rate.
At this point, you might wonder about the mechanism that causes the trade 
balance to equal the net capital outflow. The determinants of the capital flows are 
easy to understand. When saving falls short of investment, investors borrow from 
abroad; when saving exceeds investment, the excess is lent to other countries. 
But what causes those who import and export to behave so that the interna­
tional flow of goods exactly balances this international flow of capital? For now 
we leave this question unanswered, but we return to it in Section 6-3 when we 
discuss the determination of exchange rates.
How Policies Influence the Trade Balance
Suppose that the economy begins in a position of balanced trade. That is, at 
the world interest rate, investment I equals saving S, and net exports NX equal 
zero. Let’s use our model to predict the effects of government policies at home 
and abroad.
FIGURE  6-2

real interest rate adjusts 
to equilibrate saving and

cial markets. The difference

ment determines the trade 
balance. Here there is a trade 
surplus, because at the world

investment.

Fiscal Policy at Home  Consider first what happens to the small open econ­
omy if the government expands domestic spending by increasing government 
purchases. The increase in G reduces national saving, because S 5 Y 2 C 2 G. 
With an unchanged world real interest rate, investment remains the same. There­
fore, saving falls below investment, and some investment must now be financed by 
borrowing from abroad. Because NX 5 S 2 I, the fall in S implies a fall in NX. 
The economy now runs a trade deficit.
The same logic applies to a decrease in taxes. A tax cut lowers T, raises dispos­
able income Y 2 T, stimulates consumption, and reduces national saving. (Even 
though some of the tax cut finds its way into private saving, public saving falls 
by the full amount of the tax cut; in total, saving falls.) Because NX 5 S 2 I, the 
reduction in national saving in turn lowers NX.
Figure 6-3 illustrates these effects. A fiscal policy change that increases private 
consumption C or public consumption G reduces national saving (Y 2 C 2 G) 
and, therefore, shifts the vertical line that represents saving from S1 to S2. Because 
NX is the distance between the saving schedule and the investment schedule at 
the world interest rate, this shift reduces NX. Hence, starting from balanced trade, a 
change in fiscal policy that reduces national saving leads to a trade deficit.
Fiscal Policy Abroad  Consider now what happens to a small open economy 
when foreign governments increase their government purchases. If these foreign 
countries are a small part of the world economy, then their fiscal change has a 
negligible impact on other countries. But if these foreign countries are a large 
part of the world economy, their increase in government purchases reduces world 
saving. The decrease in world saving causes the world interest rate to rise, just as 
we saw in our closed-economy model (remember, Earth is a closed economy).
The increase in the world interest rate raises the cost of borrowing and, thus, 
reduces investment in our small open economy. Because there has been no 
change in domestic saving, saving S now exceeds investment I, and some of our 
FIGURE  6-3

saving begins to flow abroad. Because NX 5 S 2 I, the reduction in I must also 
increase NX. Hence, reduced saving abroad leads to a trade surplus at home.
Figure 6-4 illustrates how a small open economy starting from balanced trade 
responds to a foreign fiscal expansion. Because the policy change occurs abroad, 
the domestic saving and investment schedules remain the same. The only change 
is an increase in the world interest rate from r1  * to r2*. The trade balance is the 
difference between the saving and investment schedules; because saving exceeds 
investment at r2*, there is a trade surplus. Hence, starting from balanced trade, an 
increase in the world interest rate due to a fiscal expansion abroad leads to a trade surplus.
Shifts in Investment Demand  Consider what happens to our small open 
economy if its investment schedule shifts outward—that is, if the demand for 
investment goods at every interest rate increases. This shift would occur if, for 
example, the government changed the tax laws to encourage investment by 
providing an investment tax credit. Figure 6-5 illustrates the impact of a shift 
in the investment schedule. At a given world interest rate, investment is now 
higher. Because saving is unchanged, some investment must now be financed by 
borrowing from abroad. Because capital flows into the economy to finance the 
increased investment, the net capital outflow is negative. Put differently, because 
NX 5 S 2 I, the increase in I implies a decrease in NX. Hence, starting from 
­balanced trade, an outward shift in the investment schedule causes a trade deficit.
Evaluating Economic Policy
Our model of the open economy shows that the flow of goods and services mea­
sured by the trade balance is inextricably connected to the international flow of 
funds for capital accumulation. The net capital outflow is the difference between

domestic saving and domestic investment. Thus, the impact of economic policies 
on the trade balance can always be found by examining their impact on domestic 
saving and domestic investment. Policies that increase investment or decrease sav­
ing tend to cause a trade deficit, and policies that decrease investment or increase 
saving tend to cause a trade surplus.
Our analysis of the open economy has been positive, not normative. That 
is, our analysis of how economic policies influence the international flows of 
capital and goods has not told us whether these policies are desirable. Evaluating 
economic policies and their impact on the open economy is a frequent topic of 
debate among economists and policymakers.
When a country runs a trade deficit, policymakers must confront the question 
of whether it represents a national problem. Most economists view a trade deficit 
not as a problem in itself, but perhaps as a symptom of a problem. A trade deficit 
could be a reflection of low saving. In a closed economy, low saving leads to low 
investment and a smaller future capital stock. In an open economy, low saving 
leads to a trade deficit and a growing foreign debt, which eventually must be 
repaid. In both cases, high current consumption leads to lower future consump­
tion, implying that future generations bear the burden of low national saving.
Yet trade deficits are not always a reflection of an economic malady. When 
poor rural economies develop into modern industrial economies, they sometimes 
finance their high levels of investment with foreign borrowing. In these cases, 
trade deficits are a sign of economic development. For example, South Korea 
ran large trade deficits throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, and it became one 
of the success stories of economic growth. The lesson is that one cannot judge 
economic performance from the trade balance alone. Instead, one must look at 
the underlying causes of the international flows.

The U.S. Trade Deficit
During the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, the United States ran large trade deficits. 
Panel (a) of Figure 6-6 documents this experience by showing net exports as 
a percentage of GDP. The exact size of the trade deficit fluctuated over time, 
but it was large throughout these three decades. In 2013, the trade deficit was 
$497 billion, or 3.0 percent of GDP. As accounting identities require, this trade 
deficit had to be financed by borrowing from abroad (or, equivalently, by selling 
U.S. assets abroad). During this period, the United States went from being the 
world’s largest creditor to the world’s largest debtor.
What caused the U.S. trade deficit? There is no single explanation. But to 
understand some of the forces at work, it helps to look at national saving and 
domestic investment, as shown in panel (b) of the figure. Keep in mind that the 
trade deficit is the difference between saving and investment.
The start of the trade deficit coincided with a fall in national saving. This 
development can be explained by the expansionary fiscal policy in the 1980s. 
With the support of President Reagan, the U.S. Congress passed legislation 
in 1981 that substantially cut personal income taxes over the next three years. 
Because these tax cuts were not met with equal cuts in government spending, the 
federal budget went into deficit. These budget deficits were among the largest 
ever experienced in a period of peace and prosperity, and they continued long 
after Reagan left office. According to our model, such a policy should reduce 
national saving, thereby causing a trade deficit. And, in fact, that is exactly what 
happened. Because the government budget and trade balance went into deficit 
at roughly the same time, these shortfalls were called the twin deficits.
Things started to change in the 1990s, when the U.S. federal government got 
its fiscal house in order. The first President Bush and President Clinton both 
signed tax increases, while Congress kept a lid on spending. In addition to these 
policy changes, rapid productivity growth in the late 1990s raised incomes and, 
thus, further increased tax revenue. These developments moved the U.S. federal 
budget from deficit to surplus, which in turn caused national saving to rise.
In contrast to our model’s predictions, the increase in national saving did not 
coincide with a shrinking trade deficit, because domestic investment rose at the 
same time. The likely explanation is that the boom in information technology 
caused an expansionary shift in the U.S. investment function. Even though fiscal 
policy was pushing the trade deficit toward surplus, the investment boom was an 
even stronger force pushing the trade balance toward deficit.
In the early 2000s, fiscal policy once again put downward pressure on national 
saving. With the second President Bush in the White House, tax cuts were signed 
into law in 2001 and 2003, while the war on terror led to substantial increases in 
government spending. The federal government was again running budget deficits. 
National saving fell to historic lows, and the trade deficit reached historic highs.
A few years later, the trade deficit started to shrink somewhat, as the economy 
experienced a substantial decline in housing prices (a phenomenon examined in 
Case Studies in Chapters 12 and 17). Lower housing prices led to a substantial

decline in residential investment. The trade deficit fell from 5.5 percent of GDP 
at its peak in 2006 to 3.0 percent in 2013.
The history of the U.S. trade deficit shows that this statistic, by itself, does not 
tell us much about what is happening in the economy. We have to look deeper 
at saving, investment, and the policies and events that cause them (and thus the 
trade balance) to change over time.1 n
1For more on this topic, see Catherine L. Mann, Is the U.S. Trade Deficit Sustainable? (Washington, DC: 
Institute for ­International Economics, 1999).
Why Doesn’t Capital Flow to Poor Countries?
The U.S. trade deficit discussed in the previous Case Study represents a flow of capi­
tal into the United States from the rest of the world. What countries were the source 
of these capital flows? Because the world is a closed economy, the capital must have 
been coming from those countries that were running trade surpluses. In 2013, this 
group included many nations that were far poorer than the United States, such as 
China, Nigeria, Venezuela, and Vietnam. In these nations, saving exceeded invest­
ment in domestic capital. These countries were sending funds abroad to countries 
like the United States, where investment in domestic capital exceeded saving.
From one perspective, the direction of international capital flows is a paradox. 
Recall our discussion of production functions in Chapter 3. There, we established 
that an empirically realistic production function is the Cobb–Douglas form:
F (K, L) 5 A K
 aL12a,
where K is capital, L is labor, A is a variable representing the state of technol­
ogy, and a is a parameter that determines capital’s share of total income. For this 
production function, the marginal product of capital is
MPK 5 a A (K/L)a21.
The marginal product of capital tells us how much extra output an extra unit 
of capital would produce. Because a is capital’s share, it must be less than 1, so 
a 2 1  0. This means that an increase in K/L decreases MPK. In other words, 
holding other variables constant, the more capital a nation has, the less valuable 
an extra unit of capital is. This phenomenon of diminishing marginal product 
says that capital should be more valuable where capital is scarce.
This prediction, however, seems at odds with the international flow of capital rep­
resented by trade imbalances. Capital does not seem to flow to those nations where 
it should be most valuable. Instead of capital-rich countries like the United States 
lending to capital-poor countries, we often observe the opposite. Why is that?
One reason is that there are important differences among nations other 
than their accumulation of capital. Poor nations have not only lower levels of 
capital accumulation per worker (represented by K/L) but also inferior pro­
duction ­capabilities (represented by the variable A). For example, compared to

 6-3  Exchange Rates
Having examined the international flows of capital and of goods and services, we 
now extend the analysis by considering the prices that apply to these transactions. 
The exchange rate between two countries is the price at which residents of those 
countries trade with each other. In this section we first examine precisely what 
the exchange rate measures and then discuss how exchange rates are determined.
Nominal and Real Exchange Rates
Economists distinguish between two exchange rates: the nominal exchange rate 
and the real exchange rate. Let’s discuss each in turn and see how they are related.
The Nominal Exchange Rate The nominal exchange rate is the rela­
tive price of the currencies of two countries. For example, if the exchange rate 
between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen is 80 yen per dollar, then you can 
exchange one dollar for 80 yen in world markets for foreign currency. A Japanese 
who wants to obtain dollars would pay 80 yen for each dollar he bought. An 
American who wants to obtain yen would get 80 yen for each dollar he paid. 
When people refer to “the exchange rate” between two countries, they usually 
mean the nominal exchange rate.
2For more on this topic, see Robert E. Lucas, “Why Doesn’t Capital Flow From Rich to Poor 
Countries?” American Economic Review 80 (May 1990): 92–96.
rich nations, poor nations may have less access to advanced technologies, lower 
levels of education (or human capital), or less efficient economic policies. Such 
differences could mean less output for given inputs of capital and labor; in the 
Cobb–Douglas production function, this is translated into a lower value of the 
parameter A. If so, then capital need not be more valuable in poor nations, even 
though capital is scarce.
A second reason capital might not flow to poor nations is that property rights 
are often not enforced. Corruption is much more prevalent; revolutions, coups, 
and expropriation of wealth are more common; and governments often default 
on their debts. So even if capital is more valuable in poor nations, foreigners 
may avoid investing their wealth there simply because they are afraid of losing 
it. Moreover, local investors face similar incentives. Imagine that you live in a 
poor nation and are lucky enough to have some wealth to invest; you might well 
decide that putting it in a safe country like the United States is your best option, 
even if capital is less valuable there than in your home country.
Whichever of these two reasons is correct, the challenge for poor nations is to 
find ways to reverse the situation. If these nations offered the same production 
efficiency and legal protections as the U.S. economy, the direction of interna­
tional capital flows would likely reverse. The U.S. trade deficit would become a 
trade surplus, and capital would flow to these emerging nations. Such a change 
would help the poor of the world escape poverty.2 n

156 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
Notice that an exchange rate can be reported in two ways. If one dollar 
buys 80 yen, then one yen buys 0.0125 dollar. We can say the exchange rate 
is 80 yen per dollar, or we can say the exchange rate is 0.0125 dollar per yen. 
Because 0.0125 equals 1/80, these two ways of expressing the exchange rate 
are ­equivalent.
This book always expresses the exchange rate in units of foreign currency per 
dollar. With this convention, a rise in the exchange rate—say, from 80 to 100 yen 
per dollar—is called an appreciation of the dollar; a fall in the exchange rate is 
called a depreciation. When the domestic currency appreciates, it buys more of the 
foreign currency; when it depreciates, it buys less. An appreciation is sometimes 
called a strengthening of the currency, and a depreciation is sometimes called a 
weakening of the currency.
The Real Exchange Rate The real exchange rate is the relative price of 
the goods of two countries. That is, the real exchange rate tells us the rate at 
which we can trade the goods of one country for the goods of another. The real 
exchange rate is sometimes called the terms of trade.
To see the relation between the real and nominal exchange rates, consider a 
single good produced in many countries: cars. Suppose an American car costs 
$25,000 and a similar Japanese car costs 4,000,000 yen. To compare the prices of 
the two cars, we must convert them into a common currency. If a dollar is worth 
80 yen, then the American car costs 80 3 25,000, or 2,000,000 yen. Compar­
ing the price of the American car (2,000,000 yen) and the price of the Japanese 
car (4,000,000 yen), we conclude that the American car costs one-half of what 
the Japanese car costs. In other words, at current prices, we can exchange two 
American cars for one Japanese car.
We can summarize our calculation as follows:
Real Exchange Rate 5 ​ 
(80 Yen/Dollar) 3 (25,000 Dollars/American Car) 
 
 
 
 
_____ 
 
 
 
(4,000,000 Yen/Japanese Car) 
​
5 0.5 ​ 
Japanese Car 
 
____________ 
 
American Car      .
At these prices and this exchange rate, we obtain one-half of a Japanese car per 
American car. More generally, we can write this calculation as
Real Exchange Rate 5 ​ 
Nominal Exchange Rate 3 Price of Domestic Good 
 
 
 
 
_____ 
 
 
 
Price of Foreign Good 
.
The rate at which we exchange foreign and domestic goods depends on the 
prices of the goods in the local currencies and on the rate at which the curren­
cies are exchanged.
This calculation of the real exchange rate for a single good suggests how we 
should define the real exchange rate for a broader basket of goods. Let e be the 
nominal exchange rate (the number of yen per dollar), P be the price level in the 

C H A P T E R  6   The Open Economy  | 157
United States (measured in dollars), and P * be the price level in Japan (measured 
in yen). Then the real exchange rate e is

The real exchange rate between two countries is computed from the nominal 
exchange rate and the price levels in the two countries. If the real exchange rate 
is high, foreign goods are relatively cheap, and domestic goods are relatively expensive. If 
the real exchange rate is low, foreign goods are relatively expensive, and domestic goods are 
relatively cheap.
The Real Exchange Rate and the Trade Balance
What macroeconomic influence does the real exchange rate exert? To answer 
this question, remember that the real exchange rate is nothing more than a 
­relative price. Just as the relative price of hamburgers and 
pizza determines which you choose for lunch, the relative 
price of domestic and foreign goods affects the demand for 
these goods.
Suppose first that the real exchange rate is low. In this 
case, because domestic goods are relatively cheap, domestic 
residents will want to purchase fewer imported goods: they 
will buy Fords rather than Toyotas, drink Budweiser rather 
than Heineken, and vacation in Florida rather than Italy. 
For the same reason, foreigners will want to buy many of 
our goods. As a result of both of these actions, the quantity 
of our net exports demanded will be high.
The opposite occurs if the real exchange rate is high. 
Because domestic goods are expensive relative to foreign goods, 
domestic residents will want to buy many imported goods, and foreigners will want to 
buy few of our goods. Therefore, the quantity of our net exports demanded will be low.
We write this relationship between the real exchange rate and net exports as
NX 5 NX (e).
This equation states that net exports are a function of the real exchange rate. 
Figure 6-7 illustrates the negative relationship between the trade balance and the 
real exchange rate.
The Determinants of the Real Exchange Rate
We now have all the pieces needed to construct a model that explains what fac­
tors determine the real exchange rate. In particular, we combine the relationship 
between net exports and the real exchange rate we just discussed with the model

strong in Nebraska.”

158 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
of the trade balance we developed earlier in the chapter. We can summarize the 
analysis as follows:
n	 The real value of a currency is inversely related to net exports. When the 
real exchange rate is lower, domestic goods are less expensive relative to 
foreign goods, and net exports are greater.
n	 The trade balance (net exports) must equal the net capital outflow, 
which in turn equals saving minus investment. Saving is fixed by the 
­consumption function and fiscal policy; investment is fixed by the invest­
ment function and the world interest rate.
Figure 6-8 illustrates these two conditions. The line showing the relationship 
between net exports and the real exchange rate slopes downward because a low

and the downward-sloping

of capital abroad equals the 
quantity of dollars demanded 
for the net export of goods 
and services.

can be less than zero.

real exchange rate makes domestic goods relatively inexpensive. The line repre­
senting the excess of saving over investment, S 2 I, is vertical because neither 
saving nor investment depends on the real exchange rate. The crossing of these 
two lines determines the equilibrium real exchange rate.
Figure 6-8 looks like an ordinary supply-and-demand diagram. In fact, you can think 
of this diagram as representing the supply and demand for ­foreign-currency exchange. 
The vertical line, S 2 I, represents the net capital outflow and thus the supply of dol­
lars to be exchanged into foreign currency and invested abroad. The downward-sloping 
line, NX (e ), represents the net demand for dollars coming from foreigners who want 
dollars to buy our goods. At the equilibrium real exchange rate, the supply of dollars available 
from the net capital outflow balances the demand for dollars by foreigners buying our net exports.
How Policies Influence the Real Exchange Rate
We can use this model to show how the changes in economic policy we dis­
cussed earlier affect the real exchange rate.
Fiscal Policy at Home What happens to the real exchange rate if the gov­
ernment reduces national saving by increasing government purchases or cutting 
taxes? As we discussed earlier, this reduction in saving lowers S 2 I and thus NX. 
That is, the reduction in saving causes a trade deficit.
Figure 6-9 shows how the equilibrium real exchange rate adjusts to ensure that 
NX falls. The change in policy shifts the vertical S 2 I line to the left, lowering the 
supply of dollars to be invested abroad. The lower supply causes the equilibrium 
real exchange rate to rise from e1 to e2—that is, the dollar becomes more valuable. 
Because of the rise in the value of the dollar, domestic goods become more expen­
sive relative to foreign goods, which causes exports to fall and imports to rise. The 
change in exports and the change in imports both act to reduce net exports.
FIGURE  6-9
The Impact of Expansionary 
Fiscal Policy at Home on the 
Real Exchange Rate  
Expansionary ­fiscal ­policy at 
home, such as an increase in 
government purchases or a 
cut in taxes, reduces national 
saving. The fall in saving reduces 
the supply of dollars to be 
exchanged into foreign currency, 
from S1 2 I to S2 2 I. This 
shift raises the equilibrium real 
exchange rate from e1 to e2.

160 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
Fiscal Policy Abroad What happens to the real exchange rate if foreign gov­
ernments increase government purchases or cut taxes? Either change in fiscal 
policy reduces world saving and raises the world interest rate. The increase in the 
world interest rate reduces domestic investment I, which raises S 2 I and thus 
NX. That is, the increase in the world interest rate causes a trade surplus.
Figure 6-10 shows that this change in policy shifts the vertical S 2 I line to 
the right, raising the supply of dollars to be invested abroad. The equilibrium real 
exchange rate falls. That is, the dollar becomes less valuable, and domestic goods 
become less expensive relative to foreign goods.
Shifts in Investment Demand What happens to the real exchange rate 
if investment demand at home increases, perhaps because Congress passes an 
investment tax credit? At the given world interest rate, the increase in investment 
demand leads to higher investment. A higher value of I means lower values of 
S 2 I and NX. That is, the increase in investment demand causes a trade deficit.
Figure 6-11 shows that the increase in investment demand shifts the vertical 
S 2 I line to the left, reducing the supply of dollars to be invested abroad. The 
equilibrium real exchange rate rises. Hence, when the investment tax credit makes 
investing in the United States more attractive, it also increases the value of the U.S. 
dollars necessary to make these investments. When the dollar appreciates, domestic 
goods become more expensive relative to foreign goods, and net exports fall.
The Effects of Trade Policies
Now that we have a model that explains the trade balance and the real exchange 
rate, we have the tools to examine the macroeconomic effects of trade policies. 
Trade policies, broadly defined, are policies designed to directly influence the

amount of goods and services exported or imported. Most often, trade policies 
take the form of protecting domestic industries from foreign competition—
either by placing a tax on foreign imports (a tariff) or restricting the amount of 
goods and services that can be imported (a quota).
For an example of a protectionist trade policy, consider what would hap­
pen if the government prohibited the import of foreign cars. For any given real 
exchange rate, imports would now be lower, implying that net exports (exports 
minus imports) would be higher. Thus, the net-exports schedule would shift 
outward, as in Figure 6-12. To see the effects of the policy, we compare the old 
equilibrium and the new equilibrium. In the new equilibrium, the real exchange 
rate is higher, and net exports are unchanged. Despite the shift in the net-exports 
schedule, the equilibrium level of net exports remains the same, because the pro­
tectionist policy does not alter either saving or investment.
This analysis shows that protectionist trade policies do not affect the trade bal­
ance. This surprising conclusion is often overlooked in the popular debate over 
trade policies. Because a trade deficit reflects an excess of imports over exports, 
one might guess that reducing imports—such as by prohibiting the import of 
foreign cars—would reduce a trade deficit. Yet our model shows that protection­
ist policies lead only to an appreciation of the real exchange rate. The increase in 
the price of domestic goods relative to foreign goods tends to lower net exports 
by stimulating imports and depressing exports. Thus, the appreciation offsets the 
increase in net exports that is directly attributable to the trade restriction.
Although protectionist trade policies do not alter the trade balance, they do 
affect the amount of trade. As we have seen, because the real exchange rate appre­
ciates, the goods and services we produce become more expensive relative to for­
eign goods and services. We therefore export less in the new equilibrium. Because

net exports are unchanged, we must import less as well. (The ­appreciation of the 
exchange rate does stimulate imports to some extent, but this only partly offsets 
the decrease in imports due to the trade restriction.) Thus, protectionist policies 
reduce both the quantity of imports and the quantity of exports.
This fall in the total amount of trade is the reason economists usually oppose 
protectionist policies. International trade benefits all countries by allowing each 
country to specialize in what it produces best and by providing each country 
with a greater variety of goods and services. Protectionist policies diminish these 
gains from trade. Although these policies benefit certain groups within society—
for example, a ban on imported cars helps domestic car producers—society on 
average is worse off when policies reduce the amount of international trade.
The Determinants of the Nominal Exchange Rate
Having seen what determines the real exchange rate, we now turn our attention 
to the nominal exchange rate—the rate at which the currencies of two countries 
trade. Recall the relationship between the real and the nominal exchange rate:

This equation shows that the nominal exchange rate depends on the real 
exchange rate and the price levels in the two countries. Given the value of the 
real exchange rate, if the domestic price level P rises, then the nominal exchange 
rate e will fall: because a dollar is worth less, a dollar will buy fewer yen. However, 
if the Japanese price level P * rises, then the nominal exchange rate will increase: 
because the yen is worth less, a dollar will buy more yen.
It is instructive to consider changes in exchange rates over time. The exchange 
rate equation can be written
% Change in e 5 % Change in e 1 % Change in P * 2 % Change in P.
The percentage change in e is the change in the real exchange rate. The percent­
age change in P is the domestic inflation rate p, and the percentage change in 
P * is the foreign country’s inflation rate p *. Thus, the percentage change in the 
nominal exchange rate is

Inflation Rates
This equation states that the percentage change in the nominal exchange rate 
between the currencies of two countries equals the percentage change in the real 
exchange rate plus the difference in their inflation rates. If a country has a high rate 
of inflation relative to the United States, a dollar will buy an increasing amount of the 
foreign currency over time. If a country has a low rate of inflation relative to the United 
States, a dollar will buy a decreasing amount of the foreign currency over time.
This analysis shows how monetary policy affects the nominal exchange rate. 
We know from Chapter 5 that high growth in the money supply leads to high 
inflation. Here, we have just seen that one consequence of high inflation is a 
depreciating currency: high p implies falling e. In other words, just as growth 
in the amount of money raises the price of goods measured in terms of money, 
it also tends to raise the price of foreign currencies measured in terms of the 
domestic currency.
Inflation and Nominal Exchange Rates
If we look at data on exchange rates and price levels of different countries, we 
quickly see the importance of inflation for explaining changes in the nominal 
exchange rate. The most dramatic examples come from periods of very high 
inflation. For example, the price level in Mexico rose by 2,300 percent from 
1983 to 1988. Because of this inflation, the number of pesos a person could buy 
with a U.S. dollar rose from 144 in 1983 to 2,281 in 1988.
The same relationship holds true for countries with more moderate inflation. 
Figure 6-13 is a scatterplot showing the relationship between inflation and the 
exchange rate for 15 countries. On the horizontal axis is the difference between

each country’s average inflation rate and the average inflation rate of the ­United 
States (p * 2 p). On the vertical axis is the average percentage change in the 
exchange rate between each country’s currency and the U.S. dollar (percentage 
change in e). The positive relationship between these two variables is clear in this 
figure. The correlation between these variables—a statistic that runs from 21 to 
11 and measures how closely the variables are related—is 0.82. Countries with 
relatively high inflation tend to have depreciating currencies (you can buy more 
of them with your dollars over time), and countries with relatively low inflation 
tend to have appreciating currencies (you can buy less of them with your dollars 
over time).
For example, consider the exchange rate between Swiss francs and U.S. dollars. 
Both Switzerland and the United States have experienced inflation over these 
years, so both the franc and the dollar buy fewer goods than they once did. But, 
as Figure 6-13 shows, inflation in Switzerland has been lower than inflation in 
the United States. This means that the value of the franc has fallen less than the 
value of the dollar. Therefore, the number of Swiss francs you can buy with a U.S. 
dollar has been falling over time. n

The Special Case of Purchasing-Power Parity
A famous hypothesis in economics, called the law of one price, states that the same good 
cannot sell for different prices in different locations at the same time. If a bushel of 
wheat sold for less in New York than in Chicago, it would be profitable to buy wheat 
in New York and then sell it in Chicago. This profit opportunity would become 
quickly apparent to astute arbitrageurs—people who specialize in “buying low” in 
one market and “selling high” in another. As the arbitrageurs took advantage of this 
opportunity, they would increase the demand for wheat in New York and increase 
the supply of wheat in Chicago. Their actions would drive the price up in New York 
and down in Chicago, thereby ensuring that prices are equalized in the two markets.
The law of one price applied to the international marketplace is called 
purchasing-power parity. It states that if international arbitrage is possible, 
then a dollar (or any other currency) must have the same purchasing power in 
every country. The argument goes as follows. If a dollar could buy more wheat 
domestically than abroad, there would be opportunities to profit by buying 
wheat domestically and selling it abroad. Profit-seeking arbitrageurs would drive 
up the domestic price of wheat relative to the foreign price. Similarly, if a dol­
lar could buy more wheat abroad than domestically, the arbitrageurs would buy 
wheat abroad and sell it domestically, driving down the domestic price relative to 
the foreign price. Thus, profit-seeking by international arbitrageurs causes wheat 
prices to be the same in all countries.
We can interpret the doctrine of purchasing-power parity using our model 
of the real exchange rate. The quick action of these international arbitrageurs 
implies that net exports are highly sensitive to small movements in the real 
exchange rate. A small decrease in the price of domestic goods relative to foreign 
goods—that is, a small decrease in the real exchange rate—causes arbitrageurs 
to buy goods domestically and sell them abroad. Similarly, a small increase in 
the relative price of domestic goods causes arbitrageurs to import goods from 
abroad. Therefore, as in Figure 6-14, the net-exports schedule is very flat at the 
FIGURE  6-14
Purchasing-Power 
Parity  The law of one price 
applied to the international 
marketplace suggests that net 
exports are highly sensitive to 
small movements in the real 
exchange rate. This high sen­
sitivity is reflected here with a 
very flat net-exports schedule.

166 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
real exchange rate that equalizes purchasing power among countries: any small 
movement in the real exchange rate leads to a large change in net exports. This 
extreme sensitivity of net exports guarantees that the equilibrium real exchange 
rate is always close to the level that ensures purchasing-power parity.
Purchasing-power parity has two important implications. First, because the 
net-exports schedule is flat, changes in saving or investment do not influence the 
real or nominal exchange rate. Second, because the real exchange rate is fixed, all 
changes in the nominal exchange rate result from changes in price levels.
Is this doctrine of purchasing-power parity realistic? Most economists believe 
that, despite its appealing logic, purchasing-power parity does not provide a 
completely accurate description of the world. First, many goods are not easily 
traded. A haircut can be more expensive in Tokyo than in New York, yet there is 
no room for international arbitrage because it is impossible to transport haircuts. 
Second, even tradable goods are not always perfect substitutes. Some consumers 
prefer Toyotas, and others prefer Fords. Thus, the relative price of Toyotas and 
Fords can vary to some extent without leaving any profit opportunities. For these 
reasons, real exchange rates do in fact vary over time.
Although the doctrine of purchasing-power parity does not describe the 
world perfectly, it does provide a reason that movement in the real exchange rate 
will be limited. There is much validity to its underlying logic: the farther the real 
exchange rate drifts from the level predicted by purchasing-power parity, the 
greater the incentive for individuals to engage in international arbitrage in goods. 
We cannot rely on purchasing-power parity to eliminate all changes in the real 
exchange rate, but this doctrine does provide a reason to expect that fluctuations 
in the real exchange rate will typically be small or temporary.3
The Big Mac Around the World
The doctrine of purchasing-power parity says that after we adjust for exchange 
rates, we should find that goods sell for the same price everywhere. Conversely, it 
says that the exchange rate between two currencies should depend on the price 
levels in the two countries.
To see how well this doctrine works, The Economist, an international news 
magazine, regularly collects data on the price of a good sold in many countries: 
the McDonald’s Big Mac hamburger. According to purchasing-power parity, the 
price of a Big Mac should be closely related to the country’s nominal exchange 
rate. The higher the price of a Big Mac in the local currency, the higher the 
exchange rate (measured in units of local currency per U.S. dollar) should be.
Table 6-2 presents the international prices in 2014, when a Big Mac sold for 
$4.80 in the United States (this was the average price in New York, San Francisco,

 6-4   Conclusion: The United States as a 
Large Open Economy
In this chapter we have seen how a small open economy works. We have exam­
ined the determinants of the international flow of funds for capital accumula­
tion and the international flow of goods and services. We have also examined 
the determinants of a country’s real and nominal exchange rates. Our analysis 
shows how various policies—monetary policies, fiscal policies, and trade poli­
cies—affect the trade balance and the exchange rate.
The economy we have studied is “small” in the sense that its interest rate is 
fixed by world financial markets. That is, we have assumed that this economy 
does not affect the world interest rate and that the economy can borrow and lend 
at the world interest rate in unlimited amounts. This assumption contrasts with 
the assumption we made when we studied the closed economy in Chapter 3. In 
the closed economy, the domestic interest rate equilibrates domestic saving and 
domestic investment, implying that policies that influence saving or investment 
alter the equilibrium interest rate.
Which of these analyses should we apply to an economy such as that of the 
United States? The answer is a little of both. The United States is neither so large 
nor so isolated that it is immune to developments occurring abroad. The large trade 
deficits of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s show the importance of international finan­
cial markets for funding U.S. investment. Hence, the closed-economy analysis of 
Chapter 3 cannot by itself fully explain the impact of policies on the U.S. economy.
Yet the U.S. economy is not so small and so open that the analysis of this 
chapter applies perfectly either. First, the United States is large enough that it can 
influence world financial markets. Second, capital may not be perfectly mobile 
across countries. If individuals prefer holding their wealth in domestic rather 
than foreign assets, funds for capital accumulation will not flow freely to equate 
Chicago, and Atlanta). With these data we can use the doctrine of ­purchasing-power 
parity to predict nominal exchange rates. For example, because a Big Mac cost 
8,600 pesos in Colombia we would predict that the exchange rate between the 
dollar and the yen was 8,600/4.80, or 1,794, pesos per dollar. At this exchange rate, 
a Big Mac would have cost the same in Colombia and the United States.
Table 6-2 shows the predicted and actual exchange rates for 36 countries, 
plus the euro area, ranked by the predicted exchange rate. You can see that the 
evidence on purchasing-power parity is mixed. As the last two columns show, 
the actual and predicted exchange rates are usually in the same ballpark. Our 
theory predicts, for instance, that a U.S. dollar should buy the greatest number 
of Indonesian rupiahs and fewest British pounds, and this turns out to be true. 
In the case of Colombia, the predicted exchange rate of 1,794 pesos per dollar 
is close to the actual exchange rate of 1,848. Yet the theory’s predictions are far 
from exact and, in many cases, are off by 30 percent or more. Hence, although 
the theory of purchasing-power parity provides a rough guide to the level of 
exchange rates, it does not explain exchange rates completely. n

interest rates in all countries. For these two reasons, we cannot directly apply our 
model of the small open economy to the United States.
When analyzing policy for a country such as the United States, we need to 
combine the closed-economy logic of Chapter 3 and the small-open-economy 
logic of this chapter. The appendix to this chapter builds a model of an economy 
between these two extremes. In this intermediate case, there is international bor­
rowing and lending, but the interest rate is not fixed by world financial markets. 
Instead, the more the economy borrows from abroad, the higher the interest rate 
it must offer foreign investors. The results, not surprisingly, are a mixture of the 
two polar cases we have already examined.
Consider, for example, a reduction in national saving due to a fiscal expansion. As 
in the closed economy, this policy raises the real interest rate and crowds out domes­
tic investment. As in the small open economy, it also reduces the net capital outflow, 
leading to a trade deficit and an appreciation of the exchange rate. Hence, although 
the model of the small open economy examined here does not precisely describe 
an economy such as that of the United States, it does provide approximately the 
right answer to how policies affect the trade balance and the exchange rate.
Summary
	1.	Net exports are the difference between exports and imports. They are equal 
to the difference between what we produce and what we demand for con­
sumption, investment, and government purchases.
	2.	The net capital outflow is the excess of domestic saving over domestic 
investment. The trade balance is the amount received for our net exports of 
goods and services. The national income accounts identity shows that the 
net capital outflow always equals the trade balance.
	3.	The impact of any policy on the trade balance can be determined by 
examining its impact on saving and investment. Policies that raise saving or 
lower investment lead to a trade surplus, and policies that lower saving or 
raise investment lead to a trade deficit.
	4.	The nominal exchange rate is the rate at which people trade the currency 
of one country for the currency of another country. The real exchange rate 
is the rate at which people trade the goods produced by the two countries. 
The real exchange rate equals the nominal exchange rate multiplied by the 
ratio of the price levels in the two countries.
	5.	Because the real exchange rate is the price of domestic goods relative to 
foreign goods, an appreciation of the real exchange rate tends to reduce net 
exports. The equilibrium real exchange rate is the rate at which the quan­
tity of net exports demanded equals the net capital outflow.
	6.	The nominal exchange rate is determined by the real exchange rate and the 
price levels in the two countries. Other things equal, a high rate of inflation 
leads to a depreciating currency.

When analyzing policy for a country such as the United States, we need to com­
bine the closed-economy logic of Chapter 3 and the small-open-economy logic 
of this chapter. This appendix presents a model of an economy between these 
two extremes, called the large open economy.
Net Capital Outflow
The key difference between the small and large open economies is the behavior 
of the net capital outflow. In the model of the small open economy, capital flows 
freely into or out of the economy at a fixed world interest rate r *. The model of 
the large open economy makes a different assumption about international capital 
flows. To understand this assumption, keep in mind that the net capital outflow is 
the amount that domestic investors lend abroad minus the amount that foreign 
investors lend here.
Imagine that you are a domestic investor—such as the portfolio manager of 
a university endowment—deciding where to invest your funds. You could invest 
domestically (for example, by making loans to U.S. companies), or you could invest 
abroad (by making loans to foreign companies). Many factors may affect your deci­
sion, but surely one of them is the interest rate you can earn. The higher the interest 
rate you can earn domestically, the less attractive you would find foreign investment.
Investors abroad face a similar decision. They have a choice between investing 
in their home country and lending to someone in the United States. The higher 
the interest rate in the United States, the more willing foreigners are to lend to 
U.S. companies and to buy U.S. assets.
Thus, because of the behavior of both domestic and foreign investors, the 
net flow of capital to other countries, which we’ll denote as CF, is negatively 
related to the domestic real interest rate r. As the interest rate rises, less of our 
saving flows abroad, and more funds for capital accumulation flow in from other 
countries. We write this as
CF 5 CF (r ).
This equation states that the net capital outflow is a function of the domestic 
interest rate. Figure 6-15 illustrates this relationship. Notice that CF can be either 
positive or negative, depending on whether the economy is a lender or borrower 
in world financial markets.
To see how this CF function relates to our previous models, consider 
­Figure 6-16. This figure shows two special cases: a vertical CF function and a

interest rate adjusts to equilibrate domestic saving and investment. This means 
that CF 5 0 at all interest rates. This situation would arise if investors here and 
abroad were unwilling to hold foreign assets, regardless of the return. It might 
also arise if the government prohibited its citizens from transacting in foreign 
financial markets, as some governments do.
The small open economy with perfect capital mobility is the special case 
shown in panel (b) of Figure 6-16. In this case, capital flows freely into and out of 
the country at the fixed world interest rate r *. This situation would arise if inves­
tors here and abroad bought whatever asset yielded the highest return and if this 
economy were too small to affect the world interest rate. The economy’s interest 
rate would be fixed at the interest rate prevailing in world financial markets.

How the Net Capital Outflow Depends on the 
Interest Rate  A higher domestic interest rate 
discourages domestic investors from lending 
abroad and encourages foreign investors to 
lend here. Therefore, net capital outflow CF is 
negatively related to the interest rate.

Why isn’t the interest rate of a large open economy such as the United 
States fixed by the world interest rate? There are two reasons. The first is that 
the United States is large enough to influence world financial markets. The 
more the United States lends abroad, the greater is the supply of loans in the 
world economy, and the lower interest rates become around the world. The 
more the United States borrows from abroad (that is, the more negative CF 
becomes), the higher are world interest rates. We use the label “large open 
economy” because this model applies to an economy large enough to affect 
world interest rates.
There is, however, a second reason the interest rate in an economy may not 
be fixed by the world interest rate: capital may not be perfectly mobile. That is, 
investors here and abroad may prefer to hold their wealth in domestic rather 
than foreign assets. Such a preference for domestic assets could arise because of 
imperfect information about foreign assets or because of government impedi­
ments to international borrowing and lending. In either case, funds for capital 
accumulation will not flow freely to equalize interest rates in all countries. 
Instead, the net capital outflow will depend on domestic interest rates relative 
to foreign interest rates. U.S. investors will lend abroad only if U.S. interest rates 
are comparatively low, and foreign investors will lend in the United States only 
if U.S. interest rates are comparatively high. The large-open-economy model, 
therefore, may apply even to a small economy if capital does not flow freely into 
and out of the economy.
Hence, either because the large open economy affects world interest rates, 
or because capital is imperfectly mobile, or perhaps for both reasons, the CF 
function slopes downward. Except for this new downward-sloping CF function, 
the model of the large open economy resembles the model of the small open 
economy. We put all the pieces together in the next section.
The Model
To understand how the large open economy works, we need to consider two 
key markets: the market for loanable funds (where the interest rate is determined) 
and the market for foreign exchange (where the exchange rate is determined). 
The interest rate and the exchange rate are two prices that guide the allocation 
of resources.
The Market for Loanable Funds An open economy’s saving S is used in 
two ways: to finance domestic investment I and to finance the net capital outflow 
CF. We can write
S 5 I 1 CF.
Consider how these three variables are determined. National saving is fixed by 
the level of output, fiscal policy, and the consumption function. Investment and 
net capital outflow both depend on the domestic real interest rate. We can write
S– 5 I(r ) 1 CF (r ).

176 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
Figure 6-17 shows the market for loanable funds. The supply of loanable funds 
is national saving. The demand for loanable funds is the sum of the demand for 
domestic investment and the demand for foreign investment (net capital out­
flow). The interest rate adjusts to equilibrate supply and demand.
The Market for Foreign Exchange  Next, consider the relationship between 
the net capital outflow and the trade balance. The national income accounts 
identity tells us
NX 5 S 2 I.
Because NX is a function of the real exchange rate, and because CF 5 S 2 I, 
we can write
NX(e ) 5 CF.
Figure 6-18 shows the equilibrium in the market for foreign exchange. Once 
again, the real exchange rate is the price that equilibrates the trade balance and 
the net capital outflow.
The last variable we should consider is the nominal exchange rate. As before, the 
nominal exchange rate is the real exchange rate times the ratio of the price levels:
e 5 e 3 (P */P ).

The real exchange rate is determined as in Figure 6-18, and the price levels are 
determined by monetary policies here and abroad, as we discussed in Chapter 5. 
Forces that move the real exchange rate or the price levels also move the nominal 
exchange rate.
Policies in the Large Open Economy
We can now consider how economic policies influence the large open 
economy. Figure 6-19 shows the three diagrams we need for the analysis. 
Panel (a) shows the equilibrium in the market for loanable funds; panel (b) 
shows the relationship between the equilibrium interest rate and the net 
capital ­outflow; and panel (c) shows the equilibrium in the market for foreign 
exchange.
Fiscal Policy at Home  Consider the effects of expansionary fiscal policy—
an increase in government purchases or a decrease in taxes. Figure 6-20 
shows what happens. The policy reduces national saving S, thereby reducing 
the supply of loanable funds and raising the equilibrium interest rate r. The 
higher interest rate reduces both domestic investment I and the net capital 
FIGURE  6-19

in turn determines the supply of dol­
lars to be exchanged into foreign cur­
rency. Panel (c) shows that the real 
exchange rate adjusts to balance this 
supply of dollars with the demand 
coming from net exports.

outflow CF. The fall in the net capital outflow reduces the supply of dollars 
to be exchanged into foreign currency. The exchange rate appreciates, and net 
exports fall.
Note that the impact of fiscal policy in this model combines its impact in 
the closed economy and its impact in the small open economy. As in the closed 
economy, a fiscal expansion in a large open economy raises the interest rate and 
crowds out investment. As in the small open economy, a fiscal expansion causes 
a trade deficit and an appreciation in the exchange rate.
One way to see how the three types of economy are related is to consider 
the identity
S 5 I 1 NX.
In all three cases, expansionary fiscal policy reduces national saving S. In the 
closed economy, the fall in S coincides with an equal fall in I, and NX stays con­
stant at zero. In the small open economy, the fall in S coincides with an equal 
fall in NX, and I remains constant at the level fixed by the world interest rate.

A Reduction in National Saving in 
the Large Open Economy  Panel 
(a) shows that a reduction in national 
saving lowers the supply of loanable 
funds. The equilibrium interest rate 
rises. Panel (b) shows that the higher 
interest rate lowers the net capital out­
flow. Panel (c) shows that the reduced 
capital outflow means a reduced sup­
ply of dollars in the market for foreign-
currency exchange. The reduced supply 
of dollars causes the real exchange rate 
to appreciate and net exports to fall.
FIGURE  6-20

C H A P T E R  6   The Open Economy  | 179
The large open economy is the intermediate case: both I and NX fall, each by 
less than the fall in S.
Shifts in Investment Demand  Suppose that the investment demand sched­
ule shifts outward, perhaps because Congress passes an investment tax credit. 
Figure 6-21 shows the effect. The demand for loanable funds rises, raising the 
equilibrium interest rate. The higher interest rate reduces the net capital out­
flow: Americans make fewer loans abroad, and foreigners make more loans to 
Americans. The fall in the net capital outflow reduces the supply of dollars in the 
market for foreign exchange. The exchange rate appreciates, and net exports fall.
Trade Policies  Figure 6-22 shows the effect of a trade restriction, such as an 
import quota. The reduced demand for imports shifts the net exports schedule 
outward in panel (c). Because nothing has changed in the market for loanable 
funds, the interest rate remains the same, which in turn implies that the net 
capital outflow remains the same. The shift in the net-exports schedule causes 
the exchange rate to appreciate. The rise in the exchange rate makes U.S. goods 
expensive relative to foreign goods, which depresses exports and stimulates 
imports. In the end, the trade restriction does not affect the trade balance.

180 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
Shifts in Net Capital Outflow There are various reasons that the CF sched­
ule might shift. One reason is fiscal policy abroad. For example, suppose that 
Germany pursues a fiscal policy that raises German saving. This policy reduces 
the German interest rate. The lower German interest rate discourages American 
investors from lending in Germany and encourages German investors to lend in 
the United States. For any given U.S. interest rate, the U.S. net capital outflow falls.
Another reason the CF schedule might shift is political instability abroad. Sup­
pose that a war or revolution breaks out in another country. Investors around the 
world will try to withdraw their assets from that country and seek a “safe haven” 
in a stable country such as the United States. The result is a reduction in the U.S. 
net capital outflow.
Figure 6-23 shows the impact of a leftward shift in the CF schedule. The 
reduced demand for loanable funds lowers the equilibrium interest rate. The 
lower interest rate tends to raise net capital outflow, but because this only partly 
mitigates the shift in the CF schedule, CF still falls. The reduced level of net 
capital outflow reduces the supply of dollars in the market for foreign exchange. 
The exchange rate appreciates, and net exports fall.

Conclusion
How different are large and small open economies? Certainly, policies affect the 
interest rate in a large open economy, unlike in a small open economy. But, in 
other ways, the two models yield similar conclusions. In both large and small 
open economies, policies that raise saving or lower investment lead to trade 
surpluses. Similarly, policies that lower saving or raise investment lead to trade 
deficits. In both economies, protectionist trade policies cause the exchange rate 
to appreciate and do not influence the trade balance. Because the results are so 
similar, for most questions one can use the simpler model of the small open 
economy, even if the economy being examined is not really small.

Unemployment and the
Labor Market
A man willing to work, and unable to find work, is perhaps the saddest sight 
that fortune’s inequality exhibits under the sun.
—Thomas Carlyle
 183
U
nemployment is the macroeconomic problem that affects people most 
directly and severely. For most people, the loss of a job means a reduced 
living standard and psychological distress. It is no surprise that unem­
ployment is a frequent topic of political debate and that politicians often claim 
that their proposed policies would help create jobs. While the issue is perennial, 
it rose to particular prominence in the aftermath of the financial crisis and reces­
sion of 2008–2009, when the unemployment rate lingered around 9 percent for 
several years before drifting down to about 6 percent in 2014.
Economists study unemployment to identify its causes and to help improve the 
public policies that affect the unemployed. Some of these policies, such as job-
training programs, help people find employment. Others, such as unemployment 
insurance, alleviate some of the hardships that the unemployed face. Still other 
policies affect the prevalence of unemployment inadvertently. Laws mandating 
a high minimum wage, for instance, are widely thought to raise unemployment 
among the least skilled and least experienced members of the labor force.
Our discussions of the labor market so far have ignored unemployment. In 
particular, the model of national income in Chapter 3 was built with the assump­
tion that the economy is always at full employment. In reality, not everyone 
in the labor force has a job all the time: in all free-market economies, at any 
moment, some people are unemployed.
Figure 7-1 shows the rate of unemployment—the percentage of the labor 
force unemployed—in the United States from 1950 to 2014. Although the rate 
of unemployment fluctuates from year to year, it never gets even close to zero. 
The average is between 5 and 6 percent, meaning that about 1 out of every 18 
people wanting a job does not have one.
In this chapter we begin our study of unemployment by discussing why there 
is always some unemployment and what determines its level. We do not study 
what determines the year-to-year fluctuations in the rate of unemployment until

The Unemployment Rate and the Natural Rate of Unemployment in the United 
States  There is always some unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment is 
the average level around which the unemployment rate fluctuates. (The natural rate of 
unemployment for any particular month is estimated here by averaging all the unemploy­
ment rates from ten years earlier to ten years later. Future unemployment rates are set at 
5.5 percent.)

C H A P T E R  7   Unemployment and the Labor Market  | 185
that is unemployed. In this section we develop a model of labor-force dynamics 
that shows what determines the natural rate of unemployment.1
We start with some notation. Let L denote the labor force, E the number of 
employed workers, and U the number of unemployed workers. Because every 
worker is either employed or unemployed, the labor force is the sum of the 
employed and the unemployed:
L 5 E 1 U.
In this notation, the rate of unemployment is U/L.
To see what factors determine the unemployment rate, we assume that the 
labor force L is fixed and focus on the transition of individuals in the labor force 
between employment E and unemployment U. This is illustrated in Figure 7-2. 
Let s denote the rate of job separation, the fraction of employed individuals who 
lose or leave their jobs each month. Let f denote the rate of job finding, the fraction 
of unemployed individuals who find a job each month. Together, the rate of job 
separation s and the rate of job finding f determine the rate of unemployment.
If the unemployment rate is neither rising nor falling—that is, if the labor 
market is in a steady state—then the number of people finding jobs fU must equal 
the number of people losing jobs sE. We can write the steady-state condition as
fU 5 sE.
FIGURE  7-2
The Transitions Between Employment and Unemployment  In every period, a fraction s of the 
employed lose their jobs, and a fraction f of the unemployed find jobs. The rates of job separation 
and job finding determine the rate of unemployment.

186 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
We can use this equation to find the steady-state unemployment rate. From our 
definition of the labor force, we know that E 5 L 2 U; that is, the number 
of employed equals the labor force minus the number of unemployed. If we 
­substitute (L 2 U ) for E in the steady-state condition, we find
	
f U 5 s(L 2 U ).
Next, we divide both sides of this equation by L to obtain
	
f ​ U 
_ 
L ​ 5 s ​(1 2 ​ U 
_ 
L ​  )​.
Now we can solve for the unemployment rate U/L to find
	
 U 
_ 
L ​ 5 ​  s 
_ 
s 1 f ​ .
This can also be written as
	
 U 
_ 
L ​ 5 ​ 
1 
_ 
1 1 f ⁄s ​ .
This equation shows that the steady-state rate of unemployment U/L depends 
on the rates of job separation s and job finding f. The higher the rate of job 
separation, the higher the unemployment rate. The higher the rate of job finding, 
the lower the unemployment rate.
Here’s a numerical example. Suppose that 1 percent of the employed 
lose their jobs each month (s 5 0.01). This means that the average spell of 
employment lasts 1/0.01, or 100 months, about 8 years. Suppose further that 
20 ­percent of the unemployed find a job each month (   f 5 0.20), so that the 
average spell of unemployment last 5 months. Then the steady-state rate of 
unemployment is
	
 U 
_ 
L ​ 5 ​ 
0.01 
__ 
 
0.01 1 0.20 ​
	
5 0.0476.
The rate of unemployment in this example is about 5 percent.
This simple model of the natural rate of unemployment has an important 
implication for public policy. Any policy aimed at lowering the natural rate of unem­
ployment must either reduce the rate of job separation or increase the rate of job finding. 
Similarly, any policy that affects the rate of job separation or job finding also changes the 
natural rate of unemployment.
Although this model is useful in relating the unemployment rate to job 
separation and job finding, it fails to answer a central question: Why is there 
unemployment in the first place? If a person could always find a job quickly, 
then the rate of job finding would be very high and the rate of unemployment 
would be near zero. This model of the unemployment rate assumes that job 
finding is not instantaneous, but it fails to explain why. In the next two sec­
tions, we examine two underlying reasons for unemployment: job search and 
wage rigidity.

C H A P T E R  7   Unemployment and the Labor Market  | 187
 7-2   Job Search and Frictional 
Unemployment
One reason for unemployment is that it takes time to match workers and jobs. 
The equilibrium model of the aggregate labor market discussed in Chapter 3 
assumes that all workers and all jobs are identical and, therefore, that all workers 
are equally well suited to all jobs. If this were true and the labor market were in 
equilibrium, then a job loss would not cause unemployment: a laid-off worker 
would immediately find a new job at the market wage.
In fact, workers have different preferences and abilities, and jobs have dif­
ferent attributes. Furthermore, the flow of information about job candidates 
and job vacancies is imperfect, and the geographic mobility of workers is not 
instantaneous. For all these reasons, searching for an appropriate job takes time 
and effort, and this tends to reduce the rate of job finding. Indeed, because 
different jobs require different skills and pay different wages, unemployed 
workers may not accept the first job offer they receive. The unemployment 
caused by the time it takes workers to search for a job is called frictional 
­unemployment.
Causes of Frictional Unemployment
Some frictional unemployment is inevitable in a changing economy. For 
many reasons, the types of goods that firms and households demand vary over 
time. As the demand for goods shifts, so does the demand for the labor that 
produces those goods. The invention of the personal computer, for example, 
reduced the demand for typewriters and the demand for labor by typewriter 
manufacturers. At the same time, it increased the demand for labor in the 
electronics industry. Similarly, because different regions produce different 
goods, the demand for labor may be rising in one part of the country and 
falling in another. An increase in the price of oil may cause the demand 
for labor to rise in oil-producing states such as Texas, but because expen­
sive oil means expensive gasoline, it makes driving less attractive and may 
decrease the demand for labor in auto-producing states such as Michigan. 
Economists call a change in the composition of demand among industries 
or regions a sectoral shift. Because sectoral shifts are always occurring, and 
because it takes time for workers to change sectors, there is always frictional 
­unemployment.
Sectoral shifts are not the only cause of job separation and frictional unem­
ployment. In addition, workers find themselves unexpectedly out of work when 
their firms fail, when their job performance is deemed unacceptable, or when 
their particular skills are no longer needed. Workers also may quit their jobs to 
change careers or to move to different parts of the country. Regardless of the 
cause of the job separation, it will take time and effort for the worker to find a 
new job. As long as the supply and demand for labor among firms is changing, 
frictional unemployment is unavoidable.

Public Policy and Frictional Unemployment
Many public policies seek to decrease the natural rate of unemployment by 
reducing frictional unemployment. Government employment agencies dis­
seminate information about job vacancies to match jobs and workers more 
efficiently. Publicly funded retraining programs are designed to ease the transi­
tion of workers from declining to growing industries. If these programs suc­
ceed at increasing the rate of job finding, they decrease the natural rate of 
­unemployment.
Other government programs inadvertently increase the amount of frictional 
unemployment. One of these is unemployment insurance. Under this pro­
gram, unemployed workers can collect a fraction of their wages for a certain 
period after losing their jobs. Although the precise terms of the program differ 
from year to year and from state to state, a typical worker covered by unemploy­
ment insurance in the United States receives 50 percent of her former wages for 
26 weeks. In many European countries, unemployment-insurance programs are 
significantly more generous.
By softening the economic hardship of unemployment, unemployment 
insurance increases the amount of frictional unemployment and raises the 
natural rate. The unemployed who receive unemployment-insurance benefits 
are less pressed to search for new employment and are more likely to turn 
down unattractive job offers. Both of these changes in behavior reduce the 
rate of job finding. In addition, because workers know that their incomes 
are partially protected by unemployment insurance, they are less likely to 
seek jobs with stable employment prospects and are less likely to bargain 
for guarantees of job security. These behavioral changes raise the rate of job 
separation.
That unemployment insurance raises the natural rate of unemployment does 
not necessarily imply that the policy is ill advised. The program has the ben­
efit of reducing workers’ uncertainty about their incomes. Moreover, inducing 
workers to reject unattractive job offers may lead to better matches between 
workers and jobs. Evaluating the costs and benefits of different systems of 
unemployment insurance is a difficult task that continues to be a topic of much 
research.
Economists often propose reforms to the unemployment-insurance system that 
would reduce the amount of unemployment. One common proposal is to require 
a firm that lays off a worker to bear the full cost of that worker’s unemployment 
benefits. Such a system is called 100 percent experience rated, because the rate that each 
firm pays into the unemployment-insurance system fully reflects the unemploy­
ment experience of its own workers. Most current programs are partially experience 
rated. Under this system, when a firm lays off a worker, it is charged for only part 
of the worker’s unemployment benefits; the remainder comes from the program’s 
general revenue. Because a firm pays only a fraction of the cost of the unemploy­
ment it causes, it has an incentive to lay off workers when its demand for labor is 
temporarily low. By reducing that incentive, the proposed reform may reduce the 
prevalence of temporary layoffs.

Unemployment Insurance and the Rate of 
Job Finding
Many studies have examined the effect of unemployment insurance on job 
search. The most persuasive studies use data on the experiences of unemployed 
individuals rather than economy-wide rates of unemployment. Individual data 
often yield sharp results that are open to few alternative explanations.
One study followed the experience of individual workers as they used up their 
eligibility for unemployment-insurance benefits. It found that when unemployed 
workers become ineligible for benefits, they are more likely to find jobs. In 
particular, the probability of a person finding a job more than doubles when his 
or her benefits run out. One possible explanation is that an absence of benefits 
increases the search effort of unemployed workers. Another possibility is that 
workers without benefits are more likely to accept job offers they would other­
wise decline because of low wages or poor working conditions.2
Additional evidence on how economic incentives affect job search comes from 
an experiment that the state of Illinois ran in 1985. Randomly selected new claim­
ants for unemployment insurance were each offered a $500 bonus if they found 
employment within 11 weeks. The subsequent experience of this group was com­
pared to that of a control group not offered the incentive. The average duration of 
unemployment for the group offered the $500 bonus was 17.0 weeks, compared 
to 18.3 weeks for the control group. Thus, the prospect of earning the bonus 
reduced the average spell of unemployment by 7 percent, suggesting that more 
effort was devoted to job search. This experiment shows clearly that the incentives 
provided by the unemployment-insurance system affect the rate of job finding.3 n

 7-3   Real-Wage Rigidity and Structural 
Unemployment
A second reason for unemployment is wage rigidity—the failure of wages to 
adjust to a level at which labor supply equals labor demand. In the equilibrium 
model of the labor market, as outlined in Chapter 3, the real wage adjusts to 
equilibrate labor supply and labor demand. Yet wages are not always flexible. 
Sometimes the real wage is stuck above the market-clearing level.
Figure 7-3 shows why wage rigidity leads to unemployment. When the real 
wage is above the level that equilibrates supply and demand, the quantity of labor 
supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. Firms must in some way ration the

Unemployment Outcomes,” Quarterly Journal of Economics 105 (November 1990): 973–1002.

Unemployment: Randomized Trials in Illinois,” American Economic Review 77 (September 1987): 513–530.

190 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
scarce jobs among workers. Real-wage rigidity reduces the rate of job finding 
and raises the level of unemployment.
The unemployment resulting from wage rigidity and job rationing is some­
times called structural unemployment. Workers are unemployed not because 
they are actively searching for the jobs that best suit their individual skills but 
because there is a fundamental mismatch between the number of people who 
want to work and the number of jobs that are available. At the going wage, the 
quantity of labor supplied exceeds the quantity of labor demanded; many work­
ers are simply waiting for jobs to open up.
To understand wage rigidity and structural unemployment, we must examine 
why the labor market does not clear. When the real wage exceeds the equilibrium 
level and the supply of workers exceeds the demand, we might expect firms to lower 
the wages they pay. Structural unemployment arises because firms fail to reduce 
wages despite an excess supply of labor. We now turn to three causes of this wage 
rigidity: minimum-wage laws, the monopoly power of unions, and efficiency wages.
Minimum-Wage Laws
The government causes wage rigidity when it prevents wages from falling to equi­
librium levels. Minimum-wage laws set a legal minimum on the wages that firms pay 
their employees. Since the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the U.S. 
federal government has enforced a minimum wage that has usually been between 
30 and 50 percent of the average wage in manufacturing. In addition, many states 
enact minimum wages that are higher than the federal one: for example, in 2014, 
when the federal minimum wage was $7.25 per hour, California had a minimum

wage of $9.00 per hour. For most workers, the minimum wage is not binding, 
because they earn well above the legislated minimum. Yet for some workers, espe­
cially the unskilled and inexperienced, the minimum wage raises their wage above its 
equilibrium level and, therefore, reduces the quantity of their labor that firms demand.
Economists believe that the minimum wage has its greatest impact on teen­
age unemployment. The equilibrium wages of teenagers tend to be low for two 
reasons. First, because teenagers are among the least skilled and least experienced 
members of the labor force, they tend to have low marginal productivity. Second, 
teenagers often take some of their “compensation” in the form of on-the-job 
training rather than direct pay. An internship is a classic example of training 
offered in place of wages. For both these reasons, the wage at which the supply 
of teenage workers equals the demand is low. The minimum wage is therefore 
more often binding for teenagers than for others in the labor force.
Many economists have studied the impact of the minimum wage on teen­
age employment. These researchers compare the variation in the minimum 
wage over time with the variation in the number of teenagers with jobs. These 
studies find that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduces teenage 
­employment by 1 to 3 percent.4
The minimum wage is a perennial source of political debate. Advocates of a higher 
minimum wage view it as a way to raise the income of the working poor. Certainly, 
the minimum wage provides only a meager standard of living: in the United States, 
a single parent with one child working full time at a minimum-wage job would fall 
below the official poverty level for a family of that size. Although minimum-wage 
advocates often admit that the policy causes unemployment for some workers, they 
argue that this cost is worth bearing to raise others out of poverty.
Opponents of a higher minimum wage claim that it is not the best way to help 
the working poor. They contend not only that the increased labor costs raise unem­
ployment but also that the minimum wage is poorly targeted. Many minimum-
wage earners are teenagers from middle-class homes working for discretionary 
spending money, rather than heads of households working to support their families.
Many economists and policymakers believe that tax credits are a better way 
to increase the incomes of the working poor. The earned income tax credit is an 
amount that poor working families are allowed to subtract from the taxes they 
owe. For a family with very low income, the credit exceeds its taxes, and the 
family receives a payment from the government. Unlike the minimum wage, 
the earned income tax credit does not raise labor costs to firms and, therefore, 
does not reduce the quantity of labor that firms demand. It has the disadvantage, 
however, of reducing the government’s tax revenue.

mer 1988): 133–146. Brown presents the mainstream view of the effects of minimum wages, but it 
should be noted that the magnitude of employment effects is controversial. For research suggesting 
negligible employment effects, see David Card and Alan Krueger, Myth and Measurement: The New 
Economics of the Minimum Wage (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1995); and Lawrence Katz

Relations Review 46 (October 1992): 6–21. For research suggesting the opposite conclusion, see David 
Neumark and William Wascher, “Employment Effects of Minimum and Subminimum Wages: Panel 
Data on State Minimum Wage Laws,” Industrial and Labor Relations Review 46 (October 1992): 55–81.

The Characteristics of Minimum-Wage Workers
Who earns the minimum wage? The question can be answered using the Cur­
rent Population Survey, the labor-market survey used to calculate the unem­
ployment rate and many other statistics. In 2014, the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
released a report describing the workers who earned at or below the minimum 
wage in 2013, when the prevailing minimum wage was $7.25 per hour. Here is 
a summary:
n	 About 76 million American workers are paid hourly, representing 59 percent 
of all wage and salary workers. Of these workers, 1.5 million reported earning 
exactly the prevailing minimum wage, and another 1.8 million reported earn­
ing less. A reported wage below the minimum is possible because some work­
ers are exempt from the statute (newspaper delivery workers, for example), 
because enforcement is imperfect, and because some workers round down 
when reporting their wages on surveys.
n	 Minimum-wage workers are more likely to be women than men. About 
3 percent of men and 5 percent of women reported wages at or below the 
prevailing federal minimum.
n	 Minimum-wage workers tend to be young. About half of all hourly-paid 
workers earning the minimum wage or less were under age 25. Among teen­
agers, about 20 percent earned the minimum wage or less, compared with 
about 3 percent of workers age 25 and over.
n	 Minimum-wage workers tend to be less educated. Among hourly-paid work­
ers age 16 and over, about 10 percent of those without a high school diploma 
earned the minimum wage or less, compared with 4 percent of those with a 
high school diploma and 2 percent of those with a college degree.
n	 Minimum-wage workers are more likely to be working part time. Among 
part-time workers (those who usually work less than 35 hours per week), 
10 percent were paid the minimum wage or less, compared to 2 percent of 
full-time workers.
n	 The industry with the highest proportion of workers with reported hourly 
wages at or below the minimum wage was leisure and hospitality (about 
19 percent). Just over one-half of all workers paid at or below the minimum 
wage were employed in this industry, primarily in food services and drink­
ing places. For many of these workers, tips supplement the hourly wages 
received.
These facts by themselves do not tell us whether the minimum wage is a good or 
bad policy, or whether it is too high or too low. But when evaluating any public 
policy, it is useful to keep in mind those individuals who are affected by it.5 n

Unions and Collective Bargaining
A second cause of wage rigidity is the monopoly power of unions. Table 7-1 
shows the importance of unions in several major countries. In the United States, 
only 13 percent of workers have their wages set through collective bargaining. 
In most European countries, unions play a much larger role.
The wages of unionized workers are determined not by the equilibrium of 
supply and demand but by bargaining between union leaders and firm manage­
ment. Often, the final agreement raises the wage above the equilibrium level and 
allows the firm to decide how many workers to employ. The result is a reduction 
in the number of workers hired, a lower rate of job finding, and an increase in 
structural unemployment.
Unions can also influence the wages paid by firms whose workforces are not 
unionized because the threat of unionization can keep wages above the equi­
librium level. Most firms dislike unions. Unions not only raise wages but also 
increase the bargaining power of labor on many other issues, such as hours of 
employment and working conditions. A firm may choose to pay its workers high 
wages to keep them happy and discourage them from forming a union.
The unemployment caused by unions and by the threat of unionization 
is an instance of conflict between different groups of workers—insiders and 
outsiders. Those workers already employed by a firm, the insiders, typically try to 
keep their firm’s wages high. The unemployed, the outsiders, bear part of the cost

of higher wages because at a lower wage they might be hired. These two groups 
inevitably have conflicting interests. The effect of any bargaining process on wages 
and employment depends crucially on the relative influence of each group.
The conflict between insiders and outsiders is resolved differently in different coun­
tries. In some countries, such as the United States, wage bargaining takes place at the 
level of the firm or plant. In other countries, such as Sweden, wage bargaining takes 
place at the national level—with the government often playing a key role. Despite a 
highly unionized labor force, Sweden has not experienced extraordinarily high unem­
ployment throughout its history. One possible explanation is that the centralization of 
wage bargaining and the role of the government in the bargaining process give more 
influence to the outsiders, which keeps wages closer to the equilibrium level.
Efficiency Wages
Efficiency-wage theories propose a third cause of wage rigidity in addition 
to minimum-wage laws and unionization. These theories hold that high wages 
make workers more productive. The influence of wages on worker efficiency 
may explain the failure of firms to cut wages despite an excess supply of labor. 
Even though a wage reduction would lower a firm’s wage bill, it would also—if 
these theories are correct—lower worker productivity and the firm’s profits.
Economists have proposed various theories to explain how wages affect 
worker productivity. One efficiency-wage theory, which is applied mostly to 
poorer countries, holds that wages influence nutrition. Better-paid workers 
can afford a more nutritious diet, and healthier workers are more productive. 
A firm may decide to pay a wage above the equilibrium level to maintain a 
healthy workforce. Obviously, this consideration is not important for employers 
in wealthier countries, such as the United States and most of Europe, because 
the equilibrium wage is well above the level necessary to maintain good health.
A second efficiency-wage theory, which is more relevant for developed coun­
tries, holds that high wages reduce labor turnover. Workers quit jobs for many 
reasons—to accept better positions at other firms, to change careers, or to move 
to other parts of the country. The more a firm pays its workers, the greater is 
their incentive to stay with the firm. By paying a high wage, a firm reduces the 
frequency at which its workers quit, thereby decreasing the time and money 
spent hiring and training new workers.
A third efficiency-wage theory holds that the average quality of a firm’s work­
force depends on the wage it pays its employees. If a firm reduces its wage, the best 
employees may take jobs elsewhere, leaving the firm with inferior employees who 
have fewer alternative opportunities. Economists recognize this unfavorable sort­
ing as an example of adverse selection—the tendency of people with more infor­
mation (in this case, the workers, who know their own outside opportunities) to 
self-select in a way that disadvantages people with less information (the firm). By 
paying a wage above the equilibrium level, the firm may reduce adverse selection, 
improve the average quality of its workforce, and thereby increase productivity.
A fourth efficiency-wage theory holds that a high wage improves worker effort. 
This theory posits that firms cannot perfectly monitor their employees’ work effort

Henry Ford’s $5 Workday
In 1914 the Ford Motor Company started paying its workers $5 per day. The 
prevailing wage at the time was between $2 and $3 per day, so Ford’s wage was 
well above the equilibrium level. Not surprisingly, long lines of job seekers 
waited outside the Ford plant gates hoping for a chance to earn this high wage.
What was Ford’s motive? Henry Ford later wrote, “We wanted to pay these 
wages so that the business would be on a lasting foundation. We were building for 
the future. A low wage business is always insecure. . . . The payment of five dollars a 
day for an eight hour day was one of the finest cost-cutting moves we ever made.”
From the standpoint of traditional economic theory, Ford’s explanation seems 
peculiar. He was suggesting that high wages imply low costs. But perhaps Ford 
had discovered efficiency-wage theory. Perhaps he was using the high wage to 
increase worker productivity.
Evidence suggests that paying such a high wage did benefit the company. 
According to an engineering report written at the time, “The Ford high wage does 
away with all the inertia and living force resistance. . . . The workingmen are abso­
lutely docile, and it is safe to say that since the last day of 1913, every single day has 
seen major reductions in Ford shops’ labor costs.” Absenteeism fell by 75 percent, 
suggesting a large increase in worker effort. Alan Nevins, a historian who studied 
the early Ford Motor Company, wrote, “Ford and his associates freely declared on 
many occasions that the high wage policy had turned out to be good business. By 
this they meant that it had improved the discipline of the workers, given them a 
more loyal interest in the institution, and raised their personal efficiency.”7 n
6For more extended discussions of efficiency wages, see Janet Yellen, “Efficiency Wage Models of 
Unemployment,” American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings (May 1984): 200–205; and Lawrence 
Katz, “Efficiency Wages: A Partial Evaluation,” NBER Macroeconomics Annual (1986): 235–276.

to Industrial Policy, Discrimination, and Keynesian Unemployment,” Journal of Labor Economics 
4 (July 1986): 376–414; Daniel M. G. Raff and Lawrence H. Summers, “Did Henry Ford Pay 
Efficiency Wages?” Journal of Labor Economics 5 (October 1987, Part 2): S57–S86.
and that employees must themselves decide how hard to work. Workers can choose 
to work hard, or they can choose to shirk and risk getting caught and fired. Econo­
mists recognize this possibility as an example of moral hazard—the tendency of peo­
ple to behave inappropriately when their behavior is imperfectly monitored. The 
firm can reduce the problem of moral hazard by paying a high wage. The higher the 
wage, the greater the cost to the worker of getting fired. By paying a higher wage, a 
firm induces more of its employees not to shirk and thus increases their productivity.
Although these four efficiency-wage theories differ in detail, they share a 
common theme: because a firm operates more efficiently if it pays its workers 
a high wage, the firm may find it profitable to keep wages above the level that 
balances supply and demand. The result of this higher-than-equilibrium wage is 
a lower rate of job finding and greater unemployment.6

 7-4   Labor-Market Experience:
The United States
So far we have developed the theory behind the natural rate of unemployment. 
We began by showing that the economy’s steady-state unemployment rate depends 
on the rates of job separation and job finding. Then we discussed two reasons that 
job finding is not instantaneous: the process of job search (which leads to frictional 
unemployment) and wage rigidity (which leads to structural unemployment). Wage 
rigidity, in turn, arises from minimum-wage laws, unionization, and efficiency wages.
With these theories as background, we now examine some additional facts 
about unemployment, focusing at first on the case of American labor markets. 
These facts will help us to evaluate our theories and assess public policies aimed 
at reducing unemployment.
The Duration of Unemployment
When a person becomes unemployed, is the spell of unemployment likely to 
be short or long? The answer to this question is important because it indicates 
the reasons for the unemployment and what policy response is appropriate. On 
the one hand, if most unemployment is short-term, one might argue that it is 
frictional and perhaps unavoidable. Unemployed workers may need some time 
to search for the job that is best suited to their skills and tastes. On the other 
hand, long-term unemployment cannot easily be attributed to the time it takes 
to match jobs and workers: we would not expect this matching process to take 
many months. Long-term unemployment is more likely to be structural unem­
ployment, representing a mismatch between the number of jobs available and the 
number of people who want to work. Thus, data on the duration of unemploy­
ment can affect our view about the reasons for unemployment.
The answer to our question turns out to be subtle. The data show that many 
spells of unemployment are short but that most weeks of unemployment are 
attributable to the long-term unemployed. For example, during the period from 
1990 to 2006, 38 percent of unemployed people were unemployed for less than 
4 weeks, while only 31 percent were unemployed for more than 15 weeks. How­
ever, 71 percent of the total amount of time spent unemployed was experienced 
by those who were unemployed for more than 15 weeks, while only 7 percent of 
the time spent unemployed was experienced by people who were unemployed 
for less than 4 weeks.
To see how these facts can all be true, consider an extreme but simple example. 
Suppose that 10 people are unemployed for part of a given year. Of these 10 peo­
ple, 8 are unemployed for 1 month and 2 are unemployed for 12 months, totaling 
32 months of unemployment. In this example, most spells of unemployment are 
short: 8 of the 10 unemployment spells, or 80 percent, end in 1 month. Yet most 
months of unemployment are attributable to the long-term unemployed: 24 of 
the 32 months of unemployment, or 75 percent, are experienced by the 2 work­
ers who are each unemployed for 12 months. Depending on whether we look at 
spells of unemployment or months of unemployment, most unemployment can 
appear to be either short-term or long-term.

C H A P T E R  7   Unemployment and the Labor Market  | 197
This evidence on the duration of unemployment has an important implica­
tion for public policy. If the goal is to substantially lower the natural rate of 
unemployment, policies must aim at the long-term unemployed, because these 
individuals account for a large amount of unemployment. Yet policies must be 
carefully targeted, because the long-term unemployed constitute a small minor­
ity of those who become unemployed. Most people who become unemployed 
find work within a short time.

The Increase in U.S. Long-Term Unemployment 
and the Debate Over Unemployment Insurance
In 2008 and 2009, as the U.S. economy experienced a deep recession, the labor 
market demonstrated a new and striking phenomenon: a large upward spike 
in the duration of unemployment. Figure 7-4 shows the median duration of 
unemployment for jobless workers from 1967 to 2014. Recessions are indicated 
by shaded areas. The figure shows that the duration of unemployment typically 
rises during recessions. The huge increase during the recession of 2008–2009, 
however, is without precedent in modern history.
What explains this phenomenon? Economists fall into two camps.

198 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
Some economists believe that the increase in long-term unemployment is a 
result of government policies. In particular, in February 2009, when the depth 
of the recession was apparent, Congress extended the eligibility for unemploy­
ment insurance from the normal 26 weeks to 99 weeks, and it did not allow this 
program of extended benefits to expire until January 2014. Extending unem­
ployment-insurance benefits is typical during recessions, because jobs are harder 
to find, but the extension to nearly two years was extraordinary.
Harvard economist Robert Barro wrote an article in the August 30, 2010, 
issue of the Wall Street Journal titled “The Folly of Subsidizing Unemployment.” 
According to Barro, “the dramatic expansion of unemployment insurance eligi­
bility to 99 weeks is almost surely the culprit” responsible for the rise in long-
term unemployment. He writes:
Generous unemployment insurance programs have been found to raise unem­
ployment in many Western European countries in which unemployment rates 
have been far higher than the current U.S. rate. In Europe, the influence has 
worked particularly through increases in long-term unemployment.
Barro concludes that the “reckless expansion of unemployment-insurance cover­
age to 99 weeks was unwise economically and politically.”
Other economists, however, are skeptical that these government policies are to 
blame. In their opinion, the extraordinary increase in eligibility for unemploy­
ment insurance was a reasonable and compassionate response to a historically 
deep economic downturn and weak labor market.
Here is Princeton economist Paul Krugman, writing in a July 4, 2010, 
New York Times article titled “Punishing the Jobless”:
Do unemployment benefits reduce the incentive to seek work? Yes: workers 
receiving unemployment benefits aren’t quite as desperate as workers without 
benefits, and are likely to be slightly more choosy about accepting new jobs. 
The operative word here is “slightly”: recent economic research suggests that 
the effect of unemployment benefits on worker behavior is much weaker than 
was previously believed. Still, it’s a real effect when the economy is doing well.
But it’s an effect that is completely irrelevant to our current situation. When 
the economy is booming, and lack of sufficient willing workers is limiting 
growth, generous unemployment benefits may keep employment lower than it 
would have been otherwise. But as you may have noticed, right now the econ­
omy isn’t booming—there are five unemployed workers for every job opening. 
Cutting off benefits to the unemployed will make them even more desperate 
for work—but they can’t take jobs that aren’t there.
Wait: there’s more. One main reason there aren’t enough jobs right now is 
weak consumer demand. Helping the unemployed, by putting money in the 
pockets of people who badly need it, helps support consumer spending.8
Barro and Krugman are both prominent economists, but they have diametri­
cally opposed views about this fundamental policy debate. The cause of the spike 
in U.S. long-term unemployment remains an unsettled debate. n

Variation in the Unemployment Rate Across

The rate of unemployment varies substantially across different groups within the 
population. Table 7-2 presents the U.S. unemployment rates for different demo­
graphic groups in 2014, when the overall unemployment rate was 6.2 percent.
This table shows that younger workers have much higher unemployment 
rates than older ones. To explain this difference, recall our model of the natural 
rate of unemployment. The model isolates two possible causes for a high rate of 
unemployment: a low rate of job finding and a high rate of job separation. When 
economists study data on the transition of individuals between employment and 
unemployment, they find that those groups with high unemployment tend to 
have high rates of job separation. They find less variation across groups in the rate 
of job finding. For example, an employed white male is four times more likely 
to become unemployed if he is a teenager than if he is middle-aged; once he is 
unemployed, his rate of job finding is not closely related to his age.
These findings help explain the higher unemployment rates for younger 
workers. Younger workers have only recently entered the labor market, and they 
are often uncertain about their career plans. It may be best for them to try differ­
ent types of jobs before making a long-term commitment to a specific occupa­
tion. If they do so, we should expect a higher rate of job separation and a higher 
rate of frictional unemployment for this group.
Another fact that stands out from Table 7-2 is that unemployment rates are 
much higher for blacks than for whites. This phenomenon is not well under­
stood. Data on transitions between employment and unemployment show that 
the higher unemployment rates for blacks, especially for black teenagers, arise 
because of both higher rates of job separation and lower rates of job finding. 
Possible reasons for the lower rates of job finding include less access to informal 
job-finding networks and discrimination by employers.
Transitions Into and Out of the Labor Force
So far we have ignored an important aspect of labor-market dynamics: the move­
ment of individuals into and out of the labor force. Our model of the natural 
rate of unemployment assumes that the labor force is fixed. In this case, the

sole reason for unemployment is job separation, and the sole reason for leaving 
unemployment is job finding.
In fact, movements into and out of the labor force are important. About 
one-third of the unemployed have only recently entered the labor force. Some 
of these entrants are young workers still looking for their first jobs; others have 
worked before but had temporarily left the labor force. In addition, not all 
­unemployment ends with job finding: almost half of all spells of unemployment 
end in the unemployed person’s withdrawal from the labor market.
Individuals entering and leaving the labor force make unemployment statistics 
more difficult to interpret. On the one hand, some individuals calling themselves 
unemployed may not be seriously looking for jobs and perhaps should best be 
viewed as out of the labor force. Their “unemployment” may not represent a social 
problem. On the other hand, some individuals may want jobs but, after unsuccess­
ful searches, have given up looking. These discouraged workers are counted as 
being out of the labor force and do not show up in unemployment statistics. Even 
though their joblessness is unmeasured, it may nonetheless be a social problem.
Because of these and many other issues that complicate the interpretation of 
the unemployment data, the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates several measures 
of labor underutilization. Table 7-3 gives the definitions and their values as of 
October 2014. The measures range from 2.8 to 11.5 percent, depending on the 
characteristics one uses to classify a worker as not fully employed.

but indicate that they want and are available for a job and have looked for work sometime in 
the recent past. Discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached, have given a job-market-
related reason for not currently looking for a job. Persons employed part time for economic reasons are 
those who want and are available for full-time work but have had to settle for a part-time schedule.

The Decline in Labor-Force Participation: 2007 to 2014
One of the more striking recent developments in the U.S. labor market is the 
decline in labor-force participation. Figure 7-5 illustrates the phenomenon. From 
1990 to 2007, the labor-force participation rate fluctuated in a narrow range 
between about 66 and 67 percent. But then it started a gradual but significant 
decline. From the fourth quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2014, the labor-
force participation rate fell from 66.1 percent to 63.0 percent. As a result of this 
change, about 7 million fewer Americans were working or looking for work in 
2014 than otherwise would have been the case.
What explains the decline of 3.1 percentage points in the labor-force par­
ticipation rate? To answer this question, a natural place to start is to study those 
individuals not in the labor force to see why they are not working or looking for 
work. Economist Shigeru Fujita of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia has 
done exactly that using the data in the Current Population Survey.
His findings, summarized in Table 7-4, allocate the 3.1 percentage points 
among five categories:
n	 An increase in retired workers accounts for 1.4 percentage points.
n	 An increase in disabled workers accounts for 0.8 percentage points.
n	 An increase in discouraged workers accounts for 0.4 percentage points.

n	 An increase in those not wanting a job because they are in school 
accounts for 0.5 percentage points.
n	 The “other” category—those outside the labor force who are not retired, dis­
abled, discouraged, or in school, such as full-time parents—accounts for none 
of the change. In fact, this last category went slightly in the other direction.
With this decomposition in hand, we can discuss some of the forces at work.
According to the numbers in Table 7-4, retirement explains the largest share 
of the increase in nonparticipation, accounting for almost half the change. The 
increase in the number of retired workers is largely due to the aging of the large 
baby-boom generation. The baby boom started in 1946, just after World War II as 
soldiers returned home and started families, and continued until 1964. The first 
of the baby boomers turned 62—the earliest age at which a person can start col­
lecting Social Security retirement benefits—in 2008. So far, we have seen just the 
tip of a sizeable iceberg: as more baby boomers reach retirement age in the years 
to come, the labor-force participation rate will probably continue to decline.
Another force at work is that during much of the period from 2007 to 2014, 
the economy was weak. Because of a financial crisis and deep recession (a topic 
discussed in detail in Chapters 12 and 20), unemployment, especially long-term 
unemployment, was high. The lack of good job opportunities during this time 
certainly increased the number of discouraged workers. But it likely influenced 
people in many other ways as well. When the options offered by the labor mar­
ket are poor, the alternatives to work look better by comparison. In particular, 
the weak labor market may have induced older workers to retire earlier, workers 
with infirmities to apply for disability benefits more quickly, and students to stay 
in school longer. All of these effects reduced labor-force participation.
To be sure, these developments are not entirely adverse. For the elderly, 
retirement is often a welcome change in lifestyle after a lifetime of toil. For the 
young, staying in school is often a sensible investment in human capital. Yet the 
decline in labor-force participation does have a cost. With a smaller labor force, 
the economy naturally produces a smaller output of goods and services, which 
in turn means a lower level of real GDP. n

 7-5   Labor-Market Experience: Europe
Although our discussion has focused largely on the United States, many fas­
cinating and sometimes puzzling phenomena become apparent when econo­
mists compare the experiences of Americans in the labor market with those of 
Europeans.
The Rise in European Unemployment
Figure 7-6 shows the rate of unemployment from 1960 to 2012 in the four 
largest European countries—France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. 
As you can see, the rate of unemployment in these countries has risen substan­
tially. For France, for example, unemployment averaged below 2 percent in the 
1960s and above 8 percent in recent years.
What is the cause of rising European unemployment? No one knows for 
sure, but there is a leading theory. Many economists believe that the problem can 
be traced to the interaction between a long-standing policy and a more recent 
shock. The long-standing policy is generous benefits for unemployed workers. 
The recent shock is a technologically driven fall in the demand for unskilled 
workers relative to skilled workers.

204 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
There is no question that most European countries have generous programs 
for those without jobs. These programs go by various names: social insurance, 
the welfare state, or simply “the dole.” Many countries allow the unemployed 
to collect benefits for years, rather than for only a short period of time as in the 
United States. In some sense, those living on the dole are really out of the labor 
force: given the employment opportunities available, taking a job is less attractive 
than remaining without work. Yet these people are often counted as unemployed 
in government statistics.
There is also no question that the demand for unskilled workers has fallen 
relative to the demand for skilled workers. This change in demand is probably 
due to changes in technology: computers, for example, increase the demand for 
workers who can use them and reduce the demand for those who cannot. In the 
United States, this change in demand has been reflected in wages rather than 
unemployment: over the past three decades, the wages of unskilled workers have 
fallen substantially relative to the wages of skilled workers. In Europe, however, 
the welfare state provides unskilled workers with an alternative to working for 
low wages. As the wages of unskilled workers fall, more workers view the dole as 
their best available option. The result is higher unemployment.
This diagnosis of high European unemployment does not suggest an easy 
remedy. Reducing the magnitude of government benefits for the unemployed 
would encourage workers to get off the dole and accept low-wage jobs. But it 
would also exacerbate economic inequality—the very problem that welfare-state 
policies were designed to address.9
Unemployment Variation Within Europe
Europe is not a single labor market but is, instead, a collection of national labor 
markets, separated not only by national borders but also by differences in culture 
and language. Because these countries differ in their labor-market policies and 
institutions, variation within Europe provides a useful perspective on the causes 
of unemployment. Many empirical studies have, therefore, focused on these 
international differences.
The first noteworthy fact is that the unemployment rate varies substantially 
from country to country. For example, in March 2014, when the unemployment 
rate was 6.7 percent in the United States, it was 5.1 percent in Germany and 
25.3 percent in Spain. Although in recent years average unemployment has been 
higher in Europe than in the United States, many Europeans live in nations with 
unemployment rates lower than the U.S. rate.
A second notable fact is that much of the variation in unemployment rates is 
attributable to the long-term unemployed. The unemployment rate can be separated 
into two pieces—the percentage of the labor force that has been unemployed for 
9For more discussion of these issues, see Paul Krugman, “Past and Prospective Causes of High 
Unemployment,” in Reducing Unemployment: Current Issues and Policy Options, Federal Reserve Bank 
of Kansas City, August 1994.

C H A P T E R  7   Unemployment and the Labor Market  | 205
less than a year and the percentage of the labor force that has been unemployed for 
more than a year. The long-term unemployment rate exhibits more variability from 
country to country than does the short-term unemployment rate.
National unemployment rates are correlated with a variety of labor-market 
policies. Unemployment rates are higher in nations with more generous unem­
ployment insurance, as measured by the replacement rate—the percentage of 
previous wages that is replaced when a worker loses a job. In addition, nations 
tend to have higher unemployment, especially higher long-term unemployment, 
if benefits can be collected for longer periods of time.
Although government spending on unemployment insurance seems to 
raise unemployment, spending on “active” labor-market policies appears to 
decrease it. These active labor-market policies include job training, assistance 
with job search, and subsidized employment. Spain, for instance, has historically 
had a high rate of unemployment, a fact that can be explained by the com­
bination of generous payments to the unemployed with minimal assistance at 
helping them find new jobs.
The role of unions also varies from country to country, as we saw in Table 7-1. 
This fact also helps explain differences in labor-market outcomes. National 
unemployment rates are positively correlated with the percentage of the labor 
force whose wages are set by collective bargaining with unions. The adverse 
impact of unions on unemployment is smaller, however, in nations where there 
is substantial coordination among employers in bargaining with unions, perhaps 
because coordination may moderate the upward pressure on wages.
A word of warning: correlation does not imply causation, so empirical results 
such as these should be interpreted with caution. But they do suggest that a 
nation’s unemployment rate, rather than being immutable, is instead a function 
of the choices a nation makes.10
The Rise of European Leisure
Higher unemployment rates in Europe are part of the larger phenomenon that 
Europeans typically work fewer hours than do their American counterparts. 
Figure 7-7 presents some data on how many hours a typical person works in the 
United States, France, and Germany. In the early 1970s, the number of hours 
worked was about the same in each of these countries. But since then, the num­
ber of hours has stayed level in the United States, while it has declined substan­
tially in Europe. Today, the typical American works many more hours than the 
typical resident of these two western European countries.
The difference in hours worked reflects two facts. First, the average employed 
person in the United States works more hours per year than the average employed 
person in Europe. Europeans typically enjoy shorter workweeks and more fre­
quent holidays. Second, more potential workers are employed in the United States.

Journal of Economic Perspectives 11 (September 1997): 55–74.

206 |  P A R T  I I   Classical Theory: The Economy in the Long Run
That is, the employment-to-population ratio is higher in the United States than 
it is in Europe. Higher unemployment is one reason for the lower employment-
to-population ratio in Europe. Another reason is earlier retirement in Europe and 
thus lower labor-force participation among older workers.
What is the underlying cause of these differences in work patterns? Econo­
mists have proposed several hypotheses.
Edward Prescott, the 2004 winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, has 
concluded that “virtually all of the large differences between U.S. labor supply 
and those of Germany and France are due to differences in tax systems.” This 
hypothesis is consistent with two facts: (1) Europeans face higher tax rates than 
Americans, and (2) European tax rates have risen significantly over the past 
several decades. Some economists take these facts as powerful evidence for the 
impact of taxes on work effort. Yet others are skeptical, arguing that to explain 
the difference in hours worked by tax rates alone requires an implausibly large 
elasticity of labor supply.
A related hypothesis is that the difference in observed work effort may be 
attributable to the underground economy. When tax rates are high, people have 
a greater incentive to work “off the books” to evade taxes. For obvious reasons, 
data on the underground economy are hard to come by. But economists who 
study the subject believe the underground economy is larger in Europe than it is 
in the United States. This fact suggests that the difference in actual hours worked,

including work in the underground economy, may be smaller than the difference 
in measured hours worked.
Another hypothesis stresses the role of unions. As we have seen, collective 
bargaining is more important in European than in U.S. labor markets. Unions 
often push for shorter workweeks in contract negotiations, and they lobby the 
government for a variety of labor-market regulations, such as official holidays. 
Economists Alberto Alesina, Edward Glaeser, and Bruce Sacerdote conclude that 
“mandated holidays can explain 80 percent of the difference in weeks worked 
between the U.S. and Europe and 30 percent of the difference in total labor 
supply between the two regions.” They suggest that Prescott may overstate the 
role of taxes because, looking across countries, tax rates and unionization rates 
are positively correlated; as a result, the effects of high taxes and the effects of 
widespread unionization are hard to disentangle.
A final hypothesis emphasizes the possibility of different preferences. As tech­
nological advance and economic growth have made all advanced countries rich­
er, people around the world must decide whether to take the greater prosperity 
in the form of increased consumption of goods and services or increased leisure. 
According to economist Olivier Blanchard, “the main difference [between 
the continents] is that Europe has used some of the increase in productivity 
to increase leisure rather than income, while the U.S. has done the opposite.” 
Blanchard believes that Europeans simply have more taste for leisure than do 
Americans. (As a French economist working in the United States, he may have 
special insight into this phenomenon.) If Blanchard is right, this raises the even 
harder question of why tastes vary by geography.
Economists continue to debate the merits of these alternative hypotheses. 
In the end, there may be some truth to all of them.11
 7-6   Conclusion
Unemployment represents wasted resources. Unemployed workers have the 
potential to contribute to national income but are not doing so. Those searching 
for jobs to suit their skills are happy when the search is over, and those waiting 
for jobs in firms that pay above-equilibrium wages are happy when positions 
open up.
Unfortunately, neither frictional unemployment nor structural unemployment 
can be easily reduced. The government cannot make job search instantaneous, 
and it cannot easily bring wages closer to equilibrium levels. Zero unemploy­
ment is not a plausible goal for free-market economies.

Yet public policy is not powerless in the fight to reduce unemployment. 
Job-training programs, the unemployment-insurance system, the minimum wage, 
and the laws governing collective bargaining are often topics of political debate. 
The policies we choose are likely to have important effects on the economy’s 
natural rate of unemployment.
Summary
	1.	The natural rate of unemployment is the steady-state rate of unemployment. 
It depends on the rate of job separation and the rate of job finding.
	2.	Because it takes time for workers to search for the jobs that best suit their 
individual skills and tastes, some frictional unemployment is inevitable. 
Various government policies, such as unemployment insurance, alter the 
amount of frictional unemployment.
	3.	Structural unemployment results when the real wage remains above the level 
that equilibrates labor supply and labor demand. Minimum-wage legislation is 
one cause of wage rigidity. Unions and the threat of unionization are another. 
Finally, efficiency-wage theories suggest that, for various reasons, firms may 
find it profitable to keep wages high despite an excess supply of labor.
	4.	Whether we conclude that most unemployment is short-term or long-
term depends on how we look at the data. Most spells of unemployment 
are short. Yet most weeks of unemployment are attributable to the small 
number of long-term unemployed.
	5.	The unemployment rates among demographic groups differ substantially. 
In particular, the unemployment rates for younger workers are much 
higher than for older workers. This results from a difference in the rate of 
job separation rather than from a difference in the rate of job finding.
	6.	Individuals who have recently entered the labor force, including both 
new entrants and reentrants, make up about one-third of the unemployed. 
Transitions into and out of the labor force make unemployment statistics 
more difficult to interpret.
	7.	American and European labor markets exhibit some significant differences. 
In recent years, Europe has experienced significantly more unemployment 
than the United States. In addition, because of higher unemployment, 
shorter workweeks, more holidays, and earlier retirement, Europeans work 
fewer hours than Americans.

people who live in the dorm can be classified as

Among involved people, 10 percent experience

Among uninvolved people, 5 percent enter 
into a relationship every month. What is the 
steady-state fraction of residents who are 
uninvolved?

rate of unemployment is U/L 5 s/(s 1 f ). 
Suppose that the unemployment rate does 
not begin at this level. Show that unemploy­

it more difficult for firms to fire workers. 
(An example is a law requiring severance pay 
for fired workers.) If this legislation reduces 
the rate of job separation without affecting the 
rate of job finding, how would the natural rate 
of unemployment change? Do you think it is 
plausible that the legislation would not affect 
the rate of job finding? Why or why not?

and a labor force of 1,000 workers. Assuming 
that factor prices adjust to equilibrate

total output, and the total amount earned 
by workers.

the welfare of the working class, passes a law 
setting a minimum wage that is 10 percent 
above the equilibrium wage you derived 
in part (b). Assuming that Congress cannot 
dictate how many workers are hired at the

facturing, all workers who cannot get the highly 
paid union jobs move to the service sector. 
Calculate the wage and employment in services.
	e.	Now suppose that workers have a reservation 
wage of $15—that is, rather than taking a job 
at a wage below $15, they would rather wait 
for a $25 union job to open up. Calculate the 
wage and employment in each sector. What is 
the economy’s unemployment rate?
	8.	When workers’ wages rise, their decision about 
how much time to spend working is affected in 
two conflicting ways—as you may have learned 
in courses in microeconomics. The income effect 
is the impulse to work less, because greater 
incomes mean workers can afford to consume 
more leisure. The substitution effect is the impulse 
to work more, because the reward for working 
an additional hour has risen (equivalently, the 
opportunity cost of leisure has gone up). Apply 
these concepts to Blanchard’s hypothesis about 
American and European tastes for leisure. 
On which side of the Atlantic do income effects 
appear larger than substitution effects? On which 
side do the two effects approximately cancel? Do 
you think it is a reasonable hypothesis that tastes 
for leisure vary by geography? Why or why not?
	9.	In any city at any time, some of the stock of usable 
office space is vacant. This vacant office space 
is unemployed capital. How would you explain 
this phenomenon? In particular, which approach 
to explaining unemployed labor applies best to 
unemployed capital? Do you think unemployed 
capital is a social problem? Explain your answer.

f you have ever spoken with your grandparents about what their lives were 
like when they were young, most likely you learned an important lesson about 
economic growth: material standards of living have improved substantially over 
time for most families in most countries. This advance comes from rising incomes, 
which have allowed people to consume greater quantities of goods and services.
To measure economic growth, economists use data on gross domestic product, 
which measures the total income of everyone in a nation’s economy. The real GDP 
of the United States today is more than seven times its 1950 level, and real GDP per 
person is more than three times its 1950 level. In any given year, we also observe 
large differences in the standard of living among countries. Table 8-1 shows the 2012 
income per person in the world’s 14 most populous countries. The United States 
tops the list with an income of $51,749 per person. Ethiopia has an income per 
person of only $1,240—less than 3 percent of the figure for the United States.
Our goal in this part of the book is to understand what causes these differences 
in income over time and across countries. In Chapter 3 we identified the factors of 
production—capital and labor—and the production technology as the sources of the 
economy’s output and, thus, of its total income. Differences in income across time 
and across nations, then, must come from differences in capital, labor, and technology.
Our primary task in this chapter and the next is to develop a theory of eco­
nomic growth called the Solow growth model. Our analysis in Chapter 3 
enabled us to describe how the economy produces and uses its output at one 
point in time. The analysis was static—a snapshot of the economy. To explain 
why our national income grows, and why some economies grow faster than 
others, we must broaden our analysis so that it describes changes in the economy 
over time. By developing such a model, we make our analysis dynamic—more

TABLE  8-1
1The Solow growth model is named after economist Robert Solow and was developed in the 
1950s and 1960s. In 1987 Solow won the Nobel Prize in economics for his work on economic 
growth. The model was introduced in Robert M. Solow, “A Contribution to the Theory of 
Economic Growth,” Quarterly Journal of Economics (February 1956): 65–94.
like a movie than a photograph. The Solow growth model shows how saving, 
population growth, and technological progress affect the level of an economy’s 
output and its growth over time. In this chapter we analyze the roles of saving and 
population growth. In the next chapter we introduce technological progress.1
	
The Accumulation of Capital
The Solow growth model is designed to show how growth in the capital stock, 
growth in the labor force, and advances in technology interact in an economy 
as well as how they affect a nation’s total output of goods and services. We will 
build this model in a series of steps. Our first step is to examine how the supply 
and demand for goods determine the accumulation of capital. In this first step, 
we assume that the labor force and technology are fixed. We then relax these 
assumptions by introducing changes in the labor force later in this chapter and 
by introducing changes in technology in the next.
The Supply and Demand for Goods
The supply and demand for goods played a central role in our static model of 
the closed economy in Chapter 3. The same is true for the Solow model. By 
considering the supply and demand for goods, we can see what determines how 
much output is produced at any given time and how this output is allocated 
among alternative uses.
8-1

C H A P T E R  8   Economic Growth I: Capital Accumulation and Population Growth  | 213
The Supply of Goods and the Production Function The supply of 
goods in the Solow model is based on the production function, which states that 
output depends on the capital stock and the labor force:
Y 5 F (K, L).
The Solow growth model assumes that the production function has constant 
returns to scale. This assumption is often considered realistic, and, as we will see 
shortly, it helps simplify the analysis. Recall that a production function has con­
stant returns to scale if
zY 5 F  (zK, zL)
for any positive number z. That is, if both capital and labor are multiplied by z, 
the amount of output is also multiplied by z.
Production functions with constant returns to scale allow us to analyze all 
quantities in the economy relative to the size of the labor force. To see that this 
is true, set z 5 1/L in the preceding equation to obtain
Y/L 5 F (K/L, 1).
This equation shows that the amount of output per worker Y/L is a function 
of the amount of capital per worker K/L. (The number 1 is constant and thus 
can be ignored.) The assumption of constant returns to scale implies that the size 
of the economy—as measured by the number of workers—does not affect the 
relationship between output per worker and capital per worker.
Because the size of the economy does not matter, it will prove convenient to 
denote all quantities in per-worker terms. We designate quantities per worker 
with lowercase letters, so y 5 Y/L is output per worker, and k 5 K/L is capital 
per worker. We can then write the production function as
y 5 f (k),
where we define f (k) 5 F (k, 1). Figure 8-1 illustrates this production function.
The slope of this production function shows how much extra output a worker 
produces when given an extra unit of capital. This amount is the marginal prod­
uct of capital MPK. Mathematically, we write
MPK 5 f (k 1 1) 2 f (k).
Note that in Figure 8-1, as the amount of capital increases, the production func­
tion becomes flatter, indicating that the production function exhibits diminishing 
marginal product of capital. When k is low, the average worker has only a little 
capital to work with, so an extra unit of capital is very useful and produces a 
lot of additional output. When k is high, the average worker has a lot of capital 
already, so an extra unit increases production only slightly.
The Demand for Goods and the Consumption Function The demand 
for goods in the Solow model comes from consumption and investment. In other 
words, output per worker y is divided between consumption per worker c and 
investment per worker i:
y  c  i.

214 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
This equation is the per-worker version of the national income accounts identity 
for an economy. Notice that it omits government purchases (which for present pur­
poses we can ignore) and net exports (because we are assuming a closed economy).
The Solow model assumes that each year people save a fraction s of their 
income and consume a fraction (1 2 s). We can express this idea with the fol­
lowing consumption function:
c  (1 2 s)y,
where s, the saving rate, is a number between zero and one. Keep in mind that 
various government policies can potentially influence a nation’s saving rate, so 
one of our goals is to find what saving rate is desirable. For now, however, we just 
take the saving rate s as given.
To see what this consumption function implies for investment, substitute (1 2 s)y 
for c in the national income accounts identity:
y  (1  s)y  i.
Rearrange the terms to obtain
i  sy.
This equation shows that investment equals saving, as we first saw in Chapter 3. 
Thus, the rate of saving s is also the fraction of output devoted to investment.
We have now introduced the two main ingredients of the Solow model—
the production function and the consumption function—which describe the 
economy at any moment in time. For any given capital stock k, the production 
function y  f (k) determines how much output the economy produces, and the 
FIGURE  8-1
The Production Function  The 
production function shows how 
the amount of capital per work­
er k determines the amount of 
output per worker y 5 f (k). The 
slope of the production func­
tion is the marginal product of 
capital: if k increases by 1 unit, 
y increases by MPK units. The 
production function becomes 
flatter as k increases, indicating 
diminishing marginal product 
of capital.

saving rate s determines the allocation of that output between consumption and 
investment.
Growth in the Capital Stock and the Steady State
At any moment, the capital stock is a key determinant of the economy’s output, 
but the capital stock can change over time, and those changes can lead to economic 
growth. In particular, two forces influence the capital stock: investment and depre­
ciation. Investment is expenditure on new plant and equipment, and it causes the 
capital stock to rise. Depreciation is the wearing out of old capital due to aging and 
use, and it causes the capital stock to fall. Let’s consider each of these forces in turn.
As we have already noted, investment per worker i equals sy. By substituting 
the production function for y, we can express investment per worker as a func­
tion of the capital stock per worker:
i  sf(k).
This equation relates the existing stock of capital k to the accumulation of new 
capital i. Figure 8-2 shows this relationship. This figure illustrates how, for any 
value of k, the amount of output is determined by the production function f (k), 
and the allocation of that output between consumption and investment is deter­
mined by the saving rate s.
To incorporate depreciation into the model, we assume that a certain fraction d 
of the capital stock wears out each year. Here d (the lowercase Greek letter delta) 
is called the depreciation rate. For example, if capital lasts an average of 25 years, then 
the depreciation rate is 4 percent per year (d 5 0.04). The amount of capital that

depreciates each year is dk. Figure 8-3 shows how the amount of depreciation 
depends on the capital stock.
We can express the impact of investment and depreciation on the capital stock 
with this equation:
Change in Capital Stock  Investment  Depreciation
 
Dk	
	
i	
	
dk,
where Dk is the change in the capital stock between one year and the next. 
Because investment i equals sf (k), we can write this as
Dk  sf (k)  dk.
Figure 8-4 graphs the terms of this equation—investment and depreciation—for 
different levels of the capital stock k. The higher the capital stock, the greater the 
amounts of output and investment. Yet the higher the capital stock, the greater 
also the amount of depreciation.
As Figure 8-4 shows, there is a single capital stock k* at which the amount of 
investment equals the amount of depreciation. If the economy finds itself at this 
level of the capital stock, the capital stock will not change because the two forces 
acting on it—investment and depreciation—just balance. That is, at k*, Dk  0, 
so the capital stock k and output f (k) are steady over time (rather than growing 
or shrinking). We therefore call k* the steady-state level of capital.
The steady state is significant for two reasons. As we have just seen, an 
economy at the steady state will stay there. In addition, and just as important, an 
economy not at the steady state will go there. That is, regardless of the level of 
capital with which the economy begins, it ends up with the steady-state level of 
capital. In this sense, the steady state represents the long-run equilibrium of the economy.
To see why an economy always ends up at the steady state, suppose that the 
economy starts with less than the steady-state level of capital, such as level k1 in 
Figure 8-4. In this case, the level of investment exceeds the amount of depreciation. 
FIGURE  8-3

Over time, the capital stock will rise and will continue to rise—along with output 
f (k)—until it approaches the steady state k*.
Similarly, suppose that the economy starts with more than the steady-state 
level of capital, such as level k2. In this case, investment is less than deprecia­
tion: capital is wearing out faster than it is being replaced. The capital stock will 
fall, again approaching the steady-state level. Once the capital stock reaches the 
steady state, investment equals depreciation, and there is no pressure for the capi­
tal stock to either increase or decrease.
Approaching the Steady State: A Numerical Example
Let’s use a numerical example to see how the Solow model works and how 
the economy approaches the steady state. For this example, we assume that the 
production function is
Y 5 K1/2L1/2.
From Chapter 3, you will recognize this as the Cobb–Douglas production function 
with the capital-share parameter a equal to 1/2. To derive the per-worker produc­
tion function f (k), divide both sides of the production function by the labor force L:

Because y 5 Y/L and k 5 K/L, this equation becomes
y 5 k1/2,
which can also be written as
y 5 k.
This form of the production function states that output per worker equals the 
square root of the amount of capital per worker.
To complete the example, let’s assume that 30 percent of output is saved (s 5 0.3), 
that 10 percent of the capital stock depreciates every year (d 5 0.1), and that the 
economy starts off with 4 units of capital per worker (k 5 4). Given these numbers, 
we can now examine what happens to this economy over time.
We begin by looking at the production and allocation of output in the first year, 
when the economy has 4 units of capital per worker. Here are the steps we follow.
■	 According to the production function y 5 k, the 4 units of capital per 
worker (k) produce 2 units of output per worker (y).
■	 Because 30 percent of output is saved and invested and 70 percent is con­
sumed, i 5 0.6 and c 5 1.4.
■	 Because 10 percent of the capital stock depreciates, dk 5 0.4.
■	 With investment of 0.6 and depreciation of 0.4, the change in the capital 
stock is Dk 5 0.2.
Thus, the economy begins its second year with 4.2 units of capital per worker.
We can do the same calculations for each subsequent year. Table 8-2 shows how 
the economy progresses. Every year, because investment exceeds depreciation, new 
capital is added and output grows. Over many years, the economy approaches a steady 
state with 9 units of capital per worker. In this steady state, investment of 0.9 exactly 
offsets depreciation of 0.9, so the capital stock and output are no longer growing.
Following the progress of the economy for many years is one way to find the 
steady-state capital stock, but there is another way that requires fewer calcula­
tions. Recall that
Dk 5 sf (k) 2 dk.
This equation shows how k evolves over time. Because the steady state is (by 
definition) the value of k at which Dk 5 0, we know that
0 5 sf (k*) 2 dk*,
or, equivalently,
 k*
f (k*) 5

d.
This equation provides a way of finding the steady-state level of capital per worker k*.

Now square both sides of this equation to find

The steady-state capital stock is 9 units per worker. This result confirms the cal­
culation of the steady state in Table 8-2.

CASE STUDY
The Miracle of Japanese and German Growth
Japan and Germany are two success stories of economic growth. Although today 
they are economic superpowers, in 1946 the economies of both countries were in 
shambles. World War II had destroyed much of their capital stocks. In both nations, 
output per person in 1946 was about half of what it had been before the war. In 
the following decades, however, these two countries experienced some of the most 
rapid growth rates on record. Between 1946 and 1972, output per person grew at 
8.0 percent per year in Japan and 6.5 percent per year in Germany, compared to 
only 2.1 percent per year in the United States. Several other European economies 

220 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
damaged by the war also enjoyed rapid growth during this postwar period: for 
example, output per worker grew at 4.6 percent per year in France and 5.5 percent 
per year in Italy. But Japan and Germany are the two nations that experienced both 
the greatest devastation during the war and the most rapid growth after it.
Are these postwar experiences so surprising from the standpoint of the Solow 
growth model? Consider an economy in steady state. Now suppose that a war 
destroys some of the capital stock. (That is, suppose the capital stock drops from 
k* to k1 in Figure 8-4.) Not surprisingly, the level of output falls immediately. 
But if the saving rate—the fraction of output devoted to saving and investment—
is unchanged, the economy will then experience a period of high growth. Out­
put grows because, at the lower capital stock, more capital is added by investment 
than is removed by depreciation. This high growth continues until the economy 
approaches its former steady state. Hence, although destroying part of the capital 
stock immediately reduces output, it is followed by higher-than-normal growth. 
The “miracle” of rapid growth in Japan and Germany, as it is often described in 
the business press, is what the Solow model predicts for countries in which war 
has greatly reduced the capital stock.
Subsequent to their postwar growth miracles, both Japan and Germany settled 
down to moderate rates of growth, more similar to that of the United States. 
From 1972 to 2000, output per person grew at 2.4 percent per year in Japan and 
1.8 percent per year in Germany, compared to 2.1 percent per year in the United 
States. This phenomenon is also what the Solow model predicts. As an economy 
gets closer to its steady state, it no longer experiences the higher-than-normal 
growth that arises from the transition back to the steady state.
Lest one take the wrong lesson from this historical episode, note that wartime 
destruction should not be seen as desirable. The fast growth in Japan and Germany 
during the postwar period merely caught them up to where they otherwise 
would have been. Moreover, unlike Japan and Germany, many war-torn nations 
are left with a legacy of civil strife and political instability, which hamper their 
subsequent growth. n
How Saving Affects Growth
The explanation of Japanese and German growth after World War II is not quite 
as simple as suggested in the preceding Case Study. Another relevant fact is that 
both Japan and Germany save and invest a higher fraction of their output than 
does the United States. To understand more fully the international differences 
in economic performance, we must consider the effects of different saving rates.
Consider what happens to an economy when its saving rate increases. 
­Figure 8-5 shows such a change. The economy is assumed to begin in a steady 
state with saving rate s1 and capital stock k*
1. When the saving rate increases from 
s1 to s2, the sf (k) curve shifts upward. At the initial saving rate s1 and the initial 
capital stock k*
1, the amount of investment just offsets the amount of deprecia­
tion. Immediately after the saving rate rises, investment is higher, but the capital 
stock and depreciation are unchanged. Therefore, investment exceeds deprecia­
tion. The capital stock gradually rises until the economy reaches the new steady 

C H A P T E R  8   Economic Growth I: Capital Accumulation and Population Growth  | 221
state k*
2, which has a higher capital stock and a higher level of output than the 
old steady state.
The Solow model shows that the saving rate is a key determinant of the 
steady-state capital stock. If the saving rate is high, the economy will have a large capital 
stock and a high level of output in the steady state. If the saving rate is low, the economy 
will have a small capital stock and a low level of output in the steady state. This conclu­
sion sheds light on many discussions of fiscal policy. As we saw in Chapter 3, a 
government budget deficit can reduce national saving and crowd out investment. 
Now we can see that the long-run consequences of a reduced saving rate are a 
lower capital stock and lower national income. This is why many economists are 
critical of persistent budget deficits.
What does the Solow model say about the relationship between saving and 
economic growth? Higher saving leads to faster growth in the Solow model, but 
only temporarily. An increase in the rate of saving raises growth only until the 
economy reaches the new steady state. If the economy maintains a high saving 
rate, it will maintain a large capital stock and a high level of output, but it will not 
maintain a high rate of growth forever. Policies that alter the steady-state growth 
rate of income per person are said to have a growth effect; we will see examples of 
such policies in the next chapter. By contrast, a higher saving rate is said to have 
a level effect, because only the level of income per person—not its growth rate—is 
influenced by the saving rate in the steady state.
Now that we understand how saving and growth interact, we can more fully 
explain the impressive economic performance of Germany and Japan after World

An Increase in the Saving Rate  An increase in the saving rate s 
implies that the amount of investment for any given capital stock is 
higher. It therefore shifts the saving function upward. At the initial 
steady state k1*, investment now exceeds depreciation. The capital 
stock rises until the economy reaches a new steady state k2* with more 
capital and output.

War II. Not only were their initial capital stocks low because of the war, but their 
steady-state capital stocks were also high because of their high saving rates. Both 
of these facts help explain the rapid growth of these two countries in the 1950s 
and 1960s.
CASE STUDY
Saving and Investment Around the World
We started this chapter with an important question: Why are some countries so 
rich while others are mired in poverty? Our analysis has taken us a step closer to 
the answer. According to the Solow model, if a nation devotes a large fraction of 
its income to saving and investment, it will have a high steady-state capital stock 
and a high level of income. If a nation saves and invests only a small fraction of 
its income, its steady-state capital and income will be low.
Let’s now look at some data to see if this theoretical result in fact helps explain 
the large international variation in standards of living. Figure 8-6 is a scatter­
plot of data from about 100 countries. (The figure includes most of the world’s 
economies. It excludes major oil-producing countries and countries that were 
communist during much of this period, because their experiences are explained 
by their special circumstances.) The data show a positive relationship between 
the fraction of output devoted to investment and the level of income per person. 
That is, countries with high rates of investment, such as South Korea and Japan, 
usually have high incomes, whereas countries with low rates of investment, such 
as Nigeria and Burundi, have low incomes. Thus, the data are consistent with 
the Solow model’s prediction that the investment rate is a key determinant of 
whether a country is rich or poor.
The positive correlation shown in this figure is an important fact, but it raises 
as many questions as it resolves. One might naturally ask, why do rates of saving 
and investment vary so much from country to country? There are many poten­
tial answers, such as tax policy, retirement patterns, the development of financial 
markets, and cultural differences. In addition, political stability may play a role: 
not surprisingly, rates of saving and investment tend to be low in countries with 
frequent wars, revolutions, and coups. Saving and investment also tend to be low 
in countries with poor political institutions, as measured by estimates of official 
corruption. A final interpretation of the evidence in Figure 8-6 is reverse cau­
sation: perhaps high levels of income somehow foster high rates of saving and 
investment. Unfortunately, there is no consensus among economists about which 
of the many possible explanations is most important.
The association between investment rates and income per person is an 
important clue as to why some countries are rich and others poor, but it is 
not the whole story. The correlation between these two variables is far from 
perfect. There must be other determinants of living standards beyond saving 
and investment. Later in this chapter and in the next one, we return to the 
international differences in income per person to see what other variables 
enter the picture. n

The Golden Rule Level of Capital
So far, we have used the Solow model to examine how an economy’s rate of 
saving and investment determines its steady-state levels of capital and income. 
This analysis might lead you to think that higher saving is always a good thing 
because it always leads to greater income. Yet suppose a nation had a saving rate 
of 100 percent. That would lead to the largest possible capital stock and the larg­
est possible income. But if all of this income is saved and none is ever consumed, 
what good is it?
This section uses the Solow model to discuss the optimal amount of capital 
accumulation from the standpoint of economic well-being. In the next chapter, 
we discuss how government policies influence a nation’s saving rate. But first, in 
this section, we present the theory behind these policy decisions.

224 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
Comparing Steady States
To keep our analysis simple, let’s assume that a policymaker can set the economy’s 
saving rate at any level. By setting the saving rate, the policymaker determines 
the economy’s steady state. What steady state should the policymaker choose?
The policymaker’s goal is to maximize the well-being of the individuals 
who make up the society. Individuals themselves do not care about the amount 
of capital in the economy or even the amount of output. They care about the 
amount of goods and services they can consume. Thus, a benevolent policymaker 
would want to choose the steady state with the highest level of consumption. 
The steady-state value of k that maximizes consumption is called the Golden 
Rule level of capital and is denoted k*
gold.2
How can we tell whether an economy is at the Golden Rule level? To answer 
this question, we must first determine steady-state consumption per worker. 
Then we can see which steady state provides the most consumption.
To find steady-state consumption per worker, we begin with the national 
income accounts identity
y 5 c 1 i
and rearrange it as
c 5 y 2 i.
Consumption is output minus investment. Because we want to find steady-
state consumption, we substitute steady-state values for output and investment. 
Steady-state output per worker is f (k*), where k* is the steady-state capital stock 
per worker. Furthermore, because the capital stock is not changing in the steady 
state, investment equals depreciation dk*. Substituting f (k*) for y and dk* for i, 
we can write steady-state consumption per worker as
c* 5 f (k*) 2 dk*.
According to this equation, steady-state consumption is what’s left of steady-state 
output after paying for steady-state depreciation. This equation shows that an 
increase in steady-state capital has two opposing effects on steady-state consump­
tion. On the one hand, more capital means more output. On the other hand, 
more capital also means that more output must be used to replace capital that is 
wearing out.
Figure 8-7 graphs steady-state output and steady-state depreciation as a 
function of the steady-state capital stock. Steady-state consumption is the gap 
between output and depreciation. This figure shows that there is one level of the 
capital stock—the Golden Rule level k*
gold—that maximizes consumption.
When comparing steady states, we must keep in mind that higher levels of cap­
ital affect both output and depreciation. If the capital stock is below the Golden 
Rule level, an increase in the capital stock raises output more than depreciation, 
2Edmund Phelps, “The Golden Rule of Accumulation: A Fable for Growthmen,” American 
­Economic Review 51 (September 1961): 638–643.

C H A P T E R  8   Economic Growth I: Capital Accumulation and Population Growth  | 225
so consumption rises. In this case, the production function is steeper than the dk* 
line, so the gap between these two curves—which equals consumption—grows as 
k* rises. By contrast, if the capital stock is above the Golden Rule level, an increase 
in the capital stock reduces consumption, because the increase in output is smaller 
than the increase in depreciation. In this case, the production function is flatter 
than the dk* line, so the gap between the curves—consumption—shrinks as k* 
rises. At the Golden Rule level of capital, the production function and the dk* 
line have the same slope, and consumption is at its greatest level.
We can now derive a simple condition that characterizes the Golden Rule 
level of capital. Recall that the slope of the production function is the marginal 
product of capital MPK. The slope of the dk* line is d. Because these two slopes 
are equal at k*
gold, the Golden Rule is described by the equation
MPK 5 d.
At the Golden Rule level of capital, the marginal product of capital equals the 
depreciation rate.
To make the point somewhat differently, suppose that the economy starts 
at some steady-state capital stock k* and that the policymaker is considering 
increasing the capital stock to k* 1 1. The amount of extra output from this 
increase in capital would be f (k* 1 1) 2 f (k*), the marginal product of capital 
MPK. The amount of extra depreciation from having 1 more unit of capital 
is the depreciation rate d. Thus, the net effect of this extra unit of capital on 
consumption is MPK 2 d. If MPK 2 d . 0, then increases in capital increase

Consumption  The econ­

In the steady state, invest­

Therefore, steady-state con­
sumption is the ­difference 
between output ƒ(k*) and 
depreciation dk*. Steady-
state consumption is maxi­
mized at the Golden Rule 
steady state. The Golden Rule 
capital stock is denoted k*

and the Golden Rule level of 
consumption is denoted c* 
gold.

consumption, so k* must be below the Golden Rule level. If MPK 2 d , 0, 
then increases in capital decrease consumption, so k* must be above the Golden 
Rule level. Therefore, the following condition describes the Golden Rule:
MPK 2 d 5 0.
At the Golden Rule level of capital, the marginal product of capital net of 
depreciation (MPK 2 d) equals zero. As we will see, a policymaker can use this 
condition to find the Golden Rule capital stock for an economy.3
Keep in mind that the economy does not automatically gravitate toward the 
Golden Rule steady state. If we want any particular steady-state capital stock, such 
as the Golden Rule, we need a particular saving rate to support it. Figure 8-8 
shows the steady state if the saving rate is set to produce the Golden Rule level of 
capital. If the saving rate is higher than the one used in this figure, the steady-state 
capital stock will be too high. If the saving rate is lower, the steady-state capital 
stock will be too low. In either case, steady-state consumption will be lower than 
it is at the Golden Rule steady state.
3Mathematical note: Another way to derive the condition for the Golden Rule uses a bit of calculus. 
Recall that c* 5 f(k*) 2 dk*. To find the k* that maximizes c*, differentiate to find dc*/dk* 5 
f(k*) 2 d and set this derivative equal to zero. Noting that f(k*) is the marginal product of capital, 
we obtain the Golden Rule condition in the text.

The Saving Rate and the Golden Rule  There is only 
one saving rate that produces the Golden Rule level of 
capital k*gold. Any change in the saving rate would shift 
the sƒ(k) curve and would move the economy to a steady 
state with a lower level of consumption.

Finding the Golden Rule Steady State:
A Numerical Example
Consider the decision of a policymaker choosing a steady state in the following 
economy. The production function is the same as in our earlier example:
y 5 k.
Output per worker is the square root of capital per worker. Depreciation d is 
again 10 percent of capital. This time, the policymaker chooses the saving rate s 
and thus the economy’s steady state.
To see the outcomes available to the policymaker, recall that the following 
equation holds in the steady state:
​   k* 
_ 
f(k*) ​ 5 ​ s _ 
 ​
In this economy, this equation becomes
  k*
k* 5 s
0.1 .
Squaring both sides of this equation yields a solution for the steady-state capital 
stock. We find
k* 5 100s2.
Using this result, we can compute the steady-state capital stock for any saving rate.
Table 8-3 presents calculations showing the steady states that result from 
various saving rates in this economy. We see that higher saving leads to a higher 
capital stock, which in turn leads to higher output and higher depreciation. 
Steady-state consumption, the difference between output and depreciation, first 
rises with higher saving rates and then declines. Consumption is highest when 
the saving rate is 0.5. Hence, a saving rate of 0.5 produces the Golden Rule 
steady state.
Recall that another way to identify the Golden Rule steady state is to find 
the capital stock at which the net marginal product of capital (MPK 2 d) equals 
zero. For this production function, the marginal product is4
MPK 5 
1
2k* .
Using this formula, the last two columns of Table 8-3 present the values of MPK 
and MPK 2 d in the different steady states. Note that the net marginal product 
of capital is exactly zero when the saving rate is at its Golden Rule value of 0.5. 
Because of diminishing marginal product, the net marginal product of capital is 
greater than zero whenever the economy saves less than this amount, and it is 
less than zero whenever the economy saves more.
4Mathematical note: To derive this formula, note that the marginal product of capital is the derivative 
of the production function with respect to k.

228 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
This numerical example confirms that the two ways of finding the Golden Rule 
steady state—looking at steady-state consumption or looking at the marginal product 
of capital—give the same answer. If we want to know whether an actual economy 
is currently at, above, or below its Golden Rule capital stock, the second method is 
usually more convenient, because it is relatively straightforward to estimate the mar­
ginal product of capital. By contrast, evaluating an economy with the first method 
requires estimates of steady-state consumption at many different saving rates; such 
information is harder to obtain. Thus, when we apply this kind of analysis to the U.S. 
economy in the next chapter, we will evaluate U.S. saving by examining the marginal 
product of capital. Before engaging in that policy analysis, however, we need to pro­
ceed further in our development and understanding of the Solow model.
The Transition to the Golden Rule Steady State
Let’s now make our policymaker’s problem more realistic. So far, we have been 
assuming that the policymaker can simply choose the economy’s steady state 
and jump there immediately. In this case, the policymaker would choose the 
steady state with the highest consumption—the Golden Rule steady state. But 
now suppose that the economy has reached a steady state other than the Golden 
Rule. What happens to consumption, investment, and capital when the economy 
makes the transition between steady states? Might the impact of the transition 
deter the policymaker from trying to achieve the Golden Rule?
We must consider two cases: the economy might begin with more capital than 
in the Golden Rule steady state, or with less. It turns out that the two cases offer 
very different problems for policymakers. (As we will see in the next chapter, the 
second case—too little capital—describes most actual economies, including that 
of the United States.)

Starting With Too Much Capital We first consider the case in which the 
economy begins at a steady state with more capital than it would have in the 
Golden Rule steady state. In this case, the policymaker should pursue policies 
aimed at reducing the rate of saving in order to reduce the capital stock. Suppose 
that these policies succeed and that at some point—call it time t0—the saving 
rate falls to the level that will eventually lead to the Golden Rule steady state.
Figure 8-9 shows what happens to output, consumption, and investment 
when the saving rate falls. The reduction in the saving rate causes an immedi­
ate increase in consumption and a decrease in investment. Because investment 
and depreciation were equal in the initial steady state, investment will now be 
less than depreciation, which means the economy is no longer in a steady state. 
Gradually, the capital stock falls, leading to reductions in output, consumption, 
and investment. These variables continue to fall until the economy reaches the 
new steady state. Because we are assuming that the new steady state is the Golden 
Rule steady state, consumption must be higher than it was before the change in 
the saving rate, even though output and investment are lower.
Note that, compared to consumption in the old steady state, consumption is 
higher not only in the new steady state but also along the entire path to it. When 
the capital stock exceeds the Golden Rule level, reducing saving is clearly a good 
policy, for it increases consumption at every point in time.
Starting With Too Little Capital When the economy begins with less capi­
tal than in the Golden Rule steady state, the policymaker must raise the saving 
rate to reach the Golden Rule. Figure 8-10 shows what happens. The increase 
in the saving rate at time t0 causes an immediate fall in consumption and a rise 
in investment. Over time, higher investment causes the capital stock to rise.

Reducing Saving When Starting With 
More Capital Than in the Golden Rule 
Steady State  This figure shows what hap­
pens over time to output, consumption, 
and investment when the economy begins 
with more capital than the Golden Rule level 
and the saving rate is reduced. The reduc­
tion in the saving rate (at time t0) causes an 
immediate increase in consumption and an 
equal decrease in investment. Over time, as 
the capital stock falls, output, consumption, 
and investment fall together. Because the 
economy began with too much capital, the 
new steady state has a higher level of con­
sumption than the initial steady state.

230 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
As capital accumulates, output, consumption, and investment gradually increase, 
eventually approaching the new steady-state levels. Because the initial steady state 
was below the Golden Rule, the increase in saving eventually leads to a higher 
level of consumption than that which prevailed initially.
Does the increase in saving that leads to the Golden Rule steady state raise 
economic welfare? Eventually it does, because the new steady-state level of 
consumption is higher than the initial level. But achieving that new steady 
state requires an initial period of reduced consumption. Note the contrast 
to the case in which the economy begins above the Golden Rule. When the 
economy begins above the Golden Rule, reaching the Golden Rule produces higher 
consumption at all points in time. When the economy begins below the Golden Rule, 
reaching the Golden Rule requires initially reducing consumption to increase consump­
tion in the future.
When deciding whether to try to reach the Golden Rule steady state, policy­
makers have to take into account that current consumers and future consumers 
are not always the same people. Reaching the Golden Rule achieves the high­
est steady-state level of consumption and thus benefits future generations. But 
when the economy is initially below the Golden Rule, reaching the Golden 
Rule requires raising investment and thus lowering the consumption of current 
generations. Thus, when choosing whether to increase capital accumulation, 
the policymaker faces a tradeoff among the welfare of different generations. 
A policymaker who cares more about current generations than about future ones 
may decide not to pursue policies to reach the Golden Rule steady state. By con­
trast, a policymaker who cares about all generations equally will choose to reach 
the Golden Rule. Even though current generations will consume less, an infinite 
number of future generations will benefit by moving to the Golden Rule.
Increasing Saving When Starting With 
Less Capital Than in the Golden Rule 
Steady State  This figure shows what hap­
pens over time to output, consumption, and 
investment when the economy begins with 
less capital than the Golden Rule level and 
the saving rate is increased. The increase 
in the saving rate (at time t0) causes an 
immediate drop in consumption and an 
equal jump in investment. Over time, as the 
capital stock grows, output, consumption, 
and investment increase together. Because 
the economy began with less capital than 
the Golden Rule level, the new steady state 
has a higher level of consumption than the 
initial steady state.

Thus, optimal capital accumulation depends crucially on how we weigh the 
interests of current and future generations. The biblical Golden Rule tells us, 
“Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” If we heed this advice, 
we give all generations equal weight. In this case, it is optimal to reach the 
Golden Rule level of capital—which is why it is called the “Golden Rule.”
	
Population Growth
The basic Solow model shows that capital accumulation, by itself, cannot explain 
sustained economic growth: high rates of saving lead to high growth temporar­
ily, but the economy eventually approaches a steady state in which capital and 
output are constant. To explain the sustained economic growth that we observe 
in most parts of the world, we must expand the Solow model to incorporate the 
other two sources of economic growth—population growth and technological 
progress. In this section we add population growth to the model.
Instead of assuming that the population is fixed, as we did in Sections 8-1 
and 8-2, we now suppose that the population and the labor force grow at 
a constant rate n. For example, the U.S. population grows about 1 percent 
per year, so n 5 0.01. This means that if 150 million people are working 
one year, then 151.5 million (1.01 3 150) are working the next year, and 
153.015 ­million (1.01 3 151.5) the year after that, and so on.
The Steady State With Population Growth
How does population growth affect the steady state? To answer this question, we 
must discuss how population growth, along with investment and depreciation, 
influences the accumulation of capital per worker. As we noted before, invest­
ment raises the capital stock, and depreciation reduces it. But now there is a 
third force acting to change the amount of capital per worker: the growth in the 
number of workers causes capital per worker to fall.
We continue to let lowercase letters stand for quantities per worker. Thus, 
k 5 K/L is capital per worker, and y 5 Y/L is output per worker. Keep in 
mind, however, that the number of workers is growing over time.
The change in the capital stock per worker is
Dk 5 i 2 (d 1 n)k.
This equation shows how investment, depreciation, and population growth influ­
ence the per-worker capital stock. Investment increases k, whereas depreciation 
and population growth decrease k. We saw this equation earlier in this chapter 
for the special case of a constant population (n 5 0).
We can think of the term (d 1 n)k as defining break-even investment—the 
amount of investment necessary to keep the capital stock per worker constant. 
Break-even investment includes the depreciation of existing capital, which equals 
dk. It also includes the amount of investment necessary to provide new workers 
8-3

232 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
with capital. The amount of investment necessary for this purpose is nk, because 
there are n new workers for each existing worker and because k is the amount of 
capital for each worker. The equation shows that population growth reduces the 
accumulation of capital per worker much the way depreciation does. Depreciation 
reduces k by wearing out the capital stock, whereas population growth reduces k 
by spreading the capital stock more thinly among a larger population of workers.5
Our analysis with population growth now proceeds much as it did previously. 
First, we substitute sf (k) for i. The equation can then be written as
Dk 5 sf (k) 2 (d 1 n)k.
To see what determines the steady-state level of capital per worker, we use 
Figure 8-11, which extends the analysis of Figure 8-4 to include the effects of 
population growth. An economy is in a steady state if capital per worker k is 
unchanging. As before, we designate the steady-state value of k as k*. If k is less 
than k*, investment is greater than break-even investment, so k rises. If k is greater 
than k*, investment is less than break-even investment, so k falls.
In the steady state, the positive effect of investment on the capital stock per 
worker exactly balances the negative effects of depreciation and population growth. 
That is, at k*, Dk 5 0 and i* 5 dk* 1 nk*. Once the economy is in the steady 
state, investment has two purposes. Some of it (dk*) replaces the depreciated capital, 
and the rest (nk*) provides the new workers with the steady-state amount of capital.
5Mathematical note: Formally deriving the equation for the change in k requires a bit of calculus. 
Note that the change in k per unit of time is dk/dt 5 d(K/L)/dt. After applying the standard rules 
of calculus, we can write this as dk/dt 5 (1/L)(dK/dt) 2 (K/L2)(dL/dt). Now use the following 
facts to substitute in this equation: dK/dt 5 I 2 dK and (dL/dt)/L 5 n. After a bit of manipulation, 
this produces the equation in the text.

The Effects of Population Growth
Population growth alters the basic Solow model in three ways. First, it brings us 
closer to explaining sustained economic growth. In the steady state with popu­
lation growth, capital per worker and output per worker are constant. Because 
the number of workers is growing at rate n, however, total capital and total out­
put must also be growing at rate n. Hence, although population growth cannot 
explain sustained growth in the standard of living (because output per worker is 
constant in the steady state), it can help explain sustained growth in total output.
Second, population growth gives us another explanation for why some coun­
tries are rich and others are poor. Consider the effects of an increase in popula­
tion growth. Figure 8-12 shows that an increase in the rate of population growth 
from n1 to n2 reduces the steady-state level of capital per worker from k*
1 to k*
2. 
Because k* is lower and because y* 5 f (k*), the level of output per worker y* 
is also lower. Thus, the Solow model predicts that countries with higher popula­
tion growth will have lower levels of GDP per person. Notice that a change in 
the population growth rate, like a change in the saving rate, has a level effect on 
income per person but does not affect the steady-state growth rate of income 
per person.
Finally, population growth affects our criterion for determining the Golden 
Rule (consumption-maximizing) level of capital. To see how this criterion 
changes, note that consumption per worker is

Because steady-state output is f(k*) and steady-state investment is (d 1 n)k*, we 
can express steady-state consumption as
c* 5 f(k*) 2 (d 1 n)k*.
Using an argument largely the same as before, we conclude that the level of k* 
that maximizes consumption is the one at which

or equivalently,
MPK 2 d 5 n.
In the Golden Rule steady state, the marginal product of capital net of deprecia­
tion equals the rate of population growth.
CASE STUDY
Population Growth Around the World
Let’s return now to the question of why standards of living vary so much around 
the world. The analysis we have just completed suggests that population growth 
may be one of the answers. According to the Solow model, a nation with a high 
rate of population growth will have a low steady-state capital stock per worker 
and thus also a low level of income per worker. In other words, high popula­
tion growth tends to impoverish a country because it is hard to maintain a high 
level of capital per worker when the number of workers is growing quickly. 
To see whether the evidence supports this conclusion, we again look at cross-
country data.
Figure 8-13 is a scatterplot of data for the same countries examined in 
the previous Case Study (and in Figure 8-6). The figure shows that countries 
with high rates of population growth tend to have low levels of income per 
person. The international evidence is consistent with our model’s prediction 
that the rate of population growth is one determinant of a country’s standard 
of living.
This conclusion is not lost on policymakers. Those trying to pull the world’s 
poorest nations out of poverty, such as the advisers sent to developing nations by 
the World Bank, often advocate reducing fertility by increasing education about 
birth-control methods and expanding women’s job opportunities. Toward the 
same end, China has followed the totalitarian policy of allowing only one child 
for most urban couples (though in 2013 China started to relax the rule). These 
policies to reduce population growth should, if the Solow model is right, raise 
income per person in the long run.
In interpreting the cross-country data, however, it is important to keep in mind 
that correlation does not imply causation. The data show that low population 
growth is typically associated with high levels of income per person, and the Solow 
model offers one possible explanation for this fact, but other explanations are also 
possible. It is conceivable that high income encourages low population growth,

perhaps because birth-control techniques are more readily available in richer 
countries. The international data can help us evaluate a theory of growth, such as 
the Solow model, because they show us whether the theory’s predictions are borne 
out in the world. But often more than one theory can explain the same facts. n
Alternative Perspectives on Population Growth
The Solow growth model highlights the interaction between population growth 
and capital accumulation. In this model, high population growth reduces output 
per worker because rapid growth in the number of workers forces the capital stock 
to be spread more thinly, so in the steady state, each worker is equipped with less 
capital. The model omits some other potential effects of population growth. Here 
we consider two—one emphasizing the interaction of population with natural 
resources, the other emphasizing the interaction of population with technology.

236 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
The Malthusian Model  In his book An Essay on the Principle of Population as 
It Affects the Future Improvement of Society, the early economist Thomas Robert 
Malthus (1766–1834) offered what may be history’s most chilling forecast. Malthus 
argued that an ever-increasing population would continually strain society’s ability 
to provide for itself. Mankind, he predicted, would forever live in poverty.
Malthus began by noting that “food is necessary to the existence of man” and 
that “the passion between the sexes is necessary and will remain nearly in its 
present state.” He concluded that “the power of population is infinitely greater 
than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man.” According to 
Malthus, the only check on population growth was “misery and vice.” Attempts 
by charities or governments to alleviate poverty were counterproductive, he 
argued, because they merely allowed the poor to have more children, placing 
even greater strains on society’s productive capabilities.
The Malthusian model may have described the world when Malthus lived, 
but its prediction that mankind would remain in poverty forever has proven very 
wrong. The world population has increased about sevenfold over the past two 
centuries, but average living standards are much higher. Because of economic 
growth, chronic hunger and malnutrition are less common now than they were 
in Malthus’s day. Famines occur from time to time, but they are more often the 
result of unequal income distribution or political instability than the inadequate 
production of food.
Malthus failed to foresee that growth in mankind’s ingenuity would more than 
offset the effects of a larger population. Pesticides, fertilizers, mechanized farm 
equipment, new crop varieties, and other technological advances that Malthus 
never imagined have allowed each farmer to feed ever-greater numbers of people. 
Even with more mouths to feed, fewer farmers are necessary because each farmer 
is so productive. Today, only about 1 percent of Americans work on farms, produc­
ing enough food to feed the nation and some excess to export as well.
In addition, although the “passion between the sexes” is just as strong now 
as it was in Malthus’s day, the link between passion and population growth that 
Malthus assumed has been broken by modern birth control. Many advanced 
nations, such as those in western Europe, are now experiencing fertility below 
replacement rates. Over the next century, shrinking populations may be more 
likely than rapidly expanding ones. There is now little reason to think that an 
ever-expanding population will overwhelm food production and doom mankind 
to poverty.6
The Kremerian Model While Malthus saw population growth as a threat 
to rising living standards, economist Michael Kremer has suggested that world 
population growth is a key driver of advancing economic prosperity. If there are 
more people, Kremer argues, then there are more scientists, inventors, and engi­
neers to contribute to innovation and technological progress.
6For modern analyses of the Malthusian model, see Oded Galor and David N. Weil, “Population, 
Technology, and Growth: From Malthusian Stagnation to the Demographic Transition and Beyond,” 
American Economic Review 90 (September 2000): 806–828; and Gary D. Hansen and Edward C. 
Prescott, “Malthus to Solow,” American Economic Review 92 (September 2002): 1205–1217.

C H A P T E R  8   Economic Growth I: Capital Accumulation and Population Growth  | 237
As evidence for this hypothesis, Kremer begins by noting that over the broad 
span of human history, world growth rates have increased together with world 
population. For example, world growth was more rapid when the world popula­
tion was 1 billion (which occurred around the year 1800) than it was when the 
population was only 100 million (around 500 b.c.). This fact is consistent with 
the hypothesis that having more people induces more technological progress.
Kremer’s second, more compelling piece of evidence comes from comparing 
regions of the world. The melting of the polar ice caps at the end of the ice age 
around 10,000 b.c. flooded the land bridges and separated the world into several 
distinct regions that could not communicate with one another for thousands of 
years. If technological progress is more rapid when there are more people to discover 
things, then the more populous regions should have experienced more rapid growth.
And, indeed, they did. The most successful region of the world in 1500 
(when Columbus reestablished technological contact) included the “Old World” 
­civilizations of the large Eurasia–Africa region. Next in technological develop­
ment were the Aztec and Mayan civilizations in the Americas, followed by the 
hunter-gatherers of Australia, and then the primitive people of Tasmania, who 
lacked even fire-making and most stone and bone tools. The least populous 
isolated region was Flinders Island, a tiny island between Tasmania and Australia. 
With few people to contribute new innovations, Flinders Island had the least 
technological advance and, in fact, seemed to regress. Around 3000 b.c., human 
society on Flinders Island died out completely.
Kremer concludes from this evidence that a large population is a prerequisite 
for technological advance.7
 8-4	 Conclusion
This chapter has started the process of building the Solow growth model. The 
model as developed so far shows how saving and population growth determine the 
economy’s steady-state capital stock and its steady-state level of income per person. 
As we have seen, it sheds light on many features of actual growth experiences—why 
Germany and Japan grew so rapidly after being devastated by World War II, why 
countries that save and invest a high fraction of their output are richer than coun­
tries that save and invest a smaller fraction, and why countries with high rates of 
population growth are poorer than countries with low rates of population growth.
What the model cannot do, however, is explain the persistent growth in ­living 
standards we observe in most countries. In the model we have developed so far, 
output per worker stops growing when the economy reaches its steady state. 
To explain persistent growth, we need to introduce technological progress into 
the model. That is our first job in the next chapter.

238 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
Summary
	1.	The Solow growth model shows that in the long run, an economy’s rate of 
saving determines the size of its capital stock and thus its level of produc­
tion. The higher the rate of saving, the higher the stock of capital and the 
higher the level of output.
	2.	In the Solow model, an increase in the rate of saving has a level effect on 
income per person: it causes a period of rapid growth, but eventually that 
growth slows as the new steady state is reached. Thus, although a high sav­
ing rate yields a high steady-state level of output, saving by itself cannot 
generate persistent economic growth.
	3.	The level of capital that maximizes steady-state consumption is called the 
Golden Rule level. If an economy has more capital than in the Golden 
Rule steady state, then reducing saving will increase consumption at all 
points in time. By contrast, if the economy has less capital than in the 
Golden Rule steady state, then reaching the Golden Rule requires increased 
investment and thus lower consumption for current generations.
	4.	The Solow model shows that an economy’s rate of population growth is 
another long-run determinant of the standard of living. According to the 
Solow model, the higher the rate of population growth, the lower the 
steady-state levels of capital per worker and output per worker. Other theo­
ries highlight other effects of population growth. Malthus suggested that 
population growth will strain the natural resources necessary to produce 
food; Kremer suggested that a large population may promote technological 
progress.

your answer from part (b) and the steady-state 
condition that investment equals depreciation, 
find the steady-state level of capital per work­

	d.	Suppose that both countries start off with a 
capital stock per worker of 1. What are the 
levels of income per worker and consumption 
per worker?
	e.	Remembering that the change in the capital 
stock is investment less depreciation, use a

	2.	In the discussion of German and Japanese post­

war. By contrast, suppose that a war does not 
directly affect the capital stock, but that casualties 
reduce the labor force. Assume the economy was 
in a steady state before the war, the saving rate 
is unchanged, and the rate of population growth 
after the war is the same as it was before.
	a.	What is the immediate impact of the war on 
total output and on output per person?

	c.	Assume that the depreciation rate is 15 per­
cent per year. Make a table showing steady-
state capital per worker, output per worker, 
and consumption per worker for saving rates 
of 0 percent, 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 per­
cent, and so on. (You might find it easiest to 
use a computer spreadsheet.) What saving rate 
maximizes output per worker? What saving 
rate maximizes consumption per worker?
	d.	Use information from Chapter 3 to find the 
marginal product of capital. Add to your table 
from part (c) the marginal product of capital 
net of depreciation for each of the saving

	5.	Draw a well-labeled graph that illustrates the 
steady state of the Solow model with population 
growth. Use the graph to find what happens 
to steady-state capital per worker and income 
per worker in response to each of the following 
exogenous changes.
	a.	A change in consumer preferences increases 
the saving rate.
	b.	A change in weather patterns increases the 
depreciation rate.
	c.	Better birth-control methods reduce the rate 
of population growth.

	d.	A one-time, permanent improvement in tech­
nology increases the amount of output that 
can be produced from any given amount of 
capital and labor.
	6.	Many demographers predict that the United 
States will have zero population growth in the 
coming decades, in contrast to the historical 
average population growth of about 1 percent 
per year. Use the Solow model to forecast the 
effect of this slowdown in population growth 
on the growth of total output and the growth 
of output per person. Consider the effects both 
in the steady state and in the transition between 
steady states.
	7.	In the Solow model, population growth leads 
to steady-state growth in total output, but 
not in output per worker. Do you think this 
would still be true if the production function 
exhibited increasing or decreasing returns to 
scale? Explain. (For the definitions of increasing 
and decreasing returns to scale, see Chapter 3,

Economic Growth II: Technology, 
Empirics, and Policy
Is there some action a government of India could take that would lead the 
Indian economy to grow like Indonesia’s or Egypt’s? If so, what, exactly? If 
not, what is it about the “nature of India” that makes it so? The consequences 
for human welfare involved in questions like these are simply staggering: Once 
one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about anything else.

he quotation that opens this chapter was written in 1988. Since then, 
India has grown rapidly, a phenomenon that has pulled millions of 
people out of extreme poverty. At the same time, some other poor 
nations, including many in sub-Saharan Africa, have experienced little growth, 
and their citizens continue to live meager existences. It is the job of growth 
theory to explain such disparate outcomes. The reasons that some nations 
succeed while others fail at promoting long-run economic growth are not easily 
apparent, but as Robert Lucas suggests, the consequences for human welfare are 
indeed staggering.
This chapter continues our analysis of the forces governing long-run growth. 
With the basic version of the Solow model as our starting point, we take on four 
new tasks.
Our first task is to make the Solow model more general and realistic. 
In ­Chapter 3 we saw that capital, labor, and technology are the key determinants 
of a nation’s production of goods and services. In Chapter 8 we developed the 
Solow model to show how changes in capital (through saving and investment) 
and changes in the labor force (through population growth) affect the econo­
my’s output. We are now ready to add the third source of growth—changes in 
technology—to the mix. The Solow model does not explain technological prog­
ress but, instead, takes it as exogenously given and shows how it interacts with 
other variables in the process of economic growth.
Our second task is to move from theory to empirics. That is, we consider how 
well the Solow model fits the facts. Over the past few decades, a large literature 
has examined the predictions of the Solow model and other models of economic 

242 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
growth. It turns out that the glass is both half full and half empty. The Solow 
model can shed much light on international growth experiences, but it is far 
from the last word on the subject.
Our third task is to examine how a nation’s public policies can influence the level 
and growth of its citizens’ standard of living. In particular, we address five questions: 
Should our society save more or less? How can policy influence the rate of saving? 
Are there some types of investment that policy should especially encourage? What 
institutions ensure that the economy’s resources are put to their best use? How 
can policy increase the rate of technological progress? The Solow growth model 
provides the theoretical framework within which we consider these policy issues.
Our fourth and final task is to consider what the Solow model leaves out. 
As we have discussed previously, models help us understand the world by sim­
plifying it. After completing an analysis of a model, therefore, it is important to 
consider whether we have oversimplified matters. In the last section, we examine 
a new set of theories, called endogenous growth theories, which help to explain the 
technological progress that the Solow model takes as exogenous.
9-1 	 Technological Progress in the 
Solow Model
So far, our presentation of the Solow model has assumed an unchanging relation­
ship between the inputs of capital and labor and the output of goods and services. 
Yet the model can be modified to include exogenous technological progress, 
which over time expands society’s production capabilities.
The Efficiency of Labor
To incorporate technological progress, we must return to the production func­
tion that relates total capital K and total labor L to total output Y. Thus far, the 
production function has been
Y  F(K, L).
We now write the production function as
Y  F(K, L  E),
where E is a new (and somewhat abstract) variable called the efficiency of labor. 
The efficiency of labor is meant to reflect society’s knowledge about production 
methods: as the available technology improves, the efficiency of labor rises, and 
each hour of work contributes more to the production of goods and services. For 
instance, the efficiency of labor rose when assembly-line production transformed 
manufacturing in the early twentieth century, and it rose again when computeriza­
tion was introduced in the late twentieth century. The efficiency of labor also rises 
when there are improvements in the health, education, or skills of the labor force.

C H A P T E R  9   Economic Growth II: Technology, Empirics, and Policy  | 243
The term L  E can be interpreted as measuring the effective number of workers. 
It takes into account the number of actual workers L and the efficiency of each 
worker E. In other words, L measures the number of workers in the labor force, 
whereas L  E measures both the workers and the technology with which the 
typical worker comes equipped. This new production function states that total 
output Y depends on the inputs of capital K and effective workers L  E.
The essence of this approach to modeling technological progress is that 
increases in the efficiency of labor E are analogous to increases in the labor 
force L. Suppose, for example, that an advance in production methods makes the 
efficiency of labor E double between 1980 and 2015. This means that a single 
worker in 2015 is, in effect, as productive as two workers were in 1980. That is, 
even if the actual number of workers (L) stays the same from 1980 to 2015, the 
effective number of workers (L  E) doubles, and the economy benefits from 
the increased production of goods and services.
The simplest assumption about technological progress is that it causes the 
efficiency of labor E to grow at some constant rate g. For example, if g  0.02, 
then each unit of labor becomes 2 percent more efficient each year: output 
increases as if the labor force had increased by 2 percent more than it really did. 
This form of technological progress is called labor augmenting, and g is called the 
rate of labor-augmenting technological progress. Because the labor force L 
is growing at rate n, and the efficiency of each unit of labor E is growing at rate g, 
the effective number of workers L  E is growing at rate n  g.
The Steady State With Technological Progress
Because technological progress is modeled here as labor augmenting, it fits into 
the model in much the same way as population growth. Technological progress 
does not cause the actual number of workers to increase, but because each worker 
in effect comes with more units of labor over time, technological progress causes 
the effective number of workers to increase. Thus, the analytic tools we used in 
Chapter 8 to study the Solow model with population growth are easily adapted 
to studying the Solow model with labor-augmenting technological progress.
We begin by reconsidering our notation. Previously, before we added tech­
nological progress, we analyzed the economy in terms of quantities per worker; 
now we can generalize that approach by analyzing the economy in terms of 
quantities per effective worker. We now let k  K/(L  E) stand for capital per 
effective worker and y  Y/(L  E) stand for output per effective worker. With 
these definitions, we can again write y  f(k).
Our analysis of the economy proceeds just as it did when we examined popu­
lation growth. The equation showing the evolution of k over time becomes
Dk  sf(k)  (  n  g)k.
As before, the change in the capital stock Dk equals investment sf(k) minus 
break-even investment (  n  g)k. Now, however, because k  K/(L  E), 
break-even investment includes three terms: to keep k constant, dk is needed 
to replace depreciating capital, nk is needed to provide capital for new workers, 

244 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
and gk is needed to provide capital for the new “effective workers” created by 
technological progress.1
As shown in Figure 9-1, the inclusion of technological progress does not sub­
stantially alter our analysis of the steady state. There is one level of k, denoted k*, 
at which capital per effective worker and output per effective worker are constant. 
As before, this steady state represents the long-run equilibrium of the economy.
The Effects of Technological Progress
Table 9-1 shows how four key variables behave in the steady state with techno­
logical progress. As we have just seen, capital per effective worker k is constant 
in the steady state. Because y  f(k), output per effective worker is also constant. 
It is these quantities per effective worker that are steady in the steady state.
From this information, we can also infer what is happening to variables that 
are not expressed in units per effective worker. For instance, consider output per 
actual worker Y/L  y  E. Because y is constant in the steady state and E is 
growing at rate g, output per worker must also be growing at rate g in the steady 
state. Similarly, the economy’s total output is Y  y  (E  L). Because y is 
constant in the steady state, E is growing at rate g, and L is growing at rate n, total

analyzed in Chapter 8. In particular, if the efficiency of labor is constant at E  1, then g  0, and 
the definitions of k and y reduce to our previous definitions. In this case, the more general model 
considered here simplifies precisely to the Chapter 8 version of the Solow model.

With the addition of technological progress, our model can finally explain the 
sustained increases in standards of living that we observe. That is, we have shown that 
technological progress can lead to sustained growth in output per worker. By contrast, 
a high rate of saving leads to a high rate of growth only until the steady state is 
reached. Once the economy is in steady state, the rate of growth of output per worker 
depends only on the rate of technological progress. According to the Solow model, only 
technological progress can explain sustained growth and persistently rising living standards.
The introduction of technological progress also modifies the criterion for the 
Golden Rule. The Golden Rule level of capital is now defined as the steady state that 
maximizes consumption per effective worker. Following the same arguments that we 
have used before, we can show that steady-state consumption per effective worker is
c*  f(k*)  (d  n  g)k*.
Steady-state consumption is maximized if
MPK  d  n  g,
or
MPK  d  n  g.
That is, at the Golden Rule level of capital, the net marginal product of capital, 
MPK  d, equals the rate of growth of total output, n  g. Because actual 
economies experience both population growth and technological progress, we 
must use this criterion to evaluate whether they have more or less capital than 
they would at the Golden Rule steady state.

Balanced Growth
According to the Solow model, technological progress causes the values of many 
variables to rise together in the steady state. This property, called balanced growth, 
does a good job of describing the long-run data for the U.S. economy.
Consider first output per worker Y/L and the capital stock per worker K/L. 
According to the Solow model, in the steady state both of these variables grow 
at g, the rate of technological progress. U.S. data for the past half-century show 
that output per worker and the capital stock per worker have in fact grown at 
approximately the same rate—about 2 percent per year. To put it another way, the 
capital–output ratio has remained approximately constant over time.
Technological progress also affects factor prices. Problem 4(d) at the end of 
this chapter asks you to show that, in the steady state, the real wage grows at 
the rate of technological progress. The real rental price of capital, however, is 
constant over time. Again, these predictions hold true for the United States. 
Over the past 50 years, the real wage has increased about 2 percent per year; it 
has increased at about the same rate as real GDP per worker. Yet the real rental 
price of capital (measured as real capital income divided by the capital stock) has 
remained about the same.
The Solow model’s prediction about factor prices—and the success of this 
prediction—is especially noteworthy when contrasted with Karl Marx’s theory 
of the development of capitalist economies. Marx predicted that the return 
to capital would decline over time and that this would lead to economic and 
political crisis. Economic history has not supported Marx’s prediction, which 
partly explains why we now study Solow’s theory of growth rather than Marx’s.
Imagine life a hundred years from now. Because 
of economic growth, average incomes will have 
risen substantially. If labor-augmenting techno­
logical change continues at a rate of, say, 2 per­
cent per year, then over the course of a century 
the real amount earned per unit of labor will 
increase more than sevenfold. How do you think 
such a massive increase in living standards will 
affect the lives of most people?
That is precisely the question the renowned 
British economist John Maynard Keynes asked in 
a famous essay written in 1930 called Economic 
Possibilities for Our Grandchildren. Keynes noted 
that throughout much of human history, eco­
nomic growth was meager or nonexistent. He 
wrote, “From the earliest times of which we have 
record—back, say, to two thousand years before 
Christ, down to the beginning of the eighteenth 
century—there was no very great change in the 
standard of life of the average man living in 
the civilised centres of the earth.” But then the 
Industrial Revolution occurred, and modern eco­
nomic growth began. “In spite of an enormous 
growth in the population of the world, which 
it has been necessary to equip with houses and 
machines, the average standard of life in Europe 
and the United States has been raised, I think, 
about fourfold.” Keynes projected that this rapid 
growth would likely continue. He wrote, “the 
standard of life in progressive countries one 
hundred years hence will be between four and 
eight times as high as it is.”
Keynes then discussed the social impact 
of such a large increase in living standards.

He concluded that with such abundance, satisfy­
ing most of our basic needs and material desires 
(what Keynes called “the economic problem”) 
would be easy. He wrote,
I draw the conclusion that, assuming no important 
wars and no important increase in population, the 
economic problem may be solved, or be at least 
within sight of solution, within a hundred years. 
This means that the economic problem is not—if we 
look into the future—the permanent problem of the 
human race.
Why, you may ask, is this so startling? It is startling 
because—if, instead of looking into the future, we 
look into the past—we find that the economic prob­
lem, the struggle for subsistence, always has been 
hitherto the primary, most pressing problem of the 
human race—not only of the human race, but of the 
whole of the biological kingdom from the beginnings 
of life in its most primitive forms.
Thus we have been expressly evolved by nature, 
with all our impulses and deepest instincts, for the 
purpose of solving the economic problem. If the eco­
nomic problem is solved, mankind will be deprived 
of its traditional purpose.
Keynes reasoned that with labor productivity 
so high, we wouldn’t need to work very long to 
produce all goods and services required for a 
good life. He suggested that a workweek of only 
15 hours would do. The problem he foresaw: 
How would we use all the extra leisure time to 
give ourselves happy and satisfying lives? He 
wrote, “There is no country and no people, 
I think, who can look forward to the age of lei­
sure and of abundance without a dread. For we 
have been trained too long to strive and not to 
enjoy. It is a fearful problem for the ordinary per­
son, with no special talents, to occupy himself.”
With the benefit of hindsight, how did 
Keynes’s prognostications do? We have not yet 
reached the year 2030, but it is already clear 
that Keynes’s optimistic projection about liv­
ing standards was prescient and, if anything, 
conservative. Advanced nations like the United 
States and United Kingdom are on track to reach 
and perhaps even exceed the four- to eight-fold 
increase that Keynes forecast. But Keynes was 
wrong about the great rise in leisure. To be sure, 
people now have shorter workweeks and longer 
retirement than they did in Keynes’s day, but they 
work far more than Keynes thought they would. 
In the United States today, the average workweek 
for all employees is about 35 hours.
One development that Keynes might not have 
fully appreciated is that much economic growth 
takes the form of new goods and services that 
were not available in the past. We work today 
not only to provide ourselves food, clothing, 
and shelter but also to buy iPhones, flat-screen 
TVs, and the latest version of Grand Theft Auto. 
Economic growth might lead to satiation if it 
meant only producing more of the same goods 
and services, but satiation may be harder to 
reach if growth also means increased variety of 
goods and services.
Perhaps Keynes merely got the time period 
wrong when making his prediction about lei­
sure. If labor productivity increases by 2 per­
cent per year for two centuries, so that it rises 
to more than fiftyfold what it was in Keynes’s 
time, your grandchildren may well decide to cut 
back their work hours and enjoy the vast quan­
tities of leisure that Keynes envisioned. If so, 
how will they use their time? Will they devote 
many hours to playing Grand Theft Auto: 2130 
edition? Or will they find some more gratifying 
activity, maybe one that today we cannot even 
imagine?
Convergence
If you travel around the world, you will see tremendous variation in living 
standards. The world’s poor countries have average levels of income per person 
that are less than one-tenth the average levels in the world’s rich countries. 
These differences in income are reflected in almost every measure of the quality 
of life—from the prevalence of TVs, cell phones, and Internet access to clean 
water availability, infant mortality, and life expectancy.

248 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
Much research has been devoted to the question of whether economies 
move toward each other over time. In particular, do economies that start 
off poor subsequently grow faster than economies that start off rich? If 
they do, then the world’s poor economies will tend to catch up with the 
world’s  rich economies. This process of catch-up is called convergence. If 
convergence does not occur, then countries that start off behind are likely 
to remain poor.
The Solow model makes clear predictions about when convergence should 
occur. According to the model, whether two economies will converge depends 
on why they differ in the first place. On the one hand, suppose two economies 
happen by historical accident to start off with different capital stocks, but they 
have the same steady state, as determined by their saving rates, population 
growth rates, and efficiency of labor. In this case, we should expect the two 
economies to converge; the poorer economy with the smaller capital stock 
will naturally grow more quickly to reach the steady state. (In a Case Study in 
Chapter 8, we applied this logic to explain rapid growth in Germany and Japan 
after World War II.) On the other hand, if two economies have different steady 
states, perhaps because the economies have different rates of saving, then we 
should not expect convergence. Instead, each economy will approach its own 
steady state.
Experience is consistent with this analysis. In samples of economies with 
similar cultures and policies, studies find that economies converge to one another 
at a rate of about 2 percent per year. That is, the gap between rich and poor 
economies closes by about 2 percent each year. An example is the economies of 
individual American states. For historical reasons, such as the Civil War of the 
1860s, income levels varied greatly among states at the end of the nineteenth 
century. Yet these differences have slowly disappeared over time. This conver­
gence can be explained with the Solow model under the assumption that those 
state economies had different starting points but are approaching a common 
steady state.
In international data, a more complex picture emerges. When researchers 
examine only data on income per person, they find little evidence of conver­
gence: countries that start off poor do not grow faster on average than countries 
that start off rich. This finding suggests that different countries have different 
steady states. If statistical techniques are used to control for some of the deter­
minants of the steady state, such as saving rates, population growth rates, and 
accumulation of human capital (education), then once again the data show 
convergence at a rate of about 2 percent per year. In other words, the economies 
of the world exhibit conditional convergence: they appear to be converging to their 
own steady states, which in turn are determined by such variables as saving, 
population growth, and human capital.2

Factor Accumulation Versus Production Efficiency
As a matter of accounting, international differences in income per person can be 
attributed to either differences in the factors of production, such as the quanti­
ties of physical and human capital, or differences in the efficiency with which 
economies use their factors of production. That is, a worker in a poor country 
may be poor because she lacks tools and skills or because the tools and skills 
she has are not being put to their best use. To describe this issue in terms of the 
Solow model, the question is whether the large gap between rich and poor is 
explained by (1) differences in capital accumulation (including human capital) or 
(2) differences in the production function.
Much research has attempted to estimate the relative importance of these two 
sources of income disparities. The exact answer varies from study to study, but 
both factor accumulation and production efficiency appear important. Moreover, 
a common finding is that they are positively correlated: nations with high levels 
of physical and human capital also tend to use those factors efficiently.3
There are several ways to interpret this positive correlation. One hypothesis is 
that an efficient economy may encourage capital accumulation. For example, a 
person in a well-functioning economy may have greater resources and incentive 
to stay in school and accumulate human capital. Another hypothesis is that capital 
accumulation may induce greater efficiency. If there are positive externalities to 
physical and human capital, then countries that save and invest more will appear 
to have better production functions (unless the research study accounts for these 
externalities, which is hard to do). Thus, greater production efficiency may cause 
greater factor accumulation, or the other way around.
A final hypothesis is that both factor accumulation and production efficiency 
are driven by a common third variable. Perhaps the common third variable is 
the quality of the nation’s institutions, including the government’s policymaking 
process. As one economist put it, when governments screw up, they screw up big 
time. Bad policies, such as high inflation, excessive budget deficits, widespread 
market interference, and rampant corruption, often go hand in hand. We should 
not be surprised that economies exhibiting these maladies both accumulate less 
capital and fail to use the capital they have as efficiently as they might.
Good Management as a Source of Productivity
Incomes vary around the world in part because some nations have higher 
production efficiency than others. A similar phenomenon is observed within 
nations: some firms exhibit greater production efficiency than others. Why 
might that be?

per Worker Than Others?” Quarterly Journal of Economics 114 (February 1999): 83–116; Peter J.

Gone Too Far?” NBER Macroeconomics Annual (1997): 73–103.

250 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
One possible answer is management practices. Some firms are well run; 
others less so. A well-run firm uses state-of-the-art operations, monitors the 
performance of its workers, sets challenging but reasonable targets for perfor­
mance, and provides incentives for workers to put forth their best efforts. Good 
management means that a firm is getting the most it can from the factors of 
production it uses.
An influential study by Nicholas Bloom and John Van Reenen documents the 
importance of good management, as well as some of the reasons that not all firms 
have it. Bloom and Van Reenen began by surveying 732 medium-sized manufac­
turing firms in four nations: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and 
Germany. They asked various questions about how firms were managed and then 
graded each firm on how well it conformed to best practices. For example, a firm 
that said it promoted employees on the basis of performance was graded higher 
than one that said it promoted employees on the basis of how long they had been 
at the firm.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Bloom and Van Reenen report substantial heteroge­
neity in the quality of management. In each of the four countries, some firms 
are well run and some are badly run. More noteworthy is that the distribution 
of management quality differed substantially across the four nations. Firms in the 
United States have the highest average grade, followed by Germany, then France, 
and finally the United Kingdom. Much of the cross-country variation comes 
from the prevalence of especially badly run firms: firms with the lowest manage­
ment grades are much more common in the United Kingdom and France than 
they are in the United States and Germany.
The study’s next finding is that these management grades are correlated with 
measures of firm performance. Holding other things equal (such as the size of the 
firm’s capital stock and work force), well-managed firms have more sales, greater 
profits, higher stock market values, and lower bankruptcy rates.
If good management leads to all these desirable outcomes, why don’t all firms 
adopt the best practices? Bloom and Van Reenen offer two explanations for the 
persistence of bad management.
The first is the absence of competition. When a firm with poor management 
practices is shielded from vigorous competition, its managers can take the easy 
life and muddle through. By contrast, when a firm operates in a highly competi­
tive market, bad management tends to lead to losses, which eventually induce 
the firm to close its doors. As a result, in competitive markets, only firms with 
good management survive. One determinant of competition is openness to trade: 
when firms have to compete with similar firms around the world, it is hard to 
maintain bad management practices.
A second explanation for the persistence of bad management is primogeniture—
the tradition of some family-owned firms to appoint as chief executive officer 
(CEO) the family’s eldest son. This practice means that the CEO position may not 
be going to the person who is most qualified for it. Moreover, if the eldest son knows 
he will get the job by virtue of birth order, rather than having to compete for it with 
professional managers or at least other family members, he may have less incentive 
to put in the effort necessary to become a good manager. Indeed, Bloom and Van 
Reenan report that firms with eldest sons as CEOs are more likely to earn poor

Policies to Promote Growth
So far we have used the Solow model to uncover the theoretical relationships 
among the different sources of economic growth, and we have discussed some of 
the empirical work that describes actual growth experiences. We can now use the 
theory and evidence to help guide our thinking about economic policy.
Evaluating the Rate of Saving
According to the Solow growth model, how much a nation saves and invests 
is a key determinant of its citizens’ standard of living. So let’s begin our policy 
discussion with a natural question: Is the rate of saving in the U.S. economy too 
low, too high, or about right?
As we have seen, the saving rate determines the steady-state levels of capital 
and output. One particular saving rate produces the Golden Rule steady state, 
which maximizes consumption per worker and thus economic well-being. The 
Golden Rule provides the benchmark against which we can compare the U.S. 
economy.
To decide whether the U.S. economy is at, above, or below the Golden 
Rule steady state, we need to compare the marginal product of capital net of 
depreciation (MPK  d) with the growth rate of total output (n  g). As we 
established in Section 9-1, at the Golden Rule steady state, MPK  d  n  g. If 
the economy is operating with less capital than in the Golden Rule steady state, 
then diminishing marginal product tells us that MPK  d  n  g. In this case, 
increasing the rate of saving will increase capital accumulation and economic 
growth and, eventually, lead to a steady state with higher consumption (although 
consumption will be lower for part of the transition to the new steady state). On 
the other hand, if the economy has more capital than in the Golden Rule steady 
state, then MPK  d  n  g. In this case, capital accumulation is excessive: 
reducing the rate of saving will lead to higher consumption both immediately 
and in the long run.

management grades. They also find that primogeniture is far more common in the 
United Kingdom and France than it is in the United States and Germany, perhaps 
because of the long-lasting influence of the Norman tradition.
The bottom line from this study is that differences in management practices 
can help explain why some nations have higher productivity and thus higher 
incomes than others. These differences in management, in turn, may be traced to 
differences in degrees of competition and historical traditions.4 n

Firms and Countries,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics (2007) 122 (4): 1351–1408. In more recent 
work, Bloom, Van Reenan, and coauthors have extended their surveys to other nations. They report 
that, on average, American, Japanese, and German firms are the best managed, whereas firms in 
developing countries, such as Brazil, China, and India, tend to be poorly managed. See Nicholas 
Bloom, Christos Genakos, Raffaella Sadun, and John Van Reenen, “Management Practices Across 
Firms and Countries,” NBER Working Paper No. 17850, February 2012.

252 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
To make this comparison for a real economy, such as the U.S. economy, we 
need an estimate of the growth rate of output (n  g) and an estimate of the 
net marginal product of capital (MPK  d). Real GDP in the United States 
grows an average of 3 percent per year, so n  g  0.03. We can estimate the net 
marginal product of capital from the following three facts:
	1.	The capital stock is about 2.5 times one year’s GDP.
	2.	Depreciation of capital is about 10 percent of GDP.
	3.	Capital income is about 30 percent of GDP.
Using the notation of our model (and the result from Chapter 3 that capital 
owners earn income of MPK for each unit of capital), we can write these facts as
	1.	k  2.5y.
	2.	dk  0.1y.
	3.	MPK  k  0.3y.
We solve for the rate of depreciation d by dividing equation 2 by equation 1:
	
dk/k  (0.1y)/(2.5y)
d  0.04.
And we solve for the marginal product of capital MPK by dividing equation 3 
by equation 1:
(MPK  k)/k  (0.3y)/(2.5y)
	
MPK  0.12.
Thus, about 4 percent of the capital stock depreciates each year, and the marginal 
product of capital is about 12 percent per year. The net marginal product of 
capital, MPK  , is about 8 percent per year.
We can now see that the return to capital (MPK    8 percent per year) 
is well in excess of the economy’s average growth rate (n  g  3 percent per 
year). This fact, together with our previous analysis, indicates that the capital 
stock in the U.S. economy is well below the Golden Rule level. In other words, 
if the United States saved and invested a higher fraction of its income, it would 
grow more rapidly and eventually reach a steady state with higher consumption.
This conclusion is not unique to the U.S. economy. When calculations similar to 
those above are done for other economies, the results are similar. The possibility of 
excessive saving and capital accumulation beyond the Golden Rule level is intrigu­
ing as a matter of theory, but it appears not to be a problem that actual economies 
face. In practice, economists are more often concerned with insufficient saving. It is 
this kind of calculation that provides the intellectual foundation for this concern.5

Lawrence H. Summers, and Richard J. Zeckhauser, “Assessing Dynamic Efficiency: Theory and 
Evidence,” Review of Economic Studies 56 (1989): 1–19.

Changing the Rate of Saving
The preceding calculations show that to move the U.S. economy toward the 
Golden Rule steady state, policymakers should enact policies to encourage 
national saving. But how can they do that? We saw in Chapter 3 that, as a matter 
of simple accounting, higher national saving means higher public saving, higher 
private saving, or some combination of the two. Much of the debate over poli­
cies to increase growth centers on which of these options is likely to be most 
effective.
The most direct way in which the government affects national saving is 
through public saving—the difference between what the government receives in 
tax revenue and what it spends. When its spending exceeds its revenue, the gov­
ernment runs a budget deficit, which represents negative public saving. As we saw 
in Chapter 3, a budget deficit raises interest rates and crowds out investment; the 
resulting reduction in the capital stock is part of the burden of the national debt 
on future generations. Conversely, if it spends less than it raises in revenue, the 
government runs a budget surplus, which it can use to retire some of the national 
debt and stimulate investment.
The government also affects national saving by influencing private saving—
the saving done by households and firms. In particular, how much people decide 
to save depends on the incentives they face, and these incentives are altered by 
a variety of public policies. Many economists argue that high tax rates on capi­
tal—including the corporate income tax, the federal income tax, the estate tax, 
and many state income and estate taxes—discourage private saving by reducing 
the rate of return that savers earn. On the other hand, tax-exempt retirement 
accounts, such as IRAs, are designed to encourage private saving by giving pref­
erential treatment to income saved in these accounts. Some economists have pro­
posed increasing the incentive to save by replacing the current system of income 
taxation with a system of consumption taxation.
Many disagreements over public policy are rooted in different views about 
how much private saving responds to incentives. For example, suppose that the 
government increased the amount that people can put into tax-exempt retire­
ment accounts. Would people respond to this incentive by saving more? Or, 
instead, would people merely transfer saving already done in taxable savings 
accounts into these tax-advantaged accounts, reducing tax revenue and thus pub­
lic saving without any stimulus to private saving? The desirability of the policy 
depends on the answers to these questions. Unfortunately, despite much research 
on this issue, no consensus has emerged.
Allocating the Economy’s Investment
The Solow model makes the simplifying assumption that there is only one type 
of capital. In the world, of course, there are many types. Private businesses invest 
in traditional types of capital, such as bulldozers and steel plants, and newer types 
of capital, such as computers and robots. The government invests in various forms 
of public capital, called infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and sewer systems.

254 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
In addition, there is human capital—the knowledge and skills that workers 
acquire through education, from early-childhood programs such as Head Start 
to on-the-job training for adults in the labor force. Although the capital variable 
in the Solow model is usually interpreted as including only physical capital, in 
many ways human capital is analogous to physical capital. Like physical capital, 
human capital increases our ability to produce goods and services. Raising the 
level of human capital requires investment in the form of teachers, libraries, and 
student time. Research on economic growth has emphasized that human capital 
is at least as important as physical capital in explaining international differences 
in standards of living. One way of modeling this fact is to give the variable we 
call “capital” a broader definition that includes both human and physical capital.6
Policymakers trying to promote economic growth must confront the issue 
of what kinds of capital the economy needs most. In other words, what kinds 
of capital yield the highest marginal products? To a large extent, policymakers 
can rely on the marketplace to allocate the pool of saving to alternative types 
of investment. Those industries with the highest marginal products of capital 
will naturally be most willing to borrow at market interest rates to finance new 
investment. Many economists advocate that the government should merely cre­
ate a “level playing field” for different types of capital—for example, by ensuring 
that the tax system treats all forms of capital equally. The government can then 
rely on the market to allocate capital efficiently.
Other economists have suggested that the government should actively encour­
age particular forms of capital. Suppose, for instance, that technological advance 
occurs as a by-product of certain economic activities. This would happen if new 
and improved production processes are devised during the process of building 
capital (a phenomenon called learning by doing) and if these ideas become part 
of society’s pool of knowledge. Such a by-product is called a technological exter­
nality (or a knowledge spillover). In the presence of such externalities, the social 
returns to capital exceed the private returns, and the benefits of increased capital 
accumulation to society are greater than the Solow model suggests.7 Moreover, 
some types of capital accumulation may yield greater externalities than others. 
If, for example, installing robots yields greater technological externalities than 
building a new steel mill, then perhaps the government should use the tax laws 
to encourage investment in robots. The success of such an industrial policy, as it is 
sometimes called, requires that the government be able to accurately measure the 
externalities of different economic activities so it can give the correct incentive 
to each activity.
6Earlier in this chapter, when we were interpreting K as only physical capital, human capital was 
folded into the efficiency-of-labor parameter E. The alternative approach suggested here is to include 
human capital as part of K instead, so E represents technology but not human capital. If K is given this 
broader interpretation, then much of what we call labor income is really the return to human capital. 
As a result, the true capital share is much larger than the traditional Cobb–Douglas value of about 
1/3. For more on this topic, see N. Gregory Mankiw, David Romer, and David N. Weil, “A Contri­
bution to the Empirics of Economic Growth,” Quarterly Journal of Economics (May 1992): 407–437.

Most economists are skeptical about industrial policies for two reasons. First, 
measuring the externalities from different sectors is virtually impossible. If policy 
is based on poor measurements, its effects might be close to random and, thus, 
worse than no policy at all. Second, the political process is far from perfect. Once 
the government gets into the business of rewarding specific industries with sub­
sidies and tax breaks, the rewards are as likely to be based on political clout as on 
the magnitude of externalities.
One type of capital that necessarily involves the government is public capi­
tal. Local, state, and federal governments are always deciding if and when they 
should borrow to finance new roads, bridges, and transit systems. In 2009, one 
of President Barack Obama’s first economic proposals was to increase spending 
on such infrastructure. This policy was motivated by a desire partly to increase 
short-run aggregate demand (a goal we will examine later in this book) and 
partly to provide public capital and enhance long-run economic growth. 
Among economists, this policy had both defenders and critics. Yet all of them 
agree that measuring the marginal product of public capital is difficult. Private 
capital generates an easily measured rate of profit for the firm owning the capi­
tal, whereas the benefits of public capital are more diffuse. Furthermore, while 
private capital investment is made by investors spending their own money, the 
allocation of resources for public capital involves the political process and tax­
payer funding. It is all too common to see “bridges to nowhere” being built 
simply because the local senator or congressman has the political muscle to get 
funds approved.
CASE STUDY
Industrial Policy in Practice
Policymakers and economists have long debated whether the government should 
promote certain industries and firms because they are strategically important 
for the economy. In the United States, the debate goes back over two centu­
ries. Alexander Hamilton, the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, favored tariffs 
on certain imports to encourage the development of domestic manufacturing. 
The Tariff of 1789 was the second act passed by the new federal government. 
The ­tariff helped manufacturers, but it hurt farmers, who had to pay more for 
foreign-made products. Because the North was home to most of the manu­
facturers, while the South had more farmers, the tariff was one source of the 
regional tensions that eventually led to the Civil War.
Advocates of a significant government role in promoting technology can point 
to some recent successes. For example, the precursor of the modern Internet is 
a system called Arpanet, which was established by an arm of the U.S. Depart­
ment of Defense as a way for information to flow among military installations. 
There is little doubt that the Internet has been associated with large advances in 
productivity and that the government had a hand in its creation. According to 
proponents of industrial policy, this example illustrates how the government can 
help jump-start an emerging technology.

256 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
Yet governments can also make mistakes when they try to supplant private 
business decisions. Japan’s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) 
is sometimes viewed as a successful practitioner of industrial policy, but it once 
tried to stop Honda from expanding its business from motorcycles to auto­
mobiles. MITI thought that the nation already had enough car manufacturers. 
Fortunately, the government lost this battle, and Honda turned into one of the 
world’s largest and most profitable car companies. Soichiro Honda, the company’s 
founder, once said, “Probably I would have been even more successful had we 
not had MITI.”
More recently, government policy has aimed to promote “green technologies.” 
In particular, the U.S. federal government has subsidized the production of ener­
gy in ways that yield lower carbon emissions, which are thought to contribute to 
global climate change. It is too early to judge the long-run success of this policy, 
but there have been some short-run embarrassments. In 2011, a manufacturer of 
solar panels called Solyndra declared bankruptcy just two years after the federal 
government granted it a $535 million loan guarantee.
The debate over industrial policy will surely continue in the years to come. 
The final judgment about this kind of government intervention in the market 
requires evaluating both the efficiency of unfettered markets and the ability of 
governmental institutions to identify technologies worthy of support. n
Establishing the Right Institutions
As we discussed earlier, economists who study international differences in the 
standard of living attribute some of these differences to the inputs of physical and 
human capital and some to the productivity with which these inputs are used. 
One reason nations may have different levels of production 
efficiency is that they have different institutions guiding the 
allocation of scarce resources. Creating the right institutions 
is important for ensuring that resources are allocated to their 
best use.
Perhaps the clearest current example of the importance 
of institutions is the comparison between North and South 
Korea. For many centuries, these two nations were com­
bined with a common government, heritage, culture, and 
economy. Yet in the aftermath of World War II, an agree­
ment between the United States and the Soviet Union 
split Korea in two. Above the thirty-eighth parallel, North 
Korea established institutions based on the Soviet model of 
authoritarian communism. Below the thirty-eighth parallel, 
South Korea established institutions based on the American 
model of democratic capitalism. Today, the difference in 
economic development could not be more stark. GDP per 
person in North Korea is less than one-tenth what it is in 
South Korea. This difference is visible in satellite photos 
North and South Korea from space.

taken at night. South Korea is well lit—its widespread use of electricity a sign 
of advanced economic development. North Korea, in contrast, is shrouded in 
darkness.
Among democratic capitalist nations, there are important but more subtle 
institutional differences. One example is a nation’s legal tradition. Some coun­
tries, such as the United States, Australia, India, and Singapore, are former 
colonies of the United Kingdom and, therefore, have English-style common-law 
systems. Other nations, such as Italy, Spain, and most of those in Latin America, 
have legal traditions that evolved from the French Napoleonic Code. Studies 
have found that legal protections for shareholders and creditors are stronger 
in English-style than French-style legal systems. As a result, the English-style 
countries have better-developed capital markets. Nations with better-developed 
capital markets, in turn, experience more rapid growth because it is easier for 
small and start-up companies to finance investment projects, leading to a more 
efficient allocation of the nation’s capital.8
Another important institutional difference across countries is the quality of 
government and honesty of government officials. Ideally, governments should 
provide a “helping hand” to the market system by protecting property rights, 
enforcing contracts, promoting competition, prosecuting fraud, and so on. Yet 
governments sometimes diverge from this ideal and act more like a “grabbing 
hand” by using the authority of the state to enrich a few powerful individuals at 
the expense of the broader community. Empirical studies have shown that the 
extent of corruption in a nation is indeed a significant determinant of economic 
growth.9
Adam Smith, the great eighteenth-century economist, was well aware of the 
role of institutions in economic growth. He once wrote, “Little else is requisite 
to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism 
but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice: all the rest being 
brought about by the natural course of things.” Sadly, many nations do not enjoy 
these three simple advantages.

The Colonial Origins of Modern Institutions
International data show a remarkable correlation between latitude and economic 
prosperity: nations closer to the equator typically have lower levels of income 
per person than nations farther from the equator. This fact is true in both the 
northern and southern hemispheres.
What explains the correlation? Some economists have suggested that the 
tropical climates near the equator have a direct negative impact on productivity. 
CASE STUDY

258 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
In the heat of the tropics, agriculture is more difficult, and disease is more preva­
lent. This makes the production of goods and services more difficult.
Although the direct impact of geography is one reason tropical nations tend 
to be poor, it is not the whole story. Research by Daron Acemoglu, Simon John­
son, and James Robinson has suggested an indirect mechanism—the impact of 
geography on institutions. Here is their explanation, presented in several steps:
	1.	In the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, tropical climates 
presented European settlers with an increased risk of disease, especially 
malaria and yellow fever. As a result, when Europeans were colonizing 
much of the rest of the world, they avoided settling in tropical areas, such 
as most of Africa and Central America. The European settlers preferred 
areas with more moderate climates and better health conditions, such as the 
regions that are now the United States, Canada, and New Zealand.
	2.	In those areas where Europeans settled in large numbers, the settlers estab­
lished European-style institutions that protected individual property rights and 
limited the power of government. By contrast, in tropical climates, the colonial 
powers often set up “extractive” institutions, including authoritarian govern­
ments, so they could take advantage of the area’s natural resources. These insti­
tutions enriched the colonizers, but they did little to foster economic growth.
	3.	Although the era of colonial rule is now long over, the early institutions 
that the European colonizers established are strongly correlated with the 
modern institutions in the former colonies. In tropical nations, where the 
colonial powers set up extractive institutions, there is typically less protec­
tion of property rights even today. When the colonizers left, the extractive 
institutions remained and were simply taken over by new ruling elites.
	4.	The quality of institutions is a key determinant of economic performance. 
Where property rights are well protected, people have more incentive to 
make the investments that lead to economic growth. Where property rights 
are less respected, as is typically the case in tropical nations, investment and 
growth tend to lag behind.
This research suggests that much of the international variation in living standards 
that we observe today is a result of the long reach of history.10 n

Encouraging Technological Progress
The Solow model shows that sustained growth in income per worker must come 
from technological progress. The Solow model, however, takes technological 
progress as exogenous; it does not explain it. Unfortunately, the determinants of 
technological progress are not well understood.
Despite this limited understanding, many public policies are designed to 
stimulate technological progress. Most of these policies encourage the private 

C H A P T E R  9   Economic Growth II: Technology, Empirics, and Policy  | 259
sector to devote resources to technological innovation. For example, the patent 
system gives a temporary monopoly to inventors of new products; the tax code 
offers tax breaks for firms engaging in research and development; and govern­
ment agencies, such as the National Science Foundation, directly subsidize basic 
research in universities. In addition, as discussed above, proponents of industrial 
policy argue that the government should take a more active role in promoting 
specific industries that are key to rapid technological advance.
In recent years, the encouragement of technological progress has taken on 
an international dimension. Many of the companies that engage in research 
to advance technology are located in the United States and other developed 
nations. Developing nations such as China have an incentive to “free ride” on 
this research by not strictly enforcing intellectual property rights. That is, Chinese 
companies often use ideas developed abroad without compensating the patent 
holders. The United States has strenuously objected to this practice, and China 
has promised to step up enforcement. If intellectual property rights were bet­
ter enforced around the world, firms would have more incentive to engage in 
research, and this would promote worldwide technological progress.
CASE STUDY
Is Free Trade Good for Economic Growth?
At least since Adam Smith, economists have advocated free trade as a policy that 
promotes national prosperity. Here is how Smith put the argument in his 1776 
classic, The Wealth of Nations:
It is a maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make 
at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy. The tailor does not 
attempt to make his own shoes, but buys them of the shoemaker. The shoe­
maker does not attempt to make his own clothes but employs a tailor. . . .
What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be folly 
in that of a great kingdom. If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity 
cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the 
produce of our own industry employed in a way in which we have some advantage.
Today, economists make the case with greater rigor, relying on David Ricardo’s 
theory of comparative advantage as well as more modern theories of interna­
tional trade. According to these theories, a nation open to trade can achieve 
greater production efficiency and a higher standard of living by specializing in 
those goods for which it has a comparative advantage.
A skeptic might point out that this is just a theory. What about the evidence? 
Do nations that permit free trade in fact enjoy greater prosperity? A large body 
of literature addresses precisely this question.
One approach is to look at international data to see if countries that are 
open to trade typically enjoy greater prosperity. The evidence shows that they 
do. Economists Andrew Warner and Jeffrey Sachs studied this question for the 
period from 1970 to 1989. They report that among developed nations, the open 
economies grew at 2.3 percent per year, while the closed economies grew at 
0.7 percent per year. Among developing nations, the open economies grew at 

260 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
4.5 percent per year, while the closed economies again grew at 0.7 percent per 
year. These findings are consistent with Smith’s view that trade enhances prosper­
ity, but they are not conclusive. Correlation does not prove causation. Perhaps 
being closed to trade is correlated with various other restrictive government 
policies, and it is those other policies that retard growth.
A second approach is to look at what happens when closed economies remove 
their trade restrictions. Once again, Smith’s hypothesis fares well. Throughout 
history, when nations open themselves up to the world economy, the typical 
result is a subsequent increase in economic growth. This occurred in Japan in the 
1850s, South Korea in the 1960s, and Vietnam in the 1990s. But once again, cor­
relation does not prove causation. Trade liberalization is often accompanied by 
other reforms aimed to promote growth, and it is hard to disentangle the effects 
of trade from the effects of the other reforms.
A third approach to measuring the impact of trade on growth, proposed 
by economists Jeffrey Frankel and David Romer, is to look at the impact of 
geography. Some countries trade less simply because they are geographically 
disadvantaged. For example, New Zealand is disadvantaged compared to Bel­
gium because it is farther from other populous countries. Similarly, landlocked 
countries are disadvantaged compared to countries with their own seaports. 
Because these geographical characteristics are correlated with trade, but argu­
ably uncorrelated with other determinants of economic prosperity, they can 
be used to identify the causal impact of trade on income. (The statistical tech­
nique, which you may have studied in an econometrics course, is called instru­
mental variables.) After analyzing the data, Frankel and Romer conclude that 
“a rise of one percentage point in the ratio of trade to GDP increases income 
per person by at least one-half percentage point. Trade appears to raise income 
by spurring the accumulation of human and physical capital and by increasing 
output for given levels of capital.”
The overwhelming weight of the evidence from this body of research is that 
Adam Smith was right. Openness to international trade is good for economic 
growth.11 n

Beyond the Solow Model: Endogenous

A chemist, a physicist, and an economist are all trapped on a desert island, trying 
to figure out how to open a can of food.
“Let’s heat the can over the fire until it explodes,” says the chemist.
“No, no,” says the physicist, “let’s drop the can onto the rocks from the top 
of a high tree.”
“I have an idea,” says the economist. “First, we assume a can opener . . .”

This old joke takes aim at how economists use assumptions to simplify—and 
sometimes oversimplify—the problems they face. It is particularly apt when 
evaluating the theory of economic growth. One goal of growth theory is to 
explain the persistent rise in living standards that we observe in most parts of the 
world. The Solow growth model shows that such persistent growth must come 
from technological progress. But where does technological progress come from? 
In the Solow model, it is just assumed!
To fully understand the process of economic growth, we need to go beyond 
the Solow model and develop models that explain technological advance. 
­Models that do this often go by the label endogenous growth theory because 
they reject the Solow model’s assumption of exogenous technological change. 
Although the field of endogenous growth theory is large and sometimes com­
plex, here we get a quick taste of this modern research.12
The Basic Model
To illustrate the idea behind endogenous growth theory, let’s start with a particu­
larly simple production function:
Y 5 AK,
where Y is output, K is the capital stock, and A is a constant measuring the 
amount of output produced for each unit of capital. Notice that this production 
function does not exhibit the property of diminishing returns to capital. One 
extra unit of capital produces A extra units of output, regardless of how much 
capital there is. This absence of diminishing returns to capital is the key difference 
between this endogenous growth model and the Solow model.
Now let’s see what this production function says about economic growth. 
As before, we assume a fraction s of income is saved and invested. We therefore 
describe capital accumulation with an equation similar to those we used previously:
DK 5 sY 2 dK.
This equation states that the change in the capital stock (DK ) equals investment 
(sY ) minus depreciation (dK). Combining this equation with the Y 5 AK pro­
duction function, we obtain, after a bit of manipulation,
DY/Y 5 DK/K 5 sA 2 d.
This equation shows what determines the growth rate of output DY/Y. Notice 
that, as long as sA  d, the economy’s income grows forever, even without the 
assumption of exogenous technological progress.
12This section provides a brief introduction to the large and fascinating literature on endogenous 
growth theory. Early and important contributions to this literature include Paul M. Romer, 
“Increasing Returns and Long-Run Growth,” Journal of Political Economy 94 (October 1986): 
1002–1037; and Robert E. Lucas, Jr., “On the Mechanics of Economic Development,” Journal of 
Monetary Economics 22 (1988): 3–42. The reader can learn more about this topic in the undergradu­
ate textbook by David N. Weil, Economic Growth, 3rd ed. (Pearson, 2013).

262 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
Thus, a simple change in the production function can dramatically alter the 
predictions about economic growth. In the Solow model, saving temporarily 
leads to growth, but diminishing returns to capital eventually force the economy 
to approach a steady state in which growth depends only on exogenous tech­
nological progress. By contrast, in this endogenous growth model, saving and 
investment can lead to persistent growth.
But is it reasonable to abandon the assumption of diminishing returns to 
capital? The answer depends on how we interpret the variable K in the produc­
tion function Y 5 AK. If we take the traditional view that K includes only the 
economy’s stock of plants and equipment, then it is natural to assume diminish­
ing returns. Giving 10 computers to a worker does not make that worker 10 
times as productive as she is with one computer.
Advocates of endogenous growth theory, however, argue that the assumption of 
constant (rather than diminishing) returns to capital is more palatable if K is inter­
preted more broadly. Perhaps the best case can be made for the endogenous growth 
model by viewing knowledge as a type of capital. Clearly, knowledge is a key input 
into the economy’s production—both its production of goods and services and its 
production of new knowledge. Compared to other forms of capital, however, it is 
less natural to assume that knowledge exhibits the property of diminishing returns. 
(Indeed, the increasing pace of scientific and technological innovation over the past 
few centuries has led some economists to argue that there are increasing returns 
to knowledge.) If we accept the view that knowledge is a type of capital, then 
this endogenous growth model with its assumption of constant returns to capital 
becomes a more plausible description of long-run economic growth.
A Two-Sector Model
Although the Y 5 AK model is the simplest example of endogenous growth, the 
theory has gone well beyond this. One line of research has tried to develop mod­
els with more than one sector of production in order to offer a better description 
of the forces that govern technological progress. To see what we might learn from 
such models, let’s sketch out an example.
The economy has two sectors, which we can call manufacturing firms and 
research universities. Firms produce goods and services, which are used for con­
sumption and investment in physical capital. Universities produce a factor of 
production called “knowledge,” which is then freely used in both sectors. The 
economy is described by the production function for firms, the production func­
tion for universities, and the capital-accumulation equation:
	 Y 5 F[K, (1 2 u)LE]	
(production function in manufacturing firms),
	DE 5 g(u)E	
(production function in research universities),
	DK 5 sY 2 dK	
(capital accumulation),
where u is the fraction of the labor force in universities (and 1 2 u is the frac­
tion in manufacturing), E is the stock of knowledge (which in turn determines 
the efficiency of labor), and g is a function that shows how the growth in 

C H A P T E R  9   Economic Growth II: Technology, Empirics, and Policy  | 263
knowledge depends on the fraction of the labor force in universities. The rest of 
the notation is standard. As usual, the production function for the manufacturing 
firms is assumed to have constant returns to scale: if we double both the amount 
of physical capital (K ) and the effective number of workers in manufacturing 
[(1 2 u)LE], we double the output of goods and services (Y ).
This model is a cousin of the Y 5 AK model. Most important, this economy 
exhibits constant (rather than diminishing) returns to capital, as long as capital is 
broadly defined to include knowledge. In particular, if we double both physical 
capital K and knowledge E, then we double the output of both sectors in the 
economy. As a result, like the Y 5 AK model, this model can generate persistent 
growth without the assumption of exogenous shifts in the production function. 
Here persistent growth arises endogenously because the creation of knowledge 
in universities never slows down.
At the same time, however, this model is also a cousin of the Solow growth 
model. If u, the fraction of the labor force in universities, is held constant, then 
the efficiency of labor E grows at the constant rate g(u). This result of constant 
growth in the efficiency of labor at rate g is precisely the assumption made in the 
Solow model with technological progress. Moreover, the rest of the model—the 
manufacturing production function and the capital-accumulation equation—
also resembles the rest of the Solow model. As a result, for any given value of u, 
this endogenous growth model works just like the Solow model.
There are two key decision variables in this model. As in the Solow 
model, the fraction of output used for saving and investment, s, determines 
the steady-state stock of physical capital. In addition, the fraction of labor in 
universities, u, determines the growth in the stock of knowledge. Both s and 
u affect the level of income, although only u affects the steady-state growth 
rate of income. Thus, this model of endogenous growth takes a small step in 
the direction of showing which societal decisions determine the rate of tech­
nological change.
The Microeconomics of Research and Development
The two-sector endogenous growth model just presented takes us closer to 
understanding technological progress, but it still tells only a rudimentary story 
about the creation of knowledge. If one thinks about the process of research and 
development for even a moment, three facts become apparent. First, although 
knowledge is largely a public good (that is, a good freely available to everyone), 
much research is done in firms that are driven by the profit motive. Second, 
research is profitable because innovations give firms temporary monopolies, 
either because of the patent system or because there is an advantage to being the 
first firm on the market with a new product. Third, when one firm innovates, 
other firms build on that innovation to produce the next generation of innova­
tions. These (essentially microeconomic) facts are not easily connected with the 
(essentially macroeconomic) growth models we have discussed so far.
Some endogenous growth models try to incorporate these facts about 
research and development. Doing this requires modeling both the decisions 

264 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
that firms face as they engage in research and the interactions among firms 
that have some degree of monopoly power over their innovations. Going 
into more detail about these models is beyond the scope of this book, but it 
should be clear already that one virtue of these endogenous growth models 
is that they offer a more complete description of the process of technological 
innovation.
One question these models are designed to address is whether, from the stand­
point of society as a whole, private profit-maximizing firms tend to engage in 
too little or too much research. In other words, is the social return to research 
(which is what society cares about) greater or smaller than the private return 
(which is what motivates individual firms)? It turns out that, as a theoretical mat­
ter, there are effects in both directions. On the one hand, when a firm creates a 
new technology, it makes other firms better off by giving them a base of knowl­
edge on which to build in future research. As Isaac Newton famously remarked, 
“If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” On the other 
hand, when one firm invests in research, it can also make other firms worse off 
if it does little more than become the first to discover a technology that another 
firm would have invented in due course. This duplication of research effort has 
been called the “stepping on toes” effect. Whether firms left to their own devices 
do too little or too much research depends on whether the positive “standing 
on shoulders” externality or the negative “stepping on toes” externality is more 
prevalent.
Although theory alone is ambiguous about whether research effort is more 
or less than optimal, the empirical work in this area is usually less so. Many stud­
ies have suggested the “standing on shoulders” externality is important and, as 
a result, the social return to research is large—often in excess of 40 percent per 
year. This is an impressive rate of return, especially when compared to the return 
to physical capital, which we earlier estimated to be about 8 percent per year. In 
the judgment of some economists, this finding justifies substantial government 
subsidies to research.13
The Process of Creative Destruction
In his 1942 book Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, economist Joseph Schum­
peter suggested that economic progress comes through a process of creative 
destruction. According to Schumpeter, the driving force behind progress is 
the entrepreneur with an idea for a new product, a new way to produce an old 
product, or some other innovation. When the entrepreneur’s firm enters the 
market, it has some degree of monopoly power over its innovation; indeed, it 
is the prospect of monopoly profits that motivates the entrepreneur. The entry 
of the new firm is good for consumers, who now have an expanded range of 
choices, but it is often bad for incumbent producers, who may find it hard to 
13For an overview of the empirical literature on the effects of research, see Zvi Griliches, 
“The Search for R&D Spillovers,” Scandinavian Journal of Economics 94 (1991): 29–47.

C H A P T E R  9   Economic Growth II: Technology, Empirics, and Policy  | 265
compete with the entrant. If the new product is sufficiently better than old ones, 
the incumbents may even be driven out of business. Over time, the process keeps 
renewing itself. The entrepreneur’s firm becomes an incumbent, enjoying high 
profitability until its product is displaced by another entrepreneur with the next 
generation of innovation.
History confirms Schumpeter’s thesis that there are winners and losers from 
technological progress. For example, in England in the early nineteenth century, 
an important innovation was the invention and spread of machines that could 
produce textiles with unskilled workers at low cost. This technological advance 
was good for consumers, who could clothe themselves more cheaply. Yet skilled 
textile artisans in England saw their jobs threatened by new technology, and they 
responded by organizing violent revolts. The rioting workers, called Luddites, 
smashed the weaving machines used in the wool and cotton mills and set the 
homes of the mill owners on fire (a less than creative form of ­destruction). Today, 
the term “Luddite” refers to anyone who opposes technological progress.
A more recent example of creative destruction involves the retailing giant 
Walmart. Although retailing may seem like a relatively static activity, in fact it is 
a sector that has seen sizable rates of technological progress over the past several 
decades. Through better inventory-control, marketing, and personnel-manage­
ment techniques, for example, Walmart has found ways to bring goods to con­
sumers at lower cost than traditional retailers. These changes benefit consumers, 
who can buy goods at lower prices, and the stockholders of Walmart, who share 
in its profitability. But they adversely affect small mom-and-pop stores, which 
find it hard to compete when a Walmart opens nearby.
Faced with the prospect of being the victims of creative destruction, incum­
bent producers often look to the political process to stop the entry of new, more 
efficient competitors. The original Luddites wanted the British government to 
save their jobs by restricting the spread of the new textile technology; instead, 
Parliament sent troops to suppress the Luddite riots. Similarly, in recent years, 
local retailers have sometimes tried to use local land-use regulations to stop 
Walmart from entering their market. The cost of such entry restrictions, however, 
is a slower pace of technological progress. In Europe, where entry regulations 
are stricter than they are in the United States, the economies have not seen the 
emergence of retailing giants like Walmart; as a result, productivity growth in 
retailing has been much lower.14
Schumpeter’s vision of how capitalist economies work has merit as a matter 
of economic history. Moreover, it has inspired some recent work in the theory 
of economic growth. One line of endogenous growth theory, pioneered by 
economists Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt, builds on Schumpeter’s insights 
by modeling technological advance as a process of entrepreneurial innovation 
and creative destruction.15

Conclusion
Long-run economic growth is the single most important determinant of the 
economic well-being of a nation’s citizens. Everything else that macroeconomists 
study—unemployment, inflation, trade deficits, and so on—pales in comparison.
Fortunately, economists know quite a lot about the forces that govern eco­
nomic growth. The Solow growth model and the more recent endogenous 
growth models show how saving, population growth, and technological progress 
interact in determining the level and growth of a nation’s standard of living. 
These theories offer no magic recipe to ensure that an economy achieves rapid 
growth, but they give much insight, and they provide the intellectual frame­
work for much of the debate over public policy aimed at promoting long-run 
economic growth.
Summary
	1.	In the steady state of the Solow growth model, the growth rate of income 
per person is determined solely by the exogenous rate of technological 
progress.
	2.	Many empirical studies have examined the extent to which the Solow 
model can help explain long-run economic growth. The model can explain 
much of what we see in the data, such as balanced growth and conditional 
convergence. Recent studies have also found that international variation in 
standards of living is attributable to a combination of capital accumulation 
and the efficiency with which capital is used.
	3.	In the Solow model with population growth and technological progress, 
the Golden Rule (consumption-maximizing) steady state is characterized 
by equality between the net marginal product of capital (MPK 2 d) and 
the steady-state growth rate of total income (n 1 g). In the U.S. economy, 
the net marginal product of capital is well in excess of the growth rate, 
indicating that the U.S. economy has a lower saving rate and less capital 
than it would have in the Golden Rule steady state.
	4.	Policymakers in the United States and other countries often claim that 
their nations should devote a larger percentage of their output to saving 
and investment. Increased public saving and tax incentives for private ­saving 
are two ways to encourage capital accumulation. Policymakers can also 
­promote economic growth by setting up the appropriate legal and financial 
institutions to allocate resources efficiently and by ensuring proper incen­
tives to encourage research and technological progress.
	5.	Modern theories of endogenous growth attempt to explain the rate of 
technological progress, which the Solow model takes as exogenous. These 
models try to explain the decisions that determine the creation of knowl­
edge through research and development.

Accounting for the Sources of 
Economic Growth
A P P E N D I X
Real GDP in the United States has grown an average of about 3 percent per year 
over the past 50 years. What explains this growth? In Chapter 3 we linked the 
output of the economy to the factors of production—capital and labor—and to 
the production technology. Here we develop a technique called growth accounting 
that divides the growth in output into three different sources: increases in capital, 
increases in labor, and advances in technology. This breakdown provides us with 
a measure of the rate of technological change.
Increases in the Factors of Production
We first examine how increases in the factors of production contribute to increases 
in output. To do this, we start by assuming there is no technological change, so the 
production function relating output Y to capital K and labor L is constant over time:
Y 5 F(K, L).
In this case, the amount of output changes only because the amount of capital 
or labor changes.
Increases in Capital  First, consider changes in capital. If the amount of capi­
tal increases by DK units, by how much does the amount of output increase? 
To answer this question, we need to recall the definition of the marginal product 
of capital MPK:
MPK 5 F(K 1 1, L) 2 F(K, L).
The marginal product of capital tells us how much output increases when 
capital increases by 1 unit. Therefore, when capital increases by DK units, output 
increases by approximately MPK 3 DK.16
For example, suppose that the marginal product of capital is 1/5; that is, an 
additional unit of capital increases the amount of output produced by one-fifth 
of a unit. If we increase the amount of capital by 10 units, we can compute the 
amount of additional output as follows:
	
DY 5 	
MPK	
3	
DK
5 1/5 units of output
unit of capital  3 10 units of capital
	
5 2 units of output.
16Note the word approximately here. This answer is only an approximation because the marginal 
product of capital varies: it falls as the amount of capital increases. An exact answer would take into 
account the fact that each unit of capital has a different marginal product. If the change in K is not 
too large, however, the approximation of a constant marginal product is very accurate.

C H A P T E R  9   Economic Growth II: Technology, Empirics, and Policy  | 271
By increasing capital by 10 units, we obtain 2 more units of output. Thus, we use 
the marginal product of capital to convert changes in capital into changes in output.
Increases in Labor  Next, consider changes in labor. If the amount of labor 
increases by DL units, by how much does output increase? We answer this question 
the same way we answered the question about capital. The marginal product of labor 
MPL tells us how much output changes when labor increases by 1 unit—that is,
	
MPL 5 F(K, L 1 1) 2 F(K, L).
Therefore, when the amount of labor increases by DL units, output increases by 
approximately MPL 3 DL.
For example, suppose that the marginal product of labor is 2; that is, an addi­
tional unit of labor increases the amount of output produced by 2 units. If we 
increase the amount of labor by 10 units, we can compute the amount of addi­
tional output as follows:
	
DY 5 	
MPL	
3	
DL
5 2 units of output
unit of labor
 3 10 units of labor
	
5 20 units of output.
By increasing labor by 10 units, we obtain 20 more units of output. Thus, we use 
the marginal product of labor to convert changes in labor into changes in output.
Increases in Capital and Labor  Finally, let’s consider the more realistic case 
in which both factors of production change. Suppose that the amount of capital 
increases by DK and the amount of labor increases by DL. The increase in output 
then comes from two sources: more capital and more labor. We can divide this 
increase into the two sources using the marginal products of the two inputs:
DY 5 (MPK 3 DK) 1 (MPL 3 DL).
The first term in parentheses is the increase in output resulting from the increase 
in capital; the second term in parentheses is the increase in output resulting from 
the increase in labor. This equation shows us how to attribute growth to each 
factor of production.
We now want to convert this last equation into a form that is easier to inter­
pret and apply to the available data. First, with some algebraic rearrangement, the 
equation becomes17
 DY 
_ 
Y  ​ = ​( ​ MPK 3 K

Y 
​ )​  ​ DK 
_ 
K  ​ 1 ​( ​ MPL 3 L 
_ 
Y 
​ )​  ​ DL 
_ 
L  ​ .
This form of the equation relates the growth rate of output, DY/Y, to the growth 
rate of capital, DK/K, and the growth rate of labor, DL/L.
17Mathematical note: To see that this is equivalent to the previous equation, note that we can mul­
tiply both sides of this equation by Y and thereby cancel Y from three places in which it appears. 
We can cancel the K in the top and bottom of the first term on the right-hand side and the L in 
the top and bottom of the second term on the right-hand side. These algebraic manipulations turn 
this equation into the previous one.

272 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
Next, we need to find some way to measure the terms in parentheses in 
the last equation. In Chapter 3 we showed that the marginal product of capital 
equals its real rental price. Therefore, MPK 3 K is the total return to capital, 
and (MPK 3 K)/Y is capital’s share of output. Similarly, the marginal product of 
labor equals the real wage. Therefore, MPL 3 L is the total compensation that 
labor receives, and (MPL 3 L)/Y is labor’s share of output. Under the assump­
tion that the production function has constant returns to scale, Euler’s theorem 
(which we discussed in Chapter 3) tells us that these two shares sum to 1. In this 
case, we can write
​ DY 
_ 
Y  ​ 5 a ​ DK 
_ 
K  ​ 1 (1 2 a) ​ DL 
_ 
L  ​ ,
where a is capital’s share and (1 2 a) is labor’s share.
This last equation gives us a simple formula for showing how changes in 
inputs lead to changes in output. It shows, in particular, that we must weight 
the growth rates of the inputs by the factor shares. Capital’s share in the United 
States is about 30 percent, that is, a 5 0.30. Therefore, a 10 percent increase 
in the amount of capital (DK/K 5 0.10) leads to a 3 percent increase in the 
amount of output (DY/Y 5 0.03). Similarly, a 10 percent increase in the amount 
of labor (DL/L 5 0.10) leads to a 7 percent increase in the amount of output 
(DY/Y 5 0.07).
Technological Progress
So far in our analysis of the sources of growth, we have been assuming that the 
production function does not change over time. In practice, of course, techno­
logical progress improves the production function. For any given amount of 
inputs, we can produce more output today than we could in the past. We now 
extend the analysis to allow for technological progress.
We include the effects of the changing technology by writing the production 
function as
Y 5 AF(K, L),
where A is a measure of the current level of technology called total factor 
productivity. Output now increases not only because of increases in capital and 
labor but also because of increases in total factor productivity. If total factor 
productivity increases by 1 percent and if the inputs are unchanged, then output 
increases by 1 percent.
Allowing for a changing level of technology adds another term to our equa­
tion accounting for economic growth:

This is the key equation of growth accounting. It identifies and allows us to 
measure the three sources of growth: changes in the amount of capital, changes 
in the amount of labor, and changes in total factor productivity.
Because total factor productivity is not directly observable, it is measured 
indirectly. We have data on the growth in output, capital, and labor; we also have 
data on capital’s share of output. From these data and the growth-accounting 
equation, we can compute the growth in total factor productivity to make sure 
that everything adds up:

_ 
A  ​ 5 ​ DY 
_ 
Y  ​ 2 a ​ DK 
_ 
K  ​ 2 (1 2 a) ​ DL 
_ 
L  ​.
DA/A is the change in output that cannot be explained by changes in inputs. 
Thus, the growth in total factor productivity is computed as a residual—that is, 
as the amount of output growth that remains after we have accounted for the 
determinants of growth that we can measure directly. Indeed, DA/A is some­
times called the Solow residual, after Robert Solow, who first showed how to 
compute it.18
Total factor productivity can change for many reasons. Changes most often 
arise because of increased knowledge about production methods, so the Solow 
residual is frequently used as a measure of technological progress. Yet other 
factors, such as education and government regulation, can affect total factor 
productivity as well. For example, if higher public spending raises the quality 
of education, then workers may become more productive and output may 
rise, which implies higher total factor productivity. In another example, if 
government regulations require firms to purchase capital to reduce pollution 
or increase worker safety, then the capital stock may rise without any increase 
in measured output, which implies lower total factor productivity. Total factor 
productivity captures anything that changes the relation between measured inputs and 
measured output.
The Sources of Growth in the United States
Having learned how to measure the sources of economic growth, we now look 
at the data. Table 9-2 uses U.S. data to measure the contributions of the three 
sources of growth between 1948 and 2013.
This table shows that output in the non-farm business sector grew an average 
of 3.5 percent per year during this time. Of this 3.5 percent, 1.3 percent was 
attributable to increases in the capital stock, 1.0 percent to increases in the labor 
input, and 1.2 percent to increases in total factor productivity. These data show 
18Robert M. Solow, “Technical Change and the Aggregate Production Function,” Review of 
Economics and Statistics 39 (1957): 312–320. It is natural to ask how growth in labor efficiency 
E relates to growth in total factor productivity. One can show that DA/A 5 (1 2 a)DE/E, where 
a is capital’s share. Thus, technological change as measured by growth in the efficiency of labor is 
proportional to technological change as measured by the Solow residual.

274 |  P A R T  I I I   Growth Theory: The Economy in the Very Long Run
that increases in capital, labor, and productivity have contributed almost equally 
to economic growth in the United States.
Table 9-2 also shows that the growth in total factor productivity slowed sub­
stantially during the period from 1972 to 1995. Before 1972, total factor pro­
ductivity grew at 1.8 percent per year; after 1972, it grew at only 0.5 percent per 
year. Accumulated over many years, even a small change in the rate of growth 
has a large effect on economic well-being. Real income in the United States 
in 1995 and beyond was about 35 percent lower than it would have been had 
productivity growth remained at its previous level.

CASE STUDY
The Slowdown in Productivity Growth
Why did the slowdown in productivity growth around 1972 occur? There 
are many hypotheses to explain this adverse phenomenon. Here are four 
of them.
Measurement Problems  One possibility is that the productivity slowdown did 
not really occur and that it shows up in the data because the data are flawed. 
As you may recall from Chapter 2, one problem in measuring inflation is 
correcting for changes in the quality of goods and services. The same issue 
arises when measuring output and productivity. For instance, if technological 
advance leads to more computers being built, then the increase in output and 
productivity is easy to measure. But if technological advance leads to faster 
computers being built, then output and productivity have increased, but that 
increase is more subtle and harder to measure. Government statisticians try to 

C H A P T E R  9   Economic Growth II: Technology, Empirics, and Policy  | 275
correct for changes in quality, but despite their best efforts, the resulting data 
are far from perfect.
Unmeasured quality improvements mean that our standard of living is rising 
more rapidly than the official data indicate. This issue should make us suspicious 
of the data, but by itself it cannot explain the productivity slowdown. To explain 
a slowdown in growth, one must argue that the measurement problems got worse. 
There is some indication that this might be so. As history passes, fewer people 
work in industries with tangible and easily measured output, such as agriculture, 
and more work in industries with intangible and less easily measured output, 
such as medical services. Yet few economists believe that measurement problems 
were the full story.
Oil Prices When the productivity slowdown began around 1973, the obvious 
hypothesis to explain it was the large increase in oil prices caused by the actions 
of the OPEC oil cartel. The primary piece of evidence was the timing: produc­
tivity growth slowed at the same time that oil prices skyrocketed. Over time, 
however, this explanation has appeared less likely. One reason is that the accu­
mulated shortfall in productivity seems too large to be explained by an increase 
in oil prices; petroleum-based products are not that large a fraction of a typical 
firm’s costs. In addition, if this explanation were right, productivity should have 
sped up when political turmoil in OPEC caused oil prices to plummet in 1986. 
Unfortunately, that did not happen.
Worker Quality  Some economists suggest that the productivity slowdown 
might have been caused by changes in the labor force. In the early 1970s, the 
large baby-boom generation started leaving school and taking jobs. At the 
same time, changing social norms encouraged many women to leave full-time 
housework and enter the labor force. Both of these developments lowered the 
average level of experience among workers, which in turn lowered average 
productivity.
Other economists point to changes in worker quality as gauged by human 
capital. Although the educational attainment of the labor force continued to 
rise throughout this period, it was not increasing as rapidly as it had in the 
past. Moreover, declining performance on some standardized tests suggests 
that the quality of education was declining. If so, this could explain slowing 
productivity growth.
The Depletion of Ideas  Still other economists suggest that in the early 1970s 
the world started running out of new ideas about how to produce, pushing the 
economy into an age of slower technological progress. These economists often 
argue that the anomaly is not in the period since 1970 but in the preceding 
two decades. In the late 1940s, the economy had a large backlog of ideas that 
had not been fully implemented because of the Great Depression of the 1930s 
and World War II in the first half of the 1940s. After the economy used up this 
backlog, the argument goes, a slowdown in productivity growth was likely. 
Indeed, although the growth rates after 1972 were disappointing compared to 
those of the 1950s and 1960s, they were not lower than average growth rates 
from 1870 to 1950.

Growth in the East Asian Tigers
Among the most spectacular growth experiences in recent history have been 
those of the “Tigers” of East Asia: Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and 
Taiwan. From 1966 to 1990, while real income per person was growing about 
2 percent per year in the United States, it grew more than 7 percent per year 
in each of these countries. In the course of a single generation, real income per 
person increased fivefold, moving the Tigers from among the world’s poor­
est countries to among the richest. (In the late 1990s, a period of pronounced 
financial turmoil tarnished the reputations of some of these economies. But this 
short-run problem, which we examine in a Case Study in Chapter 13, doesn’t 
come close to reversing the spectacular long-run growth that the Asian Tigers 
have experienced.)
What accounts for these growth miracles? Some commentators have argued 
that the success of these four countries is hard to reconcile with basic growth 
theory, such as the Solow growth model, which takes technology as growing at a 
constant, exogenous rate. They have suggested that these countries’ rapid growth 
is explained by their ability to imitate foreign technologies. By adopting technol­
ogy developed abroad, the argument goes, these countries managed to improve 
their production functions substantially in a relatively short period of time. If this 
argument is correct, these countries should have experienced unusually rapid 
growth in total factor productivity.
One study shed light on this issue by examining in detail the data from these 
four countries. The study found that their exceptional growth can be traced to 
large increases in measured factor inputs: increases in labor-force participation, 
increases in the capital stock, and increases in educational attainment. In South 
Korea, for example, the investment–GDP ratio rose from about 5 percent in the 
1950s to about 30 percent in the 1980s; the percentage of the working popu­
lation with at least a high school education went from 26 percent in 1966 to 
75 percent in 1991.
Once we account for growth in labor, capital, and human capital, little of the 
growth in output is left to explain. None of these four countries experienced

As any good doctor will tell you, sometimes a patient’s illness goes away 
on its own, even if the doctor has failed to come up with a convincing 
diagnosis and remedy. This seems to be the outcome of the productivity 
slowdown. In the middle of the 1990s, productivity growth accelerated. Most 
observers attribute this acceleration to advances in computers and informa­

unusually rapid growth in total factor productivity. Indeed, the average growth 
in total factor productivity in the East Asian Tigers was almost exactly the same 
as in the United States. Thus, although these countries’ rapid growth was truly 
impressive, it is easy to explain using the tools of basic growth theory.20 n
The Solow Residual in the Short Run
When Robert Solow introduced his famous residual, his aim was to shed light on 
the forces that determine technological progress and economic growth in the long 
run. But economist Edward Prescott has looked at the Solow residual as a measure 
of technological change over shorter periods of time. He concludes that fluctua­
tions in technology are a major source of short-run changes in economic activity.
Figure 9-2 shows the Solow residual and the growth in output using 
annual data for the United States during the period 1960 to 2013. Notice

Growth in Output and the Solow Residual  The Solow residual, which some 
economists interpret as a measure of technology shocks, fluctuates with the econo­
my’s output of goods and services.

that the Solow residual fluctuates substantially. If Prescott’s interpretation is 
correct, then we can draw conclusions from these short-run fluctuations, 
such as that technology worsened in 1982 and improved in 1984. Notice 
also that the Solow residual moves closely with output: in years when output 
falls, technology tends to worsen. In Prescott’s view, this fact implies that 
recessions are driven by adverse shocks to technology. The hypothesis that 
technological shocks are the driving force behind short-run economic fluc­
tuations, and the complementary hypothesis that monetary policy has no 
role in explaining these fluctuations, is the foundation for an approach called 
real-business-cycle theory.
Prescott’s interpretation of these data is controversial, however. Many econ­
omists believe that the Solow residual does not accurately represent changes 
in technology over short periods of time. The standard explanation of the 
cyclical behavior of the Solow residual is that it results from two measurement 
problems.
First, during recessions, firms may continue to employ workers they do not 
need so that they will have these workers on hand when the economy recovers. 
This phenomenon, called labor hoarding, means that labor input is overestimated 
in recessions because the hoarded workers are probably not working as hard as 
usual. As a result, the Solow residual is more cyclical than the available production 
technology. In a recession, productivity as measured by the Solow residual falls 
even if technology has not changed simply because hoarded workers are sitting 
around waiting for the recession to end.
Second, when demand is low, firms may produce things that are not easily 
measured. In recessions, workers may clean the factory, organize the inven­
tory, get some training, and do other useful tasks that standard measures of 
output fail to include. If so, then output is underestimated in recessions, which 
would also make the measured Solow residual cyclical for reasons other than 
technology.
Thus, economists can interpret the cyclical behavior of the Solow residual 
in different ways. Some economists point to the low productivity in reces­
sions as evidence for adverse technology shocks. Others believe that mea­
sured productivity is low in recessions because workers are not working as 
hard as usual and because more of their output is not measured. Unfortu­
nately, there is no clear evidence on the importance of labor hoarding and 
the cyclical mismeasurement of output. Therefore, different interpretations 
of Figure 9-2 persist.21

Introduction to 
Economic Fluctuations
The modern world regards business cycles much as the ancient Egyptians 
regarded the overflowing of the Nile. The phenomenon recurs at intervals, it is 
of great importance to everyone, and natural causes of it are not in sight.
—John Bates Clark, 1898
E
conomic fluctuations present a recurring problem for economists and 
policymakers. On average, the real GDP of the United States grows about 
3 percent per year. But this long-run average hides the fact that the econ­
omy’s output of goods and services does not grow smoothly. Growth is higher in 
some years than in others; sometimes the economy loses ground, and growth turns 
negative. These fluctuations in the economy’s output are closely associated with 
fluctuations in employment. When the economy experiences a period of falling 
output and rising unemployment, the economy is said to be in recession.
A recent recession began in late 2007. From the third quarter of 2007 to 
the third quarter of 2008, the economy’s production of goods and services was 
approximately flat, in contrast to its normal growth. Real GDP then plunged 
sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. The unem­
ployment rate rose from 4.7 percent in November 2007 to 10.0 percent in 
October 2009. The recession officially ended in June 2009 when positive 
growth resumed, but the recovery was weak, and unemployment remained above 
7.0 percent for the next four years. Not surprisingly, the recession dominated 
the economic news, and addressing the problem was high on the policy agenda 
during President Barack Obama’s early years in office.
Economists call these short-run fluctuations in output and employment the 
business cycle. Although this term suggests that economic fluctuations are regular and 
predictable, they are not. Recessions are actually as irregular as they are common. 
Sometimes they occur close together, while at other times they are much farther 
apart. For example, the United States fell into a recession in 1982, only two years after 
the previous downturn. By the end of that year, the unemployment rate had reached 
10.8 percent—the highest level since the Great Depression of the 1930s. But after 
the 1982 recession, it was eight years before the economy experienced another one.

282 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
These historical events raise a variety of related questions: What causes short-
run fluctuations? What model should we use to explain them? Can policymakers 
avoid recessions? If so, what policy levers should they use?
In Parts Two and Three of this book, we developed theories to explain how 
the economy behaves in the long run. Here, in Part Four, we see how economists 
explain short-run fluctuations. We begin in this chapter with three tasks. First, 
we examine the data that describe short-run economic fluctuations. Second, we 
discuss the key differences between how the economy behaves in the long run 
and how it behaves in the short run. Third, we introduce the model of aggregate 
supply and aggregate demand, which most economists use to explain short-run 
fluctuations. Developing this model in more detail will be our primary job in 
the chapters that follow.
Just as Egypt now controls the flooding of the Nile Valley with the 
Aswan Dam, modern society tries to control the business cycle with appropriate 
economic policies. The model we develop over the next several chapters shows 
how monetary and fiscal policies influence the business cycle. We will see how 
these policies can potentially stabilize the economy or, if poorly conducted, make 
the problem of economic instability even worse.
 10-1	 The Facts About the Business Cycle
Before thinking about the theory of business cycles, let’s look at some of the facts 
that describe short-run fluctuations in economic activity.
GDP and Its Components
The economy’s gross domestic product measures total income and total expen­
diture in the economy. Because GDP is the broadest gauge of overall economic 
conditions, it is the natural place to start in analyzing 
the business cycle. Figure 10-1 shows the growth of 
real GDP from 1970 to 2014. The horizontal line 
shows the average growth rate of 3 percent per year 
over this period. You can see that economic growth 
is not at all steady and that, occasionally, it turns 
negative.
The shaded areas in the figure indicate periods 
of recession. The official arbiter of when recessions 
begin and end is the National Bureau of Economic 
Research (NBER), a nonprofit economic research 
group. The NBER’s Business Cycle Dating Com­
mittee (of which the author of this book was once 
a member) chooses the starting date of each reces­
sion, called the business cycle peak, and the ending 
date, called the business cycle trough.

C H A P T E R  1 0   Introduction to Economic Fluctuations  | 283
What determines whether a downturn in the economy is sufficiently severe 
to be deemed a recession? There is no simple answer. According to an old rule 
of thumb, a recession is a period of at least two consecutive quarters of declin­
ing real GDP. This rule, however, does not always hold. For example, the reces­
sion of 2001 had two quarters of negative growth, but those quarters were not 
consecutive. In fact, the NBER’s Business Cycle Dating Committee does not 
follow any fixed rule but, instead, looks at a variety of economic time series and 
uses its judgment when picking the starting and ending dates of recessions.1
Figure 10-2 shows the growth in two major components of GDP—
consumption in panel (a) and investment in panel (b). Growth in both of these 
variables declines during recessions. Take note, ­however, of the scales for the verti­
cal axes. Investment is far more volatile than consumption over the business cycle. 
When the economy heads into a recession, households respond to the fall in their 
incomes by consuming less, but the decline in spending on business equipment, 
structures, new housing, and inventories is even more substantial.

Unemployment and Okun’s Law
The business cycle is apparent not only in data from the national income accounts 
but also in data that describe conditions in the labor market. Figure 10-3 shows the 
unemployment rate from 1970 to 2014, again with the shaded areas representing 
periods of recession. You can see that unemployment rises in each recession. Other 

C H A P T E R  1 0   Introduction to Economic Fluctuations  | 285
labor-market measures tell a similar story. For example, job vacancies, as measured 
by the number of help-wanted ads that companies have posted, decline during 
recessions. Put simply, during an economic downturn, jobs are harder to find.
What relationship should we expect to find between unemployment and 
real GDP? Because employed workers help to produce goods and services and 
unemployed workers do not, increases in the unemployment rate should be 
associated with decreases in real GDP. This negative relationship between unem­
ployment and GDP is called Okun’s law, after Arthur Okun, the economist 
who first studied it.2
Figure 10-4 uses annual data for the United States to illustrate Okun’s law. In 
this scatterplot, each point represents the data for one year. The horizontal axis 
represents the change in the unemployment rate from the previous year, and the 
vertical axis represents the percentage change in GDP. This figure shows clearly 
that year-to-year changes in the unemployment rate are closely associated with 
year-to-year changes in real GDP.
We can be more precise about the magnitude of the Okun’s law relationship. 
The line drawn through the scatter of points tells us that

If the unemployment rate remains the same, real GDP grows by about 3 percent; 
this normal growth in the production of goods and services is due to growth in 
the labor force, capital accumulation, and technological progress. In addition, for 
every percentage point the unemployment rate rises, real GDP growth typically 
falls by 2 percent. Hence, if the unemployment rate rises from 5 to 7 percent, 
then real GDP growth would be

In this case, Okun’s law says that GDP would fall by 1 percent, indicating that 
the economy is in a recession.
Okun’s law is a reminder that the forces that govern the short-run business 
cycle are very different from those that shape long-run economic growth. As we 
saw in Chapters 8 and 9, long-run growth in GDP is determined primarily by 
technological progress. The long-run trend leading to higher standards of living 
from generation to generation is not associated with any long-run trend in the 
rate of unemployment. By contrast, short-run movements in GDP are highly

correlated with the utilization of the economy’s labor force. The declines in the 
production of goods and services that occur during recessions are always associ­
ated with increases in joblessness.
Leading Economic Indicators
Many economists, particularly those working in business and government, are 
engaged in the task of forecasting short-run fluctuations in the economy. Busi­
ness economists are interested in forecasting to help their companies plan for 
changes in the economic environment. Government economists are interested 
in forecasting for two reasons. First, the economic environment affects the gov­
ernment; for example, the state of the economy influences how much tax rev­
enue the government collects. Second, the government can affect the economy 
through its use of monetary and fiscal policy. Economic forecasts are, therefore, 
an input into policy planning.
One way that economists arrive at their forecasts is by looking at leading 
indicators, which are variables that tend to fluctuate in advance of the overall 
economy. Forecasts can differ in part because economists hold varying opinions 
about which leading indicators are most reliable.
Each month the Conference Board, a private economics research group, 
announces the index of leading economic indicators. This index includes ten data 
series that are often used to forecast changes in economic activity about six to 
nine months into the future. Here is a list of the series:
n	 Average weekly hours in manufacturing. Because businesses often adjust the 
work hours of existing employees before making new hires or laying 
off workers, average weekly hours is a leading indicator of employment 
changes. A longer workweek indicates that firms are asking their employees 
to work long hours because they are experiencing strong demand for their 
products; thus, it indicates that firms are likely to increase hiring and pro­
duction in the future. A shorter workweek indicates weak demand, suggest­
ing that firms are more likely to lay off workers and cut back production.
n	 Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance. The number of peo­
ple making new claims on the unemployment-insurance system is one of 
the most quickly available indicators of conditions in the labor market. 
This series is inverted in computing the index of leading indicators, so 
that an increase in the series lowers the index. An increase in the number 
of people making new claims for unemployment insurance indicates that 
firms are laying off workers and cutting back production; these layoffs and 
cutbacks will soon show up in data on employment and production.
n	 Manufacturers’ new orders for consumer goods and materials. This indicator 
is a direct measure of the demand for consumer goods that firms are 
experiencing. Because an increase in orders depletes a firm’s inventories, 
this statistic typically predicts subsequent increases in production and 
­employment.

288 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
n	 Manufacturers’ new orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft. This 
series is the counterpart to the previous one, but for investment goods 
rather than consumer goods. When firms experience increased orders, 
they ramp up production and employment. Aircraft orders are excluded 
because they are often placed so far in advance of production that these 
orders contain little information about near-term economic activity.
n	 ISM new orders index. This index, which comes from the Institute for 
Supply Management, is a third indicator of new orders. It is based on 
the number of companies reporting increased orders minus the num­
ber reporting decreased orders. Unlike the previous two indicators, this 
one measures the proportion of companies that report rising orders 
and thus shows whether a change is broadly based. When many firms 
experience increased orders, higher production and employment will 
likely soon follow.
n	 Building permits for new private housing units. Construction of new build­
ings is part of investment—a particularly volatile component of GDP. An 
increase in building permits means that planned construction is increas­
ing, which indicates a rise in overall economic activity.
n	 Index of stock prices. The stock market reflects expectations about future 
economic conditions because stock market investors bid up prices when 
they expect companies to be profitable. An increase in stock prices indi­
cates that investors expect the economy to grow rapidly; a decrease in 
stock prices indicates that investors expect an economic slowdown.
n	 Leading Credit Index. This component is itself a composite of six finan­
cial indicators, such as investor sentiment (based on a survey of stock-
market investors) and lending conditions (based on a survey of bank 
loan officers). When credit conditions are adverse, consumers and 
businesses find it harder to get the financing they need to make pur­
chases. Thus, deterioration of credit conditions predicts a decline in 
spending, production, and employment. This index was added to the 
leading indicators only recently. The financial crisis of 2008–2009 and 
the subsequent deep recession highlighted the importance of credit 
conditions for economic activity.
n	 Interest rate spread: the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds minus the federal funds 
rate. This spread, sometimes called the slope of the yield curve, reflects 
the market’s expectation about future interest rates, which in turn reflect 
the condition of the economy. A large spread means that interest rates are 
expected to rise, which typically occurs when economic activity increases.
n	 Average consumer expectations for business and economic conditions. This is a 
direct measure of expectations, based on two different surveys of house­
holds (one conducted by the University of Michigan and one conducted 
by the Conference Board). Increased optimism about future economic 
conditions among consumers suggests increased consumer demand for 
goods and services, which in turn will encourage businesses to expand 
production and employment to meet the demand.

C H A P T E R  1 0   Introduction to Economic Fluctuations  | 289
The index of leading indicators is far from a precise forecast of the future, as 
short-run economic fluctuations are largely unpredictable. Nonetheless, the 
index is a useful input into planning by both businesses and the government.
 10-2	 Time Horizons in Macroeconomics
Now that we have some sense about the facts that describe short-run economic 
fluctuations, we can turn to our basic task in this part of the book: building a 
theory to explain these fluctuations. That job, it turns out, is not a simple one. 
It will take us not only the rest of this chapter but also the next four chapters to 
develop the model of short-run fluctuations in its entirety.
Before we start building the model, however, let’s step back and ask a funda­
mental question: Why do economists need different models for different time 
horizons? Why can’t we stop the course here and be content with the classical 
models developed in Chapters 3 through 9? The answer, as this book has consis­
tently reminded its reader, is that classical macroeconomic theory applies to the 
long run but not to the short run. But why is this so?
How the Short Run and the Long Run Differ
Most macroeconomists believe that the key difference between the short run 
and the long run is the behavior of prices. In the long run, prices are flexible and 
can respond to changes in supply or demand. In the short run, many prices are “sticky” at 
some predetermined level. Because prices behave differently in the short run than 
in the long run, various economic events and policies have different effects over 
different time horizons.
To see how the short run and the long run differ, consider the effects of a 
change in monetary policy. Suppose that the Federal Reserve suddenly reduces 
the money supply by 5 percent. According to the classical model, the money 
supply affects nominal variables—variables measured in terms of money—but 
not real variables. As you may recall from Chapter 5, the theoretical separa­
tion of real and nominal variables is called the classical dichotomy, and the 
irrelevance of the money supply for the determination of real variables is 
called monetary neutrality. Most economists believe that these classical ideas 
describe how the economy works in the long run: a 5 percent reduction in 
the money supply lowers all prices (including nominal wages) by 5 percent, 
while output, employment, and other real variables remain the same. Thus, in 
the long run, changes in the money supply do not cause fluctuations in output 
and employment.
In the short run, however, many prices do not respond to changes in mon­
etary policy. A reduction in the money supply does not immediately cause all 
firms to cut the wages they pay, all stores to change the price tags on their 
goods, all mail-order firms to issue new catalogs, and all restaurants to print 
new menus. Instead, there is little immediate change in many prices; that is, 

290 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
many prices are sticky. This short-run price stickiness implies that the short-run 
impact of a change in the money supply is not the same as the long-run impact.
A model of economic fluctuations must take into account this short-run 
price stickiness. We will see that the failure of prices to adjust quickly and 
completely to changes in the money supply (as well as to other exogenous 
changes in economic conditions) means that, in the short run, real variables 
such as output and employment must do some of the adjusting instead. 
In other words, during the time horizon over which prices are sticky, the 
classical dichotomy no longer holds: nominal variables can influence real 
variables, and the economy can deviate from the equilibrium predicted by 
the classical model.
If You Want to Know Why Firms Have Sticky 
Prices, Ask Them
How sticky are prices, and why are they sticky? In an intriguing study, economist 
Alan Blinder attacked these questions directly by surveying firms about their 
price-adjustment decisions.
Blinder began by asking firm managers how often they changed prices. 
The answers, summarized in Table 10-1, yielded two conclusions. First, sticky 
prices are common. The typical firm in the economy adjusts its prices once or 
twice a year. Second, there are large differences among firms in the frequency of 
price adjustment. About 10 percent of firms changed prices more often than once 
a week, and about the same number changed prices less often than once a year.

Blinder then asked the firm managers why they didn’t change prices more 
often. In particular, he explained to the managers several economic theories of 
sticky prices and asked them to judge how well each of these theories described 
their firms. Table 10-2 summarizes the theories and ranks them by the percentage 
of managers who accepted the theory as an accurate description of their firms’ 
pricing decisions. Notice that each of the theories was endorsed by some of the 
managers, but each was rejected by a large number as well. One interpretation is 
that different theories apply to different firms, depending on industry character­
istics, and that price stickiness is a macroeconomic phenomenon without a single 
microeconomic explanation.

The Model of Aggregate Supply and 
Aggregate Demand
How does the introduction of sticky prices change our view of how the econo­
my works? We can answer this question by considering economists’ two favorite 
words—supply and demand.
In classical macroeconomic theory, the amount of output depends on the 
economy’s ability to supply goods and services, which in turn depends on the 
supplies of capital and labor and on the available production technology. This 
is the essence of the basic classical model in Chapter 3, as well as of the Solow 
growth model in Chapters 8 and 9. Flexible prices are a crucial assumption of 
classical theory. The theory posits, sometimes implicitly, that prices adjust to 
ensure that the quantity of output demanded equals the quantity supplied.
The economy works quite differently when prices are sticky. In this case, as 
we will see, output also depends on the economy’s demand for goods and ser­
vices. Demand, in turn, depends on a variety of factors: consumers’ confidence 
about their economic prospects, firms’ perceptions about the profitability of new 
investments, and monetary and fiscal policy. Because monetary and fiscal policy 
can influence demand, and demand in turn can influence the economy’s output 
over the time horizon when prices are sticky, price stickiness provides a rationale 
for why these policies may be useful in stabilizing the economy in the short run.
In the rest of this chapter, we begin developing a model that makes these 
ideas more precise. The place to start is the model of supply and demand, which 
we used in Chapter 1 to discuss the market for pizza. This basic model offers 
some of the most fundamental insights in economics. It shows how the supply 
and demand for any good jointly determine the good’s price and the quantity 
sold, as well as how shifts in supply and demand affect the price and quantity. We 
now introduce the “economy-size” version of this model—the model of aggregate 
Among the dozen theories, coordination failure tops the list. According to 
Blinder, this is an important finding because it suggests that the inability of firms 
to coordinate price changes plays a key role in explaining price stickiness and, 
thus, short-run economic fluctuations. He writes, “The most obvious policy 
implication of the model is that more coordinated wage and price setting—
somehow achieved—could improve welfare. But if this proves difficult or impos­
sible, the door is opened to activist monetary policy to cure recessions.”3 n

117–154. For more recent evidence about the frequency of price adjustment, see Emi Nakamura 
and Jón Steinsson, “Five Facts About Prices: A Reevaluation of Menu Cost Models,” Quarterly 
Journal of Economics, 123, no. 4 (November 2008): 1415–1464. Nakamura and Steinsson examine 
the microeconomic data that underlie the consumer and producer price indexes. They report that, 
including temporary sales, 19 to 20 percent of prices change every month. If sales are excluded, 
however, the frequency of price adjustment falls to about 9 to 12 percent per month. This latter 
finding is broadly consistent with Blinder’s conclusion that the typical firm adjusts its prices about 
once a year.

supply and aggregate demand. This macroeconomic model allows us to study how 
the aggregate price level and the quantity of aggregate output are determined 
in the short run. It also provides a way to contrast how the economy behaves in 
the long run and how it behaves in the short run.
Although the model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand resembles the 
model of supply and demand for a single good, the analogy is not exact. The model 
of supply and demand for a single good considers only one good within a large 
economy. By contrast, as we will see in the coming chapters, the model of aggre­
gate supply and aggregate demand is a sophisticated model that incorporates the 
interactions among many markets. In the remainder of this chapter we get a first 
glimpse at those interactions by examining the model in its most simplified form. 
Our goal here is not to explain the model fully but, instead, to introduce its key 
elements and illustrate how it can help explain short-run economic fluctuations.
 10-3	 Aggregate Demand
Aggregate demand (AD) is the relationship between the quantity of output 
demanded and the aggregate price level. In other words, the aggregate demand 
curve tells us the quantity of goods and services people want to buy at any given 
level of prices. We examine the theory of aggregate demand in detail in Chapters 
11 through 13. Here we use the quantity theory of money to provide a simple, 
although incomplete, derivation of the aggregate demand curve.
The Quantity Equation as Aggregate Demand
Recall from Chapter 5 that the quantity theory says that
MV 5 PY,
where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and 
Y is the amount of output. If the velocity of money is constant, then this equa­
tion states that the money supply determines the nominal value of output, which 
in turn is the product of the price level and the amount of output.
When interpreting this equation, it is useful to recall that the quantity equa­
tion can be rewritten in terms of the supply and demand for real money balances:
M/P 5 (M/P )d 5 kY,
where k 5 1/V is a parameter representing how much money people want to 
hold for every dollar of income. In this form, the quantity equation states that 
the supply of real money balances M/P equals the demand for real money bal­
ances (M/P )d and that the demand is proportional to output Y. The velocity of 
money V is the flip side of the money demand parameter k. The assumption of 
constant velocity is equivalent to the assumption of a constant demand for real 
money balances per unit of output.

FIGURE  10-5
The Aggregate Demand 
Curve  The aggregate demand 
curve AD shows the relation­
ship between the price level 
P and the quantity of goods 
and services demanded Y. It is 
drawn for a given value of the 
money supply M. The aggregate 
demand curve slopes down­
ward: the higher the price level 
P, the lower the level of real 
balances M/P, and therefore 
the lower the quantity of goods 
and services demanded Y.
Price level, P

If we assume that velocity V is constant and the money supply M is fixed 
by the central bank, then the quantity equation yields a negative relationship 
between the price level P and output Y. Figure 10-5 graphs the combinations 
of P and Y that satisfy the quantity equation holding M and V constant. This 
downward-sloping curve is called the aggregate demand curve.
Why the Aggregate Demand Curve Slopes Downward
As a strictly mathematical matter, the quantity equation explains the downward 
slope of the aggregate demand curve very simply. The money supply M and the 
velocity of money V determine the nominal value of output PY. Once PY is 
fixed, if P goes up, Y must go down.
What is the economic intuition that lies behind this mathematical relation­
ship? For a complete explanation of the downward slope of the aggregate 
demand curve, we have to wait for a couple of chapters. For now, however, 
consider the following logic: because we have assumed the velocity of money 
is fixed, the money supply determines the dollar value of all transactions in the 
economy. (This conclusion should be familiar from Chapter 5.) If the price level 
rises, each transaction requires more dollars, so the number of transactions and 
thus the quantity of goods and services purchased must fall.
We can also explain the downward slope of the aggregate demand curve by 
thinking about the supply and demand for real money balances. If output is 
higher, people engage in more transactions and need higher real balances M/P. 
For a fixed money supply M, higher real balances imply a lower price level. 
Conversely, if the price level is lower, real money balances are higher; the higher 
level of real balances allows a greater volume of transactions, which means a 
greater quantity of output is demanded.

C H A P T E R  1 0   Introduction to Economic Fluctuations  | 295
Shifts in the Aggregate Demand Curve
The aggregate demand curve is drawn for a fixed value of the money supply. 
In other words, it tells us the possible combinations of P and Y for a given value 
of M. If the Fed changes the money supply, then the possible combinations of P 
and Y change, which means the aggregate demand curve shifts.
For example, consider what happens if the Fed reduces the money supply. The 
quantity equation, MV 5 PY, tells us that the reduction in the money supply 
leads to a proportionate reduction in the nominal value of output PY. For any 
given price level, the amount of output is lower, and for any given amount of 
output, the price level is lower. As in Figure 10-6 panel (a), the aggregate demand 
curve relating P and Y shifts inward.
The opposite occurs if the Fed increases the money supply. The quantity 
equation tells us that an increase in M leads to an increase in PY. For any given 
price level, the amount of output is higher, and for any given amount of out­
put, the price level is higher. As shown in Figure 10-6 panel (b), the aggregate 
demand curve shifts outward.
Although the quantity theory of money provides a very simple basis for 
understanding the aggregate demand curve, be forewarned that reality is more 
complicated. Fluctuations in the money supply are not the only source of fluc­
tuations in aggregate demand. Even if the money supply is held constant, the 
aggregate demand curve shifts if some event causes a change in the velocity 
of money. Over the next two chapters, we develop a more general model of 
aggregate demand, called the IS–LM model, which will allow us to consider many 
possible reasons for shifts in the aggregate demand curve.
FIGURE  10-6
Shifts in the Aggregate Demand Curve  Changes in the money supply shift the aggregate 
demand curve. In panel (a), a decrease in the money supply M reduces the nominal value of out­
put PY. For any given price level P, output Y is lower. Thus, a decrease in the money supply shifts 
the aggregate demand curve inward from AD1 to AD2. In panel (b), an increase in the money sup­
ply M raises the nominal value of output PY. For any given price level P, output Y is higher. Thus, 
an increase in the money supply shifts the aggregate demand curve outward from AD1 to AD2.

 10-4	 Aggregate Supply
By itself, the aggregate demand curve does not tell us the price level or the 
amount of output that will prevail in the economy; it merely gives a relationship 
between these two variables. To accompany the aggregate demand curve, we 
need another relationship between P and Y that crosses the aggregate demand 
curve—an aggregate supply curve. The aggregate demand and aggregate supply 
curves together pin down the economy’s price level and quantity of output.
Aggregate supply (AS) is the relationship between the quantity of goods 
and services supplied and the price level. Because the firms that supply goods and 
services have flexible prices in the long run but sticky prices in the short run, 
the aggregate supply relationship depends on the time horizon. We need to dis­
cuss two different aggregate supply curves: the long-run aggregate supply curve 
LRAS and the short-run aggregate supply curve SRAS. We also need to discuss 
how the economy makes the transition from the short run to the long run.
The Long Run: The Vertical Aggregate Supply Curve
Because the classical model describes how the economy behaves in the long run, 
we derive the long-run aggregate supply curve from the classical model. Recall 
from Chapter 3 that the amount of output produced depends on the fixed amounts 
of capital and labor and on the available technology. To show this, we write
Y 5 F(K–, L–)
5 Y–.
According to the classical model, output does not depend on the price level. To show 
that output is fixed at this level, regardless of the price level, we draw a vertical aggre­
gate supply curve, as in Figure 10-7. In the long run, the intersection of the aggregate 
demand curve with this vertical aggregate supply curve determines the price level.
If the aggregate supply curve is vertical, then changes in aggregate demand 
affect prices but not output. For example, if the money supply falls, the aggregate 
demand curve shifts downward, as in Figure 10-8. The economy moves from the 
old intersection of aggregate supply and aggregate demand, point A, to the new 
intersection, point B. The shift in aggregate demand affects only prices.
The vertical aggregate supply curve satisfies the classical dichotomy because it 
implies that the level of output is independent of the money supply. This long-
run level of output, Y–, is called the full-employment, or natural, level of output. It 
is the level of output at which the economy’s resources are fully employed or, 
more realistically, at which unemployment is at its natural rate.
The Short Run: The Horizontal Aggregate Supply Curve
The classical model and the vertical aggregate supply curve apply only in the 
long run. In the short run, some prices are sticky and therefore do not adjust 
to changes in demand. Because of this price stickiness, the short-run aggregate 
supply curve is not vertical.

In this chapter, we will simplify things by assuming an extreme example. Suppose 
that all firms have issued price catalogs and that it is too costly for them to issue 
new ones. Thus, all prices are stuck at predetermined levels. At these prices, firms 
are willing to sell as much as their customers are willing to buy, and they hire just 
enough labor to produce the amount demanded. Because the price level is fixed, 
we represent this situation in Figure 10-9 with a horizontal aggregate supply curve.
The short-run equilibrium of the economy is the intersection of the aggregate 
demand curve and this horizontal short-run aggregate supply curve. In this case, 
changes in aggregate demand do affect the level of output. For example, if the Fed

suddenly reduces the money supply, the aggregate demand curve shifts inward, as in 
Figure 10-10. The economy moves from the old intersection of aggregate demand 
and aggregate supply, point A, to the new intersection, point B. The movement 
from point A to point B represents a decline in output at a fixed price level.
Thus, a fall in aggregate demand reduces output in the short run because 
prices do not adjust instantly. After the sudden fall in aggregate demand, firms 
are stuck with prices that are too high. With demand low and prices high, firms 
sell less of their product, so they reduce production and lay off workers. The 
economy experiences a recession.
Once again, be forewarned that reality is a bit more complicated than illus­
trated here. Although many prices are sticky in the short run, some prices are

able to respond quickly to changing circumstances. As we will see in Chapter 14, 
in an economy with some sticky prices and some flexible prices, the short-run 
aggregate supply curve is upward sloping rather than horizontal. Figure 10-10 
illustrates the extreme case in which all prices are stuck. Because this case is 
simpler, it is a useful starting point for thinking about short-run aggregate supply.
From the Short Run to the Long Run
We can summarize our analysis so far as follows: Over long periods of time, prices are 
flexible, the aggregate supply curve is vertical, and changes in aggregate demand affect the price 
level but not output. Over short periods of time, prices are sticky, the aggregate supply curve 
is flat, and changes in aggregate demand do affect the economy’s output of goods and services.
How does the economy make the transition from the short run to the long run? 
Let’s trace the effects over time of a fall in aggregate demand. Suppose that the econ­
omy is initially in long-run equilibrium, as shown in Figure 10-11. In this figure, 
there are three curves: the aggregate demand curve, the long-run aggregate supply 
curve, and the short-run aggregate supply curve. The long-run equilibrium is the 
point at which aggregate demand crosses the long-run aggregate supply curve. Prices 
have adjusted to reach this equilibrium. Therefore, when the economy is in its long-
run equilibrium, the short-run aggregate supply curve must cross this point as well.
Now suppose that the Fed reduces the money supply and the aggregate demand 
curve shifts downward, as in Figure 10-12. In the short run, prices are sticky, so the 
economy moves from point A to point B. Output and employment fall below their 
natural levels, which means the economy is in a recession. Over time, in response 
to the low demand, wages and prices fall. The gradual reduction in the price level 
moves the economy downward along the aggregate demand curve to point C, 
which is the new long-run equilibrium. In the new long-run equilibrium (point C), 
output and employment are back to their natural levels, but prices are lower than 
in the old long-run equilibrium (point A). Thus, a shift in aggregate demand affects 
output in the short run, but this effect dissipates over time as firms adjust their prices.

itself at the intersection of the

A Monetary Lesson From French History
Finding modern examples to illustrate the lessons from Figure 10-12 is hard. 
Modern central banks are too smart to engineer a substantial reduction in the 
money supply for no good reason. They know that a recession would ensue, and 
they usually do their best to prevent that from happening. Fortunately, history often 
fills in the gap when recent experience fails to produce the right experiment.
A vivid example of the effects of monetary contraction occurred in eighteenth-
century France. In 2009, François Velde, an economist at the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Chicago, studied this episode in French economic history.
The story begins with the unusual nature of French money at the time. The 
money stock in this economy included a variety of gold and silver coins that, in 
contrast to modern money, did not indicate a specific monetary value. Instead, 
the monetary value of each coin was set by government decree, and the gov­
ernment could easily change the monetary value and thus the money supply. 
Sometimes this would occur literally overnight. It is almost as if, while you were 
sleeping, every $1 bill in your wallet was replaced by a bill worth only 80 cents.
Indeed, that is what happened on September 22, 1724. Every person in France 
woke up with 20 percent less money than he or she had the night before. Over 
the course of seven months, the nominal value of the money stock was reduced 
by about 45 percent. The goal of these changes was to reduce prices in the 
economy to what the government considered an appropriate level.
What happened as a result of this policy? Velde reports the following 
consequences:
Although prices and wages did fall, they did not do so by the full 45 percent; 
moreover, it took them months, if not years, to fall that far. Real wages in 
fact rose, at least initially. Interest rates rose. The only market that adjusted

instantaneously and fully was the foreign exchange market. Even markets that 
were as close to fully competitive as one can imagine, such as grain markets, 
failed to react initially. . . .
At the same time, the industrial sector of the economy (or at any rate the 
textile industry) went into a severe contraction, by about 30 percent. The onset 
of the recession may have occurred before the deflationary policy began, but it 
was widely believed at the time that the severity of the contraction was due to 
monetary policy, in particular to a resulting “credit crunch” as holders of money 
stopped providing credit to trade in anticipation of further price declines (the 
“scarcity of money” frequently blamed by observers). Likewise, it was widely 
believed (on the basis of past experience) that a policy of inflation would halt 
the recession, and coincidentally or not, the economy rebounded once the

As noted in Chapter 5, many of the central ideas 
of monetary theory have a long history. The clas­
sical theory of money we discussed in that chap­
ter dates back as far as the eighteenth-century 
philosopher and economist David Hume. While 
Hume understood that changes in the money 
supply ultimately led to inflation, he also knew 
that money had real effects in the short run. Here 
is how Hume described a monetary injection in 
his 1752 essay Of Money:
To account, then, for this phenomenon, we must 
consider, that though the high price of commodities 
be a necessary consequence of the increase of gold 
and silver, yet it follows not immediately upon that 
increase; but some time is required before the money 
circulates through the whole state, and makes its 
effect be felt on all ranks of people. At first, no 
alteration is perceived; by degrees the price rises, first 
of one commodity, then of another; till the whole at 
last reaches a just proportion with the new quantity 
of specie which is in the kingdom. In my opinion, 
it is only in this interval or intermediate situation, 
between the acquisition of money and rise of prices, 
that the increasing quantity of gold and silver is 
favorable to industry. When any quantity of money 
is imported into a nation, it is not at first dispersed 
into many hands; but is confined to the coffers of a

few persons, who immediately seek to employ it to 
advantage. Here are a set of manufacturers or mer­
chants, we shall suppose, who have received returns 
of gold and silver for goods which they sent to Cadiz. 
They are thereby enabled to employ more work­
men than formerly, who never dream of demanding 
higher wages, but are glad of employment from such 
good paymasters. If workmen become scarce, the 
manufacturer gives higher wages, but at first requires 
an increase of labor; and this is willingly submitted 
to by the artisan, who can now eat and drink better, 
to compensate his additional toil and fatigue. He 
carries his money to market, where he finds every­
thing at the same price as formerly, but returns with 
greater quantity and of better kinds, for the use of 
his family. The farmer and gardener, finding that all 
their commodities are taken off, apply themselves 
with alacrity to the raising more; and at the same 
time can afford to take better and more cloths from 
their tradesmen, whose price is the same as formerly, 
and their industry only whetted by so much new 
gain. It is easy to trace the money in its progress 
through the whole commonwealth; where we shall 
find, that it must first quicken the diligence of every 
individual, before it increases the price of labor.
Though written more than two centuries ago, these 
words reflect well the modern understanding of the 
short-run effects of changes in the money supply.

 10-5	 Stabilization Policy
Fluctuations in the economy as a whole come from changes in aggregate sup­
ply or aggregate demand. Economists call exogenous events that shift these 
curves shocks to the economy. A shock that shifts the aggregate demand curve 
is called a demand shock, and a shock that shifts the aggregate supply curve 
is called a supply shock. These shocks disrupt the economy by pushing out­
put and employment away from their natural levels. One goal of the model of 
aggregate supply and aggregate demand is to show how shocks cause economic 
­fluctuations.
Another goal of the model is to evaluate how macroeconomic policy can 
respond to these shocks. Economists use the term stabilization policy to refer 
to policy actions aimed at reducing the severity of short-run economic fluctua­
tions. Because output and employment fluctuate around their long-run natural 
levels, stabilization policy dampens the business cycle by keeping output and 
employment as close to their natural levels as possible.
In the coming chapters, we examine in detail how stabilization policy works 
and what practical problems arise in its use. Here we begin our analysis of stabili­
zation policy using our simplified version of the model of aggregate demand and 
aggregate supply. In particular, we examine how monetary policy might respond 
to shocks. Monetary policy is an important component of stabilization policy 
because, as we have seen, the money supply has a powerful impact on aggregate 
demand.
Shocks to Aggregate Demand
Consider an example of a demand shock: the introduction and expanded avail­
ability of credit cards. Because credit cards are often a more convenient way to 
make purchases than using cash, they reduce the quantity of money that people 
choose to hold. This reduction in money demand is equivalent to an increase in 
the velocity of money. When each person holds less money, the money demand 
parameter k falls. This means that each dollar of money moves from hand to hand 
more quickly, so velocity V (5 1/k) rises.
If the money supply is held constant, the increase in velocity causes nomi­
nal spending to rise and the aggregate demand curve to shift outward, as in 
Figure 10-13. In the short run, the increase in demand raises the output of the 
economy—it causes an economic boom. At the old prices, firms now sell more 
output. Therefore, they hire more workers, ask their existing workers to work 
longer hours, and make greater use of their factories and equipment.
Over time, the high level of aggregate demand pulls up wages and prices. As 
the price level rises, the quantity of output demanded declines, and the economy 
gradually approaches the natural level of production. But during the transition 
to the higher price level, the economy’s output is higher than its natural level.
What can the Fed do to dampen this boom and keep output closer to the 
natural level? The Fed might reduce the money supply to offset the increase in 
velocity. Offsetting the change in velocity would stabilize aggregate demand. 

C H A P T E R  1 0   Introduction to Economic Fluctuations  | 303
Thus, the Fed can reduce or even eliminate the impact of demand shocks on 
output and employment if it can skillfully control the money supply. Whether 
the Fed in fact has the necessary skill is a more difficult question, which we take 
up in Chapter 18.
Shocks to Aggregate Supply
Shocks to aggregate supply can also cause economic fluctuations. A supply shock 
is a shock to the economy that alters the cost of producing goods and services 
and, as a result, the prices that firms charge. Because supply shocks have a direct 
impact on the price level, they are sometimes called price shocks. Here are some 
examples:
n	 A drought that destroys crops. The reduction in food supply pushes up 
food prices.
n	 A new environmental protection law that requires firms to reduce their 
emissions of pollutants. Firms pass on the added costs to customers in the 
form of higher prices.
n	 An increase in union aggressiveness. This pushes up wages and the prices 
of the goods produced by union workers.
n	 The organization of an international oil cartel. By curtailing competition, 
the major oil producers can raise the world price of oil.
All these events are adverse supply shocks, which means they push costs and 
prices upward. A favorable supply shock, such as the breakup of an international 
oil cartel, reduces costs and prices.

Figure 10-14 shows how an adverse supply shock affects the economy. 
The short-run aggregate supply curve shifts upward. (The supply shock may 
also lower the natural level of output and thus shift the long-run aggregate 
supply curve to the left, but we ignore that effect here.) If aggregate demand 
is held constant, the economy moves from point A to point B: the price level 
rises and the amount of output falls below its natural level. An experience 
like this is called stagflation because it combines economic stagnation (falling 
output and, from Okun’s law, rising unemployment) with inflation (rising 
prices).
Faced with an adverse supply shock, a policymaker with the ability to 
influence aggregate demand, such as the Fed, has a difficult choice between 
two options. The first option, implicit in Figure 10-14, is to hold aggregate 
demand constant. In this case, output and employment are lower than the 
natural level. Eventually, prices will fall to restore full employment at the 
old price level (point A), but the cost of this adjustment process is a painful 
recession.
The second option, illustrated in Figure 10-15, is to expand aggregate 
demand to bring the economy toward the natural level of output more 
quickly. If the increase in aggregate demand coincides with the shock to 
aggregate supply, the economy goes immediately from point A to point C. 
In this case, the Fed is said to accommodate the supply shock. The drawback 
of this option, of course, is that the price level is permanently higher. There 
is no way to adjust aggregate demand to maintain full employment and keep 
the price level stable.

How OPEC Helped Cause Stagflation in the 1970s 
and Euphoria in the 1980s
The most disruptive supply shocks in recent history were caused by OPEC, the 
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC is a cartel, which 
is an organization of suppliers that coordinate production levels and prices. In 
the early 1970s, OPEC’s reduction in the supply of oil nearly doubled the world 
price. This increase in oil prices caused stagflation in most industrial countries. 
These statistics show what happened in the United States:

The 68 percent increase in the price of oil in 1974 was an adverse supply shock 
of major proportions. As we would expect, this shock led to both higher inflation 
and higher unemployment.

A few years later, when the world economy had nearly recovered from

The increases in oil prices in 1979, 1980, and 1981 again led to double-digit 
inflation and higher unemployment.
In the mid-1980s, political turmoil among the Arab countries weakened 
OPEC’s ability to restrain supplies of oil. Oil prices fell, reversing the stagflation 
of the 1970s and the early 1980s. Here’s what happened:
In 1986 oil prices fell by nearly half. This favorable supply shock led to 
one of the lowest inflation rates experienced during that era and to falling 
unemployment.
More recently, OPEC has not been a major cause of economic fluctuations. 
Conservation efforts and technological changes have made the U.S. economy 
less susceptible to oil shocks. The economy today is more service-based and less 
manufacturing-based, and services typically require less energy to produce than 
do manufactured goods. Because the amount of oil consumed per unit of real 
GDP has fallen by more than half over the previous three decades, it takes a much 
larger oil-price change to have the impact on the economy that we observed in

 10-6	 Conclusion
This chapter introduced a framework to study economic fluctuations: the model 
of aggregate supply and aggregate demand. The model is built on the assump­
tion that prices are sticky in the short run and flexible in the long run. It shows 
how shocks to the economy cause output to deviate temporarily from the level 
implied by the classical model.
The model also highlights the role of monetary policy. On the one hand, poor 
monetary policy can be a source of destabilizing shocks to the economy. On the 
other hand, a well-run monetary policy can respond to shocks and stabilize the 
economy.
In the chapters that follow, we refine our understanding of this model and our 
analysis of stabilization policy. Chapters 11 through 13 go beyond the quantity 
equation to refine our theory of aggregate demand. Chapter 14 examines aggre­
gate supply in more detail. The remainder of the book then uses this model as 
the platform from which to dive into more advanced topics in macroeconomic 
theory and policy.
Summary
	1.	Economies experience short-run fluctuations in economic activity, mea­
sured most broadly by real GDP. These fluctuations are associated with 
movement in many macroeconomic variables. In particular, when GDP 
growth declines, consumption growth falls (typically by a smaller amount), 
investment growth falls (typically by a larger amount), and unemployment 
rises. Although economists look at various leading indicators to forecast 
movements in the economy, these short-run fluctuations are largely 
unpredictable.
	2.	The crucial difference between how the economy works in the long run 
and how it works in the short run is that prices are flexible in the long run 
but sticky in the short run. The model of aggregate supply and aggregate 
demand provides a framework to analyze economic fluctuations and see 
how the impact of policies and events varies over different time horizons.
5Some economists have suggested that changes in oil prices played a major role in economic fluc­
tuations even before the 1970s. See James D. Hamilton, “Oil and the Macroeconomy Since World 
War II,” Journal of Political Economy 91 (April 1983): 228–248.
the 1970s and 1980s. Thus, when oil prices fluctuate substantially, as they have 
in recent years, these price changes have a smaller macroeconomic impact than 
they would have had in the past.5 n

and then a change in government regulations

	3.	The aggregate demand curve slopes downward. It tells us that the lower the 
price level, the greater the aggregate quantity of goods and services demanded.
	4.	In the long run, the aggregate supply curve is vertical because output 
is determined by the amounts of capital and labor and by the available 
technology but not by the level of prices. Therefore, shifts in aggregate 
demand affect the price level but not output or employment.
	5.	In the short run, the aggregate supply curve is horizontal, because wages 
and prices are sticky at predetermined levels. Therefore, shifts in aggregate 
demand affect output and employment.
	6.	Shocks to aggregate demand and aggregate supply cause economic fluctuations. 
Because the Fed can shift the aggregate demand curve, it can attempt to offset 
these shocks to maintain output and employment at their natural levels.

Aggregate Demand I: Building the 
IS–LM Model
I shall argue that the postulates of the classical theory are applicable to a spe­
cial case only and not to the general case. . . . Moreover, the characteristics of 
the special case assumed by the classical theory happen not to be those of the 
economic society in which we actually live, with the result that its teaching is 
misleading and disastrous if we attempt to apply it to the facts of experience.
—John Maynard Keynes, The General Theory
O
f all the economic fluctuations in world history, the one that stands 
out as particularly large, painful, and intellectually significant is the 
Great Depression of the 1930s. During this time, the United States 
and many other countries experienced massive unemployment and greatly 
reduced incomes. In the worst year, 1933, one-fourth of the U.S. labor force was 
unemployed, and real GDP was 30 percent below its 1929 level.
This devastating episode caused many economists to question the validity of 
classical economic theory—the theory we examined in Chapters 3 through 7. 
Classical theory seemed incapable of explaining the Depression. According 
to that theory, national income depends on factor supplies and the available 
technology, neither of which changed substantially from 1929 to 1933. After 
the onset of the Depression, many economists believed that a new model was 
needed to explain such a large and sudden economic downturn and to sug­
gest government policies that might reduce the economic hardship so many 
people faced.
In 1936 the British economist John Maynard Keynes revolutionized econom­
ics with his book The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money. Keynes 
proposed a new way to analyze the economy, which he presented as an alterna­
tive to classical theory. His vision of how the economy works quickly became 
a center of controversy. Yet, as economists debated The General Theory, a new 
understanding of economic fluctuations gradually developed.
Keynes proposed that low aggregate demand is responsible for the low income 
and high unemployment that characterize economic downturns. He criticized 
11
C H A P T E R

312 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
classical theory for assuming that aggregate supply alone—capital, labor, and 
technology—determines national income. Economists today reconcile these two 
views with the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply introduced in 
Chapter 10. In the long run, prices are flexible, and aggregate supply determines 
income. But in the short run, prices are sticky, so changes in aggregate demand 
influence income.
Keynes’s ideas about short-run fluctuations have been prominent since he 
proposed them in the 1930s, but they have commanded renewed attention in 
recent years. In the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008–2009, the United 
States and Europe descended into a deep recession, followed by a weak recovery. 
As unemployment lingered at high levels, policymakers around the world 
debated how best to increase aggregate demand. Many of the issues that gripped 
economists during the Great Depression were once again at the center of the 
economic policy debate.
In this chapter and the next, we continue our study of economic ­fluctuations 
by looking more closely at aggregate demand. Our goal is to identify the ­variables 
that shift the aggregate demand curve, causing fluctuations in national income. We 
also examine more fully the tools policymakers can use to influence aggregate 
demand. In Chapter 10, we derived the aggregate demand curve from the quan­
tity theory of money, and we showed that monetary policy can shift the aggregate 
demand curve. In this chapter, we see that the government can influence aggre­
gate demand with both monetary and fiscal policy.
The model of aggregate demand developed in this chapter, called the IS–LM 
model, is the leading interpretation of Keynes’s theory. The goal of the model 
is to show what determines national income for a given price level. There are 
two ways to interpret this exercise. We can view the IS–LM model as showing 
what causes income to change in the short run when the price level is fixed 
because all prices are sticky. Or we can view the model as showing what causes 
the aggregate demand curve to shift. These two interpretations of the model are 
equivalent: As Figure 11-1 shows, in the short run when the price level is fixed, 
shifts in the aggregate demand curve lead to changes in the equilibrium level of 
national income.
The two parts of the IS–LM model are, not surprisingly, the IS curve and the 
LM curve. IS stands for “investment” and “saving,” and the IS curve represents 
what’s going on in the market for goods and services (which we first discussed in 
Chapter 3). LM stands for “liquidity” and “money,” and the LM curve represents 
what’s happening to the supply and demand for money (which we first discussed 
in Chapter 5). Because the interest rate influences both investment and money 
demand, it is the variable that links the two halves of the IS–LM model. The 
model shows how interactions between the goods and money markets determine 
the position and slope of the aggregate demand curve and, therefore, the level of 
national income in the short run.1
1The IS–LM model was introduced in a classic article by the Nobel Prize–winning economist 
John R. Hicks, “Mr. Keynes and the Classics: A Suggested Interpretation,” Econometrica 5 (1937): 
147–159.

 11-1  The Goods Market and the IS Curve
The IS curve plots the relationship between the interest rate and the level of 
income that arises in the market for goods and services. To develop this relation­
ship, we start with a basic model called the Keynesian cross. This model is the 
simplest interpretation of Keynes’s theory of how national income is determined 
and is a building block for the more complex and realistic IS–LM model.
The Keynesian Cross
In The General Theory, Keynes proposed that an economy’s total income is, in 
the short run, determined largely by the spending plans of households, busi­
nesses, and government. The more people want to spend, the more goods and 
services firms can sell. The more firms can sell, the more output they will choose 
to produce and the more workers they will choose to hire. Keynes believed 
that the problem during recessions and depressions is inadequate spending. The 
­Keynesian cross is an attempt to model this insight.
Planned Expenditure We begin our derivation of the Keynesian cross by 
drawing a distinction between actual and planned expenditure. Actual expenditure 
is the amount households, firms, and the government spend on goods and ser­
vices, and as we first saw in Chapter 2, it equals the economy’s gross domestic 
product (GDP). Planned expenditure is the amount households, firms, and the 
government would like to spend on goods and services.
Why would actual expenditure ever differ from planned expenditure? The 
answer is that firms might engage in unplanned inventory investment because 
their sales do not meet their expectations. When firms sell less of their product 
Shifts in Aggregate Demand 
For a given price level, national 
income fluctuates because of 
shifts in the aggregate demand 
curve. The IS–LM model takes 
the price level as given and 
shows what causes income to 
change. The model therefore 
shows what causes aggregate 
demand to shift.

than they planned, their stock of inventories automatically rises; conversely, 
when firms sell more than planned, their stock of inventories falls. Because these 
unplanned changes in inventory are counted as investment spending by firms, 
actual expenditure can be either above or below planned expenditure.
Now consider the determinants of planned expenditure. Assuming that the 
economy is closed, so that net exports are zero, we write planned expenditure PE 
as the sum of consumption C, planned investment I, and government purchases G:
PE 5 C 1 I 1 G.
To this equation, we add the consumption function:
C 5 C(Y 2 T).
This equation states that consumption depends on disposable income (Y 2 T), 
which is total income Y minus taxes T. To keep things simple, for now we take 
planned investment as exogenously fixed:
I 5 I–.
Finally, as in Chapter 3, we assume that fiscal policy—the levels of government 
purchases and taxes—is fixed:
G 5 G–.

function is the marginal pro­
pensity to consume, MPC.

thus higher planned expenditure. The slope of this line is the marginal propen­
sity to consume, MPC: it shows how much planned expenditure increases when 
income rises by $1. This planned-expenditure function is the first piece of the 
Keynesian cross.
The Economy in Equilibrium The next piece of the Keynesian cross is 
the assumption that the economy is in equilibrium when actual expenditure 
equals planned expenditure. This assumption is based on the idea that when 
people’s plans have been realized, they have no reason to change what they 
are doing. Recalling that Y as GDP equals not only total income but also 
total actual expenditure on goods and services, we can write this equilibrium 
condition as
Actual Expenditure 5 Planned Expenditure
 Y 5 PE.
The 45-degree line in Figure 11-3 plots the points where this condition holds. 
With the addition of the planned-expenditure function, this diagram becomes 
the Keynesian cross. The equilibrium of this economy is at point A, where the 
planned-expenditure function crosses the 45-degree line.
How does the economy get to equilibrium? In this model, inventories play 
an important role in the adjustment process. Whenever an economy is not in 
equilibrium, firms experience unplanned changes in inventories, and this induces 
them to change production levels. Changes in production in turn influence total 
income and expenditure, moving the economy toward equilibrium.
For example, suppose the economy finds itself with GDP at a level greater 
than the equilibrium level, such as the level Y1 in Figure 11-4. In this case, 
The Keynesian Cross

cross is the point at which

planned expenditure PE1 is less than production Y1, so firms are selling less than 
they are producing. Firms add the unsold goods to their stock of inventories. 
This unplanned rise in inventories induces firms to lay off workers and reduce 
production; these actions in turn reduce GDP. This process of unintended inven­
tory accumulation and falling income continues until income Y falls to the 
equilibrium level.
Similarly, suppose GDP is at a level lower than the equilibrium level, such as the 
level Y2 in Figure 11-4. In this case, planned expenditure PE2 is greater than pro­
duction Y2. Firms meet the high level of sales by drawing down their inventories. 
But when firms see their stock of inventories dwindle, they hire more workers 
and increase production. GDP rises, and the economy approaches equilibrium.
In summary, the Keynesian cross shows how income Y is determined for given 
levels of planned investment I and fiscal policy G and T. We can use this model 
to show how income changes when one of these exogenous variables changes.
Fiscal Policy and the Multiplier: Government Purchases  Consider 
how changes in government purchases affect the economy. Because government 
purchases are one component of expenditure, higher government purchases 
result in higher planned expenditure for any given level of income. If govern­
ment purchases rise by DG, then the planned-expenditure schedule shifts upward 
by DG, as in Figure 11-5. The equilibrium of the economy moves from point 
A to point B.
This graph shows that an increase in government purchases leads to an even 
greater increase in income. That is, DY is larger than DG. The ratio DY/DG is 
called the government-purchases multiplier; it tells us how much income 
rises in response to a $1 increase in government purchases. An implication of 
the Keynesian cross is that the government-purchases multiplier is larger than 1.
The Adjustment to Equilibrium in 
the Keynesian Cross  If firms are 
producing at level Y1, then planned 
expenditure PE1 falls short of produc­
tion, and firms accumulate inven­
tories. This inventory accumulation 
induces firms to decrease produc­
tion. Similarly, if firms are producing 
at level Y2, then planned expenditure 
PE2 exceeds production, and firms 
run down their inventories. This 
fall in inventories induces firms to 
increase production. In both cases, 
the firms’ decisions drive the econo­
my toward equilibrium.

Why does fiscal policy have a multiplied effect on income? The reason is that, 
according to the consumption function C 5 C(Y 2 T ), higher income causes 
higher consumption. When an increase in government purchases raises income, 
it also raises consumption, which further raises income, which further raises 
consumption, and so on. Therefore, in this model, an increase in government 
purchases causes a greater increase in income.
How big is the multiplier? To answer this question, we trace through each 
step of the change in income. The process begins when expenditure rises by 
DG, which implies that income rises by DG as well. This increase in income in 
turn raises consumption by MPC 3 DG, where MPC is the marginal propensity 
to consume. This increase in consumption raises expenditure and income once 
again. This second increase in income of MPC 3 DG again raises consump­
tion, this time by MPC 3 (MPC 3 DG ), which again raises expenditure and 
income, and so on. This feedback from consumption to income to consumption 
continues indefinitely. The total effect on income is

An Increase in Government

purchases of DG raises planned 
expenditure by that amount for any 
given level of income. The equilib­
rium moves from point A to point 
B, and income rises from Y1 to Y2. 
Note that the increase in income DY 
exceeds the increase in government 
purchases DG. Thus, fiscal policy has 
a multiplied effect on income.

The government-purchases multiplier is
DY/DG 5 1 1 MPC 1 MPC2 1 MPC3 1 . . . .
This expression for the multiplier is an example of an infinite geometric series. 
A result from algebra allows us to write the multiplier as2
DY/DG 5 1/(1 2 MPC).
For example, if the marginal propensity to consume is 0.6, the multiplier is
DY/DG 5 1 1 0.6 1 0.62 1 0.63 1 . . .
 5 1/(1 2 0.6)
 5 2.5.
In this case, a $1.00 increase in government purchases raises equilibrium income 
by $2.50.3
Fiscal Policy and the Multiplier: Taxes  Now consider how changes in 
taxes affect equilibrium income. A decrease in taxes of DT immediately raises 
disposable income Y 2 T by DT and, therefore, increases consumption by 
MPC 3 DT. For any given level of income Y, planned expenditure is now 
higher. As Figure 11-6 shows, the planned-expenditure schedule shifts upward 
by MPC 3 DT. The equilibrium of the economy moves from point A to 
point B.
2Mathematical note: We prove this algebraic result as follows. For |x| , 1, let
z 5 1 1 x 1 x2 1 . . . .
Multiply both sides of this equation by x:
xz 5 x 1 x2 1 x3 1 . . . .
Subtract the second equation from the first:
z 2 xz 5 1.
Rearrange this last equation to obtain
z(1 2 x) 5 1,
which implies
z 5 1/(1 2 x).
This completes the proof.
3Mathematical note: The government-purchases multiplier is most easily derived using a little 
calculus. Begin with the equation
Y 5 C(Y 2 T) 1 I 1 G. 
Holding T and I fixed, differentiate to obtain
dY 5 CdY 1 dG,
and then rearrange to find
dY/dG 5 1/(1 2 C).
This is the same as the equation in the text.

A Decrease in Taxes in the

of DT raises planned expenditure 
by MPC 3 DT for any given level of 
income. The equilibrium moves from 
point A to point B, and income rises 
from Y1 to Y2. Again, fiscal policy has 
a multiplied effect on income.
Just as an increase in government purchases has a multiplied effect on income, 
so does a decrease in taxes. As before, the initial change in expenditure, now 
MPC 3 DT, is multiplied by 1/(1 2 MPC). The overall effect on income of the 
change in taxes is
DY/DT 5 2MPC/(1 2 MPC).
This expression is the tax multiplier, the amount income changes in response 
to a $1 change in taxes. (The negative sign indicates that income moves in the 
opposite direction from taxes.) For example, if the marginal propensity to con­
sume is 0.6, then the tax multiplier is
DY/DT 5 20.6/(1 2 0.6) 5 21.5.
In this example, a $1.00 cut in taxes raises equilibrium income by $1.50.4

Cutting Taxes to Stimulate the Economy: 
The Kennedy and Bush Tax Cuts
When John F. Kennedy became president of the United States in 1961, he 
brought to Washington some of the brightest young economists of the day to 
work on his Council of Economic Advisers. These economists, who had been 
schooled in the economics of Keynes, brought Keynesian ideas to discussions of 
economic policy at the highest level.
One of the council’s first proposals was to expand national income by reducing 
taxes. This eventually led to a substantial cut in personal and corporate income 
taxes in 1964. The tax cut was intended to stimulate expenditure on consump­
tion and investment and thus lead to higher levels of income and employment. 
When a reporter asked Kennedy why he advocated a tax cut, Kennedy replied, 
“To stimulate the economy. Don’t you remember your Economics 101?”
As Kennedy’s economic advisers predicted, the passage of the tax cut was fol­
lowed by an economic boom. Growth in real GDP was 5.8 percent in 1964 and 
6.5 percent in 1965. The unemployment rate fell from 5.6 percent in 1963 to 
5.2 percent in 1964 and then to 4.5 percent in 1965.
Economists continue to debate the source of this rapid growth in the early 
1960s. A group called supply-siders argue that the economic boom resulted from 
the incentive effects of the cut in income tax rates. According to supply-siders, 
when workers are allowed to keep a higher fraction of their earnings, they supply 
substantially more labor and expand the aggregate supply of goods and services. 
Keynesians, however, emphasize the impact of tax cuts on aggregate demand. 
Most likely, there is some truth to both views: Tax cuts stimulate aggregate supply 
by improving workers’ incentives and expand aggregate demand by raising households’ 
disposable income.
When George W. Bush was elected president in 2000, a major element of 
his platform was a cut in income taxes. Bush and his advisers used both supply-
side and Keynesian rhetoric to make the case for their policy. (Full disclosure: 
The author of this textbook was one of Bush’s economic advisers from 2003 to 
2005.) During the campaign, when the economy was doing fine, they argued 
that lower marginal tax rates would improve work incentives. But when the 
economy started to slow, and unemployment started to rise, the argument shifted 
to emphasize that the tax cut would stimulate spending and help the economy 
recover from the recession.
Congress passed major tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. After the second tax cut, the 
weak recovery from the 2001 recession turned into a more robust one. Growth 
in real GDP was 3.8 percent in 2004. The unemployment rate fell from its peak 
of 6.3 percent in June 2003 to 4.9 percent in December 2005.
When President Bush signed the 2003 tax bill, he explained the measure using 
the logic of aggregate demand: “When people have more money, they can spend it 
on goods and services. And in our society, when they demand an additional good 
or a service, somebody will produce the good or a service. And when somebody 
produces that good or a service, it means somebody is more likely to be able to 
find a job.” The explanation could have come from an exam in Economics 101. n

Increasing Government Purchases to Stimulate the 
Economy: The Obama Stimulus
When President Barack Obama took office in January 2009, the economy was 
suffering from a significant recession. (The causes of this recession are discussed 
in a Case Study in the next chapter and in more detail in Chapter 20.) Even 
before he was inaugurated, the president and his advisers proposed a sizable stim­
ulus package to increase aggregate demand. As proposed, the package would cost 
the federal government about $800 billion, or about 5 percent of annual GDP. 
The package included some tax cuts and higher transfer payments, but much of 
it was made up of increases in government purchases of goods and services.
Professional economists debated the merits of the plan. Advocates of the Obama 
plan argued that increased spending was better than reduced taxes because, according 
to standard ­Keynesian theory, the gov­
ernment-purchases multiplier exceeds 
the tax multiplier. The reason for this dif­
ference is simple: when the government 
spends a dollar, that dollar gets spent, 
whereas when the government gives 
households a tax cut of a dollar, some 
of that dollar might be saved. According 
to an analysis by Obama administration 
economists, the government purchases 
multiplier is 1.57, whereas the tax mul­
tiplier is only 0.99. Thus, they argued 
that increased government spending on 
roads, schools, and other infrastructure 
was the better route to increase aggregate 
demand and create jobs. The logic here is quintessentially Keynesian: as the economy 
sinks into recession, the government is acting as the demander of last resort.
The Obama stimulus proposal was controversial among economists for vari­
ous reasons. One criticism was that the stimulus was not large enough given the 
apparent depth of the economic downturn. In March 2009, economist Paul 
Krugman wrote in the New York Times:
The plan was too small and too cautious. . . . Employment has already fallen 
more in this recession than in the 1981–82 slump, considered the worst since 
the Great Depression. As a result, Mr. Obama’s promise that his plan will create 
or save 3.5 million jobs by the end of 2010 looks underwhelming, to say the 
least. It’s a credible promise—his economists used solidly mainstream estimates 
of the impacts of tax and spending policies. But 3.5 million jobs almost two 
years from now isn’t enough in the face of an economy that has already lost 
4.4 million jobs, and is losing 600,000 more each month.5

Still other economists argued that despite the predictions of conventional 
Keynesian models, spending-based fiscal stimulus is not as effective as tax-based 
initiatives. A study of fiscal policy since 1970 in countries that are members 
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
examined which kinds of fiscal stimulus have historically been most successful at 
promoting growth in economic activity. It found that successful fiscal stimulus 
relies almost entirely on cuts in business and income taxes, whereas failed fiscal 
stimulus relies primarily on increases in government spending.6
In addition, some economists thought that using infrastructure spending to 
promote employment might conflict with the goal of obtaining the infrastruc­
ture that was most needed. Here is how economist Gary Becker explained the 
concern on his blog:
Putting new infrastructure spending in depressed areas like Detroit might 
have a big stimulating effect since infrastructure building projects in these areas 
can utilize some of the considerable unemployed resources there. However, many 
of these areas are also declining because they have been producing goods and 
services that are not in great demand, and will not be in demand in the future. 
Therefore, the overall value added by improving their roads and other infra­
structure is likely to be a lot less than if the new infrastructure were located in 
growing areas that might have relatively little unemployment, but do have great 
demand for more roads, schools, and other types of long-term infrastructure.
In the end, Congress went ahead with President Obama’s proposed stimulus 
plans with relatively minor modifications. The president signed the $787 billion 
bill on February 17, 2009. Did it work? The economy recovered from the 
recession, but more slowly than the Obama administration economists ini­
tially forecast. Whether the slow recovery reflects the failure of stimulus policy 
or a sicker economy than the economists first appreciated is a question of 
continuing debate. n 
Using Regional Data to Estimate Multipliers
As the preceding two case studies show, policymakers often change taxes and 
government spending to influence the economy. The short-run effects of these 
policy moves can be understood using Keynesian theory, such as the Keynesian 
cross and the IS–LM model. But do these policies work as well in practice as 
they do in theory?
Unfortunately, that question is hard to answer. When policymakers change 
fiscal policy, they usually do so for good reason. Because many other things are 
happening at the same time, there is no easy way to separate the effects of the 
CASE STUDY

Policy and the Economy 24 (2010): 35–68. Another study reporting a tax multiplier that exceeds 
the spending multiplier is Robert J. Barro and Charles J. Redlick, “Macroeconomic Effects from 
Government Purchases and Taxes,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, 126 (2011): 51–102.

fiscal policy from the effects of the other events. For example, President Obama 
proposed his 2009 stimulus plan because the economy was suffering in the after­
math of a financial crisis. We can observe what happened to the economy after 
the stimulus was passed, but disentangling the effects of the stimulus from the 
lingering effects of the financial crisis is a formidable task.
Increasingly, economists have tried to estimate multipliers for fiscal policy 
using regional data from states or provinces within a country. The use of regional 
data has two advantages. First, it increases the number of observations: the United 
States, for instance, has only one national economy but 50 state economies. 
Second, and more important, it is possible to find variation in regional govern­
ment spending that is plausibly unrelated to other events affecting the regional 
economy. By examining such random variation in government spending, a 
researcher can more easily identify its macroeconomic effects without being led 
astray by other, confounding variables.
In one such study, Emi Nakamura and Jón Steinsson looked at the impact of 
defense spending on state economies. They began with the fact that states vary 
considerably in the size of their defense industries. For example, military con­
tractors are more important in California than in Illinois: when the U.S. federal 
government increases defense spending by 1% of U.S. GDP, defense spending 
in California rises on average by about 3% of California GDP, while defense 
spending in Illinois rises by only about 0.5% of Illinois GDP. By examining 
what happens to the California economy relative to the Illinois economy when 
the United States embarks on a military buildup, we can estimate the effects of 
government spending. Using data from all 50 states, Nakamura and Steinsson 
reported a government-purchases multiplier of 1.5. That is, when the govern­
ment increases defense spending in a state by $1.00, it increases that state’s 
GDP by $1.50.
In another study, Antonio Acconcia, Giancarlo Corsetti, and Saverio Simonelli 
used data from provinces within Italy to study the multiplier. Here the varia­
tion in government spending comes not from military buildups but from an 
Italian law cracking down on organized crime. According to the law, whenever 
the police uncover incriminating evidence that the Mafia has infiltrated a city 
council, the council is dismissed and replaced by external commissioners. These 
commissioners typically implement an immediate, unanticipated, and temporary 
cut in public investment projects. The study reported that this cut in government 
spending has a significant impact on the province’s GDP. Once again, the mul­
tiplier is estimated to be about 1.5. Hence, these studies confirm the prediction 
of Keynesian theory that changes in government purchases can have a sizeable 
effect on an economy’s output of goods and services.
It is unclear, however, how to use these estimates from regional economies 
to draw inferences about national economies. One problem is that the regional 
government spending these researchers studied was not financed with regional 
taxes. Defense spending in California is largely paid for by federal taxes levied 
on the other 49 states, and the public investment projects in an Italian province 
are largely paid for at the national level. By contrast, when a nation increases its 
government spending, it has to increase taxes, either in the present or the future,

The Interest Rate, Investment, and the IS Curve
The Keynesian cross is only a stepping-stone on our path to the IS–LM model, 
which explains the economy’s aggregate demand curve. The Keynesian cross is 
useful because it shows how the spending plans of households, firms, and the 
government determine the economy’s income. Yet it makes the simplifying 
assumption that the level of planned investment I is fixed. As we discussed in 
Chapter 3, an important macroeconomic relationship is that planned investment 
depends on the interest rate r.
To add this relationship between the interest rate and investment to our 
model, we write the level of planned investment as
I 5 I(r).
This investment function is graphed in panel (a) of Figure 11-7. Because the 
interest rate is the cost of borrowing to finance investment projects, an increase 
in the interest rate reduces planned investment. As a result, the investment func­
tion slopes downward.
to pay for it. These higher taxes could depress economic activity, leading to a 
smaller multiplier. A second problem is that these regional changes in govern­
ment spending do not influence monetary policy, because central banks focus on 
national rather than regional conditions. By contrast, a national change in gov­
ernment spending could well induce a change in monetary policy. In its attempt 
to stabilize the economy, the central bank may offset some of the effects of fiscal 
policy, making the multiplier smaller.
Although both of these problems suggest that national multipliers are likely 
smaller than regional multipliers, a third problem works in the opposite direction. 
In a small regional economy, such as a state, many of the goods and services 
people buy are imported from neighboring states, whereas imports are a smaller 
share of a large national economy. When imports play a larger role, the marginal 
propensity to consume on domestic goods (those made within the state) is 
smaller. As the Keynesian cross describes, a smaller marginal propensity to con­
sume on domestic goods leads to smaller second- and third-round effects and, 
thereby, a smaller multiplier. For this reason, national multipliers could be larger 
than regional multipliers.
The bottom line from studies of regional economies is that the demand from 
government purchases can exert a strong influence on economic activity. But 
the size of that effect as measured by the multiplier at the national level remains 
open to debate.7 n

To determine how income changes when the interest rate changes, we can 
combine the investment function with the Keynesian-cross diagram. Because invest­
ment is inversely related to the interest rate, an increase in the interest rate from r1 
to r2 reduces the quantity of investment from I(r1) to I(r2). The reduction in planned 
investment, in turn, shifts the planned-expenditure function downward, as in panel 
(b) of  Figure 11-7. The shift in the planned-expenditure function causes the level of 
income to fall from Y1 to Y2. Hence, an increase in the interest rate lowers income.
The IS curve, shown in panel (c) of Figure 11-7, summarizes this relation­
ship between the interest rate and the level of income. In essence, the IS curve 
combines the interaction between r and I expressed by the investment function 
and the interaction between I and Y demonstrated by the Keynesian cross. Each 
point on the IS curve represents equilibrium in the goods market, and the curve 
illustrates how the equilibrium level of income depends on the interest rate. 
Because an increase in the interest rate causes planned investment to fall, which 
in turn causes equilibrium income to fall, the IS curve slopes downward.

How Fiscal Policy Shifts the IS Curve
The IS curve shows us, for any given interest rate, the level of income that brings 
the goods market into equilibrium. As we learned from the Keynesian cross, the 
equilibrium level of income also depends on government spending G and taxes T. 
The IS curve is drawn for a given fiscal policy; that is, when we construct the IS 
curve, we hold G and T fixed. When fiscal policy changes, the IS curve shifts.
Figure 11-8 uses the Keynesian cross to show how an increase in government 
purchases DG shifts the IS curve. This figure is drawn for a given interest rate r¯

An Increase in Government

Outward  Panel (a) shows 
that an increase in ­government 
­purchases raises planned 
expenditure. For any given 
interest rate, the upward shift 
in planned expenditure of DG 
leads to an increase in income Y 
of DG/(1 2 MPC). Therefore, in 
panel (b), the IS curve shifts to 
the right by this amount.

and thus for a given level of planned investment. The Keynesian cross in panel 
(a) shows that this change in fiscal policy raises planned expenditure and thereby 
increases equilibrium income from Y1 to Y2. Therefore, in panel (b), the increase 
in government purchases shifts the IS curve outward.
We can use the Keynesian cross to see how other changes in fiscal policy shift 
the IS curve. Because a decrease in taxes also expands expenditure and income, 
it, too, shifts the IS curve outward. A decrease in government purchases or an 
increase in taxes reduces income; therefore, such a change in fiscal policy shifts 
the IS curve inward.
In summary, the IS curve shows the combinations of the interest rate and the level of 
income that are consistent with equilibrium in the market for goods and services. The IS 
curve is drawn for a given fiscal policy. Changes in fiscal policy that raise the demand for 
goods and services shift the IS curve to the right. Changes in fiscal policy that reduce the 
demand for goods and services shift the IS curve to the left.
 11-2	 The Money Market and the LM Curve
The LM curve plots the relationship between the interest rate and the level of 
income that arises in the market for money balances. To understand this relation­
ship, we begin by looking at a theory of the interest rate called the theory of 
liquidity preference.
The Theory of Liquidity Preference
In his classic work The General Theory, Keynes offered his view of how the inter­
est rate is determined in the short run. His explanation is called the theory of 
liquidity preference because it posits that the interest rate adjusts to balance the 
supply and demand for the economy’s most liquid asset—money. Just as the 
Keynesian cross is a building block for the IS curve, the theory of liquidity pref­
erence is a building block for the LM curve.
To develop this theory, we begin with the supply of real money balances. If M 
stands for the supply of money and P stands for the price level, then M/P is the 
supply of real money balances. The theory of liquidity preference assumes there 
is a fixed supply of real money balances. That is,
(M/P)s 5 M–/P–
The money supply M is an exogenous policy variable chosen by a central bank, 
such as the Federal Reserve. The price level P is also an exogenous variable in 
this model. (We take the price level as given because the IS–LM model—our 
ultimate goal in this chapter—explains the short run when the price level is 
fixed.) These assumptions imply that the supply of real money balances is fixed 
and, in particular, does not depend on the interest rate. Thus, when we plot the 
supply of real money balances against the interest rate in Figure 11-9, we obtain 
a vertical supply curve.

328 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
Next, consider the demand for real money balances. The theory of liquidity 
preference posits that the interest rate is one determinant of how much money 
people choose to hold. The underlying reason is that the interest rate is the 
opportunity cost of holding money: it is what you forgo by holding some of 
your assets as money, which does not bear interest, instead of as interest-bearing 
bank deposits or bonds. When the interest rate rises, people want to hold less 
of their wealth in the form of money. We can write the demand for real money 
balances as
(M/P)d 5 L(r),
where the function L( ) shows that the quantity of money demanded depends 
on the interest rate. The demand curve in Figure 11-9 slopes downward because 
higher interest rates reduce the quantity of real money balances demanded.8
According to the theory of liquidity preference, the supply and demand for 
real money balances determine what interest rate prevails in the economy. That 
is, the interest rate adjusts to equilibrate the money market. As the figure shows, 
at the equilibrium interest rate, the quantity of real money balances demanded 
equals the quantity supplied.
FIGURE  11-9
The Theory of Liquidity 
Preference  The supply and 
demand for real money bal­
ances determine the interest 
rate. The supply curve for real 
money balances is vertical 
because the supply does not 
depend on the interest rate. 
The demand curve is down­
ward sloping because a higher 
interest rate raises the cost of 
holding money and thus low­
ers the quantity ­demanded. 
At the equilibrium interest 
rate, the quantity of real 
money balances demanded 
equals the quantity supplied.

8Note that r is being used to denote the interest rate here, as it was in our discussion of the IS 
curve. More accurately, it is the nominal interest rate that determines money demand and the real 
interest rate that determines investment. To keep things simple, we are ignoring expected inflation, 
which creates the difference between the real and nominal interest rates. For short-run analysis, 
it is often realistic to assume that expected inflation is constant, in which case real and nominal 
interest rates move together. The role of expected inflation in the IS–LM model is explored in 
Chapter 12.

C H A P T E R  1 1   Aggregate Demand I: Building the IS–LM Model  | 329
How does the interest rate get to this equilibrium of money supply and 
money demand? The adjustment occurs because whenever the money mar­
ket is not in equilibrium, people try to adjust their portfolios of assets and, 
in the process, alter the interest rate. For instance, if the interest rate is above 
the equilibrium level, the quantity of real money balances supplied exceeds 
the quantity demanded. Individuals holding the excess supply of money try 
to convert some of their non-interest-bearing money into interest-bearing 
bank deposits or bonds. Banks and bond issuers, which prefer to pay lower 
interest rates, respond to this excess supply of money by lowering the inter­
est rates they offer. Conversely, if the interest rate is below the equilibrium 
level, so that the quantity of money demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, 
individuals try to obtain money by selling bonds or making bank withdrawals. 
To attract now-scarcer funds, banks and bond issuers respond by increasing 
the interest rates they offer. Eventually, the interest rate reaches the equilib­
rium level, at which people are content with their portfolios of monetary and 
nonmonetary assets.
Now that we have seen how the interest rate is determined, we can use 
the theory of liquidity preference to show how the interest rate responds to 
changes in the supply of money. Suppose, for instance, that the Fed suddenly 
decreases the money supply. A fall in M reduces M/P because P is fixed in the 
model. The supply of real money balances shifts to the left, as in Figure 11-10. 
The equilibrium interest rate rises from r1 to r2, and the higher interest rate 
makes people satisfied to hold the smaller quantity of real money balances. The 
opposite would occur if the Fed had suddenly increased the money supply. 
Thus, according to the theory of liquidity preference, a decrease in the money 
supply raises the interest rate, and an increase in the money supply lowers the 
interest rate.

If the price level is fixed,

rises from r1 to r2.

330 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
Income, Money Demand, and the LM Curve
Having developed the theory of liquidity preference as an explanation for how 
the interest rate is determined, we can now use the theory to derive the LM 
curve. We begin by considering the following question: How does a change in 
Does a Monetary Tightening Raise or Lower
Interest Rates?
How does a tightening of monetary policy influence nominal interest rates? 
According to the theories we have been developing, the answer depends on 
the time horizon. Our analysis of the Fisher effect in Chapter 5 suggests that, 
in the long run when prices are flexible, a reduction in money growth would 
lower inflation, and this in turn would lead to lower nominal interest rates. Yet 
the theory of liquidity preference predicts that, in the short run when prices 
are sticky, anti-inflationary monetary policy would lead to falling real money 
balances and higher interest rates.
Both conclusions are consistent with experience. A good illustration occurred 
during the early 1980s, when the U.S. economy saw the largest and quickest 
reduction in inflation in recent history.
Here’s the background: By the late 1970s, inflation in the U.S. economy 
had reached the double-digit range and was a major national problem. In 1979 
consumer prices were rising at a rate of 11.3 percent per year. In October of 
that year, only two months after becoming the chairman of the Federal Reserve, 
Paul Volcker decided that it was time to change course. He announced that 
monetary policy would aim to reduce the rate of inflation. This announcement 
began a period of tight money that, by 1983, brought the inflation rate down to 
3.2 percent.
Let’s look at what happened to nominal interest rates. If we look at the period 
immediately after the October 1979 announcement of tighter monetary policy, 
we see a fall in real money balances and a rise in the interest rate—just as the 
theory of liquidity preference predicts. Nominal interest rates on three-month 
Treasury bills rose from 10.3 percent just before the October 1979 announce­
ment to 11.4 percent in 1980 and 14.0 percent in 1981. Yet these high interest 
rates were only temporary. As Volcker’s change in monetary policy lowered infla­
tion and expectations of inflation, nominal interest rates gradually fell, reaching 
6.0 percent in 1986.
This episode illustrates a general lesson: to understand the link between 
monetary policy and nominal interest rates, we need to keep in mind both the 
theory of liquidity preference and the Fisher effect. A monetary tightening leads 
to higher nominal interest rates in the short run and lower nominal interest rates 
in the long run. n

the economy’s level of income Y affect the market for real money balances? The 
answer (which should be familiar from Chapter 5) is that the level of income 
affects the demand for money. When income is high, expenditure is high, so 
people engage in more transactions that require the use of money. Thus, greater 
income implies greater money demand. We can express these ideas by writing 
the money demand function as
(M/P )d 5 L(r, Y).
The quantity of real money balances demanded is negatively related to the 
interest rate and positively related to income.
Using the theory of liquidity preference, we can figure out what happens to 
the equilibrium interest rate when the level of income changes. For example, 
consider what happens in Figure 11-11 when income increases from Y1 to Y2. 
As panel (a) illustrates, this increase in income shifts the money demand curve 
to the right. With the supply of real money balances unchanged, the interest 
rate must rise from r1 to r2 to equilibrate the money market. Therefore, accord­
ing to the theory of liquidity preference, higher income leads to a higher 
interest rate.
The LM curve shown in panel (b) of Figure 11-11 summarizes this rela­
tionship between the level of income and the interest rate. Each point on the 
LM curve represents equilibrium in the money market, and the curve illus­
trates how the equilibrium interest rate depends on the level of income. The

332 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
higher the level of income, the higher the demand for real money balances, 
and the higher the equilibrium interest rate. For this reason, the LM curve 
slopes upward.
How Monetary Policy Shifts the LM Curve
The LM curve tells us the interest rate that equilibrates the money market at any 
level of income. Yet, as we saw earlier, the equilibrium interest rate also depends 
on the supply of real money balances M/P. This means that the LM curve is 
drawn for a given supply of real money balances. If real money balances change—
for example, if the Fed alters the money supply—the LM curve shifts.
We can use the theory of liquidity preference to understand how monetary 
policy shifts the LM curve. Suppose that the Fed decreases the money supply 
from M1 to M2, which causes the supply of real money balances to fall from 
M1/P to M2/P. Figure 11-12 shows what happens. Holding constant the amount 
of income and thus the demand curve for real money balances, we see that a 
reduction in the supply of real money balances raises the interest rate that equili­
brates the money market. Hence, a decrease in the money supply shifts the LM 
curve upward.
In summary, the LM curve shows the combinations of the interest rate and the level of 
income that are consistent with equilibrium in the market for real money balances. The LM 
curve is drawn for a given supply of real money balances. Decreases in the supply of real 
money balances shift the LM curve upward. Increases in the supply of real money balances 
shift the LM curve downward.

 11-3	 Conclusion: The Short-Run Equilibrium
We now have all the pieces of the IS–LM model. The two equations of this model are
Y 5 C(Y 2 T ) 1 I(r) 1 G	
IS,
M/P 5 L(r, Y )	
	
	
LM.
The model takes fiscal policy G and T, monetary policy M, and the price level P 
as exogenous. Given these exogenous variables, the IS curve provides the combi­
nations of r and Y that satisfy the equation representing the goods market, and the 
LM curve provides the combinations of r and Y that satisfy the equation repre­
senting the money market. These two curves are shown together in Figure 11-13.
The equilibrium of the economy is the point at which the IS curve and the 
LM curve cross. This point gives the interest rate r and the level of income Y 
that satisfy conditions for equilibrium in both the goods market and the money 
market. In other words, at this intersection, actual expenditure equals planned 
expenditure, and the demand for real money balances equals the supply.
As we conclude this chapter, let’s recall that our ultimate goal in develop­
ing the IS–LM model is to analyze short-run fluctuations in economic activity. 
­Figure 11-14 illustrates how the different pieces of our theory fit together. In this 
chapter we developed the Keynesian cross and the theory of liquidity preference 
as building blocks for the IS–LM model. As we see more fully in the next chapter, 
the IS–LM model helps explain the position and slope of the aggregate demand 
curve. The aggregate demand curve, in turn, is a piece of the model of aggregate 
supply and aggregate demand, which economists use to explain the short-run 
effects of policy changes and other events on national income.

Summary
	1.	The Keynesian cross is a basic model of income determination. It takes fiscal 
policy and planned investment as exogenous and then shows that there is one 
level of national income at which actual expenditure equals planned expendi­
ture. It shows that changes in fiscal policy have a multiplied impact on income.
	2.	Once we allow planned investment to depend on the interest rate, the 
Keynesian cross yields a relationship between the interest rate and national 
income. A higher interest rate lowers planned investment, and this in turn 
lowers national income. The downward-sloping IS curve summarizes this 
negative relationship between the interest rate and income.
	3.	The theory of liquidity preference is a basic model of the determination 
of the interest rate. It takes the money supply and the price level as exog­
enous and assumes that the interest rate adjusts to equilibrate the supply and 
demand for real money balances. The theory implies that increases in the 
money supply lower the interest rate.
	4.	Once we allow the demand for real money balances to depend on national 
income, the theory of liquidity preference yields a relationship between 
income and the interest rate. A higher level of income raises the demand for 
real money balances, and this in turn raises the interest rate. The upward-
sloping LM curve summarizes this positive relationship between income 
and the interest rate.

Aggregate Demand II: Applying 
the IS–LM Model
Science is a parasite: the greater the patient population the better the advance 
in physiology and pathology; and out of pathology arises therapy. The year 
1932 was the trough of the great depression, and from its rotten soil was 
belatedly begot a new subject that today we call macroeconomics.
—Paul Samuelson
I
n Chapter 11 we assembled the pieces of the IS–LM model as a step toward 
understanding short-run economic fluctuations. We saw that the IS curve 
represents the equilibrium in the market for goods and services, that the LM 
curve represents the equilibrium in the market for real money balances, and that 
the IS and LM curves together determine the interest rate and national income 
in the short run when the price level is fixed. Now we turn our attention to 
applying the IS–LM model to analyze three issues.
First, we examine the potential causes of fluctuations in national income. 
We use the IS–LM model to see how changes in the exogenous variables 
(­government purchases, taxes, and the money supply) influence the endog­
enous variables (the interest rate and national income) for a given price level. 
We also examine how various shocks to the goods market (the IS curve) and 
the money market (the LM curve) affect the interest rate and national income 
in the short run.
Second, we discuss how the IS–LM model fits into the model of aggregate 
supply and aggregate demand we introduced in Chapter 10. In particular, 
we examine how the IS–LM model provides a theory to explain the slope 
and position of the aggregate demand curve. Here we relax the assumption 
that the price level is fixed and show that the IS–LM model implies a nega­
tive relationship between the price level and national income. The model 
can also tell us what events shift the aggregate demand curve and in what 
direction.
Third, we examine the Great Depression of the 1930s. As this chapter’s open­
ing quotation indicates, this episode gave birth to short-run macroeconomic 
theory, for it led Keynes and his many followers to argue that aggregate demand 
12

338 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
was the key to understanding fluctuations in national income. With the benefit 
of hindsight, we can use the IS–LM model to discuss the various explanations of 
this traumatic economic downturn.
The IS–LM model has played a central role in the history of economic 
thought, and it offers a powerful lens through which to view economic history, 
but it has much modern significance as well. Throughout this chapter we will 
see that the model can also be used to shed light on more recent fluctuations in 
the economy; two case studies in the chapter use it to examine the recessions 
that began in 2001 and 2008. Moreover, as we will see in Chapter 15, the logic 
of the IS–LM model provides a good foundation for understanding newer and 
more sophisticated theories of the business cycle.
12-1 	Explaining Fluctuations With the 
IS–LM Model
The intersection of the IS curve and the LM curve determines the level of 
national income. When one of these curves shifts, the short-run equilibrium of 
the economy changes, and national income fluctuates. In this section we examine 
how changes in policy and shocks to the economy can cause these curves to shift.
How Fiscal Policy Shifts the IS Curve and Changes the 
Short-Run Equilibrium
We begin by examining how changes in fiscal policy (government purchases 
and taxes) alter the economy’s short-run equilibrium. Recall that changes in fiscal 
policy influence planned expenditure and thereby shift the IS curve. The IS–LM 
model shows how these shifts in the IS curve affect income and the interest rate.
Changes in Government Purchases  Consider an increase in government 
purchases of DG. The government-purchases multiplier in the Keynesian cross 
tells us that this change in fiscal policy raises the level of income at any given 
interest rate by DG/(1 2 MPC). Therefore, as Figure 12-1 shows, the IS curve 
shifts to the right by this amount. The equilibrium of the economy moves from 
point A to point B. The increase in government purchases raises both income 
and the interest rate.
To understand fully what’s happening in Figure 12-1, it helps to keep in mind 
the building blocks for the IS–LM model from the preceding chapter—the 
Keynesian cross and the theory of liquidity preference. Here is the story. When 
the government increases its purchases of goods and services, the economy’s 
planned expenditure rises. The increase in planned expenditure stimulates the 
production of goods and services, which causes total income Y to rise. These 
effects should be familiar from the Keynesian cross.
Now consider the money market, as described by the theory of liquidity pref­
erence. Because the economy’s demand for money depends on income, the rise 

C H A P T E R  1 2   Aggregate Demand II: Applying the IS–LM Model  | 339
in total income increases the quantity of money demanded at every interest rate. 
The supply of money, however, has not changed, so higher money demand causes 
the equilibrium interest rate r to rise.
The higher interest rate arising in the money market, in turn, has ramifica­
tions back in the goods market. When the interest rate rises, firms cut back on 
their investment plans. This fall in investment partially offsets the expansionary 
effect of the increase in government purchases. Thus, the increase in income in 
response to a fiscal expansion is smaller in the IS–LM model than it is in the 
Keynesian cross (where investment is assumed to be fixed). You can see this in 
Figure 12-1. The horizontal shift in the IS curve equals the rise in equilibrium 
income in the Keynesian cross. This amount is larger than the increase in equi­
librium income here in the IS–LM model. The difference is explained by the 
crowding out of investment due to a higher interest rate.
Changes in Taxes  In the IS–LM model, changes in taxes affect the economy 
much the same as changes in government purchases do, except that taxes affect 
expenditure through consumption. Consider, for instance, a decrease in taxes of 
DT. The tax cut encourages consumers to spend more and, therefore, increases 
planned expenditure. The tax multiplier in the Keynesian cross tells us that this 
change in policy raises the level of income at any given interest rate by DT 3 
MPC/(1 2 MPC). Therefore, as Figure 12-2 illustrates, the IS curve shifts to the 
right by this amount. The equilibrium of the economy moves from point A to 
point B. The tax cut raises both income and the interest rate. Once again, because 
the higher interest rate depresses investment, the increase in income is smaller in 
the IS–LM model than it is in the Keynesian cross.

How Monetary Policy Shifts the LM Curve and Changes 
the Short-Run Equilibrium
We now examine the effects of monetary policy. Recall that a change in the 
money supply alters the interest rate that equilibrates the money market for any 
given level of income and, thus, shifts the LM curve. The IS–LM model shows 
how a shift in the LM curve affects income and the interest rate.
Consider an increase in the money supply. An increase in M leads to an 
increase in real money balances M/P because the price level P is fixed in the 
short run. The theory of liquidity preference shows that for any given level of 
income, an increase in real money balances leads to a lower interest rate. There­
fore, the LM curve shifts downward, as in Figure 12-3. The equilibrium moves 
from point A to point B. The increase in the money supply lowers the interest 
rate and raises the level of income.
Once again, to tell the story that explains the economy’s adjustment from 
point A to point B, we rely on the building blocks of the IS–LM model—the 
Keynesian cross and the theory of liquidity preference. This time, we begin 
with the money market, where the monetary-policy action occurs. When the 
Federal Reserve increases the supply of money, people have more money than 
they want to hold at the prevailing interest rate. As a result, they start depositing 
this extra money in banks or using it to buy bonds. The interest rate r then falls 
until people are willing to hold all the extra money that the Fed has created; 
this brings the money market to a new equilibrium. The lower interest rate, 
in turn, has ramifications for the goods market. A lower interest rate stimulates 
planned investment, which increases planned expenditure, production, and 
income Y.

Thus, the IS–LM model shows that monetary policy influences income 
by changing the interest rate. This conclusion sheds light on our analysis of 
­monetary policy in Chapter 10. In that chapter we showed that in the short run, 
when prices are sticky, an expansion in the money supply raises income. But we 
did not discuss how a monetary expansion induces greater spending on goods 
and services—a process called the monetary transmission mechanism. The 
IS–LM model shows an important part of that mechanism: An increase in the 
money supply lowers the interest rate, which stimulates investment and thereby expands 
the demand for goods and services. The next chapter shows that in open economies, 
the exchange rate also has a role in the monetary transmission mechanism; for 
large economies such as that of the United States, however, the interest rate has 
the leading role.
The Interaction Between Monetary and Fiscal Policy
When analyzing any change in monetary or fiscal policy, it is important to keep 
in mind that the policymakers who control these policy tools are aware of what 
the other policymakers are doing. A change in one policy, therefore, may influ­
ence the other, and this interdependence may alter the impact of a policy change.
For example, suppose Congress raises taxes. What effect will this policy have 
on the economy? According to the IS–LM model, the answer depends on how 
the Fed responds to the tax increase.
Figure 12-4 shows three of the many possible outcomes. In panel (a), the Fed 
holds the money supply constant. The tax increase shifts the IS curve to the left. 
Income falls ( because higher taxes reduce consumer spending), and the interest 
rate falls ( because lower income reduces the demand for money). The fall in 
income indicates that the tax hike causes a recession.

responds to a tax increase depends 
on how the central bank responds. 
In panel (a) the Fed holds the money

In panel ( b), the Fed wants to hold the interest rate constant. In this case, when 
the tax increase shifts the IS curve to the left, the Fed must decrease the money 
supply to keep the interest rate at its original level. This fall in the money supply 
shifts the LM curve upward. The interest rate does not fall, but income falls by 
a larger amount than if the Fed had held the money supply constant. Whereas 
in panel (a) the lower interest rate stimulated investment and partially offset the 
contractionary effect of the tax hike, in panel ( b) the Fed deepens the recession 
by keeping the interest rate high.
In panel (c), the Fed wants to prevent the tax increase from lowering income. 
It must, therefore, raise the money supply and shift the LM curve downward 
enough to offset the shift in the IS curve. In this case, the tax increase does not 
cause a recession, but it does cause a large fall in the interest rate. Although the 
level of income is not changed, the combination of a tax increase and a monetary 
expansion does change the allocation of the economy’s resources. The higher 
taxes depress consumption, while the lower interest rate stimulates investment. 
Income is not affected because these two effects exactly balance.
From this example we can see that the impact of a change in fiscal policy 
depends on the policy the Fed pursues—that is, on whether it holds the 
money supply, the interest rate, or the level of income constant. More gener­
ally, ­whenever analyzing a change in one policy, we must make an assumption 
about its effect on the other policy. The most appropriate assumption depends 
on the case at hand and the many political considerations that lie behind eco­
nomic policymaking.
Shocks in the IS–LM Model
Because the IS–LM model shows how national income is determined in the 
short run, we can use the model to examine how various economic disturbances 
affect income. So far we have seen how changes in fiscal policy shift the IS curve 
and how changes in monetary policy shift the LM curve. Similarly, we can group 
other disturbances into two categories: shocks to the IS curve and shocks to the 
LM curve.
Shocks to the IS curve are exogenous changes in the demand for goods and 
services. Some economists, including Keynes, have emphasized that such changes 
in demand can arise from investors’ animal spirits—exogenous and ­perhaps

344 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
­self-fulfilling waves of optimism and pessimism. For example, suppose that firms 
become pessimistic about the future of the economy and that this pessimism 
causes them to build fewer new factories. This reduction in the demand for 
investment goods causes a contractionary shift in the investment function: at 
every interest rate, firms want to invest less. The fall in investment reduces planned 
expenditure and shifts the IS curve to the left, reducing income and employment. 
This fall in equilibrium income in part validates the firms’ initial pessimism.
Shocks to the IS curve may also arise from changes in the demand for con­
sumer goods. Suppose, for instance, that the election of a popular president 
increases consumer confidence in the economy. This induces consumers to save 
less for the future and consume more today. We can interpret this change as an 
upward shift in the consumption function. This shift in the consumption func­
tion increases planned expenditure and shifts the IS curve to the right, and this 
raises income.
Shocks to the LM curve arise from exogenous changes in the demand for 
money. For example, suppose that new restrictions on credit card availability 
increase the amount of money people choose to hold. According to the theory 
of liquidity preference, when money demand rises, the interest rate necessary to 
equilibrate the money market is higher (for any given level of income and money 
supply). Hence, an increase in money demand shifts the LM curve upward, which 
tends to raise the interest rate and depress income.
In summary, several kinds of events can cause economic fluctuations by shift­
ing the IS curve or the LM curve. Remember, however, that such fluctuations are 
not inevitable. Policymakers can try to use the tools of monetary and fiscal policy 
to offset exogenous shocks. If policymakers are sufficiently quick and skillful 
(admittedly, a big if), shocks to the IS or LM curves need not lead to fluctuations 
in income or employment.
The U.S. Recession of 2001
In 2001, the U.S. economy experienced a pronounced slowdown in economic 
activity. The unemployment rate rose from 3.9 percent in September 2000 to 
4.9 percent in August 2001, and then to 6.3 percent in June 2003. In many ways, 
the slowdown looked like a typical recession driven by a fall in aggregate demand.
Three notable shocks explain this event. The first was a decline in the stock 
market. During the 1990s, the stock market experienced a boom of historic 
proportions, as investors became optimistic about the prospects of the new 
information technology. Some economists viewed the optimism as excessive at 
the time, and in hindsight this proved to be the case. When the optimism faded, 
average stock prices fell by about 25 percent from August 2000 to August 2001. 
The fall in the market reduced household wealth and thus consumer spending. 
In addition, the declining perceptions of the profitability of the new technologies 
led to a fall in investment spending. In the language of the IS–LM model, the IS 
curve shifted to the left.
CASE STUDY

C H A P T E R  1 2   Aggregate Demand II: Applying the IS–LM Model  | 345
The second shock was the terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, 
DC, on September 11, 2001. In the week after the attacks, the stock market fell 
another 12 percent, which at the time was the biggest weekly loss since the Great 
Depression of the 1930s. Moreover, the attacks increased uncertainty about what 
the future would hold. Uncertainty can reduce spending because households and 
firms postpone some of their plans until the uncertainty is resolved. Thus, the 
terrorist attacks shifted the IS curve farther to the left.
The third shock was a series of accounting scandals at some of the nation’s 
most prominent corporations, including Enron and WorldCom. The result of 
these scandals was the bankruptcy of some companies that had fraudulently rep­
resented themselves as more profitable than they truly were, criminal convictions 
for the executives who had been responsible for the fraud, and new laws aimed at 
regulating corporate accounting standards more thoroughly. These events further 
depressed stock prices and discouraged business investment—a third leftward 
shift in the IS curve.
Fiscal and monetary policymakers responded quickly to these events. Congress 
passed a major tax cut in 2001, including an immediate tax rebate, and a second 
major tax cut in 2003. One goal of these tax cuts was to stimulate consumer 
spending. (See the Case Study on Cutting Taxes to Stimulate the Economy in 
Chapter 11.) In addition, after the terrorist attacks, Congress increased govern­
ment spending by appropriating funds to assist in New York’s recovery and to 
bail out the ailing airline industry. These fiscal measures shifted the IS curve to 
the right.
At the same time, the Federal Reserve pursued expansionary monetary policy, 
shifting the LM curve to the right. Money growth accelerated, and interest rates 
fell. The interest rate on three-month Treasury bills fell from 6.2 percent in 
November 2000 to 3.4 percent in August 2001, just before the terrorist attacks. 
After the attacks and corporate scandals hit the economy, the Fed increased its 
monetary stimulus, and the Treasury bill rate fell to 0.9 percent in July 2003—the 
lowest level in many decades.
Expansionary monetary and fiscal policy had the intended effects. Economic 
growth picked up in the second half of 2003 and was strong throughout 2004. 
By July 2005, the unemployment rate was back down to 5.0 percent, and it 
stayed at or below that level for the next several years. Unemployment would 
begin rising again in 2008, however, when the economy experienced another 
recession. The causes of the 2008 recession are examined in another Case Study 
later in this chapter. n
What Is the Fed’s Policy Instrument—The Money 
Supply or the Interest Rate?
Our analysis of monetary policy has been based on the assumption that the Fed 
influences the economy by controlling the money supply. By contrast, when the 
media report on changes in Fed policy, they often just say that the Fed has raised 
or lowered interest rates. Which is right? Even though these two views may seem 
different, both are correct, and it is important to understand why.

346 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
In recent years, the Fed has used the federal funds rate—the interest rate that 
banks charge one another for overnight loans—as its short-term policy instru­
ment. When the Federal Open Market Committee meets about every six weeks 
to set monetary policy, it votes on a target for this interest rate that will apply 
until the next meeting. After the meeting is over, the Fed’s bond traders (who are 
located in New York) are told to conduct the open-market operations necessary 
to hit that target. These open-market operations change the money supply and 
shift the LM curve so that the equilibrium interest rate (determined by the inter­
section of the IS and LM curves) equals the target interest rate that the Federal 
Open Market Committee has chosen.
As a result of this operating procedure, Fed policy is often discussed in terms 
of changing interest rates. Keep in mind, however, that behind these changes in 
interest rates are the necessary changes in the money supply. A newspaper might 
report, for instance, that “the Fed has lowered interest rates.” To be more precise, 
we can translate this statement as meaning “the Federal Open Market Commit­
tee has instructed the Fed bond traders to buy bonds in open-market operations 
so as to increase the money supply, shift the LM curve, and reduce the equilib­
rium interest rate to hit a new lower target.”
Why has the Fed chosen to use an interest rate, rather than the money supply, 
as its short-term policy instrument? One possible answer is that shocks to the 
LM curve are more prevalent than shocks to the IS curve. When the Fed targets 
interest rates, it automatically offsets LM shocks by adjusting the money supply, 
although this policy exacerbates IS shocks. If LM shocks are the more prevalent 
type, then a policy of targeting the interest rate leads to greater economic stability 
than a policy of targeting the money supply. (Problem 8 at the end of this chapter 
asks you to analyze this issue more fully.)
In Chapter 15 we extend our theory of short-run fluctuations to explicitly 
include a monetary policy that targets the interest rate and that changes its target 
in response to economic conditions. The IS–LM model presented here is a useful 
foundation for that more complicated and realistic analysis. One lesson from the 
IS–LM model is that when a central bank sets the money supply, it determines 
the equilibrium interest rate. Thus, in some ways, setting the money supply and 
setting the interest rate are two sides of the same coin.
12-2 	 IS–LM as a Theory of Aggregate 
Demand
We have been using the IS–LM model to explain national income in the short 
run when the price level is fixed. To see how the IS–LM model fits into the 
model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand introduced in Chapter 10, we 
now examine what happens in the IS–LM model if the price level is allowed 
to change. By examining the effects of changing the price level, we can finally 
deliver what was promised when we began our study of the IS–LM model: 
a theory to explain the position and slope of the aggregate demand curve.

C H A P T E R  1 2   Aggregate Demand II: Applying the IS–LM Model  | 347
From the IS–LM Model to the Aggregate Demand Curve
Recall from Chapter 10 that the aggregate demand curve describes a relation­
ship between the price level and the level of national income. In Chapter 10 this 
relationship was derived from the quantity theory of money. That analysis showed 
that for a given money supply, a higher price level implies a lower level of income. 
Increases in the money supply shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, and 
decreases in the money supply shift the aggregate demand curve to the left.
To understand the determinants of aggregate demand more fully, we now 
use the IS–LM model, rather than the quantity theory, to derive the aggregate 
demand curve. First, we use the IS–LM model to show why national income falls 
as the price level rises—that is, why the aggregate demand curve is downward 
sloping. Second, we examine what causes the aggregate demand curve to shift.
To explain why the aggregate demand curve slopes downward, we examine what 
happens in the IS–LM model when the price level changes. This is done in Figure 
12-5. For any given money supply M, a higher price level P reduces the supply of 
real money balances M/P. A lower supply of real money balances shifts the LM 
curve upward, which raises the equilibrium interest rate and lowers the equilibrium 
level of income, as shown in panel (a). Here the price level rises from P1 to P2, and 
income falls from Y1 to Y2. The aggregate demand curve in panel ( b) plots this 
negative relationship between national income and the price level. In other words, 
the aggregate demand curve shows the set of equilibrium points that arise in the 
IS–LM model as we vary the price level and see what happens to income.
Deriving the Aggregate Demand Curve with the IS–LM Model  Panel (a) shows the 
IS–LM model: an increase in the price level from P1 to P2 lowers real money balances and 
thus shifts the LM curve upward. The shift in the LM curve lowers income from Y1 to Y2. 
Panel (b) shows the aggregate demand curve summarizing this relationship between the 
price level and income: the higher the price level, the lower the level of income.

What causes the aggregate demand curve to shift? Because the aggregate 
demand curve summarizes the results from the IS–LM model, events that shift 
the IS curve or the LM curve (for a given price level) cause the aggregate 
demand curve to shift. For instance, an increase in the money supply raises 
income in the IS–LM model for any given price level; it thus shifts the aggre­
gate demand curve to the right, as shown in panel (a) of Figure 12-6. Similarly, 
an increase in government purchases or a decrease in taxes raises income in the 
FIGURE  12-6
How Monetary and Fiscal Policies Shift the Aggregate Demand Curve  Panel (a) shows 
a monetary expansion. For any given price level, an increase in the money supply raises real 
money balances, shifts the LM curve downward, and raises income. Hence, an increase in the 
money supply shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right. Panel (b) shows a fiscal expan­
sion, such as an increase in government purchases or a decrease in taxes. The fiscal expansion 
shifts the IS curve to the right and, for any given price level, raises income. Hence, a fiscal 
expansion shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right.

IS–LM model for a given price level; it also shifts the aggregate demand curve 
to the right, as shown in panel ( b) of Figure 12-6. Conversely, a decrease in the 
money supply, a decrease in government purchases, or an increase in taxes low­
ers income in the IS–LM model and shifts the aggregate demand curve to the 
left. Anything that changes income in the IS–LM model other than a change in 
the price level causes a shift in the aggregate demand curve. The factors shifting 
aggregate demand include not only monetary and fiscal policy but also shocks to 
the goods market (the IS curve) and shocks to the money market (the LM curve).
We can summarize these results as follows: A change in income in the IS–LM 
model resulting from a change in the price level represents a movement along the aggregate 
demand curve. A change in income in the IS–LM model for a given price level represents 
a shift in the aggregate demand curve.
The IS–LM Model in the Short Run and Long Run
The IS–LM model is designed to explain the economy in the short run when 
the price level is fixed. Yet, now that we have seen how a change in the price 
level influences the equilibrium in the IS–LM model, we can also use the model 
to describe the economy in the long run when the price level adjusts to ensure 
that the economy produces at its natural rate. By using the IS–LM model to 
describe the long run, we can show clearly how the Keynesian model of income 
determination differs from the classical model of Chapter 3.
Panel (a) of Figure 12-7 shows the three curves that are necessary for under­
standing the short-run and long-run equilibria: the IS curve, the LM curve, 
FIGURE  12-7
The Short-Run and Long-Run Equilibria  We can compare the short-run and long-run 
equilibria using either the IS–LM diagram in panel (a) or the aggregate supply–aggregate 
demand diagram in panel (b). In the short run, the price level is stuck at P1. The short-run 
equilibrium of the economy is therefore point K. In the long run, the price level adjusts so that 
the economy is at the natural level of output. The long-run equilibrium is therefore point C.

and the vertical line representing the natural level of output Y–. The LM curve 
is, as always, drawn for a fixed price level P1. The short-run equilibrium of the 
economy is point K, where the IS curve crosses the LM curve. Notice that in 
this short-run equilibrium, the economy’s income is less than its natural level.
Panel ( b) of Figure 12-7 shows the same situation in the diagram of aggregate 
supply and aggregate demand. At the price level P1, the quantity of output demanded 
is below the natural level. In other words, at the existing price level, there is insuffi­
cient demand for goods and services to keep the economy producing at its potential.
In these two diagrams we can examine the short-run equilibrium at which the 
economy finds itself and the long-run equilibrium toward which the economy 
gravitates. Point K describes the short-run equilibrium, because it assumes that the 
price level is stuck at P1. Eventually, the low demand for goods and services causes 
prices to fall, and the economy moves back toward its natural rate. When the price 
level reaches P2, the economy is at point C, the long-run equilibrium. The diagram 
of aggregate supply and aggregate demand shows that at point C, the quantity of 
goods and services demanded equals the natural level of output. This long-run equi­
librium is achieved in the IS–LM diagram by a shift in the LM curve: the fall in the 
price level raises real money balances and therefore shifts the LM curve to the right.
We can now see the key difference between the Keynesian and classical 
approaches to the determination of national income. The Keynesian assumption 
(represented by point K) is that the price level is stuck. Depending on monetary 
policy, fiscal policy, and the other determinants of aggregate demand, output may 
deviate from its natural level. The classical assumption (represented by point C) is 
that the price level is fully flexible. The price level adjusts to ensure that national 
income is always at its natural level.
To make the same point somewhat differently, we can think of the economy 
as being described by three equations. The first two are the IS and LM equations:
	
Y 5 C(Y 2 T ) 1 I(r) 1 G    IS,
	
M/P 5 L(r, Y )	
LM.
The IS equation describes the equilibrium in the goods market, and the LM 
equation describes the equilibrium in the money market. These two equations 
contain three endogenous variables: Y, P, and r. To complete the system, we need 
a third equation. The Keynesian approach completes the model with the assump­
tion of fixed prices, so the Keynesian third equation is
P 5 P1.
This assumption implies that the remaining two variables r and Y must adjust 
to satisfy the remaining two equations IS and LM. The classical approach com­
pletes the model with the assumption that output reaches its natural level, so the 
­classical third equation is
Y 5 Y–
This assumption implies that the remaining two variables r and P must adjust to 
satisfy the remaining two equations IS and LM. Thus, the classical approach fixes

output and allows the price level to adjust to satisfy the goods and money market 
equilibrium conditions, whereas the Keynesian approach fixes the price level and 
lets output move to satisfy the equilibrium conditions.
Which assumption is most appropriate? The answer depends on the time horizon. 
The classical assumption best describes the long run. Hence, our long-run analyses 
of national income in Chapter 3 and prices in Chapter 5 assume that output equals 
its natural level. The Keynesian assumption best describes the short run. Therefore, 
our analysis of economic fluctuations relies on the assumption of a fixed price level.
12-3 	 The Great Depression
Now that we have developed the model of aggregate demand, let’s use it to 
address the question that originally motivated Keynes: what caused the Great 
Depression? Even today, almost a century after the event, economists continue 
to debate the cause of this major economic downturn. The Great Depression 
provides an extended case study to show how economists use the IS–LM model 
to analyze economic fluctuations.1
Before turning to the explanations economists have proposed, look at Table 12-1, 
which presents some statistics regarding the Depression. These statistics are the 
battlefield on which debate about the Depression takes place. What do you think 
happened? An IS shift? An LM shift? Or something else?
The Spending Hypothesis: Shocks to the IS Curve
Table 12-1 shows that the decline in income in the early 1930s coincided with 
falling interest rates. This fact has led some economists to suggest that the cause 
of the decline may have been a contractionary shift in the IS curve. This view is 
sometimes called the spending hypothesis because it places primary blame for the 
Depression on an exogenous fall in spending on goods and services.
Economists have attempted to explain this decline in spending in several ways. 
Some argue that a downward shift in the consumption function caused the con­
tractionary shift in the IS curve. The stock market crash of 1929 may have been 
partly responsible for this shift: by reducing wealth and increasing uncertainty 
about the future prospects of the U.S. economy, the crash may have induced 
consumers to save more of their income rather than spend it.
Others explain the decline in spending by pointing to the large drop in invest­
ment in housing. Some economists believe that the residential investment boom 
of the 1920s was excessive and that once this “overbuilding” became apparent, 
1For a flavor of the debate, see Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz, A Monetary History of the 
United States, 1867–1960 (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1963); Peter Temin, Did 
Monetary Forces Cause the Great Depression? (New York: W. W. Norton, 1976); the essays in Karl 
Brunner, ed., The Great Depression Revisited ( Boston: Martinus Nijhoff, 1981); and the symposium 
on the Great Depression in the Spring 1993 issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives.

352 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
the demand for residential investment declined drastically. Another possible 
explanation for the fall in residential investment is the reduction in immigration 
in the 1930s: a more slowly growing population demands less new housing.
Once the Depression began, several events occurred that could have reduced 
spending further. First, many banks failed in the early 1930s, in part because of 
inadequate bank regulation, and these bank failures may have exacerbated the fall 
in investment spending. Banks play the crucial role of getting the funds available 
for investment to those households and firms that can best use them. The clos­
ing of many banks in the early 1930s may have prevented some businesses from 
getting the funds they needed for capital investment and, therefore, may have led 
to a further contraction in investment spending.2
The fiscal policy of the 1930s also contributed to the contractionary shift in the IS 
curve. Politicians at that time were more concerned with balancing the budget than 
with using fiscal policy to keep production and employment at their natural levels. 
The Revenue Act of 1932 increased various taxes, especially those falling on lower- 
and middle-income consumers.3 The Democratic platform of that year expressed 
concern about the budget deficit and advocated an “immediate and drastic ­reduction

of governmental expenditures.” In the midst of historically high unemployment, 
policymakers searched for ways to raise taxes and reduce government spending.
There are, therefore, several ways to explain a contractionary shift in the IS 
curve. Keep in mind that these different views may all be true. There may be 
no single explanation for the decline in spending. It is possible that all of these 
changes coincided and that together they led to a massive reduction in spending.
The Money Hypothesis: A Shock to the LM Curve
Table 12-1 shows that the money supply fell 25 percent from 1929 to 1933, during 
which time the unemployment rate rose from 3.2 percent to 25.2 percent. This 
fact provides the motivation and support for what is called the money hypothesis, 
which places primary blame for the Depression on the Federal Reserve for 
allowing the money supply to fall by such a large amount.4 The best-known 
advocates of this interpretation are Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, who 
defended it in their treatise on U.S. monetary history. Friedman and Schwartz 
argue that contractions in the money supply have caused most economic down­
turns and that the Great Depression is a particularly vivid example.

354 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
Using the IS–LM model, we might interpret the money hypothesis as explain­
ing the Depression by a contractionary shift in the LM curve. Seen in this way, 
however, the money hypothesis runs into two problems.
The first problem is the behavior of real money balances. Monetary policy 
leads to a contractionary shift in the LM curve only if real money balances fall. 
Yet from 1929 to 1931 real money balances rose slightly because the fall in 
the money supply was accompanied by an even greater fall in the price level. 
Although the monetary contraction may have been responsible for the rise in 
unemployment from 1931 to 1933, when real money balances did fall, it cannot 
easily explain the initial downturn from 1929 to 1931.
The second problem for the money hypothesis is the behavior of interest 
rates. If a contractionary shift in the LM curve triggered the Depression, we 
should have observed higher interest rates. Yet nominal interest rates fell con­
tinuously from 1929 to 1933.
These two reasons appear sufficient to reject the view that the Depression 
was instigated by a contractionary shift in the LM curve. But was the fall in 
the money stock irrelevant? Next, we turn to another mechanism through 
which monetary policy might have been responsible for the severity of the 
Depression—the deflation of the 1930s.
The Money Hypothesis Again: The Effects 
of Falling Prices
From 1929 to 1933 the price level fell 22 percent. Many economists blame this 
deflation for the severity of the Great Depression. They argue that the defla­
tion may have turned what in 1931 was a typical economic downturn into an 
unprecedented period of high unemployment and depressed income. If correct, 
this argument gives new life to the money hypothesis. Because the falling money 
supply was, plausibly, responsible for the falling price level, it could have been 
responsible for the severity of the Depression. To evaluate this argument, we must 
discuss how changes in the price level affect income in the IS–LM model.
The Stabilizing Effects of Deflation  In the IS–LM model we have devel­
oped so far, falling prices raise income. For any given supply of money M, a lower 
price level implies higher real money balances M/P. An increase in real money bal­
ances causes an expansionary shift in the LM curve, which leads to higher income.
Another channel through which falling prices expand income is called the 
Pigou effect. Arthur Pigou, a prominent classical economist in the 1930s, 
pointed out that real money balances are part of households’ wealth. As prices fall 
and real money balances rise, consumers should feel wealthier and spend more. 
This increase in consumer spending should cause an expansionary shift in the IS  
curve, also leading to higher income.
These two reasons led some economists in the 1930s to believe that falling 
prices would help stabilize the economy. That is, they thought that a decline in 
the price level would automatically push the economy back toward full employ­
ment. Yet other economists were less confident in the economy’s ability to cor­
rect itself. They pointed to other effects of falling prices, to which we now turn.

C H A P T E R  1 2   Aggregate Demand II: Applying the IS–LM Model  | 355
The Destabilizing Effects of Deflation  Economists have proposed two 
theories to explain how falling prices could depress income rather than raise it. 
The first, called the debt-deflation theory, describes the effects of unexpected 
falls in the price level. The second explains the effects of expected deflation.
The debt-deflation theory begins with an observation from Chapter 5: unan­
ticipated changes in the price level redistribute wealth between debtors and 
creditors. If a debtor owes a creditor $1,000, then the real amount of this debt is 
$1,000/P, where P is the price level. A fall in the price level raises the real amount 
of this debt—the amount of purchasing power the debtor must repay the creditor. 
Therefore, an unexpected deflation enriches creditors and impoverishes debtors.
The debt-deflation theory then posits that this redistribution of wealth affects 
spending on goods and services. In response to the redistribution from debtors to 
creditors, debtors spend less and creditors spend more. If these two groups have 
equal spending propensities, there is no aggregate impact. But it seems reasonable 
to assume that debtors have higher propensities to spend than creditors—perhaps 
that is why the debtors are in debt in the first place. In this case, debtors reduce 
their spending by more than creditors raise theirs. The net effect is a reduction 
in spending, a contractionary shift in the IS curve, and lower national income.
To understand how expected changes in prices can affect income, we need 
to add a new variable to the IS–LM model. Our discussion of the model so far 
has not distinguished between the nominal and real interest rates. Yet we know 
from previous chapters that investment depends on the real interest rate and that 
money demand depends on the nominal interest rate. If i is the nominal interest 
rate and Ep is expected inflation, then the ex ante real interest rate is i 2 Ep. 
We can now write the IS–LM model as
Y 5 C(Y 2 T ) 1 I(i 2 Ep) 1 G        IS,
	
M/P 5 L(i, Y )	
LM.
Expected inflation enters as a variable in the IS curve. Thus, changes in expected 
inflation shift the IS curve.
Let’s use this extended IS–LM model to examine how changes in expected 
inflation influence the level of income. We begin by assuming that everyone 
expects the price level to remain the same. In this case, there is no expected 
inflation (Ep 5 0), and these two equations produce the familiar IS–LM model. 
Figure 12-8 depicts this initial situation with the LM curve and the IS curve 
labeled IS1. The intersection of these two curves determines the nominal and real 
interest rates, which for now are the same.
Now suppose that everyone suddenly expects that the price level will fall in 
the future, so that Ep becomes negative. The real interest rate is now higher at any 
given nominal interest rate. This increase in the real interest rate depresses planned 
investment spending, shifting the IS curve from IS1 to IS2. (The vertical distance 
of the downward shift exactly equals the expected deflation.) Thus, an expected 
deflation leads to a reduction in national income from Y1 to Y2. The nominal 
interest rate falls from i1 to i2, while the real interest rate rises from r1 to r2.
Here is the story behind this figure. When firms come to expect deflation, 
they become reluctant to borrow to buy investment goods because they believe 

356 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
they will have to repay these loans later in more valuable dollars. The fall in 
investment depresses planned expenditure, which in turn depresses income. The 
fall in income reduces the demand for money, and this reduces the nominal 
interest rate that equilibrates the money market. The nominal interest rate falls 
by less than the expected deflation, so the real interest rate rises.
Note that there is a common thread in these two stories of destabilizing defla­
tion. In both, falling prices depress national income by causing a contractionary 
shift in the IS curve. Because a deflation of the size observed from 1929 to 1933 
is unlikely except in the presence of a major contraction in the money supply, 
these two explanations assign some of the responsibility for the Depression—
especially its severity—to the Fed. In other words, if falling prices are destabiliz­
ing, then a contraction in the money supply can lead to a fall in income, even 
without a decrease in real money balances or a rise in nominal interest rates.
Could the Depression Happen Again?
Economists study the Depression both because of its intrinsic interest as a major 
economic event and to provide guidance to policymakers so that it will not 
happen again. To state with confidence whether this event could recur, we 
would need to know why it happened. Because there is not yet agreement on 
the causes of the Great Depression, it is impossible to rule out with certainty 
another depression of this magnitude.
Yet most economists believe that the mistakes that led to the Great Depres­
sion are unlikely to be repeated. The Fed seems unlikely to allow the money 
supply to fall by one-fourth. Many economists believe that the deflation of the 
early 1930s was responsible for the depth and length of the Depression. And it 
seems likely that such a prolonged deflation was possible only in the presence of 
a falling money supply.
Expected Deflation in the 
IS–LM Model  An expected defla­
tion (a negative value of Ep) raises 
the real interest rate for any given 
nominal interest rate, and this 
depresses investment spending. 
The reduction in investment shifts 
the IS curve downward. The level 
of income falls from Y1 to Y2. The 
nominal interest rate falls from 
i1 to i2, and the real interest rate 
rises from r1 to r2.

The fiscal-policy mistakes of the Depression are also unlikely to be repeated. 
Fiscal policy in the 1930s not only failed to help but actually further depressed 
aggregate demand. Few economists today would advocate such a rigid adher­
ence to a balanced budget in the face of massive unemployment.
In addition, there are many institutions today that would help prevent the 
events of the 1930s from recurring. The system of federal deposit insurance 
makes widespread bank failures less likely. The income tax causes an automatic 
reduction in taxes when income falls, which stabilizes the economy. Finally, 
economists know more today than they did in the 1930s. Our knowledge of 
how the economy works, limited as it still is, should help policymakers formulate 
better policies to combat such widespread unemployment.
CASE STUDY
The Financial Crisis and Great Recession 
of 2008 and 2009
In 2008 the U.S. economy experienced a financial crisis, followed by a deep 
economic downturn. Several of the developments during this time were 
reminiscent of events during the 1930s, causing many observers to fear that the 
economy might experience a second Great Depression.
The story of the 2008 crisis begins a few years earlier with a substantial boom 
in the housing market. The boom had several sources. In part, it was fueled by 
low interest rates. As we saw in a previous Case Study in this chapter, the Federal 
Reserve lowered interest rates to historically low levels in the aftermath of the 
recession of 2001. Low interest rates helped the economy recover, but by making 
it less expensive to get a mortgage and buy a home, they also contributed to a 
rise in housing prices.
In addition, developments in the mortgage market made it easier for subprime 
borrowers—those borrowers with higher risk of default based on their income 
and credit history—to get mortgages to buy homes. One of these developments 
was securitization, the process by which one mortgage originator makes loans and 
then sells them to an investment bank, which in turn bundles them together into 
a variety of “mortgage-backed securities” and then sells them to a third financial 
institution (such as a bank, pension fund, or insurance company). These securi­
ties pay a return as long as homeowners continue to repay their loans, but they 
lose value if homeowners default. Unfortunately, it seems that the ultimate hold­
ers of these mortgage-backed securities sometimes failed to fully appreciate the 
risks they were taking. Some economists blame insufficient regulation for these 
high-risk loans. Others believe the problem was not too little regulation but 
the wrong kind: some government policies encouraged this high-risk lending 
to make the goal of homeownership more attainable for low-income families.
Together, these forces drove up housing demand and housing prices. From 
1995 to 2006, average housing prices in the United States more than doubled. 
Some observers view this rise in housing prices as a speculative bubble, as more 
people bought homes, hoping and expecting that the prices would continue 
to rise.

358 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
The high price of housing, however, proved unsustainable. From 2006 to 
2009, housing prices nationwide fell about 30 percent. Such price fluctuations 
should not necessarily be a problem in a market economy. After all, price move­
ments are how markets equilibrate supply and demand. But, in this case, the price 
decline led to a series of problematic repercussions.
The first of these repercussions was a substantial rise in mortgage defaults and 
home foreclosures. During the housing boom, many homeowners had bought 
their homes with mostly borrowed money and minimal down payments. When 
housing prices declined, these homeowners were underwater: they owed more on 
their mortgages than their homes were worth. Many of these homeowners stopped 
paying their loans. The banks servicing the mortgages responded to the defaults by 
taking the houses away in foreclosure procedures and then selling them off. The 
banks’ goal was to recoup whatever they could. The increase in the number of 
homes for sale, however, exacerbated the downward spiral of housing prices.
A second repercussion was large losses at the various financial institutions that 
owned mortgage-backed securities. In essence, by borrowing large sums to buy high-
risk mortgages, these companies had bet that housing prices would keep rising; when 
this bet turned bad, they found themselves at or near the point of bankruptcy. Even 
healthy banks stopped trusting one another and avoided interbank lending because 
it was hard to discern which institution would be the next to go out of business. 
Because of these large losses at financial institutions and the widespread fear and dis­
trust, the ability of the financial system to make loans even to creditworthy customers 
was impaired. Chapter 20 discusses financial crises, including this one, in more detail.
A third repercussion was a substantial rise in stock market volatility. Many 
companies rely on the financial system to get the resources they need for busi­
ness expansion or to help them manage their short-term cash flows. With the 
financial system less able to perform its normal operations, the profitability of 
many companies was called into question. Because it was hard to know how bad 
things would get, stock market volatility reached levels not seen since the 1930s.
Falling housing prices, increasing foreclosures, financial instability, and higher 
volatility together led to a fourth repercussion: a decline in consumer confi­
dence. In the midst of all the uncertainty, households started putting off spend­
ing plans. In particular, expenditure on durable goods such as cars and household 
appliances plummeted.
As a result of all these events, the economy experienced a large contraction­
ary shift in the IS curve. Production, income, and employment declined. The 
unemployment rate rose from 4.7 percent in October 2007 to 10.0 percent in 
October 2009.
Policymakers responded vigorously as the crisis unfolded. First, the Fed cut its 
target for the federal funds rate from 5.25 percent in September 2007 to about zero 
in December 2008. Second, in October 2008, Congress appropriated $700 billion 
for the Treasury to use to rescue the financial system. In large part these funds were 
used for equity injections into banks. That is, the Treasury put funds into the bank­
ing system, which the banks could use to make loans; in exchange for these funds, 
the U.S. government became a part owner of these banks, at least temporarily. Third, 
as discussed in Chapter 11, one of Barack Obama’s first acts when he became presi­
dent in January 2009 was to support a major increase in government spending to 

C H A P T E R  1 2   Aggregate Demand II: Applying the IS–LM Model  | 359
expand aggregate demand. Finally, the Federal Reserve engaged in various uncon­
ventional monetary policies, such as buying long-term bonds, to lower long-term 
interest rates and thereby encourage borrowing and private spending.
In the end, policymakers can take some credit for having averted another 
Great Depression. Unemployment rose to only 10 percent, compared with 
25 percent in 1933. Other data tell a similar story. Figure 12-9 compares the 
path of industrial production during the Great Depression of the 1930s and 
during the Great Recession of 2008–2009. (Industrial production measures the 
output of the nation’s manufacturers, mines, and utilities. Because of the con­
sistency of its data sources, it is one of the more reliable time series for histori­
cal comparisons of short-run fluctuations.) The figure shows that, in the Great 
Depression, industrial production declined for about three years, falling by more 
than 50 percent, and it took more than seven years to return to its previous peak. 
By contrast, in the Great Recession, industrial production declined for only a 
year and half, falling only 17 percent, and it took less than six years to recover.
This comparison, however, gives only limited comfort. Even though the Great 
Recession of 2008–2009 was shorter and less severe than the Great Depression, 
it was nonetheless a devastating event for many families. n

The Liquidity Trap (Also Known as the 
Zero Lower Bound)
In the United States in the 1930s, interest rates reached very low levels. As 
Table  12-1 shows, U.S. interest rates were well under 1 percent throughout 
the second half of the 1930s. A similar situation occurred during the economic 
downturn of 2008–2009. In December 2008, the Federal Reserve cut its target 
for the federal funds rate to the range of zero to 0.25 percent, and it kept the rate 
at that level at least until this book was going to press in early 2015.
Some economists describe this situation as a liquidity trap. According to 
the IS–LM model, expansionary monetary policy works by reducing interest 
rates and stimulating investment spending. But if interest rates have already fallen 
almost to zero, then perhaps monetary policy is no longer effective. Nominal 
interest rates cannot fall below zero: rather than making a loan at a negative 
nominal interest rate, a person would just hold cash. In this environment, expan­
sionary monetary policy increases the supply of money, making the public’s asset 
portfolio more liquid, but because interest rates can’t fall any farther, the extra 
liquidity might not have any effect. Aggregate demand, production, and employ­
ment may be “trapped” at low levels. The liquidity trap is sometimes called the 
problem of the zero lower bound.
Other economists are skeptical about the relevance of liquidity traps and 
believe that central banks continue to have tools to expand the economy, even 
after the interest rate target hits the lower bound of zero. One possibility is that a 
central bank could try to lower longer-term interest rates. It can accomplish this 
by committing to keep the target interest rate (typically a very short-term inter­
est rate) low for an extended period of time. A policy of announcing future mon­
etary actions is sometimes called forward guidance. A central bank can also lower 
longer-term interest rates by conducting expansionary open-market operations 
in a larger variety of financial instruments than it normally does. For example, 
it could buy long-term government bonds, mortgages, and corporate debt and 
thereby lower the interest rates on these kinds of loans, a policy sometimes called 
quantitative easing. During the downturn of 2008–2009 and its aftermath, the 
Federal Reserve actively pursued a policy of forward guidance and quantitative 
easing.
Another way that monetary expansion can expand the economy despite the 
zero lower bound is that it could cause the currency to lose value in the market 
for foreign-currency exchange. This depreciation would make the nation’s goods 
cheaper abroad, stimulating export demand. This mechanism goes beyond the 
closed-economy IS–LM model we have used in this chapter, but it fits well with 
the open-economy version of the model developed in the next chapter.
Some economists have argued that the possibility of a liquidity trap argues for 
a target rate of inflation greater than zero. Under zero inflation, the real interest 
rate, like the nominal interest, can never fall below zero. But if the normal rate of 
inflation is, say, 4 percent, then the central bank can easily push the real interest 
rate to negative 4 percent by lowering the nominal interest rate toward zero. Put 
differently, a higher target for the inflation rate means a higher nominal interest 
rate in normal times (recall the Fisher effect), which in turn gives the central

bank more room to cut interest rates when the economy experiences recession­
ary shocks. Thus, a higher inflation target gives monetary policymakers more 
room to stimulate the economy when needed, reducing the likelihood that the 
economy will hit the zero lower bound and fall into a liquidity trap.5
 12-4	 Conclusion
The purpose of this chapter and the previous one has been to deepen our under­
standing of aggregate demand. We now have the tools to analyze the effects of 
monetary and fiscal policy in the long run and in the short run. In the long run, 
prices are flexible, and we use the classical analysis of Parts Two and Three of 
this book. In the short run, prices are sticky, and we use the IS–LM model to 
examine how changes in policy influence the economy.
The model in this and the previous chapter provides the basic framework 
for analyzing the economy in the short run, but it is not the whole story. 
In Chapter 13 we examine how international interactions affect the theory of 
aggregate demand. In Chapter 14 we examine the theory behind short-run 
aggregate supply. Subsequent chapters further refine the theory and examine 
various issues that arise as the theory is applied to formulate macroeconomic 
policy. The IS–LM model presented in this and the previous chapter provides the 
starting point for this further analysis.
Summary
	1.	The IS–LM model is a general theory of the aggregate demand for goods 
and services. The exogenous variables in the model are fiscal policy, 
monetary policy, and the price level. The model explains two endogenous 
variables: the interest rate and the level of national income.
	2.	The IS curve represents the negative relationship between the interest 
rate and the level of income that arises from equilibrium in the market 
for goods and services. The LM curve represents the positive relationship 
between the interest rate and the level of income that arises from equi­
librium in the market for real money balances. Equilibrium in the IS–LM 
model—the intersection of the IS and LM curves—represents simultaneous

equilibrium in the market for goods and services and in the market for real 
money balances.
	3.	The aggregate demand curve summarizes the results from the IS–LM 
model by showing equilibrium income at any given price level. The aggre­
gate demand curve slopes downward because a lower price level increases 
real money balances, lowers the interest rate, stimulates investment spending, 
and thereby raises equilibrium income.
	4.	Expansionary fiscal policy—an increase in government purchases or a 
decrease in taxes—shifts the IS curve to the right. This shift in the IS curve 
increases the interest rate and income. The increase in income represents 
a rightward shift in the aggregate demand curve. Similarly, contractionary 
fiscal policy shifts the IS curve to the left, lowers the interest rate and 
income, and shifts the aggregate demand curve to the left.
	5.	Expansionary monetary policy shifts the LM curve downward. This shift 
in the LM curve lowers the interest rate and raises income. The increase in 
income represents a rightward shift of the aggregate demand curve. Similarly, 
contractionary monetary policy shifts the LM curve upward, raises the inter­
est rate, lowers income, and shifts the aggregate demand curve to the left.

The Open Economy Revisited:
The Mundell–Fleming Model
and the Exchange-Rate Regime
The world is still a closed economy, but its regions and countries are ­becoming 
increasingly open. . . . The international economic climate has changed in 
the direction of financial integration, and this has important implications for 
­economic policy.
—Robert Mundell, 1963
W
hen conducting monetary and fiscal policy, policymakers often 
look beyond their own country’s borders. Even if domestic pros­
perity is their sole objective, it is necessary for them to consider 
the rest of the world. The international flow of goods and services and the inter­
national flow of capital can affect an economy in profound ways. Policymakers 
ignore these effects at their peril.
In this chapter, we extend our analysis of aggregate demand to include 
­international trade and finance. The model developed in this chapter, called 
the Mundell–Fleming model, has been described as “the dominant policy 
­paradigm for studying open-economy monetary and fiscal policy.” In 1999, 
Robert Mundell was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work in open-economy 
macroeconomics, including this model.1
The Mundell–Fleming model is a close relative of the IS–LM model. 
Both models stress the interaction between the goods market and the money 
­market. Both models assume that the price level is fixed and then show what 
causes ­short-run fluctuations in aggregate income (or, equivalently, shifts in the

Macroeconomics (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1996)—a leading graduate-level textbook in open-­

Mundell’s contributions are collected in Robert A. Mundell, International Economics (New York:

­aggregate demand curve). The key difference is that the IS–LM model assumes 
a closed economy, whereas the Mundell–Fleming model assumes an open 
economy. The Mundell–Fleming model extends the short-run model of national 
income from Chapters 11 and 12 by including the effects of international trade 
and finance discussed in Chapter 6.
The Mundell–Fleming model makes one important and extreme assumption: 
It assumes that the economy being studied is a small open economy with perfect 
capital mobility. That is, the economy can borrow or lend as much as it wants in 
world financial markets and, as a result, the economy’s interest rate is determined 
by the world interest rate. Here is how Mundell himself, in his original 1963 
article, explained why he made this assumption:
In order to present my conclusions in the simplest possible way and to bring 
the implications for policy into sharpest relief, I assume the extreme degree of 
mobility that prevails when a country cannot maintain an interest rate different 
from the general level prevailing abroad. This assumption will overstate the case 
but it has the merit of posing a stereotype towards which international ­financial 
relations seem to be heading. At the same time it might be argued that the 
assumption is not far from the truth in those financial centers, of which Zurich, 
Amsterdam, and Brussels may be taken as examples, where the authorities 
already recognize their lessening ability to dominate money market conditions 
and insulate them from foreign influences. It should also have a high degree of 
relevance to a country like Canada whose financial markets are dominated to a 
great degree by the vast New York market.
As we will see, Mundell’s assumption of a small open economy with perfect capi­
tal mobility will prove useful in developing a tractable and illuminating model.2
One lesson from the Mundell–Fleming model is that the behavior of an 
­economy depends on the exchange-rate system it has adopted. Indeed, the model 
was first developed in large part to understand how alternative exchange-rate 
regimes work and how the choice of exchange-rate regime affects the use of 
monetary and fiscal policy. We begin by assuming that the economy operates 
with a floating exchange rate. That is, we assume that the central bank allows 
the exchange rate to adjust to changing economic conditions. We then examine 
how the economy operates under a fixed exchange rate. After developing the 
model, we will be in a position to address an important policy question: What 
exchange-rate system should a nation adopt?
These issues of open-economy macroeconomics have been very much in the 
news in recent years. As various European nations, most notably Greece, experi­
enced severe financial difficulties, many observers wondered whether it was wise 
for much of the continent to adopt a common currency—the most extreme 
form of a fixed exchange rate. If each nation had its own currency, monetary 
2This assumption—and thus the Mundell–Fleming model—does not apply exactly to a large open 
economy such as that of the United States. In the conclusion to this chapter (and more fully in 
the appendix), we consider what happens in the more complex case in which international capital 
mobility is less than perfect or a nation is so large that it can influence world financial markets.

C H A P T E R  1 3   The Open Economy Revisited: The Mundell–Fleming Model and the Exchange-Rate Regime  | 369
policy and the exchange rate could have adjusted more easily to the changing 
individual circumstances and needs of each nation. Meanwhile, many American 
policymakers, including Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, were 
objecting that China did not allow the value of its currency to float freely 
against the U.S. dollar. They argued that China kept its currency artificially 
cheap, ­making its goods more competitive on world markets. As we will see, the 
­Mundell–Fleming model offers a useful starting point for understanding and 
evaluating these often heated international policy debates.
13-1 	 The Mundell–Fleming Model
In this section, we construct the Mundell–Fleming model; and in the following 
sections, we use the model to examine the impact of various policies. As you 
will see, the Mundell–Fleming model is built from components we have used in 
previous chapters. But these pieces are put together in a new way to address a 
new set of questions.
The Key Assumption: Small Open Economy With 
Perfect Capital Mobility
Let’s begin with the assumption of a small open economy with perfect capital 
mobility. As we saw in Chapter 6, this assumption means that the interest rate in 
this economy r is determined by the world interest rate r*. Mathematically, we 
write this assumption as
r 5 r*.
This world interest rate is assumed to be exogenously fixed because the economy 
is sufficiently small relative to the world economy that it can borrow or lend 
as much as it wants in world financial markets without affecting the world 
­interest rate.
Although the idea of perfect capital mobility is expressed with a simple 
­equation, it is important not to lose sight of the sophisticated process that this 
equation represents. Imagine that some event occurred that would normally raise 
the interest rate (such as a decline in domestic saving). In a small open economy, 
the domestic interest rate might rise by a little bit for a short time, but as soon 
as it did, foreigners would see the higher interest rate and start lending to this 
country (by, for instance, buying this country’s bonds). The capital inflow would 
drive the domestic interest rate back toward r*. Similarly, if any event started to 
drive the domestic interest rate downward, capital would flow out of the country 
to earn a higher return abroad, and this capital outflow would drive the domestic 
interest rate back up to r*. Hence, the r 5 r * equation represents the assump­
tion that the international flow of capital is rapid enough to keep the domestic 
­interest rate equal to the world interest rate.

370 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
The Goods Market and the IS* Curve
The Mundell–Fleming model describes the market for goods and services much 
as the IS–LM model does, but it adds a new term for net exports. In particular, 
the goods market is represented with the following equation:
Y 5 C (Y 2 T ) 1 I (r) 1 G 1 NX (e).
This equation states that aggregate income Y is the sum of consumption C, 
investment I, government purchases G, and net exports NX. Consumption 
depends positively on disposable income Y 2 T. Investment depends negatively 
on the interest rate. Net exports depend negatively on the exchange rate e. 
As before, we define the exchange rate e as the amount of foreign currency per 
unit of domestic currency—for example, e might be 100 yen per dollar.
You may recall that in Chapter 6 we related net exports to the real exchange rate 
(the relative price of goods at home and abroad) rather than the nominal exchange 
rate (the relative price of domestic and foreign currencies). If e is the nominal 
exchange rate, then the real exchange rate e equals eP/P*, where P is the domestic 
price level and P* is the foreign price level. The Mundell–Fleming model, however, 
assumes that the price levels at home and abroad are fixed, so the real exchange 
rate is proportional to the nominal exchange rate. That is, when the domestic cur­
rency appreciates and the nominal exchange rate rises (from, say, 100 to 120 yen 
per dollar), the real exchange rate rises as well; thus, foreign goods become cheaper 
compared to domestic goods, and this causes exports to fall and imports to rise.
The goods market equilibrium condition above has two financial variables that 
affect expenditure on goods and services (the interest rate and the exchange rate), but 
we can simplify matters by using the assumption of perfect capital mobility, r 5 r *:
Y 5 C (Y 2 T ) 1 I (r*) 1 G 1 NX (e).
Let’s call this the IS* equation. (The asterisk reminds us that the equation holds 
the interest rate constant at the world interest rate r*.) We can illustrate this equa­
tion on a graph in which income is on the horizontal axis and the exchange rate 
is on the vertical axis. This curve is shown in panel (c) of Figure 13-1.
The IS* curve slopes downward because a higher exchange rate reduces net 
exports, which in turn lowers aggregate income. To show how this works, the 
other panels of Figure 13-1 combine the net-exports schedule and the Keynesian 
cross to derive the IS* curve. In panel (a), an increase in the exchange rate from 
e1 to e2 lowers net exports from NX (e1) to NX (e2). In panel (b), the reduction in 
net exports shifts the planned-expenditure schedule downward and thus lowers 
income from Y1 to Y2. The IS* curve summarizes this relationship between the 
exchange rate e and income Y.
The Money Market and the LM* Curve
The Mundell–Fleming model represents the money market with an equation 
that should be familiar from the IS–LM model:
M/P 5 L (r, Y ).

C H A P T E R  1 3   The Open Economy Revisited: The Mundell–Fleming Model and the Exchange-Rate Regime  | 371
This equation states that the supply of real money balances M/P equals the demand 
L (r, Y). The demand for real balances depends negatively on the interest rate and 
positively on income. The money supply M is an exogenous ­variable controlled by 
the central bank, and because the Mundell–Fleming model is designed to analyze 
short-run fluctuations, the price level P is also assumed to be exogenously fixed.
Once again, we add the assumption that the domestic interest rate equals the 
world interest rate, so r 5 r*:
M/P 5 L (r*, Y ).
Let’s call this the LM* equation. We can represent it graphically with a verti­
cal line, as in panel (b) of Figure 13-2. The LM* curve is vertical because the 
exchange rate does not enter into the LM* equation. Given the world inter­
est rate, the LM* equation determines aggregate income, regardless of the 
exchange rate. Figure 13-2 shows how the LM* curve arises from the world 
interest rate and the LM curve, which relates the interest rate and income.

Putting the Pieces Together
According to the Mundell–Fleming model, a small open economy with perfect

The first equation describes equilibrium in the goods market; the second

Figure 13-3 illustrates these two relationships. The equilibrium for the econo­
my is found where the IS* curve and the LM* curve intersect. This intersection 
shows the exchange rate and the level of income at which the goods market and 
the money market are both in equilibrium. With this diagram, we can use the 
Mundell–Fleming model to show how aggregate income Y and the exchange 
rate e respond to changes in policy.
13-2 	 The Small Open Economy Under 
Floating Exchange Rates
Before analyzing the impact of policies in an open economy, we must specify the 
international monetary system in which the country has chosen to operate. That 
is, we must consider how people engaged in international trade and finance can 
convert the currency of one country into the currency of another.
We start with the system relevant for most major economies today: ­floating 
exchange rates. Under a system of floating exchange rates, the exchange 
rate is set by market forces and is allowed to fluctuate in response to changing 
­economic conditions. In this case, the exchange rate e adjusts to achieve simulta­
neous equilibrium in the goods market and the money market. When something 
happens to change that equilibrium, the exchange rate is allowed to move to a 
new equilibrium value.
Let’s now consider three policies that can change the equilibrium: fiscal policy, 
monetary policy, and trade policy. Our goal is to use the Mundell–Fleming 
model to show the effects of policy changes and to understand the economic 
forces at work as the economy moves from one equilibrium to another.

and the exchange rate that 
satisfy equilibrium both in 
the goods market and in the 
money market.

Fiscal Policy
Suppose that the government stimulates domestic spending by increasing 
government purchases or by cutting taxes. Because such expansionary fiscal 
policy increases planned expenditure, it shifts the IS* curve to the right, as in 
Figure 13-4. As a result, the exchange rate appreciates, while the level of income 
remains the same.
Notice that fiscal policy has very different effects in a small open economy 
than it does in a closed economy. In the closed-economy IS–LM model, a ­fiscal 
expansion raises income, whereas in a small open economy with a floating 
exchange rate, a fiscal expansion leaves income at the same level. Mechanically, 
the difference arises because the LM* curve is vertical, while the LM curve we 
used to study a closed economy is upward sloping. But this explanation is not 
very satisfying. What are the economic forces that lie behind the different out­
comes? To answer this question, we must think through what is happening to 
the international flow of capital and the implications of these capital flows for 
the domestic economy.
The interest rate and the exchange rate are the key variables in the story. When 
income rises in a closed economy, the interest rate rises because higher income 
increases the demand for money. That is not possible in a small open economy 
because, as soon as the interest rate starts to rise above the world interest rate 
r*, capital quickly flows in from abroad to take advantage of the higher return. 
As this capital inflow pushes the interest rate back to r*, it also has another effect: 
because foreign investors need to buy the domestic currency to invest in the 
domestic economy, the capital inflow increases the demand for the domestic cur­
rency in the market for foreign-currency exchange, bidding up the value of the 
domestic currency. The appreciation of the domestic currency makes domestic

goods more expensive relative to foreign goods, reducing net exports. The fall in 
net exports exactly offsets the effects of the expansionary fiscal policy on income.
Why is the fall in net exports so great that it renders fiscal policy powerless to 
influence income? To answer this question, consider the equation that describes 
the money market:
M/P 5 L (r, Y ).
In both closed and open economies, the quantity of real money balances sup­
plied M/P is fixed by the central bank (which sets M ) and the assumption of 
sticky prices (which fixes P ). The quantity demanded (determined by r and Y ) 
must equal this fixed supply. In a closed economy, a fiscal expansion causes the 
equilibrium interest rate to rise. This increase in the interest rate (which reduces 
the quantity of money demanded) is accompanied by an increase in equilib­
rium income (which raises the quantity of money demanded); these two effects 
together maintain equilibrium in the money market. By contrast, in a small open 
economy, r is fixed at r*, so there is only one level of income that can satisfy this 
equation, and this level of income does not change when fiscal policy changes. 
Thus, when the government increases spending or cuts taxes, the appreciation of 
the currency and the fall in net exports must be large enough to fully offset the 
expansionary effect of the policy on income.
Monetary Policy
Suppose now that the central bank increases the money supply. Because the price 
level is assumed to be fixed, the increase in the money supply means an increase 
in real money balances. The increase in real balances shifts the LM* curve to the 
right, as in Figure 13-5. Hence, an increase in the money supply raises income 
and lowers the exchange rate.

376 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
Although monetary policy influences income in an open economy, as it does 
in a closed economy, the monetary transmission mechanism is different. Recall 
that in a closed economy an increase in the money supply increases spending 
because it lowers the interest rate and stimulates investment. In a small open 
economy, this channel of monetary transmission is not available because the 
interest rate is fixed by the world interest rate. So how does monetary policy 
influence spending? To answer this question, we once again need to think about 
the international flow of capital and its implications for the domestic economy.
The interest rate and the exchange rate are again the key variables. As soon 
as an increase in the money supply starts putting downward pressure on the 
domestic interest rate, capital flows out of the economy because investors seek a 
higher return elsewhere. This capital outflow prevents the domestic interest rate 
from falling below the world interest rate r*. It also has another effect: because 
investing abroad requires converting domestic currency into foreign currency, 
the capital outflow increases the supply of the domestic currency in the market 
for foreign-currency exchange, causing the domestic currency to depreciate in 
value. This depreciation makes domestic goods less expensive relative to foreign 
goods, stimulating net exports and thus total income. Hence, in a small open 
economy, monetary policy influences income by altering the exchange rate 
rather than the interest rate.
Trade Policy
Suppose that the government reduces the demand for imported goods by impos­
ing an import quota or a tariff. What happens to aggregate income and the 
exchange rate? How does the economy reach its new equilibrium?
Because net exports equal exports minus imports, a reduction in imports 
means an increase in net exports. That is, the net-exports schedule shifts to the 
right, as in Figure 13-6. This shift in the net-exports schedule increases planned 
expenditure and thus moves the IS* curve to the right. Because the LM* curve is 
vertical, the trade restriction raises the exchange rate but does not affect income.
The economic forces behind this transition are similar to the case of expan­
sionary fiscal policy. Because net exports are a component of GDP, the rightward 
shift in the net-exports schedule, other things equal, puts upward pressure on 
income Y; an increase in Y, in turn, increases money demand and puts upward 
pressure on the interest rate r. Foreign capital quickly responds by flowing into 
the domestic economy, pushing the interest rate back to the world interest rate r* 
and causing the domestic currency to appreciate in value. Finally, the apprecia­
tion of the currency makes domestic goods more expensive relative to foreign 
goods, which decreases net exports NX and returns income Y to its initial level.
Restrictive trade policies often have the goal of changing the trade balance 
NX. Yet, as we first saw in Chapter 6, such policies do not necessarily have that 
effect. The same conclusion holds in the Mundell–Fleming model under floating 
exchange rates. Recall that
NX (e) 5 Y 2 C (Y 2 T ) 2 I (r*) 2 G.

C H A P T E R  1 3   The Open Economy Revisited: The Mundell–Fleming Model and the Exchange-Rate Regime  | 377
Because a trade restriction does not affect income, consumption, investment, or 
government purchases, it does not affect the trade balance. Although the shift 
in the net-exports schedule tends to raise NX, the increase in the exchange 
rate reduces NX by the same amount. The overall effect is simply less trade. The 
domestic economy imports less than it did before the trade restriction, but it 
exports less as well.
13-3 	 The Small Open Economy Under Fixed 
Exchange Rates
We now turn to the second type of exchange-rate system: fixed exchange 
rates. Under a fixed exchange rate, the central bank announces a value for the 
exchange rate and stands ready to buy and sell the domestic currency to keep 
the exchange rate at its announced level. This type of system has been used in 
many historical periods. From 1944 to 1971, most of the world’s major econo­
mies, including that of the United States, operated within the Bretton Woods 
­system—an international monetary system under which most governments 
agreed to fix exchange rates. From 1995 to 2005, China fixed the value of its 
currency against the U.S. dollar—a policy that, as we will see, was a source of 
some tension between the two countries.
In this section we discuss how such a system works, and we examine the 
impact of economic policies on an economy with a fixed exchange rate. Later in 
the chapter we examine the pros and cons of fixed exchange rates.

How a Fixed-Exchange-Rate System Works
Under a system of fixed exchange rates, a central bank stands ready to buy or 
sell the domestic currency for foreign currencies at a predetermined price. For 
example, suppose the Fed announced that it was going to fix the yen/dollar 
exchange rate at 100 yen per dollar. It would then stand ready to give $1 in 
exchange for 100 yen or to give 100 yen in exchange for $1. To carry out this 
policy, the Fed would need a reserve of dollars (which it can print) and a reserve 
of yen (which it must have purchased previously).
A fixed exchange rate dedicates a country’s monetary policy to the single 
goal of keeping the exchange rate at the announced level. In other words, the 
essence of a fixed-exchange-rate system is the commitment of the central bank 
to allow the money supply to adjust to whatever level will ensure that the equi­
librium exchange rate in the market for foreign-currency exchange equals the 
announced exchange rate. Moreover, as long as the central bank stands ready to 
buy or sell foreign currency at the fixed exchange rate, the money supply adjusts 
automatically to the necessary level.
To see how fixing the exchange rate determines the money supply, consider 
the following example. Suppose the Fed decides to fix the exchange rate at 
100 yen per dollar, but, in the current equilibrium with the current money 
supply, the market exchange rate is 150 yen per dollar. This situation is illus­
trated in panel (a) of Figure 13-7. Notice that there is a profit opportunity: an 
arbitrageur could buy 300 yen in the foreign-exchange market for $2 and then 
sell the yen to the Fed for $3, making a $1 profit. When the Fed buys these 
yen from the arbitrageur, the dollars it pays for them automatically increase 
the money supply. The rise in the money supply shifts the LM* curve to the 
right, lowering the equilibrium exchange rate. In this way, the money supply 
continues to rise until the equilibrium exchange rate falls to the level the Fed 
has announced.
Conversely, suppose that when the Fed decides to fix the exchange rate at 
100 yen per dollar, the equilibrium has a market exchange rate of 50 yen per 
dollar. Panel (b) of Figure 13-7 shows this situation. In this case, an arbitrageur 
could make a profit by buying 100 yen from the Fed for $1 and then selling the 
yen in the marketplace for $2. When the Fed sells these yen, the $1 it receives 
automatically reduces the money supply. The fall in the money supply shifts the 
LM* curve to the left, raising the equilibrium exchange rate. The money supply 
continues to fall until the equilibrium exchange rate rises to the announced level.
It is important to understand that this exchange-rate system fixes the nominal 
exchange rate. Whether it also fixes the real exchange rate depends on the time 
horizon under consideration. If prices are flexible, as they are in the long run, 
then the real exchange rate can change even while the nominal exchange rate 
is fixed. Therefore, in the long run described in Chapter 6, a policy to fix the 
nominal exchange rate would not influence any real variable, including the real 
exchange rate. A fixed nominal exchange rate would influence only the money 
supply and the price level. Yet in the short run described by the Mundell–Flem­
ing model, prices are fixed, so a fixed nominal exchange rate implies a fixed real 
exchange rate as well.

How a Fixed Exchange Rate Governs the Money Supply  In panel (a), the equilib­

in foreign-exchange markets and sell it to the Fed for a profit. This process automatically 
increases the money supply, shifting the LM* curve to the right and lowering the 
exchange rate. In panel (b), the equilibrium exchange rate is initially below the fixed 
level. Arbitrageurs will buy foreign currency from the Fed and sell it in foreign-exchange 
markets for a profit. This process automatically reduces the money supply, shifting the 
LM* curve to the left and raising the exchange rate.
FIGURE  13-7
The International Gold Standard
During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, most of the world’s 
major economies operated under the gold standard. Each country maintained a 
reserve of gold and agreed to exchange one unit of its currency for a specified 
amount of gold. Through the gold standard, the world’s economies maintained a 
system of fixed exchange rates.
To see how an international gold standard fixes exchange rates, suppose 
that the U.S. Treasury stands ready to buy or sell 1 ounce of gold for $100, 
and the Bank of England stands ready to buy or sell 1 ounce of gold for 
100 pounds. Together, these policies fix the rate of exchange between dol­
lars and pounds: $1 must trade for 1 pound. Otherwise, the law of one price 
would be violated, and it would be profitable to buy gold in one country and 
sell it in the other.
For example, suppose that the market exchange rate is 2 pounds per dollar. 
In this case, an arbitrageur could buy 200 pounds for $100, use the pounds to 
buy 2 ounces of gold from the Bank of England, bring the gold to the United 
States, and sell it to the Treasury for $200—making a $100 profit. Moreover, 
by bringing the gold to the United States from England, the arbitrageur would

increase the money supply in the United States and decrease the money supply 
in England.
Thus, during the era of the gold standard, the international transport of 
gold by arbitrageurs was an automatic mechanism adjusting the money supply 
and stabilizing exchange rates. This system did not completely fix exchange 
rates, because shipping gold across the Atlantic was costly. Yet the interna­
tional gold standard did keep the exchange rate within a range dictated by 
transportation costs. It thereby prevented large and persistent movements in 
exchange rates.3 n

Standard in Theory and History (New York: Methuen, 1985).
Fiscal Policy
Let’s now examine how economic policies affect a small open economy with a 
fixed exchange rate. Suppose that the government stimulates domestic spending 
by increasing government purchases or by cutting taxes. This policy shifts the 
IS* curve to the right, as in Figure 13-8, putting upward pressure on the market 
exchange rate. But because the central bank stands ready to trade foreign and 
domestic currency at the fixed exchange rate, arbitrageurs quickly respond to the 
rising exchange rate by selling foreign currency to the central bank, leading to

Rates  A fiscal expansion

must increase the money 
supply, thereby shifting 
the LM* curve to the right. 
Hence, in contrast to the 
case of floating exchange 
rates, under fixed exchange 
rates a fiscal expansion 
raises income.

C H A P T E R  1 3   The Open Economy Revisited: The Mundell–Fleming Model and the Exchange-Rate Regime  | 381
an automatic monetary expansion. The rise in the money supply shifts the LM* 
curve to the right. Thus, under a fixed exchange rate, a fiscal expansion raises 
aggregate income.
Monetary Policy
Imagine that a central bank operating with a fixed exchange rate tries to 
increase the money supply—for example, by buying bonds from the public. 
What would happen? The initial impact of this policy is to shift the LM* 
curve to the right, lowering the exchange rate, as in Figure 13-9. But, because 
the central bank is committed to trading foreign and domestic currency at 
a fixed exchange rate, arbitrageurs quickly respond to the falling exchange 
rate by selling the domestic currency to the central bank, causing the money 
supply and the LM* curve to return to their initial positions. Hence, mon­
etary policy as usually conducted is ineffectual under a fixed exchange rate. 
By agreeing to fix the exchange rate, the central bank gives up its control over 
the money supply.
A country with a fixed exchange rate can, however, conduct a type of mon­
etary policy: it can decide to change the level at which the exchange rate is fixed. 
A reduction in the official value of the currency is called a devaluation, and 
an increase in its official value is called a revaluation. In the Mundell–Fleming 
model, a devaluation shifts the LM* curve to the right; it acts like an increase 
in the money supply under a floating exchange rate. A devaluation thus expands 
net exports and raises aggregate income. Conversely, a revaluation shifts the LM* 
curve to the left, reduces net exports, and lowers aggregate income.
FIGURE  13-9

Fed tries to increase the money 
supply—for example, by buying

supply and the LM* curve must 
return to their ­initial positions. 
Hence, under fixed exchange 
rates, normal ­monetary policy 
is ineffectual.

Trade Policy
Suppose that the government reduces imports by imposing an import quota or a 
tariff. This policy shifts the net-exports schedule to the right and thus shifts the 
IS* curve to the right, as in Figure 13-10. The shift in the IS* curve tends to 
raise the exchange rate. To keep the exchange rate at the fixed level, the money 
supply must rise, shifting the LM* curve to the right.
The result of a trade restriction under a fixed exchange rate is very different 
from that under a floating exchange rate. In both cases, a trade restriction shifts 
the net-exports schedule to the right, but only under a fixed exchange rate does 
Devaluation and the Recovery from the 
Great Depression
The Great Depression of the 1930s was a global problem. Although events in 
the United States may have precipitated the downturn, all of the world’s major 
economies experienced huge declines in production and employment. Yet not 
all governments responded to this calamity in the same way.
One key difference among governments was how committed they were to 
the fixed exchange rate set by the international gold standard. Some countries, 
such as France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, maintained the old rate 
of exchange between gold and currency. Other countries, such as Denmark, 
Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, reduced the amount of gold 
they would pay for each unit of currency by about 50 percent. By reducing the 
gold content of their currencies, these governments devalued their currencies 
relative to those of other countries.
The subsequent experience of these two groups of countries confirms the 
prediction of the Mundell–Fleming model. Those countries that pursued a 
policy of devaluation recovered quickly from the Depression. The lower value 
of the currency raised the money supply, stimulated exports, and expanded 
production. By contrast, those countries that maintained the old exchange rate 
suffered longer with a depressed level of economic activity.
What about the United States? President Herbert Hoover kept the United 
States on the gold standard, but in a controversial move, President Franklin 
Roosevelt took the nation off it in June 1933, just three months after taking 
office. That date roughly coincides with the end of the deflation and the begin­
ning of recovery. Many economic historians believe that removing the nation 
from the gold standard was the most significant policy action that President 
Roosevelt took to end the Great Depression.4 n

a trade restriction increase net exports NX. The reason is that a trade restriction 
under a fixed exchange rate induces monetary expansion rather than an appreci­
ation of the currency. The monetary expansion, in turn, raises aggregate income. 
Recall the accounting identity
NX 5 S 2 I.
When income rises, saving also rises, and this implies an increase in net exports.
Policy in the Mundell–Fleming Model: A Summary
The Mundell–Fleming model shows that the effect of almost any economic 
policy on a small open economy depends on whether the exchange rate is float­
ing or fixed. Table 13-1 summarizes our analysis of the short-run effects of fiscal, 
monetary, and trade policies on income, the exchange rate, and the trade balance. 
What is most striking is that all of the results are different under floating and 
fixed exchange rates.
To be more specific, the Mundell–Fleming model shows that the power 
of monetary and fiscal policy to influence aggregate income depends on the 
exchange-rate regime. Under floating exchange rates, only monetary policy can 
affect income. The usual expansionary impact of fiscal policy is offset by a rise in 
the value of the currency and a decrease in net exports. Under fixed exchange 
rates, only fiscal policy can affect income. The normal potency of monetary 
policy is lost because the money supply is dedicated to maintaining the exchange 
rate at the announced level.

13-4 	 Interest Rate Differentials
So far, our analysis has assumed that the interest rate in a small open economy 
is equal to the world interest rate: r 5 r*. To some extent, however, interest rates 
differ around the world. We now extend our analysis by considering the causes 
and effects of international interest rate differentials.
Country Risk and Exchange-Rate Expectations
When we assumed earlier that the interest rate in our small open economy is 
determined by the world interest rate, we were applying the law of one price. 
We reasoned that if the domestic interest rate was above the world interest rate, 
people from abroad would lend to that country, driving the domestic inter­
est rate down. And if the domestic interest rate was below the world interest 
rate, domestic residents would lend abroad to earn a higher return, driving the 
domestic interest rate up. In the end, the domestic interest rate would equal the 
world interest rate.
Why doesn’t this logic always apply? There are two reasons.
One reason is country risk. When investors buy U.S. government bonds or 
make loans to U.S. corporations, they are fairly confident that they will be repaid 
with interest. By contrast, in some less-developed countries, it is plausible to 
fear that a revolution or other political upheaval might lead to a default on loan 
repayments. Borrowers in such countries often have to pay higher interest rates 
to compensate lenders for this risk.
Another reason interest rates differ across countries is expected changes in the 
exchange rate. For example, suppose that people expect the Mexican peso to 

C H A P T E R  1 3   The Open Economy Revisited: The Mundell–Fleming Model and the Exchange-Rate Regime  | 385
fall in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Then loans made in pesos will be repaid 
in a less valuable currency than loans made in dollars. To compensate for this 
expected fall in the Mexican currency, the interest rate in Mexico will be higher 
than the interest rate in the United States.
Thus, because of country risk and expectations about future exchange-rate 
changes, the interest rate of a small open economy can differ from interest 
rates in other economies around the world. Let’s see how this fact affects our 
analysis.
Differentials in the Mundell–Fleming Model
Consider again the Mundell–Fleming model with a floating exchange rate. To 
incorporate interest rate differentials into the model, we assume that the interest 
rate in our small open economy is determined by the world interest rate plus a 
risk premium u:
r 5 r* 1 u.
The risk premium is determined by the perceived political risk of making loans 
in a country and the expected change in the real exchange rate. For our pur­
poses here, we can take the risk premium as exogenous in order to examine how 
changes in the risk premium affect the economy.
The model is largely the same as before. The two equations are
Y 5 C (Y 2 T) 1 I (r* 1 u) 1 G 1 NX (e)	
IS*,
M/P 5 L (r* 1 u, Y)	
LM*.
For any given fiscal policy, monetary policy, price level, and risk premium, 
these two equations determine the level of income and exchange rate that 
equilibrate the goods market and the money market. Holding constant the 
risk premium, the tools of monetary, fiscal, and trade policy work as we have 
already seen.
Now suppose that political turmoil causes the country’s risk premium u to 
rise. Because r 5 r* 1 u, the most direct effect is that the domestic interest 
rate r rises. The higher interest rate, in turn, has two effects. First, the IS* curve 
shifts to the left because the higher interest rate reduces investment. Second, 
the LM* curve shifts to the right because the higher interest rate reduces the 
demand for money, which in turn implies a higher level of income for any given 
money supply. [Recall that Y must satisfy the equation M/P 5 L (r* 1 u, Y ).] 
As Figure 13-11 shows, these two shifts cause income to rise and the currency 
to depreciate.
This analysis has an important implication: expectations about the exchange 
rate are partially self-fulfilling. For example, suppose that for some reason people 
reduce their expectations of the future value of the Mexican peso. Investors 
will place a larger risk premium on Mexican assets: u will rise in Mexico. This 
expectation will drive up Mexican interest rates and, as we have just seen, will 

386 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
drive down the value of the Mexican currency. Thus, the expectation that a currency 
will lose value in the future causes it to lose value today.
One surprising—and perhaps inaccurate—prediction of this analysis is that an 
increase in country risk as measured by u will cause the economy’s income to 
increase. This occurs in Figure 13-11 because of the rightward shift in the LM* 
curve. Although higher interest rates depress investment, the depreciation of the 
currency stimulates net exports by an even greater amount. As a result, aggregate 
income rises.
There are three reasons why, in practice, such a boom in income does not 
occur. First, the central bank might want to avoid the large depreciation of 
the domestic currency and, therefore, may respond by decreasing the money 
supply M. Second, the depreciation of the domestic currency may suddenly 
increase the price of imported goods, causing an increase in the price level P. 
Third, when some event increases the country risk premium u, residents of 
the country might respond to the same event by increasing their demand for 
money (for any given income and interest rate) because money is often the 
safest asset available. All three of these changes would tend to shift the LM* 
curve toward the left, which mitigates the fall in the exchange rate but also 
tends to depress income.
Thus, increases in country risk are not desirable. In the short run, they 
typically lead to a depreciating currency and, through the three channels just 
described, falling aggregate income. In addition, because a higher interest rate 
reduces investment, the long-run implication is reduced capital accumulation 
and lower economic growth.

International Financial Crisis: Mexico 1994–1995
In August 1994, a Mexican peso was worth 30 cents. A year later, it was worth 
only 16 cents. What explains this massive fall in the value of the Mexican 
currency? Country risk is a large part of the story.
At the beginning of 1994, Mexico was a country on the rise. The recent 
passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which 
reduced trade barriers among the United States, Canada, and Mexico, made 
many people confident about the future of the Mexican economy. Investors 
around the world were eager to make loans to the Mexican government and to 
Mexican corporations.
Political developments soon changed that perception. A violent uprising in 
the Chiapas region of Mexico made the political situation in Mexico seem 
precarious. Then Luis Donaldo Colosio, the leading presidential candidate, was 
assassinated. The political future looked less certain, and many investors started 
placing a larger risk premium on Mexican assets.
At first, the rising risk premium did not affect the value of the peso because 
Mexico was operating with a fixed exchange rate. As we have seen, under a fixed 
exchange rate, the central bank agrees to trade the domestic currency (pesos) for 
a foreign currency (dollars) at a predetermined rate. Thus, when an increase in 
the country risk premium put downward pressure on the value of the peso, the 
Mexican central bank had to accept pesos and pay out dollars. This automatic 
exchange-market intervention contracted the Mexican money supply (shifting 
the LM* curve to the left) when the currency might otherwise have depreciated.
Yet Mexico’s foreign-currency reserves were too small to maintain its fixed 
exchange rate. When Mexico ran out of dollars at the end of 1994, the Mexican 
government announced a devaluation of the peso. This decision had repercus­
sions, however, because the government had repeatedly promised that it would 
not devalue. Investors became even more distrustful of Mexican policymakers 
and feared further Mexican devaluations.
Investors around the world (including those in Mexico) avoided buying 
Mexican assets. The country risk premium rose once again, adding to the upward 
pressure on interest rates and the downward pressure on the peso. The Mexican 
stock market plummeted. When the Mexican government needed to roll over 
some of its debt that was coming due, investors were unwilling to buy the new 
debt. Default appeared to be the government’s only option. In just a few months, 
Mexico had gone from being a promising emerging economy to being a risky 
economy with a government on the verge of bankruptcy.
Then the United States stepped in. The U.S. government had three motives: 
to help its neighbor to the south, to prevent the massive illegal immigration 
that might follow government default and economic collapse, and to prevent 
the investor pessimism regarding Mexico from spreading to other developing 
countries. The U.S. government, together with the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF), led an international effort to bail out the Mexican government. In partic­
ular, the United States provided loan guarantees for Mexican government debt, 
CASE STUDY

388 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
which allowed the Mexican government to refinance the debt that was coming 
due. These loan guarantees helped restore confidence in the Mexican economy, 
thereby reducing to some extent the country risk premium.
Although the U.S. loan guarantees may well have stopped a bad situation from 
getting worse, they did not prevent the Mexican meltdown of 1994–1995 from 
being a painful experience for the Mexican people. Not only did the Mexican 
currency lose much of its value, but Mexico also went through a deep reces­
sion. Fortunately, by the late 1990s, the worst was over, and aggregate income 
was growing again. But the lesson from this experience is clear and could well 
apply again in the future: changes in perceived country risk, often attributable to 
political instability, are an important determinant of interest rates and exchange 
rates in small open economies. n
International Financial Crisis: Asia 1997–1998
In 1997, as the Mexican economy was recovering from its financial crisis, a similar 
story started to unfold in several Asian economies, including those of Thailand, 
South Korea, and especially Indonesia. The symptoms were familiar: high interest 
rates, falling asset values, and a depreciating currency. In Indonesia, for instance, 
short-term nominal interest rates rose above 50 percent, the stock market lost 
about 90 percent of its value (measured in U.S. dollars), and the rupiah fell against 
the dollar by more than 80 percent. The crisis led to rising inflation in these 
countries (because the depreciating currency made imports more expensive) and 
to falling GDP (because high interest rates and reduced confidence depressed 
spending). Real GDP in Indonesia fell about 13 percent in 1998, making the 
downturn larger than any U.S. recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
What sparked this firestorm? The problem began in the Asian banking systems. 
For many years, the governments in the Asian nations had been more involved 
in managing the allocation of resources—in particular, financial resources—than 
is true in the United States and other developed countries. Some commentators 
had applauded this “partnership” between government and private enterprise 
and had even suggested that the United States should follow the example. Over 
time, however, it became clear that many Asian banks had been extending loans 
to those with the most political clout rather than to those with the most profit­
able investment projects. Once rising default rates started to expose this “crony 
capitalism,” as it was then called, international investors started to lose confidence 
in the future of these economies. The risk premiums for Asian assets rose, causing 
interest rates to skyrocket and currencies to collapse.
International crises of confidence often involve a vicious circle that can 
amplify the problem. Here is a brief account about what happened in Asia:
	1.	Problems in the banking system eroded international confidence in these 
economies.
	2.	Loss of confidence raised risk premiums and interest rates.
CASE STUDY

C H A P T E R  1 3   The Open Economy Revisited: The Mundell–Fleming Model and the Exchange-Rate Regime  | 389
	3.	Rising interest rates, together with the loss of confidence, depressed the 
prices of stock and other assets.
	4.	Falling asset prices reduced the value of collateral being used for bank loans.
	5.	Reduced collateral increased default rates on bank loans.
	6.	Greater defaults exacerbated problems in the banking system. Now return 
to step 1 to complete and continue the circle.
Some economists have used this vicious-circle argument to suggest that the 
Asian crisis was a self-fulfilling prophecy: bad things happened merely because 
people expected bad things to happen. Most economists, however, thought the 
political corruption of the banking system was a real problem, which was then 
compounded by this vicious circle of reduced confidence.
Exacerbating the situation was a currency mismatch between the assets and liabili­
ties of financial institutions. Banks in these emerging economies had a tendency 
to borrow from abroad in foreign currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, and make 
loans to residents of their own countries in their domestic currencies, such as the 
rupiah. As a result, they had assets denominated in the domestic currency but 
liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. When the domestic currency depre­
ciated in value on foreign-exchange markets, the value of the banks’ assets fell 
relative to their liabilities, making the problems of the banking system even worse.
As the Asian crisis developed, the IMF and the United States tried to restore 
confidence, much as they had with Mexico a few years earlier. In particular, 
the IMF made loans to the Asian countries to help them through the crisis; in 
exchange for these loans, it exacted promises that the governments would reform 
their banking systems and eliminate crony capitalism. The IMF’s hope was that 
the short-term loans and longer-term reforms would restore confidence, lower 
the risk premium, and turn the vicious circle into a virtuous one. This policy 
seems to have worked: the Asian economies recovered quickly from their crisis. n
13-5 	 Should Exchange Rates Be Floating 
or Fixed?
Having analyzed how an economy works under floating and fixed exchange 
rates, let’s consider which exchange-rate regime is better.
Pros and Cons of Different Exchange-Rate Systems
The primary argument for a floating exchange rate is that it allows a nation to 
use its monetary policy for other purposes. Under fixed rates, monetary policy is 
committed to the single goal of maintaining the exchange rate at its announced 
level. Yet the exchange rate is only one of many macroeconomic variables that 
monetary policy can influence. A system of floating exchange rates leaves ­monetary 
policymakers free to pursue other goals, such as stabilizing employment or prices.

390 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
Advocates of fixed exchange rates 
argue that exchange-rate uncertainty 
makes international trade more diffi­
cult. After the world abandoned the 
Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange 
rates in the early 1970s, both real and 
nominal exchange rates became (and 
have remained) much more volatile than 
anyone had expected. Some econo­
mists attribute this volatility to irrational 
and destabilizing speculation by inter­
national investors. Business executives 
often claim that this volatility is harm­
ful because it increases the uncertainty 
that accompanies international business 
transactions. Despite this exchange-rate 
volatility, however, the amount of world 
trade has continued to rise under floating 
exchange rates.
Advocates of fixed exchange rates 
sometimes argue that a commitment to a 
fixed exchange rate is one way to discipline a nation’s monetary authority and 
prevent excessive growth in the money supply. Yet there are many other policy 
rules to which the central bank could be committed. In Chapter 18, for instance, 
we discuss policy rules such as targets for nominal GDP or the inflation rate. 
Fixing the exchange rate has the advantage of being simpler to implement than 
these other policy rules because the money supply adjusts automatically, but this 
policy may lead to greater volatility in income and employment.
In practice, the choice between floating and fixed rates is not as stark as it may 
seem at first. Under systems of fixed exchange rates, countries can change the 
value of their currency if maintaining the exchange rate conflicts too severely 
with other goals. Under systems of floating exchange rates, countries often use 
formal or informal targets for the exchange rate when deciding whether to 
expand or contract the money supply. We rarely observe exchange rates that are 
completely fixed or completely floating. Instead, under both systems, stability 
of the exchange rate is usually one among many objectives of the central bank.
The Debate Over the Euro
If you have ever driven the 3,000 miles from New York City to San Francisco, 
you may recall that you never needed to change your money from one form 
of currency to another. In all 50 U.S. states, local residents are happy to accept 
the U.S. dollar for the items you buy. Such a monetary union is the most extreme 
form of a fixed exchange rate. The exchange rate between New York dollars and

San Francisco dollars is so irrevocably fixed that you may not even know that 
there is a difference between the two. (What’s the difference? Each dollar bill is 
issued by one of the dozen local Federal Reserve Banks. Although the bank of 
origin can be identified from the bill’s markings, you don’t care which type of 
dollar you hold because everyone else, including the Federal Reserve system, is 
ready to trade any dollar from one bank for a dollar from another.)
If you made a similar 3,000-mile trip across Europe during the 1990s, 
however, your experience was very different. You didn’t have to travel far before 
needing to exchange your French francs for German marks, Dutch guilders, 
Spanish pesetas, or Italian lira. The large number of currencies in Europe made 
traveling less convenient and more expensive. Every time you crossed a border, 
you had to wait in line at a bank to get the local money, and you had to pay the 
bank a fee for the service.
Today, however, the situation in Europe is more like that in the United States. 
Many European countries have given up having their own currencies and have 
formed a monetary union that uses a common currency called the euro. As a 
result, the exchange rate between France and Germany is now as fixed as the 
exchange rate between New York and California.
The introduction of a common currency has its costs. The most important is 
that the nations of Europe are no longer able to conduct their own monetary 
policies. Instead, the European Central Bank, with the participation of all mem­
ber countries, sets a single monetary policy for all of Europe. The central banks 
of the individual countries play a role similar to that of regional Federal Reserve 
Banks: they monitor local conditions but they have no control over the money 
supply or interest rates. Critics of the move toward a common currency argue 
that the cost of losing national monetary policy is large. When a recession hits 
one country but not others in Europe, that country does not have the tool of 
monetary policy to combat the downturn. This argument is one reason some 
European nations, such as the United Kingdom and Sweden, have chosen not to 
give up their own currency in favor of the euro.
An example of this phenomenon occurred recently. From 2008 to 2013, sev­
eral of the economies of southern Europe experienced pronounced economic 
downturns. The unemployment rate rose from 6.7 to 12.2 percent in Italy, 8.5 
to 16.5 percent in Portugal, 11.3 to 26.1 percent in Spain, and 7.7 to 27.3 per­
cent in Greece. By contrast, in Germany, the largest country using the euro, the 
unemployment rate fell from 7.5 to 5.3 percent during this period. Critics of 
the euro contend that if these southern European nations had their own cur­
rencies, rather than being part of the euro area with Germany, they could have 
more aggressively pursued expansionary monetary policy. A more expansionary 
monetary policy would have weakened their currencies and made their exports 
less expensive on world markets; the increase in net exports would have helped 
maintain aggregate demand and soften the recession.
Why, according to the euro critics, is monetary union a bad idea for Europe 
if it works so well in the United States? These economists argue that the United 
States is different from Europe in two important ways. First, labor is more mobile 
among U.S. states than among European countries. This is in part because the 

392 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
United States has a common language and in part because most Americans are 
descended from immigrants, who have shown a willingness to move. Therefore, 
when a regional recession occurs, U.S. workers are more likely to move from 
high-unemployment states to low-unemployment states. Second, the United 
States has a strong central government that can use fiscal policy—such as the 
federal income tax—to redistribute resources among regions. Because Europe 
does not have these two advantages, it bears a larger cost when it restricts itself 
to a single monetary policy.
Advocates of a common currency believe that the loss of national mon­
etary policy is more than offset by other gains. With a single currency in all of 
Europe, travelers and businesses no longer need to worry about exchange rates, 
and this encourages more international trade. In addition, a common currency 
may have the political advantage of making Europeans feel more connected 
to one another. The twentieth century was marked by two world wars, both 
of which were sparked by European discord. If a common currency makes 
the nations of Europe more harmonious, euro advocates argue, it benefits the 
entire world. n
Speculative Attacks, Currency Boards, and 
Dollarization
Imagine that you are a central banker of a small country. You and your fellow 
policymakers decide to fix your currency—let’s call it the peso—against the U.S. 
dollar. From now on, one peso will sell for one dollar.
As we discussed earlier, you now have to stand ready to buy and sell pesos for a 
dollar each. The money supply will adjust automatically to make the equilibrium 
exchange rate equal your target. There is, however, one potential problem with 
this plan: you might run out of dollars. If people come to the central bank to sell 
large quantities of pesos, the central bank’s dollar reserves might dwindle to zero. 
In this case, the central bank has no choice but to abandon the fixed exchange 
rate and let the peso depreciate.
This fact raises the possibility of a speculative attack—a change in investors’ per­
ceptions that makes the fixed exchange rate untenable. Suppose that, for no good 
reason, a rumor spreads that the central bank is going to abandon the exchange-
rate peg. People would respond by rushing to the central bank to convert pesos 
into dollars before the pesos lose value. This rush would drain the central bank’s 
reserves and could force the central bank to abandon the peg. In this case, the 
rumor would prove self-fulfilling.
To avoid this possibility, some economists argue that a fixed exchange rate 
should be supported by a currency board, such as that used by Argentina in the 
1990s. A currency board is an arrangement by which the central bank holds 
enough foreign currency to back each unit of the domestic currency. In our 
example, the central bank would hold one U.S. dollar (or one dollar invested 
in a U.S. government bond) for every peso. No matter how many pesos turned 
up at the central bank to be exchanged, the central bank would never run 
out of dollars.

C H A P T E R  1 3   The Open Economy Revisited: The Mundell–Fleming Model and the Exchange-Rate Regime  | 393
Once a central bank has adopted a currency board, it might consider the natu­
ral next step: it can abandon the peso altogether and let its country use the U.S. 
dollar. Such a plan is called dollarization. It happens on its own in high-inflation 
economies, where foreign currencies offer a more reliable store of value than the 
domestic currency. But it can also occur as a matter of public policy, as in Panama. 
If a country really wants its currency to be irrevocably fixed to the dollar, the 
most reliable method is to make its currency the dollar. The only loss from dol­
larization is the seigniorage revenue that a government gives up by relinquishing 
its control over the printing press. The U.S. government then gets the revenue 
that is generated by growth in the money supply.5
The Impossible Trinity
The analysis of exchange-rate regimes leads to a simple conclusion: you can’t 
have it all. To be more precise, it is impossible for a nation to have free capital 
flows, a fixed exchange rate, and independent monetary policy. This fact, often 
called the impossible trinity (or sometimes the trilemma of international finance), 
is illustrated in Figure 13-12. A nation must choose one side of this triangle, 
giving up the institutional feature at the opposite corner.
The first option is to allow free flows of capital and to conduct an indepen­
dent monetary policy, as the United States has done in recent years. In this case, 
it is impossible to have a fixed exchange rate. Instead, the exchange rate must 
float to equilibrate the market for foreign-currency exchange.
5Dollarization may also lead to a loss in national pride from seeing American portraits on the cur­
rency. If it wanted, the U.S. government could fix this problem by leaving blank the center space 
that now has portraits of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and others. Each nation using U.S. 
currency could insert the faces of its own local heroes.

rate, and independent monetary 
policy. A nation must choose one

opposite corner.

394 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
The second option is to allow free flows of capital and to fix the exchange 
rate, as Hong Kong has done in recent years. In this case, the nation loses the abil­
ity to conduct an independent monetary policy. The money supply must adjust 
to keep the exchange rate at its predetermined level. In a sense, when a nation 
fixes its currency to that of another nation, it is adopting that other nation’s 
monetary policy.
The third option is to restrict the international flow of capital in and out of 
the country, as China has done in recent years. In this case, the interest rate is no 
longer fixed by world interest rates but is determined by domestic forces, much 
as is the case in a completely closed economy. It is then possible to both fix the 
exchange rate and conduct an independent monetary policy.
History has shown that nations can, and do, choose different sides of the 
trinity. Every nation must ask itself the following question: Does it want to live 
with exchange-rate volatility (option 1), does it want to give up the use of mon­
etary policy for purposes of domestic stabilization (option 2), or does it want to 
restrict its citizens from participating in world financial markets (option 3)? The 
impossible trinity says that no nation can avoid making one of these choices.
The Chinese Currency Controversy
From 1995 to 2005 the Chinese currency, the yuan, was pegged to the dollar 
at an exchange rate of 8.28 yuan per U.S. dollar. In other words, the Chinese 
central bank stood ready to buy and sell yuan at this price. This policy of fixing 
the exchange rate was combined with a policy of restricting international capital 
flows. Chinese citizens were not allowed to convert their savings into dollars or 
euros and invest abroad.
By the early 2000s, many observers believed that the yuan was significantly 
undervalued. They suggested that if the yuan were allowed to float, it would 
increase in value relative to the dollar. The evidence in favor of this hypothesis 
was that China was accumulating large dollar reserves in its efforts to maintain 
the fixed exchange rate. That is, the Chinese central bank had to supply yuan 
and demand dollars in foreign-exchange markets to keep the yuan at the pegged 
level. If this intervention in the currency market ceased, the yuan would rise in 
value compared to the dollar.
The pegged yuan became a contentious political issue in the United States. 
U.S. producers that competed against Chinese imports complained that the 
undervalued yuan made Chinese goods cheaper, putting the U.S. producers 
at a disadvantage. (Of course, U.S. consumers benefited from inexpensive 
imports, but in the politics of international trade, producers usually shout 
louder than consumers.) In response to these concerns, President George W. 
Bush called on China to let its currency float. Several senators proposed a 
more drastic step—a steep tariff on Chinese imports until China adjusted the 
value of its currency.
CASE STUDY

China no longer completely fixes the exchange rate. In July 2005 China 
announced a new policy: it would still intervene in foreign-exchange markets to 
prevent large and sudden movements in the exchange rate, but it would permit 
gradual changes. Moreover, it would judge the value of the yuan not just relative 
to the dollar but also relative to a broad basket of currencies. By October 2014, 
the exchange rate had moved to 6.12 yuan per dollar—a 35 percent appreciation 
of the yuan. China’s critics, including President Barack Obama, at times still 
complain about that nation’s intervention in foreign-exchange markets, but 
today China’s exchange-rate policy is a less pressing issue on the international 
economic agenda than it was in the past. n
13-6 	 From the Short Run to the Long Run: 
The Mundell–Fleming Model With a 
Changing Price Level
So far we have used the Mundell–Fleming model to study the small open 
economy in the short run when the price level is fixed. We now consider what 
happens when the price level changes. Doing so will show how the Mundell–
Fleming model provides a theory of the aggregate demand curve in a small open 
economy. It will also show how this short-run model relates to the long-run 
model of the open economy we examined in Chapter 6.
Because we now want to consider changes in the price level, the nominal and 
real exchange rates in the economy will no longer be moving in tandem. Thus, 
we must distinguish between these two variables. The nominal exchange rate is 
e and the real exchange rate is , which equals eP/P *, as you should recall from 
Chapter 6. We can write the Mundell–Fleming model as
Y 5 C (Y 2 T) 1 I (r*) 1 G 1 NX ()	
IS*,
M/P 5 L (r*, Y)	
LM*.
These equations should be familiar by now. The first equation describes the IS* 
curve; and the second describes the LM* curve. Note that net exports depend 
on the real exchange rate.
Figure 13-13 shows what happens when the price level falls. Because a lower 
price level raises the level of real money balances, the LM* curve shifts to the 
right, as in panel (a). The real exchange rate falls, and the equilibrium level of 
income rises. The aggregate demand curve summarizes this negative relationship 
between the price level and the level of income, as shown in panel (b).
Thus, just as the IS-LM model explains the aggregate demand curve in a 
closed economy, the Mundell–Fleming model explains the aggregate demand 
curve for a small open economy. In both cases, the aggregate demand curve 
shows the set of equilibria in the goods and money markets that arise as the price 
level varies. And in both cases, anything that changes equilibrium income, other

than a change in the price level, shifts the aggregate demand curve. Policies and 
events that raise income for a given price level shift the aggregate demand curve 
to the right; policies and events that lower income for a given price level shift 
the aggregate demand curve to the left.
We can use this diagram to show how the short-run model in this chapter 
is related to the long-run model in Chapter 6. Figure 13-14 shows the short-
run and long-run equilibria. In both panels of the figure, point K describes 
the short-run equilibrium because it assumes a fixed price level. At this equi­
librium, the demand for goods and services is too low to keep the economy 
producing at its natural level. Over time, low demand causes the price level 
to fall. The fall in the price level raises real money balances, shifting the 
LM* curve to the right. The real exchange rate depreciates, so net exports 
rise. Eventually, the economy reaches point C, the long-run equilibrium.

The speed of transition between the short-run and long-run equilibria 
depends on how quickly the price level adjusts to restore the economy to 
the natural level of output.
The levels of income at point K and point C are both of interest. Our 
central concern in this chapter has been how policy influences point K, the 
short-run equilibrium. In Chapter 6 we examined the determinants of 
point C, the long-run equilibrium. Whenever policymakers consider any 
change in policy, they need to consider both the short-run and long-run 
effects of their decision.

13-7 	 A Concluding Reminder
In this chapter we have examined how a small open economy works in the short run 
when prices are sticky. We have seen how monetary, fiscal, and trade policy influence 
income and the exchange rate, as well as how the behavior of the economy depends 
on whether the exchange rate is floating or fixed. In closing, it is worth repeating 
a lesson from Chapter 6. Many countries, including the United States, are neither 
closed economies nor small open economies: they lie somewhere in between.
A large open economy, such as that of the United States, combines the 
behavior of a closed economy and the behavior of a small open economy. When 
analyzing policies in a large open economy, we need to consider both the closed-
economy logic of Chapter 12 and the open-economy logic developed in this 
chapter. The appendix to this chapter presents a model for a large open economy. 
The results of that model are, as one would guess, a mixture of the two polar 
cases we have already examined.
To see how we can draw on the logic of both the closed and small open 
economies and apply these insights to the United States, consider how a mon­
etary contraction affects the economy in the short run. In a closed economy, a 
monetary contraction raises the interest rate, lowers investment, and thus low­
ers aggregate income. In a small open economy with a floating exchange rate, 
a monetary contraction raises the exchange rate, lowers net exports, and thus 
lowers aggregate income. The interest rate is unaffected, however, because it is 
determined by world financial markets.
The U.S. economy contains elements of both cases. Because the United 
States is large enough to affect the world interest rate and because capital is not 
perfectly mobile across countries, a monetary contraction does raise the inter­
est rate and depress investment. At the same time, a monetary contraction also 
raises the value of the dollar, thereby depressing net exports. Hence, although the 
Mundell–Fleming model does not precisely describe an economy like that of the 
United States, it does correctly predict what happens to international variables 
such as the exchange rate, and it shows how international interactions alter the 
effects of monetary and fiscal policies.
Summary
	1.	The Mundell–Fleming model is the IS–LM model for a small open 
economy. It takes the price level as given and then shows what causes 
fluctuations in income and the exchange rate.
	2.	The Mundell–Fleming model shows that fiscal policy does not influence 
aggregate income under floating exchange rates. A fiscal expansion causes 
the currency to appreciate, reducing net exports and offsetting the usual 
expansionary impact on aggregate income. Fiscal policy does influence 
aggregate income under fixed exchange rates.

C H A P T E R  1 3   The Open Economy Revisited: The Mundell–Fleming Model and the Exchange-Rate Regime  | 399
	3.	The Mundell–Fleming model shows that monetary policy does not 
influence aggregate income under fixed exchange rates. Any attempt 
to expand the money supply is futile because the money supply must 
adjust to ensure that the exchange rate stays at its announced level. 
Monetary policy does influence aggregate income under floating 
exchange rates.
	4.	If investors are wary of holding assets in a country, the interest rate in that 
country may exceed the world interest rate by some risk premium. Accord­
ing to the Mundell–Fleming model, if a country has a floating exchange 
rate, an increase in the risk premium causes the interest rate to rise and the 
currency of that country to depreciate.
	5.	There are advantages to both floating and fixed exchange rates. Floating 
exchange rates leave monetary policymakers free to pursue objectives 
other than exchange-rate stability. Fixed exchange rates reduce some 
of the uncertainty in international business transactions, but they may 
be subject to speculative attack if international investors believe the 
central bank does not have sufficient foreign-currency reserves to defend 
the fixed exchange rate. When choosing an exchange-rate regime, 
policymakers are constrained by the fact that it is impossible for a 
nation to have free capital flows, a fixed exchange rate, and independent 
monetary policy.

When analyzing policies in an economy such as that of the United States, we 
need to combine the closed-economy logic of the IS–LM model and the small-
open-economy logic of the Mundell–Fleming model. This appendix presents a 
model for the intermediate case of a large open economy.
As we discussed in the appendix to Chapter 6, a large open economy dif­
fers from a small open economy because its interest rate is not fixed by world 
financial markets. In a large open economy, we must consider the relation­
ship between the interest rate and the flow of capital abroad. The net capital 
outflow is the amount that domestic investors lend abroad minus the amount 
that foreign investors lend here. As the domestic interest rate falls, domes­
tic investors find foreign lending more attractive, and foreign investors find 
lending here less attractive. Thus, the net capital outflow is negatively related 
to the interest rate. Here we add this relationship to our short-run model of 
national income.
The three equations of the model are
	
Y 5 C (Y 2 T) 1 I(r) 1 G 1 NX (e),
	
M/P 5 L(r,  Y),
	
NX (e) 5 CF (r).
The first two equations are the same as those used in the Mundell–Fleming 
model of this chapter. The third equation, taken from the appendix to Chapter 6, 
states that the trade balance NX equals the net capital outflow CF, which in turn 
depends on the domestic interest rate.
To see what this model implies, substitute the third equation into the first, so 
the model becomes
	
Y 5 C (Y 2 T) 1 I (r) 1 G 1 CF (r)	
IS,
	
M/P 5 L (r, Y )	
LM.
These two equations are much like the two equations of the closed-economy 
IS–LM model. The only difference is that expenditure now depends on the 
interest rate for two reasons. As before, a higher interest rate reduces investment. 
But now a higher interest rate also reduces the net capital outflow and thus 
lowers net exports.
To analyze this model, we can use the three graphs in Figure 13-15. Panel (a) 
shows the IS–LM diagram. As in the closed-economy model in Chapters 11 
and 12, the interest rate r is on the vertical axis, and income Y is on the horizontal 
axis. The IS and LM curves together determine the equilibrium level of income 
and the equilibrium interest rate.

Open Economy

The new net-capital-outflow term in the IS equation, CF(r), makes this 
IS curve flatter than it would be in a closed economy. The more responsive 
international capital flows are to the interest rate, the flatter the IS curve is. 
You might recall from the Chapter 6 appendix that the small open economy 
represents the extreme case in which the net capital outflow is infinitely elastic 
at the world interest rate. In this extreme case, the IS curve is completely flat. 
Hence, a small open economy would be depicted in this figure with a hori­
zontal IS curve.
Panels (b) and (c) show how the equilibrium from the IS–LM model 
determines the net capital outflow, the trade balance, and the exchange rate. 
In panel (b) we see that the interest rate determines the net capital outflow. 
This curve slopes downward because a higher interest rate discourages domestic 
investors from lending abroad and encourages foreign investors to lend here, 
thereby reducing the net capital outflow. In panel (c) we see that the exchange 
rate adjusts to ensure that net exports of goods and services equal the net 
capital outflow.
Now let’s use this model to examine the impact of various policies. We assume 
that the economy has a floating exchange rate because this assumption is correct 
for most large open economies such as that of the United States.

Fiscal Policy
Figure 13-16 examines the impact of a fiscal expansion. An increase in govern­
ment purchases or a cut in taxes shifts the IS curve to the right. As panel (a) 
illustrates, this shift in the IS curve leads to an increase in the level of income 
and an increase in the interest rate. These two effects are similar to those in a 
closed economy.
Yet in the large open economy the higher interest rate reduces the net capital 
outflow, as in panel (b). The fall in the net capital outflow reduces the supply of 
dollars in the market for foreign exchange. The exchange rate appreciates, as in 
panel (c). Because domestic goods become more expensive relative to foreign 
goods, net exports fall.
Figure 13-16 shows that a fiscal expansion does raise income in the large 
open economy, unlike in a small open economy under a floating exchange rate. 
The impact on income, however, is smaller than in a closed economy. In a 
closed economy, the expansionary impact of fiscal policy is partially offset by the 
crowding out of investment: as the interest rate rises, investment falls, reducing

rate causes the net capital outflow 
to fall from CF1 to CF2. Panel (c) 
shows that the fall in the net capital 
outflow reduces the net supply of

rise from e1 to e2.

the fiscal-policy multipliers. In a large open economy, there is yet another off­
setting factor: as the interest rate rises, the net capital outflow falls, the currency 
appreciates in the foreign-exchange market, and net exports fall. This reduces 
the fiscal-policy multiplier even further. (In the figure, this additional channel 
is manifested by the flatter IS curve mentioned earlier: for any given rightward 
shift in the IS curve, a flatter curve implies a smaller expansion in income.) 
Together these effects are not large enough to make fiscal policy powerless, as 
it is in a small open economy, but they do reduce the impact of fiscal policy.
Monetary Policy
Figure 13-17 examines the effect of a monetary expansion. An increase in the 
money supply shifts the LM curve to the right, as in panel (a). The level of 
income rises, and the interest rate falls. Once again, these effects are similar to 
those in a closed economy.
Yet, as panel (b) shows, the lower interest rate leads to a higher net capital 
outflow. The increase in CF raises the supply of dollars in the market for foreign 
FIGURE  13-17
A Monetary Expansion in a Large

that a monetary expansion shifts the 
LM curve to the right. Income rises 
from Y1 to Y2, and the interest rate 
falls from r1 to r2. Panel (b) shows 
that the decrease in the interest rate 
causes the net capital outflow to 
increase from CF1 to CF2. Panel (c) 
shows that the increase in the net 
capital outflow raises the net supply 
of dollars, which causes the exchange 
rate to fall from e1 to e2.

exchange. The exchange rate falls, as in panel (c). As domestic goods become 
cheaper relative to foreign goods, net exports rise.
We can now see that the monetary transmission mechanism works through 
two channels in a large open economy. As in a closed economy, a monetary 
expansion lowers the interest rate, which stimulates investment. As in a small 
open economy, a monetary expansion causes the currency to depreciate in the 
market for foreign exchange, which stimulates net exports. Both effects result in 
a higher level of aggregate income. Indeed, because the IS curve is flatter here 
than it is in a closed economy, any given shift in the LM curve will have a larger 
impact on income.
A Rule of Thumb
This model of the large open economy describes well the U.S. economy 
today. Yet it is somewhat more complicated and cumbersome than the model 
of the closed economy we studied in Chapters 11 and 12 and the model of 
the small open economy we developed in this chapter. Fortunately, there is 
a useful rule of thumb to help you determine how policies influence a large 
open economy without remembering all the details of the model: The large 
open economy is an average of the closed economy and the small open economy. To find 
how any policy will affect any variable, find the answer in the two extreme cases and 
take an average.
For example, how does a monetary contraction affect the interest rate and 
investment in the short run? In a closed economy, the interest rate rises, and 
investment falls. In a small open economy, neither the interest rate nor investment 
changes. The effect in the large open economy is an average of these two cases: 
a monetary contraction raises the interest rate and reduces investment, but only 
somewhat. The fall in the net capital outflow mitigates the rise in the interest 
rate and the fall in investment that would occur in a closed economy. But unlike 
in a small open economy, the international flow of capital is not so strong as to 
fully negate these effects.
This rule of thumb makes the simple models all the more valuable. Although 
they do not describe perfectly the world in which we live, they do provide a 
useful guide to the effects of economic policy.

Aggregate Supply and the
Short-Run Tradeoff Between 
Inflation and Unemployment
Probably the single most important macroeconomic relationship is the Phillips curve.
—George Akerlof
There is always a temporary tradeoff between inflation and unemployment; 
there is no permanent tradeoff. The temporary tradeoff comes not from inflation 
per se, but from unanticipated inflation, which generally means, from a rising 
rate of inflation.
—Milton Friedman
M
ost economists analyze short-run fluctuations in national income and 
the price level using the model of aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply. In the previous three chapters, we examined aggregate demand 
in some detail. The IS–LM model—together with its open-economy cousin the 
Mundell–Fleming model—shows how changes in monetary and fiscal policy 
and shocks to the money and goods markets shift the aggregate demand curve. 
In this chapter, we turn our attention to aggregate supply and develop theories 
that explain the position and slope of the aggregate supply curve.
When we introduced the aggregate supply curve in Chapter 10, we estab­
lished that aggregate supply behaves differently in the short run than in the long 
run. In the long run, prices are flexible, and the aggregate supply curve is verti­
cal. When the aggregate supply curve is vertical, shifts in the aggregate demand 
curve affect the price level, but the output of the economy remains at its natural 
level. By contrast, in the short run, prices are sticky, and the aggregate supply 
curve is not vertical. In this case, shifts in aggregate demand do cause fluctua­
tions in output. In Chapter 10 we took a simplified view of price stickiness by 
drawing the short-run aggregate supply curve as a horizontal line, representing 
the extreme situation in which all prices are fixed. Our task now is to refine this

­understanding of short-run aggregate supply to better reflect the real world in 
which some prices are sticky and others are not.
After examining the basic theory of the short-run aggregate supply curve, we 
establish a key implication. We show that this curve implies a tradeoff between 
two measures of economic performance—inflation and unemployment. This 
tradeoff, called the Phillips curve, tells us that to reduce the rate of inflation poli­
cymakers must temporarily raise unemployment, and to reduce unemployment 
they must accept higher inflation. As the quotation from Milton Friedman at the 
beginning of the chapter suggests, the tradeoff between inflation and unemploy­
ment is only temporary. One goal of this chapter is to explain why policymakers 
face such a tradeoff in the short run and, just as important, why they do not face 
it in the long run.
 14-1   The Basic Theory of Aggregate 
Supply
When classes in physics study balls rolling down inclined planes, they often begin 
by assuming away the existence of friction. This assumption makes the problem 
simpler and is useful in many circumstances, but no good engineer would ever 
take this assumption as a literal description of how the world works. Similarly, this 
book began with classical macroeconomic theory, but it would be a mistake to 
assume that this model is always true. Our job now is to look more deeply into 
the “frictions” of macroeconomics.
We do this by examining two prominent models of aggregate supply. In both 
models, some market imperfection (that is, some type of friction) causes the 
output of the economy to deviate from its natural level. As a result, the short-run 
aggregate supply curve is upward sloping rather than vertical, and shifts in the 
aggregate demand curve cause output to fluctuate. These temporary deviations of 
output from its natural level represent the booms and busts of the business cycle.
Each of the two models takes us down a different theoretical route, but both 
routes end up in the same place. That final destination is a short-run aggregate 
supply equation of the form
Y 5 Y– 1 a(P 2 EP), a .0,
where Y is output, Y– is the natural level of output, P is the price level, and EP is 
the expected price level. This equation states that output deviates from its natural 
level when the price level deviates from the expected price level. The parameter 
a indicates how much output responds to unexpected changes in the price level; 
1/a is the slope of the aggregate supply curve.
Each of the models tells a different story about what lies behind this short-run 
aggregate supply equation. In other words, each model highlights a particular 
reason why unexpected movements in the price level are associated with fluctua­
tions in aggregate output.

The Sticky-Price Model
The most widely accepted explanation for the upward-sloping short-run aggre­
gate supply curve is called the sticky-price model. This model emphasizes that 
firms do not instantly adjust the prices they charge in response to changes in 
demand. Sometimes prices are set by long-term contracts between firms and cus­
tomers. Even without formal agreements, firms may hold prices steady to avoid 
annoying their regular customers with frequent price changes. Some prices are 
sticky because of the way certain markets are structured: once a firm has printed 
and distributed its catalog or price list, it is costly to alter prices. And sometimes 
sticky prices can be a reflection of sticky wages: firms base their prices on the 
costs of production, and wages may depend on social norms and notions of fair­
ness that evolve only slowly over time.
There are various ways to formalize the idea of sticky prices to show how 
they can help explain an upward-sloping aggregate supply curve. Here we 
examine an especially simple model. We first consider the pricing decisions of 
individual firms and then add together the decisions of many firms to explain 
the behavior of the economy as a whole. To fully understand the model, we have 
to depart from the assumption of perfect competition, which we have used since 
Chapter 3. Perfectly competitive firms are price-takers rather than price-setters. 
If we want to consider how firms set prices, it is natural to assume that these 
firms have at least some market power over the prices they charge.
Consider the pricing decision facing a typical firm. The firm’s desired price p 
depends on two macroeconomic variables:
n	 The overall level of prices P. A higher price level implies that the firm’s 
costs are higher. Hence, the higher the overall price level, the more the 
firm would like to charge for its product.
n	 The level of aggregate income Y. A higher level of income raises the 
demand for the firm’s product. Because marginal cost increases at 
higher levels of production, the greater the demand, the higher the firm’s 
desired price.
We write the firm’s desired price as
p 5 P 1 a(Y 2 Y–).
This equation says that the desired price p depends on the overall level of prices 
P and on the level of aggregate output relative to the natural level Y 2 Y–. The 
parameter a (which is greater than zero) measures how much the firm’s desired 
price responds to the level of aggregate output.1
Now assume that there are two types of firms. Some have flexible prices: 
they always set their prices according to this equation. Others have sticky 
1Mathematical note: The firm cares most about its relative price, which is the ratio of its nominal 
price to the overall price level. If we interpret p and P as the logarithms of the firm’s price and 
the price level, then this equation states that the desired relative price depends on the deviation of 
output from its natural level.

412 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
prices: they announce their prices in advance based on what they expect eco­
nomic conditions to be. Firms with sticky prices set prices according to
p 5 EP 1 a(EY 2 EY–),
where, as before, E represents the expected value of a variable. For simplicity, 
assume that these firms expect output to be at its natural level, so that the last 
term, a(EY 2 EY–), is zero. Then these firms set the price
p 5 EP
That is, firms with sticky prices set their prices based on what they expect other 
firms to charge.
We can use the pricing rules of the two groups of firms to derive the aggre­
gate supply equation. To do this, we find the overall price level in the economy, 
which is the weighted average of the prices set by the two groups. If s is the 
fraction of firms with sticky prices and 1 2 s is the fraction with flexible prices, 
then the overall price level is
P 5 sEP 1 (1 2 s)[P 1 a(Y 2 Y–)].
The first term is the price of the sticky-price firms weighted by their frac­
tion in the economy; the second term is the price of the flexible-price firms 
weighted by their fraction. Now subtract (1 2 s)P from both sides of this 
equation to obtain
sP 5 sEP 1 (1 2 s)[a(Y 2 Y–)].
Divide both sides by s to solve for the overall price level:
P 5 EP 1 [(1 2 s)a/s](Y 2 Y–).
The two terms in this equation are explained as follows:
n	 When firms expect a high price level, they expect high costs. Those firms 
that fix prices in advance set their prices high. These high prices cause 
the other firms to set high prices also. Hence, a high expected price level 
EP leads to a high actual price level P. This effect does not depend on the 
fraction of firms with sticky prices.
n	 When output is high, the demand for goods is high. Those firms with 
flexible prices set their prices high, which leads to a high price level. The 
effect of output on the price level depends on the fraction of firms with 
sticky prices. The more firms that have sticky prices, the less the price 
level responds to the level of economic activity.
Hence, the overall price level depends on the expected price level and on the 
level of output.
Algebraic rearrangement puts this aggregate pricing equation into a more 
familiar form:
Y 5 Y– 1 a(P 2 EP),

C H A P T E R  1 4   Aggregate Supply and the Short-Run Tradeoff Between Inflation and Unemployment  | 413
where a 5 s/[(1 2 s)a]. The sticky-price model says that the deviation of output 
from the natural level is positively associated with the deviation of the price level 
from the expected price level.2
An Alternative Theory:
The Imperfect-Information Model
Another explanation for the upward slope of the short-run aggregate supply 
curve is called the imperfect-information model. Unlike the previous model, 
this one assumes that markets clear—that is, all prices are free to adjust to balance 
supply and demand. In this model, the short-run and long-run aggregate supply 
curves differ because of temporary misperceptions about prices.
The imperfect-information model assumes that each supplier in the 
economy produces a single good and consumes many goods. Because the 
number of goods is so large, suppliers cannot observe all prices at all times. 
They monitor closely the prices of what they produce but less closely the 
prices of all the goods they consume. Because of imperfect information, they 
sometimes confuse changes in the overall level of prices with changes in rela­
tive prices. This confusion influences decisions about how much to supply, 
and it leads to a positive relationship between the price level and output in 
the short run.
Consider the decision facing a single supplier—an asparagus farmer, for 
instance. Because the farmer earns income from selling asparagus and uses this 
income to buy goods and services, the amount of asparagus he chooses to pro­
duce depends on the price of asparagus relative to the prices of other goods and 
services in the economy. If the relative price of asparagus is high, the farmer is 
motivated to work hard and produce more asparagus because the reward is great. 
If the relative price of asparagus is low, he prefers to enjoy more leisure and pro­
duce less asparagus.
Unfortunately, when the farmer makes his production decision, he does not 
know the relative price of asparagus. As an asparagus producer, he monitors the 
asparagus market closely and always knows the nominal price of asparagus. But 
he does not know the prices of all the other goods in the economy. He must, 
therefore, estimate the relative price of asparagus using the nominal price of 
asparagus and his expectation of the overall price level.
Consider how the farmer responds if all prices in the economy, including the 
price of asparagus, increase. One possibility is that he expected this change in 
prices. When he observes an increase in the price of asparagus, his estimate of its 
relative price is unchanged. He does not work any harder.
2For a more advanced development of the sticky-price model, see Julio Rotemberg, “Monopolistic 
Price Adjustment and Aggregate Output,” Review of Economic Studies 49 (1982): 517–531; and 
Guillermo Calvo, “Staggered Prices in a Utility-Maximizing Framework,” Journal of Monetary 
Economics 12, no. 3 (1983): 383–398.

414 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
The other possibility is that the farmer did not expect the price level to 
increase (or to increase by this much). When he observes the increase in the price 
of asparagus, he is not sure whether other prices have risen (in which case aspara­
gus’s relative price is unchanged) or whether only the price of asparagus has risen 
(in which case its relative price is higher). The rational inference is that some of 
each has happened. In other words, the farmer infers from the increase in the 
nominal price of asparagus that its relative price has risen somewhat. He works 
harder and produces more.
Our asparagus farmer is not unique. His decisions are similar to those of his 
neighbors, who produce broccoli, cauliflower, dill, endive, . . . , and zucchini. 
When the price level rises unexpectedly, all suppliers in the economy observe 
increases in the prices of the goods they produce. They all infer, rationally but 
mistakenly, that the relative prices of the goods they produce have risen. They 
work harder and produce more.
To sum up, the imperfect-information model says that when actual prices 
exceed expected prices, suppliers raise their output. The model implies an aggre­
gate supply curve with the familiar form
Y 5 Y– 1 a(P 2 EP).
Output deviates from the natural level when the price level deviates from the 
expected price level.
The imperfect-information story described above is the version developed 
originally by Nobel Prize–winning economist Robert Lucas in the 1970s. 
Recent work on imperfect-information models of aggregate supply has taken a 
somewhat different approach. Rather than emphasizing confusion about relative 
prices and the absolute price level, as Lucas did, this new work stresses the limited 
ability of individuals to incorporate information about the economy into their 
decisions. In this case, the friction that causes the short-run aggregate supply 
curve to slope upward is not the limited availability of information but is, instead, 
the limited ability of people to absorb and process information that is widely 
available. This information-processing constraint causes price-setters to respond 
slowly to macroeconomic news. The resulting equation for short-run aggregate 
supply is similar to those from the two models we have seen, even though the 
microeconomic foundations are somewhat different.3
3To read Lucas’s description of his model, see Robert E. Lucas, Jr., “Understanding Business 
Cycles,” Stabilization of the Domestic and International Economy, vol. 5 of the Carnegie-Rochester 
Conference on Public Policy (Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1977), 7–29. Lucas was building on 
the work of Milton Friedman, another Nobel Prize winner. See Milton Friedman, “The Role of 
Monetary Policy,” American Economic Review 58 (March 1968): 1–17. For the recent work empha­
sizing the role of information-processing constraints, see Michael Woodford, “Imperfect Com­

International Differences in the
Aggregate Supply Curve
Although all countries experience economic fluctuations, these fluctuations are 
not exactly the same everywhere. International differences are intriguing puzzles 
in themselves, and they often provide a way to test alternative economic theories. 
Examining international differences has been especially fruitful in research on 
aggregate supply.
When Robert Lucas proposed the imperfect-information model, he derived a 
surprising interaction between aggregate demand and aggregate supply: accord­
ing to his model, the slope of the aggregate supply curve should depend on the 
volatility of aggregate demand. In countries where aggregate demand fluctuates 
widely, the aggregate price level fluctuates widely as well. Because most move­
ments in prices in these countries do not represent movements in relative prices, 
suppliers should have learned not to respond much to unexpected changes in the 
price level. Therefore, the aggregate supply curve should be relatively steep (that 
is, a will be small). Conversely, in countries where aggregate demand is relatively 
stable, suppliers should have learned that most price changes are relative price 
changes. Accordingly, in these countries, suppliers should be more responsive to 
unexpected price changes, making the aggregate supply curve relatively flat (that 
is, a will be large).
Lucas tested this prediction by examining international data on output and 
prices. He found that changes in aggregate demand have the biggest effect on 
output in those countries where aggregate demand and prices are most stable. 
Lucas concluded that the evidence supports the imperfect-information model.4
The sticky-price model also makes predictions about the slope of the short-
run aggregate supply curve. In particular, it predicts that the average rate of infla­
tion should influence the slope of the short-run aggregate supply curve. When 
the average rate of inflation is high, it is very costly for firms to keep prices 
fixed for long intervals. Thus, firms adjust prices more frequently. More frequent 
price adjustment in turn allows the overall price level to respond more quickly 
to shocks to aggregate demand. Hence, a high rate of inflation should make the 
short-run aggregate supply curve steeper.
International data support this prediction of the sticky-price model. In coun­
tries with low average inflation, the short-run aggregate supply curve is relatively 
flat: fluctuations in aggregate demand have large effects on output and are only 
slowly reflected in prices. High-inflation countries have steep short-run aggre­
gate supply curves. In other words, high inflation appears to erode the frictions 
that cause prices to be sticky.5

Implications
We have seen two models of aggregate supply and the market imperfection 
that each uses to explain why the short-run aggregate supply curve is upward 
sloping. One model assumes the prices of some goods are sticky; the second 
assumes information about prices is imperfect. Keep in mind that these models 
are not incompatible with each other. We need not accept one model and reject 
the other. The world may contain both of these market imperfections, as well 
as some others, and all of them may contribute to the behavior of short-run 
aggregate supply.
The two models of aggregate supply differ in their assumptions and emphases, 
but their implications for aggregate output are similar. Both can be summarized 
by the equation
Y 5 Y– 1 a(P 2 EP).
This equation states that deviations of output from the natural level are related to 
deviations of the price level from the expected price level. If the price level is higher 
than the expected price level, output exceeds its natural level. If the price level is lower than 
the expected price level, output falls short of its natural level. Figure 14-1 graphs this 
equation. Notice that the short-run aggregate supply curve is drawn for a given 
expectation EP and that a change in EP would shift the curve.

Note that the sticky-price model can also explain Lucas’s finding that 
countries with variable aggregate demand have steep aggregate supply curves. 
If the price level is highly variable, few firms will commit to prices in advance 
(s will be small). Hence, the aggregate supply curve will be steep (a will 
be small). n

Now that we have a better understanding of aggregate supply, let’s put aggre­
gate supply and aggregate demand back together. Figure 14-2 uses our aggre­
gate supply equation to show how the economy responds to an unexpected 
increase in aggregate demand attributable, say, to an unexpected monetary 
expansion. In the short run, the equilibrium moves from point A to point B. 
The increase in aggregate demand raises the actual price level from P1 to P2. 
Because people did not expect this increase in the price level, the expected 
price level remains at EP2, and output rises from Y1 to Y2, which is above the 
natural level Y–. Thus, the unexpected expansion in aggregate demand causes 
the economy to boom.
Yet the boom does not last forever. In the long run, the expected price level 
rises to catch up with reality, causing the short-run aggregate supply curve to 
shift upward. As the expected price level rises from EP2 to EP3, the equilibrium 
of the economy moves from point B to point C. The actual price level rises 
from P2 to P3, and output falls from Y2 to Y3. In other words, the economy 
returns to the natural level of output in the long run, but at a much higher 
price level.
This analysis demonstrates an important principle that holds for both models 
of aggregate supply: long-run monetary neutrality and short-run monetary 
nonneutrality are perfectly compatible. Short-run nonneutrality is represented 
here by the movement from point A to point B, and long-run monetary 
neutrality is represented by the movement from point A to point C. We reconcile 
the short-run and long-run effects of money by emphasizing the adjustment of 
expectations about the price level.

How Shifts in Aggregate Demand 
Lead to Short-Run Fluctuations  
Here the economy begins in a long-
run equilibrium, point A. When aggre­
gate demand increases unexpectedly, 
the price level rises from P1 to P2. 
Because the price level P2 is above the 
expected price level EP2, output rises 
temporarily above the natural level, as 
the economy moves along the short-
run aggregate supply curve from point 
A to point B. In the long run, the 
expected price level rises to EP3, caus­
ing the short-run aggregate supply 
curve to shift upward. The economy 
returns to a new long-run equilibrium, 
point C, where output is back at its 
natural level.

 14-2   Inflation, Unemployment,
and the Phillips Curve
Two goals of economic policymakers are low inflation and low unemployment, 
but often these goals conflict. Suppose, for instance, that policymakers were to 
use monetary or fiscal policy to expand aggregate demand. This policy would 
move the economy along the short-run aggregate supply curve to a point of 
higher output and a higher price level. (Figure 14-2 shows this as the change 
from point A to point B.) Higher output means lower unemployment because 
firms employ more workers when they produce more. A higher price level, given 
the previous year’s price level, means higher inflation. Thus, when policymakers 
move the economy up along the short-run aggregate supply curve, they reduce 
the unemployment rate and raise the inflation rate. Conversely, when they con­
tract aggregate demand and move the economy down the short-run aggregate 
supply curve, unemployment rises and inflation falls.
This tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, called the Phillips curve, is 
our topic in this section. As we have just seen (and will derive more formally in a 
moment), the Phillips curve is a reflection of the short-run aggregate supply curve: 
as policymakers move the economy along the short-run aggregate supply curve, 
unemployment and inflation move in opposite directions. The Phillips curve is a 
useful way to express aggregate supply because inflation and unemployment are 
such important measures of economic performance.
Deriving the Phillips Curve From the
Aggregate Supply Curve
The Phillips curve in its modern form states that the inflation rate depends on 
three forces:
n	 expected inflation;
n	 the deviation of unemployment from the natural rate, called cyclical 
unemployment; and
n	 supply shocks.
These three forces are expressed in the following equation:
	
p	
5	
Ep	
2	
b(u 2 un)	
1	
v
Inflation 5 Expected 
Inflation  2 (b 3 
Cyclical 
Unemployment) 1 Supply 
Shock
where b is a parameter measuring the response of inflation to cyclical unemploy­
ment. Notice that there is a minus sign before the cyclical unemployment term: 
other things equal, higher unemployment is associated with lower ­inflation.
Where does this equation for the Phillips curve come from? Although it may 
not seem familiar, we can derive it from our equation for aggregate supply. To see 
how, write the aggregate supply equation as
P 5 EP 1 (1/a)(Y 2 Y– ).

C H A P T E R  1 4   Aggregate Supply and the Short-Run Tradeoff Between Inflation and Unemployment  | 419
With one addition, one subtraction, and one substitution, we can transform this 
equation into the Phillips curve relationship between inflation and ­unemployment.
Here are the three steps. First, add to the right-hand side of the equation a 
supply shock v to represent exogenous events (such as a change in world oil 
prices) that alter the price level and shift the short-run aggregate supply curve:
P 5 EP 1 (1/a)(Y 2 Y– ) 1 v.
Next, to go from the price level to inflation rates, subtract last year’s price level 
P21 from both sides of the equation to obtain
(P 2 P21) 5 (EP 2 P21) 1 (1/a)(Y 2Y– ) 1 v.
The term on the left-hand side, P 2 P21, is the difference between the current 
price level and last year’s price level, which is inflation p.6 The term on the 
right-hand side, EP 2 P21, is the difference between the expected price level 
and last year’s price level, which is expected inflation Ep. Therefore, we can 
replace P 2 P21 with p and EP 2 P21 with Ep:
p 5 Ep 1 (1/a)(Y 2Y– ) 1 v.
Third, to go from output to unemployment, recall from Chapter 10 that Okun’s 
law gives a relationship between these two variables. One version of Okun’s law 
states that the deviation of output from its natural level is inversely related to the 
deviation of unemployment from its natural rate; that is, when output is higher 
than the natural level of output, unemployment is lower than the natural rate of 
unemployment. We can write this as
(1/a)(Y 2Y– ) 5 2b(u 2 un).
Using this Okun’s law relationship, we can substitute 2b(u 2 un) for (1/a)(Y 2Y–) 
in the previous equation to obtain:
p 5 Ep 2 b(u 2 un) 1 v.
Thus, we can derive the Phillips curve equation from the aggregate supply equation.
All this algebra is meant to show one thing: the Phillips curve equation and the 
short-run aggregate supply equation represent essentially the same macroeconomic 
ideas. In particular, both equations show a link between real and nominal variables that 
causes the classical dichotomy (the theoretical separation of real and nominal variables) 
to break down in the short run. According to the short-run aggregate supply equa­
tion, output is related to unexpected movements in the price level. According to the 
Phillips curve equation, unemployment is related to unexpected movements in the 
inflation rate. The aggregate supply curve is more convenient when we are studying 
output and the price level, whereas the Phillips curve is more convenient when we 
are studying unemployment and inflation. But we should not lose sight of the fact 
that the Phillips curve and the aggregate supply curve are two sides of the same coin.
6Mathematical note: This statement is not precise because inflation is really the percentage change in 
the price level. To make the statement more precise, interpret P as the logarithm of the price level. 
By the properties of logarithms, the change in P is roughly the inflation rate. The reason is that 
dP 5 d(log price level) 5 d(price level)/price level.

420 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
Adaptive Expectations and Inflation Inertia
To make the Phillips curve useful for analyzing the choices facing policymakers, 
we need to specify what determines expected inflation. A simple and often 
plausible assumption is that people form their expectations of inflation based on 
recently observed inflation. This assumption is called adaptive ­expectations. 
For example, suppose that people expect prices to rise this year at the same rate 
as they did last year. Then expected inflation Ep equals last year’s inflation p21:
Ep 5 p21.
In this case, we can write the Phillips curve as
p 5 p21 2 b(u 2 un) 1 v,
which states that inflation depends on past inflation, cyclical unemployment, 
and a supply shock. When the Phillips curve is written in this form, the natural 
rate of unemployment is sometimes called the nonaccelerating inflation rate of 
unemployment, or NAIRU.
The first term in this form of the Phillips curve, p21, implies that inflation has 
inertia. That is, like an object moving through space, inflation keeps going unless 
something acts to stop it. In particular, if unemployment is at the NAIRU and 
if there are no supply shocks, the continued increase in the price level neither 
speeds up nor slows down. This inertia arises because past inflation influences 
expectations of future inflation and because these expectations influence the 
wages and prices that people set. Robert Solow captured the concept of inflation 
inertia well when, during the high inflation of the 1970s, he wrote, “Why is our 
The Phillips curve is named after New Zealand–
born economist A. W. Phillips. In 1958 ­Phillips 
observed a negative relationship between the 
unemployment rate and the rate of wage infla­
tion in data for the United Kingdom.7 The 
Phillips curve that economists use today differs 
in three ways from the relationship Phillips 
­examined.
First, the modern Phillips curve substitutes 
price inflation for wage inflation. This difference 
is not crucial because price inflation and wage 
inflation are closely related. In periods when 
wages are rising quickly, prices are rising quickly 
as well.
The History of the Modern Phillips Curve
Second, the modern Phillips curve includes 
expected inflation. This addition is due to the 
work of Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps. 
In developing early versions of the imperfect-
information model in the 1960s, these two 
economists emphasized the importance of expec­
tations for aggregate supply.
Third, the modern Phillips curve includes 
supply shocks. Credit for this addition goes 
to OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum 
Exporting Countries. In the 1970s OPEC caused 
large increases in the world price of oil, which 
made economists more aware of the importance 
of shocks to aggregate supply.

money ever less valuable? Perhaps it is simply that we have inflation because we 
expect inflation, and we expect inflation because we’ve had it.”
In the model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand, inflation inertia is 
interpreted as persistent upward shifts in both the aggregate supply curve and 
the aggregate demand curve. First, consider aggregate supply. If prices have been 
rising quickly, people will expect them to continue to rise quickly. Because the 
position of the short-run aggregate supply curve depends on the expected price 
level, the short-run aggregate supply curve will shift upward over time. It will 
continue to shift upward until some event, such as a recession or a supply shock, 
changes inflation and thereby changes expectations of inflation.
The aggregate demand curve must also shift upward to confirm the expecta­
tions of inflation. Most often, the continued rise in aggregate demand is due to 
persistent growth in the money supply. If the Fed suddenly halted money growth, 
aggregate demand would stabilize, and the upward shift in aggregate supply 
would cause a recession. The high unemployment in the recession would reduce 
inflation and expected inflation, causing inflation inertia to subside.
Two Causes of Rising and Falling Inflation
The second and third terms in the Phillips curve equation show the two forces 
that can change the rate of inflation.
The second term, b(u – un), shows that cyclical unemployment—the devia­
tion of unemployment from its natural rate—exerts upward or downward pres­
sure on inflation. Low unemployment pulls the inflation rate up. This is called 
demand-pull inflation because high aggregate demand is responsible for this 
type of inflation. High unemployment pulls the inflation rate down. The param­
eter b measures how responsive inflation is to cyclical unemployment.
The third term, v, shows that inflation also rises and falls because of supply 
shocks. An adverse supply shock, such as the rise in world oil prices in the 1970s, 
implies a positive value of v and causes inflation to rise. This is called cost-push 
inflation because adverse supply shocks are typically events that push up the 
costs of production. A beneficial supply shock, such as the oil glut that led to a 
fall in oil prices in the 1980s, makes v negative and causes inflation to fall.
CASE STUDY
Inflation and Unemployment in the United States
Because inflation and unemployment are such important measures of eco­
nomic performance, macroeconomic developments are often viewed through 
the lens of the Phillips curve. Figure 14-3 displays the history of inflation and 
­unemployment in the United States from 1960 to 2013. These data, spanning 
more than half a century, illustrate some of the causes of rising or falling ­inflation.
The 1960s showed how policymakers can, in the short run, lower unemploy­
ment at the cost of higher inflation. The tax cut of 1964, together with expansion­
ary monetary policy, expanded aggregate demand and pushed the unemployment 
rate below 5 percent. This expansion of aggregate demand continued in the

late 1960s largely as a by-product of government spending for the Vietnam War. 
Unemployment fell lower and inflation rose higher than policymakers intended.
The 1970s were a period of economic turmoil. The decade began with poli­
cymakers trying to lower the inflation inherited from the 1960s. President Nixon 
imposed temporary controls on wages and prices, and the Federal Reserve engi­
neered a recession through contractionary monetary policy, but the inflation rate 
fell only slightly. The effects of wage and price controls ended when the controls 
were lifted, and the recession was too small to counteract the inflationary impact 
of the boom that had preceded it. By 1972 the unemployment rate was the same 
as a decade earlier, while inflation was about 3 percentage points higher.
Beginning in 1973 policymakers had to cope with the large supply shocks 
caused by OPEC. OPEC first raised oil prices in the mid-1970s, pushing 
the inflation rate above 9 percent. This adverse supply shock, together with 
­temporarily tight monetary policy, led to a recession in 1975. High unemploy­
ment during the recession reduced inflation somewhat, but further OPEC price 
hikes pushed inflation up again in the late 1970s.
The 1980s began with high inflation and high expectations of inflation. 
Under the leadership of Chairman Paul Volcker, the Federal Reserve doggedly 
pursued monetary policies aimed at reducing inflation. In 1982 and 1983 the 
unemployment rate reached its highest level in 40 years. High unemployment, 
aided by a fall in oil prices in 1986, pulled the inflation rate down from about 
9 percent to about 2 percent. By 1987 the unemployment rate of about 6 percent

was close to most estimates of the natural rate. Unemployment continued to fall 
through the 1980s, however, reaching a low of 5.3 percent in 1989 and begin­
ning a new round of demand-pull inflation.
Compared to the preceding 30 years, the 1990s and early 2000s were relatively 
quiet. The 1990s began with a recession caused by several contractionary shocks 
to aggregate demand: tight monetary policy, the savings-and-loan crisis, and a 
fall in consumer confidence coinciding with the Gulf War. The unemployment 
rate rose to 7.5 percent in 1992, and inflation fell slightly. Unlike in the 1982 
recession, unemployment in the 1990 recession was never far above the natural 
rate, so the effect on inflation was small. Similarly, a recession in 2001 (discussed 
in Chapter 12) raised unemployment, but the downturn was mild by historical 
standards, and the impact on inflation was once again slight.
A more severe recession began in 2008. As we discussed in Chapter 12, the 
cause of this downturn was a financial crisis, leading to a substantial decline in 
aggregate demand. Unemployment rose significantly in 2009, and the inflation 
rate fell to low levels, much as the conventional Phillips curve predicts. With 
unemployment so persistently high, some economists worried that the economy 
would experience deflation (a negative inflation rate). Yet that did not occur. 
One possible explanation is that expectations of inflation remained anchored 
at around 2 percent, instead of changing as the assumption of adaptive expecta­
tions would indicate. That is, the Fed’s recent history had given the central bank 
enough credibility about its target rate of inflation that expected inflation did not 
change as quickly as it might have in past episodes.
Thus, U.S. macroeconomic history illustrates the many forces working on the 
inflation rate, as described in the Phillips curve equation. The 1960s and 1980s 
show the two sides of demand-pull inflation: in the 1960s low unemployment 
pulled inflation up, and in the 1980s high unemployment pulled inflation down. 
The oil-price hikes of the 1970s show the effects of cost-push inflation. And the 
aftermath of the recession of 2008–2009 shows that inflation sometimes surprises 
us, in part because changing expectations are not always easy to predict.8 n

The Short-Run Tradeoff Between Inflation and 
Unemployment
Consider the options the Phillips curve gives to a policymaker who can influ­
ence aggregate demand with monetary or fiscal policy. At any moment, expected 
inflation and supply shocks are beyond the policymaker’s immediate control. Yet, 
by changing aggregate demand, the policymaker can alter output, unemploy­
ment, and inflation. The policymaker can expand aggregate demand to lower 
unemployment and raise inflation. Or the policymaker can depress aggregate 
demand to raise unemployment and lower inflation.
Figure 14-4 plots the Phillips curve equation and shows the short-run tradeoff 
between inflation and unemployment. When unemployment is at its natural

rate (u 5 un), inflation depends on expected inflation and the supply shock 
(p 5 Ep 1 v). The parameter b determines the slope of the tradeoff between 
inflation and unemployment. In the short run, for a given level of expected infla­
tion, policymakers can manipulate aggregate demand to choose any combination 
of inflation and unemployment on this curve, called the short-run Phillips curve.
Notice that the position of the short-run Phillips curve depends on the 
expected rate of inflation. If expected inflation rises, the curve shifts upward, 
and the policymaker’s tradeoff becomes less favorable: inflation is higher for 
any level of unemployment. Figure 14-5 shows how the tradeoff depends on 
expected inflation.

If you ask an astronomer how far a particular 
star is from our sun, he’ll give you a number, 
but it won’t be accurate. Our ability to measure 
astronomical distances is still limited. An astron­
omer might well take better measurements and 
conclude that a star is really twice or half as far 
away as he previously thought.
Estimates of the natural rate of unemploy­
ment, or NAIRU, are also far from precise. One 
problem is supply shocks. Shocks to oil supplies, 
crop harvests, or technological progress can cause 
inflation to rise or fall in the short run. When we 
observe rising inflation, therefore, we cannot be 
sure whether it is evidence that the unemployment 
rate is below the natural rate or evidence that the 
economy is experiencing an adverse supply shock.
A second problem is that the natural rate 
changes over time. Demographic changes (such 
as the aging of the baby-boom generation), 
policy changes (such as minimum-wage laws), 
and institutional changes (such as the declin­
ing role of unions) all influence the economy’s

normal level of unemployment. Estimating the 
natural rate is like hitting a moving target.
Economists deal with these problems using sta­
tistical techniques that yield a best guess about the 
natural rate and allow them to gauge the uncertainty 
associated with their estimates. In one such study, 
Douglas Staiger, James Stock, and Mark Watson 
estimated the natural rate to be 6.2 percent in 1990, 
with a 95 percent confidence interval from 5.1 to 
7.7 percent. A 95  ­percent confidence interval is a 
range such that the statistician is 95 percent confi­
dent that the true value falls in that range. A recent 
study by economists at the Federal Reserve put the 
natural rate in 2013 at 5.8 percent, with a 95 percent 
confidence interval from 4.5 to 7 percent. These 
large confidence intervals show that estimates of the 
natural rate of unemployment are not at all precise.
This conclusion has profound implications. 
Policymakers may want to keep unemployment 
close to its natural rate, but their ability to do 
so is limited by the fact that they cannot be sure 
what that natural rate is.9

Because people adjust their expectations of inflation over time, the tradeoff 
between inflation and unemployment holds only in the short run. The policy­
maker cannot keep inflation above expected inflation (and thus unemployment 
below its natural rate) forever. Eventually, expectations adapt to whatever infla­
tion rate the policymaker has chosen. In the long run, the classical dichotomy 
holds, unemployment returns to its natural rate, and there is no tradeoff between 
inflation and unemployment.
Disinflation and the Sacrifice Ratio
Imagine an economy in which unemployment is at its natural rate and inflation 
is running at 6 percent. What would happen to unemployment and output if the 
central bank pursued a policy to reduce inflation from 6 to 2 percent?

426 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
10Two classic studies of the sacrifice ratio are Arthur M. Okun, “Efficient Disinflationary Policies,” 
American Economic Review 68 (May 1978): 348–352; and Robert J. Gordon and Stephen R. King, 
“The Output Cost of Disinflation in Traditional and Vector Autoregressive Models,” Brookings 
Papers on Economic Activity 1982, no. 1: 205–245.
The Phillips curve shows that in the absence of a beneficial supply shock, 
lowering inflation requires a period of high unemployment and reduced output. 
But by how much and for how long would unemployment need to rise above 
the natural rate? Before deciding whether to reduce inflation, policymakers must 
know how much output would be lost during the transition to lower inflation. 
This cost can then be compared with the benefits of lower inflation.
Much research has used the available data to examine the Phillips curve quan­
titatively. The results of these studies are often summarized in a number called 
the sacrifice ratio, the percentage of a year’s real GDP that must be forgone to 
reduce inflation by 1 percentage point. Although estimates of the sacrifice ratio 
vary substantially, a typical estimate is about 5: for every percentage point that 
inflation is to fall, 5 percent of one year’s GDP must be sacrificed.10
We can also express the sacrifice ratio in terms of unemployment. Okun’s law 
says that a change of 1 percentage point in the unemployment rate translates 
into a change of 2 percentage points in GDP. Therefore, reducing inflation by 
1 percentage point requires about 2.5 percentage points of cyclical unemployment.
We can use the sacrifice ratio to estimate by how much and for how long 
unemployment must rise to reduce inflation. If reducing inflation by 1 percent­
age point requires a sacrifice of 5 percent of a year’s GDP, reducing inflation by 
4 percentage points requires a sacrifice of 20 percent of a year’s GDP. Equiva­
lently, this reduction in inflation requires a sacrifice of 10 percentage points of 
cyclical unemployment.
This disinflation could take various forms, each totaling the same sacrifice of 
20 percent of a year’s GDP. For example, a rapid disinflation would lower output 
by 10 percent for two years: this is sometimes called the cold-turkey solution to 
inflation. A moderate disinflation would lower output by 5 percent for four years. 
An even more gradual disinflation would depress output by 2 percent for a decade.
Rational Expectations and the Possibility
of Painless Disinflation
Because the expectation of inflation influences the short-run tradeoff between 
inflation and unemployment, it is crucial to understand how people form 
expectations. So far, we have been assuming that expected inflation depends on 
recently observed inflation. Although this assumption of adaptive expectations is 
plausible, it is probably too simple to apply in all circumstances.
An alternative approach is to assume that people have rational expectations. 
That is, we might assume that people optimally use all the available information, 
including information about current government policies, to forecast the future. 
Because monetary and fiscal policies influence inflation, expected inflation 

C H A P T E R  1 4   Aggregate Supply and the Short-Run Tradeoff Between Inflation and Unemployment  | 427
should also depend on the monetary and fiscal policies in effect. According to 
the theory of rational expectations, a change in monetary or fiscal policy will 
change expectations, and an evaluation of any policy change must incorporate 
this effect on expectations. If people do form their expectations rationally, then 
inflation may have less inertia than first appears.
Here is how Thomas Sargent, a prominent advocate of rational expecta­
tions and a 2011 Nobel laureate in economics, describes its implications for the 
Phillips curve:
An alternative “rational expectations” view denies that there is any inherent 
momentum to the present process of inflation. This view maintains that firms 
and workers have now come to expect high rates of inflation in the future and 
that they strike inflationary bargains in light of these expectations. However, it is 
held that people expect high rates of inflation in the future precisely because the 
government’s current and prospective monetary and fiscal policies warrant those 
expectations. . . . Thus inflation only seems to have a momentum of its own; it is 
actually the long-term government policy of persistently running large deficits 
and creating money at high rates which imparts the momentum to the inflation 
rate. An implication of this view is that inflation can be stopped much more 
quickly than advocates of the “momentum” view have indicated and that their 
estimates of the length of time and the costs of stopping inflation in terms of 
foregone output are erroneous. . . . [Stopping inflation] would require a change in 
the policy regime: there must be an abrupt change in the continuing government 
policy, or strategy, for setting deficits now and in the future that is sufficiently 
binding as to be widely believed. . . . How costly such a move would be in terms 
of foregone output and how long it would be in ­taking effect would depend 
partly on how resolute and evident the government’s commitment was.11
Thus, advocates of rational expectations argue that the short-run Phillips curve 
does not accurately represent the options that policymakers have available. They 
believe that if policymakers are credibly committed to reducing inflation, rational 
people will understand the commitment and will quickly lower their expecta­
tions of inflation. Inflation can then come down without a rise in unemployment 
and fall in output. According to the theory of rational expectations, traditional 
estimates of the sacrifice ratio are not useful for evaluating the impact of alterna­
tive policies. Under a credible policy, the costs of reducing inflation may be much 
lower than estimates of the sacrifice ratio suggest.
In the most extreme case, one can imagine reducing the rate of inflation with­
out causing any recession at all. A painless disinflation has two requirements. First, 
the plan to reduce inflation must be announced before the workers and firms 
that set wages and prices have formed their expectations. Second, the workers 
and firms must believe the announcement; otherwise, they will not reduce their 
expectations of inflation. If both requirements are met, the announcement will 
immediately shift the short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment 
downward, permitting a lower rate of inflation without higher unemployment.

Effects (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), 41–98.

Although the rational-expectations approach remains controversial, almost all 
economists agree that expectations of inflation influence the short-run tradeoff 
between inflation and unemployment. The credibility of a policy to reduce infla­
tion is therefore one determinant of how costly the policy will be. Unfortunately, 
it is often difficult to predict whether the public will view the announcement of 
a new policy as credible. The central role of expectations makes forecasting the 
results of alternative policies far more difficult.
CASE STUDY
The Sacrifice Ratio in Practice
The Phillips curve with adaptive expectations implies that reducing inflation 
requires a period of high unemployment and low output. By contrast, the 
rational-expectations approach suggests that reducing inflation can be much less 
costly. What happens during actual disinflations?
Consider the U.S. disinflation in the early 1980s. This decade began with some 
of the highest rates of inflation in U.S. history. Yet because of the tight monetary 
policies the Fed pursued under Chairman Paul Volcker, the rate of inflation fell 
substantially in the first few years of the decade. This episode provides a natural 
experiment with which to estimate how much output is lost during the process 
of disinflation.
The first question is, how much did inflation fall? As measured by the GDP 
deflator, inflation reached a peak of 9.3 percent in 1981. It is natural to end the 
episode in 1985 because oil prices plunged in 1986—a large, beneficial supply 
shock unrelated to Fed policy. In 1985, inflation was 3.2 percent, so we can esti­
mate that the Fed engineered a reduction in inflation of 6.1 percentage points 
over four years.
The second question is, how much output was lost during this period? 
Table 14-1 shows the unemployment rate from 1982 to 1985. Assuming that the 
natural rate of unemployment was 6 percent, we can compute the amount of 
cyclical unemployment in each year. In total over this period, there were 10.0 per­
centage points of cyclical unemployment. Okun’s law says that 1 percentage

Policy (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994), 155–193.
point of unemployment translates into 2 percentage points of GDP. Therefore, 
20.0 percentage points of annual GDP were lost during the disinflation.
Now we can compute the sacrifice ratio for this episode. We know that 
20.0 percentage points of GDP were lost and that inflation fell by 6.1 percentage 
points. Hence, 20.0/6.1, or 3.3, percentage points of GDP were lost for each 
percentage-point reduction in inflation. The estimate of the sacrifice ratio from 
the Volcker disinflation is 3.3.
This estimate of the sacrifice ratio is smaller than the estimates made before 
Volcker was appointed Fed chairman. In other words, Volcker reduced inflation 
at a smaller cost than many economists had predicted. One explanation is that 
Volcker’s tough stand was credible enough to influence expectations of infla­
tion directly. Yet the change in expectations was not large enough to make the 
disinflation painless: in 1982 unemployment reached its highest level since the 
Great Depression.
Although the Volcker disinflation is only one historical episode, this kind of 
analysis can be applied to other disinflations. One comprehensive study docu­
mented the results of 65 disinflations in 19 countries. In almost all cases, the 
reduction in inflation came at the cost of temporarily lower output. Yet the size 
of the output loss varied from episode to episode. Rapid disinflations usually had 
smaller sacrifice ratios than slower ones. That is, in contrast to what the Phillips 
curve with adaptive expectations suggests, a cold-turkey approach appears less 
costly than a gradual one. Moreover, countries with more flexible wage-setting 
institutions, such as shorter labor contracts, had smaller sacrifice ratios. These 
findings indicate that reducing inflation always has some cost but that policies 
and institutions can affect its magnitude.12 n
Hysteresis and the Challenge to the 
Natural-Rate Hypothesis
Our discussion of the cost of disinflation—and indeed our entire discussion of 
economic fluctuations in the past four chapters—has been based on an assump­
tion called the natural-rate hypothesis. This hypothesis is summarized in the 
following statement:
Fluctuations in aggregate demand affect output and employment only in the short 
run. In the long run, the economy returns to the levels of output, employment, and 
unemployment described by the classical model.
The natural-rate hypothesis allows macroeconomists to separately study short-
run and long-run developments in the economy. It is one expression of the 
classical dichotomy.
Some economists, however, have challenged the natural-rate hypothesis by 
suggesting that aggregate demand may affect output and employment even in 
the long run. They have pointed out a number of mechanisms through which 

430 |  P A R T  I V   Business Cycle Theory: The Economy in the Short Run
recessions might leave permanent scars on the economy by altering the natural 
rate of unemployment. Hysteresis is the term used to describe the long-lasting 
influence of history on the natural rate.
A recession can have permanent effects if it changes the people who become 
unemployed. For instance, workers might lose valuable job skills when unem­
ployed, which diminishes their ability to find a job even after the recession ends. 
Alternatively, a long period of unemployment may change an individual’s atti­
tude toward work and reduce his desire to find employment. In either case, the 
recession permanently inhibits the process of job search and raises the amount 
of frictional unemployment.
Another way in which a recession can permanently affect the economy is by 
changing the process that determines wages. Those who become unemployed 
may lose their influence on the wage-setting process. Unemployed workers 
may lose their status as union members, for example. More generally, some of 
the insiders in the wage-setting process become outsiders. If the smaller group of 
insiders cares more about high real wages and less about high employment, then 
the recession may permanently push real wages farther above the equilibrium 
level and raise the amount of structural unemployment.
Hysteresis remains a controversial theory. Some economists believe this 
theory helps explain persistently high unemployment in Europe because the 
rise in European unemployment, which started in the early 1980s, coincided 
with disinflation but continued after inflation stabilized. Moreover, the increase 
in unemployment tended to be larger for those countries that experienced 
the greatest reductions in inflations, such as Ireland, Italy, and Spain. As these 
episodes suggest, hysteresis can increase the sacrifice ratio because output is 
lost even after the period of disinflation is over. Yet there is still no consensus 
on whether the hysteresis phenomenon is significant or why it might be more 
pronounced in some countries than in others. (Alternative explanations of high 
European unemployment, discussed in Chapter 7, point to forces other than 
disinflation.) If the theory of hysteresis is true, however, it is important because 
it greatly increases the cost of recessions.
The issue rose to prominence once again in the aftermath of the Great 
Recession of 2008–2009. Many economists wondered whether the high levels 
of long-term unemployment and depressed labor-force participation (discussed 
in Chapter 7) would leave permanent scars on the economy. By the end of 2014, 
the unemployment rate had fallen below 6 percent, but because many people 
had stopped looking for work, the employment-to-population ratio remained 
well below the levels experienced before the recession. As this book was going 
to press, policymakers continued to debate what the “new normal” in the labor 
market would be in the years ahead.13

C H A P T E R  1 4   Aggregate Supply and the Short-Run Tradeoff Between Inflation and Unemployment  | 431
 14-3    Conclusion
We began this chapter by discussing two models of aggregate supply, each of 
which focuses on a different reason that, in the short run, output rises above its 
natural level when the price level rises above the level that people had expected. 
Both models explain why the short-run aggregate supply curve is upward slop­
ing, and both yield a short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. 
A convenient way to express and analyze that tradeoff is with the Phillips curve 
equation, according to which inflation depends on expected inflation, cyclical 
unemployment, and supply shocks.
Keep in mind that not all economists endorse all the ideas discussed here. 
There is widespread disagreement, for instance, about the practical importance of 
rational expectations and the relevance of hysteresis. If you find it difficult to fit 
all the pieces together, you are not alone. The study of aggregate supply remains 
one of the most unsettled—and therefore one of the most exciting—research 
areas in macroeconomics.
Summary
	1.	The two theories of aggregate supply—the sticky-price and imperfect-
information models—attribute deviations of output and employment from 
their natural levels to various market imperfections. According to both 
theories, output rises above its natural level when the price level exceeds 
the expected price level, and output falls below its natural level when the 
price level is less than the expected price level.
	2.	Economists often express aggregate supply in a relationship called the 
Phillips curve. The Phillips curve says that inflation depends on expected 
inflation, the deviation of unemployment from its natural rate, and 
supply shocks. According to the Phillips curve, policymakers who ­control 
aggregate demand face a short-run tradeoff between inflation and 
unemployment.
	3.	If expected inflation depends on recently observed inflation, then 
inflation has inertia, which means that reducing inflation requires 
either a beneficial supply shock or a period of high unemployment and 
reduced output. If people have rational expectations, however, then a 
credible announcement of a change in policy might be able to influence 
expectations directly and, therefore, reduce inflation without causing 
a recession.
	4.	Most economists accept the natural-rate hypothesis, according to which 
fluctuations in aggregate demand have only short-run effects on output and 
unemployment. Yet some economists have suggested ways in which reces­
sions can leave permanent scars on the economy by raising the natural rate 
of unemployment.

P R O B L E M S  A N D  A P P L I C A T I O N S
	1.	In the sticky-price model, describe the aggregate 
supply curve in the following special cases. How 
do these cases compare to the short-run aggregate 
supply curve we discussed in Chapter 10?
	a.	All firms have sticky prices (s 5 1).
	b.	The desired price does not depend on aggre­
gate output (a 5 0).
	2.	Suppose that an economy has the Phillips curve
p 5 p21 2 0.5(u 2 5).
	a.	What is the natural rate of unemployment?
	b.	Graph the short-run and long-run relation­
ships between inflation and unemployment.
	c.	How much cyclical unemployment is 
necessary to reduce inflation by 4 percentage 
points? Using Okun’s law, compute the 
sacrifice ratio.
	d.	Inflation is running at 6 percent. The central 
bank wants to reduce it to 2 percent. Give 
two scenarios that will achieve that goal.
	3.	
 • An economy has the following 
equation for the Phillips curve:
p 5 Ep 2 .5(u 2 6)
People form expectations of inflation by taking 
a weighted average of the previous two years of 
inflation:
Ep 5 0.7 p21 1 0.3 p22
Okun’s law for this economy is:
(Y 2 Y21)/Y21 5 3.0 2 2.0 (u 2 u21)
The economy begins at its natural rate of 
unemployment with a stable inflation rate of 
5 percent.
	a.	What is the natural rate of unemployment for 
this economy?
	b.	Graph the short-run tradeoff between infla­
tion and unemployment that this economy 
faces. Label the point where the economy 
begins as point A. (Be sure to give numerical 
values for point A.)
	c.	A fall in aggregate demand leads to a reces­
sion, causing the unemployment rate to 
rise 4 percentage points above its natural 
rate. On your graph in part (a), label the 
point the economy experiences that year 
as point B. (Once again, be sure to give 
numerical values.)

	d.	Unemployment remains at this high level 
for two years (the initial year described in 
part (c) and one more), after which it returns 
to its natural rate. Create a table showing 
unemployment, inflation, expected inflation, 
and output growth for 10 years beginning 
two years before the recession. (These 
calculations are best done on a computer 
spreadsheet.)
	e.	On the same graph you used in part (b), 
graph the short-run tradeoff the economy 
faces at the end of this 10-year period. 
Label the point where the economy finds 
itself as point C. (Again, use numerical 
values.)
	f.	Compare the equilibrium before the recession 
with the new long-run (period ten) 
equilibrium. How much does inflation 
change? How many percentage points of out­
put are lost during the transition? What is this 
economy’s sacrifice ratio?
	4.	According to the rational-expectations approach, 
if everyone believes that policymakers are com­
mitted to reducing inflation, the cost of reducing 
inflation—the sacrifice ratio—will be lower than 
if the public is skeptical about the policymakers’ 
intentions. Why might this be true? How might 
credibility be achieved?
	5.	Suppose that the economy is initially at a long-
run equilibrium. Then the Fed increases the 
money supply.
	a.	Assuming any resulting inflation to be 
unexpected, describe any changes in 
GDP, unemployment, and inflation that 
are caused by the monetary expansion. 
Explain your conclusions using three 
diagrams: one for the IS–LM model, one 
for the AD–AS model, and one for the 
Phillips curve.
	b.	Assuming instead that any resulting infla­
tion is expected, describe any changes in 
GDP, unemployment, and inflation that are 
caused by the monetary expansion. Once 
again, explain your conclusions using three 
diagrams: one for the IS–LM model, one 
for the AD–AS model, and one for the 
Phillips curve.
	6.	Assume that people have rational expectations 
and that the economy is described by the sticky-
price model. Explain why each of the following 
propositions is true.
	a.	Only unanticipated changes in the 
money supply affect real GDP. Changes 
in the money supply that were anticipated 
when prices were set do not have any 
real effects.
	b.	If the Fed sets the money supply at the 
same time as people are setting prices, so 
that everyone has the same information 
about the state of the economy, then 
monetary policy cannot be used systemati­
cally to stabilize output. Hence, a policy 
of keeping the money supply constant 
will have the same real effects as a policy 
of adjusting the money supply in response 
to the state of the economy. (This is called 
the policy irrelevance proposition.)
	c.	If the Fed sets the money supply well 
after people have set prices, so that the 
Fed has collected more information about 
the state of the economy, then monetary 
policy can be used systematically to 
stabilize output.
	7.	Suppose that an economy has the Phillips curve
p 5 p21 2 0.5(u 2 un)
and that the natural rate of unemployment 
is given by an average of the past two years’ 
unemployment:
un 5 0.5(u21 1 u22).
	a.	Why might the natural rate of unemploy­
ment depend on recent unemployment 
(as is assumed in the preceding equation)?
	b.	Suppose that the Fed follows a policy to 
permanently reduce the inflation rate by 
1 percentage point. What effect will that 
policy have on the unemployment rate 
over time?
	c.	What is the sacrifice ratio in this economy? 
Explain.
	d.	What do these equations imply about the 
short-run and long-run tradeoffs between 
inflation and unemployment?

	8.	Some economists believe that taxes have an 
important effect on the labor supply. They argue 
that higher taxes cause people to want to work 
less and that lower taxes cause them to want to 
work more. Consider how this effect alters the 
macroeconomic analysis of tax changes.
	a.	If this view is correct, how does a tax cut 
affect the natural level of output?
	b.	How does a tax cut affect the aggregate 
demand curve? The long-run aggregate supply 
curve? The short-run aggregate supply curve?
	c.	What is the short-run impact of a tax cut on 
output and the price level? How does your 
answer differ from the case without the labor-
supply effect?
	d.	What is the long-run impact of a tax cut on 
output and the price level? How does your 
answer differ from the case without the labor-
supply effect?
	9.	Go to the Web site of the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (http://www.bls.gov). For each of 
the past five years, find the inflation rate as 
measured by the consumer price index for 
all items (sometimes called headline inflation) 
and as measured by the CPI excluding food 
and energy (sometimes called core inflation). 
Compare these two measures of inflation. 
Why might they be different? What might 
the difference tell you about shifts in the 
aggregate supply curve and in the short-run 
Phillips curve?

In the previous chapters, we have seen many models of how the economy 
works. When learning these models, it can be hard to see how they are related. 
Now that we have finished developing the model of aggregate demand and 
aggregate supply, this is a good time to look back at what we have learned. This 
appendix sketches a large, comprehensive model that incorporates much of the 
theory we have already seen, including the classical theory presented in Part Two 
and the business cycle theory presented in Part Four. The notation and equa­
tions should be familiar from previous chapters. The goal is to put much of our 
previous analysis into a common framework to clarify the relationships among 
the various models.
The model has seven equations:
	
Y 5 C(Y 2 T ) 1I(r) 1 G 1 NX()	
IS: Goods Market Equilibrium
	 M/P 5 L(i, Y )	
LM: Money Market Equilibrium
	NX() 5 CF(r – r*)

Relationship Between Real and 
	
	
Nominal Exchange Rates
	
Y 5 Y– 1 a(P – EP)	
Aggregate Supply
	
Y– 5 F(K–, L–)	
Natural Level of Output
These seven equations determine the equilibrium values of seven endogenous 
variables: output Y, the natural level of output Y–, the real interest rate r, the 
nominal interest rate i, the real exchange rate , the nominal exchange rate e, 
and the price level P.
There are many exogenous variables that influence these endogenous vari­
ables. They include the money supply M, government purchases G, taxes T, the 
capital stock K, the labor force L, the world price level P*, and the world real 
interest rate r*. In addition, there are two expectation variables: the expectation 
of future inflation Ep and the expectation of the current price level formed 
in the past EP. As written, the model takes these expectations as exogenous, 
although additional equations could be added to make them endogenous.
The mathematical techniques available to analyze this seven-equation model 
are beyond the scope of this book. But this large model is still useful because we 
can use it to see how the smaller models we have examined are related to one

another. In particular, many of the models we have been studying are special cases of this 
large model. Let’s consider six special cases in particular. (A problem at the end of 
this section examines a few more.)
Special Case 1: The Classical Closed Economy  Suppose that EP 5 P, 
L(i, Y ) 5 (1/V )Y, and CF(r – r*) 5 0. In words, these equations mean that 
expectations of the price level adjust so that expectations are correct, money 
demand is proportional to income, and there are no international capital 
flows. In this case, output is always at its natural level, the real interest rate 
adjusts to equilibrate the goods market, the price level moves parallel with 
the money supply, and the nominal interest rate adjusts one-for-one with 
expected inflation. This special case corresponds to the economy analyzed in 
Chapters 3 and 5.
Special Case 2: The Classical Small Open Economy  Suppose that 
EP 5 P, L(i, Y ) 5 (1/V )Y, and CF(r – r*) is infinitely elastic. Now we are 
examining the special case when international capital flows respond greatly to 
any differences between the domestic and world interest rates. This means that 
r 5 r* and that the trade balance NX equals the difference between saving 
and investment at the world interest rate. This special case corresponds to the 
economy analyzed in Chapter 6.
Special Case 3: The Basic Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate 
Supply  Suppose that a is infinite and L(i, Y ) 5 (1/V )Y. In this case, the short-run 
aggregate supply curve is horizontal, and the aggregate demand curve is determined 
only by the quantity equation. This special case corresponds to the economy analyzed 
in Chapter 10.
Special Case 4: The IS–LM Model  Suppose that a is infinite and CF(r – r*) 5 0. 
In this case, the short-run aggregate supply curve is horizontal, and there are no 
international capital flows. For any given level of expected inflation Ep, the 
level of income and interest rate must adjust to equilibrate the goods market 
and the money market. This special case corresponds to the economy analyzed 
in Chapters 11 and 12.
Special Case 5: The Mundell–Fleming Model With a Floating Exchange 
Rate  Suppose that a is infinite and CF(r – r *) is infinitely elastic. In this case, 
the short-run aggregate supply curve is horizontal, and international capital flows 
are so great as to ensure that r 5 r*. The exchange rate floats freely to reach its 
equilibrium level. This special case corresponds to the first economy analyzed in 
Chapter 13.
Special Case 6: The Mundell–Fleming Model With a Fixed Exchange 
Rate  Suppose that a is infinite, CF(r – r*) is infinitely elastic, and the nominal 
exchange rate e is fixed. In this case, the short-run aggregate supply curve is 
horizontal, huge international capital flows ensure that r 5 r*, but the exchange 
rate is set by the central bank. The exchange rate is now an exogenous policy 
variable, but the money supply M is an endogenous variable that must adjust to 
ensure the exchange rate hits the fixed level. This special case corresponds to the 
second economy analyzed in Chapter 13.

You should now see the value in this big model. Even though the model 
is too large to be useful in developing an intuitive understanding of how the 
economy works, it shows that the different models we have been studying are 
closely related. In each chapter, we made some simplifying assumptions to make 
the big model smaller and easier to understand.
Figure 14-6 presents a schematic diagram that illustrates how the various models are 
related. In particular, it shows how, starting with the mother of all models above, you 
can arrive at some of the models examined in previous chapters. Here are the steps:
	1.	Classical or Keynesian? You decide whether you want a classical special 
case (which occurs when EP 5 P or when a equals zero, so output is at 
its natural level) or a Keynesian special case (which occurs when a equals 
infinity, so the price level is completely fixed).

	2.	Closed or Open? You decide whether you want a closed economy (which 
occurs when the capital flow CF always equals zero) or an open economy 
(which allows CF to differ from zero).
	3.	Small or Large? If you want an open economy, you decide whether you 
want a small one (in which CF is infinitely elastic at the world interest 
rate r*) or a large one (in which the domestic interest rate is not pinned 
down by the world rate).
	4.	Floating or Fixed? If you are examining a small open economy, you decide 
whether the exchange rate is floating (in which case the central bank sets 
the money supply) or fixed (in which case the central bank allows the 
money supply to adjust).
	5.	Fixed Velocity? If you are considering a closed economy with the Keynesian 
assumption of fixed prices, you decide whether you want to focus on the 
special case in which velocity is exogenously fixed.
By making this series of modeling decisions, you move from the more complete 
and complex model to a simpler, more narrowly focused special case that is easier 
to understand and use.
When you are thinking about the real world, it is important to keep in mind 
all the models and their simplifying assumptions. Each of these models provides 
insight into some facet of the economy.

A Dynamic Model of Economic 
Fluctuations
The important thing in science is not so much to obtain new facts as to dis­
cover new ways of thinking about them.
—William Bragg
T
he opening quotation from William Bragg (a physicist who lived about a 
century ago) applies just as much to economics and other social sciences 
as it does to the natural sciences. Many of the facts that economists study 
are those that the media report every day—changes in national income, infla­
tion, unemployment, the trade balance, and so on. Economists develop models to 
provide new ways to think about these familiar facts. A good model is one that 
not only fits the facts but also offers new insights into them.
In the previous chapters, we have examined models that explain the economy 
both in the long run and in the short run. It might seem that, in some sense, 
our study of macroeconomic theory is complete. But to believe so would be a 
mistake. Like all scientists, economists never rest. There are always more questions 
to be answered, more refinements to be made. In this chapter and the next two, 
we look at some advances in macroeconomic theory that expand and refine our 
understanding of the forces that govern the economy.
This chapter presents a model that we will call the dynamic model of aggregate 
demand and aggregate supply. This model offers another lens through which we can 
view short-run fluctuations in output and inflation and the effects of monetary 
and fiscal policy on those fluctuations. As the name suggests, this new model 
emphasizes the dynamic nature of economic fluctuations. The dictionary defines 
the word “dynamic” as “relating to energy or objects in motion, characterized 
by continuous change or activity.” This definition applies readily to economic 
activity. The economy is continually bombarded by various shocks. These shocks 
not only have an immediate impact on the economy’s short-run equilibrium but 
also affect the subsequent path of output, inflation, and many other variables. The 
dynamic AD –AS model focuses attention on how output and inflation respond 
over time to changes in the economic environment.

C H A P T E R

440 |  P A R T  V   Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
In addition to placing greater emphasis on dynamics, the model differs from 
our previous models in another significant way: It explicitly incorporates the 
response of monetary policy to economic conditions. In previous chapters, we 
followed the conventional simplification that the central bank sets the money 
supply, which in turn is one determinant of the equilibrium interest rate. In the 
real world, however, many central banks set a target for the interest rate and allow 
the money supply to adjust to whatever level is necessary to achieve that target. 
Moreover, the target interest rate set by the central bank depends on economic 
conditions, including both inflation and output. The dynamic AD –AS model 
builds in these realistic features of monetary policy.
Although the dynamic AD –AS model is new to the reader, most of its com­
ponents are not. Many of the building blocks of this model will be familiar from 
previous chapters, even though they sometimes take on slightly different forms. 
More important, these components are assembled in new ways. You can think 
of this model as a new recipe that mixes familiar ingredients to create a surpris­
ingly original meal. In this case, we will mix familiar economic relationships in 
a new way to produce deeper insights into the nature of short-run economic 
fluctuations.
Compared to the models in preceding chapters, the dynamic AD –AS model 
is closer to those studied by economists at the research frontier. Moreover, econ­
omists involved in setting macroeconomic policy, including those working in 
central banks around the world, often use versions of this model when analyzing 
the impact of economic events on output and inflation.
 15-1  Elements of the Model
Before examining the components of the dynamic AD –AS model, we need 
to introduce one piece of notation: Throughout this chapter, the subscript t on 
a variable represents time. For example, Y is used to represent total output and 
national income, as it has been throughout this book. But now it takes the form 
Yt, which represents output in time period t. Similarly, Yt21 represents output in 
period t 2 1, and Yt11 represents output in period t 1 1. This new notation will 
allow us to keep track of variables as they change over time.
Let’s now look at the five equations that make up the dynamic AD –AS model.
Output: The Demand for Goods and Services
The demand for goods and services is given by the equation
Yt 5 Y–
t 2 a(rt 2 r) 1 et,
where Yt is the total output of goods and services,Y–
t is the economy’s natural 
level of output, rt is the real interest rate, et is a random demand shock, and a 
and r are parameters greater than zero. This equation is similar in spirit to the 
demand for goods and services equation in Chapter 3 and the IS equation in 

C H A P T E R  1 5   A Dynamic Model of Economic Fluctuations  | 441
Chapter 11. Because this equation is so central to the dynamic AD –AS model, 
let’s examine each of the terms with some care.
The key feature of this equation is the negative relationship between the real 
interest rate rt and the demand for goods and services Yt. When the real interest 
rate increases, borrowing becomes more expensive, and saving yields a greater 
reward. As a result, firms engage in fewer investment projects, and consumers 
save more and spend less. Both of these effects reduce the demand for goods and 
services. (In addition, the dollar might appreciate in foreign-exchange markets, 
causing net exports to fall, but for our purposes in this chapter these open-
economy effects need not play a central role and can largely be ignored.) The 
parameter a tells us how sensitive demand is to changes in the real interest rate. 
The larger the value of a, the more the demand for goods and services responds 
to a given change in the real interest rate.
The first term on the right-hand side of the equation,Y–
t, implies that the 
demand for goods and services Yt rises with the economy’s natural level of out­
put Y–
t. In most cases, we can simplify the analysis by assuming that Y–
t is constant 
(that is, the same for every time period t). Later in the chapter, however, we 
examine how this model can take into account long-run growth, represented by 
exogenous increases in Y–
t over time. Holding other things constant, as long-run 
growth increases the economy’s ability to supply goods and services (measured 
by the natural level of output), it also makes the economy richer and increases 
the demand for goods and services.
The last term in the demand equation, et, represents exogenous shifts in 
demand. Think of et as a random variable—a variable whose values are determined 
by chance. It is zero on average but fluctuates over time. For example, if (as Keynes 
famously suggested) investors are driven in part by “animal spirits”—irrational 
waves of optimism and pessimism—those changes in sentiment would be cap­
tured by et. When investors become optimistic, they increase their demand for 
goods and services, represented here by a positive value of et. When they become 
pessimistic, they cut back on spending, and et is negative.
Next, consider the parameter r. We call r the natural rate of interest because it is 
the real interest rate at which, in the absence of any shock, the demand for goods 
and services equals the natural level of output. That is, if et 5 0 and rt 5 r, then 
Yt 5 Y–
t. Later in the chapter, we see that the real interest rate rt tends to move 
toward the natural rate of interest r in the long run. Throughout this chapter, 
we assume that the natural rate of interest is constant (that is, the same in every 
period). Problem 7 at the end of the chapter examines what happens if it changes.
Finally, a word about how monetary and fiscal policy influences the demand 
for goods and services. Monetary policymakers affect demand by changing 
the real interest rate rt. Thus, their actions work through the second term in 
this equation. By contrast, when fiscal policymakers alter taxes or government 
spending, they change demand for any given interest rate. As a result, the vari­
able et captures changes in fiscal policy. An increase in government spending or 
a tax cut that stimulates consumer spending means a positive value of et. A cut 
in government spending or a tax hike means a negative value of et. As we will 
see, one purpose of this model is to examine the dynamic effects of changes in 
monetary and fiscal policy.

442 |  P A R T  V   Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
The Real Interest Rate: The Fisher Equation
The real interest rate in this model is defined as it has been in earlier chapters. 
The real interest rate rt is the nominal interest rate it minus the expected rate of 
future inflation Etpt11. That is,
rt 5 it 2 Etpt 11.
This Fisher equation is similar to the one we first saw in Chapter 5. Here, Etpt 11 
represents the expectation formed in period t of inflation in period t 1 1. The 
variable rt is the ex ante real interest rate: the real interest rate that people antici­
pate based on their expectation of inflation.
A word on the notation and timing convention should clarify the meaning of 
these variables. The variables rt and it are interest rates that prevail at time t and, 
therefore, represent a rate of return between periods t and t 1 1. The variable pt 
denotes the current inflation rate, which is the percentage change in the price 
level between periods t 2 1 and t. Similarly, pt11 is the percentage change in the 
price level that will occur between periods t and t 1 1. As of period t, pt 11 rep­
resents a future inflation rate and therefore is not yet known. In period t, people 
can form an expectation of pt 11 (written as Etpt 11), but they will have to wait 
until period t 1 1 to learn the actual value of pt 11 and whether their expectation 
was correct.
Note that the subscript on a variable tells us when the variable is determined. 
The nominal and ex ante real interest rates between t and t 1 1 are known at 
time t, so they are written as it and rt. By contrast, the inflation rate between t and 
t 1 1 is not known until time t 1 1, so it is written as pt 11.
This subscript rule also applies when the expectations operator E precedes a 
variable, but here you have to be especially careful. As in previous chapters, the 
operator E in front of a variable denotes the expectation of that variable prior 
to its realization. The subscript on the expectations operator tells us when that 
expectation is formed. So Etpt 11 is the expectation of what the inflation rate 
will be in period t 1 1 (the subscript on p) based on information available in 
period t (the subscript on E ). While the inflation rate pt 11 is not known until 
period t 1 1, the expectation of future inflation, Etpt 11, is known at period t. As 
a result, even though the ex post real interest rate, which is given by it 2 pt 11, will 
not be known until period t 1 1, the ex ante real interest rate, rt 5 it 2 Etpt 11, 
is known at time t.
Inflation: The Phillips Curve
Inflation in this economy is determined by a conventional Phillips curve aug­
mented to include roles for expected inflation and exogenous supply shocks. The 
equation for inflation is
pt 5 Et 21pt 1 f(Yt 2 Y–
t ) 1 yt.
This piece of the model is similar to the Phillips curve and short-run aggregate 
supply equation introduced in Chapter 14. According to this equation, inflation 

C H A P T E R  1 5   A Dynamic Model of Economic Fluctuations  | 443
pt depends on previously expected inflation Et 21pt, the deviation of output from 
its natural level (Yt 2 Y–
t  ), and an exogenous supply shock yt.
Inflation depends on expected inflation because some firms set prices in 
advance. When these firms expect high inflation, they anticipate that their costs 
will be rising quickly and that their competitors will be implementing substan­
tial price hikes. The expectation of high inflation thereby induces these firms to 
announce significant price increases for their own products. These price increases 
in turn cause high actual inflation in the overall economy. Conversely, when 
firms expect low inflation, they forecast that costs and competitors’ prices will 
rise only modestly. In this case, they keep their own price increases down, leading 
to low actual inflation.
The parameter f, which is greater than zero, tells us how much inflation 
responds when output fluctuates around its natural level. Other things equal, 
when the economy is booming and output rises above its natural level (Yt .Y–
t ), 
firms experience increasing marginal cost, so they raise prices; these price hikes 
increase inflation pt. When the economy is in a slump and output is below its 
natural level (Yt , Y–
t ), marginal cost falls, and firms cut prices; these price cuts 
reduce inflation pt. The parameter f reflects both how much marginal cost 
responds to the state of economic activity and how quickly firms adjust prices 
in response to changes in cost.
In this model, the state of the business cycle is measured by the deviation 
of output from its natural level (Yt 2 Y–
t ). The Phillips curves in Chapter 14 
sometimes emphasized the deviation of unemployment from its natural rate. 
This difference is not significant, however. Recall Okun’s law from Chap­
ter 10: short-run fluctuations in output and unemployment are strongly and 
negatively correlated. When output is above its natural level, unemployment 
is below its natural rate, and vice versa. As we continue to develop this model, 
keep in mind that unemployment fluctuates along with output, but in the 
opposite direction.
The supply shock yt is a random variable that averages to zero but can, in 
any given period, be positive or negative. This variable captures all influences on 
inflation other than expectations of inflation (which is captured in the first term, 
Et 21pt ) and short-run economic conditions [which are captured in the second 
term, f(Yt 2 Y–
t  )]. For example, if an aggressive oil cartel pushes up world oil 
prices, thus increasing overall inflation, that event would be represented by a pos­
itive value of yt. If cooperation within the oil cartel breaks down and world oil 
prices plummet, causing inflation to fall, yt would be negative. In short, yt reflects 
all exogenous events that directly influence inflation.
Expected Inflation: Adaptive Expectations
As we have seen, expected inflation plays a key role in both the Phillips curve 
equation for inflation and the Fisher equation relating nominal and real interest 
rates. To keep the dynamic AD –AS model simple, we assume that people form 
their expectations of inflation based on the inflation they have recently observed. 
That is, people expect prices to continue rising at the same rate they have been 

444 |  P A R T  V   Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
rising. As noted in Chapter 14, this is sometimes called the assumption of adaptive 
expectations. It can be written as
Etpt 11 5 pt.
When forecasting in period t what inflation rate will prevail in period t 1 1, 
people simply look at inflation in period t and extrapolate it forward.
The same assumption applies in every period. Thus, when inflation was 
observed in period t 2 1, people expected that rate to continue. This implies 
that Et 21pt 5 pt 21.
This assumption about inflation expectations is admittedly crude. Many 
people are probably more sophisticated in forming their expectations. As we 
discussed in Chapter 14, some economists advocate an approach called rational 
expectations, according to which people optimally use all available information 
when forecasting the future. Incorporating rational expectations into the model 
is, however, beyond the scope of this book. (Moreover, the empirical validity of 
rational expectations is open to dispute.) The assumption of adaptive expecta­
tions greatly simplifies the exposition of the theory without losing many of the 
model’s insights.
The Nominal Interest Rate: The Monetary-Policy Rule
The last piece of the model is the equation for monetary policy. We assume that 
the central bank sets a target for the nominal interest rate it based on inflation 
and output using this rule:
it 5 pt 1 r 1 up (pt 2 pt
* ) 1 uY  (Yt 2 Y–
t ).
In this equation, pt
* is the central bank’s target for the inflation rate. (For most 
purposes, target inflation can be assumed to be constant, but we will keep a 
time subscript on this variable so we can later examine what happens when 
the central bank changes its target.) Two key policy parameters are up and uY, 
which are both assumed to be greater than zero. They indicate how much the 
central bank allows the interest rate target to respond to fluctuations in inflation 
and output. The larger the value of up, the more responsive the central bank is 
to the deviation of inflation from its target; the larger the value of uY, the more 
responsive the central bank is to the deviation of output from its natural level. 
Recall that r, the constant in this equation, is the natural rate of interest (the real 
interest rate at which, in the absence of any shock, the demand for goods and 
services equals the natural level of output). This equation tells us how the central 
bank uses monetary policy to respond to any situation it faces. That is, it tells us 
how the target for the nominal interest rate chosen by the central bank responds 
to macroeconomic conditions.
To interpret this equation, it is best to focus not just on the nominal inter­
est rate it but also on the real interest rate rt. Recall that the demand for goods 
and services depends on the real interest rate, not on the nominal interest rate. 
So, although the central bank sets a target for the nominal interest rate it, the 

C H A P T E R  1 5   A Dynamic Model of Economic Fluctuations  | 445
bank’s influence on the economy works through the real interest rate rt. By defi­
nition, the real interest rate is rt 5 it 2 Etpt 11, but with our expectation equation 
Etpt11 5 pt, we can also write the real interest rate as rt 5 it 2 pt. According to 
the equation for monetary policy, if inflation is at its target (pt 5 pt
*) and output 
is at its natural level (Yt 5 Y–
t ), the last two terms in the equation are zero, so the 
real interest rate equals the natural rate of interest r. As inflation rises above its 
target (pt . pt
*) or output rises above its natural level (Yt . Y–
t  ), the real interest 
rate rises. And as inflation falls below its target (pt , pt
*) or output falls below 
its natural level (Yt , Y–
t ), the real interest rate falls.
At this point, one might naturally ask, “What about the money supply?” In 
previous chapters, such as Chapters 11 and 12, the money supply was typically 
taken to be the policy instrument of the central bank, and the interest rate 
adjusted to bring money supply and money demand into equilibrium. Here, we 
turn that logic on its head. The central bank is assumed to set a target for the 
nominal interest rate. It then adjusts the money supply to whatever level is neces­
sary to ensure that the equilibrium interest rate (which balances money supply 
and demand) hits the target.
The main advantage of using the interest rate, rather than the money sup­
ply, as the policy instrument in the dynamic AD –AS model is that it is more 
realistic. Today, most central banks, including the Federal Reserve, set a short-
term target for the nominal interest rate. Keep in mind, though, that hitting 
that target requires adjustments in the money supply. For this model, we do not 
need to specify the equilibrium condition for the money market, but we should 
remember that it is lurking in the background. When a central bank decides to 
change the interest rate, it is also committing itself to adjust the money supply 
accordingly.
CASE STUDY
The Taylor Rule
If you wanted to set interest rates to achieve low, stable inflation while avoid­
ing large fluctuations in output and employment, how would you do it? This is 
exactly the question that the governors of the Federal Reserve must ask them­
selves every day. The short-term policy instrument that the Fed now sets is the 
federal funds rate—the short-term interest rate at which banks make loans to one 
another. Whenever the Federal Open Market Committee meets, it chooses a 
target for the federal funds rate. The Fed’s bond traders are then told to conduct 
open-market operations to hit the desired target.
The hard part of the Fed’s job is choosing the target for the federal funds rate. 
Two general guidelines are clear. First, when inflation heats up, the federal funds 
rate should rise. An increase in the interest rate will mean a smaller money sup­
ply and, eventually, lower investment, lower output, higher unemployment, and 
reduced inflation. Second, when real economic activity slows—as reflected in 
real GDP or unemployment—the federal funds rate should fall. A decrease in the 
interest rate will mean a larger money supply and, eventually, higher investment, 

446 |  P A R T  V   Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
higher output, and lower unemployment. These two guidelines are represented 
by the monetary-policy equation in the dynamic AD –AS model.
The Fed needs to go beyond these general guidelines, however, and decide 
exactly how much to respond to changes in inflation and real economic activity. 
Stanford University economist John Taylor has proposed the following rule for 
the federal funds rate:1
Nominal Federal Funds Rate 5 Inflation 
	
1 2.0 1 0.5 (Inflation 2 2.0) 1 0.5 (GDP gap).
The GDP gap is the percentage by which real GDP deviates from an estimate 
of its natural level. (For consistency with our dynamic AD –AS model, the GDP 
gap here is taken to be positive if GDP rises above its natural level and negative 
if it falls below it.)
According to the Taylor rule, the real federal funds rate—the nominal rate minus 
inflation—should respond to inflation and the GDP gap. According to this rule, the 
real federal funds rate equals 2 percent when inflation is 2 percent and GDP is at 
its natural level. The first constant of 2 percent in this equation can be interpreted 
as an estimate of the natural rate of interest r, and the second constant of 2 percent 
subtracted from inflation can be interpreted as the Fed’s inflation target pt
*. For each 
percentage point that inflation rises above 2 percent, the real federal funds rate rises 
by 0.5 percent. For each percentage point that real GDP rises above its natural level, 
the real federal funds rate rises by 0.5 percent. If inflation falls below 2 percent or 
GDP moves below its natural level, the real federal funds rate falls accordingly.
In addition to being simple and reasonable, the Taylor rule for monetary 
policy also resembles actual Fed behavior in recent years. Figure 15-1 shows the 
actual nominal federal funds rate and the target rate as determined by Taylor’s 
proposed rule. Notice how the two series tend to move together. John Taylor’s 
monetary rule may be more than an academic suggestion. To some degree, it may 
be the rule that the Federal Reserve governors subconsciously follow.
Notice that if inflation and output are both low enough, the Taylor rule can 
prescribe a negative nominal interest rate. That circumstance in fact arose in the 
aftermath of the financial crisis and deep recession of 2008–2009. Such a policy 
is not feasible, however. As we saw in the discussion of the liquidity trap in Chap­
ter 12, a central bank cannot set a negative nominal interest rate because people 
would just hold currency (which pays a zero nominal return) instead of lending 
at a negative rate. In these circumstances, the Taylor rule cannot be strictly fol­
lowed. The closest a central bank can come to following the rule is to set the 
interest rate at about zero, as in fact the Fed did during this period.
The Taylor rule started recommending an increase in the federal funds rate 
around 2011. The Federal Reserve, however, kept the interest rates at about 
zero. This recent discrepancy has been a source of policy debate. Some econo­
mists argue that the Fed’s policy was appropriate to make up for the period 
when interest rates were above the negative levels the rule advised. That is, they

believe that to help the economy recover from the deep recession, a period of 
below-rule interest rates was needed to compensate for the preceding period of 
above-rule interest rates. Other economists, however, argue that the Fed was too 
slow to raise interest rates as the economy recovered from the recession. They 
fear that continued low interest rates might sow the seeds of future inflationary 
pressures. n
 15-2  Solving the Model
We have now looked at each of the pieces of the dynamic AD –AS model. As 
a quick summary, Table 15-1 lists the equations, variables, and parameters in the 
model. The variables are grouped according to whether they are endogenous (to 
be determined by the model) or exogenous (taken as given by the model).
FIGURE  15-1
The Federal Funds Rate: Actual and Suggested  This figure shows the federal funds rate 
set by the Federal Reserve and the target rate that the Taylor rule for monetary policy would 
recommend. Notice that the two series move closely together.
Sources: Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Department of Labor, and author’s 
calculations. To implement the Taylor rule, the inflation rate is measured as the percentage change in the GDP 
deflator over the previous four quarters, and the GDP gap is measured as negative 2 times the deviation of the 
unemployment rate from its natural rate (as shown in Figure 7-1).

The Equations, Variables, and Parameters in the Dynamic AD –AS Model
TABLE  15-1
The model’s five equations determine the paths of five endogenous variables: 
output Yt, the real interest rate rt, inflation pt, expected inflation Etpt 11, and the 
nominal interest rate it. In any period, the five endogenous variables are influ­
enced by the four exogenous variables in the equations as well as the previous 
period’s inflation rate. Lagged inflation pt 21 is called a predetermined variable. That 
is, it is a variable that was endogenous in the past but, because it is fixed by the 
time when we arrive in period t, is essentially exogenous for the purposes of 
finding the current equilibrium.

C H A P T E R  1 5   A Dynamic Model of Economic Fluctuations  | 449
We are almost ready to put these pieces together to see how various shocks 
to the economy influence the paths of these variables over time. Before doing so, 
however, we need to establish the starting point for our analysis: the economy’s 
long-run equilibrium.
The Long-Run Equilibrium
The long-run equilibrium represents the normal state around which the econ­
omy fluctuates. It occurs when there are no shocks (et 5 yt 5 0) and inflation 
has stabilized (pt 5 pt 21).
Straightforward algebra applied to the model’s five equations can be used to 
determine the long-run values of the five endogenous variables:
	
Yt 5 Y–
t.
	
rt 5 r.
	
pt 5 pt
*.
	
Etpt 11 5 pt
*.
	
it 5 r 1 pt
*.
In words, the long-run equilibrium is described as follows: output and the real 
interest rate are at their natural values, inflation and expected inflation are at the 
target rate of inflation, and the nominal interest rate equals the natural rate of 
interest plus target inflation.
The long-run equilibrium of this model reflects two related principles: the 
classical dichotomy and monetary neutrality. Recall that the classical dichotomy 
is the separation of real from nominal variables and that monetary neutrality 
is the property according to which monetary policy does not influence real 
variables. The equations immediately above show that the central bank’s infla­
tion target pt
* influences only inflation pt, expected inflation Etpt 11, and the 
nominal interest rate it. If the central bank raises its inflation target, then inflation, 
expected inflation, and the nominal interest rate all increase by the same amount. 
Monetary policy does not influence the real variables—output Yt and the real 
interest rate rt. In these ways, the long-run equilibrium of the dynamic AD –AS 
model mirrors the classical models we examined in Chapters 3 to 9.
The Dynamic Aggregate Supply Curve
To study the behavior of this economy in the short run, it is useful to analyze 
the model graphically. Because graphs have two axes, we need to focus on two 
variables. We will use output Yt and inflation pt as the variables on the two axes 
because these are the variables of central interest. As in the conventional AD –AS 
model, output will be on the horizontal axis. But because the price level has now 
faded into the background, the vertical axis in our graphs will now represent the 
inflation rate.

450 |  P A R T  V   Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
To generate this graph, we need two equations that summarize the relation­
ships between output Yt and inflation pt. These equations are derived from the 
five equations of the model we have already seen. To isolate the relationships 
between Yt and pt, however, we need to use a bit of algebra to eliminate the 
other three endogenous variables (rt, it, and Etpt 11).
The first relationship between output and inflation comes almost directly 
from the Phillips curve equation. We can get rid of the one endogenous variable 
in the equation (Et 21pt ) by using the expectations equation (Et 21pt 5 pt 21) to 
substitute past inflation pt 21 for expected inflation Et 21pt. With this substitution, 
the equation for the Phillips curve becomes
	
pt 5 pt 21 1 f(Yt 2 Y–
t) 1 yt.	
(DAS)
This equation relates inflation pt and output Yt for given values of two exogenous 
variables (natural output Y–
t and a supply shock yt ) and a predetermined variable 
(the previous period’s inflation rate pt 21).
Figure 15-2 graphs the relationship between inflation pt and output Yt 
described by this equation. We call this upward-sloping curve the dynamic 
aggregate supply curve, or DAS. The dynamic aggregate supply curve is similar 
to the aggregate supply curve we saw in Chapter 14, except that inflation 
rather than the price level is on the vertical axis. The DAS curve shows 
how inflation is related to output in the short run. Its upward slope reflects 
the Phillips curve: other things equal, higher levels of economic activity are 
associated with higher marginal costs of production and, therefore, higher 
inflation.
The DAS curve is drawn for given values of past inflation pt 21, the natural 
level of output Y–
t, and the supply shock yt. If any one of these three variables 
changes, the DAS curve shifts. One of our tasks ahead is to trace out the implica­
tions of such shifts. But first, we need another curve.

The Dynamic Aggregate Demand Curve
The dynamic aggregate supply curve is one of the two relationships between 
output and inflation that determine the economy’s short-run equilibrium. The 
other relationship is (no surprise) the dynamic aggregate demand curve. We 
derive it by combining four equations from the model and then eliminating 
all the endogenous variables other than output and inflation. Once we have an 
equation with only two endogenous variables (Yt and pt ), we can plot the rela­
tionship on our two-dimensional graph.
We begin with the demand for goods and services:
Yt 5 Y–
t 2 a(rt 2 r) 1 et.
To eliminate the endogenous variable rt, the real interest rate, we use the Fisher 
equation to substitute it 2 Etpt 11 for rt:
Yt 5 Y–
t 2 a(it 2 Etpt 11 2 r) 1 et.
To eliminate another endogenous variable, the nominal interest rate it, we use the 
monetary-policy equation to substitute for it:
Yt 5 Y–
t 2 a[pt 1 r 1 up(pt 2 pt
* ) 1 uY (Yt 2 Y–
t ) 2 Etpt 11 2 r] 1 et.
Next, to eliminate the endogenous variable of expected inflation Etpt 11, we use 
our equation for inflation expectations to substitute pt for Etpt 11:
Yt 5 Y–
t 2 a[pt 1 r 1 up(pt 2 pt
* ) 1 uY (Yt 2 Y–
t ) 2 pt 2 r] 1 et.
As was our goal, this equation has only two endogenous variables: output Yt and 
inflation pt. We can now simplify it. Notice that the positive pt and r inside the 
brackets cancel the negative ones. The equation then becomes
Yt 5 Y–
t 2 a[up(pt 2 pt
* ) 1 uY (Yt 2 Y–
t )] 1 et.
If we now bring like terms together and solve for Yt, we obtain
	
Yt 5 Y–
t 2 [aup/(1 1 auY)](pt 2 pt
* ) 1 [1/(1 1 auY)]et.	
(DAD)
This equation relates output Yt to inflation pt for given values of three exog­
enous variables (Y–
t, pt
*, and et ). In words, it says output equals the natural level 
of output when inflation is on target (pt 5 pt
* ) and there is no demand shock 
(et 5 0). Output rises above its natural level if inflation is below target (pt , pt
* ) 
or if the demand shock is positive (et . 0). Output falls below its natural level if 
inflation is above target (pt . pt
* ) or if the demand shock is negative (et , 0).
Figure 15-3 graphs the relationship between inflation pt and output Yt 
described by this equation. We call this downward-sloping curve the dynamic 
aggregate demand curve, or DAD. The DAD curve shows how the quantity of 
output demanded is related to inflation in the short run. It is drawn holding 
constant the exogenous variables in the equation: the natural level of output 
Y–
t, the inflation target pt
*, and the demand shock et. If any one of these three 
exogenous variables changes, the DAD curve shifts. We will examine the effect 
of such shifts shortly.

452 |  P A R T  V   Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
It is tempting to think of this dynamic aggregate demand curve as nothing 
more than the standard aggregate demand curve from Chapter 12 with inflation, 
rather than the price level, on the vertical axis. In some ways, they are similar: they 
both embody the link between the interest rate and the demand for goods and 
services. But there is an important difference. The conventional aggregate demand 
curve in Chapter 12 is drawn for a given money supply. By contrast, because the 
monetary-policy rule is used to derive the dynamic aggregate demand equation, 
the dynamic aggregate demand curve is drawn for a given rule for monetary 
policy. Under that rule, the central bank sets the interest rate based on macroeco­
nomic conditions, and it allows the money supply to adjust accordingly.
The dynamic aggregate demand curve slopes downward because of the fol­
lowing mechanism. When inflation rises, the central bank responds by following 
its rule and increasing the nominal interest rate. Because the rule specifies that 
the central bank raise the nominal interest rate by more than the increase in 
inflation, the real interest rate rises as well. The increase in the real interest rate 
reduces the quantity of goods and services demanded. This negative association 
between inflation and quantity demanded, working through central bank policy, 
makes the dynamic aggregate demand curve slope downward.
The dynamic aggregate demand curve shifts in response to changes in fiscal 
and monetary policy. As we noted earlier, the shock variable et reflects changes 
in government spending and taxes (among other things). Any change in fiscal 
policy that increases the demand for goods and services means a positive value 
of et and a shift of the DAD curve to the right. Any change in fiscal policy that 
decreases the demand for goods and services means a negative value of et and a 
shift of the DAD curve to the left.
Monetary policy enters the dynamic aggregate demand curve through the 
target inflation rate pt
*. The DAD equation shows that, other things equal, an 
increase in pt
* raises the quantity of output demanded. (There are two negative 
FIGURE  15-3
The Dynamic Aggregate Demand 
Curve  The dynamic aggregate 
demand curve shows a negative 
association between output and 
inflation. Its downward slope reflects 
monetary policy and the demand for 
goods and services: a high level of 
inflation causes the central bank to 
raise nominal and real interest rates, 
which in turn reduces the demand 
for goods and services. The dynamic 
aggregate demand curve is drawn 
for given values of the natural level 
of output Yt, the inflation target pt
*, 
and the demand shock et. When 
these exogenous variables change, 
the curve shifts.

signs in front of pt
*, so the effect is positive.) Here is the mechanism that lies 
behind this mathematical result: When the central bank raises its target for infla­
tion, it pursues a more expansionary monetary policy by reducing the nominal 
interest rate, as dictated by the monetary-policy rule. For any given rate of infla­
tion, the lower nominal interest rate in turn means a lower real interest rate, and a 
lower real interest rate stimulates spending on goods and services. Thus, output is 
higher for any given inflation rate, so the dynamic aggregate demand curve shifts 
to the right. Conversely, when the central bank reduces its target for inflation, it 
raises nominal and real interest rates, thereby dampening demand for goods and 
services and shifting the dynamic aggregate demand curve to the left.
The Short-Run Equilibrium
The economy’s short-run equilibrium is determined by the intersection of the 
dynamic aggregate demand curve and the dynamic aggregate supply curve. The 
economy can be represented algebraically using the two equations we have just 
derived:
	
Yt 5 Y–
t 2 [aup/(1 1 auY)](pt 2 pt
* ) 1 [1/(1 1 auY)]et.	
(DAD)
	
pt 5 pt 21 1 f(Yt 2 Y–
t ) 1 yt.	
(DAS )
In any period t, these equations together determine two endogenous variables: 
inflation pt and output Yt. The solution depends on five other variables that are 
exogenous (or at least determined prior to period t). These exogenous (and pre­
determined) variables are the natural level of output Y–
t, the central bank’s target 
inflation rate pt
*, the shock to demand et, the shock to supply yt, and the previous 
period’s rate of inflation pt 21.
Taking these exogenous variables as given, we can illustrate the economy’s 
short-run equilibrium as the intersection of the dynamic aggregate demand 
curve and the dynamic aggregate supply curve, as in Figure 15-4. The short-run 
equilibrium level of output Yt can be less than its natural level Y–
t, as it is in this 
figure, greater than its natural level, or equal to it. As we have seen, when the 
economy is in long-run equilibrium, output is at its natural level (Yt 5 Y–
t).
The short-run equilibrium determines not only the level of output Yt but 
also the inflation rate pt. In the subsequent period (t 1 1), this inflation rate 
will become the lagged inflation rate that influences the position of the dynamic 
aggregate supply curve. This connection between periods generates the dynamic 
patterns that we examine in the next section. That is, one period of time is linked 
to the next through expectations about inflation. A shock in period t affects 
inflation in period t, which in turn affects the inflation that people expect for 
period t 1 1. Expected inflation in period t 1 1 in turn affects the position of 
the dynamic aggregate supply curve in that period, which in turn affects output 
and inflation in period t 1 1, which then affects expected inflation in period 
t 1 2, and so on.
These linkages of economic outcomes across time periods will become clear 
as we work through a series of examples.

 15-3    Using the Model
Let’s now use the dynamic AD –AS model to analyze how the economy 
responds to changes in the exogenous variables. The four exogenous variables 
in the model are the natural level of output Y–
t, the supply shock yt, the demand 
shock et, and the central bank’s inflation target pt
*. To keep things simple, we 
assume that the economy always begins in long-run equilibrium and is then 
subject to a change in one of the exogenous variables. We also assume that the 
other exogenous variables are held constant.
Long-Run Growth
The economy’s natural level of output Y–
t grows over time because of population 
growth, capital accumulation, and technological progress, as discussed in Chap­
ters 8 and 9. For our purposes here, we can take such growth as exogenous—
that is, determined outside of this model. Figure 15-5 illustrates the effect of an 
exogenous increase in Y–
t. Because the natural level of output affects both the 
dynamic aggregate demand curve and the dynamic aggregate supply curve, both 
curves shift. In fact, they both shift to the right by exactly the amount that Y–
t 
has increased.
The shifts in these curves move the economy’s equilibrium in the figure from 
point A to point B. Output Yt increases by exactly as much as the natural level Y–
t. 
Inflation is unchanged.
The story behind these conclusions is as follows: When the natural level 
of output increases, the economy can produce a larger quantity of goods and 
services. This is represented by the rightward shift in the dynamic aggregate 
supply curve. At the same time, the increase in the natural level of output 
makes people richer. Other things equal, they want to buy more goods 
FIGURE  15-4
The Short-Run Equilibrium  The 
short-run equilibrium is determined 
by the intersection of the dynamic

dynamic aggregate supply curve. 
This equilibrium determines the 
inflation rate and level of output 
that prevail in period t. In the equi­
librium shown in this figure, the 
short-run equilibrium level of output 
Yt falls short of the economy’s natu­
ral level of output Y–
t.

and services. This is represented by the rightward shift in the dynamic aggre­
gate demand curve. The simultaneous shifts in supply and demand increase 
the economy’s output without putting either upward or downward pressure 
on inflation. In this way, the economy can experience long-run growth and 
a stable inflation rate.
A Shock to Aggregate Supply
Consider now a shock to aggregate supply. In particular, suppose that yt rises to 
1 percent for one period and subsequently returns to zero. This shock to the 
Phillips curve might occur, for example, because turmoil in the Middle East 
pushes up world oil prices or because new union agreements raise wages and, 
thereby, the costs of production. In general, the supply shock yt captures any 
event that influences inflation other than expected inflation Et 21pt and current 
economic activity, as measured by Yt 2 Y–
t.
Figure 15-6 shows the result. In period t, when the shock occurs, the dynamic 
aggregate supply curve shifts upward from DASt 21 to DASt. To be precise, the 
curve shifts upward by exactly the size of the shock, which we assumed to be 
1 percentage point. Because the supply shock yt is not a variable in the dynamic 
aggregate demand equation, the DAD curve is unchanged. Therefore, the econ­
omy moves along the dynamic aggregate demand curve from point A to point 
B. As the figure illustrates, the supply shock in period t causes inflation to rise to 
pt and output to fall to Yt.

These effects work in part through the reaction of monetary policy to the shock. 
When the supply shock causes inflation to rise, the central bank responds by follow­
ing its policy rule and raising nominal and real interest rates. The higher real interest 
rate reduces the quantity of goods and services demanded, which depresses output 
below its natural level. (This series of events is represented by the movement along the 
DAD curve from point A to point B.) The lower level of output dampens the infla­
tionary pressure to some degree, so inflation rises somewhat less than the initial shock.
In the periods after the shock occurs, expected inflation is higher because 
expectations depend on past inflation. In period t 1 1, for instance, the economy 
is at point C. Even though the shock variable yt returns to its normal value of zero, 
the dynamic aggregate supply curve does not immediately return to its initial 
position. Instead, it slowly shifts back downward toward its initial position DASt 21 
as a lower level of economic activity reduces inflation and thereby expectations of 
future inflation. Eventually, the economy finds itself back at point A. Throughout 
the transition process, however, output remains below its natural level.
As the economy responds to the supply shock by moving in Figure 15-6 from 
point A to B to C and then gradually back to point A, all the variables in the 
model respond accordingly. Figure 15-7 shows the time paths of the key vari­
ables. (These simulations are based on realistic parameter values: see the nearby 
FYI box for their description.) As panel (a) shows, the shock yt spikes upward by 
1 percentage point in period t and then returns to zero in subsequent periods.

Inflation, shown in panel (d), rises by 0.9 percentage point and slowly returns to 
its target of 2 percent over a long period of time. Output, shown in panel (b), 
falls in response to the supply shock but also gradually returns to its natural level.
Figure 15-7 also shows the paths of nominal and real interest rates. In the peri­
od of the supply shock, the nominal interest rate, shown in panel (e), increases by 
1.2 percentage points, and the real interest rate, in panel (c), increases by 0.3 per­
centage point. Both interest rates return to their normal values as the economy 
returns to its long-run equilibrium.

The Numerical Calibration and Simulation
The text presents some numerical simulations of 
the dynamic AD –AS model. When interpreting 
these results, it is easiest to think of each period 
as representing one year. We examine the impact 
of the change in the year of the shock (period t) 
and over the subsequent 12 years.
The simulations use these parameter values:
Y–
t 5 100.
pt* 5 2.0.
a 5 1.0.
r 5 2.0.
f 5 0.25.
up 5 0.5.
uY 5 0.5.
Here is how to interpret these numbers. The natu­
ral level of output Y–
t is 100; as a result of choosing 
this convenient number, fluctuations in Yt  Y–
t can 
be viewed as percentage deviations of output from 
its natural level. The central bank’s inflation target 
pt* is 2 percent. The parameter a 5 1.0 implies 
that a 1-percentage-point increase in the real 
interest rate reduces output demand by 1, which 
is 1 percent of its natural level. The economy’s 
natural rate of interest r is 2 percent. The Phillips 
curve parameter f 5 0.25 implies that when out­
put is 1 percent above its natural level, inflation 
rises by 0.25 percentage point. The parameters for 
the monetary policy rule up 5 0.5 and uY 5 0.5 
are those suggested by John Taylor and are rea­
sonable approximations of the Federal Reserve’s 
behavior.
In all cases, the simulations assume a change 
of 1 percentage point in the exogenous variable 
of interest. Larger shocks would have qualitative­
ly similar effects, but the magnitudes would be 
proportionately greater. For example, a shock of 
3 percentage points would affect all the variables 
in the same way as a shock of 1 percentage point, 
but the movements would be three times as large 
as those in the simulation shown.
The graphs of the time paths of the variables 
after a shock (shown in Figures 15-7, 15-9, 
and 15-11) are called impulse response functions. 
The word “impulse” refers to the shock, and 
“response function” refers to how the endog­
enous variables respond to the shock over time. 
These simulated impulse response functions are 
one way to illustrate how the model works. They 
show how the endogenous variables move when 
a shock hits the economy, how these variables 
adjust in subsequent periods, and how they are 
correlated with one another over time.
F Y I
These figures illustrate the phenomenon of stagflation in the dynamic AD –AS 
model. A supply shock causes inflation to rise, which in turn increases expected 
inflation. As the central bank applies its rule for monetary policy and responds by 
raising interest rates, it gradually squeezes inflation out of the system, but only at 
the cost of a prolonged downturn in economic ­activity.
A Shock to Aggregate Demand
Now let’s consider a shock to aggregate demand. To be realistic, the shock is 
assumed to persist over several periods. In particular, suppose that et 5 1 for five 
periods and then returns to its normal value of zero. This positive shock et might 
represent, for example, a war that increases government purchases or a stock mar­
ket bubble that increases wealth and thereby consumption spending. In general, 
the demand shock captures any event that influences the demand for goods and 
services for given values of the natural level of output Y–
t and the real interest rate rt.

C H A P T E R  1 5   A Dynamic Model of Economic Fluctuations  | 459
Figure 15-8 shows the result. In period t, when the shock occurs, the dynamic 
aggregate demand curve shifts to the right from DADt1 to DADt. Because the 
demand shock et is not a variable in the dynamic aggregate supply equation, the 
DAS curve is unchanged from period t  1 to period t. The economy moves 
along the dynamic aggregate supply curve from point A to point B. Output and 
inflation both increase.
Once again, these effects work in part through the reaction of monetary poli­
cy to the shock. When the demand shock causes output and inflation to rise, the 
central bank responds by increasing the nominal and real interest rates. Because 
a higher real interest rate reduces the quantity of goods and services demanded, 
it partly offsets the expansionary effects of the demand shock.
A Demand Shock  This figure shows the effects of a positive 
demand shock in period t that lasts for five periods. The shock imme­
diately shifts the dynamic aggregate demand curve to the right from 
DADt 1 to DADt. The economy moves from point A to point B. Both 
inflation and output rise. In the next period, the dynamic aggregate 
supply curve shifts to DASt 11 because of increased expected inflation. 
The economy moves from point B to point C, and then in subsequent 
periods to points D, E, and F. When the demand shock disappears 
after five periods, the dynamic aggregate demand curve shifts back to 
its initial position, and the economy moves from point F to point G. 
Output falls below its natural level, and inflation starts to fall. Over 
time, the dynamic aggregate supply curve starts shifting downward, 
and the economy gradually returns to its initial equilibrium, point A.

In the periods after the shock occurs, expected inflation is higher because 
expectations depend on past inflation. As a result, the dynamic aggregate supply 
curve shifts upward repeatedly; as it does so, it continually reduces output and 
increases inflation. In the figure, the economy goes from point B in the initial 
period of the shock to points C, D, E, and F in subsequent periods.
In the sixth period (t 1 5), the demand shock disappears. At this time, 
the dynamic aggregate demand curve returns to its initial position. However, 
the economy does not immediately return to its initial equilibrium, point A. The 
period of high demand has increased inflation and thereby expected inflation. 
High expected inflation keeps the dynamic aggregate supply curve higher than it 
was initially. As a result, when demand falls off, the economy’s equilibrium moves 
to point G, and output falls to Yt15, which is below its natural level. The economy 
then gradually recovers, as the low level of output squeezes the higher-than-
target inflation out of the system. Over time, as inflation and expected inflation 
fall, the economy slowly returns to point A.
Figure 15-9 shows the time path of the key variables in the model in response to 
the demand shock. Note that the positive demand shock increases real and nomi­
nal interest rates. When the demand shock disappears, both interest rates fall. These 
responses occur because when the central bank sets the nominal interest rate, it 
takes into account both inflation rates and deviations of output from its natural level.
A Shift in Monetary Policy
Suppose that the central bank decides to reduce its target for the inflation rate. 
Specifically, imagine that, in period t, pt 
* falls from 2 percent to 1 percent and 
thereafter remains at that lower level. Let’s consider how the economy will react 
to this change in monetary policy.
Recall that the inflation target enters the model as an exogenous variable in the 
dynamic aggregate demand curve. When the inflation target falls, the DAD curve 
shifts to the left, as shown in Figure 15-10. (To be precise, it shifts downward by 
exactly 1 percentage point.) Because target inflation does not enter the dynamic 
aggregate supply equation, the DAS curve does not shift initially. The economy 
moves from its initial equilibrium, point A, to a new equilibrium, point B. Output 
falls below its natural level. Inflation falls as well, but not by than the full 1 per­
centage point by which the central bank has lowered its inflation target.
Monetary policy is, not surprisingly, key to the explanation of this outcome. 
Because the central bank has just lowered its target for inflation, current infla­
tion is running above the new target. The central bank reacts by following its 
policy rule and raising real and nominal interest rates. The higher real interest 
rate reduces the demand for goods and services. The Phillips curve tells us that 
when output falls, inflation falls as well.
Lower inflation, in turn, reduces the inflation rate that people expect to prevail 
in the next period. In period t 1 1, lower expected inflation shifts the dynamic 
aggregate supply curve downward, to DASt 11. (To be precise, the curve shifts 
downward by exactly the fall in expected inflation.) This shift moves the econ­
omy from point B to point C, further reducing inflation and expanding output. 
Over time, as inflation continues to fall toward the new 1 percent target and the

long-run equilibrium at point Z, where output is back at its natural level (Yfinal 
5 Y–
all) and inflation is at its new lower target (pfinal 5 1 percent).
Figure 15-11 shows the response of the variables over time to a reduction in tar­
get inflation. Note in panel (e) the time path of the nominal interest rate it. Before 
the change in policy, the nominal interest rate is at its long-run value of 4.0 percent 
(which equals the natural real interest rate r of 2 percent plus target inflation pt 1
* of 
2 percent). When target inflation falls to 1 percent, the nominal interest rate rises 
to 4.2 percent. Over time, however, the nominal interest rate falls as inflation and 
expected inflation fall toward the new target rate; eventually, it approaches its new

A Reduction in Target Inflation  A permanent reduction in target 
inflation in period t shifts the dynamic aggregate demand curve to the 
left from DADt 1 to DADt, where it then stays. Initially, the economy 
moves from point A to point B. Both inflation and output fall. In the 
subsequent period, because expected inflation falls, the dynamic aggre­
gate supply curve shifts downward. The economy moves from point B 
to point C in period t 1 1. Over time, as expected inflation falls and the 
dynamic aggregate supply curve repeatedly shifts downward, the econ­
omy approaches a new equilibrium at point Z. Output returns to its

long-run value of 3.0 percent. Thus, a shift toward a lower inflation target increases 
the nominal interest rate in the short run but decreases it in the long run.
We close with a caveat: Throughout this analysis we have maintained the 
assumption of adaptive expectations. That is, we have assumed that people 
form their expectations of inflation based on the inflation they have recently 
experienced. It is possible, however, that if the central bank makes a credible 
announcement of its new policy of lower target inflation, people will respond 
by immediately altering their expectations of inflation. That is, they may form 
expectations rationally, based on the policy announcement, rather than adap­
tively, based on what they have experienced. (We discussed this possibility in 
­Chapter  14.) If so, the dynamic aggregate supply curve will shift downward 
immediately upon the change in policy, just when the dynamic aggregate 
demand curve shifts downward. In this case, the economy will instantly reach its 
new long-run equilibrium. By contrast, if people do not believe an announced 
policy of low inflation until they see it, then the assumption of adaptive expec­
tations is appropriate, and the transition path to lower inflation will involve a 
period of lost output, as shown in Figure 15-11.

 15-4   Two Applications: Lessons for 
Monetary Policy
So far in this chapter, we have assembled a dynamic model of inflation and output 
and used it to show how various shocks affect the time paths of output, inflation, and 
interest rates. We now use the model to shed light on the design of monetary policy.
It is worth pausing at this point to consider what we mean by “the design of mon­
etary policy.” So far in this analysis, the central bank has had a simple role: it merely 

464 |  P A R T  V   Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
had to adjust the money supply to ensure that the nominal interest rate hit the target 
level prescribed by the monetary-policy rule. The two key parameters of that policy 
rule are up (the responsiveness of the target interest rate to inflation) and uY (the 
responsiveness of the target interest rate to output). We have taken these parameters as 
given without discussing how they are chosen. Now that we know how the model 
works, we can consider a deeper question: What should the parameters of the mon­
etary policy rule be?
The Tradeoff Between Output Variability and Inflation 
Variability
Consider the impact of a supply shock on output and inflation. According to 
the dynamic AD –AS model, the impact of this shock depends crucially on the 
slope of the dynamic aggregate demand curve. In particular, the slope of the 
DAD curve determines whether a supply shock has a large or small impact on 
output and inflation.
This phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 15-12. In the two panels of this fig­
ure, the economy experiences the same supply shock. In panel (a), the dynamic 
aggregate demand curve is nearly flat, so the shock has a small effect on inflation 
but a large effect on output. In panel (b), the dynamic aggregate demand curve 
is steep, so the shock has a large effect on inflation but a small effect on output.
Why is this important for monetary policy? Because the central bank can 
influence the slope of the dynamic aggregate demand curve. Recall the equation 
for the DAD curve:
Yt 5 Y–
t 2 [aup/(1 1 auY)](pt 2 pt
* ) 1 [1/(1 1 auY)]et.
Two key parameters here are up and uY, which govern how much the central 
bank’s interest rate target responds to changes in inflation and output. When the 
central bank chooses these policy parameters, it determines the slope of the DAD 
curve and thus the economy’s short-run response to supply shocks.
On the one hand, suppose that, when setting the interest rate, the central bank 
responds strongly to inflation (up is large) and weakly to output (uY is small). 
In this case, the coefficient on inflation in the above equation is large. That is, a 
small change in inflation has a large effect on output. As a result, the dynamic 
aggregate demand curve is relatively flat, and supply shocks have large effects on 
output but small effects on inflation. The story goes like this: When the economy 
experiences a supply shock that pushes up inflation, the central bank’s policy rule 
has it respond vigorously with higher interest rates. Sharply higher interest rates 
significantly reduce the quantity of goods and services demanded, thereby lead­
ing to a large recession that dampens the inflationary impact of the shock (which 
was the purpose of the monetary policy response).
On the other hand, suppose that, when setting the interest rate, the central 
bank responds weakly to inflation (up is small) but strongly to output (uY is large). 
In this case, the coefficient on inflation in the above equation is small, which 
means that even a large change in inflation has only a small effect on output. 
As a result, the dynamic aggregate demand curve is relatively steep, and supply

Two Possible 
Responses to a

a small effect on infla­
tion but a large effect 
on output. When the 
dynamic aggregate 
demand curve is rela­
tively steep, as in panel

shock has a large effect 
on inflation but a small 
effect on output. The 
slope of the dynamic 
aggregate demand 
curve is based in part 
on the parameters of 
monetary policy (up 
and uY), which describe 
how much interest rates 
respond to changes in 
inflation and output. 
When choosing these 
parameters, the central 
bank faces a tradeoff 
between the variability 
of inflation and the 
variability of output.

shocks have small effects on output but large effects on inflation. The story is 
just the opposite as before: Now, when the economy experiences a supply shock 
that pushes up inflation, the central bank’s policy rule has it respond with only 
slightly higher interest rates. This small policy response avoids a large recession 
but accommodates the inflationary shock.
In its choice of monetary policy, the central bank determines which of these 
two scenarios will play out. That is, when setting the policy parameters up and 
uY, the central bank chooses whether to make the economy look more like panel 
(a) or more like panel (b) of Figure 15-12. When making this choice, the central 
FIGURE  15-12

466 |  P A R T  V   Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
bank faces a tradeoff between output variability and inflation variability. The 
central bank can be a hard-line inflation fighter, as in panel (a), in which case 
inflation is stable but output is volatile. Alternatively, it can be more accommoda­
tive, as in panel (b), in which case inflation is volatile but output is more stable. 
It can also choose some position in between these two extremes.
One job of a central bank is to promote economic stability. There are, how­
ever, various dimensions to this goal. When there are tradeoffs to be made, the 
central bank has to determine what kind of stability to pursue. The dynamic 
AD –AS model shows that one fundamental tradeoff is between the variability 
in inflation and the variability in output.
Note that this tradeoff is very different from a simple tradeoff between infla­
tion and output. In the long run of this model, inflation goes to its target, and 
output goes to its natural level. Consistent with classical macroeconomic theory, 
policymakers do not face a long-run tradeoff between inflation and output. 
Instead, they face a choice about which of these two measures of macroeco­
nomic performance they want to stabilize. When deciding on the parameters of 
the monetary-policy rule, they determine whether supply shocks lead to infla­
tion variability, output variability, or some combination of the two.
Different Mandates, Different Realities: 
The Fed Versus the ECB
According to the dynamic AD –AS model, a key policy choice facing any cen­
tral bank concerns the parameters of its policy rule. The monetary parameters 
up and uY determine how much the interest rate responds to macroeconomic 
conditions. As we have just seen, these responses in turn determine the volatility 
of inflation and output.
The U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) appear to 
have different approaches to this decision. The legislation that created the Fed states 
explicitly that its goal is “to promote effectively the goals of maximum employ­
ment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” Because the Fed is 
supposed to stabilize both employment and prices, it is said to have a dual mandate. 
(The third goal—moderate long-term interest rates—should follow naturally from 
stable prices.) By contrast, the ECB says on its Web site that “the primary objective 
of the ECB’s monetary policy is to maintain price stability. The ECB aims at infla­
tion rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.” All other macroeco­
nomic goals, including stability of output and employment, appear to be secondary.
We can interpret these differences in light of our model. Compared to the 
Fed, the ECB seems to give more weight to inflation stability and less weight to 
output stability. This difference in objectives should be reflected in the param­
eters of the monetary-policy rules. To achieve its dual mandate, the Fed would 
respond more to output and less to inflation than the ECB would.
The financial crisis of 2008–2009 illustrates these differences. In 2008, the world 
economy was experiencing rising oil prices, a financial crisis, and a slowdown in

The Taylor Principle
How much should the nominal interest rate set by the central bank respond to 
changes in inflation? The dynamic AD –AS model does not give a definitive 
answer, but it does offer an important guideline.
Recall the equation for monetary policy:
it 5 pt 1 r 1 up (pt  pt
* ) 1 uY (Yt  Y–
t ),
where up and uY are parameters that measure how much the interest rate set by 
the central bank responds to inflation and output. In particular, according to this 
equation, a 1-percentage-point increase in inflation pt induces an increase in 
the nominal interest rate it of 1 1 up percentage points. Because we assume that 
up is greater than zero, whenever inflation increases, the central bank raises the 
nominal interest rate by an even larger amount.
The assumption that up . 0 has important implications for the behavior of 
the real interest rate. Recall that the real interest rate is rt 5 it  Etpt 11. With 
our assumption of adaptive expectations, it can also be written as rt 5 it  pt. As 
a result, if an increase in inflation pt leads to a greater increase in the nominal 
interest rate it, it leads to an increase in the real interest rate rt as well. As you may 
recall from earlier in this chapter, this fact was a key part of our explanation for 
why the dynamic aggregate demand curve slopes downward.
Imagine, however, that the central bank behaved differently and, instead, 
increased the nominal interest rate by less than the increase in inflation. In this 
economic activity. The Fed responded to these events by lowering its target inter­
est rate from 4.25 percent at the beginning of the year to a range of 0 to 0.25 per­
cent at year’s end. The ECB, facing a similar situation, also cut interest rates, but 
by much less—from 3 percent to 2 percent. It cut the interest rate to 0.25 percent 
only in 2009, when the depth of the recession was clear and inflationary worries 
had subsided. Throughout this episode, the ECB was less concerned about reces­
sion and more concerned about keeping inflation in check.
Although the dynamic AD –AS model predicts that, other things equal, the 
policy of the ECB should lead to more variable output and more stable inflation, 
testing this prediction is difficult. In practice, other things are rarely equal. Europe 
and the United States differ in many ways beyond the policies of their central 
banks. For example, in 2010, several European nations, most notably Greece, 
came close to defaulting on their government debt. This Eurozone crisis reduced 
confidence and aggregate demand around the world, but the impact was much 
larger on Europe than on the United States.
As this book was going to press in late 2014, the two central banks faced very 
different situations. In the United States, unemployment had fallen considerably 
since the Great Recession of 2008–2009, and inflation was only slightly below 
the Fed’s 2-percent target. By contrast, in Europe, unemployment remained 
high, and inflation was running less than 0.5 percent. With interest rates at the 
zero lower bound, ECB President Mario Draghi was struggling to find ways to 
increase aggregate demand and pull European inflation up to its target. n

468 |  P A R T  V   Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
case, the monetary policy parameter up would be less than zero. This change 
would profoundly alter the model. Recall that the dynamic aggregate demand 
equation is:
Yt 5 Y–
t 2 [aup/(1 1 auY)](pt 2 pt
* ) 1 [1/(1 1 auY)]et.
If up is negative, then an increase in inflation increases the quantity of output 
demanded. To understand why, keep in mind what is happening to the real 
interest rate. If an increase in inflation leads to a smaller increase in the nomi­
nal interest rate (because up , 0), then the real interest rate decreases. The lower 
real interest rate reduces the cost of borrowing, which in turn increases the 
quantity of goods and services demanded. Thus, a negative value of up means the 
dynamic aggregate demand curve slopes upward.
An economy with up , 0 and an upward-sloping DAD curve can run into 
some serious problems. In particular, inflation can become unstable. Suppose, 
for example, there is a positive shock to aggregate demand that lasts for only a 
single period. Normally, such an event would have only a temporary effect on 
the economy, and the inflation rate would over time return to its target (similar 
to the analysis illustrated in Figure 15-9). If up , 0, however, events unfold very 
differently:
	 1.	The positive demand shock increases output and inflation in the period in 
which it occurs.
	 2.	Because expectations are determined adaptively, higher inflation increases 
expected inflation.
	 3.	Because firms set their prices based in part on expected inflation, higher 
expected inflation leads to higher actual inflation in subsequent periods 
(even after the demand shock has dissipated).
	 4.	Higher inflation causes the central bank to raise the nominal interest rate. 
But because up , 0, the central bank increases the nominal interest rate by 
less than the increase in inflation, so the real interest rate declines.
	 5.	The lower real interest rate increases the quantity of goods and services 
demanded above the natural level of output.
	 6.	With output above its natural level, firms face higher marginal costs, and 
inflation rises yet again.
	 7.	The economy returns to step 2.
The economy finds itself in a vicious circle of ever-higher inflation and expected 
inflation. Inflation spirals out of control.
Figure 15-13 illustrates this process. Suppose that in period t there is a one-
time positive shock to aggregate demand. That is, for one period only, the 
dynamic aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, to DADt; in the next period, 
it returns to its original position. In period t, the economy moves from point A 
to point B. Output and inflation rise. In the next period, because higher infla­
tion has increased expected inflation, the dynamic aggregate supply curve shifts 
upward, to DASt 11. The economy moves from point B to point C. But because 

C H A P T E R  1 5   A Dynamic Model of Economic Fluctuations  | 469
the dynamic aggregate demand curve is now upward sloping, output remains 
above its natural level, even though demand shock has disappeared. Thus, infla­
tion rises yet again, shifting the DAS curve farther upward in the next period, 
moving the economy to point D. And so on. Inflation continues to rise with no 
end in sight.
The dynamic AD –AS model leads to a strong conclusion: For inflation 
to be stable, the central bank must respond to an increase in inflation with an even 
greater increase in the nominal interest rate. This conclusion is sometimes called the 
Taylor principle, after economist John Taylor, who emphasized its impor­
tance in the design of monetary policy. (As we saw earlier, in his proposed 
Taylor rule, Taylor suggested that up should equal 0.5). Most of our analysis in 
this chapter assumed that the Taylor principle holds; that is, we assumed that 
up . 0. We can see now that there is good reason for a central bank to adhere 
to this guideline.

The Importance of the Taylor Principle  This figure 
shows the impact of a demand shock in an economy 
that does not satisfy the Taylor principle, so the dynamic 
aggregate demand curve is upward sloping. A demand 
shock moves the DAD curve to the right for one period, 
to DADt, and the economy moves from point A to point 
B. Both output and inflation increase. The rise in inflation 
increases expected inflation and, in the next period, shifts 
the dynamic aggregate supply curve upward to DASt11. 
Therefore, in period t 1 1, the economy then moves from 
point B to point C. Because the DAD curve is upward 
sloping, output is still above the natural level, so infla­
tion continues to increase. In period t 1 2, the economy 
moves to point D, where output and inflation are even 
higher. Inflation spirals out of control.

What Caused the Great Inflation?
In the 1970s, inflation in the United States got out of hand. As we saw in previ­
ous chapters, the inflation rate during this decade reached double-digit levels. 
Rising prices were widely considered the major economic problem of the time. 
In 1979, Paul Volcker, the recently appointed chairman of the Federal Reserve, 
announced a change in monetary policy that eventually brought inflation back 
under control. Volcker and his successor, Alan Greenspan, then presided over low 
and stable inflation for the next quarter century.
The dynamic AD –AS model offers a new perspective on these events. 
According to research by monetary economists Richard Clarida, Jordi Gali, and 
Mark Gertler, the key is the Taylor principle. Clarida and colleagues examined 
the data on interest rates, output, and inflation and estimated the parameters of 
the monetary-policy rule. They found that the Volcker–Greenspan monetary 
policy obeyed the Taylor principle, whereas earlier monetary policy did not. In 
particular, the parameter up (which measures the responsiveness of interest rates 
to inflation in the monetary-policy rule) was estimated to be 0.72 during the 
Volcker–Greenspan regime after 1979, close to Taylor’s proposed value of 0.5, 
but it was 20.14 during the pre-Volcker era from 1960 to 1978.
2 The negative 
value of up during the pre-Volcker era means that monetary policy did not sat­
isfy the Taylor principle. In other words, the pre-Volcker Fed was not responding 
strongly enough to inflation.
This finding suggests a potential cause of the great inflation of the 1970s. 
When the U.S. economy was hit by demand shocks (such as government 
spending on the Vietnam War) and supply shocks (such as the OPEC oil-price 
increases), the Fed raised the nominal interest rate in response to rising inflation 
but not by enough. Therefore, despite the increase in the nominal interest rate, 
the real interest rate fell. This insufficient monetary response failed to squash the 
inflation that arose from these shocks. Indeed, the decline in the real interest rate 
increased the quantity of goods and services demanded, thereby exacerbating 
the inflationary pressures. The problem of spiraling inflation was not solved until 
the monetary-policy rule was changed to include a more vigorous response of 
interest rates to inflation.
An open question is why policymakers were so passive in the earlier era. Here 
are some conjectures from Clarida, Gali, and Gertler:
Why is it that during the pre-1979 period the Federal Reserve followed a rule that 
was clearly inferior? Another way to look at the issue is to ask why it is that the 
Fed maintained persistently low short-term real rates in the face of high or rising 
inflation. One possibility . . . is that the Fed thought the natural rate of unemploy­
ment at this time was much lower than it really was (or equivalently, that the output 
gap was much smaller). . . .

 15-5    Conclusion: Toward DSGE Models
If you go on to take more advanced courses in macroeconomics, you will likely 
learn about a class of models called dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium 
models, often abbreviated as DSGE models. These models are dynamic because 
they trace the path of variables over time. They are stochastic because they incor­
porate the inherent randomness of economic life. They are general equilibrium 
because they take into account the fact that everything depends on everything 
else. In many ways, they are the state-of-the-art models in the analysis of short-
run economic fluctuations.
The dynamic AD –AS model we have presented in this chapter is a simpli­
fied version of these DSGE models. Unlike analysts using advanced DSGE 
models, we have not started with the household and firm optimizing decisions 
that underlie macroeconomic relationships. But the macro relationships that 
this chapter has posited are similar to those found in more sophisticated DSGE 
models. The dynamic AD –AS model is a good stepping-stone between the 
basic model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply we saw in earlier chap­
ters and the more complex DSGE models you might see in a more advanced 
course.3
The dynamic AD –AS model also yields some important lessons. It shows 
how various macroeconomic variables—output, inflation, and real and nominal 
interest rates—respond to shocks and interact with one another over time. It 
demonstrates that, in the design of monetary policy, central banks face a tradeoff 
between variability in inflation and variability in output. Finally, it suggests that 
central banks need to respond vigorously to inflation to prevent it from getting 
out of control. If you ever find yourself running a central bank, these are good 
lessons to keep in mind.
Another somewhat related possibility is that, at that time, neither the Fed 
nor the economics profession understood the dynamics of inflation very well. 
Indeed, it was not until the mid-to-late 1970s that intermediate textbooks 
began emphasizing the absence of a long-run trade-off between inflation and 
output. The ideas that expectations may matter in generating inflation and that 
credibility is important in policymaking were simply not well established dur­
ing that era. What all this suggests is that in understanding historical economic 
behavior, it is important to take into account the state of policymakers’ knowl­
edge of the economy and how it may have evolved over time. n

Summary
	1.	The dynamic model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply combines 
five economic relationships: an equation for the goods market, which 
relates quantity demanded to the real interest rate; the Fisher equation, 
which relates real and nominal interest rates; the Phillips curve equation, 
which determines inflation; an equation for expected inflation; and a rule 
for monetary policy, according to which the central bank sets the nominal 
interest rate as a function of inflation and output.
	2.	The long-run equilibrium of the model is classical. Output and the real 
interest rate are at their natural levels, independent of monetary policy. The 
central bank’s inflation target determines inflation, expected inflation, and 
the nominal interest rate.
	3.	The dynamic AD –AS model can be used to determine the immediate 
impact on the economy of any shock and can also be used to trace out the 
effects of the shock over time.
	4.	Because the parameters of the monetary-policy rule influence the slope 
of the dynamic aggregate demand curve, they determine whether a sup­
ply shock has a greater effect on output or inflation. When choosing the 
parameters for monetary policy, a central bank faces a tradeoff between out­
put variability and inflation variability.
	5.	The dynamic AD –AS model typically assumes that the central bank responds 
to a 1-percentage-point increase in inflation by increasing the nominal inter­
est rate by more than 1 percentage point, so the real interest rate rises as 
well. If the central bank responds less vigorously to inflation, the economy 
becomes unstable. A shock can send inflation spiraling out of control.

	1.	Derive the long-run equilibrium for the dynam­
ic AD –AS model. Assume there are no shocks 
to demand or supply (et 5 yt 5 0) and infla­
tion has stabilized (pt 5 pt21), and then use the 
five equations in Table 15-1 to derive the value 
of each variable in the model. Be sure to show 
each step you follow.
	2.	Suppose the monetary-policy rule has the 
wrong natural rate of interest. That is, the central 
bank follows this rule:
it 5 pt 1 r 1 up(pt 2 pt

	where r does not equal r, the natural rate of 
interest in the goods demand equation. The rest 
of the dynamic AD –AS model is the same as in

under this policy rule. Explain in words the 
intuition behind your solution.

makes sense.
	4.	The sacrifice ratio is the accumulated loss in out­
put that results when the central bank lowers its 
target for inflation by 1 percentage point. For 
the parameters used in the text simulation (see

Explain.
	5.	The text analyzes the case of a temporary shock 
to the demand for goods and services. Suppose, 
however, that et were to increase permanently. 
What would happen to the economy over time? 
In particular, would the inflation rate return 
to its target in the long run? Why or why not? 
(Hint: It might be helpful to solve for the long-
run equilibrium without the assumption that et 
equals zero.) How might the central bank alter 
its policy rule to deal with this issue?
	6.	Suppose a central bank does not satisfy the 
Taylor principle; in particular, assume that up is 
slightly less than zero, so the nominal interest 
rate rises less than one-for-one with inflation. 
Use a graph similar to figure 15-13 to analyze 
the impact of a supply shock. Does this analysis 
contradict or reinforce the Taylor principle as a 
guideline for the design of monetary policy?
	7.	The text assumes that the natural rate of interest 
r is a constant parameter. Suppose instead that 
it varies over time, so now it has to be written 
as rt.

for dynamic aggregate demand and dynamic 
aggregate supply?

tion, the nominal interest rate, and the real

central bank might face if rt varied over time?

are subject to random shocks. That is, instead 
of being merely adaptive, expected inflation in 
period t, as seen in period t 2 1, is Et 21pt 5

This shock is normally zero, but it deviates from

reason people come to believe that inflation 
in period t 1 1 is going to be higher, so ht is

Understanding Consumer Behavior
Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production.
—Adam Smith
H
ow do households decide how much of their income to consume today 
and how much to save for the future? This is a microeconomic question 
because it addresses the behavior of individual decisionmakers. Yet its 
answer has important macroeconomic consequences. As we have seen in previ­
ous chapters, households’ consumption decisions affect the way the economy as 
a whole behaves both in the long run and in the short run.
The consumption decision is crucial for long-run analysis because of its role 
in economic growth. The Solow growth model of Chapters 8 and 9 shows that 
the saving rate is a key determinant of the steady-state capital stock and thus 
of the level of economic well-being. The saving rate measures how much of its 
income the present generation is not consuming but is instead putting aside for 
its own future and for future generations.
The consumption decision is crucial for short-run analysis because of its role 
in determining aggregate demand. Consumption is two-thirds of GDP, so fluc­
tuations in consumption are a key element of booms and recessions. The IS–LM 
model of Chapters 11 and 12 shows that changes in consumers’ spending plans 
can be a source of shocks to the economy and that the marginal propensity to 
consume is a determinant of the fiscal-policy multipliers.
In previous chapters we explained consumption with a function that relates 
consumption to disposable income: C 5 C(Y 2 T). This approximation allowed 
us to develop simple models for long-run and short-run analysis, but it is too 
simple to provide a complete explanation of consumer behavior. In this chapter we 
examine the consumption function in greater detail and develop a more thorough 
explanation of what determines aggregate consumption.
Since macroeconomics began as a field of study, many economists have writ­
ten about the theory of consumer behavior and suggested alternative ways of 
interpreting the data on consumption and income. This chapter presents the 
views of six prominent economists to show the diverse approaches to explaining 
consumption.

 16-1   John Maynard Keynes and the 
Consumption Function
We begin our study of consumption with John Maynard Keynes’s General 
Theory, which was published in 1936. Keynes made the consumption function 
central to his theory of economic fluctuations, and it has played a key role in 
macroeconomic analysis ever since. Let’s consider what Keynes thought about 
the consumption function and then see what puzzles arose when his ideas were 
confronted with the data.
Keynes’s Conjectures
Today, economists who study consumption rely on sophisticated techniques of 
data analysis. With the help of computers, they analyze aggregate data on the 
behavior of the overall economy from the national income accounts and detailed 
data on the behavior of individual households from surveys. Because Keynes 
wrote in the 1930s, however, he had neither the advantage of these data nor the 
computers necessary to analyze such large data sets. Instead of relying on statisti­
cal analysis, Keynes made conjectures about the consumption function that were 
based on introspection and casual observation.
First and most important, Keynes conjectured that the marginal propensity 
to consume—the amount consumed out of an additional dollar of income—is 
between zero and one. He wrote that the “fundamental psychological law, upon 
which we are entitled to depend with great confidence, . . . is that men are dis­
posed, as a rule and on the average, to increase their consumption as their income 
increases, but not by as much as the increase in their income.” That is, when a 
person earns an extra dollar, he typically spends some of it and saves some of it. 
As we saw in Chapter 11 when we developed the Keynesian cross, the marginal 
propensity to consume was crucial to Keynes’s policy recommendations for how 
to reduce widespread unemployment. The power of fiscal policy to influence 
the economy—as expressed by the fiscal-policy multipliers—arises from the 
feedback between income and consumption.
Second, Keynes posited that the ratio of consumption to income, called the 
average propensity to consume, falls as income rises. He believed that saving 
was a luxury, so he expected the rich to save a higher proportion of their income 
than the poor. Although not essential for Keynes’s own analysis, the postulate that 
the average propensity to consume falls as income rises became a central part of 
early Keynesian economics.
Third, Keynes thought that income is the primary determinant of consumption 
and that the interest rate does not have an important role. This conjecture stood in 
stark contrast to the beliefs of the classical economists who preceded him. The clas­
sical economists held that a higher interest rate encourages saving and discourages 
consumption. Keynes admitted that the interest rate could influence consumption 
as a matter of theory. Yet he wrote that “the main conclusion suggested by experi­
ence, I think, is that the short-period influence of the rate of interest on individual 
spending out of a given income is secondary and relatively unimportant.”

C H A P T E R  1 6   Understanding Consumer Behavior  | 477
On the basis of these three conjectures, the Keynesian consumption function 
is often written as
C 5 C– 1 cY,      C– . 0, 0 , c , 1,
where C is consumption, Y is disposable income, C– is a constant, and c is the mar­
ginal propensity to consume. This consumption function, shown in Figure 16-1, 
is graphed as a straight line. C– determines the intercept on the vertical axis, and 
c determines the slope.
Notice that this consumption function exhibits the three properties that 
Keynes posited. It satisfies Keynes’s first property because the marginal propen­
sity to consume c is between zero and one, so that higher income leads to higher 
consumption and also to higher saving. This consumption function satisfies 
Keynes’s second property because the average propensity to consume APC is
APC 5 C/Y 5 C– /Y 1 c.
As Y rises, C–/Y falls, and so the average propensity to consume C/Y falls. And 
finally, this consumption function satisfies Keynes’s third property because the 
interest rate is not included in this equation as a determinant of consumption.
The Early Empirical Successes
Soon after Keynes proposed the consumption function, economists began col­
lecting and examining data to test his conjectures. The earliest studies indicated 
that the Keynesian consumption function was a good approximation of how 
consumers behave.
In some of these studies, researchers surveyed households and collected data 
on consumption and income. They found that households with higher income 
consumed more, which confirms that the marginal propensity to consume is

sumption function with the 
three properties that Keynes 
conjectured. First, the 
marginal propensity to con­
sume c is between zero and 
one. Second, the average 
propensity to consume falls 
as income rises. Third, con­
sumption is determined by 
current income.

function. The average propensity to consume, APC 5 C/Y, equals the slope of a 
line drawn from the origin to a point on the consumption function.

greater than zero. They also found that households with higher income saved 
more, which confirms that the marginal propensity to consume is less than 
one. In addition, these researchers found that higher-income households saved 
a larger fraction of their income, which confirms that the average propensity 
to consume falls as income rises. Thus, these data verified Keynes’s conjectures 
about the marginal and average propensities to consume.
In other studies, researchers examined aggregate data on consumption and 
income for the period between the two world wars. These data also supported 
the Keynesian consumption function. In years when income was unusually low, 
such as during the depths of the Great Depression, both consumption and sav­
ing were low, indicating that the marginal propensity to consume is between 
zero and one. In addition, during those years of low income, the ratio of con­
sumption to income was high, confirming Keynes’s second conjecture. Finally, 
because the correlation between income and consumption was so strong, no 
other variable appeared to be important for explaining consumption. Thus, the 
data also confirmed Keynes’s third conjecture that income is the primary deter­
minant of how much people choose to consume.
Secular Stagnation, Simon Kuznets, and the 
Consumption Puzzle
Although the Keynesian consumption function met with early successes, two 
anomalies soon arose. Both concern Keynes’s conjecture that the average pro­
pensity to consume falls as income rises.
The first anomaly became apparent after some economists made a dire—and, 
it turned out, erroneous—prediction during World War II. On the basis of the 
Keynesian consumption function, these economists reasoned that as incomes in 
the economy grew over time, households would consume a smaller and smaller 
fraction of their incomes. They feared that there might not be enough profitable 
investment projects to absorb all this saving. If so, the low consumption would lead 
to an inadequate demand for goods and services, resulting in a depression once the 
wartime demand from the government ceased. In other words, on the basis of the 
Keynesian consumption function, these economists predicted that the economy 
would experience what they called secular stagnation—a long depression of indefinite 
duration—unless the government used fiscal policy to expand aggregate demand.
Fortunately for the economy, but unfortunately for the Keynesian consumption 
function, the end of World War II did not throw the country into another depres­
sion. Although incomes were much higher after the war than before, these higher 
incomes did not lead to large increases in the rate of saving. Keynes’s conjecture that 
the average propensity to consume would fall as income rose appeared not to hold.
The second anomaly arose when economist Simon Kuznets constructed new 
aggregate data on consumption and income dating back to 1869. Kuznets assem­
bled these data in the 1940s and would later receive the Nobel Prize for this 
work. He discovered that the ratio of consumption to income was remarkably 
stable from decade to decade, despite large increases in income over the period 
he studied. Again, Keynes’s conjecture that the average propensity to consume 
would fall as income rose appeared not to hold.

C H A P T E R  1 6   Understanding Consumer Behavior  | 479
The failure of the secular-stagnation hypothesis and the findings of Kuznets 
both indicated that the average propensity to consume is fairly constant over 
long periods of time. This fact presented a puzzle that motivated much of the 
subsequent research on consumption. Economists wanted to know why some 
studies confirmed Keynes’s conjectures and others refuted them. That is, why 
did Keynes’s conjectures hold up well in the studies of household data and in 
the studies of short time-series but fail when long time-series were examined?
Figure 16-2 illustrates the puzzle. The evidence suggested that there were 
two consumption functions. For the household data and for the short time-
series, the Keynesian consumption function appeared to work well. Yet for 
the long time-series, the consumption function appeared to exhibit a constant 
average propensity to consume. In Figure 16-2, these two relationships between 
consumption and income are called the short-run and long-run consumption 
functions. Economists needed to explain how these two consumption functions 
could be consistent with each other.
In the 1950s, Franco Modigliani and Milton Friedman each proposed expla­
nations of these seemingly contradictory findings. Both economists later won 
Nobel Prizes, in part because of their work on consumption. But before we see 
how Modigliani and Friedman tried to solve the consumption puzzle, we must 
discuss Irving Fisher’s contribution to consumption theory. Both Modigliani’s 
life-cycle hypothesis and Friedman’s permanent-income hypothesis rely on the 
theory of consumer behavior proposed much earlier by Irving Fisher.
The Consumption 
Puzzle  Studies of house­
hold data and short time-
series found a relationship 
between consumption and 
income similar to the one 
Keynes conjectured. In the 
figure, this relationship is 
called the short-run con­
sumption function. But 
studies of long time-series 
found that the average 
propensity to consume did 
not vary systematically with 
income. This relationship 
is called the long-run con­
sumption function. Notice 
that the short-run con­
sumption function has a 
falling average propensity to 
consume, whereas the long-
run consumption function 
has a constant average pro­
pensity to consume.

 16-2  Irving Fisher and 
Intertemporal Choice
The consumption function introduced by Keynes relates current consumption to 
current income. This relationship, however, is incomplete at best. When people 
decide how much to consume and how much to save, they consider both the 
present and the future. The more consumption they enjoy today, the less they will 
be able to enjoy tomorrow. In making this tradeoff, households must look ahead 
to the income they expect to receive in the future and to the consumption of 
goods and services they hope to be able to afford.
The economist Irving Fisher developed the model with which economists 
analyze how rational, forward-looking consumers make intertemporal choices—
that is, choices involving different periods of time. Fisher’s model illuminates the 
constraints consumers face, the preferences they have, and how these constraints 
and preferences together determine their choices about consumption and saving.
The Intertemporal Budget Constraint
Most people would prefer to increase the quantity or quality of the goods and 
services they consume—to wear nicer clothes, eat at better restaurants, or see 
more movies. The reason people consume less than they desire is that their con­
sumption is constrained by their income. In other words, consumers face a limit 
on how much they can spend, called a budget constraint. When they are deciding 
how much to consume today versus how much to save for the future, they face 
an intertemporal budget constraint, which measures the total resources 
available for consumption today and in the future. Our first step in developing 
Fisher’s model is to examine this constraint in some detail.
To keep things simple, we examine the decision facing a consumer who lives 
for two periods. Period one represents the consumer’s youth, and period two 
represents the consumer’s old age. The consumer earns income Y1 and consumes 
C1 in period one, and earns income Y2 and consumes C2 in period two. (All 
variables are real—that is, adjusted for inflation.) Because the consumer has the 
opportunity to borrow and save, consumption in any single period can be either 
greater or less than income in that period.
Consider how the consumer’s income in the two periods constrains con­
sumption in the two periods. In the first period, saving equals income minus 
consumption. That is,
S 5 Y1 2 C1,
where S is saving. In the second period, consumption equals the accumulated 
saving, including the interest earned on that saving, plus second-period income. 
That is,
C2 5 (1 1 r)S 1 Y2,
where r is the real interest rate. For example, if the real interest rate is 5 percent, 
then for every $1 of saving in period one, the consumer enjoys an extra $1.05 of 

C H A P T E R  1 6   Understanding Consumer Behavior  | 481
consumption in period two. Because there is no third period, the consumer does 
not save in the second period.
Note that the variable S can represent either saving or borrowing and that 
these equations hold in both cases. If first-period consumption is less than first-
period income, the consumer is saving, and S is greater than zero. If first-period 
consumption exceeds first-period income, the consumer is borrowing, and S is 
less than zero. For simplicity, we assume that the interest rate for borrowing is 
the same as the interest rate for saving.
To derive the consumer’s budget constraint, combine the two preceding 
equations. Substitute the first equation for S into the second equation to obtain
C2 5 (1 1 r)(Y1 2 C1) 1 Y2.
To make the equation easier to interpret, we must rearrange terms. To place all 
the consumption terms together, bring (1 1 r)C1 from the right-hand side to 
the left-hand side of the equation to obtain
(1 1 r)C1 1 C2 5 (1 1 r)Y1 1 Y2.
Now divide both sides by 1 1 r to obtain
C1 1 C2
1 1 r 5 Y1 1 Y2
1 1 r .
This equation relates consumption in the two periods to income in the two 
periods. It is the standard way of expressing the consumer’s intertemporal budget 
constraint.
The consumer’s budget constraint is easily interpreted. If the interest rate is zero, 
the budget constraint shows that total consumption in the two periods equals total 
income in the two periods. In the usual case in which the interest rate is greater 
than zero, future consumption and future income are discounted by a factor 1 1 r. 
This discounting arises from the interest earned on savings. In essence, because the 
consumer earns interest on current income that is saved, future income is worth less 
than current income. Similarly, because future consumption is paid for out of savings 
that have earned interest, future consumption costs less than current consumption. 
The factor 1/(1 1 r) is the price of second-period consumption measured in terms 
of first-period consumption: it is the amount of first-period consumption that the 
consumer must forgo to obtain 1 unit of second-period consumption.
Figure 16-3 graphs the consumer’s budget constraint. Three points are 
marked on this figure. At point A, the consumer consumes exactly his income 
in each period (C1 5 Y1 and C2 5 Y2), so there is neither saving nor borrow­
ing between the two periods. At point B, the consumer consumes nothing in 
the first period (C1 5 0) and saves all income, so second-period consumption 
C2 is (1 1 r)Y1 1 Y2. At point C, the consumer plans to consume nothing in 
the second period (C2 5 0) and borrows as much as possible against second-
period income, so first-period consumption C1 is Y1 1 Y2/(1 1 r). These are 
only three of the many combinations of first- and second-period consumption 
that the consumer can afford: all the points on the line from B to C are available 
to the consumer.

The Consumer’s Budget Constraint  
This figure shows the combinations of 
first-period and second-period consump­
tion the consumer can choose. If he 
chooses points between A and B, he 
consumes less than his income in the first 
period and saves the rest for the second 
period. If he chooses points between 
A and C, he consumes more than his 
income in the first period and borrows 
to make up the difference.

The use of discounting in the consumer’s budget 
constraint illustrates an important fact of eco­
nomic life: a dollar in the future is less valuable 
than a dollar today. This is true because a dollar 
today can be deposited in an interest-bearing 
bank account and produce more than one dollar 
in the future. If the interest rate is 5 percent, for 
instance, then a dollar today can be turned into 
$1.05 dollars next year, $1.1025 in two years, 
$1.1576 in three years, . . . , or $2.65 in 20 years.
Economists use a concept called present value 
to compare dollar amounts from different times. 
The present value of any amount in the future is 
the amount that would be needed today, given 
available interest rates, to produce that future 
amount. Thus, if you are going to be paid X dol­
lars in T years and the interest rate is r, then the 
present value of that payment is
Present Value 5 X/(1 1 r)T.
Present Value, or Why a $1,000,000 Prize Is Worth 
Only $623,000
In light of this definition, we can see a new interpre­
tation of the consumer’s budget constraint in our 
two-period consumption problem. The intertem­
poral budget constraint states that the present 
value of consumption must equal the present value 
of income.
The concept of present value has many appli­
cations. Suppose, for instance, that you won 
a million-dollar lottery. Such prizes are usu­
ally paid out over time—say, $50,000 a year for 
20 years. What is the present value of such a 
delayed prize? By applying the above formula 
to each of the 20 payments and adding up the 
result, we learn that the million-dollar prize, 
discounted at an interest rate of 5 percent, has 
a present value of about $623,000. (If the prize 
were paid out as a dollar a year for a million 
years, the present value would be a mere $20!) 
Sometimes a million dollars isn’t all it’s cracked 
up to be.

Consumer Preferences
The consumer’s preferences regarding consumption in the two periods can be 
represented by indifference curves. An indifference curve shows the combina­
tions of first-period and second-period consumption that make the consumer 
equally happy.
Figure 16-4 shows two of the consumer’s many indifference curves. The 
consumer is indifferent among combinations W, X, and Y because they are all 
on the same curve. Not surprisingly, if the consumer’s first-period consumption 
is reduced—say, from point W to point X—second-period consumption must 
increase to keep him equally happy. If first-period consumption is reduced again, 
from point X to point Y, the amount of extra second-period consumption he 
requires for compensation is greater.
The slope at any point on the indifference curve shows how much second-
period consumption the consumer requires in order to be compensated for 
a 1-unit reduction in first-period consumption. This slope is the marginal 
rate of substitution between first-period consumption and second-period 
consumption. It tells us the rate at which the consumer is willing to substitute 
second-period consumption for first-period consumption.
Notice that the indifference curves in Figure 16-4 are not straight lines; as a 
result, the marginal rate of substitution depends on the levels of consumption 
in the two periods. When first-period consumption is high and second-period 
consumption is low, as at point W, the marginal rate of substitution is low: the 
consumer requires only a little extra second-period consumption to give up 
1 unit of first-period consumption. When first-period consumption is low and 
second-period consumption is high, as at point Y, the marginal rate of substitu­
tion is high: the consumer requires much additional second-period consumption 
to give up 1 unit of first-period consumption.
The Consumer’s 
Preferences  Indifference 
curves represent the con­
sumer’s preferences over first-
period and second-period 
consumption. An indifference 
curve gives the combinations 
of consumption in the two 
periods that make the con­
sumer equally happy. This 
figure shows two of many 
indifference curves. Higher 
indifference curves such as IC2 
are preferred to lower curves 
such as IC1. The consumer is 
equally happy at points W, X, 
and Y but prefers point Z to 
points W, X, or Y.

484 |  P A R T  V   Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
The consumer is equally happy at all points on a given indifference curve, but 
he prefers some indifference curves to others. Because he prefers more consump­
tion to less, he prefers higher indifference curves to lower ones. In Figure 16-4, 
the consumer prefers any of the points on curve IC2 to any of the points on 
curve IC1.
The set of indifference curves gives a complete ranking of the consumer’s 
preferences. It tells us that the consumer prefers point Z to point W, but that 
should be obvious because point Z has more consumption in both periods. Yet 
compare point Z and point Y: point Z has more consumption in period one and 
less in period two. Which is preferred, Z or Y? Because Z is on a higher indiffer­
ence curve than Y, we know that the consumer prefers point Z to point Y. Hence, 
we can use the set of indifference curves to rank any combinations of first-period 
and second-period consumption.
Optimization
Having discussed the consumer’s budget constraint and preferences, we can 
consider the decision about how much to consume in each period of time. 
The consumer would like to end up with the best possible combination of 
consumption in the two periods—that is, on the highest possible indifference 
curve. But the budget constraint requires that the consumer also end up on 
or below the budget line because the budget line measures the total resources 
available to him.
Figure 16-5 shows that many indifference curves cross the budget line. The 
highest indifference curve that the consumer can obtain without violating the 
budget constraint is the indifference curve that just barely touches the budget 
line, which is curve IC3 in the figure. The point at which the curve and line 
The Consumer’s Optimum 
The consumer achieves his 
highest level of satisfaction 
by choosing the point 
on the budget constraint 
that is on the highest 
indifference curve. At the 
optimum, the indifference 
curve is tangent to the 
budget constraint.

touch—point O, for “optimum”—is the best combination of consumption in 
the two periods that the consumer can afford.
Notice that, at the optimum, the slope of the indifference curve equals the 
slope of the budget line. The indifference curve is tangent to the budget line. 
The slope of the indifference curve is the marginal rate of substitution MRS, 
and the slope of the budget line is 1 plus the real interest rate. We conclude that 
at point O
MRS 5 1 1 r.
The consumer chooses consumption in the two periods such that the marginal 
rate of substitution equals 1 plus the real interest rate.
How Changes in Income Affect Consumption
Now that we have seen how the consumer makes the consumption decision, 
let’s examine how consumption responds to an increase in income. An increase 
in either Y1 or Y2 shifts the budget constraint outward, as in Figure 16-6. The 
higher budget constraint allows the consumer to choose a better combination of 
first- and second-period consumption—that is, the consumer can now reach a 
higher indifference curve.
In Figure 16-6, the consumer responds to the shift in his budget constraint 
by choosing more consumption in both periods. Although it is not implied 
by the logic of the model alone, this situation is the most usual. If a consumer 
wants more of a good when his income rises, economists call it a normal 
good. The indifference curves in Figure 16-6 are drawn under the assump­
tion that consumption in period one and consumption in period two are both 
normal goods.
An Increase in Income  
An increase in either first-
period income or second-
period income shifts the 
budget constraint outward. 
If consumption in period 
one and consumption in 
period two are both normal 
goods, this increase in 
income raises consumption 
in both periods.

The key conclusion from Figure 16-6 is that regardless of whether the 
increase in income occurs in the first period or the second period, the consumer 
spreads it over consumption in both periods. This behavior is sometimes called 
consumption smoothing. Because the consumer can borrow and lend between 
periods, the timing of the income is irrelevant to how much is consumed today 
(except that future income is discounted by the interest rate). The lesson of this 
analysis is that consumption depends on the present value of current and future 
income, which can be written as
Present Value of Income 5 Y1 1 Y2
1 1 r .
Notice that this conclusion is quite different from that reached by Keynes. Keynes 
posited that a person’s current consumption depends largely on his current income. Fisher’s 
model says, instead, that consumption is based on the income the consumer expects over 
his entire lifetime.
How Changes in the Real Interest Rate 
Affect Consumption
Let’s now use Fisher’s model to consider how a change in the real interest rate 
alters the consumer’s choices. There are two cases to consider: the case in which 
the consumer is initially saving and the case in which he is initially borrowing. 
Here we discuss the saving case; Problem 1 at the end of the chapter asks you to 
analyze the borrowing case.
Figure 16-7 shows that an increase in the real interest rate rotates the consum­
er’s budget line around the point (Y1, Y2) and, thereby, alters the amount of con­
sumption he chooses in both periods. Here, the consumer moves from point A 
to point B. You can see that for the indifference curves drawn in this figure, first-
period consumption falls and second-period consumption rises.
Economists decompose the impact of an increase in the real interest rate on 
consumption into two effects: an income effect and a substitution effect. 
Textbooks on microeconomics discuss these effects in detail. We summarize 
them briefly here.
The income effect is the change in consumption that results from the movement 
to a higher indifference curve. Because the consumer is a saver rather than a 
borrower (as indicated by the fact that first-period consumption is less than first-
period income), the increase in the interest rate makes him better off (as reflected 
by the movement to a higher indifference curve). If consumption in period one 
and consumption in period two are both normal goods, the consumer will want 
to spread this improvement in his welfare over both periods. This income effect 
tends to make the consumer want more consumption in both periods.
The substitution effect is the change in consumption that results from the change 
in the relative price of consumption in the two periods. In particular, consump­
tion in period two becomes less expensive relative to consumption in period 
one when the interest rate rises. That is, because the real interest rate earned on 

C H A P T E R  1 6   Understanding Consumer Behavior  | 487
saving is higher, the consumer must now give up less first-period consumption 
to obtain an extra unit of second-period consumption. This substitution effect 
tends to make the consumer choose more consumption in period two and less 
consumption in period one.
The consumer’s choice depends on both the income effect and the substitu­
tion effect. Because both effects act to increase the amount of second-period 
consumption, we can conclude that an increase in the real interest rate raises 
second-period consumption. But the two effects have opposite impacts on 
first-period consumption, so the increase in the interest rate could either lower 
or raise it. Hence, depending on the relative size of income and substitution effects, an 
increase in the interest rate could either stimulate or depress saving.
Constraints on Borrowing
Fisher’s model assumes that the consumer can borrow as well as save. The ability 
to borrow allows current consumption to exceed current income. In essence, 
when the consumer borrows, he consumes some of his future income today. Yet 
for many people such borrowing is impossible. For example, a student wishing to 
enjoy spring break in Florida would probably be unable to finance this vacation 
with a bank loan. Let’s examine how Fisher’s analysis changes if the consumer 
cannot borrow.
An Increase in the Interest 
Rate  An increase in the 
interest rate rotates the 
budget constraint around the 
point (Y1, Y2). In this figure, 
the higher interest rate reduces 
first-period consumption by 
DC1 and raises second-period 
consumption by DC2.

The inability to borrow prevents current consump­
tion from exceeding current income. A constraint on 
borrowing can therefore be expressed as
C1  Y1.
This inequality states that consumption in period one must 
be less than or equal to income in period one. This addi­
tional constraint on the consumer is called a borrowing 
constraint or, sometimes, a liquidity constraint.
Figure 16-8 shows how this borrowing constraint 
restricts the consumer’s set of choices. The consumer’s 
choice must satisfy both the intertemporal budget con­
straint and the borrowing constraint. The shaded area 
represents the combinations of first-period consumption and second-period 
consumption that satisfy both constraints.
Figure 16-9 shows how this borrowing constraint affects the consumption 
decision. There are two possibilities. In panel (a), the consumer wishes to con­
sume less in period one than he earns. The borrowing constraint is not binding 
and, therefore, does not affect consumption. In panel (b), the consumer would 
like to choose point D, where he consumes more in period one than he earns, 
but the borrowing constraint prevents this outcome. The best the consumer can 
do is to consume all of his first-period income, represented by point E.
The analysis of borrowing constraints leads us to conclude that there are two 
consumption functions. For some consumers, the borrowing constraint is not 
binding, and consumption in both periods depends on the present value of life­
time income, Y1 1 [Y2/(1 1 r)]. For other consumers, the borrowing constraint 
binds, and the consumption function is C1 5 Y1 and C2 5 Y2. Hence, for those con­
sumers who would like to borrow but cannot, consumption depends only on current income.
A Borrowing Constraint  If the consumer 
cannot borrow, he faces the additional 
constraint that first-period consumption can­
not exceed first-period income. The shaded 
area represents the combinations of first-
period and second-period consumption the 
consumer can choose.

 16-3   Franco Modigliani and the 
Life-Cycle Hypothesis
In a series of papers written in the 1950s, Franco Modigliani and his collabo­
rators Albert Ando and Richard Brumberg used Fisher’s model of consumer 
behavior to study the consumption function. One of their goals was to solve the 
consumption puzzle—that is, to explain the apparently conflicting pieces of evi­
dence that came to light when Keynes’s consumption function was confronted 
with the data. According to Fisher’s model, consumption depends on a person’s 
lifetime income. Modigliani emphasized that income varies systematically over 
people’s lives and that saving allows consumers to move income from those times 
in life when income is high to those times when it is low. This interpretation of 
consumer behavior formed the basis for his life-cycle hypothesis.1
The Consumer’s Optimum With a Borrowing Constraint  When the consumer 
faces a borrowing constraint, there are two possible situations. In panel (a), the con­
sumer chooses first-period consumption that is less than first-period income, so the 
borrowing constraint is not binding and does not affect consumption in either period. 
In panel (b), the borrowing constraint is binding. The consumer would like to borrow 
and choose point D. But because borrowing is not allowed, the best available choice 
is point E. When the borrowing constraint is binding, first-period consumption equals 
first-period income.

The Hypothesis
One important reason that income varies over a person’s life is retirement. Most 
people plan to stop working at about age 65, and they expect their incomes 
to fall when they retire. Yet they do not want a large drop in their standard of 
living, as measured by their consumption. To maintain their level of consumption 
after retirement, people must save during their working years. Let’s see what this 
motive for saving implies for the consumption function.
Consider a consumer who expects to live another T years, has wealth of 
W, and expects to earn income Y per year until he retires R years from now. 
What level of consumption will the consumer choose if he wishes to maintain 
a smooth level of consumption over the course of his life?
The consumer’s lifetime resources are composed of initial wealth W and life­
time earnings of R 3 Y. (For simplicity, we are assuming an interest rate of zero; if 
the interest rate were greater than zero, we would need to take account of inter­
est earned on savings as well.) The consumer can divide up his lifetime resources 
among his T remaining years of life. We assume that he wishes to achieve the 
smoothest possible path of consumption over his lifetime. Therefore, he divides 
this total of W 1 RY equally among the T years and each year consumes
C 5 (W 1 RY )/T.
We can write this person’s consumption function as
C 5 (1/T)W 1 (R/T)Y.
For example, if the consumer expects to live for 50 more years and work for 
30 of them, then T 5 50 and R 5 30, so his consumption function is
C 5 0.02W 1 0.6Y.
This equation says that consumption depends on both income and wealth. 
An extra $1 of income per year raises consumption by $0.60 per year, and an 
extra $1 of wealth raises consumption by $0.02 per year.
If every individual in the economy plans consumption like this, then the 
aggregate consumption function is much the same as the individual one. In par­
ticular, aggregate consumption depends on both wealth and income. That is, the 
economy’s consumption function is
C 5 aW 1 bY,
where the parameter a is the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth, and 
the parameter b is the marginal propensity to consume out of income.
Implications
Figure 16-10 graphs the relationship between consumption and income pre­
dicted by the life-cycle model. For any given level of wealth W, the model yields 

C H A P T E R  1 6   Understanding Consumer Behavior  | 491
a conventional consumption function similar to the one shown in Figure 16-1. 
Notice, however, that the intercept of the consumption function, which shows 
what would happen to consumption if income ever fell to zero, is not a fixed 
value, as it is in Figure 16-1. Instead, the intercept here is aW and, thus, depends 
on the level of wealth.
This life-cycle model of consumer behavior can solve the consumption 
puzzle. According to the life-cycle consumption function, the average propensity 
to consume is
C/Y 5 a(W/Y ) 1 b.
Because wealth does not vary proportionately with income from person to per­
son or from year to year, we should find that high income corresponds to a low 
average propensity to consume when we look at data across individuals or over 
short periods of time. But over long periods of time, wealth and income grow 
together, resulting in a constant ratio W/Y and thus a constant average propensity 
to consume.
To make the same point somewhat differently, consider how the consump­
tion function changes over time. As Figure 16-10 shows, for any given level 
of wealth, the life-cycle consumption function looks like the one Keynes sug­
gested. But this function holds only in the short run when wealth is constant. 
In the long run, as wealth increases, the consumption function shifts upward, as 
in Figure 16-11. This upward shift prevents the average propensity to consume 
from falling as income increases. In this way, Modigliani resolved the consump­
tion puzzle posed by Simon Kuznets’s data.
The life-cycle model makes many other predictions as well. Most impor­
tant, it predicts that saving varies over a person’s lifetime. If a person begins

adulthood with no wealth, he will accumulate wealth during his working 
years and then run down his wealth during his retirement years. Figure 16-12 
illustrates the consumer’s income, consumption, and wealth over his adult life. 
According to the life-cycle hypothesis, because people want to smooth con­
sumption over their lives, the young who are working save, while the old who 
are retired dissave.

The Consumption and Saving of the Elderly
Many economists have studied the consumption and saving of the elderly. Their 
findings present a problem for the life-cycle model. It appears that the elderly do 
not dissave as much as the model predicts. In other words, the elderly do not run 
down their wealth as quickly as one would expect if they were trying to smooth 
their consumption over their remaining years of life.
There are two chief explanations for why the elderly do not dissave to the extent 
that the model predicts. Each suggests a direction for further research on consumption.
The first explanation is that the elderly are concerned about unpredictable 
expenses. Additional saving that arises from uncertainty is called precautionary 
saving. One reason for precautionary saving by the elderly is the possibility of 
living longer than expected and thus having to provide for a longer than average 
span of retirement. Another reason is the possibility of illness and large medical 
bills. The elderly may respond to this uncertainty by saving more in order to be 
better prepared for these contingencies.
The precautionary-saving explanation is not completely persuasive because 
the elderly can largely insure against these risks. To protect against uncertainty 
regarding life span, they can buy annuities from insurance companies. For a fixed 
fee, annuities offer a stream of income that lasts as long as the recipient lives. 
Uncertainty about medical expenses should be largely eliminated by Medicare, the 
government’s health insurance plan for the elderly, and by private insurance plans.
The second explanation for the failure of the elderly to dissave is that they may 
want to leave bequests to their children. Economists have proposed various theories 
of the parent–child relationship and the bequest motive. In Chapter 19 we will dis­
cuss some of these theories and their implications for consumption and fiscal policy.
Overall, research on the elderly suggests that the simplest life-cycle model 
cannot fully explain consumer behavior. There is no doubt that providing for 
retirement is an important motive for saving, but other motives, such as precau­
tionary saving and bequests, appear to be important as well.2 n

 16-4   Milton Friedman and the
Permanent-Income Hypothesis
In a book published in 1957, Milton Friedman proposed the permanent-
income hypothesis to explain consumer behavior. Friedman’s permanent-
income hypothesis complements Modigliani’s life-cycle hypothesis: both use 

494 |  P A R T  V   Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
Irving Fisher’s theory of the consumer to argue that consumption should not 
depend on current income alone. But unlike the life-cycle hypothesis, which 
emphasizes that income follows a regular pattern over a person’s lifetime, the 
permanent-income hypothesis emphasizes that people experience random and 
temporary changes in their incomes from year to year.3
The Hypothesis
Friedman suggested that we view current income Y as the sum of two compo­
nents, permanent income YP and transitory income YT. That is,
Y 5 YP 1 YT.
Permanent income is the part of income that people expect to persist into the 
future. Transitory income is the part of income that people do not expect to per­
sist. Put differently, permanent income is average income, and transitory income 
is the random deviation from that average.
To see how we might separate income into these two parts, consider these 
examples:
n Maria, who has a law degree, earned more this year than John, who 
is a high school dropout. Maria’s higher income resulted from higher 
permanent income because her education will continue to provide 
her a higher salary.
n Sue, a Florida orange grower, earned less than usual this year because 
a freeze destroyed her crop. Bill, a California orange grower, earned 
more than usual because the freeze in Florida drove up the price 
of oranges. Bill’s higher income resulted from higher transitory 
income because he is no more likely than Sue to have good weather 
next year.
These examples show that different forms of income have different degrees of 
persistence. A good education provides a permanently higher income, whereas 
good weather provides only transitorily higher income. Although one can imag­
ine intermediate cases, it is useful to keep things simple by supposing that there 
are only two kinds of income: permanent and transitory.
Friedman reasoned that consumption should depend primarily on per­
manent income because consumers use saving and borrowing to smooth 
consumption in response to transitory changes in income. For example, if a 
person received a permanent raise of $10,000 per year, his consumption 
would rise by about as much. Yet if a person won $10,000 in a lottery, he 
would not consume it all in one year. Instead, he would spread the extra 
consumption over the rest of his life. If we assume an interest rate of zero 
3Milton Friedman, A Theory of the Consumption Function (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University 
Press, 1957).

C H A P T E R  1 6   Understanding Consumer Behavior  | 495
and a remaining life span of 50 years, consumption would rise by only 
$200 per year in response to the $10,000 prize. Thus, consumers spend their 
permanent income, but they save rather than spend most of their transitory 
income.
Friedman concluded that we should view the consumption function as 
approximately
C 5 aYP,
where a is a constant that measures the fraction of permanent income consumed. 
The permanent-income hypothesis, as expressed by this equation, states that 
consumption is proportional to permanent income.
Implications
The permanent-income hypothesis solves the consumption puzzle by suggest­
ing that the standard Keynesian consumption function uses the wrong variable. 
According to the permanent-income hypothesis, consumption depends on per­
manent income YP; yet many studies of the consumption function try to relate 
consumption to current income Y. Friedman argued that this errors-in-variables 
problem explains the seemingly contradictory findings.
Let’s see what Friedman’s hypothesis implies for the average propensity to 
consume. Divide both sides of his consumption function by Y to obtain
APC 5 C/Y 5 aYP/Y.
According to the permanent-income hypothesis, the average propensity to 
consume depends on the ratio of permanent income to current income. When 
current income temporarily rises above permanent income, the average propen­
sity to consume temporarily falls; when current income temporarily falls below 
permanent income, the average propensity to consume temporarily rises.
Now consider the studies of household data. Friedman reasoned that these 
data reflect a combination of permanent and transitory income. Households 
with high permanent income have proportionately higher consumption. If all 
variation in current income came from the permanent component, the average 
propensity to consume would be the same in all households. But some of the 
variation in income comes from the transitory component, and households with 
high transitory income do not have higher consumption. Therefore, researchers 
find that high-income households have, on average, lower average propensities 
to consume.
Similarly, consider the studies of time-series data. Friedman reasoned that 
year-to-year fluctuations in income are dominated by transitory income. 
Therefore, years of high income should be years of low average propensities 
to consume. But over long periods of time—say, from decade to decade—the 
variation in income comes from the permanent component. Hence, in long 
time-series, one should observe a constant average propensity to consume, as in 
fact Kuznets found.

The 1964 Tax Cut and the 1968 Tax Surcharge
The permanent-income hypothesis can help us interpret how the economy 
responds to changes in fiscal policy. According to the IS–LM model of 
Chapters 11 and 12, tax cuts stimulate consumption and raise aggregate demand, 
and tax increases depress consumption and reduce aggregate demand. The per­
manent-income hypothesis, however, predicts that consumption responds only to 
changes in permanent income. Therefore, transitory changes in taxes should have 
only a negligible effect on consumption and aggregate demand.
That’s the theory. But one might naturally ask: is this prediction actually borne 
out in the data?
Some economists say yes, and they point to two historical changes in fiscal 
policy—the tax cut of 1964 and the tax surcharge of 1968—to illustrate the 
principle. The tax cut of 1964 was popular. It was announced as being a major 
and permanent reduction in tax rates. As we discussed in Chapter 11, this policy 
change had the intended effect of stimulating the economy.
The tax surcharge of 1968 arose in a very different political climate. It became 
law because the economic advisers of President Lyndon Johnson believed that the 
increase in government spending from the Vietnam War had excessively stimulated 
aggregate demand. To offset this effect, they recommended a tax increase. But 
Johnson, aware that the war was already unpopular, feared the political repercus­
sions of higher taxes. He finally agreed to a temporary tax surcharge—in essence, 
a one-year increase in taxes. The tax surcharge did not seem to have the desired 
effect of reducing aggregate demand. Unemployment continued to fall, and infla­
tion continued to rise. This is what the permanent-income hypothesis would lead 
us to predict: the tax increase affected only transitory income, so consumption 
behavior and aggregate demand were not greatly affected.
While these two historical examples are consistent with the permanent-
income hypothesis, it is hard to draw firm inferences from them. At any moment 
in time, there are many macroeconomic influences on consumer spending, 
including the overall confidence that consumers have in their own economic 
prospects. It is hard to disentangle the effects of tax policy from the effects of 
other events occurring at the same time. Fortunately, some recent research has 
reached more reliable conclusions, as discussed in the next Case Study. n

The Tax Rebates of 2008
When medical researchers want to know the effectiveness of a new treatment, 
the best approach is a randomized controlled experiment. A group of patients 
is assembled. Half of them are given the new treatment, and the other half are 
given a placebo. The researchers can then track and compare the two groups to 
measure the effects of the treatment.
Macroeconomists usually cannot conduct randomized experiments, but some­
times such experiments fall into our lap as accidents of history. One example

occurred in 2008. As a result of a severe financial crisis that year, the economy was 
heading into a recession. To counteract the recessionary forces, Congress passed 
the Economic Stimulus Act, which provided $100 billion of one-time tax rebates 
to households. Single individuals received $300 to $600, couples received $600 
to $1,200, and families with children received an additional $300 per child. Most 
important, because sending out many millions of checks was a long process, con­
sumers received their tax rebates at different times. The timing of receipt was based 
on the last two digits of the individual’s Social Security number, which is essentially 
random. By comparing the spending behavior of consumers who received early 
payments to the behavior of those who received later payments, researchers could 
use this random variation to estimate the effect of a transitory tax cut.
Here are the results, as reported by the researchers who did the study: “We 
find that on average households spent about 12 to 30 percent of their stimulus 
payments, depending on the specification, on nondurable consumption goods 
and services (as defined in the consumer expenditure survey) during the three-
month period in which the payments were received. This response is statistically 
and economically significant. We also find a significant effect on the purchase 
of durable goods and related services, primarily the purchase of vehicles, bring­
ing the average response of total consumption expenditures to about 50 to 
90 percent of the payments during the three-month period of receipt.”4
The findings of this study stand in stark contrast to what the permanent-
income hypothesis predicts. If households were smoothing their consumption 
over time, as the permanent-income hypothesis assumes, they would have spent 
only a small fraction of the tax rebate in a three-month period, but the data show 
a large impact of the rebate on spending. In addition, if the permanent-income 
hypothesis were correct, those receiving the early checks would not have behaved 
any differently from those receiving the later checks because the permanent 
income of the two groups was the same. Yet the data show that the timing of the 
check’s arrival had a profound impact on the timing of a household’s spending.
The permanent-income theory may be correct in positing that permanent tax 
changes influence consumer spending more powerfully than transitory ones. But 
from the evidence from the 2008 experience, it seems wrong to conclude that 
the effects of transitory tax changes are insignificantly small. Even very transitory 
changes in tax policy can influence how much consumers spend. n

 16-5   Robert Hall and the Random-Walk 
Hypothesis
The permanent-income hypothesis is based on Fisher’s model of intertemporal 
choice. It builds on the insight that forward-looking consumers base their con­
sumption decisions not only on their current income but also on the income 

498 |  P A R T  V   Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
they expect to receive in the future. Thus, the permanent-income hypothesis 
highlights the idea that consumption depends on people’s expectations.
Recent research on consumption has combined this view of the consumer 
with the assumption of rational expectations. The rational-expectations assump­
tion states that people use all available information to make optimal forecasts 
about the future. As we saw in Chapter 14, this assumption can have profound 
implications for the costs of stopping inflation. It can also have profound implica­
tions for the study of consumer behavior.
The Hypothesis
The economist Robert Hall was the first to derive the implications of ratio­
nal expectations for consumption. He showed that if the permanent-income 
hypothesis is correct, and if consumers have rational expectations, then changes 
in consumption over time should be unpredictable. When changes in a variable 
are unpredictable, the variable is said to follow a random walk. According to 
Hall, the combination of the permanent-income hypothesis and rational expec­
tations implies that consumption follows a random walk.
Hall reasoned as follows: According to the permanent-income hypothesis, 
consumers face fluctuating income and try their best to smooth their con­
sumption over time. At any moment, consumers choose consumption based on 
their current expectations of their lifetime incomes. Over time, they change 
their consumption because they receive news that causes them to revise their 
expectations. For example, a person getting an unexpected promotion increases 
consumption, whereas a person getting an unexpected demotion decreases 
consumption. In other words, changes in consumption reflect “surprises” about 
lifetime income. If consumers are optimally using all available information, then 
they should be surprised only by events that were entirely unpredictable. There­
fore, changes in their consumption should be unpredictable as well.5
Implications
The rational-expectations approach to consumption has implications not only 
for forecasting but also for the analysis of economic policies. If consumers obey 
the permanent-income hypothesis and have rational expectations, then only unexpected 
policy changes influence consumption. These policy changes take effect when they change 
expectations. For example, suppose that today Congress passes a tax increase to be 
effective next year. In this case, consumers receive the news about their lifetime 
incomes when Congress passes the law (or even earlier if the law’s passage was 
predictable). The arrival of this news causes consumers to revise their expecta­
tions and reduce their consumption. The following year, when the tax hike goes 
into effect, consumption is unchanged because no news has arrived.

Theory and Evidence,” Journal of Political Economy 86 (December 1978): 971–987.

Hence, if consumers have rational expectations, policymakers influence the 
economy not only through their actions but also through the public’s expectation 
of their actions. Expectations, however, cannot be observed directly. Therefore, it is 
often hard to know how and when changes in fiscal policy alter aggregate demand.
Do Predictable Changes in Income Lead to 
Predictable Changes in Consumption?
Of the many facts about consumer behavior, one is impossible to dispute: income 
and consumption fluctuate together over the business cycle. When the economy 
goes into a recession, both income and consumption fall, and when the economy 
booms, both income and consumption rise rapidly.
By itself, this fact doesn’t say much about the rational-expectations version of 
the permanent-income hypothesis. Most short-run fluctuations are unpredictable. 
Thus, when the economy goes into a recession, the typical consumer is receiving 
bad news about his lifetime income, so consumption naturally falls. And when 
the economy booms, the typical consumer is receiving good news about his 
lifetime income, so consumption rises. This behavior does not necessarily violate 
the random-walk theory that changes in consumption are impossible to forecast.
Yet suppose we could identify some predictable changes in income. According to 
the random-walk theory, these changes in income should not cause consumers to 
revise their spending plans. If consumers expected income to rise or fall, they should 
have adjusted their consumption already in response to that information. Thus, pre­
dictable changes in income should not lead to predictable changes in consumption.
Data on consumption and income, however, appear not to satisfy this implica­
tion of the random-walk theory. When income is expected to fall by $1, con­
sumption will on average fall at the same time by about $0.50. In other words, 
predictable changes in income lead to predictable changes in consumption that 
are roughly half as large.
Why is this so? One possible explanation of this behavior is that some con­
sumers may fail to have rational expectations. Instead, they may base their expec­
tations of future income excessively on current income. Thus, when income rises 
or falls (even predictably), they act as if they received news about their lifetime 
resources and change their consumption accordingly. Another possible explana­
tion is that some consumers are borrowing-constrained and, therefore, base their 
consumption on current income alone. Regardless of which explanation is cor­
rect, Keynes’s original consumption function starts to look more attractive. That 
is, current income has a larger role in determining consumer spending than the 
random-walk hypothesis suggests.6 n

 16-6   David Laibson and the Pull of 
Instant Gratification
Keynes called the consumption function a “fundamental psychological law.” 
Yet, as we have seen, psychology has not played much of a role in the sub­
sequent study of consumption. Most economists assume that consumers are 
rational maximizers of utility who are always evaluating their opportunities 
and plans in order to obtain the highest lifetime satisfaction. This model of 
human behavior was the basis for all the work on consumption theory from 
Irving Fisher to Robert Hall.
More recently, economists have started to return to psychology. They have 
suggested that consumption decisions are not made by the ultrarational Homo 
economicus but by real human beings whose behavior can be far from rational. 
This new subfield infusing psychology into economics is called behavioral 
economics. The most prominent behavioral economist studying consumption is 
Harvard professor David Laibson.
Laibson notes that many consumers judge themselves to be imperfect deci­
sionmakers. In one survey of the American public, 76 percent said they were 
not saving enough for retirement. In another survey of the baby-boom genera­
tion, respondents were asked the percentage of income that they save and the 
percentage that they thought they should save. The saving shortfall averaged 
11 percentage points.
According to Laibson, the insufficiency of saving is related to another phe­
nomenon: the pull of instant gratification. Consider the following two questions:
Question 1: Would you prefer (A) a candy today or (B) two candies 
tomorrow?
Question 2: Would you prefer (A) a candy in 100 days or (B) two candies in 
101 days?
Many people confronted with such choices will answer A to the first question 
and B to the second. In a sense, they are more patient in the long run than they 
are in the short run.
This raises the possibility that consumers’ preferences may be time-inconsistent: 
they may alter their decisions simply because time passes. A person confronting 
question 2 may choose B and wait the extra day for the extra candy. But after 
100 days pass, he finds himself in a new short run, confronting question 1. The 
pull of instant gratification may induce him to change his mind.
We see this kind of behavior in many situations in life. A person on a diet 
may have a second helping at dinner, while promising himself that he will eat 
less tomorrow. A person may smoke one more cigarette, while promising himself 
that this is the last one. And a consumer may splurge at the shopping mall, while 
promising himself that tomorrow he will cut back his spending and start saving 
more for retirement. But when tomorrow arrives, the promises are in the past, 
and a new self takes control of the decisionmaking, with its own desire for instant 
gratification.

How to Get People to Save More
Many economists believe that it would be desirable for Americans to increase 
the fraction of their income that they save. There are several reasons for this 
conclusion. From a microeconomic perspective, greater saving would mean that 
people would be better prepared for retirement; this goal is especially important 
because Social Security, the public program that provides retirement income, 
is projected to run into financial difficulties in the years ahead as the popula­
tion ages. From a macroeconomic perspective, greater saving would increase 
the supply of loanable funds available to finance investment; the Solow growth 
model shows that increased capital accumulation leads to higher income. From 
an open-economy perspective, greater saving would mean that less domestic 
investment would be financed by capital flows from abroad; a smaller capital 
inflow pushes the trade balance from deficit toward surplus. Finally, the fact that 
many Americans say that they are not saving enough may be sufficient reason to 
think that increased saving should be a national goal.
The difficult issue is how to get Americans to save more. The burgeoning field 
of behavioral economics offers some answers.
One approach is to make saving the path of least resistance. For example, 
consider 401(k) plans, the tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts avail­
able to many workers through their employers. In most firms, participation in 
the plan is an option that workers can choose by filling out a simple form. In 
some firms, however, workers are automatically enrolled in the plan but can opt 
out by filling out a simple form. Studies have shown that workers are far more 
likely to participate in the second case than in the first. If workers were rational 
maximizers, as is so often assumed in economic theory, they would choose the 
optimal amount of retirement saving, regardless of whether they had to choose 
to enroll or were enrolled automatically. In fact, workers’ behavior appears to 
exhibit substantial inertia. Policymakers who want to increase saving can take 
advantage of this inertia by making automatic enrollment in these savings plans 
more common.
A second approach to increasing saving is to give people the opportunity 
to control their desires for instant gratification. One intriguing possibility is 
the “Save More Tomorrow” program proposed by economist Richard Thaler.

The possibility that consumers may deviate from conventional rationality and 
exhibit time-inconsistent behavior is potentially important for designing public 
policies, as the following case study discusses.7

 16-7   Conclusion
In the work of six prominent economists, we have seen a progression of views 
on consumer behavior. Keynes proposed that consumption depends largely on 
current income. He suggested a consumption function of the form
Consumption 5 f(Current Income).
More recently, economists have argued that consumers understand that they face 
an intertemporal decision. Consumers look ahead to their future resources and 
needs, implying a more complex consumption function than the one Keynes 
proposed. This work suggests instead that
	
Consumption 
	
	
5 f(Current Income, Wealth, Expected Future Income, Interest Rates).
In other words, current income is only one determinant of aggregate consumption.
Economists continue to debate the importance of these determinants of 
consumption. There remains disagreement about, for example, the influence of 
interest rates on consumer spending, the prevalence of borrowing constraints, 
and the importance of psychological effects. Economists sometimes disagree 
about economic policy because they assume different consumption functions. 
For instance, as we will see in Chapter 19, the debate over the effects of govern­
ment debt is in part a debate over the determinants of consumer spending. The 
key role of consumption in policy evaluation is sure to maintain economists’ 
interest in studying consumer behavior for many years to come.
The essence of this program is that people commit in advance to putting a por­
tion of their future salary increases into a retirement savings account. When a 
worker signs up, he makes no sacrifice of lower consumption today but, instead, 
commits to reducing consumption growth in the future. When this plan was 
implemented in several firms, it had a large impact. A high proportion (78 percent) 
of those offered the plan joined. In addition, of those enrolled, the vast majority 
(80 percent) stayed with the program through at least the fourth annual pay raise. 
The average saving rates for those in the program increased from 3.5 percent to 
13.6 percent over the course of 40 months.
How successful would more widespread applications of these ideas be in 
increasing the U.S. national saving rate? It is impossible to say for sure. But given 
the importance of saving to both personal and national economic prosperity, 
many economists believe these proposals are worth a try.8 n

Summary
	1.	Keynes conjectured that the marginal propensity to consume is between 
zero and one, that the average propensity to consume falls as income rises, 
and that current income is the primary determinant of consumption. 
Studies of household data and short time-series confirmed Keynes’s con­
jectures. Yet studies of long time-series found no tendency for the average 
propensity to consume to fall as income rises over time.
	2.	Recent work on consumption builds on Irving Fisher’s model of the 
consumer. In this model, the consumer faces an intertemporal budget 
constraint and chooses consumption for the present and the future to 
achieve the highest level of lifetime satisfaction. As long as the consumer 
can save and borrow, consumption depends on the consumer’s lifetime 
resources.
	3.	Modigliani’s life-cycle hypothesis emphasizes that income varies somewhat 
predictably over a person’s life and that consumers use saving and borrow­
ing to smooth their consumption over their lifetimes. According to this 
hypothesis, consumption depends on both income and wealth.
	4.	Friedman’s permanent-income hypothesis emphasizes that individuals 
experience both permanent and transitory fluctuations in their 
income. Because consumers can save and borrow, and because they 
want to smooth their consumption, consumption does not respond 
much to transitory income. Instead, consumption depends primarily 
on permanent income.
	5.	Hall’s random-walk hypothesis combines the permanent-income hypothesis 
with the assumption that consumers have rational expectations about future 
income. It implies that changes in consumption are unpredictable because 
consumers change their consumption only when they receive news about 
their lifetime resources.
	6.	Laibson has suggested that psychological effects are important for under­
standing consumer behavior. In particular, because people have a strong 
desire for instant gratification, they may exhibit time-inconsistent behavior 
and end up saving less than they would like.

	1.	The chapter uses the Fisher model to discuss a 
change in the interest rate for a consumer who 
saves some of his first-period income. Suppose, 
instead, that the consumer is a borrower. How 
does that alter the analysis? Discuss the income 
and substitution effects on consumption in both 
periods.
	2.	Gabe and Gita both obey the two-period Fisher 
model of consumption. Gabe earns $100 in the 
first period and $100 in the second period. Gita 
earns nothing in the first period and $210 in 
the second period. Both of them can borrow or 
lend at the interest rate r.
	a.	You observe both Gabe and Gita consuming 
$100 in the first period and $100 in the sec­

the interest rate increase?
	3.	The chapter analyzes Fisher’s model for the case 
in which the consumer can save or borrow at an 
interest rate of r and for the case in which the 
consumer can save at this rate but cannot bor­
row at all. Consider now the intermediate case

each of the three cases?

population that is elderly will increase over the 
next 20 years. What does the life-cycle model 
predict for the influence of this demographic 
change on the national saving rate?
	7.	A Case Study in the chapter indicates that the 
elderly do not dissave as much as the life-cycle 
model predicts.
	a.	Describe the two possible explanations for 
this phenomenon.
	b.	One study found that the elderly who do not 
have children dissave at about the same rate as 
the elderly who do have children. What might 
this finding imply about the validity of the two 
explanations? Why might it be inconclusive?
	 8.	Consider two savings accounts that pay the same 
interest rate. One account lets you take your money 
out on demand. The second requires that you give 
30-day advance notification before withdrawals.
	a.	Which account would you prefer? Why?
	b.	Can you imagine a person who might make 
the opposite choice? Explain.
	c.	What do these choices say about the theories 
of the consumption function discussed in this 
chapter?
	9.	This problem uses calculus to compare two sce­
narios of consumer optimization.
	a.	Nina has the following utility function:
U 5 ln(C1) 1 ln(C2) 1 ln(C3).
She starts with wealth of $120,000, earns no 
additional income, and faces a zero interest 
rate. How much does she consume in each of 
the three periods? (Hint: The marginal rate of 
substitution between consumption in any two 
periods is the ratio of marginal utilities.)
	b.	David is just like Nina, except he always 
gets extra utility from present consumption. 
From the perspective of period one, his utility 
function is
U 5 2 ln(C1) 1 ln(C2) 1 ln(C3).
In period one, how much does David 
decide to consume in each of the three 
periods? How much wealth does he have 
left after period one?
	c.	When David enters period two, his utility 
function is
U 5 ln(C1) 1 2 ln(C2) 1 ln(C3).
How much does he consume in periods two 
and three? How does your answer here com­
pare to David’s decision in part (b)?
	d.	If, in period one, David were able to con­
strain the choices he can make in period two, 
what would he do? Relate this example to 
one of the theories of consumption discussed 
in the chapter.

hile spending on consumption goods provides utility to house­
holds today, spending on investment goods is aimed at providing a 
higher standard of living at a later date. Investment is the compo­
nent of GDP that links the present and the future.
Investment spending plays a key role not only in long-run growth but also in 
the short-run business cycle because it is the most volatile component of GDP. 
When expenditure on goods and services falls during a recession, much of the 
decline is usually due to a drop in investment. In the severe U.S. recession of 
2008–2009, for example, real GDP fell $636 billion from its peak in the fourth 
quarter of 2007 to its trough in the second quarter of 2009. Investment spend­
ing over the same period fell $785 billion, accounting for more than the entire 
fall in spending.
Economists study investment to better understand fluctuations in the 
economy’s output of goods and services. The models of GDP we saw in pre­
vious chapters, such as the IS–LM model in Chapters 11 and 12, were based 
on a simple investment function relating investment to the real interest rate: 
I 5 I(r). That function states that an increase in the real interest rate reduces 
investment. In this chapter we look more closely at the theory behind this 
investment function.
There are three types of investment spending. Business fixed investment 
includes the equipment, structures, and intellectual property that businesses buy 
to use in production. Residential investment includes the new housing that 
people buy to live in and that landlords buy to rent out. Inventory investment 
includes those goods that businesses put aside in storage, including materials and 
supplies, work in process, and finished goods. Figure 17-1 plots total investment 
and its three components in the United States between 1970 and 2014. You can 
see that all types of investment usually fall during recessions, which are shown as 
shaded areas in the figure.

time and ignorance which envelope our future.

In this chapter we build models of each type of investment to explain these 
fluctuations. The models will shed light on the following questions:
n Why is investment negatively related to the interest rate?
n What causes the investment function to shift?
n Why does investment rise during booms and fall during recessions?
At the end of the chapter, we return to these questions and summarize the 
answers that the models offer.
 17-1	 Business Fixed Investment
The largest piece of investment spending, accounting for about three-quarters of 
the total, is business fixed investment. The term business means that these investment 
goods are bought by firms for use in future production. The term fixed means that 
this spending is for capital that will stay put for a while, as opposed to inventory 
investment, which will be used or sold within a short time. Business fixed investment 
includes everything from office furniture to factories, computers to company cars.

C H A P T E R  1 7   The Theory of Investment  | 509
The standard model of business fixed investment is called the neoclassical 
model of investment. The neoclassical model examines the benefits and costs 
to firms of owning capital goods. The model shows how the level of investment—
the addition to the stock of capital—is related to the marginal product of capital, 
the interest rate, and the tax rules affecting firms.
To develop the model, imagine that there are two kinds of firms in the 
economy. Production firms produce goods and services using capital that they 
rent. Rental firms make all the investments in the economy; they buy capital and 
rent it out to the production firms. Most firms in the real world perform both 
functions: they produce goods and services, and they invest in capital for future 
production. We can simplify our analysis and clarify our thinking, however, if we 
separate these two activities by imagining that they take place in different firms.
The Rental Price of Capital
Let’s first consider the typical production firm. As we discussed in Chapter 3, this 
firm decides how much capital to rent by comparing the cost and benefit of each 
unit of capital. The firm rents capital at a rental rate R and sells its output at a price P; 
the real cost of a unit of capital to the production firm is R/P. The real benefit of a 
unit of capital is the marginal product of capital MPK—the extra output produced 
with one more unit of capital. The marginal product of capital declines as the 
amount of capital rises: the more capital the firm has, the less an additional unit of 
capital will add to its output. Chapter 3 concluded that, to maximize profit, the firm 
rents capital until the marginal product of capital falls to equal the real rental price.
Figure 17-2 shows the equilibrium in the rental market for capital. For the 
reasons just discussed, the marginal product of capital determines the demand 
The Rental Price of 
Capital  The real rental 
price of capital adjusts to 
equilibrate the demand 
for capital (determined 
by the marginal product 
of capital) and the fixed 
supply.

curve. The demand curve slopes downward because the marginal product of 
capital is low when the level of capital is high. At any point in time, the amount 
of capital in the economy is fixed, so the supply curve is vertical. The real rental 
price of capital adjusts to equilibrate supply and demand.
To see what variables influence the equilibrium rental price, let’s consider a 
particular production function. As we saw in Chapter 3, many economists consider 
the Cobb–Douglas production function a good approximation of how the actual 
economy turns capital and labor into goods and services. The Cobb–Douglas 
production function is
Y 5 AK aL12a,
where Y is output, K is capital, L is labor, A is a parameter measuring the level 
of technology, and a is a parameter between zero and one that measures capital’s 
share of output. The marginal product of capital for the Cobb–Douglas produc­
tion function is
MPK 5 aA(L/K )12a.
Because the real rental price R/P equals the marginal product of capital in equi­
librium, we can write
R/P 5 aA(L/K )12a.
This expression identifies the variables that determine the real rental price. 
It shows the following:
n The lower the stock of capital, the higher the real rental price of capital.
n The greater the amount of labor employed, the higher the real rental 
price of capital.
n The better the technology, the higher the real rental price of capital.
Events that reduce the capital stock (a tornado), or raise employment (an expan­
sion in aggregate demand), or improve the technology (a scientific discovery) 
raise the equilibrium real rental price of capital.
The Cost of Capital
Next consider the rental firms. These firms, like car-rental companies, buy capital 
goods and rent them out. Because our goal is to explain the investments made by 
the rental firms, we begin by considering the benefit and cost of owning capital.
The benefit of owning capital is the revenue earned by renting it to the pro­
duction firms. The rental firm receives the real rental price of capital R/P for 
each unit of capital it owns and rents out.
The cost of owning capital is more complex. For each period of time that it 
rents out a unit of capital, the rental firm bears three costs:
	1.	When a rental firm borrows to buy a unit of capital, it must pay ­interest 
on the loan. If PK is the purchase price of a unit of capital and i is the 
nominal interest rate, then iPK is the interest cost. Notice that this interest 

C H A P T E R  1 7   The Theory of Investment  | 511
cost would be the same even if the rental firm did not have to borrow: if 
the rental firm buys a unit of capital using cash on hand, it loses out on the 
interest it could have earned by depositing this cash in the bank. In either 
case, the interest cost equals iPK.
	2.	While the rental firm is renting out the capital, the price of capital 
can change. If the price of capital falls, the firm loses, because the 
firm’s asset has fallen in value. If the price of capital rises, the firm gains, 
because the firm’s asset has risen in value. The cost of this loss or gain 
is 2DPK. (The minus sign is here because we are measuring costs, not 
benefits.)
	3.	While the capital is rented out, it suffers wear and tear, called depreciation. 
If d is the rate of depreciation—the fraction of capital’s value lost per period 
because of wear and tear—then the dollar cost of depreciation is dPK.
The total cost of renting out a unit of capital for one period is therefore
Cost of Capital 5 iPK 2 DPK 1 dPK
5 PK (i 2 DPK/PK 1 d).
The cost of capital depends on the price of capital, the interest rate, the rate at 
which capital prices are changing, and the depreciation rate.
For example, consider the cost of capital to a car-rental company. The com­
pany buys cars for $30,000 each and rents them out to other businesses. The 
company faces an interest rate i of 10 percent per year, so the interest cost iPK is 
$3,000 per year for each car the company owns. Car prices are rising at 6 per­
cent per year, so, excluding wear and tear, the firm gets a capital gain DPK of 
$1,800 per year. Cars depreciate at 20 percent per year, so the loss due to wear 
and tear dPK is $6,000 per year. Therefore, the company’s cost of capital is
Cost of Capital 5 $3,000 2 $1,800 1 $6,000
5 $7,200.
The cost to the car-rental company of keeping a car in its capital stock is $7,200 
per year.
To make the expression for the cost of capital simpler and easier to interpret, 
we assume that the price of capital goods rises with the prices of other goods. In 
this case, DPK/PK equals the overall rate of inflation p. Because i  p equals the 
real interest rate r, we can write the cost of capital as
Cost of Capital 5 PK (r 1 d).
This equation states that the cost of capital depends on the price of capital, the 
real interest rate, and the depreciation rate.
Finally, we want to express the cost of capital relative to other goods in the 
economy. The real cost of capital—the cost of buying and renting out a unit 
of capital measured in units of the economy’s output—is
Real Cost of Capital 5 (PK/P )(r 1 d).

This equation states that the real cost of capital depends on the relative price of 
a capital good PK/P, the real interest rate r, and the depreciation rate d.
The Determinants of Investment
Now consider a rental firm’s decision about whether to increase or decrease its 
capital stock. For each unit of capital, the firm earns real revenue R/P and bears 
the real cost (PK/P )(r 1 d). The real profit per unit of capital is
Profit Rate 5 Revenue 2 Cost
5 R/P 2 (PK/P )(r 1 d).
Because the real rental price in equilibrium equals the marginal product of capi­
tal, we can write the profit rate as
Profit Rate 5 MPK 2 (PK/P )(r 1 d).
The rental firm makes a profit if the marginal product of capital is greater than 
the cost of capital. It incurs a loss if the marginal product is less than the cost of 
capital.
We can now see the economic incentives that lie behind the rental firm’s 
investment decision. The firm’s decision regarding its capital stock—that is, 
whether to add to it or to let it depreciate—depends on whether owning and 
renting out capital is profitable. The change in the capital stock, called net 
investment, depends on the difference between the marginal product of capital 
and the cost of capital. If the marginal product of capital exceeds the cost of capital, firms 
find it profitable to add to their capital stock. If the marginal product of capital falls short 
of the cost of capital, they let their capital stock shrink.
We can also now see that the separation of economic activity between pro­
duction and rental firms, although useful for clarifying our thinking, is not nec­
essary for our conclusion regarding how firms choose how much to invest. For 
a firm that both uses and owns capital, the benefit of an extra unit of capital is 
the marginal product of capital, and the cost is the cost of capital. Like a firm 
that owns and rents out capital, this firm adds to its capital stock if the marginal 
product exceeds the cost of capital. Thus, we can write
DK 5 In [MPK 2 (PK/P )(r 1 d)],
where In( ) is the function showing how net investment responds to the incentive 
to invest. How much the capital stock responds (and thus the precise form of this 
function) depends on how costly the adjustment process is.
We can now derive the investment function. Total spending on business fixed 
investment is the sum of net investment and the replacement of depreciated 
capital. The investment function is
I 5 In [MPK 2 (PK/P )(r 1 d)] 1 dK.
Business fixed investment depends on the marginal product of capital, the cost 
of capital, and the amount of depreciation.

C H A P T E R  1 7   The Theory of Investment  | 513
This model shows why investment depends on the interest rate. A decrease 
in the real interest rate lowers the cost of capital. It therefore raises the amount 
of profit from owning capital and increases the incentive to accumulate more 
capital. Similarly, an increase in the real interest rate raises the cost of capital and 
leads firms to reduce their investment. For this reason, the investment sched­
ule relating investment to the interest rate slopes downward, as in panel (a) of 
­Figure 17-3.
The model also shows what causes the investment schedule to shift. Any 
event that raises the marginal product of capital increases the profitability of 
investment and causes the investment schedule to shift outward, as in panel (b) 
of ­Figure 17-3. For example, a technological innovation that increases the pro­
duction function parameter A raises the marginal product of capital and, for any 
given interest rate, increases the amount of capital goods that rental firms wish 
to buy.
Finally, consider what happens as this adjustment of the capital stock continues 
over time. If the marginal product begins above the cost of capital, the capital 
stock will rise and the marginal product will fall. If the marginal product of capi­
tal begins below the cost of capital, the capital stock will fall and the marginal 
product will rise. Eventually, as the capital stock adjusts, the marginal product of 
capital approaches the cost of capital. When the capital stock reaches a steady-
state level, we can write
MPK 5 (PK/P )(r 1 d).
Thus, in the long run, the marginal product of capital equals the real cost of 
capital. The speed of adjustment toward the steady state depends on how quickly 
The Investment Function  Panel (a) shows that business fixed investment increases 
when the interest rate falls. This is because a lower interest rate reduces the cost 
of capital and therefore makes owning capital more profitable. Panel (b) shows an 
outward shift in the investment function, which might be due to an increase in the 
marginal product of capital.

firms adjust their capital stock, which in turn depends on how costly it is to 
build, deliver, and install new capital.1
Taxes and Investment
Tax laws influence firms’ incentives to accumulate capital in many ways. Some­
times policymakers change the tax code to shift the investment function and 
influence aggregate demand. Here we consider two of the most important 
provisions of corporate taxation: the corporate income tax and the investment 
tax credit.
The corporate income tax is a tax on corporate profits. Throughout much 
of its history, the corporate tax rate levied by the U.S. federal government was 
46  percent. The rate was lowered to 34 percent in 1986 and then raised to 
35 percent in 1993, and it remained at that level as of 2014, when this book was 
going to press. Many states impose an additional corporate tax as well, bringing 
the total corporate tax rate in the United States to about 40 percent. By contrast, 
the average corporate tax rate in Europe in 2014 was 19.7 percent.
The effect of a corporate income tax on investment depends on how the law 
defines “profit” for the purpose of taxation. Suppose, first, that the law defined 
profit as we did previously—the rental price of capital minus the cost of capital. 
In this case, even though firms would be sharing a fraction of their profits with 
the government, it would still be rational for them to invest if the rental price of 
capital exceeded the cost of capital and to disinvest if the rental price fell short of 
the cost of capital. A tax on profit, measured in this way, would not alter invest­
ment incentives.
Yet, because of the tax law’s definition of profit, the corporate income tax does 
affect investment decisions. There are many differences between the law’s defini­
tion of profit and ours. For example, one difference is the treatment of deprecia­
tion. Our definition of profit deducts the current value of depreciation as a cost. 
That is, it bases depreciation on how much it would cost today to replace worn-
out capital. By contrast, under the corporate tax laws, firms deduct depreciation 
using historical cost. That is, the depreciation deduction is based on the price of 
the capital when it was originally purchased. In periods of inflation, replacement 
cost is greater than historical cost, so the corporate tax tends to understate the 
cost of depreciation and overstate profit. As a result, the tax law sees a profit and 
levies a tax even when economic profit is zero, which makes owning capital less 
attractive. For this and other reasons, many economists believe that the corporate 
income tax discourages investment.
Policymakers often change the rules governing the corporate income tax 
in an attempt to encourage investment or at least mitigate the disincentive the 
tax provides. One example is the investment tax credit, a tax provision that 
1Economists often measure capital goods in units such that the price of 1 unit of capital equals the 
price of 1 unit of other goods and services (PK 5 P). This was the approach taken implicitly in 
Chapters 8 and 9, for example. In this case, the steady-state condition says that the marginal product 
of capital net of depreciation, MPK  d, equals the real interest rate r.

C H A P T E R  1 7   The Theory of Investment  | 515
reduces a firm’s taxes by a certain amount for each dollar spent on capital goods. 
Because a firm recoups part of its expenditure on new capital in lower taxes, 
the credit reduces the effective purchase price of a unit of capital PK. Thus, the 
investment tax credit reduces the cost of capital and raises investment.
In 1985 the investment tax credit was 10 percent. Yet the Tax Reform Act of 
1986, which reduced the corporate income tax rate, also eliminated the invest­
ment tax credit. When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, he campaigned on 
a platform of reinstituting the investment tax credit, but he did not succeed in 
getting this proposal through Congress. Many economists agreed with Clinton 
that the investment tax credit is an effective way to stimulate investment, and the 
idea of reinstating the investment tax credit still arises from time to time.
The tax rules regarding depreciation are another example of how policymak­
ers can influence the incentives for investment. When George W. Bush became 
president, the economy was sliding into recession, attributable in large measure 
to a significant decline in business investment. The tax cuts Bush signed into law 
during his first term included provisions for temporary “bonus depreciation.” 
This meant that for purposes of calculating their corporate tax liability, firms 
could deduct the cost of depreciation earlier in the life of an investment project. 
This bonus, however, was available only for investments made before the end of 
2004. The goal of the policy was to encourage investment at a time when the 
economy particularly needed a boost to aggregate demand. According to a study 
by economists Christopher House and Matthew Shapiro, the goal was achieved 
to some degree. They write, “While their aggregate effects were probably mod­
est, the 2002 and 2003 bonus depreciation policies had noticeable effects on the 
economy. For the U.S. economy as a whole, these policies may have increased 
GDP by $10 to $20 billion and may have been responsible for the creation of 
100,000 to 200,000 jobs.” In 2011, as the economy was in the midst of the next 
recession, President Obama signed into law a similar measure for temporary 
bonus depreciation.2

Policy and Investment Behavior,” American Economic Review 57 (June 1967): 391–414. For a study of 
the recent corporate tax changes, see Christopher L. House and Matthew D. Shapiro, “Temporary 
Investment Tax Incentives: Theory With Evidence From Bonus Depreciation,” American Economic

CASE STUDY
Inversions and Corporate Tax Reform
“Some people are calling these companies ‘corporate deserters.’ ” That is what 
President Obama said in 2013 about a wave of tax inversions sweeping across 
corporate America, and he did not disagree with the description.
A tax inversion occurs when an American company merges with a foreign 
one and, in the process, reincorporates abroad. Such mergers have many motives, 
but often one of them is to take advantage of the more favorable tax treatment 

516 |  P A R T  V   Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
offered by some other nations. Because such tax inversions mean less money for 
the U.S. Treasury, everyone else ends up either paying higher taxes to support the 
government or enjoying fewer government services. So the president had good 
reason to be concerned.
Yet demonizing the companies and their executives may not be the best 
response. A corporate chief who arranges a merger that increases the company’s 
after-tax profit is doing her job. Forgoing that opportunity would be failing to 
act as a responsible fiduciary for shareholders. The great twentieth-century jurist 
Learned Hand put the principle this way: “Anyone may arrange his affairs so that 
his taxes shall be as low as possible; he is not bound to choose that pattern which 
best pays the treasury. There is not even a patriotic duty to increase one’s taxes.”
If tax inversions are a problem, perhaps the blame lies not with business lead­
ers who are doing their jobs, but rather with a tax code that provides incentives 
for these inversions.
One obvious issue is that the corporate tax rate in the United States is about 
twice the average rate in Europe. National tax systems differ along many dimen­
sions, making international comparisons difficult and controversial. Nonetheless, 
some economists suggest that simply cutting the rate to be more in line with 
norms abroad would do a lot to stop inversions.
A more subtle issue is that the United States has a type of corporate tax that 
differs from that of most nations. The United States has a worldwide corporate tax: 
for companies incorporated in the United States, the tax is based on all income, 
regardless of where it is earned. Most other nations have a territorial corporate 
tax: they tax economic activity that occurs within their borders and exclude from 
taxation income earned abroad. (That foreign-source income, however, is usually 
taxed by the nation where it is earned.) Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, 
and the United Kingdom all have territorial tax systems. Again, some economists 
suggest that moving the U.S. tax code toward international norms would help 
slow corporate inversions.
If the U.S. government were to make these changes in its corporate tax, it 
might well collect less in tax revenue and so other taxes would need to increase 
to finance government spending. The debate about the corporate tax is thus 
intertwined with the broader debate about tax policy in general. An important 
principle when considering these issues is that corporations are more like tax 
collectors than taxpayers. The burden of the corporate tax is ultimately borne by 
people—some combination of the companies’ employees, customers, and share­
holders. After recognizing that corporations are mere conduits, policymakers can 
focus more directly on the people.
A long tradition in political philosophy and economics, dating back about 
four centuries to English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, suggests that the amount 
that a person consumes is the right basis for taxation. A consumption tax asks 
a person to contribute to support the government according to how much of 
the economy’s output of goods and services she enjoys. Some economists have 
suggested scaling back the corporate income tax and replacing the lost revenue 
with a broad-based tax on consumption, such as a value-added tax, which many 
European nations use to raise government revenue.

The Stock Market and Tobin’s q
Many economists see a link between fluctuations in investment and fluctua­
tions in the stock market. The term stock refers to shares in the ownership 
of corporations, and the stock market is the market in which these shares 
are traded. Stock prices tend to be high when firms have many opportuni­
ties for profitable investment because these profit opportunities mean higher 
future income for the shareholders. Thus, stock prices reflect the incentives 
to invest.
The Nobel Prize–winning economist James Tobin proposed that firms base 
their investment decisions on the following ratio, which is now called Tobin’s q:
q 5 
Market Value of Installed Capital
Replacement Cost of Installed Capital .
The numerator of Tobin’s q is the value of the economy’s capital as determined 
by the stock market. The denominator is the price of that capital if it were pur­
chased today.
Tobin reasoned that net investment should depend on whether q is greater or 
less than 1. If q is greater than 1, then the stock market values installed capital at 
more than its replacement cost. In this case, managers can raise the market value 
of their firms’ stock by buying more capital. Conversely, if q is less than 1, the 
stock market values capital at less than its replacement cost. In this case, managers 
will not replace capital as it wears out.
At first the q theory of investment may appear very different from the 
neoclassical model developed previously, but the two theories are closely 
related. To see the relationship, note that Tobin’s q depends on current and 
future expected profits from installed capital. If the marginal product of capital 
exceeds the cost of capital, then firms are earning profits on their installed 
capital. These profits make the firms more desirable to own, which raises the 
market value of these firms’ stock, implying a high value of q. Similarly, if the 
marginal product of capital falls short of the cost of capital, then firms are 
incurring losses on their installed capital, implying a low market value and a 
low value of q.
The advantage of Tobin’s q as a measure of the incentive to invest is that it 
reflects the expected future profitability of capital as well as the current profit­
ability. For example, suppose that Congress legislates a reduction in the corporate 
income tax beginning next year. This expected fall in the corporate tax means 
Policymakers of many political stripes have advocated reform of the U.S. cor­
porate tax, but the devil is in the details. Three questions loom large: To what 
extent should the United States cut the corporate tax rate to match rates abroad? 
Should the United States switch from a worldwide to a territorial system? Which 
other taxes should increase to make up for the lost revenue? Corporate tax 
reform will become possible only when policymakers agree on the answers to 
these key questions. n

518 |  P A R T  V   Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
greater profits for the owners of capital. These higher expected profits raise the 
value of stock today, raise Tobin’s q, and therefore encourage investment today. 
Thus, Tobin’s q theory of investment emphasizes that investment decisions 
depend not only on current economic policies but also on policies expected to 
prevail in the future.3

The Stock Market as an Economic Indicator
“The stock market has predicted nine out of the last five recessions.” So goes 
Paul Samuelson’s famous quip about the stock market’s reliability as an eco­
nomic indicator. The stock market is in fact quite volatile, and it can give false 
signals about the future of the economy. Yet one should not ignore the link 
between the stock market and the economy. Figure 17-4 shows that changes in 
the stock market often reflect changes in real GDP. Whenever the stock market

Alternative Views of the Stock Market: The Efficient 
Markets Hypothesis Versus Keynes’s Beauty Contest
One continuing source of debate among economists is whether stock market 
fluctuations are rational.
Some economists subscribe to the efficient markets hypothesis, according 
to which the market price of a company’s stock is the fully rational valuation 
of the company’s value, given current information about the company’s business 
prospects. This hypothesis rests on two foundations:
	1.	Each company listed on a major stock exchange is followed closely by 
many professional portfolio managers, such as the individuals who run 
mutual funds. Every day, these managers monitor news stories to try to 
determine the company’s value. Their job is to buy a stock when its price 
falls below its value and to sell it when its price rises above its value.
	2.	The price of each stock is set by the equilibrium of supply and demand. 
At the market price, the number of shares being offered for sale exactly equals 
the number of shares that people want to buy. That is, at the market price, 
the number of people who think the stock is overvalued exactly balances the 
number of people who think it’s undervalued. As judged by the typical person 
in the market, the stock must be fairly valued.
experiences a substantial decline, there is reason to fear that a recession may be 
around the corner.
Why do stock prices and economic activity tend to fluctuate together? One 
reason is given by Tobin’s q theory, together with the model of aggregate demand 
and aggregate supply. Suppose, for instance, that you observe a fall in stock prices. 
Because the replacement cost of capital is fairly stable, a fall in the stock market 
is usually associated with a fall in Tobin’s q. A fall in q reflects investors’ pessimism 
about the current or future profitability of capital. This means that the investment 
function has shifted inward: investment is lower at any given interest rate. As a 
result, the aggregate demand for goods and services contracts, leading to lower 
output and employment.
There are two additional reasons that stock prices are associated with eco­
nomic activity. First, because stock is part of household wealth, a fall in stock 
prices makes people poorer and thus depresses consumer spending, which also 
reduces aggregate demand. Second, a fall in stock prices might reflect bad news 
about technological progress and long-run economic growth. If so, this means 
that the natural level of output—and thus aggregate supply—will be growing 
more slowly in the future than was previously expected.
These links between the stock market and the economy are not lost on 
policymakers, such as those at the Federal Reserve. Indeed, because the stock 
market often anticipates changes in real GDP, and because data on the stock 
market are available more quickly than data on GDP, the stock market is a closely 
watched economic indicator. A case in point is the deep economic downturn 
in 2008 and 2009: the substantial declines in production and employment 
coincided with a steep decline in stock prices. n

520 |  P A R T  V   Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
According to this theory, the stock market is informationally efficient: it reflects all 
available information about the value of the asset. Stock prices change when 
information changes. When good news about the company’s prospects becomes 
public, the value and the stock price both rise. When the company’s prospects 
deteriorate, the value and price both fall. But at any moment in time, the mar­
ket price is the rational best guess of the company’s value based on available 
­information.
One implication of the efficient markets hypothesis is that stock prices 
should follow a random walk. This means that the changes in stock prices 
should be impossible to predict from available information. If, using publicly 
available information, a person could predict that a stock price would rise by 
10 percent tomorrow, then the stock market must be failing to incorporate 
that information today. According to this theory, the only thing that can move 
stock prices is news that changes the market’s perception of the company’s 
value. But such news must be unpredictable—otherwise, it wouldn’t really be 
news. For the same reason, changes in stock prices should be unpredictable 
as well.
What is the evidence for the efficient markets hypothesis? Its proponents 
point out that it is hard to beat the market by buying allegedly undervalued 
stocks and selling allegedly overvalued stocks. Statistical tests show that stock 
prices are random walks, or at least approximately so. Moreover, index funds, 
which buy stocks from all companies in a stock market index, outperform most 
actively managed mutual funds run by professional money managers.
Although the efficient markets hypothesis has many proponents, some econo­
mists are less convinced that the stock market is so rational. These economists 
point out that many movements in stock prices are hard to attribute to news. 
They suggest that when buying and selling, stock investors are less focused on 
companies’ fundamental values and more focused on what they expect other 
investors will later pay.
John Maynard Keynes proposed a famous analogy to explain stock mar­
ket speculation. In his day, some newspapers held beauty contests in which 
the paper printed the pictures of 100 women and readers were invited to 
submit a list of the five most beautiful. A prize went to the reader whose 
choices most closely matched those of the consensus of the other entrants. 
Naive entrants would simply have picked those they considered the five most 
beautiful women. But a slightly more sophisticated strategy would have been 
to guess the five women whom other people considered the most beauti­
ful. Other people, however, were likely thinking along the same lines. So an 
even more sophisticated strategy would have been to try to guess who other 
people thought other people thought were the most beautiful women. And 
so on. In the end of the process, judging true beauty would be less important 
to winning the contest than guessing other people’s opinions about other 
people’s opinions.
Similarly, Keynes reasoned that because stock market investors will eventually 
sell their shares to others, they are more concerned about other people’s valua­
tion of a company than the company’s true worth. The best stock investors, in 

C H A P T E R  1 7   The Theory of Investment  | 521
his view, are those who are good at outguessing mass psychology. He believed 
that movements in stock prices often reflect irrational waves of optimism and 
pessimism, which he called the “animal spirits” of investors.
These two views of the stock market persist to this day. Some economists 
see the stock market through the lens of the efficient markets hypothesis. They 
believe fluctuations in stock prices are a rational reflection of changes in underly­
ing economic fundamentals. Other economists, however, accept Keynes’s beauty 
contest as a metaphor for stock speculation. In their view, the stock market often 
fluctuates for no good reason, and because the stock market influences the aggre­
gate demand for goods and services, these fluctuations are a source of short-run 
economic fluctuations.4
Financing Constraints
When a firm wants to invest in new capital—say, by building a new factory—it 
often raises the necessary funds in financial markets. This financing may take 
several forms: obtaining loans from banks, selling bonds to the public, or selling 
shares in future profits on the stock market. The neoclassical model assumes that 
if a firm is willing to pay the cost of capital, the financial markets will make the 
funds available.
Yet sometimes firms face financing constraints—limits on the amount 
they can raise in financial markets. Financing constraints can prevent firms from 
undertaking profitable investments. When a firm is unable to raise funds in 
financial markets, the amount it can spend on new capital goods is limited to 
the amount it is currently earning. Financing constraints influence the invest­
ment behavior of firms just as borrowing constraints influence the consumption 
behavior of households. Borrowing constraints cause households to determine 
their consumption on the basis of current rather than permanent income; financ­
ing constraints cause firms to determine their investment on the basis of their 
current cash flow rather than expected profitability.
To see the impact of financing constraints, consider the effect of a short reces­
sion on investment spending. A recession reduces employment, the rental price of 
capital, and profits. If firms expect the recession to be short-lived, however, they 
will want to continue investing, knowing that their investments will be profitable 
in the future. That is, a short recession will have only a small effect on Tobin’s q. 
For firms that can raise funds in financial markets, the recession should have only 
a small effect on investment.
Quite the opposite is true for firms that face financing constraints. The 
fall in current profits restricts the amount that these firms can spend on new 
capital goods and may prevent them from making profitable investments. 
4A classic reference on the efficient markets hypothesis is Eugene Fama, “Efficient Capital Markets: 
A Review of Theory and Empirical Work,” Journal of Finance 25 (1970): 383–417. For the alterna-
tive view, see Robert J. Shiller, “From Efficient Markets Theory to Behavioral Finance,” Journal of 
Economic Perspectives 17 (Winter 2003): 83–104.

522 |  P A R T  V   Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
Thus, financing constraints make investment more sensitive to current eco­
nomic conditions.5
The extent to which financing constraints impede investment spending can 
vary over time, depending on the health of the financial system, and this can in 
turn become a source of short-run fluctuations. As we discussed in Chapter 12, 
for example, during the Great Depression of the 1930s, many banks found them­
selves insolvent, as the value of their assets fell below the value of their liabilities. 
These banks were forced to suspend operations, making it more difficult for 
their previous customers to obtain financing for potential investment projects. 
Many economists believe the widespread bank failures during this period help 
explain the Depression’s depth and persistence. Similarly, the severe recession of 
2008–2009 came on the heels of a widespread financial crisis that began with a 
downturn in the housing market. Chapter 20 discusses the causes and effects of 
such financial crises in greater detail.
 17-2	 Residential Investment
In this section we consider the determinants of residential investment. We begin 
by presenting a simple model of the housing market. Residential investment 
includes the purchase of new housing both by people who plan to live in it 
themselves and by landlords who plan to rent it to others. To keep things simple, 
however, it is useful to imagine that all housing is owner-occupied.
The Stock Equilibrium and the Flow Supply
There are two parts to the model. First, the market for the existing stock of 
houses determines the equilibrium housing price. Second, the housing price 
determines the flow of residential investment.
Panel (a) of Figure 17-5 shows how the relative price of housing PH/P is 
determined by the supply and demand for the existing stock of houses. At any 
point in time, the supply of houses is fixed. We represent this stock with a verti­
cal supply curve. The demand curve for houses slopes downward because high 
prices cause people to live in smaller houses, to share residences, or sometimes 
even to become homeless. The price of housing adjusts to equilibrate supply 
and demand.
Panel (b) of Figure 17-5 shows how the relative price of housing deter­
mines the supply of new houses. Construction firms buy materials and hire 
labor to build houses and then sell the houses at the market price. Their 
costs depend on the overall price level P (which reflects the cost of wood,

bricks, plaster, etc.), and their revenue depends on the price of houses PH. 
The higher the relative price of housing, the greater the incentive to build 
houses and the more houses are built. The flow of new houses—residential 
investment—therefore depends on the equilibrium price set in the market for 
existing houses.
This model of residential investment is similar to the q theory of business 
fixed investment. According to the q theory, business fixed investment depends 
on the market price of installed capital relative to its replacement cost; this rela­
tive price, in turn, depends on the expected profits from owning installed capital. 
According to this model of the housing market, residential investment depends 
on the relative price of housing. The relative price of housing, in turn, depends 
on the demand for housing, which depends on the imputed rent that individuals 
expect to receive from their housing. Hence, the relative price of housing plays 
much the same role for residential investment as Tobin’s q does for business fixed 
investment.
Changes in Housing Demand
When the demand for housing shifts, the equilibrium price of housing changes, 
and this change in turn affects residential investment. The demand curve for 
housing can shift for various reasons. An economic boom raises national income 
and therefore the demand for housing. A large increase in the population, 
perhaps because of immigration, also raises the demand for housing. Panel (a) 
of Figure 17-6 shows that an expansionary shift in demand raises the equilib­
rium price. Panel (b) shows that the increase in the housing price increases 
residential investment.
The Determination of Residential Investment  The relative price of hous­
ing adjusts to equilibrate supply and demand for the existing stock of housing 
capital. The relative price then determines residential investment, the flow of 
new housing that construction firms build.

One important determinant of housing demand is the real interest rate. Many 
people take out loans—mortgages—to buy their homes; the interest rate is the 
cost of the loan. Even the few people who do not have to borrow to purchase 
a home will respond to the interest rate because the interest rate is the oppor­
tunity cost of holding their wealth in housing rather than putting it in a bank. 
A reduction in the interest rate therefore raises housing demand, housing prices, 
and residential investment.
Another important determinant of housing demand is credit availability. 
When it is easy to get a loan, more households buy their own homes, and they 
buy larger ones than they otherwise might, thus increasing the demand for hous­
ing. When credit conditions become tight, fewer people buy their own homes or 
trade up to larger ones, and the demand for housing falls.
An example of this phenomenon occurred during the first decade of the 
twenty-first century. Early in this decade, interest rates were low, and mortgages 
were easy to come by. Many households with questionable credit histories—called 
subprime borrowers—were able to get mortgages with small down payments. Not 
surprisingly, the housing market boomed. Housing prices rose, and residential 
investment was strong. A few years later, however, it became clear that the situ­
ation had gotten out of hand, as many of these subprime borrowers could not 
keep up with their mortgage payments. When interest rates rose and credit condi­
tions tightened, housing demand and housing prices started to fall. Figure 17-7 
illustrates the movement of housing prices and housing starts during this period. 
When the housing market turned down in 2007 and 2008, the result was a sig­
nificant downturn in the overall economy, which is discussed in a Case Study in 
Chapter 12.
An Increase in Housing Demand  An increase in housing demand, perhaps 
attributable to a fall in the interest rate, raises housing prices and residential 
investment.

 17-3	 Inventory Investment
Inventory investment—the goods that businesses put aside in storage—is at the 
same time negligible and of great significance. It is one of the smallest compo­
nents of spending, averaging about 1 percent of GDP. Yet its remarkable volatility 
makes it central to the study of economic fluctuations. In recessions, firms stop 
replenishing their inventory as goods are sold, and inventory investment becomes 
negative. In a typical recession, more than half the fall in spending comes from a 
decline in inventory investment.
Reasons for Holding Inventories
Inventories serve many purposes. Let’s discuss in broad terms some of the 
motives firms have for holding inventories.
One use of inventories is to smooth the level of production over time. Con­
sider a firm that experiences temporary booms and busts in sales. Rather than 
adjusting production to match the fluctuations in sales, the firm may find it 
cheaper to produce goods at a steady rate. When sales are low, the firm produces 
more than it sells and puts the extra goods into inventory. When sales are high, 
the firm produces less than it sells and takes goods out of inventory. This motive 
for holding inventories is called production smoothing.
A second reason for holding inventories is that they may allow a firm to 
operate more efficiently. Retail stores, for example, can sell merchandise more 
effectively if they have goods on hand to show to customers. Manufacturing 
firms keep inventories of spare parts to reduce the time that the assembly line is 
shut down when a machine breaks. In some ways, we can view inventories as 
a factor of production: the larger the stock of inventories a firm holds, the 
more output it can produce.
A third reason for holding inventories is to avoid running out of goods when 
sales are unexpectedly high. Firms often have to make production decisions 
before knowing the level of customer demand. For example, a publisher must 
decide how many copies of a new book to print before knowing whether the 
book will be popular. If demand exceeds production and there are no invento­
ries, the good will be out of stock for a period, and the firm will lose sales and 
profit. Inventories can prevent this from happening. This motive for holding 
inventories is called stock-out avoidance.
A fourth explanation of inventories is dictated by the production process. 
Many goods require a number of production steps and, therefore, take time to 
produce. When a product is only partly completed, its components are counted 
as part of a firm’s inventory. These inventories are called work in process.
How the Real Interest Rate and Credit Conditions 
Affect Inventory Investment
Like other components of investment, inventory investment depends on the 
real interest rate. When a firm holds a good in inventory and sells it tomorrow 

C H A P T E R  1 7   The Theory of Investment  | 527
rather than selling it today, it gives up the interest it could have earned between 
today and tomorrow. Thus, the real interest rate measures the opportunity cost 
of holding inventories.
When the real interest rate rises, holding inventories becomes more costly, so 
rational firms try to reduce their stock. Therefore, an increase in the real inter­
est rate depresses inventory investment. For example, in the 1980s many firms 
adopted “just-in-time” production plans, which were designed to reduce the 
amount of inventory by producing goods just before sale. The high real interest 
rates that prevailed during most of that decade are one possible explanation for 
this change in business strategy.
Inventory investment also depends on credit conditions. Because many 
firms rely on bank loans to finance their purchases of inventories, they cut 
back when these loans are hard to come by. During the financial crisis of 
2008–2009, for example, firms reduced their inventory holdings substan­
tially. Real inventory investment, which had been $72 billion in 2006, fell 
to negative $34 billion in 2008 and negative $148 billion in 2009. It then 
returned to positive $58 billion in 2010, as the financial system and economy 
started to recover. During this severe recession, as in many economic down­
turns, the decline in inventory investment was a key part of the decline in 
aggregate demand.
 17-4	 Conclusion
The purpose of this chapter has been to examine the determinants of invest­
ment in detail. Looking back on the various models of investment, we can see 
three themes.
First, all types of investment spending are inversely related to the real interest 
rate. A higher interest rate raises the cost of capital for firms that invest in plant 
and equipment, raises the cost of borrowing for home-buyers, and raises the cost 
of holding inventories. Thus, the models of investment developed here justify the 
investment function we have used throughout this book.
Second, various events can shift the investment function. An improvement 
in the available technology raises the marginal product of capital and raises 
business fixed investment. An increase in the population raises the demand for 
housing and raises residential investment. Most important, various economic 
policies, such as changes in the availability of an investment tax credit and 
in the corporate income tax, alter the incentives to invest and thus shift the 
investment function.
Third, it is natural to expect investment to be volatile over the business 
cycle because investment spending depends on the output of the economy 
as well as on the interest rate. In the neoclassical model of business fixed 
investment, higher employment raises the marginal product of capital and the 
incentive to invest. Higher output also raises firms’ profits and, thereby, relaxes 
the financing constraints that some firms face. In addition, higher income 
raises the demand for houses, in turn raising housing prices and residential 

528 |  P A R T  V   Topics in Macroeconomic Theory
investment. Higher output raises the stock of inventories firms wish to hold, 
stimulating inventory investment. Our models predict that an economic boom 
should stimulate investment and a recession should depress it. This is exactly 
what we observe.
Summary
	1.	The marginal product of capital determines the real rental price of capital. 
The real interest rate, the depreciation rate, and the relative price of capital 
goods determine the cost of capital. According to the neoclassical model, 
firms invest if the rental price is greater than the cost of capital, and they 
disinvest if the rental price is less than the cost of capital.
	2.	Various parts of the federal tax code influence the incentive to invest. 
The corporate income tax discourages investment, and the investment 
tax ­credit—which has now been repealed in the United States—
encourages it.
	3.	An alternative way of expressing the neoclassical model is to state that 
investment depends on Tobin’s q, the ratio of the market value of installed 
capital to its replacement cost. This ratio reflects the current and expected 
future profitability of capital. The higher q is, the greater the market value 
of installed capital relative to its replacement cost and the greater the 
incentive to invest.
	4.	Economists debate whether fluctuations in the stock market are a rational 
reflection of companies’ true value or are driven by irrational waves of 
optimism and pessimism.
	5.	In contrast to the assumption of the neoclassical model, firms cannot always 
raise funds to finance investment. Financing constraints make investment 
sensitive to firms’ current cash flow.
	6.	Residential investment depends on the relative price of housing. Housing 
prices in turn depend on the demand for housing and the current fixed 
supply. An increase in housing demand, perhaps attributable to a fall in the 
interest rate, raises housing prices and residential investment.
	7.	Firms have various motives for holding inventories of goods: smoothing 
production, using them as a factor of production, avoiding stock-outs, and 
storing work in process. How much inventories firms hold depends on the 
real interest rate and on credit conditions.

	1.	Use the neoclassical model of investment to 
explain the impact of each of the following on 
the rental price of capital, the cost of capital, and 
investment.
	a.	Anti-inflationary monetary policy raises the 
real interest rate.

	2.	Suppose that the government levies a tax on oil 
companies equal to a proportion of the value 
of the company’s oil reserves. (The government 
assures the firms that the tax is for one time 
only.) According to the neoclassical model, what 
effect will the tax have on business fixed invest­
ment by these firms? What if these firms face 
financing constraints?
	3.	The IS–LM model developed in Chapters 11 
and 12 assumes that investment depends only on 
the interest rate. Yet our theories of investment 
suggest that investment might also depend on 
national income: higher income might induce 
firms to invest more.

national income.
	b.	Suppose that investment is determined by

which measures the influence of national 
income on investment. With investment set 
this way, what are the fiscal-policy multipliers 
in the Keynesian-cross model? Explain.
	c.	Suppose that investment depends on both 
income and the interest rate. That is, the 
investment function is

where a is a parameter between zero and one 
that measures the influence of national income 
on investment and b is a parameter greater 
than zero that measures the influence of the

interest rate on investment. Use the IS–LM 
model to consider the short-run impact of an 
increase in government purchases on national 
income Y, the interest rate r, consumption C, 
and investment I. How might this investment 
function alter the conclusions implied by the 
basic IS–LM model?

does it have on investment, consumption, and 
aggregate demand? Why? How should the 
Federal Reserve respond? Why?

she takes office. What impact does this campaign 
promise have on economic conditions during 
the current year?
	6.	The United States experienced a large increase 
in the number of births in the 1950s. People in 
this baby-boom generation reached adulthood 
and started forming their own households in 
the 1970s.
	a.	Use the model of residential investment to 
predict the impact of this event on housing 
prices and residential investment.
	b.	Go to the Federal Reserve Economic Data

1970 and 1980, compute the real price of 
housing, measured as the residential invest­

What do you find? Is this finding consistent 
with the model?
	7.	U.S. tax laws encourage investment in housing 
(such as through the deductibility of mortgage 
interest for purposes of computing taxable 
income) and discourage investment in business 
capital (such as through the corporate income 
tax). What are the long-run effects of this policy?

H
ow should government policymakers respond to the business cycle? The 
two quotations above—the first from a former chairman of the Federal 
Reserve, the second from a prominent critic of the Fed—show the 
diversity of opinion over how this question is best answered.
Some economists, such as William McChesney Martin, view the economy as 
inherently unstable. They argue that the economy experiences frequent shocks 
to aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Unless policymakers use monetary 
and fiscal policy to stabilize the economy, these shocks will lead to unnecessary 
and inefficient fluctuations in output, unemployment, and inflation. According 
to the popular saying, macroeconomic policy should “lean against the wind,” 
stimulating the economy when it is depressed and slowing the economy when 
it is overheated.
Other economists, such as Milton Friedman, view the economy as naturally 
stable. They blame bad economic policies for the large and inefficient fluctua­
tions we have sometimes experienced. They argue that economic policy should 
not try to fine-tune the economy. Instead, economic policymakers should admit 
their limited abilities and be satisfied if they do no harm.

This debate has persisted for decades, with numerous protagonists advancing 
various arguments for their positions. It became especially relevant as economies 
around the world sank into a recession in 2008. The fundamental issue is how 
policymakers should use the theory of short-run economic fluctuations devel­
oped in the preceding chapters.
In this chapter we ask two questions that arise in this debate. First, should 
monetary and fiscal policy take an active role in trying to stabilize the economy, 
or should policy remain passive? Second, should policymakers be free to use their 
discretion in responding to changing economic conditions, or should they be 
committed to following a fixed policy rule?
18-1 Should Policy Be Active or Passive?
Policymakers in the federal government view economic stabilization as one of 
their primary responsibilities. The analysis of macroeconomic policy is a regular 
duty of the Council of Economic Advisers, the Congressional Budget Office, 
the Federal Reserve, and other government agencies. As we have seen in the 
preceding chapters, monetary and fiscal policy can exert a powerful impact on 
aggregate demand and, thereby, on inflation and unemployment. When Congress 
or the president is considering a major change in fiscal policy, or when the Fed­
eral Reserve is considering a major change in monetary policy, foremost in the 
discussion are how the change will influence inflation and unemployment and 
whether aggregate demand needs to be stimulated or restrained.
Although the government has long conducted monetary and fiscal policy, the 
view that it should use these policy instruments to try to stabilize the economy 
is more recent. The Employment Act of 1946 was a landmark piece of legisla­
tion in which the government first held itself accountable for macroeconomic 
performance. The act states that “it is the continuing policy and responsibility of 
the Federal Government to . . . promote full employment and production.” This 
law was written when the memory of the Great Depression was still fresh. The 
lawmakers who wrote it believed, as many economists do, that in the absence 
of an active government role in the economy, events like the Great Depression 
could occur regularly.
To many economists the case for active government policy is clear and simple. 
Recessions are periods of high unemployment, low incomes, and increased eco­
nomic hardship. The model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply shows 
how shocks to the economy can cause recessions. It also shows how monetary 
and fiscal policy can prevent (or at least soften) recessions by responding to these 
shocks. These economists consider it wasteful not to use these policy instruments 
to stabilize the economy.
Other economists are critical of the government’s attempts to stabilize the 
economy. These critics argue that the government should take a hands-off 
approach to macroeconomic policy. At first, this view might seem surprising. 
If our model shows how to prevent or reduce the severity of recessions, why 

C H A P T E R  1 8   Alternative Perspectives on Stabilization Policy  | 533
do these critics want the government to refrain from using monetary and fis­
cal policy for economic stabilization? To find out, let’s consider some of their 
arguments.
Lags in the Implementation and Effects of Policies
Economic stabilization would be easy if the effects of policy were immediate. 
Making policy would be like driving a car: policymakers would simply adjust 
their instruments to keep the economy on the desired path.
Making economic policy, however, is less like driving a car than it is like pilot­
ing a large ship. A car changes direction almost immediately after the steering 
wheel is turned. By contrast, a ship changes course long after the pilot adjusts the 
rudder, and once the ship starts to turn, it continues turning long after the rudder 
is set back to normal. A novice pilot is likely to oversteer and, after noticing the 
mistake, overreact by steering too much in the opposite direction. The ship’s path 
could become unstable, as the novice responds to previous mistakes by making 
larger and larger corrections.
Like a ship’s pilot, economic policymakers face the problem of long lags. 
Indeed, the problem for policymakers is even more difficult, because the lengths 
of the lags are hard to predict. These long and variable lags greatly complicate 
the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy.
Economists distinguish between two lags that are relevant for the conduct of 
stabilization policy: the inside lag and the outside lag. The inside lag is the time 
between a shock to the economy and the policy action responding to that shock. 
This lag arises because it takes time for policymakers first to recognize that a 
shock has occurred and then to put appropriate policies into effect. The outside 
lag is the time between a policy action and its influence on the economy. This 
lag arises because policies do not immediately influence spending, income, and 
employment.
A long inside lag is a central problem with using fiscal policy for economic 
stabilization. This is especially true in the United States, where changes in 
spending or taxes require the approval of the president and both houses of 
Congress. The slow and cumbersome legislative process often leads to delays, 
which make fiscal policy an imprecise tool for stabilizing the economy. This 
inside lag is shorter in countries with parliamentary systems, such as the United 
Kingdom, because there the party in power can often enact policy changes 
more rapidly.
Monetary policy has a much shorter inside lag than fiscal policy because a 
central bank can decide on and implement a policy change in less than a day, but 
monetary policy has a substantial outside lag. Monetary policy works by chang­
ing the money supply and interest rates, which in turn influence investment and 
aggregate demand. Many firms make investment plans far in advance, however, 
so a change in monetary policy is thought not to affect economic activity until 
about six months after it is made.
The long and variable lags associated with monetary and fiscal policy certainly 
make stabilizing the economy more difficult. Advocates of passive policy argue 

534 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
that, because of these lags, successful stabilization policy is almost impossible. 
Indeed, attempts to stabilize the economy can be destabilizing. Suppose that the 
economy’s condition changes between the beginning of a policy action and its 
impact on the economy. In this case, active policy may end up stimulating the 
economy when it is heating up or depressing the economy when it is cooling off. 
Advocates of active policy admit that such lags do require policymakers to be 
cautious. But, they argue, these lags do not necessarily mean that policy should 
be completely passive, especially in the face of a severe and protracted economic 
downturn, such as the recession that began in 2008.
Some policies, called automatic stabilizers, are designed to reduce the 
lags associated with stabilization policy. Automatic stabilizers are policies that 
stimulate or depress the economy when necessary without any deliberate policy 
change. For example, the system of income taxes automatically reduces taxes 
when the economy goes into a recession: without any change in the tax laws, 
individuals and corporations pay less tax when their incomes fall. Similarly, 
the unemployment-insurance and welfare systems automatically raise transfer 
payments when the economy moves into a recession because more people apply 
for benefits. One can view these automatic stabilizers as a type of fiscal policy 
without any inside lag.
The Difficult Job of Economic Forecasting
Because policy influences the economy only after a long lag, successful stabiliza­
tion policy requires the ability to accurately predict future economic conditions. 
If we cannot predict whether the economy will be in a boom or a recession 
in six months or a year, we cannot evaluate whether 
monetary and fiscal policy should now be trying to 
expand or contract aggregate demand. Unfortunately, 
economic developments are often unpredictable, at 
least given our current understanding of the economy.
One way forecasters try to look ahead is with 
leading indicators. As we discussed in Chapter 10, a lead­
ing indicator is a data series that fluctuates in advance 
of the economy. A large fall in a leading indicator 
signals that a recession is more likely to occur in the 
coming months.
Another way forecasters look ahead is with macro­
econometric models, which have been developed both by 
government agencies and by private firms. A macro­
econometric model is a model that describes the economy quantitatively, rather 
than just qualitatively. Many of these models are essentially more complicated and 
more realistic versions of the dynamic model of aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply we learned about in Chapter 15. The economists who build macroecono­
metric models use historical data to estimate the model’s parameters. Once a 
model is built, economists can simulate the effects of alternative policies. The 
model can also be used for forecasting. After the model’s user makes assumptions

Mistakes in Forecasting
“Light showers, bright intervals, and moderate winds.” This was the forecast 
offered by the renowned British national weather service on October 14, 1987. 
The next day Britain was hit by its worst storm in more than two centuries.
Like weather forecasts, economic forecasts are a crucial input to private and pub­
lic decisionmaking. Business executives rely on economic forecasts when deciding 
how much to produce and how much to invest in plant and equipment. Govern­
ment policymakers also rely on forecasts when developing economic policies. 
Unfortunately, like weather forecasts, economic forecasts are far from precise.
The most severe economic downturn in U.S. history, the Great Depression 
of the 1930s, caught economic forecasters completely by surprise. Even after the 
stock market crash of 1929, they remained confident that the economy would 
not suffer a substantial setback. In late 1931, when the economy was clearly in 
bad shape, the eminent economist Irving Fisher predicted that it would recover 
quickly. Subsequent events showed that these forecasts were much too optimistic: 
the unemployment rate continued to rise until 1933 when it hit 25 percent, and 
it remained elevated for the rest of the decade.1
Figure 18-1 shows how economic forecasters did during the recession of 
2008–2009, the most severe economic downturn in the United States since the 
Great Depression. This figure shows the actual unemployment rate (in red) and 
several attempts to predict it for the following five quarters (in green). You can 
see that the forecasters did well when predicting unemployment one or two 
quarters ahead. The more distant forecasts, however, were often inaccurate. The 
November 2007 Survey of Professional Forecasters predicted a slowdown, but 
only a modest one: the U.S. unemployment rate was projected to increase from 
4.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 to 5.0 percent in the fourth quarter 
of 2008. By the May 2008 survey, the forecasters had raised their predictions for 
unemployment at the end of the year, but only to 5.5 percent. In fact, the unem­
ployment rate was 6.9 percent in the last quarter of 2008. The forecasters became 
more pessimistic as the recession unfolded, but still not pessimistic enough. 
In November 2008, they predicted that the unemployment rate would rise to 
7.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009. In fact, it rose to about 10 percent.

other endogenous variables. Keep in mind, however, that the validity of these 
predictions is only as good as the model and the forecasters’ assumptions about 
the exogenous variables.

The Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Recession of 2008–2009 show 
that many of the most dramatic economic events are unpredictable. Private and 
public decisionmakers have little choice but to rely on economic forecasts, but they 
must always keep in mind that these forecasts come with a large margin of error. n
Ignorance, Expectations, and the Lucas Critique
The prominent economist Robert Lucas once wrote, “As an advice-giving 
profession we are in way over our heads.” Even many of those who advise 
policymakers would agree with this assessment. Economics is a young science, 
and there is still much that we do not know. Economists cannot be completely 
confident when they assess the effects of alternative policies. This ignorance sug­
gests that economists should be cautious when offering policy advice.
In his writings on macroeconomic policymaking, Lucas has emphasized that 
economists need to pay more attention to the issue of how people form expec­
tations of the future. Expectations play a crucial role in the economy because

they influence all sorts of behavior. For instance, households decide how much 
to consume based on how much they expect to earn in the future, and firms 
decide how much to invest based on their expectations of future profitability. 
These expectations depend on many things, but one factor, according to Lucas, 
is especially important: the policies being pursued by the government. When 
policymakers estimate the effect of any policy change, therefore, they need to 
know how people’s expectations will respond to the policy change. Lucas has 
argued that traditional methods of policy evaluation—such as those that rely on 
standard macroeconometric models—do not adequately take into account the 
impact of policy on expectations. This criticism of traditional policy evaluation 
is known as the Lucas critique.2
An important example of the Lucas critique arises in the analysis of disinfla­
tion. As you may recall from Chapter 14, the cost of reducing inflation is often 
measured by the sacrifice ratio, which is the number of percentage points of 
GDP that must be forgone to reduce inflation by 1 percentage point. Because 
estimates of the sacrifice ratio are often large, they have led some economists to 
argue that policymakers should learn to live with inflation, rather than incur the 
large cost of reducing it.
According to advocates of the rational-expectations approach, however, these 
estimates of the sacrifice ratio are unreliable because they are subject to the Lucas 
critique. Traditional estimates of the sacrifice ratio are based on adaptive expecta­
tions, that is, on the assumption that expected inflation depends on past inflation. 
Adaptive expectations may be a reasonable premise in some circumstances, but 
if the policymakers make a credible change in policy, workers and firms setting 
wages and prices will rationally respond by adjusting their expectations of infla­
tion appropriately. This change in inflation expectations will quickly alter the 
short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. As a result, reducing 
inflation can potentially be much less costly than is suggested by traditional esti­
mates of the sacrifice ratio.
The Lucas critique leaves us with two lessons. The narrow lesson is that econ­
omists evaluating alternative policies need to consider how policy affects expec­
tations and, thereby, behavior. The broad lesson is that policy evaluation is hard, 
so economists engaged in this task should be sure to show the requisite humility.
The Historical Record
In judging whether government policy should play an active or passive role in the 
economy, we must give some weight to the historical record. If the economy has 
experienced many large shocks to aggregate supply and aggregate demand, and if 
policy has successfully insulated the economy from these shocks, then the case for 
active policy should be clear. Conversely, if the economy has experienced few large 
shocks, and if the fluctuations we have observed can be traced to inept economic

538 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
policy, then the case for passive policy should be clear. In other words, our view of 
stabilization policy should be influenced by whether policy has historically been 
stabilizing or destabilizing. For this reason, the debate over macroeconomic policy 
frequently turns into a debate over macroeconomic history.
Yet history does not settle the debate over stabilization policy. Disagreements 
over history arise because it is not easy to identify the sources of economic fluc­
tuations. The historical record often permits more than one interpretation.
The Great Depression is a case in point. Economists’ views on macroeconomic 
policy are often related to their views on the cause of the Depression. Some 
economists believe that a large contractionary shock to private spending caused 
the Depression. They assert that policymakers should have responded by using 
the tools of monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate aggregate demand. Other 
economists believe that the large fall in the money supply caused the Depression. 
They assert that the Depression would have been avoided if the Fed had been 
pursuing a passive monetary policy of increasing the money supply at a steady 
rate. Hence, depending on one’s beliefs about its cause, the Great Depression 
can be viewed either as an example of why active monetary and fiscal policy is 
necessary or as an example of why it is dangerous.
Is the Stabilization of the Economy a Figment of
the Data?
Keynes wrote The General Theory in the 1930s, and in the wake of the Keynesian 
revolution, governments around the world began to view economic stabiliza­
tion as a primary responsibility. Some economists believe that the development 
of Keynesian theory has had a profound influence on the behavior of the 
economy. Comparing data from before World War I and after World War II, 
they find that real GDP and unemployment have become much more stable. 
This, some Keynesians claim, is the best argument for active stabilization policy: 
it has worked.
In a series of provocative and influential papers, economist Christina Romer 
has challenged this assessment of the historical record. She argues that the mea­
sured reduction in volatility reflects not an improvement in economic policy and 
performance but rather an improvement in the economic data. The older data are 
much less accurate than the newer data. Romer claims that the higher volatility 
of unemployment and real GDP reported for the period before World War I is 
largely a figment of the data.
Romer uses various techniques to make her case. One is to construct more 
accurate data for the earlier period. This task is difficult because data sources are 
not readily available. A second way is to construct less accurate data for the recent 
period—that is, data that are comparable to the older data and thus suffer from the 
same imperfections. After constructing new “bad” data, Romer finds that the recent 
period appears almost as volatile as the early period, suggesting that the volatility of 
the early period may be largely an artifact of how the data were assembled.

How Does Policy Uncertainty Affect the Economy?
When monetary and fiscal policymakers actively try to control the economy, the 
future course of economic policy is often uncertain. Policymakers do not always 
make their intentions clear. Moreover, because the policy outcome can be the 
result of a divisive, contentious, and unpredictable political process, the public has 
every reason to be unsure about what policy decisions will end up being made.
In recent research, economists Scott Baker, Nicholas Bloom, and Steve Davis 
studied the effects of policy uncertainty. Baker, Bloom, and Davis began by con­
structing an index that measures how the amount of policy uncertainty changes 
over time. Their index has three components.
The first component is derived from reading articles in newspapers. Starting in 
January 1985, they searched ten major papers for terms related to economic and 
policy uncertainty. In particular, they searched for articles containing the term 
“uncertainty” or “uncertain,” the term “economic” or “economy,” and at least 
one of the following terms: “congress,” “legislation,” “white house,” “regulation,” 
“federal reserve,” or “deficit.” The more articles there were that included terms 
in all three categories, the higher the index of policy uncertainty.
The second component of the index is based on the number of temporary provi­
sions in the federal tax code. Baker, Bloom, and Davis reasoned that “temporary tax 
measures are a source of uncertainty for businesses and households because Congress 
often extends them at the last minute, undermining stability in and certainty about 
the tax code.” The more temporary tax provisions there are, and the larger the dollar 
magnitudes involved in the provisions, the higher the index of policy uncertainty.
The third component of the index is based on the amount of disagreement 
among private forecasters about several key variables related to macroeconomic 
policy. Baker, Bloom, and Davis assumed that the more private forecasters disagree 
about the future price level and future levels of government spending, the more 
uncertainty there is about monetary and fiscal policy. That is, the greater the disper­
sion in these private forecasts, the higher the level of the policy uncertainty index.
Figure 18-2 shows the index derived from these three components. The 
index spikes upward, indicating an increase in policy uncertainty, when there is a 
significant foreign policy event (such as war or terrorist attack), when there is an 
economic crisis (such as the Black Monday stock market crash or the bankruptcy 
CASE STUDY
Romer’s work is part of the continuing debate over whether macroeconomic 
policy has improved the performance of the economy. Although her work 
remains controversial, most economists now believe that the economy in the 
immediate aftermath of the Keynesian revolution was only slightly more stable 
than it had been before.3 n

of the large investment bank Lehman Brothers), or when there is a major politi­
cal event (such as the election of a new president).
With this index in hand, Baker, Bloom, and Davis then investigated how policy 
uncertainty correlates with macroeconomic performance. They found that higher 
uncertainty about economic policy depresses the economy. In particular, when 
economic policy uncertainty rises, investment, production, and employment are 
likely to decline over the next year (relative to their normal growth).
One possible explanation for this effect is that uncertainty may depress the 
aggregate demand for goods and services. When policy uncertainty increases, 
households and firms may put off some large purchases until the uncertainty is 
resolved. For example, if a firm is considering building a new factory, and the 
profitability of the investment depends on what policy is pursued, the firm may 
decide to wait until a policy decision is made. Such a delay is rational for the 
firm, but it contributes to a decline in aggregate demand, which reduces the 
economy’s output and raises unemployment.
To be sure, some policy uncertainty is inevitable. But it is good for policymakers to 
keep in mind that the amount of uncertainty is, to some degree, under their control 
and that heightened uncertainty appears to have adverse macroeconomic effects.4 n

Should Policy Be Conducted by 
Rule or by Discretion?
A second topic debated among economists is whether economic policy should 
be conducted by rule or by discretion. Policy is conducted by rule if policymakers 
announce in advance how policy will respond to various situations and commit 
themselves to following through on this announcement. Policy is conducted by 
discretion if policymakers are free to size up events as they occur and choose 
whatever policy they consider appropriate at the time.
The debate over rules versus discretion is distinct from the debate over passive 
versus active policy. Policy can be conducted by rule and yet be either passive 
or active. For example, a passive policy rule might specify steady growth in the 
money supply of 3 percent per year. An active policy rule might specify that
Money Growth 5 3% 1 (Unemployment Rate 2 6%).
Under this rule, the money supply grows at 3 percent if the unemployment rate 
is 6 percent, but for every percentage point by which the unemployment rate 
exceeds 6 percent, money growth increases by an extra percentage point. This 
rule tries to stabilize the economy by raising money growth when the economy 
is in a recession.
We begin this section by discussing why policy might be improved by a com­
mitment to a policy rule. We then examine several possible policy rules.
Distrust of Policymakers and the Political Process
Some economists believe that economic policy is too important to be left to the 
discretion of policymakers. Although this view is more political than economic, 
evaluating it is central to how we judge the role of economic policy. If politi­
cians are incompetent or opportunistic, then we may not want to give them the 
discretion to use the powerful tools of monetary and fiscal policy.
Incompetence in economic policy arises for several reasons. Some economists 
view the political process as erratic, perhaps because it reflects the shifting power 
of special-interest groups. In addition, macroeconomics is complicated, and poli­
ticians often do not have sufficient knowledge of it to make informed judgments. 
This ignorance allows charlatans to propose incorrect but superficially appealing 
solutions to complex problems. The political process often cannot weed out the 
advice of charlatans from that of competent economists.
Opportunism in economic policy arises when the objectives of policymakers 
conflict with the well-being of the public. Some economists fear that politicians 
use macroeconomic policy to further their own electoral ends. If citizens vote 
on the basis of economic conditions prevailing at the time of the election, then 
politicians have an incentive to pursue policies that will make the economy 
look good during election years. A president might cause a recession soon after 
coming into office to lower inflation and then stimulate the economy as the 
next election approaches to lower unemployment; this would ensure that both 

542 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
inflation and unemployment are low on election day. Manipulation of the econ­
omy for electoral gain, called the political business cycle, has been the subject 
of extensive research by economists and political scientists.5
Distrust of the political process leads some economists to advocate placing 
economic policy outside the realm of politics. Some have proposed ­constitutional 
amendments, such as a balanced-budget amendment, that would tie the hands of 
legislators and insulate the economy from both incompetence and opportunism. 
We discuss some potential problems with a balanced-budget amendment in the 
next chapter.
The Time Inconsistency of Discretionary Policy
If we assume that we can trust our policymakers, discretion at first glance appears 
superior to a fixed policy rule. Discretionary policy is, by its nature, flexible. 
As long as policymakers are intelligent and benevolent, there might appear to 
be little reason to deny them flexibility in responding to changing conditions.
Yet a case for rules over discretion arises from the problem of time 
inconsistency of policy. In some situations policymakers may want to announce 
in advance the policy they will follow to influence the expectations of private 
decisionmakers. But later, after the private decisionmakers have acted on the basis 
of their expectations, these policymakers may be tempted to renege on their 
announcement. Understanding that policymakers may be inconsistent over time, 
private decisionmakers are led to distrust policy announcements. In this situation, 
to make their announcements credible, policymakers may want to make a com­
mitment to a fixed policy rule.
Time inconsistency is illustrated most simply with a political rather than an 
economic example—specifically, public policy about negotiating with terrorists 
over the release of hostages. The announced policy of many nations is that they 
will not negotiate over hostages. Such an announcement is intended to deter 
terrorists: if there is nothing to be gained from kidnapping hostages, rational ter­
rorists won’t kidnap any. In other words, the purpose of the announcement is to 
influence the expectations of terrorists and thereby their behavior.
But, in fact, unless the policymakers are credibly committed to the policy, 
the announcement has little effect. Terrorists know that once hostages are taken, 
policymakers face an overwhelming temptation to make some concession 
to obtain the hostages’ release. The only way to deter rational terrorists is to 
take away the discretion of policymakers and commit them to a rule of never 
negotiating. If policymakers were truly unable to make concessions, the incentive 
for terrorists to take hostages would be largely eliminated.
The same problem arises less dramatically in the conduct of monetary policy. 
Consider the dilemma of a Federal Reserve that cares about both inflation and 
unemployment. According to the Phillips curve, the tradeoff between inflation

Edward Tufte, Political Control of the Economy (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1978).

C H A P T E R  1 8   Alternative Perspectives on Stabilization Policy  | 543
and unemployment depends on expected inflation. The Fed would prefer every­
one to expect low inflation so that it will face a favorable tradeoff. To reduce 
expected inflation, the Fed might announce that low inflation is the paramount 
goal of monetary policy.
But an announcement of a policy of low inflation is by itself not credible. 
Once households and firms have formed their expectations of inflation and 
set wages and prices accordingly, the Fed has an incentive to renege on its 
announcement and implement expansionary monetary policy to reduce unem­
ployment. People understand the Fed’s incentive to renege and therefore do not 
believe the announcement in the first place. Just as a president facing a hostage 
crisis is sorely tempted to negotiate their release, a Federal Reserve with discre­
tion is sorely tempted to inflate in order to reduce unemployment. And just as 
terrorists discount announced policies of never negotiating, households and firms 
discount announced policies of low inflation.
The surprising outcome of this analysis is that policymakers can sometimes 
better achieve their goals by having their discretion taken away from them. In the 
case of rational terrorists, fewer hostages will be taken and killed if policymakers 
are committed to following the seemingly harsh rule of refusing to negotiate 
for hostages’ freedom. In the case of monetary policy, there will be lower infla­
tion without higher unemployment if the Fed is committed to a policy of zero 
inflation. (This conclusion about monetary policy is modeled more explicitly in 
the appendix to this chapter.)
The time inconsistency of policy arises in many other contexts. Here are some 
examples:
n	 To encourage investment, the government announces that it will not 
tax income from capital. But after factories have been built, the 
government is tempted to renege on its promise to raise more tax 
revenue from them.
n	 To encourage research, the government announces that it will give a 
temporary monopoly to companies that discover new drugs. But after 
a drug has been discovered, the government is tempted to revoke the 
patent or to regulate the price to make the drug more affordable.
n	 To encourage good behavior, a parent announces that he will punish a 
child whenever the child breaks a rule. But after the child has misbe­
haved, the parent is tempted to forgive the transgression because punish­
ment is unpleasant for the parent as well as for the child.
n	 To encourage you to work hard, your professor announces that this 
course will end with an exam. But after you have studied and learned 
all the material, the professor is tempted to cancel the exam so that he 
won’t have to grade it.
In each case, rational agents understand the incentive for the policymaker to 
renege, and this expectation affects their behavior. And in each case, the solution 
is to take away the policymaker’s discretion with a credible commitment to a 
fixed policy rule.

544 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
Rules for Monetary Policy
Even if we are convinced that policy rules are superior to discretion, the debate 
over macroeconomic policy is not over. If the Fed were to commit to a rule for 
monetary policy, what rule should it choose? Let’s briefly discuss three policy 
rules that various economists advocate.
Some economists, called monetarists, advocate that the Fed keep the money 
supply growing at a steady rate. The quotation at the beginning of this chapter from 
Milton Friedman—the most famous monetarist—exemplifies this view of mone­
tary policy. Monetarists believe that fluctuations in the money supply are responsible 
for most large fluctuations in the economy. They argue that slow and steady growth 
in the money supply would yield stable output, employment, and prices.
Alexander Hamilton Versus Time Inconsistency
Time inconsistency has long been a problem associated with discretionary policy. 
In fact, it was one of the first problems that confronted Alexander Hamilton 
when President George Washington appointed him the first U.S. Secretary of 
the Treasury in 1789.
Hamilton faced the question of how to deal with the debts that the new 
nation had accumulated as it fought for its independence from Britain. When the 
revolutionary government incurred the debts, it promised to honor them when 
the war was over. But after the war, many Americans advocated defaulting on 
the debt because repaying the creditors would require taxation, which is always 
costly and unpopular.
Hamilton opposed the time-inconsistent policy of repudiating the debt. He knew 
that the nation would likely need to borrow again sometime in the future. In his 
First Report on the Public Credit, which he presented to Congress in 1790, he wrote:
If the maintenance of public credit, then, be truly so important, the next inquiry 
which suggests itself is: By what means is it to be effected? The ready answer to 
which question is, by good faith; by a punctual performance of contracts. States, 
like individuals, who observe their engagements are respected and trusted, while 
the reverse is the fate of those who pursue an opposite conduct.
Thus, Hamilton proposed that the nation make a commitment to the policy rule 
of honoring its debts.
The policy rule that Hamilton originally proposed has continued for more 
than two centuries. Today, unlike in Hamilton’s time, when Congress debates 
spending priorities, no one seriously proposes defaulting on the public debt as 
a way to reduce taxes. In the case of public debt, Americans now agree that the 
government should be committed to a fixed policy rule.
The same cannot be said of all other nations, however. In recent years, several 
European countries have run into fiscal problems, and default on their govern­
ment debt seemed a possible outcome. A Case Study in Chapter 20 discusses this 
issue in more detail. n

Inflation Targeting: Rule or Constrained Discretion?
Beginning in the late 1980s, many of the world’s central banks—including those 
of Australia, Canada, Finland, Israel, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United 
Kingdom—started to adopt some form of inflation targeting. Sometimes infla­
tion targeting takes the form of a central bank announcing its policy intentions. 
At other times it takes the form of a national law that spells out the goals of 
monetary policy. For example, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act of 1989 
told the central bank “to formulate and implement monetary policy directed to 
the economic objective of achieving and maintaining stability in the general level 
of prices.” The act conspicuously omitted any mention of any other competing 
objective, such as stability in output, employment, interest rates, or exchange rates.
A monetarist policy rule might have prevented many of the economic fluc­
tuations we have experienced historically, but most economists believe that it is 
not the best possible policy rule. Steady growth in the money supply stabilizes 
aggregate demand only if the velocity of money is stable. But sometimes the 
economy experiences shocks, such as shifts in money demand, that cause veloc­
ity to be unstable. Most economists believe that a policy rule needs to allow the 
money supply to adjust to various shocks to the economy.
A second policy rule that economists widely advocate is nominal GDP tar­
geting. Under this rule, the Fed announces a planned path for nominal GDP. 
If nominal GDP rises above the target, the Fed reduces money growth to 
dampen aggregate demand. If it falls below the target, the Fed raises money 
growth to stimulate aggregate demand. Because a nominal GDP target allows 
monetary policy to adjust to changes in the velocity of money, most economists 
believe it would lead to greater stability in output and prices than a monetarist 
policy rule.
A third policy rule that is often advocated is inflation targeting. Under this 
rule, the Fed would announce a target for the inflation rate (usually a low one) 
and then adjust the money supply when the actual inflation rate deviates from 
the target. Like nominal GDP targeting, inflation targeting insulates the economy 
from changes in the velocity of money. In addition, an inflation target has the 
political advantage of being easy to explain to the public.
Notice that all these rules are expressed in terms of some nominal variable—
the money supply, nominal GDP, or the price level. One can also imagine policy 
rules expressed in terms of real variables. For example, the Fed might try to target 
the unemployment rate at 5 percent. The problem with such a rule is that no 
one knows exactly what the natural rate of unemployment is. If the Fed chose 
a target for the unemployment rate below the natural rate, the result would be 
accelerating inflation. Conversely, if the Fed chose a target for the unemployment 
rate above the natural rate, the result would be accelerating deflation. For this 
reason, economists rarely advocate rules for monetary policy expressed solely in 
terms of real variables, even though real variables such as unemployment and real 
GDP are the best measures of economic performance.

Central-Bank Independence
Suppose you were put in charge of writing the constitution and laws for a 
country. Would you give the president of the country authority over the policies 
of the central bank? Or would you allow the central bank to make decisions free 
Should we interpret inflation targeting as a type of precommitment to a policy 
rule? Not completely. In all the countries that have adopted inflation targeting, 
central banks are left with a fair amount of discretion. Inflation targets are usually 
set as a range—an inflation rate of 1 to 3 percent, for instance—rather than a 
particular number. Thus, the central bank can choose where in the range it wants 
to be: it can stimulate the economy and be near the top of the range or dampen 
the economy and be near the bottom. In addition, the central bank is sometimes 
allowed to adjust its target for inflation, at least temporarily, if some exogenous 
event (such as an easily identified supply shock) pushes inflation outside of the 
range that was previously announced.
In light of this flexibility, what is the purpose of inflation targeting? Although 
inflation targeting leaves the central bank with some discretion, the policy does 
constrain how this discretion is used. When a central bank is told simply to “do 
the right thing,” it is hard to hold the central bank accountable because people 
can argue forever about what the right thing is in any specific circumstance. 
By contrast, when a central bank has announced a specific inflation target, or 
even a target range, the public can more easily judge whether the central bank is 
meeting its objectives. Thus, although inflation targeting does not tie the hands 
of the central bank, it does increase the transparency of monetary policy and, by 
doing so, makes central bankers more accountable for their actions.6
The Federal Reserve was slow to adopt a policy of inflation targeting, but in 
2012 it set for itself an inflation target of 2 percent. On its Web site, the Fed offers 
the following explanation:
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judges that inflation at the rate 
of 2 percent (as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal 
consumption expenditures, or PCE) is most consistent over the longer run with 
the Federal Reserve’s mandate for price stability and maximum employment. Over 
time, a higher inflation rate would reduce the public’s ability to make accurate 
longer-term economic and financial decisions. On the other hand, a lower infla­
tion rate would be associated with an elevated probability of falling into deflation, 
which means prices and perhaps wages, on average, are falling—a phenomenon 
associated with very weak economic conditions. Having at least a small level of 
inflation makes it less likely that the economy will experience harmful deflation 
if economic conditions weaken. The FOMC implements monetary policy to help 
maintain an inflation rate of 2 percent over the medium term. n

from such political influence? In other words, assuming that monetary policy 
is made by discretion rather than by rule, who should exercise that discretion?
Countries vary greatly in how they choose to answer this question. In some 
countries, the central bank is a branch of the government; in others, the central 
bank is largely independent. In the United States, Fed governors are appointed 
by the president for 14-year terms, and they cannot be recalled if the president is 
unhappy with their decisions. This institutional structure gives the Fed a degree 
of independence similar to that of the U.S. Supreme Court.
Many researchers have investigated the effects of constitutional design on 
monetary policy. They have examined the laws of different countries to con­
struct an index of central-bank independence. This index is based on various 
characteristics, such as the length of bankers’ terms, the role of government offi­
cials on the bank board, and the frequency of contact between the government 
and the central bank. The researchers then examined the correlation between 
central-bank independence and macroeconomic performance.
The results of these studies are striking: more independent central banks are 
strongly associated with lower and more stable inflation. Figure 18-3 shows a 
scatterplot of central-bank independence and average inflation for the period 
1955 to 1988. Countries that had an independent central bank, such as Germany, 
Switzerland, and the United States, tended to have low average inflation. Countries 
that had central banks with less independence, such as New Zealand and Spain, 
tended to have higher average inflation.

Researchers have also found that there is no relationship between central-
bank independence and real economic activity. In particular, central-bank 
independence is not correlated with average unemployment, the volatility of 
unemployment, the average growth of real GDP, or the volatility of real GDP. 
Central-bank independence appears to offer countries a free lunch: it has the 
benefit of lower inflation without any apparent cost. This finding has led some 
countries, such as New Zealand, to rewrite their laws to give their central banks 
greater independence.7 n
18-3 Conclusion: Making Policy in an 
Uncertain World
In this chapter we have examined whether policy should take an active or passive 
role in responding to economic fluctuations and whether policy should be con­
ducted by rule or by discretion. There are many arguments on both sides of these 
questions. Perhaps the only clear conclusion is that there is no simple and compel­
ling case for any particular view of macroeconomic policy. In the end, you must 
weigh the various arguments, both economic and political, and decide for yourself 
what kind of role the government should play in trying to stabilize the economy.
For better or worse, economists play a key role in the formulation of eco­
nomic policy. Because the economy is complex, this role is often difficult. Yet it 
is also inevitable. Economists cannot sit back and wait until our knowledge of 
the economy has been perfected before giving advice. In the meantime, someone 
must advise economic policymakers. That job, difficult as it sometimes is, falls to 
economists.
The role of economists in the policymaking process goes beyond giving 
advice to policymakers. Even economists cloistered in academia influence policy 
indirectly through their research and writing. In the conclusion of The General 
Theory, John Maynard Keynes wrote:
[T]he ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right 
and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. 
Indeed, the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves 
to be quite exempt from intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some 
defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distill­
ing their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.
This is as true today as it was when Keynes wrote it in 1936—except now that 
academic scribbler is often Keynes himself.

central-bank independence, see Alberto Alesina and Lawrence H. Summers, “Central Bank Inde­

Summary
	1.	Advocates of active policy view the economy as subject to frequent shocks 
that will lead to unnecessary fluctuations in output and employment unless 
monetary or fiscal policy responds. Many believe that economic policy has 
been successful in stabilizing the economy.
	2.	Advocates of passive policy argue that because monetary and fiscal policies 
work with long and variable lags, attempts to stabilize the economy are 
likely to end up being destabilizing. In addition, they believe that our pres­
ent understanding of the economy is too limited to be useful in formulat­
ing successful stabilization policy and that inept policy is a frequent source 
of economic fluctuations.
	3.	Advocates of discretionary policy argue that discretion gives more flexibility 
to policymakers in responding to various unforeseen situations.
	4.	Advocates of policy rules argue that the political process cannot be trusted. 
They believe that politicians make frequent mistakes in conducting eco­
nomic policy and sometimes use economic policy for their own political 
ends. In addition, advocates of policy rules argue that a commitment to a 
fixed policy rule is necessary to solve the problem of time inconsistency.

The social cost of unemployment and inflation 
is described by the following loss function:
L 5 u 1 0.05 p 2.
	
	The central bank would like this loss to be as 
small as possible.
	a.	If the central bank commits to targeting 
5 percent inflation, what is expected inflation? 
If the central bank follows through, what 
is the unemployment rate? What is the loss 
from inflation and unemployment?
	b.	If the central bank commits to targeting zero 
inflation, what is expected inflation? If the 
central bank follows through, what is the 
unemployment rate? What is the loss from 
inflation and unemployment?
	c.	Based on your answers to parts (a) and (b), 
which inflation target would you recom­
mend? Why?
	d.	Suppose the central bank chooses to target 
zero inflation, and expected inflation is zero. 
Suddenly, however, the central bank surprises 
people with 5 percent inflation. What is 
unemployment in this period of unexpected 
inflation? What is the loss from inflation and 
unemployment?
	e.	What problem does your answer to part (d) 
illustrate?
	4.	After every policy meeting, the Federal Reserve 
issues a statement (sometimes called the press 
release), which you can find on the Fed’s Web site 
(http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/
fomccalendars.htm). Read the most recent state­
ment. What does it say? What is the Fed doing? 
Why? What do you think about the Fed’s recent 
policy decisions?
	1.	Suppose that the tradeoff between unemployment 
and inflation is determined by the Phillips curve:
u 5 un 2 a(p 2 E p),
where u denotes the unemployment rate, un the 
natural rate, p the rate of inflation, and Ep the 
expected rate of inflation. In addition, suppose 
that the Left Party always follows a policy of 
high money growth and the Right Party always 
follows a policy of low money growth. What 
“political business cycle” pattern of inflation and 
unemployment would you predict under the 
following conditions?
	a.	Every four years, one of the parties takes control 
based on a random flip of a coin. (Hint: What 
will expected inflation be prior to the election?)
	b.	The two parties take turns.
	c.	Do your answers above support the conclu­
sion that monetary policy should be set by 
an independent central bank?
	2.	When cities pass laws limiting the rent landlords 
can charge on apartments, the laws usually apply 
to existing buildings and exempt any buildings 
not yet built. Advocates of rent control argue 
that this exemption ensures that rent control 
does not discourage the construction of new 
housing. Evaluate this argument in light of the 
time-inconsistency problem.
	3.	A central bank has decided to adopt inflation 
targeting and is now debating whether to target 
5 percent inflation or zero inflation. The econo­
my is described by the following Phillips curve:
u 5 5 2 0.5 ( p 2 E p),
where u and p are the unemployment rate and 
inflation rate measured in percentage points.

In this appendix, we examine more formally the time-inconsistency argument 
for rules rather than discretion. This analysis is relegated to an appendix because 
it requires some calculus.8
Suppose that the Phillips curve describes the relationship between inflation 
and unemployment. Letting u denote the unemployment rate, un the natural rate 
of unemployment, p the rate of inflation, and Ep the expected rate of inflation, 
unemployment is determined by
u 5 un 2a(p 2 E p ).
Unemployment is low when inflation exceeds expected inflation and high when 
inflation falls below expected inflation. The parameter a determines how much 
unemployment responds to surprise inflation.
For simplicity, suppose also that the Fed chooses the rate of inflation. In real­
ity, the Fed controls inflation only imperfectly through its control of the money 
supply. But for purposes of illustration, it is useful to assume that the Fed can 
control inflation perfectly.
The Fed likes low unemployment and low inflation. Suppose that the cost 
of unemployment and inflation, as perceived by the Fed, can be represented as
L(u, p) 5 u 1 g p 2,
where the parameter g represents how much the Fed dislikes inflation relative to 
unemployment. L(u, p) is called the loss function. The Fed’s objective is to make 
the loss as small as possible.
Having specified how the economy works and the Fed’s objective, let’s com­
pare monetary policy made under a fixed rule and under discretion.
We begin by considering policy under a fixed rule. A rule commits the Fed 
to a particular level of inflation. As long as private agents understand that the 
Fed is committed to this rule, the expected level of inflation will be the level the 
Fed is committed to produce. Because expected inflation equals actual inflation 
(Ep 5 p), unemployment will be at its natural rate (u 5 un).

Prescott won the Nobel Prize for this and other work in 2004.

What is the optimal rule? Because unemployment is at its natural rate regard­
less of the level of inflation legislated by the rule, there is no benefit to having any 
inflation at all. Therefore, the optimal fixed rule requires that the Fed produce 
zero inflation.
Now let’s consider discretionary monetary policy. Under discretion, the econ­
omy works as follows:
1.	Private agents form their expectations of inflation E p.
2.	The Fed chooses the actual level of inflation p.
3.	Based on expected and actual inflation, unemployment is determined.
Under this arrangement, the Fed minimizes its loss L(u, p) subject to the con­
straint that the Phillips curve imposes. When making its decision about the rate 
of inflation, the Fed takes expected inflation as already determined.
To find what outcome we would obtain under discretionary policy, we must 
examine what level of inflation the Fed would choose. By substituting the 
­Phillips curve into the Fed’s loss function, we obtain
L(u, p ) 5 un 2 a(p 2 Ep) 1 g p 2.
Notice that the Fed’s loss is negatively related to unexpected inflation (the sec­
ond term in the equation) and positively related to actual inflation (the third 
term). To find the level of inflation that minimizes this loss, differentiate with 
respect to p to obtain
dL/d p 5 2a 1 2gp.
The loss is minimized when this derivative equals zero.9 Solving for p, we get
p 5 a/(2g ).
Whatever level of inflation private agents expected, this is the “optimal” level 
of inflation for the Fed to choose. Of course, rational private agents understand 
the objective of the Fed and the constraint that the Phillips curve imposes. They 
therefore expect that the Fed will choose this level of inflation. Expected infla­
tion equals actual inflation [Ep 5 p 5 a/(2g )], and unemployment equals its 
natural rate (u 5 un).
Now compare the outcome under optimal discretion to the outcome under 
the optimal rule. In both cases, unemployment is at its natural rate. Yet discretion­
ary policy produces more inflation than does policy under the rule. Thus, optimal 
discretion is worse than the optimal rule. This is true even though the Fed under 
discretion was attempting to minimize its loss, L(u, p ).
At first it may seem strange that the Fed can achieve a better outcome by 
being committed to a fixed rule. Why can’t the Fed with discretion mimic the 
Fed committed to a zero-inflation rule? The answer is that the Fed is playing a 
9Mathematical note: The second derivative, d  2L/dp 2 5 2g, is positive, ensuring that we are solving 
for a minimum of the loss function rather than a maximum!

C H A P T E R  1 8   Alternative Perspectives on Stabilization Policy  | 553
game against private decisionmakers who have rational expectations. Unless it is 
committed to a fixed rule of zero inflation, the Fed cannot get private agents to 
expect zero inflation.
Suppose, for example, that the Fed simply announces that it will follow a 
zero-inflation policy. Such an announcement by itself cannot be credible. After 
private agents have formed their expectations of inflation, the Fed has the 
incentive to renege on its announcement in order to decrease unemployment. 
[As we have just seen, once expectations are determined, the Fed’s optimal 
policy is to set inflation at p 5 a/(2g), regardless of Ep.] Private agents under­
stand the incentive to renege and therefore do not believe the announcement 
in the first place.
This theory of monetary policy has an important corollary. Under one cir­
cumstance, the Fed with discretion achieves the same outcome as the Fed com­
mitted to a fixed rule of zero inflation. If the Fed dislikes inflation much more 
than it dislikes unemployment (so that g is very large), inflation under discretion 
is near zero, because the Fed has little incentive to inflate. This finding pro­
vides some guidance to those who have the job of appointing central bankers. 
An alternative to imposing a fixed rule is to appoint an individual with a fervent 
distaste for inflation. Perhaps this is why even liberal politicians (Jimmy Carter, 
Bill Clinton) who are more concerned about unemployment than inflation 
sometimes appoint conservative central bankers (Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan) 
who are more concerned about inflation.10

	1.	In the 1970s in the United States, the inflation 
rate and the natural rate of unemployment both 
rose. Let’s use this model of time inconsistency 
to examine this phenomenon. Assume that 
­policy is discretionary.
	a.	In the model as developed so far, what hap­
pens to the inflation rate when the natural 
rate of unemployment rises?
	b.	Let’s now change the model slightly by sup­
posing that the Fed’s loss function is quadratic 
in both inflation and unemployment. That is,
L(u, p) 5 u 2 1 gp 2.
Follow steps similar to those in the text 
to solve for the inflation rate under discre­
tionary policy.
	c.	Now what happens to the inflation rate 
when the natural rate of unemployment 
rises?
	d.	In 1979, President Jimmy Carter appointed 
the central banker Paul Volcker to head the 
Federal Reserve. Volcker had a strong distaste 
for inflation. According to this model, what 
should have happened to inflation and unem­
ployment? Compare the model’s prediction to 
what actually happened.

mediate Target,” Quarterly Journal of Economics 100 (1985): 1169–1190.

hen a government spends more than it collects in taxes, it has a 
budget deficit, which it finances by borrowing from the private 
sector or from foreign governments. The accumulation of past 
borrowing is the government debt.
Debate about the appropriate amount of government debt in the United 
States is as old as the country itself. Alexander Hamilton believed that “a national 
debt, if it is not excessive, will be to us a national blessing,” while James Madison 
argued that “a public debt is a public curse.” Indeed, the location of the nation’s 
capital was chosen as part of a deal in which the federal government assumed 
the Revolutionary War debts of the states: because the northern states had larger 
outstanding debts, the capital was located in the South.
The debate over government debt has been particularly fervent in recent years. 
In the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008–2009, the U.S. government ran very 
large budget deficits. These deficits were in part due to automatic stabilizers: tax 
revenue falls and government spending on programs like unemployment insur­
ance rises when the economy goes into recession. In addition, various discretion­
ary changes in fiscal policy aimed at stimulating the economy further increased 
the deficit. In 2009, the deficit was 9.8 percent of GDP, the largest budget shortfall 
since World War II. As the economy improved, the deficit shrank to 3.7 percent 
of GDP in 2014. But many analysts feared that the deficit would rise in the years 
ahead, because the large baby boom generation would soon retire and become 
eligible for various government benefits such as Social Security and Medicare.

This chapter considers various aspects of the debate over the economic 
effects of government debt. We begin by looking at the numbers. Section 19-1 
examines the size of the U.S. government debt, comparing it to the historical 
and international record. It also takes a brief look at what the future may hold. 
Section 19-2 discusses why measuring changes in government indebtedness is 
not as straightforward as it might seem.
We then look at how government debt affects the economy. Section 19-3 
describes the traditional view of government debt, according to which govern­
ment borrowing reduces national saving and crowds out capital accumulation. 
This view is held by most economists and has been implicit in the discussion 
of fiscal policy throughout this book. Section 19-4 discusses an alternative view, 
called Ricardian equivalence, which is held by a small but influential minority of 
economists. According to the Ricardian view, government debt does not influ­
ence national saving and capital accumulation. As we will see, the debate between 
the traditional and Ricardian views of government debt arises from disagree­
ments over how consumers respond to the government’s debt policy.
Section 19-5 then looks at other facets of the debate over government debt. 
It begins by discussing whether the government should always try to balance its 
budget and, if not, when a budget deficit or surplus is desirable. It also examines 
the effects of government debt on monetary policy, the political process, and a 
nation’s role in the world economy.
Although this chapter provides the foundation for understanding the effects of 
government debt and budget deficits, the story will not be completed until the 
next chapter. There we will examine the financial system more broadly, including 
the causes of financial crises. As we will see, excessive government debt can be 
at the center of such crises—a lesson that several European nations have recently 
been learning, all too painfully.
19-1
The Size of the Government Debt
Let’s begin by putting the government debt in perspective. In 2014, the debt 
of the U.S. federal government was $12.9 trillion. If we divide this number by 
316 million, the number of people in the United States, we find that each per­
son’s share of the government debt was about $41,000. Obviously, this is not a 
trivial number; few people sneeze at $41,000. Yet if we compare this debt to the 
roughly $2 million a typical person will earn over his working life, the govern­
ment debt does not look like the catastrophe it is sometimes made out to be.
One way to judge the size of a government’s debt is to compare it to the 
amount of debt other countries have accumulated. Table 19-1 shows the amount 
of government debt for several major countries expressed as a percentage of each 
country’s GDP. The figure here is net debt: the government’s financial obligations 
less any financial assets that it holds. At the top of the list are the heavily indebted 
countries of Japan, Greece, and Italy, which have accumulated a debt that 
exceeds annual GDP. At the bottom are Switzerland and Australia, which have 

C H A P T E R  1 9   Government Debt and Budget Deficits  | 557
accumulated relatively small debts. The United States is more indebted than 
average, but it is not far from the middle of the pack. By international standards, 
the U.S. government is neither especially profligate nor especially frugal.
Over the course of U.S. history, the indebtedness of the federal government 
has varied substantially. Figure 19-1 shows the ratio of the federal debt to GDP 
since 1791. The government debt, relative to the size of the economy, varies from 
close to zero in the 1830s to a maximum of 106 percent of GDP in 1946.
Historically, the primary cause of increases in the government debt is war. 
The debt–GDP ratio rises sharply during major wars and falls slowly during 
peacetime. Many economists think that this historical pattern is the appropri­
ate way to run fiscal policy. As we will discuss more fully later in this chapter, 
deficit financing of wars appears optimal for reasons of both tax smoothing and 
generational equity.
One instance of a large increase in government debt in peacetime began in 
the early 1980s. When Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, he was 
committed to reducing taxes and increasing military spending. These policies, 
coupled with a deep recession attributable to tight monetary policy, began a 
long period of substantial budget deficits. The government debt expressed as a 
percentage of GDP roughly doubled from 25 percent in 1980 to 47 percent in 
1995. The United States had never before experienced such a large increase in 
government debt during a period of peace and prosperity. Many economists have 
criticized this increase in government debt as imposing an unjustifiable burden 
on future generations.

The increase in government debt during the 1980s caused significant concern 
among many policymakers as well. In 1990, President George H. W. Bush raised 
taxes to reduce the deficit, breaking his “Read my lips: No new taxes” campaign 
pledge and, according to some political commentators, costing him reelection. 
In 1993, when President Bill Clinton took office, he raised taxes yet again. These 
tax increases, together with spending restraint and rapid economic growth due 
to the information-technology boom, caused the budget deficits to shrink and 
eventually turn into budget surpluses. The government debt fell from 47 percent 
of GDP in 1995 to 31 percent in 2001.
When President George W. Bush took office in 2001, the high-tech boom in 
the stock market was reversing course, and the economy was heading into recession. 
Economic downturns automatically cause tax revenue to fall and push the budget 
toward deficit. In addition, tax cuts to combat the recession and increased spend­
ing for homeland security and wars in Afghanistan and Iraq further increased the 
budget deficit, which averaged about 2 percent of GDP during his tenure. From 
2001 to 2008, government debt rose from 31 to 39 percent of GDP.
FIGURE  19-1
The Ratio of Government Debt to GDP Since 1791  The U.S. federal government 
debt held by the public, relative to the size of the U.S. economy, rises sharply during 
wars, when the government finances wartime spending by borrowing. It also increases 
during major economic downturns, such as the Great Depression of the 1930s and 
the Great Recession following the financial crisis of 2008–2009. The debt–GDP ratio 
usually declines gradually during periods of peace and prosperity.

C H A P T E R  1 9   Government Debt and Budget Deficits  | 559
When President Barack Obama moved into the White House in 2009, the 
economy was in the midst of a deep recession following a financial crisis. Tax 
revenues were declining as the economy shrank. In addition, one of the new 
president’s first actions was to sign a large fiscal stimulus to prop up the aggre­
gate demand for goods and services. (A Case Study in Chapter 11 examines this 
policy.) The federal government’s budget deficit was 10 percent of GDP in 2009, 
9 percent in 2010, and 8 percent in 2011. The debt–GDP ratio rose to 74 percent 
of GDP by 2014.
These trends led to a significant event in August 2011: Standard & Poor’s, a 
major private agency that evaluates the safety of bonds, reduced its credit rating 
on U.S. government debt to one notch below the top AAA grade. For many 
years, U.S. government debt was considered the safest around. That is, buyers 
of these bonds could be completely confident that they would be repaid in full 
when the bond matured. Standard & Poor’s, however, was sufficiently concerned 
about recent fiscal policy that it raised the possibility that the U.S. government 
might someday default.
The Troubling Long-Term Outlook for Fiscal Policy
Why did Standard & Poor’s downgrade U.S. government debt? The large budget 
deficits from 2009 to 2011 were one reason but probably not the main one. 
More important was the longer-term outlook for fiscal policy. When economists 
project the path of U.S. fiscal policy over the next several decades, they paint a 
troubling picture.
One reason is demographic. Advances in medical technology have been 
increasing life expectancy, while improvements in birth-control techniques and 
changing social norms have reduced the number of children people have. Because 
of these developments, the elderly are becoming a larger share of the population. 
In 1950, the elderly population (aged 65 and older) was about 14 percent the 
size of the working-age population (aged 20 to 64). Now the elderly are about 
21 percent of the working-age population, and that figure will rise to about 
40 percent by 2050. About one-third of the federal budget is devoted to provid­
ing the elderly with pensions (mainly through the Social Security program) and 
health care. As more people become eligible for these “entitlements,” as they are 
sometimes called, government spending will automatically rise over time.
A second, related reason for the troubling fiscal picture is the rising cost of 
health care. The government provides health care to the elderly through the 
Medicare system and to the poor through Medicaid. As the cost of health care 
increases, government spending on these programs increases as well. ­Policymakers 
have proposed various ways to stem the rise in health care costs, such as reduc­
ing the burden of lawsuits, encouraging more competition among health care 
providers, and promoting greater use of information technology. The health 
care reform act signed into law by President Obama in 2009 established a new 
­government agency, called the Independent Payment Advisory Board, to pro­
mulgate changes in Medicare to reduce costs. Yet many health economists believe

Problems in Measurement
The government budget deficit equals government spending minus government 
revenue, which in turn equals the amount of new debt the government needs to 
issue to finance its operations. This definition may sound simple enough, but in 
fact debates over fiscal policy sometimes arise over how the budget deficit should 
be measured. Some economists believe that the deficit as currently measured is not 
a good indicator of the stance of fiscal policy. That is, they believe that the bud­
get deficit does not accurately gauge either the impact of fiscal policy on today’s 
economy or the burden being placed on future generations of taxpayers. In this 
section we discuss four problems with the usual measure of the budget deficit.
such measures will have only limited impact. A main reason for rising health care 
costs is medical advances that provide new, better, but often expensive ways to 
extend and improve our lives.
The combination of the aging population and rising health care costs will 
have a major impact on the federal budget. Government spending on Social 
Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other government health care programs has 
already risen from less than 1 percent of GDP in 1950 to about 10 percent today. 
The upward trajectory is not about to stop. The Congressional Budget Office 
estimates that if no changes are made, spending on these programs will rise to 
17.5 percent of GDP by 2065 (when today’s college students will have retired).
How the United States will handle these spending pressures is an open question. 
The key issue is how the required fiscal adjustment will be split between tax 
increases and spending reductions. Some economists believe that to pay for these 
commitments, we will need to raise taxes as a percentage of GDP substantially 
above what it has been historically. Given the projected increases in spending on 
Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, paying for these benefits would require 
increasing all taxes by more than one-third. Other economists believe that such 
high tax rates would impose too great a cost on younger workers. They believe that 
policymakers should reduce the promises now being made to the elderly of the 
future and that, at the same time, people should be encouraged to take a greater role 
in providing for themselves as they age. This might entail raising the normal retire­
ment age, while giving people more incentive to save during their working years as 
preparation for assuming more of their own retirement and health care costs.
Resolving this debate will be one of the great policy challenges in the decades 
ahead. Neither substantial tax hikes nor substantial spending cuts are politically 
popular, which is why the problem has not been addressed already. Yet the only 
alternative is a continuation of large budget deficits and increasing government 
debt. At some point, as government debt rises as a share of GDP, the govern­
ment’s ability or willingness to service and repay these debts would be called 
into question. And that is the main reason that Standard & Poor’s, looking 
ahead to these formidable challenges, downgraded the credit rating of the U.S. 
government. They did not say that default was a likely outcome, but they did 
suggest that it was a possibility. n

C H A P T E R  1 9   Government Debt and Budget Deficits  | 561
Measurement Problem 1: Inflation
The least controversial of the measurement issues is the correction for inflation. 
Almost all economists agree that the government’s indebtedness should be mea­
sured in real terms, not in nominal terms. The measured deficit should equal the 
change in the government’s real debt, not the change in its nominal debt.
The budget deficit as commonly measured, however, does not correct for 
inflation. To see how large an error this induces, consider the following example. 
Suppose that the real government debt is not changing; in other words, in real 
terms, the budget is balanced. In this case, the nominal debt must be rising at the 
rate of inflation. That is,
DD/D 5 p,
where p is the inflation rate and D is the stock of government debt. This implies
DD 5 pD.
The government would look at the change in the nominal debt DD and would 
report a budget deficit of pD. Hence, most economists believe that the reported 
budget deficit is overstated by the amount pD.
We can make the same argument in another way. The deficit is government 
expenditure minus government revenue. Part of expenditure is the interest paid 
on the government debt. Expenditure should include only the real interest paid 
on the debt rD, not the nominal interest paid iD. Because the difference between 
the nominal interest rate i and the real interest rate r is the inflation rate p, the 
budget deficit is overstated by pD.
This correction for inflation can be large, especially when inflation is high, 
and it can often change our evaluation of fiscal policy. For example, in 1979, 
the federal government reported a budget deficit of $28 billion. Inflation was 
8.6 percent, and the government debt held at the beginning of the year by 
the public (­excluding the Federal Reserve) was $495 billion. The deficit was 
therefore overstated by
pD 5 0.086 3 $495 billion
	
5 $43 billion.
Corrected for inflation, the reported budget deficit of $28 billion turns into a 
budget surplus of $15 billion! In other words, even though nominal government 
debt was rising, real government debt was falling. This correction has been less 
important in recent years, because inflation has been low.
Measurement Problem 2: Capital Assets
Many economists believe that an accurate assessment of the government’s budget 
deficit requires taking into account the government’s assets as well as its liabilities. 
In particular, when measuring the government’s overall indebtedness, we should 
subtract government assets from government debt. Therefore, the budget deficit 
should be measured as the change in debt minus the change in assets.

562 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
Certainly, individuals and firms treat assets and liabilities symmetrically. When 
a person borrows to buy a house, we do not say that she is running a budget 
deficit. Instead, we offset the increase in assets (the house) against the increase in 
debt (the mortgage) and record no change in net wealth. Perhaps we should treat 
the government’s finances the same way.
A budget procedure that accounts for assets as well as liabilities is called 
capital budgeting because it takes into account changes in capital. For example, 
suppose that the government sells one of its office buildings or some of its land 
and uses the proceeds to reduce the government debt. Under current budget 
procedures, the reported deficit would be lower. Under capital budgeting, the 
revenue received from the sale would not lower the deficit because the reduction 
in debt would be offset by a reduction in assets. Similarly, under capital budget­
ing, government borrowing to finance the purchase of a capital good would not 
raise the deficit.
The major difficulty with capital budgeting is that it is hard to decide which 
government expenditures should count as capital expenditures. For example, 
should the interstate highway system be counted as an asset of the government? 
If so, what is its value? What about the stockpile of nuclear weapons? Should 
spending on education be treated as expenditure on human capital? These dif­
ficult questions must be answered if the government is to adopt a capital budget.
Reasonable people disagree about whether the federal government should use 
capital budgeting. (Many state governments already use it.) Opponents of capital 
budgeting argue that, although the system is superior in principle to the current 
system, it is too difficult to implement in practice. Proponents of capital budget­
ing argue that even an imperfect treatment of capital assets would be better than 
ignoring them altogether.
Measurement Problem 3: Uncounted Liabilities
Some economists argue that the measured budget deficit is misleading because 
it excludes some important government liabilities. For example, consider the 
pensions of government workers. These workers provide labor services to the 
government today, but part of their compensation is deferred to the future. 
In essence, these workers are providing a loan to the government. Their future 
pension benefits are a government liability not very different from govern­
ment debt. Yet this liability is not included as part of the government debt, and 
the accumulation of this liability is not included as part of the budget deficit. 
According to some estimates, this implicit liability is almost as large as the official 
government debt.
Similarly, consider the Social Security system. In some ways, the system is 
like a pension plan. People pay some of their income into the system when 
young and expect to receive benefits when old. Perhaps accumulated future 
Social Security benefits should be included in the government’s liabilities. 
Estimates suggest that the government’s future Social Security liabilities (less 
future Social Security taxes) are more than three times the government debt as 
officially ­measured.

C H A P T E R  1 9   Government Debt and Budget Deficits  | 563
One might argue that Social Security liabilities are different from government 
debt because the government can change the laws determining Social Security 
benefits. Yet, in principle, the government could always choose not to repay all 
of its debt: the government honors its debt only because it chooses to do so. 
Promises to pay the holders of government debt may not be fundamentally dif­
ferent from promises to pay the future recipients of Social Security.
A particularly difficult form of government liability to measure is the contingent 
liability—the liability that is due only if a specified event occurs. For example, 
the government guarantees many forms of private credit, such as student loans, 
mortgages for low- and moderate-income families, and deposits in banks and 
savings-and-loan institutions. If the borrower repays the loan, the government 
pays nothing; if the borrower defaults, the government makes the repayment. 
When the government provides this guarantee, it undertakes a liability contin­
gent on the borrower’s default. Yet this contingent liability is not reflected in the 
budget deficit, in part because it is not clear what dollar value to attach to it.
Measurement Problem 4: The Business Cycle
Many changes in the government’s budget deficit occur automatically in response 
to a fluctuating economy. When the economy goes into a recession, incomes 
fall, so people pay less in personal income taxes. Profits fall, so corporations 
pay less in corporate income taxes. Fewer people are employed, so payroll tax 
revenue declines. More people become eligible for government assistance, such 
as welfare and unemployment insurance, so government spending rises. Even 
without any change in the laws governing taxation and spending, the budget 
deficit increases.
These automatic changes in the deficit are not errors in measurement because 
the government truly borrows more when a recession depresses tax revenue and 
boosts government spending. But these changes do make it more difficult to 
use the deficit to monitor changes in fiscal policy. That is, the deficit can rise or 
fall either because the government has changed policy or because the economy 
has changed direction. For some purposes, it would be good to know which is 
occurring.
To solve this problem, the government calculates a cyclically adjusted budget 
deficit (sometimes called the full-employment budget deficit). The cyclically adjusted 
deficit is based on estimates of what government spending and tax revenue 
would be if the economy were operating at its natural level of output and 
employment. The cyclically adjusted deficit is a useful measure because it reflects 
policy changes but not the current stage of the business cycle.
Summing Up
Economists differ in the importance they place on these measurement problems. 
Some believe that the problems are so severe that the budget deficit as normally 
measured is almost meaningless. Most take these measurement problems seriously 
but still view the measured budget deficit as a useful indicator of fiscal policy.

564 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
The undisputed lesson is that to fully evaluate what fiscal policy is doing, 
economists and policymakers must look at more than just the measured bud­
get deficit. And, in fact, they do. The budget documents prepared annually by 
the Office of Management and Budget contain much detailed information 
about the government’s finances, including data on capital expenditures and 
credit programs.
No economic statistic is perfect. Whenever we see a number reported in the 
media, we need to know what it is measuring and what it is leaving out. This is 
especially true for data on government debt and budget deficits.

The Traditional View of 
Government Debt
Imagine that you are an economist working for the Congressional Budget Office 
(CBO). You receive a letter from the chair of the Senate Budget Committee:
Dear CBO Economist:
Congress is about to consider the president’s request to cut all taxes by 
20 percent. Before deciding whether to endorse the request, my committee 
would like your analysis. We see little hope of reducing government spending, 
so the tax cut would mean an increase in the budget deficit. How would the 
tax cut and budget deficit affect the economy and the economic well-being of 
the country?
	
Sincerely,

Committee Chair
Before responding to the senator, you open your favorite economics textbook—
this one, of course—to see what the models predict for such a change in fiscal 
policy.
To analyze the long-run effects of this policy change, you turn to the models 
in Chapters 3 through 9. The model in Chapter 3 shows that a tax cut stimu­
lates consumer spending and reduces national saving. The reduction in saving 
raises the interest rate, which crowds out investment. The Solow growth model 
introduced in Chapter 8 shows that lower investment eventually leads to a lower 
steady-state capital stock and a lower level of output. Because we concluded in 
Chapter 9 that the U.S. economy has less capital than in the Golden Rule steady 
state (the steady state with maximum consumption), the fall in steady-state capi­
tal means lower consumption and reduced economic well-being.
To analyze the short-run effects of the policy change, you turn to the IS–LM 
model in Chapters 11 and 12. This model shows that a tax cut stimulates con­
sumer spending, which implies an expansionary shift in the IS curve. If there is 
no change in monetary policy, the shift in the IS curve leads to an expansionary 
shift in the aggregate demand curve. In the short run, when prices are sticky, the 
expansion in aggregate demand leads to higher output and lower unemployment. 
Over time, as prices adjust, the economy returns to the natural level of output, 
and the higher aggregate demand results in a higher price level.

C H A P T E R  1 9   Government Debt and Budget Deficits  | 565
To see how international trade affects your analysis, you turn to the 
open-economy models in Chapters 6 and 13. The model in Chapter 6 
shows that when national saving falls, people start financing investment 
by borrowing from abroad, causing a trade deficit. Although the inflow of 
capital from abroad mitigates the effect of the fiscal-policy change on U.S. 
capital accumulation, the United States becomes indebted to foreign coun­
tries. The fiscal-policy change also causes the dollar to appreciate, which 
makes foreign goods cheaper in the United States and domestic goods 
more expensive abroad. The Mundell–Fleming model in Chapter 13 shows 
that the appreciation of the dollar and the resulting fall in net exports 
reduce the short-run expansionary impact of the fiscal change on output 
and employment.
With all these models in mind, you draft a response:
Dear Senator:
A tax cut financed by government borrowing would have many effects on 
the economy. The immediate impact of the tax cut would be to stimulate con­
sumer spending. Higher consumer spending affects the economy in both the 
short run and the long run.
In the short run, higher consumer spending would raise the demand for 
goods and services and thus raise output and employment. Interest rates would 
also rise, however, as investors competed for a smaller flow of saving. Higher 
interest rates would discourage investment and would encourage capital to flow 
in from abroad. The dollar would rise in value against foreign currencies, and 
U.S. firms would become less competitive in world markets.
In the long run, the smaller national saving resulting from the tax cut would 
mean a smaller capital stock and a greater foreign debt. Therefore, the output of 
the nation would be smaller, and a greater share of that output would be owed 
to foreigners.
The overall effect of the tax cut on economic well-being is hard to judge. 
Current generations would benefit from higher consumption and higher 
employment, although inflation would likely be higher as well. Future genera­
tions would bear much of the burden of today’s budget deficits: they would be 
born into a nation with a smaller capital stock and a larger foreign debt.

Your faithful servant,
	
CBO Economist
The senator replies:
Dear CBO Economist:
Thank you for your letter. It made sense to me. But yesterday my com­
mittee heard testimony from a prominent economist who called herself a 
“Ricardian” and who reached quite a different conclusion. She said that a tax 
cut by itself would not stimulate consumer spending. She concluded that the 
budget deficit would therefore not have all the effects you listed. What’s going 
on here?
	
Sincerely,

Committee Chair
After studying the next section, you write back to the senator, explaining in 
detail the debate over Ricardian equivalence.

566 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
Throughout this book we have summarized the tax 
system with a single variable, T. In our models, the 
policy instrument is the level of taxation that the 
government chooses; we have ignored the issue of 
how the government raises this tax revenue. In prac­
tice, however, taxes are not lump-sum payments 
but are levied on some type of economic activity. 
The U.S. federal government raises some revenue by 
taxing personal income (46 percent of tax revenue 
in 2014), some by taxing payrolls (34  percent), 
some by taxing corporate profits (11 percent), and 
some from other sources (6 percent).
Courses in public finance spend much time 
studying the pros and cons of alternative types 
of taxes. One lesson emphasized in such courses 
is that taxes affect incentives. When people are 
taxed on their labor earnings, they have less incen­
tive to work hard. When people are taxed on the 
income from owning capital, they have less incen­
tive to save and invest in capital. As a result, when 
taxes change, incentives change, and this can have 
macroeconomic effects. If lower tax rates encour­
age increased work and investment, the aggregate 
supply of goods and services increases.
Some economists, called supply-siders, believe 
that the incentive effects of taxes are large. Some 
supply-siders go so far as to suggest that tax cuts 
Taxes and Incentives
can be self-financing: a cut in tax rates induces 
such a large increase in aggregate supply that tax 
revenue increases, despite the fall in tax rates. 
Although all economists agree that taxes affect 
incentives and that incentives affect aggregate 
supply to some degree, most believe that the 
incentive effects are not large enough to make tax 
cuts self-financing in most circumstances.
In recent years, there has been much debate 
about how to reform the tax system to reduce 
the disincentives that impede the economy from 
reaching its full potential. A proposal endorsed 
by many economists is to move from the current 
income tax system toward a consumption tax. 
Compared to an income tax, a consumption 
tax would provide more incentives for saving, 
investment, and capital accumulation. One way 
of taxing consumption would be to expand the 
availability of tax-advantaged saving accounts, 
such as individual retirement accounts and 
401(k) plans, which exempt saving from taxation 
until that saving is later withdrawn and spent. 
Another way of taxing consumption would be 
to adopt a value-added tax, a tax on consump­
tion paid by producers rather than consumers, 
now used by many European countries to raise 
government revenue.1

The Ricardian View of 
Government Debt
The traditional view of government debt presumes that when the government 
cuts taxes and runs a budget deficit, consumers respond to their higher after-tax 
income by spending more. An alternative view, called Ricardian equivalence, 
1To read more about how taxes affect the economy through incentives, the best place to start is 
an undergraduate textbook in public finance, such as Harvey Rosen and Ted Gayer, Public Finance, 
10th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2014). In the more advanced literature that links public finance 
and macroeconomics, a classic reference is Christophe Chamley, “Optimal Taxation of Capital 
Income in a General Equilibrium Model With Infinite Lives,” Econometrica 54 (May 1986): 607–622. 
Chamley establishes conditions under which the tax system should not distort the incentive to save 
(that is, conditions under which consumption taxation is superior to income taxation). The robustness 
of this conclusion is investigated in Andrew Atkeson, V. V. Chari, and Patrick J. Kehoe, “Taxing Capi­
tal Income: A Bad Idea,” Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Quarterly Review 23 (Summer 1999): 3–17.

C H A P T E R  1 9   Government Debt and Budget Deficits  | 567
questions this presumption. According to the Ricardian view, consumers are 
forward-looking and, therefore, base their spending decisions not only on their 
current income but also on their expected future income. As we explored more 
fully in Chapter 16, the forward-looking consumer is at the heart of many mod­
ern theories of consumption. The Ricardian view of government debt applies the 
logic of the forward-looking consumer to analyzing the effects of fiscal policy.
The Basic Logic of Ricardian Equivalence
Consider the response of a forward-looking consumer to the tax cut that the 
Senate Budget Committee is considering. The consumer might reason as follows:
The government is cutting taxes without any plans to reduce government 
spending. Does this policy alter my set of opportunities? Am I richer because 
of this tax cut? Should I consume more?
Maybe not. The government is financing the tax cut by running a budget 
deficit. At some point in the future, the government will have to raise taxes to 
pay off the debt and accumulated interest. So the policy really involves a tax 
cut today coupled with a tax hike in the future. The tax cut merely gives me 
transitory income that eventually will be taken back. I am not any better off, so 
I will leave my consumption unchanged.
The forward-looking consumer understands that government borrowing today 
means higher taxes in the future. A tax cut financed by government debt does not 
reduce the tax burden; it merely reschedules it. It therefore should not encourage 
the consumer to spend more.
One can view this argument another way. Suppose that the government 
borrows $1,000 from the typical citizen to give that citizen a $1,000 tax cut. 
In essence, this policy is the same as giving the citizen a $1,000 government bond 
as a gift. One side of the bond says, “The government owes you, the bondholder, 
$1,000 plus interest.” The other side says, “You, the taxpayer, owe the govern­
ment $1,000 plus interest.” Overall, the gift of a bond from the government to 
the typical citizen does not make the citizen richer or poorer because the value 
of the bond is offset by the value of the future tax liability.
The general principle is that government debt is equivalent to future taxes, 
and if consumers are sufficiently forward-looking, future taxes are equivalent 
to current taxes. Hence, financing the government by debt is equivalent to 
financing it by taxes. This view is called Ricardian equivalence after the famous 
nineteenth-century economist David Ricardo because he first noted this theo­
retical argument.
The implication of Ricardian equivalence is that a debt-financed tax cut 
leaves consumption unaffected. Households save the extra disposable income to 
pay the future tax liability that the tax cut implies. This increase in private sav­
ing exactly offsets the decrease in public saving. National saving—the sum of 
private and public saving—remains the same. The tax cut therefore has none of 
the effects that the traditional analysis predicts.
The logic of Ricardian equivalence does not mean that all changes in fiscal 
policy are irrelevant. Changes in fiscal policy do influence consumer spending 
if they influence present or future government purchases. For example, suppose 

568 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
that the government cuts taxes today because it plans to reduce government 
purchases in the future. If the consumer understands that this tax cut does not 
require an increase in future taxes, she feels richer and raises her consump­
tion. But note that it is the reduction in government purchases, rather than the 
reduction in taxes, that stimulates consumption: the announcement of a future 
reduction in government purchases would raise consumption today even if cur­
rent taxes were unchanged because it would imply lower taxes at some time in 
the future.
Consumers and Future Taxes
The essence of the Ricardian view is that when people choose their level of con­
sumption, they rationally look ahead to the future taxes implied by government 
debt. But how forward-looking are consumers? Defenders of the traditional view 
of government debt believe that the prospect of future taxes does not have as 
large an influence on current consumption as the Ricardian view assumes. Here 
are some of their arguments.2
Myopia  Proponents of the Ricardian view of fiscal policy assume that people 
are rational when making such decisions as choosing how much of their income 
to consume and how much to save. When the government borrows to pay for 
current spending, rational consumers look ahead to the future taxes required to 
support this debt. Thus, the Ricardian view presumes that people have substantial 
knowledge and foresight.
One possible argument for the traditional view of tax cuts is that people are 
shortsighted, perhaps because they do not fully comprehend the implications of 
government budget deficits. It is possible that some people follow simple and 
not fully rational rules of thumb when choosing how much to save. Suppose, for 
example, that a person acts on the assumption that future taxes will be the same 
as current taxes. This person will fail to take into account future changes in taxes 
required by current government policies. A debt-financed tax cut will lead this 
person to believe that her lifetime income has increased, even if it hasn’t. The tax 
cut will therefore lead to higher consumption and lower national saving.
Borrowing Constraints The Ricardian view of government debt assumes that 
consumers base their spending not on their current income but on their lifetime 
income, which includes both current and expected future income. ­According 
to the Ricardian view, a debt-financed tax cut increases current income, but it 
does not alter lifetime income or consumption. Advocates of the traditional view 
of government debt argue that current income is more important than lifetime 
income for those consumers who face binding ­borrowing ­constraints. A borrowing 
constraint is a limit on how much an individual can ­borrow from banks or other 
financial institutions.

An Evaluation of Theory and Evidence,” NBER Macroeconomics Annual (1987): 263–303. See also the 
symposium on budget deficits in the Spring 1989 issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives.

C H A P T E R  1 9   Government Debt and Budget Deficits  | 569
A person who would like to consume more than her current income 
allows—perhaps because she expects higher income in the future—has to do 
so by borrowing. If she cannot borrow to finance current consumption, or can 
borrow only a limited amount, her current income determines her spending, 
regardless of what her lifetime income might be. In this case, a debt-financed 
tax cut raises current income and thus consumption, even though future 
income will be lower. In essence, when the government cuts current taxes and 
raises future taxes, it is giving taxpayers a loan. If a person wanted to obtain a 
loan but was unable to, the tax cut expands her opportunities and stimulates 
­consumption.
3Matthew D. Shapiro and Joel Slemrod, “Consumer Response to the Timing of Income: Evidence 
From a Change in Tax Withholding,” American Economic Review 85 (March 1995): 274–283.
George H. W. Bush’s Withholding Experiment
In early 1992, President George H. W. Bush pursued a novel policy to deal with 
the lingering recession in the United States. By executive order, he lowered the 
amount of income taxes that were being withheld from workers’ paychecks. The 
order did not reduce the amount of taxes that workers owed; it merely delayed 
payment. The higher take-home pay that workers received during 1992 was to 
be offset by higher tax payments, or smaller tax refunds, when income taxes were 
due in April 1993.
What effect would you predict for this policy? According to the logic of 
Ricardian equivalence, consumers should have realized that their lifetime 
resources were unchanged and, therefore, saved the extra take-home pay to meet 
the upcoming tax liability. Yet George Bush claimed his policy would provide 
“money people can use to help pay for clothing, college, or to get a new car.” 
That is, he believed that consumers would spend the extra income, thereby 
stimulating aggregate demand and helping the economy recover from the reces­
sion. Bush seemed to be assuming that consumers were shortsighted or faced 
binding borrowing constraints.
Gauging the actual effects of this policy is difficult with aggregate data because 
many other things were happening at the same time. Yet some evidence comes 
from a survey two economists conducted shortly after the policy was announced. 
The survey asked people what they would do with the extra income. Fifty-
seven percent of the respondents said they would save it, use it to repay debts, 
or adjust their withholding in order to reverse the effect of Bush’s executive 
order. Forty-three percent said they would spend the extra income. Thus, for 
this policy change, a majority of the population was planning to act as Ricardian 
theory posits. Nonetheless, Bush was partly right: many people planned to spend 
the extra income, even though they understood that the following year’s tax bill 
would be higher.3 n

Future Generations  Besides myopia and borrowing constraints, a third 
argument for the traditional view of government debt is that consumers expect 
the implied future taxes to fall not on them but on future generations. Suppose, 
for example, that the government cuts taxes today, issues 
30-year bonds to finance the budget deficit, and then 
raises taxes in 30 years to repay the loan. In this case, the 
government debt represents a transfer of wealth from the 
next generation of taxpayers (which faces the tax hike) to 
the current generation of taxpayers (which gets the tax 
cut). This transfer raises the lifetime resources of the cur­
rent generation, so it raises their consumption. In essence, 
a debt-financed tax cut stimulates consumption because it 
gives the current generation the opportunity to consume 
at the expense of the next generation.
Economist Robert Barro has provided a clever rejoin­
der to this argument to support the Ricardian view. Barro 
argues that because future generations are the children and 
grandchildren of the current generation, we should not view 
these various generations as independent economic actors. 
Instead, he argues, the appropriate assumption is that cur­
rent generations care about future generations. This altruism 
between generations is evidenced by the gifts that many 
people give their children, often in the form of bequests at 
the time of their deaths. The existence of bequests suggests 
that many people are not eager to take advantage of the 
opportunity to consume at their children’s expense.
According to Barro’s analysis, the relevant decisionmaking unit is not the 
individual, whose life is finite, but the family, which continues forever. In other 
words, an individual decides how much to consume based not only on her 
own income but also on the income of future members of her family. A debt-
financed tax cut may raise the income an individual receives in her lifetime, but 
it does not raise her family’s overall resources. Instead of consuming the extra 
income from the tax cut, the individual saves it and leaves it as a bequest to her 
children, who will bear the future tax liability.
We can see now that the debate over government debt is really a debate 
over consumer behavior. The Ricardian view assumes that consumers have a 
long time horizon. Barro’s analysis of the family implies that the consumer’s 
time horizon, like the government’s, is effectively infinite. Yet it is possible that 
consumers do not look ahead to the tax liabilities of future generations. Perhaps 
they expect their children to be richer than they are and therefore welcome the 
opportunity to consume at their children’s expense. The fact that many people 
leave zero or minimal bequests to their children is consistent with this hypothesis. 
For these zero-bequest families, a debt-financed tax cut alters consumption by 
redistributing wealth among generations.4

Making a Choice
Having seen the traditional and Ricardian views of government debt, you should 
ask yourself two sets of questions.
First, with which view do you agree? If the government cuts taxes today, runs 
a budget deficit, and raises taxes in the future, how will the policy affect the 
economy? Will it stimulate consumption, as the traditional view holds? Or will 
consumers understand that their lifetime income is unchanged and, therefore, 
offset the budget deficit with higher private saving?
Second, why do you hold the view that you do? If you agree with the tradi­
tional view of government debt, what is the reason? Do consumers fail to under­
stand that higher government borrowing today means higher taxes tomorrow? 
Or do they ignore future taxes either because they face borrowing constraints or 
because future taxes will fall on future generations with which they do not feel 
an economic link? If you hold the Ricardian view, do you believe that consumers 
have the foresight to see that government borrowing today will result in future 
taxes levied on them or their descendants? Do you believe that consumers will 
save the extra income to offset that future tax liability?
We might hope that the evidence could help us decide between these two 
views of government debt. Yet when economists examine historical episodes of 
large budget deficits, the evidence is inconclusive. History can be interpreted in 
different ways.
5B. Douglas Bernheim, Andrei Shleifer, and Lawrence H. Summers, “The Strategic Bequest 
Motive,” Journal of Political Economy 93 (1985): 1045–1076.
Why Do Parents Leave Bequests?
The debate over Ricardian equivalence is partly a debate over how different gen­
erations are linked to one another. Robert Barro’s defense of the Ricardian view 
is based on the assumption that parents leave their children bequests because they 
care about them. But is altruism really the reason that parents leave bequests?
One group of economists has suggested that parents use bequests to control 
their children. Parents often want their children to do certain things for them, 
such as phoning home regularly, visiting on holidays, and taking care of them in 
their old age. Perhaps parents use the implicit threat of disinheritance to induce 
their children to be more attentive.
To test this “strategic bequest motive,” these economists examined data on 
how often children visit their parents. They found that the wealthier the parent, 
the more often the children visit. Even more striking was another result: only 
wealth that can be left as a bequest induces more frequent visits. Wealth that can­
not be bequeathed—such as pension wealth, which reverts to the pension com­
pany in the event of an early death—does not encourage children to visit. These 
findings suggest that there may be more to the relationships among generations 
than mere altruism.5 n

Consider, for example, the experience of the 1980s. The large budget deficits, 
caused partly by the Reagan tax cut of 1981, seem to offer a natural experiment 
to test the two views of government debt. At first glance, this episode appears 
decisively to support the traditional view. The large budget deficits coincided 
with low national saving, high real interest rates, and a large trade deficit. Indeed, 
advocates of the traditional view of government debt often claim that the experi­
ence of the 1980s confirms their position.
Yet those who hold the Ricardian view of government debt interpret these 
events differently. Perhaps saving was low in the 1980s because people were opti­
mistic about future economic growth—an optimism that was also reflected in a 
booming stock market. Or perhaps saving was low because people expected that 
the tax cut would eventually lead not to higher taxes but, as Reagan promised, 
to lower government spending. Because it is hard to rule out any of these inter­
pretations, both views of government debt survive.
payment of 50 pounds per annum was equally 
­burdensome with a single tax of 1000 pounds. He 
would have some vague notion that the 50 pounds 
per annum would be paid by posterity, and would not 
be paid by him; but if he leaves his fortune to his son, 
and leaves it charged with this perpetual tax, where is 
the difference whether he leaves him 20,000 pounds 
with the tax, or 19,000 pounds without it?
Although Ricardo viewed these alternative meth­
ods of government finance as equivalent, he did 
not think other people would view them as such:
The people who pay taxes . . . do not manage their 
private affairs accordingly. We are apt to think 
that the war is burdensome only in proportion to 
what we are at the moment called to pay for it in 
taxes, without reflecting on the probable duration 
of such taxes.
Thus, Ricardo doubted that people were rational 
and farsighted enough to look ahead fully to 
their future tax liabilities.
As a policymaker, Ricardo took the govern­
ment debt seriously. Before the British Parliament, 
he once declared:
This would be the happiest country in the world, 
and its progress in prosperity would go beyond the 
powers of imagination to conceive, if we got rid of 
two great evils—the national debt and the corn laws.
It is one of the great ironies in the history of eco­
nomic thought that Ricardo rejected the theory 
that now bears his name!
Ricardo on Ricardian Equivalence
David Ricardo was a millionaire stockbroker 
and one of the greatest economists of all time. 
His most important contribution to the field 
was his 1817 book Principles of Political Economy 
and Taxation, in which he developed the theory 
of comparative advantage, which economists 
still use to explain the gains from international 
trade. Ricardo was also a member of the British 
Parliament, where he put his own theories to 
work and opposed the corn laws, which restricted 
international trade in grain.
Ricardo was interested in the alternative ways 
in which a government might pay for its expen­
diture. In an 1820 article called “Essay on the 
Funding System,” he considered an example of a 
war that cost 20 million pounds. He noted that if 
the interest rate was 5 percent, this expense could 
be financed with a one-time tax of 20  million 
pounds, a perpetual tax of 1 million pounds, or a 
tax of 1.2 million pounds for 45 years. He wrote:
In point of economy, there is no real difference 
in either of the modes; for twenty million in one 
payment, one million per annum for ever, or 
1,200,000 pounds for 45 years, are precisely of the 
same value.
Ricardo was aware that the issue involved the 
linkages among generations:
It would be difficult to convince a man possessed of 
20,000 pounds, or any other sum, that a perpetual

Other Perspectives 
on Government Debt
The policy debates over government debt have many facets. So far we have con­
sidered the traditional and Ricardian views of government debt. According to 
the traditional view, a government budget deficit expands aggregate demand and 
stimulates output in the short run but crowds out capital and depresses economic 
growth in the long run. According to the Ricardian view, a government budget 
deficit has none of these effects because consumers understand that a budget def­
icit represents merely the postponement of a tax burden. With these two theories 
as background, we now consider several other perspectives on government debt.
Balanced Budgets Versus Optimal Fiscal Policy
In the United States, many state constitutions require the state government to 
run a balanced budget. A recurring topic of political debate is whether the U.S. 
Constitution should require a balanced budget for the federal government as 
well. Most economists oppose a strict rule requiring the government to balance 
its budget. There are three reasons that optimal fiscal policy may at times call for 
a budget deficit or surplus.
Stabilization A budget deficit or surplus can help stabilize the economy. 
In essence, a balanced-budget rule would revoke the automatic stabilizing pow­
ers of the system of taxes and transfers. When the economy goes into a recession, 
taxes automatically fall, and transfers automatically rise. Although these auto­
matic responses help stabilize the economy, they push the budget into deficit. 
A strict balanced-budget rule would require that the government raise taxes or 
reduce spending in a recession, but these actions would further depress aggregate 
demand. Discretionary fiscal policy is more likely to move in the opposite direc­
tion over the course of the business cycle. In 2009, for example, President Barack 
Obama signed a stimulus bill authorizing a large increase in spending to try to 
reduce the severity of the recession, even though it led to the largest budget 
deficit in more than half a century.
Tax Smoothing A budget deficit or surplus can be used to reduce the distor­
tion of incentives caused by the tax system. As discussed earlier, high tax rates 
impose a cost on society by discouraging economic activity. A tax on labor earn­
ings, for instance, reduces the incentive that people have to work long hours. 
Because this disincentive becomes particularly large at very high tax rates, the 
total social cost of taxes is minimized by keeping tax rates relatively stable rather 
than making them high in some years and low in others. Economists call this 
policy tax smoothing. To keep tax rates smooth, a deficit is necessary in years of 
unusually low income (recessions) or unusually high expenditure (wars).
Intergenerational Redistribution A budget deficit can be used to shift a 
tax burden from current to future generations. For example, some economists 
argue that if the current generation fights a war to preserve freedom, future 

574 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
­generations benefit as well and should bear some of the burden. To pass on some 
of the war’s costs, the current generation can finance the war with a budget 
deficit. The ­government can later retire the debt by levying taxes on the next 
generation.
These considerations lead most economists to reject a strict balanced-budget 
rule. At the very least, a rule for fiscal policy needs to take account of the recur­
ring episodes, such as recessions and wars, during which it is reasonable for the 
government to run a budget deficit.
Fiscal Effects on Monetary Policy
In 1985, Paul Volcker told Congress that “the actual and prospective size of the 
budget deficit . . . heightens skepticism about our ability to control the money 
supply and contain inflation.” A decade later, Alan Greenspan claimed that 
“a substantial reduction in the long-term prospective deficit of the United States 
will significantly lower very long-term inflation expectations.” Both of these Fed 
chairmen apparently saw a link between fiscal policy and monetary policy.
We first discussed such a possibility in Chapter 5. As we saw, one way for a 
government to finance a budget deficit is simply to print money—a policy that 
leads to higher inflation. Indeed, when countries experience hyperinflation, the 
typical reason is that fiscal policymakers are relying on the inflation tax to pay 
for some of their spending. The ends of hyperinflations almost always coincide 
with fiscal reforms that include large cuts in government spending and therefore 
a reduced need for seigniorage.
In addition to this link between the budget deficit and inflation, some econo­
mists have suggested that a high level of debt might also encourage the govern­
ment to create inflation. Because most government debt is specified in nominal 
terms, the real value of the debt falls when the price level rises. This is the usual 
redistribution between creditors and debtors caused by unexpected inflation—
here the debtor is the government and the creditor is the private sector. But this 
debtor, unlike others, has access to the monetary printing press. A high level of 
debt might encourage the government to print money, thereby raising the price 
level and reducing the real value of its debts.
Despite these concerns about a possible link between government debt and 
monetary policy, there is little evidence that this link is important in most devel­
oped countries. In the United States, for instance, inflation was high in the 1970s, 
even though government debt was low relative to GDP. Monetary policymakers 
got inflation under control in the early 1980s, just as fiscal policymakers started 
running large budget deficits and increasing the government debt. In 2014, the 
debt–GDP ratio was high by historical standards, but inflation was a bit below the 
Fed’s announced target of 2 percent. Thus, although monetary policy might be 
driven by fiscal policy in some situations, such as during classic hyperinflations, 
this situation appears not to be the norm in most countries today. There are sev­
eral reasons for this. First, most governments can finance deficits by selling debt 
and don’t need to rely on seigniorage. Second, central banks often have enough 
independence to resist political pressure for more expansionary monetary policy. 

C H A P T E R  1 9   Government Debt and Budget Deficits  | 575
Third, and most important, policymakers in all parts of government know that 
inflation is a poor solution to fiscal problems.6
Debt and the Political Process
Fiscal policy is made not by angels but by an imperfect political process. Some 
economists worry that the possibility of financing government spending by issu­
ing debt makes that political process all the worse.
This idea has a long history. Nineteenth-century economist Knut Wicksell 
claimed that if the benefit of some type of government spending exceeded its cost, 
it should be possible to finance that spending in a way that would receive unani­
mous support from the voters. He concluded that government spending should be 
undertaken only when support is, in fact, nearly unanimous. In the case of debt 
finance, however, Wicksell was concerned that “the interests [of future taxpayers] are 
not represented at all or are represented inadequately in the tax-approving assembly.”
Many economists have echoed this theme more recently. In their 1977 book 
Democracy in Deficit, James Buchanan and Richard Wagner argued for a balanced-
budget rule for fiscal policy on the grounds that it “will have the effect of 
bringing the real costs of public outlays to the awareness of decision makers; it 
will tend to dispel the illusory ‘something for nothing’ aspects of fiscal choice.” 
Similarly, Martin Feldstein (once an economic adviser to Ronald Reagan and 
a long-time critic of budget deficits) argued that “only the ‘hard budget con­
straint’ of having to balance the budget” can force politicians to judge whether 
spending’s “benefits really justify its costs.”
These arguments have led some economists to favor a constitutional amend­
ment requiring Congress to pass a balanced budget. Often these proposals have 
escape clauses for times of national emergency, such as wars and depressions, 
when a budget deficit is a reasonable policy response. Some critics of these pro­
posals argue that, even with the escape clauses, such a constitutional amendment 
would tie the hands of policymakers too severely. Others claim that Congress 
would easily evade the balanced-budget requirement with accounting tricks. 
As this discussion makes clear, the debate over the desirability of a balanced-
budget amendment is as much political as economic.
International Dimensions
Government debt may affect a nation’s role in the world economy. As we first 
saw in Chapter 6, when a government budget deficit reduces national saving, 
it often leads to a trade deficit, which in turn is financed by borrowing from 
abroad. For instance, many observers have blamed U.S. fiscal policy for the 
relatively recent switch of the United States from a major creditor in the world 
economy to a major debtor. This link between the budget deficit and the trade 
deficit leads to two further effects of government debt.
6A recent literature on the fiscal theory of the price level reemphasizes the linkages between monetary 
and fiscal policy. For an introduction, see Christopher A. Sims, “Paper Money,” American Economic 
Review, April 2015, forthcoming.

576 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
First, high levels of government debt may increase the risk that an economy will 
experience capital flight—an abrupt decline in the demand for a country’s assets 
in world financial markets. International investors are aware that a government can 
always deal with its debt simply by defaulting. This approach was used as far back 
as 1335, when England’s King Edward III defaulted on his debt to Italian bankers. 
More recently, Russia defaulted on its debts in 1998, and Argentina did the same 
in 2001. The higher the level of the government debt, the greater the temptation 
to default. Thus, as government debt increases, international investors may come to 
fear default and curtail their lending. If this loss of confidence occurs suddenly, the 
result could be the classic symptoms of capital flight: a collapse in the value of the 
currency and an increase in interest rates. As we discussed in Chapter 13, this is pre­
cisely what happened to Mexico in the early 1990s when default appeared likely.
Second, high levels of government debt financed by foreign borrowing may 
reduce a nation’s political clout in world affairs. This fear was emphasized by 
economist Benjamin Friedman in his 1988 book Day of Reckoning. He wrote, 
“World power and influence have historically accrued to creditor countries. It is 
not coincidental that America emerged as a world power simultaneously with 
our transition from a debtor nation . . . to a creditor supplying investment capital 
to the rest of the world.” Friedman suggests that if the United States continues to 
run large trade deficits, it will eventually lose some of its international influence. 
So far, the record has not been kind to this hypothesis: the United States has 
run trade deficits throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and the first decade of the 2000s 
and, nonetheless, remains a leading superpower. But perhaps other events—such 
as the collapse of the Soviet Union—offset the decrease in political clout that 
the United States would have experienced because of its increased indebtedness.
The Benefits of Indexed Bonds
In 1997, the U.S. Treasury Department started to issue bonds that pay a return 
based on the consumer price index. These bonds typically pay a low interest 
rate of about 2 percent, so a $1,000 bond pays only $20 per year in interest. 
But that ­interest payment grows with the overall price level as measured by the 
consumer price index (CPI). In addition, when the $1,000 of principal is repaid, 
that amount is also adjusted for changes in the CPI. The 2 percent, therefore, is a 
real interest rate. Professors of macroeconomics no longer need to define the real 
interest rate as an abstract construct. They can open the New York Times, point to 
the credit report, and say, “Look here, this is a nominal interest rate, and this is a 
real interest rate.” (Professors in the United Kingdom and several other countries 
have long enjoyed this luxury because indexed bonds have been trading in other 
countries for years.)
Of course, making macroeconomics easier to teach was not the reason that 
the Treasury chose to index some of the government debt. That was just a 
positive externality. Its goal was to introduce a new type of government bond 
that would benefit bondholder and taxpayer alike. These bonds are a win–win 
proposition because they insulate both sides of the transaction from inflation

risk. ­Bondholders should care about the real interest rate they earn, and ­taxpayers 
should care about the real interest rate they pay. When government bonds are 
specified in nominal terms, both sides take on risk that is neither productive nor 
necessary. The indexed bonds eliminate this inflation risk.
In addition, the indexed bonds have three other benefits.
First, the bonds may encourage the private sector to begin issuing its own 
indexed securities. Financial innovation is, to some extent, a public good. Once 
an innovation has been introduced into the market, the idea is nonexcludable 
(people cannot be prevented from using it) and nonrival (one person’s use of the 
idea does not diminish other people’s use of it). Just as a free market will not 
adequately supply the public goods of national defense and basic research, it will 
not adequately supply financial innovation. The Treasury’s indexed bonds can be 
viewed as a remedy for that market failure.
Second, the bonds reduce the government’s incentive to produce surprise 
inflation. After the budget deficits of the past few decades, the U.S. government is 
now a substantial debtor, and its debts are specified almost entirely in dollar terms. 
What is unique about the federal government, in contrast to most debtors, is that 
it can print the money it needs. The greater the government’s nominal debts, the 
more incentive the government has to inflate away its debt. The Treasury’s switch 
toward indexed debt reduces this potentially problematic incentive.
Third, the bonds provide data that might be useful for monetary policy. Many 
macroeconomic theories point to expected inflation as a key variable to explain 
the relationship between inflation and unemployment. But what is expected 
inflation? One way to measure it is to survey private forecasters. Another way is 
to look at the difference between the yield on nominal bonds and the yield on 
real bonds of the same maturity.
The Treasury’s indexed bonds, therefore, produced many benefits: less inflation 
risk, more financial innovation, better government incentives, more informed 
monetary policy, and easier lives for students and teachers of macroeconomics.7 n

Economic Perspectives 12 (Winter 1998): 219–227.

Conclusion
Fiscal policy and government debt are central in the political and economic 
debate worldwide. This chapter discussed some of the economic issues that lie 
behind the policy decisions. As we have seen, economists are not in complete 
agreement about the measurement or effects of government indebtedness. Nor 
are economists in agreement about the best budget policy. And, of course, econo­
mists are not in charge of designing and enacting budget policies. For better or 
worse, that role goes to our elected leaders, who follow the recommendations of 
their economic advisers only when they choose to.

Summary
	1.	The current debt of the U.S. federal government is not extraordinary, 
but it is higher than average compared to the debt of other countries 
or compared to the debt that the United States has had throughout its 
own history. The debt–GDP ratio rose precipitously during the Great 
Recession ­following the financial crisis of 2008–2009, because automatic 
stabilizers and discretionary fiscal actions increased the government’s 
budget deficit.
	2.	Standard measures of the budget deficit are imperfect measures of fiscal 
policy because they do not correct for the effects of inflation, do not 
offset changes in government liabilities with changes in government assets, 
omit some ­liabilities altogether, and do not correct for the effects of the 
business cycle.
	3.	According to the traditional view of government debt, a debt-financed tax 
cut stimulates consumer spending and lowers national saving. This increase 
in consumer spending leads to greater aggregate demand and higher 
income in the short run, but it leads to a lower capital stock and lower 
income in the long run.
	4.	According to the Ricardian view of government debt, a debt-financed tax 
cut does not stimulate consumer spending because it does not raise con­
sumers’ overall resources—it merely reschedules taxes from the present to 
the future. The debate between the traditional and Ricardian views of gov­
ernment debt is ultimately a debate over how consumers behave. Are con­
sumers rationally forward-looking or shortsighted? Do they face binding 
borrowing constraints? Are they economically linked to future generations 
through altruistic bequests? Economists’ views of government debt hinge 
on their answers to these questions.
	5.	Most economists oppose a strict rule requiring a balanced budget. A budget 
deficit can sometimes be justified on the basis of short-run stabilization, tax 
smoothing, or intergenerational redistribution of the tax burden.
	6.	Government debt can potentially have other effects. Large government 
debt or budget deficits may encourage excessive monetary expansion and, 
therefore, lead to greater inflation. The possibility of running budget defi­
cits may encourage politicians to unduly burden future generations when 
setting government spending and taxes. A high level of government debt 
may increase the risk of capital flight and diminish a nation’s influence 
around the world. Economists differ on which of these effects they consider 
most important.

We hope our move will prompt other corpora­
tions to take similar action to do their part to 
reduce the country’s debt.” Would such actions 
by U.S. corporations actually reduce the national 
debt as it is now measured? How would your 
answer change if the U.S. government adopted 
capital budgeting? Do you think these actions 
represent a true reduction in the government’s

Congress increases both the tax and the benefits. 
For simplicity, assume that Congress announces 
that the increases will last for only one year.

affect the economy? (Hint: Think about the 
marginal propensities to consume of the 
young and the old.)

that the cyclically adjusted budget always be

problems do you see with the rule requiring a

Do you think these assumptions are reasonable?

The Financial System: 
Opportunities and Dangers
When written in Chinese the word crisis is composed of two characters. One 
represents danger, and the other represents opportunity.
—John F. Kennedy
I
n 2008 and 2009, the U.S. economy experienced a historic crisis. As we 
discussed in previous chapters, a decline in housing prices led to problems 
in many financial institutions, which in turn led to the most severe eco­
nomic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. This event was a vivid 
reminder of the inextricable links between the financial system and the broader 
economy. When Wall Street sneezes, Main Street catches a cold.
In this chapter we examine the links between the economy and the finan­
cial system more thoroughly. We discuss what the financial system is and how 
it works. We also discuss the new challenges that the financial system offers to 
policymakers charged with promoting short-run economic stability and long-
run economic growth.
The financial system has been present in much of the macroeconomic theory 
we have developed throughout this book. In Chapter 3 we discussed a model of 
the loanable-funds market. There we saw that the interest rate adjusts to balance 
the supply of loanable funds (derived from the nation’s saving) and the demand 
for loanable funds (for purpose of investment). In Chapters 8 and 9 we used 
the Solow model to examine the sources of long-run economic growth. In that 
model, the financial system is in the background, ensuring that the economy’s 
saving is directed into investment and capital accumulation.
The financial system has been similarly present in our short-run analysis. In the 
IS–LM model of Chapters 11 and 12, the interest rate is the link between the 
goods market and the money market. In that model, the interest rate determines 
both the cost of holding money and the cost of borrowing to fund investment 
spending. It is therefore the crucial variable through which monetary policy 
influences the aggregate demand for goods and services.
By studying the financial system in more detail, we can make our analysis of 
economic growth and fluctuations more nuanced. The financial system is more 
than a single market for loanable funds, and there are more prices in this system 
20

than a single interest rate. Indeed, the complexity of the financial system is suf­
ficiently great that there is an entire subfield of economics, called finance, devoted 
to its study. This chapter focuses on a couple of topics within finance that are 
crucial to a fuller understanding of macroeconomics. We start by examining the 
fundamental role of the financial system in the economy. We then examine the 
causes of financial crises and the policy responses to them.
20-1
What Does the Financial System Do?
Larry is a rational, forward-looking consumer. He earns a good income of 
$200,000 a year but does not plan to spend all of it this year. He wants to put 
some of his income aside, perhaps for retirement, a future vacation, college 
tuition for his newborn son, or just as a precaution to prepare for future uncer­
tainties. The part of Larry’s income that he does not currently spend contributes 
to the nation’s saving.
Patti is an entrepreneur starting a new business. She has an idea for a doll 
that she believes would enchant children around the world and therefore be 
quite profitable. To put her idea into action, she needs to obtain some resources: 
plastics, molds, fabric, sewing machines, and a building to house her small manu­
facturing operation. Patti’s purchases of these capital goods contribute to the 
nation’s investment.
In short, Larry has some income he wants to save, and Patti has ideas for 
investments but may not have the funds to pay for them. The solution is obvious: 
Larry can finance Patti’s venture. The financial system is the broad term for 
the institutions in the economy that facilitate the flow of funds between savers 
and investors. That is, the financial system brings people like Larry and people 
like Patti together.1
Financing Investment
Throughout much of this book, the economy’s financial system was represented 
as a single market—the market for loanable funds. Those like Larry, who have 
some income they don’t want to consume immediately, bring their saving to this 
market so they can lend these funds to others. Those like Patti, who have invest­
ment projects they want to undertake, finance these investments by borrowing 
in this market. In this simple model, there is a single interest rate that adjusts to 
bring saving and investment into balance.
The actual financial system is more complicated than this description. As in 
the simple model, the main function of the system is to channel resources from 
savers into various forms of investment. But the system includes a large variety 
of mechanisms to facilitate this transfer of resources.
1Trivia fact: This story is not entirely fictional. The author really does know a Patti who started a 
doll business and a Larry who financed it.

C H A P T E R  2 0   The Financial System: Opportunities and Dangers  | 583
One piece of the financial system is the set of financial markets through which 
households can directly provide resources for investment. Two important financial 
markets are the market for bonds and the market for stocks. A bond represents 
a loan from the bondholder to the firm; a share of stock represents an ownership 
claim by the shareholder in the firm. That is, a person who buys a bond from, say, 
Apple Corporation becomes a creditor of the company, while a person who buys 
newly issued stock from Apple becomes a part owner of the company. (A purchase 
of stock on a stock exchange, however, represents a transfer of ownership shares from 
one person to another and does not provide new funds for investment projects.) 
Raising investment funds by issuing bonds is called debt finance, and raising funds 
by issuing stock is called equity finance. Debt and equity are forms of direct finance 
because the saver knows whose investment project his funds are financing.
Another piece of the financial system is the set of financial intermediaries 
through which households can indirectly provide resources for investment. 
As the term suggests, a financial intermediary stands between the two sides of 
the market and helps move financial resources toward their best use. Commercial 
banks are the best-known type of financial intermediary.2 They take deposits 
from savers and use these deposits to make loans to those who have investment 
projects they need to finance. Other examples of financial intermediaries include 
mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies. When an intermediary is 
involved, the financing is considered indirect because the saver is often unaware 
of whose investments his funds are financing.
To continue with our example, Larry and Patti can take advantage of any of 
these opportunities. If Patti and Larry know each other, she could borrow money 
directly from him and pay him interest on the loan. In this case, she would in 
effect be selling him a bond. Or Patti could, in exchange for Larry’s money, give 
him an ownership stake in her new business, and he would enjoy a share of the 
future profits. In this case, she would be selling him some stock. Or Larry could 
deposit his savings in a local bank, which in turn could lend the funds to Patti. 
In this last case, he would be financing her new venture indirectly: they might 
never meet, or even know of each other’s existence. In all of these cases, Larry 
and Patti engage in a mutually advantageous exchange. Larry finds a way to earn 
a return on his savings, and Patti finds a way to finance her investment project.
Sharing Risk
Investment is inherently risky. Patti’s new doll might be the next toy craze, or it 
might be a flop. Like all entrepreneurs, Patti is starting her venture because she 
expects it to be profitable, but she cannot be certain of that outcome.
2Throughout this chapter, the word bank should normally be taken to mean commercial bank, which 
is the most familiar type of bank. By contrast, an investment bank is a financial institution that assists 
firms and governments in the issuance of stocks and bonds, as well as performing several other 
functions such as helping arrange corporate mergers and acquisitions. Investment banks not only 
serve different functions from commercial banks but, because they do not accept insured deposits, 
are also subject to less regulatory oversight.

584 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
One function of the financial system is to allocate risk. When Patti sells stock 
to Larry, she is sharing the risk of her venture with him. If her doll business is 
profitable, he will enjoy some of the gains. If it loses money, he will share in 
the losses. Patti might be eager to share the risk, rather than bear it all herself, 
because she is risk averse. That is, other things equal, she dislikes uncertainty 
about her future economic outcomes. Larry might be willing to accept some of 
the risk if the return he expects on this risky venture is higher than he would 
obtain by putting his savings into safer assets. Thus, equity finance provides a way 
for entrepreneurs and savers to share the risks and returns associated with the 
entrepreneur’s investment ideas.
In addition, the financial system allows savers to reduce their risk by spread­
ing their wealth across many different businesses. Larry knows that buying 
stock in Patti’s doll venture is risky, so he would be smart to use only some 
of his savings to buy stock in her business. He could also buy stock from his 
friend Steve, who is opening an ice-cream store. And he could buy stock in 
established companies, such as IBM, General Electric, and Exxon. Because 
the success of Patti’s doll venture is not perfectly correlated with the success 
of Steve’s ice-cream store, or with the profitability of IBM, General Electric, 
and Exxon, Larry reduces the overall risk he faces when he spreads his wealth 
around. Reducing risk by holding many imperfectly correlated assets is called 
diversification.
Various financial institutions facilitate diversification. Among the most impor­
tant are mutual funds. Mutual funds are financial intermediaries that sell shares 
to savers and use their funds to buy diversified pools of assets. Even a small saver 
can put, say, $1,000 into a mutual fund and become a part owner of thousands of 
businesses. Because the fortunes of these many businesses are not perfectly cor­
related with one another, putting the $1,000 into a mutual fund is far less risky 
than using all of it to buy stock in a single company.
There are limits, however, to how much diversification reduces risk. Some 
macroeconomic events affect many businesses at the same time. Such risk is 
called systematic risk. In particular, recessions tend to reduce the demand for 
most products and thus the profitability of most businesses. Diversification 
cannot reduce this kind of risk. Yet it can largely eliminate the risks associated 
with individual businesses, called idiosyncratic risk, such as whether Patti’s doll 
or Steve’s ice cream proves popular. For this reason, it is wise for savers like 
Larry to limit how much of their savings they allocate to the stock of any 
one company.
Dealing With Asymmetric Information
As Larry considers financing Patti’s business venture, one question is paramount 
in his mind: Will her company succeed? If Larry offers her equity financing, 
he gets a share of future profits, so the fortune of the business is crucial. Debt 
financing is safer for Larry, because debt holders are paid before equity holders 
get anything, but Patti’s success is still relevant. If the doll business is a failure, 
Patti may not be able to repay the loan. That is, she might default. Not only 

C H A P T E R  2 0   The Financial System: Opportunities and Dangers  | 585
might Larry not get the interest he was promised, but he might lose his principal 
(the amount of the loan) as well.
Making matters worse is the fact that Patti knows a lot more than Larry about 
herself and her business. Economists use the phrase asymmetric information 
to describe a situation in which one party to an economic transaction has more 
information about the transaction than the other. There are two classic types of 
asymmetric information, both of which are relevant as Larry ponders whether 
to finance Patti’s venture.
The first type of asymmetric information concerns hidden knowledge about 
attributes. Is Patti’s doll design a good one that will have wide appeal? Is the 
doll market ready for a new product, or is it oversaturated? Is Patti a talented 
businesswoman? Patti is more likely than Larry to have reliable answers to 
these questions. This is generally the case: entrepreneurs have more information 
about whether their investment projects are good ones than those who provide 
the financing.
In this situation, Larry should worry about the problem of adverse selection. 
As we noted in Chapter 7 in a different context, the term “adverse selection” 
describes the tendency of people with more information (here, the entrepre­
neurs) to sort themselves in a way that disadvantages people with less infor­
mation (here, those providing the financing). In our example, Larry may be 
concerned that he will be offered opportunities to finance only less desirable 
business ventures. If Patti was truly confident in her idea, she might try harder 
to finance it herself, using more of her own savings. The fact that she is asking 
Larry to provide financing and share some of the risk suggests that perhaps she 
knows something adverse that he does not know. As a result, Larry has reason 
to be wary.
The second type of asymmetric information concerns hidden knowledge about 
actions. Once Patti obtains financing from Larry, she will have many decisions to 
make. Will she work long hours at the job, or will she cut out early to play tennis 
with friends? Will she spend the money she has raised in the most profitable way, 
or will she use it to provide herself with a cushy office and a fancy company 
car? Patti can promise to make decisions in the best interests of the business, but 
it will be hard for Larry to verify that she in fact does so because he won’t be at 
the doll factory every day to observe all the decisions that she makes.
In this case, the problem that arises is moral hazard, the risk that an imper­
fectly monitored agent will act in a dishonest or otherwise inappropriate way. 
In particular, entrepreneurs investing other people’s money may not look after 
the investment projects as carefully as those who invest their own money. Once 
Patti has Larry’s money in hand, she may be tempted to choose the easy life. 
If she succumbs to moral hazard, she will reduce the future profitability of the 
firm and increase the risk of default on her firm’s debts.
The financial system has developed various institutions that mitigate the 
effects of adverse selection and moral hazard. Banks are among the most 
important. When a person applies for a bank loan, he must fill out an application 
that asks detailed questions about his business plan, employment background, 
credit history, criminal record, and other financial and personal characteristics. 

586 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
Because the application is then scrutinized by loan officers trained to evaluate 
businesses, the bank stands a good chance of uncovering the hidden attributes 
that lead to adverse selection. In addition, to reduce the problem of moral haz­
ard, bank loans may contain restrictions on how the loan proceeds are spent, and 
the loan officers may monitor the business after the loan is made. As a result, 
rather than making a direct loan to Patti, it may make sense for Larry to deposit 
his money in a bank, which in turn will lend it to various entrepreneurs like 
Patti. The bank charges a fee for serving as an intermediary, reflected in the dif­
ference between the interest rate it charges on loans and the interest rate it pays 
on deposits. The bank earns its fee by reducing the problems associated with 
asymmetric information.
Fostering Economic Growth
In Chapters 8 and 9 we used the Solow model to examine the forces that gov­
ern long-run economic growth. In that model, we saw that a nation’s saving 
determines the steady-state level of capital, which in turn determines the steady-
state level of income per person. The more a nation saves, the more capital its 
labor force has to work with, the more it produces, and the more income its 
citizens enjoy.
The Solow model makes the simplifying assumption that there is only a single 
type of capital, but the real world includes many thousands of firms with diverse 
investment projects competing for the economy’s limited resources. Larry’s 
saving can finance Patti’s doll business, but it could instead finance Steve’s ice-
cream store, a Boeing aircraft factory, or a Walmart retail outlet. The financial 
system has the job of allocating the economy’s scarce saving among the alterna­
tive types of investment.
Ideally, to allocate saving to investment, all the financial system needs are 
market forces and the magic of Adam Smith’s invisible hand. Firms with par­
ticularly productive and profitable investment opportunities will be willing 
to pay higher interest rates for loans than those with less desirable projects. 
Thus, if the interest rate adjusts to balance the supply and demand for loanable 
funds, the economy’s saving will be allocated to the best of the many possible 
investments.
Yet, as we have seen, because the financial system is full of problems arising 
from asymmetric information, it can deviate from this simple ideal. Banks 
mitigate adverse selection and moral hazard to some extent, but they do not 
completely eliminate them. As a result, some valuable investment projects 
may not be undertaken because entrepreneurs cannot raise the funds to 
finance them. If the financial system fails to allocate the economy’s saving to 
its best uses, the economy’s overall level of productivity will be lower than 
it could be.
Government policy plays a role in helping ensure that the financial system 
works well. First, it can reduce the problem of moral hazard by prosecuting 
fraud and similar malfeasance. The law cannot ensure that Patti will put Larry’s 
money to its best use, but if she uses it to pay her personal living expenses, she 

C H A P T E R  2 0   The Financial System: Opportunities and Dangers  | 587
may well end up in jail. Second, the government can reduce the problem of 
adverse selection by requiring some kinds of disclosure. If Patti’s doll business 
ever grows large enough to issue stock on a public stock exchange, the govern­
ment’s Securities and Exchange Commission will require that she release regular 
reports on her firm’s earnings and assets and that these reports be certified by 
accredited accountants.
Because the quality of legal institutions varies around the world, some 
countries have better financial systems than others, and this difference is one 
source of international variation in living standards. Rich nations tend to 
have larger stock markets and larger banking systems (relative to the size of 
their economies) than poorer nations. As always, sorting out cause and effect 
is difficult when examining differences across countries. Nonetheless, many 
economists believe that one reason poor nations remain poor is that their 
financial systems are unable to direct their saving to the best possible invest­
ments. These nations can foster economic growth by reforming their legal 
institutions with an eye toward improving the performance of their financial 
systems. If they succeed, entrepreneurs with good ideas will find it easier to 
start their businesses.
Microfinance: Professor Yunus’s Profound Idea
In the 1970s, Muhammad Yunus was a professor of economics in Bangladesh. 
Like all economists, he knew that economic prosperity depends on the ability 
of entrepreneurs to get the financing they need to start their businesses. But 
he also knew that in his country and in similar developing nations, financ­
ing is often hard to find. In the United States, someone like Patti might well 
find a bank willing to make her a loan, especially if she had some of her own 
money to put into her business. But if she were living in a country with a less 
developed financial system, such as Bangladesh, and especially if she were poor, 
she would have a harder time financing her venture, no matter how profitable 
it might be.
Professor Yunus was not content just to study the problem; he wanted to 
solve it. In 1976, he founded the Grameen Bank, a nonprofit financial institu­
tion with the goal of making very small loans primarily to poor women so that 
they could start working their way out of poverty. In Bangla, the language of 
Bangladesh, Grameen Bank means “bank of the villages.”
Here is how the Grameen Bank explains its mission:
Microfinance is a proven tool for fighting poverty on a large scale. It provides very 
small loans, or micro-loans, to poor people, mostly women, to start or expand very 
small, self-sufficient businesses. Through their own ingenuity and drive, and the 
support of the lending microfinance institution (MFI), poor women are able to 
start their journey out of poverty.
Unlike commercial loans, no collateral is required for a micro-loan and it 
is usually repaid within six months to a year. Those funds are then recycled as 
other loans, keeping money working and in the hands of borrowers. For example, 
CASE STUDY

588 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
a woman could borrow $50 to buy chickens so that she can sell their eggs. As the 
chickens reproduce, she can sell more eggs and eventually sell the chicks. As a 
borrower, she receives advice and support from the MFI that issued her loan, and 
support from other borrowers just like her. Some MFIs also provide social services, 
such as basic health care for her and her children. As her business grows and diver­
sifies, she begins to earn enough to improve the living conditions for her and her 
family. Microfinance clients boast very high repayment rates. Averaging between 
95 and 98 percent, the repayment rates are better than that of student loan and 
credit card debts in the United States.
Professor Yunus’s plan has been remarkably successful, and it has been repli­
cated in many other places. In 2006, he and the Grameen Bank won the Nobel 
Peace Prize for helping foster economic development in some of the world’s 
poorest nations.3 n

Financial Crises
So far in this chapter we have discussed how the financial system works. We now 
discuss why the financial system might stop working and the broad macroeco­
nomic ramifications of such a disruption.
When we discussed the theory of the business cycle in Chapters 10 to 14, 
we saw that many kinds of shocks can lead to short-run fluctuations. A shift in 
consumer or business confidence, a rise or fall in world oil prices, or a sudden 
change in monetary or fiscal policy can alter aggregate demand or aggregate sup­
ply (or both). When this occurs, output and employment are pushed away from 
their natural levels, and inflation rises or falls.
Here we focus on one particular kind of shock. A financial crisis is a major 
disruption in the financial system that impedes the economy’s ability to interme­
diate between those who want to save and those who want to borrow and invest. 
Not surprisingly, given the financial system’s central role, financial crises have a 
broad macroeconomic impact. Throughout history, many of the deepest reces­
sions have followed problems in the financial system. These downturns include 
the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Recession of 2008–2009.
The Anatomy of a Crisis
Financial crises are not all alike, but they share some common features. In a nut­
shell, here are the six elements that are at the center of most financial crises. The 
financial crisis of 2008–2009 provides a good example of each element.
1. Asset-Price Booms and Busts  Often a period of optimism, leading to a 
large increase in asset prices, precedes a financial crisis. Sometimes people bid

basics. For more on this topic, see Beatriz Armendáriz and Jonathan Morduch, The Economics of 
Microfinance (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2007).

C H A P T E R  2 0   The Financial System: Opportunities and Dangers  | 589
up the price of an asset above its fundamental value (that is, the true value 
based on an objective analysis of the cash flows the asset will generate). In this 
case, the market for that asset is said to be in the grip of a speculative bubble. 
Later, when sentiment shifts and optimism turns to pessimism, the bubble 
bursts and prices begin to fall. The decline in asset prices is the catalyst for the 
financial crisis.
In 2008 and 2009, the crucial asset was residential real estate. The average 
price of housing in the United States had experienced a boom earlier in the 
decade. This boom was driven in part by lax lending standards; many subprime 
borrowers—those with particularly risky credit profiles—were lent money to 
buy a house while offering only a very small down payment. In essence, the 
financial system failed to do its job of dealing with asymmetric information by 
making loans to many borrowers who, it turned out, would later have trouble 
making their mortgage payments. The housing boom was also encouraged by 
government policies that promoted homeownership and was fed by excessive 
optimism on the part of home-buyers, who thought prices would rise forever. 
The housing boom, however, proved unsustainable. Over time, the number of 
homeowners falling behind on their mortgage payments rose, and sentiment 
among home-buyers shifted. Housing prices fell by about 30 percent from 2006 
to 2009. The nation had not experienced such a large decline in housing prices 
since the 1930s.
2. Insolvencies at Financial Institutions A large decline in asset prices 
may cause problems at banks and other financial institutions. To ensure that bor­
rowers repay their loans, banks often require them to post collateral. That is, a 
borrower has to pledge assets that the bank can seize if the borrower defaults. 
Yet when assets decline in price, the collateral falls in value, perhaps below the 
amount of the loan. In this case, if the borrower defaults on the loan, the bank 
may be unable to recover its money.
As we discussed in Chapter 4, banks rely heavily on leverage, the use of 
borrowed funds for the purposes of investment. Leverage amplifies the positive 
and negative effect of asset returns on a bank’s financial position. A key number 
is the leverage ratio: the ratio of bank assets to bank capital. A leverage ratio of 
20, for example, means that for every $1 in capital put into the bank by its 
owners, the bank has borrowed (via deposits and other loans) $19, which then 
allows the bank to hold $20 in assets. In this case, if defaults cause the value 
of the bank’s assets to fall by 2 percent, then the bank’s capital will fall by 40 
percent. If the value of bank assets falls by more than 5 percent, then its assets 
will fall below its liabilities, and the bank will be insolvent. In this case, the 
bank will not have the resources to pay off all its depositors and other credi­
tors. Widespread insolvency within the financial system is the second element 
of a financial crisis.
In 2008 and 2009, many banks and other financial firms had in effect placed 
bets on real estate prices by holding mortgages backed by that real estate. 
They assumed that housing prices would keep rising or at least hold steady, 
so the collateral backing these loans would ensure their repayment. When 
housing prices fell, however, large numbers of homeowners found themselves 

590 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
underwater: the value of their homes was less than the amount they owed on 
their mortgages. When many homeowners stopped paying their mortgages, the 
banks could foreclose on the houses, but they could recover only a fraction 
of what they were owed. These defaults pushed several financial institutions 
toward bankruptcy. These institutions included major investment banks (Bear 
Stearns and Lehman Brothers), government-sponsored enterprises involved in 
the mortgage market (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), and a large insurance 
company (AIG).
3. Falling Confidence The third element of a financial crisis is a decline in 
confidence in financial institutions. While some deposits in banks are insured by 
government policies, not all are. As insolvencies mount, every financial institu­
tion becomes a possible candidate for the next bankruptcy. Individuals with 
uninsured deposits in those institutions pull out their money. Facing a rash of 
withdrawals, banks cut back on new lending and start selling off assets to increase 
their cash reserves.
As banks sell off some of their assets, they depress the market prices of 
these assets. Because buyers of risky assets are hard to find in the midst of a 
crisis, the assets’ prices can sometimes fall precipitously. Such a phenomenon 
is called a fire sale, similar to the reduced prices that a store might charge 
to get rid of merchandise quickly after a fire. These fire-sale prices, however, 
cause problems at other banks. Accountants and regulators may require these 
banks to revise their balance sheets and reduce the reported value of their 
own holdings of these assets. In this way, problems in one bank can spread 
to others.
In 2008 and 2009, the financial system was seized by great uncertainty about 
where the insolvencies would stop. The collapse of the giants Bear Stearns and 
Lehman Brothers made people wonder whether other large financial firms, such 
as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup, would meet a similar fate. The 
problem was exacerbated by the firms’ interdependence. Because they had many 
contracts with one another, the demise of any one of these institutions would 
undermine all the others. Moreover, because of the complexity of the arrange­
ments, depositors could not be sure how vulnerable these firms were. The lack 
of transparency fed the crisis of confidence.
4. Credit Crunch The fourth element of a financial crisis is a credit crunch. 
With many financial institutions facing difficulties, would-be borrowers have 
trouble getting loans, even if they have profitable investment projects. In essence, 
the financial system has trouble performing its normal function of directing 
the resources of savers into the hands of borrowers with the best investment 
opportunities.
The tightening of credit was clear during the 2008–2009 financial crisis. 
Not surprisingly, as banks realized that housing prices were falling and that 
previous lending standards had been too lax, they started raising standards 
for those applying for mortgages. They required larger down payments and 
scrutinized borrowers’ financial information more closely. But the reduction 
in lending did not affect only home-buyers. Small businesses found it harder 
to borrow to finance business expansions or to buy inventories. Consumers 

F Y I
A common type of indicator of perceived credit 
risk is the difference between two interest rates of 
similar maturity. For example, Financially Shaky 
Corporation might have to pay 7 percent for a one-
year loan, whereas Safe and Solid Corporation has 
to pay only 3 percent. That spread of 4 percentage 
points occurs because lenders are worried that 
Financially Shaky might default; as a result, they 
demand compensation for bearing that risk. If 
Financially Shaky gets some bad news about its 
financial position, the interest rate spread might 
rise to 5 or 6 percentage points or even higher. 
Thus, one way to monitor perceptions of credit 
risk is to follow interest rate spreads.
One particularly noteworthy interest rate spread 
is the so-called TED spread (and not just because it 
rhymes). The TED spread is the difference between 
three-month interbank loans and three-month 
Treasury bills. The T in TED stands for T-bills, and 
ED stands for EuroDollars (because, for regulatory 
reasons, these interbank loans typically take place 
The TED Spread
in London). The TED spread is measured in basis 
points, where a basis point is one one-hundredth 
of a percentage point (0.01 percent). Normally, 
the TED spread is about 20 to 40 basis points 
(0.2 to 0.4 percent). The spread is small because 
commercial banks, while a bit riskier than the gov­
ernment, are still very safe. Lenders do not require 
much extra compensation to accept the debt of 
banks rather than that of the government.
In times of financial crisis, however, confidence 
in the banking system falls. As a result, banks 
become reluctant to lend to one another, so the 
TED spread rises substantially. Figure 20-1 shows 
the TED spread before, during, and after the finan­
cial crisis of 2008–2009. As the crisis unfolded, the 
TED spread rose substantially, reaching 458 basis 
points in October 2008, shortly after the invest­
ment bank Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. 
The high level of the TED spread is a direct indica­
tor of how worried people were about the solvency 
of the banking system.
The TED Spread  The TED spread is the difference between the interest rate on 
three-month interbank loans and the interest rate on three-month Treasury bills. 
It rises when lending to banks is considered particularly risky.

found it harder to qualify for a credit card or car loan. Thus, banks responded 
to their own financial problems by becoming more cautious in all kinds 
of lending.
5. Recession The fifth element of a financial crisis is an economic downturn. 
With people unable to obtain consumer credit and firms unable to obtain 
financing for new investment projects, the overall demand for goods and services 
declines. Within the context of the IS–LM model, this event can be interpreted 
as a contractionary shift in the consumption and investment functions, which in 
turn leads to similar shifts in the IS curve and the aggregate demand curve. As a 
result, national income falls and unemployment rises.
Indeed, the recession following the financial crisis of 2008–2009 was a deep 
one. Unemployment rose from about 4.5 percent in early 2007 to 10 percent 
in late 2009. Worse yet, it lingered at a high level for a long time. Even after the 
recovery officially began in June 2009, growth in GDP was so meager that 
unemployment declined only slightly. The unemployment rate remained above 
8 percent until late 2012.
6. A Vicious Circle The sixth and final element of a financial crisis is a vicious 
circle. The economic downturn reduces the profitability of many companies 
and the value of many assets. The stock market declines. Some firms go bank­
rupt and default on their business loans. Many workers become unemployed 
and default on their personal loans. Thus, we return to steps 1 (asset-price 
busts) and 2 (financial institution insolvencies). The problems in the financial 
system and the economic downturn reinforce each other. Figure 20-2 illustrates 
the process.

In 2008 and 2009, the vicious circle was apparent. Some feared that the com­
bination of a weakening financial system and a weakening economy would cause 
the economy to spiral out of control, pushing the country into another Great 
Depression. Fortunately, that did not occur, in part because policymakers were 
intent on preventing it.
That brings us to the next question: Faced with a financial crisis, what can 
policymakers do?
CASE STUDY
Who Should Be Blamed for the Financial Crisis of 
2008–2009?
“Victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan.” This famous quotation 
from John F. Kennedy contains a perennial truth. Everyone is eager take credit 
for success, but no one wants to accept blame for failure. In the aftermath of 
the financial crisis of 2008–2009, many people wondered who was to blame. 
Not surprisingly, no one stepped forward to accept responsibility.
Nonetheless, economic observers have pointed their fingers at many possible 
culprits. The accused include the following:
n	 The Federal Reserve. The nation’s central bank kept interest rates low in 
the aftermath of the 2001 recession. This policy helped promote the 
recovery, but it also encouraged households to borrow and buy housing. 
Some economists believe by keeping interest rates too low for too long, 
the Fed contributed to the housing bubble that eventually led to the 
financial crisis.
n	 Home-buyers. Many people were reckless in borrowing more than 
they could afford to repay. Others bought houses as a gamble, hoping 
that housing prices would continue their rapid increase. When 
housing prices fell instead, many of these homeowners defaulted on 
their debts.
n	 Mortgage brokers. Many providers of home loans encouraged households 
to borrow excessively. Sometimes they pushed complicated mortgage 
products with payments that were low initially but exploded later. Some 
offered what were called NINJA loans (an acronym for “no income, 
no job or assets”) to households that should not have qualified for a 
mortgage. The brokers did not hold these risky loans, but instead sold 
them for a fee after they were issued.
n	 Investment banks. Many of these financial institutions packaged bundles of 
risky mortgages into mortgage-backed securities and then sold them to 
buyers (such as pension funds) that were not fully aware of the risks they 
were taking on.
n	 Rating agencies. The agencies that evaluated the riskiness of debt 
instruments gave high ratings to various mortgage-backed securities 

594 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
that later turned out to be highly risky. With the benefit of hindsight, it 
is clear that the models the agencies used to evaluate the risks were based 
on dubious assumptions.
n	 Regulators. Regulators of banks and other financial institutions are 
supposed to ensure that these firms do not take undue risks. Yet the 
regulators failed to appreciate that a substantial decline in housing prices 
might occur and that, if it did, it could have implications for the entire 
financial ­system.
n	 Government policymakers. For many years, political leaders have pursued 
policies to encourage homeownership. Such policies include the tax 
deductibility of mortgage interest and the establishment of Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored enterprises that promoted 
mortgage lending. Households with shaky finances, however, might have 
been better off renting.
In the end, it seems that each of these groups (and perhaps a few others as well) 
bear some of the blame. As The Economist magazine once put it, the problem was 
one of “layered irresponsibility.”
Finally, keep in mind that this financial crisis was not the first one in history. 
Such events, though fortunately rare, do occur from time to time. Rather 
than looking for a culprit to blame for this singular event, perhaps we should 
view speculative excess and its ramifications as an inherent feature of market 
economies. Policymakers can respond to financial crises as they happen, and they 
can take steps to reduce the likelihood and severity of such crises, but preventing 
them entirely may be too much to ask given our current knowledge.4 n
Policy Responses to a Crisis
Because financial crises are both severe and multifaceted, macroeconomic pol­
icymakers use various tools, often simultaneously, to try to control the damage. 
Here we discuss three broad categories of policy responses.
Conventional Monetary and Fiscal Policy  As we have seen, financial 
crises raise unemployment and lower incomes because they lead to a con­
traction in the aggregate demand for goods and services. Policymakers can 
mitigate these effects by using the tools of monetary and fiscal policy to 
expand aggregate demand. The central bank can increase the money supply 
and lower interest rates. The government can increase government spending 
and cut taxes. That is, a financial crisis can be seen as a shock to the aggregate 
demand curve, which can, to some degree, be offset by appropriate monetary 
and fiscal policy.
4To read more about the history of financial crises, see Charles P. Kindleberger and Robert 
Z. Aliber, Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises, 2nd ed. (New York: Palgrave 
Macmillan, 2011); and Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, This Time Is Different: Eight 
Centuries of Financial Folly (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2009).

C H A P T E R  2 0   The Financial System: Opportunities and Dangers  | 595
Policymakers did precisely this during the financial crisis of 2008–2009. 
To expand aggregate demand, the Federal Reserve cut its target for the federal 
funds rate from 5.25 percent in September 2007 to approximately zero in 
December 2008. It then stayed at that low level for the next six years. In February 
2008 President Bush signed into law a $168 billion dollar stimulus package, 
which funded tax rebates of $300 to $1,200 for every taxpayer. In 2009 President 
Obama signed into law a $787 billion stimulus, which included some tax reduc­
tions but also significant increases in government spending. All of these moves 
were aimed at propping up aggregate demand.
There are limits, however, to how much conventional monetary and fiscal 
policy can do. A central bank cannot cut its target for the interest rate below zero. 
(Recall the discussion of the liquidity trap in Chapter 12.) Fiscal policy is limited 
as well. Stimulus packages add to the government budget deficit, which is already 
enlarged because economic downturns automatically increase unemployment-
insurance payments and decrease tax revenue. Increases in government debt are a 
concern because they place a burden on future generations of taxpayers and call 
into question the government’s own solvency. In the aftermath of the financial 
crisis of 2008–2009, the federal government’s budget deficit reached levels not 
seen since World War II. As noted in Chapter 19, in August 2011, Standard & 
Poor’s responded to the fiscal imbalance by reducing its rating on U.S. govern­
ment debt below the top AAA level for the first time in the nation’s history, a 
decision that made additional fiscal stimulus more difficult.
The limits of monetary and fiscal policy during a financial crisis naturally lead 
policymakers to consider other, and sometimes unusual, alternatives. These other 
types of policy are of a fundamentally different nature. Rather than addressing 
the symptom of a financial crisis (a decline in aggregate demand), they aim to 
fix the financial system itself. If the normal process of financial intermediation 
can be restored, consumers and businesses will be able to borrow again, and the 
economy’s aggregate demand will recover. The economy can then return to full 
employment and rising incomes. The next two categories describe the major 
policies aimed directly at fixing the financial system.
Lender of Last Resort  When the public starts to lose confidence in a bank, 
they withdraw their deposits. In a system of fractional-reserve banking, large 
and sudden withdrawals can be a problem. Even if the bank is solvent (meaning 
that the value of its assets exceeds the value of its liabilities), it may have trouble 
satisfying all its depositors’ requests. Many of the bank’s assets are illiquid—that 
is, they cannot be easily sold and turned into cash. A business loan to a local 
restaurant, a car loan to a local family, and a student loan to your roommate, for 
example, may be valuable assets to the bank, but they cannot be easily used to 
satisfy depositors who are demanding their money back immediately. A situation 
in which a solvent bank has insufficient funds to satisfy its depositors’ withdrawals 
is called a liquidity crisis.
The central bank can remedy this problem by lending money directly to 
the bank. As we discussed in Chapter 4, the central bank can create money out 
of thin air by, in effect, printing it. (Or, more realistically in our electronic era, 
it creates a bookkeeping entry for itself that represents those monetary units.) 

596 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
It can then lend this newly created money to the bank experiencing greater-
than-normal withdrawals and accept the bank’s illiquid assets as collateral. When 
a central bank lends to a bank in the midst of a liquidity crisis, it is said to act as 
a lender of last resort.
The goal of such a policy is to allow a bank experiencing unusually high 
withdrawals to weather the storm of reduced confidence. Without such a loan, 
the bank might be forced to sell its illiquid assets at fire-sale prices. If such a fire 
sale were to occur, the value of the bank’s assets would decline, and a liquidity 
crisis could then threaten the bank’s solvency. By acting as a lender of last resort, 
the central bank stems the problem of bank insolvency and helps restore the 
public’s confidence in the banking system.
During 2008 and 2009, the Federal Reserve was extraordinarily active as a 
lender of last resort. As we discussed in Chapter 4, such activity traditionally takes 
place at the Fed’s discount window, through which the Fed lends to banks at its 
discount rate. During this crisis, however, the Fed set up a variety of new ways 
to lend to financial institutions. The financial institutions included were not only 
traditional commercial banks but also so-called shadow banks. Shadow banks 
are a diverse set of financial institutions that perform some functions similar to 
those of banks but do so outside the regulatory system that applies to traditional 
banking. Because the shadow banks were experiencing difficulties similar to those 
of commercial banks, the Fed was concerned about these institutions as well.
For example, from October 2008 to October 2009, the Fed was willing to make 
loans to money market mutual funds. Money market funds are not banks, and they 
do not offer insured deposits. But they are in some ways similar to banks: they 
take in deposits, invest the proceeds in short-term loans such as commercial paper 
issued by corporations, and assure depositors that they can obtain their deposits on 
demand with interest. In the midst of the financial crisis, depositors worried about 
the value of the assets the money market funds had purchased, so these funds were 
experiencing substantial withdrawals. The shrinking deposits in money market 
funds meant that there were fewer buyers of commercial paper, which in turn 
made it hard for firms that needed the proceeds from these loans to finance their 
continuing business operations. By its willingness to lend to money market funds, 
the Fed helped maintain this particular form of financial intermediation.
It is not crucial to learn the details of the many new lending facilities the Fed 
established during the crisis. Indeed, many of these programs were closed down 
as the economy started to recover because they were no longer needed. What 
is important to understand is that these programs, both old and new, have one 
purpose: to ensure that the financial system remains liquid. That is, as long as a 
financial institution had assets that could serve as reliable collateral, the Fed stood 
ready to lend it money so that its depositors could withdraw their funds.
Injections of Government Funds  The final category of policy responses 
to a financial crisis involves the government’s use of public funds to prop up the 
financial system.
The most direct action of this sort is a giveaway of public funds to those who 
have experienced losses. Deposit insurance is one example. Through the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the federal government promises to 

C H A P T E R  2 0   The Financial System: Opportunities and Dangers  | 597
make up for losses that a depositor experiences when a bank becomes insolvent. 
In 2008, the FDIC increased the maximum deposit it would cover from $100,000 
to $250,000 to reassure bank depositors that their funds were safe. (This increase 
in the maximum insured deposit was originally announced as temporary, but it 
was later made permanent.)
Giveaways of public funds can also occur on a more discretionary basis. For 
example, in 1984 a large bank called Continental Illinois found itself on the 
brink of insolvency. Because Continental Illinois had so many relationships with 
other banks, regulators feared that allowing it to fail would threaten the entire 
financial system. As a result, the FDIC promised to protect all of its depositors, 
not just those under the insurance limit. Eventually, it bought the bank from 
shareholders, added capital, and sold it to Bank of America. This policy operation 
cost taxpayers about $1 billion. It was during this episode that a congressman 
coined the phrase “too big to fail” to describe a firm so central to the financial 
system that policymakers would not allow it to enter bankruptcy.
Another way for the government to inject public funds is to make risky loans. 
Normally, when the Federal Reserve acts as lender of last resort, it does so by 
lending to a financial institution that can pledge good collateral. But if the gov­
ernment makes loans that might not be repaid, it is putting public funds at risk. 
If the borrowers do indeed default, taxpayers end up losing.
During the financial crisis of 2008–2009, the Fed engaged in a variety of 
risky lending. In March 2008, it made a $29 billion loan to JPMorgan Chase to 
facilitate its purchase of the nearly insolvent Bear Stearns. The only collateral the 
Fed received was Bear’s holdings of mortgage-backed securities, which were of 
dubious value. Similarly, in September 2008, the Fed loaned $85 billion to prop up 
the insurance giant AIG, which faced large losses from having insured the value 
of some mortgage-backed securities (through an agreement called a credit default 
swap). The Fed took these actions to prevent Bear Stearns and AIG from entering a 
long bankruptcy process, which could have further threatened the financial system.
A final way for the government to use public funds to address a financial crisis 
is for the government itself to inject capital into financial institutions. In this case, 
rather than being just a creditor, the government gets an ownership stake in the 
companies. The AIG loans in 2008 had significant elements of this: as part of the 
loan deal, the government got warrants (options to buy stock) and so eventually 
owned most of the company. (The shares were sold several years later.) Another 
example is the capital injections organized by the U.S. Treasury in 2008 and 
2009. As part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the government put 
hundreds of billions of dollars into various banks in exchange for equity shares 
in those banks. The goal of the program was to maintain the banks’ solvency and 
keep the process of financial intermediation intact.
Not surprisingly, the use of public funds to prop up the financial system, 
whether done with giveaways, risky lending, or capital injections, is controversial. 
Critics assert that it is unfair to taxpayers to use their resources to rescue finan­
cial market participants from their own mistakes. Moreover, the prospect of such 
financial bailouts may increase moral hazard because when people believe the 
government will cover their losses, they are more likely to take excessive risks. 
Financial risk taking becomes “heads I win, tails the taxpayers lose.” Advocates of 

598 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
these policies acknowledge these problems, but they point out that risky lending 
and capital injections could actually make money for taxpayers if the economy 
recovers. (Indeed, in December 2014, the federal government estimated that 
TARP ended up yielding a $15 billion profit.) More important, they believe 
that the costs of these policies are more than offset by the benefits of averting a 
deeper crisis and more severe economic downturn.
Policies to Prevent Crises
In addition to the question of how policymakers should respond when facing 
a financial crisis, there is another key policy debate: How should policymakers 
prevent future financial crises? Unfortunately, there is no easy answer. But here 
are five areas where policymakers have been considering their options and, in 
some cases, revising their policies.
Focusing on Shadow Banks  Traditional commercial banks are heavily 
regulated. One justification is that the government insures some of their deposits 
through the FDIC. Policymakers have long understood that deposit insurance 
produces a moral hazard problem. Because of deposit insurance, depositors have no 
incentive to monitor the riskiness of banks in which they make their deposits; as a 
result, bankers have an incentive to make excessively risky loans, knowing they will 
reap any gains while the deposit insurance system will cover any losses. In response 
to this moral hazard problem, the government regulates the risks that banks take.
Much of the crisis of 2008–2009, however, concerned not traditional banks 
but rather shadow banks—financial institutions that (like banks) are at the center 
of financial intermediation but (unlike banks) do not take in deposits insured 
by the FDIC. Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers, for example, were investment 
banks and, therefore, subject to less regulation. Similarly, hedge funds, insurance 
companies, and private equity firms can be considered shadow banks. These 
institutions do not suffer from the traditional problem of moral hazard arising 
from deposit insurance, but the risks they take may nonetheless be a concern of 
public policy because their failure can have macroeconomic ramifications.
Many policymakers have suggested that these shadow banks should be limited 
in how much risk they take. One way to do that would be to require that they 
hold more capital, which would in turn limit these firms’ ability to use leverage. 
Advocates of this idea say it would enhance financial stability. Critics say it would 
limit these institutions’ ability to do their job of financial intermediation.
Another issue concerns what happens when a shadow bank runs into trouble and 
nears insolvency. Legislation passed in 2010, the so-called Dodd-Frank Act, gave the 
FDIC resolution authority over shadow banks, much as it already had over traditional 
commercial banks. That is, the FDIC can now take over and close a nonbank finan­
cial institution if the institution is having trouble and the FDIC believes it could 
create systemic risk for the economy. Advocates of this new law believe it will allow 
a more orderly process when a shadow bank fails and thereby prevent a more gen­
eral loss of confidence in the financial system. Critics fear it will make bailouts of 
these institutions with taxpayer funds more common and exacerbate moral hazard.

C H A P T E R  2 0   The Financial System: Opportunities and Dangers  | 599
One intriguing idea for reforming the financial 
system is to introduce a new financial instrument 
called “contingent, convertible debt,” some­
times simply called CoCo bonds. The proposal 
works as follows: encourage banks, or perhaps 
a broader class of financial institutions, to sell 
some debt that can be converted into equity 
when these institutions are deemed to have insuf­
ficient capital.
This debt would be a form of preplanned 
recapitalization in the event of a financial crisis. 
Unlike the bank rescues in 2008–2009, how­
ever, the recapitalization would have the crucial 
advantage of being done with private, rather 
than taxpayer, funds. That is, when things go 
bad and a bank approaches insolvency, it would 
not need to turn to the government to replenish 
its capital. Nor would it need to convince pri­
vate investors to chip in more capital in times of 
financial stress. Instead, the bank would simply 
convert the CoCo bonds it had previously issued, 
wiping out one of its liabilities. The holders of 
the CoCo bonds would no longer be creditors 
of the bank; they would be given shares of stock 
and become part owners. Think of it as crisis 
insurance.
CoCo Bonds
Some bankers balk at this proposal because 
it would raise the cost of doing business. The 
buyers of these CoCo bonds would need to be 
compensated for providing this insurance. The 
compensation would take the form of a higher 
interest rate than would be earned on standard 
bonds without the conversion feature.
But this contingent, convertible debt would 
make it easier for the financial system to weather 
a future crisis. Moreover, it would give bankers 
an incentive to limit risk by, say, reducing lever­
age and maintaining strict lending standards. 
The safer these financial institutions are, the 
less likely the contingency would be triggered 
and the less they would need to pay to issue this 
debt. By inducing bankers to be more prudent, 
this reform could reduce the likelihood of finan­
cial crises.
CoCo bonds are still a relatively new idea. 
In 2011, the European Banking Authority estab­
lished guidelines for the issuance of these bonds. 
The Economist magazine reports that issuance of 
these bonds rose from about zero in 2010 to 
$64 billion in 2014. How successful this finan­
cial innovation will be at averting future crises 
remains to be seen.
F Y I
Restricting Size  The financial crisis of 2008–2009 centered on a few very 
large financial institutions. Some economists have suggested that the problem 
would have been averted, or at least would have been less severe, if the financial 
system had been less concentrated. When a small institution fails, bankruptcy law 
can take over as it usually does, adjudicating the claims of the various stakehold­
ers, without resulting in economy-wide problems. These economists argue that 
if a financial institution is too big to fail, it is too big.
Various ideas have been proposed to limit the size of financial firms. One 
would be to restrict mergers among banks. (Over the past half century, the 
banking industry has become vastly more concentrated, largely through bank 
mergers.) Another idea is to impose higher capital requirements on larger banks. 
Advocates of these ideas say that a financial system with smaller firms would 
be more stable. Critics say that such a policy would prevent banks from taking 
advantage of economies of scale and that the higher costs would eventually be 
passed on to the banks’ customers.

600 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
Reducing Excessive Risk Taking The financial firms that failed during the 
financial crisis of 2008–2009 did so because they took risks that resulted in 
the loss of large sums of money. Some observers believe that one way to reduce 
the risk of future crises is to limit excessive risk taking. Yet because risk taking is 
at the heart of what many financial institutions do, there is no easy way to draw 
the line between appropriate and excessive risks.
Nonetheless, the Dodd-Frank Act included several provisions aimed at limit­
ing risk taking. Perhaps the best known is the so-called Volcker rule, named after 
Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who first proposed it. Under 
the Volcker rule, commercial banks are restricted from making certain kinds of 
speculative investments. Advocates say the rule will help protect banks. Critics say 
that by restricting the banks’ trading activities, it will make the market for those 
speculative financial instruments less liquid.
Making Regulation Work Better The financial system is diverse, with many 
different types of firms performing various functions and having developed at 
different stages of history. As a result, the regulatory apparatus overseeing these 
firms is highly fragmented. The Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency, and the FDIC all regulate commercial banks. The Securities and 
Exchange Commission regulates investment banks and mutual funds. Individual 
state agencies regulate insurance companies.
After the financial crisis of 2008–2009, policymakers tried to improve the system 
of regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Financial Services Oversight 
Council, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, to coordinate the various regula­
tory agencies. It also created a new Office of Credit Ratings to oversee the private 
credit rating agencies, which were blamed for failing to anticipate the great risk 
in many mortgage-backed securities. The law also established a new Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau, with the goal of ensuring fairness and transparency in 
how financial firms market their products to consumers. Because financial crises are 
infrequent events, often occurring many decades apart, it will take a long time to 
tell whether this new regulatory structure works better than the old one.
Taking a Macro View of Regulation  Policymakers have increasingly taken 
the view that the regulation of financial institutions requires more of a macroeco­
nomic perspective. Traditionally, financial regulation has been microprudential: 
its goal has been to reduce the risk of distress in individual financial institutions, 
thereby protecting the depositors and other stakeholders in those institutions. 
Today, financial regulation is also macroprudential: its goal is also to reduce 
the risk of system-wide distress, thereby protecting the overall economy against 
declines in production and employment. Microprudential regulation takes a 
bottom-up approach by focusing on individual institutions and assessing the 
risks that each of them faces. By contrast, macroprudential regulation takes a 
top-down approach by focusing on the big picture and assessing the risks that 
can affect many financial institutions at the same time.
For example, macroprudential regulation could have addressed the boom and 
bust in the housing market that were the catalysts for the 2008–2009 financial crisis. 
Advocates of such regulation argue that as house prices increased, policymakers 
should have required larger down payments when homebuyers ­purchased a house 

C H A P T E R  2 0   The Financial System: Opportunities and Dangers  | 601
with a mortgage. This policy might have slowed the speculative bubble in house 
prices, and it would have led to fewer mortgage defaults when house prices later 
declined. Fewer mortgage defaults, in turn, would have helped protect many 
financial institutions that had acquired stakes in various housing-related securities. 
Critics of such a policy question whether government regulators are sufficiently 
knowledgeable and adept to identify and remedy economy-wide risks. They 
worry that attempts to do so would add to the regulatory burden; an increase in 
required down payments, for instance, makes it harder for less wealthy families to 
buy their own homes.
Without doubt, in light of what was learned during and after the financial 
crisis, financial regulators will pay renewed attention to macroeconomic stability 
as one of their goals. In this sense, macroprudential regulation takes its place 
alongside the traditional tools of monetary and fiscal policy. Yet how active 
policymakers should be in using this tool remains open to debate.5

Policy Tools,” IMF Working Paper, December 2014.
The European Sovereign Debt Crisis
As the United States was beginning to recover from its financial crisis of 
2008–2009, another crisis erupted in the Eurozone, the part of Europe that uses 
the euro as a common currency. The problem stemmed from debt issued by 
governments, called sovereign debt. For many years, banks and bank regulators had 
treated such debt as risk-free. The central governments of Europe, they presumed, 
would always honor their obligations. Because of this belief, these bonds paid a 
lower interest rate and commanded a higher price than they would have if they 
had been perceived as less reliable credit risks.
In 2010, however, financial market participants started to doubt that this opti­
mism about European governments was warranted. The problem began with 
Greece. In 2010, Greek debt (net financial liabilities) had increased to 116 per­
cent of its GDP, compared to a European average of 58 percent. Moreover, 
it became apparent that for years Greece had been misreporting the state of 
its finances and that it had no plan to rein in its soaring debts. In April 2010, 
Standard & Poor’s reduced the rating on Greek debt to junk status, indicating 
an especially poor credit risk. Because many feared that default was likely, the 
prices of Greek debt fell, and the interest rate that Greece had to pay on new 
borrowing rose markedly. By the summer of 2011, the interest rate on Greek 
debt was 26 percent. In November of that year, it rose to over 100 percent.
European policymakers were concerned that problems in Greece could 
have repercussions throughout Europe. Many European banks held Greek debt 
among their assets. As the value of Greek debt fell, the banks were pushed toward 
insolvency. A Greek default could send many banks over the edge, leading to 
a broader crisis of confidence. As a result, policymakers in healthier European

of Economic Perspectives, 26(3), Summer 2012: 49–68.
economies, such as Germany and France, helped arrange continuing loans to 
Greece to prevent an immediate default. Some of these loans were from the 
European Central Bank, which controls monetary policy in the Eurozone.
This policy move was not popular. Voters in Germany and France won­
dered why their tax dollars should help rescue the Greeks from their own fiscal 
profligacy. Voters in Greece, meanwhile, were also unhappy because these loans 
came with the conditions that Greece drastically cut government spending and 
raise taxes. These austerity measures led to rioting in Greek streets.
Making matters worse was that Greece was not the only country with such 
problems. If Greece was allowed to default, rather than being bailed out by its 
richer neighbors, some feared that Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and Italy might be 
close behind. A widespread decline in the value of the sovereign debt of all these 
nations would surely put serious strains on the European banking system. And 
since the world’s banking systems are highly interconnected, it would put strains 
on the rest of the world as well.
The policy actions in response to this crisis were successful in one sense: 
despite predictions that Greece and other problematic countries might stop 
using the euro as their currency, the monetary union was maintained. But the 
economic pain resulting from the crisis was nonetheless substantial and long-
lasting. Even by late 2014, the unemployment rate was 25 percent in Greece, 
24 percent in Spain, and 14 percent in Portugal (but only 5 percent in Germany, 
the most populous Eurozone nation). As a standard Phillips curve predicts, the 
economic slack pulled inflation in Europe well below the target rate of 2 per­
cent. Indeed, by the end of 2014, inflation was close to zero, and many observers 
feared that Europe might be heading for deflation. To expand aggregate demand 
and stimulate the economy, the European Central Bank cut the interest rate to 
about zero as the crisis unfolded. In addition, in early 2015, the ECB announced 
a program of quantitative easing, under which it would buy large quantities of 
government bonds.
As this book was going to press, the end of the story was yet to be written. 
The Greek government was still having problems servicing its debt, and Greek 
voters were rebelling against the fiscal austerity and high unemployment they 
were experiencing. European policymakers were unsure about the best way to 
get the Eurozone back on track.6 n

Conclusion
Throughout history, financial crises have been a major source of economic fluc­
tuations and a main driver of economic policy. In 1873 Walter Bagehot published 
a celebrated book called Lombard Street about how the Bank of England should 
manage a financial crisis. His recommendation that it should act as a lender of last

resort has over time become the conventional wisdom. In 1913, in the aftermath 
of the banking panic of 1907, Congress passed the act establishing the Federal 
Reserve. Congress wanted the new central bank to oversee the banking system 
in order to ensure greater financial and macroeconomic stability.
The Fed has not always been successful in accomplishing this goal. To this day, 
many economists believe that the Great Depression was so severe because the 
Fed failed to follow Bagehot’s advice and act as lender of last resort. If it had acted 
more aggressively, the crisis of confidence in the banks and the resulting collapse 
in the money supply and aggregate demand might have been averted. Mindful 
of this history, the Fed played a much more active role in trying to mitigate the 
impact of the financial crisis of 2008–2009.
Following a crisis, it is easy to lament the problems caused by the finan­
cial system, but we should not lose sight of the great benefits that the system 
brings. The financial system gives savers the ability to earn the best possible rate 
of return at the lowest possible risk. It gives entrepreneurs the ability to fund 
their ideas for new business ventures. By bringing together those who want to 
save and those who want to invest, the financial system promotes economic 
growth and overall prosperity.
Summary
	1.	A central purpose of the financial system is to direct the resources of 
savers into the hands of borrowers who have investment projects to 
finance. Sometimes this task is done directly through the stock and bond 
markets. Sometimes it is done indirectly through financial intermediaries 
such as banks.
	2.	Another purpose of the financial system is to allocate risk among market 
participants. The financial system allows individuals to reduce the risk they 
face through diversification.
	3.	Financial arrangements are rife with asymmetric information. Because 
entrepreneurs know more about the inherent quality of their ventures than 
do those providing the financing, there is a problem of adverse selection. 
Because entrepreneurs know more about the decisions they make and 
actions they take, there is a problem of moral hazard. Financial institutions 
such as banks mitigate (but do not completely solve) the problems that arise 
from asymmetric information.
	4.	Because the accumulation and allocation of capital are a source of 
economic growth, a well-functioning financial system is a key element 
of long-run economic prosperity.
	5.	Crises in the financial system begin when a decline in asset prices, often 
after a speculative bubble, causes insolvency in some highly leveraged 
financial institutions. These insolvencies then lead to falling confidence 
in the overall system, which in turn causes depositors to withdraw funds

and induces banks to reduce lending. The ensuing credit crunch reduces 
aggregate demand and leads to a recession, which, in a vicious circle, 
exacerbates the problem of rising insolvencies and falling confidence.
	6.	Policymakers can respond to a financial crisis in three ways. First, they 
can use conventional monetary and fiscal policy to expand aggregate 
demand. Second, the central bank can provide liquidity by acting as a 
lender of last resort. Third, policymakers can use public funds to prop 
up the financial system.
	7.	Preventing financial crises is not easy, but policymakers have tried to reduce 
the likelihood of future crises by focusing more on regulating shadow 
banks, by restricting the size of financial firms, by trying to limit excessive 
risk taking, by reforming the regulatory agencies that oversee the financial 
system, and by taking a more macroeconomic perspective when regulating 
financial institutions.

T
he first chapter of this book states that the purpose of macroeconomics 
is to understand economic events and to improve economic policy. Now 
that we have developed and used many of the most important models 
in the macroeconomist’s toolbox, we can assess whether macroeconomists have 
achieved these goals.
Any fair assessment of macroeconomics today must admit that the science is 
incomplete. There are some principles that almost all macroeconomists accept 
and on which we can rely when trying to analyze events or formulate policies. 
Yet there are also many questions about the economy that remain open to debate. 
In this last chapter, we briefly review the central lessons of macroeconomics, and 
we discuss the most pressing unresolved questions.
The Four Most Important Lessons 
of Macroeconomics
We begin with four lessons that have recurred throughout this book and that 
most economists today would endorse. Each lesson tells us how policy can influ­
ence a key economic variable—output, inflation, or unemployment—either in 
the long run or in the short run.
What We Know, What We Don’t
If all economists were laid end to end, they would not reach a conclusion.
—George Bernard Shaw
The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled conclusions 
­immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, 
an apparatus of the mind, which helps its possessor to draw correct 
conclusions.
—John Maynard Keynes

Lesson 1: In the long run, a country’s capacity to 
produce goods and services determines the standard 
of living of its citizens.
Of all the measures of economic performance introduced in Chapter 2 and used 
throughout this book, the one that best measures economic well-being is GDP. 
Real GDP measures the economy’s total output of goods and services and, there­
fore, a country’s ability to satisfy the needs and desires of its citizens. Nations with 
higher GDP per person have more of almost everything—bigger homes, more 
cars, higher literacy, better health care, longer life expectancy, and more Internet 
connections. Perhaps the most important question in macroeconomics is what 
determines the level and the growth of GDP.
The models in Chapters 3, 8, and 9 identify the long-run determinants of 
GDP. In the long run, GDP depends on the factors of production—capital and 
labor—and on the technology used to turn capital and labor into output. GDP 
grows when the factors of production increase or when the economy becomes 
better at turning these inputs into an output of goods and services.
This lesson has an obvious but important corollary: public policy can raise 
GDP in the long run only by improving the productive capability of the 
economy. There are many ways in which policymakers can attempt to do this. 
Policies that raise national saving—either through higher public saving or higher 
private saving—eventually lead to a larger capital stock. Policies that raise the 
efficiency of labor—such as those that improve education or promote techno­
logical progress—lead to a more productive use of capital and labor. Policies that 
improve a nation’s institutions—such as crackdowns on official corruption—lead 
to both greater capital accumulation and a more efficient use of the economy’s 
resources. All these policies increase the economy’s output of goods and services 
and, thereby, improve the standard of living. It is less clear, however, which of 
these policies is the best way to raise an economy’s productive capability.
Lesson 2: In the short run, aggregate demand 
influences the amount of goods and services that 
a country produces.
Although the economy’s ability to supply goods and services is the sole deter­
minant of GDP in the long run, in the short run GDP depends also on the 
aggregate demand for goods and services. Aggregate demand is of key impor­
tance because prices are sticky in the short run. The IS–LM model developed 
in ­Chapters 11 and 12 shows what causes changes in aggregate demand and, 
therefore, short-run fluctuations in GDP.
Because aggregate demand influences output in the short run, all the variables 
that affect aggregate demand can influence economic fluctuations. Monetary 
policy, fiscal policy, and shocks to the money and goods markets are often respon­
sible for year-to-year changes in output and employment. Because changes in 
aggregate demand are crucial to short-run fluctuations, policymakers monitor 
the economy closely. Before making any change in monetary or fiscal policy, they 
want to know whether the economy is booming or heading into a recession.

E P I L O G U E   What We Know, What We Don’t  | 609
Lesson 3: In the long run, the rate of money growth 
determines the rate of inflation, but it does not affect 
the rate of unemployment.
In addition to GDP, inflation and unemployment are among the most closely 
watched measures of economic performance. Chapter 2 discussed how these two 
variables are measured, and subsequent chapters developed models to explain 
how they are determined.
The long-run analysis of Chapter 5 stresses that growth in the money supply 
is the ultimate determinant of inflation. That is, in the long run, a currency loses 
real value over time if and only if the central bank prints more and more of it. 
This lesson can explain the decade-to-decade variation in the inflation rate that 
we have observed in the United States, as well as the 
far more dramatic hyperinflations that various countries 
have experienced from time to time.
We have also seen many of the long-run effects of high 
money growth and high inflation. In Chapter 5 we saw 
that, according to the Fisher effect, high inflation raises 
the nominal interest rate (so that the real interest rate 
remains unaffected). In Chapter 6 we saw that high infla­
tion leads to a depreciation of the currency in the market 
for foreign exchange.
The long-run determinants of unemployment are very 
different. According to the classical dichotomy—the irrel­
evance of nominal variables in the determination of real 
variables—growth in the money supply does not affect 
unemployment in the long run. As we saw in Chapter 7, 
the natural rate of unemployment is determined by the 
rates of job separation and job finding, which in turn are 
determined by the process of job search and by the rigid­
ity of the real wage.
Thus, we concluded that persistent inflation and persistent unemployment 
are unrelated problems. To combat inflation in the long run, policymakers must 
reduce the growth in the money supply. To combat unemployment, they must 
alter the structure of labor markets. In the long run, there is no tradeoff between 
inflation and unemployment.
Lesson 4: In the short run, policymakers who control 
monetary and fiscal policy face a tradeoff between 
inflation and unemployment.
Although inflation and unemployment are not related in the long run, in the 
short run there is a tradeoff between these two variables, which is illustrated by 
the short-run Phillips curve. As we discussed in Chapter 14, policymakers can use 
monetary and fiscal policies to expand aggregate demand, which lowers unem­
ployment and raises inflation. Or they can use these policies to contract aggregate 
demand, which raises unemployment and lowers inflation.
Warren Miller The New Yorker Collection/The Cartoon Bank
“And please let Janet Yellen accept the things 
she cannot change, give her the courage to 
change the things she can, and the wisdom to 
know the difference.”

610 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
Policymakers face a fixed tradeoff between inflation and unemployment only 
in the short run. Over time, the short-run Phillips curve shifts for two reasons. 
First, supply shocks, such as changes in the price of oil, change the short-run 
tradeoff; an adverse supply shock offers policymakers the difficult choice of 
­higher inflation or higher unemployment. Second, when people change their 
expectations of inflation, the short-run tradeoff between inflation and unem­
ployment changes. The adjustment of expectations ensures that the tradeoff exists 
only in the short run. That is, only in the short run does unemployment deviate 
from its natural rate, and only in the short run does monetary policy have real 
effects. In the long run, the classical model of Chapters 3 through 9 describes 
the world.
The Four Most Important Unresolved 
Questions of Macroeconomics
So far, we have been discussing some of the broad lessons about which most 
economists would agree. We now turn to four questions about which there is 
continuing debate. Some of the disagreements concern the validity of alternative 
economic theories; others concern how economic theory should be applied to 
economic policy.
Question 1: How should policymakers try to promote 
growth in the economy’s natural level of output?
The economy’s natural level of output depends on the amount of capital, the 
amount of labor, and the level of technology. Any policy designed to raise output 
in the long run must aim to increase the amount of capital, improve the use of 
labor, or enhance the available technology. There is, however, no simple and cost­
less way to achieve these goals.
The Solow growth model of Chapters 8 and 9 shows that increasing the 
amount of capital requires raising the economy’s rate of saving and investment. 
Therefore, many economists advocate policies to increase national saving. Yet 
the Solow model also shows that raising the capital stock requires a period of 
reduced consumption for current generations. Some argue that policymakers 
should not encourage current generations to make this sacrifice because tech­
nological progress will ensure that future generations are better off than current 
generations. (One waggish economist asked, “What has posterity ever done 
for me?”) Even those who advocate increased saving and investment disagree 
about how to encourage additional saving and whether the investment should 
be in privately owned plants and equipment or in public infrastructure, such as 
roads and schools.
To improve the economy’s use of its labor force, most policymakers would 
like to lower the natural rate of unemployment. As we discussed in Chapter 7, 

E P I L O G U E   What We Know, What We Don’t  | 611
the large differences in unemployment that we observe across countries, and 
the large changes in unemployment we observe over time within countries, 
suggest that the natural rate is not an immutable constant but depends on a 
nation’s policies and institutions. Yet reducing unemployment is a task fraught 
with perils. The natural rate of unemployment could likely be reduced by 
decreasing unemployment-insurance benefits (and thus increasing the search 
effort of the unemployed) or by decreasing the minimum wage (and thus 
bringing wages closer to equilibrium levels). Yet these policies would also hurt 
some of those members of society most in need and, therefore, do not com­
mand a consensus among economists. This issue has been particularly salient 
in recent years. In the aftermath of the financial crisis and deep recession of 
2008–2009, the U.S. Congress temporarily extended eligibility for unemploy­
ment insurance to an unprecedented 99 weeks, leading to a debate among 
economists about whether this was an appropriate response to extraordinary 
circumstances or an overreaction.
In many countries, the natural level of output is depressed by a lack of 
institutions that people in developed nations take for granted. U.S. citizens 
today do not worry about revolutions, coups, or civil wars. For the most part, 
they trust the police and the court system to respect the laws, maintain order, 
protect property rights, and enforce private contracts. In nations without such 
institutions, however, people face the wrong incentives: if creating something 
of economic value is a less reliable path to riches than is stealing from a neigh­
bor, an economy is unlikely to prosper. All economists agree that setting up 
the right institutions is a prerequisite for increasing growth in the world’s poor 
nations, but changing a nation’s institutions requires overcoming some difficult 
political hurdles.
Increasing the rate of technological progress is, according to some econo­
mists, the most important objective for public policy. The Solow growth model 
shows that persistent growth in living standards requires continuing tech­
nological progress. Despite much work on the new theories of endogenous 
growth, which highlight the societal decisions that determine technological 
progress, economists cannot offer a reliable recipe to ensure rapid advances 
in technology. They continue to debate the extent to which the government 
should take an active role in promoting the development and spread of par­
ticular technologies.
Question 2: Should policymakers try to stabilize the 
economy? If so, how?
The model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand developed in ­Chapters 10 
through 15 shows how various shocks to the economy cause economic fluc­
tuations and how monetary and fiscal policy can influence these fluctuations. 
Some economists believe that policymakers should use this analysis in an attempt 
to stabilize the economy. They believe that monetary and fiscal policy should 
try to offset shocks in order to keep output and employment close to their 
natural levels.

612 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
Yet, as we discussed in Chapter 18, others are skeptical about our ability to sta­
bilize the economy. These economists cite the long and variable lags inherent in 
economic policymaking, the poor record of economic forecasting, and our still-
limited understanding of how the economy works. They conclude that the best 
policy is a passive one. In addition, many economists believe that all too often 
policymakers are politically opportunistic or tempted to follow time-inconsistent 
policies. They conclude that policymakers should not have discretion over mon­
etary and fiscal policy but should be committed to following a fixed policy rule. 
Or, at the very least, their discretion should be somewhat constrained, as is the 
case when central banks adopt a policy of inflation targeting.
There is also debate among economists about which macroeconomic tools 
are best suited for purposes of economic stabilization. Typically, monetary policy 
is the front line of defense against the business cycle. In the deep downturn of 
2008–2009, however, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to their lower bound 
of zero, and the focus of many macroeconomic discussions turned to fiscal policy. 
Among economists, there was widespread disagreement about the extent to 
which fiscal policy should be used to stimulate the economy in downturns and 
whether tax cuts or spending increases are the preferred policy tool.
A related question is whether the benefits of economic stabilization—­
assuming stabilization could be achieved—would be large or small. Without any 
change in the natural rate of unemployment, stabilization policy can only reduce 
the magnitude of fluctuations around the natural rate. Thus, successful stabiliza­
tion policy would eliminate booms as well as recessions. Some economists have 
suggested that the average gain from stabilization would be small.
Finally, in the aftermath of the financial crisis and recession of 2008–2009, 
economists questioned whether the economy could be stabilized by avoiding 
such shocks in the future. As we discussed in Chapter 20, problems in the finan­
cial system can lead to problems throughout the economy. Indeed, throughout 
history, financial crises have led to some of the deepest economic downturns. 
Unfortunately, it is not clear how best to prevent such crises.
One point of debate centers on the response of monetary policy to specu­
lative bubbles in asset prices. Some economists argue that central banks should 
monitor these markets and try to prevent speculative bubbles from arising in 
the first place. This might mean raising interest rates earlier than otherwise to 
deflate bubbles as they begin to form. Other economists believe that mon­
etary policymakers are no better than market participants at telling when a 
rise in asset prices reflects an irrational speculative bubble rather than a ratio­
nal evaluation of changing fundamentals. Moreover, they argue, the tools of 
monetary policy are too crude to prick bubbles, and trying to do so could 
distract central banks from their primary objectives of stable employment and 
low inflation.
Another point of debate concerns regulation. Some economists argue that 
more vigilant regulation of financial institutions can limit the scope of reckless 
risk-taking and thereby prevent financial crises. Others believe that financial 
regulation is hard to do well, easy to circumvent, and liable to give the public a 
false hope that the financial system is safer than it really is. In addition, they argue 

E P I L O G U E   What We Know, What We Don’t  | 613
that excessive regulation could prevent the financial system from efficiently per­
forming its crucial job of allocating capital and risk, which in turn could impede 
long-run economic growth.
Question 3: How costly is inflation, and how costly is 
reducing inflation?
Whenever prices are rising, policymakers confront the question of whether to 
pursue policies to reduce the rate of inflation. To make this decision, they must 
compare the cost of allowing inflation to continue at its current rate to the cost 
of reducing inflation. Yet economists cannot offer accurate estimates of either of 
these two costs.
The cost of inflation is a topic on which economists and laymen often dis­
agree. When inflation reached 10 percent per year in the late 1970s, opinion 
polls showed that the public viewed inflation as a major economic problem. Yet, 
as we discussed in Chapter 5, when economists try to identify the social costs 
of inflation, they can point only to shoeleather costs, menu costs, the costs of 
a nonindexed tax system, and so on. These costs become large when countries 
experience hyperinflation, but they seem relatively minor at the moderate rates 
of inflation experienced in most major economies. Some economists believe that 
the public confuses inflation with other economic problems that coincide with 
inflation. For example, as growth in productivity and real wages slowed in the 
1970s, some laymen might have viewed inflation as the cause of the slowdown 
in real wages. Yet it is also possible that economists are mistaken: perhaps inflation 
is in fact very costly, and we have yet to figure out why.
It is also possible that some amount of inflation is desirable. If workers are 
highly resistant to cuts in nominal wages, then a positive amount of inflation 
makes it easier for real wages to fall when necessary to equilibrate the supply 
and demand for labor. That is, inflation may “grease the wheels” of labor markets. 
In addition, higher inflation would raise the nominal interest rate through the 
Fisher effect. A higher nominal interest rate gives the central bank more room 
to cut interest rates when necessary to stimulate the economy. In other words, 
higher inflation would make it less likely that the central bank would hit the zero 
lower bound on nominal interest rates, reducing the risk of the economy falling 
in a liquidity trap. Some economists have used these arguments to suggest that 
the Federal Reserve aim for 4 percent inflation, rather than the 2 percent rate 
that is the Fed’s current inflation target.
The cost of reducing inflation is a topic on which economists often dis­
agree among themselves. As we discussed in Chapter 14, the standard view—as 
described by the short-run Phillips curve—is that reducing inflation requires a 
period of low output and high unemployment. According to this view, the cost 
of reducing inflation is measured by the sacrifice ratio, which is the number of 
percentage points of a year’s GDP that must be forgone to reduce inflation by 
1 percentage point. But some economists think that the cost of reducing infla­
tion can be much smaller than standard estimates of the sacrifice ratio indicate. 

614 |  P A R T  V I   Topics in Macroeconomic Policy
According to the rational-expectations approach discussed in Chapter 14, if a 
disinflationary policy is announced in advance and is credible, people will adjust 
their expectations quickly, so the disinflation need not cause a recession.
Other economists believe that the cost of reducing inflation is much larger 
than standard estimates of the sacrifice ratio indicate. The theories of hysteresis 
discussed in Chapter 14 suggest that a recession caused by disinflationary policy 
could raise the natural rate of unemployment. If so, the cost of reducing infla­
tion is not merely a temporary recession but a persistently higher level of 
unemployment.
Because the costs of inflation and disinflation remain open to debate, econo­
mists sometimes offer conflicting advice to policymakers. Perhaps with further 
research, we can reach a consensus on the benefits of low inflation and the best 
way to achieve it.
Question 4: How big a problem are government 
budget deficits?
Government debt is a perennial topic of debate among policymakers, and it 
has been particularly heightened in recent years. During the deep recession of 
2008–2009, the U.S. budget deficit increased to $1.4 trillion, or about 10 per­
cent of GDP, a level not seen since World War II. Even more troubling is the 
long-term fiscal picture. Many economists believe that the budget deficit will be 
hard to control as the large baby-boom generation reaches retirement age and 
starts drawing on the Social Security and Medicare benefits that the government 
provides to the elderly.
Most models in this book, and most economists, take the traditional view of 
government debt. According to this view, when the government runs a budget 
deficit and issues debt, it reduces national saving, which in turn leads to lower 
investment and a trade deficit. In the long run, it leads to a smaller steady-state 
capital stock and a larger foreign debt. Those who hold the traditional view con­
clude that government debt places a burden on future generations.
Yet, as we discussed in Chapter 19, some economists are skeptical of this assess­
ment. Advocates of the Ricardian view of government debt stress that a budget 
deficit merely represents a substitution of future taxes for current taxes. As long 
as consumers are forward-looking, as the theories of consumption presented in 
Chapter 16 assume, they will save today to meet their or their children’s future 
tax liability. These economists believe that the level of government debt has only 
a minor effect on the economy. They believe that the government’s spending 
decisions matter, but whether that spending is financed by taxation or by selling 
government bonds is of secondary importance.
Still other economists believe that standard measures of fiscal policy are too 
flawed to be of much use. Although the government’s choices regarding taxes 
and spending have great influence on the welfare of different generations, many 
of these choices are not reflected in the size of the government debt. The level 
of Social Security benefits and taxes, for instance, determines the welfare of the 
elder beneficiaries versus that of the working-age taxpayers, but measures of the 

E P I L O G U E   What We Know, What We Don’t  | 615
budget deficit do not reflect this policy choice. According to some economists, 
we should stop focusing on the government’s current budget deficit and concen­
trate instead on the longer-term generational impacts of fiscal policy.
Recent events have focused renewed attention on the possibility of govern­
ment default. In the eighteenth century, Alexander Hamilton argued success­
fully that the U.S. federal government should always honor its debts. But in 
recent years Greece and many other European nations were struggling to do 
just that. In August 2011, Standard & Poor’s reduced its credit rating on U.S. 
bonds below the top AAA level, suggesting that Hamilton’s rule might someday 
be violated even in the United States. As the U.S. political system struggles with 
continuing budget deficits, economists as well as the general public are divided 
about what should be done to put the government back on a sustainable path. 
Reasonable people disagree about how much of the fiscal adjustment should 
come from higher tax revenue and how much should come from reduced 
government spending.
Conclusion
Economists and policymakers must deal with ambiguity. The current state of 
macroeconomics offers many insights, but it also leaves many questions open. 
The challenge for economists is to find answers to these questions and to expand 
our knowledge. The challenge for policymakers is to use the knowledge we now 
have to improve economic performance. Both challenges are formidable, but 
neither is insuperable.

Accommodating policy: A policy that yields 
to the effect of a shock and thereby prevents 
the shock from being disruptive; for example, a 
policy that raises aggregate demand in response 
to an adverse supply shock, sustaining the effect 
of the shock on prices and keeping output at its 
natural level.
Accounting profit: The amount of revenue 
remaining for the owners of a firm after all the fac­
tors of production except capital have been com­
pensated. (Cf. economic profit, profit.)
Acyclical: Moving in no consistent direction over 
the business cycle. (Cf. countercyclical, procyclical.)
Adaptive expectations: An approach that assumes 
that people form their expectation of a variable 
based on recently observed values of the variable. 
(Cf. rational expectations.)
Adverse selection: An unfavorable sorting of 
individuals by their own choices; for example, in 
efficiency-wage theory, when a wage cut induces 
good workers to quit and bad workers to remain 
with the firm.
Aggregate: Total for the whole economy.
Aggregate demand: The negative relation­
