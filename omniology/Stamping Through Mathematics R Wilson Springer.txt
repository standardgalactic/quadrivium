Preface
T
here are many hundreds of postage stamps relating to mathematics, rang-
ing from the earliest forms of counting to the modern computer age. In
these pages you will meet many of the mathematicians who contributed to
this story—influential figures such as Pythagoras, Archimedes, Newton and
Einstein—and will learn about those areas, such as navigation, astronomy
and art, whose study aided this development. Each topic appears on a dou-
ble page, with a commentary on the left and enlarged stamp images on the
right. A list of the featured stamps appears at the end of the book.
This book is written for anyone interested in mathematics and its applications.
Although parts of it assume some knowledge of school or college level mathe-
matics, I hope that much of it will be of interest to readers without this back-
ground. In particular, I hope that it will also attract a philatelic readership.
This is not a history of mathematics book in the conventional sense of the
word. Several important mathematicians or topics are omitted, due to the
absence of suitable stamps featuring them, whereas others may have
assumed undue prominence because of the abundance of attractive images.
Where appropriate I have felt free to let the stamps dictate the story.
Postage stamps are an attractive vehicle for presenting mathematics and its
development. For some years I have successfully presented an illustrated
lecture entitled Stamping through mathematics to school and college groups
and to mathematical clubs and societies, and I am grateful to many people
over the years for the useful comments they have made.
Since 1984 I have also contributed a regular ‘Stamp Corner’ to The Mathe-
matical Intelligencer, and thank the publishers for permission to use material
from these columns. Useful material for this book was also gleaned from
Philamath*, a regular news sheet for collectors of mathematical stamps. I am
also very grateful to the Postal Authorities and individuals who have given
permission to reproduce the copyrighted stamp images; a list of these
appears in the Acknowledgements section at the end of the book.
Finally, many individuals have helped with suggestions, and I am particu-
larly grateful to Marlow Anderson, June Barrow-Green, Joy Crispin-Wilson,
Matthew Esplen, Florence Fasanelli, John Fauvel, Michael Ferguson, Ray-
mond Flood, Paul Garcia, Helen Gardner, Caroline Grundy, Keith Hannabuss,
Heiko Harborth, Roger Heath-Brown, Stephen Huggett, Victor Katz, Adrian
Rice and Eleanor Robson for their support and advice. I am also very grate-
ful to Tony Webb of the Open University for scanning the stamp images, and
to Ina Lindemann, Joe Piliero and Jerry Lyons of Springer-Verlag, New York.

rom earliest times people have needed to be able to count and measure
the objects around them. Early methods of counting included forming
stones into piles, cutting notches in sticks and finger counting. It is
undoubtedly due to this last method that our familiar decimal number
system emerged.
Early examples of mathematical writing appeared in Mesopotamia, between
the rivers Tigris and Euphrates in present-day Iraq. A Sumerian accounting
tablet from around 3000 BC features commodities such as barley; the three
thumbnail indentations represent numbers. Their number system became a
sexagesimal one, based on 60, which we still use in our measurement of time.
The Babylonians later imprinted their mathematics with a wedge-shaped
stylus on damp clay which was then baked in the sun. Hundreds of these
cuneiform tablets from 1900 to 1600 BC have survived, and show a good
understanding of arithmetic (including a very accurate value for 2),
algebra (the solution of linear and quadratic equations) and geometry (the
calculation of areas and volumes). There is also a tablet indicating a detailed
knowledge of Pythagorean triples (numbers a, b, c satisfying a2  b2  c2) a
thousand years before Pythagoras; one of the triples is 12,709, 13,500,
18,541—a remarkable achievement for the time. The Babylonians also
studied astronomy and were able to predict eclipses; in 164 BC they observed
the comet now known as Halley’s comet (see page 60)—not in 2349 BC as
stated on the stamp opposite.
Geometrical alignments of stones have been found in several places.
Celebrated examples include the circular pattern of megaliths at Stonehenge
and the linear arrangements at Carnac in Brittany. Although their exact
purpose is unknown, it is likely that their construction had religious
significance and was designed to demonstrate astronomical events such as
sunrise on midsummer’s day.
Interest in geometrical patterns can also be seen in cave drawings. Attractive
examples of early geometrical cave art have been found in the Chuquisaca
region of Bolivia.

he main achievements of early Egyptian mathematicians involved the
practical skill of measurement. The oldest of the Egyptian pyramids is
King Djoser’s step pyramid in nearby Saqqara, built in horizontal layers
and dating from about 2700 BC. It was supposedly designed by Imhotep,
the celebrated court physician, Grand Vizier and architect.
The magnificent pyramids of Gizeh (or Giza) date from about 2600 BC and
attest to the Egyptians’ extremely accurate measuring ability. In particular, 
the Great Pyramid of Cheops has a square base whose sides of length 
230-metre agree to less than 0.01%. Constructed from more than two million
blocks averaging over 2 tonnes in weight, the pyramid is 146 metres 
high and contains an intricate arrangement of internal chambers and 
passageways.
Our knowledge of later Egyptian mathematics is scanty, deriving mainly
from two fragile primary sources, the Moscow papyrus (c.1850 BC) and the
Rhind papyrus (c.1650 BC). These papyri include tables of fractions and
several dozen solved problems in arithmetic and geometry, probably
designed for the teaching of scribes and accountants. These problems range
from division problems involving the sharing of a number of loaves in
specified proportions to geometrical problems on the area of a triangle of
land and the volume of a cylindrical granary of given diameter and height;
the solution of the latter problem gives rise to a value of  of 256⁄81 (about
3.16). The Egyptians used a decimal system for counting, but their fractions
were mainly ‘unit fractions’ of the form 1⁄n; more complicated fractions were
written in terms of these—for example,


.
Prominent among other Egyptians interested in mathematics was Amenhotep
(see page 75), a high official during the reign of Amenhotep III (c.1400 BC).
During the Ptolemaic era 1000 years later, his name came to be associated with
the ibis-headed Thoth, the Egyptian god of reckoning.

tarting from around 600 BC, mathematics and astronomy flourished for
over one thousand years throughout the Greek-speaking world of the
eastern Mediterranean Sea. During this time, the Greeks developed the
concept of deductive logical reasoning that became the hallmark of much of
their work, especially in the area of geometry. Some of their achievements
are described in the next few pages.
The earliest known Greek mathematician is Thales of Miletus (c.624–547 BC)
who, according to legend, brought geometry to Greece from Egypt. He
predicted a solar eclipse in 585 BC and showed how rubbing with a stone can
produce electricity in feathers. In geometry he investigated the congruence of
triangles, applying it to navigation at sea, and is credited with proving that
the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal and that a circle is bisected
by any diameter.
Pythagoras (c.572–497 BC) was a semi-legendary figure. Born on the Aegean
island of Samos, he later emigrated to the Greek seaport of Crotona, now in
Italy, where he founded the Pythagorean school. This closely-knit
brotherhood was formed, according to later writers, to further the study of
mathematics, philosophy and the natural sciences. The Pythagoreans
believed that ‘All is number’, and there was a particular emphasis on the
‘mathematical arts’ of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music.
Pythagoras is one of the Greek scholars depicted in Raphael’s Vatican fresco
The School of Athens (c.1509).
It is not known who first proved Pythagoras’ theorem, that the area of the
square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is the sum of the areas
of the squares on the other two sides, but Pythagorean triples were already
known to the Babylonians (see page 2).
Democritus (c.400–370 BC) was also interested in geometry, investigating
the properties of pyramids and cones by splitting them into ‘indivisible’
sections by planes parallel to the base. He is primarily known for first
proposing the view that all matter consists of small indivisible particles,
called atoms.

rom about 500 to 300 BC, Athens became the most important intellectual
centre in Greece, numbering among its scholars Plato and Aristotle.
Although neither is remembered primarily as a mathematician, both helped
to set the stage for the ‘golden age of Greek mathematics’ in Alexandria.
The Acropolis, the ‘highest city of ancient kings’ was devastated by a Persian
invasion in 480 BC. Inspired by Pericles, the city was rebuilt and the
magnificent Parthenon was added, being completed in 432 BC. Constructed
on mathematical principles, it is surrounded on all sides by towering
columns of white marble.
Around 387 BC, Plato (c.427–347 BC) founded his school in a part of Athens
called Academy. Here he wrote and directed studies, and the Academy soon
became the focal point for mathematical study and philosophical research.
Over the entrance appeared the inscription: ‘Let no-one ignorant of geometry
enter here’.
Plato believed that the study of mathematics and philosophy provided the
finest training for those who were to hold positions of responsibility in the
state. In his Republic he discussed the Pythagoreans’ mathematical arts of
arithmetic, plane and solid geometry, astronomy and music, explaining their
nature and justifying their importance for the ‘philosopher-ruler’. His
Timaeus includes a discussion of the five regular solids—tetrahedron, cube,
octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron.
Aristotle (384–322 BC) became a student at the Academy at the age of 17
and stayed there for twenty years until Plato’s death. He was fascinated by
logical questions and systematised the study of logic and deductive reasoning.
In particular, he mentioned a proof that 2 cannot be written in rational
form a/b, where a and b are integers, and he discussed syllogisms such as:
‘all men are mortal; Socrates is a man; thus Socrates is mortal’.
In Raphael’s fresco The School of Athens (see page 6), Plato and Aristotle are
pictured on the steps of the Academy. Plato is holding a copy of his Timaeus
and Aristotle is carrying his Ethics.

round 300 BC, with the rise to power of Ptolemy I, mathematical activity
moved to the Egyptian part of the Greek empire. In Alexandria Ptolemy
founded a university that became the intellectual centre for Greek
scholarship for over 800 years. Ptolemy also started its famous library, which
eventually held over half-a-million manuscripts. The celebrated Pharos
lighthouse at Alexandria, seen on the stamp opposite, was one of the seven
wonders of the ancient world.
The first important mathematician associated with Alexandria was Euclid
(c.300 BC), who wrote on optics and conics, but is mainly remembered for
his Elements. The most influential and widely read mathematical book of all
time, the Elements, is a compilation of results known at the time, and consists
of thirteen books on plane and solid geometry, number theory, and the theory
of proportion. A model of deductive reasoning, it starts from initial axioms
and postulates and uses rules of deduction to derive each new proposition
in a logical and systematic order.
Archimedes (c.287–212 BC), a native of Syracuse on the island of Sicily, was
one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived. In geometry he calculated
the surface areas and volumes of various solids, such as the sphere and
cylinder, and listed the thirteen semi-regular solids whose faces are regular
but not all of the same shape. By considering 96-sided polygons that
approximate a circle, Archimedes proved that  lies between 3 10⁄71 and
310⁄70 ( 22⁄7), and he also investigated the ‘Archimedean spiral’, now usually
written with polar equation r  k.
In applied mathematics he made outstanding contributions to both
mechanics and statics. In mechanics he found the ‘law of moments’ for a
balance with weights attached, devised ingenious mechanical contrivances
for the defence of Syracuse, and is credited with inventing the Archimedean
screw for raising water from a river. In statics he observed that the weight
of an object immersed in water is reduced by an amount equal to the weight
of water displaced—now called ‘Archimedes’ principle’—and used this to
test the purity of King Hiero’s gold crown. On discovering
his principle he supposedly jumped out of his bath and
ran naked down the street shouting ‘Eureka!’ (I have
found it!).

he heavens were studied by a number of Greek scholars—in particular,
Eudoxus, Aristarchus, Hipparchus and Ptolemy.
The mathematician and astronomer Eudoxus of Cnidus (408–355 BC)
studied at Plato’s Academy and is often credited with developing the theory
behind Books V (on proportion) and XII (on the ‘method of exhaustion’) of
Euclid’s Elements. In astronomy he advanced the hypothesis that the sun,
moon and planets move around the earth on rotating concentric spheres, a
hypothesis later adopted in modified form by Aristotle.
Aristarchus of Samos (c.310–230 BC) advanced an alternative hypothesis—
that ‘the fixed stars and the sun remain unmoved and that the earth revolves
about the sun in the circumference of a circle’. Aristarchus thus anticipated
by 1800 years the revolutionary work of Nicolaus Copernicus (see page 44),
but his hypothesis found few adherents among his contemporaries.
The first trigonometrical approach to astronomy was provided by Hipparchus
of Bithynia (190–120 BC), possibly the greatest astronomical observer of
antiquity. Sometimes called ‘the father of trigonometry’, he discovered the
precession of the equinoxes and constructed a ‘table of chords’ yielding the
sines of angles. He also introduced a coordinate system for the stars and
constructed the first known star catalogue.
The earth-centred hypothesis was developed by Claudius Ptolemy of
Alexandria (c.100–178 AD), giving rise to the Ptolemaic system, shown
opposite on a block of stamps honouring Copernicus. Ptolemy wrote a
definitive 13-volume work on astronomy, usually known by its later Arabic
name Almagest (‘the greatest’). It contained a mathematical description of
the motion of the sun, moon and planets, and included a table of chords
listing the sines of angles from 0° to 180° in steps of 1⁄2°.
Ptolemy also published a standard work on map-making called Geographia,
in which he discussed various types of map projection and gave the latitude
and longitude of 8000 places in the known world. His maps were used by
navigators for many centuries.

ames have a universal appeal and have been played since earliest times.
Many games require great skill and ingenuity and have been subjected
to much mathematical analysis. Go and chess are discussed on page 34; here
we concentrate on some less familiar games.
Senet is an early form of backgammon and may date back to 3000 BC. A
celebrated Egyptian example from 1350 BC was found in the tomb of
Tutankhamen. It was played by two players on a 3  10 board with 
lion-shaped pieces. The African game of eklan is also played by two players.
It consists of a board with 24 holes, arranged in concentric squares, into
which sticks are inserted according to specified rules.
Mancala is a count-and-capture board game, usually played with counters
(pebbles or beans) by two players. The board has a number of indentations,
generally arranged in two rows, with a larger compartment (the ‘mancala’)
at the end on each player’s right. The players place counters into the
indentations and move them according to specified rules, in order to capture
their opponent’s counters. Variations on mancala have appeared in many
parts of Africa and southern Asia. In Indonesia it is known as dakon (or
tjongkak), while an early form involving four rows of indentations was
played in southern Africa under the name morabaraba.
Baghchal, found in Nepal, is a form of draughts or checkers. The earliest
game of this type seems to be alquerque or el-quirkat, a game found in the
Middle East around 1400 BC. It is played on a 5  5 board by two players,
who move their pieces along the lines and capture their opponent’s pieces
by ‘jumping over’ them.
Mazes and labyrinths have existed for many thousands of years. In ancient
Crete, King Minos ruled over the intricate labyrinth of Knossos where Greek
youths were regularly sacrificed to a fierce minotaur that was eventually
slain by Theseus. Such labyrinths sometimes appeared on Cretan coins; the
stamp opposite shows a seven-ring labyrinth on a coin dating from about
450 BC.

ost ancient Chinese mathematics was written on bamboo or paper
which has perished with time. However, an outstanding work that
survives, possibly from 200 BC, is the Jiuzhang suanshu [Chiu-chang
suan-shu] (Nine chapters on the mathematical art), which contains the
calculation of areas and volumes, the evaluation of square and cube roots,
and the systematic solution of simultaneous equations.
Several Chinese mathematicians devoted their attention to evaluating .
Zhang Heng [Chang Heng] (78–139 AD), inventor of the seismograph for
measuring earthquake intensity, proposed the value 10
 (about 3.16), a
value also found by Indian mathematicians a couple of centuries earlier. Liu
Hui (c.260 AD), while revising the Jiuzhang suanshu, calculated the areas of
regular polygons with 96 and 192 sides and deduced that  lies between
3.1410 and 3.1427. Most remarkable was the work of Zu Changzhi [Tsu
Ch’ung-Chih] (429–500), who calculated the areas of regular polygons with
12,288 and 24,576 sides and deduced that  lies between 3.1415926 and
3.1415927. Zu Changzhi also obtained the approximation 355⁄113, which is
correct to six decimal places; such accuracy was not obtained in the West for
another thousand years.
The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries saw Chinese contributions to algebra
and the numerical solution of equations. The arithmetical triangle of
binomial coefficients, now usually called ‘Pascal’s triangle’, appeared in a
Chinese text of 1303. A notable figure of the time was Guo Shoujing [Kuo
Shou-Ching] (1231–1316), who worked on calendar construction, astronomy
and spherical trigonometry.
Various Chinese measuring instruments have survived, including a distance-
measuring drum cart from around 300 AD and a 1437 armillary sphere, an
astronomical device for representing the great circles of the heavens. The
abacus has appeared in different forms around the world, originally as a sand
tray with pebbles; the Chinese version consists of a frame with beads, called
a ‘suan pan’.

round 250 BC King Ashoka, ruler of most of India, became the first
Buddhist monarch. His conversion was celebrated by the construction
of many pillars carved with his edicts. These Ashoka columns contain
the earliest known appearance of what would eventually become our 
Hindu-Arabic numerals. The Nepalese stamp opposite shows the Ashoka
column in Lumbini, the birthplace of Buddha.
Unlike the complicated Roman numerals, and the Greek decimal system 
in which different symbols were used for 1, 2, . . . , 9, 10, 20, . . . , 90, 100,
200, . . . , 900, etc., the Hindu number system uses the same ten digits
throughout, but in a place-value system where the position of each digit
indicates its value. This enables calculations to be carried out column by 
column.
Indian mathematics can be traced back to around 600 BC. A number of 
Vedic manuscripts contain early work on arithmetic, permutations and
combinations, the theory of numbers and the extraction of square roots.
The two most outstanding Indian mathematicians of the first millennium
AD were Aryabhata (b. 476) and Brahmagupta (b. 598). Aryabhata gave the
first systematic treatment of ‘Diophantine equations’—algebraic equations
for which we seek solutions in integers. He also presented formulas for the
sum of the natural numbers and of their squares and cubes and obtained
the value 3.1416 for . The first Indian satellite was named Aryabhata in his
honour, and appears on the stamp opposite.
Brahmagupta discussed the use of zero (another Indian invention) and
negative numbers, and described a general method for solving quadratic
equations. He also solved some quadratic Diophantine equations such as
92x 2  1  y2 (now known as ‘Pell’s equation’), for which he obtained the
integer solution x  120, y  1151. Around this time the game of chess was
invented in India (see page 34); the stamp opposite features an Indian chess
piece from the eighteenth century.
In later years Indian mathematicians and astronomers
became interested in practical astronomy and built
magnificent observatories such as the Jantar Mantar in
Jaipur.

ne of the most interesting counting systems is that of the Mayans of
Central America (Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras),
between 300 and 1000 AD. Based on the numbers 20 and 18, it was a place-
value system composed of the symbols 
for 1, 
for 5 (combined to give
numbers up to 19) and 
for 0; for example,
means (1  7200)  (7  360)  (0  20)  19  9739.
Each number was also written in pictorial form, the picture representing the
head of a man, bird, animal or deity.
Most of their mathematical calculations involved the measurement of time.
They used two calendars: a 260-day ritual calendar with 13 cycles of 20 days,
and a 365-day calendar with 18 months of 20 days and five extra days.
Combining these calendars gave a long ‘calendar-round’ of 18,980 days 
( 52 calendar years).
Our knowledge of the Mayans’ counting system and of their calendars is
derived mainly from hieroglyphic inscriptions on carved pillars (stelae),
writings on the walls of caves and ruins, and a handful of painted
manuscripts. The most notable of these manuscripts is the beautiful Dresden
codex, dating from about 1200 AD. It is painted in colour on a long strip of
glazed fig-tree bark and contains many examples of Mayan numbers.
Around the year 1500 the Incas of Peru, two thousand miles further south,
invented the quipu for recording and conveying numbers and other
statistical information. It consists of a main cord to which many thinner
knotted cords of various colours are attached; the size and position of each
knot correspond to a different number in a decimal system, and the colours
convey different types of information. Quipus were used for accounting
purposes and for recording other types of numerical data. The information
was carried around the region by teams of Inca messengers, trained runners
who could cover large distances in a day.

T
he period from 750 to 1400 was an important time for the development
of mathematics. United by their new religion, Islamic scholars seized on
the available Greek and Roman writings from the west and Hindu writings
from the east and developed them considerably. Their achievements are
described in the next few pages.
Some of our mathematical language dates from the Islamic period. The word
‘algorithm’ (a routine step-by-step procedure for solving a problem) derives
from the name of the Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-
Khwarizmi (c.780–850), who lived in Baghdad and wrote influential works
on arithmetic and algebra. His Arithmetic is important for introducing the
Hindu decimal place-value system to the Islamic world, and the title of his
algebra book, Kitab al-jabr wal-muqabala gives us the term ‘algebra’; the word
‘al-jabr’ refers to the operation of adding a positive quantity to eliminate a
negative one.
The first outstanding philosopher of the period was al-Kindi (d. c.870), who
produced over two hundred works on subjects ranging from Euclid’s
geometry and Indian arithmetic to cooking. Another was the brilliant Islamic
scholar al-Farabi (c.878–950), whose mathematical writings included an
influential commentary on Euclid’s Elements.
Al-Biruni (973–1055) was an outstanding intellectual figure who contributed
over one hundred works, primarily on arithmetic and geometry, astronomy,
geography and the calendar. Writing on trigonometry, he was one of the first
mathematicians to investigate the tangent, cotangent, secant and cosecant
functions.
The most celebrated of all the Arabian philosopher-scientists, primarily
known for his treatises on medicine, was ibn Sinah (980–1037), usually
known in the west as Avicenna. He contributed to arithmetic and number
theory, produced a celebrated Arabic summary of Euclid’s Elements, and
applied his mathematical knowledge to various problems from physics and
astronomy.

D
uring the eighth and ninth centuries, the Islamic world spread along 
the northern coast of Africa and up through southern Spain and Italy.
The next three centuries were to be fertile years for the development of
mathematics and astronomy. The Islamic astronomers began to use the
astronomical and navigational instruments of the day. These included the
planisphere and the astrolabe, used for observing the positions and altitudes
of celestial bodies and for telling the time of day.
Influential among the works of the time, especially when translated into
Latin during the Renaissance, were those of ibn al-Haitham (965–1039).
Known in the west as Alhazen, he was a geometer whose main contributions
were to the study of optics. A celebrated problem is ‘Alhazen’s problem’,
which asks: at which point on a spherical mirror is light from a given point
source reflected into the eye of a given observer? An equivalent formulation
is: at which point on the cushion of a circular billiard table must a cue ball
be aimed so as to hit a given target ball?
Omar Khayyam (1048–1131) was a mathematician and poet who wrote on
the binomial theorem and on geometry. In algebra he presented the first
systematic classification of cubic equations and a discussion of their solution;
such equations were not to be solved in general until the sixteenth century.
He is known in the west mainly for his collection of poems known as the
Rubaiyat.
Omar Khayyam also publicly criticised an attempted proof by ibn 
al-Haitham of Euclid’s so-called ‘parallel postulate’ (see page 70). A later
unsuccessful attempt to prove this postulate was given by the distinguished
Persian mathematician Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274). Al-Tusi constructed
the first modern astronomical observatory and wrote influential treatises 
on astronomy, logic, theology and ethics. His several contributions to
trigonometry included the sine rule for triangles: if a, b and c are the sides
of a triangle, opposite to the angles A, B and C, then
a/sin A  b/sin B  c/sin C.

uring the Middle Ages, Córdoba became the scientific capital of Europe.
Islamic decorative art and architecture spread throughout southern
Spain and Portugal; celebrated examples include the magnificent arches in
the Córdoba Mezquita (mosque) and the variety of geometrical tiling
patterns in the Alhambra in Granada.
The Spanish geometer and astronomer al-Zarqali (d. 1100) lived in Toledo
and Córdoba and produced several important works, including a set of
trigonometrical tables, chiefly for use in astronomy. He was an instrument
maker who constructed a number of astrolabes.
The Jewish scholar Moses ben Maimon, or Maimonides (1135–1204), was
also born in Córdoba. Religious persecution forced his family to move to
Cairo where he practised medicine, becoming personal physician to Saladin,
Sultan of Egypt. A mathematician, astronomer and philosopher, he wrote on
the calendar, the moon and combinatorial problems, and asserted that  is
irrational. Another Córdoban was the influential commentator Muhammad
ibn Rushd (1126–1198), known in the west as Averroës, who translated the
works of Aristotle into Arabic and wrote a treatise specifying which parts
of Euclid’s Elements were needed for the study of Ptolemy’s Almagest.
By the fifteenth century Samarkand in central Asia had become one of the
greatest centres of civilisation. The Persian mathematician and astronomer
Jamshid al-Kashani (or al-Kashi) (d. 1429) made extensive calculations with
decimal fractions and established a notation for them, using a vertical line
to separate the integer and fractional parts. A prodigious calculator, he
determined  to 16 decimal places and obtained a very precise value for the
sine of 1°, from which many other trigonometrical values can be determined.
Al-Kashani’s patron was the Turkish astronomer Ulugh Beg (1394–1449),
whose observatory contained a special sextant, the largest of its type in the
world. Using al-Kashani’s value for sin 1°, Ulugh Beg constructed extensive
tables for the sine and tangent of every angle for each minute of arc to five
sexagesimal places.

The Middle Ages
T
he period from 500 to 1000 in Europe is known as the Dark Ages. The
legacy of the ancient world was almost forgotten, schooling became
infrequent, and the general level of culture remained low. Mathematical
activity was generally sparse, but included some writings on the calendar
and on finger reckoning by the Venerable Bede (c.673–735), and the
influential Problems for the quickening of the mind by Alcuin of York (735–804),
educational adviser to Charlemagne.
Revival of interest in mathematics began with Gerbert of Aurillac
(938–1003), who trained in Catalonia and was probably the first to introduce
the Hindu-Arabic numerals to Christian Europe, using an abacus that he
had designed for the purpose; he was crowned Pope Sylvester II in 999.
Hindu-Arabic methods of calculation were also used by Fibonacci (Leonardo
of Pisa) in his Liber abaci [Book of calculation] of 1202. This celebrated book
contained many problems in arithmetic and algebra, including the celebrated
problem of the rabbits that leads to the ‘Fibonacci sequence’ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
13, . . . , in which each term after the first two is the sum of the previous
pair.
Several other distinguished scholars studied mathematics around this time.
These included Albertus Magnus (c.1193–1280), who introduced the works
of Aristotle to European audiences, and Geoffrey Chaucer (1342–1400),
author of the Canterbury tales, who wrote a treatise on the astrolabe, one of
the earliest science books to be written in English. John of Gmunden
(1384–1442) also discussed astronomical instruments, including astrolabes,
quadrants, and sundials; the attractive clock of Imms (1555) is based on 
his designs. The cardinal and scholar Nicholas of Cusa (1401–1464) wrote
several mathematical tracts and attempted the classical problems of
trisecting an angle and squaring the circle; he also invented concave lens
spectacles.
The Catalan mystic Ramon Lull (c.1232–1316) believed that all knowledge
can be obtained as mathematical combinations of a fixed number of ‘divine
attributes’. Lull’s ideas spread through Europe, and
influenced later mathematicians such as Leibniz.

The Growth of Learning
T
he renaissance in mathematical learning during the Middle Ages was
largely due to three factors: the translation of Arabic classical texts into
Latin during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the establishment of the
earliest European universities, and the invention of printing. The first of these
made the works of Euclid, Archimedes and other Greek writers available to
European scholars, the second enabled groups of like-minded scholars to meet
and discourse on matters of common interest, while the last enabled scholarly
works to be available at modest cost to the general populace.
The first European university was founded in Bologna in 1088, and Paris
and Oxford followed shortly after. The curriculum was in two parts. The
first part, studied by those aspiring to a Bachelor’s degree, was based on the
ancient ‘trivium’ of grammar, rhetoric and logic (usually Aristotelian). The
second part, leading to a Master’s degree, was based on the ‘quadrivium’,
the Greek mathematical arts of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music;
the works studied would have included Euclid’s Elements and Ptolemy’s
Almagest.
Johann Gutenberg’s invention of the printing press (around 1440) enabled
classic mathematical works to be widely available for the first time. At first
the new books were printed in Latin for the scholar, but increasingly
vernacular works began to appear at a price accessible to all; these included
texts in arithmetic, algebra and geometry, as well as practical works designed
to prepare young men for a commercial career.
Important among the new printed texts was the 1494 Summa de arithmetica,
geometrica, proportioni et proportionalita of Luca Pacioli (1445–1517), a 
600-page compilation of the mathematics known at the time; it included the
first published account of double-entry bookkeeping. In Germany the most
influential of the commercial arithmetics was by Adam Riese (c.1489–1559);
it proved so reputable that the phrase ‘nach Adam Riese’ [after Adam Riese]
came to indicate a correct calculation.

Renaissance Art
C
onnections between mathematics and the visual arts have been apparent
since earliest times. Some early geometrical cave art was featured on
page 3, and many peoples have incorporated mathematical patterns into the
designs of their pots and vases and in their weaving and basketry. The
Romans frequently used geometrical decorations in their mosaics.
One notable feature of Renaissance art was that, for the first time, painters
became interested in depicting three-dimensional objects realistically, giving
visual depth to their works. This soon led to the formal study of geometrical
perspective.
The first person to investigate perspective seriously was the artisan-engineer
Filipo Brunelleschi (1377–1446), who designed the self-supporting octagonal
cupola of the cathedral in Florence. Brunelleschi’s ideas were developed by
his friend Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472), who presented mathematical
rules for correct perspective painting and stated in his Della pittura [On
painting] that ‘the first duty of a painter is to know geometry’.
Piero della Francesca (1415–1492) found a perspective grid useful for his
investigations into solid geometry, and wrote De prospectiva pingendi [On the
perspective of painting] and Libellus de quinque corporibus regularibus [Book
on the five regular solids]. The picture on the stamps opposite, his painting
Madonna and child with saints (1472), is in perfect mathematical perspective.
The other title on these stamps is De divina proportione [On divine proportion]
(1509) by Piero’s friend Luca Pacioli (see page 30); Pacioli is the monk
depicted second from the right. The woodcuts of polyhedra in this book
were by Pacioli’s friend and student Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), who
explored perspective more deeply than any other Renaissance painter. In his
Trattato della pittura [Treatise on painting] da Vinci warns ‘Let no one who
is not a mathematician read my work’.
Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) was a celebrated German artist and engraver
who learned perspective from the Italians and introduced it to Germany.
His famous engravings, such as Melencolia I (see frontispiece) and St Jerome
in his study, show his effective use of perspective.

Go and Chess
O
n page 14 we illustrated some board games from around the world. Two
of the most celebrated games, Go and chess, have been extensively
subjected to mathematical analysis and have featured on many stamps.
The ancient game of Go, formerly ‘wei-chi’ or ‘weiqi’, was created in China
at least three thousand years ago and was introduced to Japan and Korea
during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), before eventually finding its way to
Europe. It is now usually played on a 19  19 board by two players who
alternately place black and white stones on the intersections of the squares.
The object of the game is to capture one’s opponent’s stones by surrounding
them, and thereby control large areas of the board. Two Go formations,
‘China vogue’ (black) and ‘linked stars’ (white), are depicted on the Chinese
stamp opposite, and Choe Un, a seven-year-old competitor in the World Go
Championships, appears on the stamp from North Korea.
The game of chess probably originated in the sixth century in India, where
it developed from a game called ‘chaturanga’. It quickly spread to Persia,
where it was known as ‘shatranj’, and from there to the Arabic world. During
the eighth and ninth centuries the Moors took the game to Spain, and thence
to the rest of Europe where it had become widely established by the eleventh
century.
The oldest and most celebrated European work on chess is the beautifully
illustrated Book of chess, dice and boards, commissioned in 1283 by King
Alfonso the Wise of Castile and León; a diagram from this book appears on
the stamp from Yemen opposite. Other chess books followed—notably,
William Caxton’s The game and playe of chesse, which appeared in 1476. An
Italian book of the late fifteenth century illustrates a royal chess party that
took place in Florence in 1493.
Variations on the game of chess have been played on boards of various sizes,
such as those of sizes 8  9, 8  12, 9  9 and 12  12. It was not until the
seventeenth century that the present 8  8 chessboard became completely
established.

The Age of Exploration
T
he Renaissance coincided with the great sea voyages and explorations of
Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Vespucci and Magellan. Such explorations
necessitated the development of accurate maps and globes and of reliable
navigational instruments for use at sea. These developments are described
in the next few pages.
Prince Henry the Navigator (1394–1460) devoted his wealth and energies to
maritime exploration. Year after year he sent ships down the west coast of
Africa from his palace-observatory at Sagres in Portugal. He claimed the
island groups of Madeira and the Azores and his dream was to reach a
legendary Christian kingdom believed to lie in the heart of Africa.
In 1488 Bartholomew Diaz rounded the Cape of Good Hope, giving promise
of a sea route to India. Ten years later Vasco da Gama (1469–1524) became
the first European to sail around the tip of Africa and reach the west coast
of India. There he made contact with Christian communities and took
advantage of the lucrative spice trade.
Whereas the aims of the Portuguese explorers had been to sail south 
and east, their rivals the Spanish headed west, hoping to reach India by
circumnavigating the globe. From 1492 Christopher Columbus (1451–1506),
a navigator of genius, led four royal Spanish expeditions to pioneer a western
route to the Indies. His expeditions reached, not India, but the new lands of
North and Central America, the West Indies, and the coast of Venezuela.
Further expeditions followed across the Atlantic Ocean; ‘America’ was
named after Amerigo Vespucci, a Florentine who reached Brazil in 1502.
Ferdinand Magellan (1480–1521) led the first circumnavigation of the world,
a three-year voyage that headed westward to South America, around Cape
Horn, on via the Philippines (where he died in a tribal skirmish) and back
via the Indian Ocean and southern Africa. Sir Francis Drake also completed
a circumnavigation of the world; his astrolabe appears on page 43.

Map-Making
T
he nautical explorations described on page 36 played a major role in the
renaissance of map-making. The problem of accurately representing the
spherical earth on a flat sheet of paper led to new types of map projection
and to improved maps for navigators at sea. The Greek astronomer Ptolemy
(see page 12), the Portuguese cosmographer Pedro Nunes, the Flemish
cartographer Gerard Mercator and his friend Abraham Ortelius all played a
role in this story.
Around 1500 European navigators rediscovered Ptolemy’s Geographia and
his maps came to be used extensively by navigators. Ptolemy’s writings
contained a detailed discussion of projections for map-making and included
a ‘world map’ featuring Europe, Africa and Asia as well as many detailed
regional maps. With the invention of printing, woodcut copies could easily
be mass-produced and a number of editions appeared in the sixteenth
century, each one revised to take account of new explorations.
One of the first European mathematicians to apply mathematical techniques
to cartography was Pedro Nunes (1502–1594), Royal cosmographer and the
leading figure in Portuguese nautical science. He constructed a ‘nonius’, an
instrument for measuring fractions of a degree, and in his 1537 treatise on
the sphere he showed how to represent as a straight line each rhumb line,
the path of a ship on a fixed bearing.
The first world map to include America appeared in 1507, and later editions
of Ptolemy included America. The first ‘modern’ maps of the world were
due to Gerard Mercator (1512–1594); they can be obtained by projecting the
sphere outwards on to a vertical cylinder and then stretching the map in the
vertical direction. In this way, the lines of latitude (horizontal) and longitude
(vertical) appear as straight lines, and all of the angles (compass directions)
are correct.
In 1570 the illustrious Belgian cartographer Abraham Ortelius (1527–1598),
geographer to the king of Spain, produced his Theatrum orbis terrarum, a
collection of seventy maps; this is usually considered to
be the first atlas. The word ‘atlas’ was coined by Mercator
for his three-volume collection of maps in 1585–1595.

Globes
T
errestrial and celestial globes are used for representing the positions of
geographical and astronomical features. During the sixteenth century,
with the new interest in exploration and navigation, terrestrial globes 
became increasingly in demand. The first known terrestrial globe was
constructed by the Nuremberg map-maker Martin Behaim in 1492. On the
opposite page we present four globes from the National exhibition of
mathematics and physics in Dresden.
The Arabian celestial globe of 1279 is one of the five oldest Islamic globes
known. Constructed by Muhammed ben Mu’aijad al-Ardi of Meragha in
Persia, it consists of brass overlaid with gold and silver. Only 30.5 cm high
with a diameter of 14.4 cm, it illustrates the positions of about one thousand
stars arranged into 47 constellations, following ideas of Ptolemy.
The terrestrial globe of 1568 was constructed by Johannes Praetorius of
Nuremberg. It is made of brass to a scale of about 1 to 45 million, and is 
47 cm high with a diameter of 28 cm. The map inscribed on the globe depicts
the continents of Europe, Africa, Asia and America, with America shown
joined to Asia.
The globe clock of 1586 was designed by Johannes Reinhold and Georg Roll
of Augsburg. It is made of brass and copper covered with gold leaf, and is
56.5 cm high with a diameter of 20.5 cm. It contains a small terrestrial sphere
below a large celestial sphere, all crowned by a small armillary sphere 
and surrounded by a movable calendar ring. The celestial sphere depicts 49
constellations.
The heraldic celestial globe of 1690 was designed by Erhard Weigel, a
mathematics professor from Jena. It is 59 cm high with a diameter of 
27.5 cm, and is made of brass covered with copper foil. It contains a system
of rings representing the equator, a meridian, the tropics of Cancer and
Capricorn, and other circles. Replacing the usual Ptolemaic constellations
are the coat-of-arms of Saxony and other heraldic images.

Navigational Instruments
W
e have already encountered some navigational instruments—a Chinese
armillary sphere (page 19), an Islamic planisphere (page 27) and an
astrolabe (page 29).
Armillary spheres were usually made of metal circles representing the main
circles of the universe, and were used to measure celestial coordinates or for
instructional purposes. The other instruments shown here were used by
navigators to measure the altitude of a heavenly body, such as the sun or
the pole star, so as to determine latitude at sea.
The astrolabe can be traced back to Greek times, but reached its maturity
during the Islamic period. It consists of a brass disc suspended by a ring
that is fixed or held in the hand. On the front are various calculating devices
used to take measurements of the heavenly bodies. The back has a circular
scale on the rim and an attached rotating bar; to measure altitude, the
observer looks along the bar at the object and reads the altitude from the
scale. For navigational purposes a more basic and sturdy version was
developed, known as the mariner’s astrolabe.
Quadrants were in use in Europe from around the thirteenth century. As its
name suggests, the quadrant has the shape of a quarter-circle (90°); its
relations, the sextant and octant, similarly correspond to a sixth (60°) and
an eighth (45°) of a circle. To measure an object’s altitude, the observer views
the object along the top edge of the instrument and the position of a movable
rod on the circular rim gives the desired altitude.
The Jewish scholar Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344), a mathematician,
philosopher and astronomer, invented the Jacob’s staff, or cross-staff, for
measuring the angular separation between two celestial bodies. Although
widely used, it had a major disadvantage—to measure the angle between
the sun and the horizon one had to look directly at the sun. The back-staff
is a clever modification in which a navigator can use the instrument with
his back to the sun.

Nicolaus Copernicus
N
icolaus Copernicus (1473–1543), the ‘father of modern astronomy’, was
born in Torun in Poland, and studied in Cracow, Bologna and Ferrara.
He transformed his subject by replacing Ptolemy’s earth-centred system of
planetary motion (see page 12) by a heliocentric system in which the sun
lies at the centre and the earth is just one of several planets travelling in
circular orbits around it. Although this idea had been suggested previously
by a few people, such as Aristarchus (see page 12) and Nicholas of Cusa (see
page 28), Copernicus was the first to develop the underlying theory and
work out its consequences in full mathematical detail.
Copernicus’ book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium [On the revolution of
the heavenly spheres] was published in 1543 and a copy of it was presented
to him as he lay on his death-bed. In his book Copernicus showed that the
six planets known at the time split into two groups: Mercury and Venus,
whose orbits lie inside that of Earth; and Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, whose
orbits lie outside it. In this way he was able to list these planets in increasing
order of distance from the sun, and thereby to illuminate certain phenomena
that the Ptolemaic system had failed to explain, such as why Mercury and
Venus are visible only at dawn and dusk while the other planets are visible
throughout the night.
The Copernican solar system aroused much controversy and brought its
supporters into direct conflict with the Church who considered the earth 
to lie at the centre of Creation, so that Copernicus’ ideas were at variance
with the Holy Scriptures. The philosopher Giordano Bruno (1548–1600)
was arrested by the Inquisition in Venice and burned alive for heresy for
espousing the Copernican theory, while Galileo Galilei, at a famous
Inquisition trial in 1633, was forced to recant after publishing his Dialogue
concerning the two chief world systems which presented the Copernican system
as superior to the Ptolemaic one. Galileo was not pardoned by the Church
until 1995.

The New Astronomy
T
he Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546–1601) was the greatest observer
of the heavens before the invention of the telescope. In 1572 he discovered
a new star, or ‘nova’, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, and five years later
his observations of a comet proved that the solid celestial spheres on which
the planets were supposed to move did not exist. In the 1570s he built the
magnificent observatory of Uraniborg on the island of Hven, where he 
built astronomical instruments of unsurpassed accuracy and measured and
catalogued over seven hundred stars.
Tycho Brahe’s accurate and extensive observational records proved invaluable
for his assistant Johannes Kepler (1571–1630). Kepler is remembered for the
three laws of planetary motion from his New astronomy (1609) and The harmony
of the world (1619). Tycho’s data had led him to consider non-circular orbits,
and Kepler proposed that:
1. the planets move in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus;
2. the line from the sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times;
3. the square of a planet’s period is proportional to the cube of its orbit’s

Kepler was indeed fascinated by ellipses and other conics, and introduced
the word ‘focus’ into mathematics. By summing thin discs he determined
the volumes of over ninety solids obtained by rotating conics and other
curves around an axis, thereby foreshadowing the development of the
integral calculus. Kepler was also interested in polyhedra, discovering the
cuboctahedron and the antiprisms, and his name is associated with the
‘Kepler-Poinsot star polyhedra’. He claimed that the five regular solids fit
snugly between the orbits of the six known planets: a cube between Saturn
and Jupiter, a tetrahedron between Jupiter and Mars, and so on.
Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) taught mathematics in Padua. He was the first
astronomer to make extensive use of the telescope, discovering sunspots and
the moons of Jupiter and drawing the moon’s surface. In his mechanics book
Two new sciences (1638) he discussed the laws of uniform and accelerated
motion and explained why the path of a projectile must
be a parabola.

Calendars
B
efore the time of the Romans many different calendars were in use. As
early as 4000 BC the Egyptians used a 365-day solar-based calendar of
twelve 30-day months and five extra days added by the god Thoth. The
Greek, Chinese and Jewish lunar-based calendars consisted of 354 days with
extra days added at intervals, while the early Roman year had just 304 days.
In 700 BC this was extended to 355 days, with the addition of the two new
months Januarius and Februarius.
In 45 BC Julius Caesar introduced his ‘Julian calendar’. This had 3651⁄4 days,
the fraction being taken care of by adding an extra ‘leap day’ every four
years. The beginning of the year was moved to January and the lengths of
the months alternated between 30 and 31 days (apart from a 29-day February
in non-leap years); this was later changed by Augustus Caesar who stole a
day from February to add to August and altered September to December
accordingly.
Later writers determined the length of the solar year with increasing
accuracy. In particular, the Islamic scholars Omar Khayyam and Ulugh Beg
independently measured it as about 365 days, 5 hours and 49 minutes—just
a few seconds out.
The Julian year was thus 11 minutes too long, and by 1582 the calendar had
drifted by ten days with respect to the seasons. In that year Pope Gregory
XIII issued an Edict of Reform, removing the extra days. He corrected the
over-length year by omitting three leap days every 400 years, so that 2000
was a leap year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. The Gregorian calendar
was quickly adopted by the Catholic World and other countries eventually
followed suit: Protestant Germany and Denmark in 1700, Britain and the
American colonies in 1752, Russia in 1917, and China in 1949.
Meanwhile, the line from which time is measured (0° longitude) was located
at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich in 1884, giving rise to an international
date line near Tonga. In 1972, atomic time replaced earth time as the official
standard, and the year was officially measured as 290,091,200,500,000,000
oscillations of atomic caesium.

Calculating Numbers
T
he invention of printing in the fifteenth century led to the standardisation
of mathematical notation. The arithmetical symbols  and  first
appeared in a 1489 arithmetic text by Johann Widmann and the equals sign
was introduced in a 1557 algebra book by Robert Record. The symbols
 and  were introduced, respectively, by William Oughtred in 1631 and
John Pell in 1668.
These improvements in notation went hand in hand with developments in
calculation. The Flemish mathematician Simon Stevin (1548–1620) wrote a
popular book De thiende [The tenth] that explained decimal fractions,
advocated their widespread use for everyday calculation, and proposed a
decimal system of weights and measures. Stevin also wrote an important
treatise on statics that included the first explicit use of the triangle of forces.
Johan de Witt (1625–1672) was a talented mathematician and political leader
whose concern with Holland’s financial problems led to his writing a treatise
on the calculation of life annuity payments, an early attempt to apply
probability theory to economics. His important text Elementa curvarum
linearum [Elements of linear curves] was one of the earliest accounts of
analytic geometry. He was murdered by an angry mob for political reasons.
In 1614 the Scottish laird John Napier (1550–1617) introduced a form of
natural logarithms as an aid to mathematical calculation, being designed to
replace lengthy calculations involving multiplications and divisions by
easier ones using additions and subtractions. Being somewhat awkward to
use, they were soon supplanted by Henry Briggs’s simpler logarithms to
base 10, whose use proved an enormous boon to astronomers and navigators.
Later, in the 1790s, the Slovenian Jurij Vega (1754–1802) published a
celebrated compendium of logarithms, as well as seven-figure and ten-figure
logarithm tables that ran to several hundred editions. He also calculated 
to 140 decimal places.
The invention of logarithms quickly led to the development of instruments
based on a logarithmic scale. Most notable among these was the slide rule,
versions of which first appeared around 1630 and were
widely used for over three hundred years until the advent
of the pocket calculator.

Seventeenth-Century France
T
he major mathematical figures in seventeenth-century France were René
Descartes, Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal. The first two of these
introduced algebraic methods into geometrical problems, starting a change
of emphasis that would reach its climax with the work of Leonhard Euler
(see page 58).
The most celebrated work of René Descartes (1596–1650) was his 1637
Discours de la méthode [Discourse on method], a philosophical treatise on
universal science that contains his well-known statement ‘I think, therefore
I am’. The Discours has a 100-page appendix, La géométrie, containing his
fundamental contributions to analytic geometry. An ancient geometrical
problem of Pappus (c.300 AD) had asked for the path traced by a point
moving in a specified way relative to a number of fixed lines. Descartes
named two particular lengths x and y and calculated all the other lengths in
terms of them, thereby obtaining a conic (parabola, ellipse or hyperbola) as
the required path. Thus Descartes introduced algebraic methods into
geometry, but he did not initiate the Cartesian coordinates (with axes at right
angles) usually named after him. He also analysed various curves, such as
the so-called folium of Descartes with equation x3  y3  3axy, and invented
a ‘rule of signs’ for locating the roots of a given polynomial.
Although Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665) also studied analytic geometry, he is
mainly known for his contributions to number theory. These include his
famous claim to have proved Fermat’s last theorem, that for any n  2 there
are no non-trivial integer solutions x, y and z of the equation xn  yn  zn.
This was eventually proved by Andrew Wiles in 1995.
Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) showed an early interest in mathematics. At the
age of 16, he stated his ‘hexagon theorem’ about six points on a conic joined
in a certain way. He built a calculating machine that could add and subtract,
wrote a treatise on binomial coefficients (‘Pascal’s triangle’), and investigated
the theory of probability, atmospheric pressure (‘Pascal’s principle’ in
hydrodynamics), and the properties of such curves as the cycloid (the arch-
like path traced out by a piece of mud on a bicycle tyre).

Isaac Newton
T
he story of Isaac Newton and the apple is well known. Seeing an apple
fall, he realised that the gravitational force that pulls the apple to earth
is the same as the force that keeps the moon orbiting around the earth and
the earth orbiting around the sun. This planetary motion is governed by a
universal law of gravitation, the ‘inverse-square law’: the force of attraction
between two objects varies as the product of their masses and inversely as
the square of the distance between them; thus, if the distance is doubled,
the force decreases by a factor of four. In his Principia mathematica (1687),
possibly the greatest scientific work of all time, Newton used this law to
explain Kepler’s three laws of elliptical planetary motion and account for
cometary orbits, the variation of tides, and the flattening of the earth at the
north and south poles due to the earth’s rotation.
Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was born in the tiny hamlet of Woolsthorpe in
Lincolnshire in England. After attending the nearby King’s School in
Grantham, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he avidly studied
contemporary works such as a Latin edition of Descartes’ La géométrie and
a book of John Wallis on infinite series. Inspired by the latter work he
produced, while still an undergraduate, the infinite series expansion for the
binomial expression (a  b)m/n—not the finite version featured on the stamp
opposite, which had been known centuries earlier. Newton was later
appointed Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge, a post currently
held by Stephen Hawking.
During the seventeenth century much progress had been made on the two
branches of the infinitesimal calculus, the seemingly unrelated areas now
called ‘differentiation’ (finding the rate at which objects move or change)
and ‘integration’ (finding the area enclosed by a curve). It was gradually
becoming realised that these processes are inverse to each other: for example,
integrating a function and then differentiating the result yields our original
function. During the years 1665 to 1667, Newton explored the rules of
differentiation and integration and explained for the first time why the
inverse relationship between these processes holds.

Reactions to Newton
R
eactions to Newton’s Principia mathematica were mixed. In England the
book was well received, even though few readers understood it, and its
reception in the Netherlands was equally positive. In France, the poet and
philosopher François-Marie Arouet de Voltaire (1694–1778) enthusiastically
supported Newton’s work, and his mistress, Emilie du Châtelet, produced
a French translation of the Principia that is still in use today.
However, not everyone in France was receptive. The Principia was long and
difficult and raised awkward questions concerning the shape of the earth.
Descartes had earlier proposed a ‘vortex theory’ of the universe, claiming
that the planets are swept around the heavens in vortices, like corks in a
whirlpool. A consequence of this theory was that the earth’s rotation causes
a slight elongation at the poles, so that the earth is ‘lemon-shaped’. Newton
had criticised the vortex theory in his Principia, predicting a flattening of the
earth at the poles, so that the earth is ‘onion-shaped’.
National pride was at stake, and settling the matter had become urgent since
inaccurate map-making had led to the loss of many lives at sea. Eventually,
in 1735, two geodetic missions were dispatched to settle the matter by
measuring the swing of a pendulum at the equator and near the North Pole.
One mission, led by Charles Marie de la Condamine, went to Peru and
included the Spanish cosmographer Jorge Juan (1712–1774); the other, led
by Pierre de Maupertuis, travelled to Lapland. These missions confirmed
that Newton’s theory was indeed correct: the earth is flattened at the poles.
Meanwhile, Newton’s work was being criticised on another front. The Irish
Bishop George Berkeley (1685–1753) was a vehement and highly competent
critic of Newtonian science who sought to show that Newton’s universe was
built on quicksand. In his 1734 book The analyst, he unleashed a devastating
attack on Newton’s calculus, arguing in particular that Newton’s fluxions
(derivatives) were logically unsound and that his higher derivatives were
the ‘ghosts of departing quantities’. These difficulties were not satisfactorily
resolved until the nineteenth century.

A
lthough Newton could justly claim priority for the calculus, Gottfried
Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716), who developed it independently, was the
first to publish it. His notation, including the integral sign , was more
versatile than Newton’s and is still used today. Leibniz’s calculus was different
from Newton’s, being based on sums and differences rather than velocity and
motion, and was part of a tradition of continental mathematics that extended
from Christiaan Huygens via the Bernoulli family to Leonhard Euler.
The scientific contributions of Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695) were many
and varied. He expounded the wave theory of light, hypothesised that Saturn
has a ring, and invented the pendulum clock and spiral watch spring. In
mathematics he wrote the first formal probability text, introducing the
concept of ‘expectation’, and he analysed such curves as the cycloid and
catenary (the shape formed by a hanging chain).
The Bernoulli family included several distinguished mathematicians. In his
Ars conjectandi [Art of conjecturing], Jakob Bernoulli (1654–1705) proved the
‘law of large numbers’ that asserts that if an experiment is performed often,
there is a high probability that the outcome is as expected; for example, if a
fair coin is tossed two million times, the number of heads will probably be
close to one million. With his brother Johann he was among the first to
develop Leibniz’s calculus and apply it to polar coordinates and the study
of curves such as the catenary; he also invented the term ‘integral’.
Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) taught in St Petersburg and Berlin and was
probably the most prolific mathematician of all time. He reformulated the
calculus using the idea of a function, and contributed to number theory,
differential equations and the geometry of surfaces. Euler introduced the
notations e ( 2.718 . . .), i (1
),  (summation) and f(x) (a function 
of x), and related the exponential and trigonometrical functions by means
of the fundamental equation ei  cos   i sin . He also found the
‘polyhedron formula’ relating the numbers of vertices, edges and faces of a
polyhedron:
(vertices)  (edges)  (faces)  2;
for the icosahedron shown opposite, 12  30  20  2.

Halley’s Comet
E
dmond Halley (1656–1742) is primarily remembered for the comet whose
return he predicted and which is named after him.
While still an undergraduate at Oxford University, Halley sailed to St Helena,
an island 16° south of the equator, to explore the skies of the southern
hemisphere and prepare the first accurate catalogue of the stars in the
southern sky. On his return he was elected to the Royal Society of London
where he spent the next twenty-five years, conversing with other scientists
and carrying out his researches into the solar system, comets and geophysics.
In the 1680s Halley persuaded Isaac Newton to develop his ideas on
gravitation and publish them in the Principia mathematica; Halley himself
paid for the publication. In 1704 he succeeded John Wallis as Savilian
professor of geometry in Oxford, where he prepared a definitive edition of
Apollonius’ Conics. Following John Flamsteed’s death in 1719, Halley
became Astronomer Royal and thereafter spent most of his time at the
Greenwich observatory.
The earliest recorded appearances of Halley’s comet were in 240 BC when
it was reported by Chinese astronomers, and in 164 BC when Babylonian
astronomers made nightly observations in their astronomical diaries.
Thereafter the comet has reappeared every 75 to 80 years. It made a
spectacular return in 1066, being depicted at the top of the Bayeux tapestry
of the Norman conquest with the phrase Isti mirant stella [They wonder at
the star]. The comet’s appearance in 1301 inspired the Italian painter Giotto
to include it in his painting Adoration of the magi.
Halley himself observed the comet in 1682, and realised that it was the same
one that had been seen in 1531 and 1607. In 1705 he predicted its return in
late 1758 or early 1759, and its appearance on Christmas Day 1758, several
years after Halley’s death, did much to vindicate Newton’s theory of
gravitation. It was on the basis of this prediction that the comet came to be
named ‘Halley’s comet’.

Longitude
T
o determine latitude north or south of the equator a mariner simply
measured the angle between the sun or pole star and the horizon.
However, to determine longitude east or west of home he had to compare
local time with the same time at home: each hour’s difference corresponds
to 15° longitude, or about 1000 miles at the equator. Thus, accurate clocks
were required that could be used on board a rolling ship, unaffected by
changes in temperature and involving no hanging weights. Many lives were
lost through inaccurate longitude readings, and in 1714 the British
Parliament set up the ‘Board of Longitude’ which offered a £20,000 prize for
a reliable timepiece.
In the absence of accurate chronometers, astronomical methods had been
sought by Huygens, Newton, Halley and others. Galileo discovered a
method based on eclipses of the moons of Jupiter and Jean-Dominique
Cassini (1625–1712) obtained extensive tables of such eclipses. But it was
the chronometers of John Harrison (1693–1776) that won the day. Over a
period of forty years he constructed five timekeepers of increasing
complexity. The first, Harrison’s chronometer No. 1 (or H1), was used on a
voyage to Lisbon in 1735, during which it erred by only a few seconds.
Eventually, after much prevarication by the Board of Longitude, the prize
was awarded to Harrison for his last chronometer (H5).
Meanwhile, world exploration had been continuing apace. Louis de
Bougainville (1729–1811) made the first French circumnavigation of the
world; trained in mathematics he wrote a treatise on the integral calculus.
The South American plant ‘bougainvillea’, which he introduced to Europe,
is named after him.
James Cook (1728–1779) made three major voyages. His first was a Royal
Society expedition to Tahiti to observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the
sun, a rare occurrence of great astronomical value; on his return trip he
discovered New Zealand. On his second voyage, to Antarctica in 1772, he
took Kendall’s chronometer, an exact copy of Harrison’s fourth timekeeper
(H4), and praised it highly. Cook’s third voyage ended in disaster when he
was killed by the islanders of Hawaii.

T
he founders of American independence included several highly learned
people who encouraged the study of mathematics and the sciences in the
late eighteenth century.
Benjamin Franklin (1706–90) invented the Franklin stove, bifocal spectacles,
the odometer and the lightning rod. He also carried out experiments 
in electricity, such as the celebrated one on lightning conduction in which he
flew a kite in a thunderstorm. Although never claiming to be a mathematician,
he was fascinated by magic squares and constructed a remarkable 16  16
square in which the sum of the sixteen numbers in any row, column or
diagonal, or even in any 4  4 sub-square, has the value 2056.
Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), the third president of the United States,
extolled the virtues of science and wrote of the importance of calculation:
extracting square and cube roots, solving quadratic equations and using
logarithms. Interested in the theory and practice of classical architecture, he
designed his home, Monticello, and the central rotunda of the University of
Virginia. While ambassador in Paris he became interested in the metric
system being proposed in France (see page 108), and strongly advocated the
decimalisation of the American coinage.
Benjamin Banneker (1731–1826) was a self-taught mathematician and
astronomer. When 22 years old, he designed and built an accurate striking
clock, although he had never seen one previously. In later life he immersed
himself in astronomy and constructed accurate astronomical tables. In 1791
he compiled the first of several almanacs, as ‘the creation of a free man of
the African race’, and sent it to Jefferson with a plea to end slavery. Banneker
was appointed by George Washington, himself a noted surveyor, to help
with the surveying and layout of the new capital city.
James Garfield (1831–1881), the twentieth president of the United States,
was also a keen amateur mathematician. He devised a simple but ingenious
proof of Pythagoras’ theorem, which later appeared in school textbooks.

France and the Enlightenment
D
uring the seventeenth century mathematicians and scientists increasingly
exchanged and communicated their ideas through publications and
meetings. This led to the creation of societies and academies, such as the
French Académie des Sciences, founded in 1666. Under the long secretaryship
of Bernard Fontanelle (1657–1757), the Académie helped to pave the way for
the scientific ideas of the Enlightenment in France.
Jean Le Rond d’Alembert (1717–1783) was a leading Enlightenment figure.
He stated the ratio test for the convergence of an infinite series and attempted
to formalise the idea of a limit in order to put the calculus on a firm basis.
He was also the first to obtain the wave equation that describes the motion
of a vibrating string. In his later years he wrote many of the mathematical
and scientific articles for Denis Diderot’s Encyclopédie, which attempted to
classify the knowledge of the time.
The members of the Académie included Georges Louis Leclerc, Comte de 
Buffon (1707–1788) and Marie-Jean Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet (1743–
1794). Buffon is best remembered for his ‘needle experiment’ which can be
used to estimate  experimentally: if we throw N needles of length L randomly
onto a grid of parallel lines at distance d apart, then the expected number 
of needles crossing a line is 2NL/d. Condorcet’s main contributions were to
probability theory and the study of voting patterns. After the French
Revolution he was arrested while fleeing for his life and died in captivity.
Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736–1813) was Euler’s successor at the court of
Frederick the Great in Berlin. He wrote the first ‘theory of functions’, using
the idea of a power series to make the calculus more rigorous, and his
mechanics text Méchanique analytique was highly influential. In number
theory he proved that every positive integer can be written as the sum of
four perfect squares: for example, 79  49  25  4  1.
Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827) wrote an important text on the analytical
theory of probability and is also remembered for the ‘Laplace transform’ of
a function. His monumental five-volume work on celestial mechanics, Traité
de méchanique céleste, earned him the title of ‘the Newton
of France’.

The French Revolution
O
ut of the turbulent years of the French Revolution and the rise to power
of Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821) came important developments in
mathematics. Napoleon himself was an enthusiast for mathematics and 
its teaching, and there are even a couple of geometrical results (one
involving triangles and the other involving circles) each known as
‘Napoleon’s theorem’.
One of Napoleon’s greatest supporters was his close friend, the geometer
Gaspard Monge (1746–1818), who accompanied him on the Egyptian
expedition of 1798. Monge taught at the military school in Mézières, where
he studied the properties of lines and planes in three-dimensional Cartesian
geometry. While investigating possible positionings for gun emplacements
in a fortress, he greatly improved on the known methods for projecting three-
dimensional objects on to a plane; this subject soon became known as
‘descriptive geometry’. Monge’s other interests included ‘differential
geometry’, in which calculus techniques are used to study curves drawn on
surfaces, and he wrote the first important textbook on the subject.
A military genius appointed by Napoleon was the engineer Lazare Carnot
(1755–1823), who studied under Monge at Mézières. He wrote an influential
work on the ‘geometry of position’, in which he developed the use of vectors
(‘sensed magnitudes’) in geometry, and was the first to assert that kinetic
energy must be lost when imperfectly elastic bodies collide.
Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857) was the most important analyst of the
early nineteenth century. He transformed the whole area of real analysis,
providing a rigorous treatment of the calculus by formalising the concepts
of limit, continuity, derivative and integral. In addition, he almost 
single-handedly developed the subject of complex analysis; ‘Cauchy’s
integral formula’ appears on the stamp opposite.
An important consequence of the French Revolution was the founding of
the École Polytechnique in Paris. There the country’s finest mathematicians,
including Monge, Laplace, Lagrange and Cauchy, taught students destined
to serve in both military and civilian capacities. The
textbooks from the École Polytechnique were later widely
used in France and the United States.

The Liberation of Geometry
C
arl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) was one of the greatest mathematicians
of all time. He lived in Göttingen and worked in many areas, ranging
from complex numbers (numbers of the form a  bi, where i2  1) and the
factorisation of polynomials to astronomy and electricity. He investigated
the construction of polygons with ruler and compass and proved that a
regular n-sided polygon can be constructed when n is a ‘Fermat prime
number’ of the form 22k  1, such as 17 or 65,537. He also claimed to have
discovered a ‘non-Euclidean geometry’, but published nothing on this.
Euclid’s Elements (see page 10) commences with five ‘postulates’. Four of
these are straightforward, but the fifth postulate is different in style,
resembling a theorem that ought to be provable from the others. It states
that if two lines include angles x and y whose sum is less than 180°, then
these lines must meet if extended indefinitely (fig. a). This result is equivalent
to the ‘parallel postulate’, that given any line l and any point p not lying on
l, there is a line parallel to l that passes through p (fig. b).
(a)
(b)
(c)
For over two thousand years mathematicians had tried to deduce this result
from the first four postulates, but were unable to do so. This is because there
are ‘geometries’ that satisfy the first four postulates but not the fifth. Such
geometries have infinitely many lines parallel to l that pass through p (fig.
c). They are now known as ‘non-Euclidean geometries’ and their existence
was first published in the nineteenth century by the Russian mathematician
Nikolai Lobachevsky (1792–1856) and the Hungarian János Bolyai (1802–
1860). When Bolyai’s father Farkas outlined János’s work to his friend Gauss,
the latter dismissed it as something he had already discovered; the Bolyais
never forgave Gauss for this.

The Liberation of Algebra
S
ince Babylonian times, people had been able to solve quadratic equations
using only arithmetic operations and the taking of roots, and in the
sixteenth century Italian mathematicians developed similar solutions to cubic
equations (of degree 3) and quartic equations (of degree 4). The search for a
general solution to equations of degree 5 or more occupied the finest
mathematicians (such as Descartes, Euler and Lagrange), but little progress
was made until the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel (1802–1829)
proved that no such general solution can exist. A monument to Abel by the
Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigelund was erected in Oslo in 1908.
Abel’s work was continued by the brilliant young French mathematician
Évariste Galois (1811–1832), who determined which equations can be solved.
Galois had a short and turbulent life, being sent to jail for political activism
and dying tragically in a duel at the age of 20, having sat up the previous
night writing out his mathematical achievements for posterity.
A breakthrough of a different nature occurred with the discovery of 
‘noncommutative systems’, where a  b may differ from b  a. William Rowan
Hamilton (1805–1865) was a child prodigy who mastered several languages
by the age of 14, discovered an error in Laplace’s treatise on celestial mechanics
while a teenager, and became Astronomer Royal of Ireland and Director of the
Dunsink Observatory in Dublin while an undergraduate. Attempting to
generalise the complex numbers, Hamilton discovered the non-commutative
‘quaternions’, expressions of the form
a  bi  cj  dk, where i2  j2  k2  1 and ij  ji, jk  –kj, ik  ki.
Integers can be factorised as a products of prime numbers in only one way
(for example, 60  22  3  5), but numbers of other forms may factorise in
several ways (for example, 2  5  (4  6)  (4  6)). To circumvent
this difficulty, Richard Dedekind (1831–1916) invented the concept of an
‘ideal’; the stamp opposite shows the unique factorisation of an ideal as a
product of ‘prime ideals’.
The Oxford mathematician Charles Dodgson (1832–1898), better known as
Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,
also wrote books on the algebra of determinants, Euclidean
geometry and symbolic logic.

e have already noted several contributions to probability and statistics:
Johan de Witt’s applications of probability to economics, Christiaan
Huygens’ formal probability text, Jakob Bernoulli’s ‘law of large numbers’,
Buffon’s ‘needle experiment’ for estimating , Condorcet’s theory of voting,
and the fundamental contributions of Laplace that led to his monumental
Théorie analytique des probabilités [Analytic theory of probability].
In the early nineteenth century, the ‘method of least squares’ was developed
by Adrien Marie Legendre and Carl Friedrich Gauss. Given a range of data
arising from an experiment, the aim is to find the curve of a given type (such
as a straight line or quadratic curve) that most closely fits these data; this is
illustrated on the Australian stamp opposite. Gauss was led to this method
while trying to predict the orbit of the newly discovered asteroid Ceres.
Adolphe Quetelet (1796–1874) was supervisor of statistics for Belgium,
pioneering techniques for taking the national census. His desire to find the
statistical characteristics of an ‘average man’ led to his compiling the chest
measurements of 5732 Scottish soldiers and observing that the results were
distributed normally around a mean of 40 inches. Taken with earlier studies
of life annuity payments by Johan de Witt and Edmond Halley, Quetelet’s
investigations helped to lay the foundations of modern actuarial science.
Florence Nightingale (1820–1910) was strongly influenced by the work of
Quetelet. Mainly remembered as the ‘lady with the lamp’ who saved many
lives through her sanitary improvements in hospitals during the Crimean
War, she was also a fine statistician who collected and analysed mortality
data from the Crimea and displayed them using her ‘polar diagrams’, a
forerunner of the pie chart.
A number of stamps have featured statistical themes—for example:
• an Egyptian stamp featuring Amenhotep (see page 4), issued for a 1927
statistical congress in Cairo;
• population graphs portraying the age distribution of men and women in
various years;
• a graph of the Norwegian gross national product from
1876 to 1976.

T
he first missionary in China was the Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci (1552–
1610), who disseminated knowledge of western science—especially in
mathematics, astronomy and geography. His most important contribution
was an oral Chinese translation of the first six books of Euclid’s Elements,
which was recorded by Xu Guangqi (1562–1633), Grand Secretary of the
Wen Yuan Institute and ‘the first man in China after the monarch himself’.
By the time of Ricci’s arrival near the end of the Ming dynasty, the calendar
of Guo Shoujing (see page 16) had become very inaccurate; Xu Guangqi was
appointed to direct its reform.
In 1742 Christian Goldbach wrote to Leonhard Euler conjecturing that every
even integer can be written as the sum of two prime numbers (for example,
18  13  5 and 20  17  3). Although Goldbach’s conjecture remains
unresolved, a partial result of Chen Jing-Run (1966), shown on the stamp
opposite, implies that every sufficiently large even integer can be written as
the sum of a prime number and a number with at most two prime factors.
Number theory was also the province of Hua Loo-Keng [Hua Luogeng]
(1910–1985), who wrote important texts on the subject. During the Cultural
Revolution of 1966–1976, he travelled widely through China lecturing on
industrial mathematics to audiences of up to 100,000 factory workers.
Determinants are algebraic expressions that arise in the solution of systems
of simultaneous linear equations. The Japanese mathematician Takakazu Seki
(1642–1708), also known as ‘Seki Kowa’, was the first mathematician to
investigate determinants, a few years before Leibniz (who is usually given
priority) contributed to the subject. In 1683 Seki explained how to calculate
determinants up to size 5  5, and the Japanese stamp shows his diagram for
calculating the products that arise in the evaluation of 4  4 determinants.
The Japanese abacus, or ‘soroban’, appears in a detail from the Three beauties
by Toyokuni Utagawa, around 1800. The stamp opposite was issued for the
Thirteenth World Congress of Certified Public Accountants in Tokyo in 1987.
Shogi, also called ‘the game of the generals’, is a Japanese

T
he nineteenth and twentieth centuries produced many fine Russian
mathematicians, such as Nikolai Lobachevsky, co-founder of non-Euclidean
geometry (see page 70).
Mikhail Ostrogradsky (1801–1861) took up mathematics to finance his
ambition of becoming an army officer. While studying in Paris, he worked
in mathematical physics, proving the ‘divergence theorem’, often ascribed
to Gauss. He later achieved his ambition by teaching mathematics in the
Russian military academies.
A generation later was Pafnuty Chebyshev (1821–1894), remembered mainly
for his work on orthogonal functions (‘Chebyshev polynomials’), probability
(‘Chebyshev’s inequality’), and prime numbers. He founded the St
Petersburg School of Mathematics. Aleksandr Lyapunov (1857–1918) was
much influenced by Chebyshev. He worked on the stability of rotating
liquids and the theory of probability. In 1918 his wife died of tuberculosis;
Lyapunov shot himself the same day and died shortly after.
Nikolai Zhukovsky (1847–1921) studied the flow of a fluid inside and
around solid objects. Considered ‘the father of Russian aviation’, he analysed
the flow of air around an aeroplane wing, thereby making it possible to solve
the problem of lift. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (1857–1935), a pioneer of rocket
flight, invented multi-stage rockets and produced a celebrated law that
relates the velocity and the mass of a rocket in flight.
The mathematician and novelist Sonya Kovalevskaya (1850–1891) made
valuable contributions to mathematical analysis and partial differential
equations. Barred by her gender from studying in Russia, she went to
Heidelberg, attending lectures of Kirchhoff and Helmholtz, and to Berlin,
later becoming the first female professor in Stockholm. She won the coveted
Prix Bordin of the French Academy for a memoir on the rotation of bodies.

u ¯der Bosˇcovi´c [Ruggiero Boscovich] (1771–1787) was born in Ragusa
(now Dubrovnik). He was interested in astronomy, gravitation,
trigonometry and optics, and was the first to compute a planet’s orbit from
just three observations of its position. Bosˇcovi´c anticipated later atomic
theory by regarding atoms, not as hard indivisible entities as Democritus
had assumed (see page 6), but as centres of force. He also developed an early
version of the method of least squares in statistics.
Bernhard Bolzano (1781–1848) was born in Prague. Like Cauchy (see page
68), he was instrumental in formalising the idea of a continuous function
(one whose graph has no ‘jumps’), and proved the ‘intermediate value
theorem’, that the graph of a continuous function takes on all values between
the lowest and highest points. He also obtained a function that is continuous
everywhere but differentiable nowhere (every point is a ‘corner’). Living in
Prague, he was isolated from the mainstream of European mathematical
activity and his contributions unfortunately had little impact.
Hermann Oberth (1894–1989), shown opposite explaining an aspect of
planetary theory, was born in Transylvania, now Romania. He published
theories on how a rocket could function in a vacuum and explained that,
given sufficient thrust, a rocket could encircle the earth.
The Union of Czechoslovak Mathematicians and Physicists was founded in
1862, and its 125th anniversary was commemorated by a set of three stamps.
One of these features the Prague astronomical clock and a computer graphic
from the theory of functions, superimposed on a result from real analysis.
The Romanian monthly Gazeta matematica was first published in 1895.
With its aim of developing the mathematical knowledge of high-school
students, it has had an enormous influence on mathematical life in Romania.

over fifty years, was issued in 1995.

Mathematical Physics

f a compass needle is placed near a wire that carries electrical current, it
is deflected. This observation, relating electricity and magnetism, led to
the subject of ‘electromagnetism’. Two French mathematical physicists who
made early contributions in this area were André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836)
and François Arago (1786–1833). Ampère is best remembered for his work
in electricity: the SI unit of current flow is named after him. He was the first
to apply advanced mathematics to magnetic and electrical phenomena, and
‘Ampère’s law’ relates the magnetic field between two wires to the product
of the currents in them. Arago taught analytic geometry at the École
Polytechnique (see page 68), and worked on mechanical linkages, magnetism
and the polarisation of light.
In 1850 another French physicist, Jean Foucault (1819–1868) carried out his
famous pendulum experiment, designed to show the rotation of the earth
on its axis. A 28kg ball was suspended from the dome of the Panthéon in
Paris and allowed to swing. As the earth rotated, the swinging pendulum’s
path gradually shifted, finally returning to its starting point 24 hours later.
Foucault also measured the velocity of light using a rapidly rotating mirror.
In Germany, the astronomer and mathematician Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel
(1784–1846) made measurements on over 50,000 stars and was the first to
determine interstellar distances accurately by using the method of parallax.
In 1817, while investigating a problem of Kepler, he introduced the Bessel
functions Jn(x) which satisfy a certain second-order differential equation. The
German stamp opposite features the graphs of the Bessel functions J0(x) and
J1(x). Bessel functions have wide application throughout physics—notably
in acoustics (the vibration of a drum) and electromagnetism.
Bessel functions also arise in the solution of Helmholtz’s wave equation
when cylindrical or spherical symmetry is involved. Hermann von Helm-
holtz (1821–1894) was a German/Prussian physicist, mathematician and
biologist who invented the ophthalmoscope for viewing the eye’s retina,
formulated the general law of the conservation of energy, and wrote
extensively on the mathematics of sound and electromagnetic waves.

The Nature of Light
I
n 1831 Michael Faraday carried out his famous experiments that led to the
discovery of ‘electromagnetic induction’, where electricity is induced by
changes in a magnetic field.
Using the most advanced vector methods of his day, James Clerk Maxwell
(1831–1879) synthesised Faraday’s laws of electromagnetism into a coherent
mathematical theory, confirming Faraday’s intuition that light consists of
electromagnetic waves. His celebrated Treatise on electricity and magnetism,
containing the fundamental mathematical laws of electromagnetism now
known as ‘Maxwell’s equations’, predicted the existence of such phenomena
as radio waves. Heinrich Hertz (1857–1894) confirmed this: his ‘Hertzian
waves’ later formed the basis of Marconi’s work on radio telegraphy.
Hendrik Lorentz (1853–1928) showed how Maxwell’s electromagnetic waves
interact with matter consisting of atoms within which are distributions of
electric charge. He predicted that magnetic fields modify the spectral lines of
atoms; this was confirmed by his pupil Pieter Zeeman, with whom he shared
the 1902 Nobel Prize for Physics.
Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory of light, and experiments on the newly
invented light bulb, led scientists to consider how atoms emit light. At first
it seemed that all the light should have very high frequency. Reconciling
theory with experiment, Max Planck (1858–1947) announced the first steps
towards ‘quantum theory’ by postulating that atoms can emit light only in
small packets (called ‘quanta’) whose energy E is proportional to their
frequency 	—thus, E  h	, where h is ‘Planck’s constant’. Lacking sufficient
energy to make many high-frequency packets, atoms would be forced to
radiate at lower frequencies instead.
In 1905 Albert Einstein (1879–1955) explained the ‘photoelectric effect’, that
light behaves like particles and can liberate electrons on impact with a metal
surface. Einstein’s paper, which led to his 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics,
showed that Planck’s equation E = h	 is a fundamental feature of light itself,
rather than of the atoms. Despite the many experiments
that show light to consist of waves, it also behaves as
though it consists of particles, each carrying one quantum
(h	) of energy.

Einstein’s Theory of Relativity
S
ince the eighteenth century it had been assumed that all mechanical
motion throughout the universe, whether of planets, apples or atoms,
satisfies the laws of motion expounded by Isaac Newton in his Principia
mathematica (see page 54). Moreover, these laws still hold for systems moving
at a constant speed relative to each other: thus, if a smoothly moving train
travels at constant speed, the passengers cannot tell whether they are in
motion unless they look out of the window; but if the train accelerates, then
the motion is noticed.
In 1905 Albert Einstein published his ‘special theory of relativity’. Until that
time it had been assumed that Maxwell’s equations (see page 84) are valid
only in a particular frame of reference (that of the ‘ether’ that carries the
waves) and are thus unlike Newton’s laws which hold for all observers in
uniform motion. Einstein reconciled this apparent discrepancy by starting
from the simple postulate that the basic laws of physics (including Maxwell’s
equations) are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one
another.
Thus, Einstein was able to extend Newton’s ideas on mechanics so as to
incorporate electromagnetism and the results of Maxwell. The equations that
Newton had used to get from one frame of reference to another were now
replaced by new ones due to Lorentz. A consequence of these ideas is that
mass is simply a form of energy, and that the energy E and the mass m are
related by the well-known relativity equation E  mc2, where c is the speed
of light.
Ten years later, in his ‘general theory of relativity’, Einstein extended 
his earlier ideas to include accelerated motion and gravity. His starting 
point was the observation that for passengers in a uniformly accelerated
system, such as a spaceship, the perceived force is indistinguishable from
gravity. Einstein’s general theory used some newly developed ideas from
higher-dimensional differential geometry, and in turn stimulated further
developments in that subject.

Quantum Theory
S
hortly after Einstein’s paper on the photoelectric effect, Ernest
Rutherford’s experiments led to the idea of an atom as a ‘miniature solar
system’ in which the electrons orbit around a nucleus. To explain why atoms
radiate light at the particular frequencies observed, Niels Bohr (1885–1962)
proposed that the angular momentum of each orbiting electron must be an
exact multiple of the basic unit h/2.
In 1923 Louis de Broglie (1892–1987) suggested that if light waves can
behave as particles, then perhaps other particles (such as electrons) can also
behave as waves; this was rapidly verified experimentally. In de Broglie’s
theory Bohr’s electron orbits are precisely those whose circumference is an
integer number of wavelengths.
Twenty-five years after Planck’s original quantum hypothesis, physicists still
had no coherent understanding of quantum theory, but in 1925 two
independent discoveries revolutionised the subject. Erwin Schrödinger
(1887–1961) learned of de Broglie’s idea that particles can also behave like
waves, and found the appropriate partial differential equation to describe
these waves. Earlier, Werner Heisenberg (1901–1976) had taken an algebraic
approach, realising that quantum-theoretical quantities such as position,
momentum and energy can be represented by infinite arrays, or ‘matrices’.
Using the fact that matrix multiplication is non-commutative, Heisenberg
deduced his famous ‘Uncertainty Principle’, that it is theoretically impossible
to determine the position and the momentum of an electron at the same time.
In 1928 Paul Dirac (1902–1984) effectively completed classical quantum theory
by deriving an equation for the electron that, unlike those of Schrödinger and
Heisenberg, was consistent with Einstein’s theory of relativity. This equation
explained electron spin, and led him to predict the existence of antiparticles,
such as the positron which was detected four years later. Schrödinger
discovered that, despite the apparent differences, his theory was equivalent
to that of Heisenberg.
In the period 1929 to 1933 Nobel Prizes in Physics were awarded to de
Broglie, Heisenberg, Dirac and Schrödinger for their
contributions to quantum mechanics.

ing Oscar II of Sweden and Norway (1829–1907) was an enthusiastic
patron of mathematics. On his sixtieth birthday he offered a prize of
2500 Swedish crowns for a memoir on mathematical analysis. The winner
was Henri Poincaré (1854–1912), who wrote on the ‘three-body problem’ of
determining the motion of the sun, earth and moon. Arguably the most
brilliant mathematician of his generation, and a gifted populariser of the
subject, Poincaré contributed to many areas of mathematics and physics,
including celestial mechanics, differential equations and algebraic topology.
Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) was one of the outstanding figures of the
twentieth century. One version of his celebrated ‘Russell paradox’ of 1902
asks: ‘in a village the barber shaves all those who don’t shave themselves;
who shaves the barber?’ In 1913 he and A. N. Whitehead completed Principia
mathematica, a pioneering work on the logical foundations of mathematics.
Srinivasa Ramanujan
(1887–1920) was one of the most intuitive
mathematicians of all time. Mainly self-taught, he left India in 1914 to work
in Cambridge with G. H. Hardy, producing some spectacular joint papers in
analysis and number theory before his untimely death at the age of 32. While
visiting him in hospital Hardy remarked that his taxi number 1729 was very
uninteresting. ‘No’, replied Ramanujan, ‘it’s the smallest number we can
write as the sum of two cubes in two ways!’ [1000  729 and 1728  1]
Three analysts featured on stamps are Constantin Carathéodory (1873–1950),
Stefan Banach (1892–1945) and Norbert Wiener (1894-1964). Carathéodory
worked on the theory of functions and the calculus of variations, while Banach
helped to create modern functional analysis and develop links between
topology and algebra; the term ‘Banach space’ is named after him. Wiener
applied his analytical results to statistics and potential theory and invented
‘cybernetics’, the study of communication processes.

The Birth of Computing
T
he first mechanical calculating machines appeared in the seventeenth
century, following the invention of logarithms by John Napier and the
development of the slide rule (see page 50). An early machine was described
by William Schickard in 1623, and later calculating machines were
constructed by Pascal and Leibniz. Pascal’s machine was operated by cogged
wheels and could add and subtract, while Leibniz’ machine could also
multiply and divide; neither machine worked efficiently in practice.
The central figure of nineteenth-century computing was Charles Babbage
(1791–1871), who may be said to have pioneered the modern computer age
with his ‘difference engine’ and ‘analytical engine’. The difference engine, a
digital machine conceived in the 1820s, was a highly complex arrangement
of gears and levers designed to mechanise the calculation of mathematical
tables and print out the results. Although a small working model was built,
a full-scale version was not constructed from Babbage’s detailed drawings
until 1991.
Babbage’s analytical engine can be regarded as the forerunner of the modern
programmable computer, even though it was never actually constructed.
Designed to be run by steam power, it contained a store (or memory) and
was to be programmed by means of punched cards.
The idea of a punched card, with holes punched in specific locations to
convey information, had been used in the ‘Jacquard loom’ of Joseph Marie
Jacquard (1752–1834) in order to mechanise the weaving of complicated
patterns. Data processing with punched cards was developed by Herman
Hollerith for the US population census of 1890, and along with punched
tape, such cards were in widespread use for many years afterwards.
The modern computer age started in the Second World War, with COLOSSUS
in England, used for deciphering German military codes, and ENIAC
[Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer] in the United States. These
machines were large and cumbersome: ENIAC was eight feet high and
contained 17,000 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, 1500
relays and 6000 switches. Inspired by ENIAC, John von
Neumann (1903–1957) contributed to the development of
a ‘stored program computer’ in which the data and
instructions are held in an internal store until needed.

The Development of Computing
S
ince the 1950s computers have developed at an ever-accelerating pace,
with a massive increase in speed and power and a corresponding decrease
in size and cost. They have become so much a part of our everyday life that
it is difficult to remember what life was like beforehand.
The ‘first generation’ of electronic digital computers spanned the 1950s.
These computers stored their programs internally and initially used vacuum
tubes as their switching technology. However, such tubes were bulky, hot
and unreliable, and were gradually replaced in the ‘second generation’ of
computers by transistors. This development in turn gave rise to the problem
of trying to interconnect many thousands of simple circuits to form a system
with sufficient computing power.
The ‘third generation’ of computers, in the late 1960s, saw the solution 
of this problem with the development of printed circuit boards on which
thin strips of copper were ‘printed’, connecting the transistors and other
electronic components. This led to the all-important introduction of the
integrated circuit, an assembly of thousands of transistors, resistors,
capacitors and other devices, all interconnected electronically and packaged
as a single functional item. In the 1970s the first personal computers became
available, for use in the home and office.
The invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s
has led to the information superhighway, whereby all types of information
from around the world are easily accessible. Communications have also been
transformed with the introduction of electronic mail; the Thailand stamp
portrays King Bhumibol checking his e-mail.
Computer-aided design has also developed rapidly, and in 1970 the
Netherlands produced the first set of computer-generated stamp designs;
the stamp opposite shows an isometric projection in which the circles at the
centres of the faces gradually expand and become transformed into squares.

The International Scene
A
s part of the four-hundredth anniversary celebrations of Columbus’s
1492 voyage to America, a World Congress of Mathematicians took place
at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. Only forty-five
mathematicians attended and the opening address, on ‘The present state 
of mathematics’, was given by Felix Klein of Göttingen, one of just four
participants from outside the US. Since that first meeting, more than twenty
international congresses have been held, usually every four years.
In recent times, several of the International Congresses of Mathematics have
been commemorated by stamps. The first of these was the Moscow congress
of 1966, attended by 4000 mathematicians from forty-nine countries. Twelve
years later, the congress in Helsinki attracted delegates from eighty-three
countries and the stamp design featured differential geometry.
In 1982 a set of four stamps was issued to commemorate the International
Congress in Warsaw. This set featured the Polish mathematicians Stefan
Banach (see page 91), Waclaw Sierpinski, Stanislaw Zaremba and Zygmunt
Janiszewski. In the event, the uncertain political situation necessitated the
postponement of the congress to 1983.
The first International Congress to be held outside Europe or North America
took place in Kyoto in 1990. The stamp design shows an origami polyhedron.
In 1994 the congress was held for the third time in Zürich. The commemorative
stamp featured Jakob Bernoulli and his law of large numbers (see page 57).
For the 1998 congress in Berlin the stamp design included a solution of the
‘squaring-the-rectangle’ problem of dividing a rectangle with integer sides 
(in this case, 176 and 177) into unequal squares with integer sides. The
background consisted of spirals made from the decimal digits of .
Other international mathematical events have been commemorated on
stamps, including the Second European Congress of Mathematics, held in
Budapest in 1996. The International Union of Mathematics, supported by
UNICEF, declared the year 2000 as World Mathematical Year, and a number
of countries issued special stamps.

Mathematics and Nature
M
athematics occurs throughout nature—from the arithmetic of sunflowers
and ammonites to the geometry of crystals and snowflakes.
The Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, . . . (see page 28) occurs throughout
nature. If we count the leaves around a plant stem until we find one directly
above our initial leaf, the number of intervening leaves is generally a
Fibonacci number (5 for oak trees, 8 for poplar trees, 13 for willow trees,
etc.). The spiral arrangements of scales on a pine cone similarly exhibit 8
right-hand and 13 left-hand spirals, while much larger Fibonacci numbers
(34, 55, etc.) appear in the spiral arrangements of seeds in a sunflower head.
The ratios of successive terms 1⁄1, 2⁄1, 3⁄2, 5⁄3, . . . of the Fibonacci sequence tend
to a limit, often called the ‘golden ratio’ and equal to 1⁄2(1  5)  1.618. . . .
This ratio arises throughout mathematics: it is the ratio of a diagonal and a
side of a regular pentagon, and a rectangle with sides in this ratio is often
considered to have the most pleasing shape. Moreover, the removal of a square
from one end of a golden rectangle leaves another such rectangle; this process
is shown on the Swiss stamp opposite, which also features the closely related
logarithmic spiral, found on snail shells and ammonites.
The delicate structure of a snowflake has six-fold rotational symmetry—
rotation by 60° leaves the pattern unchanged—and no two snowflakes are
exactly the same. The hexagonal form of snowflakes was recognised by the
Chinese in the second century BC and was later investigated by Johannes
Kepler, René Descartes and others.
There are three regular types of tiling pattern (or tessellation) for the plane:
those formed by equilateral triangles, squares and regular hexagons. The
hexagonal tiling pattern appears in nature in the form of a bees’ honeycomb;
a hexagonal stamp featuring bees on a honeycomb appears on page 111.
As liquids crystallise they assume the form of a polyhedron. There are many
types of crystal shape: fluorite crystals appear as regular octahedra (eight
triangular faces), while lead sulphide crystals appear as cuboctahedra (eight
triangular faces and six square faces) and zinc sulphide
crystals appear as truncated tetrahedra (four triangular
faces and four hexagonal faces).

Twentieth-Century Painting
I
n the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, artists, musicians, poets
and novelists were fascinated with the fourth dimension and how to
portray it. Their interest in mathematical ideas, such as non-Euclidean
geometry, as well as in recent scientific discoveries such as electromagnetic
waves, X-rays and electrons, provoked artists to look at the world in a new
way and record their observations in paintings and sculpture.
Robert Delaunay (1885–1941) rejoiced in the visual impact of colours. In his
1931 painting Rhythme: Joie de vivre the vivid circles represent the haloes
around glowing electric street lights. Interpreting this work, Delaunay 
remarked ‘Tout est halo’ [All is halo], adding that he had never seen a straight
line in his life. Delaunay and his contemporaries were aware of the new
geometries and of the writings of Henri Poincaré (see page 90).
Piet Mondrian (1872–1944) tried to portray the universal mathematical
harmonies behind visual phenomena. In his 1943 painting Broadway 
Boogie-Woogie, the jazz-loving Mondrian created spatial ambiguity by means
of coloured lines in a rectangular arrangement. For years he had shared the
enthusiasms of other artists in trying to portray the fourth dimension, and
in his earlier paintings of white and coloured rectangles separated by straight
black lines, the white space represents the fourth dimension. Eventually he
rejected three-dimensional visual reality as a superficial illusion, believing
that two dimensions represent objects clearly whereas a perspective
representation (implying three dimensions) weakens them. Consequently, he
ensured that all overlapping shapes and all diagonals (which could be
interpreted as three-dimensional) were eliminated from his work.
Optical art stimulates and confuses our visual perception. Victor Vasarely
(1908–1997) was much influenced by the work of Mondrian, and studied
colour theory, perception and illusion. In Vega-chess, he made use of this
illusion by repeating the same motif over and over again, making it difficult
for us to see the picture. The painting, which seems to have no background,
can be hung on the wall with any side at the top, because of its 4-fold
rotational symmetry. His 1975 design Tetcye is similarly
based on symmetry: in this case, 6-fold rotational
symmetry.

The Geometry of Space
T
he geometry of space takes many forms: in the design of buildings, in
the symmetry of bridges, or in the sculptures that decorate our towns
and cities.
The Dutch graphic artist Maurits Escher (1898–1972), the ‘master of optical
illusion’, has had an enormous influence on geometrical art. He is best
known for his intricate tiling patterns of birds and beasts, angels and devils,
or fish and boats. A celebrated example is the 42-foot mural Metamorphose
in the Kerkplein post office in The Hague; the stamp opposite shows Escher
with part of this mural, depicting a tiling arrangement of reptiles. Escher
also designed several postage stamps, including the posthorn design used
for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Postal Union in 1949.
Escher’s three-dimensional designs exhibit a mastery of perspective. Several
incorporate ‘impossible’ features that deliberately distort the scene, showing
staircases that forever ascend or descend, or objects that cannot exist in space.
The Austrian stamp opposite depicts an impossible cube inspired by his
designs, while the Swedish stamps show an impossible triangle and an
impossible object drawn in 1934 by the Swedish artist Oscar Reutersvärd.
Another interesting geometrical object is the Möbius strip, named after the
German mathematician and astronomer August Möbius in 1858. It is shown
opposite and has only one side and one boundary edge. To construct it, take
a long rectangular strip of paper, twist one end of it through 180° and then
glue the ends together.
An attractive three-dimensional sculpture in the form of a Möbius strip is
Continuity by the Swiss architect Max Bill. It can be seen in front of the
Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, and was carved from a single piece of granite
weighing 80 tonnes. Another sculpture, this time in the form of an enormous
helix, is the Brazilian sculpture Expansion, symbolising progress.
A ‘ruled surface’ is a curved surface constructed from closely packed straight
lines, sometimes in the form of a hyperbolic paraboloid. Several buildings
use such surfaces for their roofs; an example is the 
German pavilion constructed for the 1997 world fair in
Montréal.

Mathematical Games
T
he position game of noughts-and-crosses, or ‘tic-tac-toe’, developed in
the nineteenth century from earlier ‘three-in-a-row’ games such as three
men’s morris. Two players take turns to place their symbol ( or ) in a
square and try to get three in a row. Variations involve larger boards (4  4
or 5  5) and three or more dimensions (4  4  4 or 3  3  3  3).
Other board games in which mathematical strategy plays a part are 
fox-and-geese and Chinese checkers. Fox-and-geese, a ‘hunt game’ with
horizontal, vertical and diagonal moves, probably originated around the
fourteenth century. One version has thirteen ‘geese’ who try to catch a ‘fox’;
the fox can jump over the geese and remove them, while the geese try to
surround the fox. Chinese checkers is played by two to six players on a star-
shaped board. The object is to move one’s pieces from one point of the star
to the opposite point while trying to prevent one’s opponents from doing
the same.
Until 1000 AD, most labyrinths were of the classic seven-ring form (see page
15). In the ensuing centuries, they gave rise to increasingly complicated
mazes, which are now to be found everywhere from puzzle books to
ornamental gardens. In the late nineteenth century algorithms for escaping
from a maze were presented by Gaston Tarry and others.
The game of dominoes first came to be widely played in the eighteenth
century. Around 1850 several mathematicians sought the number of different
ways of placing the 28 dominoes (0–0 to 6–6) in a ring, and in 1871 M. Reiss
obtained this number; it is over three million.
The Rubik cube, invented in 1974 by the Hungarian engineer Erno Rubik, is
a 3  3  3 coloured cube whose six faces can be independently rotated so as
to yield 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 different patterns. Given such a pattern,
the object is to restore the original colour of each face. In the early 1980s, when
the Rubik cube craze was at its height, over 100 million cubes were sold and
public cube-solving contests were held in Hungary and elsewhere.
In the past twenty years computers have been developed that play chess
and other games. At first these were rudimentary, but now they regularly
beat the chess masters. Bridge is also a game of strategy;
it is a card game played by four players, and is strongly
based on the theory of probability.

Mathematics Education
W
e have already noted several varied examples of mathematics teaching
and education, at both elementary and advanced levels: the teaching
of scribes and accountants in ancient Egypt, the role of the mathematical arts
at Plato’s Academy, Euclid and his pupils, the role of the ‘quadrivium’ as
part of the curriculum for the first European universities, the appearance of
the first printed mathematical textbooks, Galileo teaching in Padua, the
founding of the École Polytechnique in Paris after the French Revolution, the
education of Sonya Kowalevskaya, Hermann Oberth teaching planetary
theory, and the role of the Gazeta matematica in the teaching of mathematics
in Romania.
A substantial number of stamps have appeared featuring the teaching of
elementary mathematics—for example:
• a stamp from Guinea-Bissau, issued for the International Year of the Child,
illustrating the teaching of the geometry of a circle;
• a Russian stamp, celebrating Communist labour teams, showing a group
of adult workers studying the trigonometry of a triangle;
• a stamp from Swaziland showing primary school children experimenting
with balances;
• a stamp from the British Virgin Islands showing a class learning to use a
computer;
• a stamp from St Lucia, issued for International Literacy Year, showing the
teaching of the names of numbers;
• a stamp from Colombia depicting a children’s counting frame (a simple
form of abacus), widely used for teaching children to count and perform
simple arithmetical calculations;
• a stamp from the Maldive Islands, issued for International Education Year,
illustrating the use of television to teach a class of children the geometry
of a triangle.

Metrication
T
hroughout the centuries various counting systems have been used for
weights and measures. As we have seen, the Babylonians (c.1800 BC)
used a number system based on 60, while the Mayans of 300–1000 had a
mixed calendar system based on 18 and 20. Native American tribes used a
variety of number systems based on 5, 10 and 20, and until 1971 the British
monetary system had 12 pennies in a shilling and 20 shillings in a pound.
The binary system, based entirely on 0 and 1, is used extensively in computer
science.
Shortly after the French Revolution, a commission was set up to standardise
the weights and measures in France and introduce a metric system. The
chairman of this commission was Joseph-Louis Lagrange and its members
included Pierre-Simon Laplace and Gaspard Monge (see pages 66 and 68).
Thomas Jefferson (see page 64), while ambassador in Paris, was impressed
by these events, but it was not until 1866 that the United States Congress
passed a law legalising the use of metric measurements.
Since then, most countries have adopted the metric system and in 1960 the
international SI system (‘Système international’) of units was introduced; the
metre was standardised as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red light
from krypton-86 gas in a vacuum. Even so, some countries, including Britain
and the United States, continue to use archaic systems of weights and measures.
A substantial number of metrication stamps have appeared—for example:
• an allegorical figure representing the French metric system;
• a Brazilian metric ruler;
• a Rumanian stamp demonstrating that a metre is one ten-millionth of the
distance from the north pole to the equator;
• a stamp from Pakistan demonstrating the metric units of weight, 
capacity and length;
• a Ghanaian stamp indicating that a metre of cloth is a little more than 
3 feet 3 inches;
• two Australian cartoon stamps featuring the metric
conversion of length and temperature.

Mathematical Shapes
E
veryone is familiar with the usual rectangular stamps issued by all
countries. However, several countries have produced stamps whose
shapes are more unusual. Such stamps may be issued for decorative reasons,
or may be designed to represent a particular object, such as a rugby ball, a
map of the country or a lunar module. There are even stamps from Tonga
in the shape of a banana, a watermelon and a coconut.
Many countries have issued triangular stamps. The triangles may be
equilateral (either way up) or isosceles right-angled (again, either way up).
Examples of scalene triangles, in which all of the angles and sides are
different, are rare; an early stamp of this type is the scalene triangle issued
by Colombia in 1869.
Although four-sided stamps are normally rectangular, they can also take the
form of other parallelograms or rhombuses. There are also trapezium-shaped
stamps of various kinds; an unusual set from Malaysia consists of stamps
shaped like a lunar module.
A few countries have issued pentagonal stamps. Indonesia and the United
States have produced stamps whose shape is a regular pentagon, while Malta
issued a set of Christmas stamps in the form of an irregular pentagon,
representing the crib at Bethlehem. Hexagonal stamps, in the form of a
honeycomb tessellation and depicting various aspects of bee-keeping, were
issued by the Pitcairn Islands. An early set of octagonal stamps was
produced by Thessaly; these came supplied with four corners that were
removed before mailing.
Many countries have issued circular stamps, often to commemorate sporting
events. Examples include a golf-ball stamp from the Isle of Man and a French
football stamp, and France has also produced a stamp in the shape of a rugby
ball. A set of semi-circular stamps has been produced by Singapore and a
set of elliptical stamps was issued by Sierra Leone.
