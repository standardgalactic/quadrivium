Preface
The goal of the first edition of this book was to provide an introductory 
knowledge of organic and printed electronics to students, engineers, 
and scientists. There are many monographs, dissertations, and 
research papers available for higher-level studies on the topic. Our 
motivation for writing this book was to provide an initial reference 
guide and manual for beginners and a support tool for teachers. 
Such a textbook did not exist two decades ago when some of us first 
encountered this field. The first edition of this book was adopted by 
several universities and technology programs. However, as the field 
kept evolving, we felt that an update to the material would be useful.
	
This second edition of the book keeps the overall structure and 
intention of the first edition, while providing a significant update on 
the chapters and in some cases a complete re-write. This project was, 
once again, a demanding and rewarding group effort. The chapters 
have been contributed by many talented authors, who are all experts 
in their fields. We are greatly indebted to them for the quality of their 
work, their trust and patience, and for transmitting through their 
chapters a working knowledge that is connected to practice.
	
We begin the book by presenting its contents and structure, 
which are the result of a long process as we considered different 
perspectives, including analyses of the educational courses on 
organic electronics in Europe. Besides more technical chapters, 
we chose to introduce topics such as innovation management and 
sustainable development, which are key to making a lasting societal 
contribution.
	
Contributing to the education of scientists and engineers that are 
entering the field of organic and printed electronics is a humbling 
task. We hope that this edition will again be a helpful tool for many 
people to have a smooth start, a companion for learning, or even an 
accompanying reference work in their everyday lives within this 
evolving field.

1.1 Introduction
Organic and printed electronics (OPE) have been developing over 
the past two decades as an enabling set of technologies as well as an 
area of scientific investigations. As we write, hundreds of scientific 
articles are written on the topic yearly, organic light-emitting diodes 
(OLEDs) are ubiquitous in mobile phones, organic photovoltaics are 
being installed in building facades and printed sensors provide key 
functionalities to automobiles.

Organic and Printed Electronics: An Introduction
	
Printed electronics still has a lot of potential to make a larger and 
positive impact on the lives of millions of people. The purpose of this 
book is to provide a first introduction and orientation to the new 
students and professionals approaching this multifaceted field each 
year.
	
Organic semiconductor molecules are at the core of these 
technologies. Conventional inorganic semiconductors rely on the 
specific properties of given elements and their organization in 
space, for instance, in crystalline form. On the other hand, organic 
semiconductor molecules can be designed and engineered to create 
new semiconductor types, for example, with specific color emission 
or absorption properties. This opens many possibilities. Electrical 
conductivity and the modulation of charge transport with thin-
film transistors make it possible to create electronic circuits and 
analog and digital electronics. Light absorption and conversion to 
electricity enable organic photovoltaics for energy collection as 
well as photodiodes for the detection of objects and images. Light 
emission is used in displays and general lighting sources.
	
Organic molecules can be formulated in functional inks, which 
can then be deployed in large-area printing and coating techniques, 
benefiting from hundreds of years of accumulated know-how about 
printing presses, paper, and photographic film production for 
example. These techniques are proven to be remarkably cost-effective 
when deployed in mass quantities. Digital printing (such as inkjet) 
makes it even possible to produce custom-designed electronics 
on a massive scale. With the added value of being lightweight and 
flexible, a myriad of alternative design options enables the creation 
of new products.
	
In short, the combination of electronics and large-area 
production by printing is exciting and promising but also challenging 
scientifically, technologically, and economically, as innovation 
requires far more than science and technology to succeed. This book 
aims to introduce OPE, its fundamental aspects, and its applications.
1.2 Intended Audience for the Book
In the 1980s there were still a few scientific publications arguing 
whether organic molecules could exhibit semiconducting properties 

3
Contents and Book Overview
at all. Today these papers can be read on portable, tablet computers 
equipped with OLED displays, showing videos of the production 
processes and the facilities to manufacture them. One of the key 
questions today is rather how to effectively introduce the field of 
OPE to an increasing number of students, engineers, and enthusiasts.
	
There are many high-level monographs and specialized 
books covering several essential aspects ranging from organic 
semiconducting materials chemistry to advanced device processing 
and physics. However, these books are often very specific and 
are meant for advanced postgraduate students or experts in the 
field. This book is an attempt to introduce a vast and varied field 
of technology, science, and applications to students in their final 
undergraduate or beginning graduate studies, as well as engineers 
interested in approaching new fields.
	
The authors of the chapters are all experts in their fields, involved 
in OPE in their daily work. This book was written by practitioners 
of the science and technologies presented, many of whom are 
working in an industrial environment. On the other hand, we feel 
it is important to transmit working knowledge that is connected to 
practice.
	
The style of the book is meant to support self-learning and 
reflection, as well as to provide support to classroom teaching. 
Each chapter provides questions and simple exercises to check the 
understanding and apply the concepts presented in the material. 
The reader willing to deepen his or her knowledge is also provided 
with a list of Further Readings at the end of each chapter.
1.3 Contents and Book Overview
The chapter order is meant to introduce first the core concepts of 
organic semiconductors and printing technologies (Fig. 1.1). The 
next section introduces the reader to key device types and building 
blocks, namely transistors, light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and 
power storage. In the following chapter, sensors are presented as an 
example of more complex system-level integration. Encapsulation 
is a separate topic, given its importance in ensuring lifetime 
performance at the component and the system level. The integration 
of OPE into conventional electronics (hybrid systems) as well as the 

4
Organic and Printed Electronics: An Introduction
fast-developing topic of smart textiles complete this first part of the 
book. The final chapters are of a broader nature, presenting larger 
perspectives on the application fields, their evolution, the challenges 
related to innovation, and environmental impact. Finally, real-life 
practice is for many the best way to get involved. Therefore, the last 
chapter provides hands-on experiments. As teaching support, the 
chapters should cover material for a couple of semesters, depending 
on the class frequency and ambition.

Overall Content Description
	
The chapters are often self-contained and can be read or used 
as instruction material independently. For this reason, some 
redundancies in the exposition were necessary in several cases. 
Depending on the reader’s background, or the presentation needed 
for a given course, there are naturally diverse ways to use the text. The 
book can be, for example, approached from the transversal topics or 
even backward for readers already engaged in environmental studies 
or innovation management and interested to learn more about the 
modes of operations of specific devices and the fundamentals of 
organic semiconductors.
1.4 Overall Content Description
The content of the chapters is described briefly next, including some 
significant changes with respect to the first edition of the book.
Organic Semiconducting Materials
This chapter introduces the basic concepts from the ground up, 
starting from chemical bonds and showing the link to molecular 
orbitals (highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest occupied 
molecular orbital [HOMO-LUMO] levels). Charge injection (ohmic 
contact, injection barrier) and transport mechanisms (from 
Peierls instability to organic semiconductors’ mobility) in organic 
semiconductors are introduced, as well as the impact of the disorder 
on conductivity. Important links are made to optical properties for 
both radiative and nonradiative effects. It is recommended to be 
read prior to the chapters on organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs), 
light-emitting diodes, and solar cells.
Printing and Processing Techniques
There is a large step between a solid semiconducting material and 
a functional ink that can be reliably printed or coated on large 
areas. The chapter covers the basics of functional ink formulation, 
interactions between substrates and fluids (e.g., wetting behavior), 
and the complex fluid dynamical processes linking the printed fluid 
to the finally dried shape. This first section has partly been rewritten 
and complemented. The chapter thoroughly introduces the most 
used and relevant printing (from gravure to screen printing and 
inkjet printing), patterning (from lithography to hot embossing), 

6
Organic and Printed Electronics: An Introduction
and coating techniques (from spin coating to slit die coating). As 
new entries 3D printing and reverse offset printing complete the list 
of additive manufacturing techniques in this second edition.
Characterization Techniques for Printed Electronics
Traditional printing relies largely on optical inspection to 
evaluate the quality of the final product. As challenging as this is, 
printed electronics requires a qualitatively different approach for 
characterization. The chapter introduces the techniques required to 
characterize: the properties of inks prior to printing (e.g., viscosity), 
the structural properties of layers formed (e.g., thickness and 
roughness), and finally their optical or electronic properties. In this 
second edition, some sections have been expanded and restructured 
(e.g., viscosity, electrical properties, and the newly added longevity). 
Moreover, relevant standards are now referenced to complement the 
measurement techniques presented. Adhering to these can improve 
the comparability and thus the quality of measurements even if they 
have to be adopted from related fields.
Organic Thin-Film Transistors
This chapter introduces the main types of OTFTs, their structure, 
and their functioning principles; it provides practical knowledge 
about electrical measurement methods for them and shows 
how to gain insights into the performance and limitations of the 
devices being measured. Guidelines on how to correctly interpret 
the measurements and to provide feedback on the manufacturing 
process are given. Simple circuits such as logic gates and oscillators 
are presented, as well as examples of advanced research for devices 
in the biomedical area.
The Basics of Organic Light-Emitting Diodes (OLEDs)
The basic structure and working principle of simplified OLEDs 
are given. The chapter introduces the main materials and layers 
contributing to light emission efficiency (light-emitting, transport, 
and injection layers) as well as the theme of light extraction from 
the device. Lifetime aspects are presented in relation to materials, 
processing, chemical stability, and encapsulation. Production 
processes (vacuum and solution), applications, and perspectives, 
including flexible devices, are presented. This chapter has been 
reorganized and—in addition to several complements—now includes 
sections on the characterization of OLEDs, their manufacturing in a 

7
Overall Content Description
vacuum as well as from solution and an experimental view on the 
layer stack. To conclude, examples of commercial OLED applications 
are given.
Organic Solar Cells
The basic principles of organic solar cells are introduced, as well 
as core production technologies. Examples of the key materials 
of organic solar cells are given, including photoactive layers, and 
electrodes. The key parameters and procedures for the electrical 
characterization of solar cells and modules are given. The reader is 
also introduced to the lifetime aspects and degradation mechanisms 
of organic solar cells. This chapter was completely rewritten and 
includes a section on perovskite materials as well as an overview of 
current applications ranging from building integrated PV to power 
generation of internet-of-things applications.
Printable Power Storage
Many devices including printable electronics are meant to be portable 
or disconnected from a power grid. The ability to store electrical 
power is therefore critical. The chapter introduces printable storage 
cells, batteries, and supercapacitors. The chapter introduces the key 
performance parameters (from voltage to cycle life considerations), 
the principles of the devices, and their characterization. The reader 
is further introduced to the materials (electrodes, liquid/solid 
electrolytes, high-surface materials) and the different architectures 
for processing. A comparison of supercapacitors and batteries, as 
well as perspectives on the challenges of electrochemical systems, 
is given.
Printed Sensors
Sensors are key to enabling interactions between humans, machines, 
and their environment. This chapter introduces the fundamental 
aspects of sensors and the working principles of common sensors. 
Several types of printed sensors and organic sensors (including 
resistive, electrochemical, capacitive, optical, ionic, etc.) are 
presented. Sensors can comprise organic devices introduced in 
previous chapters (e.g., OTFTs). The chapter also gives examples 
of applications and integration of organic printed sensors in more 
complex systems and was updated from the first edition version to 
include more recent developments.

Organic and Printed Electronics: An Introduction
Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
Encapsulation layers and materials enable the appropriate lifetime 
of many (if not all) organic and printed electronic devices. The 
reader is introduced to the permeation phenomena in solids and 
thin films as well as to the principles of permeation measurements. 
The chapter presents key materials used as encapsulants, including 
glass, polymer films, sealants, thin-film coatings, and getter materials. 
Relevant and updated processing techniques to apply encapsulating 
materials to printed electronics devices are presented as well.
Hybrid Printed Electronics
On the one hand, fully printed, flexible organic electronic devices 
are an exciting perspective that remains on the horizon. On the 
other hand, it is already possible to combine existing electronics 
with printed and organic components to enable applications in a 
shorter time frame. The chapter introduces examples of (inorganic) 
printable inks, substrates, and processes for printing circuitry. The 
assembly of components in systems, including contacting, pick-and-
place, and foil-to-foil lamination, is presented. Finally, the reader is 
introduced to a concrete case study of a hybrid sensor system. While 
the chapter is essentially the same as in the first edition, some new 
elements of hybrid integration can be found in the smart textiles 
chapter.
Smart Textiles
This chapter was introduced in this second edition, given its key 
importance in the field. The applications of smart textiles range from 
automotive to e-health to sport garments applications. This chapter 
includes a thorough presentation of the materials and processes 
required to produce responsive and actuating fibers, as well as 
the specific processes, including weaving, for the fabrication of 
textiles that can both sense and respond to their environment. The 
content of this book section also complements the materials’ hybrid 
integration.
Circular Economy and Environmental Aspects of OPE
OPE presents an opportunity to produce electronics on a large scale 
with a reduced environmental footprint, and even further, to enable 
the implementation of circular economy solutions. This chapter 
provides a perspective on the OPE field from a sustainability point of 
view and introduces core methodologies such as life cycle analysis, 

9
environmental impact, and ecotoxicology through a case study on 
organic photovoltaic technologies.
Innovation Management
The chapter introduces the reader to core innovation management 
frameworks, terminology, and metrics (such as a TRL). The chapter 
also puts into perspective the field from a historical development 
point of view and some lessons learned, often the hard way, by the 
pioneers in the field. The reader is further introduced to aspects 
such as innovation ecosystems, as well as to practical aspects for 
commercialization, including business models and intellectual 
property considerations.
Roadmapping
This chapter provides insight into the current application 
perspectives of OPE, including OLED lighting, organic photovoltaics, 
flexible displays, printed electronic components, and integrated 
smart systems. Making statements about the future, planning, and 
designing roadmaps are at best difficult, especially in an emerging 
technology field, but as Dwight D. Eisenhower already said: “In 
preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but 
planning is indispensable.” With this in mind, the roadmapping 
process by itself provides valuable reflection and communication 
tools.
Hands-On Experiments
This chapter describes five practical experiments in the field of 
organic electronics and printed electronics. Two experiments can 
be performed in an applied science laboratory that is equipped for 
bachelor education. The other two require more specific equipment. 
The reader is shown how to make devices including organometallic 
light-emitting diodes, printed antennas for radio-frequency 
identification (RFID) tags, raspberry dye solar cells, flexible 
supercapacitors, and a simple piezoelectric inkjet printing head.
	
Finally, it was not possible to introduce all the topics we would 
have liked; it is a challenging balancing act to select the most 
important topics in such a multidisciplinary field.
	
OPE adoption in a wide range of industry sectors keeps 
increasing, opening even more bright perspectives for the future. We 
hope this book can help the readers as a first step in their impactful 
and fruitful journeys.
Overall Content Description


2.1 Introduction
The use of materials in order to enhance our quality of living has 
always been a key component of the human experience. Early on it 
consisted of using tools fashioned out of stone, wood, animal hides, 
and bones, but our choice of materials and the number of applications 
has grown dramatically over time. Improved materials and/or new 
materials have had such a dramatic impact on human life that we often 
describe and name periods of history by the predominant material 
used at the time, for example, the stone age, bronze age, iron age, etc. 
In the early times of ‘modern’ man, advances in materials and their 
applications were slow, and consequently, so was the development

of overall prosperity in society. The Renaissance with its focus on 
science and knowledge brought about an accelerated development 
of new materials and in the 1800s the industrial revolution was 
accelerated by improvements in steel. Finally, the groundbreaking 
work in quantum physics carried out in the early 1900s paved the 
way for the ‘silicon age,’ where a host of new materials, besides 
silicon, enabled technologies that have brought us a whole new 
way of life. One particular powerful recent trend is nanoelectronics, 
and nanotechnology in general, that depend upon the creation of 
functional materials, devices, and systems through control of matter 
on the nm length scale (1–100 nm), and the exploitation of novel 
phenomena and properties (physical, chemical, biological) at that 
length scale. Hence, the scientific and technological revolution that 
nanotechnology represents may very well demand new processing 
techniques and in fact whole new materials systems. In nature, 
nanotechnology already was realized millions of years ago and 
relies on the self-organization of organic (carbon-based) molecules. 
Evolution chose organic materials over inorganic materials, and 
nature has managed to create highly complex systems such as the 
human body that comes equipped with a wide variety of sensors, 
memory functions, and data and signal processing devices. So, why 
shouldn’t we mimic nature and try to make electronics out of organic 
materials, and nanoelectronics through self-organizing molecules? 
Indeed, the development of organic electronics is underway and 
perhaps the first major breakthrough, electrically conducting and 
semiconducting polymers (plastics), was awarded the Nobel Prize 
in Chemistry in the year 2000. Already today, electronic components 
such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), transistors, and solar cells 
can be made using semiconducting and conducting polymers and 
organic molecules. What do we then mean by the term ‘polymer’?
	
Popularly known as plastics, polymers are large molecules 
constructed from smaller structural units (monomers) covalently 
bonded together in any conceivable pattern, see Fig. 2.1. By 
modifying the monomer building blocks and the bonding scheme, 
the mechanical and thermal properties of the polymers can be 
controlled. Polymers can be made rubbery or brittle, soft or hard, 
soluble, or non-soluble, and in practically any color by blending with 
suitable chromophores. The special properties of polymers such

Introduction
as solubility allow for a variety of convenient processing methods, 
such as conventional printing and coating techniques (ink-jet, flexo, 
screen, etc.) as well as injection molding, spin coating, and spray 
painting. This is in striking contrast to the processing of metals and 
even more so, inorganic semiconductors like silicon, as mentioned 
earlier. Hence, polymers can be found in almost all products 
in society: clothes, furniture, home appliances, cars, airplanes, 
electronics, etc. There also are naturally occurring polymers like 
proteins and rubber, but most polymers in use today are synthesized, 
and hence are called synthetic polymers. Yet, despite the naturally 
occurring polymers, the concept of polymers did not achieve general 
acceptance until the early years of the 20th century.

Polymers are mainly used for their structural properties, be it the 
elasticity of plastic food wrap or the hard yet lightweight and easily 
moldable plastic parts in a car. The idea of utilizing the electrically 
conducting properties of polymers was proposed as early as in the 
1960s, and since then polymers have been used as active components 
in a variety of electronic applications. For instance, carbon- and 
metal-filled polymers are used as moldable semiconductors in the 
electronic industry, and polymers and organic molecules long have 
served as photoreceptors in electrophotographic copying machines. 

14
Organic Semiconducting Materials
In this chapter, however, we mainly will concentrate on a particular 
class of electronic polymers, the so-called p-conjugated polymers.
	
In 1977 it was discovered that an alternating-bond conjugated 
polymer, trans-polyacetylene, is a semiconductor that can be doped 
and thereby transformed into a good electrical conductor. This 
discovery led to the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2000, as mentioned 
earlier. Polyacetylene differs from normal household plastics, 
polyethylene (also known as ‘plastic wrap’), only in that it has one 
hydrogen atom per carbon atom, instead of two, as depicted in 
Fig. 2.2. Yet this small chemical change gives rise to striking 
differences in both electronic and physical properties. Indeed, 
by making subtle changes in the chemistry of a polymer, the 
organic material can change from insulating to semiconducting 
to conducting! This is one of the dramatic differences between 
organic electronics and traditional electronics. In building ‘normal’ 
electronic components, one chooses metals such as aluminum for 
the conducting parts, (doped) silicon for the semiconducting parts, 
and perhaps an oxide for the insulating parts of the component, that 
is, a combination of a wide variety of different elements that have 
highly dissimilar processing properties. In organic electronics, we 
can use basically one type of building block, carbon-based polymers, 
and molecules that have fairly similar processing properties, 
for both the conducting, semiconducting and insulating parts of 
the components. Of course, there are situations where adding 
inorganic materials and/or metals to the devices is desirable, but 
the ability to tailor the electronic and mechanical properties of the 
polymers through synthesis is very useful for both device design and 
fabrication purposes. (If mechanical properties are to be modified, 
the traditional materials differ from polymers in a similar way as 
above. For instance, in order to change the mechanical properties of 
iron, other elements such as manganese, copper, or carbon are added 
in a melt, creating an alloy. For a polymer, elasticity, shear resistance, 
etc. can be changed merely by changing the molecular weight (chain 
length) of the polymer, the alignments of the chains, and/or the 
amount of cross-linking, i.e., no alloying is necessary.) The electronic 
and optical properties of p-conjugated polymers and molecules used 
in organic electronics, and how chemical and morphological changes 
affect those properties, will be discussed in this chapter.

2.2 From Chemical Bonds to Bands
We will here describe how atoms can form bonds becoming 
molecules, how molecules can bond into polymers, and show how 
the electronic structure then evolves from discrete energy levels 
corresponding to atomic and molecular orbitals to energy bands in 
polymers. We will treat this on a purely conceptual level, so readers 
are referred to standard quantum mechanical textbooks for details.
	
We start by using hydrogen, the simplest atom available, to 
introduce one of the basic concepts needed: the atomic orbital. The 
time-dependent Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom, that is 
an electron e- and in the potential of a proton p+, can be written as:
	
iℏ ∂Y/∂t = HY	
(2.1)
where
	
H = –(ℏ2/2m)—2 + V(r)	
(2.2)
is the Hamiltonian, or the energy operator, and ℏ is Planck’s constant 
divided by 2p, m is the mass of the electron and V(r) is the potential 
energy of the electron in the attractive central electrostatic field of 
the nucleus (proton, in this case). The electronic wave function, Y, 
is related to the probability of finding the electron at a particular 
point in space around the nucleus at a particular point in time so 
that the electron density r is equal to Y∗Y. Y is then referred to as 
an atomic orbital since it describes the orbit of the electron around 
the nuclei. We hereafter will use electronic wave function and orbital 
interchangeably in the text. Many solutions to Eq. 2.1 exist with their 
unique set of integer quantum numbers (n, l, m) that determine the 
energy and shape of the orbit or “cloud.” The so-called principal 
quantum number n is related to the allowed energies of the electron, 
the quantum number l corresponds to the angular momentum of 

16
Organic Semiconducting Materials
the electron in its orbit around the nucleus, while m is called the 
magnetic quantum number but will not be discussed further here. 
As per the Pauli principle, each orbital can contain two electrons, 
one “spin up” and one “spin down.” There are 2l+1 possible solutions 
with the same energy for a given n, so the maximum number of 
electrons of this energy is then 2(2l+1). Based on the quantum 
numbers, the orbitals have names that come from the early days of 
optical spectroscopy. When l = 0, the orbital is called an “s (s stands 
for sharp) orbital.” For l = 1, the orbitals are called “p (principal) 
orbitals,” while for l = 2, they are called “d (diffuse) orbitals” and 
l = 3 is an “f (fundamental) orbital.” For the hydrogen ground state 
orbital (n = 1), then called 1s, the resulting “cloud” is spherical in 
shape and for excited states (n = 2, 3, 4, …), the shape of the orbitals 
becomes increasingly more complex, see Fig. 2.3. Note that all Y go 
toward zero as the distance to the nucleus approaches infinity and 
that a wave function has n–1 nodes as well. Solving the Schrödinger 
equation and determining the atomic orbitals for heavier atoms 
require some additional approximations due to many-body effects, 
but the general concept of atomic orbitals still holds. We can then 
also describe the electronic structure for heavier atoms such as 
carbon using this technique, that is, the total wave function of the 
electrons on an atom can be written as a linear combination of 
individual atomic orbitals.

quantum numbers. The 2s orbital has a spherical nodal plane (not shown).

Another important concept needed for understanding how 
carbon atoms bond to form molecules and polymers is the so-called 
hybrid atomic orbitals. The ground state of a carbon atom with 
its six electrons can be written 1s22s22p2, that is, two electrons 
in the 1s orbital, two electrons in the 2s orbital, and finally two 
electrons in the three 2p orbitals (remember, 2l+1 degeneracy), see 
Fig. 2.4. When interacting with nearby atoms, however, the electrons 
in the frontier occupied n = 2 orbitals can reorganize themselves 
to minimize the overall energy by promoting one of the two 2s 
electrons into a 2p orbital, thereby forming linear combinations of 
the original n = 2 orbitals. This can occur in three basic hybridization 
schemes: sp, sp2, and sp3. The sp hybridized orbital consists of a 
linear combination of equal weight between the 2s orbital and a 2p 
orbital, for example, 2py in Fig. 2.4. The other two 2p orbitals in this 
case, 2px and 2pz, retain their original shape. For sp2 hybridization, 
a linear combination between the 2s and the 2px and 2py orbitals 
occurs, with the 2pz orbital unchanged. Finally, for sp3 hybridization, 
all orbitals participate in the linear combination. When the atomic 
orbitals are added together in this fashion, the shape of the resulting 
orbit or electronic “cloud” obviously will change, see Fig. 2.4.
	
Now, recalling that the atomic orbitals were connected to the 
electron density around an atom, we can see that the electrons density 
is not evenly distributed around the carbon atom, but higher electron 
density will exist in certain areas depending on the hybridization 
(sp, sp2, or sp3). The location of the clouds of high electron density in 
the hybridized orbitals, often called lobes, determines the bonding 
structure of carbon. As the carbon nuclei carry a positive charge from 
the 6 protons, bringing two carbon atoms close to each other will be 
easier if the approach is along an axis where a lobe of each atom 
intersects, forming a sort of handshake. We can conceptually think 
of it in this way that the high electron density in the intersecting 
lobes will shield the positive charge on the nuclei, decreasing the 
Coulomb repulsion and allowing them to move closer to each other 
compared to a case where the approach is along an axis lacking lobes 
and hence has little contribution to the screening from the electrons 
in the n = 2 shell. The higher the resulting electron density of the 
intersecting lobes between the nuclei, the stronger the bond. From 
Fig. 2.4 it should then be apparent that sp3 hybridized carbon will

form chemical bonds with four neighboring atoms in a tetrahedral-
like structure, sp2 hybridized carbon will form chemical bonds with 
three neighbors in the plane at a 120° angle, and sp hybridized carbon 
will form chemical bonds with two neighbors in a linear fashion. 
This type of bond is called covalent, as the two atoms forming the 
bonds share (valence) electrons. In the discussion above, the bonds 
formed as a handshake between two lobes of neighboring atoms are 
called s bonds as they are circularly symmetrical in cross-section 
when viewed along the axis of the bond (lobe handshake). We have 
so far left out the 2p orbitals that didn’t participate in the sp and sp2 
hybridization, but these too can form bonds, albeit of a weaker kind, 
so-called p-bonds. Take for example the case of sp2 hybridization 
where the 2pz orbitals on each carbon atom extend perpendicular 
out of the plane defined by the s-bonding sp2 lobes, see Fig. 2.5.
π
σ
Figure 2.5 Sketch of pz–pz overlap forming a p-bond. The sp2 lobes forming the 
handshake s-bonds that define the molecular geometry are not shown.
	
The two weakly overlapping 2pz orbitals don’t contribute with 
electron density in the plane of the s-bonds and hence not in the 
direct line drawn along the bond of the two carbon atoms, but there 
is still some additional screening of the nuclei added to the s-bond 
contribution and hence a slightly shorter bond lengths as compared 
to the sp3 case. This is a so-called double bond (a s- and a p-bond 
working together). For sp hybridization, both the 2px and 2pz orbitals 
can form p-bonds, yielding an even shorter bond length, a so-called 
triple bond (an s- and two p-bonds working together).
	
If we continue with sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, it is easily 
realized that the 120° bond angle means one can construct a 
hexagon-shaped molecule by bonding six carbon atoms together in 
a plane. The overlapping sp2 lobes are supplemented by overlapping 
2pz orbitals orthogonal to the plane forming p-bonds. Each carbon 
atom in the hexagon has an unused sp2 lobe (valence electron) left,

which then can bond by overlapping with, for example, the 1s orbital 
of a hydrogen atom, see Fig 2.6. We have thus formed benzene, a 
p-conjugated molecule, the formal definition of which is a molecule 
that has a p orbital on an atom adjacent to a double bond. Hence, 
when we have an unbroken sequence of carbon atoms bonding in the 
sp2 hybridized scheme, we have p-conjugation which is in general a 
prerequisite for obtaining organic semiconducting materials, as the 
p-conjugation allows for delocalized p-bonds. Imagine further that 
instead of adding hydrogen atoms to the 1 and 4 positions of the 
benzene hexagonal ring, we let two other benzene rings missing 
hydrogen in the 1 and 4 positions attach themselves instead (see 
Fig. 2.6), continue the process ad infinitum, and wind up with an 
infinitely long chain of repeating benzene molecules: a polymer 
(poly – many and mer – parts, “many parts” in Latin). In practice, 
real polymers are not infinite but do contain a large number of 
repeating molecular units. If two or more different molecular units 
are repeated, we have a so-called co-polymer.

Returning now to the electronic structure, we have discussed 
how the energy and location in space of the electrons in an atom 

21
can be described by a linear combination of atomic orbitals. When 
s- and p-bonds are formed, they form by the overlap between 
(valence) orbitals on adjacent atoms. When these electron clouds 
coincide in space, it is reasonable to assume that both the energy 
and the shape of the interacting orbitals are affected, which indeed 
is the case. We begin by using the atomic orbitals of the hydrogen 
atom to construct an approximation to the molecular orbitals of the 
hydrogen molecule, H2. This derivation appears in many textbooks 
so we will not go deeply into the mathematics. The key concept is 
that the atomic orbitals of the hydrogen atoms are used as a basis 
for the molecular orbitals of the hydrogen molecule, that is, each 
molecular orbital of H2 can be derived from a linear combination of 
the atomic orbitals. We choose the 1s atomic orbitals of the electron 
on each of the two hydrogen atoms, located at a constant distance r12 
from each other. We then express the molecular orbital as a linear 
combination of the two atomic orbitals f (a 1s state, each centered 
on one of the two protons),
	
Y = a f1 + b f2,	
(2.3)
where f1 = f (r – r1) is the 1s orbital centered on proton 1 and f2 = 
f (r – r2) is the 1s orbital centered on proton 2. The coefficients a 
and b must satisfy the condition the a2 + b2 = 1, in order that the Y 
will be normalized to unity, ÚY∗Ydt = 1. Also, we take a and b to be 
real without loss of generality. Then solving the time-independent 
Schrödinger equation HY = EY where E is energy gives us two 
molecular orbitals:
	
Y+ = (2)-½ (1+S)-½ (f1 + f2),
and	
 Y− = (2)-½ (1 − S)-½ (f1 − f2)	
(2.4)
with the corresponding energies:
	
E+ = (a + b)/(1 + S), and E– = (a − b)/(1 − S)	
(2.5)
where a is the Coulomb integral Ú fi*H fi dt, b is the resonance 
integral Ú fi*H fj dt and S is the overlap integral Ú fi* fj dt. The two 
new molecular orbitals created from the interacting atomic orbitals 
of the respective hydrogen atom and their energy levels are plotted 
in Fig. 2.7.

Figure 2.7 Energy level diagram of two hydrogen atoms interacting to form an 
H2 molecule. The 1s orbital overlap cause two new molecular orbitals to form: 
one bonding (Y+) where the electrons from the respective 1s orbitals go and 
another anti-bonding (Y–) that becomes unoccupied. The energy gap between 
the two molecular orbitals is 2│β│. The simplified shape of the molecular 
orbitals also is shown.
	
The electrons from the two singly occupied 1s orbitals of the two 
hydrogen atoms will then move into the Y+ molecular orbital and the 
Y– molecular orbital becomes unoccupied in the H2 molecule ground 
state. The gap in energy separating the highest occupied molecular 
orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital 
(LUMO), Y+ and Y–, respectively for our H2 molecule, represent the 
minimum energy needed to create an excited state. The results can 
be generalized to the interaction between any two atoms where 
the resulting molecular orbitals can be constructed from linear 
combinations of the atomic orbitals of the atoms involved in the 
bond formation.
	
Building upon the concepts outlined above (and letting S  =  0 
for simplicity), we can consider what happens when we have more 
atoms in a row, forming a linear molecule and eventually a polymer. 
If we take the hypothetical case of N hydrogen atoms, each with 
one electron in one atomic orbital, there then will be N molecular 
orbitals generated in the linear hydrogen molecule, see Fig. 2.8. 
The molecular orbitals will be linear combinations of the hydrogen 
atomic orbitals such that a molecular orbital Yj = Σcji fi. Solving 
the time-independent Schrödinger equation using the so-called 
“particle in a box/infinite potential well” approximation gets us the 
corresponding energies of the molecular orbitals:

kj = jp/a(N + 1),  j = 1, 2, …, N	
(2.7)
where “a” is the distance between atoms. If we take Eq. 2.6 and 
let N become very large (i.e., >>1), such as in a very long polymer 
chain, we see that a band of energies will appear between E1 ≈ a + 
2b and EN ≈ a – 2b, with a negligible energy difference separating 
the molecular orbitals in sequence. The results can be generalized 
for any atom from which then follows that a band created from N 
interacting orbitals of an l quantum number can contain 2(2l + 1)N 
electrons as each orbital can contain 2(2l + 1) electrons due to the 
Pauli principle, see Fig. 2.9. The allowed electron energies are then 
defined by the bands separated by gaps, similar to the case of atomic 
and molecular orbitals.
	
Whether residing in energy bands or discrete molecular 
orbitals, the electrons are bound to the material. In order to escape 
the material (atom, molecule, or polymer), energy must be added 
(absorbed). The energy of the molecular orbitals or energy bands is 
typically referenced to the so-called vacuum level, see Fig. 2.9, which 
corresponds to an electron that has been emitted from the material 
but has zero kinetic energy, sort of equivalent to a launched rocket 
just barely escaping the gravitational pull of the earth.

Figure 2.9 Energy bands of a material containing N atoms and the number of 
electrons allowed in each band. The energy scale is referenced to the vacuum 
level which signifies an electron that is free but at rest (zero kinetic energy). 
Any electron with energy situated below the vacuum level (negative energy on 
this scale) is then considered bound. The Fermi energy, EF, defines the highest 
occupied electronic state at T = 0 K and is here positioned in the middle of the 
3s band, that is, Na metal.
	
So, to wrap up this section, each electron in a material occupies a 
state determined by its wave function. A material’s density of states 
(DOSs) enumerates the number of possible states as a function 
of energy. Quantum mechanics dictate that only certain energies 
are allowed, so the DOS can have a lot of features. Electrons are 
considered indistinguishable and obey the Pauli exclusion principle, 
so only two electrons can occupy the same state. Filling of the DOS 
starts at the lowest energy and builds upward. At 0 K, the electrons 
hence occupy the lowest possible energy states, and for a metal, the 
energy up to which all the levels are filled is called the Fermi level. 
(At temperatures above 0 K, thermal excitation occurs resulting 
in vacancies below, and occupation above, the Fermi level). The 
allowed energy levels are usually grouped in bands, which in turn 
are separated by energy regions without any allowed states at all. 
If the Fermi level is positioned in the middle of such a band, the 
material is a conductor; if the Fermi level is positioned between 
bands and the separation is large, the material is an insulator; and 

25
if the Fermi level is positioned between bands but the separation is 
small, the material is a semiconductor. The requirement for charge 
conduction is that there are partially filled bands with vacant states 
available. This is the default state of a conductor, but requires, for 
example, thermal excitation in a semiconductor and is difficult, but 
not impossible, to achieve in an insulator. Almost all interesting 
material properties are determined by the electronic structure 
around the Fermi level. The highest (at 0 K) fully occupied band is 
commonly referred to as the valence band; the lowest unoccupied 
band is referred to as the conduction band; and the separation 
between the valence band and the conduction band as the band gap. 
The valence band and conduction band edges thus correspond to 
HOMO and LUMO, respectively, in a molecule. Crystalline materials 
have very well-defined bands, and an unambiguous definition of 
ionization potential and electron affinity is possible; from the top 
of the valence band (HOMO), and the bottom of the conduction 
band (LUMO), respectively. Disordered materials lack well-defined 
band edges, and their positions are difficult to measure. HOMO and 
LUMO are therefore used rather arbitrarily to define energy levels 
reasonably close to the true values but where the DOS is significant. 
This, unfortunately, introduces a measurement aspect where 
experimentally determined values are somewhat dependent on how 
they were measured and evaluated as illustrated in Fig. 2.10.

2.3 Charge Injection and Transport
The primary function of an organic electronic device generally 
involves injection and transport of charge, two processes that we 
will discuss in this section. Often, hybrid devices are fabricated 
where metals or transparent conducting oxides are used as charge-
injecting electrodes for the organic semiconductor films, but organic 
conductors, typically doped conjugated polymers, are used as well.
	
Organic molecules are very soft compared to most inorganic 
materials. They also tend to have a more heterogeneous charge 
distribution. Even a conjugated polymer chain such as polyacetylene, 
which at first glance appears to be a one-dimensional crystal, has 
a non-constant charge distribution. Peierls showed that such a 
system needs to dimerize to become stable. This dimerization into 
alternating carbon single and double bonds, see Fig. 2.11, causes a 
positional and electronic perturbation along the chain. In general, 
adding charge (reducing) or subtracting charge (oxidizing) to or 
from p-conjugated materials causes both positional and electronic 
distortions as the molecule first reorganizes its electronic density in 
response to the charge whereupon the nuclei react to the new electron 
density (more electron density between the nuclei—shorter bonds, 
less electron density—longer bonds). Those distortions generate a 
potential well that, at the cost of some energy, can travel along with 
the charge. The combination of a charge with an accompanying 
potential well is a quasi-particle called a polaron, and they are then 
inherently localized in space, typically on a single molecule or part 
of a polymer chain. The name polaron comes from polar crystals, 
where the phenomenon was first encountered. Other similar quasi-
particles are possible at very high charge densities: electronic states 
occupied by two electrons (or holes), basically two polarons of equal 
charge interacting which then are called either bipolarons (spin 
= 0) or polaron pairs (spin = 1). The formation of polaron pairs is 
favored when the exchange energy gained due to increased total 
spin is larger than the electron pairing energy from the electrostatic 
repulsion. The cost in energy of removing an electron from the 
HOMO is called the ionization potential (IP) and the energy gained 
from adding an electron to the LUMO is called electron affinity (EA). 

27
The energy gained from the reorganization into polaronic species is 
called the relaxation energy l.

A further complication arises as we go from a single molecule 
or polymer chain in a vacuum to the solid films typically used 
in organic electronic devices. In this scenario, if we for example 
remove a charge from the HOMO of a molecule, not only does the 
molecules reorganize their electron density as described above, but 
the electron density on the nearby molecules in the film will also 
be slightly modified, screening the charge on the ionized molecule. 
This is called a polarization effect as the local medium is polarized in 
response to the charge on the molecule. Hence both the gas phase IP 
and EA will be modified so that:
	
IPs = IPg – P+ and EAs = EAg + P–	
(2.8)
where P+ and P– are the polarization energies in response to a 
positive and negative charge, respectively. For a film featuring 
disorder, the local environment of a molecule varies in the films and 
hence will also the P+ and P– contributions. This means that instead 
of the well-defined discrete energy levels of the molecular orbitals, 
we will have a distribution of ionization energies for each orbital, 
resulting then in a broader density of such states as compared to 
the gas phase, see Fig. 2.12. Finally, static screening of the induced 
charge by pre-existing electric fields from, for example, nearby ions 
or molecular quadrupole moments will further change the IP and 
EA upwards or downwards depending on the sign of the resulting 
electrostatic interaction.

The process of charge injection in a device, see Fig. 2.13, involves 
transferring electrons from the HOMO (valence band edge) of the 
organic semiconductor into the electrode Fermi level, that is, hole 
injection, or transferring electrons from the electrode Fermi level 
to the LUMO (conduction band edge), creating polaronic species 
in both cases. If the electrode Fermi level position with respect 
to the vacuum level, the so-called work function, is such that it is 
energetically favorable to transfer charges from the electrode to the 
semiconductor, that is, larger than the positive polaron or smaller 
than the negative polaron formation energy, no extra energy is 
needed to transfer a charge and spontaneous transfer will occur 
until the work function of the electrode and the Fermi level of the 
semiconductor are equilibrated. We then have a so-called ohmic 
contact. If, on the other hand, the work function of the electrode is 
such that no spontaneous charge transfer occurs, the contact will 
have a barrier for charge injection, and the contact is said to be 
blocking. A device with one ohmic contact of each kind, one for holes 
and one for electrons is a typical diode. Under forward bias, that is, 
when the current flow is such that both contacts inject the carrier 
type for which it is ohmic, the current increases exponentially with 
the applied voltage. Under reverse bias, where both electrodes 
present barriers, no (or, in practice, a very small) current flows 
through the device. If, however, only one of the electrodes is ohmic, 

29
current will still flow through the device but there will be a build-
up of space charge since only carriers of one polarity are injected 
into the semiconductor as opposed to the case where both holes 
and electrons are injected and charge neutrality is maintained. 
Space charge–limited currents (SCLC) in single carrier devices are 
quite useful; the total amount of charge that can be maintained in 
the semiconductor is determined by the geometric capacitance 
of the device and this information can be used experimentally to 
characterize the charge transport properties of the material. The 
current density J vs. voltage V dependence is described by Eq. 2.9,
	
J ~ emV2/L3	
(2.9)
where L is the film thickness, e is the dielectric constant, and m is the 
mobility (more on that later).

Even if a contact is not ohmic, it is still possible to inject carriers, 
but there is an additional cost in the energy involved due to the 
offset between the energy levels involved. The size of that offset, 
often called injection barrier fb, quickly becomes a limiting factor.

Vacuum level alignment (no charge transfer between the organic film and the 
metal); Vacuum level offset due to electron transfer from the low work function 
metal to the organic film (ii, left panel) and due to electron transfer from the 
organic film to the high work function metal (ii, right panel).
	
As we can see, the injection barrier, if any, at an electrode/
organic semiconductor interface is of great importance. Tuning 
the energy level alignment at such an interface is then critical for 
optimizing device performance, and a variety of ways to do just 
that will be discussed in later chapters in the book. Here we will 
merely describe what types of energy level alignment can occur and 
the basic concepts behind them. When an organic semiconductor 
material is brought into contact with a metallic surface, two basic 
regimes of energy level alignment will hold: (i) vacuum level 
alignment or (ii) vacuum level offset, see Fig. 2.14. For vacuum level 
alignment to occur there can be no potential step at the interface, 
meaning that no (significant) amount of charge is transferred across 
the interface upon contact (and that the organic semiconductor 
does not form a dipole layer by preferential ordering of individual 
molecular dipole moments). The consequence of this is that as soon 
as we have partial charge transfer through covalent bond formation 
at the interface (metal atoms reacting with the organic molecules), 
we will be in regime (ii). Even when the metal surface is rendered 
non-reactive by partial oxidation or adsorption of carbohydrogen 

31
“dirt” (which tends to happen with metals films prepared in a low 
vacuum and/or exposed to air) charge transfer and hence vacuum 
level offsets can still occur, if the work function of the metal surface 
is high enough to extract electrons from the HOMO or low enough to 
inject electrons into the LUMO of the molecules adjacent to the metal 
surface in absence of an external field, see Fig. 2.14. If an additional 
charge is transferred in the subsequent layers extending away from 
the interface, the resulting energy gradient is typically referred to as 
energy level bending or band bending.
	
Having injected charge into an organic semiconductor film, the 
purpose is then to transport it. We will now discuss the properties 
that affect charge transport and introduce the main concepts. 
The number of electrons in the conduction band and holes in the 
valence band together with their respective mobility determines the 
electronic conductivity s of a material (Eq. 2.10), with q being the 
elementary charge, μn, μp, and n, p, the mobility and concentration 
of electrons and holes respectively). Controlling the number of 
carriers is usually part of the device’s function so the important 
quantity to consider is mobility, which defines the velocity with 
which an electron (or hole) moves in response to an electric field. A 
high mobility allows, for example, transistors a higher modulation 
range and faster switching speeds. Organic materials generally have 
lower mobility than inorganic semiconductors.
	
s = q(nμn + pμp)	
(2.10)
	
The electronic conductivity of conjugated molecules is a 
cornerstone of organic electronics. It must be mentioned though 
that most organic materials have much higher ion conductivity than 
common inorganic semiconductor materials. This is due both to a 
considerably higher prevalence of ions and higher ion mobility. The 
former is largely due to synthesis and purification issues and the 
latter is largely to the soft and porous nature of organic materials. 
In some cases, the ions, or ion-dependent processes, are part of the 
intended function. Electrochemical transistors are one example, 
where the functionality comes from doping and dedoping of the 
channel. Another one is light-emitting electrochemical cells, where 
mobile ions enable current injection under operation. For more 
conventional devices such as field effect transistors and Schottky-
like diodes, the ion conductivity is instead contributing to a non-ideal 
Charge Injection and Transport

32

behavior. Purification of organic materials is difficult and can be a 
significant cost. From a commercial point of view, it might thus make 
sense to develop technology that is robust to such non-idealities 
rather than trying to remove them by extensive purification.
	
One very distinctive feature of charge transport in most organic 
semiconductors is that it is activated, that is, the charge carrier 
mobility increases with increasing temperature. This is at variance 
with most of the common inorganic semiconductors where the 
mobility instead decreases with increasing temperature and is due 
to charge carrier localization. There are fundamentally two factors 
that contribute to the localization, one is polaronic effects and is due 
to the very nature of the molecules, and the other is disorder and 
related to the interaction between molecules (and usually also the 
interaction between molecules and impurities).
	
Although many conjugated molecules and polymers can 
crystallize, they do not readily form large perfect crystals. Some 
materials are liquid crystalline, and others are completely 
amorphous. In all cases, the processing conditions are important 
for the result. A given material can, and usually does, therefore 
have a complex phase structure. The concomitant variations in the 
surroundings of a charge carrier make the system disordered. This 
disorder can be both positional, that is, when the distance between 
the areas contributing to the conduction or valence bands in the 
material is non-uniform, or energetic, for example, due to interactions 
with intrinsic dipoles or with (non-uniformly distributed) charged 
impurities. Both the distance and the energy difference between 
localized states influence the rate of charge transfer and can thus 
cause localization.
	
The positional disorder is relatively straightforward; the closer 
the sites, the stronger the electronic coupling gets. On the other 
hand, if the sites are separated far enough the charge will inevitably 
localize. Localization can occur even if the sites are very close to 
each other due to energetic disorder. The important parameter is 
the site density per unit of energy. When the site density per unit 
energy is high, such as in crystals, the localization radius of an 
electron or hole is large, and if sufficiently large, the charge is said 
to be delocalized and is no longer associated with a particular atom 
or molecule. Such a charge can easily move around, and the mobility 
is therefore high; the charge transport is said to be ballistic. When 

33
the site density decreases, then so does the localization radius. At 
some point, the localization radius becomes too small to encompass 
a continuous path of sites within a small enough energy interval to 
allow efficient charge transfer and the charges become localized. 
Since activation is necessary for localized charges to move, mobility 
is low. The transition from localized to delocalized states is labeled 
as the “mobility edge” and it marks the transition in charge transport 
mechanism from hopping between localized sites to ballistic 
transport of delocalized charges. Figure 2.15 shows the relationship 
between site density and localization. Very few p-conjugated organic 
materials are macroscopically dominated by ballistic transport at 
room temperature mainly due to local variations in intermolecular 
order, but that does not mean that it never occurs. The complex 
phase structure of many materials can certainly include very well-
ordered regions, but as long as there are disordered regions in the 
path that a charge carrier needs to traverse the overall behavior will 
be that of an activated process.

the state density and localization (all states to the left of the dashed line are

considerably higher when the state density is above the localization limit.
	
As mentioned, even for well-ordered molecular films, the 
polaronic effects will cause a self-localization of the charge species. 
Charge transfer of localized charges under the influence of polaronic 
effects is well described by the Marcus theory, which was originally 
Charge Injection and Transport

34
Organic Semiconducting Materials
developed for chemical electron transfer reactions between 
dissolved reactants. The movement of polarons is fundamentally 
very similar to such a reaction, but instead of solvent molecules, it 
is the molecules themselves (or impurities) whose polarization it is 
that need to be realigned. Mathematically, the initial and final state 
of the charge transfer can be approximated with parabolas whose 
vertices correspond to the respective reaction coordinate and energy 
of the relaxed polaron in its initial and final position. The additional 
vertical energy difference between the vertex of the initial state 
and the parabola of the final state is the reorganization energy, see 
Fig. 2.16. To move from one site to another, the charge must overcome 
an energy barrier Ea,M proportional to the energy difference ∆E 
between the site and the reorganization energy l, see Eq. 2.11.

If the reorganization energy is small and the average energy 
difference between neighboring sites is large, the latter will dominate 
the charge transfer. Such a situation may occur in molecular films 
featuring a significant variation in the intermolecular order. The 
average energy difference between sites should, based purely 
on statistical arguments, be proportional to the average energy 
difference between the occupied and unoccupied states. In 
the Gaussian disorder model (GDM), the DOS is approximated 
by a Gaussian function. Apart from empirical success, such an 
approximation can also be rationalized on, for example, the basis 
that the molecules in an amorphous molecular solid are randomly 
oriented with respect to each other. At its inception, the Gaussian 
shape was also motivated by, for example, the shape of the 
absorption spectrum of many disordered organic semiconductors, 
but such arguments can be misleading since different states are 
usually involved in the optical processes. Fermi-Dirac statistics can 
be used to calculate the occupancy probability, and thus the average 
energy difference between occupied and unoccupied states. The 
GDM activation energy is taken to be proportional to this difference. 
The important parameter in the GDM is the standard deviation of 
the Gaussian function, s, sometimes also for convenience expressed 
as sˆ = s/kBT instead.

35

transfer process, where d is the distance between the localized states 
involved, DE is the difference between the initial and final state energy, Ea,M, 
is the required activation energy according to the Marcus theory, and l is the 
reorganization energy.
	
The density of occupied states in a Gaussian DOSs is, at equilibrium 
and for a low enough occupation density, an identical Gaussian shift 
in energy by σ2/kBT (see Fig. 2.17). In order to move from one site to 
another, a charge must on average overcome this energy difference, 
and the energy predicted by the GDM, Ea,GDM, is thus proportional 
to this number. In practical applications, an empirically determined 
constant of 4/9 is usually included in the GDM activation energy 
(Eq. 2.12):

The slightly lower activation energy suggested by empirical data 
can easily be rationalized by the fact that it is not necessary for a 
carrier to, on average, jump to the exact center of the DOS but rather 
to a slightly lower energy where the state density is high enough 
for states to be readily available. Although less stringent than the 
Marcus theory, the GDM can offer a more direct and intuitive basis for 
understanding macroscopic charge carrier transport in disordered 
materials. Many arguments can be made that a single Gaussian is not 
a perfect representation of the DOS of these materials, but it is close 
Charge Injection and Transport

36

enough to allow for at least a very good qualitative representation of 
many properties.
Figure 2.17 Sketch of the occupied and unoccupied state densities at 
equilibrium for low carrier concentrations assuming a Gaussian DOSs. The 
separation between the peaks of the respective distributions is equal to 
s2/kbT, which is the physical motivation for the expression of activation energy 
used in the GDM.
	
When the carrier concentration increases above a certain level, 
the offset between the center of the DOS and the average carrier 
energy will start to decrease due to state-filling effects (c.f., a fully 
occupied band where the offset is zero). The concomitant decrease 
in the activation energy increases the charge carrier mobility. At 
very high carrier concentrations the number of available free sites 
to which a carrier can jump will decrease and, in turn, the mobility. 
Most organic systems have a relatively low site density per unit of 
energy, which means that such effects become relevant for many 
common applications. This carrier concentration dependence is 
strongly correlated with the amount of disorder in the system or, 
concomitantly, the width of the DOS. More disorder gives stronger 
concentration dependence. Field effect transistors are an example 
of where the charge carrier concentration-dependent mobility can 
be important due to the high carrier concentrations frequently 
encountered in such devices.
	
If carriers are randomly introduced into a system, these will 
initially not be at equilibrium. The offset between the center of 
the DOS and the average carrier energy, and thus mobility, then 

37
becomes a time-dependent property until equilibrium is reached. 
Equilibration can be slow, and the mobility immediately after carrier 
introduction can be orders of magnitude higher than at equilibrium. 
Since the active layers in many practical devices are very thin, this 
effect can be very important and have a large influence on the 
performance of the device.
	
Externally applied electric fields add a further positional 
dependence to the energy of a charge carrier. Sites in the appropriate 
direction (according to polarity) along the net electric field will have 
their relative site energies reduced. Since the activation energy is 
proportional to the initial and final site energies of a carrier jump 
this means that the mobility will increase with increasing electric 
field. Experimentally, the mobility has frequently been shown to be 
proportional to the square root of the electric field and it is therefore 
usually referred to as the Poole-Frenkel effect after the theory for 
electric field-assisted electronic conduction in insulators.
	
It should now be clear that the degree or intermolecular order 
plays a huge role in determining charge transport properties in an 
organic semiconductor film. There is an additional very important 
aspect to this, mainly that impurities incorporated into the films can 
further introduce both positional and energetic disorders. Indeed, 
many organic materials are difficult to purify (a 99% purity is usually 
considered very good). Impurities can act as dopants, influence the 
DOS, and/or act as traps for charge carriers. Many (disordered) 
organic materials are also highly permeable to impurities (e.g., 
water) so the impurity levels depend on the environment of the 
device. Contrary to most inorganic semiconductors where the 
impurities are deliberately introduced to tune functionality, most 
impurities in organic materials are involuntary. Appropriate 
treatment of impurities and their effects is thus very important. Few 
concepts are so freely used and with as many meanings as traps 
within the field of organic electronics. When transport is ballistic 
the concept is simple; a trapped carrier is just that. It is trapped 
and does not, at that particular moment, move. All the carriers in a 
system with localized states are in essence trapped for the majority 
of the time. While there may certainly be trapping by impurities, it is 
not necessarily possible to distinguish those from carriers trapped 
in low energy states of the main DOS. In many cases the impurities 
simply influence the shape of the main DOS slightly by, for example, 
Charge Injection and Transport

38
Organic Semiconducting Materials
broadening it. If there is an increased site density at some narrow 
energy interval that is possible to link to a specific impurity, and that 
has a significant impact on the transport properties, it can be useful 
to talk about traps in the traditional sense. Indeed, the presence 
of water molecules in nanovoids of molecular films and chemical 
degradation induced by photo-radicalized molecular oxygen can 
yield trap state densities sufficiently far into the gap for many organic 
semiconductors to affect both transport (and optical properties). 
However, if there is no obvious and clearly defined trap level density, 
which has been proposed to be the case for organic semiconductors 
with IP < 6 eV and EA > 3.6 eV, it is from an engineering perspective 
best to consider the impurity-based effects as simply a part of the 
DOS. What is important to know is that the same organic materials 
can behave differently based on their environment and history.
2.4 Optical Properties
Optical absorption occurs through interactions between an 
electromagnetic wave (light) and an absorbing matter. Organic 
molecules are frequently asymmetric and have many different 
internal dipoles. Ultimately, this leads to many different interaction 
possibilities, which can give rise to anisotropy and several distinct 
absorption bands. Additionally, for example, the positional disorder 
tends to cause local variations that smear out the macroscopically 
observable absorption. Amorphous organic materials thus frequently 
have one or more smooth, Gaussian-like, absorption peaks. Highly 
ordered samples have much sharper features and frequently display 
vibronic structure, see Fig. 2.18.
	
Just as for charge carriers (polarons), the softness and 
polarizability of organic materials provide additional stabilization of 
excited electron-hole pairs, and such electrostatically bound quasi-
particles are called excitons. Excitons are sometimes classified 
according to their spatial extent and binding energy, with small, 
tightly bound excitons being referred to as Frenkel excitons, while 
those that are large and loosely bound are referred to as Wannier–
Mott excitons. Excitons can move, through either dipole-dipole 
interactions (Förster resonance energy transfer), or wave function 
overlap (Dexter energy transfer); recombine radiatively (emitting 
a photon) or non-radiatively; or separate into free carriers. Almost 

39
all organic materials have relatively high (higher than the thermal 
energy) exciton binding energies, and this is of fundamental 
importance, for example, in photovoltaic applications where optical 
excitations need to be separated into free carriers.

(top) a disordered organic semiconductor film and (bottom) a well-ordered film 
of the same semiconducting molecule showing distinct vibronic features.
	
Atomic movement influences the relative positions of the atoms 
in a molecule, and this also influences the electronic states that 
absorb and emit light. In disordered materials, there are usually too 
many small variations to be detectable, but in ordered systems, there 
are certain vibrational modes that can even dominate the optical 
properties. Since both absorption and emission preferentially occur 
from the vibronic state with the lowest energy, the absorption 
and photoluminescence spectra are, in the ideal case, mirrored 
(Fig. 2.19). In reality, there are usually a lot of defects in the solid 
state, and some of the vibronic transitions might be forbidden for, 
for example, symmetry reasons so that the absorption and emission 
spectra become rather dissimilar. Exciton migration (toward 
lower energy) also means that ordered domains will have a bigger 
influence on emission than absorption. Absorption and emission 
from the lowest vibronic level usually does not occur at the same 
energy despite the same states being involved. The reason for this 
is the reorganization energy. Both the energy of the excited electron 
and that of the resulting hole are shifted into the energy gap by one 
reorganization energy, see Fig. 2.19.

(S0) to a vibronically split excited state (arrows pointing up) and relaxation

split ground state (arrows pointing down). Right panel: energy parabolas of 
the ground state and the excited state involved where l is the reorganization 
energy. The total shift in energy between absorption and emission is 2l.
	
In total, this means that the emission is shifted by two 
reorganization energies compared to the absorption. Disorder 
and the fact that many different electronic states can absorb light 
in a solid, usually make it difficult or impossible to distinguish the 
appropriate transitions, and thus the reorganization energy, at room 
temperature. The qualitative correlation remains, however, and 
materials with a large so-called Stokes-shift (i.e., a large red-shift of 
the emission spectrum compared to the absorption spectrum) tend 
to have large reorganization energies.
	
As mentioned, excitons can recombine radiatively or non-
radiatively. For example, exciton interaction with trap states can 
lead to non-radiative recombination that significantly can reduce 
solar cell performance even at comparatively low trap densities. The 
rate of exciton recombination depends, among other things, on the 
spatial overlap of the electronic wavefunctions of the constituent 
hole and electron. Differences in electronegativity due to molecular 
asymmetry can cause displacements in the electron and hole charge 

41
densities and thus increase the exciton lifetime. Excitons are not only 
important for photoexcitations; they can also be an intermediate in 
recombination processes. Electrons are spin-1/2 particles, that is, 
fermions, and the total spin of the exciton can therefore be either 1 
or 0. No two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Excitons 
with a total spin of 0 are called singlet excitons and excitons with 
a total spin of 1 are triplet excitons. Photoexitations typically yield 
singlets, which can recombine quickly and radiatively (fluorescence). 
In a random population, such as in an electroluminescent device, 
however, there will also be triplets. Mathematically, the ratio 
between singlets and triplets is 1:3. Triplets are more long-lived and 
do not recombine radiatively in organic semiconductors, without 
intersystem crossing. So, for example, electroluminescent devices 
are thus limited to a quantum efficiency of at most 25%. Hence, 
metal-organic molecules capable of emitting light from triplet decay 
(phosphorescence) are typically used together with fluorescent 
organic semiconductors in organic LEDs.

Optical Properties

42
Organic Semiconducting Materials
	
Since the exciton binding energy typically exceeds the thermal 
energy in organic semiconductors, the separation of optical 
excitations into free charges is relatively inefficient. The charge 
separation probability is well described by the Onsager–Braun 
model, in which it is predicted to be proportional to the relative 
recombination and dissociation rates. Both of these rates are 
strongly dependent on the nature of the material and are not easily 
calculated. Qualitatively though, it has merits, and the model can be 
used to predict how various physical properties will influence charge 
dissociation. Applying an external electric field, for instance, aids 
the charge dissociation, and the Onsager–Braun model uses a Bessel 
function of order one to describe this dependency, see Fig. 2.20. Just 
as the excitons can dissociate into free carriers, free carriers can be 
reformed into excitons. This is also included in the model and the rate 
with which free carriers recombine is usually taken to be given by 
the Langevin factor in low mobility–low dielectric constant materials 
such as those discussed here. The Langevin factor is proportional to 
the sum of the electron and hole charge carrier mobilities and the 
permittivity of the material.
	
Although relatively slow, the recombination rate is still typically 
much faster than the dissociation rate at reasonable electric fields. 
To remedy this, it is possible to use two-phase systems, where there 
is an (appropriate) energetic offset between the respective frontier 
orbitals of the two materials, see Fig. 2.21. When one of the materials 
is excited, either the hole or electron will transfer to the other 
phase while still being electrostatically tightly bound. Such a state 
is called a charge transfer state, and the corresponding exciton is a 
charge transfer exciton. The electron and hole of a charge transfer 
exciton becomes (even more) spatially separated and the wave 
function overlap is reduced, which results in an increased lifetime 
that is proportional to the frontier orbital offset. Many material 
combinations can reach close to 100% charge separation efficiency 
in this way. Recent results on so-called non-fullerene acceptors 
show that near 100% efficient charge separation efficiency also can 
be reached for donor and acceptor systems that feature negligible 
energetic orbital offsets based on their neat film IPs and EAs, 
suggesting that an energetic offset is created when the donor-
acceptor interface is formed.

2.5 Short Summary
It should now hopefully be clear to the reader that organic 
semiconductors offer a nearly limitless opportunity to tune optical 
and electronic properties through synthesis: both by the design 
of the molecules and by combining one or more molecules into a 
polymer.
	
For example, in Fig. 2.22 are depicted a few polymers used in 
organic photovoltaics, also illustrating the use of mixed monomers 
(co-polymers) to tailor desired properties. The freedom available 
through synthesis also presents a challenge. We have learned that the 
electronic and optical properties are affected by film order, and film 
order will to a large extent be controlled by the chemical structure 
of the molecule or polymer as well as the film-forming process 
conditions. A minute change in the design of a molecule that doesn’t 
change the optical or electronic properties in the gas phase then can 
still dramatically change the electro-optic functionality of the film if 
the film-forming properties are affected. Likewise, changing solvent

or coating techniques can also radically change the performance of 
a particular material. It thus is hard to predict the functionality of a 
molecule or polymer in a device based solely on the properties of the 
isolated system, which makes the design and screening of materials 
for a chosen application a very complex task. The “perfect” material 
for a given application is thus out there ready to be synthesized, 
but until computer simulations have progressed to the point where 
film morphology accurately can be predicted, finding it will require 
significant trial-and-error work.
Questions and Answers
	Q: 1.	 Will the bandwidths resulting from the inter-monomer 
molecular orbital interactions in a linear polymer chain 
increase or decrease with the number N of monomers in the 
chain?
	
	 A: Significantly increase for small N, but leveling off for large 
N, see Eq. 2.6.
	Q: 2.	 What is the requirement for an ohmic contact to be formed 
between a conductor and an organic material?
	
	 A: That the work function of the conductor is such that the 
majority of carriers can be spontaneously transferred to the 
appropriate polaronic level in the semiconductor.
	Q: 3.	 If you want to decrease the work function of a metal electrode, 
should you adsorb a monolayer of a donor molecule that 
donates charge to the metal or an acceptor molecule that 
withdraws charge from the metal?
	
	 A: A donor molecule that donates charge causing a potential 
step to form at the interface that down-shifts the work 
function.
	Q: 4.	 Charge carrier mobilities in organic semiconductors are 
usually low, why?
	
	 A: Because localization occurs, and activation is required for 
the carriers to be able to move.
	Q: 5.	 Will increased film order increase or decrease charge 
mobility?
Questions and Answers

Organic Semiconducting Materials
	
	 A: Increase, increased film order decreases the degree of 
localization of charges.
	Q: 6.	 What is the fundamental relationship between optical 
absorption and photoluminescence in organic material, and 
why is it so?
	
	 A: They are the mirror image of each other. There can be 
several vibronic levels at higher energies compared to the 
basic transition associated with each optical transition. Since 
both absorption and emission occur from the state with the 
lowest energy and to the vibronic levels the absorption energy 
is increased and emission energy decreased for a specific 
vibronic level compared to the fundamental transition.

associated with high speed, precision, and cost efficiency, attributes 
that this technology has earned in the century-long tradition of 
the graphical industry. In spite of this long tradition, it is not easy 
to establish printing as a production technique for electronics: the 
requirements for printing quality are much higher for electronic 
devices than for graphical applications, while the materials are much 
more difficult to handle. Therefore, printing cannot be seen as a 
black box for deposition anymore. Since it has entered the electronic 
industry, research focuses more and more on understanding the 
physics behind this technique. Our concept is to subdivide printing 
into a sequence of processes and to explain each of them on the 
grounds of physical, thermodynamic, or hydrodynamic models.
	
We want to convince the reader of the necessity of systematic 
access to printing-related challenges that he or she may already have 
encountered in the lab: Why are some materials harder to process 
than others? Which technique is optimal for my material? How can I 
check whether my printed samples are OK or what has gone wrong?
	
In this chapter, we explain the printing process by following the 
whole process chain. We start with an introduction to functional 
fluids. After a listing of requirements and fluid parameters, we 
introduce the substeps of printing. In the following section, we 
describe the most common printing techniques by showing their 
working principle, applying the previously defined substeps to the 
specific system, and sharing practical experiences with the reader.
3.2 Fluid Formulation: Making Functional 
Materials Printable
Nowadays printing can be defined as the reproduction of patterns by 
transfer of matter to a surface by mechanical force or hydrodynamic 
stress. For this, functional materials need to be transformed into a 
physical condition in which they can be mechanically transported, 
subdivided, deformed, and deposited: the liquid state. This liquid 
state needs to fulfill specific requirements of the respective printing 
technique like inkjet, gravure, flexographic, or screen printing. 
Depending on the physical nature of these materials, there are 
different methods that can be used: dissolving the material in a 
more or less volatile solvent or creating nano- or microparticulate

dispersions. The formulation of these fluids has a vital impact on the 
printing or coating process, as well as on the drying process.
	
This section concentrates on the description of the printing fluid 
during the printing process.
3.2.1 Creating Printing Fluids
In functional printing, ready-to-print fluids are rarely offered by 
material manufacturers. Even if they are, quality fluctuations are 
often an issue the end user has to deal with. Usually, solid materials 
that still need to be brought into the liquid state are provided. 
Especially in research applications, adjustments of the printing 
fluids are a daily business. Therefore, important aspects of the fluid 
formulation are explained in this section.
	
The transfer of printing fluids to a substrate is essentially 
affected by the two fluid parameters viscosity and surface tension. 
Both depend on the composition of the fluid, i.e., on the solvent, on 
the solute as well as on the concentration of the latter. The fluid’s 
viscosity determines its ability to transfer hydrodynamical stress and 
pressure to the substrate at a given printing velocity. The resulting 
pressure is needed to supplant the air from the substrate surface and 
to enforce steady wetting of the substrate against capillary forces. 
These capillary forces occur at the fluid–substrate and fluid–air 
interface, and depend on the surface tension of the fluid. The surface 
tension tends to contract the liquid surface. After the printing form 
has been lifted, the freshly generated liquid film, therefore, shows the 
tendency to retract from the substrate in order to form energetically 
more favorable droplets. However, surface tension is also beneficial 
for capillary leveling and for the formation of uniform printed layers.
	
In the present section, we explain the relevance of viscosity 
and surface tension for printing, with specific regard to common 
functional materials.
3.2.1.1 Viscosity of printing fluids
The viscosity of a printing ink characterizes its mechanical properties 
as a liquid medium, i.e., whether the ink is “thin” or “thick”. Viscosity 
is the ratio between the shear stress exerted on a certain volume of 
ink by, for example, the printing plate or cylinder, and the shear rate 
of the flow which distributes the ink on the substrate.

50
Printing and Processing Techniques
	
The ink’s viscosity must be adequately chosen for each printing 
technology and can differ by many orders of magnitude. As an 
example, the viscosity of water and some common organic solvents 
(toluene, ethanol) is 10–3 Pa·s (pascal seconds), whereas lithography 
printing inks for newspaper printing range at several thousand Pa·s.
3.2.1.1.1 Shear rate and shear stress
Imagine an infinitesimal cube of liquid situated in a reservoir of an 
isotropic liquid, such as water, oil, or any organic solvent. The six 
faces of the cube have a given size DAi, where the index i = x, y, z 
denotes the direction of the normal vector on this face with respect 
to a Cartesian coordinate system. If a tangential force DFj is imposed 
between two of the opposing faces of the cube, a shear stress affects 
the liquid. This induces a continuous dissipative shear flow inside 
the cube. This shear flow is the tensor of gradients of the flow 
velocity vk, that is, the shear rate

3.2.1.1.2 Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids
For Newtonian fluids, such as water, the dynamic viscosity h is 
constant at a given temperature. In contrast, many printing fluids 
are non-Newtonian; their viscosity depends on the shear rate. One 
distinguishes essentially two classes of non-Newtonian behavior, 
shear thinning and shear thickening. For shear-thinning liquids, 
the viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate. This means that 
the shear rate increases over-proportionally to the applied shear 
stress. Common examples are polymer solutions, or slurries and 
suspensions of solid particles in a carrier liquid. Analogously, the 
viscosity of shear-thickening liquids increases with increasing shear 
rates.
	
In many cases, one can describe non-Newtonian behavior by a 
power-law term:

where href  is the nominal viscosity measured at a defined reference 
shear rate g ref. For Newtonian liquids, the exponent a equals 0, 
whereas a > 0 indicates shear-thickening and –1 < a < 0 a shear-
thinning behavior of the liquid.
3.2.1.1.3 Complex fluids
There is a wide range of fluid types that are used in printed 
electronics, such as solutions of linear polymers with a stiff molecular 
backbone or dispersions of nonspherical particles where the viscous 
properties cannot be fully characterized by scalar viscosity.
	
These are referred to as anisotropic, complex, or mesogenic 
liquids. Viscosity does not only depend on the shear rate g  but is 
also a tensorial quantity with different independent components.
3.2.1.1.4 Stokes and Navier–Stokes equations
The equations of liquid motion can be derived from the laws of 
momentum conservation and are functions of the local flow velocity 
and the pressure in the ink. The acting forces result from mass 
inertia, viscous friction, as well as hydrostatic and capillary pressure. 
This yields the famous Navier–Stokes equation (NSE)

Liquid flows in printed layers are usually slow and dominated by

For many aspects of printing the Stokes equation proves to 
be sufficient, and cases where the nonlinear terms of the NSE are 
substantial are usually restricted to specific conditions.
3.2.1.2 Surface tension
The surface tension—or surface energy—describes the property that 
any liquid interface exerts mechanical stress on the environment, or 
on a different phase or material, in order to minimize the size of the 
interface. This refers to liquid–gas, liquid–liquid, and liquid–solid 
interfaces.
	
On a curved interface, the surface tension s may create a force 
per surface area that is normal to the surface. This force is directed 
toward the liquid volume if its curvature is convex and directed into 
the surrounding gas phase if it is concave.

53
Fluid Formulation: Making Functional Materials Printable
	
For this reason, the surface of a liquid drop tends to attain a 
spherical shape, minimizing its surface at a given drop volume. 
Inside a drop of radius R, a nonzero capillary or Laplace pressure
	
p

is effective and equilibrates the surface or capillary forces created 
by surface tension. More generally, the capillary pressure below an 
arbitrarily shaped liquid interface is proportional to its Gaussian 
curvature, the sum of the reciprocal principal curvature radii R1 and 
R2 at the considered point:

(3.11)
	
The principal radii R1 and R2 are defined to be positive if 
the corresponding tangent parabola is convex and negative if it 
is concave. Under the surface of a liquid volume that is at rest 
and in thermal equilibrium, and if gravity can be neglected, the 
hydrodynamic pressure p of the liquid is constant everywhere. As 
a consequence, the Gaussian curvature of the liquid surface must 
be constant throughout the interface as well. Spatial differences in 
capillary forces will cause liquid flows below differently curved parts 
of the surface, equilibrating the surface toward a more constant 
curvature.
3.2.1.3 Fluid parameters and printing techniques
For each printing technique—gravure, flexo, inkjet, screen, offset—
the preferred range of fluid parameters (viscosity and surface 
tension) of the printing fluids can be roughly estimated. This is 
shown in Fig. 3.1.
	
We emphasize that even printing fluids that are not in the range 
indicated for a specific printing technique may be, and in fact have 
been successfully processed. In this case, however, the machine and 
process parameters, such as transfer ratio or printing resolution, 
may drastically differ from what is typical for a graphical printing 
process.

printing techniques. Inkjet, gravure, and flexography all cover a range of viscosity 
that starts at about 1 mPa·s.
3.2.2 Choosing a Solvent
As mentioned above, the choice of solvent plays an important role 
in succeeding in printing. Therefore, the following aspects should be 
considered for the solvent:
 – The solubility of the material in it
 – Its viscosity and the effect of adding solutes
 – Surface tension and wetting capabilities on the substrate
 – Evaporation from the printed liquid film: boiling point and 
vapor pressure at the drying temperature used
	
In practice, further technical aspects have to be considered, which 
will only be mentioned but not discussed further in this chapter: the 
chemical resistivity of the printing machine’s components against 
the solvent; the disposal of its vapor in the drying process, toxicity, 
flammability, and flash point; and aspects of the subsequent cleaning 
of parts contaminated with the printing fluid.

55
3.2.2.1 Polymer materials
Polymers play a dominant role in printable electronics: They are the 
base for many organic semiconductors, dielectrics, and protective 
coatings. Compared to common polymer materials, which are mostly 
branched, functional polymers typically have a linear structure. 
They can therefore be characterized by the chain length (the number 
of monomer molecules) forming the chain. Concentration and chain 
length have a strong impact on the properties of polymer solutions, 
mainly on their viscosity. One distinguishes different types of 
polymer solutions:
 
∑ Diluted solutions: The concentration of the polymer in the 
solution is low in the sense that the individual polymer 
chains are independently distributed in the solvent. Driven by 
Brownian motion, each chain tends to form a sphere or blob. 
The viscosity of the solution is essentially that of the solvent.
 
∑ Semidiluted solutions: With increasing polymer concentration, 
the interaction between the blobs becomes significant. The 
fluid’s viscosity is more or less determined by their mutual 
contact or by microscopic viscous friction between them. 
If the solution is sheared, the blobs are deformed by shear 
forces such as to attenuate mutual friction. This is known as 
shear thinning: The viscosity of a semidilute polymer solution 
decreases with an increase in the shear rate, and the fluid 
clearly exhibits a non-Newtonian behavior.
 
∑ Concentrated solutions: At high concentrations, the polymers 
cease to form individual blobs. The fluid properties are 
dominated by the interactions between the polymer chains, 
leading to a linear dependency between chain length and 
viscosity. With increasing concentration, the solution finally 
attains a rubber-like, viscoelastic behavior under shear stress.
	
Prominent printable examples of semiconducting polymers 
are poly-(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT) and SuperYellow. P3HT is a 
p-type semiconductor that is used for thin-film transistors (OTFT) 
and organic solar cells (OPV). Typically, molecules with a molecular 
weight of 50,000 to 76,000 Da are chosen for the formulation of 
printing fluids. Its solubility in toluene is approximately 1.5 wt.-% 
at room temperature. SuperYellow is a yellow-emitting polymer used 
Fluid Formulation: Making Functional Materials Printable

56
Printing and Processing Techniques
for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Its solubility in toluene is 
up to 10 wt.-%, depending on the chain length. Another frequently 
printed polymer is polystyrene (PS). It is very easy to print and since 
it shows good insulating properties, it is used as a dielectric layer. 
It is soluble in toluene at any concentration. The viscosity of these 
solutions continuously increases with increasing concentration of 
polystyrene, finally forming a viscoelastic gel that is indistinguishable 
from the pure solid polymer.
	
Polymer solutions and dispersions gel at some point when the 
solvent is removed, for example, by evaporation. Their viscosity 
increases continuously due to the progressing percolation of the 
polymer chains. Finally, the polymer interconnects to an elastic 
network, and the printed layer solidifies. Gelation is reversible, i.e., 
the polymer film can be redissolved by adding solvent. This can be 
an issue when a subsequent layer is deposited on the gelled polymer 
film.
	
Moreover, polymer solutions are thixotropic, that is, their 
viscosity is dependent on the preceding shear history. Solidification 
of polymer solutions by percolation is a second-order phase 
transition, and it takes an increasingly long time to relax to thermal 
equilibrium. This is also true for the dissolution of polymers and is 
caused by the profound changes in chain conformation.
	
Freshly deposited polymer layers are usually amorphous—with 
a random molecular arrangement—and still contain substantial 
quantities of solvent. For this reason, the thermal treatment of 
printed polymer layers should be considered. By this annealing step 
solvent residuals are removed from the layer, and the polymer has 
an opportunity to become partially crystalline. There are, however, 
specific exceptions to this rule: P3HT is known to have a so-called 
steric transition, even in the solute state. Depending on concentration 
and temperature, the molecular blobs reversibly transform into a 
particulate dispersion of ordered molecular clusters. The degree 
of structural order in these clusters is a further important feature: 
it has a considerable impact on the charge carrier mobility of the 
resulting P3HT layer.
	
Surface tensions of polymer solutions can be roughly estimated 
as those of the solvent and the solid polymer being weighted with 
their volume fractions. This is not more than a first qualitative 

57
estimate—for example, for PS or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) 
in toluene, the solution’s surface tension is between that of the pure 
materials but does not linearly depend on their volume fractions. 
This is due to the limited chemical affinity between polymer and 
solvent and to the diffusion of the polymer at the fluid interfaces. 
This may cause additional effects such as skin formation, impeding 
the flow, and drying of the liquid layer.
	
It is therefore obvious that a deliberate choice of solvent with 
respect to solubility, viscous behavior, and layer deposition is of 
utmost importance for designing a successful printing and drying 
process for polymer materials.
3.2.2.2 Small molecules
Small-molecule semiconductors play an increasing role in printed 
electronics. Initially designed for vacuum deposition, they can be 
sublimated and evaporated at elevated temperatures, without being 
disintegrated. Most of them are also soluble in specific solvents. 
Small-molecule materials have molecular weights between 300 
and 2000 g/Mol and a strong tendency to condense as crystals or 
crystalline layers. Finally, this is the key feature of the outstanding 
performance of small-molecule semiconductors.
	
The effect of small-molecule semiconductors on the viscosity 
of liquid solutions is quite distinct from polymers. As for inorganic 
salts, the increase of viscosity caused by the semiconductor is small 
and is usually negligible even in saturated solutions.
	
Layer deposition from solution is a first-order phase transition 
from saturated or even supersaturated solutions, and there is 
a considerable enthalpy of crystallization associated with this 
transition. This is critical for the printing process. Once the solution 
becomes supersaturated within the printing or drying step, the 
deposition of the solid phase can be initiated by nucleation at any 
time. Driven by internal crystallization enthalpy, the deposition is 
not controllable anymore and may result in the formation of isolated 
crystal grains or even in dendritic pattern formation rather than in 
a smooth and homogeneous layer. In any case, the printer may have 
to find a possibly difficult compromise toward electronic material 
performance, and additional measures such as tempering of the 
semiconductor layers subsequent to the drying process may become 
necessary.

Printing and Processing Techniques
	
With respect to surface tension, the same applies to polymers: 
Mixing rules approximately apply to some degree, but additional 
phenomena affecting surface tension, such as solute diffusion at the 
liquid interfaces, may have a crucial impact.
3.2.2.3 Colloidal dispersions
Metals and metal oxides form an important class of materials that 
constitute the backbone of any electronics manufacturing process. 
Commonly, there are two options to stabilize metals in a printable 
liquid state: colloidal dispersions of metal micro- or nanoparticles 
or metal-organic decomposition inks (so-called MOD or precursor 
inks), which consist of metal ions bond in organic complexes. One 
main advantage of the latter is that those inks are particle-free 
since metal-organic complexes can be dissolved in various solvents. 
Another advantage is the comparably low temperature that is 
needed for posttreatment. Here, the metal-organic complex only 
needs to be decomposed to form a conductive metal layer, whereas 
for nanoparticle inks sintering is required for providing conductivity. 
The preparation of MOD inks includes the choice of organic ligands 
as well as the corresponding solvents and can be quite complex. It 
will therefore not be discussed at this point.
	
Alternatively, it is possible to create colloidal dispersions by finely 
distributing metals in a carrier liquid. This can be achieved in such 
a manner as to obtain a composition that forms a macroscopically 
homogeneous phase, with fluid mechanical properties that can 
entirely be discerned in terms of viscosity, and with interfacial 
properties that can be condensed in surface tension and the 
phenomena associated with this. Nevertheless, colloidal dispersions 
such as silver inks or dispersions of semiconducting zinc or titanium 
oxides have specific features the printer ought to be aware of.
	
By virtue of van der Waals attractions the particles in a dispersion 
tend to form clusters, agglomerate, and drop out of the solution. To 
prevent this, chemists have to provide a stabilization mechanism. 
One distinguishes electrostatic and steric stabilization.
	
In electrostatically stabilized dispersions the dispersed particles 
carry electric charges of identical polarity on their surfaces. The 
respective countercharges are distributed as ions in the carrier 
liquid, forming an electric double layer of some width around each 
particle.

59
	
In contrast, steric stabilization is achieved by attaching 
amphiphilic molecules to the particle surface. The polar groups 
of such surfactants bind to the particle, whereas the nonpolar 
parts can enhance the chemical affinity of the particle surface to 
the liquid and endow the coated particle with a finite amount of 
dissolution enthalpy. A typical example of a sterically stabilized 
dispersion is nano–zinc oxide coated with oleic acid. Such particles 
can be dispersed in nonpolar solvents such as toluene, hexane, 
or decane. Concerning viscosity, colloidal dispersions resemble 
polymer solutions in many aspects. Diluted dispersions are usually 
Newtonian. With increasing concentration a pronounced increase in 
viscosity is often observed.
	
Upon drying, a solid layer may form by gelling. This layer may 
still contain a considerable quantity of carrier liquid. On further 
extraction of solvent, air will finally be entrained between the 
deposited particles and agglomerates. This, in turn, gives rise to 
a large internal interface and intense capillary forces. These may 
redistribute the remaining colloid on the substrate, leading to a 
broad class of pattern formation phenomena such as, for example, 
the coffee stain effect.
	
In printed electronics, microparticulate suspensions of silver and 
other noble metals or metal oxides with up to 70 wt.-% of dispersed 
metal are frequently used. The particle size ranges between a 
few hundred nanometers to 5 µm. These formulations should be 
referred to as slurries, as they are usually not in a permanently stable 
colloidal state but are two-phase or granular mixtures. Applying 
them to the substrate requires specific deposition techniques, for 
example, screen printing, and drying must usually be supplemented 
by a sintering process at elevated temperatures.
3.2.3 Fluid Dynamics of Printed Liquid Films
One might think that the printing process is over once the printing 
fluid has been transferred to the substrate and the latter is being 
transported to the drying unit, and that solidification will not 
change the structure of the layer. But there are many hydrodynamic 
processes that occur in a wet film and that can change the printed 
result enormously. For many applications, the creation of thin, 
spatially smooth, and homogeneous films is necessary. Liquid film

relaxation, driven by capillary forces, may support this but may also 
lead to a failure of the whole printing process. In this section, we 
describe the most important aspects of printed wet films.
3.2.3.1 Wetting properties, static considerations
One of the principal properties of printing fluids is the wetting of 
the printing form and substrate. Wetting is defined as the ability of 
a liquid to supplant a competing phase—gas or another liquid—
from a solid surface and to bring the interfaces between the three 
participating phases into a thermodynamically more favorable state. 
Wetting properties can be characterized by the surface energies or 
surface tensions s of the respective interfaces and by the contact 
angle q, that is, the angle between the substrate plane and the 
tangent at the free liquid–gas interface that passes through the tree-
phase-contact point.
 
sLGcosq = sSG – sSL	
(3.12)
	
Here sLG is the surface tension of the liquid–gas interface and sSG 
and sSL surface energies of the substrate surface at the interfaces 
toward the gas and the liquid phase. One characterizes wetting 
properties by the wetting parameter:
	
S = sSG – sSL– sLG	
(3.13)
and by the energy of adhesion, the attractive interaction energy (per 
unit area) between printing fluid and substrate surface:

S > 0 is referred to as perfect wetting. A drop of ink that is 
deposited on the substrate is distributed over the whole surface by 
capillary forces. With respect to printing, the case of
 
sLG >> –S > 0	
(3.15)
is optimal, as it corresponds to a small contact angle, according to 
Young’s equation, and a reasonably large energy of adhesion.
3.2.3.2 Dynamic phenomena: The lubrication limit
Printing is a dynamic process, and a purely static view, for example, 
on the wetting conditions of the printing fluid, is of limited value 
only. The forces that occur during the printing process need to be 
carefully analyzed, because they enforce wetting of the fluid on the 

61
substrate as well as the formation of a liquid film, and therefore 
enable thin-film formation far beyond the static stability domain.
	
In principle, the printing fluid’s behavior could directly be 
analyzed with the NSE and the Stokes equation. This is the common 
procedure when macroscopic hydrodynamic problems such as 
valve and pipe flows, atmospheric dynamics, or even pyroclastic 
flows in geology are studied. In printing technology, however, liquid 
films with a thickness in the range of 1 µm are of interest. Here, the 
capillary and evaporation-related interactions of the interfaces to 
the air and to the substrate are much more relevant. In addition, 
the viscous friction of the liquid flow inside the printed layer or 
pattern needs to be taken into greater account. Besides velocity v 
and pressure p, we are interested in the local film thickness h(x,t) of 
the printed layer. Film thickness is a dynamic value, influenced by 
fluid transport inside the film on the one hand, and by evaporation 
of the solvent on the other.
	
With these assumptions, the hydrodynamic theory can be 
condensed to the lubrication theory. This theory has the additional 
advantage that the 3D hydrodynamic problem is projected to a 2D 
one, and hydrodynamic degrees of freedom become entire functions 
of the planar coordinates (x,y) of the substrate area. We assume that 
the film thickness h is much smaller than any lateral feature of the 
printed pattern. In this case, one may transform the Stokes equation 
into a closed differential equation for the local film thickness h(x,y,t) 
on the substrate surface. Flow velocities and pressure can finally 
be derived from h and its gradients. This equation is known as the 
Landau–Levich equation (LLE). We postpone its derivation to the 
exercises. It reads

level out surface inhomogeneities. The second term takes account of

volume-related pressures pvol such as, for example, gravity. The third 
term is related to the Marangoni drag, see Section 3.2.3.4.
3.2.3.3 Surface-leveling time
One important consequence of the LLE concerns the surface leveling 
of printed layers. Assume a freshly printed layer of a specific average 
thickness h0, see Fig. 3.2, that exhibits a surface topography given 
by a height function h(x,y,t) = h0 + h1(x,y,t), with |h1| << h0. This 
modulation may result from, for example, the drop-based transfer 
of the printing fluid to the substrate, or from viscous fingering, a 
hydrodynamical instability that occurs in the ink-splitting process.
Figure 3.2 Lubrication shear flow.
	
The surface tension will smooth out the modulation, but the 
speed of leveling is limited by the viscous friction of the fluid flow 
under the liquid surface. Using the LLE and expanding to first 
order in h1 one finds that leveling proceeds exponentially in time. 
Consider a sinusoidal height function with a specific wavelength l 
and amplitude Al(t) of a modulation that is oriented in, say, the x 
direction:
	
h1(x,t) = Al(t) sin 2px/l.	
(3.17)
	
This perturbation will smooth out exponentially in time, with a 
relaxation timescale of

(3.18)
	
As we see, relaxation time increases by the fourth order 
in l. Capillary forces may therefore be very effective for small 

63
wavelengths but rather slow on larger ones. Typical modulations 
in the micrometer range disappear within milliseconds, but those 
in the millimeter range need minutes. Moreover, relaxation is much 
less effective on very thin liquid films than on thicker ones.
	
This has some consequences: leveling of printed thin films 
containing volatile solvents should take place well before the film 
thickness has appreciably changed. We shall therefore briefly 
discuss the most important types of surface patterns associated with 
printing: printing form–related ones and ink splitting–related ones. 
Some of the most relevant printing methods, for example, gravure 
and inkjet printing, deposit arrays of liquid drops rather than 
continuous liquid layers. The characteristic size and wavelength of 
such modulations are defined by the gravure pattern of the printing 
form or by the nozzle spacing of the inkjet print head (printing 
form–related pattern). In contrast, ink splitting–related patterns 
created by hydrodynamic nip instabilities (viscous fingering) are 
related to film thickness and printing speed vv, and the predominant 
wavelength

and is remarkably decreasing as the printing speed is raised. Both 
types of perturbations may be in conflict with the drying process, 
and we observe from Eq. 3.20 that the leveling time of the viscous 
fingering problem can at least be reduced by increasing the printing 
speed.
3.2.3.4 Marangoni effect
It is not surprising that the surface tension s of a solution or a 
mixture depends on the relative concentration of its components, 
and that it can be interpolated between the values of the pure 
components. Consider a printing liquid that is composed of some 
solute and a solvent. Assume that the fraction (in wt.-%) of the 
solute is j, and consequently, the fraction of the solvent is 1 – j. We 
Fluid Formulation: Making Functional Materials Printable

64
Printing and Processing Techniques
may define the coefficient sj = ∂s/∂j, called the solutal Marangoni 
coefficient, which is characteristic of the mixture. It is positive if the 
surface tension of the solute is higher than that of the solvent, and 
negative in the opposite case. As an example, the surface tension of 
a solution of P3HT in toluene decreases by –0.26 mNm per wt.-% of 
P3HT that is added to the toluene. We emphasize that sj is usually 
not constant over the full range of concentrations. In addition, it 
is not possible to estimate this coefficient on the base of chemical 
similarities, in particular when one of them has a rich molecular 
morphology such as P3HT. When P3HT is dissolved in orthoxylene 
instead, the surface tension increases by +0.2 mNm per wt.-% of the 
polymer. It may seem that these shifts of surface tension are small 
and that such a small change in concentration is unlikely to have any 
noticeable effect on substrate wettability.
	
But the solutal Marangoni effect may lead to a lateral transport of 
printing fluid inside the film. It has the ability to move the deposited 
material over distances of several millimeters. This can result in 
severe layer thickness variations after drying.
	
Introducing this into Eq. (3.16) yields a generalized LLE, which is 
applicable to the relaxation phase of the printed layer:

The concentration gradient

effect and can be calculated from the respective diffusion-convection 
equation in the liquid film. Analyzing this equation along the same 
lines as in the leveling problem, that is, by considering the reaction 
on a small periodic perturbation of a wavelength l, one finds that a 
second type of process takes place, with a characteristic timescale of

Marangoni forces can either result in the relaxation of the 
perturbation or in spontaneous pattern formation, depending on 
the sign of sj. This, in turn, depends crucially on the materials and 
the solvents used. In case of a negative sj, the leveling process will 
be inverted, and local thickness differences in the liquid film will 
grow in time. As a consequence, the Marangoni drag may give rise to 
spontaneous de-wetting, irrespective of the question of whether the 
wettability of the substrate has initially been achieved.

65
	
For a full discussion of this topic, we would like to refer to the 
Further Readings section. We emphasize that practice may comprise 
more pattern formation phenomena than assumed here and that 
lateral fluid transport, solute diffusion, and solvent evaporation may 
cause similar effects as well. Nevertheless, our simplified calculation 
shows that successful printing is dependent on the deliberate choice 
of the used materials and material combinations.
3.3 Substeps of Printing
For analyzing the printing process for electronics, we come back 
to the definition of printing we introduced at the beginning of this 
chapter: The reproduction of patterns by transfer of matter (printing 
ink or fluid, or toner) to a surface by mechanical force (i.e., printing 
pressure), hydrodynamic stress (e.g., inkjet printing), electric fields 
or radiation (e.g., laser structuring).
	
This definition comprises much more than only the very act 
of transfer of a printing fluid to a substrate but implies a specific 
sequence of substeps to be done, which are:
	
Substep 0: Conditioning (0 because it happens before printing)
	
Substep 1: Fluid Acquisition
	
Substep 2: Predosing
	
Substep 3: Dosing
	
Substep 4: Transfer
	
Substep 5: Relaxation
	
Substep 6: Drying
	
These substeps, although not independent of each other, can be 
understood with the aid of comparatively closed physical concepts 
of hydro- and thermodynamics. The printing engineer or machine 
designer can commonly provide various technical solutions by 
which each of the substeps can be performed. Which combination of 
the available methods should be selected depends on the properties 
of the printing fluid, the electronic device to be printed, and the 
substrate materials. In addition, the physics known about those 
substeps should be considered when defining printing layouts. In 
the following, all substeps are described in detail.
Substeps of Printing

66
Printing and Processing Techniques
3.3.1 Substep 0: Conditioning (of the Printing Fluid and 
Substrate Pretreatment)
Before the printing fluid is conducted from the reservoir into the 
printing unit it has to be homogenized by stirring. Gas bubbles 
and solid residuals have to be removed. In order to check whether 
the fluid composition is within the specified range, viscosity can 
be controlled and, if necessary, corrected by adding an adequate 
solvent. Finally, the ink must be heated or cooled to the specified 
temperature. Note that temperature has a significant influence on 
the fluid’s viscosity.
	
Substrates, for example, paper, polymer foils, or glass plates, 
are usually supplied as sheet stacks or on reels. When entering the 
printing machine, the substrate surface has to be made available to 
the components of the printing process: Sheets have to be individually 
separated or unrolled, and their surface has to be prepared for the 
deposition of functional materials. This implies that contaminations 
that may have resulted from the production process or storage have 
to be removed. Secondly, as the substrate surface is supposed to form 
a stable, permanent interface to the printed layers, the wettability of 
the substrate by the printing liquids must be ensured. This has to be 
done with regard to the specific printing fluid.
	
Usually, when a new type of substrate or printing formulation is 
considered for a printing process, the contact angle of the printing 
fluid on the substrate should be determined. If the wetting behavior 
of the fluid is not satisfactory, the situation can be corrected either 
by using a printing formulation with better wetting capabilities or 
by applying a plasma or corona pretreatment to the substrate. This 
serves the purpose of chemical surface activation and increases the 
surface energy of the substrate.
	
By corona pretreatment, an electrical discharge is generated 
close to the substrate surface. The intense electrical field as well 
as the ions and radicals created in the discharge region implant an 
electrical charge below the substrate surface, break up chemical 
bonds, or transform crystalline surface morphologies to a more 
amorphous state. This enhances the bonding opportunities to the 
molecules of a liquid deposited on the surface, thereby improving 
the wetting properties of the substrate and reducing the contact 
angle.

67
	
Within a plasma treatment, an ionized gas of specific composition, 
usually containing argon, nitrogen, or oxygen, is brought in contact 
with the surface. Depending on the type of ions contained in the 
plasma, specific chemical surface reactions can be initiated, and 
hydroxyl- or nitrate-bonding groups are created on the substrate 
surface. Moreover, the plasma is able to etch material from the 
exposed surfaces and increase its microscopical roughness. This 
not only removes possible residuals effectively from the substrate 
but also inhibits a possible de-wetting of the printing fluid from the 
substrate: the retraction of the solid–liquid contact line of printed 
patterns on the substrate is suppressed.
	
Note that the surface activation due to corona as well as plasma 
pretreatments has a limited lifetime. Depending on the substrate 
material the effect may last from only a few minutes to several weeks. 
It is advisable to apply the treatment directly before the substrate is 
processed.
3.3.2 Substep 1: Fluid Acquisition
In the preparation of the ink transfer step, a specific amount of fluid 
is provided by the reservoir for the distribution over the whole 
width of the printing form.
3.3.3 Substep 2: Predosing
For preparing the fluid transfer, the fluid has to be divided and 
distributed such that it can be applied to the printing form. In, for 
example, flexo printing, this is achieved by the anilox roller, which 
offers a constant volume of printing fluid per area of its surface to 
the printing form. This step is indispensable in order to guarantee 
that the printing form constantly acquires the desired amount of 
printing fluid according to the requirements of the printing layout.
3.3.4 Substep 3: Dosing
Dosing of the printing fluid is the specific task of the printing form. 
By its specific structure, each point of the printing form’s surface 
acquires a specific quantity of printing fluid that corresponds to the 
locally deposited fluid quantity as defined by the printing layout. This 
point is also the distinction toward predosing: it is the dosing step 
Substeps of Printing

68
Printing and Processing Techniques
that is responsible for the reproduction of the printing information 
as a pattern of printing fluid.
3.3.5 Substep 4: Transfer
When the desired quantity of printing fluid has been provided 
on the printing form, the transfer to the intended point onto the 
substrate takes place. Mechanical pressure, hydrodynamical shear, 
or intense chemical or thermodynamic forces can be applied to 
create the contact of the liquid with the solid substrate. A direct 
interface between fluid and substrate is created, and air and 
particle contaminations are supplanted from the substrate. For a 
short moment, wetting is enforced irrespective of any equilibrium 
properties, for example, the contact angle.
	
The conditions of enforced wetting are changed when the 
printing form is removed from the substrate or when the supply of 
thermal or radiation energy that drives fluid transfer is terminated. 
If fluid transfer is achieved by the use of solid printing forms, this 
is associated with the process of ink splitting. During ink splitting, 
the final interface of the printed liquid layer to the surrounding gas 
atmosphere is created.
3.3.6 Substep 5: Relaxation
The transfer process implies the creation of a free, highly mobile 
surface of the liquid film that is exposed to the also extremely mobile 
gas atmosphere. Naturally, the energy of the liquid film increases 
by the surface energy of the liquid–gas interface, and liquid film 
stability issues arise if wettability is insufficient. Moreover, using 
conventional printing techniques, the phenomenon of viscous 
fingering is frequently observed: the liquid surface of the deposited 
film develops finger-like structures that are neither intended nor 
encoded in the printing form.
	
The relaxation of the printed layer in the short period of time 
where the transferred material is still in the liquid phase is mainly 
due to a hydrodynamical flow driven by capillary forces. We call 
this the surface-leveling process. This refers to the wetting of the 
substrate as well as to capillarity-driven viscous flows at the liquid–
gas interface of the film.

69
	
If the conditions for wetting are insufficient, de-wetting of the 
printing fluid from the substrate surface may occur. The borderline 
of the liquid film at the edges of the printed area may retract. 
This has several consequences: printed structures, for example, 
conductive lines may disintegrate and decompose to a chain of fluid 
drops by a Rayleigh-type instability. Moreover, microscopically small 
holes in continuous films may increase in size. One should be aware 
that printed liquid patterns, consisting of a liquid film of constant 
thickness, bounded by a more or less arbitrarily shaped border 
line, are thermodynamically unstable for any nonzero value of the 
contact angle. Even at very small contact angles the fluid always 
tends to minimize its surface toward the gas phase. Depending on 
the substrate material and surface roughness, this may be prevented 
by borderline pinning and by contact angle hysteresis.
	
The second aspect of surface-leveling concerns the liquid–gas 
interface. Surface leveling is extremely fast on small-length scales 
but very slow on large ones. The time available for this process is 
essentially limited by the evaporation of the solvent. Therefore, the 
time of solidification of the printed liquid film should be balanced 
with the leveling time such that major surface inhomogeneities have 
an opportunity to disappear.
	
As the content of solid material in, for example, printing 
formulations of organic semiconductors is usually in the range of 
only 0.2 to 2 wt.-%, most of the volume of the printing liquid will 
disappear and the film thickness will shrink from a few micrometers 
of the wet film to typically few tens of nanometers. The concentration 
of solute in the liquid phase will rise at the same rate until the point 
of saturation is reached in the liquid film. From this point on the 
deposition of a solid phase becomes possible. Solid phase deposition 
is a first-order phase transition for solutions of materials of small 
molecular weight such as small-molecule semiconductors or for a 
number of organic colorants and dyes. Under adverse conditions, 
specifically in the case of even minute particle contamination, the 
formation and growth of isolated centers of crystal nucleation can 
be observed, a feature that makes the printing of small molecules 
particularly challenging. For polymer solutions, the solid phase 
mostly forms gradually by gelation and is less critical from the point 
of view of liquid film dynamics and relaxation.
Substeps of Printing

70
Printing and Processing Techniques
	
The rate of solvent evaporation is defined by the saturation 
vapor pressure of the respective solvent in the gas atmosphere at the 
given temperature and ambient pressure and by the diffusion and 
convection of the solvent vapor in the gas atmosphere. So, solvents 
with low vapor pressure can be used in printing formulations in 
order to slow down the solidification process. Active ventilation of 
the drying atmosphere will naturally accelerate solvent evaporation. 
Moreover, the gas diffusion constant of the solvent vapor is an 
important parameter of the evaporation process.
3.3.7 Substep 6: Drying (Curing, Sintering)
The process of drying refers to the essentially complete removal 
of solvent residuals from the printed film. When the film is already 
solidified, and capillary-driven displacement of the printing fluid is 
suppressed, the risk to sacrifice film integrity by applying heat is 
gone, and one may safely use thermal drying in order to accelerate 
the process. This is often also referred to as thermal posttreatment. 
Such thermal treatment is quite often mandatory for dispersions, 
for example, for conductive inks, or inorganic semiconductors. Here, 
it serves not only to eliminate solvent residuals (drying) from the 
printed film but also to remove stabilizing agents from the surfaces 
of the dispersed particles (curing). Finally, it is usually intended to 
initiate some solid-state diffusion in the nanoparticles such that 
particle growth, the formation of solid and electrically conductive 
“necks” between adjacent particles, or even the sintering of the 
porous body to a dense solid layer can take place (sintering). The 
latter frequently requires temperatures on the order of several 
hundred centigrade, and sintering times between a few minutes 
and several hours. It is usually reasonable not to assign this task to a 
continuously working printing machine.
	
In some cases, the process of sintering can be accelerated by 
electromagnetic radiation. So-called photonic or flash sintering is 
available for specific materials. In this type of process, a short but 
intense pulse of light is applied to the printed substrate only to heat 
the printed layer, leaving the substrate material almost at its initial 
temperature.

71
3.4 Printing Processes
Within the organic and printed electronics community, several 
deposition techniques have been established for processing a large 
variety of functional materials. In this section we give a general 
overview of the most common techniques, starting with a short 
introduction to the main aspects and terms of printing.
	
Printing techniques are classified by the physical existence of a 
printing plate. If there is a printing plate included, they are termed 
conventional printing techniques. Techniques that dispense a printing 
plate are called digital printing techniques, as the printing form is 
only stored digitally.
	
Conventional printing techniques are characterized by the 
arrangement of image and nonimage elements on the printing plate, 
that is, surface elements that accomplish or abstain from deposition 
of the printed material on the substrate. One distinguishes between 
four main categories:
 
∑ Image elements are recessed compared to the nonimage 
elements (gravure printing, for example, pad printing)
 
∑ Image elements are raised above the nonimage elements 
(letterpress, for example, flexographic printing)
 
∑ Image elements and nonimage elements are located on the 
same surface plane but differ in surface polarity (lithography, 
for example, offset printing)
 
∑ Image elements and nonimage elements are located on the 
same surface plane but differ in permeability (screen printing)
	
Digital 
printing 
techniques 
are 
subclassified 
by 
the 
transformation of the digitally stored printing layout into physically 
existing information. In other words, by whether the printing layout 
is converted into the printed image directly on the substrate, as 
in inkjet printing, or if it is generated on some kind of transient 
printing form and transferred to the substrate in the following, as in 
electrophotography.
	
Conventional printing processes and especially the final fluid 
transfer can be reduced to a simple scheme where only three 
components participate in the process: One component that carries 
the fluid, a substrate onto which the fluid is transferred, and an 
impression component that presses the substrate against the fluid-
Printing Processes

72
Printing and Processing Techniques
carrying component. The geometrical character of these components 
is also used to distinguish printing presses. There is flat-to-flat 
printing (e.g., flatbed screen printing), cylindrical-to-flat printing 
(e.g., CD printing press), and cylindrical-to-cylindrical printing (e.g., 
rotogravure printing). Nowadays, terms like noncontact-on-flat are 
implemented in order to include the digital printing processes in 
this scheme.
	
Printing presses are additionally classified by the principle of 
substrate transport. The two most famous ones are roll-to-roll (reel-
to-reel, R2R, web-fed) and sheet-to-sheet (S2S, sheet-fed) presses. 
Roll-to-roll printing has become the flagship for organic and printed 
electronics as it stands for high-speed and cost-effective production. 
Nevertheless, roll-to-sheet and sheets-on-shuttle are used as 
alternative principles for substrate transport in printed electronics, 
as they both come up with deviating advantages, for example, in 
drying conditions.
	
An aspect that should be kept in mind is that the aims of 
functional and graphical printing are incompatible: within graphical 
printing, an illusion is created for the eye. Several single dots 
generate a homogeneous picture that is observed by the addressed 
human being at a certain distance of observation, for example, dots 
on bills are larger than in prospects as they are observed from 
larger distances. Within functional printing whole layers need to be 
created that have to fulfill a certain task, for instance, the conduction 
of a current. Even if those layers look perfect to the eye, the printer 
cannot rate their electrical quality without further investigation. 
Additionally, functional fluids are more challenging in handling than 
graphical inks and exceed many recommended limits concerning the 
characteristics (viscosity, surface tension). Therefore, several tips 
and tricks that are commonly used in the graphical industry are not 
transferrable to this relatively new area of device manufacturing.
3.4.1 Flexography
3.4.1.1 History and facts
Flexography plays an important role in the packaging industry as it 
is used for patterning foils, bags, cardboards, etc. The main principle 
is based on the letterpress technology of Gutenberg, who used 

73
single-raised metal letters for forming words and whole texts more 
than 500 years ago. In the last years, flexography has become one of 
the fastest printing techniques with speeds up to 1000 m/min (ca. 
16 m/s) at about 2000 mm print width and is the most economical 
letterpress printing technology today.
3.4.1.2 Principle of flexography
Figure 3.3 shows the principle of flexography. The inking unit 
consists of a fluid reservoir and an anilox roller, whereas the printing 
unit consists of a plate cylinder and an impression cylinder.
Figure 3.3 Principle of flexography.
	
First, the fluid is prepared and its viscosity is adjusted—
conditioning (0). The fluid, stored in some kind of reservoir, wets 
the rotating anilox roller—fluid acquisition (1). After wiping the 
excess fluid off, a defined amount of fluid is transported by the cells 
of the anilox roller—predosing (2). In the following step, the fluid is 
transferred from the anilox roller onto the printing plate, which is 
mounted on the plate cylinder and contains the printing layout—
dosing (3). As in all relief-printing techniques, the image elements are 
raised above the nonimage elements. The fluid is then transferred (4) 
from the raised patterns onto the substrate, which is pressed against 
the printing plate by the impression cylinder. Hence, there are 
two ink-splitting steps in total. In the next steps, relaxation (5) and 
drying (6) follow.

Printing and Processing Techniques
3.4.1.3 Characteristics of print equipment
The anilox roller comprises a steel core and a ceramic (see Fig. 3.4) 
or metal surface with engraved cells. It is an important part of the 
inking unit as it provides a well-defined amount of ink that will be 
transferred onto the printing plate. The cells of a ceramic anilox 
roller, which are responsible for fluid intake and transportation to 
the printing plate, are created by laser gravure. In comparison to 
cylinders produced from chrome mostly with mechanical gravure, 
ceramic cylinders have a longer lifetime and higher robustness.
Figure 3.4 Lab-scale ceramic anilox rollers.
	
The gravure angle describes the arrangement of cells on the 
surface of the anilox roller to the roller axis and varies from 30 to 90 
degrees (Fig. 3.5). Important parameters are the screen frequency 
(lines per cm) and the pickup volume (cm³/m²) of the anilox roller. 
The pickup volume is the volume of all cells in a defined area. Note 
that not all of this volume is actually transferred in the printing 
process.
	
For every new layout, a new printing plate needs to be produced 
(prepress). Printing plates are available as flat plates (Fig. 3.6), which 
means that they need to be bent in order to be mounted on the plate 
cylinder, or as sleeves, that are already produced as hollow shells 
for the plate cylinder. Printing plates are made of photopolymer 
or rubber. It should be mentioned that the shelf life of polymeric 
printing plates is limited to months, even if they are unused.

75

frequency and gravure angle.
Figure 3.6 Flexographic printing plate in its flat and unbound state.
	
For printing, the plates are fixed on the plate cylinder by double-
faced adhesive tape (see Fig. 3.7). This is a special rubber-like tape 
providing elastic compression and hence affects the printing quality. 
The mounting process of the flat plate onto the round cylinder 
causes stretching of the partly flexible structures, which can cause 
slightly distorted printing.
Printing Processes

76
Printing and Processing Techniques

Figure 3.8 Definition of engagement and nip position in flexography.
3.4.1.4 Process description
For transfer, the substrate is lightly propped to the printing plate 
in order to provide the necessary contact. The resulting printing 
pressure has an important influence on the printing quality and is set 
as follows: The impression cylinder and the plate cylinder are moved 
toward each other until they touch. In this case, the advanced printer 
calls it kiss printing, and the flexible printing plate is not distorted. 
In the next step, the distance between both cylinders is reduced 
until an acceptable contact area between both cylinders is formed 
by the deformation of the printing plate, called engagement (see 
Fig. 3.8). The contact area is called nip. This low-pressure setting is 
well-suited for multilayer printing. During processing, the printing 

77
plate is unrolled onto the substrate in a rotatory movement and 
forces the fluid to adhere to it. From there on, the printing process is 
finished by relaxation and drying processes on the substrate.
3.4.1.5 Experiences from a practical point of view
In conventional flexographic printing, layer thicknesses of several 
tens of nanometers can be reached. But processing those fluids is 
limited by their viscosity. In graphical industries, there is a rule of 
thumb: Fluids that have a viscosity below 0.5 mPa·s (1 mPa·s: water 
@ 20°C) will spin off the printing plate during rotation.
	
The most typical error in flexography is the so-called halo effect 
(see Fig. 3.9). This effect describes a line that surrounds the contour 
of a printed structure and that, therefore, looks like a halo.
Figure 3.9 Image of a graphically printed star showing the halo effect.
	
Due to incorrect settings of the printing pressure, the printing 
fluid is partly squeezed out at the edges of the compressible printing 
plate and this surrounding structure arises (see Fig. 3.10).
	
During printing, the printing plate faces complex stresses. 
Frequently changing mechanical load can damage it. Especially in 
combination with the influence of organic solvents, this can lead 
to a loss of detail after long runtimes. However most significant is 
the aspect of swelling of the polymer printing form due to aromatic 
fluids (e.g., toluene) in printed electronics. Besides that, interactions 
between the printing plate and the solvent-based fluids can cause 
Printing Processes

78
Printing and Processing Techniques
contamination of the printing result (printing form residua). 
Other issues in (industrial) flexography appear, for example, due 
to incorrect printing contact. For a deeper analysis of the effects 
mentioned in this section, we would like to refer to the works of 
Ranfeld and Theopold, which are listed in the Further Readings 
section.
Figure 3.10 Origin of the halo effect. Modified illustration from Ranfeld, see 
section Further Readings.
	
The most important advantage of flexography is the clear 
distinction between printed and nonprinted areas. Only raised 
image elements on the printing plate and no other parts are wetted 
with fluid and thus printed. On the other hand, the maximum amount 
of fluid that can be transferred is limited due to the twofold ink 
splitting. However, flexographic printing forms can easily be adapted 
to smaller lab-scale cylinders and are less expensive in production 
than lab-scale gravure cylinders.
3.4.1.6 Applications and current research
Flexography is often used in printed electronics for producing 
electronic circuits or transparent electrodes. For special applications 
printing plates with a resolution of about 4000 ppi can be produced 
today. These developments in printing plate manufacturing 
techniques show the increasing applicability of flexography for 
producing thin structures in printed electronics.

79
3.4.2 Gravure Printing
3.4.2.1 History and facts
Gravure printing today covers a wide range of utilizations. It is still 
used for artworks (e.g., copperplate print, aquatint) as well as in the 
mass production of high-volume magazines, catalogs, and packages. 
For economical premium-quality, long print runs, rotogravure 
printing is the most important technique today as it provides the 
highest resolution and best edge definition at high process velocities, 
up to 16 m/s, at about 3680 mm print width.
3.4.2.2 Principle of rotogravure
Common rotogravure presses (see Fig. 3.11) consist at least of an 
ink pan (fluid reservoir), a gravure cylinder with engraved cells 
(printing form), and an impression cylinder. As opposed to the 
letterpress printing techniques, gravure printing works with image 
elements that are not raised above the surface of the printing form 
but engraved into it.
Figure 3.11 Principle of rotogravure.
	
The prepared fluid—conditioning (0)—is commonly provided 
in an ink pan into which the gravure cylinder is immersed. As the 
cylinder rotates, the cells get filled with the fluid—fluid acquisition 
Printing Processes

80
Printing and Processing Techniques
(1). When the filled-up cells run out of the bulk fluid, the whole 
surface of the gravure cylinder is covered with a roughly even wet 
film—predosing (2). In the next step, the excess fluid is removed 
from the nonprinting areas by a doctor blade, resulting in equally 
filled cells that carry the amount of fluid that is finally available for 
transfer—dosing (3). Subsequent to this, the dosed fluid is transferred 
(4) onto the substrate by pressing the latter against the cylinder’s 
surface. It is obvious that there is only one ink-splitting step. As in all 
printing processes, the fluid transfer is followed by relaxation (5) and 
drying (6).
3.4.2.3 Characteristics of print equipment
Gravure cylinders (see Fig. 3.12) consist of a steel core covered with 
a skin that carries the image elements. The latter is a stack of a nickel 
layer, a basic copper layer, and a thin copper engraving layer. After 
engraving, the surface of the cylinder is chrome plated for more 
durability and protection against wear. With thicker copper layers it 
is possible to erase and even the surface by mechanical processes for 
a new image creation. Copper layers that can be peeled off after use, 
called Ballard skin, are also used.
Figure 3.12 Gravure cylinders for lab-scale printing presses.
	
Engraving can be done by etching, electromechanical gravure, 
or laser-direct gravure (see Fig. 3.13). All processes lead to well-
defined cells that are terminated by the remaining copper material, 
called cell walls. The cells vary in geometry and are specified by 

81
depth and area. Deeper cells can transport more fluid, resulting in 
thicker layers. Electromechanical gravure works with a diamond 
stylus (with a given stylus angle), resulting in a pyramidal cell 
geometry. For the etching procedure, a gelatin-based etch mask is 
used, leading to cells with a trapezoidal depth profile. Laser-direct 
gravure induces different cell depths and diameters by modulating 
beam diameter and energy.
Figure 3.13 Cells of a gravure cylinder manufactured by electromechanical 
gravure, etching, and laser gravure.
Figure 3.14 Microscopic image of a gravure printing plate showing screen 
angle α and the distance between two cells, which is defined as the reciprocal 
of the screen frequency (SF).
	
Important parameters for gravure cells are screen frequency 
(40–140  lines/cm), screen angle (30°–60°), stylus angle (120°–
140°), and tone value (10%–100%) (see Fig. 3.14). The volume 
of a cell is defined by those parameters, but the exact amount of 
Printing Processes

82
Printing and Processing Techniques
fluid that will finally be transferred onto the substrate can only be 
roughly predicted, even if those parameters are precisely monitored. 
Therefore, the fluid’s transfer behavior should be determined by 
the printer before ordering, in the best case by using a testing form 
that contains a large spectrum of different gravure parameters. 
An important point that has to be mentioned here is the limited 
availability of lab-scale printing forms. Production processes are 
established for standardized cylinder formats (specific diameters). 
Smaller lab-scale cylinders, therefore, lead to time- and cost-
intensive adjustments.
3.4.2.4 Process description
Common rotogravure presses work with an ink pan that is mounted 
below the gravure cylinder. By rotating the cylinder within the fluid, 
its surface gets covered. In smaller lab-scale testing presses the fluid 
is usually applied by a syringe or a pipette. In such a system the 
gravure cylinder is not permanently wetted, so the fluid can dry on it 
and thus change the result. This has to be prevented by using solvent 
traps and keeping the latency times short.
	
After having passed the doctor blade, the now well-defined 
amount of fluid is transferred from the filled-up cells onto the 
substrate. The emptying of the gravure cells is influenced by two 
important characteristics: the cell geometry (engraving process, 
screen angle), which is fixed for one cylinder, and the process 
parameters (pressure, velocity), which can be adjusted during 
processing. The printing pressure influences the emptying of the 
cells, typically leading to a more complete emptying as it increases. 
It is therefore very high for graphical printing on rough paper. For 
printed electronics, the pressure should converge to zero to avoid 
damaging the substrate.
3.4.2.5 Experiences from a practical point of view
Possible issues in gravure printing will be discussed in this section: 
Remaining or dried fluid as well as embedded air bubbles in the 
cells can reduce the transfer volume, which means that the desired 
thickness cannot be reached. Furthermore, incorrectly filled cells 
can lead to missing spots in the printing result, called pinholes (in a 
layer). Another issue is the transfer of fluid from nonprinting areas. 

83
As the surface of a gravure cylinder is very rough, the doctor blade is 
not able to remove all the excess fluid, which leads to a thin film on 
the nonprinting areas (see Fig. 3.15).
	
The greatest advantage of gravure printing is that the main 
machine parts (gravure cylinder, doctor blade, ink pan) consist of 
metal and therefore provide stability even against aromatic solvents, 
as well as long lifetimes. Another important aspect is the scalability 
of the printing velocity. Lab-scale, as well as industrial presses, 
cover a wide range of printing velocities (~0.1–16 m/s), which 
simplifies the transfer of processes significantly. In addition to that, 
gravure printing allows the printing of well-defined structures (edge 
definition) at high resolution in the micrometer range.
Figure 3.15 Gravure printed image. Due to wrong process parameters, the 
layer has not leveled out and single dots are visible. Additionally, the light blue 
layer surrounding the dots shows the transfer of fluid from nonprinting areas.
3.4.2.6 Applications and current research
Layers for OLEDs, OFETs, and OPV cells have already been 
successfully printed by rotogravure. Regarding the requirements 
of those devices, rotogravure is used for printing extended areas 
(OLED lighting) as well as very small structures (OFET channels). 
Printing Processes

84
Printing and Processing Techniques
Important aspects in today’s research are the optimization of the 
emptying of gravure cells and the reduction of solvent evaporation 
from the printing forms.
3.4.3 Screen Printing
3.4.3.1 History and facts
Over 2000 years ago, cultures in Asia, Africa, and Europe already 
used simple stencils to create repeatable figurative motives 
(symbols, labels) on textiles. The easy principle of squeezing ink 
through a stencil allows the reproduction of patterns on almost all 
kinds of surfaces (rough, even, plain, bent) and materials (e.g., paper, 
cardboard, plastic, metal, wood, ceramics, glass, foils), even for 
nontrained people. In printed electronics, screen printing is mostly 
used to coat materials, for example, for encapsulation, and printed 
electric circuits.
3.4.3.2 Principle of screen printing
A flatbed screen printing press consists of a screen (mesh mounted 
in a frame, see Fig. 3.16), a squeegee (doctor blade), a flooding blade, 
and a substrate holder.
Figure 3.16 A screen: mesh mounted into a frame.
	
The principle of screen printing is shown in Fig. 3.17. At first, the 
well-prepared fluid, conditioning (0), is applied to the screen, fluid 
acquisition (1). In the second step, the whole mesh is flooded by the 
fluid using a flooding blade—predosing (2). The texture of the mesh 

85
differs for printing- and nonprinting areas. In nonprinting areas, 
the mesh is covered with an impermeable mask layer, called stencil 
material (see Fig. 3.18).
	
The squeegee presses the fluid through the mesh at printing 
areas and brings it in contact with the substrate—dosing (3). When 
the mesh is lifted, the fluid adheres to the substrate, and transfer (4) 
takes place. Beginning with the removal of the mesh, relaxation (5) 
effects appear. At last, solidification and drying (6) occur.
Figure 3.17 Principle of screen printing.

material (purple) covers the fibers.
Printing Processes

86
Printing and Processing Techniques
3.4.3.3 Characteristics of print equipment
A common screen consists of a mesh that is clamped at a frame, 
which is mounted on a printing press (see Fig. 3.16). Typical mesh 
materials are natural silk, plastic, and metal. Another variant 
is a laser-structured sheet metal mesh. For printed electronics, 
metal meshes are usually used, which offer chemical stability 
against solvents and better accuracy than synthetic meshes. 
Important parameters of a screen are the mesh opening (SF), fiber 
(respectively thread) diameter, and geometry. Two important 
parameters in the squeezing process are the hardness (shore) and 
form (round, angular) of the squeegee (see Fig. 3.19). The stencil can 
be produced directly (photopolymer) or indirectly (transfer film). In 
flatbed screen printing, the substrate is placed on a table and the 
flat screen is mounted above. The distance between the substrate 
and the screen is called snap-off distance and forms one important 
parameter in screen printing. Mostly in graphical printing, but also 
for functional materials, cylindrical meshes are used (rotary screen). 
There, the screen is bent and mounted onto a hollow cylinder frame. 
The squeegee is placed inside, where it squeezes the fluid through 
the mesh during the rotation.
Figure 3.19 Squeegee in its retainer.
3.4.3.4 Process description
For the printing process, fluid needs to be placed on the screen. This is 
done by syringes or pipettes in a lab or by ink knives in larger presses. 
Predosing is realized by a flooding blade, which distributes the fluid 

87
on the whole mesh without pressure, not bending it. This is followed 
by the operation of the squeegee, where the mesh is put under local 
stress and bent, while the fluid is squeezed through it and brought 
in contact with the substrate. The squeezed fluid then adheres to the 
substrate surface and is drawn out of the slots as the elastic mesh lifts 
off the substrate. Therefore, a small snap-off distance (2–3 mm for 
synthetic meshes and down to 0.5 mm for metal systems) between 
the screen and substrate is necessary. While pulling the mesh out, 
fluid also adheres to the fibers and forms ligaments. This means that 
the wet layer becomes thicker underneath the mesh fibers than in 
the mesh openings (see Fig. 3.20), which results in rough surfaces. 
With screen printing, it is possible to reach higher layer thicknesses 
than with any other printing technique. For thin lines, the layer 
thickness can be controlled by the thickness of the remaining stencil 
material in the nonprinting areas. Only the fluid that is settled in the 
cross-sectional area between the top and the bottom of the mesh is 
transferred to the substrate as the squeegee is pulled over it. Due to 
the flexibility of the squeegee, this does not work for large layers. 
Here, only the mesh determines the resulting layer thickness. The 
stencil should be thin to avoid raised edges.
Figure 3.20 Schematic cross-section of a mesh.
	
One important difference between screen printing and other 
techniques is the usage of highly viscous pastes. Fluids with a 
viscosity smaller than 200 mPa·s would just run through the open 
mesh during flooding. Therefore, the paste viscosity always needs 
to match the mesh opening. This limits the spectrum of materials 
that can be processed with screen printing. For highly viscous paints 
(500–5000 mPa·s), graphical layers vary in thickness from 20 to 
100 µm. The minimum feature size approximates 70 µm. When 
Printing Processes

88
Printing and Processing Techniques
integrating screen printing steps into a workflow, one needs to 
consider that flatbed screen printing is a relatively slow process.
3.4.3.5 Experiences from a practical point of view
First of all, screen printing is a very robust process. This means 
that it has a large tolerance concerning the parameter settings, for 
example, squeegee hardness and form or velocity. If the combination 
of screen and fluid is chosen correctly, even untrained people often 
succeed in printing.
	
The main reasons for nonsatisfactory printing results are 
discussed here: One important factor is the matching of the particle 
size and the mesh opening. The mesh opening should be at least 
threefold larger than the particle size (rule of thumb). If it is 
smaller, the particles tend to block the mesh. Blocking of the mesh 
can also occur if the fluid dries too fast. Both lead to missing bits in 
the printing result. Additionally, a massive squeegee pressure or a 
slack mesh can cause slurring effects. Screen-printed images can be 
identified by the characteristic wavy edges. Those inaccurate edges, 
sawtoothing (see Fig. 3.21), can take shape enormously if unsuitable 
printing parameters are used. This effect is often caused by a false 
squeegee pressure in combination with thin stencil layers.
Figure 3.21 Sawtoothing on screen-printed letters.
	
To sum the facts up, screen printing is a relatively slow technique 
that is limited concerning the fluid’s viscosity. Screen printing 
cannot reach the register accuracy of other printing techniques and 

89
suffers from inaccurate edges of the printed image. But it convinces 
as a robust technique that can handle particle-based fluids (range 
of micrometers) and that can easily be learned even by untrained 
people. It also allows large-area printing in the range of square 
meters and guarantees sufficiently thick layers, for example, for 
good conductivities.
3.4.3.6 Applications and current research
Screen printing was the first printing technique used for electronic 
components. Since silver was discovered as an electrical contact 
for the first time in the 1930s, screen printing of silver conductors 
has become a popular processing technique for many applications. 
The first researches on printed circuits were documented in 1959. 
In the automotive section, for example, heating elements for rear 
windows are produced this way. Furthermore, in printed electronics 
components like electrodes and wires for solar cells have been and 
are still successfully produced.
3.4.4 Inkjet Printing
3.4.4.1 History and facts
The serial production of the first computer systems in the 1950s 
and the fast technical development of commonly used devices in 
the subsequent years forced the need for new ways to reproduce 
electronically stored information. In 1951 the patent for an inkjet 
electrocardiogram printer, called Mingograf, built the basis for 
modern inkjet technology. Further development, combined with 
knowledge in liquid droplet physics, created fast, accurate, and 
affordable inkjet devices for personal use. Today inkjet printers are 
found in many small offices/home offices (so-called SOHO sector) for 
printing all kinds of documents and images on paper.
3.4.4.2 Principle of inkjet
Inkjet printers differ from conventional printing presses in 
construction and functionality. The main differences are the 
contactless ink transfer, because of which it is called a nonimpact 
printing (NIP) technique, and the absence of a physically existing 
printing plate.
Printing Processes

90
Printing and Processing Techniques
	
In inkjet printing, the printing unit is called a print head and 
contains the required circuits and nozzles (see Fig. 3.22). The fluid 
supply differs for industrial and lab-scale presses: In industrial 
presses, there is usually a fluid tank that is connected to the 
print head, whereas in smaller presses cartridges are often used. 
Cartridges, usually known as office inkjet printers, are enclosed 
reservoirs that are mounted onto the print head.
	
There are two main concepts of drop formation. One is the drop-
on-demand (DOD) technique, which only produces fluid droplets 
if needed, and the other one is the continuous technique, where a 
constant droplet stream is produced and unneeded droplets are 
removed before striking the substrate surface. Both techniques are 
subclassified by the actuators that are responsible for the fluid’s 
excitation, for example, piezo or thermal elements.
Figure 3.22 Principle of a DOD piezo inkjet.
	
In the following section, the subprocesses within a DOD piezo 
inkjet print head are described (see Fig. 3.22). First, the fluid is 
homogenized, and its viscosity is set—conditioning (0). Filled into a 
cartridge and connected to the print head, the fluid becomes available 
for the printing process—fluid acquisition (1). In the following step, 
the fluid is accelerated onto the substrate in several steps that are 
mostly overlapping in time and therefore not clearly de-limitable. 
Here, the internal pressure is changed (positive or negative) by the 
deformation of a piezo element. First, fluid is primed from the fluid 
reservoir—predosing (2). Pressure waves inside the fluid guarantee 

91
the transport of a well-defined amount of fluid through the ink 
channel and out of the orifice—dosing (3). At the orifice, droplet 
formation is initiated. If the fluid droplet detaches from the orifice, 
the transfer (4) process begins. The fluid passes a small distance to 
reach the substrate surface. On the substrate relaxation (5) occurs 
followed by drying (6) and solidification of the fluid.
3.4.4.3 Characteristics of print equipment
Print heads consist of an ink supply channel, an electromechanical 
actuator circuit, an ink channel, and nozzles. The print head is 
connected to the fluid reservoir via the ink supply channel. The 
actuator circuit transforms the digital signals received from the 
computer into pressure waves that prime, excite, and spread the 
fluid in the ink channel. For droplet formation, fluid is accelerated 
toward and ejected out of the nozzle.
	
The nozzle plate usually consists of nickel or silicon and could 
be plated with, for example, tantalum or palladium. With etching 
techniques, several hundred to thousand nozzles and channels are 
created. Commonly, nozzles have an inner diameter of 10–100 µm. 
Each nozzle can be separately controlled during printing. Smaller 
distances of printed drops are realized by tilting the print head.
3.4.4.4 Process description
Inkjet printing always starts with the conditioning of the fluid. 
The fluids often need to be mixed again in order to guarantee a 
homogeneous distribution of, for example, nanoparticles. Due to the 
small nozzles, clogging by particle agglomerates and gas pockets is 
always an issue and must be avoided. Therefore, the remixed fluid 
needs to be de-gassed before it is filled into the cartridge. After 
connecting the filled cartridge to the print head, the hardware is 
ready to be used.
	
Next, the printer’s software needs to be fed with the printing 
layout, appropriate signals for the actuator, and the cleaning and 
printing cycles. Well-prepared from both sides (hardware and 
software), the printing process can start.
	
In DOD, droplets are forced to pass out of the nozzle by creating 
excess pressure inside the ink chamber (due to volume change). 
This can be realized by local heating and vaporization of the fluid, 
Printing Processes

92
Printing and Processing Techniques
that is, via thermal elements, or by mechanical distortion of a 
piezo element. For the piezo technology, the driving signal of the 
piezo actuator is the most important parameter, as it controls the 
hydrodynamic process of droplet formation. Finding an adequate 
pulse shape may be quite complex, as each signal usually comprises 
a sequence of pulses distinct in amplitude and duration time. Hence, 
this is termed a waveform. The waveform needs to be adapted to 
the used printing fluid. Thermal inkjet systems locally heat the fluid 
until it evaporates. These high temperatures can negatively influence 
the functional material and even destroy it before applying onto the 
substrate. Therefore piezo-based DOD can be a better alternative 
within functional printing.
	
For the continuous inkjet, a pump in combination with a piezo 
element is used to create the constant droplet stream. By deflecting 
certain drops, the printed image is generated. Additionally, a catching 
and recycling system is necessary to collect the fluid for nonprinting 
areas or during changeover times, to clean it, and to feed it back into 
the reservoir.
3.4.4.5 Experiences from a practical point of view
The orifices of the print head are driven in a distance of about 1 to 
2 mm to the substrate surface. Drops in DOD form elongated tails or 
ligaments while flying. Under specific conditions and depending on 
the fluid properties, the fluid ligament can rupture, causing satellite 
drops to emerge. Satellite drops can cause inaccurate printing results 
and noncircular footprints.
	
The compatibility of the fluid’s and the substrate’s surface 
tension is even more important for inkjet printing than it is for 
conventional printing techniques. Owing to the fact that the ink 
droplet is accelerated onto the substrate and starts spreading there, 
fluid dynamics totally differ from those that follow the ink-splitting 
process after the lift-off of any kind of printing plate. This is why 
surface pretreatment is an often-used tool in inkjet printing. For 
printing whole areas or straight lines, the distance between two dots 
needs to be adjusted sensitively. The printed dots should overlap 
partly in order to create one hydrodynamic system that is able to 
form a closed layer. Otherwise, the results can be defective, showing 
individual drops, scalloped or bulging lines, or stacked coins.

93
	
One important advantage of the inkjet technology is its 
compatibility with fluids with low viscosity (e.g., small-molecule 
formulations). Therefore, many fluids that are not suitable for 
conventional printing technologies can be processed with inkjet. 
Typically, the fluid is enclosed in a cartridge and is therefore protected 
against solvent evaporation and environmental influences. However, 
particle-based fluids, even with nanoparticles, or volatile fluids often 
lead to clogging of the nozzles. Depending on the print head, clogged 
nozzles can be reinitiated by simple cleaning or in the worst case 
need to be replaced, which usually means that the whole print head 
needs to be replaced. Additionally, inkjet fluids have short shelf lives 
(only a few months) and often fluctuate in quality among different 
batches of production. Two important advantages are based on the 
NIP principle: First, the moving height of the print head is easily 
adjustable to quite a large spectrum of substrate thicknesses and 
forms, and second, the contactless fluid transfer prevents damage to 
underlying layers.
	
Moreover, depending on the substrate dimensions, inkjet 
printing can be slow because of the limited number of nozzles and 
print heads. Today, industrial machines reach 5 m/s and provide 
up to 2000 nozzles per print head. New developments, like the 
Memjet print head, are static and nonmoving and include page-wide 
print heads with up to 70,400 nozzles. This is different in lab-scale 
printers, where printing often occurs with five or fewer nozzles. Here, 
printing an image of approx. 620 cm² (DIN A4) can take hours and 
is only feasible for research applications. Additionally, advantages 
like the easy use of inkjet due to digitally adjustable parameters can 
also quickly turn into disadvantages. If the waveform is not given 
by the ink supplier, the development of the waveform can become 
very complicated and time intensive. Also, the parameters cannot be 
transferred to the print heads of other manufacturers.
3.4.4.6 Applications and current research
Numerous publications within the last years and the permanently 
increasing offer of inkjet fluids show the popularity and success 
of inkjet printing technologies. Compared to conventional printing 
techniques, inkjet is cheap (initial cost, no printing plate production, 
small amounts of fluid, less waste of fluid), easy to use (complicated

waveforms are often given by ink suppliers), and ideal for single 
sample fabrication (digital printing technique). The range of inkjet 
goods is therefore widely spread, for instance, silver-based back 
electrodes for solar cells, organic active layers for OLEDs, and 
dielectric layers. Common inkjet printers can reach a feature size of 
30 µm (~1 picoliter). But the creation of droplets with a diameter of 
less than 1 µm (subfemtoliter) has already been published.
3.4.5 Coating Techniques
The difference between printing and coating is the ability of 
printing techniques to create images that are shaped irregularly in 
two dimensions (layer thickness is the third dimension). Coating 
techniques are established processes that are used from small-scale, 
for example, spin coating of silicon wafers, to large-area coatings, 
and easy-release coatings in the square-meter range. The three most 
important techniques will be introduced in this section.
3.4.5.1 Spin coating
Spin coating is a highly reproducible lab-scale method used as a 
reference method for producing, for example, thin films of organic 
semiconductors and verifying the layer formation capabilities of 
printing formulations. Only small quantities of liquid are required, 
but the size of the substrates is limited to usually not more than a 
few centimeters in diameter.
	
A drop of the liquid is deposited in the center of the substrate, 
which is mounted on an electrically driven spinning plate. When 
the spinning plate is accelerated to a specific revolution rate for a 
specified time, the liquid drop is spread over the substrate surface 
by centrifugal forces and abundant liquid is thrown off the substrate 
from the rim (see Fig. 3.23).
	
For the remaining liquid film, the balance between centrifugal 
and viscous forces gives rise to the formation of a smooth and 
homogeneous layer, and the layer thickness is almost constant over 
the whole substrate surface. The layer thickness h can be estimated 
from the rotational speed n (in rpm), and the spinning time ts as 
follows:

where r is the mass density of the liquid (in kg/m3) and h the 
viscosity. This formula is useful to determine the spinning time or 
rotational speed that is required to create thin liquid films of well-
defined thickness. It applies, however, only in case that evaporation 
from the liquid films can be neglected. Depending on the fluid’s mass 
density and viscosity, layer thicknesses from tens of nanometers to 
several micrometers can be fabricated.
Figure 3.23 Scheme of fluid dynamics on a spin coater.
	
If solvent evaporation is substantial, and provided that spinning is 
continued until the deposited film has dried by solvent evaporation, 
the thickness can be estimated as

where k is a solvent-specific constant proportional to the saturation 
vapor pressure in the gas atmosphere and to the vapor diffusivity. 
The result essentially represents the film thickness at which further 
thinning by liquid flowing to the rim of the substrate is inhibited by 
viscous friction. It should be noted that the actual thickness of the 
dry film also depends on the fraction of solute that is contained in 
the film at this stage.
3.4.5.2 Slot-die coating
Slot-die coating is a well-known technology for roll-to-roll large-
format coating with the ability to deposit a micrometer-thin 
Printing Processes

96
Printing and Processing Techniques
homogeneous layer with a large area. It is famous for very high 
throughput and cost efficiency. This technology has a long tradition 
in the production of films for analog cameras. The heart of the coating 
system is a die with an extraordinary precision. This is essential in 
order to achieve an even coating in terms of constant thickness and 
surface smoothness. Dies are very expensive and manufactured up 
to a width of 5 m for a coating velocity from 0.2 m/min (0.003 m/s) 
to 2500 m/min (42 m/s).
	
A die is a closed application system with a chamber into which 
the liquid is pumped. A special pump provides very precise and 
pulsation-less metering of the liquid to the die. Depending on the 
viscosity of the liquid, layers in the range of 0.5 to 500 µm are 
achievable. The coating weight is controlled by the pump and the 
substrate speed. Transverse area coating weight and homogeneity 
are functions of the manufacturing precision of the die and the lip 
gap adjustment. The application can be realized with the contact of 
the die to the substrate but can also be contactless.
	
The advantages of slot-die coating are very high throughput and 
the usage of a closed system that guarantees the cleanness of the 
application and allows the use of solvent-based liquids. The main 
disadvantages are the high production costs of the die, the limitation 
to a roll-to-roll process, and the large amount of substrate that is 
needed until the process is running stable at the optimal velocity.
3.4.5.3 Blade coating
Blade coating is very similar to slot-die coating. Instead of a die 
with a closed chamber, a doctor blade (a knife) is used. The working 
principle of a doctor blade is known from other technologies like 
gravure printing or flexography: the doctor blade is installed toward 
a roller. To apply a specified film thickness, the gap between the 
doctor blade and the roller carrying the substrate, has to be adjusted 
very precisely. Alternatively, flatbed blading systems are used.
	
The advantages of blade coating are the easy construction and 
operation as well as the low cost of the system. Unlike for slot-die 
coating, there are some lab coaters available, especially for single 
sheets. Nevertheless, blading also exhibits disadvantages. The 
doctor blade is an open system, so solvents can evaporate and hence 
the rheological behavior of the liquid will be changed. The physics of 
the liquid flow at the doctor blade is very complex and influenced by 

97
parameters like viscosity, velocity, predosing of the liquid, and filling 
level of the fluid reservoir. It is quite challenging to produce a stable, 
homogeneous film. Even an unsteady thickness of the substrate can 
lead to an uneven film.
3.4.6 Laser Patterning of Thin Films
Laser process development utilizes the variability of light in terms 
of wavelength, pulse duration, spatial and temporal pulse shaping, 
and energy to adapt the process to the material properties. This way, 
the material can be molten, evaporated, decomposed, and modified, 
as required. Laser processes, like ablation, cutting, welding, and 
annealing, can be applied to many applications of organic and 
printed electronics. For OLEDs, micropatterning of TCO layers allows 
better control of charge carrier distribution, and large-area opening 
of barrier layers is required for electrical contacting. The integrated 
series connection of cell strips of organic solar cells benefits from 
laser patterning, while laser welding can replace lamination with 
adhesives.
	
For organic thin-film transistors with high switching speeds, 
channel widths of <10 µm are required. These small feature sizes 
cannot be achieved by fast printing processes. Resolution of a few 
microns or even submicrons can be realized by lithography or 
microcontact printing (µCP). However, both methods are rather 
time-consuming. Laser patterning is a versatile alternative that can 
reach the required resolutions. By fine-patterning of preprinted 
structures, roll-to-roll-compatible throughput is accomplished. Of 
course, the accuracy is also limited by the registration, which serves 
as a reference to which the optical system needs to be aligned.
	
High patterning speeds can be achieved by fast beam deflection, 
for example, using polygon scanners that use a multifaceted rotating 
mirror to deflect the beam, or multiparallel processing, which scales 
the process up linearly by splitting the beam. Laser processes are 
easily scalable to high throughputs and large formats. In a roll-to-roll 
process chain, laser processes can be combined with coating, drying, 
and lamination processes.
	
Printed electronic materials can be laser patterned by ablation 
or modification. During the ablation process, the material is actually 
removed from the substrate, while the modification leads to a 
Printing Processes

98
Printing and Processing Techniques
change in chemical and physical material properties, eliminating 
the conductive or semiconductive properties of the thin film. In 
principle, thin films on every substrate can be patterned by laser 
ablation. Substrate properties as well as wavelength, pulse duration, 
and other laser parameters have a strong influence on the ablation 
process. The absorption spectrum quantifies the amount of laser 
radiation deposited in the film, providing a first clue on how a certain 
material reacts to laser irradiation. Especially using ultrashort 
laser pulses (“ultrashort” denoting a pulse duration of less than 
1 picosecond) the intensity is high enough to enable nonlinear 
absorption phenomena, allowing the patterning of materials with 
low linear absorption at the laser wavelength.
	
When ablating thin films with laser radiation, four different 
mechanisms can be observed, depending on material properties 
and laser parameters. The different ablation mechanisms lead to 
different patterning results.
	
For photochemical or cold ablation (see Fig. 3.24a), the molecular 
bonds within the layer are broken, leading to material decomposition 
in the irradiated area. This mechanism results in steep and clean 
edges. Due to the mostly gaseous ablation products, little to no debris 
is observed on the sample. The thermal impact on the remaining 
films and the substrate is negligible. This ablation mechanism occurs 
when ultrashort laser pulses or deep UV wavelengths (l < 250 nm) 
are used.
	
During photothermal ablation (see Fig. 3.24b), the layer is 
molten and evaporated. The ablation mechanism is of thermal 
nature. Therefore, the surrounding material receives a high thermal 
impact. Around the edges, bulges >100 nm due to resolidified molten 
material remain after ablation. Laser pulse durations greater than a 
few hundred picoseconds mostly lead to this thermal process.
	
Especially when ablating brittle films with little adhesion to the 
subjacent layer by ultrashort laser pulses, photomechanical ablation 
occurs (see Fig. 3.24c). During this ablation mechanism, the laser 
pulse induces thermal and acoustic stress in the film, eventually 
leading to cracking as the thin film relaxes. The resulting flakes 
can be found as debris on the sample and as bulges at the edges of 
the ablated area. Due to the stress-induced nature of this ablation 
mechanism, thermal impact on the remaining material is minimal, 
which is beneficial for laser patterning processes. On the other 

99
hand, an additional cleaning process is needed to remove debris and 
bulges from the sample.
Figure 3.24 Ablation mechanisms that are observable when ablating thin 
films.
	
Blast-off ablation (see Fig. 3.24d) results in a similar amount of 
debris and bulging, although the ablation mechanism is different. 
If the laser radiation is absorbed weakly by the top layer and more 
strongly by the subjacent material, the subjacent material (thin film 
or substrate) is ablated. The resulting pressure explosively lifts off 
the top layer. Due to low absorption of the laser radiation in the top 
layer, the thermal impact on this layer is negligible. The substrate or 
subjacent layer, however, is damaged by this ablation mechanism.
	
In reality, most often a combination of these four basic ablation 
mechanisms is observed. The most favorable photochemical ablation 
mechanism can be achieved by choosing a material- and substrate-
specific wavelength and pulse duration.
	
Patterning via modification by laser irradiation below the 
ablation threshold can be beneficial compared to ablation. Here, 
laser radiation changes the electrical properties selectively by 
chemical or physical modifications of the material, reducing or even 
suppressing conductivity or semiconductive properties. In organic 
materials, the modification is based on the chemical altering of the 
p-electron system during the laser process. The modification of 
transparent conductive oxides is mainly governed by a change of 
oxygen content inside the film during laser irradiation. Due to the 
modification below the ablation threshold, lower power of the laser 
pulse is needed compared to ablation. In addition, the modification

Printing and Processing Techniques
does not change the topography of the film. Therefore, debris and 
bulging are avoided.
	
In conclusion, laser processes, especially laser patterning, allow 
versatile and flexible processes, extending the limitations of printing 
processes.
3.4.7 Additional Coating and Structuring Techniques
Many other printing or coating techniques are used besides the most 
popular ones, either as substitutions for or as additions to them. 
Each of them has different advantages and disadvantages and is thus 
preferred for specific applications. Selected techniques are shortly 
introduced in the following section.
3.4.7.1 Evaporation deposition
Evaporation deposition is probably the most commonly used family 
of deposition procedures for thin films in microfabrication processes.
	
Physical vapor deposition (PVD) essentially implies a transfer 
by resublimation of the evaporated material on the substrate. The 
equipment consists of a vacuum chamber in which a source material 
and the substrate that is to be coated face each other. As the source 
material is heated to a temperature in the range of its boiling point, 
particles evaporate and travel over the distance to the substrate. 
Here they condensate on the surface, thus forming a homogeneous 
thin film. Another option is chemical vapor deposition (CVD), 
where a source material from a gaseous phase is deposited onto the 
substrate via a chemical reaction.
	
Deposition rates can reach up to several nanometers per second, 
but layers of a few nanometers in a high-throughput roll-to-roll 
process can be achieved. Structuring can be achieved by using 
shadow masks. The main disadvantage of most of these techniques 
is the crucial need for a vacuum chamber since the evaporated 
particles need a high mean free path to travel without collisions with 
the substrate.
3.4.7.2 Photolithography
One of the most standardized ways to structure a surface is 
photolithography. It can, for example, be used to produce 3D 

101
structures in the nano- and micrometer range or to create an etching 
mask that can subsequently be removed from the substrate.
	
For this technique, first, a photoresist is coated onto the 
substrate in the desired thickness, normally using spin coating. 
This photoresist is then precured and dried to evaporate solvents. 
Afterward imaging by UV light takes place using a photomask. After 
final baking, the pattern is developed by washing away the exposed 
or unexposed regions of the photoresist, depending on the material 
used.
3.4.7.3 Pad printing
Pad printing can be seen as an indirect gravure printing process 
since the printing form is essentially the same.
	
First, the printing form is filled with fluid using a kind of doctoring 
chamber that removes all excess fluid. Then an elastomeric silicone-
based pad is pressed onto the printing form and lifted off again, 
taking with it the structured fluid film. Finally, the pad is lowered 
onto the substrate and lifted off again, thus transferring the fluid. 
The substrate can be either flat or a 3D shape such as a cup, a pen, 
etc. The fluid, which is typically solvent based for graphic arts, must 
be chemically compatible with the high silicone content of the pad, 
otherwise, it will not adhere to it. With this technique structure sizes 
of 20 µm can be reached.
3.4.7.4 Offset printing
Offset printing is an indirect lithographic process and represents 
today’s backbone in newspaper printing.
	
On the printing form, the printing areas and the nonprinting 
areas lie essentially in the same surface plane. While the nonprinting 
areas have hydrophilic surface characteristics, the printing areas 
are hydrophobic and thus ink-accepting. In a dampening unit, the 
plate is covered with an aqueous dampening solution that covers 
the nonprinting parts. In the inking unit, the ink is applied to the 
printing form and covers only the printing areas. This pattern is then 
transferred to a cylinder covered by a blanket that finally delivers 
the ink to the substrate.
	
Offset printing is highly dependent on many parameters such 
as ink viscosity or wettability parameters of all fluid–solid contact 
areas involved.
Printing Processes

102
Printing and Processing Techniques
	
The viscosity of the ink is very high compared to other printing 
techniques, that is, 40–100 Pa·s compared to ~0.1 Pa·s in gravure 
printing. The typical resolution in offset printing is 2540 dpi (i.e., 
structure sizes of ~10 µm).
3.4.7.5 Reverse offset printing
Reverse offset printing is an R2R-compatible printing process in 
which three cylinders are involved: a blanket cylinder (usually 
containing a surface made of PDMS), a stamp cylinder, and an 
impression cylinder. In the first step, a doctor blade is used to apply 
an even film of unstructured ink to the blanket cylinder. In the 
first nip, the stamp cylinder, whose surface contains the inversed 
printing layout in the form of a letterpress printing form, touches the 
blanket cylinder and completely removes the ink that is not needed 
for the reproduction of the desired pattern. In the second nip, the 
ink remaining on the blanket cylinder is transferred to the substrate, 
which is carried between the blanket cylinder and the impression 
cylinder.
	
Concerning the ink, two aspects should be considered: first, 
a good wettability of the printing inks on the blanket cylinder is 
mandatory. Second, after application, the ink should form a semi-
dried film on the blanket cylinder before it is removed by the stamp 
cylinder. This process can be used for sub-micron resolution printing 
of thin-film transistors, memory devices, or RFID tags.
3.4.7.6 Nanoimprint lithography
A means of structuring in the nanometer scale is nanoimprint 
lithography (NIL).
	
Here a resist is applied to the substrate in a thickness of 100–
1000 nm, typically using spin coating. Then a mold with the desired 
nanostructures is brought into contact with the resist. The final 
creation and preservation of the structures can take place in several 
ways, for example, by thermoplastic deformation or UV curing. 
These different procedures always call for adequate types of resists 
and mold materials. Especially for the latter, a UV-transparent mold 
is needed. Finally, after removing the mold, the structured resist can 
be used as an etching mask for the underlying substrate, or the resist 
itself is used as the functional material. Structure sizes of down to 
20 nm have so far been created.

103
3.4.7.7 Microcontact printing
µCP is a combination of standard photolithography and stamp 
printing used to create patterns of self-assembled monolayers, 
called SAMs.
	
First, a master has to be created using photolithography. The 
master is then used for the casting of an elastomeric PDMS stamp. 
This stamp is inked with the desired material, mostly thiol solutions 
that diffuse into the PDMS, thus creating an ink reservoir. When the 
stamp is brought into contact with a substrate, a SAM is formed in 
the pattern of the stamp.
	
On metallic substrates, such as gold, this SAM can then be used as 
a wet-etching resist. The resolution of this process is limited by the 
fabrication of the stamp and the master, but so far structure sizes in 
the range of 50 nm have been created.
3.4.7.8 Aerosol jet printing
In aerosol jet printing a wide range of materials can be deposited 
onto a substrate.
	
Here, a mist generator atomizes the source material, thus creating 
an aerosol that is refined in a virtual impactor to droplets of 1–5 µm 
and finally focused onto the substrate via a special deposition head. 
The possible feature sizes are about 10 µm, with layer thicknesses 
of 100 nm and above. The viscosity of the source material must 
lie between 1 and 1000 mPa·s. Despite a very low process speed, 
the advantages of this technique are that there is no contact of the 
nozzle to the substrate (nonimpact printing, NIP) and that it is a low-
temperature process. It is also very well suited for rough substrates.
3.4.7.9 Laser transfer printing
Laser transfer printing is a contactless printing technique like inkjet 
printing without the difficulties of using printing nozzles.
	
A continuous transparent belt is permanently coated in an inking 
station with an ink of metallic content. In an area of the belt where 
it is situated directly above the substrate, a laser beam actuates 
droplet formation from the backside of the belt. The droplet then 
falls onto the substrate and thus a printing pattern is created.
	
Printing speeds of up to 20 m/min can be achieved here with 
possible printing resolutions of around 60 µm.
Printing Processes

104
Printing and Processing Techniques
3.4.7.10 Xerography
Xerography, also known as electrophotography, is one of the digital 
printing techniques and mostly known from office laser printers.
	
First, a photoconductive cylinder is electrostatically charged by 
a corona unit. In the following, the surface charges are discharged 
corresponding to the data input of the image to be printed, using 
a laser or LED array. In the next step, the toner is applied to the 
cylinder, with the dry toner particles adhering only to the charged 
areas. Then the cylinder presses onto the substrate and transfers the 
still dry particles. Finally, the image is fixed in a fusing unit where the 
particles are melted and permanently secured to the substrate.
	
Alternatively, instead of the dry toner a fluid toner can be used. 
This process uses an intermediate blanket, similar to offset printing, 
to transfer the toner from the photoconductive cylinder to the 
substrate.
3.4.7.11 Plasma printing
Plasma printing is a process used for the structured pretreatment of 
mostly polymeric surfaces at ambient pressure conditions.
	
On the top electrode, a structured dielectric is applied. This 
structure is then pressed onto the substrate that itself is situated on 
top of a counterelectrode. The structure in the top dielectric forms 
microcavities with the substrate. In these cavities, dielectric barrier 
discharges are ignited by applying a high voltage between the two 
electrodes. This plasma modifies the substrate by changing the 
surface energy properties only in the area of the cavities.
	
Subsequently, the substrate can be treated, for example, by 
electroless plating (an autocatalytic deposition of metal layers 
from an ionic solution) to create printed circuits only on the parts 
pretreated by the plasma. The resolution of this process is in the 
submillimeter range and process speeds have so far been reported at 
a few meters per minute. Nondielectric and even metallic substrates 
can also be used if the applied high voltage lies in the radio frequency 
range.
3.4.7.12 Hot embossing
Hot embossing is originally a relief-printing technique for the 
finishing of brochures, calendars, or other high-quality commercial 
print jobs with metallic effects.

105
	
Basically, instead of a printing fluid a foil is applied to the 
substrate. This foil consists of several layers, most importantly of 
the metallic layer, an encapsulation layer, and an adhesive layer. 
Using a hot (typically 80°C–230°C) structured metal stamp, the foil 
is pressed onto the substrate. At the elevated areas of the stamp, the 
adhesive is activated and bonds the foil to the substrate.
	
Current approaches are to use the metal layer, which can, for 
example, be aluminum, gold, or copper, for conductive printed circuit 
elements.
3.4.8 3D Printing
The term 3D printing refers to the production of a three-dimensional 
object based on a digital 3D model using computer-controlled 
additive manufacturing processes, in which the building material 
is deposited, joined, or solidified layer by layer. There are currently 
several standardization proposals for the nomenclature of 3D 
printing and additive processes, even if the process itself is called 
3D printing or additive manufacturing (AM) is still an open question.
	
3D printing enables a new dimension in the design of technical 
components with a unique freedom of design. In addition to 
potential cost savings, benefits cited include shorter time to market, 
customization options, and the ability to manufacture very complex 
components at no additional cost (complexity for free). Although 
3D printing processes are still too slow and too expensive for large 
series, there are already products for which 3D printing is used 
exclusively. One example is the in-the-ear hearing aids, in which 
the outer shell is individually fitted to patients via a scan. In recent 
years, there have been increasing attempts to integrate electronics 
directly into the 3D-printed components during manufacturing.
	
3D printing AM processes have little in common with standard 
2D printing processes. The workflow required is also very different. 
The generic 3D printing process can be described in eight steps 
(modified according to Gibson et al., see Further Readings):
Step 1: 3D software model
A 3D software model can be created with CAD software, via scan or 
via download of a 3D model available on the internet. The geometry 
data is prepared in STL format, which only contains the outer 
contour of the three-dimensional component.
Printing Processes

106
Printing and Processing Techniques
Step 2: Slicing
The existing 3D geometry must now be divided into individual “small 
slices” by a so-called slicer (slicing software). These slices are then 
applied by the 3D printer in layers one after the other. The thickness 
of the slice depends on the selected 3D printing process and the 3D 
printer. Furthermore, the slicer determines how the component 
is to be structured on the inside. The result of slicing is a file with 
instructions in G-code format.
Step 3: Transfer to 3D printer
The file generated by the slicer must then be sent to the 3D printer. 
If necessary, some general settings such as the correct size, position, 
and orientation of the part are made.
Step 4: 3D printer setup
The 3D printer must be set up properly. This includes the material 
supply, the input of the required material parameters, the alignment 
of the build platform, or the setting of the energy sources.
Step 5: Building Process
The printing process is very often a largely automated construction 
process so supervision is often not necessary.
Step 6: Removal
When the 3D printer has finished the build process, the part must 
be removed from the 3D printer. With some 3D printing processes, 
you have to wait until the build volume has cooled down to room 
temperature. This can take several hours.
Step 7: Postprocessing
After removal from the 3D printer, there are further processing 
steps. Each component must be cleaned. Support structures, which 
are used as aids in the building process, often have to be removed. 
In some 3D printing processes, the components must also be 
subsequently hardened with UV light or sintered in an oven.
Step 8: Application
The components are now basically ready for use. If very flat surfaces, 
low component tolerances, or precise holes are required, then 
subtractive, machine finishing is necessary and common.

107
	
There are many different 3D printing processes on the market. In 
connection with printed electronics, some important processes will 
be briefly explained here.
	
Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), formerly known as FDM, now 
also called Material Extrusion (MEX), is an inexpensive and reliable 
process. A filament is fed to a hotend, melted there, and applied to 
a build platform via an x-y-z system. Many thermoplastics such as 
PA, PLA, PMMA, ABS, PEEK, etc. are available as filaments in various 
colors, pure as well as glass fiber or carbon fiber reinforced. FFF 
printers commonly have one hotend for one material. Optionally, 
printers with up to four hotends for applying four different materials 
are available. The diversity of materials, the simultaneous printing 
of different materials, and a large open-source community are 
strengths of this process.
	
Powder bed fusion with a laser as the energy source can be used 
for metals and thermoplastics. A layer of powder is first applied to 
a build platform using a doctor blade. The laser, controlled via a 
galvanometer scanner, melts or sinters the applied powder particles 
at the required positions. Then the build platform moves down, and 
the next layer is applied. Often, the entire build area must be heated 
to a defined temperature and then cooled down again in a controlled 
manner after the build process (to avoid warpage). Filigree 
components can be created with this process. Support structures 
are not required. However, the choice of materials is limited, and 
currently, several materials cannot be printed simultaneously.
	
Binder jetting is similar to powder bed fusion. Instead of sintering 
with a laser, the powder particles are bonded by a liquid binder, 
which is applied by an inkjet print head moving over the powder 
bed. Infrared or UV light can be used for drying or curing. A thin layer 
of the powder is then applied again, and the process is repeated, 
with each layer adhering to the last. After the part is completed, the 
unbonded powder is removed (depowdering). In a post-process, 
the component can optionally be subjected to various infiltrants or 
other treatments to achieve its desired properties. Even though only 
one powder material can be used, the component properties can be 
varied slightly by using different binders or binder amounts.
	
Stereolithography (SLA) is the oldest patented AM process, 
for which there are now several subprocesses. A light-curing 
Printing Processes

108
Printing and Processing Techniques
photopolymer, for example, acrylic, epoxy, or vinyl ester resin, is 
cured in thin layers by a laser. The process uses a bath filled with 
the monomers of the photopolymer. After each curing step, the 
component to be printed is lowered into the liquid by one-layer 
thickness. Then a controlled laser moves over the areas to be cured on 
the new layer. After curing, the next step takes place so that a three-
dimensional component is gradually created. In a post-process, the 
component is cleaned of the liquid resins and thoroughly cured with 
UV light. The process can be used to create very filigree structures 
with very smooth surfaces.

Printing techniques are categorized by the usage of a printing 
form (conventional vs. digital), by the arrangement of image and 
nonimage elements (e.g., gravure, letterpress), or by the principle 
of substrate transport (e.g., R2R, S2S). Different techniques can be 
identified by specific errors in the printed image, for example, the 
halo effect in flexography.
	
Printing can be separated into seven subprocesses: conditioning, 
fluid acquisition, predosing, dosing, transfer, relaxation, and drying.
	
Fluid formulation needs to be done for every functional material 
(polymers, small molecules, or particles). The printing fluids need to 
be adjusted sensitively in viscosity and surface tension for the given 
substrate, process, and drying conditions.
	
As long as printed layers are still wet, a lot of fluid dynamics 
occurs. In a perfect system, undulations in a printed layer level out 
before the layer is dried. But often new errors arise in the printed 
layers, for example, due to the coffee stain effect.
Tasks
Task 1: Viscous thin-film flows in lubrication approximation
Consider a thin liquid film of thickness h(x,y,t) on a solid substrate, 
with viscosity h and surface tension s. Assume that surface tension

equals the Marangoni drag and equals the gradient

further that the flow velocity v(x,y,z) continuously approaches zero 
at the solid surface and that viscous shear in the z direction is much 
larger than that in the x or y direction.

Task 4: Squeezing liquids between two plates
The key to Task (a) is to show that the flow velocity vj in the gap 
between the moving plates satisfies the incompressibility throughout 
the gap and the specific boundary conditions at the plate surfaces at 
z = –D/2 and +D/2. The first is done by derivation, noting that the 
component vy is vanishing everywhere.

Thus, the sum of the two derivatives is vanishing, which proves 
incompressibility. At the boundaries z = ±D/2 one finds by simple 
inspection that vx = 0, and vz = ±Ḋ/2: The viscous flow velocity 
coincides with the plate velocities at the plate surfaces.

As a technique for the production of organic electronics, printing 
has two main advantages: efficient use of the material and high 
production speed. For these to be truly useful, the quality of the 
printed layers—their thickness, homogeneity, etc.—must conform 
to the requirements of the produced devices. Unfortunately, this 
is not easy to reach. Getting close to the performance of a spin-
coated or evaporated device is only possible if the printing process 
is closely monitored and optimized. This, in turn, necessitates a 
precise measurement of the properties of the involved materials and 
the resulting device’s structural and electronic characteristics.

their detection, as well as techniques for proving the functionality of 
printed organic layers are covered.
	
Please note that while this chapter is devoted to printed layers, 
the characterization techniques and many of the typical defects 
are the same for other kinds of wet deposition, for example, slot-
die coating. Additionally, some literature on coating is listed in the 
Further Readings section.
4.1 Viscosity and Surface Tension
As described in Chapter 3, the printing process can be split into several 
substeps. For example, the acquisition of printing fluid, its transfer to 
the substrate and its relaxation on it—these are completely different 
processes described by quite dissimilar equations. However, two 
parameters always crop up in wet deposition: the fluid’s and adjacent 
solid’s surface tensions as well as the viscosity of the former. These 
can be complex, changing with strain, time, and the fluid’s solid 
content, and hence need to be thoroughly analyzed. In this section 
methods for the necessary measurements are presented.
4.1.1 Viscosity
The viscosity of a fluid moderates any flow within it. To be more 
precise, dynamic viscosity is the ratio of shear stress and shear rate. 
Dividing this by the fluid’s density yields the kinematic viscosity. 
Fluids are categorized by their viscosity’s dependence on the shear 
rate; some examples are shown in Fig. 4.1.
Figure 4.1 Typical viscosities h and shear stresses t over shear rate g .

127
Viscosity and Surface Tension
	
In the case of a shear-rate-independent viscosity, they are called 
Newtonian (e.g., water). Fluids can also be shear thickening (viscosity 
increases with shear rate, e.g., starch in water) or shear thinning 
(viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate, as that of ketchup) 
and even go from one to the other at different shear rates (e.g., some 
dispersions of hard particles). Additionally, these changes are mostly 
not instantaneous. If the viscosity’s time dependency is noticeable, 
this is called thixotropy for shear-thinning fluids and rheopexy for 
shear-thickening ones. Confusingly, multiple definitions for these 
two terms exist.
	
Some fluids only start flowing when the shear stress reaches a 
certain yield value and are thus called plastics. This behavior is often 
found in highly concentrated suspensions and dispersions (e.g., 
mayonnaise) and is normally unwanted in functional printing since 
it inhibits leveling.
4.1.1.1 Theoretical description of viscosity
That a fluid’s viscosity depends on the shear rate (e.g., forces in ink 
acceleration through the orifice in inkjet printing) and its history 
(e.g., forces during pumping the ink into the printhead) has to be 
taken into account when measuring its value and calculating the 
expected behavior of the fluid. For this, we need to estimate the 
shear rate the fluid is subjected to. For a Newtonian fluid in the 
absence of turbulence, this can be quite simple. A very basic example 
is the blading of ink with a knife that moves with velocity v at a 
distance d across a flat substrate. We can approximate the shear rate 
directly underneath the knife as that between two parallel plates:
	
g ª v d
/
	
(4.1)
	
If we take a distance of 10 µm and a velocity of 1 m/s, this yields 
a shear rate of ~100,000 s–1. The same formula holds true when 
calculating the shear rate for Marangoni flows, where the bottom is 
fixed and the surface is pulled along by its tension.
	
In most other cases, the shear rate is not constant throughout the 
sample, so without detailed modeling, it is only possible to calculate 
the range of the shear rates the fluid is subjected to. This can be 
enough to estimate its behavior if its properties do not vary strongly 
in this range.

128
Characterization Techniques for Printed Electronics
	
If, for example, a substrate coated with wet ink has to run 
vertically to reach the dryer and the ink’s viscosity is low enough to 
allow it to run, one can derive its behavior from the fluid flow in a 
river.
	
This is driven by the fluid’s weight, with one fixed surface and 
one free surface. The shear stress is dependent on the height; the 
more water is over the point of interest, the more weight lies above 
it and the higher the shear stress t becomes. In this case, the shear 
stress at height x in a river of depth h with density r and incline a is:

integrating over this, leading to half of a parabola:

If we come back to our initial problem and assume a density of 
1 g/ml, a viscosity of 10 mPas, a thickness of 10 µm and a vertical 
incline, the shear rate reaches approximately 1 s–1 at the substrate 
and the velocity of 500 nm/s at the surface.
	
The shear rates occurring in, for example, slot-die coating, can 
be estimated with a very similar calculation. Here, gravity—which 
is negligible in most applications—is replaced by pressure as the 
driving force. The fluid, in this case, is enclosed by two fixed parallel 
plates and thanks to the symmetry of the system, the central plane 
can be treated as free-flowing, as in the example of a river. The shear 
rate has its maximum value at the plates, is zero at the center and the 
resulting velocity profile is parabolic. If we set the origin of the x-axis 
in the center of the gap, the resulting equations are:

—with characteristic length L and 
velocity v—can be used to estimate whether or not a flow will be 
turbulent. The lower Re, the less turbulent the system. In many 
cases, turbulence starts to appear at the critical Reynolds number 
Recrit ª 2000, but the value can vary significantly depending on the 
geometry. Turbulence will dissipate additional energy and therefore 
increase the apparent viscosity.
4.1.1.2 Measuring viscosity
Viscosity generally decreases with increasing temperature, which 
means that measurements have to be conducted at a controlled 
temperature. Also, any measurement technique should allow the 
correct characterization of all types of fluids. The easiest way to 
achieve this is to exert the same shear rate throughout the whole 
volume of the tested fluid. This can be done with a rotational 
rheometer. Its working principle is simple: A fluid is wedged between 
two probes that are rotated against one another. The fluid’s viscosity 
is then determined by measuring the torque needed to sustain the 
angular frequency corresponding to a given shear rate (controlled 
rate) or vice versa (controlled stress).
	
If the aim is to determine the viscosity at certain shear rates 
that correspond to what occurs in certain processes, the obvious 
choice is to use the controlled rate mode. However, the controlled 
stress mode can be more straightforward for surface tension–
driven flows and allows directly measuring a fluid’s yield stress 
without extrapolation. It also allows analyzing viscoelastic behavior 
via creep and recovery measurements. Here, stress is applied for 
a set time (creep) and then turned off (recovery). In purely elastic 
materials, the probe will rotate slightly as the stress is applied, due 
to the deformation (strain) of the fluid. Afterward, it will return to 
its original position. If a purely viscous, Newtonian fluid is tested, 
the strain will increase linearly over time during the creep phase, 
and not recover at all during the recovery phase. A viscoelastic 
material will show a mixture of both behaviors and partially recover 
the strain at the end. Varying the stress over multiple measurements 
again allows precisely determining the yield stress of a fluid.
	
Elastic behavior can also be detected by applying a sinusoidal 
signal (oscillation mode) with a varying frequency and/or amplitude.

130
Characterization Techniques for Printed Electronics
	
Usually, it is not enough to measure the viscosity for one value 
of angular velocity or stress. To accurately plot the viscosity’s 
dependence on these values, it is in most cases advisable to vary 
them in a series of steps, allowing the liquid to reach a steady state 
before determining the corresponding viscosity.
	
This does not apply when checking the time dependency of 
a fluid’s viscosity. Here, one should measure its run after instant 
changes of the shear rate. A time-dependent viscosity will converge 
roughly exponentially to its steady-state value after the switches. The 
time constant derived from this commonly depends on the applied 
shear rates; a standard procedure can therefore not be defined. 
Instead, one should choose values that are typical for the analyzed 
processes, for example, ~1 s–1 for leveling and ~100,000 s–1 for the 
blading of the ink (for calculation see above).
	
Regardless of the measurement protocol, several types of probes 
can be used in rotational rheometers. Not all of these are ideal 
for non-Newtonian fluids. Suitable and easy to use is a cone-plate 
geometry. Here, the tangential speed and the gap height are both 
proportional to the distance from the center, leading to a constant 
shear rate.
	
Unfortunately, this system is unreliable at high shear rates. 
Turbulences often appear at ~1000 s–1, causing an apparent 
change in the viscosity. Even if this does not happen, the maximum 
applicable shear rate is comparatively low, as the fluid is simply 
spun out of the gap at some point. Dispersions with particle sizes 
in the micrometer range are also problematic due to the small gap 
at the center. Coaxial cups can reduce these problems. They have a 
constant gap and turbulences appear at much higher shear rates 
than in a cone-plate geometry. However, they are more difficult to 
clean and require more fluid. To avoid turbulences and clogging one 
may also use parallel plates, but here the shear rate is not constant 
throughout the tested volume. In this setup a non-Newtonian fluid’s 
viscosity will vary with the radial position, requiring a mathematical 
handling of the data.
	
A completely different approach is used in capillary and 
microfluidic rheometers. Here the viscosity is calculated via the 
pressure drop and volume flow rate of a fluid that is pressed through 
a capillary. This can be simple if the Hagen–Poisseuille equation can 
be used. Otherwise, several corrections have to be used to deal with 
the flow at the ends of the capillary, slip at the walls, non-Newtonian 

131
Viscosity and Surface Tension
fluids, etc. With these, it is possible to get reliable results for 
extremely high shear rates of more than 1,000,000 s–1.
	
There are simpler ways to measure viscosities, for example, 
by letting a sphere sink in a tube filled with the tested liquid or by 
measuring the time needed to drain from a cup with a hole in the 
bottom. These techniques are common in the printing industry and 
do give precise results, but only for Newtonian fluids. Moreover, 
comparatively large amounts (ca. 100 mL) of fluid are required. 
Hence, they may be suitable for quality assurance of a known ink, 
but not for a proper analysis.
4.1.2 Surface Tension
One of the driving forces of film formation is the surface tension. 
That of the fluid drives the leveling of the surface, and the relation 
between the surface tensions of fluid and substrate determines the 
fluid’s contact angle, which can—in principle—be calculated.
4.1.2.1 Theoretical description of surface tension
The surface tension of a substrate, in turn, is often calculated from 
the contact angles of test fluids on it. Several models for all of this 
exist, taking into account different interactions in different ways.
	
Normally, the Owens–Wendt–Rabel–Kaelble (OWRK, the names 
Rabel and Kaelble are often omitted) model is suited for organic 
electronics. This assumes that only van der Waals and dipole–dipole 
interactions can take place, splitting the surface tension s into a 
disperse and polar part s d and s p. The following calculations are 
based on this but can be modified to take different interactions into 
account. To find out the substrate’s surface tension ss, the contact 
angles of test fluids with different surface tensions sf are needed.

The parameters of at least two test fluids—a polar one, for 
example, water, and a nonpolar one, for example, diiodomethane—
with the corresponding contact angles allow a linear fit, yielding the 
substrate’s surface tension.
	
To measure the surface tension of a fluid, different test substrates 
could be used. However, it is easier to measure the fluid’s total surface 
tension and its contact angle on a nonpolar material like PTFE. The 
surface tension can then be calculated as

Note that other models not only take into account different 
interactions but also do this in different ways; here we refer to the 
models of Neumann and Wu as well as Oss and Good, which are cited 
in the Further Readings section.
	
Regardless of the selected model, the predicted contact angles 
cannot be trusted blindly. None of the models is suitable for every 
pairing of materials and the main problem for inks is that the models 
are all designed for pure materials, not complex mixtures of multiple 
constituents. It is not possible to tune an ink’s contact angle on a 
given substrate without proper tests, but a well-chosen model can 
still predict contact angles and the likely effect of a change in the 
ink’s surface tension on them accurately enough to significantly 
reduce the experimental effort.
4.1.2.2 Measuring surface tension
In general, only two types of measurement are needed to calculate 
the surface tension parameters of solids and fluids for any model: 
the total surface tension of fluids and their contact angle on solids. 
The former is also needed to calculate, for instance, the leveling time 
of an ink, its suitability for inkjet printing and Marangoni flows. One 
method to measure a fluid’s total surface tension is to analyze the 
form of a hanging (pendant) drop attached to a hollow needle. The 
height-dependent pressure within this droplet is counteracted by its 
surface tension. This can be determined with a fit to the droplet’s 
shape if its density is known. The main advantage of this method is 
the small amount of fluid needed—a few droplets. The disadvantage 
is that due to the small volume, drying can quickly alter the properties 
of an ink.

133
	
Another way is to pump gas through a submerged, hollow needle 
to grow bubbles and measure the pressure within them. This is 
proportional to the curvature, which is maximized when the droplet 
forms a half sphere. Its radius is then defined by the needle diameter 
and allows the surface tension’s calculation. With this method the 
age of the surface at the moment of maximum pressure can be varied 
via the airflow, allowing the analysis of dynamic effects.
	
A fluid’s surface tension can also be determined by measuring 
the force needed to pull a perfectly wetted sample out of it. Typically, 
rings (Du Noüy ring), rods, plates (Wilhelmy plate), or tubes of 
platinum, which have an extremely high surface tension, are chosen 
for this.
	
This method can also be used to determine contact angles; 
the force acting on a not-perfectly-wetted substrate will be equal 
to that on platinum times the cosine of the contact angle. A more 
straightforward method for doing this is to put a droplet on a surface, 
take an image of it at a low angle, and use a suitable fit function to 
determine the slope at the edge of the droplet.
	
Regardless of the measurement technique, the equilibrium 
contact angle of a fluid on a substrate can strongly deviate from 
the measured one due to the pinning of the contact line. This can 
be caused by inhomogeneities of the substrate (geometrical or 
chemical) that lead to certain spots being energetically favorable 
for the fluid’s outline. Interactions between some components of 
an ink and the substrate can also promote pinning, for instance, 
when particles dispersed in the ink stick to the substrate and serve 
as anchors for the ink’s outline. The extent of the pinning can be 
determined by comparing the contact angle of the receding and 
advancing edge (contact angle hysteresis).
	
In addition to the aforementioned techniques, there is also one 
not requiring any expensive equipment: Test inks (Dyne tester), 
often sold in felt-tip pens, with varying surface tensions. They are 
usually based on ISO 8296 (and the equivalent ASTM D2578), which 
defines their composition. These can be applied on a substrate to 
determine its surface tension as the highest value at which an area of 
6 cm² remains as a closed layer for at least 2 s. As with the simplest 
techniques for measuring surface tension, this is well suited for 
quality assurance of the substrate, but not for full characterization. 
Note that there are also test inks deviating from this standard in 
Viscosity and Surface Tension

134
Characterization Techniques for Printed Electronics
their composition (because the inks according to ISO 8296 contain 
formamide, which is toxic), as well as ones pertaining to different 
standards, generally giving only a yes/no answer to a wettability 
issue.
4.2 Structural Characterization
For any electronic device, there are certain demands on the quality 
of its layers. To meet these, one should know what kinds of surface 
structures can occur and how to decrease or enhance them. The 
fluid dynamic effects causing them and the influencing parameters 
are described in Chapter 3. This section gives a wider but less 
detailed overview and focuses on how to recognize them. The effects 
are grouped into those relevant for the lateral extent, the layer 
thickness, and the morphology. After their description follows that 
of appropriate measurement techniques.
4.2.1 Description of Structural Defects
As described above, this chapter starts with a description of the 
defects in geometry and morphology that may occur in printed 
layers.
4.2.1.1 Lateral extent
The most straightforward characteristic is a printed layer’s lateral 
extent. In evaporated layers, the desired pattern is defined by masks. 
With these, it is relatively simple to achieve high precision, since the 
movement of deposited molecules is strongly limited. Reproducing 
printed layers is more complex since they are not deposited as 
perfectly even coatings and because they can and will flow before 
drying. While the latter is needed to compensate for the former, it 
can also lead to a distortion of the layers and their edges. A change 
of a layer’s outline can have disastrous results, for example, if it 
causes the bottom and top contact of an organic light-emitting diode 
(OLED) to touch, shorting the device.
	
Apart from registration errors, only a few defects can be identified 
from a layer’s outline. One is the separation of very thin lines into 
droplets, which is caused by the fluid’s surface tension and is known 

135
as the Plateau–Rayleigh instability. If no coalescence occurs, printed 
dots can be seen directly. If it does occur, the dot’s arrangement 
may still cause a visible waviness of the edges. Holes and shrinkage 
caused by de-wetting, as well as spreading, which occurs mostly in 
thick layers of well-wetting materials, can also be detected.
4.2.1.2 Layer thickness
Another obvious structural characteristic of printed layers is their 
thickness. This can strongly influence a device’s performance, not 
only through the determination of the resistance and capacitance of 
its layers but also through more complex interactions. The thickness 
of layers in OPV cells, for instance, has to be finely tuned; too-thin 
layers cannot efficiently absorb light, while exceedingly thick ones 
hinder charge extraction. In vapor deposition the material is applied 
evenly over a large area with a controllable rate, leading to a precise 
and easily adjustable thickness. For printed layers, it is not possible 
to accurately predict a layer’s thickness. For example, for gravure 
printing it can be roughly estimated using the cell volume and the 
fluid’s solid content, but not all fluid is actually transferred, and 
especially in simple printing testers the solid content can be changed 
by an irreproducible drying before the transfer to the substrate.
	
Additionally, printed layers tend to be inhomogeneous. Several 
types of defects are common in printing. In a stack each layer can be 
affected by any of them, making an analysis of all layers very complex. 
Ideally, each layer should be analyzed separately by printing it on a 
smooth or already measured layer of the underlying material. The 
cross-section of a stack can also be examined, but for recording all 
irregularities many cross-sections are needed.
	
In spite of the complex physics behind the defect formation in 
printed layers, identifying them is mostly quite simple. If the spacing 
of deposited droplets is too large or the fluid dries too fast for them to 
coalesce and level, droplets or undulations that are neatly arranged 
in accordance with the printing form can be seen. For example, in 
inkjet-printed layers, the structure may resemble stacked pancakes. 
Another defect is viscous fingering. In this case the undulations form 
lines parallel to the printing direction (see Fig. 4.2). Raised edges of 
layers are due to the coffee stain effect, shown in Fig. 4.3, which is a 
result of contact line pinning and can be regulated using mixtures of 
solvents and by changing the drying conditions.

and trigger de-wetting (see Fig. 4.4)—this is called heterogeneous 
nucleation. Even small pinholes can cause severe problems by 
shorting a device. In very thin layers intermolecular forces can 
cause spinodal de-wetting. Here, the layer forms undirected and 
homogeneously distributed undulations, which can culminate in 
randomly arranged droplets.
	
A combination of defects is also possible. An example of this is 
shown in Fig. 4.5, where the Plateau–Rayleigh instability has caused 
a bulging of ridges created by viscous fingering in a gravure-printed 
layer. The pattern of the gravure cylinder can be seen on the right 
side due to a lack of printing fluid.
	
Particles in the ink can lead to inhomogeneities on a smaller 
scale, as well as, for example, surface structures that can arise during 
the curing of UV inks.
	
Regardless of whether the aim is to optimize a printing process 
or simply quality assurance, a repeatable characterization is 
paramount. There are standards that provide a highly useful toolbox 
for this. ISO 21920 describes how line profiles can be characterized, 
ISO  25178 does the same for areal surfaces. Here, we use the 
characterization of profiles as an example, but apart from the actual 
formulas used for each step and some of the wording, the process is 
mostly the same:
	
Both standards make heavy use of digital filters to isolate the 
features of interest. Low-pass filters removing structures with 
small wavelengths are called S-filters, while high-pass filters are 
called L-filters, as they remove structures with a large lateral scale. 
These can be combined to achieve bandpass filters. Note that 
the measurement device with its limited resolution itself already 
functions as a low-pass filter. These standards also allow the usage of 
different types of filters. All of these feature a parameter determining 
the filters’ wavelength dependency. Instead of the commonly known 
‘cut-off wavelength,’ the broader term ‘nesting index’ is used for this 
parameter. For instance, one of the filters is a morphological filter 
where the filtering is done by calculating the run of a disk rolling 
over the top side of the profile and then over the underside of the 
resulting curve. The diameter of this disk is a nesting index, but not 
the cut-off wavelength.

139
	
Following these standards, the different contributions to a 
sample’s profile are first separated by their wavelength and then 
analyzed separately. This separation is done in multiple steps. 
First, the measured values can be S-filtered with a small cut-off 
wavelength to remove noise. Next, the form—that is, the nominal 
shape of the characterized object—is removed. This is called the 
F-operation and results in the primary profile. If the printed layer is 
larger than the measured area and thus the nominal shape is a plane, 
the F-operation can be simply done by removing any tilt from the 
data. If the analyzed region contains the edge of the layer, this can 
often be removed by a polynomial fit or an L-filter.
	
The result is then generally separated into a part with larger 
wavelengths (waviness) and one with shorter ones (roughness). There 
is no single fixed nesting index for the transition from roughness to 
waviness; this has to be selected to suit the application. ISO 21920-
3 and ISO 25178-3 contain tables with default parameters for the 
nesting indices, evaluation length/area, and so on, which are chosen 
depending on the tolerances of a machined part. These tables can 
be used as guides for suitable combinations of parameters, but 
keep in mind that printed layers are not machined parts. The size 
of the layer may not allow the specified evaluation length for a given 
nesting index. It may also be more suitable to select a nesting index 
allowing to separate the undulations on a printed structure by their 
cause. To give a few examples, going from the largest lateral scale to 
the smallest: structures arising from contact angle pinning and the 
Marangoni effect tend to cover the whole printed layer with only a 
few waves. For viscous fingering, at least an approximate value for 
the dominant wavelength—which is often at or slightly below the 
mm range—can be calculated (see 3.2.3.3). The resolution of the 
printing form—or in the case of inkjet printing the drop spacing 
and swath width—are defined by the user. The roughness stemming 
from the particles in the ink is normally finer than that and in the 
range of the particle size.
	
In practice, it can be helpful to use more bandpass filters to 
separate the data into more categories, for example, if an undulation 
stemming from the initial distribution of ink droplets is visible 
but overlaid by one at larger lateral scales stemming from the ink 
flow during drying. The option to use a bank of bandpass filters is 
explicitly mentioned in ISO 25178.
Structural Characterization

140
Characterization Techniques for Printed Electronics
	
Having successfully passed all filters, a host of parameters can be 
determined for each profile. Following ISO 21920, these are written 
as Pxx, Wxx, and Rxx for the primary, waviness, and roughness profile, 
respectively, while in ISO 25178 Vxx is used for volumetric and Sxx for 
all other parameters.
	
The most common parameters are the average distance from the 
mean line Pa and the root mean square value Pa, here defined for a 
primary profile of length L with distance to the mean line DZ(x):

Please note that a conversion between these values for an 
arbitrary profile is not possible. Keep in mind, those values do not 
distinguish between many low and a few high peaks and thus more 
data are needed for a layer’s characterization. Shorts can appear if, 
for example, an insulating layer’s maximum pit depth Pvt equals its 
thickness or if the maximum peak height Ppt of a conductive layer 
exceeds the subsequent layer’s thickness. Furthermore, it is also 
possible to use values averaged over all or a few most extreme pits 
or peaks. Whether these are useful depends on how strongly a single 
hole in the corresponding layer affects functionality; in many cases, a 
single hole in a layer can destroy the device. Here, it can also be useful 
to view the profile’s height density curve, showing what percentage 
of the surface lies at which height. The material ratio curve shows 
how much of the profile lies above a certain height. This can be very 
useful to determine the area covered by a printed structure.
	
Additionally, skewness Psk and kurtosis Pku are also frequently 
used:

Psk shows how asymmetric the profile is; for Psk < 0 most of the 
profile lies above the average value, indicating holes. Smooth layers 

141
with a few peaks will have a positive skew. Pku is a measure of the 
profiles’ peakedness. A normal distribution will have Pku = 3; a 
sharper profile will have a higher value.
	
The standards mention many more different parameters, 
grouped into field parameters that are calculated using all points on 
the surface, and feature parameters, which are ‘defined from a subset 
of predefined topographic features’ of the same. Of the previously 
mentioned examples, for example, the kurtosis is a field parameter, 
while the mean pit depth is a feature parameter.
	
The challenging part is to determine which ones are relevant, 
how to weigh different parameters when assessing a sample’s 
overall quality, and their acceptable limits. This must be done for 
each layer in each device separately since the demands on these 
layers can differ strongly.
4.2.1.3 Morphology
The layer’s morphology, that is, the arrangement of molecules 
within them, is another characteristic that strongly influences the 
functionality of a device, mainly by changing the charge transport. Just 
like in evaporated samples the molecules can be arranged in partially 
crystalline domains, they can have a preferential orientation, and the 
layer can be amorphous, with an arbitrary molecular arrangement. 
In general, a higher molecular order leads to a narrower distribution 
of energy levels and thus higher conductivity, while disorder in the 
structure causes a broader distribution of energy levels. This can 
split the energy barriers at interfaces into smaller ones and thus ease 
charge carrier injection, but it can also lead to OLEDs only emitting 
heat, instead of light.
	
In evaporated layers, a preferential direction is mainly caused by 
interactions with the substrate. In printed layers printing and drying 
forces can strongly influence this; for instance, chain molecules can 
be aligned by the shear flow in the nip. In addition to this, a freshly 
printed, wet layer can (partially) dissolve the underlying layer(s), 
leading to intermixing at the interface. To reduce this, for example, 
orthogonal solvents or cross-linking—the polymerization of the 
underlying material—can be used. Among others, the solvents or 
precursors, air, reaction products, and interdiffused molecules from 
adjacent layers can also remain as impurities in the dried layers. 
They can strongly influence the device performance, for instance, by 
degradation or the formation of trap states and grain boundaries.

4.2.2 Structural Measurements
To detect the characteristics presented in this section, suitable 
measurements are needed. Due to the inhomogeneity of printed 
layers, some techniques that are common for evaporated samples, for 
example, ellipsometry, may be unsuitable for their characterization. 
In this section methods that can deal with undulating surfaces are 
listed, for a detailed explanation of their intricacies we refer to the 
Further Readings section. Almost all listed techniques measure 
a sample’s surface profile; therefore edges created by wiping or 
scratching are necessary to determine layer thicknesses. Otherwise, 
the irregularities of the substrate may distort the results.
4.2.2.1 Optical methods
Optical measurements are apt for areas ranging from microns to 
meters. They can also be nondestructive—for wavelengths in the 
visible range or longer and if no artificial edges are needed—and 
fast. Visual inspection with the human eye, possibly aided by a 
magnifier, can yield a first, qualitative assessment of certain defects. 
For example, registration errors can be obvious, as there can be 
pinholes in backlit layers. A quantitative analysis requires more 
equipment.
	
For measuring the outlines of a structure, for example, to 
determine a layer’s size, a “normal” microscope can suffice. These 
are divided into simple microscopes, with a single lens or array of 
lenses, and compound microscopes, containing at least two (objective 
and eyepiece). The advantages of a compound microscope are its 
relative simplicity, correct color rendering, and a rather low price. 
With suitable illumination and optical filters fluorescent molecules 
can be mapped; with polarizing filters birefringence can be found 
and used to detect crystallites.
	
Confocal microscopy allows 3D mapping. Here, one or two 
pinholes are used to illuminate only one dot at a defined height 
and/or to detect only light reflected from this dot. This leads to a 
very weak signal if the surface is out of focus at this spot. By moving 
the pinholes, an image of one plane can be taken. By varying the 
plane’s height and determining for each point the height at which 
it is brightest, the contours of a sample can be determined three-
dimensionally. Alternatively, for example, lasers or reflective 
microdisplays can be used instead of pinholes for illumination.

143
	
Some confocal microscopes are also fluorescence microscopes, 
where the illumination is designed to excite fluorescence, which 
is then detected. Materials that do not fluoresce at the selected 
wavelength remain dark. Fluorescent dyes can be used as markers 
for substances or structures that do not fluoresce on their own. 
Those dyes can often be added to an ink without significantly 
altering at least its printability. Also, organic semiconductors can 
show strong fluorescence themselves. With that, it can be possible to 
thoroughly analyze one layer in a stack. Note that the illumination is 
typically done with a laser so that there is a limited range of available 
wavelengths.
	
The lateral resolution can be higher than that of a standard 
microscope. The height of the structures that can be analyzed with 
this technique is limited by the objective’s working distance and 
can reach several centimeters. For high magnifications with a high 
numerical aperture (NA, a measure of the maximum acceptance 
angle for light entering the objective), the vertical resolution can 
reach 1 nm. Low-magnification lenses normally allow a resolution in 
the range of tens to hundreds of nanometers, providing only a rough 
overview of a printed sample.
	
A technique that is often used in similar ways as confocal 
fluorescence microscopy is light sheet fluorescence microscopy. 
Here, the illumination is done with a separate objective, creating 
a thin sheet of light. Typically, a horizontal plane in the sample is 
illuminated, while the detection objective views it from the top. A 
variant of this can be used to determine the thickness of (semi-)
transparent coatings (see ISO 2128). Here, the light sheet is directed 
at an angle (typically 45) toward the sample. A part of it is reflected 
at the surface of the coating, and another part is reflected at the 
interface to the underlying layer. The detection objective is oriented 
toward the reflected light, which forms two lines. If the refractive 
index of the coating is known, the distance of the lines can be used to 
calculate the layer thickness.
	
A sample’s profile can also be determined with interferometry. 
Here, the light is split into two beams, one to a reference mirror and 
one to the sample, and then combined again, leading to interference. 
Vertical scanning interferometry (VSI) uses low-coherence-length 
white light. The distance between the sample and the objective 
is varied and the brightness of each point is measured. The 
Structural Characterization

144
Characterization Techniques for Printed Electronics
interference is strongest for equal optical lengths of both beams and 
decreases fast with a rising difference, so the height of each point 
on the surface can be measured by maximizing the fringe contrast 
between constructive and destructive interference. For phase shift 
interferometry (PSI) monochromatic light is used. With three images 
between which the phase of the reference beam has been shifted by a 
known amount, the phase relation at each point can be determined. 
This can be used to determine the sample’s height profile.
	
Like confocal microscopy, the VSI mode can be used for very high 
structures. The lateral resolution is worse, but the vertical resolution 
is good—about 1 nm—and independent from the magnification, and 
the measurement speed is much higher. In the PSI mode, the vertical 
resolution is even better—steps below 0.1 nm can be detected—but 
the method is only unambiguous if the analyzed structure’s height 
does not exceed a quarter of the light’s wavelength. The analyzed 
material can influence the phase relation, causing errors for all 
interference-based techniques if the heights of multiple materials 
are compared.
	
The maximum slope of a reflective surface that can be measured 
is limited for all optical techniques and dependent on the NA. Often 
the limit is approximately 70° for confocal and 30° for interference 
microscopy, meaning that the former is best for rough samples. There 
are, however, ways to overcome these limits. Some microscopes 
based on VSI can analyze almost vertical flanks and are thus well-
suited for rough samples.
	
Another optical technique is X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
(XPS), where X-rays are used to eject electrons from the analyzed 
sample’s surface. The surface’s composition can then be determined 
by measuring the electron’s energy distribution. This can be 
combined with sputtering to abrade a smooth sample and thus 
measure a depth profile—unfortunately, a quite complex and error-
prone process.
	
Instead of light, one can use electrons, for example, in 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), where thin slices of a 
sample can be analyzed with atomic resolution. By measuring the 
energy of the detected electrons, it is possible to map certain atoms 
and molecules. With a rotating sample, this can be extended into 
tomography, yielding a detailed 3D image.

145
	
In scanning electron microscopy (SEM) an electron ray probes 
the surface of a sample. In this technique, there is a lot that can 
be analyzed. Backscattered electrons, for instance, stem from the 
probing primary beam and are simply reflected from the sample. The 
probability of an electron being backscattered rises with the mass of 
the probed atom so that different materials can be distinguished by 
the image’s brightness. Secondary electrons stem from the sample 
and are directly caused by the primary ray. Due to their low energy, 
they cannot pass thick layers. This means that only those emitted 
at the surface can be detected and therefore they can be used to 
analyze the sample’s topography. If an electron has been emitted 
from an inner shell and the vacancy is filled by an electron from an 
outer shell of the atom, the energy release can cause an emission of 
another electron from an outer shell—an auger electron. These can 
be used for the chemical analysis of the surface and, combined with 
sputtering, to create a 3D map of the sample’s composition, though 
this is not easy. In addition to electrons, X-rays, and luminescence, the 
current caused by the electron beam can be used for further analysis. 
In short, SEM is an extremely powerful method, yielding information 
about the sample’s topography, composition, and morphology. Of 
course, it is also very complex and expensive, especially as it is often 
coupled with several other analysis tools. Furthermore, insulating 
samples are problematic, since charges can accumulate on them and 
disturb the measurement.
4.2.2.2 Tactile methods
A fundamentally different approach to measure height profiles is to 
use tactile methods. They are independent of the analyzed layer’s 
optical properties and can achieve a higher resolution. Unfortunately, 
they also offer much lower measurement speeds, smaller scanning 
areas and may damage the sample. This can be checked by measuring 
twice in the same position, ideally scanning over a larger area in the 
second go.
	
The simplest tactile method, called stylus profilometer, is to drag 
a stylus connected to a cantilever over the surface of a sample and 
to measure its deflection. With this, a line profile can be acquired. By 
repeating this for an array of lines the 3D surface topography can be 
determined.
Structural Characterization

146
Characterization Techniques for Printed Electronics
	
The cantilever is often connected to a ferromagnetic rod that 
extends into the center of a coil. A change in the rod’s position causes 
an easily measurable change in the coil’s inductance, which can 
then be used to calculate the cantilever’s tilt. Other systems use, for 
example, capacitance or the deflection of a laser beam reflected from 
the cantilever. The vertical resolution of these systems is often in the 
range of several angstroms (Å). The lateral resolution is limited by 
the needle’s diameter and is normally between tens of nanometers 
and tens of micrometers. It is also limited by the measurement 
speed. The measured lines can be relatively long—mostly up to 
several centimeters—and most machines offer a maximal vertical 
measurement range of circa 1 mm. The force pressing the stylus 
against the substrate can be set, 0.1 mN being a typical value. A 
major problem is the measurement of soft samples; the stylus tip 
can engrave a trench into the sample and thus distort the results.
	
This can be avoided with atomic force microscopy (AFM). An 
atomic force microscope also contains a cantilever with a very fine 
tip. Piezo actuators can drive it in a grid over the sample, while its 
deflection is measured. An atomic force microscope normally has a 
higher resolution than a stylus profilometer but can only measure 
areas with side lengths in the order of a hundred microns and 
heights in the micron range. It can be used as a stylus profilometer 
that scans over areas. It is also possible to induce a vibration in the 
cantilever and measure the resonance frequency. This depends on 
external forces, which depend on the cantilever’s height over a given 
material, so measuring the height profile that leads to a constant 
resonance frequency during the surface scan leads to the sample’s 
profile. There are two modes of vibrational operation, a noncontact 
(NC) mode, where the tip is kept above the surface, and a tapping 
mode, where the tip touches the sample when swinging downward. 
The NC mode does not cause any degradation of the sample and tip 
and is perfect for soft samples. With a tip that is functionalized with 
a single molecule, it can reach an atomic resolution.
	
A stylus profilometer is useful to measure the waviness and 
height of a printed layer, AFM is better suited to measure the 
overlying roughness that has a very short wavelength.

147
4.3 Electrical Characterization
There is a large quantity of parameters that are related to the 
suitability of a material to a given electrical task and therefore to 
the functionality of a device. Here, we focus on the conductivity, 
capacitance, and inductance, leading to the impedance (which yields 
the resistance and phase shift for an electrical signal at a given 
frequency) of a printed stack, as well as a few parameters related to 
the quality of insulating layers.
4.3.1 Conductivity and Sheet resistance
A conductor’s most basic parameter is its conductivity:
	
s
m
=
◊
◊
n
q 	
(4.15)
with charge carrier density n, mobility m, and charge q. Note that 
there are two types of charge carriers in organic semiconductors—
electrons and holes—with separate mobilities and densities. Both 
can be dependent on the stack used in the device, the occurring 
voltages, the temperature, etc. If s is known, the resistance R of a 
conducting rod with a cross-sectional area A and length l can be 
calculated as
	
R
l
A
=
◊
s
	
(4.16)
	
With this, the thickness of a conductive layer needed for a desired 
resistance in any direction can be calculated. While, for example, the 
active layers of an OLED mostly only conduct a current vertically 
through the layer, contacting layers typically need to conduct along 
it. Thus, a different parameter is more convenient—sheet resistance:
	
R
t
s =

with thickness t. This makes the calculation of the resistance for a 
current through a conductor with length L and width W very simple:

Note that the unit of R and Rs is the same—W. To differentiate 
them, the unit of Rs is expressed as ohms per square: W/sq. or W/.
Electrical Characterization

Sheet resistance can be measured by a four-point probe. This 
typically consists of four equidistant contacts in a line. The outer 
contacts are connected to a current source, while the inner contacts 
are used to measure the induced voltage. Sheet resistance can be 
calculated by

with injected current I and measured voltage V. However, this is 
only valid for thin, homogeneous, and infinite sheets. For instance, 
the error for a square whose side length is 10 times the electrode 
distance is circa 10%. Correction factors can be calculated.
	
The contacts can also be placed on the edges of an arbitrarily 
shaped sheet with a uniform thickness and without holes. A current 
is induced between two neighboring contacts (I12), while the voltage 
between the other two (V34) is measured. This is repeated for a 
different pairing (I23 and V41). Rs can then be calculated by

This is known as the van der Pauw method and only works 
correctly for ohmic, infinitesimal contacts at the very edge. Real 
contacts cannot be infinitesimally small. So-called cloverleaf 
structures are often used to minimize the effect of this. It is also 
possible to use correction factors for non-ideal contacts as well as for 
thick layers. Repeatability can be checked by switching the contacts 
providing the current and measuring the voltage.
	
The advantage of both four-probe setups—using two contacts 
to run a current through a layer and using two separate contacts 
to measure the resulting voltage—is that the current flow through 
the contacts doing the measurement is close to zero. With this, the 
contact resistance only has a very limited impact on the measurement 
result.
	
In printed electronics contacting layers is always an issue. 
Organic (semi-) conductors are generally much softer than inorganic 
(semi-) conductors, and printed metallic traces tend to be thin, 
brittle, and have low scratch resistance. Due to that, the measuring 
tips can penetrate the layer. Bent or rounded tips, round spring 
contacts, or evaporated contacts can resolve this. For sensitive layers 
the measuring tips should not be held by hand; the vibrations of the 

149
hands can scratch the layer and significantly diminish the quality 
of the contact. In labs, probe arms that allow the positioning of the 
contact in x, y, z direction by micrometer screws are common.
4.3.2 Impedance
Even in the simple case of a printed resistor, the resistance alone 
is not enough for a full electrical characterization. To describe its 
behavior under an alternating current (AC) load, the impedance Z 
consisting of a real and imaginary part is needed. The real part 
corresponds to the resistance R, which leads to energy being 
dissipated, for example, as heat or light. The imaginary part stems 
from energy being temporarily stored in an electric or magnetic 
field. This leads to a phase shift between current and AC voltage. 
An electrical component that stores energy as a magnetic field is 
called an inductor, and one that uses electric fields is referred to as a 
capacitor. They can be assigned an inductance L and a capacitance C. 
These lead to the impedances:

The inductance of a structure is intrinsically linked to its shape, 
and it is therefore not possible to give a universal formula. However, 
formulas for common shapes can be easily found in literature. In 
general, the inductance is most relevant in elongated structures 
(antennas, coils) with low resistivity and therefore high currents, 
while capacitances are most relevant for large, thin layers with low 
conductivities.
	
Capacitance can also be used to determine the thicknesses 
of smooth layers with known area and (frequency-dependent) 
permittivity. While capacitance is much better suited for thickness 
Electrical Characterization

measurements than resistance—it is only weakly changed by charge 
injection—it can still be misleading, for example, if the layer is porous. 
The advantage of using capacitance to determine thicknesses is that 
it is nondestructive.

Analyzing a stack of layers or a complete device does come with 
additional complexities. For one, the direction of the current is 
not the same for all layers in all devices; it may flow horizontally 
or vertically, or even only along the surface of a layer. Also, the 
conductivity of a semiconducting layer depends on the surrounding 
materials and fields. It is best to analyze the mobility, for example, by 
using the Hall effect, and the charge carrier distribution of the layers 
in the finished device.
	
To analyze the complex processes in all the layers of a device, 
special test devices may be needed. To measure the flow of one type 
of charge carrier, for instance, it can be necessary to use blocking 
layers for the other type of charge carriers at both ends of a stack. 
A completely blocking contact is also needed for charge extraction 
in a linearly increasing voltage (CELIV). This is exactly what it 
sounds like: a linearly increasing voltage is applied to a device with 
one blocking contact and the resulting current is measured. This 
allows the analysis of charge carriers in equilibrium and yields, for 
example, their mobility. A modification of this is called photo-CELIV, 
where a photonic pulse is used to excite charge carriers just before 
the measurement is started. Another way to determine mobilities is 
to make OFETs from the material of interest and characterize them.
4.3.4 Work Function and Tunneling Current
By using conductive tips in an atomic force microscope, Kelvin probe 
measurements can be conducted, that is, the work function of the 
sample can be plotted. For this, an AC with the cantilever’s resonance 
frequency and a direct current (DC) signal are applied. When the 
DC potential equals the difference of the work functions of the tip 
and surface, there is no force acting with the resonance frequency. 
Thus the work function can be measured by keeping the cantilever’s 
vibration minimal. If a wedge is cut into a sample (with a focused ion 

151
beam, FIB), different layers within it can be analyzed by the Kelvin 
probe technique.
	
A nonvibrating conductive tip whose height can be regulated 
with precise piezo actuators can be used to map tunneling currents 
(scanning tunneling microscope, STM). One can also scan a tip with 
an aperture over the sample. This can be used for optical analysis 
in the near field (near-field scanning optical microscopy, NSOM, or 
SNOM), which can reach a molecular resolution.
4.3.5 Electrical Insulation
Besides (semi-)conductive layers, printed electronics often also 
require insulating ones, either to separate adjacent conductive 
layers, or as a protection against the environment and for the users. 
For instance, many designs require conductors to cross without 
creating a short circuit, which can be achieved by printing an 
insulator between them.
	
UV inks are often used for insulators; they hardly shrink upon 
curing and therefore lead to thick layers. Additionally, after curing 
they are mostly resistant to solvents so that they do not dissolve 
when another layer is printed on top of them. Testing the resulting 
insulating properties of those layers can be done in multiple ways:
	
Visual inspection can be used, but is not reliable, because hardly 
visible pinholes can lead to significant problems. It is, however, often 
needed to find the cause of insufficient insulation.
	
The most straightforward technique for determining the reliability 
of insulation is to print a number of test structures or devices and 
check these for short circuits. Depending on the application, this 
may have to be done at elevated voltages.
	
Other techniques are only applicable if the conductive layer is 
completely covered by the insulator in the tested area—these are 
not suitable for small patches of insulation where two conductive 
lines cross. For low test voltages (generally ≤ 90 V), the conductor 
can be connected to one lead of a voltage source, while a wet sponge 
is connected to the other. Typically, a small amount of, for example, 
dishwashing detergent and salt is added to the water to enhance 
wetting as well as conductivity, respectively. The sponge is then 
put on or wiped across the sample. The resulting leakage current 
serves to gauge the quality of the insulation. This special type of test 
Electrical Characterization

152
Characterization Techniques for Printed Electronics
is known from several applications not related to printing, see for 
example, ISO 8289-1, ISO 14654, and ISO 29601. For voltages in the 
kV range, a similar test is done using a dry electrode; often a metallic 
brush or conductive rubber (ISO 29601). The latter is less likely to 
damage the device under test.
	
While these tests were not designed with printed electronics 
in mind, they are applicable to insulating coatings on top of highly 
conductive materials. If the conductivity of the base layer is high 
enough, it is easy to print test samples that conform to the geometry 
expected in the standards. If the conductivity of the base layer 
is so low that it can decrease the measured current in the case of 
pinholes significantly, it is advisable to use a highly conductive layer 
underneath that.
	
Considering that inks can dewet at or around the edges of an 
underlying layer, it is also sensible to test the insulation on structured 
electrodes. Note that if only part of the area under the test device is 
actually covered by the conductive structure, the resulting leakage 
current for a given pinhole density is reduced.
	
In principle, insulating materials can also be tested by pressing 
them between two flat electrodes (as in IEC 60243-1, to determine 
the breakthrough voltage), but in printed electronics, it is necessary 
to deviate from the tests defined in the relevant standards in as much 
as the bottom electrode has to be printed or coated on the substrate. 
Otherwise, the test would include the substrate of the sample.
4.4 Longevity
An important characteristic of any device is its longevity. Regarding 
this, two factors are highly critical for printed and organic electronics: 
Their sensitivity against chemical contaminants and the fact that 
due to their flexibility, they naturally lend themselves to applications 
where they can be subjected to significant mechanical stress. The 
former point is to a large extent dependent on their encapsulation, 
which is covered in depth in Chapter 10. The mechanical demands 
can vary widely depending on the application, this section is 
therefore limited to a few pointers on often encountered tests to 
determine the mechanical robustness of a device.

153
	
When it comes to the interface between printed and classical 
electronics, for example, connectors and solder joints, we recommend 
reading up on printed circuit boards and flat flexible cables. Probably 
the most common test—and one also used in graphical printing—is 
that of the ink’s adhesion to the substrate. This is done with a cross-cut. 
In accordance with ISO 2409, multiple cuts with a spacing of 1–2 mm 
for layer thicknesses below 60 µm and larger spacings for thicker 
layers are made and then crossed by another set perpendicular to 
the first. Loose flecks of ink can be removed with a soft brush. In 
most cases, adhesive tape is used to pull off more of the ink. The 
adhesion is then rated by how much of the rectangular pieces of ink 
remain on the substrate. Without adhesive tape, the demands on the 
ink are low. With adhesive tape, the demands are much higher, but 
the results are less consistent. How much is removed depends on 
how the tape is put on, the wait time between this and the removal, 
the angle and speed of the removal, the tape itself, and so on. Care 
should be taken to keep the process as reproducible as possible, 
but even then it is very imprecise. More reproducible results can be 
gleaned via the force needed to pull off a rod that is glued to the ink 
(ISO 4624). Obviously, this only works if the cleaving occurs between 
substrate and ink, and not between ink and rod.
	
Another important property is the abrasion and scratch resistance 
of at least the upper layer of a sample. One measure of the latter is 
the pencil hardness (ISO 15184). A soft pencil which is sharpened to 
a defined point is installed into a tester that holds it at a 45° angle 
and presses it with a defined weight against the substrate. Then the 
device is pushed forward, driving the pencil over the surface. This 
is repeated with pencils of increasing hardness until the surface 
becomes damaged. The hardness before that is the pencil hardness of 
the surface. While this is a simple and comparatively cheap method, 
the results can vary, mainly because the hardness of pencils can 
vary significantly. As with adhesion testing with adhesive tape, one 
problem is that these are not designed to be used as measurement 
devices. Still, this measure can give a rough idea of the scratch 
resistance and is widely used.
	
Alternatively, testers can be used that allow (either manually or 
automatically) driving a steel or synthetic ruby tip with an adjustable 
pressure over the surface, and use pressure needed for scratching it 
Longevity

154
Characterization Techniques for Printed Electronics
as a measure of the scratch resistance (ISO 1518-1). It is also possible 
to use a continuously increasing pressure (ISO 1518-2) or a loop- or 
ring-shaped stylus (ISO 12137). It may not be immediately obvious 
how to transfer the critical pressure to scratch resistance, but this is 
a quite reproducible method.
	
Measuring the load-displacement path of a hard tip being pressed 
into the sample can also be used to assess the hardness of a printed 
layer if it is done on a sufficiently small scale (Nanoindentation, 
ISO 14577-4).
	
There are also several established methods to determine 
abrasion resistance, mainly consisting of driving a pad or wheels 
loaded with a specific weight and equipped with a specific surface a 
specific number of times over the sample (e.g., ISO 7784, ISO 9211-4, 
ASTM D6279). Again, the appropriate testing protocol depends on 
the application.
	
The last property we wish to cover is one that allows printed 
and organic electronics to open up entirely new possibilities: Their 
flexibility. This, too, has its limits, which need to be determined. The 
most common types of mechanical stress are stretching, bending, or 
creasing, as well as pressure and pull on the surface. These can lead 
to fatigue or even immediate destruction of a device.
	
To the best of our knowledge, there is no standard procedure 
covering these for printed electronics, but some tests designed for 
other materials can at least serve as an inspiration. For instance, 
fatigue testing of vulcanized rubber is done for tensile deformations 
(ISO 6943) and similar jigs can be used to do just that for printed 
electronics. Leather is bent once around mandrels of decreasing 
size until cracks appear (ISO 3378), a similar test is done for paints 
and varnishes on plastic and metal substrates (ISO 1519), a reverse 
bend test for a set number of cycles is used on wires (ISO 7801) and 
rigid substrates can also be subjected to a continuously alternating 
mechanical load to determine their fatigue properties (ISO 13003). 
A harsher version with minimal bending radius is the folding 
endurance test used for the paper (ISO 5626), where the sample is 
folded back and forth until it breaks.
	
Keep in mind that the above-mentioned tests are generally 
designed for samples without functional layers, so certain 

155
adaptations may be needed. For instance, a clamp may damage the 
printed structure even before any actual testing has started.
	
The results for this type of test will always depend on the 
whole stack. The ad- and cohesion play a significant role, as well 
as the thickness and mechanical properties of the substrate and 
surrounding layers.

For reproducible printing results the properties of the printing fluid 
and substrate have to be controlled. Analyzing these results and 
understanding the causes of defects is necessary for optimization.
	
Important parameters are viscosity and surface tension. Both 
depend on different parameters—for instance, temperature and 
time. This has to be taken into account for any calculations and any 
measurement routine.
	
Structural characteristics can be grouped into those of outline, 
thickness, and morphology. Most problematic for printed layers are 
those of the outline and thickness, where many more defects can 
occur than in evaporated layers.
	
Many different techniques can be used for structural 
characterization, all of which are prone to different kinds of errors. It 
is therefore vital to compare the results of several techniques based 
on different principles.
	
A device’s look is not the most important thing; its functionality 
is. This can of course be easily tested, but to find the causes of 
problems it is necessary to analyze each layer separately. Important 
parameters are, for example, conductivity and capacitance.

Tasks and Solutions
Task 1: Fluid and substrate characterization
	 (a)	 What is dynamic and kinematic viscosity?
	
	 Dynamic viscosity is given by shear stress divided by shear 

157
rate. Dividing this term by the fluid’s density yields kinematic 
viscosity.
	 (b)	 Define a Newtonian fluid.
	
	 In a Newtonian fluid, the shear rate increases linearly with the 
shear stress. This means that the viscosity does not depend on 
the shear stress.

waviness has a much larger wavelength: a few nanometers vs. 
tens of microns and more.
	 (d)	 What is Pa? What is Prms? Can you convert one value into the 
other? If so, how?
	
	 Both are parameters describing a surface’s unevenness. Pa is 
the integral of the linear distance to the mean line, while Prms 
is the integral of the quadratic distance. There is no conversion 
between both parameters.

stack: metallic electrode/insulating polymer/metallic electrode.
	 (a)	 What important single-layer characteristics should you

peak heights, should be measured.
	
	 Insulating polymer: lateral extent (spreading or shrinkage), 
homogeneity and the leakage current should be measured.
	 (b)	 How can you do that?
	
	 Sheet resistivity can be measured using the van der Pauw 
method.

159
	
	 Roughness can be measured using AFM.
	
	 The leakage current could be either determined by simply

Coating was only briefly mentioned in this chapter’s introduction. 
Two recommendable books on this have been written by Gutoff and 
Cohen [1, 2] and a third one by Tracton [3].
	
More information on viscosity and its measurement can be found 
in the works of Schramm [4], Irgens [5], and Macosko [6], as well 
as in the standard ISO 3219. Special consideration on instabilities 
occurring in rheometers is given by Larson [7].
	
All the important models for the calculation of contact angles are 
described by Żenkiewicz [8] and Good [9], including that of Neumann 
(uses an equation of state and only one type of interaction), Wu 
(uses a harmonic Wsf) as well as Oss and Good (based on nonpolar 
and acid-base interactions). Bonn et al. [10] and de Gennes [11] 
present a host of wetting phenomena. A broader description of 
interfaces is given by Butt [12]. Arashiro and Demarquette [13] give 
examples of how pendant drops can be analyzed, while Stalder et 
al. [14] do the same with sessile drops. Fainerman and Miller [15] 
give a short description of the maximum bubble pressure method. 
A rough overview of many types of surface tension measurements 
is also given in the freely available glossary offered by Krüss, a 
manufacturer of measurement devices [16].

coffee stain effect has been written by Deegan et al. [19], Berteloot 
et al. [20], and Majumder et al. [21]. Bornemann et al. [22] give 
approximate formulas for the evolution of viscous fingering and 
spinodal de-wetting, as well as for the leveling time of a thin layer. A 
more complete description of different types of de-wetting has been 
given by Bäumchen and Jacobs [23] as well as Craster and Matar 
[24], the latter also covering a plethora of other instabilities of thin 
films.
	
It is easier to find literature on characterization techniques than 
on the characteristics themselves. Good resources for the basics of 
optical microscopy are the homepages of microscope manufacturers 
(e.g., Zeiss, Nikon, Olympus, and Leica), which also offer interactive 
tutorials, and Murphy and Davidson [25]. A thorough description 
of interferometry is given by Malacara [26], and papers written by 
Dubois [27], Yatsenko [28], and McWaid [29] may help deal with 
the problem of material-dependent phase shift. Tactile methods 
are covered by Morita [30] and Kaupp [31]. Leng [32] and Yao and 
Wang [33] give a less thorough overview of all kinds of microscopy, 
while Heath [34] has written a dictionary with extremely brief 
explanations of thousands of relevant terms.
	
Schroder [35] goes beyond microscopy, covering all kinds of 
techniques that are needed for the complete characterization of 
semiconductors. More about the electrical properties of organic 
electronics can be found in the works of Brütting and Adachi [36], 
Schwoerer and Wolf [37], and Baranovski [38]. The four-point probe 
and its pertaining correction factors have been described by the 
Haldor Topsoe Semiconductor Division [39] and Swartzendruber 
[40]. The van der Pauw method has been described by van der Pauw 
himself [41] (introduction), Ramadan [42] (correction of errors 
caused by the shape of the sample), Chwang [43] (correction of 
errors caused by contacts), and Weiss [44]. Lvovich [45] has written 
a useful book on impedance spectroscopy, covering many aspects 
of it, while Nowy’s paper [46] gives a concise example of how it 
can be used for organic electronics. For information on the CELIV 
technique, we refer to Juška [47] and Lorrmann [48].
	
The techniques presented for longevity and insulation are rather 
narrow in their scope so the standards referenced in these sections 
cover the salient points. An overview of techniques to determine the 
hardness and wear resistance is also given in ISO/TR 21555.

5.1 Introduction
This chapter discusses various aspects of the characterization and 
performance of organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). It covers 
both individual transistors and simple circuits such as logic gates 
and ring oscillators. At the transistor level, the emphasis is on how 
to (i) perform basic parameter extraction and quantify individual 
transistor performance, (ii) gain insight into the ability of the 
device to operate over long periods by measuring its operational 
stability, (iii) identify reliability issues which cause device failure, 
and (iv) identify and circumvent sources of variability in transistor 
parameters. At the circuit level, the focus is on how the non-ideal 
behavior of individual transistors degrades circuit operation.
	
This chapter is organized in the following way. A brief history of 
the thin-film transistor (TFT) is presented in Section 5.2 together 
with a description of the typical TFT architectures and the basic 
operation mechanism. The differences between a silicon-based 
metal-oxide-semiconductor 
field-effect 
transistor 
(MOSFET) 
and an organic TFT device are discussed in Section 5.3. The ideal 
TFT electrical characteristics are derived. Due to the presence of 
impurities, TFTs show some non-ideal characteristics. These are 
discussed in Section 5.4. Emphasis is given to the physical meaning 
of the extracted parameters. Recipes to identify non-ideal effects 
caused by extrinsic factors such as impurities, and parasitic and 
imperfect metal contacts are also presented and discussed. The 
operational stability deserves special attention. Different types 
of instabilities are briefly explained. It shows how to quantify 
and benchmark operational stability. Section 5.4 also addresses 
variability characterization and draws attention to the importance 
of a design layout that minimizes variability. Electrical active 
impurities or traps determine performance and stability. Section 5.5 
outlines the effects of traps on the electrical properties and describes 
techniques to study traps using the transistor as a tool. These include 
the temperature dependence of the field-effect mobility, thermal de-
trapping experiments, and small-signal impedance spectroscopy. 
Simple circuit types such as the inverter and the ring oscillator 
are presented in Section 5.6. OTFT applications in bioelectronics 
are briefly discussed in Section 5.7. The major conclusions of this 
chapter are outlined in Section 5.8.

5.2 Field-Effect Transistors
A TFT is a device that uses an electric field to modulate the 
conduction of a channel located at the interface between a dielectric 
and a semiconductor. Therefore, it is a field-effect transistor (FET) 
like the well-known MOSFET, which is the basic building block of 
modern integrated circuits. The development histories of TFTs 
and MOSFETs are parallel in time. The TFT concept was patented 
in 1925 by Julius Edger Lilienfeld and in 1934 by Osker Heil but at 
the time no practical demonstration emerged. In the 1960s, several 
device structures and semiconductor materials, like Te, CdSe, Ge, 
and InSb, were explored to fabricate TFTs. However, the competition 
from the MOSFET based on silicon technology forced the TFT to 
enter a long period of hibernation. In the early 1970s, the need for 
large-area applications in flat panel displays motivated the search 
for alternatives to crystalline silicon and the TFT found its niche 
application. In 1979, a hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) 
became a forerunner as a semiconductor to fabricate TFTs. Since 
the mid-1980s, silicon-based TFTs have successfully dominated 
the large-area liquid crystal displays (LCD) technology and become 
the most important devices for active-matrix liquid crystal and 
organic light-emitting diode applications. In the meantime, TFTs 
based on organic semiconductor channel layers were introduced in 
the 1990s with charge carrier mobility equivalent to that of a-Si:H. 
Nowadays, OTFTs are candidates for incorporation onto flexible 
substrates. A representative and particularly important example are 
full-color, video, and flexible OLED displays. Small OLED displays on 
conventional glass substrates for mobile phone and PDA applications 
are rapidly growing and are displacing LCD screens in the small 
display sector. OFET technology could be an ideal backplane for 
this application because of the material’s compatibility between 
OLEDs and OFETs and their excellent mechanical properties. The 
application niche for OFETs is not entirely defined. Smart cards, 
disposable electronics, and electronic skins are also currently under 
intense research.

5.2.1 The Basic Operation of a Thin-Film Transistor
A TFT is formed by placing thin films of the dielectric layer, an 
active semiconductor layer, and metallic contacts onto a supporting 
substrate. Figure 5.1 shows a cross-sectional schematic drawing of a 
MOSFET and a TFT. As shown, the substrate of a TFT is an insulating 
material, whereas the substrate of a MOSFET is a semiconductor 
material (p-type) of different doping than the source and drain 
(n-type). Source and drain contacts to the semiconducting channel 
material are injecting contacts to the channel in a TFT structure and 
are a pn junction in a MOSFET.
Figure 5.1 Cross-sectional schematic drawing of a MOSFET (a), and a TFT (b).
	
TFTs and MOSFETs operate similarly in that the current from the 
source to the drain terminal is modulated by the applied gate electric 
field. This current modulation can be explained by considering the 
metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) part of the TFT as a capacitor. 
A voltage applied between the metal and semiconductor creates a 
charge buildup in the semiconductor and metal gate.
	
The energy band diagram of an ideal MIS capacitor is shown in 
Fig. 5.2 (for a p-type semiconductor). The capacitor is considered 
ideal when the bands are flat at zero applied voltage, as indicated by 
Eq. (5.1).

Here, ϕm is the metal work function, Eg the semiconductor 
bandgap, q the absolute electron charge, and ϕb the potential 
difference between the Fermi level and the intrinsic Fermi level Ei 
(which is located very close to midgap) (in the non-ideal case, a small 
band curvature exists at the insulator-semiconductor interface, and 

169
Field-Effect Transistors
a small potential Vfb, the so-called flat-band voltage, must be applied 
to the metal to get the flat-band conditions.)
Figure 5.2 Band diagram of an ideal metal-insulator-semiconductor structure 
at equilibrium. fm and χ are the metal and the semiconductor work function, 
respectively. EC and EV are the semiconductor bands, Eg the semiconductor band 
gap, and Ej and Ef are the Fermi levels of the intrinsic and doped semiconductors.
	
When the MIS capacitor is biased with positive or negative 
voltages, three different situations may occur at the insulator-
semiconductor interface. For a negative voltage (Fig. 5.3a), the bands 
bend upward, and the top of the valence band moves closer to the 
Fermi level, causing an accumulation of holes near the insulator-
semiconductor interface. The interface is thus more conductive than 
the bulk of the semiconductor. When a small to moderate positive 
voltage is applied to the gate electrode, the majority of carriers 
(holes) are repelled from the insulator/semiconductor interface so 
that a depletion layer is formed (Fig. 5.3b). When a larger positive 
voltage is applied to the metal (Fig. 5.3c), the bands bend even more 
downward, and the intrinsic level eventually crosses the Fermi level. 
At this point, the density of electrons exceeds that of the holes, and 
one enters the inversion regime. The inversion mode of operation is 
usually not observed in OFETs.
	
Depending on the gate voltage required to form an accumulation 
layer, a TFT can be classified as either an enhancement-mode or a 
depletion-mode device.

170
Organic Field-Effect Transistors
Figure 5.3 Band diagram of an ideal MIS structure under an applied bias. 
Accumulation (a), depletion (b), and inversion (c) regimes.
	
In the enhancement-mode operation of a p-channel TFT, a 
negative voltage must be applied to the gate electrode to create 
an accumulation layer at the insulator-semiconductor interface. In 
contrast, for depletion-mode operation, the accumulation layer is 
already present at zero gate voltage. Thus, for a p-channel TFT, a 
positive gate voltage must be applied to deplete the accumulation 
channel and turn the device off. As a result, an enhancement-mode 
device is “normally off” while a depletion-mode TFT is “normally 
on.”
	
In an ideal TFT model, the TFT would be an accumulation-mode 
device due to the presence of zero-bias carriers (bulk carriers) that 
can conduct current. However, the presence of doping or traps may 
result in depletion-mode operation. This highlights the differences 
between TFTs and MOSFETs. TFTs operate in accumulation mode 
while MOSFETs operate in inversion mode.
5.2.2 OTFT Architectures
OTFTs can be fabricated on a variety of rigid or flexible substrates. 
Additionally, TFTs can be made from a wide range of semiconductor 
and dielectric materials.
	
OTFT can be configured into four basic structures based on 
the position of the electrodes as shown in Fig. 5.4. The patterned 
source/drain electrodes can be deposited prior to the organic 
semiconductor (OSC) deposition or after it. The former case is a 

171
Field-Effect Transistors
“coplanar” configuration (popularly called bottom contact) and the 
latter is a “staggered” configuration (also known as top contact). Both 
the staggered and coplanar configurations are further categorized 
as bottom-gate and top-gate structures. Different TFT structures 
can exhibit quite dissimilar device characteristics using the same 
materials. In a coplanar configuration, the source and drain contacts 
and the insulator layer are on the same part of the channel whereas, 
in a staggered configuration, the source and drain contacts and the 
insulator layer are on the opposite part of the channel.
Figure 5.4 Schematic cross-section of common OTFT structures: (a) bottom 
gate and bottom contact (a); bottom-gate and top contact (b); top-gate and 
bottom contact (c), and top-gate and top contact (d).
	
The choice of TFT structure can be crucial in determining the 
carrier injection properties of the source-channel interface. In a 
coplanar structure, the metal-semiconductor interface is somehow 
different from a classical metal/semiconductor interface as often 
discussed and presented in semiconductor physics textbooks. This 
is because the interface is a metal/accumulation channel interface. 
There is a high density of free carriers on both sides of the interface 
and band bending is not expected to occur. As a result, coplanar 
devices should in principle be more tolerant to contact resistance 
effects occurring at drain and source electrodes. However, the 

172
Organic Field-Effect Transistors
presence of traps may cause contact effects and degrade the 
injection properties of these interfaces. The choice of TFT structure 
will depend largely on the fabrication technology used, such as 
evaporation or printing.
5.3 The Ideal Thin-Film Transistor
Figure 5.5 illustrates a TFT. The device is composed of a terminal 
known as the gate, an insulating layer with a thickness of dox 
(which gives a capacitance density of Cox = eox/dox, where eox is the 
permittivity of the insulating material), and a semiconducting layer 
which acts as the channel for charged carriers, referred to as the 
channel.
	
The fundamental principle of the FET is the modulation of charge 
density in the channel layer, which alters its conductivity when a gate 
voltage is applied. The important measurable electrical quantities 
are the drain-source current (Ids), drain-source voltage (Vds), and 
gate-source voltage (Vgs). In an ideal device, leakage currents, 
namely as drain-gate or gate-source are assumed to be negligible.
Figure 5.5 Schematic diagram of an organic TFT showing the nomenclature 
used in this chapter.
	
It is common to use the MOSFET theory to describe the behavior 
of organic-based transistors and in general thin-film transistors. 
However, as will be discussed later, this approach may not be 
completely accurate.
	
In a TFT all induced charge is necessarily close to the insulator 
and the charge-voltage relation can be written as is as follows:
	
r x
V x
V
C
( ) =
( )-
ÈÎ
˘˚

ox 	
(5.2)

173
with r and V the local charge per area and voltage in the channel, 
respectively. However, it is important to note that in a TFT, this 
charge might be either mobile or immobile.
	
In MOSFET, the total amount of charge induced by the gate 
voltage is free. Therefore, the charge depends linearly on the gate 
voltage. However, in TFTs, this assumption might not be true. In 
silicon, the acceptors and donors introduce shallow levels that are 
all ionized. In contrast, in organic semiconductors, the acceptor 
and donor states are deep and abundant. As a result, even at room 
temperature, not all levels are ionized, and temperature and bias can 
change the degree of occupancy of the trap state.
	
The current flowing through a TFT can be described by the 
equation for currents in a MOSFET, despite the differences in the 
device’s structure. In a TFT, the channel thickness remains constant, 
but the density of charges within the channel varies from the source 
to the drain. To calculate the currents, it is crucial to understand that 
the current at any point x in the channel is equal to the local induced 
charge [Cox(Vg – VT) – V(x)]) multiplied by the carrier mobility (m), 
the electric field experienced by the charges (dV(x)/dx), and the 
channel width (W). This can be represented mathematically by the 
differential equation:

The threshold voltage (VT) in a TFT is a crucial parameter that 
differs from that in a MOSFET. In TFTs, VT is not determined by the 
doping concentration, but by the presence of impurities (traps) in 
the conduction channel. To calculate the current flowing through the 
TFT, we can utilize the boundary conditions of V(0) = 0, V(L) = Vds, 
and Ix(x) = Ids for all x. With these conditions, we can find the solution 
for the current flow through the device.

The Ideal Thin-Film Transistor

The above equation for TFTs is identical to that of MOSFETs, with 
the requirement of low resistance Ohmic contacts. However, the 
equation is only valid up to a point where Vds = Vgs – VT. Beyond this 
point, the saturation regime starts. In this condition, the charge and 
voltage distribution across the device is independent of the drain-
source voltage, resulting in a constant current.

As the voltage increases, the remaining voltage drop (Vgs – VT) 
occurs in a region that is not of constant width but instead decreases 
to L – l. This means that the saturation current is not constant but 
continues to increase as the drain voltage increases.
	
When the voltage is low, the quadratic term in Vds becomes 
very small in Eq. 5.5 and this is referred to as the linear region (see 
Fig. 5.6).

The mobility of a FET (mFET) is defined by taking the derivative 
of a transfer curve (Ids – Vg). By utilizing Eq. (5.5) for small Vds, it is

It is important to note that for an organic TFT, the mobility can 
vary depending on factors such as temperature and applied bias 
and can deviate significantly from mobilities measured by other 
techniques. For example, carrier mobilities estimated using the Hall 
effect or time-of-flight methods may reveal the charge mobility in 
the bulk material which can be different from the charge carrier 
mobility estimated from the transfer curve of a transistor.
5.3.1 Threshold Voltage of Ideal TFTs
The reason why the MOSFET model is used to describe organic 
TFTs is because of the similarity of the basic transistor equations 
[Eq. (5.5) and Eq. (5.6)], and the shapes of the I–V curves of Fig. 5.6, 
with those obtained for MOSFETs. Although the curves are alike, the 
extraction of quantitative information from the device parameter 
may not be entirely correct. The most important difference between 
MOSFETs and organic TFTs is related to the threshold voltage. In an 
ideal (trap-free) organic TFT working in accumulation mode, the 
threshold voltage is expected to be zero because all the external 
applied gate voltage should induce free carriers in the channel. 
However, it is true that organic TFTs often have a non-zero threshold 
voltage because they have charged traps. However, the threshold 
voltage in an organic TFT is not an intrinsic device parameter.
5.4 Non-ideal Characteristics
This section provides an overview of the non-ideal characteristics 
commonly observed in OTFTs. Three behaviors are often reported: 
(i) non-ohmic current–voltage (I–V) characteristics near the 
origin, (ii) deviations from linear or quadratic behavior of the TFT 
transfer curves, and (iii) large current when Vgs = 0 V (off-current). 
Figure 5.7 shows a typical example of a non-linear transfer curve 
measured in the linear region. This behavior hinders the proper 
extraction of TFT parameters, as it is difficult to accurately define 
a unique threshold voltage or field-effect mobility from the transfer 
curve. The estimated slope and the extrapolation to the origin 
depend on the region of the transfer curve used.
Non-ideal Characteristics

176
Organic Field-Effect Transistors
	
This behavior is caused by the presence of localized charges, 
resulting in a transfer curve that usually follows a power law. It is 
possible to quantify the deviation from the ideal behavior using a 
gamma (g ) parameter, which can be related to the density of localized 
states. The extraction of this parameter will be discussed later in this 
chapter.
Figure 5.7 Experimental transfer curve for an organic TFT based showing non-
linear voltage dependence. The dashed lines are examples to illustrate that 
depending on the bias point chosen, multiple slopes can be obtained.
	
The metal-semiconductor contacts in OTFTs may also exhibit 
non-Ohmic behavior, leading to non-linear output characteristics 
when the drain–source voltage (Vds) is low. This effect is more 
pronounced for high gate voltages, where the TFT channel requires 
a high current, but the metal contact cannot supply it. Figure 5.8a 
shows an example of this behavior, where the output curves no 
longer separate from each other, resulting in a decrease in slope 
in the corresponding transfer curves. Figure 5.8b shows a more 
complex non-linear behavior. These non-linear behaviors are often 
caused by the presence of impurities or traps, the quantification of 
which is not straightforward and will be discussed later.
	
In organic TFTs, a common problem is the presence of a large off-
current, which is the current flowing through the device when the 
gate-source voltage (Vgs) is zero. This large off-current can obscure 
the observation of a well-defined saturation region and decrease the 

177
on/off ratio of the device. The off-current can be caused by several 
factors, such as a parasitic current leakage path through the bulk 
region or a built-in channel in the semiconductor layer. To diagnose 
the origin of the off-current, a positive gate bias should be applied 
and the response of the off-current should be observed. If the 
current decreases when a positive bias is applied, it is caused by a 
built-in channel (accumulation layer). On the other hand, a parasitic 
leakage path is usually not affected by the gate bias. To minimize 
the off-current, it is recommended to use undoped semiconductor 
layers.
Figure 5.8 Two examples of non-ideal I–V characteristics. Both TFT 
characteristics are distorted by the presence of non-ohmic carrier injection and 
a high off-current.
	
Figure 5.9 illustrates another type of non-linearity commonly 
observed in OTFTs. To simulate this behavior, an equivalent circuit 
with a diode element and two TFTs in parallel must be considered 
(as shown in the inset of Fig. 5.9). This behavior is believed to be 
caused by changes in the semiconductor morphology, structure, 
doping, and trap density that occur near the metal contacts. These 
alterations result in a complex injection and transport of charges 
through these interfacial regions.
	
Table 5.1 summarizes the main non-ideal characteristics 
observed in organic-based TFTs. The table also outlines the electrical 
methods used to diagnose the origin of these non-ideal properties 
and suggests methods to minimize the non-ideal properties.

Off–current (IOFF)
Possible causes:
– the semiconductor is doped.
– there is a parallel conducting path through the 
semiconductor bulk layer. If this is the case, you 
can minimize the off-current by decreasing the 
thickness of the semiconductor layer.
– There is conducting path through the surface. 
Often helps carry the measurements under 
vacuum conditions to eliminate adsorbed water 
and oxygen on the surface of the semiconductor.
By applying a reverse gate voltage, we can 
diagnose the origin of the off-current. Usually, two 
behaviors are observed:
– If the TFT accumulation channel shuts down, it 
confirms that the semiconductor is doped.
– If the current remains unchanged, means that 
either the semiconductor layer is too thick or 
there is a leakage path (usually on the TFT 
surface).

5.4.1 Parameter Extraction
Determining the threshold voltage in OTFTs can be challenging. The 
threshold voltage is typically found by fitting a straight line to the 
transfer curve in the linear region and extrapolating it to zero current. 
However, as shown in Fig. 5.7, the slope of the transfer curve [and 
therefore the mobility calculated using Eq. (5.7)] and the threshold 
voltage obtained by extrapolation to Ids = 0, can vary depending on 
the bias point chosen. This means that both the mobility and the 
threshold voltage can depend on the bias point considered, making 
it difficult to extract accurate device parameters. Transfer curves can 
be linearized assuming that the Ids current in the linear region varies 
according to the:

5.4.2 Operational Stability
One of the most important stability issues in organic transistors is 
the shift in the threshold voltage upon applying a prolonged bias 
to the gate. This instability is often referred to as gate-bias stress. 
The applied negative gate potential for a p-type semiconductor 
causes a build-up of mobile charges at the semiconductor/insulator 
interface, which is then trapped. Therefore, to reach an identical 
channel current subsequently, a higher gate voltage must be used. 
Devices suffering from gate-bias stress effects exhibit threshold 
voltage shifts ∆VT, current-voltage characteristics with hysteresis, 
and a slow and continuous decrease in the device current. These 
effects are noticeable when a gate bias is applied over a prolonged 
time. Therefore, stress effects have a great impact on the application 
of organic-based electronics.
	
It is known that the bias-stress effect is reversible, and that the 
recovery process can be enhanced by a positive gate bias or by light. 
Several studies have also shown that the traps are related to the 
presence of water. To achieve stable TFTs, it is important to prevent 
the incorporation of water using hydrophobic capping layers or 
Non-ideal Characteristics

by designing new materials that are less susceptible to water 
incorporation.
	
The operational stability of the TFT can be quantified by 
measuring the time evolution of the threshold voltage shift ∆VT (t) 
during the application of a constant gate voltage. This dependence is 
described by a stretched exponential function characterized by the 
parameters t and β according to

where t is the relaxation time, the dispersion parameter β equals 
T/T0, and VT0 is the threshold voltage at the start of the experiment.
The higher the value of t, the higher the transistor’s operational 
stability, therefore t is used as a figure of merit to compare devices 
fabricated using different technologies and different materials.
	
An example of the use of the stretched exponential formalism 
to quantify the OTFT stability is illustrated in Fig. 5.11. The time 
dependence of the threshold voltage shift is compared for two 
transistors, one with the dielectric layer (SiO2) passivated and the 
other using a non-passivated dielectric layer.

exponential formalism. The gate-bias stress stability increases with t.

The threshold voltage stability improves one order of magnitude 
with respect to the non-passivated device. The relaxation time, t 
increases from 2 × 103 s to 2 × 104 s.
	
State-of-the-art TFTs to be used in commercial applications must 
have a t in the order of 106–107 s or higher.
5.4.3 Variability
Process variations during transistor fabrication led to variability 
in the resulting transistor parameters. Here we discuss the main 
sources of variability and the approaches that are generally employed 
for analyzing and interpreting transistor variability.
	
Variations between OTFTs had been a well-known problem more 
acute than in silicon-based technologies by an inherently higher 
parameter spread. Reasons for that include:
 
∑ irregular morphology of the semiconductor,
 
∑ difficulty in controlling the precise dimensions of OTFTs,
 
∑ mobile trapped charges in the dielectric,
 
∑ uneven material deposition,
 
∑ the roughness of the semiconductor-gate dielectric interface, 
which leads to charge carrier mobility variations between the 
different transistors.
	
Artifacts, such as bad transistor layout and incorrect data 
analysis, may also introduce variability.
	
Interestingly, not all parameters affect the transistor current in 
the same way. According to Eq. (5.6), variations in the threshold 
voltage VT affect the saturation current of the transistor quadratically, 
while variations in m, W, L, and dOX, influence the saturation current 
only linearly.
	
The large transistor variability poses a serious challenge to 
the cost-effective utilization of organic analog circuits. It prohibits 
the use of OFETs in configurations that rely on precisely matched 
currents, for instance, current-steering D/A converters. Thus, the 
variability issues are of paramount importance.
	
Semiconductor foundries run analyses on the variability of 
attributes of transistors (length, width, dielectric thickness, etc.). 
These sets of files are generally referred to as “model files” in the 
electronic design–assisted (EDA) tools for the simulation of transistor

and circuit designs. Designers using this approach run simulations 
to analyze how the outputs of the circuit will behave according to 
the measured variability of the transistors for that process. These 
simulations allow estimating the final circuit yield, starting from a 
basic inverter, and stepping up toward the full integrated circuit. 
Moreover, simulations considering the area-dependent variability 
increase the predicted yield, as expected.
5.4.3.1 Experimental procedures and methodologies to study 
variability
Variability characterization requires many measurements on a 
variety of devices, layout styles, and environments. The methodology 
used in CMOS technologies to account for local parameter variations 
and transistor mismatch can be transposed to organic TFT 
technologies. For each TFT, an electrical parameter P is characterized 
by a continuous distribution with space and specific noise power 
intensity AP independent of the device surface area. Therefore, in 
the local approach, the variance s of parameter P for a device with 
surface W ¥ L takes the form

5.4.3.2 Limitations of test structures
Parasitic effects caused by the off-current or parasitic fringe current 
outside the channel region can introduce errors in parameter 
extraction and lead to an incorrect variability analysis. Next, a 
specific example is discussed.
	
Figure 5.12a shows a set of transfer curves recorded for a 
number of small-area OTFTs produced in identical conditions and 
located in the same substrate. Apparently, there are variations in 
the off-current, in the threshold voltage as well as on the field-effect 

185
mobility. However, when the off-current is removed from all the 
curves, the variability on the threshold voltage becomes residual. 
This minimization of the variability is shown in Fig. 5.12b. However, 
the application of the same correction of procedure to large-area 
TFTs shows no variations in mobility. Indeed, all the transfer curves 
run parallel to each other (see Fig. 5.12c). The fact that the dispersion 
in mobility is dependent on the area of the OTFT demonstrates 
conclusively that the variation in mobility arises from the presence 
of a parasitic source-drain current flowing outside the channel area.
Figure 5.12 Transfer curves measured in the saturation region for a set of 
identical OTFTs. As measured (a); After correcting (removal) the off-current in 
all the curves (b); Transfer curves measured in an identical set of OTFTs but with 
a larger active area (W = 40.000 mm, L = 40 mm) (c).
	
The parasitic fringing effect is schematically represented in 
Fig. 5.13a where the arrows represent the electric field lines. It is 
expected that this parasitic effect should be more pronounced 
under a high field applied (saturation regime) and for smaller area 
transistors. To eliminate this parasitic conduction, the semiconductor 
layer must be restricted to a region inside the inter-digitated source-
drain electrodes. A new design is shown in Fig. 5.13b.

Interestingly, using the proper printing design (represented in 
5.13b), all the transistor transfer curves run parallel to each other. 
Although the transistors have small areas, no variations in the 
mobility are observed as shown in Fig. 5.12c.

the channel area. (b) Layout design to reduce lateral fringe current.
5.5 Electronic Traps in TFTs
In this section, we discuss the various issues related to the presence 
of traps on organic-based TFT. Traps cause hysteresis effects, 
variations in the threshold voltage, changes in current output or 
transfer and output curves, changes in the charge-carrier transport, 
and pink noise. Traps are usually due to the presence of extrinsic 
impurities introduced during handling or by bad fabrication 

187
procedures. The TFT is so sensitive to the presence of traps that is 
an ideal tool to provide fast feedback of information for adjustment 
of the fabrication process.
	
Here we will address some basic techniques to detect the 
presence of traps and their location on the device geometry. The 
speed of measurements is of paramount importance. Therefore, 
these methods are suited to work on a phenomenological basis by 
looking for correlations between cause and effect and they require 
many samples.
	
A trap is an electronic state that can capture a free carrier. 
Electrical transport in organic semiconductors is by hopping 
(see Chapter 1 for a more detailed discussion) and it is always 
accompanied by frequent capture of the involved charge carriers in 
traps of localized states. Such trapped carriers may be released after 
a specific retention period. The retention period may be short or 
long. Here we considered deep trap states as immobile charge that 
does not participate in the electronic conduction. However, their 
Coulombic charge will influence the electric field distribution in a 
device and therewith the transport; for instance, threshold voltage 
shifts in TFTs are caused by immobile-trapped charge. However, if the 
release rate of trapped carriers is sufficiently low, a significant time 
will be necessary to reach quasi-thermal equilibrium conditions. 
This causes delay and hysteresis effects in alternating current (AC)-
operated devices.
	
The effects of traps on the electronic properties of TFTs are 
manifold:
 
∑ Reduced mobility
 
∑ Threshold voltages instabilities
 
∑ Temperature dependence of mobility
 
∑ Non-linearities in I–V curves
 
∑ Non-linearities in transfer curves
 
∑ Activation energy of current and mobility depends on bias
 
∑ Transient response follows stretched exponential decays
	
A trap is characterized by the following parameters, the density 
(Nt), the energetic depth with respect to the carrier bands (Et) the 
thermal emission rate (en, ep), and the capture cross-section (sn, sp)
	
To study a trap, we must find a way to control its occupation. 
This means we must know how to fill and empty it with charge 
Electronic Traps in TFTs

188
Organic Field-Effect Transistors
carriers. Then we must monitor either the filling or the emptying 
in a controlled way as a function of temperature, bias, frequency, 
etc. There are several recipes in the literature to perform these 
experiments. However, most of these recipes were originally 
developed for crystalline inorganic devices. Their application to 
organic-based devices is not always straightforward.
	
Prior to using trap detection techniques in OTFTs, one should 
take into consideration the following aspects:
 
∑ Traps are named “deep” when the energy required to remove an 
electron or hole from the trap to the bands is much larger than 
the characteristic thermal energy kT. Organic semiconductors 
are relatively wide bandgap semiconductors with a bandgap 
typically around 2 eV. Silicon has a bandgap of only 1.1 eV. 
Therefore, organic semiconductors can accommodate very 
deep traps. The meaning of a “deep trap” is very different in 
organic or silicon technology. A trap of 0.1 eV is considered 
deep in silicon technology, whereas in organic-based devices 
it is considered a shallow trap. A deep trap in organics may 
have an energetic depth of 0.5–0.8 eV. This has important 
consequences. While a deep trap in silicon can be filled and 
emptied in a matter of seconds at room temperature, in an 
organic semiconductor it may take an entire day to empty. 
Some techniques to look at deep traps in silicon operate in 
time scales of seconds to milliseconds. This means they are 
not applicable to studying traps in organic electronic devices.
 
∑ Traps in organic semiconductors usually have very large cross-
sections. This means they fill very fast. But because they are 
deep, they empty slowly. Trap filling times are several orders of 
magnitude faster than emptying times. From a practical point 
of view, in organic TFTs, it is easier to study traps during the 
filling process. In silicon-based devices, it is usually a standard 
procedure to study the traps during the emptying process. For 
silicon-based devices, the traps are first filled, usually at low 
temperatures, to prevent a rapid escape. This method may be 
impractical for organics because of the extremely long time 
required to monitor a trap release process.
 
∑ In silicon-based devices, trapped charge carriers can be de-
trapped by interaction with light, and the resulting current 

189
is recorded as a function of the wavelength of the light. In 
principle, such an optical stimulated current-spectrum would 
directly yield the energy distribution of the trap states if an 
optical transition from a trap state to the transport states is 
possible. Unfortunately, in many organic semiconductors, 
a direct transition from the trap state to the transport state 
is not allowed. Usually, the incident light excites the carrier 
into an excited state of the same molecule, from where a free 
carrier is generated by auto-ionization. Thus, the required 
optical transition energy is often not related to the energy 
difference between the trap and transport state as in silicon.
 
∑ The density of traps in organic semiconductors is relatively 
high. The trap concentration often is higher than the free 
carrier concentration.
	
In this section, we will make use of the non-ideal TFT 
characteristics as a simple tool to detect the presence of traps. 
Techniques to study deep traps will be discussed later.
5.5.1 TFT Non-ideal Characteristics as a Tool to Measure 
Traps
Information about the localized trap density can be obtained by 
measuring how much a transistor transfer curve deviates from 
the ideal behavior. The temperature dependence of the mobility 
or TFT drain-source current can provide insight into the energetic 
distribution of these localized charges. These techniques will be 
discussed in detail in the following sections.
5.5.1.1 Extraction of localized charge density from the TFT 
trap-free characteristics
An ideal TFT should have a linear transfer curve in the linear regime. 
Deviations from this behavior are caused by localized or immobile 
charges (traps). This density of localized charge is then considered 
by the g  parameter as discussed in Section 5.4.1. The g  parameter 
is related to a characteristic temperature, T0 of the density of states 
(DOS) by

The extraction of g can be made either from the linear or from the

5.4.1.
	
Although the linear region of operation is preferable, bad source 
and drain metal contacts (with contact resistance effects) may cause 
additional distortion in the linear transfer curve, making it difficult 
to extract g.
5.5.1.2 Temperature dependence of the charge transport
In this section, we examine the temperature dependencies of OTFTs. 
Unlike MOSFETs, organic-based transistors exhibit temperature 
dependencies that can be attributed to the presence of traps. By 
analyzing Arrhenius plots for different biases, we can gain valuable 
insight into the density of traps and their energetic distribution. Here, 
we will briefly describe three common temperature dependencies 

191
caused by (a) high density of discrete traps, (b) low-density discrete 
traps, and (c) traps that are distributed in energy. A more detailed 
analysis of these dependencies can be found in Suggested Readings, 
namely Stallinga and Gomes (2005 and 2006b).
(a) High density of discrete traps
A TFT free of traps should have a charge carrier mobility (mFET) that 
is independent of both bias and temperature. The presence of traps 
can lower the mobility by reducing the ratio of free-to-total charge, 
making it temperature-dependent but bias-independent. The reason 
for this is that free holes (p) in the conduction band, originally 
induced by the gate bias, can be captured by the traps, becoming 
positively charged. At thermal equilibrium, the ratio of densities 
of holes and charged traps (NT+) is determined by the energetic 
distance (ET – EV) between them, the relative abundance of the levels 
(NV and NT), and the temperature (T) according to

According to Eq. 5.20, the charge carrier mobility of TFTs with 
discrete traps is thermally activated and bias-independent. The 
slope of the Arrhenius plot provides the activation energy of mobility, 
which is equivalent to the depth of the trap level (Ea = ET – EV). This 
behavior is illustrated in Fig. 5.14a.
(b) Low-density of discrete traps
When a TFT has a low density of traps, the mobility will approach the 
intrinsic or band value (m0) as the traps become exhausted (filled). 
This occurs when the density of induced charge is comparable to the 
density of traps. The voltage at which this occurs is known as the 
trap-free-limit voltage for the gate bias.

To determine Vtfl, we can plot the mobility of a material as a 
function of the applied gate bias at a constant temperature. At the 
point where Vgs =Vtfl, there is a transition from a thermal-activated 
behavior to a temperature-independent behavior. With the Vtfl value 
known, we can then determine the concentration of trapped charges 
(NT). The temperature dependence of the mobility is illustrated in 
Fig. 5.14b.

different situations. A high-density discrete trap (a), low-density discrete traps 
(b), and for a device with a density of traps distributed in energy (c).
(c) High density of traps that are distributed in energy
The presence of traps distributed in energy makes the activation 
energy of the drain-source current (Ids) or carrier mobility (mFET) 
varies with the applied gate bias, therefore, the analysis of charge 
carrier transport is difficult. The activation energy of the mFET (and 
the current as well) can be determined by measuring the slope of an 
Arrhenius plot. This activation energy is dependent on the applied 
bias

When we plot an Arrhenius plot of the mobility for different 
applied biases, it is possible to observe that the curves converge to 
a single point. This behavior is referred to as the Meyer–Neldel rule. 
This behavior is illustrated in Fig. 5.14c.
	
For traps distributed in energy, it is not possible to extract the 
trap depth from the activation energy of the Arrhenius plot. This 
behavior is illustrated in Fig. 5.14c.
	
To summarize, a set of Arrhenius plots for different biases can 
serve as a useful tool for quickly evaluating the impurity density 
of an organic semiconductor. In cases where a sharp transition in 
mobility is observed in the transfer curves, the density of discrete 
traps can be directly determined using Vtfl, as shown in Eq. 5.21. In 
organic-based TFTs, traps are often distributed in energy. In this 
case, Arrhenius plots of the current or mobility will be straight lines, 
but the activation energy extracted from the slope will depend on 
the applied gate bias and will not give the trap depth.

5.5.2 Electrical Techniques to Study Traps
There are several electrical techniques to study traps. Often these 
methods require the fabrication of dedicated devices such as Schottky 
diodes and MIS capacitors. However, in some circumstances, TFTs 
Electronic Traps in TFTs

194

may also be used. Techniques that can be applied to TFTs are the 
following:
 
∑ Small-signal impedance spectroscopy (IS)
 
∑ Thermally stimulated currents (TSCs)
 
∑ Electrical noise
	
For a comprehensive understanding of these techniques, refer to 
Blood and Orton’s book (as listed in Suggested Readings). We will 
only provide a brief overview of the procedure.
5.5.2.1 Small-signal impedance spectroscopy
The MIS capacitor structure enables the examination of interfacial 
states through small-signal impedance techniques. This section will 
provide an overview of the basic concepts and outline the necessary 
device specifications to utilize small-signal impedance techniques 
with MIS capacitors. The MIS capacitor is a valuable diagnostic 
tool to assess the quality of the insulator-semiconductor interface, 
which significantly impacts transistor performance. For further 
information on these methods, refer to Nicollian and Brews and 
Blood and Orton (1992) (listed in Suggested Readings).
	
TFT configurations, such as the staggered structure, can be 
converted into an MIS capacitor by short-circuiting the drain and 
source contacts and treating them as a single terminal, as depicted 
in Fig. 5.15.
Figure 5.15 Schematic diagram of a TFT wired to be measured as a capacitor. 
MIS capacitors may also be fabricated in a nearby region.

195
	
An MIS capacitor can only reveal interfacial state information if the 
states can be probed at frequencies lower than the device relaxation 
frequency (fR). It is crucial to keep in mind that a MIS capacitor 
is a two-layer system, consisting of a high impedance layer (the 
insulator) in series with a low impedance layer (the semiconductor). 
The frequency dependence of the impedance exhibits a dispersion at 
a frequency fR, known as the Maxwell-Wagner relaxation.
	
This relaxation frequency must be within a reasonable 
observation window (10 Hz – 1 MHz) accessible to most RCL meters 
or impedance analyzers. This often requires a proper design of the 
MIS capacitor.
	
Once it is established that the MIS capacitor has a relaxation 
frequency high enough to perform small-signal impedance 
measurements, information about interfacial charges can be 
extracted by measuring the small-signal impedance for different 
applied biases and frequencies. The reason for that is that the 
insulating layer disconnects the interface states from the metal, 
making them communicate with the semiconductor more readily 
than with the metal.
	
The first step is to determine the effect of interface states on 
the impedance. An AC signal superimposed on a DC bias will cause 
the Fermi level to oscillate around a mean position. Any interface 
states within the modulation depth VAC around average Fermi level 
will change their occupancy during an AC cycle and the emitted and 
captured charges contribute to a capacitance

with A the area of the device, q the elementary charge, Nis the density 
of interface states per eV per unit area. The trapped charges are 
released with a characteristic time constant t. For low frequencies 
(compared to the trap time constant), the measured capacitance is 
as given by Eq. (5.24). As the frequency (ɷ = 2 pf), increases the trap 
state will not be able to respond and the AC signal will decrease.
	
It is standard practice to model the impedance variations caused 
by changes in the occupancy of traps by using an equivalent circuit 
like the one shown in Fig. 5.16. The circuit comprises a capacitance 
equal to Cis and a resistance to provide a time constant (RC) of 
the circuit equal to the relaxation time (t) of the trap levels. It is 
Electronic Traps in TFTs

196
Organic Field-Effect Transistors
important to note that while the capacitance holds a real physical 
significance, the resistance only defines the time constant. To 
determine the measured capacitance (CP) and loss (GP/ɷ) of the 
circuit, and therefore the interface states, the serial circuit of Cis 
and Ris must be transformed into a parallel circuit according to the 
following relations:
Figure 5.16 Schematic representation of a discrete level and interface states 
distributed at the Insulator/semiconductor interface. The AC response of these 
states can be modeled by equivalent RC circuits (b). The parallel CP and RP circuit 
can be converted into a series Ris Cis circuit (c). The converting equations are in 
the text.

The DOS at a region qVac + kT around the Fermi level can be

Having determined the interface state density, the next step in 
mapping the interface states involves determining the energetic 
position of the traps. This can be accomplished by observing the 
movement in the loss peak with temperature. The trap relaxation

5.5.2.2 Thermally stimulated currents
The presence of trapped charge carriers in TFTs can be confirmed 
using TSC measurements. This method involves filling the traps with 
charge carriers by applying a bias at low temperatures, where the 
trapped carriers cannot be freed by thermal energy. The temperature 
is then raised linearly, and the liberated carriers contribute to an 
excess current, which is measured as a function of temperature 
during heating. TSC measurements can provide information about 
the trap depth, density, and capture cross-section. The experimental 
procedure involves filling the traps at room temperature, connecting 
the TFT as a capacitor, and measuring the discharging current as 
the TFT is heated at a constant rate. TSC measurements can only 
be used with relatively insulating materials, such as normally off 
Electronic Traps in TFTs

or fully depleted TFTs. The behavior of TSC curves is illustrated in 
Fig. 5.17. It is important to measure a TSC curve without trap 
filling. The baseline current is usually due to leakage currents or 
experimental artifacts. The baseline is very important to confirm 
that the current measured is due to a charge carrier de-trapping 
mechanism.
Figure 5.17 Schematic diagram of the typical behavior of TSC curves. The inset 
shows the electrical connections to operate the transistor during trap filling 
and trap empty. Trap filling can be accomplished by driving the transistor into a 
saturation regime, or by exposing the transistor to light.
	
For a single trap level, a TSC curve has one maximum that 
depends on capture cross-section, heating rate, and trap depth. 
By varying the heating rates the trap depth and capture cross-
section can also be determined. Because de-trapping currents are 
extremely small (pico-amps), TSC can only be used with relatively 
insulating materials. Normally off or fully depleted TFTs satisfy this 
requirement. When performing TSC experiments, the transistor is 
connected as an MIS capacitor.
	
The experimental procedure involves the following steps:
	
1	 The trap filling is performed at room temperature. The 
filling bias conditions are kept until the TFT is brought to 
temperatures low enough that de-trapping can be disregarded.

199
	
2	 At low temperatures the TFT is connected as a capacitor. Drain 
and source terminals are short. A picoammeter measures the 
capacitor discharging current between the gate terminal and 
the drain and source terminals.
	
3	 The TFT then is heated at a constant rate, β = dT/dt, up to high 
temperatures. The trapped carriers are released and collected 
at the grounded source and drain electrodes. The temperature 
where a current peak occurs is related to the energetic depth 
of the trap state and the area under the peak is related to the 
trap density.
	
The density of filled traps, Nt, can be estimated from the time-
integrated TSC current as:
	
Q
eN A
Idt
=
=Ú
t
	
(5.31)
where Q is the integrated total charge and A is the surface area 
between the electrodes.
	
The extraction of the trap parameters from TSC measurements 
is not straightforward. The current temperature profile depends not 
only on the density, depth, but also distribution of the traps, but also 
on the details of the charge transport such as charge carrier mobility 
and the occurrence of re-trapping. Several models can be applied, 
viz. the initial rise time, method, and the heating rate method.
	
The initial rise method is valid for all types of recombination 
kinetics and assumes that the current in the initial part of the 
curve, when the traps begin to empty, is exponentially dependent 
on temperature. This method is often used when the full TSC curve 
cannot be recorded or is distorted by other processes. The method 
only provides the trap depth and is usually less accurate than the 
other models.
	
A more reliable determination of the trap depth is obtained from 
the relation between the heating rate β and the temperature of the 
peak maximum, Tm, as described by Blood and Orton (see Suggested 
Readings) in Eq. (5.32)

Special care must be taken when using TFTs connected as 
capacitors to perform TSC experiments. Often the bottom electrode 
is the entire substrate. When a filling bias is applied, it may charge 
the entire semiconductor area which is larger than the device area. 
The charges in the vicinity of the TFT can diffuse to the contacts and 
the leads, where they are collected and measured in the external 
circuit. The released charges during the TSC curve are extracted from 
an area larger than that between the TFT electrodes. This may lead 
to discrepancies between the expected charge and the measured 
charge.
5.6 Circuits and Systems
Having studied the electrical performance of individual transistors, 
it is now important to understand how they behave when connected 
to circuits. A simple circuit is an inverter. It is based only on two 
transistors and is well suited to prove the capability of organic TFTs 
to build up more complex circuits. The inverter must show signal 
amplification and, most importantly, its output signal must be able to 
drive a subsequent inverter stage. The last requirement can be tested 
with a ring oscillator (RO). This device consists of an odd number of 
inverters connected in series. Fig. 5.18 shows the schematics of a 
three-stage RO. A RO is often used to demonstrate a new technology. 
ROs are used to measure the effects of manufacturing process 
variations.
	
It is important to emphasize that one should only embark on the 
process of making circuits when individual TFTs perform reasonably 
well. Circuits will not work properly if the threshold voltage of 
individual TFTs is not stable (suffers gate bias stress), or if the 
current modulation ratio is poor. On/off drain current ratios reaching 
103–104 are considered as a minimum to obtain suitable ROs.
	
Inverters and ROs may fulfill two objectives: (i) to show that the 
processing technology is mature enough to fabricate circuits and (ii) 
to monitor variations caused by systematic and random physical 
effects. We will present first the electrical characterization of simple 

201
inverter circuits, and later we will explain how ROs are important to 
quantify transistor variability introduced by the fabrication process.
Figure 5.18 Schematic diagram of a single-ended inverter-based RO.
5.6.1 Inverter Circuits
The most basic logic gate is the inverter. It is commonly represented 
in the form of a pull-down and a pull-up transistor. Figure 5.19 shows 
the schematics of commonly used configurations of inverters. The 
selection of a particular configuration depends on the characteristics 
of the individual TFTs, for instance, if they are normally-on or 
normally-off type.

configuration (c); ratioed with two voltages; resistor load (RL) configuration (d).
Circuits and Systems

202
Organic Field-Effect Transistors
	
Circuits using only one type of semiconductor (either n-type or 
p-type) require a combination of one pull-up or pull-down transistor 
that is always in its on-state.
	
The load transistor can be connected to its source (see 
Fig. 5.19a), to its drain (Fig. 5.19b), or to an independent bias voltage 
source as shown in Fig. 5.19c. If the gate is connected to its source, 
the gate-source voltage, Vgs, is null. A normally-on transistor in this 
configuration has an approximately constant drain current if it 
operates in the saturation region. Hence, the configuration of a load 
transistor with the gate connected to its source is referred to as the 
current-source load (CSL) configuration.
	
The fact that most organic semiconductor materials have 
normally-on behavior (high off-current) leads to poor performance 
of the input transistor, as it can only be switched off by bringing the 
transistor into depletion mode, for example, by biasing it in negative 
voltages. The configuration in Fig. 5.19c allows the biasing of the 
transistor into depletion mode. By applying a positive VSS we can 
move the OTFT into depletion and increase the on/off drain current 
ratio.
	
Figure 5.19d uses a resistor as the pull-up element connecting 
the output to the supply rail VDD.
	
Figure 5.20 shows the relationship between output voltages as 
a function of the input voltage known as the voltage transfer (VTC) 
curve.
Figure 5.20 Schematic of a CSL-type inverter (a); voltage transfer characteristics 
(b).

203
	
The output voltage is determined by the ratio between the 
channel resistance of the drive transistor at a given input voltage 
and the resistance of the load element. For this reason, these gate 
topologies are called ratioed logic.
5.6.2 Circuit Characterization
A simple characterization of an inverter circuit requires the 
measurement of the following figures of merit:
 – Valid logic levels and noise margin.
 – Rise and fall times.
 – Driving capability.
	
These characteristics, and especially the first two, logic levels/
noise margin and timing, can also be used for evaluating the 
performance of any OTFT implementation.
5.6.3 Ring Oscillators
A basic ring oscillator circuit is made up of an odd number of inverter 
circuits in series, with a feedback loop for oscillation. Applying a 
pulse starts the oscillation, and the frequency can be measured at the 
output. This frequency, which depends on the physical factors of the 
manufacturing process, provides valuable information to engineers 
for device optimization. RO frequency is sensitive to transistor 
parameters discussed previously, namely the charge carrier mobility 
and the threshold voltage. The RO frequency is approximated as:
	
f
I
CVN
RO
stages
=
	
(5.34)
where fRO is frequency, I is the transistor current, C is the load 
capacitance for a single stage, V is the supply voltage, and Nstages is 
the number of RO-inverter inverter stages.
5.6.4 Summary
OTFT operational stability is crucial for the proper functioning of a RO. 
Variations in threshold voltage impact the noise margins. Thus, high 
transistor variability limits the number of inverter stages that can 
be used to implement a ring oscillator. Since ring oscillators oscillate 
Circuits and Systems

204
Organic Field-Effect Transistors
at a frequency dependent on the characteristics and dimensions of 
the transistors used as the loads in each inverter, these circuits are a 
very helpful tool to detect and quantify variability.
5.7 TFTs for Bioelectronic Applications
To use OTFTs as sensors, we must disturb or cause a change in 
one or more of the transistor parameters, (i) threshold voltage, (ii) 
off-current, and (i) field-effect mobility. Therefore, TFTs are multi-
parameter and amplifying sensing devices. Chemicals, biological 
substances, and even living cells may interact with several parts of 
the device structure and change the TFT parameters. Basically, there 
are three different strategies to use a TFT as a sensor:
 – Floating gate method.
 – Changes in the TFT channel or at the channel/contact interface.
 – Changes in the dielectric layer.
5.7.1 Floating Gate Method
The floating gate method has been substantially explored with 
inorganic TFTs. This method has been used to fabricate neuron-
device interfaces, as shown in Fig. 5.21a. Neurons generate small 
voltage fluctuations on top of the floating gate terminal and 
modulate the channel current underneath. An identical approach 
was implemented using organic TFTs (see Fig. 5.21b). However, 
the TFTs used for this purpose have their channels exposed and do 
not have a built-in dielectric layer or even a gate terminal. The gate 
dielectric will be established only when the device is immersed into 
the electrolyte and the electrolyte itself plays the role of the gate 
terminal. This occurs because, when conductive or semiconductive 
materials are immersed into electrolytes, an electrical double-layer 
(Helmholtz layer) is established at the metal/electrolyte interface. 
This layer has a high capacitance and an associated resistance. The 
electrical double-layer is conveniently described by a parallel RC 
network, as shown in Fig. 5.21. This electrochemical layer plays the 
role of a dielectric. The capacitance is usually high (mF/cm2) and the 
associated parallel resistance is in the range of a few kΩ/cm2. Cells 
generate low-frequency signals (f < 1 kHz) with amplitude in the mV 

205
range. These low-frequency bioelectrical signals are easily coupled 
through the double-layer capacitance (CD) and modulate the TFT 
channel current.

Configuration used on inorganic devices (a). Electrolyte-gated transistors using 
organic semiconductors (b).
	
Bioelectronic organic-based devices usually make use of a third 
metal terminal, which is in contact with the electrolyte as shown in 
Fig. 5.22.

a second gate terminal.
TFTs for Bioelectronic Applications

206
Organic Field-Effect Transistors
	
The channel modulation by a DC voltage in an electrolyte 
medium can be complex. We may assume that ions brought near 
the semiconductor/electrolyte surface electrostatically modulate 
the channel conductance. Alternatively, the ions penetrate the 
TFT channel, causing a chemical oxidation or reduction of the 
organic semiconductor channel. Independently of the mechanism, 
bioelectrical transistors, known as electrolyte-gated transistors, 
show I–V characteristics like a solid-state transistor. To prevent 
electrolysis, the range of DC voltages that can be applied is limited to 
voltages below |1 V|.
	
These sensing TFTs may have also a built-in bottom gate. In this 
case, when immersed in electrolyte solution they become double-
gate TFTs. The built-in gate may also be used to select a convenient 
bias operating point.
	
These transistors have been successfully explored to measure 
signals in neuronal cells. However, before the application of these 
devices can be established some issues that need to be addressed, 
namely:
	
(i)	 The double-layer capacitance varies with time due to some 
unknown parameters. Besides, cells also change their 
surrounding environment and, possibly, change the properties 
of the electrical double-layer.
	 (ii)	 The sensing layer changes continuously with time. These 
drifts must be properly understood and quantified prior 
to establishing reliable use of the devices in bioelectronic 
applications.
5.7.2 TFTs for Gas Sensing
If the TFT channel is exposed to the ambient, the detection of a 
particular species only depends on the way it interacts with the 
organic semiconductor. For instance, oxygen or TNT molecules dope 
the semiconductor while water undoped it. This interaction with the 
semiconductor layer changes the TFT parameters, depending on if 
the interaction is with the bulk, or with the channel layer.
	
Interaction with the bulk layer causes changes in the transistor 
off-current (see Fig. 5.23a). In principle, the TFT transfer curve 
shifts in a parallel fashion with respect to the initial curve. When 

207
the change in the off-current is too large, this may cause apparent 
changes in the curve shape. Care is required in the interpretation of 
the data. The comparison between curves should only be done for 
identical current levels.
	
Interaction with the TFT channel layer can change both mobility 
and threshold voltage (see Fig. 5.23b). The transfer curve changes 
shape. To quantify these changes, we must make use of the gamma 
parameter explained in Section 5.4.1.
	
Interaction with the channel may also affect the carrier injection 
at the metal/semiconductor contacts. This gives rise to changes in 
the output I–V curves near the origin. These changes will be easy 
to pick up by measuring a transfer curve at a relatively low bias. 
Usually, a change in slope is observed.
Figure 5.23 Schematic representation of the TFT transfer curves and the 
corresponding changes when the device is exposed to an electrically active 
substance. Changes on the TFT off-current are expected if the interaction 
is limited to the semiconductor top surface (a). Changes, both on VT and on 
mFET may occur if the TFT channel is disturbed by the diffusion or electrostatic 
interaction of absorbed species (b).
5.7.3 Changes in the Dielectric Layer
Interaction with the dielectric layer causes a change in the threshold 
voltage. This is a well-established sensing method for inorganic-
based transistors. Usually, the dielectric layer is exposed and made 
of a material that can interact with the substance to be detected. 
Often the dielectric is a porous material allowing the diffusion of the 
analyte.

5.8 Conclusions
The methods and recipes presented in this chapter can be applied 
to all TFTs, independently of the materials used. In organic 
semiconductors the carrier transport is slow; traps are abundant and 
energetically deep. Because of this, the electrical characterization 
recipes developed to study silicon-based devices are not directly 
transferable to organic semiconductors. This chapter pinpoints 
some of the major differences between the two technologies and 
shows how to adapt the characterization methods developed for 
silicon devices to TFTs based on organic semiconductors.
	
Using the experience gained from the a-Si:H TFT, important 
progress has been made in the understanding of the basic device 
physics of organic TFTs. Influences of the semiconductor band 
structure, gate dielectric defects, interface DOS, etc. on TFT 
characteristics, lifetime, failure mechanism, etc. are now understood. 
This knowledge allows us to use the TFT as a powerful evaluation 
tool for new materials and new manufacturing technologies. There 
are constant efforts in searching for new types of organic molecules 
and polymers to improve performance or to reduce production costs.
	
Nowadays, the major challenge faced by organic TFTs is reliability, 
in particular the deterioration of the device characteristics with time. 
In this context, the methods presented in this chapter to measure 
traps and interfacial states are a crucial part of the characterization 
work.
	
The TFT is a versatile solid-state transistor configuration that 
can be applied to a wide range of products. It is difficult to predict in 
which areas or products organic TFTs will have a big impact in the 
future. The key impact areas are expected to be the following:
	
(i)	 Flexible electronics.
	
	 Organic TFTs formed on bendable substrates can be used in 
lightweight, unbreakable, flexible OLED displays on plastic 
substrates.
	 (ii)	 Simple circuits.
	
	 With the transistor performance that is available today a wide 
range of applications can already be addressed, such as simple 
logic, memory, and I/O circuits integrated with chemical and 
biological sensors.

209
	 (iii)	 Sensors, 
detectors, 
bioelectronics 
interfaces 
and 
neuromorphic circuits.
	
TFTs can be easily modified or connected to other devices to 
detect or generate changes in chemical, biological, optical, magnetic, 
radioactive, and other properties by controlling the transport of 
charge carriers, etc.
	
Many fundamental research challenges that need to be addressed 
remain, but it appears likely that organic TFTs will find several niche 
applications.
Questions and Answers
	Q: 1.	 The definition of VT from conventional MOSFETs does not 
apply to OFETs. What is the practical utility of this parameter?
	
	 A: VT is not an intrinsic TFT parameter. It is physically related 
to the presence of traps. The extraction of VT from the transfer 
curves may be used to quantify the density of traps and the 
operational stability.
	Q: 2.	 Charge carrier mobility can be estimated using the Hall effect, 
time-of-flight, or from space charge–limited current (SCLC) 
measurements. How do mobility values extracted from 
these techniques compare with mobility values extracted by 
measuring TFT transfer curves?
	
	 A: The mobility determined by the Hall effect or time-of-flight 
reflects the charge carrier transport through the bulk material 
and it is usually higher than the field-effect mobility extracted 
using a TFT structure. Scattering centers at the interface 
control the mobility in a TFT. It depends on the quality of the 
interface and the dielectric used.
	Q: 3.	 The mobility can be extracted from a linear fit of the gate 
voltage dependence of the current in the linear regime or the 
square root of the current in the saturation regime. However, 
questions arise when the device exhibits deviations from this 
ideal behavior. Summarize the common issues encountered 
and the strategies to circumvent them.
	
	 A: Three sources of non-ideal behavior are often encountered:
	
	 (i) Device characteristics exhibit clockwise hysteresis. This 
is usually due to the current degrading on the timescale 
of the electrical measurement, and this instability reflects

charge trapping. If the sweep rate is increased to mask this 
instability, this can lead to overestimated mobility values that 
do not reflect an equilibrium charge carrier concentration and 
continuous current carrying capability of the OFET.
	
	 (ii) The slope of the transfer curve increases super-linearly. 
It is typically associated with the presence of localized states 
in the tails of the DOS, which need to be filled before charge 
carriers can access parts of the DOS with more delocalized, 
or high-mobility states. The curve may be linearized using a 
gamma parameter and the DOS extracted.
	
	 The mobility extracted from a linear fit in a limited gate 
voltage range at high gate voltages may be interpreted as a 
genuine transport parameter.
	
	 (iii) The slope of the square root of the current versus gate 
voltage in the saturated transfer characteristics is high at 
small gate voltage but decreases with increasing magnitude 
of the gate voltage. Such behavior may be attributed to 
contact resistance effects: the current becomes more contact-
limited, as the interfacial accumulation layer becomes more 
conducting at high gate voltages.
	
	 The mobility value extracted by fitting only the low voltage 
region may reflect a meaningful transport parameter, although 
it does not reflect the practical current drive capability of the 
device as the high mobility cannot be maintained at high 
voltages.
	Q: 4.	 TFTs usually have a current in the absence of an external 
gate voltage (off-current). This is a non-ideal behavior. Please 
explain how is possible to gain insight into their physical 
origin.
	
	 A: Usually, the off-current has two types of dependence on VDS. 
These are illustrated in Fig. 5.24. It may behave like a resistor 
curve linear over the entire voltage range or it may saturate. 
One should also inspect how this current varies when a reverse 
gate voltage is applied. Linear off-currents usually cannot be 
modulated by the gate voltage. Saturating off-currents can 
be substantially reduced by applying a reserve gate voltage. 
The linear behavior over the entire voltage Vds range shows 
that the channel behaves as a resistor. This means there is a 
carrier flow in parallel with the TFT accumulation channel. 

211
This parallel resistance can be through the bulk region. 
Depending on the magnitude of this current it may prevent 
saturation. Strategies to minimize include. Protect the TFT 
surface; by keeping it in a controlled environment or by using 
encapsulation. Water and oxygen absorbed in the surface 
cause the parallel leakage path.
	
	 If the off-current follows the typical behavior of an I–V this 
means that the organic layer is doped and there is a built-in 
channel.
Figure 5.24 Two schematic representations of the TFT off-current. Linear and 
gate voltage independent, (a) and off-currents caused by built-in channel (b).
	Q: 5.	 Lateral conduction and fringing effects may cause parasitic 
effects and lead to wrong TFT parameter extraction. Draw a 
device structure that can prevent this artifact.
	
	 A:

Questions and Answers

212
Organic Field-Effect Transistors
	Q: 6.	 Explain the physical origin of light-induced effects in organic 
TFTs.
	
	 A: Light with energy equal to the bandgap of the organic 
semiconductor generates electron-hole pairs. Some of the 
photo-generated carriers will contribute directly to the 
electrical conduction (fast effects) others will become trapped 
or neutralize the trapped charge (long-lived effects). The long-
lived effects will depend on the sign and density of traps before 
illumination. For instance, if the photo-generated neutralizes 
electrons trapped on the dielectric surface, a decrease in the 
threshold voltage will be observed.
	
	 	 Light can also be a tool to change the occupation of trapped 
chargers and obtain information about them. In organic 
devices is not possible to establish a relation between the 
energy of the light and the trap depth. This neutralization 
process depends on the population of the photo-generated 
carriers.
	Q: 7.	 Outline some strategies to improve TFT operational stability.
	
	 A: The quality of the dielectric/semiconductor interface 
determines whether the TFT will operate properly. It is crucial 
to select a proper dielectric and handle it carefully. Water is 
the most difficult contaminant to remove from dielectric 
surfaces. Even using vacuum processing techniques water is 
always present. The best strategy is to passivate the dielectric 
surface using ultrathin hydrophobic layers.
	Q: 8.	 TFTs are multi-parameter sensing devices. Outline some 
strategies as well as some precautions when using TFT 
parameters in sensing applications.
	
	 A: In sensing applications, the device is either monitored 
continuously or periodically. The prolonged application of 
bias usually causes drifts and changes, for instance, in the 
VT not related to the presence of the substance to detect. 
It is important to devise a method where intrinsic device 
instabilities are not measured. For instance, the device is only 
switched on for periods of time and left resting for long periods 
of time to allow recovery. An interesting alternative is to use 
small-signal impedance techniques. Oscillating small fields 
at low frequencies can be used to monitor the TFT channel 

213
resistance and conductance using LCR meters or impedance 
analyzers. These methods usually do not cause drifts in the 
properties of TFTs.

6.1 Introduction
Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are much like classic light-
emitting diodes (LEDs)—able to generate light from electrical 
energy (see Fig. 6.1). Obvious potential applications are thus similar 
to what is already known about LEDs, ranging from their use as 
direct light sources in lamps to backlighting units in displays, when 
combined with a light guide.
	
Unlike LEDs, OLEDs consist of several very thin stacked layers 
and do not rely on small, point-shaped single crystals (see Fig. 6.2). 
Because of their form factor, they are two-dimensional light sources, 
which enables new applications. Recent prototypes demonstrated

devices with bendable, semitransparent displays using OLED 
technology. On the other hand, product designers dream of using 
luminescent foils made from OLEDs on soda cans as smart labels, on 
semitransparent light-emitting windows, and even on the front of 
buildings as decorative elements.
Figure 6.1 OLEDs are thin, potentially flexible devices that transform 
electricity into visible light. The most striking difference between OLEDs and 
classic LEDs is their form factor; with the latter being small, point-shaped light 
sources, their organic counterparts may be used for large-area lighting. Photo

OLEDs from the ground up can be easily understood following 
the steps that led to the development of these innovative devices. 
Therefore, we will give a schematic overview of the research history 
that led to the original publication of OLEDs by Tang and Van Slyke 

219
Introduction
from Kodak Labs in 1987, before we move on to a detailed description 
of state-of-the-art OLEDs and the variety of possible modifications 
that are present in current devices.
6.1.1 History
6.1.1.1 First observation of electroluminescence in the early 
20th century
Even though the major parts of OLEDs consist of organic materials, 
their development has originally been triggered by findings based 
on inorganic materials. It was in 1907 when the young researcher 
H.  J. Round discovered electrically generated luminescence, 
electroluminescence. He applied a voltage of approximately 10 V on 
silicon carbide, also known as carborundum, a common grinding 
material that has been known since the 19th century. Round observed 
yellowish to orange-colored light, depending on the way the carbide 
had been synthesized. These findings did not directly lead to a 
specific application but caused other researchers to study materials 
under such special conditions. In 1963, Pope and coworkers reported 
electroluminescence from an anthracene crystal, that is, an organic 
material. Unfortunately, high voltages above 100 V were required 
to reach reasonable intensity. This was due to inefficient charge 
injection into the crystal in combination with poor charge transport 
within the material due to grain boundaries and defects inherent in 
the crystal.
	
In general, the electrical properties of inorganic and organic 
materials are not alike. Especially in terms of conductivity, things 
change drastically when moving from inorganic to organic materials. 
To operate devices with organic materials at low voltages, layer 
thicknesses of less than 100 nm are common.
6.1.1.2 Inorganic light-emitting diodes
The first triumph in the history of semiconductor physics was the 
red-emitting GaAs LED developed by Nick Holonyak Jr. in 1962. He 
had been working on diodes with inorganic III–V semiconductors. 
He used GaAs with different dopings (p- and n-type) to construct 
a sandwich-type device architecture with an undoped GaAs layer 
between a p-type doped and an n-type doped layer, which both had 

220
The Basics of Organic Light-Emitting Diodes
been contacted by two electrodes (see Fig. 6.3). Once operating, this 
diode structure would emit light from the undoped layer, resulting 
in the first LED. The layers had been vapor-deposited, which is still 
the process to commercially produce both LEDs and OLEDs today.
Figure 6.3 Patented three-layer structure of the first inorganic LED by N. 
Holonyak Jr., May 3, 1966, Pat. 3,249,473.
	
This discovery started the work on LEDs and resulted in their 
current potential for (back-)lighting applications across many 
devices, mostly display and efficient lighting, but also status 
indicators on many electrical devices. Nevertheless, inorganic LEDs 
have two limitations, especially for lighting applications.
	
Since these crystals are small and bright point-shaped light 
sources, they typically show glare effects and are therefore not 
suitable for pleasant area lighting. Therefore, small lenses or larger 
light-guiding systems are used to spread the light over a larger area. 
Additionally, color tuning in LEDs is complicated because it relies on 
the down-conversion of energy with various phosphors to end up 
with an emission in the desired part of the visible spectrum.
6.1.1.3 Electroluminescence in organic matter
As already shown before, electroluminescence is not limited to 
inorganic materials. Using a similar vacuum deposition process as 
Holonyak Jr. did for GaAs, P. S. Vincett reported relatively efficient 
electroluminescence from amorphous films of anthracene (and 
other organics) in 1982. He explained the intense blue emission 
between 12 and 30 V by homogenous charge transport through the 
layer.
	
An important difference between organic and inorganic 
conductors is the fact that charge is mainly de-localized in so-called 

221
Introduction
energy bands in inorganic materials, whereas charge is transported 
via hopping between localized states in organic materials. This causes 
the charge carrier mobility and therefore conductivity of organic 
matter to be much smaller compared to metals or semiconductors. 
This is the reason why Pope et al. had to use up to 400 V to generate 
luminescence. The intrinsically smaller charge carrier mobility 
of organic substances did not prevent researchers from realizing 
classical semiconductor applications such as transistors, solar cells, 
and OLEDs, though.
6.1.1.4 The first OLEDs with Alq3
A combination of the above findings led to the first report of the first 
OLED by Tang and Van Slyke in 1987. They had built up a sandwich-
type device from vacuum-deposited organic materials, resulting in 
a sequence of amorphous layers with specific functions, similar to 
the LED, described earlier. Onto a transparent (inorganic) anode 
(indium tin oxide, ITO), which was deposited on a glass substrate, 
they deposited a hole-transporting diamine layer (corresponds to 
p-type side in LED) and an electron-transporting layer (n-type) of 
aluminum (III)-quinolate (Alq3), which also acted as the emitter 
molecule at the same time. The cathode consisted of coevaporated 
Mg:Al (see Fig. 6.4).
	
This device architecture required only low voltages (<10 V) for 
efficient light emission above 1000 cd/m2 (candela per square meter, 
also called nits). For comparison, the light intensity of most display 
applications usually stays below 300 nits. Even though the efficiency 
values of 1.5 lm/W (lumen per watt) were relatively high and the 
external quantum efficiency (EQE) reached a photon:electron ratio 
of 1%, there was much room for improvement. To discuss these 
options, we need to take a look at a basic OLED structure with the 
specific functions of each layer and the material that is used (see 
Section 6.2).
	
While the first reported OLED has been based on evaporated 
small molecules, Jeremy Burroughes et al. published the first OLED 
with a polymeric emitter in 1990, using poly-phenylene-vinylidene 
(PPV). A major improvement of OLEDs in terms of efficiency step 
was the use of phosphorescent metal-organic emitters by Forrest 
and Thompson, which is the foundation of modern OLED emitters 
in 1998. Further development in highly efficient emitters led to the 

222
The Basics of Organic Light-Emitting Diodes
presentation of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) 
in organic emitters by the group of Chihaya Adachi in 2011 and in 
copper-based emitters by the group of Hartmut Yersin in the same 
year. The main characteristics of the three emitter concepts will be 
discussed in more detail in the following section.
Figure 6.4 The first OLED with a four-layer OLED structure from Tang and Van 
Slyke, 1987. The function of each layer is mentioned in the upper figure.
6.2 Structure of an OLED
6.2.1 Basic Device Structure
A so-called bottom-emission OLED is shown in Fig. 6.5, that is, with 
a transparent electrode on the substrate side, resulting in light 
emission into or through the transparent substrate.
	
On the opposite, a top-emission OLED is a device that emits light 
through the top electrode. The top electrode can be a semitransparent 
cathode, but this construction leads to a strong microcavity effect. 
Another way to build a top-emission OLED is to invert the stack and 
use a metal foil as substrate. Inverted OLEDs usually suffer from poor 
electron injection which results in low efficiency. In addition, metal 

223
Structure of an OLED
foils exhibit high roughness, harmful for a multilayer construction 
requiring flat layers. Thus, polishing metal foil substrates tends to 
result in electrical insulation.
Figure 6.5 Bottom-emission OLED structure: anode/HIL/HTL(HBL)/EML/
ETL(HBL)/EIL/cathode. The corresponding layer thicknesses are indicated next 
to their function. OLEDs commonly consist of several layers, for example, a 
supporting substrate made of glass, metal, or plastic foils; electrodes for the 
generation of charge carriers; layers to enable charge carrier transport; and 
one or several emission layers, where charge carriers recombine and light is 
generated.
	
Therefore, this chapter will assume that the OLED device is 
fabricated in the long-established architecture, which is a bottom-
emission OLED stack. This stack consists of a transparent carrier 
substrate, a transparent anode of about 50 nm thickness, followed 
by a hole injection layer (HIL), which supports efficient charge 
injection into the organic material. The thickness of the HIL can vary 
between 10 nm and 40 nm. Since the anode withdraws negatively 
charged electrons from the organic layer, the resulting occupancy 
can be regarded as a positively charged particle moving in a direction 
opposite to the electrons. This concept is widely used for easier 
visualization of charge movement within the layers.
	
The HIL is followed by a hole transport layer (HTL), which acts as 
a mediator between the injection layer and the emissive layer (EML), 
in the center of the device. The thickness of the HTL can be tuned 
(between 20 and 200 nm) to adjust the charge balance and therefore 

224
The Basics of Organic Light-Emitting Diodes
improve the charge recombination confinement in the subsequent 
layer. The EML (10 nm–80 nm thick) converts the incoming charges, 
holes, and electrons, into so-called excitons, charge pairs that can 
be then converted into photons by the emitter molecules. In their 
original publication, Tang and Van Slyke used a layer of neat Alq3 
in the EML. Further research has led to the adoption of a more 
sophisticated layout of this layer. It usually consists of a host–
guest system, with the emitter doped into a host material at low 
concentrations. Such design allowed the optimization of charge 
transport onto the host molecule and the emission properties on the 
emitter separately from each other. The host molecule was designed 
to have high stability when participating in charge transport and 
high morphological stability to prevent, for example, crystallization 
and the formation of grain boundaries as well as to transport charge 
carriers efficiently. The emitting molecule needs to convert energy to 
light efficiently. Preferably, nonradiative processes are suppressed to 
achieve internal efficiency values close to 100%. Other parameters 
to characterize emitters are the emission decay time (synonyms: 
excited-state lifetime or exciton lifetime), which needs to be as 
short as possible. Ideally, the spectra generated by excitation with 
UV photons (photoluminescence) and the spectra of OLED devices 
(electroluminescence) are superimposable. While the spectrum 
needs to be in the spectral range that can be detected by the human 
eye, for example, between 400 and 800 nm, the shape depends on 
the application of the OLED. In displays, the spectrum needs to be 
narrow to give red, green, and blue in decent quality. For lighting 
applications, broad spectra can be tolerated to achieve white light.
	
The electrons are transported into the EML by the electron 
transport layer (ETL). The ETL is usually deposited with a layer 
thickness of 40 nm to 100 nm and is then followed by an electron 
injection layer (EIL), with the function of enhancing electron injection 
from the metallic cathode. The EIL is a very thin layer that can be as 
low as 0.5 nm and up to 5 nm and the cathode commonly reaches 
100 nm in thickness.
	
When an external direct current (DC) bias is applied, electrons 
migrate from the cathode through the EIL and the ETL into the EML 

225
and holes migrate from the anode via the HIL and the HTL into 
the EML. The opposite charges attract each other and recombine 
to an exciton, which then excites an emitter molecule, which then 
consequently emits light. If a host is present, the charge carrier 
recombination can take place on the host molecules, which reduces 
the electrical stress on the emitter and therefore increases the 
operating lifetime of the OLED device.
	
To enhance the confinement of holes and electrons within the 
EML, the HTL, and the ETL can behave as electron-blocking and hole-
blocking layers, respectively (EBL/HBL). Controlled confinement of 
charges in the EML results in an increase in efficiency. The electron-
blocking function of the HTL is enabled by a high lowest unoccupied 
molecular orbital (LUMO); the hole-blocking function of the ETL is 
enabled by a low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).
6.2.2 Charge and Energy Transfer in OLED Devices
The organic molecules in OLEDs are semiconductors, in a similar 
fashion to the III–V semiconductors in LEDs. While inorganic 
semiconductors are usually crystalline materials with defined 
conduction bands, their organic counterparts are fused aromatic (i.e., 
unsaturated) systems that have so-called molecular orbitals. These 
can transport positive and negative charge carriers, called holes and 
electrons, respectively. The main orbitals that have to be taken into 
account for charge transport characteristics are the HOMO and the 
LUMO. Holes are transported via the HOMO and electrons through 
the LUMO, which is higher in energy than the HOMO by definition. 
The energy levels of different materials vary and are the basis for 
the selection of materials in an OLED stack in order to allow for ideal 
charge transport. The energy steps between adjacent layers need to 
be below 0.5 eV in order to reduce barriers for charge carriers that 
might accumulate at the interface. Therefore, for charge injection 
purposes hole transport materials are mainly selected by their 
HOMO values, while electron transport materials are selected with 
respect to their LUMO values. These are then arranged in a stepwise 
sequence to guide the charge carriers toward the emitter molecules 
in the EML. An example of a common material stack is given in 
Section 6.4.3.
Structure of an OLED

226
The Basics of Organic Light-Emitting Diodes
	
The four fundamental steps of light generation in an OLED are 
depicted in Fig. 6.6. First, charge carriers are generated. The holes 
(/electrons) are injected from the Fermi level of the anode (/cathode) 
into the HOMO (/LUMO) of the adjoining organic layer (1). Driven 
by the external electrical field and given the Coulomb attraction 
between oppositely charged carriers, electrons are moving toward 
the anode, while holes are moving toward the cathode through the 
respective transport layer (2). Both positive and negative charges 
meet and recombine in the EML forming excitons (3). The radiative 
decay of excitons results in photon emission (4). Some more details 
regarding the charge transport are addressed later.
Figure 6.6 Elemental processes during the operation of an OLED device. 
The basic steps are (1) injection of charge carriers into the organic materials; 
(2) transport of said charge carriers, which is driven by Coulomb interaction; (3) 
formation of excitons; and (4) emission of light.
	
Depending on the chemical structure of the molecule HOMO/
LUMO values can vary not only based on modifications to a given 
chemical core structure but can also be influenced by the arrangement 
of the molecules within the film and therefore also differ between 
individual molecules of the same chemical structure. This results in 
heterogeneous HOMO/LUMO distributions throughout the layers. 
The charge carriers consequently hop from the orbitals of one 
molecule to the other by a hopping mechanism, vide infra, as to be 
seen in Fig. 6.7. The parameter that describes how easily this can 

227
happen is called charge carrier mobility and is generally investigated 
in an amorphous film for OLED materials. HTL materials show high 
hole mobility, while ETL materials show high electron mobility. 
The charge transport in amorphous organic solids is not yet fully 
understood. In certain, rare cases, charge carriers may move more 
freely when strong π-stacking occurs, while most systems may be 
described more correctly using Marcus theory.
	
This so-called hopping model deconstructs the charge transport 
process into cascades of redox reactions. A schematic description 
of these processes is given in Fig. 6.7. Through the electrodes, 
radical cations and anions are generated by chemical oxidation and 
reduction. These cations and anions react with neighboring neutral 
molecules and exchange charge. This plethora of redox equilibria is 
influenced by the external electrical field, resulting in a net flux of 
charge carriers through the organic layers. A quantitative description 
of an elemental hopping process can be done with Marcus’s basic 
equation. Without going into too much detail, the conductivity of an 
organic molecule can be maximized by using a planar, rigid structure.

hopping of charge carriers between neighboring molecules. The driving force is 
the external electrical field.

The Basics of Organic Light-Emitting Diodes
6.2.3 Material Selection
Materials chosen to build up an OLED device must not only meet 
the physical requirements presented earlier but also chemical and 
process-related prerequisites.
6.2.3.1 Electrode materials
In most OLEDs, cathodes are made from more or less abundant 
metals such as magnesium, aluminum, barium, silver, or copper. 
When bulk films are used, the cathode is not transparent, whereas 
some degree of transparency may be regained when using nanowires, 
for example, made from silver.
	
Common anode materials are optically transparent and ought 
to have high conductivity. Because of this, transparent conductive 
oxides (TCOs) are commonly used. A well-established TCO is 
ITO, (In2O3)0.9(SnO2)0.1. It is deposited onto the substrate using a 
sputtering process. Generally, it is possible to purchase substrates 
like glass or PET foils that already carry a layer of ITO. This layer is 
characterized by its roughness and its conductivity (or resistivity), 
which corresponds to its thickness. Even though ITO is today one 
of the standard materials used in displays, the sheet conductivity 
is still quite low, especially for large-area applications like lighting. 
Therefore, many alternatives are being evaluated, like combinations 
with metallic grids, to reduce sheet resistivity over large areas.
	
While plastic substrates are becoming more important for 
applications with flexible/bendable devices, the rigid structure of 
ITO becomes an even bigger problem, even in combination with 
metallic grids that can compensate for the formation of islands upon 
fractures of ITO layers. A very popular alternative is graphene, which 
can form transparent layers with high conductivity, in principle. 
But due to the planar structure of graphene, it usually aligns flat 
on the substrate, resulting in high in-plane conductivity but low 
conductivity normal to the device plane. As processing generally 
affects the performance of organic materials to a very large extent, 
this issue might be overcome in the future.
	
A promising alternative for flexible anode structures is 
modifications of PEDOT:PSS, a water-soluble composite material 

229
made 
from 
conjugated 
polythiophene 
and 
deprotonated 
polystyrene sulfonic acid, which is an ionic mixed polymer with good 
conductivity and reasonable transparency (see Fig. 6.8). It has to be 
mentioned that many successful attempts have been made using 
special formulations of this material as the anode, with and without 
supportive metallic grids.

Figure 6.8 PEDOT:PSS is a mixture of a conjugated polythiophene and

On top of the aforementioned TCOs, injection layers are often 
employed, first to compensate for the high roughness of the oxides 
and second to reduce the barrier between the work function of the 
TCO and the HOMO energy of the subsequent layers. A popular 
material for this purpose is again PEDOT:PSS. Besides PEDOT:PSS, 
materials such as molybdenum oxide, vanadium oxide, or copper(I) 
salts may be used.
6.2.3.2 Charge transport materials
Most hole injection and hole transport materials consist of electron-
rich aromatic systems, that is, six-membered rings. Many variations 
of the structure, size, amount, and position of heteroatoms are 
possible and lead to a whole variety of energy levels, film-forming 
properties, and optical characteristics.
	
Apart from the molecular design, HTL materials can also be 
modified by doping during the deposition process. Similar to 
inorganics, this is possible during sublimation processes and already 
in commercial applications. Examples of hole-transporting materials 
are given in Fig. 6.9. Commonly, electron-rich aromatic systems such 
as triarylamine or carbazole derivatives are used.

Electron transport materials are characterized by low-lying 
LUMO values, making it easy to inject electrons into these orbitals. 
Furthermore, they are optimized for high electron mobilities. This is 
generally achieved with electron-poor aromatic systems, which are 
often five-membered heteroaromatics, for example, benzimidazoles, 

231
pyridine, and triazole, but also phosphinoxide and sulfones as 
functional groups (see Fig. 6.10).

6.2.3.3 Emitter materials
Emitters gather a broad range of materials based on various emission 
processes, such as fluorescence, phosphorescence, and TADF. These 
processes will be described in the following Section 6.3.
Structure of an OLED

232
The Basics of Organic Light-Emitting Diodes
6.3 Emitter Concepts
6.3.1 General Differences between the Different 
Concepts
One major advantage of OLEDs in comparison to LEDs is the 
possibility to tune the color of the emitter molecule by relatively easy 
chemical modification. Most of the material classes described in this 
section can be color-tuned across the visible spectrum, from blue 
to red. While the color-tuning ability is developed throughout these 
systems, their efficiency and suitability for commercial application 
vary to a large extent.
	
In comparison to the rather small amount of structural motifs 
that are found in the hole- and electron-transporting materials, 
the spectrum of compounds used as actual emitting materials is 
much broader. Various concepts are still under evaluation, ranging 
from fluorescent materials, which have been used in early OLEDs, 
to conjugated polymers, to phosphorescent materials (so-called 
triplet emitters), to nanoparticles. There are three main classes of 
emitter systems that vary in their emission process: fluorescence, 
phosphorescence, and TADF. To understand the differences, it is 
relevant to discuss excitons first. To do so, we cannot avoid a few 
lines of quantum mechanics.
	
Excitons are formed when two charges recombine (see Fig. 6.11). 
Electrons and holes have individual spins. Depending on the value 
of each spin, the resulting exciton can be either a singlet exciton 
or a triplet exciton, where the latter is lower in energy than the 
former. Due to spin statistics, roughly 25% of the excitons formed 
are singlets and roughly 75% are triplets. Once these excitons are 
formed on a molecule, this molecule is then excited into its singlet or 
triplet excited state. Only emitter molecules that can transform both 
kinds of excitons into light can be efficient emitters in OLEDs.
	
From the three classes described before, conventional fluorescent 
materials, such as aluminum quinolate, Alq3, or polymers such as 
polyfluorenes, can only make use of singlet excitons, thus limiting 
the theoretical electroluminescence quantum efficiency to 25%. In 
addition, the created triplet excitons, if not used for light emission, 
can lead to undesired reactions on the molecules or in between 
adjacent molecules, thus leading to material decomposition and 

233
not emissive charge traps. Fluorescent materials are currently 
being replaced in commercial products. While there are efficient 
solutions for red and green emitters, deep-blue materials are still 
fluorescent, caused by the lack of efficient and hence stable deep-
blue emitters. To harvest both singlet and triplet excitons for light 
emission, either phosphorescent emitters using iridium or platinum 
or emitters showing TADF are required. After the initial excitation 
via an exciton, they can switch from the singlet state to the triplet 
state (phosphorescence) or vice versa (TADF) via intersystem 
crossing (ISC) or reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), which allows 
them to make use of both exciton types. This ability can either be 
generated by introducing a heavy metal into the chemical structure 
or by careful sterical modifications on the molecular level.
Figure 6.11 Energy diagram representing different light emission mechanisms. 
Fluorescence, phosphorescence, and TADF processes are illustrated. S0, S1, and 
T1 designate the singlet ground state, the first singlet excited state, and the first 
triplet excited state, respectively. Exciton statistics in OLED devices and their 
emissive decay paths are also represented in the diagram.
	
Phosphorescent materials, currently state of the art, can convert 
singlet excitons into triplets and emit light from the triplet state. The 
absence of heavy atoms and therefore spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in 
fluorescent molecules have limiting consequences for the device 
efficiency because they prevent the use of triplet excitons. The 
earliest strategy to overcome this limitation led to the development 
Emitter Concepts

234
The Basics of Organic Light-Emitting Diodes
of phosphorescent metal-organic emitters. To overcome this issue, 
metal-organic compounds containing heavy metals such as iridium 
and platinum were investigated as a different class of emitter 
materials. These metal ions lead to a strong SOC, which leads to a 
change in the emission behavior, and these kinds of compounds 
are theoretically able to reach an internal efficiency of up to 100%. 
In these cases, a large SOC not only induces fast ISC from higher-
lying singlet states to the emitting triplet state but also leads to an 
emissive transition from the lowest triplet state to the singlet ground 
state, which is formally forbidden. Therefore, both singlet and triplet 
excitons can be used for the emission of light. Since all excitons 
are harvested via the excited triplet state, this emission, which is 
formally a phosphorescent emission, is called triplet harvesting.
	
The TADF concept, representing a younger material class in the 
focus of OLEDs, can convert triplet excitons into singlet excitons after 
thermal activation, as becomes clear from the name. Most of such 
materials have been demonstrated to be based on copper or can be 
purely organic. While processes for phosphorescent materials are 
part of commercial production already, TADF materials are being 
investigated by a growing community for their potential to find a 
stable deep-blue emitter. In addition, the absence of rare elements 
is relevant for large-scale manufacturing and the generation of new 
OLED applications.
	
The three previously described classes of emitter systems are 
limited by quantum mechanics and spin statistics. Fluorescent 
materials can reach a theoretical maximum efficiency of 25%, while 
the heavy atoms used in phosphorescent material permit the use of 
triplet harvesting through intersystem crossing. Yet, heavy metals 
are characterized by slow light emission which can lead to exciton 
quenching.
	
Therefore, there is a demand in research to investigate the next 
emitter generation. Here two new routes to efficient light emission 
are presented. A new generation is called “hot exciton” materials, 
which stand out by their capability of using high-lying excited triplet 
states in the light emission mechanism. This material can harvest 
nonradiative excitons from high-lying triplet states (Tn, n ≥ 2) to 
a singlet state via a fast RISC. Another promising new material, 
called doublet-spin radical emitters, has recently emerged. Doublet 
emitters have a theoretical internal quantum efficiency of 100% due 
to their unpaired electrons.

235
	
In the following section, a small selection of the three main 
classes of emitter systems will be presented, sorted by their emission 
principle: fluorescence, phosphorescence, and TADF.
6.3.2 Fluorescence
Representative examples of fluorescent molecules are given in 
Fig. 6.12. While the first OLEDs mainly contained known fluorescent 
dyes such as DCM, rubrene, or Alq3 derivatives, chemists and 
materials scientists soon developed new emitting compounds that 
were customized to their intended application in OLEDs, such as 
AlMq3 or DPVBi. Apart from aluminum, which is a very abundant 
element, these emitters contained no elements except for carbon, 
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur.

Emitter Concepts

236
The Basics of Organic Light-Emitting Diodes
	
Diverse kinds of small molecules as well as polymer-emitting 
compounds showing fluorescent emission have been investigated as 
potential emitting materials since the beginning of OLED research 
until now, even though these materials suffer from the fact that they 
can only use up to 25% of the total number of excitons generated in 
an OLED device. All triplet excitons are lost due to spin-forbidden 
emissive transitions, leading to radiation-less deactivation of excited 
triplet states since only the singlet excitons enable spin-allowed 
emissive transitions from excited singlet states to the singlet ground 
state.
6.3.3 Phosphorescence
While many heavy atoms, from osmium, rhenium, and ruthenium to 
lanthanides, have been tested, two metals have proven very suitable 
for OLED applications, platinum, and iridium (Fig. 6.13). Iridium is

considerably more relevant than platinum because of the somewhat 
easier realization of very high efficiencies and the shorter emission 
decay time. Although the first triplet-harvesting complex, PtOEP, 
gave a high efficiency of 4% in 1998, the first device with Irppy3 
easily surpassed this efficiency, yielding almost 8% efficiency and a 
reduced efficiency roll-off at high driving voltages due to the shorter 
emission decay time of most iridium complexes, in general.
6.3.4 Singlet Harvesting/TADF
In contrast to triplet-harvesting materials, materials exhibiting TADF 
are emitting from the singlet states, which is accordingly known as 
singlet harvesting. This process has already been described before 
and is another concept to allow efficient emission in OLEDs by 
including singlet and triplet excitons. Materials representing a 
small energy gap between the excited singlet state S1 and the triplet 
state T1 are mostly based on copper or purely organic core structures. 
Some representatives of this class of materials are shown in Fig. 6.14.

The Basics of Organic Light-Emitting Diodes
6.3.5 Host Materials
Due to charge transport reasons and to avoid quenching effects that 
can come up when many molecules in excited states are in close 
distance, the emitting materials are diluted in matrix materials, often 
with doping concentrations around 10 wt.-%. These host materials 
often share structural motifs with hole- and electron-transporting 
materials. So-called ambipolar host materials often contain both 
hole- and electron-transporting functional groups fused in one 
molecule.
	
Host materials have several functions, as already indicated 
before. Since both charge carriers recombine on host molecules 
within the EML, they need ideal mobilities for both electrons and 
holes in order to avoid charge accumulation at one of the interfaces 
(to the ETL or the HTL). Additionally, the exciton needs to quickly 
diffuse to an emitter molecule and not to any of the neighboring 
layers. Depending on the general stack architecture, materials with 
higher hole or electron mobilities can be favored. Hosts with similar 
mobilities for both charges are called ambipolar. An ambipolar 
host system can also be emulated by mixing hole- and electron-
transporting materials. This approach can lead to fine-tuned 
transport capabilities but adds a layer of complexity to the device, 
with a three-component mixture in the EML.
	
Once an exciton is formed, it also has to be efficiently transferred 
onto an emitter molecule; therefore efficient electronic coupling 
between both molecules is required. If that is not possible, the 
exciton can lead to light emission from the host molecule, which 
is generally not an efficient emitter, leading to efficiency losses. An 
efficient electronic coupling includes matching HOMO and LUMO 
values, that is, higher LUMO than the emitter and lower HOMO than 
the emitter, and matching excited-state energies.
6.4 OLED Manufacturing
6.4.1 Characterization
In this section, the electrical and optical characterization of OLED 
devices will be explained. Current-voltage characteristics, luminous 

239
efficiency, electroluminescence color, and lifetime are relevant 
performance indicators to monitor and characterize an OLED 
build-up.
	
Current-voltage characteristics are measured by applying a 
voltage ramp between the anode and the cathode. The current I 
through the device is measured and the current density j is calculated 
as follows:
	
j = I
A .
where j is calculated in mA◊cm–2, I is the current in mA and A is the 
active area in cm². The reverse voltage ramp can be applied in order 
to study the degree of hysteresis.
	
Luminous efficiency hL of an OLED device, in cd◊A–1, is the ratio of 
the amount of incident photon perceived by the human eye and the 
current density. It is calculated as follows:
	
hL = L
j .
where L is the luminance in cd∙m-2 and j is the current density in 
mA∙cm–2. The luminance is measured by a photodiode calibrated by 
a photometer. The photodiode is equipped with a V(l) filter, which 
represents the light sensitivity curve of the human eye within the 
photopic wavelength range.
	
In practice, the efficiency of an OLED device is commonly 
described by its EQE, hext. The EQE is the product of four factors and 
is calculated by the relationship:
 
hext = hf ◊ge–h ◊ cs/t ◊ fopt
hf is the exciton formation ratio, ge-h is the balance between the 
injected holes and electrons in the EML, cs/t is the exciton formation 
ratio (0.25 for fluorescence emitter, 1 for phosphorescence emitter), 
and fopt is the light outcoupling factor (estimated to ~20%). There is 
a more pragmatic approach to obtaining the EQE of an OLED device. 
It is commonly determined by the I–V–L characteristics and the 
electroluminescence spectrum of the device.
	
The color of the emitted light from the OLED device is 
characterized by its electroluminescence spectrum, the Commission 
Internationale de l’Éclairage (CIE) coordinates (x;y). Both for lighting 
and display applications, these coordinates are used to describe the 
OLED Manufacturing

240
The Basics of Organic Light-Emitting Diodes
white color temperature and the depth of color of RGB displays. These 
coordinates are calculated from the measured emission spectrum 
from a spectrometer.
	
The last property of the OLED device, and not the least, is 
the device’s lifetime. It is described by the time required for the 
luminance to decrease to a certain fraction of the initial luminance 
while the device is driven at a constant current. For example, LT80 is 
the time needed for the device to reach 80% of its initial luminance. 
Since the development of OLED materials led to devices achieving a 
lifetime of a few years, accelerated lifetime is usually utilized and is 
described as followed:
	
LT
LT

L
AF

where L0 is the initial high luminance, L is the extrapolated luminance 
at which the device lifetime needs to be determined, LTmeasured is the 
measured lifetime at L0, and AF is the acceleration factor that must 
be determined for each color.
6.4.2 OLED Device Processing
There are two main categories of material deposition processes 
when it comes to electroluminescent material: thermal vacuum 
evaporation and solution process. Small molecules can be deposited 
by either process, whereas polymers can only be processed from 
solution.
	
Physical vapor deposition (PVD) consists of the evaporation 
of pure material from crucibles under low pressure and high 
temperatures. PVD is one of the cleanest methods for material 
deposition, which is crucial to reach high performance and long 
lifetime of OLED displays. PVD is widely used to build OLED devices 
since its presentation by Tang and VanSlyke in 1987. Typically, under 
a pressure below 10–7 mbar, the organic material is sublimed at 
temperatures reaching 300°C, and the vapor condenses on a cooled 
substrate to form a film. The advantages of PVD are a controlled 
deposition process that results in a precise layer thickness at the 
nanometer scale and the possibility to build complex multilayer 
stacks with no interaction between the subsequent layers. However, 
PVD shows limitations regarding high resolution and large displays. 

241
Indeed, shadow masking is used to control the lateral deposition 
and technological and physical limitations are met to align the mask 
with the substrate for very fine patterning. The later technological 
developments of roll-to-roll thermal evaporation enabled to process 
panels of large sizes that used to be limited to the chamber size.
	
Solution processes include spin coatings and printing technologies, 
such as inkjet printing, screen printing, gravure, offset lithography, 
and flexography. Solution processes are highly cost-effective since 
materials are deposited only on the active area of the substrate. 
Another advantage of these processes is their compatibility with 
a roll-to-roll process on flexible substrates. Nonetheless, solution 
processes are facing challenges to build complex multilayer 
structures as each layer must be resistant to the solvent used to 
deposit the subsequent layer. Two strategies can be used, cross-
linking of the subjacent layer or using orthogonal solvents. A solvent 
is qualified as orthogonal when the solvent does not dissolve the 
subsequent layer during the time of exposure, which means until the 
solvent is evaporated.
6.4.3 Material Stack
In the application of RGB displays and white OLED, multiple stacks 
are being developed. Here, RGB display stacks will be discussed, as 
white OLED will be presented at the end of this chapter.
	
The simplest stack consists of pilling up the three different 
emitters onto each other, a green emitting layer, a red-emitting 
layer, and a blue emitting layer. Another similar build-up is called 
double units tandem OLED, where the red and green emitter layers 
are separated from the blue emitter layer by an intermediate 
connector. A more complex tandem build-up is possible by having 
all three emitter layers separated, it is named a triple units tandem 
OLED. Finally, patterning allows the structure of an RGB display to 
have all emitters deposited side by side. More explorative build-ups 
exist, such as a blue common layer and white OLED with filtering. To 
meet the CIE requirements, color tuning is required in all the above-
mentioned OLED stacks.
	
Hereafter is presented an example of a green OLED device that is 
processed from solution. The build-up is presented in Table 6.1.

processed device as well as for a blue emitting device and a white 
OLED, both also processed from solution, we would like to refer to 
the paper of Aizawa et al., mentioned in the Suggested Readings.
	
Performance records of OLED devices are regularly outclassed. 
Years of lifetime of commercial OLED devices are already reached for 
decades. OLED devices reaching an EQE that exceeded 50% thanks 
to external scattering and horizontally oriented emitters have 
already been reported (Song et. al., see Suggested Readings). TADF 
OLEDs have also surpassed the performance of traditional devices. 
In 2020 a TADF OLED achieving power efficacy beyond 100 lm◊W–1 
was presented (Kumar et al., see Suggested Readings).

243
6.5 Additional Aspects
In the following chapter, various aspects of OLED devices will be 
described, such as the choice of substrate, the impact of device 
encapsulation on performance, and the importance of light 
outcoupling to gain luminous efficiency.
6.5.1 Substrate
Substrates can be made from glass, PET, PIN, or others. The selection 
of the substrate depends on several criteria. In the first place, glass 
substrates can only be used for rigid, flat OLED applications. This is 
typically the case for current OLED displays (smartphones, tablets, 
TV) and lighting applications. For conformable applications, thin 
glass can still be used like all plastic-based substrates, but it cannot 
be employed for completely flexible applications.
	
Since plastic-based substrates are more rugged than glass-based 
ones, they are also employed in the first smartwatches, even without 
the requirement of a curved or flexible application in the final device.
	
Similarly, the production process has to be adapted to the 
substrate. Since flexible and even conformable substrates have to 
be rigid during the deposition process of the individual layers, they 
are often laminated onto another carrier substrate like glass and 
released from it after the production process. In contrast, a roll-to-
roll inline deposition process would be perfectly suited for a flexible 
rollable substrate without a carrier backbone. While such processes 
are still in the pilot production stages, the processing of flexible films 
on top of carrier substrates is already taking place on a medium 
scale.
6.5.2 Encapsulation
Most OLED materials are sensitive to moisture or oxygen. Cathode 
materials are generally highly reactive metals that strongly react 
with water and oxygen and result in device malfunction. Organic 
materials, on the other hand, can react with oxygen or water, not 
just when they are electrically excited, and lead to defect areas 
or enhanced device degradation. The stability of the device and 
materials versus undesired reactions is represented in the shelf life, 
Additional Aspects

244
The Basics of Organic Light-Emitting Diodes
while degradation during operation is represented in the operational 
device lifetime. In any case, with the aim of avoiding such negative 
effects, OLEDs are generally encapsulated for protection.
	
The classical concept is glass encapsulation on glass substrates. 
This is a rigid encapsulation that is glued on top of the substrate, with 
the glue applied around the active device area. Glass encapsulation 
is generally very long-lived and influenced strongly by the barrier 
properties of the glue. Since the encapsulation is performed under 
an inert atmosphere, changes in external pressure can lead to cracks 
in the glue and a consequent loss of barrier function. Major pressure 
changes like in-plane take-offs or landings can even lead to cracks in 
the glass substrates. Desiccant pads are often incorporated into the 
barrier glass in order to extend the device’s lifetime by absorbing 
diffusing water.
	
Alternatives are barrier films, which consist of a plastic-type 
substrate—mostly polyethylene terephthalate (PET)—and a sequence 
of alternating organic/inorganic layers to avoid diffusion. Some of 
these barriers can be flexible, but it has to be noted that bending can 
cause cracks in the inorganic layers and limit the barrier properties. 
In any case, these barriers are becoming the favorites because they 
are easy to apply, are lightweight, and can be made flexible.
6.5.3 Outcoupling
To maximize the light that leaves the device there are many 
optimization techniques available that can be divided into two 
groups, internal and external outcoupling.
	
Internal outcoupling techniques are all measures within the stack 
architecture that maximize the outcoupled light. A very popular 
technique is the optical fine-tuning of charge transport layers. This 
means the thickness variation of layers in order to generate a cavity 
between the electrodes for constructive interference of the desired 
wavelength, that is, the emission wavelength of the dopant. Such 
variations can lead to trade-offs in electrical performance; therefore 
there is generally a compromise in optical and electrical properties 
of the device.
	
Furthermore, internal outcoupling can include additional layers 
within the OLED stack that enhance outcoupling. These layers can 
be materials that participate in charge transport but can scatter 

245
the emitted light at the same time. This is generally achieved by 
materials that tend to crystallize and generate grain boundaries 
within the layers. Achieving this without negatively affecting the 
device performance is not straightforward; therefore external 
outcoupling techniques are more popular, in general.
	
External outcoupling techniques involve all measures that 
can be applied on the outside of the encapsulated device. Due to 
the difference of refractive indices (h) between the substrate or 
encapsulation of the device and the surrounding air, a large fraction 
of light cannot leave the device through the emission plane but leaves 
the device on the edges or is completely lost in so-called waveguide 
modes. To adjust for this problem, there are plastic films that can 
be laminated on top of the device and support the outcoupling due 
to refractive index matching and a special surface structure. A very 
common representative is the microlens array structure (MLA). 
Films with variations of this structure are very common, especially 
in lighting applications since they can also act as diffusers to 
homogenize the light impression on larger OLED panels. This 
function can also be used to hide conductive structures like metal 
grids that are used in large-area OLED panels.
6.5.4 Applications
From television to smartphone passing by lights, OLED devices are 
flooding the market with new technologies. Besides the aspects of 
displays and lightning presented in this section, we would like to 
refer to Chapter 15 for further insights.
6.5.4.1 Display panels
The low power consumption and the high resolution of OLED displays 
made this technology a reference in the smartphone business. These 
high-quality displays are also present in cameras, MP3 players, and 
tablets. Recently, new developments have made foldable screens in 
smartphones possible, such as the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold.
	
Larger OLED displays found their application in computer 
screens and televisions that can be flat or curved and also in flexible 
wallpaper. In 2021, LG presented the first rollable TV, LG Signature 
OLED TV R, and in the same year, Xiaomi introduced the first 
transparent TV, Mi TV Lux Transparent Edition.
Additional Aspects

246
The Basics of Organic Light-Emitting Diodes
	
Finally, OLED displays are present in the wearable market with 
smartwatches and microdisplays for virtual virtuality. For this 
application, OLED outperforms LCD technology due to its higher 
contrast and faster response time. Market specialists indicate OLED 
microdisplays will keep growing in the upcoming year, as it is already 
present in many VR glasses but also the military and defense sector.
6.5.4.2 White light generation
The introduction of OLED as a lighting element opened the field 
of possibilities to lighting designers. From there emerged flexible, 
transparent, and color-tuneable light panels that emit diffused light.
Figure 6.15 CIE diagram with the black-body curve indicated.
	
To generate white light from OLEDs with different colors, 
there are several concepts. Since white light is composed of 

247
several individual colors, as represented in the CIE diagram below 
(Fig. 6.15), one can either use two or three colors to create white 
light. The quality of the light can be described by the color point CIE x 
and CIE y and the color-rendering index (CRI). These parameters are 
mainly affected by the shape of the emission spectrum of the emitting 
compound. The CIE coordinates describe the color composition, 
that is, the relative intensities of the included colors, while the CRI 
describes the impression of colors when illuminated by the given 
light source. The lower the CRI, the worse the color impression, 
as shown in Fig. 6.15. Instead of using the CIE coordinates, it is 
common in the lighting industry to use the color temperature. It is 
represented by the black-body curve and has higher values toward 
the blue side of the CIE diagram. While 2000 K represents a warm 
light impression, 6000 K is a value for cold blueish light, like known 
from fluorescent tubes.
	
The modification of the CRI is also crucial for nice color 
perception. It is desirable to have a very broad emission spectrum to 
have a high CRI. Therefore, a three-component white OLED (WOLED) 
is often superior to two-component WOLEDs.
	
The stack design of WOLEDs is a very important topic because 
it has to take into account the aforementioned points while 
maximizing the device efficiency to reduce the cost per light output. 
Consequently, WOLEDs mostly consist of so-called tandem devices, 
where two or three OLEDs are directly stacked on top of each other 
and then connected to an external circuit. This maximizes the device 
efficiency but makes the production more complex because tens 
of layers have to be deposited on top of each other with perfect 
alignment and no defects. In between such stacked OLEDs, charge 
generation layers (CGLs) are used to generate holes for one diode 
and electrons for the other one.
	
Process stability during device production is crucial because 
small variations in layer thicknesses or morphology can cause color 
shifts between different devices. The human eye is very sensitive 
and can spot such variations quickly in OLED assemblies, which are 
very common when creating large OLED luminaires.

The latest advances in materials development have re-inspired 
interest in organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology, which recently 
achieved a new power conversion efficiency (PCE) record of over 
18% (Cui et al., 2021). At the same time, the last 13 years have seen 
the boom of metal halide perovskite (MHP) semiconductors due 
to their exciting performance as light-harvesting layers in solar 
cells (PCE has nearly reached 26%), giving rise to unprecedented 
attention from both the academic and industrial photovoltaic 
community.

transparency properties. Their low-cost and earth-abundant 
constituents can be processed through versatile and cost-effective 
solution–based processing, which enables their printing on a variety 
of substrates, including flexible and stretchable ones, or even their 
integration into wearable fabrics.
	
In 2000 the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to A. Heeger, 
A. Macdiarmid, and H. Shirakawa, for “the discovery and development 
of conductive polymers,” bringing a fundamental contribution to the 
field of organic semiconductors. The first functional OPV devices 
were developed by CW Tang in 1986 (Tang, 1986) with a bilayer 
structure using two separate layers, each with electron donor or 
electron acceptor functionality. Since the beginning, the limitations 
of bilayer structures due to strong charge recombination were 
understood and, in the early 1990s, the device structures were 
improved with the introduction of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) 
concept. In this kind of structure, the donor and acceptor material 
are mixed in a unique formulation and coated in a single active layer 
(AL), increasing the performance, and simplifying cell fabrication.
	
Over the last few decades, there has been a notable evolution 
in organic chemistry and as well in materials used in OPV. Donor 
polymers with a wide-bandgap used in the first years of research, 
such as PPV and P3HT were gradually replaced by much more 
complex structures classified as low bandgap, such as PBDTTT-
EFT (PCE10) and PM6, which have considerably increased the 
device voltage and carrier mobility. On the side of acceptors, soluble 
fullerenes (FA), such as PCBM and its derivatives, have been used for 
many years, with the sole function of electron transport. However, 
the development of small molecules classified as non-fullerene 
acceptors (NFA), such as O-IDTBR and Y6, has broadened the role 
of acceptors by contributing to the light absorption in the visible 
spectrum, leading to the highest efficiencies ever reached by OPVs.
	
Despite the recent progress in the research field, commercial-
level OPV panels are still underperforming, with efficiencies of 
around 5–7%. This delay compared to laboratory cells is due to the 
difficulty in reproducing the structure over large areas, as well as the 
costs of the new materials. Another concern for commercialization 
is the stability of OPVs, which has attracted more attention in recent 
years, being the key factor limiting the industrialization of this 
technology. Thus, while earlier research had previously focused only 

253
Organic and Perovskite Solar Cells
on the development of new materials and record efficiencies, there 
is now also more attention toward the study of stability, in search for 
solutions to place OPVs definitively on the market.
	
As for perovskites, the last 13 years have seen a boom in MHPs. 
The exciting performance of this family of semiconductors as light-
harvesting layers in solar cells has given rise to unprecedented 
attention from both the academic and industrial photovoltaic 
communities. The low-cost and earth-abundant constituents, 
together with the versatile and cost-effective solution-based 
processing, are the key advantages of PSC that, similarly to OPV, 
can be printed on a variety of substrates, including flexible and 
stretchable ones, or even integrated into wearable fabrics.
	
The first perovskite compound was identified in a chlorite-rich 
skarn mineral made of calcium titanate (CaTiO3) discovered by Gustav 
Rose in 1839 and, later, named after the Russian mineralogist Lev A. 
Perovski. Since then, the term perovskite has been applied to a large 
family of synthetic materials exhibiting a wide variety of properties 
(from insulating to semiconducting, metallic, superconducting, 
ferromagnetic, and more). All perovskites share the same crystal 
structure as the naturally occurring CaTiO3 mineral with an ABX3 or 
equivalent stoichiometry. Traditionally, the most popular perovskites 
are inorganic metal oxides with ABO3 composition. Yet, the halide 
counterparts, with heavy halogen ions at the X-site of the ABX3 
structure, are currently more popular because of their outstanding 
performance as light absorbers for solar cells. Despite MHPs being 
old materials—the first MHP compounds based on cesium, lead, and 
halides were synthesized from aqueous solutions already in 1892—
it is only in 2009 that they were adopted in solar cells for the first 
time in the groundbreaking work by Miyasaka and co-workers.
	
To date, various inorganic or hybrid (organic-inorganic) 
compositions of MHPs have been developed, spanning a wide range 
of bandgaps (400‒800 nm). The most common element at the B-site 
is certainly lead (Pb) as a 2+ cation (Pb2+), though its toxicity urges 
researchers to find eco-friendly alternatives to it. Tin (Sn), being 
isoelectronic to Pb, is its most promising replacement when targeting 
high-performance devices. Nevertheless, Sn2+ rapidly oxidizes to 
Sn4+ when exposed to air. Hence, it is necessary to design intrinsically 
stable Pb-free perovskites or perovskite-inspired materials with 
good optoelectronic properties for practical applications. Indeed, 

254
Organic and Perovskite Solar Cells
stability is one of the main roadblocks to the commercialization of 
MHPs. The lifetime of PSC is only a fraction of that of established 
silicon solar cells even for Pb-based devices.
	
Despite the many challenges to be still addressed, there is 
considerable enthusiasm around MHP semiconductors. Following the 
skyrocketing success of solar cells, other optoelectronic applications, 
such as light-emitting diodes, lasers, and photodetectors, are also 
being intensively considered. In the following sections, the materials 
chemistry of MHPs,
	
This chapter addresses state-of-the-art core technologies 
related to OPVs and PSCs. Sections 7.1–7.7 are related to OPVs 
(basic principles, device architectures, tandem solar cells, materials, 
manufacturing, device stability, and OPV applications), the following 
7.8–7.11 sections focus on perovskite-based technology (chemistry 
of halide perovskites, optoelectronic properties, major applications 
in solar cells, and beyond). Finally, a summary and a prospect of the 
main challenges of OPV and PSC technologies and future perspectives 
are provided in Section 7.12.
7.1 Basic Principles of Organic Solar Cells
In OPVs, the absorbing layer is an organic material, usually a polymer 
or a small molecule, with semiconductor characteristics. A polymer 
can present semiconducting behavior if it contains alternated 
single and double bonds in its backbone. In this case, it is called a 
conjugated polymer.
	
In a conjugated structure, the electrons are delocalized along the 
polymer length and have higher energy than others in the structure, 
being equivalent to valence electrons in inorganic materials. These 
electrons are part of what is called the highest-occupied molecular 
orbital (HOMO). The equivalent to the conduction band of inorganic 
materials is the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The 
energy difference between those two orbitals is called the band gap 
of the material.
	
When an electron in the HOMO level receives energy higher than 
the band gap, it is excited to the LUMO level, leaving behind a positive 
charge (hole). This is the basic phenomenon underlying the working 
principle of a solar cell. These opposite negative and positive charges 

255
Basic Principles of Organic Solar Cells
are attracted to each other, forming an electron-hole pair or exciton, 
which needs to be separated through a process called exciton 
dissociation. In inorganic materials, the exciton binding energy is 
small, and the charges can be separated by thermal energy at room 
temperature. In organic materials, however, the binding energy is 
higher but can be overcome by combining two materials with an 
offset between their HOMO and LUMO levels. These two materials 
form the AL of the solar cell and are called donors if it donates an 
electron, or acceptor if it receives the electron. The absorption of 
light usually happens in the donor material. The exciton is then 
formed and moves toward the interface with the acceptor, where it 
dissociates. The electron reaches the acceptor material, which has 
lower HOMO and LUMO levels, while the hole is left in the donor. 
These steps are summarized in Fig. 7.1.
Figure 7.1 Energy levels in the AL and photon-to-electron conversion in an 
organic solar cell device: (1) absorption of incident light in the donor material, 
(2) exciton generation, (3) diffusion of the exciton toward the donor–acceptor 
interface, (4) exciton dissociation and formation of free charges, (5) transport of 
charges to respective electrodes, (6) charge extraction.
	
To reach high-performance solar cells, each one of those steps 
must be considered carefully. Steps 2 to 4 are dependent on the 
AL and the way the donor and acceptor are arranged in this layer 
determines the efficiency of these processes. The diffusion length of 
excitons depends on the material and is around several nanometers 
(Sajjad, Ruseckas, and Samuel, 2020). Thus, the distance between 
donor and acceptor molecules must be as small as possible (<5–
10 nm) to allow the exciton dissociation. On the other hand, each 
material should have a continuous percolation pathway (molecules 

256
Organic and Perovskite Solar Cells
of the same kind) to its respective electrode to allow charge 
transport. Figure 7.2 presents different possible structures for 
the AL.
Figure 7.2 Four different morphologies for the AL: (a) fine dispersion of the 
two materials, (b) bilayer, (c) ideal morphology, and (d) BHJ.
	
A finely dispersed mixture of the materials (Fig. 7.2a), offers 
good interface area and thus good charge generation. However, the 
charge transport to the electrode is inefficient as charges generated 
in the middle of the layer cannot reach the electrodes. The bilayer 
morphology (Fig. 7.2b), on the contrary, enables excellent charge 
transport as both donor and acceptor materials are connected to 
their respective electrode. However, only excitons generated close 
to the interface can be split into free charges, while others will 
recombine, leading to low charge generation. The theoretically ideal 
morphology (Fig. 7.2c), determined by the Monte Carlo method (Ray 
and Alam, 2012), consists of small distances between donor and 
acceptor and continuous pathways for charge extraction. Ideally, this 
allows good dissociation of excitons, as well as good diffusion and 
extraction of all the generated free charges. This perfect structure 
is hard to achieve, and the patterning of the materials must be 
nanometric. Nowadays, the best morphology is the BHJ, presented 
by Yu et al. (1995) (Fig. 7.2d). In this structure, donor and acceptor 
materials are blended into a solution that is coated to form the AL, 
and phase structures of the materials are formed randomly in the 
nanoscale. The BHJ structure is considered to be the closest to the 
ideal one, but this random morphology can still present defects, such 
as isolated islands.
	
In addition to morphology, the choice of materials that make 
up the OPV cell is also important since all processes depend on 

257
Solar Cell Architecture
their energy levels. Exciton generation, for example, happens when 
photons with energy higher than the band gap are absorbed. Thus, 
maximizing the exciton generation is possible by matching the donor 
energy band gap to the solar spectrum.
	
Once excited, the donor molecules need to transfer the charge 
to the acceptor, which is possible by breaking the Coulomb bond in 
the electron–hole pair. This binding force is estimated to be 0.4−0.5 
eV. Only a downhill energetic driving force exceeding this binding 
energy will lead to free charges. Thus, the separation of charges also 
depends on the energy levels of AL materials. In fact, for the exciton 
splitting and free charges generation to happen, the difference 
between the LUMOs of the donor and of the acceptor must be at 
least 0.3 eV (Koster, Shaheen, and Hummelen, 2012). Increasing 
this energy difference does not lead to enhanced performances, 
but rather to power loss; thus, the energy difference should be 
minimized.
	
The matching with the solar spectrum and the requirement of 
the precise energy difference between donor and acceptor gives the 
first insights for the choice of materials. Additionally, the energy gap 
is directly linked to the output voltage of the cell. The higher the 
energy gap, the higher the voltage, but also the smaller the overlap 
with the solar spectrum.
7.2 Solar Cell Architecture
7.2.1 Homojunction and Heterojunction
The design and architecture of a solar cell device mainly consist 
in finding the optimal balance between a device with an optimal 
absorption density and electrically thin layers to minimize charge 
recombination.
Figure 7.3 Different structures of an organic solar cell: (a) single layer 
homojunction, (b) bilayer, and (c) BHJ.

258
Organic and Perovskite Solar Cells
	
The simplest structure of an organic solar cell is the 
homojunction, based on a single conjugated organic semiconductor 
layer sandwiched between two electrodes with different working 
functions (Fig. 7.3a). The performance of this type of device is very 
poor due to the lack of energy to dissociate the excitons that are 
not in the interface between the organic semiconductor and the 
electrode, thus drastically decreasing the efficiency.
	
An evolution of this structure is the bilayer architecture, composed 
of two different layers—donor (D) and acceptor (A)—on top of each 
other and in between the conductive electrodes (Fig. 7.3b). The 
donor and acceptor materials have differences in electron affinity 
and ionization potential and their stacking generates electrostatic 
forces at the interface. These materials should be chosen in a way 
to maximize these differences, so the local electric fields are strong 
enough to break the excitons, in a more efficient way than the single-
layer structure. The diffusion length of excitons in organic electronic 
materials is typically on the order of 10 nm. In order for most excitons 
to diffuse to the interface and break into carriers, the layer thickness 
should also be in the same range as the diffusion length. However, 
typically a polymer layer requires a thickness of at least 100 nm to 
absorb enough light. At such a large thickness, only a small fraction 
of the excitons can reach the heterojunction interface.
	
To address this problem, a new type of heterojunction 
photovoltaic cells was designed, the BHJ solar cells (Fig. 7.3c). In this 
OPV structure, donor and acceptor materials are mixed, forming a 
polymer blend, as explained in the previous section. If the length 
scale of the blend is similar to the exciton diffusion length, most of 
the excitons generated in either material may reach the interface, 
where excitons can break efficiently. Electrons move to the acceptor 
domains and then are carried through the device and collected by 
one electrode, while holes are pulled in the opposite direction and 
collected at the opposite side, as demonstrated in Fig. 7.4. Important 
factors in this structure are charge transport and mobility, which are 
affected by the presence of impurities. Also, the exciton diffusion 
length, charge separation, and charge collection should be taken into 
account. Moreover, the stability of the device against oxidation and 
reduction, recrystallization, and temperature variations should also 
be considered.

259
Figure 7.4 Schematic of a polymer–fullerene BHJ layer. (a) Absorption of a 
photon from the donor and strongly bounded exciton formation and (b) exciton 
split at the donor–acceptor interface and transport of the charges to the 
corresponding electrodes.
	
The use of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) is not without 
drawbacks, as efficient charge collection can be difficult and 
requires precise control of the nanoscale morphology. Photocurrent 
generation requires uniform and dense blending of the two different 
materials on the scale of the exciton diffusion length (5–10  nm), 
while charge-carrier transport requires continuous donor and 
acceptor pathways from the interfaces to the electrodes. However, 
a too-highly mixed system will result in increased bimolecular and 
geminate recombination (Clarke and Durrant, 2010).
	
Noteworthy is that in BHJs there is a strong need for blocking 
contacts (Fig. 7.4). Since the electrode is in contact with both the 
donor and acceptor material, due to the 3D-blend nature of BHJ, 
electrodes should also work as selective membranes for the respective 
charge carriers. When donors are in contact with the transparent 
conductive oxide (TCO) and acceptors in contact with the metallic 
electrode, charge carriers can easily leave the BHJ, but when donors 
are in contact with the top electrode and the acceptors with TCO, 
a barrier potential is formed at each interface, which impedes any 
leakage current. Typical TCO materials are indium tin oxide (ITO), 
fluorine tin oxide (FTO), and indium zinc oxide (IZO). However, it is 
also possible to find flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-based 
substrates and multilayer structures such as ITO/Metal/ITO (IMI). 
In this case, the ITO thickness is lower, which can reduce the cost 
of the substrate, compared to the pure ITO layer, but also provide 
higher flexibility without loss of sheet resistance and maintaining 
good transparency (>80%).
Solar Cell Architecture

Organic and Perovskite Solar Cells
7.2.2 Regular and Inverted Structure
OPVs devices can be fabricated based on two types of architectures, 
depending on the charge collection direction: the regular structure 
and the inverted structure (Fig. 7.5). These two basic architectures 
can be further developed to construct a tandem device or 
semitransparent OPVs.
Figure 7.5 Device structures: (a) regular and (b) inverted structure. The 
regular structure commonly uses low work-function metals as the top contact, 
whereas high work-function metals are used in inverted structures. The arrows 
indicate the electron (e–) and hole (h+) transport direction.
	
Most of the earlier work on OPVs was based on the regular 
structure. However, it presented many challenges related to the 
stability of the devices, mostly due to the use of aluminum (Al) as a 
top electrode, which could easily oxidize. By inverting the structure, 
and reversing the direction of the charge collection, it was possible 
to use materials with high work function as top electrodes, such as 
gold (Au) and silver (Ag) which are noble metals and less prone to 
corrosion. Additionally, these metals could also be deposited by less 
energy intense methods, using non-vacuuming techniques such as 
screen printing, reducing fabrication complexity and costs.
7.2.3 Tandem OPV
As calculated by Shockley and Queisser (1961), the photovoltaic 
conversion efficiency of an ideal single junction solar cell at Tc = 0 K 
is only about 40% (SQ-limit). This limitation mainly derives from 
two basic phenomena: firstly, only photons with energy En greater 
than the bandgap Eg of the photoactive material can be absorbed and 

261
can take part in the photovoltaic effect; secondly, there is an energy 
loss due to a thermalization effect. A possible solution to overcome 
these effects is stacking different devices on top of each other, in the 
so-called “tandem” structure.
	
Organic solar cells in the tandem configuration are based on the 
monolithical connection of two solar cells stacked on top of each 
other, each one based on a different donor–acceptor blend. This 
broadens the overall device absorption spectrum by using photon 
energy more efficiently and reducing the absorption loss compared 
to a single junction configuration. The top cell, normally with a 
lower bandgap semiconductor, absorbs the part of the spectrum not 
absorbed by the first one. A general overview of a tandem device is 
reported in Fig. 7.6.
	
Another fundamental factor for the correct functioning of a 
tandem device is the intermediate or interconnection layer (IL), 
placed between the two sub-cells. This layer must satisfy specific 
electrical and electronic requirements of the device, as well as have 
optical properties compatible with the upper sub-cell. The IL has 
to ensure the alignment of the quasi-Fermi level of the bottom cell 
acceptor with the quasi-Fermi level of the top cell donor. If the IL is 
not designed for this correct alignment, the recombination of holes 
and electrons coming from each of the sub-cells can occur.
	
Compared to single junction cells, tandem cells have some 
limitations regarding the selection of photoactive materials, as 
sub-cells have to complement the spectral absorption of each other 
while ensuring the lowest energy loss to obtain a higher Voc. Since 
the absorption spectra of the sub-cells and the distribution of light 
across the entire tandem cell have a major impact on the current, 
optical control is also of fundamental importance for tandem OPV 
cells.
	
In the past years, considerable efforts have been dedicated to the 
optimization of the photoactive layers (PALs) and the IL. With the 
recent use of NFA-based structures, a 20% (Wang et al., 2021; Zheng 
et al., 2021) performance record was achieved for organic tandem 
cells, using a layer of TiO2, deposited by electron beam evaporation, 
in combination with PEDOT:PSS as IL. However, despite the potential 
of high efficiency, OPV tandem structures are not currently used or 
taken into consideration for large-scale production. The reasons 
behind this are mostly related to the high production costs, which 
Solar Cell Architecture

Organic and Perovskite Solar Cells

263
are not yet followed by a longer lifetime. The need to deposit more 
layers (up to 7) compared to the single junction (up to 3), plus the 
upper contact, can compromise the production yield, increasing even 
more the production costs, therefore the price of the final product.
7.3 Materials of Organic Solar Cells
7.3.1 Interfacial and Intermediate Layers
In addition to the PAL, composed by a donor and an acceptor, the 
OPV structure requires materials suitable for the transport of the 
generated charges. These materials are called the hole-transport 
layer (HTL) and electron-transport layer (ETL), depending on the 
charges transported/blocked.
	
The interlayer materials play an important role in determining the 
efficiency and stability of an OPV cell. They are directly responsible 
for creating an ohmic contact, determining the internal electric 
field of the cell, the morphology of the film, and the charge-carrier 
recombination rate, all important factors for the performance of the 
device. An ohmic contact reduces the energy barrier for efficient 
charge extraction at the metal/organic interface, in addition to 
maximizing the Voc with optimum built-in potential. For devices with 
ohmic contacts, Voc is defined as the difference between the LUMO of 
the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor (Mihailetchi et al., 2003). 
The OPV built-in electric field affects the charge extraction efficiency 
and can be optimized by modifying the electrode work function using 
the interlayers. Reducing the built-in potential reduces the intensity 
of the electric field, resulting in an increase of charge recombination 
as well as a reduction in Voc, Jsc, fill factor (FF), and device efficiency.
	
To achieve high efficiency, the interlayer solution must meet 
several characteristics and requirements: (i) It must establish an 
ohmic contact and have a correct energy level alignment with the 
photoactive layer for efficient transport and electron collection; 
(ii) It should function as an effective hole/electron blocking layer 
to overcome the possibility of electron-hole recombination and 
selective cathode/anode electron extraction; (iii) For inverted OPVs, 
the ETL should be highly transparent so that light can reach the PAL 
and enhance the photogenerated exciton; (iv) It should be physically

and chemically stable as well as having sufficient conductivity to 
minimize resistive losses; (v) Finally, it should be processed and 
form a film at relatively low temperature. In general, it is very 
difficult to find a single material with all these characteristics and a 
possible solution is to combine characteristics of different materials 
creating composites or hybrids deposited in a single film. Interesting 
examples are ZnO:PEIE, ZnO:PFN-Br, and ZnO:self-assembling 
monolayers (SAM).
7.3.1.1 Organic layers
Small molecules and solution-processable polymers are commonly 
used as interlayers due to their ease of manufacture and compatibility 
with the BHJ layer. The possibility of modifying the structure of 
the organic material or the ability to form SAMs are interesting 
characteristics of both small molecules and polymers. The organic 
interlayers can create a direct interface dipole between the cathode 
and the BHJ layer, thereby effectively reducing the working function 
of the electrode and improving the potential embedded within the 
device (Ahmad et al., 2021).
	
The most common organic material used in OPV as a charge-
transport layer is a poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene 
sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). It is a macromolecular salt composed of a 
mixture of two ionomers with high conductivity (Fig. 7.7). Initially, 
PEDOT:PSS was used in the regular structure as the first layer (ETL), 
deposited directly on top of the TCO. However, it was found that the 
stability and the lifetime of the devices were strongly compromised 
by the use of PEDOT:PSS as the first interlayer. One of the reasons 
for this instability is the acidity of PEDOT:PSS, which leads to the 
etching of the TCO under moisture, strongly increased by its high 
hygroscopic nature (Grossiord et al., 2012). In the inverted structure, 
PEDOT:PSS is coated on top of the BHJ with the function of HTL and 
the stability is significantly increased.
	
The structure of PEDOT:PSS can be easily modified to change 
its conductivity, morphology, and wetting behavior by adopting 
different strategies, such as changing the ratio of the components, 
adding surfactants, cross-linkers, or solvent formulations. The 
addition of surfactants can give PEDOT:PSS properties of extraction 
of positive charges with thicknesses normally not exceeding 60 nm. 
By adding cross-linkers, in addition to the surfactants, higher 

265
conductivity can be achieved, allowing HTL layers with thicknesses 
above 400 nm. This is an important feature for the use of screen-
printing techniques for the top electrode deposition since a thick 
HTL can protect the layers underneath from mechanical stress. 
Additionally, light transmission of 85% and sheet resistances in the 
range of 50–100 Ω/sq are also possible by these modifications.

PSS

poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS).
	
Another highly conductive polymer used in electronics in the past 
was polyaniline (PANI). The high conductivity is reached by protonic 
doping of PANI and its solution-processed layer shows values around 
10–200 S/cm. PANI offers reasonable ambient stability properties, 
is a nonacid, and can be processed as a solution. It can be used as 
an interlayer, but nowadays this material is mostly used as an anti-
corrosion layer.
	
Small molecular materials such as bathophenanthroline (BPhen) 
(Xiao et al., 2013) and bathocuproine (BCP) (Castro-Hermosa et al., 
2021; Liu et al., 2021) are also used as ETL or as a hole-blocking 
layer (HBL). Other typical polymeric materials used as ETL are 
polyethylenimine (PEI) and ethoxylated polyethylenimine (PEIE) 
and its derivatives. Such polymers can be used as a single layer 
or in composition with metal oxides such as zinc oxide, either as 
sol–gel or nanoparticles (Kaçar et al., 2017; Anefnaf et al., 2021). 
The peculiarity of these ETLs is the need to obtain very thin-film 
thicknesses (<10 nm) to have a charge transport effect (Courtright 
and Jenekhe, 2015; Zhang et al., 2015).
	
Another category of materials used as interlayers is the SAM. 
These molecules have intrinsic dipoles, which are adsorbed on metals 
forming a highly ordered 2D layer. Depending on the direction of the 
Materials of Organic Solar Cells

266
Organic and Perovskite Solar Cells
dipole at the electrode interface, the work function can be increased 
or decreased (Hu et al., 2022). SAMs can also change the wettability 
of the surface, affecting the film morphology, which determines the 
charge separation efficiency and the charge transport properties.
7.3.1.2 Metal oxides
Transition metal oxides have been widely used in OPVs as interlayers. 
They are highly stable in the air, have great optical transparency, 
and have easy synthesis. The choice of metal oxide depends on the 
energy levels of conduction and valence bands and their alignment 
with the energy bands of the rest of the cell. Oxides such as V2O5, 
MoO3, WO3, and NiO have been used as HTL as an alternative to 
PEDOT:PSS. The best examples of oxides used as ETL are TiO2, SnO2, 
and ZnO. SnO2 and ZnO are of particular interest since they are 
solution processable and stable in ambient conditions. In addition, 
they have high optical transparency, less dependence on thickness 
and annealing temperature, good conductivity, and are non-toxic. 
On the other hand, they can present surface defects, decomposition 
under UV illumination, and may induce photodegradation.
	
The most commonly ETL used in OPV is ZnO due to its low working 
function (≈4.30 or 4.40 eV), high transparency in visible light, 
superior conductivity and stability, low-cost and simple preparation 
method, as a highly processable solution (Huang, Yin, and Zheng, 
2011; Jiang et al., 2018). Previous studies have shown that device 
performance can change according to the processing conditions, so 
control of ZnO properties is critical for efficient OPVs (Polyzoidis et 
al., 2016). The most used form of ZnO is nanoparticles (NP) and sol–
gel, which result in uniform and functional films with thicknesses 
around 30–50 nm. As the sol-gel method requires a relatively high 
annealing temperature, NP ZnOs are used as interlayers as an 
alternative strategy to achieve high-performing devices.
	
Tin oxide (SnO2) is another metal oxide with a wide band gap that 
offers efficient charge transport and greater intrinsic mobility than 
other n-type metal oxides. The inverted device with SnO2 as an ETL 
showed a PCE comparable to the ones based on TiO2 and significantly 
superior stability to heat and humidity without encapsulation, as 
well as decent stability even under light-soaking (Trost et al., 2015). 
It has been shown (Bob et al., 2013) that the use of SnO2 in inverted 
OPV improves the performance due to the formation of a smooth 

267
film, small particle size, and better electron-transport properties. 
However, the existence of relatively large particles and defects 
in the SnO2 suspension can limit its application. In recent years, 
alternatives have been developed with organic functionality that 
partially reduces these defects. Nowadays, it is possible to find in the 
market particles of smaller size (<20 nm) with a spherical shape.
7.3.2 Photoactive Materials
In organic solar cells, the PAL consists of a mixture of an electron 
donor (p-type) and an electron acceptor (n-type) material. The 
donor material (D) is usually formed by a conjugated polymer, while 
acceptors are usually a soluble fullerene derivative (FA) or a soluble 
small molecule, also known as NFAs.
	
The most common PALs have a binary structure D:A. Fullerene 
binary systems, combining D and acceptor FA, can reach efficiencies 
up to 12%, but with some known stability issues, such as dimerization 
of the fullerene caused by light exposure (Distler et al., 2014). Other 
binary systems have been developed based on conjugated small 
molecules (Zhou et al., 2019), reaching the highest efficiencies ever 
recorded, over 18% (Cui et al., 2021). This increase in performance 
is mainly due to the additional light absorption by the NFA, which 
combined with the donor, results in a wider light visible spectrum 
absorption and increased charge photogeneration. Despite the high 
efficiencies, these systems still lack stability.
	
Figure 7.8 summarizes the OPV development over the past 
20 years. During this period, three phases of development can be 
distinguished. Initially, simpler chemical structures were used, 
P3HT:PCBM being the main blend studied. During this period, 
a lot of focus was put on the dynamics of the materials that make 
up the PAL, with studies on the influence of solvents, temperature, 
or additives on morphology. In the second phase, following the 
advances in organic chemistry, more complex and functional donor 
structures have been developed, with improved spectral absorption, 
charge transport, and a greater capacity for molecular aggregation. 
This resulted in improved performance of the devices, close to 12%. 
In the last years, the focus of the development has been on the 
acceptor side, based on small molecule NFAs and combinations of 
different donors or acceptors in the same structure. Due to the NFA’s 
Materials of Organic Solar Cells

268
Organic and Perovskite Solar Cells
greater degree of freedom in modifying photoelectronic properties, 
such as energy levels, light absorption, and electronic mobilities, it 
has been possible to achieve in recent years efficiencies close to 20% 
for simple junctions (Zhang et al., 2022)—something unimaginable 
just a short time back.
Figure 7.8 Graphic visualization of the evolution of organic solar cells 
based on NREL-certified data from 2001 to 2021. Three important phases are 
reported, optimization of BHJ morphology, development of donor materials, 
and development of non-fullerene-based acceptor materials. Reprinted

Society.
7.3.2.1 Donors
Donors are generally classified according to the bandgap, divided 
by wide band gap (>1.8 eV), such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) 
mid-band gap (1.6–1.8 eV), such as poly[N-90-heptadecanyl-2,7-
carbazol-alt-5,5-(40,70-di-2-thienyl-20,10,30-benzothiadiazol)] 
(PCDTBT); and low bandgap (<1.6 eV), such as poly({4,8-bis[(2-
ethyl-hexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b´] dithiophene-2,6-diyl}{3-fluoro-
2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl}) (PTB7). As 
previously mentioned, the first years of research were focused on 
simpler structures, such as poly[2-methoxy,5-(2’-ethyl-hexyloxy)-
p-phenylene vinylene)] (MEH-PPV)/C60 and poly[2-methoxy-5-
(3’,7’-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] (MDMO-PPV)/1-
(3-methoxycarbonyl) propyl-1-phenyl[6,6]C61 (PCBM)◊PPV-type 
polymers.

269
	
The highest PCEs of these materials were limited to 3% due to 
the rather large band gap and low carrier mobility of the PPV-type 
polymers. However, they were an important step in the development 
due to the improved processing conditions. Later, the research 
focused on poly-alkyl-thiophenes. With this class of materials, the 
researchers demonstrated results with P3HT:PCBM mixtures, 
leading to efficiencies in the range of 3–5% PCE. Further efficiency 
enhancement of P3HT:PCBM devices were reported as a result of 
thermal annealing of the PAL. Over the first years, many studies 
have been performed on this structure to improve morphology in an 
attempt to reach higher performance and stability. Today, it can be 
said that is the most studied and well-known AL blend used in OPV.

Around 2010, another important development in donor 
materials was based on benzodithiophene. One of the most 
important materials studied at that time was (PTB7), achieving over 
7% PCE, with interesting optical bandgap (Eg ≈ 1.63 eV) and good 
mobility (5.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). In the following years, with the 
poly(benzodithiophene-co-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene) (PBDTTT), the 
milestone of 10% PCE was first surpassed. PBDTTT showed a low 
band gap (Eg ≈ 1.60 eV) and high mobility (5.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), 
which are important characteristics for enhancing charge transport 
(Liu et al., 2015). These systems and some of their derivatives, 
such as PTB7-Th and PBDT-TS1, showed good progress in terms 
of performance. However, some of these polymeric systems have 
been developed with optimal film thicknesses of ∼100 nm, which is 
not ideal, as a BHJ film with higher thickness is required to further

improve light absorption and to provide a better processing window 
for large-area roll-to-roll mass production.
PTB7
Figure 7.10 Chemical structures of PTB7 and PTB7-Th.
	
A critical point to reaching high efficiencies in polymer cells is to 
control the morphology of AL. Donor and acceptor domains should 
have sizes of the same scale as the exciton diffusion length, as they 
work as percolation pathways for the efficient collection of charge. 
The crystallization and/or aggregation of the polymer play an 
important role in determining light absorption and charge transport 
properties. The use of additives, such as octance‐1,8‐dithiol (ODT), 
1,8‐diiodooctane (DIO), 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), and diphenyl 
ether (DPE) (Park and Kim, 2019) can favor a better and more 
uniform phase separation between D:A making the OPV cells more 
efficient. Unfortunately, the use of these specific additives can have 
some negative effects on the stability of devices.

1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), (c) 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), and (d) diphenyl ether 
(DPE).
	
To solve this issue, OPV device engineering or ternary blend 
strategies have been used to optimize donor−acceptor systems to 
improve blend morphologies. By doing so, blends with increased 
charge mobility can be obtained, allowing optimal film thicknesses 
of 200–250 nm and PCs higher than 11%. In order to obtain OPV 

271
devices with sufficiently thick films, compatible with large-scale 
coating, donor materials with fair crystallization properties, and 
with intrinsic hole mobility greater than 1×10–3 cm2V–1s–1 have also 
been developed. The combination of these polymers with the high 
electron mobility fullerene acceptors (∼1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1s−1) (Li, 
2013) makes efficient OPV devices with thick films up to 300 nm 
possible.

(b) PM6
(c) PM7
Figure 7.12 Chemical structures of donors (a) PBTB-T, (b) PM6, (c) PM7.
	
In more recent years, other high-performance conjugated 
polymers have been developed such as PBDB-T, PM6, and PM7, 
which in combination with NFAs, especially with the Y-series (see 
next session), have reached even higher efficiencies. From these, 
PM6 has become one of the most studied materials in current OPV 
Materials of Organic Solar Cells

272
Organic and Perovskite Solar Cells
research thanks to its high performance and commercial availability. 
The downside of PM6 is that its performance is highly dependent on 
molecular weight, which can vary from batch to batch.
	
Another fundamental consideration for the OPV donor materials 
is that, in addition to purity, the suitable donor polymer must 
have orbitals at an appropriate energy level, uniform morphology, 
adequate crystallinity, high charge carriers’ mobility as well as a 
broad photons absorption in the highest energy solar spectrum 
region. Therefore, the synthesis of a D:A conjugated polymer 
requires extensive optimization of the polymerization step since 
the properties of the polymers strongly depend on the values ​and 
distributions of their molecular weights.
	
Conjugated and semiconductor polymers are the most developed 
donor materials, showing higher efficiencies compared to the 
solution-processable small molecules (Bagnis et al., 2010) which 
attracted more attention in recent years. A major advantage of small 
molecules is their well-defined and reproducible structure, with a 
simple purification process (Kan et al., 2021), which directly impacts 
large-scale production. Despite the benefits of the synthesis process, 
the performance of small molecule-based OPV devices is still lower 
than those based on polymers, currently with a record PCE close to 
15% (Hu et al., 2020).
7.3.2.2 Acceptors
From the acceptor side, soluble derivatives of C60-based (PC60BM) 
and C70 (PC70BM) fullerenes have been the most used acceptors in 
binary blends for more than a decade. The ideal acceptor should 
have an optimized energy level offset to the donor to guarantee 
efficient charge transfer and high Voc. Additionally, the electron 
mobility should be high enough to avoid recombination.
	
Fullerene-based acceptors have been known for the formation 
of dimers when exposed to light. These aggregates disturb the ideal 
morphology of the BHJ, affecting the charge generation and causing 
a decrease in efficiency in the first hours of the solar cell operation.
	
Recent developments have been made with acceptors based 
on conjugated small molecules, also called NFAs. Some of the new 
materials are also being developed for specific combinations, such 
as P3HT:O-IDTBR, PDCBT:ITIC, and PffBT4T-2OD:EH-IDTBR.

NFAs usually exhibit lower electron mobility (~1 × 10–4 – 1 × 10–3 
cm2 V–1 s–1) than FA, making NFA-based OPV devices more efficient 
with optimum thicknesses of ~100–120 nm. Although thicker layers 
Materials of Organic Solar Cells

274
Organic and Perovskite Solar Cells
can lead to higher absorption, there is also a decrease in FF due to 
higher resistance, and consequently, a decrease in PCE. This issue 
can be reduced by finely adjusting the molecular packaging of donors 
(such as P3HT, PM6, or PBDB-T-SF) and acceptors (such as IDIC, IT-
4F, or Y6) to improve charge mobility while maintaining an optimal 
BHJ morphology. However, these fine adjustments can only partially 
compensate for the PCE losses. By modifying the architecture of the 
device, with better interfaces between the AL and the interlayers, 
and by incorporating a second acceptor with higher mobility, such 
as the FA, it is possible to maintain considerable efficiencies while 
maintaining optimum PAL thicknesses of around 300 nm. Recently, 
ternary blends D:D:A based on a mix of fullerene and non-fullerene 
acceptors have been studied as a solution that offers a compromise 
between efficiency and stability.
Figure 7.15 Jsc versus Voc of acceptor from the Y-series and ITIC-types.

Chemical Society.
	
It is interesting to assess the state of the art of the various Y-series 
and ITIC-type NFAs in terms of their behavior as a function of current 
and voltage as reported by Zhang et al. (2022). As can be seen from 

275
Fig. 7.15, the linear trend of the Y-series systems, in addition to 
having a greater absorption in the near-infrared generating a higher 
current, have a lower relative loss of Voc compared to the ITIC-
series. From the graph, it is understood that the next generation 
of acceptors is crucial to understand the relationship between the 
molecular structures of the donors and the properties of the NFA 
systems obtaining a correlation between the chemical structures, 
the self-assembly, and their photophysical properties.
	
Despite the new developments, FA-based binary systems are 
currently the choice for commercial OPV panels, fabricated worldwide 
by companies such as ASCA, EPISHINE, and SUNEW, among others. 
The reasons behind this are related to the level of development of 
these systems, but also to costs, especially when compared to NFAs. 
However, it is expected that, with further development, NFA systems 
can provide not only higher performances, but longer lifetime and at 
a reasonable cost, becoming the next generation of commercial OPV.
7.3.3 Top Electrodes
Industrial-scale OPV production requires top electrode deposition 
by coating techniques. Depending on the application, it also needs 
to be semitransparent. Different deposition techniques, such as 
slot die or screen printing, can be used, which are fully compatible 
with a roll-to-roll process. Printable electrode materials are limited, 
and the most commonly used is silver (Ag), which can be found as 
paste, nanoparticles (AgNP), or nanowires (AgNW). A standard 
requirement for non-transparent electrodes is high surface 
conductivity, on the order of 1 Ω/sq or less. In the case of silver paste, 
screen printing is normally the deposition technique used, which 
can create a grid electrode with a semitransparent effect. Standard 
silver pastes have about 80% of silver in their composition, and the 
screen-printing deposition can result in line thicknesses of about 
10–15 µm and widths of up to 200 µm. Since it is a contact technique, 
the layer immediately below (HTL in the inverted structure) should 
be as thick as 400  nm to withstand the mechanical stress of the 
deposition, which could create defects and increase shunts in the 
device, compromising its functioning and reducing production yield. 
As previously mentioned, PEDOT:PSS is the most common choice for 
its practical deposition, good conductivity, a rather high transmission 
in the visible range, and relatively good mechanical properties.
Materials of Organic Solar Cells

276
Organic and Perovskite Solar Cells
	
In the case of AgNP and AgNW, contactless deposition techniques 
such as slot die, spray, or inkjet are recommended due to their 
low viscosity. The use of AgNP results in an opaque contact layer, 
while AgNW produces a highly semitransparent contact. AgNPs are 
composed of 25 to 40% Ag in volume and layer thicknesses between 
200 nm and 1 µm are possible. AgNW normally has less silver in 
the composition, between 10 to 20%, depending on the suppliers 
currently on the market, and thicknesses between 80  nm and 
300 nm are reachable.
	
In addition to Ag, copper (Cu) and carbon-based materials, such 
as carbon pastes, have also been recently tested. However, neither 
has processability comparable to the silver paste due to the high 
sintering temperature. Solutions based on carbon and graphene 
nanotubes have also been tested, without, at present, reaching 
efficiency results comparable to Ag, in addition to their higher cost.
	
In the research field, electrode deposition by scalable processes 
is not required and thermal evaporation is often chosen, giving 
the greater choice of materials. However, it demands high vacuum 
capabilities, in the order of 10–6 mbar, and material purity above 
99%. The design of the electrode contact requires the use of shadow 
masks placed in a sample holder that rotates to give uniformity 
during the evaporation of the material. By inducing current to the 
evaporation boat, the temperature increases until the pellet material 
passes from solid to liquid state and finally obtaining the metal in 
a gaseous state that will be deposited on the sample placed above. 
This deposition technique allows controlling the thickness deposited 
from a few Angstroms up to hundreds of nanometers, with minimum 
evaporation rates of 0.1 A/min.
	
Typical combinations of electrodes deposited by thermal 
evaporation are LiF/Al, Ca/Ag, and MoO/Ag. The last one is 
preferable, since aluminum and calcium, which are present in 
the first two combinations, are highly reactive to oxygen and corrode 
in air.
7.3.4 Substrate and Bottom Electrodes
For the construction of OPV devices the substrate used is of 
fundamental importance. Academic research normally adopts 
glass substrates while for commercial OPVs flexible substrates are 

277
preferred as they allow a higher scalability in production, though 
they impose big limitations in the highest possible temperatures 
(<140C) for the processing. The main criterion for a good substrate 
is transparency, which determines the amount of irradiation 
entering the device, therefore being in a direct relationship with 
the generated photocurrent. For glass substrates, the transparency 
is normally higher than 85% while for flexible substrates based 
on PET, it is higher than 75–80%. Using substrates based on 
Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), the transparency could be superior 
but with a high cost and, thus, normally less used in production. PET-
based substrates are thermally stabilized to withstand operating 
temperatures up to 140 °C.
	
A second requirement is the sheet resistance, or surface 
conductivity, determined by the type of TCO deposited, which should 
reach 10 Ω/sq to avoid electrical energy losses directly related to the 
FF and cell dimension. The most commonly used materials for TCOs 
are ITO, zinc-doped indium oxide (IZO), aluminum-doped zinc oxide 
(AZO), or FTO.
	
Most of these oxides are deposited by sputtering or atomic 
layer deposition (ALD) obtaining an intrinsic work function of ITO 
between 4.4 and 4.9 eV. Another factor to consider when choosing 
the substrate is the surface roughness of the TCO. Since the OPV is a 
multilayer device with thicknesses from a few tens to a few hundred 
nanometers, a high roughness would result in less uniformity 
of the deposited layers, creating local shunts and reducing the 
FF, resulting in lower efficiency and a shorter lifetime. Chemical 
stability, especially for flexible substrates, is essential to obtain well-
performing OPV devices.
	
Since the conductivity of the TCO is proportional to its thickness, 
normally a thickness around 180–200 nm is used, which represents 
a compromise between the transparency and the consistent increase 
in its brittleness especially for flexible substrates. A practical, 
functional, and economical solution was found by creating a multi-
layered TCO in the ITO/Metal/ITO (IMI) structure. The presence 
of a metal layer, normally silver, allows to reduce the quantity of 
Indium in the ITO with a thickness of about 70 nm for each layer 
maintaining a high transparency and the sheet resistance even 
lower than 10 Ω/sq.
Materials of Organic Solar Cells

278
Organic and Perovskite Solar Cells
	
Since the silver layer is thinner than 10  nm, it does not 
compromise the transparency maintaining conductivity between 
the layers of ITO and increasing the mechanical properties of the 
TCO.
	
Other types of transparent electrodes could be used, such as 
silver nanowires or metallic grids, but currently, they are not used 
in production but only as prototypes or as feasibility demonstrators. 
The use of highly conductive PEDOT:PSS could be a possible 
alternative but, as described in the previous paragraphs, it reduces 
the stability of the device.
7.4 Manufacturing Technologies
As mentioned above, one of the biggest advantages of OPVs is the low 
cost of production. Solution-processing manufacturing techniques 
are less energy intensive, due to low processing temperatures 
(<120°C) and less wasteful than other techniques based on 
vacuum deposition, requiring lower initial investment (CAPEX) and 
operation costs (OPEX). In addition, the possibility of utilizing a roll-
to-roll continuous process for the coating can speed up production 
and lower the costs even more.
	
Herein, a few coating techniques used for the manufacturing of 
OPV devices are described, from research-only methods to large-area 
printing. A more in-depth description of these and other techniques 
can be found in Chapter 3.
7.4.1 Spin Coating
Spin coating is a deposition technique for uniform thin films on flat 
substrates. In this process, a small amount of a solution is deposited 
in the center of a substrate, which is rotated at high speed. The 
substrate is attached to the equipment through a vacuum pump and 
the centrifugal force spreads the liquid to the edges of the substrate, 
leaving on top a very uniform thin film. The final film thickness and 
other properties depend on the nature of the fluid and characteristics 
such as viscosity, drying rate, percentage of solids, and surface 
tension, in addition to the spin coating process parameters. The 

279
solvents used are generally volatile and evaporate simultaneously 
with the rotation step. The higher the angular speed of rotation, the 
thinner the resulting film.
	
One of the most important factors of the technique is 
reproducibility. Small variations in the parameters that define 
the spin coating process can result in drastic variations in the 
resulting film. The advantages of the technique are simplicity and 
ease of the process, in addition to short processing times since high 
rotation speeds increase drying rates. The disadvantages are that it 
is inherently a process where only one substrate is produced at a 
time, which limits throughput compared to roll-to-roll processes. In 
addition, another negative point is the waste of material used—only 
10% of the material dispensed remains on the substrate and the rest 
is thrown out.
	
Despite the disadvantages, spin coating is still the initial technique 
and the starting point that serves as a reference for most academic 
processes that require the deposition of thin and uniform films. It is 
also the coating technique used to reach most record performances 
reported in the literature.
7.4.2 Blade Coating
In the blade coating technique, a blade is used to spread the solution 
over the substrate to form thin films. A small amount of solution 
is placed on the edge of a substrate and the blade is set in motion, 
dragging the solution, and leaving a wet film on the substrate. After 
the solvent evaporates, which can be controlled by the temperature 
of the solution and the substrate, a dry film is formed. The thickness 
of the film depends on factors such as the concentration of the 
solution, the gap between the blade and the substrate, and the blade 
speed, which should be constant in order to produce films without a 
thickness gradient.
	
Compared to spin coating, blade coating can be used to deposit 
films on larger areas and wastes less materials; however, it also 
produces only one sample at a time. Nevertheless, this coating 
method is close to industrial processes such as slot die, which makes 
it an important step in the scale-up process.

7.4.3 Slot-Die Coating
The slot-die technique is similar to blade coating, but instead of a 
blade to drag the solution, it uses a printing head with a reservoir 
and a small aperture through which the ink is dispensed onto the 
substrate to form the wet film. This method requires larger volumes 
of solution to fill the reservoir and feeding tubes. However, while 
in the blade coating technique the substrates cannot be very long, 
in the case of the slot die the meniscus is constantly fed by a pump 
and therefore there are no limitations on the length of the substrate, 
which allows this technique to be used in continuous printing 
processes such as roll-to-roll.
	
The thickness of the final film is determined by a combination 
of factors: ink flow rate, coating speed, width of the deposited film, 
defined by the shim and meniscus guide, the gap between the head 
and the substrate, solids concentration, and temperature. Although 
more complex, the use of the slot-die method results in less waste 
and a high level of precision, enabling different patterned layouts 
(Rossi, Polino, and Brunetti, 2022).
7.4.4 Spray Coating
In the spray coating technique, a spray nozzle is used to disperse 
fine droplets in a continuous flow over a substrate. Compressed 
air is used to apply high pressure on the fluid discharged from the 
nozzle and it is split up into a mist that hits the target. The droplet 
size and location are randomized in the process, and many of these 
droplets need to overlap with each other to ensure full surface 
coverage. New droplets can dissolve previously deposited materials, 
which adds complexity to the process. Keeping the substrate 
at elevated temperatures during spraying increases the rate of 
solvent evaporation and reduces the re-dissolution of the deposited 
material. Thus, the balance between solvent removal and material 
re-dissolving can be controlled by adjusting the solvent ratio and 
substrate temperature. The thickness and quality of the film depend 
on the fluid properties, such as viscosity, surface tension, and the 
type of solvent, on the properties of the gas and nozzle, as well as 
on the working distance and coating speed. The advantage of spray 
coating is that the coating process is fast and considered low-cost.

281
7.4.5 Inkjet Printing
In inkjet printing, ink is ejected from nozzles in the printing head, 
with fine control of droplet size and trajectory, to form a pattern 
digitally defined on a substrate. The main advantages of inkjet 
printing are ambient processing, low material waste, and, above 
all, custom design versatility and digital production. However, the 
feasibility of using inkjet for high volumes and large production is 
limited by the printing speed and device architecture. The thickness 
of the dry film obtained is determined by the number and volume of 
droplets per unit area and ink concentration (Krebs, 2009).
7.4.6 Screen Printing
In the screen-printing process, a mesh screen is used to transfer 
the ink in a designed pattern to a substrate. The pattern is defined 
by filling the screen in the non-desired areas with a solution 
impermeable to the coating ink, while the pattern area is kept open. 
During the printing process, the coating solution is placed on the 
screen and a squeegee is used to spread it, forcing it through the 
open areas and resulting in the pattern transfer to the substrate. 
The thickness of the final film is determined by the mesh size 
and thickness of the emulsion area. Important parameters in this 
process are the ink viscosity, snap-off distance, squeegee pressure, 
and speed.
7.4.7 Roll-to-Roll Manufacturing
Roll-to-roll (R2R) processing is a manufacturing process that allows 
the coating of electronic devices on a roll of a flexible substrate. 
It can use different printing techniques, such as slot die or screen 
printing, to create large-area devices in a continuous process. The 
process starts with a roll of substrate that is unrolled and passes 
through the printing area and ovens for drying. At the end of the 
process, the printed substrate is rolled up again. In the case of OPV, 
where multiple layers are deposited on top of each other, the process 
can be carried out in a single station, with the roll returning to the 
beginning of the process after each layer for the next deposition, or 
in a continuous process, with several stations connected in series,

one for each layer. Despite the higher level of automation, this second 
option requires the same printing speed for all layers, which poses 
an additional challenge. The biggest advantage of an R2R process is 
the possibility of creating large-area devices with a low production 
cost, highly related to the level of automation, low usage of materials, 
and relatively low processing temperatures.
7.5 Electrical Characterization of a Solar Cell
The I–V curve is a typical device characteristic to evaluate the 
performance of a solar cell. In this process, under a constant 
illumination of 1 sun (1000 W/m²), the cell is subjected to a voltage 
sweep, and the corresponding values of generated current are 
measured. The key parameters representing the performance of 
the solar cell are extracted from this measurement: the short-circuit 
current (Isc) or its density (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the FF, 
and the PCE. These factors are related through the formula:
	
PCE

where Pin is the irradiance of the lamp, Pmax is the maximum power 
of the cell, and A is the illuminated area of the cell. In addition to 
these factors, approximate values of series resistance (Rs) and shunt 
or parallel resistance (Rsh) can be extracted from the curve, as the 
inverse of the slope at the point of open circuit and short circuit, 
respectively. Figure 7.16 shows an I–V curve with the representation 
of all electrical parameters. The maximum power point (MPP) of a 
solar cell corresponds to the point in the I–V curve where the product 
of current and voltage is maximum. The corresponding values of 
current and voltage are called Imax and Vmax, respectively. This is 
usually the condition in which a PV system operates. The efficiency 
of solar cells is calculated as the ratio of power generated to incident 
power from the sun or other light sources.
	
The efficiency of the solar cell and the MPP are the most 
important parameters for the operation of a PV system. However, 
the other figures of merit help us understand the behavior and the 
health of the solar cell.

283
Figure 7.16 Representation of a typical I–V curve of a solar cell and its main 
electrical parameters.
	
Voc is the maximum voltage of a solar cell, and it occurs when 
the circuit is open and there is no current running in the system. 
It corresponds to the bias of the solar cell junction and is highly 
dependent on the band gap.
	
Isc is the current when there is no voltage across the solar cell, in 
other words, under short-circuit conditions. It is the result of light-
generated and collected charges. It is dependent on the cell area. 
Thus, when comparing different solar cells, the short-circuit current 
density (Jsc) is used.
	
FF is a measurement of the squareness of the cell. The shape 
of an ideal I–V curve is a square limited by the values of Voc and Isc 
and FF represents how close the curve of the cell is to this shape. 
Mathematically, it corresponds to the ratio of the product of Vmax × 
Imax (its operation point) to the product of Voc × Isc (maximum values 
of voltage and current). Graphically, it is the ratio of the orange to the 
black rectangle in Fig. 7.16.

Two factors directly affect the value of FF: the series and 
shunt resistance. The series resistance is connected to losses in 
charge transport through the different layers and interfaces. Shunt

resistance, on the other hand, represents current losses through 
alternative current paths, such as manufacturing defects, which 
reduce the output current and the voltage of the solar cell. Figure 
7.17 shows how these resistances affect the shape, therefore, the FF 
of a cell.
Figure 7.17 Representation of a typical I–V curve of a solar cell and its main 
electrical parameters.
	
The I–V characterization curve results are susceptible to external 
conditions, such as the lamp spectrum itself and the measurement 
temperature. To avoid non-conformities and conflict of results, 
international standards have been created, such as IEC-61215 
(2016), which determine specific test conditions for reliable results 
and comparisons. An I–V curve is typically recorded by illuminating 
the cell with a device called a solar simulator. Several types of 
simulators are available on the market, with different types of 
lamps and with different levels of stability and uniformity. Ideally, 
simulators with a Xenon lamp, that has a spectrum similar to the 
AM1.5G solar spectrum, are used. In addition to spectrum matching, 
it is important that there is uniformity in the illuminated area and 
that the light has good temporal stability.
	
Another important electrical characterization of a solar cell is 
the external quantum efficiency (EQE), which represents the ratio 
of the number of electrons extracted from the solar cell to the 
number of incident photons. The measurement of EQE is wavelength 
dependent, like the absorption of the AL, and is typically measured 
under open-circuit conditions.
	
EQE
Number of collected electrons
Number of incident photons
l( ) =
¥100% .

285
	
The EQE of a solar cell is always lower than 100%, due to optical 
losses and charge recombination. When the light hits the cell, some 
photons can be reflected at the surface or absorbed in other layers 
before reaching the active part. Additionally, electron–hole pairs 
can also recombine before extraction, reducing the device’s EQE. A 
better way to quantify the efficiency of the device is by measuring the 
internal quantum efficiency (IQE). It represents the ratio between 
collected electrons and the photons absorbed by the AL, discarding 
the reflected part. A high IQE value represents high efficiency in 
the internal processes of the solar cell, such as exciton separation, 
charge transport, and collection.

l( ) =

From the EQE measurement, it is possible to estimate the Jsc of 
the cell by integrating the product of EQE and the photon flux of the 
AM1.5G spectra, as shown in the formula.

7.6 Lifetime and Degradation of Organic 
Solar Cells
In recent years, a significant evolution has been observed in terms 
of OPV conversion efficiency. However, in the energy market, this is 
just one of the factors to consider. In addition to efficiency, durability, 
and cost per KWh are key factors when evaluating photovoltaic 
technology.
	
As it contains organic materials, an OPV is susceptible to 
degradation by environmental factors such as humidity, oxygen, 
temperature, and light itself, and product durability poses a major 
challenge. In general, the factors that affect the lifetime of OPV can 
be divided into extrinsic and intrinsic. Humidity and oxygen can be 
considered extrinsic factors, which can be avoided through effective 
Lifetime and Degradation of Organic Solar Cells

encapsulation. Light and heat, on the contrary, cannot be avoided 
and act internally in the cell, being known as intrinsic degradation 
factors. Figure 7.18 summarizes some of the degradation factors of 
the organic solar cell (Jørgensen, Norrman, and Krebs, 2008).
Figure 7.18 Schematic cross-section view of a solar cell with the many 
processes that conspire to degrade polymer solar cells. A schematic illustration 
of some degradation processes that take place in a typical BHJ is shown. 
Reprinted from Jørgensen et al. (2008), Copyright (2008), with permission from 
Elsevier.
	
Oxygen and water can cause the oxidation of organic layers 
and interfaces. This oxidation can affect the electrical properties 
of the device by changing the chemical structure of the materials, 
thus reducing conductivity and increasing the resistance to charge 
transport, as in the case of electrode corrosion (Grossiord et al., 
2012) It can also affect the optical properties of the device, as 
observed with the bleaching of the AL (Riede, Spoltore, and Leo, 
2021).
	
A proper encapsulation, as previously mentioned, can prevent 
this type of degradation. For rigid devices, glass offers excellent 
protection, while flexible ones can use PET-based barrier films. In this 
case, the films need to have excellent optical and barrier properties, 
such as high transparency, low haze, UV protection, and low water 
vapor and oxygen transmission rates (WVTR and OTR, respectively). 
Additionally, the films can also receive surface treatments in order to 

287
improve optical properties, such as anti-reflective and anti-scratch 
coatings, as well as hydrophobicity and adhesion properties. In 
this type of encapsulation, liquid adhesives based on acrylates or 
epoxies are commonly used and must be chemically inert to the OPV 
materials, as well as present good mechanical and optical properties 
after curing.
	
The encapsulation, however, cannot protect the cell from the 
intrinsic factors. Light is the fundamental factor for the generation of 
photovoltaic energy, but at the same time, it causes the degradation 
of the organic materials that make up the cell. Photochemical 
degradation is an important effect, especially for the donor polymers, 
which can affect the conjugation as well as the absorption of light 
and hole mobility (Grossiord et al., 2012). Light can also affect the 
performance of the device by causing dimerization of acceptors 
based on fullerenes. This is a well-studied degradation mechanism 
of OPV, where fullerenes dimerize under illumination, changing 
the morphology of the AL and leading to the reduction of charge-
carrier mobility, which affects both the FF and the output current of 
the devices (Distler et al., 2014). This degradation usually occurs in 
the first hours of light exposure and is referred to in the literature 
as the “burn-in” period, which is usually followed by a more stable 
term. The morphology of the devices can also be affected in the 
long term by heat exposure, which can cause blend reorganization 
and the formation of donor and acceptor clusters, lowering exciton 
dissociation and charge transport (Grossiord et al., 2012).
	
Other factors related to the manufacturing process can also 
affect the stability of the cells, such as traces of solvents remaining 
from the drying step and shunt defects, affecting film quality and 
the nanostructure. The purity of materials and molecular weight of 
polymers should also be taken into account.
	
To date, there are no standard practices to evaluate the lifetime 
of organic solar cells. The IEC-61215-1:2016 (2016) standards 
define a sequence of tests and passing criteria to certify the stability 
of traditional PV, such as silicon and thin films, however, it does 
not mention third-generation technologies. The reason behind this 
is that, unlike inorganic materials, the degradation mechanisms 
in organic solar cells are much more complex and varied due to 
the multitude of materials and combinations possible. Thus, it is 
difficult for the technology to enter the market, as durability cannot

288
Organic and Perovskite Solar Cells
be certified. It does not mean, though, that stability is not tested. In 
2011, a group of researchers (Reese et al., 2011) defined a series 
of tests to allow comparisons between their stability results. The 
ISOS tests (from International Summit on Organic Stability) assess 
the stability of OPV exposing the cells to temperature, humidity, and 
light, separately or in combination, defining different stress levels. 
Typical values used are 65 to 85°C, 50 to 85% relative humidity, and 
1000 W/m² illumination, or 1 sun, applied constantly or in cycles, 
simulating day and night operation. These conditions test materials 
at stress levels above what is experienced in real operation, what is 
known as accelerated lifetime tests, and are used to provide quick 
results. They do not, however, predict how long the PV will last in 
an installation. The best approach for this is to test the cell outdoors 
under operating conditions. The drawback is that it takes time and 
results are collected over a long-time span. Additionally, the lifetime 
can vary according to the type of installation and location, as the 
climate varies, and different stress factors can lead the degradation 
(Soares et al., 2020).
	
Despite all the difficulties, recent studies (Zhang et al., 2018) 
have reported durability over 2 years under real environmental 
conditions and there are already commercial applications of 
glass-encapsulated OPV façades with over 6 years of operation. 
Applications have also been demonstrated in semitransparent OPV 
modules laminated between flexible barrier films and glass sheets 
that meet the IEC-61215-1:2016 environmental chamber tests, as 
required for thin-film solar modules. The investigated flexible and 
rigid OPV modules demonstrated less than 4% and 8% efficiency 
drop, respectively, after damp heat, thermal cycling, and a sequence 
test. This remarkable development confirms that OPV modules 
packaged between flexible barriers or rigid glass sheets can 
withstand critical stress tests. Altogether, these results show that the 
continuous development of OPV materials can, in the near future, 
sustain the consolidation of OPVs in the PV market.
7.7 Application Examples of OPVs
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in OPV due 
to its potential market applications. The possibility of creating 

289
photovoltaic systems on flexible plastic using organic materials 
has obvious advantages in terms of costs, manufacturing, and 
applications. As a relatively new technology, OPV does not aim to 
compete with established classic solar technologies in terms of 
efficiency or durability. It is continuously improving, following the 
development of new materials, and gradually occupying its space, 
where traditional PV is not suitable.
	
OPV modules have many potential applications, from remote 
sensors, urban furniture, and mobility to large-scale building-
integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications. The main players in the 
sector can cover various market segments and develop customized 
solutions for the problems faced.
	
The possibility of customization is a great advantage of this 
technology compared to classic PVs. OPVs can lead to products that 
can exploit different degrees of semi-transparency, color variations, 
and lightness. BIPV is certainly one of the major applications for 
OPV and a few commercial installations can already be spotted 
around the world. In this type of installation, photovoltaic panels 
can be integrated directly into building elements, such as laminated 
between glasses for the composition of façades or even applied to 
existing buildings through adhesive solutions. In addition to turning 
the surface into an energy harvester, OPV can also provide luminous 
and thermal comfort to environments, due to its semi-transparency 
(35–50%) and its absorption of near-infrared light, which can be 
beneficial on skylights and shopping malls.
	
The aesthetic features of OPV, such as color, transparency, and 
free shape can be also explored for architectural purposes. An 
example of this is the Novartis Pavilion in Basel (ASCA), where the 
entire façade was made with the integration of modules in the form 
of diamonds which power light-emitting diodes (LEDs), creating 
fascinating optical and aesthetic effects. Besides buildings, OPV can 
also be integrated into items of urban furniture, such as bus stations 
or totems such as the OPTree (Sunew). The latter allows you to 
recharge electronic devices through USB ports or distribute the 
city Wi-Fi while maintaining an aesthetic integration in the urban 
environment.
Application Examples of OPVs

290
Organic and Perovskite Solar Cells
	
The low weight and flexibility of OPVs also allow their use in the 
mobility market, being applied on top of vehicles. An interesting 
case study is the use of OPV panels on trucks. The energy produced 
is used to keep the stand-by batteries charging, while also powering 
internal lights, optimizing the distribution process, and reducing the 
carbon footprint of the operation.	OPVs can also be adapted for 
portable applications or be used to have easily transportable energy 
with solutions that can be rolled up and extended under the sun as 
required.
	
In areas with limited access to electricity, there is also a market 
that can be explored with off-grid solutions. With the growth in 
production and cheapness of raw materials produced on a large 
scale, OPV has the potential to be a low-cost solution for powering 
off-grid users in developing countries. An interesting example of 
this is the integration of OPV in the Warka Solar project. OPV uses 
easily available materials such as nylon and bamboo to collect water 
from the humidity present in ambient air from daily temperature 
variations. With the OPV integration, the tower is not only collecting 
and supplying water to the community but also generating electricity 
for a small number of users.
	
Examples of the use of OPV can be found in Fig. 7.19.

Currently, it is possible to find commercial products in panel sizes 
up to 2 × 0.6 m, but also to have customized solutions in terms of size 
and layout. However, for a successful and competitive OPV product, 
the cost must be low. Commercial interest is constantly increasing 
especially due to the recent evolution in terms of efficiency, which 
suggests it will be commercially profitable in the coming years. In 
the short term, the OPV market is consolidating by exploiting its 
unique features, gradually transforming urban structures into active 
energy production surfaces, without disfiguring their aesthetics and 
functionality.
Low light applications
Although designed to take advantage of sunlight to produce electricity, 
in recent years, photovoltaic devices have been increasingly used 
to harness indoor light, especially for powering low-consuming 
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Due to its properties of absorption 
of diffused light and matching with the visible light spectrum, OPVs 
(as well as PSCs described in the following paragraphs) perform 
well for low light conditions both indoors and outdoors. The key 
difference between indoor and outdoor applications is the spectrum 
of the light source and its intensity. For outdoor applications, the 
AM1.5G is the reference spectrum of the sunlight, with intensities 
measured in units of Watt/m². For indoor applications, although 
there is no standard for reference spectrum, artificial light sources 
such as LED, fluorescent, halogen, and incandescent lamps 
(currently being removed from the market) are used, with intensity 
values measured in lux (Lumen/m²). The choice of lamp type and 
light intensity depends on the requirements of each environment, as 
shown in Fig. 7.20.
	
In low light conditions, the shunt resistance (Rsh) turns out to 
be more critical than the series resistance (Rs), and a minimum Rsh 
requirement of 85 kΩcm2 is suggested (Steim et al., 2011). Additional 
studies investigated how Rsh and reverse saturated current (J0) affect 
the performance of devices in low light conditions and concluded 
that the absolute value of Rsh required varies for different systems 

293
depending on the relationship between J0 and short-circuit current 
density (Jsc) (Lechêne et al., 2016). Recently, the relationship between 
the thickness of the AL and the output power under different light 
intensities has also been demonstrated. Encapsulated minimodules 
totally printed by slot die in R2R with thicker Als showed an output 
power of 16 µw/cm² at 400 lux, enough to power small IoT devices 
(Miranda et al., 2021).

Despite these advances, the internal performance of PV devices 
is still far from the theoretical limit of 50% PCE for fluorescent 
lamps and 60% PCE for LED lighting (Bahrami-Yekta and Tiedje, 
2018; Lee et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the first products have already 
been released in the market, replacing batteries, and reducing 
maintenance costs, like the example in Fig. 7.21.

7.8 Chemistry of Metal Halide Perovskites
MHPs are ionic crystalline solids with stoichiometry ABX3, where 
A is a monovalent cation (organic—e.g., methylammonium, MA+, 
formamidinium, FA+ – or inorganic, like cesium, Cs+), B is a divalent 

295
cation (typically Pb2+ or Sn2+), and X is a halogen anion (Cl–, Br–, 
I– or mixtures thereof) (Fig. 7.22). MHPs crystallize in a three-
dimensional (3D) cubic lattice consisting of corner-sharing BX6 
octahedra with cuboctahedral voids filled with A-site cations. The 
rich and facile solution chemistry of these materials allows a myriad 
of structures and compositions with diverse optical and electronic 
properties. For example, the development of low-dimensional MHPs 
with large A-site cations, typically consisting of two-dimensional 
(2D) structures made of alternating organic and inorganic layers, has 
marked a bold step toward the modulation of both the performance 
and the stability of MHP-based devices.

comprises BX6 octahedra with cuboctahedral voids filled with the larger A-site 
cations. Modified with permission from Park, Nam-Gyu Mater. Today 2015, 18,

The remarkable defect tolerance of MHPs to crystallographic 
and non-stoichiometry defects is an extraordinary feature of these 
materials, which is the key to the success of their outstanding 
performance in solar cells. Defects in the light absorber are known 
to be detrimental to the minority carrier lifetimes, promoting 
nonradiative recombination that hinders the collection of 
photogenerated charges, in turn reducing the open-circuit voltage of 
the device. Conventional semiconductors, like cadmium selenide or

gallium arsenide (GaAs), are extremely sensitive to the presence of 
point defects, and their processing requires costly and sophisticated 
techniques to manufacture defect-free films for high-efficiency 
solar cells. On the contrary, MHPs can leverage low-temperature 
solution-based synthesis routes, with the great advantage of 
enormously reducing fabrication costs, though these processing 
methods unavoidably generate a high concentration of defects. The 
origin of the defect tolerance of MHPs lies in their chemistry, in 
particular, the structure of their valence and conduction band which 
consists of antibonding orbitals at both band edges resulting from 
the hybridization between the Pb2+ and halide anion orbitals. This 
electronic structure favors the formation of shallow nonbonding 
defect states that mostly lie close to the band edges, hence not 
deteriorating the carrier lifetimes.
	
These considerations suggest that Pb is a very suitable element 
from a chemical point of view for the B-site cation of MHPs, given 
its electronic configuration with strong antibonding coupling with 
the halogen anion. On the other hand, the need of exploring low-
toxicity and intrinsically stable Pb-free alternatives has highlighted 
the elements of Group VA of the periodic table (termed pnictogens, 
e.g., antimony (Sb)- and bismuth (Bi)) as interesting candidates 
as they have a similar electronic configuration to Pb. It is worth 
clarifying that not all metal halides are MHPs but only those whose 
B-site cation has an oxidation state “+2” and has an ionic radius of 
suitable size to preserve the conventional 3D crystal structure. As 
both Sb and Bi have a “+3” oxidation state, they form metal halides 
with A3B2X9 stoichiometry. These compounds, known as perovskite-
inspired materials (PIMs), typically crystallize in low-dimensional 
structures (2D or lower) which are detrimental to charge transport 
and have wide bandgaps around 2 eV or larger not ideal for solar 
cells. To overcome these limitations, recently their dimensionality 
has been increased (toward 3D structures) by replacing the 
ubiquitous A-site cations (i.e., Cs+, MA+, FA+) with silver (Ag+) and/
or copper (Cu+) leading to silver-iodo-bismuthates, including the so-
called rudorffites and Cu-Ag-Bi-I pnictohalides. The field of PIMs is, 
however, still in its early infancy and there is a growing interest in 
developing new compositions to prompt new or existing applications 
that better suit their wide bandgaps, such as indoor photovoltaics 
and multijunction (tandem) solar cells.

7.9 Optoelectronic Properties of Perovskites
The highly symmetric 3D crystalline structure of these materials, 
and the weakly bound excitons in the band-edge states, play a critical 
role in the rationalization of the fascinating properties of MHPs 
and their excellent performance in optoelectronic devices. One of 
the most relevant features of these semiconductors is their superb 
ability to absorb light, evidenced by the high absorption coefficient 
(105 cm−1) in the proximity of the band-edge is critical to maximizing 
the photocurrent generation and collection, which enables high 
photocurrent generation even with thin (typically 0.2‒0.5 μm) 
perovskite films. The absorption onset (Fig. 7.23) is much sharper 
than that of other popular semiconductors like GaAs and crystalline 
silicon (c-Si). MHPs display bright photoluminescence, narrow 
spectral widths, and high photoluminescence quantum yield (up to 
unity), particularly when moving from macroscopic bulk films down 
to nanocrystals. The absorption and emission properties of MHPs 
can be easily tuned via halide composition (X-site) engineering—
their bandgap can span throughout the visible region up to the 
near-infrared (400‒800  nm). The composition of A- and B-sites 
and external stimuli, like pressure or temperature, also affect the 
optical properties of MHPs, as they induce changes in the crystal 
growth of perovskite crystals, in turn affecting the structure and film 
morphology (e.g., grain size).

Optoelectronic Properties of Perovskites

Organic and Perovskite Solar Cells
	
Other key properties of MHPs, important for their application 
in optoelectronics, are the long charge-carrier diffusion length 
(~1 µm), remarkable carrier mobility (e.g., 13‒66 cm2 V–1 s–1 for 
MAPbI3), and long-lived carrier lifetimes (in the order of µs), and 
high charge-carrier conductivity (1‒10 cm2 V–1 s–1).
7.10 Perovskite Solar Cells
In PSCs, the perovskite light-harvesting layer is sandwiched between 
an n-type electron-transport material (ETM) and a p-type hole-
transport material (HTM). The working principle of PSCs is similar 
to that of OPVs: upon photon absorption from the perovskite AL, 
excitons are generated. To achieve free charge carriers (electrons 
and holes) that enable the current flow, the exciton binding energy, 
normally low in perovskites, needs to be overcome. The electrons 
and holes are then selectively collected by the ETM and the HTM, 
respectively, and transported to the electrodes. Finally, the two 
electrodes are connected, and a photocurrent is generated through 
an external circuit.
	
Depending on whether the perovskite is deposited atop the ETM 
or the HTM, we refer to the conventional n-i-p or inverted p-i-n 
structure, respectively. In other words, the structure dictates the 
direction of charge collection. Furthermore, ad-hoc ETMs and ETMs 
are typically selected for conventional or inverted structures. This 
originates different interfaces in the device, which notably affect the 
efficiency and stability of PSCs. The most common PSC architectures 
are the so-called planar and mesoscopic, see Fig. 7.24. A planar 
PSC employs a thin and compact ETM layer (e.g., titanium dioxide, 
TiO2, or tin oxide, SnO2), while in mesoscopic PSCs the perovskite is 
infiltrated through a mesoporous scaffold (typically TiO2 or Al2O3). 
The device architecture determines the microstructure of the 
perovskite layer: in the planar device, the perovskite crystal growth 
is limited only by the neighboring grains while in the mesoscopic 
counterpart, the perovskite crystallization (i.e., the morphology and 
size of the grains) is controlled by the pore size of the mesoporous 
scaffold. Both architectures, in addition to the aforementioned 
ETM, perovskite, and HTM layers, comprise two electrodes, one 
transparent front electrode and a TCO, such as fluorine-doped tin 

299
oxide, FTO, or ITO and a metallic rear (or back) electrode (e.g., Au, 
Ag, Cu). Recently, carbon-based electrodes have been proposed as 
an alternative to rear electrodes. Noble metals are costly and need 
to be thermally evaporated, hence they cannot be considered for 
the large-scale development of PSCs. Moreover, they are known 
to diffuse into the underlying layers, inducing degradation. In the 
carbon-electrode structures, the HTM is removed, and the carbon 
electrode also serves as HTL. Though the typical PCE of metallic 
rear electrode devices is significantly higher, carbon-based PSCs are 
promising as they are exceptionally stable and can be screen-printed 
on large areas, drastically cutting the fabrication costs.

p-i-n planar (c). Modified with permission from Vivo et al. (2017).
	
The PCE of the state-of-the-art PSC is currently approaching 
26%, thus becoming close to that of traditional silicon PVs that have 
been investigated for many decades. This makes PSCs the fastest-
growing PV technology ever. The high open-circuit voltage (Voc, 
1.1‒1.2 V) is the key to the exceptional PCE of PSCs. In some cases, 
Voc is close to the theoretical Shockley–Queisser limit (1.32 V), which 
depends on the bandgap of MHP (1.6 eV for MAPbI3). The high Voc, 
compared to that of OPV and other solution- or vacuum-processed 
PV technologies, stems from the defect-tolerant nature of MHPs that 
helps in minimizing the nonradiative recombination losses.
	
PSC technology is extremely competitive in terms of costs, 
currently estimated at 0.16 $/watt and estimated to be lowered 
to 0.10 $/watt in the near future. Conversely, established PV 
technologies cost ~0.40‒0.70 $/watt. The great promise of PSCs 
for low-cost PVs arises from their cheap solution processing, 
which is similar to that developed for OPVs (refer to Section 7.4 for 
further details).

7.11 Applications Beyond Photovoltaics
The skyrocketing advancement of PSCs has energized the 
optoelectronic community and promoted their investigation 
into other than PV devices. Rapidly, MHP-based LEDs, lasers, 
photodetectors, field-effect (FET) transistors, X-ray imaging 
detectors, switching memories, and more have been realized. 
More recently, MHPs have emerged also as promising and cost-
effective photocatalysts for solar-driven chemistry applications, 
such as photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting for 
hydrogen generation and carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction. Indeed, 
the energy band structure of MHPs meets the redox potential 
requirements of photocatalytic reactions though the development 
of waterproof MHPs (as processes generally require direct contact 
with water) is still limited by their inherent moisture instability.
	
The tunable emission and high photoluminescence quantum 
yield of MHPs enable efficient multicolor LEDs and low-threshold 
lasers. Perovskite-based LEDs have already reached nearly unit 
photoluminescence quantum yield and EQE above 20% thanks to the 
enormous advances in film morphology as well as charge injection 
engineering. The superior carrier mobility and low exciton binding 
energy of MHPs have motivated their launch in resistive-switching 
memories (ReRAMs), for which even a known drawback of these 
semiconductors, namely the hysteresis in the current-voltage (I–V) 
characteristics, can be beneficial upon careful probing.
	
The strong X-ray absorption and large mobility-lifetime product 
of MHPs explain the great interest of the community in X-ray direct 
and indirect scintillator detectors, which are deemed by many as 
the most promising practical application of MHPs together with 
photovoltaics. Indeed, MHP semiconductors have relevant properties 
to outperform traditional X-ray detection materials (e.g., cesium 
iodide, cadmium telluride, amorphous selenium). The properties 
of MHPs that perfectly suit these applications include high X-ray 
sensitivity, large effective atomic number, strong light yield, and 
small afterglow. Despite the many challenges to be still overcome, 
like the modest working stability of perovskite X-ray detectors and 
the lack of a standardized protocol to characterize them, there is 
trust that MHPs can significantly boost the development of X-ray 

301
imaging for various domains, from medical diagnostics to security 
inspection and non-destructive material research.
	
Finally, the emerging application of MHPs in energy storage 
devices should be mentioned as this field is continuously growing, 
in parallel to energy harvesting, due to the increasing world energy 
demand. MHPs have been adopted in energy storage devices with 
multiple roles, namely as cathode, anode, or even electrolyte. In 
lithium (Li) ion batteries, MHPs have shown remarkable stability 
during electrochemical cycling without structural rearrangements, 
e.g., crystal distortions. In supercapacitors, MHPs have been 
employed mainly as electrode materials. The performance of MHP-
based supercapacitors is highly affected by the film morphology 
of the perovskites and can be optimized via doping and defect 
engineering. A lot remains, however, to be understood on the role of 
MHP defects and doping in energy storage devices as this field is in 
its early infancy.
7.12 Summary and Outlook
In the last two decades, OPV technology has moved from a laboratory 
concept of a few percent efficiency units up to a recent record 
reaching 19%. Meanwhile, device sizes have gone from pixel sizes to 
commercial products up to 1 m2 in size.
	
The development of organic chemistry in this area, as well as 
the increased knowledge of both the deposition and interaction 
processes of the materials involved in the structures, have 
contributed to such an incredible advancement of OPV technology. 
Currently, one of the greatest challenges is being able to increase 
the lifetime and stability of the panels and substantially reduce the 
costs of the device components in order to develop the market in its 
innumerable applications beyond the technology itself.
	
In general, it is essential to remember that it may very likely be 
necessary to consider different device options depending on the 
target latitude and application. This is due to different application 
requirements in terms of stability, efficiency, and costs.
	
A final fundamental point is to be able to convert the recent 
progress in efficiency and make them feasible in production with 
acceptable costs and applicable to a market that increasingly asks

for solutions with low environmental impact as well as renewable.
	
MHP is hailed by many as the ‘wonder’ semiconductor for 
photovoltaics and beyond. However, after more than a decade of 
intense research activities, some concerns remain about whether 
this rising star of solar energy technology will eventually reach 
the commercialization phase or will remain just a laboratory 
breakthrough.
	
The toxicity of the Pb-based precursors in the most efficient MHP 
compositions represents a significant impediment to the commercial 
viability of MHPs. The regulations currently in force worldwide on 
the allowed content of Pb in electronics can be hardly ignored when 
considering real applications, especially if the devices are located 
indoors and/or next to the end-user, like in portable electronics 
or IoT devices. Sn belongs to the same group as Pb in the periodic 
table. Therefore, Sn-based perovskites show similar optoelectronic 
properties to Pb and are certainly the most promising MHPs among 
the Pb-free alternatives. On the other hand, the swift oxidation 
in the air of Sn cation makes this material not ideal for practical 
applications. Several recent works have highlighted the potential of 
emerging perovskite derivatives that, despite not having the ABX3 
composition and not crystallizing in the structure of MHPs, can 
replicate their electronic structure.
	
The stability of MHP-based optoelectronics is probably the major 
bottleneck when thinking of their potential commercialization. MHPs 
are soft ionic materials prone to intrinsic degradation, particularly 
caused by crystalline defects, stoichiometry, and ion migration 
through the perovskite film. The halide ion vacancies are strongly 
affecting the mobility of halide species within the films during 
the device operation. The mixed halide compositions have been 
recently leading to the highest performance in solar cells. Yet, these 
materials are also more prone to halide migration toward the grain 
boundaries. As a result, the films undergo phase segregation under 
photoexcitation, which consists of the formation of heterogeneous 
regions in the perovskite film with different halide compositions 
and, thus, different bandgaps.
	
Compositions beyond the ABX3 stoichiometry are becoming very 
popular as low-dimensional (2D, 1D, and 0D) organic-inorganic 
perovskites with reduced ion migration and, in turn, enhanced 
stability. Nevertheless, the is still plenty of room for compositional 

303
engineering with related tunability of the crystal dimensionality and 
optoelectronic properties.
	
Extrinsic factors such as moisture, heat, oxygen, and UV light 
are also detrimental to the lifetime of MHP-based devices. The 
humidity from the ambient induces the reaction between the water 
molecules and the MHP cations (particularly the organic ones like 
in MAPbI3), in turn forming a hydrate perovskite phase that drives 
the severe structural degradation of the MHP crystal. The exposure 
of MHPs to high temperatures challenges the stable operation of 
the corresponding solar cells. In MAPbI3, the depletion of the highly 
volatile MA cation upon heating leads to the rapid decomposition of 
the perovskite structure. The oxygen-mediated degradation, driven 
by the presence of light, produces the formation of highly reactive 
superoxides from the reaction between the oxygen molecules and 
the photogenerated electrons in the perovskite layer. The effect of 
UV light, which degrades the MHP to PbI2, is exacerbated by the 
presence of moisture and/or oxygen. The replacement of MA cation 
with FA in the FAPbI3 composition has been a winning strategy to 
improve the photostability of MHPs.
	
Despite the huge efforts devoted to increasing the stability 
of MHP and MHP-based optoelectronic devices, there is still a 
long way ahead before reaching the stability of established PV 
technologies. Evidently, intrinsic ion migration as well as thermal-/
photodegradation are the most challenging to eliminate as the effects 
of moisture and oxygen can be dramatically reduced by advanced 
encapsulation strategies.
	
Though it is hard to predict if and when MHPs will replace silicon 
for traditional solar cell applications, there are other emerging 
applications for which perovskite certainly holds a greater promise. 
One such application is indoor photovoltaics, which leverages the 
facile bandgap tunability of MHPs and the easier and more cost-
effective fabrication of large-area flexible devices compared with 
competitor indoor PV technologies. Interestingly, MHP-based 
perovskites have also achieved the highest indoor PCE of 40.1% to 
date. The integration of wide-bandgap PSC onto silicon PVs to form 
a tandem solar device is another interesting application of PSCs 
that can lead to remarkably high PCEs (currently as high as 30%) 
by minimizing carrier thermalization losses. Very recently, the high 
power-to-weight ratio of PSCs, their excellent radiation resistance,

and the possibility to fabricate them on flexible substrates have 
enabled their application for space photovoltaics under different 
conditions. Though this field is in its early infancy, it is developing 
fast and there is hope that the specific requirements (e.g., excellent 
stability in the peculiar space environment) will soon be satisfied. 
Finally, MHPs have shown enormous potential as sensors for 
solvents (such as THF, DMF, H2O), humidity (between 7% and 98%), 
temperature (0–230°C), and gases (e.g., NH3, O2, O3, and HCl) by 
converting the above-discussed weaknesses of perovskites into 
advantages.
	
Considering the relatively young age and the unique properties 
of OPV and MHP technology, it is undeniable that all the ongoing 
academic and industrial research efforts will eventually grant them 
a bright future.

8.1 Introduction
Electric and electronic equipment need energy storage in many 
practical applications. The purpose of an energy storage device is 
to provide electrical energy when the main source of power does 
not deliver the needed energy. This is valid, especially for portable 
devices.
	
In electrochemical energy storage devices, the energy can be 
stored in two different ways, in the volume of the electro-active 
electrode materials (batteries) and on the surface of the electrode 
materials (supercapacitors). The physical structures and phenomena 
are quite similar in batteries and supercapacitors. However, the

principal difference in operation causes some differences in their 
performance. A slower charge-capturing mechanism in the case 
of batteries results in lower power output when compared to 
supercapacitors, where chemical reactions do not take place. On 
the other hand, batteries can have higher energy densities than 
supercapacitors because the ions can penetrate the electrode 
material in large quantities. Further, the lifetimes of batteries are 
lower because the volume changes caused by the penetration of 
charges into the electrode material induce structural fatigue to the 
device structure.
	
The following parameters are commonly used to describe the 
performance and functionality of electrochemical energy storage 
devices:
	
∑	 Storage capacity or charge density (C/l or C/kg)
	
∑	 Energy density (J/kg or Wh/kg)
	
∑	 Power density (W/kg)
	
∑ Voltage efficiency, ratio of output (discharging) voltage, and 
charging voltage
	
∑	 Lifetime, shelf-life (time of becoming unusable), or cycle 
lifetime (charge/discharge cycles)
8.2 Principles of a Cell/Battery
In battery technology, different electrochemical systems are 
available. An electrochemical system consists of an anode material 
(negative terminal), a cathode material (positive terminal), and 
an electrolyte. Because of these combinations and the structure of 
the cell, the electrical properties vary over a wide range. The most 
important properties are:
	
∑	 Cell voltage
	
∑	 Charge contents (capacity)
	
∑	 Load capability
	
∑	 Peak load capability
	
∑	 Cycle ability for rechargeable (secondary) cells
8.2.1 Voltage
Voltage is the difference in the electrical potential between 
the two terminals of an electrochemical cell. It depends on the 

313
Principles of a Cell/Battery
electrochemical system, consisting of the electro-active materials 
of both the electrodes and the electrolyte, open-circuit voltage UOC, 
and the current flowing in the external circuit, closed-circuit voltage 
UCC. The lower voltage limit where the application stops operation is 
called cutoff voltage or end-point voltage.
	
The discharge voltage curve of the electrochemical cell is 
presented in Fig. 8.1. The discharge stops when the end-of-discharge 
voltage Ueod is reached, either at a pulse at tp or at the base load at tb.
Figure 8.1 Discharge voltage curve under continuous and pulse load 
conditions.
8.2.2 Charge “Capacity”
Charge capacity is the charge that is stored in the electro-active 
materials of the electrodes. The real value is defined by the electrode 
having a lower charge. The charge is also reduced when the electro-
active material cannot be discharged completely, for example, 
because of kinetic reasons.
8.2.3 Internal Resistance/Impedance
Impedance is the sum of all impedances of the parts in the 
electrochemical cell, which are connected in parallel or series. 

314
Printable Power Storage: Batteries and Supercapacitors
Impedance depends on the frequency of the electric load. It is 
important to ensure that the voltage drop, which occurs because 
of the impedance, is not too high to make the electronic device 
work. For users’ convenience, the direct current (DC) resistance is 
measured after longer load times (0.2 s up to 2 s). This value is often 
given in component specification sheets.
8.2.4 Pulse Load Capability
Usually, the impedance of a battery cell decreases strongly with 
higher frequencies. Therefore, the impedance for short pulses (up 
to 0.1 s) is much lower than the DC resistance. This is important 
for applications where a high current is drawn for a short time, 
for example, measurement taking in a sensor or wireless data 
transmission. This capability can be derived from the impedance 
spectrum or directly measured.
8.2.5 Cycle Life
During cycling the capacity of a secondary battery decreases. This 
effect is due to the degeneration processes of the electrodes and/
or the electrolyte. It can be reduced by constructive measures. 
Typically, the cycle life is defined by the number of cycles after which 
the residual capacity is 80% of the initial value.
8.2.6 Cell Versus Battery
One storage element is called a cell. It consists of two electrodes, 
a separator, an electrolyte, and a housing that closes the element 
hermetically. If these cells are connected, they are called a battery. 
For batteries, two different ways of connections are possible, serial, 
and parallel. A serial connection is used to increase the battery 
voltage; a parallel connection is used to increase the capacity.
8.2.7 Battery as an Energy Source
Smart Objects that need electrical power usually have a certain 
demand for voltage. It depends on the parts that shall be powered. 
For most parts, like organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), 

315
Principles of a Cell/Battery
application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), and electrochromic 
displays (ECDs) a voltage of 3 V is enough, but there are also parts 
that require a higher voltage. For example, organic field-effect 
transistors (OFETs) may need voltages up to 50 V.
	
Also, the capacity of printed batteries is very important. It 
defines the energy content and insofar as the duration for the use 
of the Smart Object. It can be distinguished between applications 
for primary batteries (single use) and for secondary batteries 
(rechargeable).
	
A primary battery is applicable if the power consumption is so low 
that the charge stored in the battery is enough for the whole lifetime. 
In this case, there is no need to replace the battery or recharge it. 
Alternatively, primary batteries can be used if it is feasible that the 
user changes the primary battery to a new one when necessary.
	
If the power consumption is higher a secondary battery is 
applicable. In this case, it is important to provide the energy for 
recharging, whenever it is needed. That may be from an external 
power source by wire or wireless through some energy-harvesting 
means.
	
The power demand of a device is characterized by its current 
consumption. This can be low over a long period, a base current. For 
example, it is possible to power an electronic device in sleep mode 
or supply a backup current for a memory device.
	
Some other features cause higher currents for a short period. 
For example, current can be needed for taking a measurement by 
an analog-digital converter (ADC) or sending a protocol by wireless 
transmission. The charge needed is the integral of the current over 
time (Q = I◊t).
	
For high peak currents, it must be considered whether the 
internal resistance allows to take the respective currents. It causes a 
voltage drop and leads to a lower cell voltage. If the cell voltage drops 
below a certain level, defined by the consumer, proper function is no 
more guaranteed.
	
If the duration of the peak current is below 1 s the impedance 
of the cell must be regarded. The impedance can be measured as a 
function of the frequency. It shows that each battery has a certain 
capacity that allows for a short time (some milliseconds) to draw a 
current that is much higher than the DC.

8.3 Principles of a Supercapacitor
8.3.1 Conventional Capacitors
A capacitor is defined as a device where opposite charges are 
accumulated at a certain distance. The amount of charge and the 
distance give the resulting capacity. The capacitance of a conventional 
capacitor is defined by
	
C
A
d
= e e
r 0
,
(8.1)
where ε0 is vacuum permittivity, εr is the relative permittivity of 
the dielectric material between the electrodes, A is the area of the 
capacitor electrode, and d is the distance of the electrodes. For typical 
capacitors that have areas of some square meters and dielectric 
thicknesses of down to 1 µm, the capacitance values can be up to 
several µFs, at usual geometries. A thinner dielectric thickness can 
be achieved by using oxide layers, for example, on aluminum foils in 
the electrolyte (electrolytic capacitor) where capacitances up to 1 
mF can be achieved.
8.3.2 Supercapacitor Structure
Recently the use of capacitors that are based on an electrochemical 
double layer (EDL) instead of a dielectric layer has been increasing. 
In the EDL the ions in the electrolyte accumulate to the close vicinity 
of the opposite electrode surfaces. The separation of charges in 
the EDL (also known as the Helmholtz layer) is very small, in the 
nanometer range, which leads to very high capacitances. This type of 
energy storage device is known as an electric double-layer capacitor 
(EDLC).
	
Besides utilizing the electric double layer to store energy, 
supercapacitors can be based on reduction-oxidation (redox) 
reactions on the electrodes, when the device is called a 
pseudocapacitor. It is also possible to make an asymmetric 
device, where one electrode is based on EDL and one on redox 
reactions. These are called hybrid capacitors. Sometimes the 
term ultracapacitor or used as a synonym for supercapacitor. The 

317
Principles of a Supercapacitor
terminology of supercapacitor alternatives is explained in Fig. 8.2. 
Pseudocapacitors and hybrid capacitors typically show performance 
(energy density, power density, lifetime, temperature range, etc.) 
somewhere between batteries and supercapacitors. In this chapter, 
we focus on the comparison of EDLCs and batteries.
Figure 8.2 Supercapacitor types, operational principles, and possible 
electrode materials.
	
The supercapacitor structure based on EDLs is described in 
Fig. 8.3. Supercapacitors consist of two electrodes, an electrolyte 
between them, and usually a porous separator layer. The ions in the 
electrolyte can move in the electrolyte and through the separator 
while the supercapacitor is charging. The specific capacitance 
(C/A) of an EDL is usually of the order of 10 μF/cm2. Commercial 
supercapacitors available today have capacitances up to 5000 F.

Printable Power Storage: Batteries and Supercapacitors
8.3.3 Supercapacitor Parameters
The supercapacitor device is composed of two individual capacitors, 
C1 and C2, which are located on the electrode–electrolyte interface. 
The total capacitance of the device is then defined by
	
C

C
C

(8.2)
	
If the capacitors C1 and C2 are identical the total capacitance is 
C = C1/2. The capacitance of a supercapacitor is often reported per 
mass of electrode material, which is called the specific capacitance 
(in units F/g).
 
The maximum energy stored in a capacitor is given by
	
E
CV
max = 1
2

(8.3)
where V is the voltage over the capacitor. The energy density (in 
units Wh/kg) for supercapacitors can be reported per mass of 
electrode material or the whole device. The maximum energy Emax  
results from the definition of electric power P = IV and the definition 
of capacitance given by
	
Q
CV
=
.	
(8.4)
	
Because of this capacitive behavior, the charge/discharge curve 
of the supercapacitor shows linear voltage versus time dependency. 
This is a disadvantage of supercapacitors when compared with 
batteries. For many applications, for example, OLEDs, a fairly constant 
voltage plateau is required and thus in the case of supercapacitors, a 
DC/DC converter is needed.
	
Another important parameter in addition to capacitance is 
an internal resistance RS (also called equivalent series resistance 
[ESR]). RS is caused largely by the electrolyte and separator through 
which the ions have to travel when charging/discharging the device. 
Also, current collectors and contact resistances contribute to the 
ESR.
 
The maximum power Pmax  that the supercapacitor can produce 
is determined by connecting the supercapacitor with a load resistor 
having the same resistance as the ESR of the supercapacitor in series. 
The maximum power is thus given by

(8.5)
	
This power is usually reported per mass of electrode 
material and is called the specific power or the power density (in 
units W/kg).
8.3.4 Electrical Characterization of Supercapacitors
A conventional way to characterize the electrochemical behavior 
of a supercapacitor is cyclic voltammetry, which can be performed 
using an electrochemical workstation equipped with a potentiostat. 
A cyclic voltammogram (CV) curve shows the current that 
develops in the electrochemical cell while the potential difference 
of electrodes is linearly varied. CV measurement can be done in 
either three-electrode or two-electrode configurations, which 
have some significant differences. Three-electrode electrochemical 
cells, containing a working electrode, a reference electrode, and a 
counter electrode, are generally used for electrochemical material 
analysis. The potential is measured between the so-called reference 
and working electrodes, while the current is measured between 
the working and counter electrodes. The purpose of the counter 
electrode is to allow accurate measurements to be made between the 
working and reference electrodes. The role of the counter electrode is 
to ensure that current does not run through the reference electrode, 
since such a flow would change the reference electrode’s potential.
 
An example of a CV curve measured for a solution-processed 
carbon nanotube (CNT) supercapacitor in the two-electrode 
configuration is presented in Fig. 8.4a. In this figure, the y-axis 
shows the current divided by the voltage scan rate, which is also the 
capacitance value of the supercapacitor (unit As/V = F). The charge 
storage capacitance of the device can be, in principle, obtained from 
the area closed by the CV curve. In a symmetrical two-electrode cell, 
the counter electrode and the reference electrode are connected, and 
the potential differences applied to each electrode are equal to each 
other, that is, one-half of the values in the case of the three-electrode 
cell. The twice-larger voltage range in a three-electrode cell results 
in a doubling of the capacitance calculated from the CV curve area. 
Principles of a Supercapacitor

320
Printable Power Storage: Batteries and Supercapacitors
Even when using a two-electrode configuration for measuring the 
device capacitance, there are other sources of errors. Due to the 
resistive losses in the system, the voltage-scanning rate changes the 
shape and size of the CV curve, which then results in large errors in 
the capacitance calculated from the CV.
Figure 8.4 (a) A CV curve and galvanostatic discharge curves for measuring 
(b) capacitance C and (c) series resistance RS for the carbon nanotube–based 
supercapacitor. Figure taken from Ref. [20].
	
A galvanostatic measurement, which is based on keeping a 
constant current over the electrolytic cell, can be used to overcome 
the drawbacks of CV measurement. On the basis of the industrial 
standard IEC 62391-1, the supercapacitor capacitance can be 
measured reliably using the constant current discharge method. 

321
This galvanostatic discharge measurement procedure is presented 
in Fig. 8.5. The supercapacitor is expected to be fully charged after 
30 min in constant voltage VR. After this, the device is discharged 
with a constant current Idischarge. Capacitance can then be determined 
from the galvanostatic curve with the equation

galvanostatic discharge curves measured for a solution-processed 
CNT supercapacitor are presented in Fig. 8.4b–c.

parameters. Figure taken from Ref. [12].
8.3.5 Comparison of Supercapacitor and Battery
Supercapacitors are energy storage devices that have a large 
power density and a long cycle life. Compared with Li-ion batteries, 
supercapacitors have hundreds of times longer cycle lives and 
Principles of a Supercapacitor

322
Printable Power Storage: Batteries and Supercapacitors
over 10 times larger power densities, leading also to much shorter 
charging times. Supercapacitors have approximately 10 times lower 
energy density compared to batteries. A comparison of different 
types of electrochemical devices is shown in Fig. 8.6.
Figure 8.6 A Ragone plot of different energy conversion and storage devices.
	
In a battery, the charge is stored in the volume of the electro-
active materials. The electrochemical process takes place on the 
surface in contact with the electrolyte. Therefore, the electrolyte 
needs a high ionic conductivity. The required electrons must be 
conducted to or away from the point of electrochemistry. This 
requires a suitable percolative network. Especially in the cathode, 
which typically consists of oxide materials, conducting agents are 
necessary. Therefore, the charges cannot be stored at high speed, but 
the amount of charge that can be stored in the lattice is much higher. 
Because of these fundamental considerations, the application range 
of both elements can be defined.
	
∑	 Capacitors are useful if a charge shall be stored or discharged 
at a high rate in a short time. Typical applications are the flash 
of a mobile phone, which is realized by a light-emitting diode 
(LED) that can stand a very high current for a very short time.

323
	
∑	 Batteries are used if a high amount of charge is needed over a 
long time. This is the case for most Smart Objects.
	
The more recent development of electrochemical energy storage 
devices has led to battery/supercapacitor hybrid constructions that 
are aiming at combining the advantages of both devices at once. 
The battery provides a high-energy density to the storage system, 
whereas an active converter controls the energy flow from the 
battery to a coupled supercapacitor, which, on the other hand, can 
provide a high output peak power to the load.
8.4 Printed Battery Architectures
The performance of a battery strongly depends on the construction. 
Especially the length of the ion path in the electrolyte is important 
for the DC resistance. In principle, there are two different structures, 
which are described next.
8.4.1 Stacked Assembly
In a stacked assembly the components of the printed battery are 
stacked face-to-face, as presented in Fig. 8.7. Usually both electrodes 
are built up on both substrates, one for the positive and one for the 
negative electrode.
 
In the first step, the current collectors are printed on both sides 
and printed layers are dried (or baked/cured). Next, the electrode 
materials are printed on the current collectors, the anode material 
to the negative terminal, and the cathode material to the positive 
terminal, and then dried.
	
The electrode/separator combination can be applied in two 
ways. In the case of a liquid electrolyte, similar to state-of-the-art 
cells, a separator sheet has to be cut and placed on the electrode. It 
should be fixed with a little drop of glue for further processing. Then 
the electrolyte is injected on top of the separator and soaked during 
a waiting step.
	
In the case of a solid electrolyte, the paste is printed directly on 
both electrodes. After a drying step, the cell can be further processed. 
Then the electrolyte is not completely dried but has a rubber-like 
consistency.
Printed Battery Architectures

324
Printable Power Storage: Batteries and Supercapacitors
Figure 8.7 Components of a stacked printed battery assembly.
	
The last step is the printing of a glue frame to seal the battery 
hermetically. After the glue has dried, both parts are assembled and 
closed by lamination, hot embossing, or ultrasonic welding.
	
In Fig. 8.8, the deposition of the components of the printed battery 
is done on the same substrate. This substrate has a perforation in the 
middle axis to fold it easily. In another construction, both electrodes 
are printed on different substrate strips and led together directly 
before the lamination. In this case, the registration (alignment) is 
very important.

substrate.

In the stacked configuration presented in Fig. 8.9, the way of the 
ions through the electrolyte is very short. It can be in the order of 
10–20 µm. Also, the area of the electrodes face-to-face is very large. 
Therefore, the internal resistance of this construction is very low. An 
example of the printed stacked battery is shown in Fig. 8.10.

configuration.

device was fabricated in Hochschule der Medien (HdM), Stuttgart, Germany.
8.4.2 Co-planar Assembly
In the co-planar assembly presented in Fig. 8.11, the electrodes are 
printed next to each other on the same substrate, having a small gap 
between them. Then the separator/electrolyte is placed on both 
electrodes, including the gap. Also, a solid electrolyte can be applied.

The ions move through the electrolyte from one electrode to 
the other. At the beginning of the discharging sequence, the ions 
travel the shortest bath, which is the size of the gap between two 
electrodes, which can be seen in Fig. 8.12. The internal resistance is 
then low when the electrode material close to the gap is discharged. 
Later during the discharging progress, the path through which 
the ions have to move gets longer and longer, which continuously 
increases the internal resistance.

planar configuration.

An example of a co-planar nickel/metal hydride battery is 
presented in Fig. 8.13. It shows both electrodes, of which the positive 
is the green one. They are printed on a current collector of silver 
covered with a thin layer of carbon.

device was fabricated in HdM, Stuttgart, Germany.
	
The advantages and disadvantages of stacked and co-planar 
battery configurations are compared in Table 8.1. A serial connection 
is easily possible for both cases.

The serial connection of a stacked battery is presented in 
Fig. 8.14. The current collector is printed on top of the step to connect 
the negative electrode of one cell with the positive electrode of the 
next cell.

The serial connection of a co-planar battery is presented in 
Fig. 8.15. The positive electrode and the negative electrode of the 
cell beneath are printed on the same current collector. Then the 
electrolyte is printed on both electrodes of each cell, including the 
gap. It has to be made sure that the electrolytes of neighboring cells 
do not contact each other.
Figure 8.15 Serial connection of co-planar cells.
8.4.3 Liquid Electrolyte
Usually, batteries use liquid or slightly gel-type electrolytes. These 
provide high ionic conductivity. They also migrate into the pores of 
the electrodes in a short time. Thus, the ions can be transported to 
or from the point of the electrochemical reaction easily. On the other 
hand, the liquid electrolyte tends to spread along the surfaces of the 
casing and may generate leakage. Especially the KOH electrolyte 
shows this type of behavior, and thus it cannot easily be encapsulated.
	
One more aspect is the mechanical property. The liquid 
electrolyte cannot transfer forces. So, the electrodes are not 
mechanically connected. They can move along each other and create 
damage in this way. If inside the packaging a small amount of gas is 
generated, it causes an increase in the thickness. There is a bubble 
between the electrodes, which interrupts the ionic contact between 
the electrodes. This defect is called pillowing.
8.4.4 Solid Electrolyte
These problems are widely avoided by a solid electrolyte. This is an 
electrolyte/separator paste that has high conductivity and a high 
amount of gelling agent. Such an electrolyte can be printed easily.

329
	
After a short drying period, the paste shows a highly viscous, 
rubber-like form. The electrolyte is partly soaked by the electrodes. 
Then both the half-cells are assembled and laminated by applying 
pressure and heat. After this procedure, both half-cells stick 
together very strongly. The interface between the electrodes is thin 
and has a high adherence. This way a high ionic conductivity can be 
reached. The printed battery forms a solid body that can stand many 
mechanical impacts.
8.4.5 Battery Materials
In principle, there is a large variety of materials that can be used in 
batteries. However, because of a set of requirements, some typical 
materials have shown to be best suitable for the cells. The selection 
of anode, cathode, and electrolyte materials determines the electrical 
behavior of the whole cell.
	
The purpose of the anode is to deliver electrons to the negative 
terminals when the electro-active material is oxidized. While 
recharging the direction of the processes is vice versa. For high-
energy efficiency, the electro-active materials must be completely 
consumed at the end of discharge. During the charging process, the 
reduced materials shall deposit at the same places where they were 
before the discharge, which means dimensional stability and no 
shape change. This is important for cyclability. This can be achieved 
by using host lattices where the reduced atoms are intercalated. 
Typical anode materials are listed in Table 8.2.

The purpose of the cathode is to take electrons from the positive 
terminals when the electro-active material is reduced. While 
Printed Battery Architectures

recharging the direction of the processes is vice versa. The cathode 
materials typically are metal oxides where the metal atoms change 
their oxidation states. Here a shape change is not expected. The 
oxides for the host lattice for hydrogen or lithium atoms are stable 
in shape. For all rechargeable electrodes, the volume effect has to be 
taken into account. Typically, the lattice of the host expands when the 
atoms are intercalated. This can lead to mechanical destruction of 
the electrode and insofar as capacity loss. Typical cathode materials 
are listed in Table 8.3.

be in the order of 1 M. Typical electrolytes are listed in Table 8.4.

8.5 Printed Supercapacitor Architectures
8.5.1 Printable High–Surface Area Materials
The most common material used in supercapacitor electrodes is 
activated carbon, which is very porous and relatively inexpensive, 
although its conductivity is so low that in high-power applications 
it has to be blended with more conductive materials and a metallic 
current collector must be used.
	
A very promising new direction has been found in carbon 
nanomaterials, mostly CNTs and graphene, whose high electrical 
conductivity and nano-porous structure result in low ESR and high 
capacitance. Interesting new solutions are composite materials 
where 
materials 
facilitating 
electrochemical 
reactions 
are 
combined with the high conductivity of CNTs or graphene to make 
pseudocapacitors and hybrid capacitors.
8.5.2 Printable Supercapacitor Structure
In principle, the various layouts suitable for batteries can be applied 
also with supercapacitors. Examples of the structures are shown in 
Fig. 8.16.
 
In the stacked structure, the current collectors are first printed on 
a substrate or alternatively, an electrically conducting substrate can 
be used. The next step is printing the electrodes. Then two similar 
halves are assembled face-to-face with a separator between the 
electrodes, the electrolyte is added to fill the pores in the electrodes 
and separator and the structure is sealed/laminated around the 
electrode area.
	
To avoid the assembling/laminating of two separate electrodes, 
another alternative is to print all layers on top of each other to 
make a monolithic structure. Also, an interdigitated structure can 
be manufactured without laminating the electrodes face-to-face. 
All structures demand sealing, in the monolithic and interdigitated 
structure after adding the electrolyte a cover is simply assembled 
with an adhesive.
Printed Supercapacitor Architectures

Printable Power Storage: Batteries and Supercapacitors
Figure 8.16 Supercapacitor structures: Stacked face-to-face (left), monolithic (middle), and interdigitated (right).

333
	
The stacked and monolithic structures obviously have a short 
distance between the electrodes which minimizes the effect of 
electrolyte ionic resistance to the ESR. Thus, the interdigitated 
structure with a larger distance between electrodes is more suitable 
in applications where high power is not needed. In the monolithic 
structure, the challenge is to make the required inks compatible and 
to prevent upper layers from penetrating the lower porous layers 
during the printing process.
	
There are several studies where supercapacitor electrodes 
are made from solution-processed materials. Various solution-
processing methods, such as inkjet printing, screen printing, spray 
coating, doctor blading, bar coating, dip coating, painting, and brush-
on coating, have been demonstrated. These solution-processing 
methods can be scaled up to roll-to-roll mass production where 
actual printing techniques are used.
	
Figure 8.17 shows a photograph of a monolithic supercapacitor 
and a scanning electron micrograph of supercapacitor electrodes 
and separator.

cross-section micrograph showing the structure of activated carbon powder 
electrodes and the separator between them. Micrograph from Tampere 
Microscopy Center.
	
In the photo, the structure of the supercapacitor is similar to 
the monolithic one shown in Fig. 8.16. The supercapacitor is made 
on PET/Al substrate on the PET side. Thus, the Al layer acts only 
as a barrier to keep the electrolyte hermetically sealed. The current 
collectors are made of graphite ink, electrodes of activated carbon 
bound with chitosan, and the separator of chitosan and talc. From 
Printed Supercapacitor Architectures

334

the figure, it can be estimated that the particle size of activated 
carbon is of the order of a few micrometers. However, each of these 
particles is extremely porous allowing the electrolyte to penetrate 
inside the particles.
8.6 Challenges of Printed Electrochemical 
Systems
The printability of different electrochemical systems depends on a 
selected set of materials and the architecture. Here we summarize 
some aspects that determine whether the energy storage device is 
printable or not. Table 8.5 summarizes different battery chemistries 
and their suitability for printing.

In general, porous electrodes can be easily printed. After drying 
the electrodes made of electro-active materials, binders, and solvents 
form a porous body that can act as an electrode. Air electrodes have 
very complicated structures and insofar are considered not to be 
printable with today’s skills.
 
Cells using an organic electrolyte are difficult to print because 
they require an inert atmosphere. Organic electrolytes should not 
be exposed to oxygen during the whole manufacturing chain before 
the closing of the cell. Printing production lines with a special 
atmosphere are quite complicated to build. Further, especially 

335
the encapsulation should have barrier properties in the order of 
10–6 g/m²day H2O permeation.
	
Obtaining a fully printable power storage device, where the 
electrodes and the separator are monolithically printed on top of 
each other, is difficult due to the need for a printed separator. The 
challenge in printed separators is the probability of having pinholes 
that can cause short-circuiting of the electrodes.
8.7 Integration of Printed Batteries and 
Supercapacitors in Smart Objects
For the integration of printable Power Storage Devices (PSDs), there 
are in principle two technologies
	
∑	 Attaching the PSD to the printed Smart Object
	
	 In this case, the PSD is separately produced and supplied to 
the final Smart Object
	
∑	 Printegration
	
Here the PSD is directly printed to the Smart Object
	
Both techniques have their advantages and disadvantages. The 
decision has to be made from case to case.
8.7.1 Attaching the PSD to the Smart Object
This technic was investigated in the A3Ple project (FP7, Contract No. 
262782). The principle is shown in Fig. 8.18.
 
The Smart Object, for example, a printed sensor, is printed step 
by step on the substrate. Finally, the pre-fabricated PSD is attached. 
This can be delivered on a separate liner tape or from a stack by 
Pick-and-Place.
Advantages:
	
∑	 The PSD can be produced using special machines
	
∑	 It can be tested with a 100% control, high yield
	
∑	 The voltage is applied to the Smart Object in the last step
Disadvantages:
	
∑ The production of a separate PSD is more expensive
	
∑	 Usually, Pick-and-Place processes are slower.
	
So, this technic will be used for higher-value objects.

8.7.2 Printegration of the PSD
In this case the PSD is printed directly to the Smart Object. Examples 
were investigated in the INNPAPER project (H2020. Contract No. 
760876).

In this case, the PSD is directly printed on the substrate in the 
course of the production. The contact with the electronics has to be 
interrupted first to avoid the voltage destroying the printing during 
production. The contact must be closed when activating the Smart 
Object.
Advantages
	
∑	 Production is cheaper and faster
Disadvantage:
	
∑	 More printing steps, reduced yield
	
∑	 Only simple designs of the PSD are possible
	
∑	 Reduced overall yield when the PSD fails
8.7.3 Examples
One example of a printegrated battery is given by ELMERIC and 
shows a zinc carbon battery directly printed on a substrate with an 
antenna.

∑	 A chip

typical machines.

9.1 Introduction
In this chapter, we review the fundamentals and the working 
principles of sensors supported by some examples of printed sensors 
on foil. Fabrication of sensors using 3D printing and integration of 
sensors into smart systems are also briefly addressed. This chapter 
is not an exhaustive review of the state of the art in printed sensors 
but an introduction to the field of sensors and their implementation 
using organic and printed electronics technologies. After having 
introduced the definition of a sensor, its main characteristics as 
well as its different working principles, we will focus on concrete 
developments of printed bio, chemical, and physical sensors.

Printed Sensors and Sensing Systems
	
Since the early 1980s, we have seen a strong growth of 
micro-electro-mechanical sensors (MEMSs) based on silicon 
semiconductor and micromachining technologies. Several of these 
devices, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, pressure, microphones, 
and temperature and humidity sensors, have already reached the 
consumer electronics markets. Generally speaking, sensing devices 
produced using organic and printed electronics (OPE) technologies 
cannot meet the level of performance obtained with silicon sensors. 
However, thanks to OPE, sensors, and smart sensing systems 
with unique characteristics such as flexibility, conformability, 
transparency, biocompatibility, disposability, wearability, and 
the possibility of fabrication over a large area, can be envisioned. 
This is being done in complementarity to silicon technology and 
not in competition. OPE is characterized by the use of more eco-
friendly materials and, also thanks to the employment of additive 
and low-temperature processes, is leading to the production of 
more sustainable sensing and electronic systems. In the case of the 
production of a high number of sensor components or intelligent 
sensing surfaces, OPE can become very attractive with the use of 
cost-effective large-area manufacturing techniques.
	
The attractiveness of OPE to realize sensors has been reflected 
by a major growth in the number of scientific publications that 
started in the mid-2000. Organic and printed sensors market has 
been predicted to grow fast in the coming years: several types of 
sensors, strain/pressure, temperature, light, humidity, gas, and 
biological, have been implemented on flexible substrates and using 
printing processes. Some of them, such as temperature, light, force, 
strain, touch, skin electrodes, and glucose sensors are currently 
being commercialized.
	
Fully printed sensors are more and more reported but significant 
R&D and production efforts are still required. Most sensing systems 
are currently built using a hybrid integration effort which involves 
the use of CMOS electronics components in combination with OPE 
devices. In applications in which a high sensor production volume 
or large sensing area will be required, one can expect that large-area 
manufacturing at low-cost, going toward an all-printing approach, 
will be the solution of choice. However, their encapsulation, which 
is very sensor-type specific, their integration into systems, and 
also their calibration are aspects that will not be addressed in this

chapter but deserve special attention for the successful development 
of commercially exploitable sensors solutions.
9.2 Sensors Fundamentals
9.2.1 Definition and Classification
A sensor is part of a measurement system that employs physical 
or (bio)chemical properties in order to obtain quantitative data 
that can be processed in different ways. Simply put, a sensor is 
therefore a device able to detect and quantify a stimulus present 
in the external environment and provide a measurable response 
(usually in the form of an electric signal). The stimulus detected 
by the sensor is called the measurand which is the physical or 
(bio)chemical quantity to be measured (force, light intensity, ion 
concentration…). Detection and quantification of the measurand 
typically occur through a transduction process in which the physical 
or (bio)chemical stimulus is transformed in some form of electrical 
signal. The sensor’s response can be either digital or analog. In 
the case of digital sensors, the signal produced by the sensor is a 
string of binary digits while for analog sensors the signal produced 
is continuous, both in time and amplitude and directly proportional 
to the measurand. Generally speaking, sensor outputs are analog 
signals that require some processing (including analog-to-digital 
transformation). In terms of energy required to perform the 
transduction process, sensors may be classified either as active or 
passive devices. Active sensors (or modulating sensors) require 
an external source of power (usually in the form of an excitation 
voltage) that provides the majority of the output power of the signal 
(see Fig. 9.1a). In such sensors, the energy of the output signal is 
the sum of the energy of the input signal and the external energy 
minus the energy used for transduction. For passive sensors (or 
self-generating/self-exciting sensors), the output power is almost 
entirely provided by the measured signal without an excitation 
voltage (see Fig. 9.1b). In this case, the output signal energy is 
simply the difference between the energy of the input signal and 
that required for transduction. Examples of passive sensors are 
thermocouples, which produce an electromotive force (emf) from 

346

the difference in junction temperatures, and piezoelectric crystals, 
which thanks to the piezoelectric effect convert mechanical strain 
into electrical charges.

There are a number of different criteria that are used for 
classifying sensors, the following is a non-exhaustive list:
	
∑	 Physical or (bio)chemical effect/transduction principle
	
∑	 Principal form of signals
	
∑	 Measurand (primary input variable)
	
∑	 Technology and material
	
∑	 Application(s)
	
∑	 Size (nano, micro, milli, macro)
	
∑	 Characteristics (sensitivity, accuracy, etc.)
	
∑	 Cost
	
Criteria selection is strongly dependent on the type of user. For 
students, it might be adequate to use the classification by principle. 
For application engineers, it may be desired to class the sensors by 
measurand or application. For development engineers, technology, 
size, cost, and characteristics might be more of interest.
	
When classifying sensors according to the nature of the measured 
quantity, this provides the following distinction is obtained:
	
∑	 Physical sensors
	
∑	 Chemical sensors
	
∑	 Biological sensors

347
Sensors Fundamentals
	
For all of them, the measurement principles can be of physical, 
chemical, or biological nature. For example, the measurement of 
the concentration of a given gas using the shift in frequency of a 
resonator (due to a change in mass) is a chemical sensor based on a 
physical working principle.
	
If we look at the principal form of stimuli, we can distinguish six 
classes:
	
∑	 Mechanical
	
∑	 Thermal
	
∑	 Electrical
	
∑	 Magnetic
	
∑	 Radiant
	
∑	 Chemical
	
∑	 Biological
	
A number of examples for each class are given in Table 9.1.

Sensors’ behavior and performances are described via a set of 
parameters that are derived from measurement sciences. These 
characteristics are reviewed in the next subsection.
9.2.2 Sensors Characteristics
We will review in this section the main parameters that can be used 
to characterize the behavior and the performances of sensors. We 
will go through a set of definitions for the main static (sensitivity, 
accuracy, 
resolution, 
reproducibility, 
repeatability, 
linearity, 
saturation, hysteresis, drift, noise, range or span) and dynamic 
(transient  response, response time, recovery time, frequency 
response, rise time) sensors characteristics.
	
The response curve (also called the “input–output” curve) is a 
very valuable source of information about the features of a sensor. 
It is normally obtained by recording the sensor’s response (output) 
as a function of the measurand (M, input) to which the sensor is 
exposed to. Figure 9.2 shows an example of a response curve with 
a linear behavior that gradually converges toward saturation. This 
type of behavior is called a Langmuir-like response.
Figure 9.2 Example of a generic sensor response curve (From A. D’Amico et al. 
(2015), see Further Readings ). Mm is the measurand value corresponding to the 
signal-to-noise ratio equal to one.
	
The response of a sensor can be expressed considering either 
the absolute signal (Vout) of the sensor or the difference in the signal 
(Vout – V0) due to the exposure to the measurand, V0 being the output 
signal without the application of the measurand (V0 is usually called 
the sensor’s “zero offset”). The relative response (Vout – V0) / V0, 

349
Sensors Fundamentals
which is unitless, is interesting to compare sensors having responses 
with either different measurement units or different output ranges. 
The differential and relative responses can be used to counteract 
the drift of the signal baseline. The baseline is the electrical signal 
from a sensor when no measured variable is present1 while drift is 
here the low-frequency change of the sensor baseline with time. The 
smallest measurand, the limit of detection for a chemical sensor, is 
determined by the noise level (VN). The noise is a random deviation 
of the signal that varies in time.
	
We will now go through different definitions characterizing the 
response of a sensor.
Sensitivity: Variation of the sensor signal as a function of the variation 
of the measurand. The sensitivity is the derivative of the response 
curve. For a non-linear response curve as in Fig. 9.2, the sensitivity 
is a function of the measurand value. When the response curve is 
linear the sensitivity is given by
	
S = DV/DM	
(9.1)
Resolution: Minimal amount of measurand change that produces a 
measurable signal. It corresponds to the ability of a sensor to see 
small differences in readings. The resolution of a sensing system 
must be better than the final accuracy the measurement requires. 
The primary determining factor of resolution is electrical noise. The 
resolution is given in the unit of the measure of the measurand, and 
therefore at the opposite of the response curve and sensitivity, the 
resolution enables the comparison among sensors.
Accuracy: Refers to the closeness of a measured value to a standard 
or known value. A set of measurements performed with an accurate 
sensor has a mean value very close to the “real” value of the 
measurand.
Precision: Refers to the closeness of two or more measurements to 
each other. A set of measurements performed with a precise sensor 
has a very small standard deviation.
1The baseline is therefore defined the same way as the sensor’s zero offset. One 
should notice, however, that the term “baseline” is usually employed when performing 
dynamic measurements (i.e., when recording the sensor’s output signal over time) 
while the word “zero offset” is typically used when referring to the input-output curve. 

350
Printed Sensors and Sensing Systems
Reproducibility and repeatability: Two extreme conditions of 
precision. Repeatability describes the minimum and reproducibility 
the maximum variability in sensor output.
Repeatability: Variability between sets of measurements taken over 
a short time interval.
Reproducibility: Variability between sets of measurements but 
performed over a long time interval or by different operators/
laboratories.
Linearity: Ability to generate an output signal that is directly 
proportional to the input signal (Fig. 9.3). Linearity error (also 
known as “sensor’s nonlinearity”) describes the maximum deviation 
of the output of a device from a best-fitting straight line through the 
calibration data.
Saturation: Every sensor has its operating limits. Even if it is 
considered linear, at some levels of the input stimuli, its output signal 
no longer will be responsive. Further, an increase in stimulus does 
not produce a desirable output variation. It is said that the sensor 
exhibits a span-end nonlinearity or saturation (Fig. 9.3).
Figure 9.3 Response curve with two distinct response regions: linear span and 
saturation.
Hysteresis: Difference between the “upsweep” response curve 
(acquired for increasing measurand values) and the “downsweep” 
response curve (acquired for decreasing measurand values).
Drift: Slow variation in the sensor output (mostly due to baseline 
shift) over long periods. Methods to account for sensor drift include 
periodic calibration, predictive aging (or pre-aging the sensor), and 
historical data logging combined with the use of filters.

351
Noise: In electronics, noise is a random fluctuation in an electrical 
signal.
Range or span:2 Maximum and minimum value range over which a 
sensor works according to optimal, predetermined specifications. 
Every sensor is designed to work over a specified range. The design 
ranges are usually fixed and, if exceeded, may result in permanent 
damage to or destruction of a sensor.
Dynamic range or span: The range of input physical signals that may 
be converted to electrical signals by the sensor is the dynamic range or 
span signals, outside of this range is expected to cause unacceptably 
large inaccuracy (specified sensitivity is not guaranteed).
Transient  response: Response of a system to a change from 
equilibrium (Fig. 9.4).

Figure 9.4 Transient response of an ideal sensor system, with linear 1st order 
behavior (Vm: maximum, Vb: baseline).
Speed of response: Indicates how fast a sensor can react to a change in 
input. Speed of response may be specified in terms of time constant 
t : it is a measure of the sensor’s inertia that can be determined 
experimentally from the transient response to step input. The sensor 
output reaches 63% of the final value after t = t (see Fig. 9.4).
2Some authors make a distinction between the range, which is a couple of input 
values (the maximum and the minimum values), and the span which is the absolute 
value of the difference between the aforementioned maximum and minimum values. 
For instance, a pressure sensor supposed to optimally work between 10 mPa and 
30 mPa has a range of [10 mPa – 30 mPa] and a span of 20 mPa.

352
Printed Sensors and Sensing Systems
Response time: The time for a sensor to respond from no load to a 
step change in load; usually specified as the time to rise to 90% of 
the final value, measured from the onset of step input change in the 
measured variable.
Recovery time: The time for a sensor to return to baseline value 
after the step removal of the measured variable; usually specified 
as the time to fall to 10% of the final value after step removal of the 
measured variable.
	
One essential point in sensors technology is therefore the 
calibration of the devices to assess the different parameters 
addressed above. Sensors must be calibrated against some 
standard so that the results can be relied upon and compared to 
other observations. Another important aspect is the reliability and 
stability of the devices over time which is of prime importance in 
most applications. Software and electronics can be used in several 
cases to compensate for variations in the behavior of a sensor over 
time.
9.3 Sensors Typologies and Examples of Printed 
Sensors
Sensors are devices able to provide a measurable output in response 
to the modification of a certain physical or chemical quantity. For this 
reason, they are ubiquitous in our life: any human activity that needs 
to identify and quantify a certain parameter relies on the utilization 
of some types of sensors. There exists an enormous number of 
sensors so for practical purposes it is customary to group sensors 
into typologies. One of the most utilized criteria to classify a sensor 
takes into account the nature of the measurand, that is, the type 
of signal that the sensor can detect and quantify. According to this 
criterion, sensors may be roughly grouped into two categories: (i) 
physical sensors (capable of measuring physical quantities such as 
temperature, position, speed, strain, and pressure); (ii) biochemical 
sensors (capable of measuring biological and/or chemical signals 
such as pH, ions concentration, the concentration of biologically 
relevant molecules in a given sample). The following part of the 
chapter is organized according to this criterion, with a first section 
devoted to physical sensors and a second section dedicated to 

353
biochemical sensors. Each section will be introduced by a concise 
description of the transduction mechanisms involved and their 
mathematical formulation then a brief overview of the application 
of printing techniques in the fabrication of that typology of sensors 
will follow. Finally, meaningful examples of printed sensors will be 
described more in detail for each section.
9.3.1 Physical Sensors
9.3.1.1 Temperature sensors
Temperature sensors are devices capable of measuring the 
temperature of their environment. In the field of printed electronics, 
almost all reported temperature sensors are based on a resistive 
transduction principle, that is, temperature variations are indirectly 
measured by measuring the variations of electrical resistance they 
induce; such sensors are therefore called resistive temperature 
sensors.
	
The electrical resistance R (expressed in Ohms Ω) of an object 
is a physical parameter describing the opposition to the passage of 
an electrical current when a voltage is applied across it. Resistance 
depends both on the material composing the object and its 
geometrical shape. For an object with a uniform cross-section area A 
and length l, its resistance can be expressed as follows:
	
R
l
A
= r
	
(9.2)
where ρ is an intrinsic property of the material called electrical 
resistivity (expressed in Ω × m).
	
For many materials, for a given temperature range, electrical 
resistivity depends linearly on temperature and the relationship 
between these two quantities can be described as follows:

where ρ(T) is resistivity at a temperature T, ρ0 is resistivity at a fixed 
temperature T0 (usually 25 °C) and α0 is the temperature coefficient 
of resistance (TCR) (measured in K–1 or °C–1).
	
Several different techniques and materials have been employed so 
far for the fabrication of printed thermistors; in most cases, flexible, 
plastic sheets were used as substrates. Conductive polymers and metal 
Sensors Typologies and Examples of Printed Sensors

and carbon particles-based inks have been used for the fabrication 
of this type of sensor, either by screen or inkjet printing. Among the 
conductive polymers most commonly used for the fabrication of 
resistive temperature sensors, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) 
polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) seems to be the most frequently 
used, either alone or in combination with carbon-based materials. 
Molina-Lopez et al. (2013) realized inkjet-printed silver meander-
shaped resistors on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates; 
the effects of nickel electroplating were also evaluated. The non-
electroplated devices exhibit an extremely linear behavior in the 
considerer range of temperatures [–10 °C, + 60 °C], with a TCR up 
to (6.52 ± 0.05) ¥ 10–4 °C−1; electroplated devices show a better TCR 
(up to (1.82 ± 0.06) ¥ 10–3 °C−1) as can be appreciated in Fig. 9.5.

al. (2013).
	
Britton et al. (2006) reported on the fabrication of thick silicon 
films obtained by nanoparticulate silicon-based inks. These inks 
were fabricated by milling bulk silicon (either n-type or p-type 
doped) and reducing it into fine nanoparticles. The ink formulation 
was then completed using ethanol as the main solvent and various 
polymeric binders. Interestingly, screen-printing was performed on 
low-temperature substrates such as paper. This technology was later 

355
patented for the fabrication of resistive silicon-based temperature 
sensors, realized on paper substrates at room temperature. These 
devices are entirely screen printed: the silicon ink is deposited on 
the top of interdigitated silver electrodes, producing resistors with 
a resistance value of around 100 kΩ. Sensors were tested within a 
temperature range between 20 and 60 °C and exhibited a negative 
temperature coefficient (NTC) characterized by a beta value of 
2000  ±  100  K. Such sensors began being commercialized by PTS 
Sensors Ltd. in 2010.
	
Vuorinen et al. (2016) developed a composite ink based on 
PEDOT:PSS and a graphene water-soluble ink (Phene Plus i3015), 
in a ratio of 1:1, that they inkjet-printed on the top of a skin-
conformable polyurethane plaster (adhesive bandage). The devices, 
consisting of meander-shaped resistors, exhibited TRC values higher 
than 0.06% per degree Celsius under optimal operational conditions 
(35–45 °C) and were successfully used for the monitoring of human 
skin temperature. More recently, Wu et al. (2019) demonstrated the 
possibility of using screen printing for the fabrication of a flexible 
temperature sensor based on a flake graphite (FG)/carbon nanotube 
(CNT)/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite (mass ratio of FG 
to CNT was 4:1). These sensors show high-temperature sensitivity 
(TCR is up to 0.028  K–1 for repeated thermal cycles) and good 
linearity. Interestingly, the authors showed that the value of the TCR 
can be tuned by adjusting the mass ratio of FG to CNT.
	
Kong et al. (2012) described a method based on inkjet printing 
for the fabrication of sensors on flexible Kapton® foils. Electrical 
contacts were made using silver ink while the active layer was inkjet-
printed using a homemade suspension of graphene oxide (GO) flakes 
in water. After deposition, the GO material was reduced back to its 
conductive state under exposure to IR light (reaching a temperature 
of approximately 200 °C for 10 minutes). These devices exhibited 
negative TCR of –0.0148 K–1 at 298 K, a value which is three orders 
of magnitude higher than that obtained using other carbon-based 
materials (for instance, carbon nanotubes). The thermoresistors 
were also characterized in terms of mechanical response to 
bending: resistance variation due to bending was estimated at 5.6% 
for a degree of bending of 27.4° and all devices showed complete 
recovery to the initial resistance values when brought back to a flat 
position. Interestingly, the sensors’ materials and architecture were

later patented and are currently commercialized by Flextrapower in 
the form of smart insoles, for the temperature monitoring of diabetic 
feet.
9.3.1.2 Mechanical sensors
Organic and printed electronic technologies have been also applied 
to the realization of a variety of mechanical sensors. They are used 
to detect deformation, normal and shear forces, and pressure, and 
to reproduce the sense of touch. These sensors are typically made 
using screen and inkjet printing. The main transducing principles 
involved are capacitive, resistive/piezoresistive, and piezoelectric 
electromechanical conversion.
	
Capacitive detection is the common mechanism used in tactile 
sensing for normal and shear forces. It exhibits the advantage of 
low power consumption, temperature independence, and stability 
against long-term signal drift. However, it is highly susceptible 
to electromagnetic interference and requires more complex 
measurement circuits. Resistive and piezoresistive sensors can be 
simply implemented but can experience hysteresis and their higher 
power consumption can constitute a drawback. Piezoelectric devices 
are self-generating. They can show high sensitivity and excellent 
dynamic response, but their working principle is not adapted for 
static measurements.
Capacitive sensors
Capacitive sensors are devices able to convert physical and chemical 
stimuli into a variation of an electrical parameter called capacitance. 
The capacitance of an isolated conductive body is defined as the 
ratio between the electrical charge of that body Q and its electric 
potential V and is measured in Farad (F). Usually, capacitance is 
defined between two electrodes separated by a dielectric material, 
its analytical expression thus depends both on the geometry of 
the two conductors and the electrical properties of the dielectric 
material placed between them:
	
C
G
r

(9.4)
where G is the so-called geometrical factor (which takes into account 
the conductors’ geometry) while e0  and e0r  are the dielectric 
permittivities of the vacuum and of the insulating material, 
respectively.

357
	
An important typology of capacitors is represented by the 
parallel plate capacitor. In this case, the two conductors (called 
plates) are flat, parallel, and separated by a distance d; the overlap 
area between the two plates is indicated as A. In this system, G is 
simply:
	
G

(9.5)
We assume that the electrode and the dielectric layer have the same 
Poisson ratio (n). When a tensile strain e is applied, the length of 
the capacitor l increases to (1 + e)l, while the width and thickness 
contract to (1 – ne)w and (1 – ne)d, respectively. The capacitance 
under a tensile strain e varies linearly and is thus expressed by

For pressure capacitive sensors, screen printing is the most 
frequently utilized technique, in particular for the fabrication of 
parallel plate capacitors which can be easily made with a multi-
layered stack approach. Soft, pressure-sensitive materials such as 
polydimethylsiloxane, polyurethane, and ecoflex are embedded 
between electrically conductive electrodes that are typically 
composed of carbon, silver, or elastomeric conductive composites. 
An example concerning this latter typology of devices is given 
by Narakathu et al. (2012), who reported on the fabrication of a 
full-printed pressure sensor array on a flexible plastic substrate 
(polyethylene terephthalate, PET). Screen printing was used for the 
deposition of the bottom electrodes (fabricated using commercial 
silver ink) and of the dielectric (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS), 
while the top electrodes (also in silver) were gravure printed. Each 
single sensor was characterized in terms of response to an applied 
normal pressure, which causes a decrease in the thickness d of the 
dielectric layer, increasing capacitance. It was found that the lowest 
detectable pressure had a value of 800 kP, in correspondence with 
which capacitance increases by 5%. The dynamic response of the 
sensors was also recorded (see Fig. 9.6), within a pressure range 
between 800 kPa and 18 MPa; capacitance increases with pressure, 
with a maximum increase of 40% observed for an applied pressure 
of 18 MPa.

force in the printed pressure sensors as described by Narakathu et al. (2012).
Resistive/piezoresistive sensors
A second category of strain and pressure sensors are based on the 
resistive and piezoresistive detection principles.
	
Resistive sensors rely on the change in contact resistance. 
Contact-type resistive sensors are implemented as large dynamic 
range force sensors. One configuration consists in having a 
pressure-sensitive, electrically conductive material embedded in 
between two conductive electrodes, with a significant decrease of 
contact resistance between the pressure-sensitive material and the 
electrodes. The shunt mode implements another typology in which a 
suspended conductive material under pressure creates an electronic 
conduction channel between a set of planar interdigitated electrodes 
located below the substrate. In touch panels, two grids of electrodes 
placed on top of each other, separated by a spacer and rotated each 
other by 90°, are used to detect touch. When pressure is applied, 
the biased top and bottom electrodes on the given area get in touch 
inducing a current flow at that location.
	
Piezoresistivity is a well-known property characterizing metal, 
semiconductive, and CERMET (composite materials composed of 
ceramics and metals) films; it manifests itself as electrical resistivity 
variations when mechanical stress and/or strain is applied to the 
film, according to the following law:

P

r =
◊T 	
(9.7)
where the term on the left represents the relative resistivity variation, 
Π is the piezoresistive coefficient (expressed in Pa–1) and T is the 
applied mechanical stress (measured in Pa). Resistivity variations 
are typically attributed to atoms displacement within the material 
which causes a modification of band transport of charges, increasing 
the material’s band gap (positive resistivity variations) or decreasing 
it (negative resistivity variations). Composites made of elastomeric 
matrixes loaded with electrically conductive particles are being now 
mainly used as pressure-sensitive materials in printed sensors. The 
piezoresistive sensitivity of these materials can be tuned according 
to the particles’ loading percentage, typically in the range of a few 
percent. Various types of conductive fillers made notably of carbon 
black particles, nanotubes, silver nanoparticles, nanowires, and 2D 
materials, have been implemented.

structures (see Khan et al., 2016).
	
Printing fabrication techniques have been widely used for the 
realization of piezoresistive devices since many piezoresistive 
materials (carbon-based ink, metallic inks, CERMETs, and more 
Sensors Typologies and Examples of Printed Sensors

360
Printed Sensors and Sensing Systems
recently, polymers and rubbers) are commonly available in liquid 
forms and can be easily deposited by printing.
	
An interesting example is the work by Khan et al. (2016) who 
reported on a piezoresistive sensing layer composed of multiwall 
carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) mixed with polydimethylsiloxane 
(PDMS) embedded in between two printed metal layers of silver. The 
tactile sensor module screen printed on PET substrate consists of a 
4 × 4 sensor array with each unit having an area of 1 mm × 1 mm. 
The piezoresistive composite ink loaded with 3% MWCNT showed 
better printability while the ink made of 1% MWCNT exhibited a 
response with better linearity. The responses of the 1–5% MWCNT/
PDMS composite sensors to compressive forces are presented 
in Fig. 9.7.
Piezoelectric sensors
Piezoelectricity is the electric charge that accumulates in certain 
materials in response to applied mechanical stress. Piezoelectric 
pressure sensors exploit this effect by measuring the voltage across 
a piezoelectric element generated by the applied pressure. Unlike 
piezoresistive and capacitive transducers, piezoelectric sensor 
elements require no external voltage or current source. They 
generate an output signal directly from the applied strain. The 
output from the piezoelectric element is a charge proportional to 
pressure. Detecting this requires a charge amplifier to convert the 
signal to a voltage.
	
The most common printed piezoelectric mechanical sensors 
used a vertical stack configuration made of polyvinylidene difluoride 
(PVDF), a highly non-reactive thermoplastic fluoropolymer, 
sandwiched between silver, carbon, or PEDOT electrodes. PVDF 
requires a poling process to align the electric dipoles in a preferential 
direction to increase its piezoelectric sensitivity. It is implemented 
by applying very strong electric fields in the intended direction 
for a sufficient time. After the removal of the electric field, most 
of the dipoles remain in their initial orientation. These have been 
produced by screen printing on a variety of substrates (e.g., see Khan 
et al. in Further Readings). Inkjet formulations are also available for 
PVDF but processing of performing piezoelectric films is more 
demanding.

361
	
These different types of mechanical sensors have found 
applications in dentistry occlusion systems, floor tracks, and shoes 
for human gait analysis, floor mat and bed sheet for motion detection, 
wearables for joint motion monitoring, seat occupancy detection in 
automotive, smart shelves in the retail sector, and touch screens/
panels, with some products on the market.
Field-effect transistor (FET) sensors
Thin-film transistors (TFTs) are electronic devices where two 
electrodes called source and drain are separated by a thin-film 
semiconductive channel whose conductivity can be modulated as 
a function of the potential applied to a third electrode called the 
gate. The theoretical and practical aspects of organic field-effect 
transistors are presented in Chapter 5. Besides being used as 
switches and in different electronic circuits, they have been applied 
also as mechanical sensors.
	
Printing fabrication techniques have been successfully used 
on a large variety of polymeric substrates for the fabrication of 
electrodes, dielectric materials, and semiconductors; this is true 
not only for inorganic semiconductors but also for organic-based 
materials, for the fabrication of the so-called organic field-effect 
transistors (OFETs). An interesting example of printed FETs utilized 
as pressure sensors was provided by Noguchi et al. in 2006 (see 
Further Readings). The authors reported on the fabrication of an 
array of pressure sensors integrated with an organic FET active 
read-out matrix made of a pentacene semiconducting channel. The 
source and drain electrodes (realized with silver nanoparticles–
based ink) and the gate dielectric (polyimide) of the active TFTs 
were deposited on the substrate using inkjet printing and were then 
passivated with a parylene-C coating. The conductive electrodes 
forming the pressure-sensing elements are patterned on top 
in between a pressure-sensitive rubber. Its bottom electrode is 
connected electrically to the drain of the TFTs through a via hole 
and the top electrode is connected to VDD. When pressure is applied, 
the resistance of the pressure-sensitive rubber decreases and the 
organic FETs are activated because of the application of VDD, causing 
a measurable source-drain current increment, as shown in Fig. 9.8.

9.3.1.3 Optical sensors
Photodetectors convert incident photons into modulable electrical 
signals. The electrical signal is typically represented by a current 
(photocurrent). Organic photodetectors (OPDs) have attracted 
continuous attention due to their outstanding advantages, such 
as tunability of detecting wavelength, low-cost manufacturing, 
compatibility with lightweight and flexible devices, as well as ease 
of processing. Enormous efforts on performance improvement and 
application of OPDs have been devoted in the past decades. Their 
photophysical and optoelectronic properties can be tuned both at 
a material and device level. Visible-light OPDs are proposed for use 
in indirect-conversion X-ray detectors, fingerprint scanners, and 
intelligent surfaces for gesture recognition. Near-infrared OPDs find 
applications in biomedical imaging and optical communications.
	
Three main transducers are implemented for photonic detection 
based on organic optoelectronic materials: photoconductors, 
phototransistors, and the mainly used photodiodes. In organic 
photodiodes, light is detected upon absorption of incident photons 
with an energy equal to or larger than the optical bandgap of the 
photoactive material. The organic photodiodes have a vertical two-

363
terminal configuration, comprising an anode, hole-transporting layer 
(HTL), organic photoactive layer, electron-transporting layer (ETL), 
and a cathode (Fig. 9.9a). Due to the higher absorption coefficients 
of organic materials when compared to silicon, thin active layers 
of only 100 nm enable the absorption of up to 60% of the incident 
light. However, due to the lower relative permittivity (er = 3 ÷ 4) of 
organic semiconductors, light absorption leads to photogenerated 
excitons with a comparatively high binding energy of ≈ 0.35 – 0.5 eV, 
rather than free electrons and holes. Thus, the organic photoactive 
layers are usually made of an organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ), a 
blend of organic electron donor and electron acceptor materials. 
The photocurrent generation processes in the BHJ mainly involve 
exciton generation, exciton dissociation, charge transport, and 
charge collection. The use of the HTL and ETL facilitates the charge 
extraction at the BHJ/electrode interfaces resulting in photocurrent 
generation.
Figure 9.9 (a) Schematic cross section of an organic photodiode. (b) Typical 
light and dark current curves for organic photodiodes.
	
The typical current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of an organic 
photodiode, obtained in the dark and under light illumination, are 
shown in Fig. 9.9b. The light current in the reverse-biased region 
is significantly higher than the dark current, delivering a light-on 
signal and a light-off signal. For most applications, minimizing the 
OPD dark current density (Jd) is crucial to improve important figures 
of merits such as the signal-to-noise ratio, the linear dynamic range, 
and the specific detectivity. The responsivity (R) of the photodetector 
can be expressed as the ratio of photocurrent (Iph) measured to the 
power (P) of incident light. The external quantum efficiency (EQE), 
a dimensionless parameter, is defined as the ratio of the number of

In OPDs, the patterning of the photoactive layer is important 
because it is necessary to form pixels for active-matrix sensor 
arrays. High-resolution micrometer-scale patterning of organic 
materials is still a challenge because conventional photolithography 
techniques, which degrade organic semiconductors, cannot be 
used. However, printing technologies (e.g., inkjet, spray, and screen 
printing) enable the simultaneous deposition and direct patterning 
of active materials. By combining printing technologies with tailored 
solution-processable materials, high-efficiency, large-area, and low-
cost devices are achieved. Applications for consumer electronics 
such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and fingerprint scanning for 
personal security are some of the most interesting areas to explore 
in printed photodetectors. Printed photodetectors on large-area 
flexible substrates are already commercially available, ISORG having 
notably developed matrixes integrated with a backplane of OTFTs 
for their read-out.
	
Other photoactive materials than organic polymers are being 
currently researched such as nanohybrid, perovskite, and 2D 
materials. Applications in higher-resolution imaging, spectrally 
selective detection, and wearables are coming up. Further 
information can be found in Chapter 2, Organic Photodetectors, in 
the book Organic Narrow Band Photodetectors: Materials, Devices, 
and Applications, which is listed in the Further Readings section of 
this chapter.
9.3.2 Chemical and Biochemical Sensors
9.3.2.1 Vapor and gas sensors
Water vapor in the air is, by far, the most common gas species 
detected using printed sensors. In the large majority of cases, 

365
water vapor detection is achieved through capacitive sensors; the 
detection of other gaseous species, on the other hand, is usually 
achieved through resistive sensors. Water vapor and other types of 
gas sensors are described below in two separate sections.
Water vapor (relative humidity) sensors
As stated above, these sensors are usually based on capacitive 
structures. The geometry and dielectric permittivity of the electrically 
insulating layer (playing the role of sensing layer) are modified upon 
exposure to water vapor, thus leading to measurable variations of 
the overall capacitance directly proportional to the corresponding 
relative humidity (RH) variations. For this application, the most 
important device configuration is represented by the interdigitated 
structure, where the two electrodes, shaped as interdigitated 
fingers (IDEs), are coplanar and the dielectric is deposited on the 
top of them (and thus exposed directly to the analyte). In this case, 
it is not possible to obtain a closed, analytic expression to describe 
the capacitance, which becomes a function of several different 
parameters:

where N is the number of fingers, εSUB and εDIEL are the dielectric 
relative constants of the substrates and the gas sensing material 
respectively, and W, G, L, and t are the electrodes width, gap, length, 
and thickness (respectively) and hSUB and hDIEL are the initial 
thicknesses of the substrate and the sensing material. Interaction 
with the analyte causes both a swelling (h’DIEL = hDIEL + ΔhDIEL) and 
a modification of the electrical properties (ε’DIEL = εDIEL + ΔεDIEL) of 
the sensing dielectric deposited on the top of the electrodes so that 
capacitance variations may be expressed as follows:

and can in turn be used to measure the concentration of the target 
analyte. Printing techniques have been used for the fabrication of 
this typology of sensors, both for the deposition of the IDEs (mostly 
realized by using metallic nanoparticles–based inks) and for the 
deposition of the gas-sensitive top dielectric layer. Molina-Lopez et al. 
(2013) showed an all-additive process, based on inkjet printing, for 
the realization of humidity sensors where Ag nanoparticles–based 
ink was used for the electrodes printing (W = 95 µm, G = 105 µm,

and t = 180 nm) while a solution of cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) 
in hexyl acetate was inkjet-printed on the top of the IDEs and used 
as RH sensing layer. The influence of a nickel layer (up to 5 µm thick) 
electroplated on the silver IDEs was also evaluated.

on the left) and capacitive humidity sensors (detail on the right). (Bottom 
images) Encapsulated devices (a) top view (b) bottom view (from Molina-Lopez 
et al., 2013, see Further Readings).
	
Nickel electroplated sensors showed better performances and 
better environmental stability than bare silver electrodes, with a 
sensitivity of 2.6 fF/% RH and a response time of 24 s. Figure 9.10 
(top) shows a picture of these inkjet-printed humidity sensors; the 
printed temperature sensors described in the paragraph on resistive 
sensors are shown as well. It is worth noting that devices were fully 
encapsulated in order to prevent contamination from the outside 
environment as well as a form of protection against handling and 

367
scratches (see Fig. 9.10, bottom). It is important to notice that, unlike 
other devices (such as FETs and LEDs, for instance) which can be 
fully encapsulated (see Chapter 10 on encapsulation procedures), 
in the case of chemical sensors special care must be taken in order 
to allow exposure of the sensing layer/device to the analyte to be 
detected.
Chemiresistive semiconductor-based gas sensors
These sensors exhibit a change in resistance when their active layer 
(usually a semiconductor) is exposed to specific gaseous species. 
The absorption of the target gas on the surface of the gas-sensitive 
material causes a reversible electron exchange, temporarily 
modifying the charge density within the bulk and/or surface of the 
gas-sensitive material and causing a resistivity variation.
	
At the moment, the majority of gas-sensitive materials employed 
in the field of printed electronics are represented by conductive 
polymers and metal oxides (MOX), deposited mostly by means of 
aerosol and inkjet printing.
	
Crowley et al. (2010) described the fabrication of a full-printed 
gas sensor for the detection of a toxic reducing gas, namely hydrogen 
sulfide (H2S). The sensing semiconductive material was a polymer, 
polyaniline (PANI) doped with copper(II) chloride salts (CuCl2). 
These sensors show a detection limit of 2.5 ppmv and exhibit a linear 
relationship between measured current and concentration over the 
10–100 ppmv region.
	
More recently, Rieu et al. (2016) demonstrated the complete 
fabrication by printing of tin dioxide (SnO2) gas sensors for the 
detection of two toxic gaseous species, namely CO and NO2. Inkjet 
printing was used for the whole manufacture of the devices. A gold 
nanoparticles–based ink was utilized for the fabrication of IDEs and 
heaters on top and backside of a polyimide substrate, respectively. 
The active layer was obtained through the sol-gel method, by 
preparing and inkjet printing a precursor ink (solution of SnCl2 in 
ethanol) directly on the IDEs. After printing, final annealing at 400 °C 
(compatible with the polymeric substrate) allowed the conversion 
of the precursor into the SnO2 sensing film. The devices showed 
very good detection limits (0.6 ppm for CO and 1 ppb for NO2, when 
heated at 300 °C and tested in dry air). Figures 9.11a and b show 
optical pictures of the devices (top and bottom side, respectively) 
Sensors Typologies and Examples of Printed Sensors

Printed Sensors and Sensing Systems
while Fig. 9.11c depicts an example of the sensor’s response. For 
similar devices, Khan et al. in 2019 demonstrated that it is also 
possible to use ultrasonic aerosol printing for the deposition of gold 
IDEs and heaters (the two being separated by a printed layer of 
polyimide) on polyimide substrates. In this case, device size can be 
much reduced, which leads to a decrease in power consumption. The 
architecture of the devices is schematically represented in Fig. 9.11a. 
Optical pictures of the micro-hotplates and the gold IDEs printed on 
heaters are shown in Figs. 9.11b and c, respectively.

(2019). (b) Printed micro-hotplate. (c) Interdigitated electrodes deposited on 
the printed polyimide layer. The underlying micro-hotplate can be also seen.
9.3.2.2 Ionic and pH sensors
Ionic sensors may be defined as devices able to convert the activity 
of a specific ion dissolved into a certain solution into a measurable 
electric potential or current. When the devices are sensitive to the 
activity of the H3O+ ions, the system can be used to measure the 
solution’s pH and is rather called a pH sensor.
	
Their operation is based on three main transduction principles:
	
(i)	 Electrochemical sensors (ECS), composed of three different 
electrodes: a reference electrode (RE) with a fixed redox 
potential, a working electrode (WE) where reaction with the 
analyte to be detected occurs, and a counter-electrode (CE), 
across which an electrical current flows.

369
	
	 Even if different types of ECSs exist, particular importance is 
attributed to the so-called potentiometric sensors, where the 
interaction between the analyte and the WE causes a variation 
of the electrochemical potential between the WE itself and the 
RE.
	 (ii)	 Sensors based on ion-sensitive field-effect transistors 
(ISFETs), in which accumulation of ions at the transistor’s 
gate dielectric/electrolyte interfaces causes a measurable 
variation of the transistor’s output current.
	 (iii)	 Sensors based on organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), 
in which the diffusion of ions into the conductive organic 
channel causes a measurable variation of the transistors 
output current.
	
While in the past decade, almost all printed sensors belonged 
to category (i), more recently a certain number of printed devices 
belonging to categories (ii) and (iii) has appeared. In the following, 
an example for each category will be described.
	
The large majority of ionic sensors are based on ECS. In most 
cases, the RE is fabricated using silver-based/AgCl inks while the CE 
and the WE are realized using conductive carbon-based materials. 
Screen printing is by far the most utilized fabrication technique but 
more recently inkjet printing has been also used. Selectivity toward 
specific ionic species is often achieved by means of ion-selective 
membranes (ISMs). Different types of plastic substrates have been 
successfully used for fabrication but a more recent trend involves 
the use of environmentally friendly substrates (such as paper) for 
the production of disposable devices. In many cases, these three-
electrode, screen-printed EC systems are commercially available 
and can be adjusted later on to modify the selectivity or improve 
performances. A recent example of this type of device is given by 
Avuthu et al., in which an all-screen-printed system fabricated on 
flexible PET foils was used for the detection of heavy metal ions 
(Pb2+). Ag/AgCl pastes were used for the fabrication of the RE while 
conductive carbon paste was utilized for the deposition of the other 
two electrodes. Sensitivity toward the target ions was achieved by 
functionalizing by drop casting the WE with a solution containing the 
organic molecule naphtha [2,3-a] dipyrido [3,2-h:2´,3´-f] phenazine-
5,18-dione (QDPPZ). The limit of detection of these sensors 
was found at 50  µM; interestingly, the sensors showed excellent 
Sensors Typologies and Examples of Printed Sensors

370
Printed Sensors and Sensing Systems
selectivity toward similar metallic ions, such as Hg2+. Such good 
selectivity is thought to result from the QDPPZ molecule presenting 
a cavity of the right size to hold just Pb2+ ions.
	
ISFET-based sensors are typically fabricated by screen printing; 
graphene-based materials or metal oxides are used for the fabrication 
of the transistor’s active layers and selectivity to specific ions is 
achieved either through the employment of aptamers or by means of 
ISMs. Li et al. recently described an example of a reduced, carboxylate 
graphene oxide ISFET screen printed on flexible PET substrates for 
the detection of Pb2+ ions. Transistor electrodes were fabricated by 
screen printing a double layer of Ag/carbon pastes directly on the 
plastic substrate while the deposition of the graphene-based layer 
was done either by drop-of-knife coating. Selectivity toward Pb2+ 
ions was achieved by functionalizing the graphene layer with specific 
aptamers. Tests performed using a standard solution of Pb2+ showed 
a detection limit of 0.001 ppb, the linear fitted line is obtained in the 
range of 1–10 ppb with a sensitivity of 6.57%/ppb.
	
In the case of OECTs, the sensitivity toward specific ionic species is 
almost always achieved by covering the transistor’s channel with an 
ISM. Strand et al. described a fabrication protocol for the realization 
of all-screen-printed OECT-based sensors for the detection of 
potassium ions in biological fluids (plant sap). Devices were fabricated 
on flexible polyethylene substrates; the source and drain electrodes 
were fabricated using a silver paste while an Ag/AgCl ink was used 
for the fabrication of the gate. The active channel was made of a 
blend of PEDOT:PSS and sorbitol (25 % wt). The potassium-selective 
membrane was obtained by mixing the potassium ionophore III 
with high-molecular weight poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and some 
additives (plasticizers and cation exchanger). To prevent direct 
contact between the electrodes and the liquid solution, electrodes 
were passivated using a screen-printed layer of dielectric. Sensors 
exhibited linear response in the 10–5 ÷ 10–1 M concentration range, 
with current sensitivity of 170 µA·dec–1 and a limit of detection of 
10  ×  10–6 M. Excellent selectivity toward typical interfering ions 
normally present in plant sap (Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+), estimated in 
terms of selectivity coefficients (all comprised between 4 and 4.7).
	
As for pH sensing, Demuru et al. proposed an inkjet-printed 
OECT structure with active channels made of hybrid inkjet-printed 
PEDOT:PSS and electropolymerized polyaniline (PANI) layers. These 

371
devices were realized on a flexible polyimide substrate, and the 
three electrodes of the transistors were fabricated by inkjet printing 
a silver nanoparticle-based ink. PEDOT:PSS was also inkjet-printed 
on the channel region while deposition of PANI (on the top of the 
PEDOT:PSS layer) was achieved by electrochemical polymerization 
in an aniline solution. Devices were tested in the pH range from 10 
to 4 and showed linear sensitivity of 102 ± 22 mV·pH–1 (extracted 
from the transfer characteristics of the transistors and calculated as 
gate-source voltage shift upon exposure to different pH levels).
9.3.2.3 Biochemical sensors
Biosensors are devices that measure biological or biochemical 
reactions by the generation of signals proportional to the 
concentration of a given analyte in the reaction. An important 
characteristic of all biosensors is the intrinsic presence of a 
bioreceptor, that is, a molecule able to recognize specifically the 
analyte to be detected. Several types of bioreceptors are currently 
used: enzymes, aptamers, antibodies, nucleic acids (DNA and 
RNA), and even whole cells are just the most commonly reported 
examples. The phenomenon of interaction between the analyte and 
the bioreceptor is called biorecognition.
	
Biorecognition phenomena can be classified according to 
the specific interaction occurring between the analyte and the 
bioreceptor; in the field of printed electronics, biorecognition 
almost universally results in a change of the electrical properties 
(charge, potential, or impedance) of the solid surface on which the 
bioreceptor is immobilized. This modification can be subsequently 
transduced by a three-electrode electrochemical system or, more 
recently, by a transistor system (OECT or EGOFET).
	
Printing fabrication techniques have been extensively used 
for the realization of biosensors, both for the fabrication of the 
transducing systems and for the deposition of the bioreceptor. A 
well-known example of printed biosensors that have been already 
on the market for quite a few years, and that is based on enzymatic 
bioreceptors transduced by three-electrode electrochemical cells, is 
represented by the disposable glucose test strips, used to measure 
the blood level of glucose. A more recent example of transduction 
carried out by transistors is provided by Demuru et al. In this case, 
inkjet printing was used for the fabrication of graphene-gated 
Sensors Typologies and Examples of Printed Sensors

372
Printed Sensors and Sensing Systems
OECT on polymeric foils. Enzymatic biorecognition was used for 
the detection of glucose in aqueous solutions. The limit of detection 
was found at 100  nM, with normalized sensitivity of 20%/dec in 
the linear range of 30–5000 μM glucose concentrations. The same 
devices were also successfully tested for the detection of lactate.
9.4 3D Printed Sensors
With the recent progress made in the field of 3D printing, with 
the capability to print functional materials, these techniques are 
now emerging to fabricate various types of sensors, physical, and 
chemical. By applying digital deposition methods such as direct 
ink writing, multimaterial printing can be performed to construct 
customized and personalized sensing systems. 3D printing has been 
notably applied to the realization of elastomeric and deformable 
sensors, made of urethane- and silicone-based structural materials. 
Mechanical, optical, biochemical, and biomedical sensors have been 
fabricated using 3D printing.
	
Mechanical sensors for force, pressure, strain, and touch detection 
have been made by DIW implementing composite piezoresistive 
strain gauges, capacitive, and piezoelectric transducers. 3D 
printing has been exploited also in the field of optical sensors, to 
make accessories and also the photodetectors. Park et al., through 
multimaterial printing, have demonstrated a fully 3D printed 
photodetector that can be fabricated on soft or spherical substrates. 
SLM techniques were applied to the fabrication, particularly of 3D 
steel electrodes for electrochemical sensors. Adams et al. reported 
on a 3D-printed glucose biosensor from graphene-PLA filament 
for sensing individuals with diabetes. 3D printing is of interest in 
the biomedical domain where customization to the user’s need and 
physiognomy can be beneficial. Biosensors, smart wearables, such 
as bionic ears and gloves, and insoles with embedded sensors, have 
been shown.
	
So far, 3D printing has been mainly applied to construct sensors 
by stacking 2D layers. In the future, it is expected that devices and 
systems will be developed to take real advantage of the truly 3D 
typologies enabled by 3D printing. Interfacing 3D printed sensors 
with biological tissues is also a domain emerging.

373
9.5 Integration of Printed Sensors into Systems
Sensor systems involve the integration of different components 
together and requirements and methods depend strongly on the 
type of sensors involved and applications. Integration can involve 
the assembly of, among others, displays, memories, read-out and 
communication electronics, power management and supply (battery, 
solar cell…), antennas, fluidic interfaces, etc. Different integration 
strategies can be applied, foil-to-foil vs. one-foil approach, all-printed 
or hybrid technologies, and so on. The choice is made according to 
systems and application requirements (cost, flexibility, and maturity 
of technologies involved, temperature limitations…).
	
Following an all-printed approach is challenging and requires 
a high maturity of the components involved and simplicity of the 
system to achieve a high yield. One of the rare examples of an all-
printed sensing system was produced by the company Thin Film 
Electronics and its partners. They demonstrated a smart temperature 
sensing label made of printed memory, a sensor (from PST), organic 
read-out electronics (from PARC), and display components. Another 
strategy to avoid the use of silicon electronic components is based 
on the chipless approach implementing fully printed resonant LC 
circuits (L: inductor, C: capacitor). Using such structures, InviSense 
has developed wireless sensing passive tags that can be embedded in 
floors and walls for humidity detection. Heterogeneous integration, 
that is, the integration of active silicon technology with printed 
components fulfills an important role in realizing added electronic 
and communication functionalities to daily products where large-
area integration and low cost are imperative. The hybrid integration 
approach has been investigated to produce sensing labels for 
applications in logistics and wearables notably.
	
For perishable food products and medicines, the purpose is to 
record the temperature and humidity history during transport and 
storage. This was realized through a printed smart RFID label, as 
presented in Fig. 9.12, in the framework of the European project 
FlexSmell.
Integration of Printed Sensors into Systems

Printed Sensors and Sensing Systems
Figure 9.12 Inkjet-printed multisensor (temperature, humidity, gas) platform 
integrated on a screen-printed HF RFID label using foil-to-foil approach realized 
within the frame of the European project FlexSmell.
	
With the integration of a thin-film battery, the passive smart 
sensing label becomes semi-active and allows data logging of 
the sensors’ parameters over time. The smart label data could be 
retrieved via a commercial reader.
	
Along with printed temperature and humidity sensors, printed 
gas sensors on polymeric foil for ammonia and volatile organic 
compounds were integrated into the multisensor platform. These 
sensors were based on resistive and capacitive principles and 
were fabricated by inkjet printing on PET or PEN substrates. Silver 
nanoparticles ink is printed to form the electrodes of the sensors, the 
RTD resistor as well as the heater followed by electroplating steps of 
nickel and gold for stable operation. The devices were functionalized 
either by inkjet printing or vapor phase deposition polymerization 
(VDP) with different gas-sensitive layers: CAB, polyacrylate acid 
(PAA), and doped polyaniline films.
	
The RFID label was made by screen printing silver on a PEN 
substrate to form the HF antenna and the electrical tracks. A near-
field communication (NFC) compatible RFID, µ-controller, and 
some electronics components were integrated into the foil enabling 
powering, communication, and sensors read-out. The multisensor 
platform was integrated on the smart RFID label using a foil-to-

375
foil approach involving two possible techniques: through foil vias 
(TFV) filled with isotropic conductive adhesive (ICA) and the use of 
an anisotropic conductive adhesive (ACA). The TFVs are formed by 
laser etching an adhesive film laminated on the receiver substrate, 
which creates the electrically insulated vias, followed by their filling 
with the silver ICA using screen printing. The sensors foil was 
flip-chip, aligned, and pressed on the vias while curing. The ACA 
approach is simpler but less cost-effective. The latter involves the 
stencil printing of the more expensive ACA material, used for the 
electrical connections as well as mechanical fixation. A controlled 
temperature ramp and applied pressure allow its activation.
	
In the case of medicine blisters, there is a great interest in tracking 
the medicine usage of patients. At Holst Center in the Netherlands, 
as a proof of concept, an intelligent blister was developed based on 
heterogeneous integration. An image of such a blister is given in 
Fig. 9.13.
Figure 9.13 Printed smart blister used to track medicine compliance developed 
at Holst Center, The Netherlands. The system consists of an NFC-compliant radio 
chip, a microcontroller, and a printed resistor for each pill.
	
The blister requires a limited set of components to be integrated. 
The key components are logic, memory, timing, and radio 
connectivity, which are all addressed by conventional silicon-based 
components. Ideally, all these components are integrated into a 
single-chip solution. In this case, however, due to availability, radio, 
and logic functionality are divided over two chips and connected 
via a serial I2C bus. In this case, secure connectivity is provided 
through NFC to a reader or a suitable mobile phone. Power is 
provided by a small lithium battery embedded in the footprint of the 
blister. Finally, the electronic circuitry is realized by a combination

of screen-printed conductive silver tracks and dielectric layers 
to provide bridging functionality. Essentially the blister relies on 
the mechanical breakage of conductive printed tracks during the 
process of pushing the pills through to the blister. The printed 
resistors are connected in parallel, multiple pills are monitored 
continuously and simultaneously using an analog input reducing the 
number of inputs and outputs required on the chip. Using PET foil 
base substrates in combination with screen-printed circuitry, it was 
found that substantial cost reduction could be realized, imperative 
for the widespread usage of such technology in disposable products.
	
Efforts are also being dedicated to the realization of smart sensing 
systems on more eco-friendly cellulosic substrates demanding 
specific printing and integration processes. Tentzeris at Georgia 
Tech, USA, has reported on different types of wireless sensing labels 
made notably by printing on low-cost paper substrates (see Yang 
et al., 2009 in Further Readings). Arjowiggins, a printed electronic 
paper producer has also demonstrated hybrid RFID sensing systems 
made by hybrid integration on paper substrates tuned for RF 
applications.
	
The surface mount device electronic chip was mounted in a way 
to not have any apparent over-thickness on the tag. To achieve this, 
a cavity was drilled with a CO2 laser in the paper, and the chip was 
encrusted by the back face of the substrate with its pin facing up. 
The pins of the chip were connected to the antenna and temperature 
sensor using silver paste.
	
Another domain in which printed smart systems are emerging is 
the field of wearable electronics for physiological state monitoring. 
Printed electrodes for skin bio-potential recording are being 
integrated with other components not only on polymer but also 
now conformable elastomers. The incorporation of thin-film printed 
electrodes can provide higher user comfort, easier implementation, 
and a more desirable form factor. These systems find applications 
notably for brain waves (EEG), neuromuscular (EMG), and cardiac 
(ECG) activity monitoring. Carneiro et al. demonstrated more stable 
wearable multi-electrodes systems based on printable biphasic liquid 
metal silver composite used both as the electrodes and electrical 
interconnects. Compared to the clinical grade Ag/AgCl electrodes, 
these electrodes made by direct ink writing on thermoplastic 
urethane benefit from a lower electrode-skin impedance, and their 
digital printing enables the fabrication of customized biostickers for 
each user and application.

Polymeric and printed technologies are also of interest for large-
area and low-cost manufacturing of microfluidics and lab-on-a-foil 
systems, for instance, using roll-to-roll processes, bringing new 
opportunities for the development of point-of-care and disposable 
diagnostic chips.
9.6 Conclusions and Future Perspectives
In this chapter, the fundamentals of sensors were first reviewed. 
This part was followed by the introduction of some of the most 
important types of sensors, classified according to the nature of 
the measurands with examples of implementation on foil and using 
printing techniques. A sensor is a transducer that is used to sense/
detect some characteristics of its environment. It converts physical 
or chemical measurands into a corresponding output, typically an 
electrical signal. Depending on the nature of the measured quantity, 
we can group the sensors into three categories: physical, chemical, 
and biological sensors. The characteristics and performances of a 
sensor depend on many different parameters such as the working 
principle used, materials and design involved, mode of operation, 
and read-out, which need to be optimized carefully.
	
OPE offer new opportunities in the field of sensing with unique 
characteristics such as flexibility, softness, transparency, low form 
factor, low cost, biocompatibility, and disposability, among others. 
We have seen that a large set of working principles have been already 
applied to the development of printed and flexible sensing systems. 
Until recently, the technology was particularly suitable for the 
implementation of chemical and biosensors but today it is mature 
enough to provide us with a growing number of physical sensors. 
The additive and local character of their processing is beneficial for 
the multi-layer and local functionalization of chemical and biological 
sensor systems. Significant progresses, reaching the stage of 
commercialization, have been made on physical temperature, light, 
force, and pressure sensors.
	
With the large volumes of produced sensors expected in the near 
future, we can expect that large-area manufacturing at low-cost based 
on additive and printing processes will receive even more attention. 
However, one should not neglect the different issues inherent to very 
high volume production. These issues become particularly important 
Conclusions and Future Perspectives

378
Printed Sensors and Sensing Systems
if one considers the fact that electronic devices’ lifetime is becoming 
shorter and shorter: electric and electronic equipment currently 
represent the fastest growing waste stream in the world. To address 
these problems, two strategies are being presently implemented: 
(i) the quest for more environmentally friendly materials (highly-
recyclable substrates, utilization of water or non-chlorinated 
solvents for inks formulation, a tendency to replace toxic heavy 
metals with polymeric materials…) and (ii) reduction of the carbon 
footprint in the overall fabrication and distribution chain of the final 
sensing system (preference for additive manufacturing techniques, 
improvement of devices portability and storage, recycling…).
	
Other topics that need to be addressed with more effort concern 
sensors testing and calibration, and in some cases, their specific 
encapsulation, which is strongly product and application dependent. 
Stretchable and bioelectronics sensing technologies are raising a lot 
of interest for compliant design and biocompatible applications. 
In recent years, considerable progress has been made in the 
fabrication of soft and stretchable sensing systems and, thanks to the 
improvement of digital manufacturing and especially 3D printing, we 
are expected to see in the forthcoming years the commercialization 
of wearable or even implantable devices personalized to the user’s 
particular needs and/or body specificities.
	
Finally, the printed sensor components alone are not the solution 
to any problem as their deployment will depend on how successful 
their integration into systems will be. For applications requiring high 
performances in terms of computation and signal communication, 
the most successful current approach is represented by hybrid, 
flexible, and printed sensing systems in which the transduction 
task is carried out by printed devices while signal conditioning and 
processing are done by a silicon-based integrated circuit, specifically 
conceived for integration onto flexible, plastic substrates together 
with the sensors. Another interesting approach that has recently 
become quite popular consists in separating the sensing step 
(performed by disposable, low-cost printed sensors) from the signal 
conditioning and processing step (carried out by reusable silicon-
based electronic equipment).

379
	
It is likely that these hybrid approaches will enable a new 
generation of smart objects and large-area intelligent surfaces for 
applications we cannot even think about at the moment.

Solution:
	 (1)	 In a photodiode in photoconductive mode, the more positive 
electrode is the cathode while the more negative one is the 
anode. The cathode collects electrons from the hole-electron 
pairs generated into the organic layer, therefore it is in contact 
with the electron-transport hole (ETL) while the anode 
collects holes from the hole-electron pairs generated into the 
organic layer, therefore it is in contact with the hole-transport 
hole (HTL). The following picture shows the complete scheme 
of the device.

10.1 Introduction to Encapsulation
The encapsulation of an organic electronic device describes the 
packaging needed to protect the device against damage caused by 
the environment (extrinsic degradation factors). These degradation 
factors include mechanical damage (scratches, kinks, pressure), 
reactions with corrosive gases (e.g., moisture, oxygen) or liquid 
chemicals (e.g., lipids from fingerprints, surfactants, or acids) as 
well as light-induced degradation (e.g., exposure to direct sunlight/
ultraviolet wavelengths). Thereby, the term encapsulation refers 
to both the packaging materials (e.g., glass) and the packaging 
processes (e.g., lamination or coating).

Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
	
This chapter gives an introduction to commonly used materials 
and processes for the encapsulation of organic electronic devices. 
One major cause for degradation of such devices is the reaction of 
the electrically active materials and electrodes with ambient water 
vapor and/or oxygen. Therefore, a major task of the encapsulation 
is to prevent water vapor and oxygen from reaching the device. Two 
major mechanisms of device degradation are observed in devices 
when they come in contact with water: (1) pixel shrinkage caused 
by water penetration from the side and (2) local degradation and 
dead-spot formation due to defects in the encapsulation. Figure 10.1 
illustrates the damage to an organic light emitting diode (OLED) 
caused by the reaction of the OLED layers with water. Both pixel 
shrinkage and dead-spot formation are observed not only in OLEDs 
but also in other devices, including organic solar cells (OSCs). While 
dark spots become visible in OLEDs, OSC devices show a decrease 
in their power conversion efficiency due to an increasing inactive 
surface area at defective spots and from the side.
Figure 10.1 Aging of an orange OLED with insufficient encapsulation.
	
Organic electronic devices show the strongest requirements in 
comparison to other products in terms of maximum allowed water 
vapor and oxygen penetration. These requirements depend on 
the technology and materials used as well as the desired product 
properties and expected product lifetime. In literature, often the 
water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) and oxygen transmission 
rate (OTR) are used as quantity to describe, on the one hand, the 
performance of an encapsulation system and, on the other hand, 
the maximum allowed amount of water to reach an organic device 
before device failure. These values (WVTR and OTR) describe a mass 
of water or volume of oxygen permeating through the encapsulation 
system per unit time (commonly 1 day) and area (commonly one 

391
Types of Encapsulation
square meter). The units of the values are given as [WVTR] = g/(m²d) 
and [OTR] = cm³/(m²d bar). As we will see later, both WVTR and 
OTR are not material constants but depend on the environmental 
conditions (mainly temperature and relative humidity [RH]) at which 
they are measured. Therefore, WVTR and OTR requirements given 
for organic electronic devices depend on their desired application 
environment. There is a big difference between indoor use (23°C 
and about 50% RH) and outdoor use in tropical conditions (up to 
38°C and 90% RH).
	
In most of the literature about encapsulation of organic electronic 
devices, the requirement for an encapsulation system with a WVTR 
of 10−6 g/(m²day) can be found. This requirement is usually derived 
for OLEDs, which sometimes include highly reactive low work 
function metals as cathode. The assumption that primary metal 
oxidation causes injection/extraction barriers for charge carriers 
is well justified and indeed requires very strong encapsulation in 
the range below 10−5  g/(m²day) for reasonable lifetimes. While 
OLEDs strongly suffer from local degradation at defects in the 
encapsulation (see Fig. 10.1), other devices such as OSCs are more 
sensitive to a total amount of water reaching the device over time 
on a certain surface area. Only 20 mg of water is sufficient to reduce 
by 50% the power efficiency of a small-molecule OSC with a size of 
1 m². These 20 mg translate into a specified WVTR of 2·10–5 g/(m²d) 
for the case that a storage lifetime of 10,000 hours is desired. The 
easiest way to reach such low WVTR is to use glass to encapsulate 
the device. Glass is impermeable for both water and oxygen and has 
no local defects that could lead to dead-spot formation. However, it 
has limited resistance against mechanical impacts and damage and 
is not flexible. To allow flexible (meaning bendable and formable) 
devices, coated polymer webs can be used as encapsulation, as 
shown later in the next sections.
10.2 Types of Encapsulation
Depending on the desired lifetime, the inherent stability of the 
system, and the target market for the organic device, different 
encapsulation approaches may be chosen, as shown in Fig. 10.2. 
Among these, a glass–glass encapsulation (Fig. 10.2a), consisting 
of a glass substrate with the device and a second glass mounted 
on top, sealing the device provides the strongest and most durable 

392

encapsulation. However, glass encapsulation only allows rigid and 
flat devices. Flexible devices can be manufactured by using thin-
film barrier coated polymer webs (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate 
(PET)). Multiple options exist for encapsulation devices with 
such barrier films. They can be laminated onto a device that was 
processed on a rigid glass substrate or metal foil (Fig. 10.2b), or they 
can be used as substrate for the device with an additional barrier 
film laminated on top (Fig. 10.2c). Sometimes devices are processed 
on a separate plastic substrate, which is subsequently packaged 
from both sides with a permeation barrier film. This eliminates the 
need to run the device-manufacturing processes on the permeation 
barrier system, reducing the risk of any damage to the barrier 
coatings. The technologically most challenging option is a thin-film 
encapsulation (TFE) deposited directly onto the organic device 
(Fig. 10.2d). TFE is widely done by vacuum-coating techniques such 
as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) or atomic 
layer deposition (ALD) and is often combined with subsequent 
barrier film lamination (similar to Fig. 10.2c). In any case, it is 
important to know which side of the device is the active side. The 
active side is defined as the side of the device to which light is emitted 
by an OLED or from which an OSC or sensor is illuminated. On this 
side, the encapsulation has to be optically transparent. Metal foils 
or thick metal layers cannot be used on the active side. Glass, many 
oxide barrier layers, and many polymer webs fulfill the transparency 
requirement.

Types of Encapsulation
10.2.1 Glass–Glass Encapsulation
Macroscopically thick glass sheets are practically a perfect barrier 
against oxygen and moisture. In addition to that, glass is durable 
against other chemicals, fingerprints, and also mechanical damage 
to some degree. Usually, the device is processed on a glass substrate 
to prepare a glass–glass encapsulation. Subsequently, the device 
is encapsulated by mounting a second glass sheet on top. Thereby 
an edge seal or a full area adhesive is used to stick the top glass 
sheet onto the device. Of course, it is also possible to laminate an 
organic device that has been processed on a flexible film between 
two glass slides. The weak point of this encapsulation approach is 
the permeation through the sealing between the two glass slides. 
Although it is certainly possible to cover the full area of the device 
with adhesive or bonding material, usually only an edge sealing 
of the assembly is performed. This reduces the risk of chemical 
interactions between the device layers and the adhesive as well as 
potentially reduces stress in the whole device structure. Two main 
mechanisms determine the remaining permeation of water into the 
sealed cavity (Fig. 10.3).
Figure 10.3 Schematic drawing of a glass–glass encapsulation. The device is 
located between two glass slides and can be equipped with a getter material to 
enhance the device lifetime. Parasitic diffusion of water and oxygen takes place 
through the edge seal.
	
The first is the permeation of water or oxygen through the adhesive 
or bonding material itself, which depends on the used material, the 
adhesive thickness (d), and the length of the edge seal (l). Given the 
edge-sealing process has to be applied as the last processing step, 
the overall substrate temperature that can be applied to cure or 
modify the edge seal is limited by the thermal stability of the device. 
Thus, most edge-sealing systems rely on polymer materials, which 

394
Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
do not have very high barrier properties. In this case, the parasitic 
permeation can be decreased by changing the geometries of the 
seal, i.e., use as thin as possible adhesive systems with a large lateral 
extension to create long diffusion pathways.
	
The second mechanism for parasitic permeation in an edge-
sealed glass–glass system is the permeation at the interface between 
the glass surface and the edge seal material and through any coated 
thin layers below the edge. These layers can be, e.g., indium tin 
oxide (ITO) electrode structures, screen-printed porous passivation 
or metal structures, or even organic materials. Depending on the 
material combination, the interface diffusion may account for 50% 
and more of the water ingress toward the device in a glass–glass 
encapsulation setup. By smart design and optimized adhesives, the 
permeation through the edge seal in glass–glass encapsulations 
can be lowered to the range of 10−6. Glass–glass encapsulations can 
also be scaled up, which requires some engineering of the edge-
sealing process to avoid defects. Another big advantage of glass–
glass encapsulation is the equal thermal expansion coefficient of 
top and bottom seals, as well as the mechanical rigidity minimizing 
the mechanical strain in the sealing layer. Also, the edge sealing can 
be combined with scavenger materials in the device cavity. The role 
of scavenger materials is to react with the permeating oxygen or 
moisture faster than other materials involved in the organic device. 
Therefore glass–glass encapsulations are the most stable and 
reliable encapsulation technologies available and are widely used 
as reference for permeation measurement and as standard setup or 
commercial devices made of organic electronics.
	
In the recent years, flexible, ultrathin glass has emerged, 
which offers the opportunity to manufacture semi-flexible devices 
(bendable to a bending radius of several centimeters in one 
direction) with a glass–glass encapsulation. Such ultrathin glass 
has a thickness between 25 µm and 200 µm and is—similar to thick 
glass (>1 mm thickness)—considered impermeable to water vapor 
and oxygen. Typically, 100 µm thick glass is used. Challenges arise 
while processing the thin glass, which is prone to cracking under 
mechanical or thermal stress. However, OLEDs of size up to 1 m² 
(0.3 m × 2 m) have been demonstrated using ultrathin glass.

395
Types of Encapsulation
10.2.2 Lamination of Barrier Films
Glass–glass encapsulation does not allow bendable and flexible 
devices. For that, so-called permeation barrier films are used as 
encapsulation material. Permeation barrier films are usually polymer 
webs that are coated with inorganic layers or multilayer stacks, 
which prevent water and oxygen from permeating through the film. 
A huge advantage of this technology is the possibility to manufacture 
the barrier films in advance, so their production conditions are 
not limited by the sensible organic device. Therefore, higher 
temperatures, radiation, chemical bathes, and gases can be applied 
to the barrier film, which might destroy an organic device instantly. 
Due to the separated processing of the barrier films and devices, the 
complete range of coating processes as described below is available 
and can be used, limited only by substrate compatibility. However, 
compatibility of the device is still needed for the lamination step 
itself. In this step, the barrier film is stuck onto the devices (usually 
on the full area instead of only using an edge seal) using an adhesive 
polymer. Depending on the type of adhesive, the lamination process 
also requires high temperature (hot-melt adhesives), pressure 
(pressure-sensitive adhesives [PSAs]), or radiation (UV-curing 
adhesives). The types of adhesives and the processing for lamination 
are described below in Section 10.4.3. Permeation barrier films also 
enable efficient roll-to-roll processing of flexible devices.
	
The same parasitic permeation paths for water vapor and 
oxygen as shown for the glass–glass encapsulation earlier apply for 
the encapsulation with a barrier film. In addition to that, moisture 
permeation takes place also at defects in the barrier film leading to, 
e.g., dead-spot formation. Also, mechanical stress in the system has a 
higher impact on the device compared to glass–glass encapsulation, 
causing bending or, in the worst case, delamination. Depending on 
the type of adhesive and the desired application, and depending 
on coatings structure of the barrier films, the distance between 
the actual barrier layers might be larger than for glass–glass 
encapsulations, leading to higher lateral permeation of water into 
the device. Sometimes an additional edge sealing is applied to lower 
this parasitic permeation.

396
Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
	
If the device is processed on top of the barrier film, the barrier 
must not be damaged during the following processes, which is 
especially critical for pattering steps by laser ablation or wet etching, 
e.g., for lateral electrode structuring in thin-film modules.
	
Barrier films are available in many different qualities and 
permeation barrier strengths, from food packaging to ultra-high 
barrier systems according to the short overview in Section 10.4.2.
10.2.3 (Direct) Thin-Film Encapsulation
The term thin-film encapsulation (TFE) describes direct coating 
of the device with a thin single or multilayer stack using common 
deposition techniques such as ALD, PECVD, sputtering, or also wet-
coating and printing techniques. The module is thereby processed 
on glass, metal foils, or barrier films. Ideally, such a process can be 
integrated into device manufacturing in either sheet-to-sheet or roll-
to-roll. Using TFE, parasitic effects and device contamination can 
be reduced, and damage due to a separate mechanical lamination 
process is avoided. The main issue of TFE is the need to process on 
the organic device, which severely limits the processing conditions. 
The exact limits depend on the device technology used, but higher 
substrate temperatures exceed 80°C to 100 °C as usual for many 
deposition processes. UV radiation or solvent exposure are often not 
allowed because they would damage the device. Therefore, many 
technologies using plasma, reactive gases, or high temperatures to 
achieve dense inorganic barrier layers are difficult to use in TFE 
processes.
	
Just like in barrier films, multiple layers can be stacked to 
improve barrier properties. TFE can also be combined with other 
encapsulation technologies, e.g., lamination between glass slides or 
lamination of barrier films after TFE. Another significant advantage 
of combining TFE with suitable production layouts is the direct 
contact between bottom and top barriers, rendering additional 
perimeter sealing obsolete. It is in principle possible to combine 
barrier, electrode, and antireflection coating as multifunctional TFE.

397
10.3 Permeation in Solids and Thin Films
The most important task of encapsulation is preventing water vapor 
and oxygen from reaching the device. Therefore, the performance 
of the encapsulation materials as a permeation barrier is a critical 
parameter for device application. Understanding gas permeation 
in solids (glass), polymers (e.g., adhesives), and thin films 
(inorganic oxide barrier layers) is, therefore, crucial to optimize the 
encapsulation of the device.
	
Permeation is described as mass transport of gas or liquid 
through a solid material. It is a compound process based on the 
fundamental physical processes: sorption, solution, and diffusion. 
Figure 10.4 shows the sub-processes that define the permeation 
through a solid or thin film. These processes are as follows:
Adsorption and solution: The permeating gas is adsorbed at the 
surface of the solid and, if the gas is soluble in the material, it is 
dissolved in the solid.
Diffusion: Depending on the concentration gradient between the 
two solid surfaces, the gas diffuses through the solid material.
Desorption: The gas particles are released from the backside solid 
surface.
Figure 10.4 Fundamental processes involved in gas permeation in solids.
	
The physical quantity related to the gas permeation is the 
permeation coefficient (P), being the product of the diffusion 
coefficient (D) and the sorption coefficient (S).

10.3.1 Fick’s First Law of Diffusion
Diffusion in solids can be described in general by Fick’s laws 
(commonly referred to as “Fickian diffusion”). Fick’s first law covers 
gas and liquid diffusion through a solid material under equilibrium 
condition. It defines the amount of gas diffusing through a solid 
within a defined time interval (t) with the particle current density 
(

J ) that can be derived from the diffusion coefficient and the 
concentration gradient of the permeating gas in the solid material:
	


J
D c
= - D .
	
When talking about permeation in thin films or even in polymer 
webs on large areas, the lateral dimensions of the solid are orders 
of magnitude larger than its thickness d. Under that boundary 
condition and with the assumption that the gas concentration on 
the solid surface is homogeneous, Fick’s first law can be simplified 
to a one-dimensional equation with a concentration gradient only 
perpendicular to the solid surface. With the additional assumption 
that the solid is isotropic with a constant diffusion coefficient, the 
particle current density can be described as:
	
J
n
t A
D c
c
d
x = ∂
∂
= -
-

Here n describes the quantity of the permeating gas and A is 
the surface area of the solid. Usually, the moisture and oxygen 
concentration on the device side (c2) is zero at all times assuming 
that all water molecules are instantly consumed by the device’s 
layers in the form of degradation reactions. The gas concentration 
on the outer surface of the encapsulation (c1) is determined by 
the (ad)sorption of the gas to the surface according to the surface 
properties and the environmental conditions in which the device is 
stored. Thereby, c1 may not be measured directly in an experiment. 
Instead, several models exist to describe adsorption and desorption 
of gases on solid surfaces and solution of these gases within the solid 
material in dependence of the gas’s partial pressure at the surface. 
Sorption, in general, can be from physical nature (physisorption, 
dipole or van der Waals force) or chemical nature (chemisorption, 
chemical covalent bonding). It is well understood that chemisorption 
is much stronger than physisorption. The simplest model to describe 
sorption processes is Henry’s law, which proportionally links the 

399
concentration (c) of a permeating gas on/in a solid material to its 
partial pressure (pg) at the surface (pg):

Henry’s law can be applied only under specific conditions:
	
∑	 Only physisorption takes place (e.g., no gas molecule 
dissociation at the surface).
	
∑	 The permeating gas cannot condensate on the solid surface at 
the given temperature.
	
Therewith the sorption of oxygen on many polymers at room 
temperature may be well described using Henry’s law. However, 
this is not the case for water vapor and even CO2 as these gases may 
condensate and dissociate at room temperature. Although Henry’s 
law still gives a satisfying approximation, more refined models such 
as the Langmuir sorption model or the Brunauer–Emett–Teller 
sorption model are needed to correctly describe water sorption on 
typical encapsulation materials and organic devices.
	
The available partial pressure for oxygen permeation is easy to 
determine and equals 20% of the total air pressure according to 
the composition of air. For water, the determination of the partial 
pressure and concentration on the air side is more difficult. It 
depends on temperature and RH and is discussed in a separate 
section of this chapter. However, the main consequences of diffusion 
physics for the encapsulation of organic electronic devices are as 
follows:
	
1.	 Permeation through glass encapsulation can be described by 
Fick’s permeation laws. However, the glass thickness is very 
high and the related diffusion coefficient of the material for 
water vapor or oxygen is very low (e.g., oxygen diffusion in 
different glasses at room temperature: between 10−25 cm²/s 
and 10−18 cm²/s). This means that glass encapsulation can be 
treated as impermeable.
	
2.	 Permeation through polymer webs, organic layers, and 
adhesives can be described with the Fickian diffusion model 
Permeation in Solids and Thin Films

400
Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
assuming that the materials are free of local irregularities 
(defects) and have a homogeneous thickness and material 
composition. The steady-state permeation rate is inversely 
proportional to the material/layer thickness with a constant 
diffusion coefficient. Because of high diffusion coefficients 
(e.g., D = 10−9 cm²/s for O2 in polyesters), the materials are 
not sufficient for the encapsulation of organic devices alone.
	
3.	 Permeation through thin metallic and oxide thin films cannot 
be described with the Fickian model as the layer properties 
are not homogeneous and the layers contain defects that 
provide a much higher permeation than predicted from the 
Fickian model based on the bulk material. Different defect 
permeation models are used to describe water vapor and 
oxygen diffusion through these layers.
10.3.2 Defect Models for Permeation in a TFE
10.3.2.1 Classification of defects
Inorganic thin films such as metal or oxide layers are used both as 
TFE deposited directly on the device and as a barrier layer deposited 
on a polymer web, which is laminated on the device. The solid-state 
(Fickian) gas diffusion through such barrier layers is several orders 
of magnitude lower than experimentally determined permeation 
results. For example, the permeation through a 100 nm thick “bulk” 
SiO2 layer would be 13 orders of magnitude lower than measured for 
100 nm thick PVD-coated SiO2 layer.
	
It is well known that thin films contain defects of different sizes. 
A common understanding is that these defects are almost solely 
responsible for the permeation of gases through the thin films, while 
the Fickian solid-state diffusion is negligible. Defects in thin films are 
classified with respect to their sizes and permeation mechanisms 
according to Fig. 10.5. Lattice defects include defects within the solid-
state structure such as dislocations or atomic holes. Gas permeation 
through these defects is very low and can be neglected. Nano-defects 
have a size in a range between 0.3 nm and approximately one to a 
few nanometers. The number of these defects in a typical thin oxide 
barrier layer can be up to four orders of magnitude higher than the 
number of macro-defects. Even though the permeation through a 

401
single nano defect is very low, it is believed that these defects are 
the driving force for water vapor permeation just due to their large 
number. In addition to that, water condensation can take place at 
these defects and accelerate the permeation further. Due to their 
small size as well as the fact that oxygen does not condensate at 
ambient conditions, it is believed that these defects do not play an 
important role for oxygen permeation.
Figure 10.5 Oxford classification of defects.
	
Macro-defects with a size larger than 1 nm up to several 
micrometers are caused, for example, by substrate surface defects, 
particles, and dust as well as damage due to mechanical cracking. 
Macro-defects can be classified further based on their size and the 
dominant diffusion mechanism. Defects that have a size considerably 
larger than the mean free path of the permeating gas in air (>>66 
nm on ambient conditions) allow unhindered gas diffusion. They 
are the driving force for oxygen diffusion through thin films and 
play an important role also for water vapor permeation and local 
degradation in encapsulated organic electronic devices.
10.3.2.2 Models to describe gas permeation at layer defects
Several models exist to estimate gas permeation in thin-film single 
layers and layer stacks. Often the encapsulation system contains 
more than one layer (e.g., a polymer film, an inorganic coating, and 
an adhesive). The resulting permeation in such a layer stack can 
be described by the ideal laminate model (sometimes also called 
electrical analogy model). This model is based on the following 
assumptions:

402

∑	 All layers are permeable with a permeation coefficient other 
than zero ( P
Pn
1
0

π
).
	
∑	 All layers are free of accelerated diffusion paths such as layer 
defects.
	
The ideal laminate model describes the gas permeation through 
the layer stack in the same way as the electrical current in a series 
of electrical resistances. The total water vapor permeation may be 
calculated according to the following equation:

.
	
This finally means that in a multilayer system, the total gas 
permeation is always lower than the permeation through the layer 
with the lowest individual gas permeability would be.
	
The coverage model is used to describe the permeation through 
an inorganic single layer on any permeable substrate with the 
assumption that the permeation through the barrier layer only takes 
place at defects, while the layer material itself is impermeable. In 
that case, the total gas permeation through the system is determined 
by the permeability of the substrate and the total defect area in the 
layer. However, the coverage model does not take into account that 
the gas spreads in all directions within the permeable substrate after 
passing through the inorganic layer.
	
The coverage model has been extended by Prins and Hermans 
to the well-known pinhole model to include this behavior. If the 
average size and the density of defects are known, the total gas 
permeation through the system layer and substrate can be calculated 
using this equation:

The equation is valid with the boundary conditions that the defect 
area is low compared to the substrate’s total area ( A

) 
and that the thickness of the substrate is larger than about one-third 
of the average defect radius ( d

). The model assumes 
that an average defect radius (r0) can be used for calculation and 
the influence of different defect sizes on the gas spreading in the 
polymer is negligible. There are several enhancements of the 
pinhole model that try to take into account different sizes of defects. 

403
However, in most cases, the pinhole model gives already a good 
approximation, although both the coverage model and the pinhole 
model only describe the permeation through macro-defects without 
taking into account possible chemical interactions of the gas with the 
layer material (e.g., dissociation) and without including permeation 
through nano-defects.
10.3.2.3 Defects in multilayer systems
Stacking thin layers on a multilayer system is a common approach to 
reduce the effect of defects in the individual constituents of the system 
on permeation through the whole stack. Commonly, polymer layers 
and oxide barrier layers are stacked alternately on the substrate (see 
Section 10.4.3). While the oxide layers have low gas permeability 
but contain layer defects, the polymer layers are permeable but have 
the capability to interrupt defect growth and cover particles on the 
substrate or in the layers below. One assumption behind stacking 
dyads (one oxide layer plus one polymer layer) on a multilayer stack 
is that—because of a different distribution of defects in the first and 
subsequent oxide layers—these defects are decoupled so that water 
or oxygen have to laterally diffuse first and saturate the polymer 
layer before reaching the next defect in the subsequent oxide layer 
and finally the device. This “tortuous path of diffusion” model allows 
a significant delay of water permeation through the encapsulation 
system (see the next section below). Also, the probability of defect 
growth caused by imperfections in the substrate, the device 
electrode, or the first barrier layer is reduced by introducing an 
interlayer between the first and the second barrier layers.
10.3.3 Time Dependence of Permeation
All explanations up to now include only steady-state permeation 
after reaching a constant concentration gradient between the air side 
and the device side of the encapsulation. However, the encapsulation 
of organic devices is usually done in an inert (dry) atmosphere prior 
to exposing it to ambient conditions with water vapor and oxygen 
(permeates) in the atmosphere. This means that the initial device 
conditions and the concentration gradient in the barrier film/
encapsulation are in a non-equilibrium condition having, ideally, no 
permeate molecules solved within the encapsulation film. A certain 
Permeation in Solids and Thin Films

404
Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
“time lag” is needed to reach a concentration gradient within the 
sample according to the ambient condition on the outer surface of 
the encapsulation (e.g., 50% RH at 20°C) and the time-constant zero-
concentration of the permeate on the device side (assuming that the 
degrading device binds all incoming permeate molecules). The time 
dependence of permeation under non-equilibrium condition can be 
described using Fick’s second law:

Fick’s second law is valid for the case that solid-state diffusion is 
the dominating mechanism without taking into account permeation 
through defects. Also, a position- and concentration-independent 
diffusion coefficient D is assumed. As stated earlier, the concentration 
of the permeate at the outer side of the sample is assumed to be 
constant at all times (c1 = const.). Within the encapsulation film, the 
permeate concentration is zero at all positions initially, continuously 
increasing until steady state is reached. The concentration on 
the device side of the encapsulation film remains zero at all times 
(c2 = 0) as it is assumed that the device layers immediately react 
with any incoming permeate molecule.
	
Fick’s second law can be used together with these boundary 
conditions to calculate the total amount of gas permeating through 
the solid (Q(t)):

The total amount of water depends on the diffusion coefficient 
D, the thickness of the encapsulation film d, and the water vapor 
concentration on the outer side of the encapsulation. The time needed 
to reach a constant concentration profile in the encapsulation profile 
is the so-called “lag time of diffusion,” which is defined for large t 
(t 0)  as the intercept of the linear terms in the equation earlier:
	
t

It is, thereby, important to keep in mind that the lag time does 
not equal the time needed to reach a constant WVTR through the 
encapsulation system and also does not equal the required minimum 

405
measurement time. However, increasing the lag time of a TFE system 
by alternately stacking inorganic and organic barrier layers is a 
common concept to reach sufficient lifetime of organic electronic 
devices. Organic devices usually tolerate a maximum quantity of 
water vapor molecules reaching the device’s surface before failure 
regardless of whether that amount of water reached the device 
with a constant WVTR over the time or with an initially low WVTR, 
which increases after the time lag is over. Figure 10.6 illustrates this 
behavior in detail. The figure shows the time dependence of the 
total amount of water reaching the device and the WVTR for two 
different encapsulation systems. One has a low WVTR but a short lag 
time, and the other one has a high lag time but only a lousy WVTR 
after reaching that time. This difference is important to know when 
deciding for an encapsulation solution with respect to the desired 
lifetime of the device. Some groups reported simulated results for 
multilayer stacks showing a lag time of water permeation of several 
years, which would, by far, be sufficient for encapsulating, e.g., OLED 
displays for mobile phone application regardless of whether the 
steady-state permeation rate would be far too high for a reliable 
device encapsulation.

10.3.4 Influence of Ambient Conditions on the Gas 
Permeation Rates in an Encapsulation System
The gas permeation rates depend not only on the material 
properties of the encapsulation but also on the ambient conditions 
that determine the gas concentration on the outer surface of the 
encapsulation layers. These conditions are the partial pressure of 
the gas at the surface and the ambient temperature.
10.3.4.1 Partial pressure of the permeate gas
Calculation of the surface partial pressure is easy for oxygen as 
it equals the fraction of oxygen in air multiplied by the total air 
pressure under normal ambient condition. Therefore, in typical 
application environments of organic electronic devices, the partial 
pressure of oxygen is 0.2 bar, which remains constant even at 
different temperatures or climates (e.g., tropical climate versus 
indoor climate in Northern Europe). Therefore, only temperature 
dependence of permeation according to the following section has to 
be considered.
	
Water vapor partial pressure, however, is more difficult 
to determine. Usually, WVTRs are given for a certain RH and 
temperature. RH is defined as the quotient of the actual water vapor 
partial pressure and the saturation vapor pressure of water at a 
given temperature and air pressure:
	
RH
p
p
[
]
%
vapor
saturation
=
◊100.
	
However, the saturation vapor pressure of water in air is 
temperature dependent (exponentially increasing in a temperature 
range of 0°C to 60°C), which means that 90% RH corresponds to a 
much lower absolute water vapor partial pressure at 20°C compared 
to, e.g., 38°C. Therefore, the WVTR through an encapsulation film is 
also much lower at 23°C than at 38°C. The temperature dependence

10.3.4.2 Temperature dependence of permeation
Fickian diffusion is a thermally activated process following an 
Arrhenius equation for temperature dependence. This results 
in an exponential increase in gas permeation with increasing 
temperature. As both diffusion and sorption depend exponentially 
on temperature, the permeation coefficient can be determined by:

The activation energy of permeation is defined as the sum of the 
activation energy of the gas diffusion (ED) and the heat of solution 
or activation energy of sorption ( E

). Temperature 
dependence of permeation through defects in thin films differs 
from those shown for Fickian diffusion. In large macro-defects, the 
permeating gas and the thin-film material do not interact, but the gas 
is permeating virtually unhindered through the defect. There is no 
contribution of the thin film to the activation energy of permeation 
in the full stack. If many smaller defects dominate gas permeation, 
the permeation mechanism changes depending on the defect size to:
Permeation in Solids and Thin Films

408
Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
	
∑	 Molecular flow for a defect size in the range of the mean free 
path of the gas molecules in air (around 60 nm).
	
∑	 Interface diffusion and, if applicable, condensation in 
capillaries for small defects of a few nanometers size and less.
	
In both cases, the activation energy of the encapsulation system 
is influenced by the defects in any barrier layers leading to mostly 
stronger increase in the gas permeation with increasing temperature.
	
Oxygen permeation is dominated by macro-defects for many 
oxide barrier layers independently from the coating technology. The 
activation energy of oxygen diffusion through coated polymers is 
almost the same as of the uncoated substrate (e.g., PET with EA = 29 
± 3 kJ/mol).
	
Water vapor permeation, instead, is dominated not only by 
macro-defects but also by an interaction of the water with the 
coating material and/or by condensation at nano-defects. The 
activation energy of water vapor permeation strongly depends 
on the layer material and the coating technology. Al2O3 layers, for 
example, show higher activation energy of water vapor permeation, 
if they are coated by sputtering compared to evaporation. This result 
points to a more macro-defect-dominated permeation in evaporated 
layers and a more nano-defect-dominated diffusion in sputtered 
layers. The values range from EA = 3 kJ/mol for uncoated PET and 
evaporated layers to EA = 14 kJ/mol for some sputtered Al2O3 layers.
10.4 Encapsulation Substrates and Materials
The most often used encapsulation material is glass with a thickness 
in the range of less than 1 mm to a few 10 mm. Glass encapsulation 
is established for large device and module size of up to several 100 
cm² and even m². Glass encapsulation is processed in sheet-to-sheet 
processing machines at industrial substrate sizes from Generation 
1 (Gen 1 = 300 × 400 mm²) up to Generation 6 (1500 × 1800 mm²) 
or rarely higher. This section deals with alternative encapsulation 
substrates and materials that can be used for flexible devices, which 
are currently not available with glass encapsulation.

409
10.4.1 Encapsulation Substrates
10.4.1.1 Polymer substrates for encapsulation
Flexible organic electronics devices and encapsulation systems 
can be processed on polymer webs such as PET or polyethylene 
naphthalate (PEN). However, most polymers are highly permeable 
for water vapor and oxygen and require a thin-film coating to reach 
a sufficiently low WVTR for organic device encapsulation. Basic 
requirements for the polymer webs to be used as base substrate for 
the encapsulation of organic devices are as follows:
	
1.	 Uniform surface and low intrinsic surface roughness without 
spikes to support high quality of any coatings on the substrate 
(including active organic layers, transparent electrodes, and 
barrier layers).
	
2.	 Low density of particles and surface defects—typically used 
physical vapor deposition (PVD) and PECVD techniques suffer 
from shadowing effects during layer deposition. Through 
these shadowing, nodular defects are formed at particle and 
surface defect sites (providing accelerated diffusion paths for 
water vapor and oxygen).
	
3.	 High optical transparency and low absorption for front-side 
encapsulation—a high optical transparency is needed to 
maximize the efficiency of OSCs and OLEDs.
	
4.	 Good adhesion of printed and/or vacuum-coated thin films on 
the polymer. A certain level of layer adhesion is required to 
ensure that the thin films can fulfill their desired functionality, 
such as permeation barrier performance.
	
5.	 Mechanical stability versus bending, strain, and scratching—a 
defined level of tensile stress must be applied during roll-to-
roll processing (web tension). The polymer must not strain 
higher than a certain percentage (<0.3%) to avoid damage to, 
e.g., the barrier layers. Specific requirements to scratch and 
abrasion resistance apply, in case the polymer film is exposed 
to the environment.
	
6.	 Long-term stability against moisture and UV light—especially 
in outdoor application, the device is exposed to UV light and 
Encapsulation Substrates and Materials

410
Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
high ambient moisture. The encapsulation must not only 
protect the device but also be intrinsically stable against 
UV and moisture, which is not true for standard-grade PET 
substrates.
	
7.	 Temperature stability for higher processing temperatures 
during thin-film deposition—some processes in organic 
electronics manufacturing require processing temperatures 
of 120°C and above, such as curing of lacquers and lamination 
or PVD deposition of conductive layers. Standard-grade PET 
films exhibit significant shrinkage at 150°C and change their 
properties when exposed to temperatures higher than their 
glass-transition temperature.
	
Polymer film manufacturers have been working for the last two 
decades on the development of suitable polymer substrates for 
manufacturing flexible electronic devices. As of now, no product 
is available that fulfills all the abovementioned requirements, 
especially the low defect and particle density on a large area for a 
reasonable price per square meter. In the recent past, high-quality, 
expensive, planarized PEN polymer films (e.g., TEONEX® Q65FA 
or TEONEX® PQA1 PEN by DuPont Teijin Films) were used as 
substrate for encapsulation films and device manufacturing. These 
films are thermally stabilized to allow processing temperature of 
up to 150°C and have a very smooth surface with minimum particle 
contamination. In contrast, low-cost substrates such as MELINEX® 
400 PET films (also from DuPont Teijin Films) show significantly 
higher particle and surface defect density, have a lower thermal 
stability (shrinkage at 150°C), and degrade under the influence of 
moisture during a longer time of use.
	
A few years ago, DuPont Teijin Films succeeded in producing a 
thermally stabilized and UV stable PET film that is coextruded with 
a peelable protective polymer on the coating surface. Unpeeling 
the coextruded protective layer immediately before deposition 
of gas barrier layers leaves a clean and particle-free surface with 
drastically reduced defect density and so improves the quality of the 
barrier layers. The material is currently being commercialized under 
the brand name “peelable clean surface – PCS.”
	
Besides PET and PEN substrates, high-performance polymers 
are used if a specific application demands superior properties, e.g.:

411
	
∑	 High thermal stability, which is addressed with polyimide (PI) 
or polyether etherketone (PEEK) films, which are stable up to 
250°C (PEEK) or even >300°C (PI).
	
∑	 UV and moisture stability, which can be addressed with 
fluropolymers such as ethyletetetrafluorethylene (ETFE).
	
However, these polymers have other drawbacks preventing them 
from being used for a broad range of applications. Mostly, material 
cost (several $100 per kg), low adhesion of thin films on the material 
(PI and fluoropolymers), low optical transparency (especially PI), 
and minor surface quality in terms of roughness prevent a wider use 
of these polymer substrates for organic device encapsulation.
	
Polymer substrates may be pretreated to improve the substrate’s 
quality prior to their use in organic electronics or for encapsulation. 
The three most common pretreatment methods are as follows:
	
1.	 Surface cleaning to remove particles and dust by, e.g., 
mechanical cleaning using rollers with a sticky surface (tacky 
rollers), ultrasonic-bath cleaning, air jet or CO2 snow cleaning.
	
2.	 Surface planarization by applying either wet-coating (using 
slot-die, reverse gravure or other coating methods) or special 
vacuum-coating techniques (e.g., a liquid–vapor–liquid–solid 
process as described later in Section 10.4.3).
	
3.	 Adhesion promotion by plasma or corona pretreatment of the 
surface directly prior to deposition of the active layers.
	
Especially applying a planarization layer may provide a significant 
difference of an order of magnitude or even more in permeation 
barrier performance of an oxide layer on the substrate.
	
Figure 10.7 shows the WVTRs of reactively sputtered zinc tin 
oxide permeation barrier layers (see Section 10.4.2.2), which have 
been deposited on different polymer substrate products under the 
same process conditions. That example shows a difference of up to 
two orders of magnitude between the lowest WVTR on the clean 
surface PCS PET substrate and the highest WVTR on a standard-
grade PET film.

10.4.1.2 Ultrathin glass
Within the last few years, ultrathin glass was introduced as a 
new substrate type for organic electronics by the large glass 
manufacturers Corning, Asahi Glass, Nippon Electric Glass, and 
Schott. Ultrathin glass is defined as glass with a thickness of 200 µm 
and less going down to even 25 µm. Because of its low thickness and 
because of chemical additives, the glass is bendable with a certain 
radius (a 7.5 cm radius has been demonstrated to work for 100 µm 
glass thickness). In spite of its low thickness, ultrathin glass is still 
virtually impermeable for water vapor and oxygen having a WVTR 
and OTR below the limit of detection of most available permeation 
measurement devices (≪10−5  g/(m²d)). In contrast to inorganic 
coatings on polymer substrates, ultrathin glass does not suffer 
from large local defects that would lead to dead spots in an organic 
device. Also ultrathin glass can be laminated both in sheet-to-sheet 
and in roll-to-roll processes by using well-established encapsulation 
processes and adhesives. Another important advantage of ultrathin 
glass is that the temperature stability allows deposition of high-
performing transparent electrodes on the substrate at typical 
processing temperatures of 250°C or even higher.

413
	
However, the disadvantage of ultrathin glass is its fragility and 
tendency to crack even at fairly low mechanical stress. It is, therefore, 
difficult to handle and often needs to be laminated onto a carrier film 
(mostly a polymer web) for convenient processing. Several research 
groups are currently working on methods for the improved handling 
and processing of ultrathin glass to make roll-to-roll processing on a 
larger roll width and for longer rolls available to the industry.
10.4.2 TFE Materials and Processes
10.4.2.1 Thermal evaporation
Thermal evaporation of aluminum for the metallization of 
polymer substrates for food packaging applications has already 
been a common method for many years. For the manufacturing of 
transparent permeation barrier layers, reactive thermal or electron 
beam evaporation of aluminum (using oxygen as reactive gas) or 
thermal evaporation of under-stoichiometric silicon oxide (SiO) or 
electron beam evaporation of SiOx is used.
	
All these processes have, in common, a very high deposition 
rate and very low deposition costs for producing large areas of 
barrier films with a medium barrier performance. For the thermal 
evaporation of aluminum, usually ceramic boats are used, which 
are heated by applying an electrical voltage. A wire feed guides 
an aluminum wire into the boat, which melts when coming into 
contact with the boat surface. Evaporation rates of several grams per 
minute lead to a dynamic deposition rate of up to 5 µm∙m/min in a 
continuous roll-to-roll process. Oxygen is injected into the process 
chamber to achieve transparent coatings. Thermal evaporation 
of under-stoichiometric SiO is done by filling a crucible with SiO 
granulates and heating the crucible. For electron beam evaporation 
also, a crucible is filled with a solid coating material. A high-power 
electron beam (usually several 10 kV and up to a few 100 kW 
power) periodically scans the material surface and locally melts and 
evaporates the deposition material.
	
Adding plasma (e.g., by using hollow cathode plasma sources) 
to the evaporation process potentially leads to a better barrier film 
quality, reducing the gas transmission rates and improving process 
stability and reproducibility. The plasma assistance can be used 
Encapsulation Substrates and Materials

414
Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
both for thermal and electron beam evaporation. Using evaporation 
processes, WVTRs of about 1 g/m² and day or even less have been 
reported on several substrates such as PET or polypropylene (PP). 
Up till now, no sufficiently low WVTRs for the encapsulation of most 
organic electronic devices have been reported. Furthermore, direct 
TFE of devices using these high-rate evaporation has not been done 
yet, although it is possible if the thermal load on the substrate can 
be kept low. However, with reactive evaporation, a highly productive 
large-scale roll-to-roll process is available for medium permeation 
barrier performance. Industrial roll-to-roll coating machines are 
operating with a coating width of up to 3 m and even higher at a web 
speed up to 10 m/s to produce low-cost packaging films.
10.4.2.2 Plasma-enhanced CVD
One of the most often used TFE methods is PECVD. A plasma 
discharge is used to provide the activation energy for a chemical 
reaction between different reactants (precursor gases) that will 
finally precipitate on the substrate (device or polymer web) as a thin 
layer. A lower substrate temperature is possible with using PECVD in 
comparison to other CVD processes such as hot-wire CVD or thermal 
CVD. As the thermal stability of organic devices and typical polymers 
(e.g., PET webs) is often limited to less than 150°C, PECVD is the 
favorable CVD process.
	
Figure 10.8a illustrates a capacitive parallel plate reactor for 
radio-frequency PECVD. The monomer is injected into the chamber 
either from the side or through holes in the second plate. Several 
modifications of this setup exist to, e.g., add a substrate bias voltage 
or to use non-even formed electrodes to vary ion bombardment on 
the substrate surface. Radio-frequency PECVD is mostly used to 
deposit SiO2 or SiNx barrier layers in a batch-coating process. The 
process pressure typically lies in a range between 5 and 100  Pa. 
Sometimes an inductive coil is used to apply the radio-frequency 
voltage leading to a higher ionization compared to the capacitive 
plasma. Radio-frequency PECVD sources require an impedance 
matching network to maximize power output to the plasma process. 
Also, it is difficult to scale the radio-frequency PECVD process to 
larger coating areas because of the required impedance matching.
	
Microwave sources operating at 2.45 GHz are available for large 
coating areas and are used to deposit SiOx and SiNx barrier layers 

415
on both small and large substrates. Figure 10.8b shows a cross 
section of a linear microwave source. The source design is similar to 
a coaxial waveguide and consists of a copper rod as inner conductor 
surrounded by a quartz tube with a microwave magnetron at each 
end of the tube. While atmospheric pressure is present within the 
tube, the plasma chamber can be evacuated to a pressure in the 
range between 10 Pa and 1000 Pa. Microwaves with a frequency of 
2.45 GHz are generated at both ends of the tube and fed into the 
copper conductor. The microwave PECVD process can be enhanced 
by overlaying a magnetic field with a magnetic flux of 0.087 T to 
the electric field. This magnetic flux corresponds to an electron 
cyclotron resonance (ECR) frequency of 2.45 GHz, increasing the 
energy of the electrons and leading to a higher plasma density. ECR 
plasma sources are widely used for the deposition of microwave 
PECVD barrier layers. However, the deposition of conducting layers 
is not possible using microwave PECVD. Microwave and ECR PECVD 
can also be done at atmospheric pressure, allowing much simpler 
process equipment without having a vacuum vessel.

Also, magnetron plasma sources may be used for generating 
dense PECVD plasmas. Yasuda already described the magnetron-
PECVD process in 1985. However, large-area magnetron-PECVD 
coatings and the application of this process for the deposition of 
permeation barrier layers were first propagated in the 2000s. 
Magnetron PECVD operates at a lower process pressure (0.2–5 Pa) 
compared to other PECVD processes. Often a dual magnetron is 
used as the plasma source. The two magnetron targets are switched 
alternately as cathode and anode with a frequency of 50 kHz. Mostly 
materials with a low sputtering yield are used as target. As the target 
is covered with an oxide layer during the deposition, the amount 
of target material measured in the PECVD layer is very low. Other 
variants of linear mid-frequency plasma sources, such as the plasma 
beam source (PBS), exist with the same goal to scale the PECVD 
process to large coating areas. Very high deposition rates compared 
to microwave or radio-frequency PECVD are achieved for the 
deposition of plasma-polymer layers using either dual-magnetron 
PECVD or dual PBS source.
	
Finally, a hollow cathode, which is normally used for plasma-
assisted reactive evaporation, can be used as the PECVD source for 
TFE or barrier films. High-density plasma can be generated in the 
process chamber to allow a high fragmentation of the monomer in 
the plasma.
	
Typical barrier layer materials deposited by PECVD are silicon 
oxide (SiO2) and silicon nitride (SiNx) or a composite SiOxNy. Some 
widely used monomers are:
	
∑	 Tetramethylsilane (TMS) – Si(CH3)4
	
∑	 Hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) – (CH3)3-Si-O-Si-(CH3)3
	
∑	 Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) – (CH3-CH2-O)4-Si
	
∑	 Silane – SiH4
	
for the deposition of SiO as well as
	
∑	 Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDSN) – (CH3)3-Si-NH-Si-(CH3)3
	
∑	 Silane – SiH4
for the deposition of silicon-nitride barrier layers. PECVD processes, 
thereby, have the great advantage that the composition of the oxide 
layer can be adjusted by changing the amount of monomer and 
reactive gas being injected in-line during the process. Using a low 

417
amount of monomer and a high oxygen flow, SiO or nitride barrier 
layers can be produced. Increasing the monomer flow and at the 
same time reducing the oxygen flow lead to a plasma-polymer layer, 
which can be used as an interlayer in a multilayer barrier. Several 
groups use a PECVD process to deposit multilayer stacks with 
alternating oxide barrier layers and polymer interlayers for low-
stress encapsulation systems by alternately changing the monomer 
and reactive gas flow.
	
The WVTRs of PECVD-based SiOx or SiNx layers on polymers 
strongly depend on the actual process conditions, the monomer, 
plasma source, and the substrate material. The lowest WVTR in the 
10−5 g/(m²d) range at 23°C/50% RH has been reported by using 
a microwave PECVD for SiNx films on PEN substrates using the 
monomer silane with the reactive gas ammoniak (NH3). PECVD has 
been used to successfully encapsulate OLED devices demonstrating 
a lifetime of 10,000 h and more, either with a several-micrometer-
thick SiO layer or a multilayer based on two 100 nm thick silicon-
nitride layers separated by a printed polymer interlayer.
10.4.2.3 Magnetron sputtering
Besides PECVD, sputtering is the most often used technology for 
the deposition of barrier layers for the encapsulation of flexible 
electronic devices. Permeation barrier properties of sputtered layers 
are superior to evaporated layers even for the same layer material.
	
Often rectangular magnetrons and recently also cylindrical/
rotatable magnetrons are used to deposit sputtered oxide or nitride 
barrier layers. The magnetron consists of a sputtering target, which 
is bonded onto a cooling plate. The cooling plate is water cooled on 
the backside to avoid thermal damage to the target. The sputtering 
target itself acts as cathode, and a negative voltage is applied to it 
accelerating inert gas ions (mainly argon) to the target surface after 
the plasma has been ignited. A permanent magnet is installed behind 
the target. The magnetic field overlaps the electric field in a way that 
the electrons are forced onto a cycloid path above the target surface. 
This area is the zone with the highest plasma density leading to the 
typical sputtering racetrack on the surface of a rectangular target. 
For a single magnetron, typically a direct current (DC) or a pulsed DC 
power supply is used. Pulsing the plasma voltage leads to improved 
process stability.
Encapsulation Substrates and Materials

418
Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
	
Sputtering oxide or nitride layers from metallic targets, however, 
requires special attention regarding the coverage of the anode and 
the cathode with electrically isolating oxide/nitride material. The 
electrodes need to be kept metallic (conductive) either by hiding 
the anode behind a special shielding or by using a dual-magnetron 
system. In a dual-magnetron setup, two cathodes are switched 
alternately as cathode and anode in a bipolar process using a mid-
frequency (10–50 kHz) power supply. In case non-conductive oxide 
targets must be used for barrier layer deposition (e.g., intrinsic zinc 
oxide or even SiO), DC or bipolar sputtering cannot be used. In this 
case, a radio-frequency power supply is needed. Radio-frequency 
processes typically have a lower deposition rate compared to DC or 
pulsed DC sputtering.
	
Much attention is paid to the way how the reactive gas is injected 
into the process chamber in a reactive sputtering process. Injecting 
a fixed amount of reactive gas into the process chamber often leads 
to one of the two following situations:
	
1. The reactive gas flow (O2 and/or N2) is too low: In that 
case, sub-stoichiometric layers are formed on the substrate 
having insufficient optical transparency to be used as an 
encapsulation layer on the active side of the device.
	
2. The reactive gas flow is too high and is not fully consumed 
by the sputtered metal atoms: Free reactive gas ions in the 
plasma tend to damage the substrate and—in case of direct 
TFE of the device—lead to instant corrosion of the device’s 
cathode.

(c) Titanium oxide (TiO2)
(b) Silicon oxide (SiO2)

thickness of 300 ± 40 nm.

419
	
Best results have been achieved when the reactive gas flow is 
actively controlled in a proportional–differential–integral control 
loop. Thereby, the control variable can be the discharge voltage, 
the optical emission of excited metal atoms in the plasma, or other 
parameters such as the reactive gas partial pressure. In such a 
controlled process, only the required amount of reactive gas is 
injected to form transparent oxide coatings. The target coverage 
with oxide material is maintained constant, and the partial pressure 
of the reactive gas is kept low.
Figure 10.10 A comparison of the water vapor transmission rates.
	
Many different materials may be deposited as permeation 
barrier/encapsulation coatings by using a sputtering process. 
Figure 10.9 shows cross-sectional, scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) images of different sputtered oxide layers on a PET substrate. 
Figure 10.10 shows a comparison of the WVTRs of these materials 
at different layer thicknesses. It is clearly visible that a dense 
amorphous structure of the layers is favorable for reaching lower 
WVTRs. Al2O3 and zinc tin oxide (ZTO) have a very dense structure, 
as shown in Fig. 10.9a, for ZTO and also a very low WVTR below 
10−2 g/(m²d) at 38°C/90% RH. Other widely used materials are SiO2 
(also having a dense structure but with a slightly increased surface

roughness); ITO, which may serve as a transparent electrode; and 
rarely TiO2, which has a very columnar structure and shows a higher 
WVTR and OTR. Depending on the requirements regarding the 
optical layer properties (refractive index and absorption), Al2O3 (low 
refractive index) or ZTO (higher refractive index) are a good choice 
for manufacturing a barrier film to encapsulate organic electronic 
devices. ZTO, thereby, has a higher deposition rate, which allows 
faster coatings and a higher throughput.
10.4.2.4 Atomic layer deposition
The ALD process can be used to produce very dense, almost defect-
free thin films on different substrates. Sometimes ALD is also 
referred to as atomic layer epitaxy (ALE). The ALD process is based 
on the cyclic alternating injection of two different reactants into 
a processing/coating chamber with intermediate purging steps. 
Figure 10.11 illustrates schematically the different steps of a typical 
ALD cycle.
Figure 10.11 Scheme of an ALD cycle.
	
One cycle begins with injecting the first highly reactive precursor 
(e.g., trimethylaluminum [TMA], Al(CH3)3, for Al2O3 layers). The 
reactant will precipitate onto the substrate and the coating chamber 
walls. In the second step, the coating chamber is purged with an 
inert gas for a certain (longer) time to remove the residual precursor 
material, only leaving a monolayer on the substrate and the chamber 

421
walls. The third step is the injection of a second reactant (e.g., water) 
that reacts on the substrate surface with the first reactant, forming 
usually less than a monolayer of solid oxide material. Finally, another 
purging step is needed to clean the process chamber from the second 
reactant before starting the next cycle.
	
To deposit a 12 nm Al2O3 layer using TMA and water, 
approximately 100 cycles are required. The deposition rate per cycle 
is about 0.12 nm at a substrate temperature between 100°C and 
150°C. The most time-consuming steps within an ALD cycle are the 
purging steps as it must be made sure that all residual precursor gas 
is removed from the substrate and the process chamber before the 
second precursor is injected. Typical cycle times are in the range of 
one to a few minutes, whereas the reactants are injected for less than 
one second to a few seconds and purging is done for about 30–60 s 
at an elevated substrate temperature between 100°C and 175°C for 
Al2O3 coatings. At a lower substrate temperature higher purging 
times are required to achieve a good layer quality.
	
One of the most important properties of the ALD technology is 
the self-limitation of the reaction, which means that the deposition 
rate is equal to or less than a monolayer for each cycle, leading to 
an ideal layer-by-layer growth. Because of that, ALD layers have a 
very high density and a very low number of defects. As the precursor 
gases can enter large trenches or shadowed areas, it can precipitate 
on every surface in the chamber. This means that ALD allows the 
isotropic coating of non-even surfaces, including trenches, particle 
surfaces as well as shadowed areas. Therewith, a very good surface 
defect coverage is expected when coating, e.g., polymer webs 
with residual particles on it. This is a great advantage over PVD 
processes such as evaporation or sputtering. These processes suffer 
from shadowing effects and do not allow the complete coverage 
of particles on a substrate. Consequently, ALD layers reach lower 
WVTRs compared to the other processes even on substrates with 
some particle contamination.
	
The most often ALD-deposited barrier material is Al2O3 using 
the precursors TMA and water (H2O) or ozone (O3). A WVTR in the 
range of 10−4 g/(m²day) or less has been achieved using a 10–25 
nm thick Al2O3 layer on different substrates such as PET, PEN, or PI. 
However, the quality of the substrate surface still plays an important 
role also for the ALD process. A proper cleaning and handling of the 
substrate is required to achieve very low WVTR values less than

10−4 g/(m²day). For other applications also, titanium oxide (TiO2) 
layers are deposited using ALD. However, due to its (nano)crystalline 
structure, TiO2 is not as good as aluminum oxide for permeation 
barrier application. WVTRs less than 3×10−3 g/(m²day) have been 
reported when TiO2 was used.
	
The major drawback of the ALD process is its very low deposition 
rate and therewith productivity. The deposition of a 25 nm thick 
Al2O3 layer requires 200 cycles, meaning a deposition time of 200 
min in a batch-coating process. To improve the deposition rate, 
several groups use a plasma activation or a special precursor gas 
such as ozone. By using a plasma-assisted ALD process, the purging 
time can be reduced by a factor of two or more, leading to a lower 
cycle time of only a few seconds without losing the favorable layer 
properties. Another promising option for increasing productivity 
is switching from a time-separated injection of the precursor gases 
to a spatial distribution of the gas inlet with a moving substrate. 
Several groups introduced spatial and roll-to-roll ALD setups to 
improve the layer deposition drastically. One concept is called the 
“showerhead” principle, in which the gas injection is separated by 
using separated gas nozzles to inject the different process gases. 
Thereby, the substrate moves along a row of gas injection nozzles: 
Every other nozzle is used to purge the chamber with an inert gas, 
whereas the nozzles in between carry alternately the two different 
precursors. This concept also allows roll-to-roll processing. Another 
concept is separating the precursor gases to different chambers of 
a vacuum vessel with an inert gas purged separation chamber in 
between. The substrate is, thereby, repeatedly wound through each 
of the chambers to deposit a barrier layer.
	
Using a roll-to-roll ALD, a WVTR of 10−4 g/(m²day) has been 
reported. However, winding the coated polymer web is still a 
problematic issue in terms of damaging the layer by contact with 
rollers or by mechanical strain.
	
ALD is a favorable process for the direct TFE of organic electronic 
devices, as it allows hermetic sealing of patterns (e.g., pixels/
patterned electrodes) and particles on the substrate surface and is 
less prone to local layer defects leading to dead spots in the device. 
Also, ALD may operate at device-friendly process conditions without 
UV irradiation (which often occurs in plasma processes) and low 
substrate temperatures.

10.4.2.5 Summary of single-layer encapsulation materials
Table 10.2 summarizes important properties of different single-
layer barrier technologies considering not only important process 
properties and productivity but also achievable WVTRs and their 
capability for direct TFE of organic devices.
10.4.3 Multilayer TFE Systems
As discussed before, single layers show very substrate-dependent gas 
permeation and are sensitive to particles and defects in underlying 
layers or the substrate itself. Also, increasing single-layer thickness 
does not mean an improvement in the barrier performance in many 
cases. Shadowing effects just lead to further growth of defects instead 
of covering particles. With increasing single-layer thickness, also 
the mechanical stability of the system is reduced due to increasing 
intrinsic stress in the layer. This results in higher brittleness as well 
as reduced flexibility (bendability).
	
These issues can be addressed by depositing several thin 
inorganic barrier layers that are separated by a polymer interlayer. 
Depending on the substrate, at first a base polymer may be applied 
to planarize the substrate surface and cover the particles on it. After 
the base polymer, an oxide barrier layer is deposited using one of the 
single-layer technologies described earlier. Mostly sputtering and 
PECVD (sometimes also ALD) are used for that. After that a polymer 
layer is deposited on top of the barrier layer to protect it from 
mechanical damage and to cover and planarize defects and particles 
in the barrier layer (see Fig. 10.12, center image for an example). 
Sometimes, the dual layer (barrier + polymer topcoat) is repeated 
several times to form multilayer stacks with alternating barrier and 
polymer layers (see Fig. 10.12, right image). Different methods are 
known for the polymer-layer deposition, which can be commonly 
divided into vacuum technologies and non-vacuum technologies.
	
Among the vacuum technologies, the most well-known process 
is the vacuum liquid–vapor–liquid–solid (LVLS) process. An acrylate 
material is evaporated from a liquid precursor within the vacuum; 
it precipitates on the substrate as liquid viscose material, which 
needs to be cured afterward using, e.g., ultraviolet (UV) light. Based 
on this technology, VITEX Technologies Inc. developed a multilayer 
barrier that can be used as a substrate or TFE for OLED or OPV 

425
devices. Commonly sputtered Al2O3 or SiO2 layers are used as a 
barrier material in the layer stack. WVTRs down to 10−5 g/(m²day) 
have been reported. The PML process has been adapted to a roll-
to-roll coating machine and commercialized by the company 3M 
to manufacture permeation barrier film rolls based on alternating 
sputtered SiO2 barrier layers and acrylate polymer layers.
Figure 10.12 Examples for multilayer barriers for encapsulation of organic 
electronic devices: Left: combination of sputtering and PECVD done in a roll-
to-roll vacuum coater (source: Fraunhofer FEP, 2009); center: combination of 
sputtering and reverse-gravure coating of an ORMOCER® showing good defect 
planarization (source: Fraunhofer POLO®, 2012); right: four dyads of sputtered 
oxide and in-vacuum coated acrylate layers (source: VITEX Systems, 2006).
	
Another way to produce multilayer all-in-vacuum is using a 
plasma-enhanced CVD process to deposit the interlayer. Some 
groups use a PECVD process for making both the barrier layer and 
the interlayer. The processes are based on an adjustment of the 
layer composition by changing the precursor gas flow, e.g., adding 
oxygen to deposit silicon oxide layers or only use a monomer 
such as HMDSO without or with a little amount of oxygen to 
deposit SiOxCyHz plasma-polymer layers. WVTRs in the range of 
10−5  g/(m²day) have been achieved using a graded layer (stack) 
with three inorganic and two organic zones. With a three-layer stack 
based on a combination of reactively sputtered barrier layers with 
interlayers grown by magnetron PECVD, WVTRs in the range of 
1×10−3 g/(m²day) (38°C/90% RH) are obtained on a PET substrate. 
However, as visible in the left image of Fig. 10.12, the PECVD process 
cannot fully planarize a surface particle/defect due to shadowing 
effects that are typical for vacuum deposition techniques with a 
directed particle flow. A surface irregularity remains after PECVD 
coating, although the accelerated path for water diffusion has been 
closed.
	
Improved surface planarization can be achieved using a multilayer 
barrier that uses wet-coated polymer interlayers. Hereby many of 
Encapsulation Substrates and Materials

426
Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
the well-known printing and coating processes can be used, which 
are also used for adhesive application. An example of wet deposition 
of the interlayer is the use of a reverse gravure coating technology 
to apply an ORMOCER® layer to a substrate or pre-coated barrier 
film. The center image in Fig. 10.12 shows a typical three-layer stack 
that consists of two ZTO barrier layers with a thickness between 
150 nm and 200 nm, which are separated by an ORMOCER® hybrid-
polymer layer with 1 µm thickness. An ORMOCER®, thereby, is an 
organic–inorganic hybrid polymer in which functional clusters are 
cross-linked within an organic (polymer) network. A WVTR < 2 × 
10−4 g/(m²day), measured using calcium test at 38°C and 90% RH 
(<5 × 10−5 at 23°C/50% RH) has been reported using this three-layer 
stack on a standard, commercially available PET substrate (Melinex 
400 CW with 75 µm thickness).
	
A combination of PECVD-coated SiN barrier layers and printed 
planarization polymer layers has been proven to provide superior 
encapsulation performance for OLED display and lighting modules 
using just a three-layer stack that consists of two SiN barrier layers 
and one polymer interlayer. The stack is deposited directly on the 
device, showing a WVTR in the range of 10−6 g/(m²day) and an 
OLED device lifetime greater than 10,000 h with virtually no dead 
spot on 10 × 10 cm². Table 10.3 summarizes the properties of 
different multilayer encapsulation, and permeation barrier systems 
showing a WVTR of less than 10−4 g/(m²d) are possible even in roll-
to-roll processing. These are already near the requirements from 
organic devices for encapsulation systems. However, independent 
from the specific thin-film technique used, it is important to keep in 
mind that device encapsulation is not based only on a permeation 
barrier performance and low water vapor or OTR. Many different 
properties of the encapsulation systems need to be considered when 
selecting one for device encapsulation. These properties comprise, 
for example:
 
∑	 Optical properties of the layer stack, including transparency, 
absorption, and reflection as well as haze to optimize light 
incoupling to OSCs and optical sensors and light outcoupling 
from OLED devices.
	
∑	 UV stability of the encapsulation and UV absorption/reflection 
to protect the organic device in an outdoor application.

∑	 Thermal stability: The barrier film is laminated onto the

protect the organic device against moisture, often used plastic 
substrates are not stable against moisture in long-term use 
(such as PET). If the substrate directly faces the environment, 
it must be protected against the ingress of moisture, or a 
hydrolysis-resistant substrate must be used.
10.4.4 Encapsulation Sealants and Barrier Adhesives
Transport of gases and vapors through polymers is a complex 
phenomenon, and its comprehension needs to establish a correlation 
between different mechanisms and laws, relating solubility and 
transport in polymer layers to their molecular properties, the nature 
of the permeates, and the polymer morphology. As reported in Section 
10.3, the permeability of a gas or a vapor through a dense polymeric 
barrier can be described by the Fickian diffusion model where the 
diffusion coefficient D determines how fast the permeant can move 
in the barrier, and the solubility coefficient S determines how much 
of the permeate can be dissolved in the barrier. It is important to 
underline that the diffusion coefficient is a kinetic parameter, while 
the solubility coefficient is a thermodynamic parameter. They show 
opposite trends in combination with thermal effects. Moreover, as 
described in Section 10.3.3, organic devices are usually encapsulated 
in an inert atmosphere where the initial device conditions and the 
concentration gradient in the barrier film/encapsulation are in a non-
equilibrium condition. In this process, three different phases can be 
identified: (1) the first phase in transient regime, the lag time, during 
that the barrier starts to be filled and an increasing of permeant flux 

429
inside the encapsulated system is observed; (2) the second phase 
characterized by a constant distribution of the permeant inside 
the barrier and a resulting constant flux. The steady-state regime 
can identify the barrier WVTR; (3) the third period where a flux 
decreasing is observed due to a reduced concentration gradient of 
the penetrant. The competition between transient and steady-state 
regimes is strongly affected by the type of encapsulation system 
and by the adopted adhesive polymers. An overview about different 
types of encapsulation is given in Section 10.2. Here, we analyze 
the properties of adhesive polymers by considering functional 
and composition characteristics. From a functional point of view, 
adhesives can be classified in “passive” systems if they work like a 
physical barrier to the permeate or “active” systems when a physical 
or chemical interaction between adhesives and permeates takes 
place.
10.4.4.1 Passive adhesives
In the case of passive systems, the steady-state regime is strongly 
prevalent, and permeation can be reduced through two main 
approaches: (1) to employ a polymer with intrinsically low 
permeability and (2) to increase the tortuosity of the diffusion path 
by dispersing a defined amount of impermeable particles in the 
polymer matrix.
	
Regarding the first approach, transport properties strongly 
depend on the free volume within the polymer and on the mobility 
of the polymer chains. For instance, polymers with low glass-
transition temperatures show greater segmental mobility and a 
higher diffusivity. Moreover, matrix cross-linking level and polymer 
molecular weight can influence the transport process. With 
increasing molecular weight, the number of chain ends, representing 
a material discontinuity, decreases and the diffusivity can be reduced 
up to a factor of 10. Other polymer structure modifications can be 
considered, such as the introduction of bulky or reactive substituents 
able to induce an increasing rigidity of the polymer backbone and a 
decreasing free volume available for the diffusion of the permeant 
molecules. In the opposite direction, the addition of plasticizers 
to a polymer matrix, including glycidyl ethers of aliphatic, aryl 
aliphatic glycols, di- and poly-carboxylic acids, polyester-polyols, 
results in increased segmental mobility and generally in increased 
Encapsulation Substrates and Materials

430

permeate transport. To perform a correct evaluation about polymer 
chain mobility, “dynamic mechanical thermal analysis” (DMTA) 
can be applied in determining critical parameters such as the glass 
transition (Tg), the storage modulus €, the loss factor (tan δ), and the 
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE).
	
The second approach to reduce the steady-state permeation is 
represented by the introduction of a filler material. Nanometric silica 
filler particles are generally adopted and finely dispersed in epoxy 
resins. For specific applications, also zirconia and titania particles 
can be introduced. The goal is to reduce the free volume and to 
increase the diffusion tortuosity according to the volume fraction 
of the filler as well as the shape and distribution of particles. When 
the filler is finely distributed into the matrix, the barrier rigidity is 
also increased due to lower polymer chain mobility. Moreover, as a 
function of nanoparticle surface properties, a physical interaction to 
the polymer chains can also be induced through dipole interactions 
to polymer functional groups resulting in a physical cross-linking 
and a subsequent lower chain mobility. Some drawbacks must also 
be mentioned: If the filler is incompatible with the polymer, if its 
content is excessively high, or if a suitable interaction is not obtained 
at the filler–polymer interface, voids tend to occur at the interface 
with opposite results: an increase in the free volume of the system 
and higher permeability. An inorganic filler content can be evaluated 
by submitting the sealant to a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) 
where the degradation of the epoxy resin is generally promoted in 
an oxygen gas flowing up to 600–650°C and the remaining inert 
filler can be easily detected. The distribution of filler particles can be 
detected by SEM analysis where filler–polymer interfaces can also 
be investigated.
	
So far, we have discussed a steady-state regime for barrier 
adhesive by focusing on permeation through an adhesive. However, 
as described in Section 10.2.1, the second mechanism for parasitic 
permeation is the permeation at the interface between substrate 
surface and the edge seal material and this effect can become 
relevant. For this reason, it is mandatory to adopt barrier adhesives 
that can assure a suitable adhesion strength and produce defects-
free interfaces. In this regard, the adhesive chemical structure with 
its functional groups, the employment of polar flexibilizers such as 
polyols and acids, and the selection of an appropriate photo-initiator 

431
with a counterion able to balance the cure speed and the nucleophilic 
behavior are critical factors to modulate the chains mobility in 
determining a regular interface. However, the viscoelastic properties 
of the barrier must be carefully investigated: An increased chain 
mobility enables higher adhesion forces, however, on the other 
hand leads to higher permeability of water vapor and oxygen in the 
polymer. Chain mobility is accessible through measuring the shear 
strength of the adhesive in a lap shear test setup.
10.4.4.2 Active adhesives and getters
The employment of a polymer with intrinsically low permeability 
and the introduction of an inert filler material to produce a barrier 
adhesive are typical approaches for reducing the steady-state 
permeation. This phenomenon is regulated by the concentration 
gradient between the inside and outside parts of the barrier. 
Permeation is driven by the difference in the external and internal 
permeant concentrations. The available technologies do not ensure 
making permeation across the sealing material negligible. However, 
in order to limit the growth of dark spot areas and pixel shrinkage 
in organic electronics devices below values that significantly affect 
the device uniformity, the maximum pressure for some dangerous 
permeants (H2O and O2) has to be maintained at a very low level. 
For example, the H2O pressure has to be limited inside at ~ 1.1 × 
10−4 Torr. The more efficient way to control the H2O and O2 partial 
pressures is to adopt a combination of a “getter” material with the 
adhesive to make the barrier an “active barrier.”
	
Usually, a “getter” is a material, a composite, or an alloy being 
able to capture gaseous impurities according to the following 
key characteristics: (1) very fast kinetics of the capture process 
(adsorption, chemical reaction); (2) suitable capacity in terms 
of weight of specific chemical species captured per unit weight of 
getter; and (3) also high activity for low partial pressure of a specific 
chemical species in equilibrium with the getter.
	
Different getter systems can be considered (pure metals, metal 
alloys, inorganic materials, or organic–inorganic composites), but due 
to their peculiar characteristics, getter materials based on organic–
inorganic polymer composites are the ideal systems for integration 
in organic electronics devices. Proper assessment of different getter 
materials for organic electronic devices is essential for choosing a 
Encapsulation Substrates and Materials

432
Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
more suitable solution as well as for accurately designing the dryer 
accommodation inside the device. In this regard, the characterization 
of getter characteristics and performances is extremely important: 
Measurements of sorption performances in conditions as close as 
possible to the operating conditions expected to occur in the final 
application must be addressed. Specific methods to measure the 
theoretical total capacity, initial pumping speed, and dependence of 
pumping speed on capacity have to be developed. Three different 
methods are continually optimized in this regard: (1) volumetric 
test, (2) microgravimetric test, and (3) climatic cell exposure test. In 
a volumetric test, sorption performances are measured by exposing 
the sample, under vacuum, to a constant pressure of a specific gas. 
Gas pressure drop occurring in a known sampling volume directly 
connected to the test volume is measured, and weight gain versus 
time can be calculated. The main information that can be obtained 
from such a test is the initial pumping speed of the getter. Only 
limited information is given on the effective capacity of the getter. 
In a microgravimetric test, sorption performances are measured by 
means of a test with the sample exposed to a defined concentration 
of gas in a nitrogen backfilling at atmospheric pressure. Weight 
change versus time is gained, and sorption speed versus capacity 
can be calculated. The gas level can be adjusted, and it is set close 
to the typical concentration expected to occur inside an organic 
electronic device (10 ppm for moisture). The main information that 
can be obtained is the initial pumping speed but also the dependence 
of pumping speed on capacity. The climatic cell exposure test is the 
simplest and most widely used measurement method for moisture 
evaluation, especially as an incoming inspection control. Samples are 
exposed to a defined atmosphere inside a climatic cell. Temperature 
and RH are controlled (usually 25°C, 55% RH; 85°C, 85% RH; or 
60°C, 90% RH). Weight increase is measured periodically.
	
The main information that can be obtained from such a test is the 
getter total capacity for water, which is directly related to the content 
of the active absorbing material in the getter system. Information on 
sorption speed can be obtained only if the weight gain is frequently 
measured during early stages of the test. Figure 10.13 shows an 
example of a gravimetric test result for a polymer-composite-
based getter material. The sorption capacity is determined by the 

433
saturation of the weight increase after a longer time. Sorption speed 
can be characterized from the slope of the weight increase during 
the initial stage of the test (in the example within the first 3 min).
Figure 10.13 Weight increase of a polymer composite getter material over 
time.
	
Particular interest has been devoted to the formulation of 
active materials based on polymer composite systems where the 
peculiar characteristics of organics, such as easy handling and 
processing, flexibility, fast polymerization kinetics, and tunable 
consolidation mechanisms, are combined with the high reactivity 
of inorganic materials. Irreversible H2O sorber materials are based 
on powders of one or more alkaline earth metal oxides chosen 
from oxides of calcium, strontium, barium, and magnesium, while 
reversible materials are generally based on aluminosilicates with 
particular reference to molecular sieves, zeolites, silica gel, or clay. 
Organometallic systems are also adopted, but their thermodynamic 
instability and evolution of by-products are factors that limit their 
application.
	
Oxygen scavengers are based on substances or mixtures that 
chemically or enzymatically react with oxygen. They are generally 
composed of iron powder, ascorbic acid, unsaturated fatty acids such 
as oleic and linoleic acids, enzymes such as glucose oxidase, alcohol 
oxidase, hydrocarbons, unsaturated polymers, co-polyamides and 
transition metals, photosensitive dyes, and immobilized yeasts 
in solid materials. The formulation of homogenous polymer 
composite materials is strongly related to the achievement of host–
guest interactions able to assure a fine distribution of the active 
Encapsulation Substrates and Materials

434
Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
component. Frequently these interactions are limited at the physical 
level, but dipole moments with the polymer chain or the organization 
of oriented structures can be particularly effective to promote a 
getter dissolution at the molecular level. When a similar interaction 
is not obtained, it is fundamental to come across any filler–matrix 
incompatibility to avoid aggregation of particles, segregation, 
or occurrence of voids at the interface level. In this regard, active 
particles can be modified by introducing a capping agent able to 
regulate the surface properties in tuning physical interactions to the 
polymer chains.
	
In detail, a chemically tailored particle surface ensures favorable 
properties such as (1) high affinity with the matrix, (2) no phase 
segregation, (3) no leaking pathways within the substrate–scavenger 
interphase due to particles wetting, (4) higher transparency of 
films in the visible wavelength range due to reduced discontinuity 
of refraction index across the particle–matrix interphase, and (5) 
improved adhesive properties due to particles wetting. Moreover, 
when a reactive material is adopted in polymer composite active 
materials, the capturing mechanisms are mainly based on the 
chemical properties of the getter component. In this case, the 
filler material reacts through a strong chemical bond with the 
undesired permeant species; the transport process is affected by a 
modification in composition and a resulting change in some factors 
that influence the diffusion and solubility: filler particle size, surface 
and interfacial energies, matrix viscoelastic properties, and physical 
state of the permeant. The ability to compensate this evolution is 
one of the key characteristics of polymer composite materials, which 
require a careful designing activity. Reversible getter materials 
can also be adopted where no modification in particle size or in 
other properties can be managed. In that case, it is fundamentally 
important to focus on reversible materials where the interaction 
between the permeate and the “active material” is related to suitable 
energy sites. For instance, in nanostructured zeolites, water is bound 
primarily to extra-framework cations and, for specific compositions, 
any desorption process at temperature lower than 150°C can be 
excluded.
	
If inert particles are applied to produce an efficient permeation 
barrier, the sealant works like a passive homogeneous barrier and 
moisture permeability depends mainly on its diffusion into the 

435
sealant material. However, if suitable materials are introduced to 
trap the permeant through physical or chemical interactions, the 
permeate solubility in the barrier is also modified. In this approach, 
the permeability becomes a more complex function of solubility 
and diffusion coefficients, while the transition time or “lag time” 
is strongly increased. Moreover, a new parameter is introduced: 
the “breakthrough time” that describes the time needed for the 
permeate gas to pass throughout the barrier and start permeating 
into the protected device. Within the “breakthrough time,” the 
WVTR is practically zero and no degradation mechanism occurs. 
In these transient conditions, the permeation evaluation is very 
complex and standard analysis techniques are not efficient because 
they can measure only the WVTR in the quasi-stationary conditions 
with high uncertainty in the lag-time measurements. Recently, a new 
spectroscopic method has been introduced where the investigation is 
based on the spatial mapping of the peaks in the FTIR spectrum that 
are correlated with the presence of moisture. A spatially resolved IR 
transmittance signal of hydroxyl (–OH groups) combination peak for 
typical stretching and bending frequencies can be used in defining 
a 2D or 3D map of moisture diffusion front (see Fig. 10.14 for an 
example). So far SAES Getter S.p.A is the only manufacturer of active 
polymer composites.

10.4.5 Types of Adhesives with Respect to Their 
Processing
In order to obtain high-performance barriers, every component 
of barrier adhesives has to be diligently tuned. Depending on the 
process requirements, different types of adhesives can be adopted: 
UV-curable adhesives, hot-melt adhesives, and PSAs. Moreover, it is 
important to mention that the terms “adhesive” and “sealant” are 
frequently used as synonyms, but they represent different material 
classes as their peculiar characteristics are different. In detail, 
a sealant is mainly adopted to seal any space that exists between 
surfaces where they are applied to present a watertight area, while 
an adhesive is used to bind one surface to another and not to seal the 
space in between. Based on different final applications, sealants and 
adhesives are formulated in different ways in their main structure 
and composition to obtain higher rigidity and strength for adhesives 
and higher malleability and lower strength for sealants, as well as 
higher viscosity for adhesives and easier processability for sealants. 
Despite this, the following classification in UV-curable, pressure-
sensitive, and hot-melt systems can be adopted for both adhesive 
and sealant materials.
10.4.5.1 UV-curable adhesives
In the last years, the development of UV-curing technology has 
provided new emphasis to the formulation of performant adhesives 
and sealants due to some interesting benefits: low content of volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs), no time constraints, no waste, and fast 
curing process. UV-curable adhesives can be classified into two 
major groups: cationic and free radical. In the case of free-radical 
adhesives, one of the major advantages is the very fast curing process 
related to the polymerization mechanism where the UV-radiation-
promoted bond scission in radical photo-initiator molecules induces 
the production of free radicals for a fast initiation process (curing 
start). A typical UV-curing process is performed by applying an 
irradiance of 100 mW/cm2 for 15–30 s for a resulting UV dose of 
1.5–3 J/cm2. However, oxygen can work like a radical scavenger and 
an oxygen atmosphere can slow or even inhibit the curing process 
and requires a higher UV dose. For this reason, the employment of 
free-radical adhesives in air atmosphere must be combined with 

437
optimized composition, high reactive photo-initiators, and suitable 
light sources.
	
The second class of UV adhesives is made of cationic formulations 
where no radical is produced during the polymerization process, 
but under UV light, a strong acid is activated, independently from 
the oxygen presence, to catalyze the polymerization process. For 
this reason, the curing process of cationic adhesives proceeds 
slower than free-radical systems. A thermal post-treatment is 
often recommended to complete the polymerization process, but 
the cured formulations show improved thermal and mechanical 
stability. A typical UV-curing process is performed by using UV light 
sources with a minimum irradiance of 100 mW/cm2 for 60–90 s for 
a resulting UV dose of 6–9 J/cm2. Often, a UV light source with an 
emission maximum at 365 nm is used.
	
Epoxy resins are characterized by high chemical and corrosion 
resistance, good mechanical and thermal properties, outstanding 
adhesion to various substrates, low shrinkage upon cure, good 
electrical insulating properties, and the ability to be processed 
under a variety of conditions. They represent a versatile class 
of cationic sealing materials for barrier-adhesive production. 
Commercial epoxy resins are generally composed of cycloaliphatic 
epoxy resins or epichlorohydrin–phenol formaldehyde resins; they 
contain aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, or aromatic backbones and are 
formulated like solventless and single-component products able to 
produce, after curing, a highly cross-linked network. According to the 
required physical and chemical properties, processing methods, and 
curing conditions, a wide variety of curing agents can be adopted, 
for example Lewis bases such as tertiary amines or Lewis acids such 
as boron trifluoride monoethylamine. The photoinitiated cationic 
curing of epoxy resins has received great interest during the last 
years for the application of coatings from solvent-free or high solid 
systems. In this regard, salt photo-initiators such as onium salts, 
ferrocenium salts, or diazonium salts are frequently adopted for the 
photocleaving activation for epoxy ring-opening polymerization, 
which represents a fundamental step in the curing and cross-linking 
reaction.
	
Cationic UV-curable systems are preferred in comparison to free-
radical systems because they do not show oxygen sensitivity and have 
excellent adhesion, moderate shrinkage, and a reasonable humidity 
Encapsulation Substrates and Materials

438
Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
resistance. No oxygen sensitivity means that a lower photo-initiator 
concentration can be adopted with resulting less VOC content, e.g., 
benzene, propylene carbonate, diphenyl sulfide, propionaldehyde, 
and 2-propenal. The impact of VOCs can be very dangerous for final 
devices due to their chemical and physical reactivities, especially 
when in contact with organic semiconductors. For this reason, their 
content should be evaluated by headspace gas chromatography (HS-
GC). Moreover, if some specific materials are placed in direct contact 
with cationic UV-curable resins, they will affect the polymerization 
kinetics up to totally inhibiting the curing process. Modified systems 
such as epoxide–acrylate resins are preferred for application on 
plastic and metal coatings. In these systems, the combination 
of cationic and free-radical mechanisms can improve the curing 
process and the achievement of final properties. In general, UV 
cationic adhesives and sealants must be selected carefully and 
their characteristics synchronized with process constrains and 
application requirements.
	
The manufactures of passive UV-curable adhesives for organic 
electronics include Henkel, Three Bond, Adhesive Research, DELO, 
Nagase, and SAES Getters.
10.4.5.2 Pressure-sensitive adhesives
Pressure-sensitive adhesives are non-structural adhesives that 
can stick to a surface through the application of a moderate 
pressure. PSAs are viscoelastic solids where the hysteresis of the 
thermodynamic work of adhesion is established through a molecular 
contact with the surface and the only active interface forces are van 
der Waals forces. To ensure proper adhesion properties, adhesive 
composition has to be finely tuned and typical polymer matrices 
such as rubber, acrylates, styrene-based copolymers, and silicones 
are adopted. Tackifying components are generally introduced to 
tune the adhesive–substrate interface properties, to modulate the 
glass-transition temperature (Tg), and to optimize the dissipative 
properties. Cross-linking agents are used to avoid flow and, once the 
adhesive has been coated, to prevent creep.
	
The main properties of PSAs are stickiness, strain hardness 
at high level of strain, and good resistance to a continuous shear 
force. To be sticky upon contact with the surface, PSAs must ensure 
tack properties at a given temperature and show high viscoelastic 

439
dissipation (typical broad glass-transition phase with an onset value 
25–50°C lower that the usage temperature). Moreover, the stickiness 
to the touch is strongly dependent on the formation of bridging 
fibrils under pulling stress. In detail, during a detachment, a process 
of cavity growth from the interface is induced and controlled by the 
elastic modulus of the adhesive, while the subsequent formation of 
fibrils arising from the wall cavities is strictly related to the elongation 
properties. In particular, the ability to strain harden at a high level of 
strain is a fundamental property of PSAs to ensure a right level of 
elongation strain and can be obtained through the definition of the 
matrix composition in terms of a cross-linking degree and molecular 
weight distribution. Finally, the level of chemical or physical cross-
linking is also fundamental in avoiding any Newtonian viscosity 
behavior at a fixed temperature and to determine the ability of PSAs 
to maintain a moderate level of stress for a long time.
	
A critical aspect in PSA technology is the protection of the 
adhesive surface before using it. Due to the sticky characteristics of 
adhesives, dust particles can easily contaminate the adhesion surface 
and a protection layer is needed. Typically, this issue is solved by 
combining the sticky side of the adhesive to a tape (high adhesion 
needed) and by covering the adhesive surface with a protective film 
(low adhesion), which can be cleanly peeled without damaging the 
adhesive properties. Selected polymers, including silicone matrices, 
polymers with long alkyl or fluoroalkyl side chains, fluoropolymers, 
and polyolefins, are used as protective films to provide a surface 
energy lower than that of PSAs to ensure the key features of release 
materials. Generally, poly(vinyl carbamates) are adopted for the 
back side of tapes.
10.4.5.3 Hot-melt adhesives
Hot-melt adhesives represent a class of thermoplastic materials 
that are solid at room temperature but melt and resolidify during 
heating and cooling steps, respectively. When heated above their 
melting point, they become fluid and can wet the surface to which 
they are applied. An amount of hot-melt fluid is applied on a surface, 
which is brought in contact with another surface. By cooling the 
adhesive below the solidification temperature, the substrates are 
bonded. Typically, a process of heating and lamination is performed 
under vacuum to optimize the adhesion strength. Compared to other 
Encapsulation Substrates and Materials

440
Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
adhesive types, where solidification is obtained through thermal 
and UV-promoted polymerization mechanisms or through solvent 
evaporation, hot-melt adhesives convert from a hot fluid to a solid by 
a cooling process. Hot-melt materials may provide some advantages 
over the use of liquid adhesives in terms of higher lamination speeds 
and easier integration in roll-to-roll processing.
	
Hot-melt formulations contain polymers to provide strength and 
cohesion while being hot (providing resistance to separation while 
the adhesive is hot). They also have tackifiers and low-molecular-
weight components to dilute the polymer entanglement network, 
modulate the glass-transition temperature, tune the viscosity, and 
improve the wet-out properties related to the molecular contact of 
the adhesive with the substrate over the entire bonding area.
	
Typical organic matrices include polyamide, ethylene vinyl acetate 
(EVA), ethylene propylene diene rubber (EPDM), polyisobutylene 
(PIB), and other polyolefin varieties available in different forms 
and are selected according to the final application requirements. To 
define the hot-melt characteristics, the organic matrix is generally 
combined with inert fillers to set rheological properties in melt form 
and mechanical properties in solid state. Hindered phenols and 
amines are added as aging resistors (antioxidant and UV stabilizer). 
Silane modifiers are used to allow filler–matrix interactions and to 
ensure suitable adhesion properties. Some hot-melt adhesives can 
remain permanently sticky, ensuring an excellent adhesive bond 
even when the glue is cold. In this case, the required contact pressure 
is the key to creating a sufficient contact area between the adhesive 
and the joined part. Because of that property, this group of adhesives 
is often referred to as pressure-sensitive hot-melt adhesives.
	
The main advantages of hot-melt adhesives are reduced amount 
of waste, little or no solvent component, rapid bonding action, high-
volume processing, and low-cost production. Hot-melt adhesives 
are typically provided in steel drums and dispensed using a hot-melt 
applicator, but engineered formulations can also be supplied in the 
form of pellets suitable for direct application by using an extruder 
linked to the dispensing module. The manufactures of hot-melt 
adhesives include 3M, FPC Corp., Heartland Adhesives, Bostik Ink, 
Henkel Loctite, and SAES Getters S.p.A for active hot-melt adhesives 
(with water/oxygen-absorbing functionality).

10.5 Encapsulation Processing
This section gives an overview of the encapsulation process itself—
the process of combining the organic electronic device with an 
encapsulation product, such as a glass cover or a barrier film. The 
section covers the preparation of the module components, methods 
for applying the adhesives, and processing issues, especially for roll-
to-roll processing of flexible devices.

10.5.1 Barrier Film and Device Preparation
10.5.1.1 Clean atmosphere
Depending on the process, it is necessary to define conditions for 
a clean room during the coating and encapsulation process. Clean 
room conditions can be realized for the entire room where the 
processes are performed or only in the surroundings of the process 
or the process plant itself. Laminar flow units are used to define 
the atmosphere and cleanliness inside a processing machine. With 
these units, it is possible to realize zones with a low volume of dust 
and particles. In laminar zones, a purified, vertical or horizontal 
Encapsulation Processing

442
Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
air flow is applied. The size of these zones is defined with curtains 
or encapsulated areas. Laminar flow units allow minimizing the 
particle concentration in the air.
10.5.1.2 Inert atmosphere
An inert atmosphere in the surrounding of the product is essential to 
protect the sensitive organic layer against oxidation- and humidity-
induced degradation. Mostly nitrogen is used as an inert gas. To 
realize an inert concentration of approximately 2 ppm or less oxygen 
and water vapor, it is necessary to encapsulate the complete process 
plant with a hermetic casing (see Fig. 10.15). Most often, a glove box 
design is chosen to give the operator of the plant the chance to make 
adjustments without opening the enclosure. Mostly, the plant is 
divided into different sections to separate the wet-coating processes, 
the drying station, and the unwinding and rewinding units from each 
other. Such a machine design allows to change material rolls without 
contaminating the atmosphere in the coating or drying modules.

coating line.
10.5.2 Application of Adhesives
10.5.2.1 Coating and printing techniques
In general, one distinguishes between coating and printing 
techniques depending on the layer design. The term “coating” 
refers to processes in which a closed, uniform layer is applied to the 
substrate. In the case of patterned layer design, “printing” processes 

443
are used. In general, a high performance and productivity of the 
coating or printing process is necessary. Solution-coating processes 
for printed electronics need to fulfill the following requirements in 
addition to applying virtually defect-free layers:
	
∑	 Cross-web homogeneity of layer thickness of less than ±1%.
	
∑	 Possibility for deposition of layers with a wet thickness less 
than 1 µm—dry less than 100 nm.
	
∑	 Down-web uniformity of the layer thickness over 24  h 
continuous processing.
	
∑	 Printing texture up to 2 pt (≈ 0.7 mm) resolution.
	
The coating technologies may be classified into self-metered 
and pre-metered techniques. In self-metered coating, the applied 
coating weight depends on the process. In some known dip-coating 
processes, the speed of substrate defines the coating thickness. In 
the case of roller coating, the speed of the roller and the gap between 
the rollers define the coating thickness, and in the case of knife-
edge coating, the gap between the knife and the substrate defines 
the coating thickness. Pre-metered coating means that the applied 
coating weight does not depend on the process, e.g., slot-die coating 
and spray coating where the pumping speed of the dosing systems 
mainly defines the coating thickness.
	
Slot-die coating technologies are characterized by capillary 
forces, which act between the slot die and the substrate. The 
distances between the slot die and the substrate are often less 
than 200 µm. A very low wet-film thickness (~ 1 µm) is possible at 
substrate speeds of up to 50 m/min, and wet-film thicknesses can 
be obtained at substrate distances that are 300 times larger than the 
wet-film thickness. Different slot-die operations are defined by the 
length of the gap between the slot die and the substrate. For many 
applications, it is necessary to apply an intermitted design of the 
coating layer (see Fig. 10.16). KROENERT is offering two different 
intermitted slot-die coating processes. The coating material supply 
can be controlled and periodically switched on and off either by 
installing a rotating bar in the slot die or by using a valve in front of 
the die.
	
Roller technologies can be used for printing as well as coating 
processes. In the case of printing, the application roller is in contact 
with the substrate, while coating procedures can be with or without 
Encapsulation Processing

444
Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
contact. The advantage of roller technology is its flexibility in use. 
Depending on the running direction of the application roller and 
the design of the roller, it is possible to realize coating and printing 
operation with the same coating device. For printing application, 
engraving of the roller need to be defined for the highest resolution. 
Hexagonal cell and structure engravings are used, and in the case of 
coating application, all kinds of line engraving may be applied.
	
Alternatively, an indirect or flexo printing technology is used 
for printing applications. An engraved roller transports the coating 
slurry out of a tank system and transfers it to the flexo roller in a 
high-speed printing process. Also, rotary screen technology is used 
for printing processes. This technology is used mainly for thicker 
lines and designs, for instance, to interconnect solar cells with 
printed conducting lines.
Figure 10.16 Continuous (left) and intermitted (right) slot-die coating.
10.5.2.2 Lamination processing
The coated device film and the barrier film are unwound and guided 
with guiding rollers to the lamination roller pair. Between the 
lamination roller pair, the substrates are guided together. Typically, 
three different methods are defined for roll-to-roll barrier film 
lamination according to the distance of the lamination rollers: air 
lamination, gap lamination, and pressure lamination (Fig. 10.17).
Air lamination: For air lamination, the lamination rollers have a 
large distance. No pressure is applied to the barrier film. The top 
substrate is pressed onto the lower substrate only by its own weight. 
The adhesion is highly influenced by the substrate weight of the 
top film and is considerably low because of that. This technology is 

445
used for very sensitive substrates that are prone to damage when 
pressure is applied.
Gap lamination: In gap lamination, the distance between the 
lamination rollers is set to approximate the sum of the thicknesses 
of the two films to be laminated together. This technology is mainly 
used for a sensitive device structure because of the low pressure 
being applied to the two substrates.
Pressure lamination: In pressure lamination, the gap between the 
lamination rollers is set to near zero. The substrates are pressed 
with a very high pressure toward each other. Because of the high 
pressure, the adhesion is very good in the case of good adhesive 
properties. However, pressure-sensitive systems and films might be 
damaged in a pressure lamination process.
Figure 10.17 Overview about different lamination process types.
10.5.3 Substrate and Device-Handling Requirements
Flexible substrates are required to produce bendable, conformable, 
and flexible organic devices. Mostly, PET, PEN, and PI films are used 
as basic substrates. These films are delivered as rolls to the machine. 
During the different process steps, it is necessary to monitor the 
tension during all wet coating as well as lamination processes.
10.5.3.1 Wet-coating processes
Often the substrate is handled under different temperature 
conditions during wet-coating and drying processes. However, 
elastic properties of polymer materials change with increasing 
temperature. To realize a perfectly even and constant coating-layer 
thickness and coating-film stability, it is necessary to handle the 
substrate under different tension conditions. The coating process is 
usually done at room temperature without impairing the polymeric 
Encapsulation Processing

446
Encapsulation of Organic Electronics
stability of polymer films. However, drying and curing processes 
can be critical as the substrate has to withstand temperatures up to 
180°C depending on the drying and curing process parameters. The 
elastic modulus of the polymer is reduced at that temperature, which 
results in a much higher strain when the same web tension is applied 
as at room temperature. For example, the elastic modulus of a PET 
is reduced from 3700 MPa at room temperature to approximately 
900 MPa at 120°C, resulting in four times higher elongation at the 
same tension. The larger strain potentially causes damage or even 
delamination of the coating. Reducing tension for high-temperature 
processing helps to reduce or eliminate damaging effects on the 
coating and the polymer.
10.5.3.2 Encapsulation processes
The barrier or protective films are often coated with thin ceramic 
or other inorganic layers to realize the requested high water and 
oxygen barrier properties. These barrier films must be used in a 
sensitive way because at extremely high tension, the barrier layer 
may be easily destroyed. Process experiences exist with a tension 
adjustment to nearly zero. Guiding the material through a (roll-to-
roll) processing machine, however, requires at least a minimum 
web tension. Without tension, the substrate would move from left to 
right in an uncontrolled way. The substrate film itself has a certain 
elasticity. A very high tension would damage the barrier layer, which 
does not have the same elasticity as the substrate. Therefore, perfect 
tension control and monitoring is essential.
10.6 Conclusion
The term “encapsulation” refers to both materials and processes for 
the packaging of organic electronic devices to protect them against 
extrinsic degradation factors such as reactive chemicals and gases 
(oxygen, water vapor), radiation (UV light), and mechanical impacts 
(scratches, punctual loads). While rigid devices are commonly 
packed between glass sheets, flexible (meaning bendable and 
conformable) devices rely on coated flexible polymer films as 
encapsulation material. As water vapor is a critical degradation 
factor for organic devices and as polymers are highly permeable 

447
to water vapor, much attention has been paid to reducing water 
vapor permeability of polymers by coating them with transparent 
metal oxide layers or layer stacks that consist of alternating oxide 
and polymer layers. These coated films are referred to as “barrier 
films” or “encapsulation films.” The figures of merit to compare 
different encapsulation films are the WVTR and OTR. Understanding 
the measurement of these quantities and selecting the right 
measurement conditions and time are essential to correctly judge 
and compare the performance of different barrier films. The same 
barrier film has different permeation rates under different ambient 
conditions and while determining the WVTR with different methods 
and evaluation algorithms.
	
It is important to understand that the WVTR of a barrier film does 
not translate directly into a lifetime of an encapsulated device. The 
relationship between barrier performance and device degradation 
is still a hot topic in current research, which explores the behavior 
of defects in the encapsulation, the intrinsic permeation through the 
system, and side diffusion through adhesives in the module with 
respect to the degradation behavior of the device. In any case, the 
device itself is the best measure for performance and applicability of 
an encapsulation system.
	
The permeability of water vapor and/or oxygen is just one of the 
several properties of an encapsulation system that determine the 
applicability of an encapsulation technology for a specific device type 
and application scenario. Optical properties such as transmission, 
reflection, and absorption behavior and haze play a major role in the 
performance of the encapsulated device. Mechanical properties such 
as bendability, crack formation under strain or thermal expansion, 
or robustness against scratches and punctual loads determine the 
stability of the system not only in processing but also in common 
application scenarios.
	
An organic electronic system or module consists of at least one or 
two barrier/encapsulation films, transparent and metal electrodes, 
adhesives and sealants, and the active device layers themselves. 
Looking at the interactions between these constituents, rather than 
the properties of each part alone, is a key to success for preparing long 
living flexible organic devices that enable new design opportunities 
and application scenarios for the field of organic electronics.

with 366 days).

Correct calculation of the WVTR in exercise (b) is based on Fick’s 
second law (see Section 10.3.3) and may be solved with a numeric 
calculation model, e.g., in an Excel sheet. A good approximation to 
estimate the required WVTR can be just assuming zero gas flow 
during the lag time and a constant WVTR after reaching the lag time. 
This approximation, however, is good only in case the lag time is 
short compared to the measurement time (which is true for the given 
scenario here). Therefore, using the same equation from exercise (a) 
and reducing the time by 5000 h (2083 days) give an approximation

2.	 Exercise 2:
Exercise 2 is based on Fick’s first law, where the seal length 
(dseal = 5 mm) equals the diffusion length (“layer thickness”), and 
the cross-sectional area (A) is calculated by the perimeter length of 
the rectangular device multiplied by the thickness of the adhesive. 
The perimeter length is given by u = (0.2 m + 0.4 m) ¥ 2 = 1.2 m. 
The normalized WVTR of the adhesives (2 g/(m²d) at dref = 100 µm 
thickness) must be converted by using Fick’s first law to dseal = 5 
mm (seal length). The amount of water penetrating the edge seal is, 
therefore, calculated by the following equation:

Although many electronic functionalities can be realized by printed 
or organic electronics, short-term marketable products often require 
robust, reproducible, and nondisturbing technologies. In this chapter 
we show how hybrid electronics, a combination of printed circuitry, 
thin-film electronics, and classical silicon-based electronics, may 
give rise to new ways of realizing electronic products. 
11.1 Introduction
Today, companies, both small and large, have become increasingly 
interested in printed electronics, often drawn by the promise of 
cheap manufacturing technologies and hence cheap products. They 
expect the technology to deliver at least the same quality at lower 
cost with improved functionality. Interviews conducted within

Hybrid Integration of OPE
the framework of the COLAE project (FP7-ICT-2011-7, grant no. 
288881, www.colae.eu) indicated that the typical application areas 
companies are interested in are lighting (organic light-emitting 
diode [OLED] lighting), packaging (sensors and lighting elements in 
labels for product and medical packaging), energy harvesting, and 
heating elements. This is very much in line with the type of projects 
that are run at research institutes and the customer requests we 
encounter. The main driver for companies to consider printed 
electronics in these application areas is foremost cost reduction, 
improved reliability, added functionality, and an improved form 
factor. In addition, they are looking for a technology that allows them 
to do something that could not be done before, thereby giving them 
a competitive edge. 
	
The current research on flexible electronics focuses mainly on 
components (OLEDs, organic photovoltaics [OPVs], displays, for 
instance) rather than providing a complete solution. Such research 
is predominantly driven by combinations of academic groups such 
as universities, start-ups, and research institutes, as well as large-
scale enterprises. 
	
From an application point of view flexible electronics is a 
promising enabling technology to small and medium enterprises 
(SMEs) by simply improving upon existing products. A major 
challenge, however, for SME companies is their requirement of 
short-term integration of new technologies, typically within a year. 
This means that to succeed, sets of technologies are required that 
are relatively mature and reliable and can be introduced without 
disturbing the overall manufacturing methods and supply chain. At 
the same time they should bare the general advantages of printed 
electronics, namely low cost, simple manufacturing, thinness, light 
weight, etc. 
	
Hybrid electronics, a mixture of state-of-the-art printed and thin-
film electronics, combined with classic electronics, may offer this. 
The manufacturing can mostly be done on existing infrastructure and 
simultaneously it offers exciting possibilities for new and improved 
products. This chapter will explore the most common technologies 
used today to achieve functional products and prototypes based 
on hybrid printed electronics (HPE). This includes the printing of 
circuitry, the assembly of components, and some typical finishing 
techniques, where meaningful technologies  that are less common, or 

455
Basic Technologies
more disruptive, in the manufacturing world will be discussed. This 
will be followed by a case study and a discussion of the design rules 
and the challenges that industry may face adopting this technology. 
11.2 Basic Technologies
11.2.1 Basic Process Flow
At a high level, the basic process flow for HPE consists of three 
important groups of processes, as depicted in Fig. 11.1. After 
preparation of the substrates, the manufacturing typically starts with 
printing electronic circuitry on a flexible substrate. This is followed 
by the assembly of passive and active components, and finally the 
product is finished, for instance, encapsulated or packaged.

This process flow is very generic. It is based on a number of 
manufacturing technologies that have been available for several 
years and are mature. What is new is the combination of printing 
circuitry and classical components in combination with the fact that 
all processes have to be performed at relatively low temperatures. 
For instance, conventional soldering is typically not compatible 
with low temperatures. Other challenges lie in the reliability of the 
systems and in some cases the application of the processes in a roll-
to-roll process flow. The remainder of this section will describe the 
most important processes in more detail.
	
Figure 11.2 shows the generic process flow in more detail. As can 
be seen, the number of process steps is significant, and a number 
of them may have to be repeated in order to obtain a product with 
the required functionality. The blocks under the processes show

11.3 Printing Circuitry
The manufacturing of membrane switches and touch panels for 
graphical user interfaces is probably the most mature industry using 
printing electronic circuitry as its base technology. Circuitry and 
basic sensors such as capacitive touch sensors are routinely printed. 
The most important difference, with respect to HPE, is the typical 
line width (>250 µm in industry vs. <100 µm for HPE). This is mainly 
due to the fact that the (semi-)products made by printing today 
do not, or hardly, require any component integration. From a cost 
point of view, printed circuitry is in fact most interesting for exactly 
those products that require large areas and a limited number of 
components (for a more detailed discussion on this topic see Section 
11.6.2). Screen printing is probably the most important and widely 
used technique to manufacture printed circuitry. Alternatively, 
inkjet printing is a very versatile technology, especially if small 
single-layered batches are required, for instance, for prototyping. 
Gravure and flexographic printing are also used, especially for very-
high-throughput single-layered applications that do not require 
high conductivity, for instance, ultrahigh-frequency radio-frequency 
identification (UHF RFID) antennas. 

457
Printing Circuitry
11.3.1 Screen Printing
As stated above, screen printing is probably the most widely used 
technique to manufacture printed circuitry in industry. It is a 
versatile and the foremost cheap technique that allows for the 
deposition of relatively thick layers, depending on the type of ink 
between 1 µm and 15 µm per print step. The types of inks that can 
be applied are rather broad as long as the viscosity is not too low 
(100–80,000 mPa◊s). 
	
Multilayered printing is very common. In the case of printed 
circuitry, this typically involves the printing of conductive and 
isolating materials. A stack containing five or more conductive 
layers can be realized relatively easily, provided the overlay 
accuracy is high. A 10 µm overlay accuracy can be achieved in a 
research environment using optimal screens and substrates. In a 
manufacturing environment an overlay of 30 µm is more realistic. 
Features as small as 40 µm have been obtained by using a carefully 
tweaked process with specific surface treatments, inks, and screens [3]. 
	
Screen printing can be applied in two ways. Flatbed (sheet-
to-sheet) printing is typically used for relatively small batches in 
a semi-automatic way. Up to 3000 sheets per hour can be printed 
this way (Fig. 11.3). Alternatively, screen printing may be applied 
in a roll-to-roll fashion (Fig. 11.4). Instead of a flat screen, a rotary 
screen is used. Such a setup runs at a speed of at least 4 m/min, the 
maximum speed being dependent on the capacity of the drying and 
sintering equipment. Speeds up to 100 m/min have been reported in 
industrial environments.

Holst Centre.

circuits at the Holst Centre. The line consists of a rotary screen-printing unit on 
the left and inkjet-printing units are located on the right. The photonic curing 
unit is located in the middle.
11.3.2 Inkjet Printing and Flexogravure Printing
Inkjet printing is another important technology for manufacturing 
electronic circuitry on cheap foil substrates. The results of this 
method are very similar to circuitry made with flexogravure printing. 
In both cases inks with nanoparticles are used and the resulting 
metal lines have similar conductivity and thickness. Depending on 
the ink and the substrate, a line thickness up to 1 µm can be reached. 
Line widths down to 20 µm and even smaller have been shown. 
The advantage of inkjet printing is that it is a digital method, which 
makes it very useful for prototyping and small batches. Applications 
that require thin and very smooth conductive structures may benefit 
from either inkjet or flexogravure printing. The latter technology 
does require some tooling (the gravure roll) but can be run at very 
high speeds and seems therefore mostly useful for very large area 
applications, for example, the manufacturing of bus bars in OLEDs 
and photovoltaic devices and also the circuitry and antenna for 
RFID tags. Multilayered printing with these techniques may be 
problematic because the structures that are deposited are typically 

459
Printing Circuitry
pure silver and good adhesion of these structures on substrates and 
adhesion of subsequent layers on the metal surface are not evident.
	
In the past, inkjet printing has been investigated intensively 
for use in the manufacturing of integrated circuits (ICs), thin-film 
transistors, etc. The focus has, however, recently shifted more toward 
thin-film technologies in combination with large-area coating (slot-
die coating) for the manufacturing of display backplanes and simple 
IC applications such as RFID chips, the main motivation being 
that printing organic semiconductors with sufficient reliability, 
yield, and stability to realize complex circuits were found to be 
challenging. Instead, state-of-the-art display technologies such 
as photolithography and oxide semiconductors using a mix of 
conventional fabrication methods are used [5]. Ultimately such 
technology, while promising lower costs, will be challenging to 
upscale on a short term and will require, contrary to HPE, large 
investments costs.
11.3.3 Substrates
The most important advantage of using print technology, apart from 
it being an additive technology, is the fact that it is very compatible 
with cheap substrates. The most important requirement for the 
substrate is that it is dimensionally stable under thermal cycling, 
mechanical stress, and changes in environmental conditions. The 
success of multilayered printing and the various assembly steps rely 
strongly on the overlay precision of the layers. Therefore mechanical 
relaxations (e.g., irreversible shrinkage) after the substrate’s 
exposure to elevated temperatures should be minimized. It was 
found that polyesters are particularly suited as substrates because 
they combine a relatively high glass transition temperature (Tg) 
and can be heat-stabilized, minimizing mechanical relaxations. In 
addition the material is optically transparent, which is useful for 
numerous applications. Polyesters are medium priced: much cheaper 
than the workhorse in flexible circuit boards (flexible printed circuit 
[FPC]), polyimide, although they are more expensive than polyolefin 
foils. The latter materials are too mechanically unstable to serve as 
useful substrates for precise printing. In the case of HPE an overlay 
accuracy of about 50 µm is sufficient for most applications. Note that 
for thin-film electronics, and especially thin-film transistors (TFTs), 

460
Hybrid Integration of OPE
manufacturing with overlay accuracies on the order of a few microns 
is required. Still heat-stabilized polyethylene naphthalene (PEN) 
foils have been demonstrated to be well-suited substrates for such 
applications if process temperatures are kept below 150°C. 
	
Figure 11.5 shows a diagram with the temperature behavior of 
heat-stabilized PEN. As expected for a semicrystalline material, the 
deformation is strongly dependent on the direction in which the foil 
was stretched during manufacturing. It also shows that even in a 
heat-stabilized product, the shrinkage can be significant.
Figure 11.5 Polar plot of shrinkage behavior of PEN taken after annealing for 
10 min at 200°C.
	
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a cheaper alternative to 
PEN, has a similar behavior and is more commonly used as a low-
cost substrate. Other substrates, such as polyimide or polyether 
etherketone (PEEK) are occasionally used as well, especially for 
high-end applications where high temperatures (>350°C) are 
needed and a low thermal coefficient of expansion, for instance, 
in combinations with traditional thin-film technologies. The use of 
paper as a substrate for HPE has also been quite successful since it 
is one of the most common substrates used for (graphic) printing, 
facilitating the adaptation by the industry, especially print houses 
(Fig. 11.6). 
11.3.4 Inks
In most cases silver inks are used to manufacture printed circuitry. It 
is the industry standard since the early onset of printing conductive 
materials. Silver is relatively noble and therefore stable inks can 
be obtained using a dispersion of small metal particles. Because 

461
of the increasing price for bulk silver, quite some research effort 
is ongoing for developing cheaper alternatives, some of which are 
emerging in industry. Examples of such inks include dispersions 
with silver-coated copper particles, Cu particles, Ni particles, and 
metal complexes. 
Figure 11.6 Paper substrate with rotary screen-printed Ag ink, cured with 
photonic curing (http://www.ropas-project.eu/).
	
Silver nanoparticle inks are available for a wide range of 
printing techniques, including screen printing, inkjet printing, and 
flexographic printing. The inks have, after curing, a high specific 
conductivity (up to 20% of bulk silver). After curing the printed 
structures consists of almost pure metal, which may give issues 
with reliability. For instance, adhesion to the substrate or overlaying 
layers may be problematic. Also the remaining layers are relatively 
thin, typically on the order of 1 µm.
	
Micron size–particle inks on the other hand still contain a 
substantial amount of binder. The absolute conductivity is therefore 
lower, up to 10% of bulk silver, but the adhesion to the substrate and 
overlaying layers is much better. The layer thickness is typically 5 to 
10 µm and is strongly dependent on the ink and process settings. 
	
One of the strong points of printing a circuitry is the ability to 
incorporate functional components in the circuit in the same process. 
Examples of such components include resistors (using carbon 
Printing Circuitry

462
Hybrid Integration of OPE
inks) (Fig. 11.7), capacitors (combination of metal and dielectrics), 
capacitive sliders, and resistive sensors (using chemically sensitive 
conductive inks). 
Figure 11.7 Printed Ag ink circuit in combination with carbon-based resistors.
11.3.5 Curing and Sintering
To render metal inks conductive, thermal treatment is required. 
Although the method and especially the equipment are uniform, 
two distinct processes are applied for this. Nanoparticle inks are 
sintered, fusing the particles to form a continuous metal phase. For 
bulk silver a temperature above the melting temperature is needed, 
which is not compatible with the foil substrates used for HPE. For 
nanoparticles, however, the high surface-to-volume ratio allows for 
a considerable lower temperature to be used. Typically the sintering 
temperature is around 130°C for about 15 min. 
	
Micron-size particles are already too big for this short cut. Inks 
that contain these larger particles are therefore cured, and the solvent 
and the binder are partly removed under elevated temperature, 
yielding a matrix of cured binder where the metal particles are in 
contact with each other but not sintered. This explains the improved 
adhesion to the substrate as well as the lower conductivity. 

463
	
Although curing and sintering with elevated temperatures 
are still the most common way, photonic curing and sintering are 
becoming more widely available. Because this process is extremely 
fast (seconds rather than minutes), it is especially useful for roll-to-
roll processes. Photonic sintering makes use of the fact that (visible) 
light is absorbed by the noncured ink but not by the substrate. This 
allows to selectively heat up the ink to temperatures that exceed the 
processing temperature ceiling of the substrate. Figure 11.8 shows 
the temperature and resistance profile of a conductive ink during 
a flash sequence. Also it shows how the cross section of the line 
changes during the process. During the first second the solvent is 
evaporated; after 1.5 s, the silver particles are aggregated or fused 
together, dramatically increasing the electrical conductivity of the 
printed structure. The sintering is complete after 2.5 s. In the case of 
nanoparticle inks, the particles would be fused together (sintering), 
while micron-size-particle inks, rather, aggregate. 
Figure 11.8 Temperature and resistance profile of a printed silver ink during a 
photonic flash sequence. The bottom shows a schematic representation of the 
line cross section.
11.3.6 Alternatives to Direct Printing
Although the printing circuitry using silver inks conductive is very 
attractive and certainly useful for products that require large-area 
substrates with little functional components, functionalities that 
require fine features (<50 µ) or alternative metals (Cu, Ni, Au) 
Printing Circuitry

464
Hybrid Integration of OPE
are probably better made with alternative deposition techniques. 
For instance, fine interdigitated electrodes for resistive sensors 
or transistors can be obtained from classical thin-film deposition 
techniques such as sputtering in combination with photolithography 
and etching. Alternatively processes based on printing a seed layer 
followed by electrodeless plating have also been employed. 
11.4 Assembly
Assembly is a combination of processes that lead to the 
interconnection of electronic components on a printed circuit. In 
the overall process flow for HPE, it is the next set of technologies 
needed to achieve a functional hybrid printed system. Assembly 
aims to bond passive and active components to the printed circuit in 
a reliable and robust way (Fig. 11.9). 
Figure 11.9 Assembled 0402 size resistors using an isotropic conductive 
adhesive.
	
Classically, components are soldered to printed circuit boards 
(PCBs) and FPCs. The typical process steps are stencil printing of the 
solder paste, picking and placing of the components, and reflowing 
of the solder, providing a metallic joint. The processes have been 
optimized such that today high reliability and speed can be combined 
with very high yields. 

465
	
The low-cost substrates that are normally used for HPE will not 
maintain their mechanical stability during a solder reflow step as 
a result of the high temperatures required to melt a typical solder 
eutectic such as SnAgCu. Therefore, electrically conductive adhesives 
are used to adhere the components to the circuit, providing both 
electrical and mechanical interconnection. These adhesives can be 
cured at relatively low temperatures, typically <130°C, making them 
particularly suited for HPE. Today many interesting developments 
are going on in the field of adhesives, but also progress is made in 
developing low-temperature-reflowing solders such as SnBi. This 
chapter, however, will focus on conductive adhesive systems. For 
conductive interconnection two types of adhesives are available, 
isotropic conductive adhesives (ICAs) and anisotropic conductive 
adhesives (ACAs). Additional mechanical stability is often realized 
using a nonconductive adhesive (NCA), also known as underfill or 
glob top, which is much cheaper and better suited for its purpose. 
The adhesives can be applied in different ways, depending on the 
type of adhesive but also the substrate and the size of the required 
dots. 
11.4.1 Isotropic Conductive Adhesive
As the name indicates, an ICA conducts, after curing, in all 
directions. Compositionally it is very similar to screen-printing 
pastes containing a high percentage of relatively big silver particles 
in a polymer matrix. Because of this, it must be applied with high 
precision to avoid shorting.
	
The material is usually applied by means of stencil- or large-mesh 
screen printing, similar to how solder paste is generally applied. 
This can be done with a screen printer that has sufficient overlay 
accuracy. It allows to deposit spots of the ICA down to at least 0.1 × 0.2 
mm, the single-contact-pad footprint of the smallest commercially 
available component to date, a 01005 passive component. Recently 
we demonstrated that this technique could be used to interconnect 
bare light-emitting diode (LED) chips with contact pads of 80 µm. 
Another method to achieve small spots is pin transfer, where a small 
dot of adhesive is applied to the substrate by picking it up with a 
pin, as the name of the technique suggests. This method allows for 
Assembly

466
Hybrid Integration of OPE
a minimum drop size of 80 µm. It should be noted that the latter 
technology is still in the development phase. 
	
Alternatively, the adhesive may be applied using a dispenser or 
by jetting. Both methods are useful for drops that exceed 250–300 
µm. Jetting is much faster than dispensing but requires much more 
expensive equipment. Furthermore, adhesives need to be optimized 
for these processes to avoid clogging of the jetting nozzles. 
	
For fine pitch jetting, laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) is 
an interesting option. Using this technique, spot sizes down to 75 
µm could be realized. With this latter technology fine pitch flip-chip 
applications with ICAs come into the range of possibilities next to the 
assembly of suface mount technology (SMT) discrete components. 
	
In general ICA materials cure at temperatures ranging from 70°C 
to well above 160°C in regular ovens for a few minutes to hours. This 
implies that bonding and curing are separate processes and have 
a certain impact on the applications, for example, special handling 
of preassembled products or very accurate component topology 
needed.
11.4.2 Anisotropic Conductive Adhesives
Contrary to ICAs, ACAs have the ability to conduct in only the vertical 
direction. An ACA allows for electrical interconnections between 
components and the substrates where the contact pads are very 
close together, beyond the patterning ability. Anisotropic conducting 
materials are widely used in the bonding of flex cables (e.g., displays). 
The materials are also applied for components that require small 
pitches, for instance, bare dies, especially more complex ones such as 
microcontrollers or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) 
that require landing pads with a pitch of <40 µm. This process, where 
the chip is bonded upside down to the substrate, is often referred to 
as flip-chip die bonding, instead of face up as is the case in a classic 
wire-bonded chip package.
	
With current state-of-the-art industrial screen printing, stencil 
printing, and dispensing technologies of ICAs, the spot sizes and 
gaps that are required are not easily achieved. ACAs, however, are 
perfectly suited since the application of the adhesive does not have 
to be that precise and the overlay of the pick-and-place machine 
determines the alignment accuracy, not the adhesive. 

467
	
ACAs are adhesives with a very low particle fill factor (~10%). 
The particles that give conductivity are mostly metal (Au)-coated 
polymer spheres or micron-size Ag particles. When trapped 
between the bump on the chip and the landing pad, one or a few of 
these particles will provide the electrical interconnect (z direction). 
There are, however, too little particles in the adhesive to also form a 
conductive path along the substrate (xy direction), as shown in Fig. 
11.10.
Figure 11.10 Schematic representation of how an ICA (top) and an ACA work.
	
The material can be obtained in two forms, as a liquid or as a 
tape-like film (anisotropic conductive film [ACF]). In liquid form it 
can be applied using the techniques discussed for ICAs; the film is 
typically transferred but requires prebonding at low temperature. 
	
Different from ICAs, ACAs and ACFs need to be cured under 
pressure to keep the conductive particles under tension to form the 
conductive path. This has an impact on the processing equipment, 
making it more complex and expensive. Curing temperature is 
commonly above 150°C; however, bonding time ranges from a few 
milliseconds to minutes. 
11.4.3 Pick and Place 
After application of the adhesive, the components are placed on 
the substrate. This has to occur with good accuracy in order to 
ensure proper functionality. Standard pick-and-place machines 
Assembly

468
Hybrid Integration of OPE
can be used for this process. These machines are mostly equipped 
for nonflexible substrates, so foil-based substrates are normally 
laminated to temporary carriers. This is a common technique that 
is applied widely in the field of flexible electronics. The state-of-
the-art equipment allows to assemble the smallest SMT or bare die 
(e.g., LEDs, RFID chips) components at very high throughputs, up to 
15,000 units per hour (uph).
	
For flip chip of microprocessors generally throughput can go up to 
1500 uph. Recently interest is growing in pick-and-place equipment 
and processes for roll-to-roll production. Some equipment is 
available, especially for RFID inlay and LED strip manufacturing. The 
process is characterized by the use of a limited number of simple 
components with a limited amount of bonding pads (typically 2 or 3) 
and the lack of high precision. In general, most machines have a web 
width limited to 10 cm, although machines capable of handling wider 
webs have been demonstrated. It should be noted that current web 
solutions are predominantly stop and go rather than continuous. 
11.4.4 Assembly of Components in Systems
The use of a combination of the above-mentioned techniques allows 
for the manufacturing of very thin and very flexible but highly complex 
systems. Figure 11.11 shows a picture of a hybrid printed system. It 
consists of a multilayered print on PEN: two conductive layers with 
bare thinned dies, a microcontroller, and a near-field communication 
(NFC) radio, assembled using an ACA. The components (01005) are 
interconnected using an ICA. Because the ICA does not give enough 
mechanical stability a so-called underfill material is used to provide 
the necessary bonding power. This material is typically dispensed 
or jetted. Figure 11.12 below shows a transparent glob-top material 
that is used to protect the chips from shear forces. 
11.4.5 Foil-to-Foil Lamination
A process typical for HPE is foil-to-foil lamination. It mostly is 
concerned with the integration of two functional foils that have been 
manufactured using different technologies. An example of such a 
system is shown in Fig. 11.13. Here a small foil with lithographically 
made sensors (ultrasmall lines and gap) is connected to a circuit. 

469
Despite the large line width and pitch of the connectors an ACF is 
used to create the interconnection. The main reason for this is that 
the ACF can also provide the mechanical interconnection. If an ICA 
was used, both the ICA and an NCA would have to be applied in a 
patterned way. This is rather difficult and not an easy strategy and 
therefore an ACF is the method of choice.

With the large pitches, as exemplified by Fig. 11.13, overlay 
alignment is not the main issue. There are examples, however, where 
much higher accuracies are required and an alternative approach 
has been recently shown. By combining fluidic self-assembly with 
laser-defined trenches, capillary forces could be used to accurately 
place foils within a range of a few micrometers.

circuitry foil.
11.4.6 Reliability
The challenge in the assembly of HPE systems is the variety in 
components and chips in combination with nonstandard substrates 
and adhesives. The reliability of these systems, especially the 
assembly of components, should be as good, if not better than 
existing technologies, mainly solder joints if products are to be 
accepted in the market. For many applications, where reliability is 
less an issue, the requirements can be met most of the time. Typical 
methods to validate the reliability are tests for the electrical behavior 
under elevated temperature/humidity, temperature shock, flexing, 
and shear forces. These tests are very comparable to those used for 
classical electronics, and specifications are similar as well. 
	
The most common failure modes that are encountered include 
the delamination of the inks, both from the substrate as from the 
interfaces in multilayered systems. Another important failure mode 
is the release of components from the substrate and circuitry.

(top) and 0402 (bottom) components on a printed Ag circuit. The 
substrates were bent 1000 times over a rod ranging from 25 to 5 mm 
in diameter. The substrate, ink, and ICA were the same in all cases.

Assembly

Hybrid Integration of OPE
As expected, the reliability is not only dependent on the inks and 
other materials that are used but also on the size of the components 
used. The initial resistance of the 01005 components is slightly 
higher because the pad size of these components is significantly 
smaller than for 0402 components. By bending over 10 mm the 
0402 components start to fail, whereas the 01005 components only 
show a small insignificant increase in resistance, even when bent 
over a rod of 5 mm. The components actually act as rigid islands on 
the flexible substrate and the size of these islands determines the 
minimum bending radius. 
	
Figure 11.15 shows pictures of substrates after a shear test. It can 
be clearly seen that the failure mode can differ significantly. On the 
left side, Ag printed on PEN, the assembly failed on the ink substrate 
interface. On the right side, failure through the adhesive interface is 
shown. Depending on the inks and adhesives used, failure can occur 
at any interface. 
Figure 11.15 Results of a shear test showing two possible failure modes. Left: 
Delamination of the silver track from the PEN substrate. Right: Delamination of 
the component from the adhesive.
	
Optimizing the materials and processes to improve upon the 
reliability of HPE systems is key in getting the technology to the 
market. As discussed previously, important improvements can also 
be obtained by making use of well-known solutions such as glob-top 
coatings, underfill adhesive materials, and proper packaging of the 
assembly. 
	
The thickness of bare dies also reduces the sensitivity for shear. If 
chips are thinned and treated for stress relief, they may become very 
flexible and bending multiple times over a radius of 10 mm is very 
feasible. Mechanical and electrical properties of ultrathin chips and 

473
flexible electronics assemblies during bending have been previously 
demonstrated. 
11.5 Finishing
The finishing for HPE encompasses basically all steps that are taken 
after assembly of electronic components. This includes packaging, 
making of the desired shapes, and the assembly into the final product. 
	
For the packaging and protection of the electronic system, 
a number of techniques have been shown. Lamination with 
thermoplastic materials such as thermoplastic polyurethanes 
(TPUs) (Fig. 11.16) gives thin flexible systems that can easily be 
further processed in final products. The encapsulation provides 
both mechanical stability and adequate protection against moisture 
and handling. Using vacuum lamination, lamination of wearable 
electronics, silicones are common encapsulating materials. They are 
hydrophobic and very flexible, making them suited for wearables. 
Mechanically silicones are somewhat less stable as they tend to 
rupture upon repetitive strain. Silicones are typically casted or 
molded, which is compatible with HPE as long as the temperature is 
kept below approximately 130°C.

thermoplastic polyurethane.
Finishing

474
Hybrid Integration of OPE
	
Finishing also includes the processes that shape the product. In 
the industry, die cutting is the method of choice for small products at 
a large scale. Laser cutting is often used for large products because 
of the scalability and thus price of the tooling required for die 
cutting. Laser cutting is also more frequently used for small batch 
manufacturing as it relies on a digital method, making it easy to 
adjust the patterns. In most cases a CO2 laser is used for cutting as 
this is the cheapest type of laser. It works well for many substrates; 
however, it is not compatible with all materials, for instance, 
polyimides, leaving large heat-affected zones. A laser can be mounted 
on an xy stage, determining the accuracy of the system. For high-end 
applications, solid-state lasers have become more prevalent. While 
solid-state lasers, such as Nd:YAG are generally more expensive, they 
allow for better control of the energy dosage and line width and they 
are therefore very suitable for sensitive materials and fine features. 
When such a laser is combined with a galvano-scanning system, the 
speed and accuracy of the system can be very high. Recently fiber 
lasers have begun to replace both CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers due to their 
improved performance, lower cost of ownership, and reliability. 
11.6 Applying the Technology: A Case Study
11.6.1 Flexsmell Label
Labels with electronic functionalities present one of the most sought 
after applications for HPE. Typically, these labels are required 
have some sort of RFID functionality in combination with sensing 
functionality.
	
Classically, the antennas on the most simple and cheap RFID 
labels are not printed. They are made either by die cut or by etching 
metal foils. For more advanced labels, often using UHF frequencies, 
printing, especially R2R inkjet or flexo-gravure is frequently used. 
The chips that have to be placed are very simple and small and have 
typically two bond pads. The required pick-and-place accuracy is 
therefore relatively small, and since only one conductive layer is 
used, overlay accuracy is not an issue. These labels are made high 
speed.

475
	
More elaborated labels, having electronic functionalities, such 
as sensors, monitoring capabilities, and lighting elements, are much 
more complex to fabricate. Within the framework of the European 
project Flexsmell (FP7 Marie-Curie Initial Training Network [ITN], 
grant no. 238454) strategies were set out to develop a smart olfactic 
label that combines most the technologies that have been discussed 
in this chapter.
	
Figure 11.17 shows the finished label in closed and open form. 
The label is required to communicate with the outside world over 
an NFC protocol. The tag is designed to contain the necessary 
hardware (chips) enabling the read-out of capacitive and resistive 
sensors possible. Finally, the sensor label should be able to work 
in monitoring mode, that is, it should have sufficient memory and 
battery power for autonomous functioning. 
Figure 11.17 Flexsmell label with assembled components.
	
Screen printing was used as the basic printing technology 
because of the required resistance of the antenna (suited for 
communication at 13.56 MHz, so primarily inductive coupling). 
The required functionality made that a number of chips had to be 
integrated, and with these chips, numerous passive components 
were necessary as well. The most important active components are 
an EEprom/NFC chip, a capacitive front end, and a microcontroller. 
A detailed description of the manufacturing of the foil-based sensor 
chip can be found in Ref. [8].

11.6.2 Total Cost of Ownership
Because the above-described label is a good example of a typical HPE 
product, the total cost of ownership of the product was calculated as 
part of a feasibility study within the framework of the COLAE project. 
This calculation not only gives a good impression of the total cost of 
manufacturing but also provides valuable information on the cost 
buildup and shows where important improvements can be made, for 
example, what the expensive process steps are or where it may be 
helpful to look at the used equipment or components. 
	
The model that is used for the calculations is based on the 
process flow. For every process step, we calculate the fixed cost, the 
operational cost, and the cost of the materials and components used 
(Fig. 11.18). The database currently comprises over 150 different 
kinds of equipment and more than 250 processes, most of which 
are dedicated for hybrid electronics products and semiproducts. 
The process and equipment descriptions are as close as possible 
to existing processes and equipment in industry. If a process or 
equipment is not available, the description is based on research 
facilities, for instance, in a combination of common design rules in 
mechanical and systems engineering.

Figure 11.18 Schematic representation of the model used to calculate the 
total cost of ownership for hybrid printed electronic (semi-)products.
	
For the Flexsmell label we used the system design as described 
above. The bill of materials was determined on the basis of the used 

477
components and materials using prices for a batch size of 100,000 
good produced units (gpu). The size of the label is 70 × 70 mm in 
open form. It will be folded in the final stage of the product (see Fig. 
11.17). 
	
The process flow used for this case is very similar to the generic 
process flow, depicted in Fig. 11.2. Because of the amount of prod­
ucts, the total foil area is only 490 m2, and sheet-to-sheet process­
ing is chosen. Although sheet-to-sheet processing is much slower 
than roll to roll, the equipment and tooling cost are much higher for 
the latter and the current batch size is not large enough. Also, pick-
and-place equipment suited for such complex systems is not readily 
available. This makes that sheet to sheet is a much more likely strat­
egy to be used for this application. 
	
The process flow starts with four printing steps, followed 
by assembly. The sensor is placed by foil-to-foil lamination and 
assembly. For the sensor foil we used the flow described in Molina-
Lopez et al. (2013). 
	
The total cost of ownership for the label, including the sensor 
foil, is about €6.50 per gpu. Figure 11.19 shows the results of the 
calculations in euros per cost item. As typical for HPE, the price 
is mainly determined by the cost of the consumables, in this case 
the battery (approx. €2.00) and components (approx. €3.50). That 
leaves only one euro for the sensor and the foil. The cost of labor is 
relatively high because of some manual steps that are assumed in 
the process flow.

The findings of this study are representative of many HPE 
products. First of all, roll-to-roll manufacturing of printed circuitry 
only makes sense if the application demands large-area substrates; 
in all other cases sheet-to-sheet production, also found most 
frequently in industry, is preferable. It should be noted that there 
may be applications that require to be roll-manufactured for ease 
or cost further in the manufacturing chain. The use of printed 
substrates as such makes sense if the area is relatively large and 
the number of components is low. In the above example a double-
layered FPC would add approximately one euro to estimated costs 
(based on FPC prices given in the iNEMI roadmap 2013, www.
inemi.org), which is significant. Therefore printing does make sense 
for this label. In most cases the components, especially the active 
components, represent the bulk of the total cost. Making the product 
cheaper means reducing the functionality of the product. 
11.7 Examples and Challenges of Realized 
Product Prototypes
This chapter started with stating that the areas of interest for 
printed and large-area electronics were in lighting (OLEDs), energy 
(solar, harvesting, and heating), packaging, and health care. HPE has 
been applied in most of these application areas. For instance, LEDs 

479
assembled on foils have been shown that may be used to produce 
freeform lighting objects. This can even be done with bare die LEDs, 
LEDs without packaging, to obtain truly flat, flexible lighting surfaces.
	
There are ample examples of the applicability in packaging-
related products of which the discussed Flexsmell label is a typical 
example. Electronic solutions are often too expensive for fast-moving 
consumer goods where a label is allowed to cost cents instead of 
euros. Currently the trend is going into active packaging for high-
end products and marketing samples using heating and lighting 
components.
	
With the ongoing wearable electronics boom, a lot of interest 
is directed toward the application of HPE in wearable devices. At 
the Holst Centre, particular attention is given to disposable health 
patches such as those shown in Fig. 11.16. The challenge here is 
to obtain thin and flexible devices that are cheap to manufacture 
and unobtrusive when worn by the customer or patient. The 
unobtrusiveness requires stretchable and conformable electronics 
in combination with low cost and the use of environmentally friendly 
materials. An alternative approach is to embed the electronics in 
garments. In this use case, aspects such as wearability, reliability 
under use, and especially reliability in the washing machine are of 
prime interest.
11.8 Conclusions
In this chapter we have described the state-of-the-art technologies 
that are available for the manufacturing of HPE. Discussions 
with potential customers and companies indicated that most are 
very interested in printed electronics as long as it solves their 
immediate problem and the technology is not disruptive in existing 
manufacturing strategies. With HPE, these needs are served in 
an important way because it delivers the advantage of printed 
electronics combined with the reliability of classic electronics.
	
After a description of the typical process flow for HPE, including 
printing, assembly, and finishing, we describe the techniques used 
for the printing of metal, mostly silver tracks, for printed circuits. 
For reasons such as conductivity, process speed and throughput, 
reliability, and the availability in industry, screen printing is often

the method of choice. For specific applications that require very thin 
and flat lines and where high conductivity is of lesser importance, 
inkjet printing may be a good alternative. Flexographic and gravure 
printing creates similar features at much higher throughput. 
Examples include gridlines for OPV and UHF RFID antennas. For 
application in backplanes and integrated circuits, (inkjet) printed 
structures cannot provide the required performance yet.
	
The second step involves a set of processes that aims to 
interconnect classic electronic components, both passive and active, 
electrically to the printed circuit. We discuss the most important 
types of adhesives that can be used for this process and show how 
they can be used to assemble passive components down to 01005 
size and bare die chips that are thinned to 20 µm. We discuss 
strategies to apply the adhesives in the small footprints needed 
for these components. Also small functional foils that have been 
fabricated with nonprinting thin-film technologies can be elegantly 
integrated using conductive adhesives. The reliability of these 
processes and the resulting semiproducts are currently the biggest 
hurdle to get the technology widely accepted in industry, although 
important improvements have been made in recent years.
	
The last steps in the process flow deal with the finishing of 
the semiproducts. Laminating, encapsulating, and also giving the 
product is final form factor belong to this group. Most of these 
technologies are readily available in industry. 
	
The technologies described in this chapter can be used in a wide 
range of applications. The example given here deals with an olfactic 
label that was developed in the framework of a European project 
(Flexsmell). The label is a perfect example of HPE. It uses a printed 
circuit that is indeed more cost effective than an FPC of similar 
size and functionality. To obtain the required functionality many 
expensive components had to be placed. By means of a total-cost-
of-ownership study we have shown the needed components actually 
make up the bulk of the cost. From experience we know that this 
is true for most of the products and demonstrators, which is being 
worked on today.
	
The technology needed for the successful introduction of HPE in 
the market is at a sufficient level. The reliability of, especially, the 
assembly still needs attention and the technology is mature enough 
to serve the first applications. Some companies are taking important 

481
steps today and the first products are expected in the near future. 
At the same time, HPE opens up application areas that have been 
difficult to address with classical electronic technologies. Unique 
properties that yield very thin, very flexible, and even stretchable 
assemblies make this possible. The application areas include, but 
are not limited to, the domain of wearable, unobtrusive, high-quality 
electronic devices.
Exercises
As an exercise and to get acquainted with HPE, it might help to make 
a conceptual design of the product in mind and try to analyze the 
technologies needed to meet the specifications. What is possible 
with the current state of the art, and where does one have to resort to 
classical components? Try to make choices not only on technological 
matureness but also on the cost involved. 
	
1.	 The Flexsmell label (50 × 70 mm) discussed in the text 
contains a printed NFC antenna, which is probably the most 
challenging electronic feature that has to be printed. Especially

technology would be preferred to manufacture the label. 
	
a.	 Calculate the resistance per centimeter of a line printed 
with a width of 1 mm using inkjet printing with a typical

12.1 Introduction
Smart textiles are fabrics having technologies that sense and react to 
the conditions of the environment they are exposed to, thus allowing 
the wearer to experience increased functionality. The conditions 
or stimuli can be mechanical, thermal, chemical, or a combination 
of all. Smart textiles can be classified as passive or active. Passive 
smart textiles do not respond to the environment; in other words, 
the design of the textile does not allow it to instantly alter the 
measured condition one way or the other. For example, antistatic 
fabrics are designed in such a way that their electrostatic discharge 
properties are not influenced by the environment to which they are

exposed. Active smart textiles are those that adapt to changes in the 
environment and contain built-in actuators and sensors. In recent 
years, smart textiles have become capable of sensing, reacting, and 
adapting to the environment or stimuli. These smart materials 
can sense, for example, the temperature outside and consequently 
warm up or cool down, based on the measured temperature. Many 
smart textiles that have electronics incorporated in them are called 
e-textiles. Smart textiles can be designed to have applications 
in sportswear, temperature control, increased comfort, energy 
harvesting, lighting, in addition to other functionalities for different 
sectors, namely, automotive, aeronautics, architecture, construction, 
and general wearables. Several studies demonstrate the great impact 
of this smart textiles market, which reached $3 billion in 2021, and 
experts (e.g., IMARC group) expect it to reach $13.6 billion by 2027, 
demonstrating the great impact and focus on this area.
	
Within this scope, the development of smart textiles that 
focus on the application of smart materials (e.g., functional yarns 
and inks), processes (e.g., printed electronics, advanced textile 
processes), and customized electronics exhibits an opportunity to 
strengthen this market, resulting in smart-textile-based products 
with a high added value. Therefore, based on the expertise of the 
Centre for Nanotechnology and Smart Materials (CeNTI), this 
chapter will present an overview of different smart materials for the 
development of smart-textile-based solutions, also considering their 
integration in different types of textile substrates. Moreover, it will 
explore some applications for developed materials, demonstrating 
the possibilities of combining printed electronics and functional 
yarns, supported by the technical knowledge of the textile industry, 
in the development of active smart textiles for different sectors, 
namely, construction, health and well-being, automotive, and energy.
12.2 Materials
12.2.1 Functional Inks
Printed electronics, as will be further discussed in detail, resort to 
conventional printing techniques to produce electronic devices 
and structures of different complexities. By acknowledging the 

487
Materials
characteristics and functionalities demanded by these devices, 
several types of inks are required to provide the printed patterns and 
structures the conducting, semiconducting, or dielectric properties 
of interest. Inks for specific applications can also be formulated, 
such as photovoltaic inks and phosphorous inks for light-emitting 
solutions. Generally, the structure of functional inks can be divided 
into the following components:
	
∑	 Functional particles: These particles provide the required 
functionality to the printed film. Their nature can be organic 
or inorganic and are usually of micro- or nanoscale, depending 
on the properties that must be achieved and the printing 
method that will be adopted.
	
∑	 Binder: Responsible for bonding the functional particles 
and used as their carrier to the substrate. The binder system 
is usually composed of polymer materials such as resins, 
acrylics, or others. Its properties directly affect the surface 
quality of the film, flexibility, strength, and chemical and wear 
resistance, among others.
	
∑	 Solvents: Used to adjust the viscosity of the ink and respective 
drying condition, being tuned according to the printing 
method. These materials are also used to preserve the liquid 
state of the ink.
 
∑	 Additives: Applied in low quantities to tailor specific 
properties for application needs, as the case of surfactants to 
modify the surface tension and improve printability. Additives 
can also be used to enhance the overall quality of the ink, such 
as defoamers and dispersants.
	
Given these characteristics, the ink itself can be thought of as 
a vehicle that allows the deposition of the respective functional 
materials. Nonetheless, the properties of this so-called vehicle 
have a large impact on the quality of the printed films and in the 
respective functionality. Moreover, the inks must be suited to meet 
the demands of the selected printing technique. In this scope, the 
following features must be considered when producing printable 
inks:
	
∑	 Viscosity: The viscosity of the ink refers to the resistance 
that it offers against the flow at a specific shear rate. The 
viscosity can be modified to comply with the requirements of 

488
Smart Textiles
the printing technique. Nonetheless, tuning the viscosity may 
imply changes in the electrical properties of the ink, which 
may be taken into consideration.
	
∑	 Surface tension: This parameter is of extreme relevance since 
it defines the ink droplets and directly affects the interaction 
between the ink and the substrate. This interaction further 
influences the resolution of the printed film.
	
∑	 Particle size: Generally, the intended functionality of an ink 
is improved when the particle size is decreased. However, 
this also leads to a higher occurrence of agglomerations that 
can decrease the print quality, therefore requiring the use of 
stabilizing agents. Higher viscosity inks can be achieved with 
small-size particles and a uniform size distribution, allowing 
the printing of denser patterns.
	
∑	 Solid content: This property is associated with the effective 
amount of functional particles present in the ink. An increase 
in the solid content is directly related to a decrease in viscosity 
under shear stress, allowing a smoother flow of the ink, while 
preventing an excessive spreading after printing it on the 
substrate. Therefore, the rheological properties of the ink can 
be adjusted by changing the solid content of the ink.
	
As already exemplified, it must be noted that these four properties 
are anchored to each other, which can represent a challenge in the 
production of fully functional and printable inks for each application 
and technique.
	
Furthermore, the quality of the printed film is also influenced 
by other parameters related to the interaction between the ink and 
the substrate during and after the printing process. This interaction 
can be described in three stages: (1) ink deposition on the substrate, 
(2) wetting and spreading of the ink on the substrate, and (3) 
equilibrium state of the ink with the substrate and the environment. 
Hence, this process is strongly influenced by the properties of both 
the ink and the substrate.
12.2.1.1 Conducting materials
Electronic products are usually composed of conducting parts, such 
as resistors, antennas, wiring, and others, which demonstrates 
the importance given to conductive inks in printed electronics 

489
Materials
applications. Generally, these inks are synthesized by resorting 
to dispersed metallic nanoparticles, dissolved organometallic 
compounds, and dissolved or dispersed conductive polymers. As 
a result, several types of conducting materials can be explored to 
produce conductive inks with distinct properties and tailored 
according to the requirements of each solution.
	
When producing conductive inks, metallic materials are 
frequently chosen due to their known high electrical conductivity. 
The most common metal-based inks are composed of silver, copper, 
or gold. Metallic inks can be synthesized by several processes, with 
each of them providing distinct properties. In most cases, metallic 
nanoparticles are used since their resistivity is usually only two to 
three times higher than the bulk material. Moreover, due to their 
nanometer size, these particles are easily formulated into suitable 
inks compatible with different printing methods, in addition to 
having a high surface energy state that provides an excellent 
adhesion to several substrates. Nevertheless, nanoparticles tend to 
agglomerate in the ink. This occurrence can be prevented by using 
stabilizers, which consequently require post-printing treatments 
with temperatures typically above 100°C. Other production 
approaches refer to metal–organic precursors, which benefit 
from the molecular nature of compounds to form metals at low-
temperatures and do not exhibit agglomeration and condensation 
problems. Metallic nanowires also possess distinctive properties 
that can be advantageous for conductive inks.
	
In addition to metallic inks, carbon-based conductive inks can 
also be formulated, by including carbon nanotubes or graphene. 
These materials can provide excellent properties such as good 
electrical conductivity, flexibility, and light transmittance. Organic 
materials have also been drawing attention for the production of 
conductive inks. Besides their lower electrical conductivities when 
compared to metals, organic materials possess attractive features 
that can be advantageous for specific applications, such as their 
high compatibility with organic and aqueous solvents used in ink 
formulation and the softness and flexibility provided by the printed 
films, in addition to their low cost when compared to metals. In this 
scope, the most popular conductive polymer is PEDOT:PSS, usually 
employed in solutions that require a good optical transmittance 
without demanding a high electrical performance.

Smart Textiles
12.2.1.2 Semiconducting materials
Semiconducting materials are usually used as active layers of active 
systems, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), thin-film transistors 
(TFTs), and field-effect transistors (FETs). In conventional solid-
state semiconductors, silicon plays a fundamental role, being 
an indispensable material. However, due to the processability 
characteristics of silicon, for printed electronics, it is necessary to 
replace this material with others that can, in fact, be formulated 
into printable inks or it should be modified into silicon inks with 
a low-temperature manufacturing process. In this scope, and by 
aiming for materials with improved charge mobility, organic and 
oxide semiconductors compatible with printing technologies 
have been intensively sought out. Ceramics oxides, such as zinc 
oxide (ZnO), gallium oxide (Ga2O3), and indium oxide (In2O3), are 
already explored for printed transistors; however, these types of 
semiconductors usually require high sintering temperatures, above 
400/500°C, which limit their applications.
12.2.1.3 Dielectric materials
Besides inks with conductive and semiconductive inks, dielectric 
inks also represent an important part in printed electronics 
since they can be used for structural and/or interface layers, 
functioning as insulators or encapsulation materials. Common 
applications of dielectric inks can be found on printed capacitors 
and electroluminescent devices. Consequently, dielectric inks 
must be able to form uniform layers with adequate thicknesses 
and low roughness to prevent electric leakage and guarantee an 
adequate integration in the respective multilayer structure. As an 
encapsulation layer, it can be used to protect printed films from 
external factors that otherwise could damage the respective device. 
In printed electronics, BaTiO3 is the typical dielectric powder used 
in ink formulations. Polymeric materials such as PMMA, PVA, PVP, 
and others can also be used in the composition of dielectric inks due 
to their insulator properties.
12.2.2 Membranes and Encapsulation Materials
The characteristics of printed electronics offer the capability 
of printing functional devices onto a wide range of substrates. 

491
Materials
Polymeric substrates are widely used in these applications due to 
their flexibility, surface smoothness, light weight, and low cost. In this 
group, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate 
(PEN), polyimide (PI), and polycarbonate (PC) can be considered for 
several applications depending on the desired properties, such as 
optical transparency, heat resistance, and mechanical and chemical 
properties. In addition, other types of substrates may favor specific 
applications, such as biodegradable paper substrates or textiles.
	
Over the last years, the growing interest in wearable solutions 
placed smart textiles on a spotlight. As will be discussed in the 
following topics, functional textiles can be produced by resorting 
to printing technologies. However, one of the main difficulties that 
can be encountered when printing directly on the respective fiber-
based substrates is related to their typical roughness and pilosity. 
Indeed, the resolution and quality of the printed patterns are highly 
influenced by these aspects since they can lead to the occurrence of 
nonuniformities and impact the electrical properties of the film. As 
a result, when combining printed electronics with textile substates, 
three integration approaches can be considered: (1) direct printing 
onto the textile, which may require several layers of ink to guarantee 
the desired properties, (2) printing on an interface layer previously 
coated or laminated on the textile, or (3) printing on a polymeric 
substrate and respective lamination on the final textile. For either 
solution, the required materials are only integrated on specific 
areas, ensuring that the breathability and flexibility of the fabric are 
scarcely impacted.
	
From the identified approaches, an enhancement of the textile 
surface’s smoothness is required in the second one. Particularly, 
this can be achieved by resorting to an interface layer that can be 
coated or laminated. For surface coating, the chosen material can 
be deposited by typical coating techniques, as spin coating or slot 
die, or even by printing techniques. Several layers might be coated 
to create the necessary smoothness. Coating materials are usually 
of polymeric nature, being non-conductive and compatible with the 
functional layers. Depending on the final application, an adequate 
selection of the coating material may be performed, since it can 
affect the properties of the textile, such as its color and appearance. 
As an alternative approach, polymeric membranes can be laminated 
on the textile substrate. Materials as thermoplastic polyurethane 

492
Smart Textiles
(TPU) have a high adhesion to fiber-based structures and are 
compatible with several printing inks. Nevertheless, this solution 
might not be suitable for some applications since high temperatures 
and mechanical pressure are usually required to laminate these 
membranes.
	
In addition, printed films integrated on smart textiles may be 
faced with harsh conditions, since textiles are often stretched and 
rubbed against while being exposed to different environments. 
Therefore, achieving the necessary durability, flexibility, and 
washability of the textiles can be challenging. To overcome this 
problem, printed devices can be encapsulated with a protective 
material to improve their durability and increase their resistance 
to washability. Typical encapsulation materials include acrylates, 
elastomers, silicones, epoxies, and others. The protective layers can 
be deposited by adding an additional step to the selected printing 
process. In this scope, several types of encapsulation inks compatible 
with printing techniques are commercially available, which can 
provide good flexibility and elasticity, good dielectric properties, as 
well as hydrophobicity for waterproofing.
	
Moreover, other non-printing approaches can be considered to 
protect printed films. Polymeric materials in membrane form, as 
referred previously, can also be laminated as an encapsulation layer, 
without significantly impacting the flexibility of the textile solution. 
As an alternative, the same thermoplastic materials can be applied 
by resorting to hot-melt processes, where the melted material is 
deposited onto the printed film. When electronic components are 
also integrated on the films, other techniques can be exploited. 
Glob top encapsulation, as in conventional electronics, is a versatile 
technique that can be easily employed on small surfaces. In this 
method, a resin epoxy is dispensed through a syringe to encapsulate 
the desired areas and components. At an industrial scale, transfer 
molding is an encapsulation method that relies in the injection of an 
epoxy resin through a mold at high pressures for the compound to 
adapt to the film and components. The final product usually presents 
good reliability; nevertheless, the required high temperatures and 
pressures can be a problem once they degrade the substrate and 
printed materials.
	
Chapter 10, “Encapsulation of Organic Electronics,”  provides 
more information about the related materials and methods.

12.2.3 Smart Yarns and Fabrics
12.2.3.1 Polymers
The unique properties of polymers have long been gaining 
attention and investigation from both academia and industry. The 
characteristics of different polymers rely on how the long chains 
of the molecules repeat themselves and bond with each other. 
The inherent structure, along with the way molecules arrange 
themselves and cross-link, aids the responsiveness of materials 
to external stimulus. These external stimuli could be referring to 
changes in light intensity, temperature, pH, electricity or magnetic 
field, mechanical deformation, biological stimuli, etc.
	
The increasing demands in developing and promoting smart 
materials in various types of applications in both academia and 
industry, polymer- and fiber-based materials are of the most 
interest. Nowadays, it is possible to observe a strong trend toward 
progress and publications regarding advanced polymers, and the 
increasing amount of research works in several directions shows 
the tendency of major engineering material systems to transition 
from structural to functional with a prospective future of low-carbon 
sustainable intelligent materials. Piezoelectric, semiconducting, 
and thermoelectric materials are seen in many state-of-the-
art applications and intelligent devices based on their unique 
characteristics.
	
The stimuli-responsive polymers hold various working 
mechanisms for multiple specialized applications, while possess 
memorizing, learning, and reacting capabilities from a molecular 
level. The working mechanisms of stimuli-responsive polymers 
could be dived in three major fields: shape-memory, self-healing, 
and responsive polymers.
	
Shape-memory intelligent polymers (SMPs) are polymeric 
materials that can transit between different predefined shapes 
when external stimuli are introduced. They offer a wide range 
of applications in biomedical, intelligent devices, medicine, 
aerospace, photonics, manufacturing, textiles, and household 
goods. Two approaches are mainly taken—either the viscoelastic 
approach or the phase transition approach—to analyze and 
model the behavior of SMPs. Among SMPs with various working 
Materials

494
Smart Textiles
principles, thermoresponsive SMPs are the most studied. A typical 
thermoresponsive SMP has a temperature-dependent working 
cycle. When the surrounding environment is at a lower temperature, 
the memorized stage of a thermoresponsive SMP has a less-ordered 
configuration, the molecular connections are relaxed and stable with 
weak thermal motion, and the switching segments are elongated 
and fixed in the polymer. When heat is applied, the polymer shows 
viscoelastic characteristics as the molecular motion becomes active, 
chain orientations are switched, and net-points are dislocated, 
leading to a new set of interactions between chains.
	
Mechanical stimuli, such as stress, strain, and twist, cause 
changes in the form of polymers, and some polymers show 
recovering properties to transfer back to their previous defined 
shapes. Compared with metals and ceramics, these polymers are 
easier to process at lower costs. The self-healing ability of a polymer 
is obtained either extrinsically (from the polymer structure) or 
intrinsically (from the material molecular chain). Extrinsic healing 
comprises the majority of cases, in which healing compounds are 
stored in capsules or nanoparticles isolated from the polymer matrix. 
Otherwise, intrinsic self-healing polymers utilize the mobility of 
molecule chains by rearranging their configuration. Either way, the 
original functions, such as electrical conductivity, integrity of the 
surface structure, or other mechanical properties of the material, 
are restored, which is where the term “self-healing” comes from. 
Stretchable, switchable, and elastic hydrogels are hydrophilic 
with cross-linking structural networks. However, despite these 
outstanding features, the applications of hydrogels still present a 
certain level of limitation due to their weakness in bonding, inability 
to be controlled, difficulty to actuate, and complexities in design-
responsive polymers. When single or multiple stimuli are applied 
to the material, macroscopic responses, such as swelling/collapse 
or solution–gel transitions, are induced, depending on the physical 
state of the chains.
	
Although mechanical and thermal-responsive polymers are 
gaining a significant amount of attention, other types of responsive 
polymers, such as those responsive to magnetic fields, humidity 
fluctuations, or pH changes, are being studied. Magnetic-resistant 
polymer gels and elastomers, for example, are composites based 
on magnetic nanoparticles scattered in a high-elastic polymeric 

495
matrix, so that their behaviors can be controlled spatiotemporally 
by external magnetic fields. For those composites, adding magnetic 
nanoparticles leads to added magnetic features, so that materials can 
interact with magnetic fields. As a result, the magnetic field easily 
deforms the polymer matrix without noise, heat, or fatigue, making 
it suitable for the preparation of sensors, micromachines, energy 
transducers, controlled distribution systems, and environmental 
and biomedical applications.
	
A variety of sensing applications is also another well-studied 
field of polymers. They have been developed taking advantage 
of characteristics of polymers, including humidity sensors, 
actuators, and membranes (which have various applications such 
as biomimetic fibrous fabrics). Response to humidity means the 
hydrophilic polymer should have porous networks to form the fiber 
structure to let water molecules go through. When ambient humidity 
is raised, polymers absorb those water molecules and desorb in 
low-moisture circumstances. Depending on working mechanisms, 
humidity sensors can be divided into two categories: capacitive 
sensors and resistive sensors. As capacitance or resistance values 
change in response to surrounding humidity changes, such as from 
adsorbing or releasing water molecules, a signal response from 
the electric circuit is generated. The multi-responsiveness of the 
polymers allows their applications to encompass various combined 
features. In these cases, polymers are normally designed to be 
responsive to not only humidity but also other stimuli such as heat, 
light, or chemical vapors. Recently, actuating applications have been 
investigated, wherein using polymers to convert chemical or physical 
energy into mechanical energy enables them to serve as actuators. 
With functional molecules incorporated into the chemical structure, 
most polymers are easily functionalized to achieve a given property 
through prepolymerization or postpolymerization. In other words, 
the potential for designing new materials or modifying them to 
meet a wide range of application-need-based criteria standards or 
specific requirements is unlimited and worth exploring. For example, 
thermal-responsive polymers can be applied even in a wide range of 
applications such as data storage.
	
Textiles have experienced great improvements through the 
incorporation of different kinds of stimuli-responsive polymers 
in their formulation. Temperature, pH, moisture, and light were 
Materials

496
Smart Textiles
responsible for the variable aesthetic appeal, smart controlled drug 
release, wound monitoring, and smart wetting properties of new 
textiles. In addition, textiles that provide safety against significant 
changes in weather environments and textiles with medicinal 
properties have also been accomplished through stimuli-responsive 
polymers. Other than stimuli-responsive polymers, other materials 
are also making smart textiles accessible and feasible. Recent 
developments in textile-based triboelectric and piezoelectric 
generators will inevitably boost next-generation intelligent 
wearable electronics. A textile-based generator combines both 
mechanical energy harvesting and sensing abilities, while providing 
the versatile design of a carrier from the flexible platform of textiles. 
Current difficulties include the tradeoff between the achievements 
of outstanding electrical performance and textile properties in fiber-
based generators.
	
Stimuli-responsive polymers can be used in smart textiles 
and apparel, intelligent medical instruments and auxiliaries, 
electrochemical devices, artificial muscles and robotics, biomimetic 
devices, heat-shrinkable materials for electronics packaging, 
microelectromechanical systems, actuators and sensors, and active 
sound-absorbing materials and flexible speakers. This family of 
materials that can sense environmental signals and respond to the 
respective signals has inspired many researchers to develop smart 
textiles with self-regulated structures and characteristics.
	
Intelligent polymer-based fibrous materials have been recently 
explored for their practical applications. Fibrous substrates can 
serve as intermediate types of materials in strength and flexibility, 
in contrast to polymeric gels that are very flexible but usually show 
lower strength or molecular integrity. An appropriate polymeric 
material should afford intelligent materials with suitable sensitivity 
to external stimuli while maintaining good mechanical properties 
to be processed in a fiber form. It is envisioned that over the next 
decades, new products based on intelligent polymers and fibrous 
materials will be produced and commercialized. Smart fibers, 
fabrics, and clothing start with a review of the background of smart 
technology and go on to cover a wide range of material science and 
fiber science aspects of the technology.

497
12.2.3.2 Multicomponent fibers
The current trends in polymer melt spinning are manifold. Recent 
research activities include the enhancement of mechanical 
properties, implementation of electric or magnetic functions, 
the introduction of biologically active species such as drugs or 
silver composites, as well as variation in fiber morphology by 
multicomponent spinning. Multicomponent fibers are among 
the most interesting developments in the field of synthetic fibers. 
Multicomponent fibers are synthetic fibers made from two or more 
polymers of different chemical and/or physical structures, extruded 
from a common spinneret to form a single filament. The polymer 
flows are kept separate up to the spin pack and brought together 
in or before the spinneret capillary. When the filament leaves the 
spinneret, it consists of non-mixed components that are fused at the 
interface. Depending on the characteristics of the different polymers, 
the multicomponent fiber can provide functional properties such as 
thermal bonding, self-crimping, unique cross sections, and achieve 
functionality of special polymers or additives at a reduced cost.
	
Melt spinning is a method suitable only for polymers that can 
be melted. Many kinds of setups are available. Typically, polymeric 
material, in pellets, granules, or chips shapes, is feed in the single 
screw extruder hopper. This material is melted, homogenized, 
and transported to the melt pump. The pump allows an accurate 
throughput control and conveys the melted material to the spin 
head. The spin pack comprises polymer filtering to remove the 
impurities and some distribution parts, as well as the spinneret that 
is responsible for the filament formation. The working principle 
of a spinneret is similar to a bathroom shower head. It distributes 
the melt polymer through one (monofilament) or multiple 
(multifilament) orifices. Then, fibers go through a quenching 
chamber or a water bath for solidification and, before reaching 
the drawing rolls, a finishing oil is applied. The ratio between the 
velocity of roll 1 and the velocity of extrusion (v0) results in the 
draw down ratio (DDR)—hot stretching. The cold draw ratio (CDR) 
is the ratio between the velocity of the stretching roll 2 and roll 1. 
These parameters influence, among others, the yarn’s mechanical 
properties, namely, the tenacity and elongation at break, as well 
as the final linear density of the yarn. Between the relaxation roll 
Materials

498
Smart Textiles
(roll 3) and roll 2, the yarn relaxation is applied, prior to being 
collected into a spool. To improve drawability, the godets are heated, 
or the filaments can be guided over hot plates or through stretching 
ovens. Finally, these fibers are collected into a spool by a winder. 
Figure 12.1 presents a schematic assembly of a tricomponent melt-
spinning line.
Figure 12.1 Schematic assembly of a tricomponent melt-spinning line.
	
The cross-sectional shape is one of the most important 
morphological features of ﬁbers. Today, a round ﬁber cross section is 
the most common shape manufactured by synthetic ﬁber producers. 
However, in ﬁber applications, a round cross section is not always 
preferred.
	
The development of melt-spun fibers with noncircular cross 
sections started in the 1960s. The first attempt was to mimic the 
gloss of expensive silk fibers by changing the cross section to a 
trilobal shape. Since then, various types of noncircular fibers have 
been developed to add functionality and aesthetics to synthetic 
fibers.
	
The cross section of a synthetic fiber that is produced by the melt-
spinning method can be easily varied by changes in the spinneret 
hole shape. Fibers with a noncircular cross-sectional shape show 
properties different from those of fibers with a circular cross-

499
sectional shape, including the bending stiffness, coefficient of friction, 
softness, luster, comfort, pilling, bulkiness, handle, and performance. 
Figure 12.2 shows several cross sections of multicomponent fibers.
Figure 12.2 Several cross sections of multicomponent fibers.
12.2.3.3 Conductive yarns
In recent years, a variety of conductive materials have been 
extensively used to build electronic textiles, such as metal and 
metal oxide (nanoparticles, nanowires, and nanorods), conductive 
polymers, and carbon nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes, graphene).
Metallic Nanostructure
Due to the high free-electron density, metals are the most conductive 
materials on earth, among which silver is the most widely studied 
given its highest conductivity. However, as metal wires are relatively 
rigid and not easily woven into the fabric, they are usually coated on 
polymer fibers or embedded in composite fibers. When the size of 
metals decreases down to the nanoscale, their physical properties 
become distinct from their bulk counterparts. This enables the 
metal nanostructures to be competent candidates for conductive-
Materials

500
Smart Textiles
filled materials in textile-based applications. Extensive studies have 
demonstrated the successful application of silver, gold, and copper 
nanowires in electronic textile devices.
Conductive Polymers
Conductive 
polymers 
with 
π-conjugated 
bond 
structures 
possess electrical properties comparable to metals. Besides 
that, they have additional advantages, including light, weight, 
transparency, intrinsic flexibility, processability, cost effectiveness, 
biocompatibility, etc. Commonly used conductive polymers include 
polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline (PANI), polythiophenes (PTs), and 
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), which satisfy different 
practical requirements. In particular, PPy has been widely utilized 
in biomedical applications, attributed to its thermal stability, 
biocompatibility, and biodegradability. Nevertheless, it is sensitive 
to moisture and prone to deterioration over time when exposed to a 
humid environment. In contrast, PANI displays high environmental 
stability and is the optimal choice for corrosion protection, while its 
non-biodegradability, low processability, and low flexibility limit its 
application in biological fields. PEDOT is another conjugated polymer 
that shows higher electrical conductivity and thermal stability than 
PPy. When doped with a polyanion like poly-styrenesulfonate (PSS), 
the formed PEDOT:PSS has become the standard for conductive 
polymers and is extensively used for flexible sensors in a number of 
applications.
Carbon Nanomaterials
Carbon nanomaterials (e.g., carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, 
and its derivatives) hold enormous potential in the application 
of conductive yarns. This is due to their low dimensionality, huge 
specific surface area, and a collection of fascinating physical 
properties, including excellent flexibility, ultrahigh strength, and 
electrical conductivity. In detail, the elastic modulus and fracture 
strength of graphene were reported to be ~1 TPA and around 
130 GPa, respectively. Furthermore, its electrical conductivity 
and thermal conductivity reached as high as 107 S/m and 
3500 W/(K · m), respectively. The nanoscale size also makes them 
easily assembled into the macroscopic hierarchical textiles, endowing 
the textile structures not only with high mechanical robustness and 
electrical conductivity but also with multifunctionality. To increase 

501
the processibility of carbon nanomaterials, defect engineering and 
chemical functionalization are usually adopted. Representative 
demonstrations are graphene oxide (GO) and reduced GO (rGO), 
where oxygen functional groups attached to the surface help avoid 
agglomeration and improve dispersion. Moreover, the solution-
processable GO and rGO facilitate the large-scale production of 
textiles.
Fabrication Processes of Conductive Yarns
Conductive yarns can be prepared in several methods, which are 
briefly categorized into two main ways. One is the use of conductive 
materials to form a solution or melt to co-mingled spinning, such as 
electrospinning, melt spinning, and wet spinning. The other is the 
use of physical and chemical manner to deposit and coat conductive 
substances on (or within) the fiber surface, such as dip coating, 
chemical plating, electroplating, and so on. Additionally, sometimes 
a combination of the above methods is employed to fabricate 
conductive fibers, such as a combination of electrospinning and dip 
coating.
Blended Yarn
Blended yarn is used to blend two or more fibers to form a yarn. This 
method is commonly used in the textile industry, and researchers 
apply this method to the preparation of conductive fibers, mainly by 
mixing the metal fibers (or wires) and elastic fibers into a bundle 
of composite fibers, in which metal fibers or wires are used to 
achieve electrical conductivity. Overall, the blended conductive yarn 
has good electrical conductivity, abrasion resistance, and moisture 
absorption.
Dip Coating
Dip coating is a simple and efficient preparation process for 
conductive fibers, which usually involves three steps: first, the 
fibers are immersed in the conductive coating; second, the fibers 
are removed after some time; and, finally, the fibers are dried. Tan et 
al. (2020) employed AgNW suspension as a coating to obtain AgNW 
conductive fibers by immersing the PU fibers in AgNW suspension. 
After the dipping process, the fibers were removed from the solution 
and dried; the process was done several times to increase the 
electrical conductivity of the fibers. Several researchers have used 
Materials

502
Smart Textiles
this approach to make conductive fibers with different properties for 
numerous functions. With this technique, it is possible to fabricate 
different types of conductive fibers, such as intrinsic conductive 
polymer PEDOT with polyelectrolyte poly (styrene sulfonate) (PSS), 
silver nanowires, graphene, CB, etc.
Chemical Plating
Chemical plating is a way of preparing conductive fibers using the 
chemical principle of redox, without the need of using electricity. 
With this technique, the metal ions are reduced to metal deposited 
on the surface of the fiber to form a dense coating by adding a 
reducing agent to a solution containing metal ions. The common 
plating layers are silver, aluminum, nickel, and copper, which provide 
high electrical conductivity to the fibers.
Electroplating
Electroplating, also called electrodeposition, is a common way to 
prepare a conductive fiber through the electrolytic effect, where the 
plated metal cations in the salt solution get electrons to generate 
metal monomers deposited on the surface of the target fiber to 
form a coating. The thickness of the plated layer can be controlled 
by changing the current level and the deposition time. The most 
common plated metals are nickel, copper, and silver. Electroplating 
is an excellent way to fabricate conductive fibers. First, it is possible 
to change the thickness of the coating by controlling the current 
level and the exposure time. Second, it is possible to obtain yarns 
with multilayer coatings increasing the electrical conductivity of the 
yarn and preventing the appearance of defects.
Chemical Vapor Deposition
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a process that utilizes the 
chemical reaction of gases near a substrate to deposit various 
materials. In a typical CVD process, the substrate is exposed to 
one or multiple volatile precursors, which react or disintegrate on 
the surface of the substrate to form the deposited materials. This 
approach is widely used in the semiconductor industry, as it can 
provide a solid coating with high quality and resistance on any 
substrates. CVD is a versatile economical process for preparing 
conducive fibers because it can be applied to deposit any elements 
or compounds and coat them on several different parts at the same 

503
time. However, CVD sometimes employs toxic, corrosive, flammable, 
and explosive precursor gases, resulting in certain safety issues.
Physical Vapor Deposition
Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a promising technology for the 
functionalization of fibers. It is a basic physical vapor coating process 
in which the transfer of materials from the solid phase to the gas 
phase happens via atom by atom or molecule by molecule to deposit 
the coating materials onto the fiber surface. Vacuum evaporation and 
sputtering are two main techniques belonging to PVD. Both can be 
used to develop conductive fibers, where the last one is considered 
an environment-friendly functional technology.
	
Vacuum evaporation is one of the most common methods for 
depositing functional films on various substrates. The vacuum 
prevents the evaporated particles from colliding with the background 
gas or other unwanted particles, allowing the vapor particles to 
be deposited directly onto the substrate. The vacuum evaporation 
process includes two steps: evaporation of the functional materials 
and condensation of them on the substrate. In vacuum evaporation, 
the coating material is melted, gasified, and evaporated by electric 
heating or electron beam heating. Then, the steam of the coating 
material reaches the substrate surface and gradually cools, 
eventually forming a film layer with good quality.
	
Sputtering is one of the most promising technologies in PVD, 
which first appeared in the late 1970s. It has been widely used in 
numerous areas for the modification of various materials. Sputtering 
is a process in which high-energy ions bombard the target, causing 
the atoms or molecules on the target to fall off. These ejected atoms 
or molecules agglomerate and form thin films on the substrate owing 
to their kinetic energy and orientation.
12.3 Integration Technologies
Textiles show many advantages, being unique in many ways. The 
versatility of textiles, both in the production processes and in the 
final application, is quite high. The fibers or filaments are part of this 
construction process, and their application in the most varied types 
of final products is possible. In addition to their basic constitution 
and properties as fibers/filaments, they can also be organized in 
Integration Technologies

504
Smart Textiles
various ways (threads or textile structures), which can give rise to 
both two-dimensional and three-dimensional products.
	
The manufacture of wearables can be done through different 
levels of textile integration. It is possible to manufacture textiles 
with electrical or advanced properties by integrating filaments into 
textiles during the manufacturing process or after the fabrication of 
the textile structure. In the work by Guo et al. (2020), a review was 
made on textile electrodes for electromyography. In this work, the 
various levels of integration are described, being divided into four 
levels (exemplified in Fig. 12.3):
	
1.	 Level 1 (add on): At this level of integration, the textile only 
serves as a support material and can be used as a method of 
fixing nontextile electrodes. An example of this level of fastening 
is cutting and sewing. Where electrodes are integrated into a 
certain textile base, they are later embroidered on a second 
textile base. With this integration level, the electrodes can 
be made by both printing technologies and textile-based 
technologies.
	
2.	 Level 2 (integrated onto): Level 2 corresponds to the 
integration of electrodes through printing or dyeing 
techniques. This type of method is normally used after the 
fabrication of the textile structure. The type of ink to be used 
is adjusted according to the desired application.
	
3.	 Level 3 (integrated into): Level 3 is similar to level 2, as 
the material is placed on the surface of the textile after it is 
manufactured; however, instead of functional inks, conductive 
filaments are used (in the case of fabrication of textile 
electrodes). This type of integration is more robust than 
level 2 as the filaments are embroidered on the surface of the 
textile; however, it is post-process integration.
	
4.	 Level 4 (seamless integration): Finally, this integration 
method is carried out during the fabrication process of textile 
structures. It can be through the fabrication of knits, fabrics, 
and non-woven structures. This manufacturing method 
requires adjustments to the manufacturing process, requiring 
that the filaments to be integrated are compatible with the 
textile structure and withstand the manufacturing process. 

505
However, no additional steps are required after the fabrication 
process of the textile structure.
Figure 12.3 Textile integration levels of conductive electrodes.
12.3.1 Textile-Based Processes
Most textiles are produced by twisting fibers into yarns and then 
knitting or weaving the yarns into a fabric. This method of making 
textile structures has been used for thousands of years. But 
throughout most of that time, workers did the twisting, knitting, or 
weaving largely by hand. With today’s modern machinery, textile 
mills can manufacture as much fabric in a few seconds as it once 
took workers weeks to produce by hand. The production of textiles 
is done by different production methods (such as weaving and 
knitting). In this way, it is possible to integrate conductive elements 
using yarns, for the generation of well-defined patterns through 
different techniques.
12.3.1.1 Weaving
Weaving technology forms textiles through the defined crossing 
of two systems of parallel yarns: the warp, in the direction of the 
length, and the weft, in the direction of the width. This is done on a 
machine known as a loom, a relatively complex machine, made up of 
several mechanisms that, in synchrony, allow the crossing of the weft 
yarns with the warp yarns. There is a set of preliminary operations 
Integration Technologies

506
Smart Textiles
to prepare the yarns in the direction of the length, forming the warp, 
and the way they will cross with the weft yarns. To form the fabric, 
the loom performs three fundamental movements: opening the 
shed, inserting the weft, and beating the comb.
	
From the opening of the shed, the vertical separation of the warp 
yarns occurs, different in each passage, creating a tunnel through 
which the weft yarn is inserted, resulting in the final structure of the 
fabric.
	
The weft is created by passing a yarn across the width of the 
loom, through the shed previously formed. This weft yarn, thus 
inserted, is called a passage. There are several ways to introduce 
this passage, namely by shuttle, tweezers, air jet, projectile, etc. The 
comb beating involves moving a comb so that the inserted passage 
borders the already formed tissue.
	
The fabric weave or design is how the warp and weft are 
interlaced. The pattern or repeat is the smallest unit of the weave, 
which when repeated will produce the design required in the fabric. 
There are several types of weaves, the most common being taffeta, 
twill, and satin.
	
Taffeta is the simplest and most used weave. This type of 
structure is characterized by the alternating interweaving of the 
weft and warp yarns (Fig. 12.4). In this way, the front and back of the 
fabric are similar.
Figure 12.4 Design of a taffeta structure.
	
Twill is characterized by passing the weft yarn under two 
sequential warp yarns and over the next two, creating an advance of 
one yarn in the next pass (Fig. 12.5). This sequence creates a pattern 
of parallel diagonal lines.

507
Figure 12.5 Design of a twill structure.
	
Satin is characterized by the passage of the weft yarn under one 
warp yarn and over the next four yarns (Fig. 12.6), with discontinuity 
between ligaments. As it has fewer ligaments, this structure creates 
more fluid fabric, in which the warp yarns are more visible on one 
side and the weft yarns on the other.
Figure 12.6 Design of a satin structure.
	
All these types of textile structures and their derivatives can 
be applied in the development of smart textiles. Since they all 
arise from the interlacing of weft yarns with warp yarns, it is 
possible to integrate conductive yarns in one or both directions to 
create sensors, actuators, and even heating systems. However, it is 
important to mention that given the complexity and consumption 
of the warp yarns, usually, the integration of conductive yarns takes 
place preferably in the weft direction. There is less yarn consumption 
and fewer integration challenges, with the possibility of producing 
simple or complex structures, including 3D structures.
Integration Technologies

508
Smart Textiles
12.3.1.2 Knitting
Knitting processes involve interlacing loops of yarns, which are 
formed on a knitting needle, together in a line. It requires a relatively 
fine, smooth, strong yarn with good elastic recovery properties, 
which may contain conductive elements. The loops may be either 
loosely or closely constructed, according to the purpose of the fabric. 
The loops or stitches are interlocked using a needle that holds the 
existing loop, and a new loop is formed in front of the old loop. The 
old loop is then brought over the new loop to form the knitted fabric. 
There are two types of knitting: weft knitting and warp knitting. The 
difference between weft and warp knitting originates in the way the 
needles move during production and in the way the yarn is supplied. 
In this sense, elastic properties must be considered with care as 
the elongation of a loop-based structure is different compared with 
straight-laid weft.
	
Weft knits are produced from one or more weft yarns that are 
transformed, through loops, forming a horizontal line (Fig. 12.7). 
This is a one-fiber technique, meaning only one fiber is needed to 
build the stitches and the needles are moved separately.
Figure 12.7 Design of a weft mesh.
	
In warp knitting, needles are moved simultaneously. Therefore, 
all needles need fiber material at the same time. For this reason, the 
yarn is supplied with the help of warp beams, forming a vertical line 
(Fig. 12.8).
	
As far as knits are concerned, they can also be applied in the 
development of smart textiles, most used for sportswear and textile 
medical devices. However, given the complexity and requirements 
of yarns for the development of a mesh, not all types of conductive 

509
yarns can be integrated into mesh structures. In this type of 
structure, textile yarns with conductive coatings are most used, as 
they seem like traditional textile yarns. In this sense, it is possible to 
create pieces of clothing or areas of clothing with sensitive or active 
capacity.
Figure 12.8 Design of a warp mesh.
12.3.1.3 Embroidery
The principle of embroidery and sewing technique is based on the 
formation of patterns through the crossing of two yarns, one or 
both of which may or may not be made from conductive yarns. The 
major advance in embroidery and sewing techniques lies in the high 
flexibility of patterns with a resolution in the order of 1 mm, compared 
to other processes such as weaving, knitting, and printing, as the 
integration on the surface does not depend on the textile structure. 
Embroidery also offers much more tailorability and customization 
than other processes because it can be embedded in clothing at the 
end of the garment-manufacturing process, alloying, for example, 
the integration of localized connections to the conductive structures 
in the textile.
	
Nevertheless, there are restrictions regarding yarn diameter and 
yarn properties resulting from the principle used in embroidery 
machines, where the front yarn is pushed through the basic fabric 
Integration Technologies

510
Smart Textiles
using a needle and then must form a loop on the backside of the 
fabric. The backing yarn must be transported through this loop, 
which thus is an essential requirement to form the embroidery 
(Fig. 12.9).
Figure 12.9 Schematic of a traditional embroidery process.
	
However, some types of machines are equipped with a tape 
header that allows the deposition of materials not suitable for 
processing with the needle header, including tapes, rovings, thick 
yarns, as well as stiff nontextile elements on one side of the fabric. 
With the tape header, the upper yarn is used to fix the yarn material 
on the fabric by overcasting it in a zig-zag arrangement (Fig. 12.10).
Figure 12.10 Schematic of cording embroidery process.

511
	
Comparing the two types of embroidery, regarding the production 
of smart textiles, embroidery through “cording stitch” offers a greater 
number of advantages, since it allows the integration and creation 
of patterns with conductive yarns that are more metallic and less 
textile. This is because the conductive yarns do not have to enter 
the embroidery machine feed, not being subjected to many types of 
tensions that do not allow this type of yarns to be embroidered by 
the traditional process. Thus, with the creation of the tape header, 
the range of yarns that could be integrated by embroidery processes, 
such as conductive yarns, was expanded, allowing the creation of 
intelligent textile systems, such as sensors, actuators, and heating 
systems.
12.3.2 Printed Electronics
Printed electronics results from the conjugation of conventional 
printing techniques and functional materials to manufacture smart 
devices and systems. Over the last years, printed technologies 
have been attracting increasing interest from the electronics, 
scientific, and industrial sectors due to their outstanding benefits, 
such as low manufacturing cost, large-area processability, and 
low energy consumption, when compared with conventional 
processes. Additionally, printed devices also benefit from favorable 
characteristics such as low weight, stretchability, resistance to 
folding and bending, and others. As a result, great advances have 
been made to develop materials compatible with printing techniques 
and to produce printed devices with outstanding performances.
	
As already discussed in the previous topics, due to the variety of 
textile materials available, the method of integration of functionalities 
in these substrates depends on the surface of the fabric and the 
electrical properties that must be attained, as well as the chosen 
functional materials. In this scope, several works have been done to 
incorporate electronic circuits and components directly or indirectly 
on textiles, which in some levels of integration can be achieved by 
resorting to printed techniques and devices. Therefore, smart 
textiles can undoubtedly benefit from the characteristics of printed 
electronics, particularly due to the capability of producing solutions 
with washable, stretchable, and breathable properties.
Integration Technologies

512
Smart Textiles
	
In printed technologies, the functional materials of the device 
and/or system can be directly printed as patterns onto the respective 
substrate through an additive fabrication process, contrasting with 
the complex steps usually required in conventional techniques. 
To accomplish that, a wide range of printing methods have been 
adapted to answer the demands of printed devices, with distinct 
characteristics. Consequently, depending on the nature of the 
desired device or system, the selected printing technique must be in 
agreement with the ink, substrate, designed structure, and pattern, 
in addition to other production aspects as speed, yield, quantity, 
and cost. Hence, the fundamental parameters to consider in this 
selection can be described as (a) printing resolution, including the 
accuracy achieved for multilayer structures; (b) printing uniformity; 
(c) wetting control; and (d) compatibility between inks and printing 
components.
	
Chapter 3, “Printing and Processing Techniques,” provides a 
comprehensive introduction to this technology field.
12.3.3 Interconnections
The subject of interconnections is of paramount importance when 
discussing the integration of smart functionalities/devices in textile 
structures. The main characteristics of textiles are related with its 
intrinsic conformability, adaptability, and flexibility, features that 
place a challenge to the integration of smart solutions that often lead 
to rigid versus flexible interfaces. Therefore, when considering the 
development of smart textile-based solutions, it is crucial to explore 
the processes and materials that will be applied to interconnect the 
different embedded devices, assuring the functionality of the overall 
smart system. This exploration can resort with the application of 
both flexible solutions such as conductive yarns and inks, or with 
the application of customized connectors.
12.3.3.1 Functional and conductive yarns
A wide range of electrical connectors on the market are used to join 
two or more cables safely and easily or sets of wires during electrical 
work. There are mechanical connectors and solder connections; 
however, these types of solutions tend to be unsuitable to use in 

513
electronic textiles (e-textiles). In recent years, with the appearance 
of a greater number of wearables on the market, more appropriate 
connectors have appeared. This type of connector tends to be 
based on spring-loaded connectors. These types of connectors are 
very practical to mount on conductive textiles since just the spring 
needs to be placed on the textile surface. Furthermore, this process 
is already used in the textile industry as it can be easily adapted 
to industrial processes. However, it presents some problems: for 
instance, the electrical contact is exposed and it is a bulky solution.
	
To avoid the issue of exposed contacts and allow the connections 
to be washed and remain protected upon contact with water, solutions 
such as Ohmatex connectors and JAE’s RK01 were developed. These 
connectors are more robust and offer the possibility of having several 
conductor wires soldered in proximity. However, this solution does 
not work well with wires that are hard to solder with conventional 
techniques, such as nickel wires and thermoplastic yarns. Therefore, 
there is a need for the development of e-textile connectors that allow 
a quick connection between the conductive wires and a connector, 
without the need of soldering processes.
	
An increasingly explored example is the mechanical connection 
of conductive yarns through embroidery and/or sewing processes. 
For this, textile yarns with conductive coatings or uncoated metallic 
yarns are normally used. In this way, through embroidery and/or 
sewing technique (explained earlier), non-insulated conductive 
yarns overlap, which allows the mechanical connection between 
them and, consequently, the conduction of electric current. However, 
this type of solution is still under development since it needs 
optimization of connection quality and washing resistance.
12.3.3.2 Printed electronics
Similar to conventional processes, electrical interconnections and/or 
system integrations are an important step in printed electronics. In 
this scope, one of the major difficulties is related to the temperatures 
that printed films and substrates can withstand without being 
damaged. Like conductive yarns, soldering is the most common 
interconnection method, exhibiting high reliability; however, the 
typical process temperature with standard solders can achieve 
values above 250°C. Therefore, this process is not compatible with 
most printed applications.
Integration Technologies

514
Smart Textiles
	
As an alternative, conductive adhesives present interesting 
characteristics for printed electronics. These adhesives are 
composed of conductive fillers and an adhesive matrix, being suitable 
for deposition by printing methods, particularly screen printing or 
dispensing. In electronics applications, epoxy is the most commonly 
used adhesive matrix due to its high bonding strength and stability. 
In its turn, conductive adhesives in specific can be divided into 
two groups: isotropic conductive adhesive (ICA) and anisotropic 
conductive adhesive (ACA). ICAs are designated as “isotropic” due 
to their electrical bonding in all directions (x, y, and z), similar to 
conventional solders. The most used ICAs are based on silver fillers 
(around 50–60% of volume) and require curing temperatures 
up to 150°C. On the other hand, the structure of ACAs contains 
a low amount of conducting particles (around 2–3% of volume) 
and provides the capability of bonding only in a specific direction, 
hence the “anisotropic” property. These properties are particularly 
interesting for fine pitch connections. For ACAs, bonding is achieved 
by combining temperature and mechanical pressure.
	
One of the main topics explored in the field of printed electronics 
is related to the production of hybrid devices, which combine 
printed circuits with rigid electronic components, allying the 
process simplicity of printing techniques and the maturity of 
silicon-based components. As a result, conventional manufacturing 
techniques can be substituted for high-throughput processes with 
lower costs. In a succinct way, the production of hybrid devices can 
be divided into three steps: (1) printing of the electronic circuit onto 
the intended substrate by resorting to the most suitable printing 
method, (2) deposition of a conductive adhesive on the areas where 
the component pads must be placed, and (3) placement of the 
electronic component. The conductive adhesive can be deposited by 
different techniques, such as stencil printing or dispensing, the latter 
being the most suitable for upscaling solutions. The positioning 
and placement of electronic components can be executed by an 
automated pick-and-place equipment. Once the component is 
placed, the conductive adhesive must be subjected to a curing step to 
guarantee its bonding in terms of mechanical strength and electrical 
conductivity. A simple representation of this process is presented in 
Fig. 12.11.

515
Figure 12.11 Example of production steps of a hybrid solution: (I) film based 
on the most suitable printing technique, (II) dispensing of the conductive 
adhesive on the pad areas, (III) placement of the electronic component onto 
the dispensed pads, and (IV) final smart hybrid solution.
	
Smart textiles can also benefit from this type of application, 
allowing the integration of fully functional devices onto fiber-
based substrates and reducing external components, for example 
in wearable solutions. In fact, this application becomes even 
more interesting when further combined with textile-based 
interconnections, as conductive yarns (silver, copper). These can be 
integrated considering the processes discussed in previous topics, 
depending, for example, on the desired mechanical properties and 
electrical conductivity. In this way, the functional product can be 
designed to include printing technologies, textile-based processes, 
and conventional electronic components in a single solution, by 
adjusting each integration method according to the demands of 
flexibility and stretchability. Furthermore, the integration challenges 
related to the mechanical and electrical stability must be assessed 
for each application.
12.4 Smart Textiles Applications
12.4.1 Construction
During the past years, the construction sector is evolving to provide 
new solutions that increase the comfort of homes and the life cycle 
of the materials. In this scope, smart devices can be integrated in 
buildings to continuously assess their structural health, allowing 
a rapid implementation of corrective and interventive measures. 
For example, CeNTI’s Smart Roofs System intends to build an

intelligent waterproofing structure with an active curing system 
and sensors to overcome current anomalies identified in the market 
of roof waterproofing solutions. Specifically, this system integrates 
a smart textile structure with printed sensors for temperature and 
moisture monitoring of the waterproof membrane conditions, being 
exemplified in Fig. 12.12.
Figure 12.12 Intelligent waterproofing system proposed in Smart Roof System 
project.
	
For this solution, the measurement of the moisture can aid in the 
comprehension of the drying process of the membrane, in particular 
the period of time at which the membrane can be considered 
completely cured and to detect early roof infiltrations in the dried 
structure. The temperature monitoring can provide valuable insights 
concerning the occurrence of thermal events that can impair the 
integrity of the membrane structure, as well as the control of the 
active heating system. Regarding the integration of both sensors 
on the reinforcement textile, represented in Fig. 12.13, these were 
firstly printed with a commercial silver ink on polymeric substrates 
and then laminated onto the textile with a polyurethane membrane, 
also working as a protection membrane to the printed film.

517
Figure 12.13 Representation of the integration of printed sensors on the 
structure proposed on Smart Roofs System.
	
In the scope of this study, the moisture sensor was based on a 
capacitive principle, with the membrane itself acting as the sensing 
material of the sensor. One of the main advantages of this type of 
principle is related to the fact that the sensor does not require a 
direct contact with the medium that is being monitored, preventing 
its early damage, and improving its lifetime. Due to the selected 
transduction principle, the sensor can be designed as two coplanar 
conductive electrodes parallel to each other. When integrated on the 
monitoring medium (in this example, the waterproof membrane 
structure), the electrical capacitance measured between these 
electrodes changes according to the drying of the membrane, being 
the capacitance approximately described as:
	
C
A
d
r
= e e
0
	
	
With e0 representing the vacuum permittivity, er the relative 
permittivity of the medium, A the area of the electrodes, and d the 
distance between electrodes. When monitoring a drying process, 
this is translated by a loss of water, implying a change in the dielectric 
properties of the medium as a function of time, associated with the 
parameter er.
	
Following the example presented in Fig. 12.14, the capacitive 
response of one sensor integrated in the waterproofing membrane

is presented. After an initial peak of the capacitance, the values start 
to decrease (decrease in dielectric constant) with the loss of water 
present in the membrane, resulting in the reduction of the moisture 
content and demonstrating its drying.
Figure 12.14 Capacitive behavior of a printed moisture sensor integrated in 
the membrane structure of Smart Roofs System.
	
An additional test was performed with samples that presented 
cracks on the dried structure to understand how that occurrence 
could be detected further by the sensors. Figure 12.15 shows the 
respective results for one cracked sample subjected to this test, as 
well as of a non-cracked sample for comparison. For the cracked 
sample, it can be observed that the sensor detects the presence 
of water on its surroundings by increasing the capacitance value, 
followed by a decrease in the base capacitance with its drying. In 
contrast, by analyzing the results obtained with samples without 
cracks, no relevant changes on the capacitance were detected. 
Therefore, for the present solution, this analysis seems to be suitable 
to identify the presence of cracks in the membrane or even the 
occurrence of other damages on the structure.

519
Figure 12.15 Capacitive behavior of a cracked sample due to the deposition of 
water on the top surface of a structure from Smart Roofs System.
	
For a printed temperature sensor, a resistive operation is usually 
selected due to its simple transduction principle and typical linear 
behavior that metallic materials exhibit within a large temperature 
range. Specifically, for a linear response, the resistance dependency 
on temperature can be translated by the following equation:
	
R(T) = R0[1 + a(T – T0)]	
	
With R0 being the electrical resistance measured at the reference 
temperature T0 and a the coefficient of temperature, an intrinsic 
property of the chosen material for the sensor. As expressed from 
the previous equation, the reading sensitivity is given by the slope 
m = R0 ¥ a. Therefore, an increase in sensitivity can be achieved by 
increasing the electrical resistance of reference. In order to do that, 
the geometry of the printed sensor can be modified by acknowledging 
the equation
	
R
l
w
t
0
0
=
¥
r
	
	
Where r0 refers to the electrical resistivity at the reference 
temperature T0, l to the length of the printed resistor’s line, w to the 
width of the line, and t to the thickness of the film.
	
By acknowledging the previous considerations, a suitable 
geometry can be designed according to the final application. 
The behavior for a printed temperature sensor is presented in 
Smart Textiles Applications

Fig. 12.16. From the analysis of the results, it can be concluded that 
the response of the sensor follows a linear behavior according to the 
aforementioned premises, with a sensitivity of 0.33 Ω/°C determined 
from the slope of the curve.
Figure 12.16 Calibration curve of a printed temperature sensor measured 
after its integration in the membrane structure of Smart Roofs System.
	
By overviewing the results discussed here, the integration 
of printed sensors on the scope of Smart Roofs System imposes 
a suitable and seamless solution for an improved functionality 
of the waterproofing system, allowing a continuous and reliable 
monitoring of its internal integrity. Particularly, this type of solution 
can be extrapolated for other applications that can benefit from the 
integration of printed sensors on textile structures.
12.4.2 Health and Well-Being
Nowadays, sport practice has become more recognized as 
beneficial for health and well-being, with evident growing interest. 
Simultaneously, one of the main concerns related to sports practice 
is post-exercise muscle recovery, particularly the subsequent 

521
minimization of muscle discomfort and fatigue. Among the most 
common methods to accelerate the recovery process are reducing 
exercise volume and/or intensity, massage and compression, 
electrostimulation, and localized heating. To address these 
challenges, CeNTI is exploring new solutions with different actors 
from the textile industry and academy to optimize the recovery 
process through garments with the ability to compress, massage, 
electro-stimulate, and heat, using emerging technologies such as 
e-textiles and printed electronics.
	
These new garments, as illustrated in Fig. 12.17, incorporate 
three different active systems that can work together or alone: 
electrical discharge systems for electrostimulation, variable and 
localized printed heating systems, and massage and compression 
systems (with shape-memory alloys [SMAs]). Considering flexibility 
and customization, the project also includes a mobile application to 
interact (via Bluetooth) with the hardware system. The system is 
battery powered and can be recharged wirelessly.

electronics proposed in the Wear2Heal project.
	
With more detail, for the massage and compression, SMA’s 
springs were obtained from a commercial NiTi (nitinol wire) with 
an activation temperature of 55°C. This wire is an equiatomic 
alloy of nickel and titanium, and it is 0.5 mm in diameter and 5.3 
mm in width. Two steel jigs were used to produce these springs.

A study was performed on the effect of the applied power on their 
thermomechanical behavior, as demonstrated in Fig. 12.18. Using the 
setup presented, stretching cycles were applied for different power 
levels (0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, and 1.25 W) and in the recording of the 
variation in the force exerted by the SMA springs with the applied 
stretch (Fig. 12.19).
Figure 12.18 Setup used to evaluate the effect of applied power on the 
thermomechanical performance of SMA springs (Wear2Heal project).
Figure 12.19 Graph of force versus elongation for different levels of applied 
power (Wear2Heal project).
	
As can be seen from the results, the greater the power applied, 
the greater the force achieved. On the other hand, it appears that 

523
there is a region where the spring behavior is more linear, and its 
extension is directly dependent on the applied power level. The 
springs obtained are then cut and crimped with a ring terminal 
(leaving an active area of 4.5 cm). This ring is fixed to a textile band 
with rivets, which acts as both electrical and mechanical contact. 
The max extension of each spring (6.3 cm) is guaranteed by the 
placement of inextensible textile (see Fig. 12.20).
Figure 12.20 Representation of a compression and massage band proposed 
in the Wear2Heal project.
	
To produce the textile base electrodes for electrostimulation, 
square and rectangular electrodes (of 5 × 5 and 5 × 8 cm, respectively) 
were embroidered by normal stitch on a textile structure, with 
the smallest possible spacing between yarns. These embroideries 
were prepared using conductive embroidery yarn with silver-
coated polyamide yarn. To ensure an efficient electrostimulation, a 
conductive coating composed of polydimethylsiloxane and 6–9% of 
carbon nanotubes was applied on top of the embroidered electrode. 
The different layers can be analyzed in Fig. 12.21.
	
Subsequently, electrostimulation tests were made on a volunteer, 
where the behavior of the gastrocnemius was evaluated when an 
electrical stimulus from commercial electrodes and from textile 
electrodes was applied. Figure 12.22 shows that both present 
muscle response to the applied electrical stimulus, promoting 
electrostimulation.

polydimethylsiloxane and carbon nanotubes C, proposed in the Wear2Heal 
project.

commercial electrodes and in-house produced textile electrodes (Wear2Heal 
project).
	
For the heating systems, although advanced passive warming 
strategies save energy through the regulation of radiation, convection, 
and conduction, the final output is still limited. Therefore, active 
warming based on Joule heating has been adapted for providing 
additional thermal comfort to the user, driven by portable power 

525
sources through utilizing the electrothermal conversion systems. 
The Joule-heating textiles are required to be stable and provide 
controlled thermal regulation with a lower power supply and 
produce heat when electrical power is passed through an electrode. 
The total amount of heat produced by these flexible devices can be 
calculated by using P = I2R (where P, I, and R represent heating power 
produced by the heaters, applied current from external sources, and 
the resistance of the electrode, respectively). The implementation of 
this procedure in textiles has many potential applications, especially 
in personal heating in a cold environment and thermotherapy. 
However, during the integration of the Joule heater into wearable 
form, comfort, weight, pattern ability, and sewability of the fabrics 
should be taken into consideration. For the feasible solution to 
active heating textiles, the surface of the textile material is modified 
or embedded with electroactive materials, including CNT, graphene, 
MXene, metallic nanowires, conducting polymers, and their 
composite structures.

Within this application, a heating system was developed based 
on conductive silver ink, printed by the screen-printing technique 
into a textile structure previously treated with a thin polyurethane 
paste coating layer to uniformize and level the surface roughness and 
enhance interfacial adhesion of its surface. The developed design 
allowed differentiated heating in different areas of the circuit, with

higher and lower temperatures in the center and in the extremities 
(respectively). Circuits with 15 Ω of electrical resistance were 
obtained in coated textile structures, allowing the center area to 
reach more than 50°C with a voltage of 12 V, as in the example from 
Fig. 12.23. In the following figure, it is possible to observe a thermal 
image of the developed heating system. To encapsulate the printed 
circuit and protect it from washing cycles, a 100% polyurethane film 
was applied on top of the circuit by pressing at 140°C and 4 bar for 
20 s. This film also helps protect the electrical connections of the 
circuit and reinforce the cohesion of the multilayered system structure.
12.4.3 Automotive and Transport
Considering new solutions for automotive and transport sectors, 
CeNTI participated in a large European project, whose objective was 
to develop intelligent bulk materials for smart applications in the 
transport sector incorporating several self-responsive properties 
aiming at increasing consumer safety, component lifespan, and 
performance while reducing maintenance and manufacturing costs 
and also through-life greenhouse gas emissions. In this sense, CeNTI 
developed one self-responsive functionality based on Joule’s first 
law of heating, resulting in a smart textile fiber, based on melt-
spun yarns, for the performance of heating comfort in car seats and 
armrests. To activate the Joule effect, the constituent material needs 
to be electrically conductive, which means it should have a volume 
resistivity below 10E4 Ωcm (i.e., electrical conductivity above 10–2 
S/m). For this, new multicomponent melt-spun heating fibers 
(yarns) were developed to make them highly suitable for integration 
into textile structures through techniques such as weaving and 
knitting. The smart textile fiber (with carbon nanomaterials into the 
base matrix) was woven into a textile structure (woven fabric), with 
an electronic system combined to control the textile temperature, 
for the users safe.
	
The targeted self-responsive functionality is self-heating, a 
variation in the self-de-icing property. Target temperatures need to 
be comfortable for the final user (e.g., 35°C), without risking skin 
burns or user discomfort (e.g., 40°C). Since this application is to be 
integrated into an automotive vehicle, the operational voltage must 
be between 12 and 24 V (or higher in electric vehicles).

527
	
The use of thermoplastic fibers with self-heating properties can 
be used to replace the usual conductive metallic wires/yarns or 
heating systems and promote the user comfort inside the vehicle.
	
Figure 12.24 illustrates the concept of woven self-heating smart 
textile.
Figure 12.24 Concept of woven self-heating smart textile incorporated on a 
car seat and armrest.
	
Considering the interconnections within these applications, 
textile process based approaches can be achieved, namely, the 
application of parallel interconnections as shown in Fig. 12.25. The 
electrodes can be composed of a silver-coated PA yarn.
	
The left figure represents the system off without heating, and the 
right figure represents the system on during textile heating through 
Joule effect.
	
A power control system for heat transfer was implemented. The 
system consists of a controller that acquires the temperature on the 
textile surface and consequently acts on the heating system. When 
the temperature of 35°C is reached, the system is inactivated until it is 
necessary to heat up again. This device contains electronics that allow 
for the management and processing of information, temperature 
acquisition through digital sensors, and serial communication, for 
concentrating information from different locations. After all the 
information is collected, an update is carried out on the graphical 
interface and all data are sent to the Cloud. The conductive fibers 
Smart Textiles Applications

528
Smart Textiles
are heated by a power control circuit, allowing heat transfer to take 
place and the user to feel warm.
Figure 12.25 Layout of interconnection on the self-de-icing smart woven 
fabric.
	
An example of a woven self-heating smart textile is shown in 
Fig. 12.26, with thermal images indicating the heating along the car 
seat at different voltages.
	
Nowadays, a considerable number of car accidents is attributed 
to the sleepiness of the drivers. Several studies have concluded that 
sleepiness while driving contributes to traffic-related morbidity and 
mortality; and therefore, it has been considered a public health issue. 
An effective strategy to prevent sleepiness-related car accidents is to 
monitor the driver’s drowsing state and alert him.
	
Herein, a robust, cost-effective, and seamless sensing solution for 
automobile seats was developed at CeNTI facilities. This innovative 
solution combines the monitoring of the humidity, temperature, and 
sitting position of the driver on the car’s driving seat, to get a more 
accurate perception of the driver’s comfort state.
	
The technologies used for the fabrication of the sensors were 
capacitive sensors and resistive sensors. The capacitive sensors 
were used to monitor the humidity and applied pressure, and the 
resistive sensors were used to monitor the temperature. Each seat 
cover had a sensor matrix with four temperature sensors, five 
humidity sensors, and a 6 × 5 pressure sensor matrix.

529
Figure 12.26 Woven self-heating smart textile with thermal images.
	
All the presented sensors were integrated into the textile 
structure, made by embroidering processes (integration level 3, see 
Fig. 12.27).
	
In order to better explain each of the technologies used in this 
case, it is important to explore the differences between the two types 
of capacitive sensors used and then explore the principle of resistive 
sensors for temperature sensors.
	
Capacitive sensors are defined by the fact that capacitance 
changes under external stimulation. A common capacitive sensor is 
a parallel plate capacitor, which is usually separated by an insulating 
dielectric layer sandwiched between upper and lower conductive 
electrodes. The equation for the capacitance is as follows:
	
C
A
d
r
= e e0
	
Smart Textiles Applications

530
Smart Textiles
	
It can be seen that capacitance is affected by three factors: the 
facing area of the two conductive electrodes (A), the distance between 
the two plates (d), and the relative permittivity of the dielectric layer 
(Ɛ). In this use case, the measuring principle for the pressure sensors 
is based on the impact of the distance between two parallel plates, 
and for the humidity sensors, the measuring principle is based on 
the change in the relative permittivity of the dielectric layer.
Figure 12.27 Examples of embroidered sensors: humidity sensor (left), 
temperature sensor (right), and pressure sensor (bottom) proposed in TexBoost 
PPS4 AN1 project.
	
The matrix was made of conductive yarns, which through the 
exposure of an external mechanical force, its geometric shape 
is changed, and has as a consequence a change in the area and 
distance between the conductive yarns, leading to a change in 
capacitance. As shown in Fig. 12.28, there is a bottom layer with a 
textile structure with electrodes (weft); when the top layer (warp) 
is placed perpendicular to the bottom layer, it is possible to create 
30 localized sensors. These unitary sensors give a definition to the 
pressure matrix. If we increase the number of sensors per matrix, 
the definition increases. However, the electrical noise between 
sensors can also increase, decreasing the performance of the matrix. 
Therefore, it is important to find a tradeoff between definition and 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

531
Figure 12.28 Capacitive pressure sensor layers proposed in the TexBoost PPS4 
project.
	
After the fabrication of the sensor layers, the matrix was validated 
using commercial electronics. In order to test the matrix, four 
different sensors were tested by increasing the weight gradually. In 
Fig. 12.29, the test that was done is represented, and the signal of 
each sensor increases gradually with the increased pressure. The 
virtual mapping of the seat surface when three different weights are 
applied on top of the sensor matrix is also shown.
Figure 12.29 Validation of the capacitive pressure sensor (TexBoost PPS4 
AN1).
	
As explained earlier, for the capacitive humidity sensors, the 
measuring principle is based on the change in the dielectric constant 
of the sensing material in the presence of water. From Table 12.1, it is 
possible to notice that the dielectric constant of water is 80; however, 
for polymers it is under 10. When a porous material with a dielectric

532
Smart Textiles
constant under 10 absorbs water with a dielectric constant of 80, 
the dielectric constant of the porous material increases, directly 
affecting the capacitance of the sensor.

The fabrication of the capacitive humidity sensors involves 
using a silver-coated polyamide yarn, which is highly sensitive to 
water around two insulated copper wires. The two parallel copper 
wires are influenced by the water absorption and desorption of the 
polyamide yarn, affecting the capacity of the sensor, as shown in 
Fig. 12.30.
	
The reason to use silver-coated polyamide yarn instead of using 
just polyamide yarn is to minimize the proximity detection of the 
capacitive sensors. By using a conductive yarn twisted around a 
capacitive sensor, it is possible to minimize the detection of human 
touch, acting similar to a faraday cage, being capable of detecting 
the impact of the humidity while minimizing the noise caused by the 
human interaction with the sensors.

533
Figure 12.30 Humidity capacitive sensors, capacitive sensor yarn, and 
validation of the humidity sensors (TexBoost PPS4 AN1).
	
Finally, the temperature sensors used on the seat cover work 
based on the Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) principle. 
An RTD is a passive circuit element whose resistance is greater at 
higher temperatures in a predictable manner. The traditional RTD 
element is constructed from a small coil of platinum, copper, or 
nickel wire wound to a precise resistance value around a ceramic 
or glass bobbin. In this case, the nickel wire was twisted around a 
polyester yarn, providing both the RTD behavior and, at the same 
time, maintaining good mechanical properties. If the nickel wire was 
integrated directly on the textile structure, it would break during the 
embroidery process. The performance of the sensor was compared 
with a commercial sensor, as shown in Fig. 12.31. With this test, it 
Smart Textiles Applications

534

was possible to conclude that the sensor can be integrated in textile 
structures by conventional textile fabrication processes while 
presenting a good sensitivity to a temperature between 20 and 90°C.
Figure 12.31 Temperature-resistive sensors, resistive sensor yarn, and 
validation of the temperature sensors (TexBoost PPS4 AN1).
12.4.4 Energy
Within the scope of the energy sector, CeNTI collaborated in the EU-
funded POWERWEAVE (development of textiles for electrical energy 
generation and storage) project, which included the development 
of novel fibrous materials to harvest sunlight and store electrical 
energy. The technology combines photovoltaic fibers based on dye-
sensitized solar cell technology and rechargeable energy-storage 
fibers, exploiting thin-film battery or supercapacitor technology. 

535
Fibers are knitted or woven together into a photovoltaic textile. 
Project partners developed and applied fiber spinning and coating 
methods ahead of integrating the two fibers into a textile. The lack 
of stable photovoltaic and storage fibers for conversion into fabric 
prevented them from fully achieving their initial objective of a solar-
generating and energy-storing remote power supply. The fiber-based 
technology has several significant benefits and innovations that set 
it apart from traditional solar and energy-storage alternatives. It is 
adaptable and bendable, weighs much less than conventional solar 
cells and batteries, can be stored and transported easily, and does 
not require installation.
	
Concerning energy-storage fibers, fiber-based supercapacitors 
were developed (Fig. 12.32), where the coaxial single-fiber 
supercapacitors consist of five layers. The central metal fiber and the 
outer layer of silver coating are current collectors. Two active layers 
made of Chinese ink are separated by a gel electrolyte layer and 
served as electrodes. The energy is stored by the accumulation of 
electrical charges at the boundary layers between the two electrodes 
and electrolyte.

The electrochemical performance of the developed energy-
storage fibers was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic 
charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. 
A CV test is carried out by applying a positive (charging) voltage 
sweeping dV⁄dt (scan rate) in a specific voltage range and then 
reversing (discharging) the voltage sweep polarity immediately 
after the maximum voltage range is achieved. The electrochemical 
behavior of a supercapacitor could be evaluated based on the 
corresponding current response against the applied voltage by the 
equations as:

Smart Textiles
	
C
Q
V
=
total/ 2
D
	
(12.1)
	
CL = C/L	
(12.2)
	
C is the capacitance, and C/L is the specific capacitance per unit 
length. Qtotal is the supercapacitor’s charge in coulombs. The charge 
is automatically calculated by the workstation software. L is the 
length of the fiber supercapacitors.
	
The capacitance and specific capacitance per unit length 
calculated by Eqs. (12.1) and (12.2) were 18 mF and 0.5 mF/cm. 
These results demonstrated that this kind of energy-storage fibers 
is functional, although the capacitance was not ideal. In addition, the 
CV curves were the same when the fiber supercapacitor was bent 
using the glass rods with the diameters of 1.5 cm and 3.0 cm. When 
the fiber supercapacitor was bent on the glass rod with the diameter 
of 10.5 cm, the specific capacitance decreased slightly to 32.2 mF/cm, 
which was about 93% of the original sample without bending. When 
the diameter of rods decreased to 3.0 cm and 1.5 cm, the specific 
capacitance changed to 26.2 mF/cm for both cases, which was 76% 
of the original sample without bending. These results show that the 
fiber supercapacitors can work at the severe bending condition, 
indicating that the fiber supercapacitors are flexible enough to be 
woven into other fabrics to make smart textiles.
	
Therefore, it can be noticed that the developed fibers can be woven 
into a fabric, which would act as a standalone power supply. The 
fabric would harvest and store electrical energy from the sun within 
its fibrous matrix. It is an easily deformable, storable, lightweight, 
and transportable power supply. This solution was achieved through 
the development of photovoltaic and energy-storage fibers directly 
integrated into a textile along with the respective control electronics. 
This unique approach, moving on from the current state of the art 
using rigid cell or film-based PV materials and rigid bulky batteries, 
allows the development of large-area deformable products, including 
agricultural shading, automotive soft-tops, building facades, rollable 
shades, curtains and roofing, aerospace fabrics, and outdoor goods. 
Rigid photovoltaic devices can now be seen on rooftops and solar 
farms around the world. Flexible fabrics that do the same work 
could easily exploit the exact places where the sun is most intense, 
and shade is desirable.

537
12.4.5 Lighting Applications
Electroluminescent displays are the most common and well-
established light-emitting technology for printed electronics. The 
fundamental principle behind their operation is based on the emission 
of light due to the passage of a high-voltage AC power through a 
phosphor layer. In short, the structure of electroluminescent devices 
can be divided in four distinct layers (see Fig. 12.33): (1) transparent 
conductive layer, (2) electroluminescent layer, (3) dielectric layer, and 
(4) conductive layer. As already mentioned, the electroluminescent 
layer is responsible for emitting the light, whereas the dielectric 
layer grants the necessary insulation to provide sufficiently high 
electric fields that increase the brightness and reliability of the 
display. Since the electroluminescent device is designed in a layer-
by-layer structure, each requiring a different type of functional ink, 
it is necessary to guarantee the compatibility between inks, as well 
as the uniformity and conformity of each layer during the respective 
printing step.
Figure 12.33 Schematic of the printing layers that an electroluminescent 
display comprises.
	
The production of printed electroluminescent devices is 
particularly benefited by the characteristics of screen-printing 
techniques, mostly due to the high throughput that can be 
achieved even for large-area solutions. In addition, the nature 
of screen-printing techniques offers the possibility of producing 
electroluminescent devices in several types of substrates, either 
Smart Textiles Applications

538
Smart Textiles
rigid or flexible. Therefore, this broadens the spectrum of materials 
where these light-emitting devices can be printed, ranging from 
polymeric films to fabric-based substrates.
	
Particularly, the selected substrate imposes characteristics 
that must be addressed when producing the electroluminescent 
structure. The rugosity of its surface is one of the aspects that must 
be considered since it directly affects the printing quality and, 
therefore, the functionality of the electroluminescent. By referring to 
smart textile applications, fabric-based substrates typically require 
an interface layer to provide the necessary surface smoothness for 
direct printing and improve the device’s performance. Additionally, 
the optical transparency of the substrate dictates the order at which 
the layers must be printed: for substrates with high transparency, the 
transparent conductive ink is first printed, and the remaining layers 
follow as described before, whereas for opaque substrates—such as 
textiles—this order is inverted. An example of a textile application is 
presented in Fig. 12.34.
Figure 12.34 An electroluminescent display printed onto a textile substrate 
with an interface layer.
	
As 
discussed 
earlier, 
other 
approaches 
to 
integrate 
electroluminescent displays on textile substrates can also be 
considered, for example by first printing on a polymeric substrate 
and then laminating it on the fabric. Either way, smart textiles with 
customized lighting solutions can be easily produced by printing 
techniques, without compromising the flexibility, weight, or 
breathability of the fabric.

539
12.5 Future Perspective
The field of smart textiles is evolving and emerging as a reality, 
from wearables and car interior surfaces to home textiles, with 
different applications reaching the market. Smart textiles stand out 
as products of high technological value and impact in the market, 
justifying the continuous growth and differentiation of the textile 
industry in the development and innovation of such products. 
Current markets such as protection and defense, sports and fitness, 
industrial applications, and medical and healthcare exhibit a great 
potential for new solutions with cross-sectoral value, supporting the 
efforts that technological entities and industries are employing in 
bringing new solutions and surpass the challenges of this field.
	
Nevertheless, smart textile application and consolidation in 
the market requires further efforts and developments to solve the 
key issue of industrial manufacturing of end-use smart textile-
based solutions. In addition, current smart textile developments 
exhibit fragile interconnections that compromise the durability and 
upscaling of these devices. Therefore, only through the application of 
printed electronics, functional fibers and yarns, smart systems and 
customized integration processes, it is possible to achieve disruptive 
textile-based products with added functionalities, from wearable 
textile sensors to flexible actuation and interface systems.
	
The integration of printed electronics presents an excellent 
solution to add functionality to traditional textile structures, from 
woven to knitted fabrics, without compromising their intrinsic 
properties, namely lightness, adaptability, and conformability. 
Throughout the years, the expertise in this field has increased 
through the application and development of several different 
functional inks, ranging from conductive-based inks to dielectric, 
phosphorescent, piezoelectric, or thermoelectric-based inks, 
allowing the development of different printed devices capable 
of adding disruptive functionalities to textiles. Within these 
functionalities, it is possible to highlight smart textile solutions 
with embedded sensors, actuators, energy harvesting, haptic 
feedback, and light and thermal outputs. Moreover, the generation 
of smart textiles is not only limited to the application of printed 
electronics, since the development of non-conventional fibers with 
multifunctionality, ranging from fiber-based sensors, actuators, and 
Future Perspective

540
Smart Textiles
even textile energy harvesters, complemented with the application of 
smart materials, allows the development of completely textile-based 
solutions with added functionalities. The technological transfer of 
all these solutions to the textile industry is ultimately the main goal, 
which will always imply a profound study from an early stage of the 
materials and processes to be used in the devices to ensure that they 
comply with the high standards and specifications of the different 
textile sectors.
	
In conclusion, the future of technology will indeed include 
lightweight and flexible solutions, thus increasing the continuous 
demand for smart textile-based products and creating the need 
for novel advanced equipment and specialized human resources to 
support this sector. To achieve that, a strong collaboration of all the 
involved parts, namely technology developers, industry innovators, 
and end-market experts, plays an important key to enable an efficient 
growth and implementation of this disruptive field.

Circularity and Environmental Sustainability of Organic and Printed Electronics
	
First, it is essential, and as a driver to this chapter, to highlight 
some consequences of the current global system of production 
and consumption for electronics. The electronics industry 
and its resource-intensive activities are generating significant 
environmental impacts during the production, use, and disposal of 
the devices. Concerning this latest phase, electrical and electronics 
products are now known as the fastest growing solid waste stream. 
Around 50 million tonnes of electronics waste (e-waste) are 
generated globally every year. More precisely and according to the 
latest global e-waste monitor report, the production of e-waste 
in 2019 was around 53.6 million tonnes; in which, 17.4% were 
properly collected and recycled, and the remaining 82.6% were 
not accounted. For raising awareness about this figure, the authors 
made an indicative comparison showing that this amount of e-waste 
generated every year is equivalent to the weight of 5000 Eiffel 
Towers. The same report forecasts this generation of e-waste to be 
74.7 million tonnes by 2030 (Parajuly et al., 2019). Reflecting the 
consequences of the current linear “take-make-dispose” model, this 
exponential and further expected growth has even been referred by 
the United Nations as the tsunami of e-waste.
	
Nevertheless, it is not only these weights that are concerning. 
Due to their significant energy consumption and longer lifetime, 
environmental profiles of first household appliances mostly 
showed that the use phase is the main contributor to the life cycle 
environmental impacts of an electrical and electronic product. 
Today’s technological advancement and associated increased use 
of resources show an evolution of the dominating phase in such 
environmental profiles. For instance, for a smartphone, the production 
phase has a major impact on the total greenhouse gas emissions of 
such an electronic device’s entire life cycle. This share of greenhouse 
gas emissions can largely be attributed to the resource extraction 
and processing, component (part) manufacturing and assembly 
processes as well as device tests. The production of display modules, 
printed circuit boards, and integrated circuits is indeed highly energy 
intensive. The manufacturing of chips and semiconductors also 
uses a variety of chemicals, including volatile organic compounds. 
Mining and processing of ores are a major source of pollution and 
environmental degradation, but it is also known that the extraction 
of these primary raw materials is often associated with human rights

Introduction
risks. The toxicants used during processing (as intermediate inputs) 
can also be a source of high environmental impacts. For example, 
fluorinated greenhouse gases, used in manufacturing LCD flat-panel 
displays, involve chemicals with atmospheric lifetimes beyond 
3000 years and thousands of times more global warming potential1 
than CO₂. Finally, the improper disposal and handling of electronic 
wastes has resulted in a significant loss of scarce and valuable raw 
materials, including such precious metals as neodymium, indium, 
and cobalt. Moreover, as these wastes contain toxic and hazardous 
substances such as mercury, brominated flame retardants (BFR), or 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), it is also a source of high environmental 
concerns (i.e., air, water, soil pollution) and poses severe risks to 
human health.
	
In view of these severe global consequences, there is an urgent 
need to collaboratively rethink entire production and consumption 
systems. Product design is a critical enabler. It has been estimated 
that about 80% of a product’s environmental impacts are already 
determined during the design stage (European Commission, 2014). 
The integration of environmental considerations at an early phase 
of a product development process, thus, appears as an essential 
approach for enhancing the environmental performance across a 
product life cycle. In that perspective, recent emphasis has been given 
by key global stakeholders on designing sustainable electronics. 
In 2019, the European Commission (EC), for instance, released 
the European Green Deal, a new growth strategy that aims “to 
transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, 
resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no 
net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic 
growth is decoupled from resource use” (European Commission, 
2019). In March 2020, and for reaching these objectives, the EC 
released the New Circular Economy Action Plan together with a 
new Industrial Strategy for Europe. As this industrial strategy was 
published one day before the World Health Organization (WHO) 
announced COVID-19 as a pandemic, the EC then released an 
updated version, ensuring that its industrial ambition takes full 
account of the new circumstances following the COVID-19 crisis. 
1The global warming potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the 
global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much 
energy the emission of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative 
to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2).

546
Circularity and Environmental Sustainability of Organic and Printed Electronics
Analyzing the impacts of this crisis on the European economy, the EC 
explains that “digital and green business models and technologies 
placed companies that had already embraced this transition at an 
advantage compared to those that had not and companies that drive 
the change will continue to enjoy a crucial first-mover advantage” 
(European Commission, 2021). Reaffirming the priorities set in 
March 2020’s Communications, the EC has, therefore, proposed 
new measures for boosting the recovery, strengthening the single 
market resilience, dealing with the EU’s strategic dependencies, and 
supporting the business case for these green and digital transitions. 
In these interlinked European strategies and resulting initiatives, 
the role of the electronics industry in building up a more circular 
economy and reaching climate objectives is clearly highlighted. 
The New Circular Economy Action Plan, targeting sectors that use 
most resources and where the potential for circularity is high, truly 
announced interrelated initiatives such as the Sustainable Products 
Initiative and Circular Electronics Initiative. These initiatives will 
introduce legislative and non-legislative measures having for 
main ambitions to make sustainable products the norm in the EU. 
Accordingly, in March 2022, a proposal for an updated sustainable 
products initiative was adopted. This proposal extends the scope of 
the existing ecodesign regulatory framework to cover the broadest 
possible range of products. It foresees setting minimum criteria 
not only for energy efficiency but also for circularity and an overall 
reduction in the environmental and climate footprint of products. 
In China, “green” products and the development of a “green” market 
have also become an increasingly important issue. Improvement 
in green design policies, guidelines, and classification is a key 
element of the Development Plan for the Circular Economy in the 
14th Five-Year Plan Period, released on July 2021 by the Chinese 
National Development and Reform Commission (Briefing, 2021). 
In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
published its National Recycling Strategy in November 2021, the 
first building block of its circular economy strategy series. As part 
of these additional upcoming strategies, one will be dedicated to 
electronics with the first draft to be publicly released in 2022 (EPA, 
2022). High-level public–private collaborations are also underlining 
this need to act at an early stage. Building on its circular vision 
developed together with the United Nations E-waste Coalition, the 

547
Introduction
Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE) developed a 
Circular Economy Action Agenda for Electronics (PACE and United 
Nations E-waste Coalition, 2019). As part of this collective agenda, 
“incentivise and support product design for circularity” is identified 
as a priority area where business, governments, and civil society 
need to collaborate (PACE, 2021). Following recommendations from 
this agenda, the Circular Electronics Partnership (CEP) has been 
developed. On its launch, the CEP has brought together a group of 
global organizations and started the first private-sector alliance for 
circular electronics. The seven partner organizations2 collaboratively 
developed and launched a Vision for Circular Electronics, a Roadmap 
for Circular Electronics and kick-started five projects responding to 
the Roadmap: one of them focusing on defining what constitutes 
circular products and services (Circular Electronics Partnership, 
2021).
	
Before “discussing the term of “designing sustainable products” 
and how it applies to OPE within the next sections, it is important to 
reintroduce the notion of circularity and transition toward a circular 
economy. While 114 definitions were identified and analyzed by 
researchers (Kirchherr, Reike, and Hekkert, 2017), in this chapter 
the definition proposed by the EC is chosen as representative: “In a 
circular economy, the value of products, materials and resources is 
maintained in the economy for as long as possible, and the generation 
of waste is minimized” (European Commission, 2015). A similar 
definition is shared by the European Environment Agency (EEA) 
that conceptualized it, focusing on different phases in a product’s life 
cycle and the flow of materials and energy throughout it (Fig. 13.1).
	
With this conceptualization, the notion of a circular economy 
is further explained as the implementation of activities such 
as 
ecodesign, 
reuse, 
repair, 
redistribution, 
refurbishment, 
remanufacture, or recycling. Often known as R-strategies or circular 
strategies, these different levels of materials and waste management 
are generally listed and can vary between 3 and 10 depending on the 
source and authors. A list of nine R-strategies, classified along their 
potential for circularity has been, for instance, made by Kirchherr et 
al. and shown in Fig. 13.2.

Shown with the arrow on the left in Fig. 13.2, the “increasing 
circularity”(or transitioning from a linear to a circular economy) 
requires changing the entire system that the society is currently 
living and operating in. Elevated consumption patterns and 
production activities must initiate such a systemic change for 
reaching global and regional climate objectives, as well as for limiting 
the depletion of natural capital and biodiversity loss. Globally, half 
of  all greenhouse gas emissions and 90% of biodiversity loss 
are caused by extracting and processing primary raw materials, 
while the still prevailing linear “take-make-dispose” model of our 
economy leads to significant waste of resources. Systemic change 
means shifting both the function and structure of a system and 
sustaining change overtime. A circular economy thus prioritizes 

549
Introduction
resource efficiency and retaining the value of materials and products 
throughout their entire life cycle (Fig. 13.1), but also requires a focus 
on value-chain actors, citizens, and other socioeconomic aspects. 
This systemic transition can indeed only be made possible through 
multidimensional collaborative innovation: for redesigning business 
models, production processes and products, redefining a clear and 
harmonized regulatory framework for creating a level-playing field, 
and boosting industrial competitiveness as well as for empowering 
citizens in taking an active role.

Reducing 
environmental 
impacts 
and 
improving 
the 
environmental performance of electronics is more than urgent. 
Nevertheless, for increasing circularity and dealing with the global 
e-waste problem, it is important to not address issues in isolation. In 
that perspective and to first obtain a comprehensive understanding, 
the StEP Initiative3 together with the Sustainable Cycles Programme 
hosted by the United Nations University Vice Rectorate (UNU ViE-
SCYCLE) and the International Environmental Technology Centre 
(IETC) looked at this global problem using a more holistic perspective 
and mapped the different elements around six main dimensions 
(see Table 13.1).

The characteristics of OPE field perfectly illustrate the 
elements constituting the technological dimension (Table 13.1). 
OPE technologies offer possibilities to penetrate new markets and 
integrate components and systems on and in novel substrates. As 
now moving from commercialization to mass production, it is 
essential for OPE technologies to not comfort the current global 
e-waste problem, by adding issues to existing ones. It is indeed 
fundamental to anticipate and avoid these potential additional 
issues.
	
Therefore, Section 13.2 will briefly introduce the field of design 
for sustainability, including some environmental impact assessment 
methods. It will then discuss environmental issues potentially 

551
arising with OPE. Section 13.3 will more specifically apply selected 
environmental impact assessment methods to a flexible OPV. Using 
a more systemic perspective, Section 13.4 will then broaden the 
product-centric focus to describe the potential enabling role of OPE 
technologies in solving industrial and societal needs.
13.2 Sustainable Product Design and 
Environmental Impact Assessment of OPE
13.2.1 Overview and Evolution of Design for 
Sustainability
While the importance given to designing sustainable products 
is today extremely high on EU political agenda, the Design for 
Sustainability (DfS) field has significantly developed and evolved 
during the last 30 years. In order to establish a common language 
and facilitate its uptake within the OPE industry, a brief overview is 
given in this section.
	
Several authors recently described this evolution (Ceschin 
and Gaziulusoy, 2016; McAloone and Pigosso, 2017; Bhamra and 
Hernandez, 2021); it has also been summarized in a report for the 
EEA (Duhoux et al., 2022). Most of these authors grant the book 
published by Victor Papanek in 1985 as the seminal work discussing 
the integration of environmental considerations into the engineering 
design area. First, the real adoptions of green attitudes by the industry 
were considered mostly corrective, such as the identification and 
replacement of hazardous substances in a manufacturing process. 
Green design was thus focused on lowering environmental impacts 
through redesigning individual qualities of individual products or 
processes. As industries started to understand that environmental 
impacts were caused not only during manufacturing activities 
(but also, e.g., during raw material extraction, transport), more 
proactive approaches started to be proposed. Authors describing 
this evolution of DfS agree to say that ecodesign was thus born 
around the late 1990s. Reflecting the main difference and strength 
over “green” design, the introduction of life cycle thinking was now 
associated with efforts to increase resource efficiency throughout 
the entire product life cycle. Ecodesign is still the most widely 
Sustainable Product Design and Environmental Impact Assessment of OPE

552
Circularity and Environmental Sustainability of Organic and Printed Electronics
adopted approach within the industry. Following the definition of its 
concept within the literature, in between 1990 and 2010, academics 
and practitioners developed many tools and methods that aimed at 
facilitating the implementation of ecodesign activities. More than 
100 of them were developed in this period. Three of them will be 
slightly more introduced in the next section and applied to a specific 
OPE technology. It was also the period in which the first product (or 
waste)-related policies such as the Ecodesign framework, WEEE, or 
RoHS Directive were proposed (Table 13.1).
	
Notwithstanding, the authors describing this evolution of DfS 
explain that toward 2010, the actual implementation of ecodesign 
within the industry was quite low. Therefore, the research community 
has started to extend the boundaries of engineering product design 
into new areas. It has indeed gradually been understood that 
environmental gains achieved through resource efficiency at a 
product level can be directly and indirectly counteracted with the 
rebound effect, an increase in consumption levels. Around that time, 
the concept of sustainable product–service system was born. The 
idea behind these systems is to provide users and consumers with 
the utility they want to satisfy their needs, but with fewer physical 
products, relying more on services and alternative ways of using 
products but without the consumer owning them.
	
Limitations have also been observed in the implementation of 
these product–service systems. Several authors explain that the 
current “lock-in” in linear production and consumption systems 
do not favor their wider adoptions. Consequently, entire system 
innovations and transitions, such as the transition toward a circular 
economy, are today the new perspectives of the design research 
community. They focus on more holistic approaches and require 
increased value-chain collaborations.
	
While today’s engineering design research still perceive 
sustainability as a technical issue, this evolution of DfS has been 
conceptualized by Ceschin and Gaziulusoy, and graphically modified 
in the report for the EEA. Figure 13.3 shows that DfS as a discipline 
first had a technical and product-centric focus, with first green 
design and ecodesign approaches. The field is now evolving toward a 
focus on large-scale system-level changes, taking into consideration 
both production and consumption systems, showing that this 
latest evolution requires many more disciplines than engineering 

553
design. There again it is emphasized through the linkages that it is 
well the combination of innovation at all levels (product, company, 
sector, society, city) that will lead to envisioning future circular and 
sustainable systems.

Assessment Methods
As mentioned earlier, many tools and methods were developed 
and are still being developed to support the implementation of

DfS activities. They are indeed necessary to inform and guide the 
decision-making process that aims at improving the environmental 
performance of products and services. They can be classified along 
different categories, whether they refer to quantitative, semi-
quantitative assessment tools, checklists, or guidelines. They actually 
vary according to their evaluation and recommendation level and 
are targeting different users (environmental experts, politicians, 
industrial designers, etc.) and levels (product, operational, 
managerial, etc.). Potentially new environmental issues can appear 
with the emergence of OPE technologies, and they will be described 
in Section 13.2.3. Based on the actual development and penetration 
of these technologies, it is, therefore, first essential to understand 
these potential environmental impacts and eventual risks. For 
that, three existing environmental impact assessment methods are 
selected and introduced in this section. They will then be applied to 
a case of flexible OPV in Section 13.3.
13.2.2.1 Life cycle assessment
Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a methodology that assesses the 
environmental impacts of a product, process, or system over its 
entire life cycle (from cradle to grave). The general LCA methodology 
is extensively described in different guidelines, such as ISO 14040/44 
guidelines, International Reference Life Cycle Data System Handbook, 
and the Product Environmental Footprint method.
	
According to all relevant guidelines, an LCA must be performed 
in four steps:
 
1. Goal and scope definition: Definition of goal of study, 
functional unit, system boundaries, and modeling choices.
 
2. Life cycle inventory (LCI): Data collection and data 
calculation.
 
3. Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA): Inventory results are 
converted to a number of environmental themes, such as 
climate change, ozone depletion, toxicity, etc.
 
4. Interpretation: Interpretation of results, hotspot analysis, 
robustness of results, and conclusions and recommendations.
	
The relation between the different phases is illustrated in 
Fig. 13.4, and a brief introduction to the different phases is, therefore, 
given below.

guidelines.
Phase 1: In the goal and scope definition phase, the aim of an LCA 
must be defined and central assumptions and system choices have 
to be taken. The goal and scope can be addressed by answering a 
number of questions, including:
 
∑	 What kind of product shall be assessed?
 
∑	 Shall it be compared to similar products or is it a single 
product assessment?
 
∑	 What is the function of the product? Does it have the same 
function as the similar product but perform in a completely 
different way?
 
∑	 What environmental issues are of concern for society?
	
The functional unit is the basis for the LCI; it is referred in the 
ISO Standard as the “quantified performance of a product system 
as a reference unit” (ISO, 2006) and is, thus, the reference for the 
normalization of input and output data. The system boundaries 
define which unit processes and which parts of the life cycle should 
be included in the study, as well as how far up the supply chain is 
modeled. Comparative studies might allow to exclude specific 
processes or life cycle phases.
Phase 2: The life cycle inventory (LCI) is the quantification of 
relevant inputs and outputs for a given product system throughout 
Sustainable Product Design and Environmental Impact Assessment of OPE

556
Circularity and Environmental Sustainability of Organic and Printed Electronics
its entire life cycle. It involves gathering data on the emissions into 
the environment and burdens associated with the products and 
processes. As mentioned before, only the processes within the 
system boundary are considered.
	
A process consists of input materials, energy flows, the product 
and nonproduct output composed of waste, and emissions to water, 
air, and soil. The smallest unit is the so-called unit process. For 
simple macrolevel studies, there may be only a few unit processes, 
for example, a factory transportation and disposal of a product; 
for complex studies, there may be several unit processes such as 
a production step cascade. In this phase, process flow diagrams 
are developed, a data collection strategy is foreseen, and then 
implemented for collecting data. Collecting inventory data is often 
the most time-consuming task of an LCA. It is common practice to 
use established LCA software tools and databases (that have been 
built up for many unit processes and materials already) for gathering 
data and modeling the system.
Phase 3: The life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) is the process of 
assessing the environmental impacts attributable to a product under 
study using the input data from the LCI. The LCIA itself consists of 
different steps:
 
∑	 Selection, i.e., selecting which characterization model(s), 
impact category (or categories), and category indicator(s) to 
be adopted in the study;
 
∑	 Classification, i.e., assigning LCI results to the chosen impact 
categories; and characterization, i.e., estimating the category 
indicator result (also referred to as LCIA result) for the chosen 
impact category. The category indicator result is the product 
of relevant LCI results and pre-defined characterization 
factors.
	
In the LCIA, materials and energy resource data, as well as 
waste and emission data, are therefore linked to impact category 
indicators. This calculation is based on modeled factors, so-called 
characterization factors, which represent the predicted contribution 
to an impact per unit emission or resource consumption. In 
Fig. 13.5, the translation steps from emissions to category indicators 
are explained by means of selected airborne emissions.

557
Figure 13.5 In LCIA, emissions such as methane are assigned to the greenhouse 
effect classification. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) have different environmental effects 
and must be assigned to the respective classes using fate models. The potential 
emission effect is characterized in relation to a leading substance. For instance, 
the same amount of methane (CH4) has a 21 times higher greenhouse gas 
potential than the leading substance carbon dioxide.
	
The determination of the category indicators for toxic 
substances, such as heavy metals, dust, and organic chemicals, as 
well as resource scarcity, follows similar rules. The final LCIA results 
are calculated by multiplication of each characterization factor 
with the emission amount. Category indicators are science based, 
have relatively small uncertainties, and allow for the comparison of 
benefits and losses of two products in different impact categories. 
Many LCIA methodologies have been developed to support the LCIA 
main steps. The characterization models embedded in these LCIA 
methodologies convert relevant environmental interventions into 
category indicators at a point close to the middle or the end of the 
environmental mechanism defined for a particular impact category. 
As such, the LCIA methodologies are commonly referred to as 
midpoint or endpoint approaches. Midpoint approaches look at the 
result in the short term (e.g., climate change assesses the increase 
in radiative forcing in carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent over a period 
of 100  years), while endpoint approaches estimate the eventual 
result of the environmental impact (e.g., human life lost and species 
extinct). A non-exhaustive list of these methods is provided below:

∑	 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
greenhouse gas: The characterization of different gaseous 
emissions according to their global warming potential as 
well as the aggregation of different emissions in the impact 
category “climate change” is one of the most widely used 
methods in LCIA. Three emission categories are distinguished 
with different characterization factors:
	
a.	 Direct emissions of greenhouse gases
	
b.	 Emissions due to deforestation
	
c.	 Biogenic CO2 emissions. The characterization factor of 
biogenic CO2 and CO emissions is zero. Biogenic methane 
emissions have the same factor as fossil methane 
emissions.
 
∑	 Cumulative energy demand (CED) aims to assess the energy 
consumption throughout the life cycle of a product or process. 
This includes the direct applications as well as the indirect 
or gray energy consumption due to the use of, for example, 
construction materials or raw materials. CED values can be 
used to compare the results of a detailed LCA study to others 
in which only primary energy demand is reported. Finally, 
CED results can be used for reliability checks because it is 
easy to judge on the basis of CED comparisons whether major 
errors were done.
 
∑	 Energy payback time (EPBT) is the time span in which 
a PV module or power plant produces as much power as it 
consumed to produce it. It can be calculated from the CED 
and a standard solar irradiation in cradle-to-gate LCA or the 
CED and effective solar irradiation of the dispatch region in a 
cradle-to-grave LCA.
 
∑	 ReCiPe (terrestrial acidification): Acidifying substances 
such as ammonia, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide are 
typically airborne and potentially damage ecosystems (e.g., 
forest decline) if deposited by atmospheric processes to the 
ground.
 
∑	 USEtox (human toxicity, carcinogenicity): The model 
behind the human toxicity indicator reflects the damage to 
human health in life lost and health effects caused by the 
intake of toxic substances such as heavy metals, halogenated 
hydrocarbons, and others by air inhalation and ingestion.

559
 
∑	 USEtox (ecotoxicity): The model behind the ecotoxicity 
indicator reflects the damage to ecosystem by change in the 
potentially affected fraction of species due to a change in the 
concentration of toxic substances.
 
∑	 ReCiPe (photochemical oxidant formation): This indicator 
is used for tropospheric ozone formation, also known as 
summer smog. It is formed in the presence of volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides 
under solar radiation.
 
∑	 CML (ozone depletion): This indicator reflects the depletion 
of the ozone cap caused from halogenated hydrocarbon 
and chlorofluorocarbon concentrations in the stratosphere. 
The resulting increased level of UV-B radiation has effects 
on ecosystem and productivity (e.g., wood, fish, and crop 
production) and human health (e.g., skin cancer). The World 
Meteorological Organization (WMO) reports the ozone 
depletion potential of the relevant substances.
 
∑	 ReCiPe (metal depletion): This cost-based indicator reflects 
the consequences of the depletion of nonrenewable resources 
such as metal-containing minerals.
	
Converting midpoints to endpoints simplifies the interpretation 
of the LCIA results. However, with each aggregation step, uncertainty 
in the results increases. This step is often considered controversial 
as weights and normalization can be given with values depending 
on subjective cultural perspectives. As a concrete example, one of 
the mostly used LCIA methods is ReCiPe. The ReCiPe methodology 
summarizes 18 scientific-based midpoint indicators to the three 
endpoint categories: (1) damage to human health, (2) damage 
to ecosystem diversity, and (3) damage to resource availability. 
Figure 13.6, developed in a publication from the National Institute 
for Public Health and the Environment in Netherlands (RIVM), 
provides an overview of the structure of ReCiPe.
	
A caveat: The ReCiPe methodology does not consider uranium 
as an energetic resource and radioactive waste. Therefore, in an LCA 
with the possible goal to compare electricity from nuclear energy 
with PV electricity, the sensitivity of the results must be checked 
with other endpoint indicators such as the “Swiss methodology for 
environmental scarcity.” The latter weighting system is oriented on 
Sustainable Product Design and Environmental Impact Assessment of OPE

560
Circularity and Environmental Sustainability of Organic and Printed Electronics
the Swiss environmental legislation. Therefore, all applied methods 
must be screened to properly account for the relevant emissions of 
all systems investigated.
Figure 13.6 Structure of the ReCiPe LCIA methodology described in a 
publication from RIVM (Huijbregts et al., 2017).
Phase 4: Throughout an LCA, it is necessary to review and, if 
appropriate, revise the scope of the study by considering the results 
emerging from the inventory analysis and impact assessment. This 
process, interpretation, is iterative and might, for example, identify 
data-quality issues such as data gaps, which need to be closed. 
Generally, this activity would already form part of the initial goal 
and scope definition phase. The procedure typically involves the 

561
examination of the sensitivity of results, performance of a scenario 
analysis, a review of data quality, and a comparison of the results 
with the original goals of the study.
13.2.2.2 Fate studies
For investigating the environmental impact of a product such as an 
electrical and electronic equipment, it is of utmost importance to 
carry out so-called fate studies. These studies cover the potential 
pollutants that might be emitted from the product and under which 
scenario and to what extent they are emitted. Furthermore, it is of 
interest to know how such pollutants behave in the environment, 
which chemical/biological transformation reactions they undergo, 
and to which environmental compartment they partition. For 
instance, one may study to which extent silver is released from an 
electrode during use or at the end of life. In the environment, silver 
might undergo further reactions due to exposure to chemicals. 
The chemical state of silver, the so-called speciation, eventually 
determines the effect silver has on the environment. For instance, 
silver might be transported by surface water, adsorbed by soil and 
sediments, or taken up by organisms. This elucidation of predicted 
environmental concentrations (PECs), speciation, and partitioning 
pathways is the basis to reveal ecotoxic effects.
13.2.2.3 Ecotoxicity studies
Ecotoxicology is a research field in which the effect of anthropogenic 
compounds on the living environment is investigated. The research 
sets its focus on a compound’s possible adverse effects in relation 
to its environmental abundance and concentration. The aim is to 
determine its effects on molecular, cellular, organism, and population 
levels to foresee possible risks and prevent them. Most of the 
products used in everyday life lack an ecotoxicological assessment. 
Especially data on chronic effects are missing. Once products or their 
leaching compounds enter the environment (aquatic, terrestrial, 
or air), their chemical behavior there is crucial in determining 
adverse effects. Persistence in the environment, toxic activity, and 
potential of accumulation through the food web are some alarming

ecosystems. The biological response related to exposure of 
environmental chemicals is measured by one or several sensitive 
indicators of toxic effects, the so-called biomarkers. Most biomarkers 
are based on alterations in biochemical parameters (e.g., enzyme 
activity, hormones in blood, specific protein levels) or cytological 
or histological abnormalities (e.g., chromosome aberrations, 
micronuclei, imposex). Recent advances in molecular biology have 
promoted biomarkers based on the analysis of transcription of 
stress-related genes, the so-called gene expression analysis.
	
At the molecular level, the presence of a toxicant triggers a 
response, which starts with a receptor detecting the presence of 
the toxicant (e.g., hormone, metal). The receptor becomes activated 
and binds to specific DNA sequences in the cell nucleus. The DNA 
sequence upstream is then transcribed to so-called messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA), which is then exported to the cell cytoplasm. 
There, its information is translated to synthesize proteins, helping to 
readjust the cells metabolism. Gene expression biomarkers assess 
the amount of transcribed mRNA of certain target genes.
	
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is extracted from small individuals, 
tissues, or cell lines and quantified by polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR). In the PCR approach, target DNA is detected at the end of 
the analysis, whereas by using devices able to monitor the process 
of PCR in real time (quantitative real-time PCR, or qRT-PCR), the 
target DNA is detected and quantified simultaneously. qRT-PCR 
is more precise and reproducible and allows processing of a large 
number of samples. For relative quantification, the target gene is 
compared to an internal reference gene, which is equally expressed 
in both toxicant-affected and nonaffected cells. The expressions of 
target genes from toxicant-affected cells are then presented as fold 
change of control samples. As gene quantification data from qRT-
PCR are derived from rations of exponential functions, the data are 
not normally distributed. Therefore, the data need to be normalized 
(e.g., logarithmic transformation) before statistical analysis (e.g., 
ANOVA, Student’s T-test) can be conducted.
	
Bioimaging of metals in tissue sections or whole organisms 
by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 
(LA-ICP-MS) is an elegant technique but still in its infancy. It gains 
increasing importance not only to visualize uptake and spatial 
distribution in metal-exposed organisms but also to study metals 

563
and metalloproteins playing a major role in organ function. In this 
technique, a focused laser beam ablates 5–100 µm wide sections 
of a biological sample while ICP mass spectra of the ablated 
material are recorded continuously. It can be used for single-point 
measurements to investigate concentration profiles in depth or line 
scan measurements for 2D imaging. Samples are mostly prepared as 
cryosections or paraffin sections mounted on a glass slide.
13.2.3 Potential Environmental Issues Related to OPE
OPE may contribute to mitigating some environmental burdens 
of conventional electronic products. For instance, the dependency 
on rare metals might be minimized by substitution with organic 
components. Energy demand for vacuum evaporation processes 
might be lessened using R2R printing. However, new technologies 
entail new risks and unexpected environmental impacts. Some of 
these risks and impacts are qualitatively described in this section. 
In order to gain some quantitative insights on these impacts, the 
three environmental impacts assessment methods described in 
the previous section are applied to a specific OPE technology in 
Section 13.3.
	
New environmental problems may potentially arise in all life 
cycle phases of OPE products. Their relevance will increase with 
rising production volumes of OPE substances in future. Poly(3,4-et
hylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) applied 
in touch screens and OLEDs, as well as poly(thiophenes) such as 
poly-(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT), applied in, for example, OPV, 
are examples of organic OPE components. Furthermore, inorganic 
nanosilver formulations allow printing of transparent and very 
fine electrode structures and shall substitute ITO. Despite this, the 
amount (mass) of substances in OPE functional layers is very low 
compared to substrates and encapsulation layers on which they are 
printed. For example, in the case of flexible OPV, over 90% of the 
material share consists of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), also 
widely known as packaging material for mineral water.
	
In the following sections, selected environmental issues 
specific to OPE in the production and the use- and end-of-life 
phases are presented in the context of flexible OPV as technology 
and application case. Section 13.2.3.1 deals with environmental 
Sustainable Product Design and Environmental Impact Assessment of OPE

564

impacts of purchasing bulk chemicals in emerging and development 
countries, Section 13.2.3.2 with the use of solvents and resource 
efficiency in chemical production, Section 13.2.3.3 with potential 
emissions of UV blockers in the use phase, and Section 13.2.3.4 with 
risks arising from unsound disposal practices.
13.2.3.1 Raw material sourcing: Purchasing of bulk chemicals 
from developing countries
European standards for chemical safety are high, but basic bulk 
chemicals—relevant inputs for OPE material synthesis—are 
purchased on the global market. In 2013, the EU-28 countries 
imported around 3.2 million tonnes of organic and inorganic 
chemicals from India and China. In these countries, environmental 
standards are often incomplete or are not enforced sufficiently. 
Therefore, for a sustainable production of OPE, it is essential to 
assess the whole supply chain of chemicals with the associated 
emissions and control measures in place. The common practice 
to trust in environmental standard certificates is, in general, not 
sufficient to guarantee acceptable environmental impacts.
13.2.3.2 Production issues: Use of solvents and resource 
efficiency
Solvents represent the largest share of chemicals that are used in 
both OPE material synthesis and in R2R printing. Typical solvents 
used for reactions, dilutions, purifications, separations, and 
recrystallizations include methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofurane 
(THF), hexane, acetic acid, chloroform, chlorobenzene, and 
difluoromethane. In the production of, for example, active polymers, 
the ratio between reactants and solvent can be up to 1:90 or even 
higher just for one of several synthesis steps. In R2R printing, 
solvents typically used are isopropanol, ethanol, butanol, and water. 
The solvent content of ready-to-print inks can be up to 98%.
	
Many solvents are liquid at room temperature but evaporate 
quickly due to their volatility (VOCs). Emissions of organic 
compounds to air, water, and soil might be harmful. For instance, 
under sunlight and the presence of NOx emitted from traffic, heating, 
and industrial furnaces, summer smog is generated. This so-called 
photochemical ozone formation depends on the type of emitted 

565
solvent (see Section 12.2.2.1). Besides this, chlorinated solvents 
negatively affect air, water, soil, and biota, if released. According 
to GlaxoSmithKline’s solvent selection guide, some of them (e.g., 
chloroform, dichloromethane) must be substituted because an 
environmental, health, and safety regulatory ban applies.
	
The level of environmental protection standards for each 
solvent depends on the classification according to REACH.4 
For transportation, handling, storage, and use in production, 
legal requirements on operational health and safety, incident 
management, emission control, and disposal must be followed—at 
least in the European chemical industry. VOC emissions to air and 
solvent emissions to wastewater must be treated until required limit 
values are fulfilled.
 
Resource efficiency in chemical production is influenced 
by the number of synthesis and purification steps, achieved 
yields, production quantities, and process parameters applied. 
The production volume for OPE substances is small compared to 
other chemicals. Even for large-scale mass production, the annual 
demand for OPE substances would only be in the range of several 
hundred tonnes globally. The low costs of basic chemicals in relation 
to high labor and installation costs as well as the high margins in 
product sales are the decisive factors, making a resource efficiency 
optimization unattractive from a business point of view. As a 
consequence, production yields are lower and material inputs into 
processes are higher than for bulk chemicals. The generated wastes 
will mostly be incinerated since low volumes are not worth being 
recycled. Large companies often operate their own incineration 
plants, and depending on the heat value of the waste, thermic 
recycling is worthwhile.
13.2.3.3 Use phase: UV blocker
During the use phase of OPE, it is of utmost importance that the 
product be safe for handling by consumers. Some potentially harmful 
substances cannot be avoided in OPE, since they are particularly 
crucial for their functionality. Therefore, it has to be ensured that their 
encapsulation is tight and strong enough so that proper handling 
does not lead to the release of any of its components. Furthermore, 
4Regulatory framework for the management of chemicals (REACH), European 
Chemicals Agency, http://echa.europa.eu/home.
Sustainable Product Design and Environmental Impact Assessment of OPE

566
Circularity and Environmental Sustainability of Organic and Printed Electronics
substances that form hazardous decomposition products during fire 
should be avoided, for example, as in some PV cell types applied on 
buildings.
	
Aging processes due to UV irradiation, exposure to pollutants, 
high surface temperatures, hot-cold and dry-wet cycles, and 
mechanical stress and damage might still lead to leaching of certain 
OPE compounds. To prevent UV degradation of OPE active layers, 
UV-absorbing organic chemicals (UV stabilizers) are incorporated 
into encapsulating plastics. Therefore, they may potentially be the 
first compounds being prone to leaching during the use phase. 
For instance, widely used benzotriazole UV stabilizers can lead to 
bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms due to high lipophilicity and 
persistence. The hormonal activity of a series of UV stabilizers was 
tested; for instance, 2-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)benzotriazole 
(UV-P) did not show estrogenicity and androgenicity but significant 
antiandrogenic activity. Furthermore, the effect of UV-P was 
assessed in hatched zebrafish embryos. This UV stabilizer led to 
the induction of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway with 
dose-related induction of genes, which may result in developmental 
and reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity.
	
It should be noted that such effects have been observed at 
concentrations much higher than those occurring in the environment. 
Therefore, the risks of negative effects associated with UV stabilizers 
leaching from OPE seem low. Nevertheless, since long-term chronic 
effects are largely unknown, leaching of UV stabilizers in the OPE 
use phase needs to be avoided.
13.2.3.4 End-of-life disposal: PET and nanotoxicology
New opportunities generated by OPE technologies can also generate 
conflicting issues once the product reaches its end of life. Existing 
waste collection systems might consider such hybrid products 
as contaminants. As a result, OPE materials may be disposed on 
landfills, incinerated, or illegally dumped in some cases. This might 
result in a release of potentially hazardous substances into the 
environment. Organic molecules applied in OPE can be divided 
into polymers and associated chemicals such as plasticizers and 
UV stabilizers. PET, for example, used as encapsulation in OPV, is 
considered to be nonbiodegradable and is eventually disintegrating 
into microparticles. As such, they may be taken up by organisms, 

567
resulting in food chain bioaccumulation or starvation. Phthalates 
used as plasticizers may leach from PET. They were shown to have 
antiandrogenic activity but at concentrations that are above levels 
expected to occur from leaching and weathering of OPE materials.
	
Besides polymers and their additives, nanoparticles might 
be released when OPE materials are landfilled, incinerated, or 
uncontrollably disposed. Current (eco)toxicological data indicate 
that nanoparticles exhibit moderate to low acute toxicity, depending 
on the physicochemical nature, metal composition, and size of 
the particles. So far, ecotoxicological knowledge exists mainly 
on acute toxicity and primarily of fullerenes, CNTs, and metallic 
nanoparticles. Acute toxic effects on aquatic organisms are found 
in the milligram per liter concentration range, with only some 
nanoparticles (i.e., silver nanoparticles) exhibiting adverse effects 
at lower concentrations. Besides acute toxicity, also indirect effects 
via sorption and physical blocking of uptake epithelia were detected. 
For instance, in fish, high concentrations of single-walled CNTs act 
as a respiratory toxicant that irritates the gills. In general, gills are a 
major target organ in fish for many nanoparticles, since the uptake 
takes place there. Nanoparticles may also negatively affect the 
embryonic development of organisms such as fish. The toxicity of 
metallic nanoparticles often originates from the metals released by 
the nanoparticles and not from the nanostructure itself.
	
In conclusion, the present knowledge is not sufficient for a 
comprehensive hazard and risk assessment of nanoparticles used 
in OPE. Current data indicate that potential environmental risks 
mainly stem from silver nanoparticles, which are extensively used 
in inks for printing of OPE. However, concentrations of released 
nanoparticles under current disposal scenarios are expected to be 
much lower than effect concentrations for terrestrial and aquatic 
organisms.
13.3 Environmental Impact Assessment of 
Organic Photovoltaics

practitioners (“end of pipe corrective” approaches), a case study is 
selected in this chapter. In this case study, introduced environmental 
impact assessment methods in Section 12.2.2 are applied to a flexible 
OPV and results are presented. The overall environmental impact of 
selected OPV solution was compared with other PV technologies by 
conducting a comparative LCA. Complementary fate and ecotoxicity 
aspects of new substances developed for OPV and OPE applications 
were studied by means of lab experiments. Here are the learning 
targets for the section:
 
∑	 To understand an application of LCA, fate, and ecotoxicity 
assessment methods to a flexible OPV.
 
∑	 To be able to interpret the results from the environmental 
assessment of OPV.
	
The following description of the selected flexible OPV P3HT:PCBM 
(2.8% efficiency) is, therefore, provided. The OPV material described 
in this case study is a semitransparent, flexible, single-junction 
polymer cell with an efficiency to convert sunlight into electricity 
of 2.8% on an active surface of 60%. For the following LCA, the 
module performance of 30 W/m2 for a lifetime of 20 years (behind 
glass) was assumed. The OPV material is produced in Europe. This 
is relevant as certain emissions related to support processes like 
electricity production might depend on the production location. OPV 
active layers are encapsulated in a transparent PET substrate acting 
as protection against UV light, moisture, and oxygen. The adjacent 
ITO layer (90% In2O3, 10% SnO2) acts as the anode. The active layer 
consists of a nano-ZnO (nZNO) hole-blocking layer, a light-absorbing 
composition of P3HT (electron donor) and fullerenes (6,6)-phenyl-
C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM; electron acceptor), and a 
PEDOT:PSS electron-blocking layer. The structure is finished by a 
silver grid cathode. Altogether, the cell thickness lies below 0.5 mm.
13.3.1 Life Cycle Assessment
The objective of this LCA is to compare established CdTe and 
multisilicon (multi-Si) PV cells with printed flexible OPV on the 
module level. The question whether the environmental impacts of 
OPV modules are higher or lower than those of CdTe and multi-Si 
modules should be answered.

569
	
The flexible OPV [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methylester 
(PCBM):P3HT (2.8% eff.) has been described earlier. The CdTe 
module has an efficiency of 10.9%, performs with 110 W/m2, has a 
lifetime of 30 years, and is produced in Europe. The multi-Si module 
performs with 210 W/m2, has an efficiency of 21%, has a lifetime of 
30 years, and is also produced in Europe. A module consists of 60 
solar cells based on silicium wafers.
	
The functional unit is expressed in relation to 1 kWp of the 
respective system under standard radiation assumptions adjusted 
for different life spans. Any difference in performances at diffuse 
light or high temperature is not considered. A lifetime of an OPV 
module of 2/3 compared with established PV technologies indeed 
requires a normalization step. The selected option is to take account 
of 3/2 OPV area to produce the same amount of electricity during 
the lifetime.
	
The system boundary includes all steps from cradle to gate (see 
Section 13.2.2.1). This cradle-to-gate perspective means that the 
scope of this LCA takes into account the environmental impacts 
from raw material exploitation to the point when the module leaves 
the production facility. A cradle-to-grave LCA will be chosen when 
power-generation technologies with different sources of primary 
energy shall be compared with PV technology, such as thermal 
power plants, wind power plants, etc. Unlike the cradle-to-gate 
LCA, in a cradle-to-grave LCA, all phases of the life cycle are indeed 
considered, which is also the required infrastructure for a PV 
power plant installation, maintenance, and emissions in the phase 
of electricity generation, infrastructure, and emissions of different 
end-of-life scenarios (Fig. 13.7).
	
Theoretically, a full LCA would include all upstream and 
downstream processes associated with the product. In reality, this 
study focusses on identifying the processes that are relevant to 
answer the key questions of the analysis, that is, the ones having 
significant environmental impacts. An appropriate cut-off point has 
to be defined to keep the system manageable: typically, processes 
that contribute to less than 5% of the environmental impact are 
neglected. To not lose information, this must be done very carefully 
and cannot be done on a mass share only. For instance, many OPV 
substances have very low mass shares within a flexible module 
but cannot be neglected, because the production is very complex

and resource intensive. Additionally, in a cradle-to-grave LCA, the 
whole infrastructure of the power plants must be included. For PV 
technologies, this is called the balance of system (BOS), which may 
heavily influence the LCA results. The BOS consists of inverters, 
mounting systems, frames, and electric installations and contributes, 
roughly estimated, about 50% to the environmental impact of PV 
power plants.
Figure 13.7 The life cycle of a power plant with flexible OPV includes the 
production phase with sourcing of the materials and energy, the electricity 
generation, and maintenance in the use-phase and end-of-life scenarios. In this 
cradle-to-gate LCA, on the module level only the production phase is considered 
(boundaries drawn around dotted lines).

571
	
The data for the LCI were provided by Belectric OPV GmbH 
(Nuremberg, Germany) within the Sunflower EU project (http://
sunflower-fp.eu), taken from the literature, the ecoinvent database 
2.1, or are own estimations. The indicators chosen for LCIA are those 
introduced in Section 13.2.2.1.
	
The results of the LCIA on the midpoint level are presented 
in Fig. 13.8. It shows the environmental impact of eight midpoint 
indicators and error bars with a confidential level of 68%. Each 
indicator is normalized to the PV module with the highest impact, 
that is, 100%, and discussed in the following next:
 
∑	 CED: CdTe is around 50% lower than multi-Si (100%). The 
main impact stems from electricity consumption during 
silicium production. OPV has a slightly higher CED than CdTe 
(+15%).
 
∑	 IPCC greenhouse gas emission: OPV has the lowest impact. 
It is around 40% lower than multi-Si (100%) but only 5% 
lower than CdTe. The main impact for multi-Si stems from 
electricity generation with fossil fuels.
 
∑	 CML ozone depletion: CdTe has the lowest impact. It is about 
85% lower than multi-Si (100%) and 15% lower than OPV. 
The main impact for multi-Si stems from vinyl fluoride, which 
is required for cell production.
 
∑	 ReCiPe (photochemical oxidant formation): CdTe is the 
best and has a 35% lower impact than multi-Si (100%). The 
OPV impact is within the statistical variation of multi-Si and 
around 25% higher than CdTe. The main impact for OPV 
stems from silver refinery and that for multi-Si stems from the 
production of tetrafluoroethylene, which is required for cell 
production.
 
∑	 ReCiPe (metal depletion): Multi-Si is the best and has about 
a 55% lower impact than CdTe (100%). The main CdTe impact 
stems from the copper demand. The main OPV impact, which 
is 20% lower than for CdTe, stems from the silver for the 
electrodes.
 
∑	 ReCiPe (terrestrial acidification): All technologies show 
similar results.
 
∑	 USEtox (human toxicity, carcinogenicity): No relevant 
differences were observed due to large statistical variations. 
Environmental Impact Assessment of Organic Photovoltaics

572
Circularity and Environmental Sustainability of Organic and Printed Electronics
The main OPV impact is from the silver refinery for the 
electrode.
 
∑	 USEtox (ecotoxicity): CdTe shows a 30% lower impact than 
multi-Si (100%). The large statistical variations do not show 
a relevant difference between the technologies. The main OPV 
impact is from the silver refinement.
Figure 13.8 The relative environmental impacts (normalized to the highest 
impact technology in the respective category) of the compared PV technologies 
show the lowest impact for OPV in the category “IPCC: Greenhouse gas 
emission.”
	
In summary, the eight midpoint indicators show the tendency 
that multi-Si (21% eff.) has the highest impact in most of the 
assessed categories and CdTe (10.9% eff.) shows the lowest impact. 
The energy demand and emissions related with the production of 
silicium are the main cause for the relatively high environmental 
impact of the multi-Si (21% eff.), even if only half of the area is 
needed to produce the same amount of electricity than with CdTe 
(10.9% eff.). The efficiency of the OPV (2.8% eff.) is one-fourth of 
the efficiency of the CdTe (10.9% eff.) and the lifetime one-third of 
the CdTe. Therefore, the OPV needs a factor 5.5 of the area of CdTe 
to produce the same amount of electricity, which results in the most 
impact categories and a higher environmental impact in production. 

573
For the final decision, an additional indicator on the endpoint level 
is required. As discussed in Section 13.2.2.1, endpoint indicators 
are aggregated from different impact categories. It is important 
to remember that the aggregation is weighted by targets of an 
environmental policy or from cultural perspectives.
	
In Fig. 13.9, the LCIA is presented with the two endpoint 
indicators “ReCipe (H/A) world, total” and “Ecological scarcity 2006, 
total.” With both indicators, CdTe (10.9% eff.) shows the lowest 
impact. For multi-Si (21% eff.) and OPV (2.8% eff.), the “ReCipe 
(H/A) world” indicates about the same environmental impact. 
However, “Ecological scarcity 2006, total” shows that OPV (2.8% eff.) 
has, compared with CdTe (10.9% eff.), a 45% higher and, compared 
with multi-Si (21% eff.), a 30% higher environmental impact. The 
main environmental impact stems from refinement of the silver for 
the electrodes.
Figure 13.9 Both endpoint indicators “ReCiPe (H/A) world, total” and 
“Ecological scarcity 2006, total” show the lowest environmental impact for 
CdTe (10.9% eff.) without considering a future tandem OPV (10% eff.). The 
next generation of OPV will thus be less resource intensive; in which case, both 
endpoint indicators point toward a potential environmental impact reduction 
of up to a factor of 10.
	
The following conclusions for the low-performing flexible OPV 
(2.8% eff.) can be made: Taking into account all results from mid- 
and endpoint indicators, the overall environmental impact of OPV 
is similar to that of multi-Si (21% eff.). The CdTe (10.9% eff.) shows, 
overall, the lowest environmental impact. The main share of the 
environmental impact of OPV stems from the silver refinement. 
Environmental Impact Assessment of Organic Photovoltaics

574
Circularity and Environmental Sustainability of Organic and Printed Electronics
An expected impact of the scarcity of indium is not reflected in 
the applied indicators. The amount of required indium is very low 
compared to the copper demand for coating and contacts in CdTe 
and for the silver demand of electrodes in the flexible OPV.
	
In current research, the performance of OPV will be improved. 
The efficiency of OPV is predicted to increase up to 10% (efficiency 
on the cell level). ITO electrodes will be replaced by silver, and 
fine silver grids with a thickness of several nanometers might 
considerably reduce the amount required for the electrodes. As a 
result, resource savings, less pollutants, and less greenhouse gas 
emissions will further reduce the environmental impact of OPV. 
The predicted reduced environmental impact of a printed flexible 
tandem OPV (10% eff.) in both endpoint indicators (Fig. 12.11) is up 
to a factor 10 compared with a flexible OPV (2.8% eff.) and 5 to 10 
compared with the multi-Si (21% eff.) and CdTe (10.9% eff.). It can 
be expected, even if the production of established PV technologies 
will be more optimized and their efficiencies increase, that printed 
flexible OPV will be one of the greenest PV technology choices in the 
future.
13.3.2 Fate Studies
13.3.2.1 Fate of OPV modules during and after the use phase
At the end of an OPV material’s lifetime, disused cells might face 
different scenarios. OPV materials were shown to be satisfyingly 
stable in accelerated aging experiments as well as under outdoor 
conditions for more than 1 year. When they reach their end of life, 
recycling, incineration (with flue gas treatment), and controlled 
landfilling are considered to be proper disposal strategies. Recycling 
should be preferred, since the vast majority of an OPV material’s 
weight is PET encapsulation, for which recycling processes are 
already well established. On the other hand, inadequate disposal via 
uncontrolled landfilling or uncontrolled burning might occur.
	
In the European Union, the treatment of electrical and 
electronic waste at the end of their life cycle is regulated by the 
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive. Since August 
13, 2012, the recast WEEE provides a legislative framework for 
extended producer responsibility (EPR) of PV modules at European 

575
scale. Henceforth, PV components will be included in the electronic 
waste management system and must be collected and recycled 
by the original producers of the solar components. This EPR also 
includes the fact that end consumers must not pay additional costs 
at the moment of disposal. Furthermore, since precious metals are 
contained in PV cells, the development of appropriate recycling 
methods will be driven by a financial incentive, especially when 
produced on a large scale. However, recycling of OPV materials 
may require organic solvents to separate single components, which 
might themselves be of environmental concern. Since, so far, such a 
recycling strategy does not exist, nowadays controlled incineration 
of OPV materials in state-of-the-art incineration plants is assumed 
to be the best solution. Like this, not only metals might be recovered, 
but the energy bound in plastic chemical bonds can be thermally 
recovered, generating electricity and heat. Nevertheless, in places 
where disposal infrastructure is not yet fully established, OPV-
based products might encounter improper disposal. In uncontrolled 
landfilling, for instance, OPV materials would be exposed to 
harsh environmental conditions such as UV radiation, water, high 
temperatures, and chemicals. When PET is incinerated, a variety 
of toxic substances can be formed in the airborne soot as well as 
residue ash, for example, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 
heavy metals.
	
One major aspect is UV radiation, which leads to aging of OPV 
materials by causing photo-oxidation and yellowing of organic 
polymers. Aging of the encapsulation can result in loss of flexibility, 
crack formation, and delamination, which finally leads to emission 
of OPV components. Moreover, since plastic encapsulation is not 
entirely impermeable for oxygen and water, ambient humidity 
and oxygen might penetrate OPV materials in low concentrations. 
Mechanical stress during use, while landfilling, or when distributed 
into water systems can result in deterioration of OPV materials. Once 
mechanically damaged or even decomposed to small fragments with 
a large interface exposed to ambient conditions, functional materials 
can be prone to washout.
	
In conclusion, there is a wide variety of factors that might have 
a detrimental effect on the material integrity of OPV, potentially 
leading to cell weathering, aging, degradation, and possible release 
of compounds into the environment.

13.3.2.2 Leaching and fate of inorganic OPV compounds to 
the environment
At their end of life, mechanically damaged OPV materials might be 
exposed to rain when still installed on a roof or on a landfill. Further, 
illegally disposed OPV may as well end up via surface water in lakes 
and the sea. Therefore, leaching studies were accomplished in order 
to calculate the PECs of emitted pollutants so that their ecotoxic 
potential can be assessed. In particular, nanosized components 
were of interest due to their still not well-known environmental fate 
and ecotoxic potential (see before). To give an example of another 
field: Outdoor façade paint does often contain TiOx nanoparticles 
as whitening pigment, which can be washed out by rain, ending 
up in wastewater treatment plants or, even worse, in the aquatic 
environment. During wastewater treatment, TiOx is of little concern, 
since about 98% of Ti is removed in the biological treatment 
step through sorption to natural organic matter and subsequent 
sedimentation. However, up to 20 μg/L TiOx nanoparticles (4–
30 nm) were still found in the effluent and finally reach aquatic 
systems such as rivers and lakes. Therefore, first it is important to 
know a pollutant’s PEC (to compare with toxicity data) and second 
to understand the behavior of such particles in the environment 
(to make a prediction on partitioning). The form of such metallic 
leachates has a tremendous effect not only on its toxic potential but 
also on its environmental behavior. Under environmentally relevant 
conditions, the form and aggregation of nanoparticles depend on a 
variety of factors. For instance, acidic pH conditions would stabilize 
ZnO nanoparticles released from OPV materials in monodisperse 
form and natural organic matter can adsorb to ZnO, resulting in 
negative surface charges preventing aggregation. On the other 
hand, divalent cations (e.g., Ca2+) lead to aggregation of particles 
due to charge neutralization, and larger aggregates are not taken 
up and accumulated by organisms to the same extent. In conclusion, 
different factors influence the accumulation and bioavailability 
of nanoparticles and define their fate and toxicity. Sedimentation 
of larger particles or accumulations leads to less availability for 
pelagic organisms compared to benthic organisms. Nanosilver, for 
instance, showed high toxic potential in countless studies (see later). 

577
But recently it has been shown that in sewage systems, nanosilver 
is immediately sulfidized to Ag2S particles (practically insoluble 
in water); thus, the ecotoxic potential under environmentally 
relevant conditions is probably lessened. Examples like these show 
that concentrations (PECs) are not solely important but also the 
pollutant’s speciation.
Figure 13.10 In a rooftop acidic rain runoff scenario, the PEC calculated from 
Cd and Mo leaching from CIGS (green) exceeded WHO drinking water limits by 
far for arid (circles) as well as humid (squares) climate zones, whereas Ag and 
Zn from OPV (red) did not pose any risk to the environment. Reprinted with

For OPV, leaching of metals and metalloids under different 
scenarios was carried out for rooftop runoff (Fig. 13.10). 
Measured metal concentrations in solution were alarming at first 
sight. However, these concentrations strongly depended on the 
experimental setup, that is, the ratio of rain to OPV and experimental 
duration. A more appropriate means to estimate ecotoxic potential 
is by calculating the PEC. For this, the following assumptions were 
made: The amounts of metal(loid)s leaching from different PV cells 
in laboratory experiments were projected to a roof fully covered 
with PV cells and then divided by the amount of rain precipitating 
on this area in the same time span as the experiment for arid and 
humid climate zones. Conclusively, the calculated PEC for OPV did 
not exceed the most restrictive limits, that is, drinking water limits,

as regulated by the WHO. On the other hand, identical leaching 
from CIGS cells showed high concentrations of Se, Mo, and Cd being 
released. In the case of Cd, which is banned from incorporation into 
electronic equipment except for PV, PEC exceeded WHO limits by a 
factor of 58 as well as acutely toxic concentrations for freshwater 
organisms such as Daphnia magna by a factor of 7. Also, PECs for 
Se and Mo were problematic in the context of bioaccumulation or 
toxicity.
	
To distinguish leachates between dissolved and nanoparticulate 
metals, a so-called time-resolved single-particle inductively coupled 
plasma mass spectrometry (TRSP-ICP-MS) method can be applied 
(Fig. 13.11). Briefly, when the metals are in a truly homogeneously 
dissolved state, ionization of the continuously arriving metals in 
the ICP leads to a continuous flow of charged metal ions recorded 
as a constant signal (flat baseline) by the MS detector. On the other 
hand, when nanoparticulate metals are present, single nanoparticles 
will discontinuously arrive in the plasma where ion accumulations 
(clouds) are produced. These are detected as peaks. Like this, in the 
case of OPV, it was shown that except for Zn, the leachate metallic 
compounds are mainly in dissolved form, so potential nanotoxic 
effects can already be excluded from the start.

between dissolved metal ions (top) and nanoparticulate metals (bottom). For

13.3.2.3 Leaching and fate of organic OPV compounds to the 
environment
In comparison to metallic leachates, organic compounds might also 
be released from OPV materials. Especially PCBM is of interest, 
since such fullerene derivatives are increasingly used in industrial 
applications and their behavior and toxic potential are not well 
understood. Recently, pure C60 and C70 buckyballs have been 
detected in surface water and wastewater. Since fullerenes are 
emitted not only from anthropogenic sources but also by burning 
(e.g., forest fires) and volcano eruptions, their origin is often difficult 
to determine. Numerous studies exist about the behavior and 
toxicity of C60, showing that there is a considerable toxic potential 
but strongly depending on its surface conjugation. The pristine C60 
cage itself is highly hydrophobic and stable but becomes surface 
hydroxylated over time under toxic/aqueous conditions. Like 
this, it becomes more polar and easily soluble in water, which can 
result in transportation by surface water instead of sedimentation/
sorption. In consequence, toxicity for pelagic organisms may be 
more important than for benthic species. PCBM investigations 
are, thus, particularly interesting, since the change induced by 
environmental conditions (water, oxygen) might completely change 
its environmental fate and toxicity.
	
In leaching experiments described earlier for metals, no 
PCBM was detected. The main reason might be its persisting high 
hydrophobicity for which it does simply not dissolve in water and is 
not released from OPV materials. To estimate PCBM’s hydrophobicity, 
the so-called log Kow value was determined. It is defined as:
	
log
log
10
10
K
c
c
ow
octanol

=
	
(13.1)
	
The log Kow value of a compound is determined by mixing it 
with octanol (a hydrophobic, non-water-miscible solvent) and 
water before equilibrium concentrations are determined. The 
environmental partitioning of the compounds is strongly related to 
their hydrophobicity, wherefore log Kow is routinely used to predict 
the latter.
	
With highly hydrophobic compounds such as PCBM, however, 
this method is not appropriate since the minute amounts dissolving

580
Circularity and Environmental Sustainability of Organic and Printed Electronics
in water are difficult to determine properly. The log Kow values of 
such highly hydrophobic compounds can be determined by liquid 
chromatography instead (Fig. 13.12). Here, the retention time of 
standard chemicals (with different hydrophobicity and, therefore, 
different log Kow value) is determined on a chromatographic column 
and a linear correlation between retention time and known log Kow 
is calculated. By using PCBM’s retention time in this correlation, a log 
Kow value of about 10.5 was determined, meaning that the amount 
of PCBM dissolving in hydrophobic octanol is 1010.5 (31 billion) 
times larger than in water. From this, it can be concluded that even 
if released from OPV materials, resulting concentrations would be 
extremely low. These minute amounts will then be mainly sorbed 
to organic material. In the long term, PCBM might be hydroxylated 
on the cage surface, which tends to result in a decreased log Kow. 
Carefully concluding from bare C60, which still has a log Kow >6.5 
after 13 days of exposition to water, one would still expect aqueous 
concentrations of fully hydroxylated PCBM to be very low.
Figure 13.12 Investigation of the log Kow value of PCBM contained in OPV 
materials. From standard chemicals such as aniline or DDT with a known log 
Kow, the log Kow for PCBM is extrapolated.

581
13.3.3 Ecotoxicity Studies
Regarding OPE materials, some of the components are fairly new 
and need to be investigated for their ecotoxic potential in order to 
ensure that there is no risk for the environment upon leaching. The 
potential toxicity of OPV compounds is discussed next.
13.3.3.1 Toxic potential of single OPV components
As mentioned earlier, PET as an embedding material has the highest 
weight share of OPV materials. Due to its resistance to environmental 
degradation (including biodegradation), large volumes of persistent 
PET waste are created. Usually, PET undergoes fragmentation (by 
heat, oxidation, light, ionic radiation, hydrolysis, and mechanical 
shear) into smaller pieces down to <5 mm, called microplastics. For 
even smaller fragments (polymers), the transport across biological 
membranes is limited due to their size. Therefore, polymers as well 
as microplastics are not considered directly toxic. Nevertheless, 
effects from the ingestion of microplastics, including suffocation 
or blocking of the digestive tract, causing death, were documented 
for fish, birds, turtles, and marine mammals. Ingested microplastics 
are translocated from the gut to the circulatory system in mussels 
and finally transported to hemocytes. Despite its widespread use, 
only a few studies were conducted combining PET leaching with 
toxicity tests. These indicated contamination of mineral water with 
phthalates, antimony, and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals 
originating from plastic packaging materials. The acute toxicity of 
plastic product leachates to D. magna is very low (EC505 at 5–80 g 
plastic material per liter or above). Therefore, although PET has the 
highest mass share in OPV, microplastics or leaching of phthalates 
and antimony from PET is regarded as minor toxicological relevance.
	
ITO is a sintered mixture composed of In2O3 and SnO2 (9:1 wt:wt). 
Only a few studies were carried out on the ecotoxicity of ITO, although 
it is commonly used for electrodes. ITO particles have a pulmonary 
toxic effect such as pulmonary inflammation, as observed when 
ITO particles suspended in water were repetitively intratracheally 
instilled into hamsters. The toxicity of ITO particles and that of 
single components (In2O3 and SnO2) were comparatively assessed 
5Concentration where 50% of the tested population shows an effect.
Environmental Impact Assessment of Organic Photovoltaics

582
Circularity and Environmental Sustainability of Organic and Printed Electronics
in vivo (rats) and in vitro (lung epithelial cells, macrophages). The 
sintered ITO was significantly more toxic than its single components 
or the unsintered blend, triggering a strong inflammatory reaction, 
genotoxicity in vivo, a strong cytotoxic response, and production of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro. Blaise, Gagné, and Fe (2008) 
exposed ITO nanoparticles to several taxonomic groups of aquatic 
organisms and found acute toxicity at concentrations lower than 5 
mg/L with the most sensitive response of Hydra attenuate. Here, the 
EC50 is 0.1–1.0 mg/L (96 h exposure). In fish, the soluble indium is 
suggested to be the toxic moiety and causing oxidative stress and 
inflammatory effects as well as disturbing protein folding. Currently, 
the toxicity of ITO to fish and its molecular or cellular mode of action 
are unknown. ITO may be replaced in novel OPV by a printed silver 
(nanoparticle) current-collecting grid.
	
Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are contained in manifold 
consumer 
products, 
including 
antimicrobial 
textiles, 
microelectronics, and healing creams. The present annual 
worldwide production of AgNPs is estimated to be at 500 tonnes. 
Silver might enter the aquatic environment by several routes 
such as during synthesis, manufacturing, and incorporation of 
the nanoparticles into goods; through washing of impregnated 
textiles; and disposal. Modeled and experimental data suggest that 
concentrations present in the surface water are in the nanogram per 
liter range and exponential increases are predicted due to increase 
in usage. The toxicity of particulate silver and nanosilver has already 
been investigated. Biological mechanisms were investigated using 
the microbe Escherichia coli, showing expression alterations in 
envelope and heat-shock proteins, affecting membrane potential 
and culminating in the loss of cell viability. Bacterial communities 
are crucial in wastewater treatment, and suppression of such species 
might impede treatment plant efficiency. The highest concentration 
of a toxic compound that still does not cause an adverse effect is 
referred to as the no observed effect concentration (NOEC). The 
NOEC for a model aquatic invertebrate, Daphnia spp., was 0.001 
µg/L, whereas for freshwater and seawater algae, NOEC values 
between 2 mg/L and 0.002 mg/L were reported with the suggestion 
of silver ion as most toxic form. In fish embryos, AgNPs affect spinal 
cord deformities, cardiac arrhythmia, hatching success, and survival. 
Christen et al. showed the induction of ROS by AgNPs. Moreover, they 

583
showed, for the first time, a strong ER stress response in zebrafish 
liver cells and embryos. The activation of the ER stress response 
can lead to an activation of apoptotic (programmed cell death) and 
inflammatory pathways. Overall, AgNPs showed a more pronounced 
effect compared to equal mass concentrations of AgNO3, suggesting 
a nanoparticulate effect. Additionally, in zebrafish and rainbow 
trout, AgNPs are incorporated into blood vessels, skin, brain, heart, 
and yolk, while Ag ions were concentrated in organelles, the nucleus, 
and the yolk only.
	
The organic polymer PEDOT:PSS has recently been suggested 
as an alternative to ITO in OPV. PEDOT as a single compound and 
PEDOT doped with PSS showed neither cytotoxic nor inflammatory 
response in mouse or human cells as well as in rats. PEDOT and 
PSS are not considered to be toxic. However, when comparing 
varying lengths of PEDOT nanomaterials, the cytotoxic effect and 
ROS production increased with decreasing length. No information 
exists on toxicity of PSS itself, and therefore further investigation is 
needed.
	
Currently, P3HT is the best-fitting organic polymer with the 
highest commercial relevance for the light-adsorbing (photoactive) 
layer of OPV. No toxicological analysis has been performed so far 
on this polymer. In general, polymers are too big to be taken up 
into cells; therefore, toxic effects are not expected. However, UV 
irradiation and degradation mechanisms could lead to smaller-sized 
molecules (e.g., sulfoxides, sulfones, and sulfinate esters), which 
may have a potential for ecotoxicological risks.
	
PCBM (C60 or C70) is the most commonly used electron 
acceptor in OPV. Due to the significantly higher absorption in the 
visible spectrum down to 700 nm, PC70BM is considered to be a new 
alternative for the more commonly used PC60BM. The initial size of 
a PCBM cluster used as P3HT:PCBM active material in OPV is 20 nm, 
but after thermal annealing of the P3HT:PCBM nanocomposites, 
needle-like PCBM crystals are formed with a size of up to 20 µm. 
Fullerenes have been studied for their ecotoxicity. They may 
occur at 0.018–0.19 ng/L in surface waters and 3.69–25.1 ng/L in 
sewage treatment effluents. As described in the previous chapter, 
fullerenes are highly insoluble in water, but hydroxylation render 
them hydrophilic over time. The presence of natural organic matter 
(NOM) has an effect on the physicochemical properties of nC60 
Environmental Impact Assessment of Organic Photovoltaics

584
Circularity and Environmental Sustainability of Organic and Printed Electronics
and, therefore, environmental behavior; aggregation decreases 
with increasing NOM concentration. Despite the fact that NOM is 
ubiquitously present in aqueous environments, most ecotoxicity 
experiments on fullerenes were conducted without its presence. 
No measurable toxicity of nonhydroxylated C60 was noted to E. coli 
and Bacillus subtilis even at very high concentrations of 342 mg/L, 
but an altered membrane phospholipid composition was noted in 
Pseudomonas putida and B. subtilis (Fang et al., 2007). Overall, the 
antibacterial mechanism of C60 is still under debate. Significant 
sublethal, but no lethal, effects were found in the water flea D. magna. 
C60 nanoparticles taken up into the digestive tract by D. magna are 
excreted as large agglomerates. In zebrafish embryos (D. rerio), C60 
aggregates did not alter the mortality, and global gene expression 
changes were relatively minimal. In fathead minnows (Pimephales 
promelas), no significant acute toxicity was found; however, PMP70 
(transport protein involved in lipid metabolism) expression was 
suppressed. Thus far, the toxicity of the derivative PCBM as well 
as C70 has not been assessed. Conclusively, the effect of fullerenes 
is dependent on its surface derivatization and, therefore, direct 
transfer of toxicity data of C60 to the derivative PCBM present in 
OPV is not possible.
	
In OPV manufacturing, nano-ZnO (nZNO) is sputtered in the form 
of nanoparticles in a thin layer. When it enters the environment, 
accumulation and bioavailability of nanoparticles are influenced 
by the amount of NOM, ionic strength, pH, surface area, and shape. 
Furthermore, their small size enhances uptake and interaction with 
biological tissues. Presently, the fate and behavior of nanomaterials 
in the environment and its potential adverse effects are limited. The 
acute toxicity of nZnO is known for a wide variety of organisms. 
The LD50 (lethal dose, 50% of the tested population dies) varies 
considerably depending on the test organism and exposition time. 
The LD50 was found 21.1 mg/L in the bacteria E. coli after 2 h of 
exposure, 68 µg/L in the algae P. subcapitata after 72 h of exposure, 
and 1.793–3.969 mg/L in zebrafish (D. rerio) embryos after 96 
h of exposure. Cellular uptake occurs by diffusion, caveolae, or 
endocytosis. Nanoparticles of 60 nm are not taken up by zebrafish 
embryos, whereas nanoparticles of 12 nm can be taken up via egg 
shell (chorion) pore canals. When metal-based nanoparticles enter 
the cell, they deliver free metal ions, resulting in metal-related 

585
toxicity. In fish, nanoparticles enter via gills and the gut epithelium. 
Then they may be distributed to other organs, including the brain. At 
the cellular level, surface-reactive nanoparticles lead to induction of 
ROS, as shown, for instance, for nZnO in zebrafish. ROS generation 
can trigger deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and membrane injury 
and oxidative stress, which lead to phase II enzyme induction, 
inflammation, and mitochondrial perturbation with apoptosis. 
Particle dissolution and Zn2+ shedding of nZnO can lead to pro-
inflammatory and cytotoxic effects, which leads to lysosomal 
damage, triggering of intracellular [Ca2+] flux, mitochondrial 
perturbation, and cytotoxicity. This mechanism was proven to 
take place in organisms, as intracellular ROS were measured in 
the embryonic cell suspension from zebrafish embryos exposed to 
nZnO. In summary, much is known about nZnO toxicity, but certain 
questions, including the molecular action and target toxicity, are still 
open. The potential nanotoxicity effects of nZnO used in novel OPV 
were assessed by Brun et al. (2014), and detailed methods as well as 
results are described next.
13.3.3.2 Example for toxicity studies: Assessment of nZnO
Zinc is an essential trace element for organisms but induces toxicity 
at elevated concentrations. In organisms, cellular Zn ion fluctuations 
are mainly regulated by Zn-binding proteins called metallothioneins 
(MTs). In the case of an excess supply of Zn, the MT gene is increasingly 
transcribed and MT proteins translated. If MTs are not able to bind 
the excess of Zn, ROS formation may be provoked. Induction of ROS 
formation was observed for both Zn and nZnO. Excessive production 
of ROS can induce pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic effects. nZnO 
and associated released Zn may ultimately lead to apoptosis and 
acute toxicity at high concentrations. However, induction of an 
inflammatory response has not been investigated before.
	
For the OPV case study, effects of nZnO and equal concentrations 
of released dissolved Zn were compared in experimental exposures 
of zebrafish eggs. The zebrafish embryos were exposed from 3 
h postfertilization (hpf) to 96 hpf. An environmentally relevant 
exposure medium was prepared by adding salts and naturally 
occurring alginate to nanopure water. Alginate is a polysaccharide-
based organic material previously shown to stabilize nanoparticles 
and reduce their aggregation rate. The Brunauer–Emmet–Teller

(BET) analysis showed a mean size of 9.4 nm under dry conditions 
and between 196 and 336 nm in exposure media (Nanosight), 
indicating a considerable particle aggregation. ICP-MS analysis 
was performed to quantify Zn ions released from nZnO. An 
appropriate amount of ZnCl2 was used to obtain a medium without 
nanoparticles, but the equivalent concentration of soluble Zn. 
Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.2, 1, and 5 mg/L nZnO, as well 
as to the corresponding concentrations of 0.27, 1.30, and 5.74 mg/L 
ZnCl2. Exposure to nZnO or Zn affected the hatching rate, depending 
on the exposure concentration. At 72 hpf, hatching was significantly 
delayed in exposed embryos at all exposure concentrations of nZnO 
and Zn2+ compared to controls. At 96 hpf, almost all individuals of the 
lowest-dose groups hatched, whereas only a few embryos hatched in 
the mid- and high-dose groups. No significant differences occurred 
between nZnO- and corresponding Zn-dissolved concentrations 
(Fig. 13.13). Therefore, the dissolution of Zn from nZnO, rather than 
the nanoparticles, is suggested to be the key determinant for delayed 
and inhibited hatching. An inhibitory effect of nZnO on hatching of 
embryos was previously described.
Figure 13.13 Zebrafish embryo hatching success at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h 
postfertilization (hpf) when exposed to nZnO (0.2, 1, and 5 mg/L) and ZnCl2 
(0.27, 1.30, and 5.74 mg/L). The low concentration delays hatching, whereas 
the middle and high concentrations almost completely inhibit hatching. Figure 
taken from Brun et al. (2013). 
	
LA-ICP-MS analysis demonstrated that Zn is accumulated in 
exposed zebrafish embryos at 120 and 168 hpf. The prominent 

587
target organs for Zn uptake were the retina and pigment layer of the 
eyes, brain structures, spinal cord, and yolk sac (Fig. 13.14), possibly 
due to the higher activity and presence of uptake transporters in 
these tissues.

(left) and Zn organ distribution measured by LA-ICP-MS (right). In each picture, 
coronal zebrafish embryo sections of controls (embryo on the left), nZnO 5 
mg/L (center) and ZnCl2 5.74 mg/L (right) exposure groups at 120 and 168 hpf, 
respectively, are shown. Spots of accumulation are labelled as (1) retina and 
pigment layers of the eyes, (2) spinal cord, and (3) brain. Color bars show the 
intensity in counts per seconds. Figure taken from Brun et al. (2013).
	
Gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR was performed using 
48 h and 96 h embryos. For the two time points, mRNA levels of 
genes related to MT (mt2) and oxidative stress (Cu/Zn-sod) were 
determined. Transcripts of mt2 were significantly upregulated 
at both time points and almost all concentrations, displaying an 
enhanced need for metal binding. The expression of Cu/Zn-sod 
showed a similar temporal pattern for both nZnO and Zn, with an 
upregulation at 48 hpf and a downregulation at 96 hpf at the highest 
concentrations (Fig. 13.15). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase

are enzymes protecting the cells against superoxide free radicals. 
While SOD catalyzes the breakdown of superoxide into oxygen and 
hydrogen peroxide, catalase (Cat) then catalyzes the decomposition 
of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. The results indicate a 
reaction to elevated ROS levels and thus an induction of oxidative 
stress at 48 hpf. In contrast, the downregulation at 96 hpf may be 
related to a negative feedback mechanism. Similar alterations in 
gene expression were found for nZnO and ZnCl2.
Figure 13.15 Gene expression of metallothionein (mt2) and oxidative stress-
related gene Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-sod) in zebrafish embryos 
(at 48 and 96 hpf) exposed to 0.2, 1, and 5 mg/L nZnO and corresponding 
concentrations of free zinc by adding 0.27, 1.30, and 5.74 mg/L ZnCl2. The 
asterisk represents a significant difference between treatment and control with 
p < 0.05. Figure taken from Brun et al. (2013).
	
The results demonstrated dose-dependent effects of nZnO and 
Zn2+. A fast release of Zn2+ from nZnO in water is very likely to make 
the free metal ions the primary source of the observed effects. LA-ICP-
MS analysis has demonstrated that Zn released from both Zn sources 

589
became equally accumulated in zebrafish embryos. Both nZnO and 
Zn showed a similar hatching interference, and they induced similar 
effects on gene expression. This leads to the conclusion that the 
nanoparticle nature itself contributed very little to the effects, and 
the biological activity on nZnO is mainly based on the release of free 
Zn.
	
In sewage treatment plant effluents, concentrations of nZnO 
are expected to be in the range of 0.3–0.4 µg/L. Despite relatively 
high nZnO concentrations used in this study, the data contribute to 
the understanding of potential hazards and effects of nZnO in the 
aquatic environment. At the lowest tested concentration, still about 
500 times higher than expected concentration in sewage treatment 
plant effluents, effects on the gene expression level diminished or 
were not observed at all.
13.3.4 Concluding Assessment of OPV Environmental 
Impact
OPV is a promising innovative electricity-generating technology 
offering novel application possibilities. In comparison to classic PV 
modules based on silicon, a wide variety of chemical substances 
are incorporated into OPV layers, for example, organic polymers or 
nanoparticulate metals. Such novel substances, also applied in OPE, 
are so far not well studied, concerning their life cycle as well as their 
environmental fate and ecotoxicity.
	
Comparative LCA showed that total environmental impacts of 
OPV are, at the current stage of development, similar to those of 
multi-Si cells but higher than those for CdTe cells. Since the main 
environmental impact of OPV stems from the electrodes, ITO 
replacement by silver and improved efficiency will considerably 
decrease their environmental impact below multi-Si and CdTe cells.
	
OPV leaching studies showed that metals are released from OPV 
materials, although at such minute amounts that the PEC calculated 
would meet even stringent drinking water criteria. PCBM, which 
may have an adverse effect, was shown to be extremely hydrophobic, 
so even if released, it would most probably bind strongly to soil/
sediments, rendering its bioavailability.
	
In ecotoxicity experiments, it was shown that nanoparticulate 
ZnO leads to adverse effects. However, such effects were not elevated

590
Circularity and Environmental Sustainability of Organic and Printed Electronics
in comparison to ionic Zn(II), which occurs naturally. Furthermore, 
effects were only problematic in concentrations far above the 
concentrations that would result from OPV leaching.
	
In summary, from the current knowledge point of view, OPV 
bears the potential to become a truly green technology.
13.4 OPE Technologies as Potential Circularity 
and Sustainability Enabler
While previous sections predominantly discussed environmental 
impacts of OPE technologies themselves, using OPV as a case study, 
this section will introduce the possible role of OPE technologies in 
enabling and accelerating a transition toward a circular economy 
and more sustainable society.
	
As shown in Fig. 13.3, the combination of innovation at different 
levels will enable necessary systemic transitions. Understanding, 
using a product-centric focus, the environmental impacts of these 
emerging technologies is essential. It has largely been discussed and 
illustrated in Section 12.3 using a specific OPE technology and three 
existing environmental impact assessment methods. However, the 
use case and application of OPE as part of a system will determine the 
actual environmental sustainability of the technological integration. 
Functionalities enabled by OPE technologies can actually lead to 
an increased circularity and mitigate the environmental impacts 
of specific solutions. Ensuring an environmentally sound and 
beneficial deployment of OPE technologies means it is thus crucial 
that environmental savings associated with a functionalization of 
a product/surface (largely) overcome the environmental impact 
associated with its integration. The selected case study of a flexible 
OPV solution is a concrete example. The function of this OPE product 
is to generate renewable energy. EPBT has been developed as an 
indicator evaluating its environmental viability. Today, similar 
sustainability assessment (and accounting) challenges are faced for 
the broader topic of digitalization in which OPE can play a key role. 
The European Green Digital Coalition, an initiative of companies 
supported by the European Commission and the European 
Parliament, is running a pilot project that will provide the current 

591
missing science-based methods to estimate the net environmental 
impact of real-life digital solutions across sectors. This net 
environmental impact is considered both the positive contribution 
(e.g., carbon reduction) and the direct footprint of a given digital 
solution. 
	
It is indeed today acknowledged that digital technologies can 
act as an enabler for achieving climate objectives. This positive 
contribution is, for instance, mentioned within the above-referred 
European strategies (European Green Deal, CEAP). The circular 
economy research community particularly sees a lot of potential 
in technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Information 
deficit between value-chain actors is often quoted as the main 
barrier to circularity. IoT connects material and information flows 
and plays a central role for data collection. When combined with 
appropriate storage and analytics, collected data could be translated 
into relevant information, for instance, for manufacturers to track, 
monitor, control, optimize, or again provide some design evolution 
of their products. Increasing reliability of manufacturing processes 
and extending product lifetime are important circular strategies and 
sources of waste prevention. Minimizing wear through predictive, 
preventive, or reactive maintenance and repair can indeed 
improve the efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of a 
manufacturing process. At the product level and as described by 
Ingemarsdotter et al., “[digital] tracking allows maintenance actors 
to identify and locate products that need to be serviced. Moreover, 
products can monitor their own use and status, and send alerts 
about when they need maintenance, and which spare parts to order. 
The capability of control can also enable remote maintenance, repair, 
and upgrades. In advanced cases, companies continuously monitor 
the condition of products and apply prediction models that allow 
them to optimally plan and execute maintenance before a product 
fails” (Ingemarsdotter, Jamsin, and Balkenende, 2020).
	
As described in previous chapters, OPE-specific technologies can 
be considered IoT enablers. The integration of printed electronics in

with the aim to integrate new functionalities. Functionality is

Circularity and Environmental Sustainability of Organic and Printed Electronics
electronic active/passive sensors are used for the structural control 
and real-time monitoring of the structural behavior of fiber-
reinforced polymer composite materials. As a concrete example and 
based on a collaboration between French research and technology 
organizations, a small-scale demonstrator (1 m long) for “smart 
composites” in wind turbine blades has, for instance, already been 
developed. This demonstrator investigates the functional integration 
of structural health monitoring (SHM) and de-icing in a wind turbine 
blade. The turbine blade demonstrator is functionalized with printed 
organic electronics (namely, strain gauges, temperature sensors, and 
heaters). The strain and temperature sensors can detect potential 
damage occurring on the blade structure beforehand, making it 
possible to carry out preventive repairs, while the heaters allow 
the de-icing of the blade and preserve its functionality in harsh 
environment and increases its lifetime thanks to an optimized usage. 
In a report discussing the linkages between circular economy and 
digitalization, this application of OPE technology was described in 
more details (Berg et al., 2020). It was used as an example of printing 
electronics in material parts and using digital resource optimization 
capabilities for extending a component-use cycle with better 
maintenance and repair actions. Figure 13.16 was created based 
on the smart circular economy framework introduced in the above-
mentioned report.
	
Opening the product-centric focus and taking a more systemic 
perspective, more efficient wind turbine operations lead to a 
higher amount of generated renewable energy. According to a LEE 
Bed project, this operational data-driven approach could lead to 
15% decrease in inspection activities and thus maintenance costs. 
Utility companies, being driven by performance, i.e., wind turbine 
power capabilities, better and more tailored maintenance services 
can enable wind turbine manufacturers to adjust and rethink 
their current business models. Condition-based and/or predictive 
maintenance schemes can provide the necessary knowledge and 
wisdom for transitioning toward more performance-based business 
models. Ultimately, obtained data can be used to improve designs for 
the next generation of wind turbines.

Circularity and Environmental Sustainability of Organic and Printed Electronics
	
In this section, a specific example and application of OPE 
technology has been used, but a similar logic could be replicated to 
additional use cases. Translated into information and knowledge, 
the data generated by OPE technologies could provide the basis for 
circular business strategies, if they are used with an aim to maintain 
or increase the functionality of the product or component, and/or to 
increase its lifetime. Printed RFID tags could find environmentally 
beneficial applications in several sectors for improving the 
traceability of a product and efficiency of operations through an 
entire supply chain. It could, for instance, enable reverse logistics 
activities and minimize waste generation. Embedded in particular 
substrates, printed sensors could not only provide the necessary 
and timely information for enabling condition-based and preventive 
maintenance but also facilitating remanufacturing and reuse 
activities. If not contaminating existing waste streams but rather 
facilitating end-of-life treatment activities (e.g., improving sorting), 
tags and sensors could be used to improve material circularity.
	
To conclude this chapter, it is important to remind the urgency 
of mitigating climate change. Designing sustainable products has a 
tremendous role to play in that matter. The European electronics 
industry needs to accelerate its sustainability transition. Acting at the 
product level and understanding environmental risks and impacts 
occurring with emerging technologies such as OPE are essential 
for not adding issues to the existing ones. In several use cases, 
OPE technologies can act as greener solution than conventional 
electronics. Gaining additional environmental knowledge is the 
first step in this transition toward a more sustainable electronics 
industry. Building on these knowledge and deriving OPE-specific 
ecodesign principles and ensuring their possible integration within 
existing and future product development processes will then be 
essential. However, and as described within this chapter, designing 
for sustainability implies more than reducing impacts of existing 
solutions. This would solely optimize the current predominant “take-
make-dispose” model. As presented in this chapter, the field of design 
for sustainability has evolved and has extended its product-centric 
focus. For designing truly sustainable solutions, and reminding the 
selected case study having for objective to generate green electricity, 
OPE providers could rethink the role of their technologies in solving 
societal challenges such as preventing food waste, enabling mobility 

595
as a service, etc. Circularity and environmental sustainability aspects 
of OPE technologies need to be considered and assessed using this 
combination of perspectives.
Exercises
	
1.	 The energy payback time (EPBT) indicator is very often 
used to compare PV technologies (see also Section 12.2.2.1). 
It focuses only on energy aspects and does not consider 
environmental impacts from emissions. In this exercise, 
EPBTs shall be calculated for multi-Si (21% eff.), CdTe (10.9% 
eff.), flexible OPV (2.8% eff.), and future tandem OPV (10% 
eff.). Normalization is required because of an expected 
lifetime of 30 years for multi-Si and CdTe and 20 years for 
OPV. The assumed harvested electricity is 1000 kWh per year 
and kWp. Table 13.2 shows the CED for the production of PV 
technologies.

2. Silver leaching: In a laboratory experiment spanning over 4 
months, determine that 100 mg of silver is leaching from 1 kg 
of OPV cells (=2 m2). Calculate the PEC of silver in a scenario 
where OPV cells are installed on a roof (80% coverage; all rain 
water collected in one tank) in Madrid, Spain (average annual 
precipitation 300 mm; assumed to precipitate regularly over 
the year). Compare the PEC to the WHO drinking water limit.
	
3. Toxic components of the model OPV: List the potentially 
toxic components of the model OPV and their toxic effects. 
Metals have been elucidated as potentially toxic materials in 
OPV. Where in the environment do such hazardous materials 
end up? And what are the uptake routes in organisms?

development process, but also as a process for its commercial 
exploitation, and eventually wider diffusion in markets and 
economies, resulting in wealth creation, economic profitability, and 
wider societal impact.
	
The goal of this chapter is to introduce the salient features of the 
organic and printed electronics (OPE) sector, frame the key concepts 
and terminology related to innovation management, and finally to 
provide insights and perspectives based on cases and trends in the 
OPE sector.
	
Organic electronics refers to a new material set as a technological 
differentiator, namely, organic semiconductors presented in 
Chapter 2. Printed electronics, on the other hand, refers to 
process technologies, presented in Chapter 3, as a technological 
differentiator. Finding one simple name for the sector is complicated 
because it also includes inorganic functional materials that can 
be printed as well as organic materials that can be deposited by 
evaporation techniques. In essence, OPE often refers to a way of 
producing electronics enabled by printing functional materials on 
flexible substrates. As a manufacturing paradigm, it is still relatively 
new and emerging with various levels of adoption in the industry. 
Printing offers benefits such as for additive manufacture with a 
reduced number of process steps and less waste than subtractive 
processes. New materials can be processed to a large extent at low 
temperatures, which not only reduce energy but also enable flexible 
substrates such as plastics and paper to be used. The result is that 
electronic devices made under the new paradigm may exhibit form 
factor benefits such as flexibility, large area, light weight, thinness, 
and robustness when compared to conventional silicon- or circuit-
board-based electronics. The actual electronic functionality that is 
being produced is not new: Displays, sensors, photovoltaics, and 
lighting can all be implemented in other conventional ways. In the 
case of lighting, for example, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) 
offer a fourth-generation approach after incandescent bulbs, 
fluorescent tubes, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Innovation using 
OPE is almost always characterized, therefore, by considerations 
relating to incumbent products and technologies. There can be 
significant benefits, however, in using organic material architectures 
or printing to produce electronics for a particular application, and it 
is part of the skill of the business developer and the technologist to

identify those applications where there is real value in using the new 
approach. This could relate to a performance or form factor benefit 
or it might relate to a manufacturing benefit of which the end-user 
will be unaware.
	
Innovation 
studies 
discussing 
the 
emergence 
of 
new 
technological and knowledge-based fields such as biotechnology and 
nanotechnology have identified common dynamics that characterize 
different 
stages 
of 
development: 
uncertainty, 
complexity, 
heterogeneity of actors, distributed nature of knowledge, particularly 
relevant in the first stage of the industry life cycle, emergence of a 
dominant design, and convergence of a broad range of technological 
and scientific fields in a later stage. OPE is an emerging technology, 
that is, science-based innovations with the potential to create a 
new industry or transform existing ones. Science-based businesses 
emerge at the intersection of multiple bodies of science.
	
Technological progress within emerging technological fields 
is mostly attributed to many diverse actors such as research 
and technology organizations, either private or public and small 
entrepreneurial technology-based firms. However, as the technology 
develops, the domain of innovation shifts from small de novo firms 
to large established players and the nature of innovation evolves 
from advancement in scientific and technological fundamentals 
to commercial applications. Another important aspect of new 
technologies is their potential to be disruptive to the existing market 
and its value network. As originally identified by Christensen, 
products based on disruptive technologies are often inferior in terms 
of some performance metrics accepted in mainstream markets 
from the supply side. However, they offer different attributes (new 
value proposition) that appeal to customers and have sufficient 
performance to be accepted by some market segments on the demand 
side (early adopters). Eventually, as the new products become 
recognized and valued by increasingly mainstream customers, their 
market share increases and they displace established products. This 
is illustrated in Fig. 14.1.
	
OPE technologies offer solutions for a large variety of application 
areas as highlighted in the roadmapping and application chapter of 
this book. However, OPE also faces the challenges typical of emerging 
and potentially disruptive technologies, including the creation of 
new products, value proposition, and business models. Additionally, 

606
Innovation Management and Organic and Printed Electronics
OPE relies on complex value chains involving multiple organizations 
in different industry segments and geographies. At present there 
are approximately 3000 organizations active in the field located in 
Europe, the United States, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China. 
They include universities, research institutes, start-ups, small 
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and large multinational 
organizations.
Figure 14.1 The “S” curve: life and death of products and services.
	
The radical nature of some OPE innovations creates products 
that are too far from current products for end-users to be able to 
envision them and articulate a precise demand. Conversely, the 
technology push exerted by several actors creates a vast number 
of options for business investors to choose from. The combination 
of these elements creates a situation where actors are reluctant to 
invest and results in waiting games. Analysts argue that the lack of 
a one-size-fits-all solution in the printed electronics market and the 
variety of technologies, each sitting in its own niche based on its own 
attributes, delay the realization of high-volume markets that would 
enable significant cost reductions.
	
The progress and development within OPE printed electronics 
offers a close comparison to the other science-based businesses 
such as biotechnology and nanotechnology, which are characterized 
by a long period of risky investments and uncertainty and where 
entrepreneurial ventures and start-ups are involved in scientific

discoveries owing to stronger technical challenges; reviewing them 
through innovation lenses tends to be all the more important.
	
In the next section, we first introduce and explain the evolution 
of the OPE business sector and the complexity of the value chain 
(Section 14.2). Section 14.3 presents fundamental concepts 
from the innovation management literature that are relevant for 
understanding and managing the development of OPE: the systemic 
model of innovation, types of innovation (product, process, radical, 
incremental), and the sailing ship effect. Section 14.4 focuses more 
on the dynamics of developing technological innovations through 
collaboration within an ecosystem, referring to specific examples in 
the OPE industry, while Section 14.5 discusses several issues affecting 
commercialization of a new technology: technological and market 
uncertainty, testing a new market, developing dynamic capabilities, 
complementary technologies and products in the system, business 
model selection, intellectual property (IP), and the role of public 
policy in accelerating and fostering an emerging industry.
14.2 Organic and Printed Electronics Sectors
Organic electronics is widely considered to have been born in the 
late 1970s with the discovery of conducting polymers and developed 
over the next two decades in a wave of optimism regarding the 
potential for the technology to reduce costs, to replace conventional 
electronics, and to create completely new markets. Plastic Logic, in a 
presentation given in 2002, stated:
“Plastic Logic’s technology [based on inkjet printing of active electronic 
circuits using organic semiconductors] has the potential to change 
radically the economics of key segments of the semiconductor industry. 
Capital costs will be significantly lower than for silicon by eliminating 
conventional 
photolithography, 
vacuum 
processing, 
and 
high 
temperatures.”
	
Writing in Nature in 2004, Professor Steven Forrest, at the 
University of Michigan, one of the pioneers of OLED technology, said:
“Organic electronics are beginning to make significant inroads into the 
commercial world, and if the field continues to progress at its current, 
rapid pace, electronics based on organic thin-film materials will soon 

608
Innovation Management and Organic and Printed Electronics
become a mainstay of our technological existence. Already products 
based on active thin-film organic devices are in the market place, most 
notably the displays of several mobile electronic appliances. Yet the 
future holds even greater promise for this technology, with an entirely 
new generation of lightweight and even flexible electronic devices in the 
offing, which will perform functions traditionally accomplished using 
much more expensive components based on conventional semiconductor 
materials such as silicon.”
	
Moving forward a couple of decades later, OLEDs are ubiquitous 
in smartphones, wearables, and hand-held devices; large-area OED 
TVs are readily available consumer products; and printed sensors 
are seamlessly integrated in millions of automobiles. Yet OPE still 
has not fully fulfilled all the expectations raised by the early heralds 
of the printed electronics revolution. Why is this? Several factors 
characterize the development of OPE markets, and our discussion 
on the general principles for innovation management in OPE will be 
set based on these realities.
14.2.1 Allow Time for Big Materials Performance Gains
In the case of OLED displays, it took 32 years from the first 
publication of the bilayer OLED device by Professor Ching Tang, 
then of Kodak, in 1981 to the passing of the milestone of the $10 
billion market size in 2013. Early OLEDs suffered from many 
issues, including very short lifetime (of the order of minutes), poor 
efficiency, and poor color reproduction. Process tools for vacuum 
deposition and patterning of OLED layers uniformly and rapidly 
over large areas of glass did not exist, and in addition, the thin-
film transistor backplane (see, for instance, Chapter 5) needed to 
drive OLED displays required significantly higher performance and 
uniformity than the available amorphous silicon technology was 
then able to provide. Over the next 20 years, enormous resources 
were channeled into understanding and overcoming the causes of 
degradation and into the development of new generations of organic 
materials that provided higher efficiency, increased lifetime, and 
improved color. Process tools for mass production were developed, 
and the technical challenges of providing a suitable backplane were 
overcome one by one. All these have taken time, and it is a common 

609
Organic and Printed Electronics Sectors
theme of organic electronics that lifetime and performance issues 
are often addressed by the development of materials over a period of 
years. Nevertheless, we see from the pioneering organic electronics 
technology of OLED that enormous improvements are possible 
and that consumer electronics products based on the technology 
can be advantageous in the marketplace. Other organic electronics 
technologies should be able to leverage the learning from OLED and 
shorten the time to market.
14.2.2 Still Evolving Incumbent Technologies
Given the very long time it took for OLED to move from laboratory to 
market, it was possible for significant improvements to occur in the 
incumbent technology. For instance, that was the case with active-
matrix OLED (AMOLED) display facing active-matrix liquid-crystal 
display (AMLCD). In the early 2000s, pioneers such as Kodak first 
started to commercialize OLED displays with AMOLED, promising 
major advantages over AMLCD: much lower power consumption, 
better off-angle performance, thinner construction, and more vivid 
color. This point was not lost on the tier-one manufacturers of 
AMLCD, and dramatic improvements in performance ensued over 
the next 10 years, particularly in color and off-angle viewability, 
so the performance gap between OLED and LCD has narrowed 
considerably and the business case for scaling up the technology 
became much more of a strategic matter for the leading display 
companies. For any new OPE technology, we must carefully consider 
the trajectory of improvement for the incumbent technology or 
(in the case of lighting and photovoltaics) technologies over the 
likely timescale for the development of materials and scaling up of 
manufacturing.
14.2.3 Costs Added by Challenges of Scale-Up
In the early days of organic electronics, there was a perception that 
solution-based processing and printing would give a systematic cost 
advantage in manufacturing. For this reason, OPE has often been 
presented as a low-cost technology. The reality is that OPE presents 
other technical challenges and that when these are addressed in a 

610
Innovation Management and Organic and Printed Electronics
high-yielding manufacturing facility, significant cost is added such 
that, again, the cost differential gap between the incumbent and the 
OPE technology is reduced. For example, although it may be highly 
cost effective to additively pattern organic materials by printing, some 
devices require feature sizes that are far below printing resolution 
so that other more expensive patterning approaches must be used. 
In the long term, solution processing of organic materials may offer 
a cost advantage in a high-volume facility, but for early applications 
of a given OPE technology, when volumes are low, this may not be the 
case. Another example relates to yield; although it is highly attractive 
to use a printing press to print electronic devices onto packaging 
materials, dust particles in the air may be of the same size as the 
features being printed such that yield can be dramatically reduced 
unless the whole press is placed in a clean room or an enclosed 
environment. This, of course, adds significant cost.
14.2.4 Readiness of All System Components before 
Product Launch
In the case of AMOLED, the scale-up of a suitable transistor 
backplane of sufficient quality turned out to be more challenging 
than the scale-up of the OLED frontplane. Yet, without the backplane, 
AMOLED displays are not possible. For OLED, as well as organic 
photovoltaics (OPV), suitable encapsulation technology, including 
moisture and oxygen barriers, is needed. AMOLED uses glass, which 
has excellent performance as a substrate for organic electronics for 
a whole variety of reasons, including flatness, transparency, cost, 
and barrier properties. Roll-to-roll production has been considered 
a route to reduce manufacturing cost for OLED lighting and for 
OPV, but to enable this, a flexible barrier is needed. Although thin 
flexible glass has now become available, it is not always a suitable 
substrate for reasons of cost and robustness. Instead, transparent 
plastic films with an integral moisture and oxygen barrier have been 
developed by several organizations worldwide. Flexible materials 
with appropriate barrier properties, as presented in one of the 
chapters of this book, are part of the supply and value chain for OPE 
devices. Their availability and cost have a clear impact on the ability 
to produce final products, as well as on their performance and cost.

611
14.2.5 Need for Multifunctional Systems for Some 
Applications
In applications for OPE such as intelligent packaging, anti-
counterfeiting, or smart objects, systems are needed and these 
might need a sensor, some signal processing, a display, and onboard 
power in the form of an energy-harvesting module or a thin 
primary battery. Large end-users may want a company to put the 
whole system onto a label, which can then be applied to products 
at high-speed using conventional converting equipment. Frequently, 
however, individual items in the system are produced by companies 
that only cover subsets of the whole value chain and there are a 
few companies that can integrate the whole system from multiple 
suppliers into a functional product such as a smart label. The need 
for system integrators has, in some cases, contributed to the slow 
growth of the market.
	
Returning now to the question posed earlier as to the challenges 
for creating rapidly a sizable market for OPE, we can see that there 
are two broad reasons. First, timescales are longer than expected 
because of the need for improved materials, new process tools, 
and the integration of complete systems, which themselves obey to 
different timescales (materials, equipment, process development, 
and integration). Second, some companies did not survive or exited 
because they were not able to develop products offering sufficient 
value for early markets compared to the incumbent technologies 
that keep improving incrementally, a typical innovation challenge. 
Many companies active in OPE are now selling products into first 
applications. In time, volumes will grow, yield will improve, costs 
will reduce, and greater opportunities will develop.
14.2.6 Complexity in the Value Chain
The environment in which OPE value chains exist has been 
summarized in Fig. 14.2. Even after more than two decades of 
development, the value chains are still dynamic and evolving. Apart 
from the traditional players such as the chemical industry, other 
players are from industries as diverse as mechanical engineering, 
printing, packaging, and consumer goods. Some of the players 
are dedicated to OPE technology development, while others are

attracted due to the huge potential of this emerging technology in 
their markets. The evolution of printed electronics is not limited only 
to knowledge development and accumulation within companies 
but is also about formation of clusters and, ultimately, formation of 
global ecosystems and communities.
	
With this as a background, we now introduce basic innovation 
management concepts that can be applied to the commercial 
development of OPE.
Figure 14.2 Value-chain environment for OPE.
14.3 Innovation Processes and Management
To understand the main issues and challenges in developing 
successful new products and technologies, it is important to identify 
the main characteristics, patterns, and dynamics of innovation.
14.3.1 Innovation Processes: From Linear to Systemic 
Models
Over the last 40 years, innovation studies, as a discipline at the 
interface between economics, business, management, and strategy, 

613
have made substantial progress in developing an understanding 
of innovation and its sources, challenges, and management. This 
progress has given origin to five conceptual models, or generations, 
of innovation, starting from simple and linear models of science or 
technology push and demand pull, which reflect the post–World War 
II environment, to integrated, systemic models closer to the more 
complex reality of developing technological innovation today.
	
The first, and simplest, model of innovation is the science push, 
which is based on the capacity of relatively small elites, often based 
in universities and public research institutes, to make scientific 
discoveries that underlie new scientific industries, as observed in 
the 1960s. This model reflected the success of big science and can 
be exemplified by the Manhattan Project and the development of 
the atomic bomb. Today, this basic model is often used to justify 
public investment in new sciences, such as biotechnology and 
nanotechnology, where substantial investments in developing new 
technology are needed before being able to reap profits through 
commercialization and, therefore, provide economic incentives to 
private firms to invest in emerging technologies.
	
By the 1970s, the pace of scientific discoveries was beginning to 
slow and the optimism of the 1960s was in decline. The organization 
of technological innovation by the private sector began to change, 
with the emergence of the demand-led second generation of R&D 
management, which lasted from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. In 
this model, R&D became much more accountable and R&D centers 
were often downsized, with a greater emphasis on problem-
solving development, which was increasingly decentralized to the 
production sites of firms. Innovation as a whole became much more 
responsive to market trends rather than creating new markets. As 
a consequence of this change in the mindset of corporations, R&D 
became increasingly short term, project based, and solutions based, 
with a stronger focus on marketing as a strategic organizational 
capability for successful innovation.
	
The third-generation model combined both the science-push 
and market-pull models, which preceded it, as the marketing–R&D 
coupling model of innovation. But while recognizing the importance 
of both supply and demand in innovation, this model was still highly 
linear or sequential, emphasizing the development of new products, 
rather than implementing their production.
Innovation Processes and Management

614
Innovation Management and Organic and Printed Electronics
	
A more fundamental reconceptualization of innovation as 
a process and how to manage it came from the extraordinary 
historical success of Japan. Japanese firms developed an approach 
to innovation that integrates developments in various functional 
areas within a firm, for example, marketing, R&D, production 
engineering, manufacturing, etc., all undertaken at the same time, 
in parallel, rather than in a linear and sequential manner. This 
approach sees innovation as a distributed system and much more 
inclusive and incremental, rather than imposed and radical. This 
fourth generation of R&D, which dates from the late 1980s, was 
based around attempting to balance short- and long-term financial 
needs by maintaining a portfolio of short- and long-term projects, 
undertaken in partnership with the operating divisions of the 
company and sometimes with other strategic partners, such as 
universities and public research units.
	
The success of Japanese firms highlighted that innovation is 
increasingly distributed between firms and other organizations, 
rather than dependent on a single large firm acting alone. This 
understanding gave rise to the current strategic integration, fifth-
generation model of innovation, which observes that innovation is 
increasingly dependent on cross-functional integration within the 
firm, in combination with close interrelations with external agents, 
such as suppliers, customers (or users), and possibly commercial 
partners and other sources of technology, such as universities or 
public research institutes. The development of OLED seems to fit very 
well with this systemic and distributed view of innovation within an 
ecosystem made of a variety of partners, due to the complex nature 
of this technology and the multiplicity of potential applications, 
whereby the earlier simple linear models of innovation would not 
allow to capture the full dynamics and interactions of developing 
and managing OPE.
14.3.2 Types of Innovation over the Industrial Life Cycle
In recent decades, it has been observed that technologies and 
industries are increasingly blending, with innovations increasingly 
crossing industry boundaries: A new fiber developed by the textile 
industry has the potential for building materials and medical 
equipment. This technological fusion blends incremental technical 

615
improvements from several previously separate fields of technology, 
generating products that revolutionize markets. Optoelectronics 
and mechatronics are examples of areas of technological fusion.
	
It has been recognized that in several markets for OPE, it will be 
necessary to combine both printed and silicon-based electronics to 
form working systems. For example, if it is required to store more 
than a few tens of bits of digital data, it is currently necessary to use 
silicon memory. Similarly, for more than the simplest processing of 
information, silicon microprocessors are required. An example of 
this would be for printed sensor systems, some elements of which 
may be printed with other elements implemented in conventional 
silicon. The challenge for these hybrid systems is to maintain the 
form factor benefits of thinness and flexibility that are enabled by 
printing electronics on flexible substrates.
	
Individual companies, however large, are unlikely to be able to 
master and remain abreast of developments in several technological 
fields at once. Consequently, firms need to build research consortia 
and long-term ties, both with other companies and with public-
sector organizations such as universities, and this requires the 
development of collaboration skills, in what we now call an 
ecosystem, which, crucially, requires reciprocity, mutual trust, and 
responsibility, to enjoy shared rewards and reduce opportunistic 
behavior.
	
The need to engage in collaborative arrangements for innovation 
seems to be increasing in recent years for several reasons. First, 
the relative cost of R&D is rising faster than general business 
costs because R&D is labor intensive, and wages tend to rise faster 
than other costs. Second, markets have become less certain and 
are quicker to change. This coupled with the decline in the mass 
production of highly standardized products means firms seek to 
reduce the risks inherent in innovation by engaging in collaborations 
and strategic alliances. Moreover, the emergence of new competitors 
in the global business landscape, mainly high-tech companies in 
emerging economies such as South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, 
has put additional pressure on long-established companies in 
Western economies.
	
Collaborations between industry and the science base of 
universities and government research organizations have attracted 
considerable attention in recent years among academic researchers 
Innovation Processes and Management

616
Innovation Management and Organic and Printed Electronics
and policymakers in most advanced economies, including 
continental Europe, the United States, and Japan. Encouraging 
greater collaboration is not just a question of fixing the institutional 
arrangements; it is also a matter of developing trust upon which 
collaborative relationships are based. It may also involve universities 
changing their research priorities to make them more relevant to the 
industry, although this does not necessarily mean making research 
directly respondent to the requirements of the industry.
	
An important distinction is between radical and incremental 
innovation. Incremental innovations build on existing products 
and the knowledge required in improving these products; they 
tend to enhance existing competences, allow existing products 
to stay competitive, and are characterized by low uncertainty. 
Most innovations are incremental. Radical innovations require 
technological knowledge that is very different from existing 
knowledge, which in turn can become obsolete along with the 
products on which it is based. Radical innovations are, therefore, 
competence destroying; they are characterized by higher 
uncertainty and risk and are less common. However, when they do 
appear in the market, they can dramatically change the competitive 
industrial landscape. Incumbents may outperform new entrants 
offering radical innovations in terms of sales because, although their 
technological capabilities may be obsolete, their stronger market 
capabilities may remain intact.
	
Managing innovation in OPE is particularly challenging because 
this technology is a pervasive technology that can be applied in a 
variety of industries and in multiple markets that are at different 
stages of development. For example, when OLED displays were 
produced at scale, OLED lighting was still being developed. Overall, 
the dynamics of competition are very different in different markets. 
OPE often offers new ways to produce devices similar to already 
existing ones. Therefore, competition is not only among companies 
developing and producing OLED but also against producers of the 
technology it could replace.
	
In fact, an interesting phenomenon is the acceleration of (often 
incremental) innovation in an incumbent technology as a response 
to the introduction of a new technology. This phenomenon known as 
the sailing ship effect refers to advances made in sailing ships in the 
second half of the 1800s in response to the introduction of steamships. 

617
In fact, in the 50 years after the introduction of steamships, sailing 
ships made more improvements than they had in the previous 300 
years. More in general, the sailing ship effect applies to situations 
in which an old technology is revitalized, experiencing a “last gasp” 
when faced with the risk of being replaced by a newer technology. 
Three possible explanations have been suggested as the cause of 
the sailing ship effect: (1) old technologies improve to avoid being 
replaced by the new ones, (2) components of new technology spill 
over and improve incumbent technologies, and (3) old technologies 
enjoy new notoriety generated by the new technologies. It may also 
occur if the new technology experiences delays in the emergence 
of a dominant design and in the development of economies of scale 
in the new technology. An example of this would be the significant 
improvements in LCD display technology over the last 20 years to 
close the gap on the expected advantages of the emerging OLED 
display technology.
14.3.3 Measuring Technology Developments: 
Technology Readiness Level Method
Innovations can be measured as having a market impact, for instance, 
using metrics such as market share, sales, or earnings. However, 
prior to that, one of the challenges in innovation management is to 
evaluate diverse technologies that are still in the development phase.
	
There are major qualitative and quantitative differences between 
technologies that are starting to show first results and technologies 
that are mature enough for introduction to industrial production at 
scale. For innovation managers, there is a need to quickly identify 
the maturation level, for example for financial and human resource 
allocation, without having to deal with complexities inherent in the 
technologies themselves.
	
Introduced originally by NASA in 1974, the technology readiness 
level (TRL) method is widely used to estimate the maturation level of 
a given project or technology. In 2014, the European Association of 
Research and Technology Organizations (EARTO) proposed a white 
paper recommending the use of TRL methods for public–private 
partnership project and strategic portfolio management in the EU. 
The EU Commission uses a TRL scale for the Horizon 2020 and its 
successor programs. The TRL level and the advancement of TRL are

key metrics for the evaluation of proposals and for the assessment 
of public projects, though that can have unintended consequences. 
Many large corporations use internal TRL scales adapted to their 

619
own specific needs. The technology maturation process is sequential 
and requires qualitative and quantitatively different competences 
and resources. The TRL scales are not linear in that respect: Moving 
from one level to another may require investments of a different 
order of magnitude. In the context of OPE, it is also important to 
note the concept of “system” in relation to the value chain. The TRL 
achieved by a material, production equipment, or subsystem usually 
needs to be higher, which is more mature than the TRL of a given 
integrated system. In general, it is important to clarify the nature of 
the system considered for the TRL evaluation.
	
Following the TRL methodology, we reach “system” or “product 
launch” in a market. However, there is a vast difference between a 
first-in-kind component on the market manufactured by a couple of 
small companies and a readily available component manufactured 
in a high volume and quality by a series of alternative suppliers. In 
order to assess the maturity of a given technology, components, or 
systems, the US Department of Defense introduced a similar metric 
indicator to the TRL: the manufacturing readiness levels (MRLs).
14.4 Developing Innovation Outside the 
Boundaries of a Single Organization: Open 
Innovation
As indicated earlier, sophisticated companies, typically large 
multinational organizations, developed tightly vertically integrated 
innovation models able to respond to market demands for new 
features (market pull) or to deploy (technology push) utilizing core 
functions from R&D to marketing and sales, either sequentially or in 
parallel. A very simplified vision of these processes is illustrated in 
Fig. 14.3a. In this approach, it is possible that a company, even a very 
large one, does not have internally all the assets and competencies 
required to develop a new product requested by the market. It is also 
possible that a successfully tested concept and a developed prototype 
in research and development do no longer fulfill the corporate 
market strategy. In the siloed or closed innovation paradigm, these 
new products are simply not matured and brought to market and 
the development projects are shelved with a corresponding loss of 
finance, time, IP, know-how, and market opportunity among others. 
Developing Innovation Outside the Boundaries of a Single Organization

620
Innovation Management and Organic and Printed Electronics
Originally formulated by Chesbrough [Reference] in the early 2000s, 
the concept of “Open Innovation” refers to companies that can spin 
out or, conversely, integrate solutions in their internal innovation 
processes that were originally developed by other companies or 
organizations. It is noteworthy that Open Innovation does not 
mean open or public in the sense of the Open Source movement. It 
often requires confidential and well-orchestrated negotiations to 
be successful. Open Innovation frameworks can lead to successful 
collaboration even across multiple partners and the formation of 
clusters or even ecosystems of companies and organizations.
Figure 14.3 (a) Closed and (b) Open Innovation.
14.5 Developing Innovation through 
Collaboration: Role of Ecosystems
One of the market growth challenges discussed earlier for OPE is the 
absence of system integrators and the silo approach of component 
developers, that is, the lack of an integrated manufacturer (in most 
segments) who can assemble all the different components and 
develop a device for the end-user. The OPE industry is addressing 
this challenge and barrier for commercialization by adopting an 
ecosystem strategy and collaborating with diverse partners to 
enable innovations. A business and innovation ecosystem consists of 
interdependent heterogeneous actors linked by either cooperative 
or competitive relationships, who are dependent on each other for 
their survival and success in developing new products and services. 

621
In a business and innovation ecosystem, organizations such as firms 
but also knowledge centers and public-funding agencies combine 
their individual offering and capabilities into a coherent customer-
facing solution.
	
The importance of building an ecosystem (or collaborative 
networks or value networks, as they are also called) varies across 
industries and tends to be critical for emerging technologies, 
owing to higher market and technological uncertainty, dynamism, 
complexity, and distributed nature of knowledge and increased 
interdependence with complementors.
	
An important characteristic of ecosystems is that they are not 
limited to particular industries and their boundaries are thus 
difficult to identify. Organizations that are part of a particular 
ecosystem may also belong to other networks and ecosystems at 
the same time. Loose coupling tends to be an important feature of 
successful innovation ecosystem. Participation in an ecosystem 
offers advantages such as reciprocal commitments from other 
members, shared vision, distributed cost, and a common fate. 
It enables the players to direct their efforts toward performing 
continuous innovation and establishing markets for their offerings 
rather than working on independent paths.
	
The ecosystem approach seems to be promising for rapid 
technology development and commercialization within OPE. It has 
been adopted especially by small- and medium-sized players who 
do specialize in specific knowledge areas but, at the same time, 
suffer from liability of newness and liability of adolescence and are 
constrained by limited financial and human resources.
	
A prominent example of the ecosystem approach is that of the 
firm TactoTek (Finland), which is presented and discussed next. 
TactoTek, founded in 2011, is a spin-off company from the VTT 
Technical Research Centre of Finland, a research and technology 
organization. TactoTek is an IP company that licenses IMSE® 
technology to third parties and transfers the technology and design 
know-how, including how to design and how to manufacture IMSE® 
parts, to designers and manufacturing companies of automotive, 
smart home, and other industries. TactoTek, with its forerunner 
manufacturing technology (IMSE®) injection molded structural 
electronics, aims at revolutionizing the way smart surfaces are 
designed, manufactured, and experienced. IMSE® integrates

printed electronics and conventional electronic components inside 
3D plastic parts (see Fig. 14.4). Embedding functionalities such as 
lighting, touch controls, antennas, and control electronics within 3D 
structures significantly reduces the thickness, weight, and number 
of parts and thus simplifies the whole assembly. It also brings unique 
design opportunities by enabling new form factors with different 
surface finishes for human–machine interfaces (HMI) and large-area 
surface lighting. With this additive technology, a lot of functionalities 
can be embedded in a thin and lightweight structure using much less 
plastics than in conventionally produced parts.
Figure 14.4 IMSE® overhead control panel (courtesy of TactoTek).
	
The ecosystem approach to innovation plays a key role in the 
company. TactoTek and its ecosystem are continuously raising 
awareness and developing IMSE® technology to bring attractive 
smart surface solutions to the market. In Fig. 14.5, TactoTek’s global 
ecosystem is shown at a high level. The overall network ecosystem 
is divided into the following main parts: Application, Design and 
Manufacturing, Circularity, Standardization, Financial, Technology, 
and Research.
	
In the Application Ecosystem, TactoTek closely collaborates 
with the global market leaders in automotive, smart home, and 
other industries to build the complete value chain and ecosystem 
consisting of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), design and 
engineering companies, and mass-manufacturing companies.

623
	
In the Design and Manufacturing Ecosystem, design and 
engineering companies design smart surfaces to meet the needs of 
OEMs. TactoTek and its partners work closely with OEMs to expand 
awareness of IMSE® solutions and to transform the visions of OEMs 
into reality by using IMSE® technology. System or component 
manufacturing companies are the ones that license the technology 
and manufacture the actual parts.
	
In the Technology Ecosystem, the company codevelops with its 
global partners functionalities, new materials, and components as 
well as the manufacturing technologies required for IMSE®. Also, the 
company creates new design tool functionalities and develops new 
testing methods. Furthermore, TactoTek is a member of alliances 
such as ISELED in which the objective is to develop complete system 
solution for innovative automotive lighting. 
	
In the Standardization Ecosystem, TactoTek is active in 
standardization work to accelerate the industrial exploitation and 
technology competitiveness of structural electronics. TactoTek is a 
member of standardization organizations such as the International 
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the Association Connecting 
Electronics (IPC) and works on creating new standards with the 
industry for the design, validation, and manufacturing of structural 
electronics.
	
In the Research Ecosystem, the company collaborates with global 
research institutes and universities in selected research areas. Also, 
TactoTek is a member of several associations and industry clusters 
such as the Organic Electronics Association (OE-A), PrintoCent

TactoTek focuses on reducing the environmental impact of its 
IMSE® technology from the product design through the end of life. 
Key aspects include: how to design and manufacture IMSE® even 
more energy efficiently using less materials; how to integrate recycled 
and/or biobased materials into IMSE®; how to design IMSE® parts 
that they are easier to recycle; and finally, how to recycle IMSE® in 
an economically viable way. From a recyclability viewpoint, IMSE® 
is not an optimal technology as we are integrating functionalities 
inside 3D single-piece parts. In the circularity ecosystem, we are

14.5.1 Challenges of Innovating within an Ecosystem
Whereas the ecosystem approach enables continuous innovation 
due to increased cooperation, the formation of an innovation 
ecosystem is not without risks, and even if alliances can mitigate risk, 
organizations struggle to get value out of their alliance portfolios. Due 
to increased interconnectedness that characterizes the ecosystem, 
the challenges do not reside only within the integrator firm but are 
also related to technological barriers offered by other component 
providers as well.
	
As increased complexity and uncertainty surround the final 
product, the technology provided by partners and component 
providers in the ecosystem might be developing at a different 
rate than desired. A change in one part of the system may trigger 
changes throughout and hamper the success of the final innovation, 
slowing the overall pace of technology development and finally 
resulting in lost opportunity. Constraints in the ecosystem, however, 
are not only technological; there are other relational challenges 

625
such as opportunistic behavior by the partners; lack of motivation, 
transparency, reciprocity, and trust; misalignment of goals and 
objectives; and changes in priorities during the collaboration. These 
constraining interdependencies of one or more alliance partners 
have a negative influence on the performance of entire ecosystems 
and restrict knowledge transfer among partners.
14.6 Considerations for Commercialization
It is not our intention in this section to provide detailed analysis and 
recommendations concerning all the issues that should be considered 
before and during the commercialization of OPE technologies but 
rather to provide an overview of those that are particularly relevant.
14.6.1 Market Dynamics in the Face of Uncertainty
OPE actors often attempt at developing new technologies for new 
markets. New products based on new technologies are, in general, 
characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, both technological 
and commercial. Innovating companies face uncertainty about 
developing a new product that will work and perform better than the 
incumbent product; they also cannot always tell whether consumers 
will be willing to buy the novel product. This double uncertainty 
has a strong impact on the investments that companies, financial 
institutions, and venture capitalists are willing to commit resources 
in new technology-based activities. On the other hand, even once 
the necessary financial resources have been made available, early 
adopters of the new technologies are crucial to further progress as 
they will allow increasing production and, therefore, economies of 
scale that will make the new product more affordable and attractive 
to other adopters and allow incremental improvements in the new 
technology, which again may make it more attractive to other buyers.
	
These technological and market uncertainties are evident in 
the case of OPE. Despite the initial hype and promises, participants 
in the industry have not been able to find niche markets or killer 
applications and meet the initial expectations of the actors, and 
it has been argued that, despite having developed sophisticated 
knowledge of organic electronic materials, the industry appears 
Considerations for Commercialization

626
Innovation Management and Organic and Printed Electronics
more like silicon in the 1960s than silicon today, and a shorter 
development time should not be expected.
	
Uncertainty about technological developments in the field of 
OPE increases the risks for actors to commit resources long term. 
This translates into a situation where actors are waiting for the other 
parts of the system to be developed. Lack of articulated demand 
inherent in the creation of radically new products and the differences 
across sectors exacerbate the situation. Key actors such as material 
suppliers and printing equipment manufacturers anticipate changes 
in their current business models but are reluctant to move.
14.6.2 Testing Business Assumptions
OPE is a new way of making electronic devices. For the most part, 
OPE devices offer the same broad functionality as conventional 
electronics: displays, lighting, sensors, logic, photovoltaics, etc. 
Neglecting for the moment the question of manufacturing cost, 
which usually has a strong dependence on production scale, OPE 
offers a different value proposition from conventional electronics. 
The form factor may be thin, lightweight, and, in some cases, flexible 
or conformable. Glass is often a substrate of choice, owing to its 
excellent flatness, temperature resistance, and barrier properties. 
Tunability of performance may be achieved through optimizing the 
molecular design of organic materials. Individual customizability 
may be achieved if digital (maskless) manufacturing techniques are 
used, such as inkjet printing or direct-write patterning techniques. 
Other benefits may include low-production energy needs, low capital 
cost for a manufacturing process, environmentally benign materials, 
and large-area deployment where electronic functionality may be 
printed on surfaces separated by very large distances compared 
with a silicon wafer or a printed circuit board or a sheet of display 
glass. When assessing a new business opportunity that is proposed 
for an OPE implementation, it is essential to articulate clearly why 
OPE should be used over conventional electronics: the “why OPE” 
question. If there is no compelling reason why OPE can offer better 
value than conventional electronics, then it is almost certain that it 
will be cheaper and faster to implement a solution in conventional 
electronics.

627
14.6.3 Developing Dynamic Capabilities
Having a strong or superior technology does not guarantee 
commercial success. It is important to maintain full awareness of the 
products being developed by competitors and be able to respond 
quickly to unexpected changes in the industry. Sometimes this is 
not enough and a fast second mover may launch a more successful 
(cheaper and/or better) product than the original one launched by 
the first mover.
	
Konarka, a highly prominent start-up with a focus on solution-
processed OPV, was founded in 2001, raised over $170 million 
during its life, including from major energy companies, built a 
factory able to produce 1 GW of photovoltaics. Its strategy was 
to build volume from early niche products and, using its low-cost 
manufacturing processes, to coat the active materials on cheap 
plastic such that it would be able to undercut the cost of electricity 
production of silicon photovoltaics (the incumbent). In hindsight, 
several points played against Konarka. First, it was a pioneer and 
front runner in the field of OPV and, therefore, had to build most of 
its technology from R&D to production and develop its business from 
scratch. Second, it relied on early generation and active materials, 
which had relatively low efficiency and a short lifetime. Finally, and 
critically, there was an unprecedented drop of around 3× in the price 
of silicon-based modules from 2007 to 2011 such that Konarka’s 
cost target advantage was all but eliminated, making further 
investment extremely challenging based on its early-day narrative 
and investors’ expectations. Konarka, together with many other 
photovoltaic-manufacturing companies of both conventional and 
thin-film technologies, experienced the fallout from the unexpected 
and dramatic impact of photovoltaic market dynamics and finally 
filed for bankruptcy in 2012.
	
That was not the end of OPV’s story, however. Konarka’s IP 
assets were acquired by Merck KGaA in Germany, a major chemical 
company, and the same year Belectric acquired key OPV assets 
through Konarka’s German subsidiary. Not only the technology 
survived, but also it was developed further and rebranded under the 
name of Opvius. In 2019, the French group ARMOR acquired Opvius 
and continued the development of technology, production, and 
markets from intelligent building façades to autonomous devices. A

Innovation Management and Organic and Printed Electronics
decade after Konarka’s bankruptcy, OPV is produced on at least two 
continents and is still developing, though differently than originally 
envisioned, for instance, as a low-carbon energy production 
technology with unique design added value.
	
Plastic Logic, like Konarka, was also an early pioneer of organic 
electronics and developed a flexible transistor backplane technology 
to drive bistable black-and-white displays for the new eReader 
market. Its first product, the Que, boasted a large screen size with 
touch capability, physical robustness, good outdoor readability, and 
long battery life. It was announced at the Consumer Electronics 
Show (CES) in January 2010. Some three months later, Apple 
launched the iPad, effectively creating the tablet category. Although 
the iPad did not have such a large screen, such a long battery life, 
or such good outdoor readability, it performed well as an eReader 
and additionally was a high-performance computing tool with a 
very high-quality, touch-sensitive, video-rate color display and, 
significantly, was cheaper than the Que. In August 2010, Plastic 
Logic withdrew the Que, without having shipped a single device. The 
introduction of the iPad completely changed the market landscape. 
Pure eReader device sales peaked in 2011 and have been reducing 
since then. Plastic Logic changed its business model and focused 
on new opportunities. Plastic Logic still exists in 2022 and is fully 
devoted to customized electrophoretic displays (EPD) for a variety 
of applications from smart cards to wearables, to digital signages.
	
Both these examples illustrate the need for market vigilance and 
the ability to change direction quickly should the unexpected occur. 
Innovation cannot be easily predicted and needs to be managed.
14.6.4 Supplying a System
We have already discussed the importance of developing an 
ecosystem with other suppliers so that a complete product system 
may be brought together comprising multiple functional parts each 
supplied by a leader in the provision of those parts. An important 
question for every new commercial venture is how to define its 
participation strategy in the markets it chooses to serve. Will it 
supply a single component to a system integrator? Will it supply 
a subsystem comprising some of its own technology and some 
technology components brought in from other suppliers? Will it 

629
supply complete systems to a product company? Will it supply 
complete products to an end-user? Will it provide some element of a 
service offering with or without an accompanying product?
	
In OPE, as in many other technologies, the components and 
devices produced often reside in a larger system. Even large-area 
products such as photovoltaic or lighting, which would at first 
appear to be single-function products, are almost always supplied 
with other system components: For a photovoltaic product, as well 
as the photovoltaic element itself, there may well be an electronic 
protection circuit to stop damage to the device, there may be a circuit 
to enable the device to operate at its maximum power point, there 
may be a voltage converter to increase the output voltage, there may 
be a charge store (battery or supercapacitor), and there may also 
be some circuitry to enable safe and efficient charging of the charge 
store. Then there is the mechanical mounting or deployment of the 
device and its electrical connection system that must be designed. 
With all these system components, the prospective supplier must 
consider whether it will supply the single component, a subsystem, a 
fully working but unpackaged system, or a full product. If it chooses 
to sell only a part of the full system, then it must work with its 
partners to ensure that all the system parts work well together and 
that the integrator knows how to get the best out of the system. With 
more complex systems, such as wireless sensing labels, the end-user 
may simply require a roll of labels that can be attached to product 
packaging using conventional converting equipment and may not 
be interested in manufacturing the labels. A system on a label must 
then be supplied, and if there is no obvious integration company in 
the supply chain to assemble all the system elements onto the label, 
this becomes a key barrier to commercialization. This particular 
issue has been widely recognized in the OPE industry, where there 
are currently relatively few integrators. An increasing number of 
interventions by government through R&D support are enabling this 
gap to be closed.
	
Once a company has decided where it will participate in the 
value chain and when it has understood the boundaries of the 
system that the end customer requires and the price the end 
customer is prepared to pay for the system, it is possible to assess 
where the system value is really created and whether the company 
can secure suitable returns on its investment. At this point, it can 
Considerations for Commercialization

630
Innovation Management and Organic and Printed Electronics
become apparent that more value could be captured if the company 
is willing to enlarge its offering to include more value-generating 
parts of the system. Which strategy to adopt will depend on the 
firm’s capabilities, as well as the opportunity itself. A company may 
decide to change its capabilities by the acquisition of staff or even a 
business if it feels it cannot participate in the best opportunity due 
to the mismatch of capability, or it could consider outsourcing part 
of its operation to a partner with the right capability. Continuing, 
then, with the photovoltaic example, it may become apparent that 
rather than supplying just the photovoltaic element to a system 
integrator, it may be much more commercially attractive to supply 
the photovoltaic element and a thin rechargeable battery attached 
to it. The company may then decide to source a suitable battery from 
a partner and develop the attachment and connection processes to 
produce the new system component.
14.6.5 Business Model Selection
The selection of its business model is a key step for a new company. 
For OPE businesses, where there is often a significant physical 
technology content, the three most common choices are:
	
1.	 Manufacture and sell goods based on the new technology.
	
2.	 Develop the new technology to the point that capability to 
manufacture at production scale has been demonstrated and 
license the manufacturing process to companies that wish to 
manufacture themselves.
	
3.	 Develop the technology to the point that the technology has 
been demonstrated (at a small scale) to be able to provide 
the anticipated performance and/or cost benefits and 
then license the technology (patents or know-how) to a 
manufacturing company that has the capability to both scale-
up and manufacture the new technology.
	
The pros and cons of the three options relate significantly to the 
following dimensions:
	
∑	 Investment and resource required (with investment for 1 > 2 
> 3)
	
∑	 Time required (with time to money of 1 longer than 2 longer 
than 3)

631
	
∑	 Return on investment, dependent on the specifics of the 
opportunity being considered
	
If a company happens to be in an established business that already 
owns a suitable or nearly suitable manufacturing plant, option 1 
could be a very good choice. If, however, it is a new business, in the 
current business climate, it can be difficult to raise venture capital for 
building a manufacturing line (option 1) and so it may be pragmatic 
to consider either to outsource manufacturing to someone else 
(buy versus make) or to use someone else’s manufacturing line for 
development activities to the point that the technical risk is reduced 
sufficiently that venture capital may be raised or a licensing deal 
may be done (option 2). Option 3 requires much less investment, but 
because of the relatively higher level of risk required by licensees 
versus option 2, the returns are likely to be significantly lower.
	
In some cases, there is a fourth option that may apply, particularly 
to new businesses that are still working out what their business 
will do and in which markets they will participate. This involves 
supplying high-value custom products employing the technology. 
Each product is customized to the specific needs of the individual 
customer (usually a large company), and because volumes are very 
small, products can be made by hand or at least using very small-
scale manufacturing equipment. This can be an attractive way to start 
a new business, because it generates early revenue, provides early 
experience of real customers and their market needs, and enables 
a much more accurate determination of where the value of the new 
technology or product concept really lies. Some businesses that start 
life in this project consultancy mode change to a manufacturing 
mode once they understand where the profitable opportunities lie 
in particular markets.
	
Many books have been written on the topic of business model 
selection, and the reader is referred to them for more detail. (See, for 
example, The Innovator’s Solution, by Christensen and Raynor.)
14.6.6 Intellectual Property
For OPE businesses, in which there is often a significant new 
technology element, IP strategy becomes an important consideration. 
Registered and legally protected IP rights include patents, which 
cover technological novelty; registered designs, which cover the 
Considerations for Commercialization

632
Innovation Management and Organic and Printed Electronics
external appearance of a technology; and trademarks, which cover 
the commercial aspects of a technology (e.g., its brand name, logo, 
color). Elements of the IP strategy will include, at a minimum, applying 
for patents to protect a business and estimating the “freedom to 
operate” in a given market sector. Creating, accessing, leveraging, 
and exploiting IP are core elements of strategic management for 
Open Innovation and innovation in collaborative ecosystem settings.
	
A business can be protected by stopping others from copying 
a proprietary technology. A patent is a right that prevents use of 
inventions developed by others and thus creates a strong economic 
incentive for innovation. Broad patent coverage of key enabling 
inventions adds significant value to a business because it provides 
a competitive edge. Patents are also business assets in their own 
right and may be bought and sold or licensed. Filing, securing, and 
maintaining patents are expensive, so it is best to focus on those 
inventions that uniquely enable significant commercial value, for 
example, through large cost reduction or substantially improved 
performance. Inventions that can be easily circumvented provide 
little value unless all routes to circumvention add a significant cost.
	
“Freedom to operate” refers to a situation where a business may 
sell products and services without infringing third-party patents or 
design rights or trademarks. Simply owning patents on an invention 
that is being used in a product does not mean that a company is not 
inadvertently using an invention in its product that has already been 
patented by someone else. To ensure that a business has freedom to 
operate, it is usual practice to employ a patent specialist to conduct a 
freedom-to-operate search once the key elements of the product and 
process are known. If a piece of prior art is identified in the search 
with claims that fall directly onto a feature of the product to be sold 
or the processes used to make it or its function in use, several options 
arise, likely including the following elements. First of all, investigate 
whether the patent in question is still in force and that it is in force 
in the jurisdiction of planned sales or manufacturing. If the patent 
is in force, investigate whether it can be avoided, for example, by 
redesigning the product or changing the manufacturing process or 
by using it in a different way. Alternatively, investigate whether the 
patent is valid. If it can be shown that the relevant claim is invalid, it 
can be ignored. A common way to do this is by finding an example in 
the public domain of the same invention being practiced anywhere 
in the world before the patent’s priority date.

633
	
If there are no other options, it may be necessary to take a license 
from the patent holder. This often involves payment of a royalty on 
goods sold. It is outside the scope of this text to go into this topic in 
detail; and it is strongly recommended that professional advice be 
taken regarding IP and IP strategy matters.
14.6.7 Maximizing Resources and Value through 
Ecosystem Networks
14.6.7.1 Networks
We have already discussed the commercial loss that can occur if a 
product is too late to market. A new business venture can save time 
if it does not attempt to do everything itself. By focusing only on the 
most important areas to keep in house and working with partners 
for other things, it is possible to move more quickly and with fewer 
resources required. It can, therefore, be valuable to make the most 
of networks.
Figure 14.6 From single organizations to ecosystems.
	
The protected core assets of a company include trade secrets as 
well as strategic know-how assets and processes necessary for the 
survival of the organization, which need to remain secret. Restricted 
assets, which may be granted conditional access to external companies, 
for example, via licensing and strategic partnerships agreements, 
include IP, know-how, and services such as access to fabrication 
facilities. Tradable assets include marketed services and products. 
Considerations for Commercialization

634
Innovation Management and Organic and Printed Electronics
The higher the mutual business trust between organizations, the 
higher the level of collaboration and the possibility to trade deeper 
level assets. From a functional perspective, an effective network of 
(SME) organizations can be considered larger, a “virtual” company 
in which functions such as research, development, pilot production, 
and marketing can be provided by one or more companies that share 
and optimize risks and benefits.
	
In April 2016, the European Commission presented the Digitizing 
European Industry (DEI) strategy. As key instruments to implement 
to this strategy, Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) were launched, 
aligning different projects in various digital technology areas under 
the Smart Anything Everywhere1 initiative (H2020, 7 years). The 
overall objective was to ensure that any industry in Europe—big 
or small, regardless of location or sector—could fully benefit from 
digital innovation to upgrade its products, improve its processes, 
and adapt its business models to the digital age.
	
The impact for the OPE sector was the establishment of two 
successive DIH projects funded on OPE technologies, such as 
SmartEEs/OLAE (2018–20) and SmartEEs2/flexible and wearable 
electronics (FWE) (2020–22). Innovation services were set during 
the project period and demonstrated through innovative third-party 
business cases selected via an Open Call (Application Experiments 
[AEs]). These innovation services included technologies, business 
development, and access to funding (cascade funding from EC to 
DIHs to third parties). All in all, €4.1 million funding was applied 
to 63 AEs on two types of experiments involving prototyping and 
support for manufacturing.
	
Furthermore, a community of service providers and service users 
was set and built up at regional level within an already established 
European ecosystem of public/private stakeholders and networks 
(e.g., the OE-A at international level, AFELIM in France, PrintoCent in 
Finland). A digital platform2 was developed, showcasing a technical 
marketplace with a globally unique list of validated FWE products, 
prototypes, and technical services and corresponding to the state-of-
the-art applications in organic photovoltaics, flexible displays, OLED 
lighting, electronics and components, and integrated smart systems. 
The platform gives the owners of these services the opportunity to 
1https://smartanythingeverywhere.eu/
2https://ecosystem.smartees2.eu/

635
promote their capabilities inside a community and to connect with 
the component and system suppliers, manufacturers, integrators, 
distributors, and end-users.
	
The platform also offers a business marketplace for 
complementary innovation services, including access to different 
educational materials (videos, trends reports, webinars, etc.) as well 
as an organization registry for the FWE community. A legal entity—
the European Flexible and Wearable Association3 (international 
non-profit association)—was created in order to sustain the DIH 
action beyond the EU-funded project. Its core mission is to boost 
the efficiency and effectiveness of the European FWE innovation 
ecosystem. Inspired by pioneering business explorations by 
early adopters in the SmartEEs projects, now even more actors 
and companies can extend FWE adoption to new businesses and 
markets, either providing or utilizing innovation services as clients 
or members of the association. The services have been gathered 
under one single and comprehensive portfolio covering research, 
development, and innovation (RDI) and business development, 
access to finance, education and training, and guidance on electronics 
for a green and circular economy.
	
Other similar OPE networks exist around the world (for instance, 
Korean Printed Electronics Association (KoPEA) in South Korea or 
the Semi Flextech initiative in the United States) and provide a great 
opportunity to meet potential industrial partners and intermediate 
technology organizations that may provide access to pilot-scale 
manufacturing lines.
14.6.7.2 Finance
In the early stages of developing a new business venture, it is 
particularly important to maximize the impact of the limited financial 
resources available. We have already discussed the value of working 
with partners in an ecosystem, and it is important to emphasize the 
value of contracts, especially in the period of technology development 
prior to product sales, from other companies in the value chain and 
from potential end-users, not only as a source of income, but also 
because they provide significant information about end-user and 
value-chain partner requirements and this, in turn, may be used to

Considerations for Commercialization

636
Innovation Management and Organic and Printed Electronics
refine business plans and technology development targets. It is often 
possible to involve the end customer in a specification or validation 
role. The financial support for such projects significantly de-risks 
the venture for all partners and provides a vehicle to assess how well 
the consortium can work together prior to procurement and joint 
venture contracts being signed.
	
Other areas where some national governments provide support 
include:
 
∑	 Capital grants or tax arrangements in support of manufacturing 
investment
 
∑ 	Research and development tax credits
 
∑	 Funding to enable companies to work with universities or 
to transfer staff between companies and universities for 
dissemination of knowledge
 
∑	 Public procurement, for example, for health service or the 
military
	
Finally, there are a number of charitable foundations, such as 
the Gates Foundation, which provide funds for particular areas of 
global need or health research charities that have particular aims 
and objectives.
14.6.8 Public Policy Initiatives
Since OPE is considered an enabling technology with significant 
potential to create commercial value and jobs, there has been 
increasing financial support from government, venture capital, and 
other organizations such as the National Science Foundation (USA), 
the Department of Energy (USA), the Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency (DARPA, USA), and the New Energy and Industrial 
Technology Development Organization (NEDO) in Japan.
	
The historical and current frameworks of institutional 
funding designed to promote the development and uptake of new 
technologies with economic, societal, and environmental impacts 
via private/public collaborative actions comprise several RDI 
international funding programs. We focus here on the European 
space, as an example.
	
Within Europe, multi-annual framework programs such as 
the FP6, FP7, H2020, and Horizon Europe (HE) existed in their 

637
own right and synergize significantly with individual national 
framework programs and their funding. Specifically, OPE innovation 
was covered by the programs of Information and Communication 
Technologies (H2020), Digital, Industry and Space (HE), and Key 
Digital Technologies (joint undertaking between industry and EC). 
From the perspective of electronics, OPE funding is also covered 
under the topics of Thin, Organic, and Large-Area Electronics 
(TOLAE) (H2020) and FWE (HE).
	
Regarding the instruments used to actualize the innovation, there 
is a range of complementary funding support. Funding in four main 
areas can accelerate the maturation of technologies and usher them 
into the market more efficiently. Supporting research with funding 
is key, from redefining a precise theoretical basis to validating 
the principles with lab experiments. Funding the potential for 
experimenting with innovative practices and techniques and their 
demonstration within actual industrial environments is the next 
crucial instrument. Finally, in the industry, there must be funding 
for implementing accompanying measures such as standardization, 
dissemination, awareness raising, networking, communication, 
and policy dialogues (coordination and support actions). Without 
communication and common approaches, time and resources are 
wasted and lost.
	
Another arm of funding is directed in a service-oriented capacity 
and supportive of third parties, for instance, related SMEs. Proper 
funding ensures these actors can implement individualized business 
models to mutualize and access manufacturing capacities for OLEDs 
and hybrid electronics. Examples in Europe include pilot lines such 
as Lyteus4 for OLEDs or Inscope5 for hybrid electronics.
	
Funding for instruments such as DIHs sets up (discussed earlier), 
demonstrates, and delivers innovation services to accelerate the 
digital transition of the industry for, among others, SMEs and midcap 
companies. SmartEEs–SmartEEs26 is a successful case in point here. 
Taking over and capitalizing upon the project-driven DIH instrument 
(2014–20) is the recently set regional instrument European Digital 
Innovation Hubs (EDIHs), which facilitate service import and export 
between regions and across borders. These hubs roll out innovation

Innovation Management and Organic and Printed Electronics
services at a regional level and yet are part of a concerted effort at 
a pan-European vision for innovation. Minasmart and Polytronics 
are examples of two upcoming EDIHs in France that will implement 
innovation services around digital technologies, including OPE.
	
Increasingly and justifiably, environmental impact plays a 
major role in the trajectory of industrial innovation. A vision paper 
was issued7 as part of a coordination and support action funded 
by the European Commission (CSA type of funding), which states 
how essential and urgent it is to understand the role and mitigate 
associated environmental and societal risks of electronics in a 
transition toward a circular economy and a low-carbon society. 
The paper welcomes the commitment of the EC to adopt a new 
circular economy action plan and create a new industrial strategy 
for Europe, which acknowledges and addresses the interlinked 
challenges of green and digital transformation. It also supports the 
development of an ambitious sustainable product policy, including a 
Circular Electronics Initiative. Hence, contribution to the Green Deal 
and other funding dedicated to environmental concerns is poised to 
become a larger deciding factor in all branches of implementation 
(see Chapter 13 for sustainable aspects of OPE). Examples include

development 
initiatives are pursued by associations, prominent ones being OE-A, 
Photonics 21, IPC Printed Electronics Management Council steering 
committee, Printed Electronics Arena (PEA), FlexTech Alliance, 
KoPEA, Japan Advanced Printed Electronics Technology Research 
Association (JAPERA), and iNEMI. Chapter 15 gives a perspective on 
roadmapping for the OPE sector.
	
Developing standards is key for the establishment of robust 
industrial developments and enables effective collaboration across 
value chains. In 2011, the IEC TC119 initiative was launched to 
address standardization within the space of printed electronics. 
Initial activity in this domain started in 2004 and was established 
within the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (IEEE), 
which resulted in the development of the IEEE 1620™ and IEEE 
1620.1™ standards.

Finally, various and increasingly numerous events bring the 
OPE players together on common platforms, create awareness, 
promote collaboration, and build a supply chain. Trade shows 
and conferences, such as LOPE-C, are organized at national and 
international levels by international organizations such as the 
OE-A, by national organizations such as PrintoCent and AFELIM, 
or by consultants such as IDtechX. Increasingly, online events and 
resources are available to the various OPE actors, which widen the 
scope for building and maintaining ecosystems.
14.7 Conclusion
Radical innovation and emerging technologies are crucial for the 
development of the economy and the growth of an organization but 
require a long period of development and large investment in terms 
of financial capital. This has been the theme of organic electronics 
as well that lifetime and performance issues are often addressed 
by materials development over a period of years. In the case of 
OLED displays, it took over 30 years from the first publication of 
the bilayer OLED device in the mid-1980s to the passing of the $10 
billion market size milestone in the mid-2010s.
	
Challenges faced by emerging technologies such as OPE include 
the “sailing ship” effect, managing the maturity (TRL, supply 
chain), level of diverse components and end-product integration, 
and producing reliably at scale and at cost points competitive with 
sizable markets.
	
Innovation is dependent not only on cross-functional integration 
within a company’s internal innovation processes, but also on close 
collaborations with external actors such as customers (or users), 
suppliers, commercial partners, and sources of technology and 
know-how (universities and research and technology organizations) 
in open and ecosystem innovation settings. The role of ecosystems 
in OPE innovation was and continue to be important.
	
Developing dynamic capabilities enhances chances of survival. 
Having strong or superior technology does not guarantee commercial 
success. It is important to maintain full awareness of products 
being developed by competitors and be able to respond quickly to 
unexpected changes in the industry.
Conclusion

Innovation Management and Organic and Printed Electronics
	
The development of OPE seems to fit very well with this systemic 
and distributed view of innovation within an ecosystem made of a 
variety of partners due to the complex nature of this technology and 
the multiplicity of potential applications.
	
Whereas the ecosystem approach enables continuous innovation 
due to increased cooperation, the formation of an innovation 
ecosystem is not without risks.
	
Constraints in the ecosystem are both technological and relational, 
such as opportunistic behavior by the partners; lack of motivation, 
transparency, reciprocity, and trust; misalignment of goals and 
objectives; and changes in priorities during the collaboration.

Roadmapping: General Principles and Application to Organic and Printed Electronics
ecosystems. In this chapter, we want to look at what the organic 
electronics community sees as perspectives for the field and the 
challenges to be encountered to get there. This kind of exercise is 
called roadmapping and is a key activity in many fields, not just 
organic electronics. In this chapter, we want to both explain the basic 
concepts and approaches of technology roadmapping and show how 
these concepts have been applied by the members of the Organic 
Electronics Association to develop a roadmap for the field of organic 
and printed electronics.
	
In the first part of this chapter, we explain what roadmapping 
is and why it is used. In addition, we summarize approaches to 
and levels of analysis in technology roadmapping. We then discuss 
the particularities involved in roadmapping such a diverse field as 
organic and printed electronics, and how the approach can change 
with increasing maturity of a technology. Finally, we demonstrate 
these concepts by summarizing the results of the eighth edition 
of the roadmap developed by the Organic and Printed Electronics 
Association (OE-A),1 an international industrial association with 
over 200 industrial and academic organizations as members. The 
OE-A has been preparing roadmaps since 2005; to our knowledge, 
this is the longest continuing public roadmapping project in the 
field. This chapter is an adaptation of the executive summary and 
white paper for the eighth edition of the roadmap, published in 2020 
(OE-A 2020), and is used with permission and support of the OE-A.
15.1 What is Roadmapping?
15.1.1 Basic Concepts of Roadmapping
Especially in fields where technology development and applications 
are changing, it is important to gain an understanding of the past 
and present situations and to apply this to make some predictions 
of future developments and challenges in the field. Since the result 
of this process is a kind of map for where the field is going and 
critical work that needs to be done, this process is referred to as 
roadmapping.
1www.oe-a.org

647
What Is Roadmapping?
	
One of the added values of roadmaps is that they create a shared 
common vision of the present state, an attainable future state, and 
the key enablers and roadblocks along the way. This is especially 
important in complex industries in which many different players 
need to continuously align their internal development. The roadmap 
can provide a collective guidance, and each single actor devises ways 
to align with the future expectations. In the most extreme cases 
(e.g., the semiconductor roadmap), the common shared vision can 
function as a self-fulfilling prophecy: Companies need to raise their 
capabilities as they expect their competitors will as well.
	
Organic electronics is still a nascent industry, which has enormous 
potential, but for which many applications are only beginning to 
enter the market or be prepared for the market, and which has 
undergone many changes—and will continue to do so as the field 
develops. Roadmapping is particularly important for stakeholders 
in the field, although the broad and novel nature of the field creates 
some challenges, as we will see.
	
Roadmapping is an established process in technology industries, 
and two of the best known ones are the International Technology 
Roadmap for Semiconductors (until 2015), later International 
Roadmap for Devices and Systems, and Photovoltaic and Solar 
Forecasting Report compiled in the framework of the International 
Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems Program (IEA-PVPS 
2013).2 The roadmapping is done by stakeholders in the industry; 
some key tasks are to (1) show the current state of the technology 
and how it has developed since the last edition, (2) use this to 
envision plausible future developments and demands, and (3) 
identify the developments that cannot be achieved with a simple 
linear extrapolation of the development to date.
	
Technology roadmapping is a strategic planning support tool for 
researchers, developers, managers, etc. to match future technical 
development with future envisioned product needs. Recently, 
Chakraborthy et al. (2022) presented the following definition of a 
technology roadmap: “Technology-roadmapping (TRM) is a flexible 
method in which the main goal is to assist strategic planning in 
market, product, and technology development in an integrated 
way over time.” Within this very broad definition, there are many 
2http://www.iea-pvps.org

648
Roadmapping: General Principles and Application to Organic and Printed Electronics
variations. A roadmap may be developed within a single organization 
for a specific product or product range, or may be developed on 
an industry-wide scale for an entire industry sector, such as the 
International Roadmap for Devices and Systems, mentioned earlier 
(IRDS 2021). In any case, we are talking here primarily about 
industry-related roadmapping, rather than academic roadmapping, 
although the technical and scientific questions raised by the process 
can be equally relevant to academic researchers.
	
Although a technology roadmap clearly looks at the predicted 
development of technology and thus has a strong technical 
component, the development is looked at from the point of view of 
future products. Therefore, it is critical to keep future applications 
and products in mind as the core goal and to remember that, for the 
purposes of most technology roadmaps, the technology is there to 
serve the purpose of future products and services, not for its own 
sake. However, a clear understanding of the expected or envisioned 
path of technology development is critical for understanding where 
there are major challenges to be met and thus where additional 
focus and/or fully new technology will be needed to enable the 
targeted products. In some roadmaps, these major challenges have 
been referred to as “red brick walls,” as they could stop further 
development cold if a significant breakthrough is not achieved.
	
A well-developed roadmap can offer significant advantages to a 
broad range of stakeholders:
 
∑	 Product developers can adjust their plans to expected 
technology development and/or put additional resources into 
solving the expected problems.
 
∑	 Funding agencies receive useful input on where it will be 
necessary to support research and development more 
strongly.
 
∑	 Companies focusing on R&D receive important input on where 
to focus their endeavors.
 
∑	 Academic researchers also receive insight into important 
problems still seeking solutions.
15.1.2 Approaches and Levels
Chakraborthy recently published a systematic review of industry-
level roadmapping covering a wide range of industries, including 

649
What Is Roadmapping?
semiconductors, solar cells, and health care, among others 
(Chakraborthy 2022). Kirchmeyer (2016) reviewed the basic 
concepts of roadmapping as well and applied them in more detail 
to the sixth edition of the OE-A Roadmap for Organic and Printed 
Electronics. In theory, a roadmap starts from markets at the top 
level, then proceeds to products, then to technology, which works 
relatively well for established markets. In the case of emerging 
technologies, markets may not exist until the technology is mature 
enough to address these markets. As a result, roadmaps for such 
technologies may initially be quite “technology-driven”; the potential 
of the emerging technology for novel products may be understood, 
but it is difficult to predict just what these products could be and 
what markets they may address. This was the case for early editions 
of the OE-A Roadmap. However, in the classical case, the hierarchy 
starts with markets at the top, as shown in Fig. 15.1, taken from 
Kirchmeyer (2016).
	
Another difference between roadmaps of mature and emerging 
technologies can be related to the interpretation of “technology.” 
For advanced technology fields, this frequently refers to specific 
product-related technology; e.g., for novel flat-panel displays, this 
may mean OLED or electrochromic display technology. However, 
especially in newer fields, a more basic level of technology needs to 
be considered, which was referred to in OE-A Roadmaps as “enabling 
technology.” This includes topics such as new functional materials; 
developments in printing, coating, and patterning technology; 
substrate materials; barrier films; and basic device understanding. 
In both basic and applied technology, there can be a wide range 
of technology readiness levels (TRLs) (discussed in Chapter 14) 
within one technology. Topics at a lower TRL tend, in general, to be 
researched more at academic or research organization labs, while 
works at a higher TRL tend to be performed more in companies. 
Sometimes, the roadmap can help clarify what is needed to progress 
to a higher TRL.
	
In the rest of this chapter, we will use the OE-A Roadmap as a 
case study. We will first see how the roadmap approach has changed 
over the years with the maturing of the industry and moved from a 
strong focus on technology to an increasing emphasis on markets 
and expected opportunities and will present how the roadmap 

650
Roadmapping: General Principles and Application to Organic and Printed Electronics
work was done and coordinated. Then we will look at the results 
of the process as published in the most recent eighth edition of 
the roadmap.
Figure 15.1 Common hierarchical scheme for technology roadmapping. 
Source: Adapted from Kirchmeyer (2016).
15.2 Roadmapping for Organic Electronics
The first edition of the OE-A Roadmap was published in 2005 and has 
been updated multiple times, most recently with the eighth edition 
in 2020. During this time, organic and printed electronics have 
gone from a promising new technology with very few applications 
in limited markets to a significant industry, with multiple products 
in a range of industry sectors, such as automotive, healthcare and 
wellness, packaging, and a number of others, which will be discussed 
later. This has been reflected in strong changes in the structure of 
and approach to the roadmap, as more and more real products give 
a clearer picture of what future products will be and what is needed 
to enable them. We will first review these changes and then describe 
how the roadmapping work was organized within the OE-A.
15.2.1 Changes with Progress in the Industry
From the outset, the OE-A Roadmap strived to take a market-based 
approach, with predicted future products at the top and analysis of 

651
Roadmapping for Organic Electronics
“applications” (which means, in the early editions of the roadmap, 
product-related technology) and basic technology. However, with 
very few products on the market at the time and the technological 
development in many cases still at an early stage, predicting future 
products was a risky exercise. Around 2005, for example, there 
was much hope that printed organic electronic circuits would 
replace silicon chips in almost all RFID tags and there were multiple 
companies working in this field. However, those companies that did 
not go bankrupt moved into completely different markets, and the 
RFID tag market is still fully dominated by silicon chips. OLED lighting 
also went through a large hype cycle but has thus far not been able 
to displace LED lighting, especially with the recent developments in 
luminescent foils fitted with micro-LEDs. At the same time, OLED 
has become the dominant technology for smartphone screens and 
a wide range of products, including (not exclusively in many cases, 
Si chips are still needed for logic and computation) printed and/
or organic electronic components such as sensors, antennas, and 
heating coils.
	
As the market and technology matured, the vision of future 
products became clearer, and at least somewhat more accurate 
predictions became possible. As initial products entered the market, 
it became possible to look not only at future products, but also at 
products that were already on the market, and products could be 
viewed on a scale from current through near term to long term, with 
predictions naturally becoming more uncertain the farther into the 
future they were expected to be fulfilled.
	
Products continued to be at the top of the hierarchy in the sixth 
edition of the roadmap, which was used as a case study in the first 
edition of this book. As organic and printed electronics penetrated 
more and more into the market, it became clear that this technology 
offered particularly compelling solutions in a range of industry 
sectors. Therefore, from the seventh edition onward (including the 
ninth edition, which is under preparation but will not be published 
by the time this book goes to press), the top level of the roadmap 
looked at the market and key industry sectors, analyzing the current 
status and expected development of products based on organic and 
printed electronics in these sectors. The next level then looked at 
key product areas, which could in some cases be relevant to multiple 
industry sectors, and the associated application-oriented technology. 

652
Roadmapping: General Principles and Application to Organic and Printed Electronics
Enabling technology provided the fundamentals for products and 
markets. The basic structure of the approach is shown in Fig. 15.2. 
We will look at the results of this process for the eighth edition in 
Section 15.3.
Figure 15.2 Typical layers of a roadmap, connecting market, product and 
technology, and the respective layers of the OE-A Roadmap. Each of the 
interdependent layers consists of several subchapters, which are reflecting the 
industry both vertically and horizontally.
15.2.2 Roadmapping Process in OE-A
Roadmapping is one of the important core activities of the OE-A, as it 
provides important insight for the member companies and research 
organizations, as well as to the industry at large, government 
agencies, and funding organizations. Based on the structure shown 
earlier, the following key industry sectors were identified:
 
∑	 Automotive
 
∑	 Consumer electronics
 
∑	 Health care
 
∑	 Printing and packaging
 
∑	 Smart buildings

653
	
In addition, the Internet of Things (IoT) was treated as an 
industry sector, despite it being more a technology or ecosystem that 
serves other industry sectors, since it is an area where printed and 
organic electronics can have a large impact over multiple sectors.
	
Finding a suitable grouping of product applications and 
technology for such a broad industry as printed and organic 
electronics has proven challenging throughout the history of the 
OE-A Roadmap. For the recent versions of the roadmap, products 
and applications were grouped into clusters, to keep the number 
manageable. These are:
 
∑	 Flexible and OLED displays
 
∑	 Organic photovoltaics (OPV)
 
∑	 Electronics and components (printed memory and batteries, 
active components and passive components)
 
∑	 Integrated smart systems (ISSs), including smart objects (also 
RFID), sensors, and smart textiles
 
∑	 Organic LED (OLED) lighting
The key enabling technology fields for the above industry sectors 
and product clusters were identified to be
 
∑	 Functional materials
 
∑	 Substrates
 
∑	 Printing, coating, and patterning
	
Especially for new technology fields such as organic and printed 
electronics, there can be a wide range of maturity of both application 
and enabling technology. A common way for assessing the maturity 
of a technology is TRL. The TRL can vary from 1, which refers to 
the observation of the fundamental principle, up to 9, which means 
that the technology is already being used in mass production. The 
definitions of the various TRLs as used by the European Union 
Framework program Horizon 2020 are shown in Table 15.1. An 
alternative TRL table can be found in Chapter 14.
	
Each of the above sectors, product clusters, and enabling 
technologies had its own working group, headed by a speaker and 
assisted by OE-A staff. Group work was done both in breakout 
sessions at OE-A meetings and in between meetings using remote 
meetings and written communication. For product clusters, the key 
“application parameters” and required performance for upcoming 
Roadmapping for Organic Electronics

654
Roadmapping: General Principles and Application to Organic and Printed Electronics
products were identified and discussed. Examples of application 
parameters include bending radius of a device, brightness of a 
display or light source, and power conversion efficiency of an OPV 
module, but the key parameters naturally varied from cluster to 
cluster. The speakers then assembled the chapters for their topics, 
and the input was collected, edited, and organized by a core editorial 
team at OE-A.

A key point to keep in mind is that roadmapping needs to be 
a group activity involving a large number and wide variety of 
stakeholders, in order to allow multiple perspectives to flow into the 
roadmap. In the case of the OE-A Roadmap, roughly 200 stakeholders 
participated in the development of the roadmap.

15.3 Case Study: Eighth Edition of OE-A 
Roadmap
In this section, we will review the results of the eighth edition of 
the OE-A Roadmap, which was published in 2020. We will follow 
the hierarchy outlined earlier, beginning with industry sectors, then 
applied technology/products, followed by enabling technology. We 
will close the section by looking at the key trends and challenges 
that appeared to be most common across the wide range of sectors 
and applications. For more detail, the reader is referred to the OE-A 
Roadmap (OE-A 2020).
15.3.1 Industry Sectors
15.3.1.1 Automotive
One of the key adopters of organic and especially printed electronics 
has been the automotive industry. This is not surprising since cars 
have become more and more electronic, even with combustion 
motors, and the value of electronics in automobiles is expected 
to reach 50% by 2030.3 As two of the advantages of organic and 
printed electronics are the reduction in weight and the flexibility of 
form factor, it is not surprising that it has successfully entered the 
automotive market, where weight is critical and nonplanar surfaces 
abound.
	
Printed seat occupation sensors have been used in automobiles 
for some years now and are important for safety features such as 
air bags and seat belt reminders. Heating foils—e.g., for defrosters, 
seat heaters, and LED headlamp de-icers—are also established in 
the automotive industry. Although OLEDs have not been found to 
be suitable for headlamps, where point sources are more practical, 
they have been used as rear lamps since 2016; the combination of 
large-area lighting of any shape and ultrathin profile makes them a 
very attractive option for rear lighting. These products are shown in 
Fig. 15.3. Touchscreen interfaces have become more and more 
important as well, as cars begin to resemble computers, and more 
flexible and OLED displays are expected in the future. These displays,

sensors, and interfaces will also, in the future, increasingly be on 
nonplanar surfaces.

OE-A Roadmap for Organic and Printed Electronics, eighth edition. Original 
sources IEE and Messe München.)
15.3.1.2 Consumer electronics
The sector of consumer electronics is quite broad, encompassing 
wearables such as sports trackers, mobile devices such as phones 

657
and tablets, home appliances and other smart home accessories, 
and toys and games. It is not surprising that the range of products 
based on organic and printed electronics is also similarly wide. The 
most well-known successful market penetration is probably the 
dominance of OLED displays in smartphones, where even foldable 
displays have recently been introduced (see Fig. 15.4), allowing 
a screen larger than the device itself. Touchscreen interfaces have 
also successfully entered the market, for example in so-called white 
goods (refrigerators, washing machines). Printed batteries have 
thus far only found niche markets due to limited capacity, but with 
further advances, they are expected to be feasible in more power-
hungry devices such as mobile phones. A rollable large-screen OLED 
TV, predicted already in the early days of OLED development in the 
1990s, was finally brought to market in 2021, but at a price tag of 
$100,000, so a mass market is not to be expected soon.

15.3.1.3 Health care and well-being
The health care and well-being industry has also started using a 
significant amount of organic and printed electronics in its products. 
As this industry continues to grow rapidly due to demographic shifts 
and advances in technology, it is an important target market. Such 
products as glucose monitors, simple electrocardiogram patches, 
and pressure sensors in shoes have already reached the market. 
Smart blister packages for pharmaceuticals were also introduced to

658
Roadmapping: General Principles and Application to Organic and Printed Electronics
improve compliance but were not successful so far, because while 
they can monitor if the pill has been removed, it cannot tell whether 
it has been ingested. More recently, printed MRI antennas on fabric 
have been commercialized; these weigh far less than conventional 
antennas and are especially targeted for use with small children. 
Full-spectrum wireless, skin-mounted ECG units have been clinically 
tested and could also enter the market soon. Other products 
expected in the near term are a wider range of skin-mounted sensors, 
including pulse oximeters and OLED-based light therapy masks. An 
example of a skin-mounted device is shown in Fig. 15.5.

gyroscope for healthcare and wellness applications. (© VTT Technical Research 
Centre of Finland, taken from OE-A Roadmap for Organic and Printed Electronics, 
eighth edition.)
15.3.1.4 Printing and packaging
Printing and packaging seem like a natural fit for organic and printed 
electronics, since printing plays a role, and the possibility to fit to 
any surface is an advantage. On the other hand, the cost pressure 
in packaging is immense; even add-on costs of a few cents can be 
a problem for many applications. Nonetheless, progress has been 
made here as well. Public transit tickets—both monthly passes and 
single-use tickets—are increasingly equipped with RFID technology 
and use printed antennas. Flexible shelf-edge price labels have also 
been in the market for some time. Temperature trackers equipped 

659
with RFID readout are entering the market for temperature-
sensitive products such as medicines and foodstuffs, though a 
reduction in cost is needed before a mass market can be addressed. 
Figure 15.6 shows a smart shock label developed by Ynvisible. In 
the future, an important expected development is a transition from 
coin cell batteries (which are both an end-of-life problem as well 
as a potential source of contamination if they leak) for wireless 
sensors in packaging to harvesting of ambient energy and storage in 
environmentally friendly means such as supercapacitors.

mechanical shock. (© Ynvisible, taken from OE-A Roadmap for Organic and 
Printed Electronics, eighth edition.)
15.3.1.5 Smart buildings
The construction and housing industry has undergone significant 
transformation in recent years. In particular, the trend of so-called 
smart buildings has grown significantly. In smart buildings, multiple 
sensors can be integrated directly into construction materials or 
mounted on surfaces to monitor quantities such as temperature, 
moisture, mold, or gases and can be connected to control systems 
to create a healthier living and working environment and to save 
energy. While many sensors are currently based on conventional 
Case Study: Eighth Edition of OE-A Roadmap

660
Roadmapping: General Principles and Application to Organic and Printed Electronics
electronics, printed electronics has begun to make inroads, e.g., 
with printed floor sensors, and it is expected that batteries can be 
replaced by energy harvesting and storage in the coming years. 
OLED lighting is still struggling to compete with LEDs but, especially 
for commercial installations, is expected to see a significant market. 
Building-integrated OPV has not reached mass market, but the 
number of installations is growing; an example is shown in Fig. 15.7. 
In the longer term, smart wallpapers, printed microphones and 
speakers, and other integration of energy into building materials is 
expected to transform building management.

Roadmap for Organic and Printed Electronics, eighth edition.)
15.3.1.6 Internet of Things
The Internet of Things, or IoT, is not really an industry sector, although 
there are companies advertising themselves as IoT companies. IoT 
could more accurately be seen as a broad technology platform with 
applications in a wide range of fields, including, in fact, all of the above 
industry sectors. Nonetheless, because of the high importance of IoT 
and the relevance of organic and printed electronics to it, this was 

661
treated as an industry sector in the roadmap. A definition of the IoT is:
The internet of things, or IoT, is a system of interrelated computing 
devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people 
that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to 
transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or 
human-to-computer interaction. (Rouse 2019)
	
These UIDs should be able to be placed on or in more or less 
anywhere, e.g., walls, furniture, medical devices, etc. The thin, 
lightweight, and flexible form factor of organic and printed electronics 
can make such UIDs far less obtrusive and more compatible with 
unusual surfaces and shapes. An example of a sensor platform with 
NFC connectivity is shown in Fig. 15.8. There has not been a large 
amount of organic and printed electronics used commercially in the 
IoT other than printed RF antennas, but this is starting to change. 
Demonstrators have already shown the capability of printed energy 
harvesting and storage to replace coin cell batteries in commercial 
products under realistic conditions, and this approach is expected to 
become more important in the future.

Group, taken from OE-A Roadmap for Organic and Printed Electronics, eighth 
edition).

Roadmapping: General Principles and Application to Organic and Printed Electronics
15.3.2 Applied Technologies
In this section, we will summarize the conclusions and predictions 
of the working groups for five applied technology clusters as listed 
earlier. Future applications and predicted advances in technology 
are discussed, as well as principal challenges and SWOT (strengths, 
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis.
15.3.2.1 Flexible and OLED displays
In comparison to earlier roadmaps, OLED and flexible displays 
were grouped to form an application cluster. OLED displays were 
not strongly emphasized in earlier versions of the roadmap, but 
the development of the industry led to a decision to examine 
them more closely. One key reason is that the closest product to a 
so-called “killer app” in the organic electronics industry so far is 
almost certainly the OLED (organic LED) display. OLEDs have mostly 
displaced liquid crystal displays in smartphones, due to advantages 
especially in thinness and image quality, due to the lack of a need for 
polarizers. More recently, OLED displays have expanded into the TV 
market as well, and there is now an overlap between OLED displays 
and flexible displays, even if most products are currently still rigid. 
It is now even possible to buy a large rollable OLED TV, although the 
price of around €100,000 is not likely to lead to a mass market. On 
a smaller scale, smartphones with foldable OLED displays are also 
already available and enable the user to have a display bigger than 
the device itself.
	
Despite the strong position of OLED displays in smartphones, 
other display technologies are still quite strong as well. 
Electrophoretic displays based on the movement of charged 
pigments are the dominant technology for e-book readers and have 
also been used for flexible shelf-edge price labels. Liquid crystal 
displays are still the most widespread, from simple alphanumeric 
displays to high-resolution active-matrix displays with thin-film 
transistor circuitry for addressing. There has also been significant 
development in the area of flexible liquid crystal displays with 
backplanes made of organic TFTs, so-called OCLDs. These have been 
demonstrated, for example, as part of a curved driver information 
interface in a concept car, though wide commercial adoption has not 
yet been achieved.

663
	
The key application parameters relevant to both OLED and more 
general flexible displays were found to be bend radius, lifetime, 
resolution, update speed, transparency (only for some specialized 
applications), color gamut, and contrast ratio. The key technology 
parameters were identified as semiconductor mobility, gate bias 
stress stability (both primarily for TFT backplanes), maximum 
process temperature (limits which substrates are possible), barrier 
properties, layer-to-layer registration, and OLED material efficiency 
and lifetime.
	
Based on the above, and the current state of technology 
development, key challenges were identified. These were flexible 
encapsulation (progress has been made but improvement, especially 
in cost, is needed), process costs, and technology accessibility (lack 
of production facilities outside Asia).
	
Although there was some common ground between flexible and 
OLED displays in the application and technology parameters, the 
working group found that it was not feasible to do a unified SWOT 
analysis for both fields. For OLEDs, key strengths included light 
weight and thinness and, in some cases, flexibility and conformability, 
while costs and need for extremely good encapsulation were key 
weaknesses. Opportunities were seen in the future in continued use 
in consumer electronics, but also in industries where weight and 
conformability can be important, such as automotive and aerospace. 
Key strengths for flexible displays in general, and OLCDs in particular, 
included weight and flexibility as well as the potential to use older, 
fully amortized a-Si TFT lines to save cost, while the continued need 
for a backlight and corresponding reduction on flexibility were 
key weaknesses. Opportunities included, in addition to aerospace/
automotive, other applications in the future such as large-area 
signage. Key threats were seen to be further improvements in OLEDs 
and the advance of micro-LED displays, especially for large area.
15.3.2.2 Organic and perovskite photovoltaics
Earlier editions of the roadmap focused exclusively on organic 
PV (OPV), but with the massive growth in interest and continued 
progress in PV devices based on perovskite, this technology was also 
included in the eight editions, since it is also compatible with printing 
techniques and flexible substrates. OPV is more commercially 
developed, with significant amounts of building-integrated PV 
Case Study: Eighth Edition of OE-A Roadmap

664
Roadmapping: General Principles and Application to Organic and Printed Electronics
(BIPV) demonstrated, but perovskite PV has demonstrated higher 
energy conversion efficiency despite a far shorter development time; 
this is, however, countered by significantly shorter lifetime, as well 
as the problem that most perovskite PV materials contain toxic lead.
	
OPV has made substantial technical progress since the sixth 
edition of the roadmap covered in the previous edition of this 
textbook, with energy conversion efficiency in laboratory cells, 
with 16% reported for single junctions and over 17% for tandem 
devices. However, efficiency of large-scale modules is lower. With 
the combination of higher efficiency, long-term stability, and falling 
prices, conventional silicon-based PV is still hard to overtake for 
large-scale installations, even though accelerated aging protocols 
have predicted lifetimes of up to 20 years for vacuum-deposited 
OPV modules. As a result, OPV has seen success in markets where 
the specific advantages of color selection, optional transparency, 
and light weight/flexibility are key. This includes BIPV, where the 
efficiency differential to Si is smaller, as OPV actually works better 
under diffuse light, while Si needs direct sunlight to reach optimal 
efficiency. OPV has also been used in rechargeable solar lamps and 
for indoor light harvesting, e.g., for wireless keyboards or as, together 
with a supercapacitor, a replacement for a coin cell in wireless 
sensors (Lupo et al. 2019). Mass markets have not been achieved 
yet, but steady growth is expected. Progress in process technology 
has also been made, which may lower production costs and reduce 
the energy payback time.
	
Perovskite PV cells are based on halide perovskite materials 
and do not contain rare or expensive materials. They, like OPV, can 
be processed using high-throughput, scalable processes such as 
printing and coating and are usually processed at temperatures 
compatible with polymer substrates. In addition to these advantages, 
a key reason for the massive interest in perovskite PV is the high 
efficiency, with over 25% being reported for single-junction devices. 
Nonetheless, perovskite PV has not yet successfully reached the 
market; this is due primarily to two factors: the stability of the 
devices still needs improvement, and all of the devices showing 
high efficiency are based on lead-containing perovskite materials, 
which is not environmentally friendly, although lead-free perovskite 
materials are being studied intensively.

665
	
Since the application areas are similar, it is not surprising that 
the key application parameters were similar for both types of PV, 
with efficiency, lifetime, cost, and environmental impact important 
for both, with an additional parameter of transparency for special 
applications of OPV. Key challenges for both technologies include 
stability, scalability (maintaining high efficiency in production 
modules), cost, and encapsulation. Both OPV and perovskite PV 
have strengths in solution processability, good performance in low 
light, and low processing temperature, leading to the possibility 
of lightweight, flexible modules. Weaknesses for both include 
scalability, production capacity, and scattered market, with the 
additional issue of lead in perovskite PV. Both see opportunities in 
niche markets where the light weight and versatile form factors or 
efficiency under indoor light are important, and the key threat for 
both is the presence of well-developed existing technologies.
15.3.2.3 Electronics and components
As mentioned earlier, the electronics and components cluster 
includes printed memories, batteries, active devices and logic, and 
passive devices, which are the building blocks or toolkit that will be 
needed to make future products based on organic electronics. Sub-
roadmaps were developed for each of these areas by teams within 
the OE-A. For brevity, only a short summary of each of the sub-topics 
will be given.
	
One key element of any device that is not connected to the grid is 
power supply. As a result, printed energy storage is a key component 
of a printed electronic device or product in order to enable truly 
flat and flexible form factors and as an alternative to bulky coin cell 
batteries. Both batteries and supercapacitors can be printed. Printed 
batteries have been commercially available for some time but have 
traditionally had a relatively high price point for high-performance 
batteries such as Li ion devices. Printed supercapacitors are not yet 
on the market in a big way, but the fundamental feasibility of the 
combination of printed energy harvesting and printed energy storage 
has been demonstrated multiple times. Printed batteries are more 
commercial but so far most have been metal-sealed pouch cells, with 
monolithic integration by printing desirable for printed electronic 
systems, but not yet ready for commercialization. Supercapacitors 
have been integrated monolithically with OPV modules, but so far 
Case Study: Eighth Edition of OE-A Roadmap

666
Roadmapping: General Principles and Application to Organic and Printed Electronics
only at lab scale; however, this is believed to be scalable in the future 
as market pull for a switch from battery to harvesting and storage 
grows.
	
The working group identified the same key application 
parameters for both batteries and supercapacitors: energy density, 
power density, voltage, peak current, lifetime, cycle life, operational 
temperature range, and bending radius. The key challenges 
were seen to be manufacturability and economics (especially 
for batteries), energy (especially for supercapacitors and non-
lithium batteries), power (especially for batteries), density, and 
encapsulation (especially edge sealing, as metal foil can be used for 
area sealing). For the SWOT analysis, key strengths were seen to be 
form factor, integration and scalability through printing, while the 
lower performance of printed batteries compared to other packages, 
lifetime, and (for supercapacitors, for which voltage changes during 
discharge) voltage limitations and need for power management 
circuity. Opportunities are seen especially in IoT applications and in 
energy harvesting and storage modules, while key threats are the 
ubiquitous and cheap coin cell batteries, as well as the issue, for 
monolithically integrated batteries, of the regulatory requirement in 
many countries, including the EU, for batteries to be recycled and 
not disposed of.
	
Among active devices, the most emphasis was on printed 
transistors, diodes, and circuits, as printed memory, despite the 
availability of promising technology, is only relevant if no silicon 
chips are used for circuitry; this is because memory is, in that case, 
cheaper and more practical to integrate into Si. Most activity in the 
field is around TFTs and circuits, where the combination of OTFTs 
(usually p-type) and TFTs based on solution-processed metal oxides 
(usually n-type) has enabled complementary circuitry analogous 
to CMOS in conventional electronics. OTFT backplanes for OLED, 
e-paper, and LCD displays have reached production, but it is difficult 
to confirm the number of sales, and flexible “chips” based on metal 
oxide TFTs are starting to enter production. While operational 
voltages for printed TFTs are still frequently higher than those 
for conventional electronics and higher than optimal for energy-
autonomous devices, voltages have come down strongly from earlier 
reports, and recently the combination of printed semiconductor and 
ultrathin high-k dielectric has demonstrated operation under 2 V.

667
	
The working group on active devices identified the following key 
application parameters: temperature stability, operating/threshold 
voltage, power consumption, lifetime, charge carrier mobility, 
integration with passive devices, and reliability/uniformity. The key 
challenges were seen to be ESD protection, CE conformity, reliable 
vias in printed/flexible systems, improvement in manufacturing, 
e.g., printing registration, and the lack of appropriate standards. In 
the SWOT analysis, key strengths included form factor, weight, and 
scalability, while weaknesses included the lack of standards (though 
there are working groups developing standards now), performance 
compared to Si, and process variability. Opportunities were seen for 
low-cost systems requiring such simple circuitry that Si would be 
overkill, in-molded electronics and systems requiring extremely flat 
form factor, while the strongest threat continues to be conventional 
Si, which can also be produced in thinned chips.
	
Other 
active 
devices 
include 
piezoelectric 
transducers, 
electrochromic displays, and pigment-based electroluminescent 
elements. The progress in these fields was discussed, but separate 
roadmaps were not made for them.
15.3.2.4 Integrated smart systems
ISSs (sensors, smart objects, and smart textiles) refer to objects that 
combine diverse functions such as power, sensing, logic, memory, 
and output circuits in order to perform a desired function in a 
printed, flexible system. In a sense, ISSs are the real goal of organic 
electronics, so the importance of looking at integrated systems will 
only grow in the future. Applications are expected in fields as diverse 
as automotive, aeronautics, clothing, environmental monitoring, 
and health care. We will only briefly summarize the results here 
and refer to the full white paper listed in the references for more 
detailed information. For this edition of the roadmap, smart objects 
and sensors were grouped together, and smart textiles treated 
separately, so we will follow this format as well. The section in the 
white paper on 3D structural electronics was more of a technology 
tutorial than a roadmap, and thus it will not be covered here; 
however, it is worthwhile reading for anyone who wants to get an 
introduction to this field.
	
An advantage of using printed electronics in the fabrication of 
smart objects and sensors is the possibility to integrate multiple 
Case Study: Eighth Edition of OE-A Roadmap

668
Roadmapping: General Principles and Application to Organic and Printed Electronics
functionalities, such as diverse sensing elements, energy harvesting 
and storage, and antennas onto one flexible substrate using printing. 
Usually this is combined, to date, with small Si-based chips for 
measurement and communication, using hybrid system integration. 
Hybrid integration has increased the ability of printed sensors and 
smart objects to enter the market, as it enables the use of widespread 
wireless communication protocols such as NFC and Bluetooth. 
Glucose sensors, pressure sensor arrays, and temperature trackers 
have all been able to reach significant markets through this advance. 
In the future, in-molded sensors embedded in vehicles, biosensors 
integrated into packaging, and even connection of sensors with 
artificial intelligence to enable decision-making are expected. Key 
application parameters were identified as power consumption, 
connectivity, 
form 
factor/weight, 
reliability 
of 
integration, 
environmental impact, availability of novel materials, and resolution 
(especially for image sensors). Key challenges were identified as 
availability of mature devices, matching of electrical interfaces (e.g., 
voltage, impedance), and compatibility of mechanical interfaces. Key 
strengths were weight and form factor, and key current weaknesses 
were reliability and lack of standards (or standards designed for 
Si). Opportunities were seen in the integration of new materials 
such as graphene, while key threats included regulatory challenges, 
unrealistic market expectations, and competition with conventional 
electronics.
	
Smart textiles were primarily defined as textiles with integrated 
sensing functions in the eighth edition of the roadmap, though the 
possibility of heating and cooling, e.g., through conductive fibers, was 
also included. Three levels of functionality were discussed, moving 
to increased complexity and, correspondingly, moving more to future 
applications: passive (sensing only), active (integrating sensing and 
actuation/response), and “very smart” (adaptive response). There 
has been some use of conductive fabric for heating, and heart rate 
monitors have been integrated into sports shirt, however onto, 
rather than into the fabric. However, there are numerous companies 
working in the field and progress has been made. Future products 
are anticipated in a wide range of applications, such as body 
monitors for health and well-being as well as industrial garments, 
home textiles for both decoration and smart furniture, and as 
elements in composite structures for buildings as well as for vehicles 

669
and windmills, incorporating sensing for structural integrity. Among 
key identified application parameters were cost–performance 
relationship, durability (also to multiple washing cycles for 
wearables), flexibility, recyclability, and accuracy/reliability. Key 
challenges were seen to be availability of specialized production 
equipment, improved mechanical properties of materials, the need 
for higher resolution printing, print permanence and standards/
validation, especially for large-scale use. Among key strengths are, 
as for most printed and organic electronics applications, weight and 
form factor; an additional strength is a strong record of R&D and 
ecosystem of companies working in the field. Weaknesses include 
difficulty bridging the gap between demonstrator or prototype 
and mass market, and difficulty defining the market for such a 
broad range of possible applications. Opportunities are seen for 
integrators, and especially in applications relating to demographic 
changes in society, such as aging population, while threats include 
competition from alternative technologies already in the market and 
uncertain user acceptance.
15.3.2.5 OLED lighting
OLED lighting is unique among lighting technologies because it is by 
its nature a flat, large-area emitter, in contrast to other light sources, 
which are either point sources or defined by the shape enclosing 
a discharge; as a result, other lighting sources require optics and/
or luminaire structures if more broad illumination is needed. 
Pigment electroluminescent films generate light over a broad area 
but do not have the required brightness or color quality to work for 
illumination. As a result, there has been strong interest in the use of 
OLEDs for lighting. However, there has been cost and performance 
pressure from other technologies, including micro-LED foils, and 
for residential use, the primary demand is still for retrofit lighting 
sources compatible with standard light bulb sockets. As a result of 
this, and cost pressure, OLED lighting has not achieved as large a 
market as originally projected. Nonetheless, it has seen some success 
in markets where the special properties of OLEDs give a competitive 
advantage. A key breakthrough for OLED lighting was the adoption 
of OLEDs for taillights in automobiles in 2016. Designer lamps have 
also been available for some time. The automotive industry has 
indicated its commitment to integrate OLED lighting in more ways, 
Case Study: Eighth Edition of OE-A Roadmap

670
Roadmapping: General Principles and Application to Organic and Printed Electronics
such as interior lighting and even OLED sunroofs. The flexibility and 
brightness of OLED lighting are also expected to lead to integration 
into clothing, and the EU project Smart2Go recently demonstrated 
a prototype safety signal garment with integrated OLED lighting. 
The key application parameters were found to be lifetime, efficiency 
(lm/W), size, design freedom, luminance, and cost. Cost was also 
identified as the most important principal challenge; other ones 
were investment for full-scale production and standardization. 
Key strengths included unique design possibilities and low driving 
voltage, while the most important weakness was seen to be the 
currently high manufacturing cost. Opportunities were seen in large 
tiles, free-form shapes, and roll-to-roll manufacturing, while the 
most important threat was competition from LED and micro-LED 
lighting.
15.3.3 Enabling Technologies
As the OE-A is a primarily industry-oriented organization, the 
emphasis in the roadmap was on development of applications, 
products, and markets. However, the success of this depends also 
on successful technology development, so the status and progress 
of enabling technologies need to be mapped as well. This helps 
to identify the key challenges where development “as usual” will 
not solve the problems and breakthroughs are needed. The OE-A 
Roadmap team looked especially at materials, including substrates, 
and at printing and patterning processes.
	
Organic semiconductors for circuitry continue to be a key class 
of materials, due to the possibility to process these materials at 
temperatures below 100°C, which allows use of low-cost flexible or 
stretchable polymer substrates such as polyesters and polyurethanes 
as well as bio-derived polymers such as polylactates. There has been 
continued progress in the charge carrier mobility, including reports 
of polymers or polymer/small molecule composites with mobility 
values around 5 cm2/V-s and even some reports of organics with 
values as high as 100, though it should be pointed out that errors in 
determining the mobility from TFT parameters can lead to up to a 
factor of 10 difference from the actual value. In addition, mobility up 
to 50 has been reported for carbon nanotubes. There have also been 
many reports of n-type organic semiconductors with mobility values 
above 1, which opens a possible path to complementary circuitry.

671
	
Organic semiconductors are also needed for OPV. In this area, 
there has been substantial progress since the previous roadmap. 
Polymers with improved absorption were reported, which increases 
the amount of solar spectrum available for energy conversion. A 
particularly important development was the discovery of organic 
non-fullerene acceptors, which led to a major jump in energy 
conversion efficiency, up to 16%. OPV materials have also been used 
increasingly for photodetectors and photodetector arrays, where 
specific wavelengths may be targeted.
	
Inorganic semiconductors, especially metal oxides, were not 
seen as solution processible for a long time, but processability has 
improved strongly. These materials are generally processed by 
coating or printing a precursor solution, which is then converted 
by adding energy into the metal oxide. MOx semiconductors have 
been used for TFTs and circuits, especially for complementary 
circuitry, and can also be printed, e.g., by flexo or ink-jet. Progress in 
reducing the conversion temperature by adding additional energy, 
e.g., by photons and/or by improving precursor chemistry, has been 
achieved; nonetheless, obtaining high performance at temperatures 
compatible with substrates such as polyester is still challenging. 
In addition, there has been growing interest in hybrid organic–
inorganic metal halide perovskites, which have shown very high 
charge carrier mobility, but these are still in an early stage.
	
Graphene and other 2D materials have continued to attract 
much research interest. Graphene has especially drawn interest 
as a potential transparent conducting electrode. It has also been 
investigated as an electrode in batteries and supercapacitors and 
shown extremely high specific capacitance in monolayers and 
ultrathin layers. However, in practical devices requiring thick films, 
it has proven hard to surpass the much cheaper activated carbon. 
Other 2D materials such as boron nitride, tungsten disulfide, and 
black phosphorus have also attracted attention, the latter especially 
for its direct and tunable bandgap. While large-scale commercial 
applications have not appeared, the roadmap team expects 
breakthroughs in synthesis and processing to lead to significant 
market applications in the coming years.
	
Substrates are a critical part of a printed electronic device, as 
it needs to provide the needed flexibility and/or stretchability,

withstand processing temperatures, and be chemically resistant 
to any solvents used in processing. Poly(ethyleneteraphthalate) 
(PET) and poly(ethylenenaphthalate) (PEN) have been common 
substrates in printed electronics for quite some time, with polyimide 
(PI) an alternative when higher temperature stability is needed and 
transparency is not critical. More recently, the use of soft substrates 
such as silicone and polyurethane (PU) has increased, as these have 
comparable mechanical properties to skin and thus are suitable for 
skin-mounted electronics. Another recent trend has been the use 
of bio-derived substrates such as polylactate as an alternative to 
fossil-fuel-based polymers. The following key challenges that need 
to be addressed in the future were identified as barrier properties, 
lack of supply of optimized substrates due to low demand/market, 
standards and specifications, and material handling.
	
Key printing and patterning processes were discussed in the 
roadmap as well, but this content largely reflects the descriptions 
in Chapter 3 and will not be discussed further here. The tradeoff 
between resolution and throughput continues to be valid in most 
cases, as seen in Fig. 15.9, which shows typical resolution and 
throughput for the high-quality printing needed for electronics. 
However, there have been promising reports of feature sizes down 
to a µm or a few µm with good throughput using methods such as 
offset gravure.

15.3.4 Overall Roadmap, Key Trends, and Challenges
Based on the work of and in cooperation with the working groups, 
the roadmap team distilled an overall roadmap for printed and 
organic electronics, which is shown in Fig. 15.10. Overall, the future 
of the industry is viewed optimistically, with sales of products, 
including printed and organic electronics, already around $35 
billion in 2019 and predicted to reach over $70 million by 2030. Key 
trends included the establishment of printed and organic electronics 
in several major industry sectors as described earlier in the chapter, 
an increasing interest in stretchable and wearable electronics, the 
growth of NFC-enabled smart labels, and the growing importance 
of IoT.

Roadmapping: General Principles and Application to Organic and Printed Electronics
	
As should be expected from such a broad field as printed 
and organic electronics, it was not a trivial task to distill the key 
application parameters down to a list that is valid for most areas of 
the field. However, the following were found to be relevant over a wide 
range of industry sectors, products, and applications: environmental 
impact, reliability, capital expenditure for new equipment, overall 
cost, and compatibility with standards. The key challenges across 
the field reflected the growing maturity of the industry and related 
more to markets, production, and products than in the past—and 
frequently the same as the key application parameters. These were 
cost, process control (resolution, registration, etc.), encapsulation, 
scalability, inspection/yield, and standards and regulations.
	
Despite these challenges, which seem to be less insurmountable 
than feared in the past (thus the decision to stop using the term “red 
brick wall”), the outlook for the field is optimistic.

is emitted by passing an electric current. The current in this case 
consists of hopping electrons. The light-emitting polymer layer is 
sandwiched between two electrodes. One of the electrodes is light 
transparent. This electrode is mostly made of indium tin oxide (ITO) 
and is used as the anode. The other electrode is placed on top of the 
device and is used as the cathode. Aluminum is often used.
	
The variant discussed here is an organometallic LED. The light-
emitting layer consists of ruthenium complex ions arranged in a 
polymer matrix. Sevian et al. describe the synthesis and working 
principle in an article [1]. The working mechanism is visualized in 
Fig. 16.1.

oxidation (Ru2+ => Ru3+) takes place, and at the cathode, reduction (Ru2+ => 
Ru+). Reprinted (adapted) with permission from Ref. [1], Copyright (2004)

At the anode, there is oxidation of the Ru2+ complex into Ru3+; at 
the cathode, there is reduction of the Ru2+ complex into Ru1+. Now, 
light is emitted when Ru1+ and Ru3+ combine to form two Ru2+. One 
of these is in an excited state.
	
In this context, several experiments on light-emitting thin 
organometallic diodes can be carried out by second-year students 
of bachelor’s degree, and certainly students of applied science, 
chemistry, or physics:

Tetrafluoroborate
The 
website 
https://education.mrsec.wisc.edu/organic-light-
emitting-diodes [2, 3] discusses the synthesis of the solid-state 
OLED based on tris(2,2’-bipyridine) ruthenium (II) complexes; this 
is explained with video support. The first step in the synthesis is the 
sequential reaction of complexation of Ru3+ by bipyridine. Next, the 
Ru3+ is reduced to Ru2+ with an acid. After stirring and refluxing, this 
complex is precipitated with sodium tetrafluoroborate. The overall 
reactions of the tris-ruthenium complex are as follows:
	
1.	 2H2O + NaH2PO2 + 12Bpy + 4RuCl3
 
 Æ 4[Ru(Bpy)3]Cl2 + 3HCl + H3PO4 + NaCl
	
2.	 [Ru(Bpy)3]Cl2 + 2NaBF4 Æ [Ru(Bpy)3](BF4)2 + 2NaCl
	
The formation of the tris-ruthenium complex is visualized in 
Fig. 16.2.

Experiments
16.1.2 Characterization of the Synthesis Material
With standard lab equipment, characterization can be performed 
by FTIR, UV-Vis, and fluorescence analyses. The Ru complex can be 
characterized by analysis of the absorption, emission, and excitation 
spectrum. In this specific situation, three analysis devices are used:
	
1.	 An FTIR from Nicolet (iS5) is used to analyze the specific 
structures of the complex. The chemical structure of the 
ruthenium complex can be mapped by the evaluation of the 
different vibration bonds. An example of the spectrum is 
shown in Fig. 16.3.
Figure 16.3 FTIR–ruthenium complex in ethanol.
	
	 In Table 16.1, the wave numbers and all known corresponding 
chemical structures are shown. The structures that are not to 
be expected are crossed out.
	
2.	 The excitation and emission are measured with a 
spectrofluorometer of Jasco (FP-6200). The fluorescence 
measurements are shown in Fig. 16.4. As can be seen from the 
spectra, the excitation is intense at a wavelength of 290 nm 

681
Organometallic Light-Emitting Diodes
and the light emitted by this ruthenium complex has a peak at 
590 nm. This OLED is, therefore, red colored.

16.1.3 Constructing a Simple Three-Layer OLED
ITO-covered glass slides, 5.0 × 5.0 cm2; conductance <= 10 Ω/sq.; 
and thickness 150 nm can be used. ITO is used as the anode in the 
OLED. To prevent a short circuit later, ITO is removed at one edge 
of the glass slides by etching with a concentrated hydrochloric acid 
solution. Sputtering of ITO on a clean glass slide is also possible if 
an ITO target and a vacuum sputtering system are available. Masks 
for patterning can be applied. In this case, the ITO had a thickness of 
150 nm as well, but the conductance was 25 Ω/sq.
	
A simple cleaning procedure is followed to make the ITO-covered 
glass slides fat and dust free. A small strip of adhesive tape is placed 
on a small part of the cleaned ITO. The ITO under this strip serves 
later as the direct contact for the positive pole of the power supply.
Next, 1.0 mL of the ruthenium complex, dissolved in poly(vinyl 
alcohol), is applied by spin-coating onto the ITO. Spin-coating of the 
complex is repeated two more times. As suggested on the websites, 
the spin coaters are made of cooling fans from old PCs and surrounded 
by a splash shield. Afterward, the spin-coated ruthenium complex is 
air dried. An aluminum cathode layer is deposited by physical vapor 
deposition (PVD) onto the ruthenium complex. The evaporation is 
carried out in vacuum (10–5 mbar). A mask containing four gaps is 
placed on top of the slide with the complex before the PVD starts. 
Finally, the adhesive strip is removed. In a simple electric circuit, 
the four ruthenium OLEDs are connected to a power supply. The 

683
Organometallic Light-Emitting Diodes
power, the electrical current, and the light emitted are measured. 
If the electric power is high enough, the ruthenium complexes are 
reduced/oxidized, as explained earlier, and the emission of red light 
starts. Two working examples are shown in Fig. 16.6 and Fig. 16.7.

684
Experiments
16.1.4 Characterization of the OLED by Electrical 
Current, Electrical Potential, and Light Emitting
The physical characterization of the four OLEDs consists of I, V and 
V, L measurements. With data acquisition by National Instruments 
and LabVIEW, the characteristics are measured simultaneously. The 
illuminance is measured in lm·m–2 = lx. The sensor used for this 
purpose is a TSL250R, a photodiode from Farnell, with a built-in 
amplifier. A conversion factor must be used to convert V/(μW·cm–2) 
into lm·m–2. At a wavelength of 550 nm is the number of lumens per 
watt, the largest, namely, 683 lumens per watt. The light emitted 
by the OLEDs (see the fluorescent diagram in Fig. 16.4) is mainly 
around 590 nm.
	
The resistance of the OLEDs is, of course, not linear to the applied 
voltage, because it is a diode. So the electrical current is also not 
linearly proportional to the electrical potential. It also showed that 
at a constant applied voltage, the electrical current crawls to an end 
value (see Fig. 16.8). The measurements are, therefore, always done 
after a certain interval of time.
4
Figure 16.8 OLED with ruthenium complex: electric current in time at an 
applied voltage of 9.0 V.
	
The I, V, L characteristic is obtained by raising the voltage in 
steps of 0.2 V. The control signal is provided by a PC. To ensure that 
the OLED is fed with sufficient electric power, an amplifying circuit is 
placed between the PC + National Instruments board and the OLED. 
This circuit contains an OpAmp (μA741) transformer with 2 kΩ and 
1 kΩ resistors for a strengthening of the voltage by a factor of 2. After 

685
this, there is a power buffer (LT1010) to ensure that the circuit is fed 
with a high-enough power to the OLEDs. The circuit is shown in Fig. 16.9.
Figure 16.9 Electrical circuit to feed the OLEDs.
	
The direct current (DC) voltage of 6 V in Fig. 16.9 is only an 
example. The feeding voltage is with steps of 0.2 V raised up to 20 
V. The OLEDs were placed at a few millimeters above the measuring 
photodiodes. The results of some students are given in Fig. 16.10 
and Fig. 16.11.

16.2 RFID Tags
If a package is moved from one place to another, it is good to 
recognize the package at distances of a few meters in a limited time 
frame. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a method of using 
radio waves for the purpose of transferring data, identifying, and 
tracking so-called tags. RFID tags that provide specific information 
are constructed differently. These tags contain digital information 
stored inside an integrated circuit (IC) present in the tags and 
connected to an antenna. RFID tags can be passive or active. An active 
RFID tag is connected to a battery, so it is continuously activated. A 
passive RFID tag only works when activated by an antenna, which is 
irradiated by an electromagnetic wave. Here, we only describe the 
making of a passive RFID tag. A typical identification system consists 
of an RFID tag and an RFID reader. The construction of the antenna 
in the RFID tag is explained in this part of the chapter. The RFID 
reader and the RFID IC are commercially available. An example of an 
RFID tag consisting of a dipole wire antenna with a stub and an IC is 
given in Fig. 16.12.

687
Figure 16.12 Dipole wire antenna with an IC placed in a stub.
	
The operation of the identification system is briefly described 
here. The reader emits an RF wave, which is received by the RFID 
tag antenna. The antenna converts this electromagnetic wave into 
an alternating current (AC), which powers the IC. The activated IC 
modulates the AC of the antenna to transmit its stored data to the 
reader. RFID tags can operate in different frequency bands. For the 
purpose of recognizing packages, ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) tags 
are applied. For Europe, this UHF band is between 865 MHz and 868 
MHz. For North America, RFID tags operate between 900 MHz and 
930 MHz. Therefore, an iDTRONIC UHF USB RFID reader operating at 
a range from 830 MHz to 950 MHZ is used. A commercially available 
IC from NXP, TSSOP8, is used in this experiment. This chip is EPC 
class 1 Generation 2. Its impedance according to the datasheets is:
	 ZIC = 16 – j148 Ω at 915 MHz and ZIC = 26 – j160 Ω at 866 MHz
	
The total power transfer PIC received by the IC is dependent on 
the potential of the antenna, VA, and the impedances of the antenna 
and IC, respectively, ZA and ZIC:

From this formula, it can be seen that the best power delivery 
will be when both impedances match:

(16.2)
	
The impedance of the IC is fixed at the optimum frequency. To 
ensure an optimal fit between the impedances, the geometry of the 
tag antenna must be adjusted. The adjustment must be to account for 
both resistance and reactance. The resistance is adjusted mostly by 
the length of the antenna. On the other hand, the energy transfer by 
RF waves to the antenna is most efficient at the antenna’s resonant 
frequency:
	
f = c/λ and λ = n·ℓ	
(16.3)
with ℓ being the antenna length.
RFID Tags

688
Experiments
	
So there will be some discrepancy between both desired lengths. 
The inductive reactance can be manipulated by folding the antenna. 
To greatly drop the resistance of the antenna, a shorting stub can 
be introduced with the IC positioned inside this stub, as shown in 
Fig. 16.12. It is time consuming to better fit the impedance in practice. 
Therefore, the COMSOL Multiphysics finite-element simulation 
is used. A lot of simulations are examined. Table 16.2 indexes the 
results of a selection of antennae designs. The type of design can be 
found in the name.

The best reading distance according to the simulation should 
be the bowtie with a stub. But for this design, a lot of conductive 
inks would have to be printed. Several other designs offer the same 
simulated maximum reading range. But again, depending on the 

689
dimensions, less or more ink is needed for a correct design. The 
rectangle with a stub design is chosen as the geometry for realization. 
The principal layout of this rectangular RFID tag, the real printed 
RFID tag, and the simulations are shown in Fig. 16.13 and Fig. 16.14.

Experiments
16.2.1 Materials
The antenna can be realized by printing silver nanoparticles with 
techniques such as inkjet printing or screen printing. In the examples 
shown, inkjet printing is used, and the antennae are printed with the 
Pixdro LP50 equipped with a Konica Minolta KM512S printhead. The 
ink used is a nanoparticle solution from Suntronics in an ethanol base 
with a 20% concentration of silver nanoparticles. The particle size is 
smaller than 150 nm. With the LP50, the ink was inkjetted with 600 
× 600 dpi in a single layer. The substrate used was Epson premium 
glossy photopaper. After the paper was cleaned with an UV-ozone 
plasma, the antenna was printed. The NXP IC was placed in the stub 
and with RiteLok SL65 Epoxy glued to the antenna. Sintering was 
performed in an oven at 150°C for 90 min. Finally, several tags were 
readable up to 1.0 m. The best reading distance was at 865 MHz.
	
It is also possible to use an Epson Photo P50 as the inkjet 
printer to print the antennae. Examples are shown in Fig. 16.16. The 
disadvantage of using this printer is that it quickly becomes clogged.

16.3 Raspberry Dye Solar Cells
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are based on the idea of sensitizing 
a colorless (=does not absorb visible light) semiconductor with an 
organic dye, which can absorb light and thus produce electricity in the 
solar cell. Since dyes come in many different colors, it is now possible 
to integrate solar cells to buildings in a more visually appealing way, 
as shown in Fig. 16.17. The certified record efficiency for DSSCs was 

691
13% in 2020 [5], and uncertified efficiencies approaching 15% have 
been reported. Smestad and Grätzel showed that natural dyestuff, 
such as anthocyanins in raspberries, can work as sensitizers for 
these cells [6].

16.3.1 Principle of Operation
The dye solar cells operate in a significantly different way compared 
to the OPV devices described in Chapter 7 of this textbook and 
are based on electrochemical reactions. A sensitizer dye (usually 
a ruthenium complex, but in this experiment an anthocyanin dye 
from raspberry juice) is chemically adsorbed onto the surface of 
a highly porous TiO2 layer, which is deposited onto a transparent 
metal-oxide-coated substrate. The dye absorbs light and transfers 
the excited state electron extremely quickly (order of fs) into the 
conduction band of the TiO2. This leaves the dye missing an electron. 
The 3I−/I3− redox couple in the electrolyte diffuses to the dye, 
replaces the electron, and completes the circuit by diffusing back to 
the counter electrode and transferring the electron there. This final 
step requires a catalyst. Sometimes platinum is used, but graphite 
(e.g., from a soft lead pencil) can also work. The operating principle 
is shown in Fig. 16.18.

∑	 F-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass slides (preferably, one 
of those contains two small holes; see step 5 of the assembly 
process)
 
∑	 TiO2 paste
 
∑	 Soft lead pencil (or other source of graphite)
 
∑	 Raspberries
 
∑	 Electrolyte (The electrolyte solution consists of 0.5 M KI and 
0.05 M I2 in ethylene glycol.)
 
∑	 Hotmelt plastic frame
 
∑	 Hotmelt plastic squares
 
∑	 Glass squares cut from a microscope glass slide
 
∑	 Ethanol, acetone, isopropanol
Note: Many of these materials (not the pencil or raspberries) can be purchased from 
online suppliers, e.g., https://shop.solaronix.com/solar-cell-kits.html [8].

693
Equipment:
 
∑	 Cables and alligator clips
 
∑	 Transparent household tape and glass rod and, if possible, 
some double-sided sticky tape (alternatively a stencil printer 
or a bar/blade coater)
 
∑	 Solar simulator lamp (if available) or other strong white light 
source (absolute efficiency only possible with calibrated solar 
simulator)
 
∑	 Equipment for measuring current–voltage behavior (e.g., 
source-measure 
unit, 
potentiostat, 
or 
semiconductor 
analyzer)
16.3.3 Preparation of the Cell
It is possible to buy precoated substrates of porous TiO2 on FTO 
glass, e.g., from the supplier named earlier. However, if you have the 
paste and a suitable oven, you can also prepare the film yourself. If 
you have a stencil printer or bar coater available, this is one option. 
But you can also use the simplest possible version of bar coating:
	
1.	 Affix the FTO glass to a surface, e.g., with double-sided sticky 
tape, with the FTO side facing up.
	
2.	 Then, cover a small part of the substrate with transparent 
household tape on the left and right side. This creates a spacer 
to define the wet film height of the paste.
	
3.	 Put a small amount of the paste (e.g., with a small lab spatula) 
at the end of the substrate farthest from you.
	
4.	 Take a clean, smooth glass rod (e.g., stirring rod). Position it 
just behind the paste, then slowly draw it toward you while 
applying gentle pressure. This spreads the paste in a uniform 
thickness.
	
5.	 Let it dry at room temperature until you can safely remove the 
tape.
	
6.	 You now need to heat the substrate in an oven in air at about 
450°C for half an hour to burn off the binder and leave clean, 
porous TiO2.
	
The TiO2 film needs to be sensitized by dye. Raspberries contain 
anthocyanin dyes, which can act as a fairly efficient (though not 
extremely stable) sensitizer for dye solar cells.
Raspberry Dye Solar Cells

694
Experiments
	
1.	 Prepare a raspberry mash from the raspberries.
	
2.	 Rinse the titanium dioxide (TiO2) electrode with acetone and 
then with isopropanol. Dry the plate under nitrogen flow.
	
3.	 Insert the TiO2 electrode in the raspberry mash with the TiO2 
side facing down. Try to get rid of air bubbles under the TiO2 
film. Staining takes approximately an hour. You can also leave 

695
the electrode in the mash for overnight and continue the next 
day.
	
	
Next, the cell needs to be assembled. These are the steps:
	
1.	 Rinse the raspberry electrode with ethanol and isopropanol 
to remove the excess raspberry bits from it. Dry the electrode 
under nitrogen flow.
Raspberry Dye Solar Cells

696
Experiments
	
2.	 Rinse the counter electrode with acetone and isopropanol. 
Dry with nitrogen. Place the plastic frame on the counter 
electrode and use pencil to add carbon catalyst to the counter 
electrode. Leave space for alligator clip contacts by placing the 
frame in a similar way as in the picture.
	
3.	 Place the TiO2–raspberry electrode on top of the frame on the 
counter electrode. Put the raspberry electrode on the frame as 
seen in the figure below. The idea is to leave room for contacts 
and to minimize the risk of short circuit. If the two conductive 
glass plates touch, a short circuit is produced and your solar 
cell will not work. For this reason, try to make sure that there 
is plastic between the plates on those places where the bare 
conductive glasses are on top of each other.

697
	
4.	 Move the assembly to a hotplate preheated to 120°C. Wait 
for the plastic to melt (this takes about 10 s). Compress the 
plates together with a piece of paper so that the plastic has 
melted evenly. If the gluing is imperfect, you will observe 
uneven parts in the frame. Continue heating and compressing 
until the imperfections disappear. Unsuccessful gluing will 
cause the liquid electrolyte to leak through the holes in the 
frame. Once you are done, place the solar cell on the table with 
metallic tweezers and let it cool down. CAUTION! The plate is 
hot! Be careful not to burn your fingers. Use enough paper or 
thick gloves to protect your fingers. Use metallic tweezers to 
move the solar cell.
	
5.	 Place a drop of electrolyte on either of the holes using a pipette. 
Use the pipette to suck the electrolyte into the cavity through 
the other hole. Place a big enough drop or add another drop 
before the whole drop has been sucked in. Otherwise, you end 
up sucking air into the cavity, which you need to try to get out. 
It is quite difficult to obtain 100% filling. The area not covered 
with electrolyte will not produce current. CAUTION! Make 
Raspberry Dye Solar Cells

sure that the hood window is down and that you are wearing 
goggles. Sucking the electrolyte in may cause splashes.
	
6.	 Place a piece of plastic on top of the holes and a hot piece of 
glass on top of them. This will seal the holes.

16.3.4 Measurement
	
1.	 First of all, you—probably with the help of an assistant or 
teacher—need to set up the measurement system, i.e., the 
solar simulator (or other strong white light source) and the 
source measurement unit.
	
2.	 Place your solar cell at the point where the light beam 
intensity is 100 mW/cm2 (1 sun) if you have a solar simulator; 
otherwise, place it where the light is at its brightest. Use a 
wooden clip to keep your cell at place. Illuminate through the 
raspberry electrode.

699
	
3.	 Connect the cables from the measurement unit (the image 
below is an example; your lab may have a different setup) to 
your solar cell. Connect the ground (−) to the TiO2-raspberry 
electrode (−) and the working electrode (+) to the carbon-
coated counter electrode (+).

16.4 Flexible Supercapacitors
16.4.1 Introduction
New solutions are needed for energy storage as wireless systems 
and mobile electronics become more common and their demands 
for power consumption grow. More challenges are imposed by 
increasing cost and strict environmental requirements for products.
	
In this experiment, students are familiarized with supercapacitors. 
Supercapacitors are energy-storage components that have higher 
specific energy (J/kg) than regular capacitors and higher specific 
power (W/kg) than batteries. As you have seen in Chapter 8 on 
energy storage, supercapacitors (if they are pure electric double-
layer capacitors) create high capacitance based on the formation of a 
very thin electric double layer at the interface between electrode and 
electrolyte. In this experiment, you will fabricate and characterize a 
flexible supercapacitor based on activated carbon as electrode and 
table salt and water as electrolyte.
	
During the laboratory exercise, you will assemble a simple 
capacitor structure and perform its electrical characterization with 
the assistant. The properties and functions of supercapacitors are 
assessed based on the measured results.
16.4.2 Materials and Equipment
Supercapacitors can be fabricated with printing methods by utilizing 
conductive and porous materials. In this exercise, a supercapacitor 
Flexible Supercapacitors

702
Experiments
is prepared using stencil printing, which combines the use of a 
laboratory-scale doctor blade coater and a stencil mask to apply inks 
on a PET flexible substrate.
Materials needed for supercapacitor preparation:
 
∑	 PET/Al foil laminate coated with current collector from 
graphite ink (prepared in advance by an assistant), or optional 
graphite foil
 
∑	 Kuraray YP-80F activated carbon (AC)
 
∑	 Chitosan from shrimp shells
 
∑	 Acetic acid
 
∑	 Separator paper (e.g., TF4050 from Nippon Kodoshi 
Corporation)
 
∑	 1 M NaCl electrolyte solution in water
 
∑	 Disposable pipettes
 
∑	 Adhesive material for sealing (Paramelt Aquaseal X2277 
polyolefin)
Equipment needed:
 
∑	 Characterization interface (ideally a potentiostat or energy-
storage characterization interface, e.g., offered by Maccor, but 
optionally a good source-measure unit)
 
∑	 Electrical cables and clips
	
The supercapacitors are measured right after assembly. The 
materials are not harmful, but to protect measurement devices and to 
prevent impurities from contaminating the devices, the laboratory 
instructions must be read thoroughly before starting laboratory 
work!
16.4.3 Preliminary Questions
We recommend to answer the following questions before the 
experiments.
	
1.	 What is the function of the electrolyte in supercapacitors and 
how does it differ from batteries and electrolytic capacitors?
	
2.	 What is the basis of the large energy-storage capacity of 
supercapacitors?

703
	
3.	 What material properties should be considered when 
fabricating printable supercapacitors?
	
4.	 What are possible sources of resistance in a supercapacitor?
16.4.4 Laboratory Instructions
The PET/Al foils coated with graphite ink current collector will 
need to be prepared in advance by an assistant, following the 
procedure described in Ref. [10]. The graphite ink Acheson PF407C 
has been found to be quite suitable for supercapacitor fabrication. 
An alternative to the use of Al/PET foil and graphite ink is the use 
of a graphite foil, onto which the AC ink can be directly coated. 
Information on this procedure can be found in Ref. [11].
	
You will prepare the activated carbon electrodes and assemble the 
device. To prevent impurities contaminating the device, protective 
gloves must be worn when assembling the devices. Safety goggles 
and a laboratory coat are worn to protect from possible spatter.
	
The ink is prepared by mixing thoroughly 30.9% AC powder, 
1.7% chitosan, 0.7% acetic acid, and 66.7% water.
Fabrication Steps
These steps can be followed to assemble the device, as shown in 
Fig. 16.20:
	
1.	 A PET/Al flexible foil laminate, or a graphite foil, is used as the 
starting substrate (thickness not critical).
	
2.	 Before fabrication, the PET substrate is preheated inside the 
oven at 95°C for 15 min.
	
3.	 First, a current collector layer consisting of a graphite ink 
(Acheson Electrodag PF-407C) is applied onto the PET side of 
the substrate. (This step has been done in advance in order to 
save time.)
	
4.	 The graphite ink is then dried in the oven for 1 h at 95°C, and 
a graphite thickness of 40–50 μm is obtained. (This step has 
been done in advance in order to save time.)
	
5.	 Subsequently, activated carbon is applied using a doctor blade 
coater and a stencil to define the electrode pattern, in order to 
form an electrode layer onto the current collector layer.

705
	
6.	 The activated carbon ink is then dried at room temperature 
overnight or in the oven at 75°C for 30 min and the resulting 
film will be 50–70 μm thick.
	
7.	 A heat-sealing dispersion adhesive material (Paramelt 
Aquaseal X2277 polyolefin) is then applied onto the PET and 
part of the current collector layer.
	
8.	 The samples are then placed in the oven at 80°C for 15 min.
	
9.	 An NaCl:H2O aqueous electrolyte with a mass ratio of 1:5 is 
then added onto the electrode layer.
	 10.	 The next step is to add a paper separator onto the electrode, in 
which the electrode and the paper separator are impregnated 
with aqueous electrolyte.
	 11.	 Figure 16.20k shows the other half of the supercapacitor, 
which is shown upside down in the figure. The electrode in 
Fig. 16.20k is exactly the same pattern as the electrode in 
Fig. 16.20j, but facing downward, and without the paper 
separator.
	 12.	 In the final step, the two electrodes are packed and heat-sealed 
face to face with the help of annealed Aquaseal, as shown in 
Fig. 16.20l, upside down.
	
The final length, width, and thickness of the fabricated 
supercapacitor with the package are 50, 50, and 0.4–0.5 mm, 
respectively. The camera image of the final fabricated supercapacitor 
can be seen in Fig. 16.21.

Flexible Supercapacitors

706
Experiments
Characterization
The key electrical parameters of supercapacitors, such as 
capacitance, equivalent series resistance (ESR), and leakage current, 
can be obtained using an international industrial standard, IEC 
62391-1. If available, a dedicated workstation such as a Maccor 
4300 (Maccor Inc., USA) can be used to electrically characterize 
the supercapacitors. If this is not available, a potentiostat or 
a programmable source-measure unit can be used, but it may 
require some programming. The supercapacitors are charged and 
discharged three times between 0 and 1.2 V with a constant current 
of 1, 3, and 10 mA. The supercapacitors are then held at a constant 
voltage of 1.2 V for 30 min. The charge, hold, and discharge cycle is 
shown schematically in Fig. 16.22. The capacitance C is measured 
through a constant current discharge step between 0.96 V and 0.48 
V (roughly 80% and 40% of the maximum voltage) and is calculated 
from the discharge curve according to
	
C = I/(dV/dt) = (I(t2 − t1))/(U1 − U2)	
(16.6)
where t1,2 and U1,2 are the time and voltage at the beginning and end 
of the constant current discharge.
Figure 16.22 Charge, hold, and discharge cycle to determine capacitance and 
ESR.
	
The ESR is calculated from the initial IR drop ΔU3 at the 
beginning of the 10 mA discharge. If there is an initial curvature at 
the beginning, the straight part of the curve should be extended to 

707
the left and the IR drop taken from the maximum voltage to the value 
of the extended line at the beginning of discharge.
	
It is recommended to prepare a program using software such 
as MATLAB or other suitable options in order to make the data 
evaluation more practical.
16.5 Manufacturing a Piezo Single-Nozzle Drop-
on-Demand Device
Inkjet printing is a promising thin-film technology. The best way to 
learn more about inkjet printing is to learn bottom-up. This means 
from manufacturing an inkjet head up to making use of an inkjet 
printer. The first insights are available in patents. The United States 
Patent of Krause “Ink Jet Printer with Ink System Filter Means” 
tells us, according to the abstract, “An ink jet printing apparatus in 
which a pressure generated ink stream is produced from an opening 
through a piezoelectric transducer which produces axial vibration 
when energized to produce a stream of uniform drops.” This patent 
shows that the main aspects are:
 
∑	 Piezoelectric transducers
 
∑	 Pressure generation and prolongation of acoustic waves 
inside the ink capillary
 
∑	 The layout of a drop-on-demand (DOD) glass inkjet printer
	
A piezo-driven DOD device can be obtained using two different 
approaches: either by interrupting a continuous liquid stream on 
command or by generating single drops on demand.
	
The continuous inkjet method can be achieved by a low-cost 
manufacturing method. The construction consists of a glass orifice 
plate with a small hole, fused at the end of a glass tube. Around the 
tube, a piezoelectric cylinder is stiffly glued onto the glass. A mere 
start is welding or fusing an orifice with a diameter of 10–15 μm on a 
Pyrex Pasteur pipette. In a commercial Pasteur pipette, the capillary 
does not have the form of a straight cylinder. For that reason, 
rectangular piezo actuators are used. The result is illustrated in 
Fig. 16.23.

708
Experiments
Figure 16.23 Continuous jet, fabricated with a thin circular orifice of diameter 
ca. 12 μm, epoxy glued on a Pyrex Pasteur pipette and provided with two thin 
rectangular piezo elements.
	
The benefit of this method is the rate of producing drops, at a 
megahertz rate, with a minimum of fluid volumes. The jet is broken 
up into drops by means of an acoustic excitation. However, despite 
the simple construction and the commercially available geometry, 
the practical disadvantage is the need for high pressure on the 
fluid. Depending mostly on the size of the aperture, the hydraulic 
pressure can go up to 80 bar. By chemical means, the aperture could 
be enlarged, resulting in a lower pressure and a bigger drop volume. 
The chemicals to be used are not environmentally friendly, and the 
procedure can only be carried out by a specialist. The illustrated 
construction did not work because of the shape and size of the 
actuators and because of a non-stiff assemblage.
	
More confidence was given to variations of the piezoelectrically 
driven single DOD device.
16.5.1 Drop-on-Demand Device
There are single-nozzle systems in different assemblies but all 
working with a piezo activator. In principle, such a system consists of 

709
a cylindrical cavity surrounded by a cylindrical piezo actuator, an ink 
reservoir with a flexible tube, which gives a small under pressure, 
and one or two obstructions.
	
The construction of the capillary consists of two obstructions, in 
which the orifice has a length-to-diameter ratio of 2:1. The capillary 
size could vary in length and diameter, and the second obstruction 
should have a bigger diameter than the orifice (Fig. 16.24 and 
Fig. 16.25).

(b)
Figure 16.25 (a) Local heating of the glass pipe; (b) two different results.
	
The diameters of the capillaries and orifices are measured with a 
microscope.
	
Different types of capillaries can be made: with one or with 
two obstructions, different lengths, or with or without a glass ink 
reservoir.
	
Finally the nozzles were polished. The results are shown in 
Fig. 16.26.

(b) two obstructions with or without a glass ink reservoir. The scale bar is in 
centimeters.
	
Different types of piezo elements can be applied, for example, 
cylindrical actuators and thin rectangular piezo actuators. The best 
results were obtained by using a cylindrical piezo actuator. Such an 
activator has two solder connections on the outer side of the actuator. 
The rectangular activators have a narrow surface connected to the 
capillary. Examples are shown in Fig. 16.27.

obstructions: (a) cylindrical piezo element with the solder connections outside, 
(b) two rectangular piezo elements without an ink reservoir, and (c) two 
rectangular piezo elements with an ink reservoir.
	
The two different types of piezo activators made it necessary to 
have different power supplies available.
	
With the home-made arrangement, one can vary the pulse height 
and pulse duration to the desired level—in our case between 0 and 
200 V and between 20 μs and 120 μs, respectively. The frequency was 
limited to 70 Hz. The rise time and fall time of the pulse shape differ 
depending on whether a rectangular piezo element was used or a 
cylindrical one. The rise times were 2.5 μs and 1.5 μs, respectively. 

711
The fall times were 0.50 μs and 1.0 μs, respectively. Results are 
shown in Fig. 16.28.
(a)
(b)
Figure 16.28 Pulse shapes for the piezo elements: (a) rectangular piezo 
element on a capillary with ink reservoir and (b) cylindrical piezo element 
around a capillary without ink reservoir.
	
This shows that the rectangular constructions had a contact 
area with the glass tube, which was too small to produce good drops 
repeatedly. Also the construction was fragile. The construction with 
the cylindrical piezo activator seemed to be suitable for assistants 
and students.
16.5.2 Simulation
Simulations can be very useful to improve the understanding 
of the fluid flow and to predict or check the optimal design of an 
inkjet head. Therefore, we were grateful that COMSOL supplied 
us with a demonstrator called “dynamic_model_of_a_drop_shot_
from_an_inkjet_printer.” This is a model to be solved with COMSOL 
Multiphysics. For example, the velocity field was calculated at 
various times (results are shown in Fig. 16.29 for t = 40 µs).
