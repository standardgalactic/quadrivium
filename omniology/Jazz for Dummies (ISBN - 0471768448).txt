Introduction
A
s you begin your journey in jazz, you become a member of an enlight-
ened group. It’s not quite a cult, but it’s a devoted group that inspires a
loyalty and dedication that many people don’t understand.
Jazz is more than 100 years old and has undergone many changes. It has
never been music for the masses and has probably, with time, become more
obscure — more complex and less accessible. Jazz is a deep and amazing art
form that’s yet to find its rightful place alongside classical music or modern
art. Many people are wary of jazz, yet most people fall in love on their first
date with it. They only need the right kind of introduction.
When big-band jazz and ballroom swing dancing faded in the years after
World War II, jazz began to change. It began to move out of clubs and into
concert halls. As the ranks of jazz clubs thinned, college jazz programs
became the training grounds of new players, moving the music away from
everyday experience and everyday people. Today, school children seldom
hear jazz or learn about it, let alone play it. And radio has all but abandoned
the music it popularized during the ’30s and ’40s.
Yet jazz survives among hardcore fans who have the patience to find it in
music stores, online, and at live venues. Because the music is so emotionally
powerful, anyone can connect with it, without knowing much about it.
Trumpeter and bandleader Louis Armstrong can make you laugh; saxophon-
ist Charlie Parker can shoot an electrical jolt up your spine; and vocalist Billie
Holiday can make you cry — even if you don’t know what key the music’s in,
whether the artists are improvising, or even what makes jazz, well, jazz.
About This Book
The purpose of this book is to give your brain just enough information so 
you can find the jazz you like, and then let it connect with your heart. Jazz
can be extremely complicated, but I do my best to explain the complications
and give you insight into jazz’s more important concepts. You uncover just
enough history and theory to get a feel for jazz and begin to appreciate and
understand its major movements and musicians.
This book is written for those of you who aren’t experts but who want to feel
the jazz groove and enjoy a lifelong love affair with this original American
music. This book is also detailed enough, though, that those jazz fanatics can
find new and useful information.

There isn’t a right or wrong way to use this book. Read it right through from
front to back, stopping whenever you feel the urge to buy a new CD or musi-
cal download; spend a little more time and find out about a style of jazz or a
musician in more depth. Browse the Table of Contents and choose whatever
strikes your fancy — Louis Armstrong? Cool jazz? Austin, Texas’, jazz scene?
Or go the random route: Flop the book open and see what you find.
Each chapter is somewhat self-contained. If you’ve heard about Charlie 
“Bird” Parker and you want to get to him right away, for example, you can go
straight to Chapter 7, where you can find some bio information as well as
details on Bird’s part in the jazz of his era and some of his best recordings.
Every few pages there’s a list or a sidebar waiting for you like a bite-size bar
of good chocolate.
By presenting the information in short sections, with clear headings and
useful icons, I’ve made it so that you can use the book any way you like. If
you’re the organized, dedicated type, by all means park yourself in a comfort-
able place, begin at the beginning, and read through in order. But if you’re
impatient like me and you want to hear some great music today, thumb
through, find a page that interests you, read a few paragraphs, and start
building your music collection.
Jazz For Dummies, 2nd Edition, builds on the basics that give you enough
information to know why each musician is important and enough to know
whether you’re interested in knowing more. The rest is up to you.
Conventions Used in This Book
So you can steer your way through the world of jazz, I use a few conventions:
 If I mention a song, I put it in quotes — for example, “Mary Had a Little
Lamb.” If I mention a CD title, it’s in italics with the label following in
parentheses like this: Mother Goose’s Greatest Nursery Hits (Singing
Goose).
 I also use italics to point out defined terms or to emphasize a word.
 Boldface text indicates key words in bulleted lists.
 Monofont highlights Web addresses and e-mail addresses.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed 
to break across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I
haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the
break. So, when using one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly
what you see in this book, pretending as though the line break doesn’t
exist.

Jazz For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

What You’re Not to Read
I include a number of sidebars throughout this book; they’re the shaded gray
boxes. They’re chock-full of fun and interesting information about jazz, but
you don’t have to read them if you don’t want to.
Foolish Assumptions
Because you’re reading this book, I’ve made the following assumptions 
about you:
 You’re a newcomer interested in understanding and appreciating jazz.
 You’re a music student interested in playing jazz or a musician who
wants to find out more about jazz.
 You already love some music such as blues, funk, Latin, rock, or soul
that connects with jazz somewhere along the line.
 You’re a busy person who wants to get a lot of information in a short
time — so you might not read this book through from cover to cover.
 You’re a curious and self-motivated person eager to expand your knowl-
edge and enjoyment of music, and you may do additional research
beyond this book.
How This Book Is Organized
No matter what sort of reader you are, this book’s basic structure is logical
and user friendly.
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics
Part I lays out the basic buildings blocks of jazz: its origins, essential elements
(such as swing and improvisation), structural principles, and instruments.
What makes jazz jazz? When you get through Part I, you should have the
answer to that question.
3
Introduction

Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: 
An Evolutionary Riff
Part II traces the story of jazz from Africa to popular jazz meccas like New
Orleans, Chicago, Kansas City, New York, California, and other stops along
the way. Like any good story, this one features colorful characters: Louis
Armstrong, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Ornette Coleman, and many more of
the amazing artists who propelled jazz forward at every stage in its evolution.
Part III: The Beat Goes On: 
Jazz Appreciation 101
Part III is a practical guide to experiencing jazz in the real world. Discover
how jazz permeates popular culture from Hollywood versions of the music
and musicians to its impact on advertising, fashion, and film. In Part III, you
also determine how to throw a successful jazz dinner party, spend a night on
the town searching out great jazz clubs and concerts, and splurge on a week-
end of jazz festivals around the country.
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: 
The Jazz Musician
Part IV acknowledges the fact that there are legions of you out there who
want to play jazz, but you’re afraid or don’t know where to start. Whether
you’re 15 or 55 years old, it’s not as hard as you think to starting playing
music, so here’s how to go from crawling to walking to running, as fast as 
you can. I give you advice on how to start playing and how to join a band,
and I also give you the lowdown on technology’s impact on recording jazz.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Part V features important highlights in friendly groups of ten: great cities to
experience jazz and tips for building and enjoying your collection. If you like
to read in short bursts, begin in this part of this book.

Jazz For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part VI: Appendixes
Part VI covers a wide range of information to help you dive even more deeply
into jazz. You find more than 100 recommended records to check out, a few
trustworthy jazz labels, and jazz resources such as books, magazines,
movies, and Web sites.
Icons Used in This Book
This book uses a series of icons to point you to specific kinds of useful or
interesting information. Here’s a list:
The use of this icon is where I take the liberty of recommending a personal
favorite song, CD, event, and so on. These instances may not always be part
of every critic’s list, but they’re the baaaddest (that’s a good thing) jazz
around, in Yours Truly’s opinion.
If there’s anything anywhere you should remember, I point it out with this
icon.
This icon highlights a description of the key characteristics of a particular
player’s sound. Eventually, with some listening and perhaps a little reading,
you should be able to identify several players after hearing a few seconds of
their music.
The tip icon points out exactly what you may think it does: a tip. In a few
places, I offer a bit of advice for collecting, finding a good place to hear live
jazz, and so on. This icon points you to these bits of wisdom.
Where to Go from Here
In your hands, you’re holding almost 400 pages worth of jazz. How do you get
started? If you’re reading this intro, that’s a good place to start, but you also
get a quick overview by reading Chapter 1 and any chapter in the middle that
interests you. Or, if you want to start collecting and listening to music right
away, turn to Appendix A. You might already have a favorite player such as
Miles Davis or Charlie Parker. You can start with their short biographies and
lists of suggested CDs. Another option: Start with a style you’ve already
heard, such as swing or bebop. But if you want a thrill, dive into free jazz. It
might feel a little like bungee-jumping!

Introduction

This isn’t a high school class, and you won’t be tested. Don’t get hung up
trying to remember names, dates, spellings, and modes. Music is for listen-
ing. Jazz is best appreciated by putting on headphones and playing a CD with
your eyes closed, or hitting your local club for a taste of the real live deal. If
there’s one piece of advice I can give you, it’s this: Get into listening right
away. Go down to your favorite music store or onto your favorite music Web
site and start your collection.
I hope this book marks the beginning of a new love life full of warm fuzzies —
those moments when you’re listening to a tune and something about it gives
you goose bumps and time seems to stand still.

Part I
All That Jazz: A
Tour of the Basics

In this part . . .
P
lunging into jazz isn’t as difficult as you may think.
The music is challenging and complex, but it’s also
emotional and personal, which makes it easy for you to
connect with. Make friends with loveable characters like
Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis, who lead you into jazz
as you get to know their personalities and recordings. In
this part, I explain the basic traits of jazz and take you
back to jazz’s beginnings. I also provide some basic music 
history and theory. Then you take a look at jazz’s essential
instruments and find out what parts they play. When
you’re done, you’re ready to dive into a larger pool of
music and musicians.

Chapter 1
In the Beginning: Entering 
the World of Jazz
In This Chapter
 Surveying jazz’s traits and roots
 Knowing some elements of jazz theory
 Looking at jazz’s instruments
 Traveling through jazz history
 Growing into a jazz fan
 Becoming a jazz musician
You may not own many jazz CDs now, and you may not think you know any-
thing about jazz. Yet the music is such a part of the American experience
that it creeps in from the periphery through radio, film, television, and live per-
formances you come across by accident, through friends who unexpectedly
have jazz playing in their homes, and, these days, via hundreds of Web sites.
In the pages ahead, you dive deep into the music. In this chapter, I describe
the lay of the land of jazz, giving you details that point you in different direc-
tions, and you visit the beginnings of jazz and the theory behind the music.
You also take a trip through the land of instruments — how does jazz get its
sound? On your journey to becoming a fan, you meet the great players and
discover a bit about playing jazz yourself. By the time your travels come to
an end in this chapter, you may know which styles and periods of jazz you
want to visit first in the rest of the book.
Delving into Jazz’s Characteristics 
and Roots
Most likely, you know jazz when you hear it, but you may not be able to
describe it. Jazz’s signature traits include improvisation, individual voices,
swing, and syncopation.

 Improvisation is when a jazz musician invents what he plays — often
gathering inspiration from the melody or chords of a song but some-
times creating completely from scratch.
 Individual voices combine quantity of notes, phrasing, speed, tone, and
subtleties such as bending strings on a guitar or varieties of breathing
on a horn.
 Swing refers to jazz’s relentless forward momentum, a beat that makes
you want to move or dance or pound your hands on a table.
10
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 
How I fell in love with jazz
My relationship with jazz began in ninth grade
with Dave Brubeck, as I learned to pound out
those strange 5/4 patterns on the drum set I
chose because Ringo Starr had one. It was my
first experience with music different than and
more challenging than four-beats-to-the-bar rock
and pop. Now I had to count in fives. 1-2-3-4-5. As
I pumped that basic beat out on bass drum, I
learned how to split my brain so my hands could
move in separate syncopated patterns. It wasn’t
easy, but I learned how to do it before I learned
how to juggle three tennis balls.
But it wasn’t until high school when I really fell
in love with jazz, and the object of my affection
was Miles Davis. Given the rock and roll context
of my stadium concert teen years, Miles was
the logical place to begin, with funky beats and
electric guitars and a horn filtered through loud
electronic effects.
In between these experiences, I was touched
by jazz in other random ways that fit the music’s
bigger picture now but didn’t then because I
couldn’t see it.
 My good friend and jazz jam partner took
lessons from a cool black pianist named
Wilbur Barranco. At the time, mostly what I
knew about him was that he told my friend to
“watch the little finger” — meaning that even
the pinkie must play its part on the piano. In
recent years, I found his name in small type
on records he made with Charlie Parker.
 In high school, I briefly dated a girl who knew
a guy who played in a big band led by a trum-
peter named Maynard Ferguson. From
photos I knew he had a big shock of white
hair, and from television knew he was flam-
boyant and could hit amazingly high notes.
Later, I learned he was part of a big band
continuum that began in the swing era.
 One night before I could drive, my mom
dropped me off at a jazz festival in Berkeley,
California, at the open-air Greek Theatre. I
remember an excited guy in the audience
chanting, “John Coltrane, John Coltrane,
John Coltrane, John Coltrane . . . “ It didn’t
mean anything to me at the time, but it stayed
in my head, and today, I realize that the con-
cert took place only two or three years after
the great saxophonist’s death, so I was pre-
sent when Coltrane’s memory was alive and
many fans had first-hand experience of his
music. From that moment I began to realize
that jazz and its fans were a special group,
tightly bonded by the music, and that listen-
ing to live jazz could become a sort of spiri-
tual experience. Jazz’s mix of musical
sophistication and emotional intensity is
what keeps me in love with the music.

 Syncopation is the way jazz musicians place notes and accents before
and after the beat in ways that emphasize the beat and keep it moving.
Syncopation is what makes jazz sound so different from the more regular
rhythms of classical or pop music.
Sometimes one of these elements is more prevalent than the others, or a 
key element is entirely absent. One rule about jazz is that there aren’t many
rules. However, whether you listen to Louis Armstrong’s early music, Benny
Goodman’s swing band, Charlie Parker’s bebop, Miles Davis’s cool jazz, or
John Coltrane’s spiritual flights, you can usually find these key ingredients. 
(I cover all these folks in Part II.)
So now you may be wondering: How exactly did jazz begin? It’s a complicated
story with many footnotes, but jazz was born in New Orleans around the turn
of the 20th century when African Americans started mixing their culture with
European instruments and elements of classical music. Elemental rhythms
and soulful vocals, as well as all manner of drums and instruments including
horns and pre-banjos, came straight out of Africa. Blues that originated among
slaves and gospel from black churches were two other key ingredients. From
Europe came Adolphe Sax’s invention (guess which instrument he created?)
and other brass instruments, as well as pianos that were a part of many low-
and middle-income households and classical music that was a part of one’s
education in certain circles.
Chapter 2 is full of additional information on the traits and roots of jazz.
Getting the Lowdown on Jazz Theory
Good jazz hits you at an emotional level, but it’s also technically complex and
challenging music. Many jazz tunes use either the 12-measure structure of
blues, or the 32-measure structure of popular songs. Knowing how these
structures work, as well as a little about the rhythms that propel good jazz,
and the ways in which jazz musicians improvise, helps you gain a deeper
appreciation of the music. (I cover jazz theory in Chapter 3.)
Familiarizing Yourself with 
the Instruments of Jazz
Although any instrument can be used to play jazz, some instruments on
which new styles of jazz were invented include the following: basses, drums,
pianos, trumpets, and saxophones. Every one of these instruments has its
heroes in every era, and that’s because these instruments are best suited to
the roles required in jazz.
11
Chapter 1: In the Beginning: Entering the World of Jazz

 Basses, drums, and pianos come together as rhythm sections that propel
the music. Pianists can also play chords and melodies.
 Trumpets and saxophones carry melodies or improvise with a sound that
easily carries over the band. The sound of these horns sometimes
resembles the sound of a human voice, which is probably one reason
why these instruments convey emotions most effectively.
Head to Chapter 4 for details about these instruments and a few others used
in jazz, such as trombones, clarinets, flutes, guitars, vibraphones, and organs.
Meeting Jazz Greats throughout History
Hundreds of musicians make up the history of jazz, but a handful of talented
players stand out as essential innovators at key turning points. By following
this line of musicians, you can fill in the rest of the music’s history around
them:
 Louis Armstrong: He was the hero of New Orleans jazz and made jazz’s
first important recordings in New Orleans in the ’20s.
 Benny Goodman: Goodman was an icon of big band swing in the 1930s —
a great clarinetist and leader and one of the first to feature black and
white musicians together in a popular jazz ensemble.
 Duke Ellington: As a leader in the 1930s, he took the art of the big band
to new heights with his composing and arranging, and he was a phenom-
enal pianist who made important recordings with musicians ranging
from bassist Jimmy Blanton to avant garde saxophonist John Coltrane.
 Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker: These two men were players pri-
marily responsible for inventing bebop — a form of speedy, mostly
improvised jazz — in the 1940s.
 Miles Davis: Davis played an important part in several styles of jazz
beginning with bebop in the 1940s and continuing through laidback cool
jazz, electric jazz, jazz rock, and synthesized jazz. His interpretations of
compositions such as Gershwin’s Porgy & Bess and dozens of popular
songs set a high standard for soloists.
 John Coltrane: In the 1960s, Coltrane opened the door to free improvisa-
tion and influences from around the world.
 Ornette Coleman: He took improvisation in the 1960s to the edge of the
jazz universe.
And jazz continued to flourish beyond the 1960s. The ’70s brought more elec-
tric jazz, as pianists Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock experimented with syn-
thesizers, Miles Davis assimilated funk, rock, and soul; and the Association
for the Advancement of Creative Musicians in Chicago gave freely improvised
music a rallying point.
12
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 

Meanwhile, Latin music had a significant impact on jazz beginning with Jelly
Roll Morton’s “Spanish tinge,” continuing with Dizzy Gillespie’s use of Latin
rhythms, and the emergence of Latin jazz giants like Tito Puente.
In recent years, jazz musicians collaborated with all sorts of players from
other genres. For example:
 Dave Brubeck performed with symphony orchestras.
 Saxophonist Joshua Redman performed with the Rolling Stones.
 Herbie Hancock recorded with rock stars Carlos Santana and Sting.
Dozens of original artists over the years have contributed masterful music,
from Bix Beiderbecke to Lester Young, and musicians whose names cover the
entire middle of the alphabet. In Part II, I provide you with a brief history of
jazz from its humble beginnings to the exciting artists of today.
Jazz can’t be divided into neatly defined periods. While distinct styles emerged
in certain eras, many musicians crossed from one era into the next, radically
redefining their approach. Players in the forefront include Miles Davis and
Coleman Hawkins. In every style of jazz, you can usually hear elements 
from earlier eras. Also, remember that the history I provide is only a simple
abstraction of what really happened. For almost every example, there’s 
a counter example. Still, a basic history gives you a framework for under-
standing the music, whether everyone agrees on the parts of the frame.
Becoming a Fan
Jazz has rules and theories, but the best jazz is music that hits you at a gut
level. If you haven’t heard much jazz but you’re a patient fan of music, all 
you need to do is spend an hour listening to any of jazz’s hundreds of impor-
tant recordings. You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to connect with
Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus, or Betty Carter. All it takes is a willingness
to listen and withholding judgment until the music gets inside your head.
In Part III of this book, I give you tips on appreciating jazz to its fullest:
 Chapter 11 has details on recognizing how jazz has seeped into popular
culture, from films and advertising to fashion, literature, and beyond.
 I help you throw a jazzy dinner party in Chapter 12, with advice on
décor, playlists, jazz talk, and more.
 There’s nothing quite like a live jazz concert; in Chapter 13, I give you a
survival guide for attending shows in clubs and concert halls.
 Ready to hit the road? Chapter 14 is full of facts on jazz festivals in the
United States and around the world.
13
Chapter 1: In the Beginning: Entering the World of Jazz

Although reading a book like this may help you decide what kind of jazz you
like, how to build a collection, and where to hear live jazz, becoming a fan is
largely a personal journey guided by your own intuitions and tastes. That’s
the beauty of jazz. There’s something for everyone.
Playing Your Heart Out
If you develop a passion for jazz or even an obsession, you may want to start
playing it. Listening to some of the greats makes that idea seem intimidating,
but after you select an instrument, take some lessons, and practice. You can
begin playing a simple blues-based jazz song within weeks. If the bug hits
hard enough, you may be surprised what you can do after a year. Check out
Chapter 15 for plenty of handy advice for aspiring jazz musicians, such as
selecting an instrument, finding a teacher, and studying music in college.
Chapter 16 is the place to go if you want to take your musicianship to the
next level: joining an established band or starting your own. I give you tips on
recruiting members, being a respected leader, playing well with others, and
selecting music to play. I also show you how to publicize your band, land cool
gigs, prepare for a performance, and hit the road with minimum hassle.
Eventually, you may find yourself acquiring more CDs and audio equipment
and adding shelves to house your jazz collection, and you may even decide
to install a home studio where you can play and record your own music.
There’s nothing like the feeling of making music yourself with a few friends.
It’s one thing to listen; it’s quite another to play and to feel the music actually
flowing through your body, into your instrument, and out into the world.
Thanks to affordable digital recording and easy distribution via the Internet,
today’s jazz musicians can pursue individual styles and make a living without
having to sell millions of CDs. Many successful players today play gigs, sell
CDs and books online, and send newsletters to their growing personal mail-
ing lists. In Chapter 17, I discuss the use of today’s technology to record jazz
at home and sell it online.

Chapter 2
Altered Ears: Understanding the
Traits and Roots of Jazz
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the elements of jazz
 Visiting jazz’s heritage
 Appreciating jazz’s rhythm, harmony, melody, and sounds
 Connecting jazz to other forms of music
Jazz has a tough time of it in this modern, convenient world. People have
grown used to getting everything instantly — from fast food to fast oil
changes, Internet access, and digital photos. When it comes to music, some
people are impatient in that realm too. They often settle for what’s played 
on radio and television — places where you don’t hear much jazz these days.
Internet music Web sites and satellite radio offer endless choices, but you
have to know what you’re looking for.
Getting into jazz is like getting into gourmet food: you have to seek it out.
Sometimes the search is hard work, but when you succeed, the “meal” is
worth it. Jazz encompasses some of the most complex, diverse, and soul-
satisfying music on Earth.
If you’re relatively new to jazz, you may find it hard to understand — even
strange — and you may have trouble connecting emotionally. Don’t give up.
Many current fans felt the same way. I didn’t know quite what to make of
Miles Davis when I first heard his music — a time when most of my peers
were into Woodstock and acid rock.
The purpose of this chapter is to give you a set of altered ears, like when you
upgrade your sound system in order to hear all the nuances of the music. I’m
hooking you up with a pair of sensitive ears for hearing and appreciating jazz
from its roots and basic elements to subtler nuances.

Defining Jazz: The Swingin’ Thing
“It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)” — Duke Ellington wrote
that homage to jazz. Singer and bandleader Cab Calloway popularized it.
Critics and historians expend thousands of words attempting to define jazz,
but Cab covered most of it in just 11 words. After all the searching, only a
handful of elements exist that musicians and experts commonly accept as
defining characteristics of jazz.
Although listeners may not agree on which music and musicians qualify as
jazz, at a basic level, you can identify jazz by a few distinguishing traits: 
swing and syncopation, improvisation, bent notes and modes, and distinctive
voices. Chapter 3 covers these in more detail.
Swing and syncopation
Swing is the rhythmic momentum that makes you want to dance or snap 
your fingers to a good jazz tune. Part of what makes jazz swing is the use of
syncopation.
Syncopation is the technique of placing accents or emphasis in surprising
places. When jazz truly swings, the beat bombards you, even if the players
emphasize the beat by playing right with it some moments or just before or
after it at other times.
To get a better understanding of what I’m talking about, think of classical
music. Classical music is primarily written music — musicians rely on sheet
music which shows them phrasing, where the beats fall, and what notes to
play. Jazz, on the other hand, is felt. Sure, a lot of jazz standards (songs known
and played by many musicians) exist as sheet music, but usually only in an
outline form showing the basic changes (chord structure) of the song and its
melody. (I cover chords and melody in the section “Hearing harmony and
melody” later in this chapter.) The swing feel and syncopation can’t be cap-
tured in musical notation, only in live jazz, where players either have the
rhythmic stuff, or they don’t.
To hear what syncopation sounds like, take a look at a common holiday song:
“Jingle Bells.” Sing the first line the usual way, just like you learned it:
“Jin-gle bells, jin-gle bells, jin-GLE all the way.”
The “GLE” on the third “jingle” gets special emphasis (at least that’s the way I
learned it).
16
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 

Now sing it a few times and change some accents like this:
“JIN-gle bells, JIN-gle bells, jin-gle . . . ALL . . . the way.”
Make up your own interpretations. Try it with other songs such as “Twinkle,
Twinkle Little Star” or “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” The variation is the
basic idea behind syncopation. And when you get a few players bouncing
these ideas back and forth, some of them hitting one beat harder, others hit-
ting a different beat harder, you begin to feel the magic of great jazz.
Improvisation
Good jazz demands tremendous technical and creative ability because its
players invent at least half of the music spontaneously. Famous jazz tunes
have familiar melodies set to consistent chord changes, but legendary jazz
players from trumpeter Louis Armstrong to saxophonists Lester Young and
Charlie Parker made their mark with their phenomenal ability to improvise.
The melody and changes of a jazz tune make up a framework and starting
point for exploring the possibilities of a song. (See “Hearing harmony and
melody” later in this chapter for details on melody and chords.)
Blues has the most basic structure for improvising in jazz. A basic blues song
comprises 12 measures or bars. (Blues that most people can instantly recog-
nize is commonly called 12-bar blues: Each bar, or measure, contains four
beats.) Here’s a basic blues song, invented on the spot.
Wait . . . before you sing, start tapping your foot slowly and steadily: 1-2-3-4,
1-2-3-4. Each line gets one measure or group of four beats.
“Well, I woke up this morning . . .
took down my Dummies book.
(pause)
(pause)
“Well, I woke up this morning . . .
took down my Dummies book.
(pause)
(pause)
“Put on some Coltrane
man my soul was shook.”
(pause)
(pause — and back to the beginning!)
17
Chapter 2: Altered Ears: Understanding the Traits and Roots of Jazz

Now, expand the song on your own. Make up a couple more verses and invent
your own words, melody, and accents.
Congratulations! You’ve now completed a basic seminar in improvisation.
And while 12-bar blues is just one simple structure used in jazz, you’re start-
ing to get a feel for how jazz players invent music within a framework.
Bent notes and innovative modes
Jazz players often use note combinations that can’t be produced on a piano.
They bend a note (by bending a string on guitar or sliding between notes on a
saxophone) to alter its pitch and make a sound that doesn’t exist in the west-
ern chromatic scale (start at middle C on a piano, and move up key by key to
B, just before the next C. Those 12 tones constitute the western chromatic
scale). Bent notes help give jazz its mystery, tension, and energy.
Another unusual jazz technique is the use of modes. Modes are various scales
or groups of notes. The term modal jazz refers to a new approach pioneered
by Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and others in the late ’50s and early ’60s (see
Chapters 7 and 8 for more about these periods in jazz). Instead of using rapid
chord changes that required a soloist to employ many different scales, modal
jazz songs (and improvisations) build around one or two scales — either chro-
matic scales or scales from Indian, African, Arabic, and other world music.
Many nonwestern scales subdivide an octave into smaller increments, or
microtones. Arabic scales, for instance, have 17, 19, or 24 notes; an Indian
scale has 22.
Coltrane and Davis were early explorers of modal jazz, along with some of
their peers. Tunes such as Davis’ “So What” and Coltrane’s famous version of
Richard Rodgers’ “My Favorite Things” exemplify the dark, meditative, myste-
rious vibe of modal jazz. Here are a few more great modal jazz recordings:
 Coltrane’s “Impressions”
 Davis’s “Flamenco Sketches” and “Milestones”
 Pianist Bill Evans’ “Peace Piece”
 Saxophonist Wayne Shorter’s “Footprints”
Other American music, including Broadway show tunes and modern classical
compositions, uses many more different chords and scales instead of modal
jazz’s minimalist approach. These types of music possess their own assets,
including surprising melodies and intricate harmonies, but they don’t give
the same freedom to a soloist that modern jazz does.
18
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 

In addition, the leader of a jazz group may say, “I like these nine notes.
Improvise with them any want you want, but only choose from these nine
notes.” That’s also modal. And guess what? It’s also okay, and it’s part of 
the invention and innovation that keep jazz evolving and exciting.
Distinctive voices
In the same way that every person has a distinctive voice, so does every jazz
musician. With experience, you can detect variations in phrasing (the way a
musician puts together a string of notes, similar to our patterns of speech),
tone, rhythmic sense, improvisational style, and other elements that mark
each player’s musical personality. These original voices characterize modern
jazz, which is often music designed to showcase great soloists and their
voices. For example:
 Miles Davis played the trumpet in a muted whisper.
 Charlie Parker’s saxophone had a sharp edge, and he soloed with phe-
nomenal speed and variety.
 Jo Jones, on drums, invented a symphony of sounds using only his 
cymbals.
With a little listening experience, you can recognize the distinctive voices of
many players. A jazz musician isn’t only a musician, but also he’s an unusual
type of composer who invents music spontaneously and whose style and pref-
erences affect his performance just as much as the structure of the song does.

Chapter 2: Altered Ears: Understanding the Traits and Roots of Jazz
So where did the word jazz come from, anyway?
Jazz. Everyone may assert some idea of what it
sounds like, right? Hip or mellow, hot or cool,
Dixieland or avant garde, most anyone with a
casual interest in music uses the word jazz. But
just as attempts to define jazz clearly have stirred
decades of debate, so has the use of the very
word jazz.
Origins of the word jazz are hazy and theories
abound. In its original connotation, jazz was jass.
The word came out of bars and bordellos where
early jazz was born in places like New Orleans,
with its notorious Storyville red light district (see
Chapter 5). Perhaps African Americans coined
the term themselves to describe their music
during its formative years, when jazz was used
as a verb. A musician may have said, “Jazz it up,”
when he wanted a band to pick up a song’s pace
and swing hard. In various literature from the
past, the word has been spelled jasz, jascz, jas,
jass, jaz, and jazz. Jazz was also a euphemism for
sex.
Maybe jazz, like other words, takes its meaning
from its sound, or its sound from its meaning. On
that basis, jazz can mean to hit, or strike, or
launch, or some such short, quick stroke or
action. While stories of the word’s origins vary,
one thing about the word jazz is certain: No two
people, whether they’re writers, historians, musi-
cians, or fans, can agree on exactly what jazz
means or where it came from.

Back in the Golden Days: 
Digging the Roots of Jazz
Although jazz is performed by musicians of many colors and mixes elements
of many kinds of music, it’s essentially African-American music. Interwoven
with jazz’s history is the history of the black experience in America. However,
European music and blues also influenced jazz. The following sections cover
these influences in more detail. (Chapter 5 includes more details about the
creation of jazz.)
Adapting West African traditions
Essential elements of jazz arrived in America in 1619 with the first Africans
brought as “cargo” by Dutch sailors who landed in Jamestown, Virginia.
Various African musical elements that eventually surfaced in jazz came from
areas where slaves were taken along the West African coast, known as the
Ivory Coast or Gold Coast, stretching from Dakar in the north to Congo in the
south, and including Senegal, Ghana, Guinea, Dahomey (now part of Benin),
and the Niger delta. Many of the Africans sold into slavery weren’t common-
ers but, instead, were kings and priests who led tribal rituals and musical per-
formances. Among the tribes raided for slaves were the Yoruba, Ibo, Fanti,
Ashanti, Susu, and Ewe; many of these musicians eventually became leading
performers in both black and white cultures in the New World.
Various traders preferred slaves from particular regions and tribes, and the
traditions of those slaves influenced the music in the traders’ home regions.
For example, the French acquired Dahomeans. Thus, Dahomeans who wor-
shipped vodun (spirit) and the snake god, Damballa, brought rituals to New
Orleans that became known as voodoo — elements of which appeared in
early blues and jazz. Various bluesmen referenced mojo hands and black cats,
and jazz pioneer Jelly Roll Morton blamed a voodoo curse for ill health and a
declining career. I think you can hear a dark, mystical strain in his music. (See
Chapter 5 for more about him.)
In Africa, music was a vital part of daily life and members of a community all
participated. African musicians played a variety of string, percussion, and
wind instruments, but after these musicians landed in America, they adapted
to a new array of drums, fiddles, trumpets, French horns, and other instru-
ments. Musicians found themselves relocated within a musical culture par-
tially based on formal notation instead of the unwritten and improvised
traditions of Africa, where griots — resident tribal poet-historians — sang and
told tales that preserved tribal history, arts, philosophy, and mythology.
Much of the adaptation to the new musical setting occurred in white
churches, where slaves were taught to read music from hymnals and song
20
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 

books and where they often performed alongside white people at services.
The harsh change was difficult for African musicians who found their music
restrained or redirected along Euro-American lines, yet the blending of
African rhythms, melodies, harmonies, and improvisation, with more formal
Euro-American music, was at the heart of the invention of jazz (see Chapter 5
for details on jazz’s invention).
Even in the early stages, the impact of African musicians on American music
began to emerge. Here are key elements:
 Call and response: like when a preacher or dance leader shouts a state-
ment, and his audience shouts back; when instrumentalists have a “con-
versation” consisting of traded musical “statements”
 Improvisation: embellishment around a song’s primary melody
 Pentatonic scales: five-tone scales later used as primary scales in blues
 Polyrhythms: the overlapping of different rhythmic patterns
 Swing or forward momentum: a sense of urgency created by relentless
rhythmic drive
 Syncopation: rhythmic accents around the underlying beat
I cover these elements in more detail in Chapter 3.
Borrowing from European classics
European musical traditions also make up a vital part of jazz. Elements like
swing and improvisation (which I cover earlier in this chapter) found their
way into jazz from Africa, but jazz’s major instruments, including the piano,
saxophone (invented in Belgium about 1840 by Adolphe Sax), and assorted
horns came to jazz by way of Europe.
If you talk to a musicologist — someone who studies origins of music and
instruments — you may hear that many European instruments resemble
modified versions of instruments from the Middle East and Africa.
Largely because of the availability, popularity, and portability of violins, slaves
received training in classical music and performed a range of music that also
included dance and folk. Violin was the most popular instrument for slaves,
and in the 1700s, they sometimes accompanied their owners to colleges such
as William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, for musical education. In 1770,
blacks were part of the first U.S. performance of Handel’s “Messiah” by the
Trinity Church choir of New York. This classical training eventually turned up
in jazz. Violin found its way into jazz in the ’20s, thanks to Stephane Grappelli,
Stuff Smith, and Joe Venuti, who used violins to play the same sorts of
melodies and solos as saxophonists and trumpeters.
21
Chapter 2: Altered Ears: Understanding the Traits and Roots of Jazz

Blacks who worshipped at Episcopal, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Roman
Catholic churches in East Coast cities such as Baltimore, Charleston, New
York, and Philadelphia often received training in European music including
classical. During the 18th and 19th centuries, some congregations (and
choirs) were interracial. Northern cities included blacks in cultural events; in
some cases, African Americans formed their own cultural societies, such as
the Philadelphia Library Company of Colored Persons, which, beginning in
1833, presented concerts, lectures, and debates.
Contrary to the common belief that jazz was created primarily by uneducated
blacks with roots in blues, folk, and field chants, African Americans had the
ability to read music and to play classical and other styles of music well
before the inception of jazz. Jazz pioneers such as Scott Joplin, Jelly Roll
Morton, and James P. Johnson brought sophisticated musical knowledge to
their music. (I cover these pioneers in more detail in Chapter 5.)
While jazz musicians brought classical elements into jazz, classical composers
borrowed from African-American music. This transferring of styles proves 
that even before the invention of jazz and before African-American music was
valued by American universities, concert halls, and arts patrons, the quality
and originality of black music had already captivated the leading artists of
classical music.

The New Orleans jazz connection
New Orleans is best known for public perfor-
mances of raw African music and dance by
slaves in Congo Square and is an ethnically
diverse city where Creoles (people of mixed eth-
nicity, such as African, Cuban, French, and
Spanish) received formal training in music,
including classical and opera. The famed French
Opera House opened in 1859, and many of its
most popular performers were Creole. In early
New Orleans, Creoles, due to their European
roots, enjoyed superior status to African
Americans. But in 1890, the Louisiana Legislature
enacted Code 111, which made the Creole equal
in status to the newly freed slaves which was a
big blow to the Creoles. Most of the Creoles had
slaves themselves and now they were forced to
a lower social status. This change was a cata-
lyst for the start of what is called jazz as it forced
these two cultures to come together — the
Creoles with their formal training and the raw-
ness of the newly freed slaves.
New Orleans played an essential role in the 
formative years of jazz legends like Louis
Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton (a Creole), and
King Oliver (see Chapter 5). The great myth is
that early jazz players honed their craft in hazy
bars and whorehouses, but many of the early
greats combined formal training with perfor-
mances in a variety of contexts such as parades
and Sunday concerts in parks.

In turn, classical composers such as Bartok and Debussy inspired jazz bassist
and composer Charles Mingus. These classical composers utilized folk music
in their creations. Mingus, in the ’50s and ’60s, composed ambitious suites
such as “The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady” (1963) that, like pieces by Bartok
and Debussy, combined a variety of influences (blues, jazz, folk, classical) into
an elaborate piece that explored various themes using an 11-piece ensemble.
(Chapter 8 has more info about Mingus.)
From Joplin and Johnson, to Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, Gil Evans,
and, today, Maria Schneider, some jazz composers have brought a knowledge
of classical arranging, composing, and musical theory to their masterful jazz
compositions.
Adding some blues
Jazz partially builds on the blues, and some jazz directly grows on a blues
foundation, utilizing the structure of the traditional blues known as 12-bar
blues. (See the section “Improvisation” earlier in this chapter for an example
of the 12-bar blues in action.)
The tradition of call and response, and more simply improvisation, is a big
part of jazz. In good blues, jazz, and gospel, players listen intently to each
other’s playing, and have an almost intuitive connection — an uncanny sixth
sense felt between musicians. Here are some examples:
 In the gospel church, the preacher sings out a line of sermon, and his
congregation tosses it back to him.
 In blues and jazz, one musician plays or sings something, and another
player throws it back in slightly new, altered form, adding a new varia-
tion to the theme and exploring a song further.
 Still another player may take a swing at the musical phrase, even adding
a new melodic run.
Some of the earliest jazz musicians were vocalists who branched into jazz
from roots in blues. Some notable singers give jazz its bluesy beginnings:
 Ida Cox
 Ma Rainey
 Jimmy Rushing
 Bessie Smith
 Mamie Smith
23
Chapter 2: Altered Ears: Understanding the Traits and Roots of Jazz

 Jack Teagarden
 Ethel Waters
 Louis Armstrong
Known to jazz fans primarily as a trumpeter, Armstrong was also a singer
from the start, and his singing rooted in blues. Armstrong’s singing behind
the beat, stretching words over several notes, reinterpreting melodies, and
improvising (scat-singing), all characterized the blues that he imported into
jazz. (See Chapter 5 for more about Armstrong.) Other bluesmen who impro-
vised with voices and guitars and whose inventive techniques influenced jazz
include Lonnie Johnson, Robert (“Crossroads”) Johnson, and Leadbelly.
On her 1926 recording of W.C. Handy’s “St. Louis Blues,” Bessie Smith was
joined by Louis Armstrong on trumpet in a performance that melded Smith’s
earthy blues vocals with Armstrong’s jazz trumpet, providing an important
early link between the genres.

Dummies (Wiley) by Lonnie Brooks and Cub Coda.
The Real Deal: Appreciating 
Genuine Jazz
When you begin to feel rhythms, hear harmonies and melodies, and get an
incredible rush from jazz’s amazing improvisers, then you know you’re on 
the road to becoming a bona fide jazz fan. “Getting it” requires multitask 
listening. To truly appreciate jazz, you need to identify each part (bass line,
melody, harmony, improvisation) and at the same time hear how all of the
parts fit together. And when the music gets under your skin, there’s no telling
how far you may take this new love affair.
Before I go into greater detail in the following sections, take your new knowl-
edge of jazz for a test drive. Cue up some jazz from Louis Armstrong, Lester
Young, or Charlie Parker and listen to how some of the following elements
jump out of the music:
 Bassists anchor the bottom end, help drive the rhythms, and play musi-
cal counterpoint to other instruments.
 Drummers fuel the engines, propelling the music forward, also interact-
ing with all other instrumentalists to provide rhythmic variety.
 Guitarists and pianists hook up with bassists and drummers to keep
time but also provide rich harmonic textures, melodies, and solos.
24
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 

 Trumpeters, saxophonists, and singers lead the melody and improvise
melodic lines around the chords and rhythms.
 All players use a telepathic empathy that makes the parts of jazz come
together, but within this new creation, however, you can still detect the
individual personalities of each of jazz’s elements.
Chapter 3 covers more about the musical theory behind jazz.
Tapping the rhythm section
Jazz usually has a juicy beat that you can feel. A basic difference between
swing and a stiffer beat stems from the placement of accents. People who’re
unfamiliar with jazz often clap on the first and third beat in every group of
four. Jazz audiences, by contrast, usually emphasize two and four, with a
looser, swing feeling that dates back to gospel music in African-American
churches. (See Part III for how to become an informed jazz audience member.)
Although some jazz encompasses complex or irregular rhythms that may
escape the tap of your foot, most jazz retains a steady beat embellished by
the drummer and other players. If jazz is tough for you to appreciate, its
rhythms offer the easiest point of access. You don’t have to know a lot of
theory to connect with this exciting energy.
Here are some tips to follow to begin feeling the rhythm of jazz:
 Listen to Louis Armstrong or some other early jazz performers. Tap your
foot, clap your hands, or move your body. Try to feel the music, and
listen to the way various instruments carry the rhythms. Although all
jazz players tie into the music’s rhythms, “rhythm sections” have pri-
mary rhythmic responsibility.
 Identify the rhythm section by remembering that it usually consists of
standup bass (or tuba), drums, and sometimes piano or guitar (these
versatile instruments can also play harmonies and melodies, which I
cover in the next section).
 Concentrate on the drummer while you tap your foot to the music. Hear
how he fills in assorted rhythms all around the primary beat, usually
carried by his right foot as it tromps on a pedal that pounds his bass
drum.
 Listen to the bassist (or tuba player) and hear how these bottom-end
instruments secure the rhythms with their steady thumping.
25
Chapter 2: Altered Ears: Understanding the Traits and Roots of Jazz

Hearing harmony and melody
Harmony is the way two or more notes sound together. With 88 keys on a
piano, the harmonic possibilities are nearly infinite. Melody is a series of
single notes that together make a musical statement. Melody is what most
people commonly call the tune of a song.
Harmony and melody form a vital partnership. Within a jazz song, harmony
works on several levels:
 A guitar player or pianist plays chords — combinations of notes. These
notes harmonize with each other in various ways.
 A singer or sax player adds a melody over the chords. So the melody
harmonizes with the chords.
 A bass player adds another line of music beneath the chords and pri-
mary melody, adding yet another layer of harmony.
As you get into jazz by Louis Armstrong, Lester Young, Miles Davis, and other
legendary jazz players, listen to each new song six times in a row . . . or more.
In the first time through, listen for basic rhythms, chords, and melodies. Now
go back and listen for harmony. After you feel comfortable with basic
rhythms, chords, harmonies, and melodies, start paying attention to the ways
in which players improvise.
But how can you tell when they’re improvising? It’s not always easy.
Sometimes, even when playing a familiar song, jazz musicians alter the basic
melody. Sometimes you may still recognize it. Other times, familiar songs
sound like new songs because of the way jazz musicians reinvent them. In the
most common type of jazz song, the band plays the song’s signature melody
all the way through once before the improvisation begins. Then they usually
end the song by playing the melody again.
Comparing jazz’s musical personalities
The joy of getting into jazz comes when you begin to recognize the players’
“voices.” Jazz’s legendary players embrace special sounds of their own:
 Louis Armstrong: spirited cornet and warm, gruff vocals.
 Miles Davis: muted, whispery trumpet
 Charlie Parker: sharp, speedy alto sax
 Lester Young: smooth, sexy tenor saxophone
26
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 

Listen to various versions of the same tune to distinguish different voices. 
A prime example: “Body and Soul.” Tenor saxophonists Lester Young and
Coleman Hawkins were contemporaries (see Chapter 6). But Hawkins’ readily
available 1939 recording of the song is very different from Young’s versions 
of the same tune. The comparison offers a straightforward way to hear how
each group combines harmony and melody, how they improvise, and what
qualities distinguish their individual voices on saxophone.
Each player was an early modernist but in different ways. Young’s versions
are generally characterized by
 Slower tempo: Both musicians played up-tempo tunes, but Young 
leaned toward slower songs and ballads that showcased his lyrical
improvisations.
 Reverence for the basic melody: Traces of this admiration can be found
in his solos, where Young incorporated aspects of a song’s original
melody in his solos.
 Long, flowing lines of melody and improvisation, and fewer notes in
each line: As a forerunner of ’50s cool jazz, which I cover in Chapter 7,
Young preferred a languid, understated approach that gave his music an
easy flowing quality.
 Slurry, gentle, and breathy tone: Young’s sound romanced your emo-
tions as you listened to his music.
Hawkins’ landmark version of “Body and Soul” exhibits other traits:
 Abandonment of the written melody, in favor of new melodies that
Hawkins improvises over the original chords as played by his band
 Faster, edgier melodic lines, and greater density of notes in his improvi-
sation
 Gentler tone but with more definition to each note.
From here, your explorations into jazz include many similar comparisons.
Most great jazz players recorded versions “standard” tunes, especially bal-
lads. These standards give you a chance to compare the ways in which the
best players from different eras interpret the same songs. Discover, for
instance, how Fats Waller’s original “Honeysuckle Rose” differs from subse-
quent interpretations by Oscar Peterson and many other jazz greats, or, 
especially, how the great trumpeters, saxophonists, and vocalists compare 
in their treatment of tunes.

New Edition: Updating the Jazz Tradition
Beyond the basic elements I cover in the section “The Swingin’ Thing: Defining
Jazz” earlier in this chapter, what exactly constitutes jazz varies from one
critic, historian, or musicologist to another. For example, does saxophonist
Kenny G play jazz? Some radio stations say he does, but I don’t think so.
Kenny G is a technically proficient player, but his music has none of the swing
or compelling urgency that I associate with jazz. A more accurate label for his
music may be instrumental pop, and in fact, in various interviews Kenny G has
agreed his music isn’t truly jazz.
In the following sections I describe various branches of jazz and several
forms of music borrowed from traditional jazz.
Considering avant garde, 
free, and acid jazz
Does that frantic noise known as free jazz, abstract jazz, or avant garde jazz
qualify as jazz? By the late 1960s, some musicians attempted to stretch jazz’s
boundaries by making music with minimal structure and no consistent sense
of swing. Ironically, many of these musicians trained in more traditional
forms of jazz, and the music of artists such as Anthony Braxton and the Art
Ensemble of Chicago obviously demonstrates improvisation, distinctive
voices, and polyrhythms in abundance. Clearly, it does qualify as jazz (and I
go into a bit more detail on these forms in Chapter 8).
What about the 1990s music known as acid jazz? Is it really jazz? Not by my
definition. Although some acid jazz uses traditional instruments, other exam-
ples borrow sound electronically from other music, so the end result tends 
to have a more layered, electronic sound that’s distinct from most of jazz’s
earthier, spontaneous aura. Acid jazz’s rhythms, usually simple and some-
what repetitious, are danceable but lack the creative power of jazz’s
polyrhythms. I give you a bit more detail on the style in Chapter 10.
Linking to other relevant music forms
Besides blues, give-and-take exists between jazz and seemingly unrelated
genres including Western Swing. For instance, in the ’30s and ’40s, Bob Wills
and the Texas Playboys made some of the all-time coolest music. Their sound
may not be pure jazz, but jazz fans can love it because it contains essential
jazz ingredients.
28
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 

Bob Wills, a fiddler, grew up working Texas cotton fields alongside African
Americans and was a big fan of black music and musicians including Bessie
Smith. Although the Texas Playboys provided a twangy, countrified backdrop,
the improvisations fit within a jazz context: The members of the group
included
 Bob Wills, improvisations
 Eldon Shamblin, guitarist
 Jimmy Wyble, guitarist
 Cameron Hill, guitarist
 Noel Boggs, steel guitarist
Wyble and Hill were big fans of early swing and bebop’s guitarist Charlie
Christian (see Chapter 6 for more about him), and you can hear his influence
in their work with Wills. Like Christian’s, their guitar solos come as strings of
single notes and are delivered with a Charlie Christian–like sense of swing.
Through the years, Broadway musicals and jazz also enjoyed a close relation-
ship. Musicals penned by Scott Joplin, James P. Johnson, and Duke Ellington
brought jazz to the Broadway stage (or, in the case of Joplin, were aimed at
Broadway — his ambitious “Treemonisha,” completed in 1910, didn’t make its
Broadway debut until 1975, which shows how long it can take for audiences to
catch up with art). George Gershwin’s “Porgy and Bess” (1935) included jazz-
influenced tunes such as “Summertime,” and Leonard Bernstein’s music for
“West Side Story” (1957) utilized bold jazz rhythms and horn arrangements.
Jazz also borrowed from Broadway. Famed Broadway tunesmiths such as
Harold Arlen, Irving Berlin, George and Ira Gershwin, Lorenz Hart, Richard
Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, and Cole Porter wrote dozens of show tunes
that became so-called standards of the jazz repertoire. A lot of the most memo-
rable jazz is created when virtuoso players take these songs and remake them
in their own styles. For example,
 John Coltrane’s version of Rodgers’ “My Favorite Things”
 Charlie Parker’s renditions of Vernon Duke’s “April in Paris”
 Jimmy McHugh’s “I’m in the Mood for Love”
 Ella Fitzgerald’s and Miles Davis’s interpretations of Gershwin’s
“Summertime”

The Scheme of Things: 
Elements of Jazz Theory
In This Chapter
 Beginning with the basic structures of jazz songs
 Looking at elements of rhythm
 Investigating methods of improvisation
Jazz is music that you can love immediately on many levels. Swinging
rhythms make you tap your foot right away. Improvisations by great 
players like Coleman Hawkins and Lester Young grab hold of your emotions.
Battling horn sections in big bands get you as excited as watching two sides
try to out-cheer each other at a big college football game.
Yet jazz is also complex and subtle music that has finally earned its place as
an American art form worthy of the same intelligent consideration as classi-
cal music or great paintings. A lot of thought and genius have gone into the
best jazz. A deeper appreciation of its inner workings help you appreciate the
music on many levels and open your mind to more challenging forms of jazz.
In this chapter, you go deeper into some of the theories behind the music,
with an emphasis on improvisation — jazz’s central element. After you’re fin-
ished, you can experience the music intellectually and emotionally. The mix
of these two elements gives jazz its durability. Great jazz is music you can
return to again and again and discover something new and amazing.
Playing in Bars: Basic Song Structures
Over the past 100 years, jazz’s repertoire has grown to thousands of pieces.
Within that large catalog of music, jazz has different organizing principles.
Even in jazz with extensive improvisation, musicians often rely on a basic
structure.

Measures (or bars) are the basic units of music. A measure is each space
between vertical lines on a written piece of music. Each measure in a piece 
of music usually contains four beats; a beat is the time it takes to tap your
foot once. Groups of measures, most often in groups of 12 or 32, provide the
framework for most jazz tunes. These forms came to jazz from blues, march-
ing band music, popular songs, and ragtime. Think of these structures as
paragraphs that come together to tell the musical story of a song.
In the following sections, I describe two of jazz’s most common song struc-
tures: 12-bar and 32-bar. I also give you a few pointers on how to start recog-
nizing different formats when you listen to jazz.
Getting the hang of 12-bar blues
Blues, a common form in jazz (see Chapter 2 for blues details), usually comes
in standard 12-bar form. Each verse of a song contains 12 bars; those 12 bars
divide into three 4-bar sections. And each bar contains four beats. A 12-bar
chorus of a familiar blues song like “Kansas City” goes (assuming you know
the melody):
I’m going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
(Pause for four beats)
(Pause for four beats)
I’m going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
(Pause for four beats)
(Pause for four beats)
They got some crazy little women there
And I’m gonna get me one
(Pause for four beats)
(Pause for four beats)
Another verse follows using the same 12-bar structure:
I’m gonna be standin’ on the corner
of 12th Street and Vine
32
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 

(Pause for four beats)
(Pause for four beats)
I’m gonna be standin’ on the corner
of 12th Street and Vine
(Pause for four beats)
(Pause for four beats)
With my Kansas City baby
My bottle of Kansas City wine
(Pause for four beats)
(Pause for four beats)
Now, as in most any song, comes the drama in the form of a transition section
called the bridge. It also fits the 12-bar structure, but its first few lines (through
“I’m goin’ just the same”) provide contrast with the rest of the piece. Without
pauses in between, these lines — each spread over four beats — pick up the
song’s momentum:
I might take a train
I might take a plane
But if I have to walk
I’m goin’ just the same
I’m goin’ to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
(Pause for four beats)
(Pause for four beats)
They’ve got some crazy little women there
And I’m gonna get me one

There are many examples of the 12-bar format in jazz, from the New Orleans
Rhythm King’s “Tin Roof Blues” to Duke Ellington’s “Koko” and Thelonious
Monk’s “Misterioso.”

Chapter 3: The Scheme of Things: Elements of Jazz Theory

Examining the 32-bar format
Besides 12 bars, another familiar structure in jazz is the 32-bar format of
many standards — songs written in the ’30s and ’40s by popular composers
that were adopted by jazz musicians who used their catchy melodies and
smart chord changes as a basis for improvisation. (See “Just Wingin’ It:
Methods of Improv” later in this chapter for details about melodies, chords,
and improvisation.) Songs that became popular among jazz musicians
include “I Got Rhythm,” “I Thought About You,” “Over the Rainbow,” and
“Stella By Starlight.”
Most 32-bar standards are divided into four 8-bar sections, in a form known
as AABA: three similar A sections, and a B section in the middle in which the
melody and chords change. Within an 8-bar section, every bar has four beats.
Dramatically, the sections tell a story or run through a range of emotions.
As originally written, some 32-bar songs have introductions or lead-ups, and
many also have a coda — a short extension on the end that wraps up the
song. Most jazz players, however, compress standards into 32-bar form.
Here’s how the form works:
 The musical theme, or primary melody, is stated in the first A section.
 The second A is a variation that includes the second verse of lyrics.
 The B section provides contrast by introducing a new segment of
melody (and, in songs with lyrics, a line that somehow reflects on the
mood or theme of the piece). In a short story or novel, this would be 
the point where the action peaks, where the story reaches its dramatic
climax, where the hero comes face to face with his or her ultimate 
challenge.
 After overcoming that challenge, or in music, after that musical high
point is attained, the final A section provides resolution, or, if you want,
a (usually) happy ending. Its structure is similar to those of the first two
A sections.
In summary, then, the 32-bar structure looks like this:
A
statement
A
repetition
B
contrast
A
return
34
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 

Compare the 12-bar blues structure with the 32-bar pop song structure.
They’re similar. Each begins with a melodic A theme that is repeated. Each
includes a contrasting B section that builds emotion. While the 32-bar form
repeats the original theme as an ending, the 12-bar structure ends with a B
section — although if you listen to most any blues song, it has a few notes at
the end of this section that act as a natural conclusion to the series of three
sections.
Tuning your ears to different forms in jazz
Although 12 bars and 32 bars are the most common forms, modern jazz uses
a variety of others. Knowing these two, however, gives you enough knowl-
edge to start recognizing forms of jazz music.
When listening to a jazz song, tap out the time with your foot and begin
counting the number of 4-bar measures in your head. Many times you easily
detect the 32-bar structure. Other times, you discover an alternative form.
For example, Dave Brubeck composes songs around sections of unusual
lengths, such as five or seven beats; free jazz players (see Chapter 8) proceed
without an established structure to guide them, inventing the music as they
go along, so that different sections come in different lengths.
One of the most rewarding things for jazz lovers is listening to several of our
heroes play their versions of familiar standards. Here are some CDs you can
use for comparison:
 Miles Davis, My Funny Valentine (Sony): This live 1964 album features
the great trumpeter with one of his finest groups (bassist Ron Carter,
tenor saxophonist George Coleman, pianist Herbie Hancock, drummer
Tony Williams), improvising beautifully on standards such as “All of
You,” “My Funny Valentine,” and “I Thought About You.” See Chapters 7
and 8 for more about Miles.
 Charlie Parker, Charlie Parker Plays Standards (Verve): This CD
includes Bird’s freewheeling versions of “Love for Sale,” “I Got Rhythm,”
and “Embraceable You.” Check out Chapter 7 for more about Charlie.
 Ella Fitzgerald, Song Books CD series (Verve): This example is definitive
in standards as interpreted by a singer. You can buy one CD at a time or
the complete 16-CD box set. Find out more about Ella in Chapter 7.

Moving with the Music: Swing,
Syncopation, and Polyrhythms
Swing, syncopation, and polyrhythms are the powers that make jazz move.
Swing is a defining quality of jazz; it’s the music’s relentless forward momen-
tum in the form of loose, driving rhythms. Swing is the mysterious thing that
is essential in jazz and completely lacking in classical music.
Now add in syncopation and polyrhythms and you have the rhythmic ingredi-
ents that give jazz its finger-popping, head-bobbing effect on listeners. Take a
look in this section at how these three qualities — swing, syncopation, and
polyrhythms — come together.

Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 
Spending a few minutes on time signatures
Although you’re not going to learn to read music,
you should know about the notation called the
“time signature” that appears on every piece of
music. The most common time signatures are
2/4, 3/4, and 4/4. The top number tells you how
many beats per measure; the bottom tells you the
value of those beats. So, 2/4 means two quarter
notes per measure; 3/4 means three quarter
notes; and 4/4 indicates four quarter notes. Dave
Brubeck’s “Take Five” is notated with a 5/4 time
signature, with five quarter notes per measure.
Don’t worry too much about the idea of quarter
notes. In the most basic sense, 4/4 simply means
four beats per bar, while 5/4 means five per bar.
In this chapter, I discuss the basic rhythmic unit
of four beats per measure. However, jazz
comes in all sorts of unusual rhythmic group-
ings, or time signatures. Composers such as
Dave Brubeck write music with groupings of 5
beats (“Take Five”), as well as 7, 9, and 11 beats
per measure. Brubeck’s “Blue Rondo a la Turk”
begins with nine beats per measure, with 
different combinations within those nine beats,
then morphs into standard 4/4 time, or four
beats per measure. (I discuss Brubeck’s work
in detail in Chapters 7 and 8.)
As you can see through basic math, time signa-
tures with even numbers are symmetrical, while
odds are asymmetrical. As is true of design, or
human faces, asymmetry adds interest to jazz.
Songs with odd-number sequences like Dave
Brubeck’s “Take Five” requires more effort to
understand, but after you lock into the structure
and the patterns of improvisation, you may be
impressed with how musicians combine intel-
lectual and emotional elements in a song. When
Brubeck alternates four-beat sections with
nine-beat sections, it’s as if you were driving on
a flat desert highway and suddenly began
climbing a twisty mountain road. The change of
scenery is exciting. The more a composer uses
and combines time signatures other than 4/4,
the harder you have to work, but the experience
can be extremely satisfying in the long run.

Swing and syncopation: Messing 
around with the beat
Underlying all jazz (except the fringiest stuff) is the rhythmic momentum
known as swing. Swing is the loose, irresistible forward momentum that pro-
pels the best jazz. A basic idea in jazz that creates swing is changing the
accent on beats in a four-beat measure. The technique of placing accents all
around the beat is known as syncopation (which I cover briefly in Chapter 2).
In a lot of music, ranging from marching to pop hits and children’s songs, the
accents fall on the first and third beats. Tap your foot and sing this song, four
beats per line:
Ring around the rosies
A pocket full of posies
Ashes, ashes
We all fall down
Replay it in your head, and if you’re like most people, you find that your
accents in the first line fell on “Ring” and “ro” — the first and third beats.
Jazz usually emphasizes the second and fourth beats or the backbeats, giving
the music its unique sound. As an example, imagine a gospel choir singing
these lines, four beats per line:
He’s got the whole world
In his hands
He’s got the whole wide world
In his hands
He’s got the whole world
In his hands
He’s got the whole world
In his hands
Most people recognize that the words fall all around the beat, with primary
accents on two and four. In this particular example, “world” and “hands” are
stretched, with each word ending sharply on two and four. A nonswing ver-
sion would have the accents on “He’s” and “whole,” with each word of the
“whole world” line (except “the”) falling on its own beat. According to histori-
ans, the backbeat sense of time is cultural; in America, it was formalized in
African-American churches.
37
Chapter 3: The Scheme of Things: Elements of Jazz Theory

Give the backbeat feel to any song that counts out in fours. Put the accents
on one and three, and then try them on two and four. Notice how the place-
ment of the beat changes the song. Many blues and jazz singers from Jimmy
Rushing to Ella Fitzgerald often stretch words so that their endings fall on
two and four, adding to the syncopated swing.
But that’s only a part of how jazz players think about the beat and where to
place accents. While swing relies partly on the backbeat, jazz players actually
vary their accents all around the beat. Within a solo, it’s common to hear a
horn player put accents in a variety of locations just before a beat, right on
the beat, or just after. Picture each beat with an oval around it. This territory
is all “in bounds” for the beat.

Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 
Receiving a rhythmic education
When you imagine the training it takes to
become a professional musician, you may think
of hours spent learning to read music, playing
scales, and practicing with a metronome to get
the sense of time.
But in fact, depending on the area of expertise,
musicians may focus on certain sections more
heavily:
 A jazz player can spend significant chunks of
practice time just mastering rhythmic combi-
nations. He may play scales over and over,
each time at a different speed, with different
accents and different notes grouped together.
 Music teachers assign exercises in clap-
ping and counting, and students compete to
see who can clap out the most complicated
rhythms. Try it for yourself by seeing how
many different ways you can clap out a pat-
tern over a steady 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4 rhythm
that you tap with your foot.
 Jazz drummers travel with a bagful of
rhythms. At a moment’s notice, they can
produce slow blues patterns, fast bebop
patterns, Latin rhythms (see Chapter 9), and
waltz rhythms. Using their hands, feet,
drums, and cymbals, they overlap two or
more rhythms and become one-man
machines for polyrhythms.
 Drummers and bass players need to be in
step with each other. You often see them
make eye contact during a performance as
they anticipate what’s next. Sometimes they
practice alone together, fooling around with
rhythms, finding ways to complement or
contrast.
If you’re interested in drums and drummers,
seek one of the dozens of books devoted to
modern drumming (such as Burt Korall’s
Drummin’ Men — The Heartbeat of Jazz: The
Bebop Years) and the fine art of syncopation
that is its centerpiece. Visit an online bookstore,
and you can find many drumming instruction
books with syncopation in the titles. Also, many
books by and about drummers include Art
Blakey, Lionel Hampton, and Gene Krupa. In
these books, jazz drummers explain some of
their influences and techniques.

Now imagine a small jazz group of four or five players who are all thinking
about the beat this way. You feel the music swinging because the players
have a good sense of time, but as they collaborate, layers of rhythmic pat-
terns combine to form fascinating groups known as polyrhythms (see the next
section). These rhythmic combinations have become increasingly complex
since early New Orleans jazz, which was built around simpler rhythms
derived from brass bands.
In the music of Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Parker, Art Blakey’s
Jazz Messengers, and other greats, you can easily hear the range of rhythmic
dramas created by musicians just by changing the placement of accents.
Check out the following CDs: Young’s Prez and Teddy (Polygram), with pianist
Teddy Wilson; Hawkins’ Body and Soul (RCA); Parker’s Essential Charlie
Parker (Polygram); and Blakey’s Orgy in Rhythm, Vols. 1 and 2 (Blue Note).
Each CD contains a lot of 12- and 32-bar songs, which embody swing, synco-
pation, and polyrhythms.
Polyrhythms: Tension and release
Musicians use tools including rhythms to carry you along through the song.
When a jazz song begins with four beats per measure and builds texture
through overlapping rhythms, the resulting polyrhythms (the use or an
instance of simultaneous contrasting rhythms) create curiosity, tension, and
excitement. Rhythms can relax you and carry you on an emotional journey,
from curiosity, through tension and awe, to resolution.
When early jazz players began inventing the music, they brought new rhyth-
mic ideas to the western world (see Chapter 2 for more details). Classical
music, while rich in melody and harmony, usually relies on rigid rhythms.
Musicians keep time by playing right on the beat. If you listen to Bach or
Beethoven, you can keep basic time with your foot as various instruments
add their parts in perfect synchronization. In jazz, however, rhythms work
more independently from the rest of the music — moving around the beat,
supporting the musical themes or contrasting with them, pushing or leading
the music to new high points.
A basic subdivision of the beat in performance became a staple of jazz: the
contrasting combination of pairs of beats with trios of beats. You can find
this same contrast in jazz, from improvisations by Louis Armstrong, Coleman
Hawkins, and Charlie Parker, to many types of big band music.
39
Chapter 3: The Scheme of Things: Elements of Jazz Theory

Here’s an easy way to understand what I’m talking about.
1. Tap out a basic beat with your foot.
1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4. Keep it going steady.
2. Clap your hands twice on each beat.
As your foot goes down-up, down-up: clap-clap, clap-clap, clap-clap,
clap-clap.
Another way to subdivide those same basic 1-2-3-4 series would be to clap
your hands three times on each beat. Clap-clap-clap, clap-clap-clap, clap-clap-
clap, clap-clap-clap. This basic polyrhythm adds richness while sustaining
the basic beat.
What you get from jazz depends as much on you as it does on the musicians
and their music. Go through the double and triple exercise again. The first
time, concentrate on the tapping of your foot, and notice how the double and
triple hand claps add variety. On the second time around, concentrate on the
double and triple hand claps, and notice how your foot taps add a new
dimension. With each listening to a piece of jazz, focus on a different aspect
of the music, and different parts come together in a new light.
Space is another important element in the structure of jazz rhythms. Whether
it’s a simple blues or a dense jazz tune with overlapping polyrhythms, places
where there is nothing create anticipation and force listeners to notice what’s
on either side of the space.
In the music of Bill Evans or Miles Davis, the choices they make about where
to put spaces (or breaks in the music) are as important as the ones they
make about where to play notes. Spaces are like musical picture frames that
focus your attention. When Davis surrounds one of his spare phrases with
silence, that phrase stands out like a sculpture in a garden nook.
Space helps create a “tension-and-release” drama. A song and its rhythms
climb to an emotional peak. Right after the peak, leaving a space allows the
emotion to register. It’s like a tense scene in a movie, where one character
has a dramatic line of dialog, and then there’s no dialog as what was said
sinks in.
Music is a subjective, individual experience. What you bring to it effects what
you take from it. To see what I mean, try out a completely different way of lis-
tening. Put on a CD like Davis’s “Kind of Blue” and instead of listening to the
notes, listen for silences. You gain a new appreciation of Davis and other jazz
players as gifted sculptors of sonic clay.

Just Wingin’ It: Methods of Improv
Improvisation occurs when a player or group departs from the written 
music and begins inventing new music. Typically, a performer makes up 
new melodies to fit with a song’s basic structure (see “Playing Bars: Basic
Song Structures” earlier in this chapter for details about song structure).
Improvisation can spotlight an individual or focus on group interaction. Often,
a song alternates between sections of group and individual improvisation.
Players use different ways to improvise, and you can hear more in the music
if you know a little about how musicians think. In the following sections, take
a look at several different elements improvisers can use to make new music
based on the original composition. These elements include chords, harmony,
melody, scales, and call and response.

Chapter 3: The Scheme of Things: Elements of Jazz Theory
Checking out a few rhythm gurus
It takes the entire jazz group to create rhythms.
Great instrumentalists play lines of improvised
melody, and some soloists even imagine the
rhythms of a human voice when they improvise.
Here are two CDs and a video featuring musi-
cians who exemplify rhythmic mastery:
 “Moanin’” (Blue Note) by Art Blakey and 
the Jazz Messengers: Rhythmically, this 
1958 album contains rich, exotic combina-
tions, especially on “The Drum Thunder
(Miniature) Suite.” This piece includes sev-
eral solo breaks by drummer and bandleader
Blakey. Unlike earlier drummers who used
their bass drums almost as metronomes,
Blakey uses his for accents. With combina-
tions of drums and cymbals, he plays pat-
terns ahead of the beat, on it, and behind it
(on the backbeat). Blakey even taps on his
set’s metal hardware. He adds clusters of
two beats over groups of three to create
contrast and tension, and in one section, he
even uses his drums to emulate the drum
section of a marching band. When you listen
to the CD, note how he also makes effective
use of space to add drama.
 “Drums of Passion” (Sony) by Babatunde
Olatunji: This album, released in 1959, was
among the first African music recorded in a
modern studio, and the CD offers a high-
fidelity collection of jazz’s root rhythms. The
drumming of Olatunji and his bandmates
sustains powerful, driving beats but also
illustrates all sorts of syncopation as well as
endless layers of polyrhythms.
 “A Different Drummer” (Rhapsody Films) by
Elvin Jones: This documentary about the
great drummer, Elvin Jones, (best known as a
member of John Coltrane’s band) shows him
in action with explanations of how he builds
a solo on a basic beat. Watch in amazement
as Jones — a devotee of African rhythms —
adds layer after layer of rhythm until he’s
baked a rich polyrhythmic pie.

Finding inspiration in melodies
A series of single notes makes up a melody. Most people refer to the melody
as the tune of the song. Even without knowing much about theory, a musician
can begin improvising around a simple melody. This approach is something
you can try by using your voice.
Think of a favorite song that you know well. Sing through the first verse, then
start making up a new melody. You can use the original words if you want or
invent nonsense scat-singing sounds to go with your melody (Chapter 6 has
more info about scat singing). If you concentrate on the mood of the song
and its melody, you might be surprised at what you come up with.
All of us can create reasonably cool melodies that sound similar to other
melodies. But few of us could come close the beautiful, complex solos
invented by jazz’s improvisers. That’s because their knowledge of chords,
harmonies, and scales gives them an array of hundreds of options, and they
know those options so well that they select from them by instinct to create
beautiful new music on the spot.
Chords, harmonies, and scales are really just elements of a system that dic-
tates how notes fit together. Here’s a simple explanation of those elements:
 Chords: Chords combine three or more notes together harmoniously.
Pianists and guitarists are the only jazz musicians who can play chords.
Some arrangements call for several instruments to play the notes of a
chord together.
 Scales: Scales are series of notes differing in pitch according to a certain
scheme. A scale consists of eight notes, stepping up from the starting
note to the ending note an octave higher. Each jazz song has its own
chords, and the chords determine which key it’s in. Each key has its own
scale. A jazz musician knows scales in many keys, so when it comes time
to solo, he uses scales that fit the chords.
 Harmony: Harmony is sound of several notes together — such as chords
or combinations of notes played by band members. On a basic level, a
jazz soloist uses the right scale, or series of notes, to fit with a chord.
Harmony could be as simple as one note from a guitar combined with a
different note from a bass. Or it could be as complicated as a jazz big
band, where a pianist plays chords with his left hand and melodies with
his right, while other instruments each play a part of a chord, and some
of the players carry the melody and create solos.
42
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 

Early jazz musicians knew their basics, and they used melodies as their source
of inspiration for improvising. Listen to 1920s Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet,
or Jelly Roll Morton (see Chapter 5 for more about these guys), and you can
hear traces of the melody throughout their improvisations.
Go back to the early days of jazz improvisation, but keep in mind that on
record, the following musicians were limited to three minutes per song and
that their early improvisations were mild by today’s standards.
 Louis Armstrong, West End Blues (EPM Musique)
 Sidney Bechet, The Sidney Bechet Story, box set (Proper)
 Jelly Roll Morton, Birth of the Hot (RCA)
Improvising by reinterpreting the melody sounds simple enough, but when
you consider the number of tunes a working jazz musician must know, you
can see why this craft takes years and years to master. I once interviewed a
cocktail lounge pianist who knew hundreds, maybe even thousands, of jazz
songs. You could name most any well-known tune, and he could play it, com-
plete with chords, melody, and his own interpretations and improvisations.
Think of jazz as a new language with a huge vocabulary, rules of grammar and
punctuation, and dictionaries full of slang. A jazz player’s goal is to learn
techniques and tunes so well that playing them comes as spontaneously as
talking with a friend. Even though much jazz is improvised, musicians must
know a lot of theory and songs before they become masterful improvisers.
Melodies are only part of this knowledge.
Experimenting with chords
Songs move through chord changes. By learning all of a tune’s chords —
sometimes several per measure — a soloist can improvise something 
that sounds good even without knowing the melody (see the previous 
section for more on melodies and chords).
Basic chords are composed of three notes. For instance, on a piano, a C
chord consists of the notes C, E, and G (the first, third, and fifth notes in the
C scale, designated as I, III, V). Early jazz musicians used notes from a song’s
chords to invent their own melodies. For example, a musician playing a song
that begins with a C chord and continues through several more chords could
use the notes in a C scale to improvise over that chord and different scales 
to fit with other chords. A C scale consists of eight notes to choose from to
invent a new line of melody to go with the chord.
43
Chapter 3: The Scheme of Things: Elements of Jazz Theory

As jazz became more technical in the bebop era (covered in Chapter 7),
songs used chords consisting of four or five notes, and players improvised
using notes from scales that fit those chords. Because bebop is so fast and
uses many chords, soloists needed to have dozens of scales memorized so
that they could recall them and use them instantly.
Players also invert chords. To invert a chord means to play the basic notes of
that chord in a different order. For instance, the C chord can be played with
the C note as its lowest root note, or it can be rearranged with C somewhere
else in the chord’s structure, such as choosing to play a C that is higher than
the E and G that round out the chord, instead of lower.
Eventually, instead of using the stock chords for a familiar tune, jazz gui-
tarists and pianists (who play the chords) use other chords that fit but sound
different. They also add extra chords between a piece’s primary chords.
Thus, guitarists and pianists may play some chords that aren’t part of the
original composition, while maintaining the piece’s basic chords.
Beboppers such as Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker were famous among
their peers for replacing the written chords with other surprising chords that
gave old songs a new twist. In the 1950s and ’60s, pianists and guitarists
invented exotic chord substitutions and sequences, and horn players used
these chords as a launching pad for new improvisational flights. In the ’60s,
John Coltrane and others pushed the approach even farther, using a different
chord on each beat as the basis for a solo.
Scaling the heights of jazz
Scales are ascending or descending series of notes and fit with a song’s
chords. Scales range from the major, minor, and pentatonic (five tones used
mostly in blues), to Lydian, Phrygian, and other exotic-sounding scales from
around the world. The pentatonic scale is a basic building block of jazz and
blues. On a piano, the scale ascends C, D, E, G, A.
By copying Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music, you can sing a standard
eight-note major scale. Try it: Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do. Standard scales are
constructed from the notes on a piano. Starting with middle C, one octave on
a piano keyboard ascends like this: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, B, C (# stands
for a sharp note). Those notes can be combined into all sorts of scale. Jazz
musicians also experiment with notes in between those standard notes, as
when guitarists bend a string, or trumpeters bend notes using a combination
of air and mouth position.
44
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 

Through the ’30s and into the ’40s, most jazz players didn’t think about
scales, only melodies and chords. Many players developed their own sound
simply by creating signature patterns, or riffs, that they could use in their
solos. Sometimes at peak moments, they repeated these riffs over and over
with variations, creating waves and waves of musical energy.
But Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker (see Chapter 7 for more about them)
pushed the music into the expansive territory of scales, as they improvised
longer and more complex lines that required more choices than a song’s
chords could offer. A chord may consist of three or four notes, and a scale
that fits with it has eight. Sometimes an experienced soloist uses notes out-
side that chord to surprise you or create a special sound or mood.
Guitars and wind instruments also give their players the potential to bend
notes, finding tones a few hairs away from the standard notes on a piano (the
notes of the western chromatic scale). A guitarist pushes a string against 
the neck and slides it a tiny bit sideways to a tone that’s not part of a regular
scale. Or a saxophonist uses his lips and breath to coax in-between tones from
his horn. Although performers don’t like labels, the word microtonalists — a
category for musicians who find all those notes between the notes of a stan-
dard scale — describes musicians such as Albert Ayler, Ornette Coleman,
John Coltrane, and Archie Shepp.
Clarinetist Joe Maneri grew up listening to Arnold Schoenberg, the modernist
composer who, along with Austrian peers Alban Berg and Anton Webern,
experimented with microtones early in the 20th century — more than 50
years before microtones appeared in jazz. In the ’50s, Maneri studied music
theory with Joseph Schmid, a student of Berg’s, and went on to create his
own system that divides an octave into 72 tones. Clarinetists and saxophon-
ists use alternative fingerings to reach those notes, and Maneri even invented
an electronic keyboard based on his system. Today, Maneri and his son Mat
have recorded several CDs of their music, and they remain leading propo-
nents of microtones and avid members of the Boston Microtonal Society
(www.bostonmicrotonalsociety.org).
Maneri’s In Full Cry (ECM) gives you a sampling of how he pushed beyond the
normal bounds of jazz by using microtones.
Conversing with call and response
In previous sections, I describe improvisations as individual players’ invent-
ing new music. But although jazz’s best-known players get much of the atten-
tion, it’s the collaborative effort of the group that makes the music possible.
Whether you’re listening to Louis Armstrong’s Hot Fives and Hot Sevens
recordings, Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker’s ’40s bebop, John Coltrane’s
signature albums from the ’60s, or the Art Ensemble of Chicago’s freeform
’70s music, the collective effort is key.
45
Chapter 3: The Scheme of Things: Elements of Jazz Theory

On one level, the sound dates back to the call-and-response of African chants
and of early African-American music and church services, where one person
delivers a line and another (or a group) responds. You can even hear this
dynamic in Rev. Martin Luther King’s famous “I have a dream . . .” speech,
where he pauses to let the audience participate with manners of affirmations.
Whether in sermons, gospel music, or jazz, this back and forth, or call and
response, adds a conversational element. In good jazz, improvisation is a
dialog among several players, and the dialogue can go on for minutes or
hours.
Given jazz’s improvisational nature, songs expand or contract within a partic-
ular structure to fit the situation. For example, with the limited time of a
radio, recording, or television performance, a jazz group may perform a tight
(shortened) version of a composition without room for the call and response.
In a live setting, though, especially if the crowd is enthusiastic and the band
is up for it, the chorus can be repeated any number of times to support
rounds of improvisation.
46
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 
The rise of modal jazz
In the ’60s, John Coltrane began to use modal
jazz to give him more latitude for improvisation.
The term modal jazz is hard to define but easier
to hear. Modal jazz often relies upon scales, or
series of notes, that sound exotic. You may detect
flavors from African, Arabic, Asian, Balinese, fla-
menco, and other music in modal jazz.
In addition to the use of scales with names like
aeolian, dorian, lydian, and phrygian, modal jazz
is distinguished by slower and fewer chord
changes. If you listen to Coltrane’s recordings
from the ’60s, you can hear how many of his
solos build on one or two root notes, instead of
the rapidly changing chords of a Charlie Parker
tune. Often these repeated root notes, also
referred to as drones, are played by bass and
piano. Coltrane chose to improvise with over
chords and drone notes.
For a primer on the sound of modal jazz, these
recordings are a good starting point. Check out
Chapter 8 for more about John Coltrane and his
take on modal jazz.

wing is the pulse of all great jazz. It’s that loose-but-relentless forward
momentum, rooted in rhythm sections of basses, drums, pianos, and
guitars but carried by all the players. A jazz band, no matter the type of jazz
or the size of the band, has the versatility of a classical ensemble and the
range of an orchestra. In this chapter, you can check out the instruments that
make all types of jazz music swing.
Blow Out: Brass and Reeds
Jazz’s wind instruments include the clarinet, cornet, flute, saxophone, trom-
bone, and trumpet. They’re jazz’s stars because they play most of the melodies
and solos. In range, smoothness, and reliance on air to create sound, wind
instruments are like the human voice — which maybe one reason for their
tremendous appeal. I cover these instruments in the following sections.
Feeling saxy: Jazz’s signature sound
In the history of jazz, no other instrument has had the impact of the saxo-
phone. If I had to guess why, I would say it’s because the saxophone has a
sound most equivalent to the human voice. Both can be soft and sensitive or
extremely assertive and cover most any emotion. The saxophone can slide
between notes with a grace not possible on most other jazz instruments.

Saxophones were invented decades before jazz, and were familiar instru-
ments by the time of jazz’s birth. Musicians around the world had played all
shapes and sizes of horns for centuries but nothing quite like the saxophone.
From Coleman Hawkins and Lester Young, to Charlie Parker, John Coltrane,
and Ornette Coleman, most of jazz’s innovators have been saxophonists.
When I talk about saxophonists, I’m actually referring to musicians who play
various types of saxophones:
 Alto sax (Charlie Parker)
 Baritone sax (Gerry Mulligan)
 Soprano sax (John Coltrane)
 Tenor sax (Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, John Coltrane)
These horns showed up in jazz beginning in the late 1920s. With their expres-
sive range, saxophones soon became sexy darlings of jazz, stars of jam ses-
sion battles that lasted for hours. Soaring above piano, bass, and drums,
saxophonists played a lead role in small groups, many of which spun off from
big bands during the late 1930s. Saxophones also took a lead in ’60s and ’70s
avant garde jazz and in ’70s and ’80s electric jazz — some players amplified
traditional saxophones, while others experimented with a new invention
known as the electronic wind instrument (EWI).
In the following sections, I discuss the creation of the saxophone and show
you the different kinds of saxophones used in jazz.
Inventing the saxophone
So where did the saxophone come from? Good question! Adolphe Sax was the
Belgian son of a father who made musical instruments. Sax was a musician
and instrument maker who became dissatisfied with available horns, so he
designed a reliable replacement with a sound that combined the qualities of
brass, strings, and woodwinds. Sax patented the saxophone in 1846 and even-
tually designed 14 different varieties. His first design was a C bass saxophone,
which impressed composers including Hector Berlioz, who began writing
music for the new instrument.
Initially, the saxophone was scorned by old schoolers who played other wind
instruments including clarinets. But when Adolphe Sax won a battle of wind
instruments with his new invention, composers and musicians began warm-
ing up to his durable, versatile, appealing invention.
Surveying different types of saxophones
Of the many saxophones designed by Adolphe Sax, several became main-
stays of jazz: soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone. These saxophones have six
keys and use similar fingerings. A master of one type can generally play the
others.

(when you typically think of a saxophone). All are brass and have the
classic curved shape and upturned flared bell.
• Alto (see Figure 4-2) is smallest of these three. It has an edge like

• The tenor (see Figure 4-3) is mid-size and has an extra curve where
the body meets the mouthpiece. It occupies the warm middle zone
of sound.
• Baritone saxes (see Figure 4-4) have an extra loop where the body
meets the mouthpiece. It covers the bottom end of the sound
range.

Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 

Early C-melody saxophones (a higher-pitched cousin of Adophe Sax’s C-bass
saxophone), favored by players such as Jack Pettis and Frankie Trumbauer,
had a range between alto and tenor. No one uses them today (a possible
opportunity for a young player to create a “new” sound).
Most saxophone mouthpieces are made of hard rubber (a few players prefer
metal), and are similar to a clarinet’s mouthpiece. There’s a small clamp for
attaching a reed, which vibrates with the player’s breath. Saxophonists can
be particular about their mouthpieces and reeds, searching for the perfect
combination, treasuring it like expensive jewelry after they find it.
Brassy cousins: Cornets and trumpets
Cornets and trumpets are cousins with similar but distinctive sounds; both
have ancient roots that reach back to horns in ancient Egypt. In the Middle
Ages, there were horns of tubing bent like trumpets, only much longer.
Over the years, various bends made horns more compact, without compro-
mising their sound. In the early 1800s, various valved cornets and trumpets
appeared, and in the 1840s Adolphe Sax (see “Inventing the saxophone” ear-
lier in this chapter to find out more about him) introduced a line of valved
bugles (or “saxhorns”). The modern cornet, with valves in the middle, was
first manufactured by Antoine Courtois in 1855.
Trumpets developed on a parallel track. Joseph Haydn and other composers
wrote parts for keyed trumpets. The piston-valve trumpet was invented by
Francois Perinet in 1839.
Trumpets and cornets both use similar tubing but differ in their proportions
of cylindrical and conical bores. The trumpet has less cylindrical tubing; its
tubing stays the same size from mouthpiece to bell. The cornet’s conical
tubing tapers more dramatically than the trumpet’s; it widens continually
from the mouthpiece to the bell. This is said to give the cornet a smoother,
mellower sound. The trumpet’s sound is brighter and more commanding.
The cornet fit well with early New Orleans bands, where it was among color-
ful brass sections that grew out of marching bands and was used by players
including Buddy Bolden and Louis Armstrong (see Chapter 5). Although the
sound of cornet became synonymous with Armstrong and Bix Beiderbecke,
this horn fell out of favor for years until it was picked up again by Dixieland
revival players in the 1940s and 1950s. A few modern musicians have also
played cornet, among them Nat Adderley and Warren Vache. Trumpeters like
Buddy Bolden and Louis Armstrong (see Chapter 5 for more about them)
actually played the trumpetlike cornet in the early years of jazz, although
Armstrong eventually switched to trumpet.
51
Chapter 4: Tools of the Trade: The Instruments of Jazz

The trumpet is better suited to its lead role in modern jazz. As Armstrong
switched from cornet to trumpet, the trumpet’s powerful sound fit his pio-
neering solos and distinct tone. Subsequent trumpeters — Chet Baker,
Clifford Brown, Miles Davis, and Dizzy Gillespie — exploited the trumpet’s
range of sounds, from loud and piercing to soft, muted, and whispery.
Sliding sounds: Trombones
Early jazz trombonists were called tailgaters because they hung their slides
out from the backs of horse-drawn wagons that carried jazz bands through
the streets of New Orleans.
Certain elements characterize the playing of the early New Orleans tailgaters.
These sounds really defined the role that trombone was to play and contin-
ues to play in the jazz ensemble. In New Orleans, trombones played the bass
parts later performed by bass guitarists. In big bands, trombones helped
anchor the bottom beat, and they harmonized with trumpets and saxo-
phones in brass sections. Trombones can also do some of the things a human
voice can do.
Here are some of the things to listen for when you listen to jazz trombone:
 Glissando: Also called a smooth slide because the instrument slides
through a string of notes that sounds, at times, like an elephant braying.
This technique is what most people recognize as “that trombone
sound.” (The term is Italian, as are many musical terms — purists may
refer to more than one glissando as glissandi.)
52
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 
Getting a fuller sound with the flugelhorn
In recent decades the flugelhorn — a slightly
larger variation of a trumpet with a fuller,
warmer tone — has been showcased by Art
Farmer, Freddie Hubbard, and Clark Terry. The
flugelhorn is well suited for ballads.
 Miles Davis used a flugelhorn for the mini-
malist cool sound on his 1957 album Miles
Ahead.
 Trumpeter and bandleader Shorty Rogers
played flugelhorn in 1950s cool jazz.
 Freddie Hubbard’s big, sweet sound flugel-
horn became a centerpiece of romantic ’70s
soul-jazz.
 South-African trumpeter Hugh Masekela
uses flugelhorn on albums such as Almost
Like Being in Jazz that combine African
rhythms and textures with contemporary
American jazz.
 Tom Harrell, a top trumpeter in the midst of
his career, uses trumpets and flugelhorns,
depending on the song.

 Vibrato: A wavering sound often kept up through the entire length of a
note or phrase, adding dynamic detail. The term literally means “with
vibration,” and after you recognize vibrato, you understand why. Vibrato
is also a common technique used by vocalists.
 Playing on the beat: Trombone lends itself well to playing below other
horns, so it often assumes a rhythmic role of pumping out the bass beat.
 Wah-wah sounds: The phrase may sound a little weird, but the trom-
bones mimic this sound with mutes and plungers placed over or inside
the horn’s bell. Mutes were especially popular with early New Orleans
and subsequent swing-era.
Although slide trombone is the familiar jazz icon, the valve trombone is
another species used in jazz.
All brass instruments are similar in that a player creates different pitches by
varying the vibration of his lips, the opening of his mouth, and the volume of
air. Pitch also changes when the length traveled by air changes. The slide on
a slide trombone changes this distance, while the valves on a valve trombone
or trumpet accomplish the task.
While trombonists are usually lumped together, some of jazz’s most innova-
tive players used valve trombones, including “Tricky” Sam Nanton (who
made his trombone “talk” like a human voice in Duke Ellington’s orchestra)
and Bob Brookmeyer (who played with West Coast cool jazzmen Gerry
Mulligan and Jimmy Giuffre). Brookmeyer is one of the few valve trombonists
to record his own albums as a leader.
Starring in the swing era: Clarinets
When you think of the swing era (which I cover in Chapter 6), the first images
that come to mind are probably famous bandleaders, mysterious saxophon-
ists, and stylish singers. But for a few years during the heyday of big bands,
clarinets were the stars.
Early jazz didn’t feature long solos, but in terms of carrying melodies and
standing out in a crowd, clarinets kept a high profile. New Orleans clarinetists
led by Johnny Dodds and Jimmie Noone were among the most important fig-
ures in early jazz. Although they weren’t bandleaders or prolific composers,
the clarinetists pioneered the idea of the gifted soloist for whom a band’s
music might be custom tailored. In more recent years, players such as Buddy
DeFranco and Eddie Daniels took the clarinet to frontline status.
Harry Carney, Benny Goodman, Omer Simeon, and Artie Shaw were some of
the most talented clarinetists of ’20s and ’30s. Goodman and Shaw are
remembered as big-band leaders but were epic instrumentalists.
53
Chapter 4: Tools of the Trade: The Instruments of Jazz

Leaders like Goodman and Shaw used clarinets for their strong and distinc-
tive sound that pierced through layers of big band arrangements. The instru-
ments have the capacity for mesmerizing melodies that, even in jazz, can
sound like mythological snake-charming music. They’re light, compact, and
easy to wave flamboyantly — a bonus for leaders like Goodman and Shaw.
Clarinets resemble oboes and soprano saxophones (which I cover earlier in
this chapter), but clarinets are distinct in both construction and tone. Oboes
and clarinets are made of hardwood, usually Grenadillo, while saxophones
are brass. Oboes have a small double reed that lends a sharper, more exotic
sound. Clarinets have a saxophonelike reed that requires more respiratory
strength but yields a bigger tone. (Oboes have rarely been heard in jazz; sax-
ophonist Don Redman used one occasionally with the Fletcher Henderson
Orchestra during the 1920s, and woodwind player Yusef Lateef has occasion-
ally added oboe to his arsenal of saxophone and flute.)
The alto clarinet (see Figure 4-5) has a wide range and big tone that makes it
well suited for jazz, but it’s perhaps the most difficult to master among wood-
wind instruments. Fingerings on the alto clarinet are more complicated than
on saxophones or oboes.
Jazz musicians also play bass clarinet — a larger more cumbersome instru-
ment with a fuller, deeper tone (see Figure 4-6). Bass clarinets are rare but
became popular in free jazz and fusion during the ’70s (see Chapter 8).
Among those boosting the modern clarinet boom were Hamiett Bluiett,
Gunter Hampel, Bennie Maupin, Roscoe Mitchell, and David Murray.
Bennie Maupin adds dark, foreboding sounds on Miles Davis’s revolutionary
1969 album Bitches Brew (Sony). Deep down in the bottom end, his horn here
sounds almost like a Gregorian chant. If you listen closely to this recording,
you hear how Maupin’s playing helps shape the music. On his 1998 solo
album Driving While Black (Intuition), Maupin adds electronic effects to make
mesmerizing, contemporary jazz.

On the edge of jazz: Flutes
Flutes are close relatives of saxophones (covered earlier in this chapter),
although they don’t have reeds. Generally, the flute — a long, straight metal
tube with keys similar to a saxophone’s — has been a fringe instrument in
jazz, played seriously by only a handful of musicians. Its role in jazz music is
primarily to add harmonies and colors to small group and big band music,
but players such as Eric Dolphy, Yusef Lateef, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, and
James Moody have done beautiful improvisations.
The flute’s ethereal sound is one of the most distinctive in jazz. A mouthpiece
unlike that of any other wind instrument lets a flutist blend chanting, hum-
ming, and other vocal sounds into her flute playing and to make shrills, dis-
torted shrieks, and cries utilizing a technique called overblowing. When noted
jazz flutist James Newton plays, the transition between his humming, singing,
breathing, and flute playing is so seamless it all sounds like one magical
instrument.
The basic design of a flute with its long tube with finger holes and air hole
hasn’t changed in thousands of years. Ancient Chinese drawings show flutes.
But the breakthrough for modern flutists came in 1850 when Theobald
Boehm redesigned the instrument with larger holes that produced a bigger
sound. The holes were too large to be covered with fingertips, so Boehm
added keys that controlled padded hole covers.

Chapter 4: Tools of the Trade: The Instruments of Jazz

Finding a concentrated sample of great jazz flute music is difficult. Probably
half of jazz’s top flutists play other wind instruments, including saxophones,
and these players seldom make recordings that focus solely on the flute.
More commonly, these doublers include a flute tune or two on their albums.
Only a handful of flutists have made recordings devoted to the flute: Herbie
Mann, Frank Wess, Hubert Laws, Holly Hofmann, Rahsaan Roland Kirk,
Charles Lloyd, Sam Most, Jeremy Steig, Buddy Collette, Lloyd McNeil, and
James Newton. For details on an early doubler, see the nearby sidebar
“Albert Socarras: The first jazz flutist on record.”
In recent decades, flutists like Eric Dolphy, Joe Farrell, Rahsaan Roland Kirk,
James Moody, Yusef Lateef, Hubert Laws, James Newton, and Frank Wess have
brought the instrument front and center with their sublime performances.
For intimate headphone listening that can be as calming as a good meditation,
try these albums that feature the flute:
 Does Your House Have Lions (Rhino): In this retrospective of music
from 1961 to 1976, Rahsaan Roland Kirk moves easily from flute to saxo-
phone and exotic wind instruments such as the mandello and stritch as
he runs a range of jazz influences from New Orleans to bebop. He also
displays his talent for playing two or three saxophones at once.
 Echo Canyon (Celestial Harmonies): James Newton gets inspiration
from Southwestern landscapes and painter Georgia O’Keeffe to evoke
the mystical moods of red canyons, deserts, and mesas.
 Live at Pep’s (Impulse): Yusef Lateef plays flute, as well as bamboo flute
and saxophone, on this powerful live recording in 1964.
56
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 
Albert Socarras: The first jazz flutist on record
Albert Socarras was first to record the jazz flute.
Like other jazz flutists, Socarras was a doubler—
he played saxophone and clarinet. Socarras
played flute on several songs recorded by
Clarence Williams’s big band in 1929, and his solo
on “Have You Ever Felt That Way” included on
Clarence Williams 1929 (Classics) is the earliest
example of flute improvisation I’ve found.
“Have You Ever Felt That Way” is an upbeat
number led by Williams’ piano and “de-de-de-
doo” vocals. After cornetist Ed Allen’s raunchy
solo, Socarras comes trilling in, delivers an
inventive solo, and pauses as Williams calls out,
“Everybody in the cycle now; everybody in the
cycle” and then takes his piano break. Socarras
returns for another burst of invention. Although
his moment lasts only 30 seconds or so, it’s
enough to show that he was a capable impro-
viser as creative as horn players, pianists, and
vocalists — the common leading sounds of his
day. Socarras pointed the way toward jazz’s
great flute virtuosos who didn’t come along until
the 1950s.

Strumming Along: Strings
In early jazz, tubas usually took the low parts, but by the swing era, most
bands had bassists on different instruments, and by the late 1930s, when
small groups began outnumbering big bands, bass players were pretty 
standard.
The bassist’s role evolved as jazz matured. It began as the steady thumping
power source of a band but eventually provide harmonies and melodies.
Building the foundation: The standup bass
The bass is one of the oldest instruments used in jazz, dating back through
centuries of classical music. It’s the only classical string instrument to
become a fixture in jazz (although there have been a few violins). The bass
allows for a more percussive attack with a broader range of sounds better
suited to versatile jazz ensembles. Originally named contrabass, because its
range is lower than the bass range of other instruments including the piano,
it’s more commonly referred to as “standup” or “upright” bass. Standup?
Upright? Sounds like a truly honest instrument.
Unlike a guitar (which I cover later in this chapter), a bass is fretless, which
means a bassist can slide to positions that deliver all sorts of notes in
between the notes of familiar scales. It also means that bassists can easily
produce glissandos like trombones (covered earlier in this chapter) by slid-
ing a finger along a string through a seamless series of notes.
Basses haven’t changed much since the time of Bach and Beethoven. They
have four strings (although big band bassist Chubby Jackson used a custom
five-stringer with Woody Herman’s Thundering Herd during the 1940s). They
are still made of wood, with slots called f-holes cut into the top (or sounding
board) to disperse sound. Historically, jazz bassists usually plucked the
strings (pizzicato) to deliver a thumping groove, but they employ bows 
(arco style) for all sorts of sliding sounds and sustained notes.
The bass is commonly perceived as a partner of drums in a jazz band’s
rhythm section, but bassists and drummers really play independent and 
complementary parts. Together, they ensure that the music’s steady pulse is
felt, sometimes by implication (that is, carefully placed silences or off-beat
accents) as much as emphasis. One instrument keeps the basic beat while
the other embroiders it. Other times, both musicians move all around the
beat. In the rhythm section, a bassist and a drummer form the nucleus of the
music, the solid rhythmic core around which other players build layers of
improvisation. (I discuss drums in more detail later in this chapter.)
57
Chapter 4: Tools of the Trade: The Instruments of Jazz

Basses succeed in starring roles in the hands of versatile bassists beginning
with Jimmy Blanton in the ’40s. A bass can beautifully carry a melody (espe-
cially when played with a bow — a technique known as arco) or ring out
improvisations in its resonant, deep voice.
As Louis Armstrong and innovative soloists such as swing-era saxophonists
Lester Young and Coleman Hawkins, bebop saxophonist Charlie Parker, and
multi-style trumpeter Miles Davis explored new roles for their instruments,
bassists advanced their art too. Jimmy Blanton, Charles Mingus, Ray Brown,
Scott LaFaro, and Charlie Haden vastly extended the bass’ emotional range.
Connecting with current: The electric bass
In jazz, bassists initially fought a battle to be heard in bands powered by bold
brass. Going back to the advent of recordings and microphones in the ’20s,
bassists experiment with amplifying their instruments. Today, standup
bassists who need extra volume for clubs and concert halls use a pickup —
an electronic microphonelike accessory that clips onto their instrument and
picks up the vibrations.
During the ’60s, electric rock-and-roll with jazzy flavors caught the attention
of many jazz players. Bassists, led by Monk Montgomery, added electric bass
guitar to their arsenal during the ’50s. In the ’70s, Ron Carter brought an
extensive knowledge of the acoustic bassman’s craft to his work on electric
bass, sometimes using a smaller, higher-pitched standup piccolo bass.
Electric basses also give modern big band musicians enough power to be
heard without playing too hard. And in the late ’60s and early ’70s, when
Miles Davis and others turned to electric jazz, the electric bass joined other
electric instruments in the music known as fusion (see Chapter 8 for details).
Electric basses have the added benefit of portability, which made them
extremely popular with working and traveling bassists.
Some electric bassists favor instruments with five or six strings, instead of
the standard four, which gives a broader range. Others such as Jaco
Pastorius (of Weather Report) favored fretless electric basses that produced
swooping, sliding sounds.
Picking it up: Guitars
Playing the guitar is an act that marries the instrument’s rhythmic and
melodic sides. A thumb can pluck bass lines while fingers play chords and
melodies, as the guitarist pushes down combinations of strings at various
frets (strips of steel across a guitar’s neck). And when a guitarist strums
chords to emphasize the beat, he becomes a part of the rhythm section,
which also includes bass, drums, and sometimes piano.
58
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 

The guitar’s role changed substantially since it first showed up in New
Orleans jazz bands. As jazz groups grew larger during the late 1920s, gui-
tarists couldn’t play loud enough to be heard. That problem was solved with
the electric guitar (covered later in this section), and since then several gen-
erations of jazz guitarists have expanded their instrument’s repertoire.
In the following sections, I describe the guitar’s early years in jazz and how
musicians electrified it in later decades.
The guitar versus the banjo
Around New Orleans, where jazz was born, guitar and its banjo cousin had
been popular for years. String trios with a guitar or banjo — and with man-
dolin and bass — played often in African-American and Creole neighborhoods.
Between 1895, when Buddy Bolden formed his band, and the ’20s, when jazz
proliferated and the earliest jazz recordings were made, the guitar’s role was
minimalized. Yet Bolden’s lineup in 1905 included the guitar. (See Chapter 5
for more about Bolden and other early jazz musicians.)
Early guitar players often doubled on banjo because it’s louder and can be
heard in settings that drown out acoustic guitar. Johnny St. Cyr favored his
banjo over a guitar on recordings he made with Louis Armstrong and Jelly
Roll Morton. Musicians who concentrated on banjo in early jazz bands
included Bill Johnson (with King Oliver), Papa Charlie Jackson, and Harry
Reser. Even Fletcher Henderson’s Orchestra, a ’20s prototype for classic ’30s
and ’40s big bands, often included a banjo in the guitar’s eventual slot.
Whether jazz’s earliest fretmen selected a banjo or a guitar, their role was
predominantly rhythmic. They rarely carried a melody or soloed. They
helped bassists, pianists, and drummers keep the pace by strumming the
chords.
By the mid-’20s, when early jazz recordings were made by Louis Armstrong,
Sidney Bechet, and King Oliver, newer, louder guitars boosted the instrument’s
profile. By 1927, St. Cyr had swapped his banjo for a guitar, and as jazz rose to
popularity via records and radio, guitarists completely replaced banjo players.
Eddie Lang and Lonnie Johnson were jazz’s earliest guitar virtuosos — rhythm
section players but also improvisers who soloed alongside trumpeters and
saxophonists.
Electrifying the guitar
Guitar fanatics experimented with ways to electrify guitars during the early
1930s. Pioneering guitar inventor Les Paul even jammed a phonograph needle
into the top of his acoustic guitar and got a primitive electric sound. (See
Chapter 17 for more information about Paul.)
59
Chapter 4: Tools of the Trade: The Instruments of Jazz

In 1935, guitarist Eddie Durham played what may have been the earliest
amplified jazz guitar solo. Durham carved out the top of his acoustic guitar
and inserted a pie-pan-like resonator under the strings to brighten and reflect
the sound back toward the audience. On the song “Hitting the Bottle” with
Jimmie Lunceford’s big band, Durham soloed as Lunceford held a micro-
phone up to his guitar, to get a new, amplified sound.
Catch Durham in the late 1930s on Lester Young — The Kansas City Sessions
(Verve), playing inventive solos that point the way toward Charlie Christian,
who reinvented the art of jazz guitar (see Chapter 6 for more about him).
This album is great not only for Durham, but also because it includes some
excellent playing by Young and other greats.
When the earliest electric guitars came out during the late ’30s, a few savvy
jazz guitarists quickly saw their potential. St. Louis-born Floyd Smith, a
member of Andy Kirk’s orchestra, was among the first to plug in. He played
an electric guitar developed primarily for Hawaiian music, and his efforts can
be heard on Kirk’s recordings from the late ’30s. Rickenbacker produced
early electric guitars (including the famous solid-body “frying pan” guitar),
but none found widespread use in jazz. Smith’s newfound electric sound is
apparent on “Floyd’s Guitar Blues,” on the album Andy Kirk/Introduction: His
Best Recordings 1929–1946 (Best of Jazz).
At Gibson, Lloyd Loar, a factor technician, began developing electric pickups
during the early ’20s. He later left the company, but in 1935, Gibson intro-
duced its ES 150 hollow-body electric guitar, and the juice flowed straight
into jazz after guitarist Charlie Christian bought one in 1937 and won a spot
in Benny Goodman’s band. Later electric jazz guitars played by Barney Kessel
and others weren’t all that different from Christian’s, although craftsmanship,
pickups, and hardware went through many refinements.
Plugged in, guitarists played several roles: rhythmic, melodic, and impro-
visational. But they weren’t as common in small modern jazz groups as 
piano. When an electric jazz guitarist strums a chord, it sustains for several

Going beyond six strings
A standard jazz guitar has six strings, but guitarists
including Bucky Pizzarelli, his son John, Howard
Alden, and George Van Eps deployed seven-
stringers that extended the instrument’s range.
Other guitarists, such as San Francisco-Bay Area
phenom Charlie Hunter, have developed exotic
custom instruments. Hunter’s guitar combines five
strings in the guitar’s standard range with three
fatter bass strings. This setup allows him to play
bass lines, chords, and melodies simultaneously.
Close your eyes, and sometimes you may think
you’re hearing a trio.

seconds, filling the space behind a melody or solo. A guitarist can play each
chord in several positions on the neck, so he can place it in the low, middle,
or upper range of the musical spectrum. He can play chords using anywhere
from two to six strings, depending on how much texture or sound he needs.
He can also play a melody or counter-melody along with a saxophonist, trum-
peter, or singer, which adds another musical dimension.
Some of my favorite jazz guitar music comes from small groups where the
guitarist is the featured player, filling many roles at once, and especially on
solo albums, where the instrument’s full potential is realized. Here are a few
albums for serious guitar-heads (like me):
 Barney Kessel: Solo (Concord): Kessel was a great rhythm guitarist and
a phenomenal improviser. On this recording, his multi-talents come
together without any other instruments in the way of his brilliant sound.
 Joe Pass: Virtuoso (Pablo): Wow, can this man play. This recording
stands as an all-time great testimony to the potential of jazz guitar, as
Pass transforms the instrument into a one-man group on great tunes
such as “Cherokee,” “How High the Moon,” and “Stella by Starlight.”
 The Swinging Guitar of Tal Farlow (Polygram): On this late ’50s trio
session, Farlow showed his stuff on songs such as “Yardbird Suite” and
the romantic “Taking a Chance on Love.”
Pound Away: Percussion
On cymbals, drums, vibraphones, and handheld accessories, percussionists
provide the pulse that keeps jazz moving. They strike surfaces with sticks
and mallets to produce sounds that contrast with the smoother, flowing
sound of bass, guitar, piano, and wind instruments. I cover different percus-
sion instruments in the following sections.
Drums through the ages
A good drummer is a jazz band’s glue. While bass players (or tubas or trom-
bones in early jazz bands) anchor the beat, the drummer has a multi-purpose
role: Utilizing his bass drum pedal, he can emphasize the beat, but he can
also embellish it with accents or bass drum kicks. Using an array of drums,
cymbals, and accessories, the drummer fills in with accents, flourishes, rolls,
cymbal crashes, and rhythmic combinations.

Chapter 4: Tools of the Trade: The Instruments of Jazz

Great drummers help make great jazz bands. Seated behind horns and given
fewer solos than most of their bandmates, drummers can seem anonymous.
And yet, drummers are the engines who move the music ahead. They keep it
swinging and interact with various lead soloists, spurring them on to new cre-
ative highs.
In the following sections, I take you through the evolution of drums, from the
earliest drums to drums in current times.
The earliest drums
Drums used in jazz today grew from ancient roots. Rhythm was the essence
of African music. Architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe visited New Orleans in
1821, and in his journal made drawings of cylindrical African drums played 
at Sunday celebrations by slaves gathered in Congo Square.
Evolution of the modern drum set used in jazz began in the theater. Prior to
that, drummers in marching, concert, and jazz bands focused on a single 
percussion instrument: bass drum, snare drum, or cymbals. Drummers in
early New Orleans jazz groups led by Buddy Bolden and John Robichaux 
(see Chapter 5 for details on them) used marching drums, although they
sometimes played two drums at once by hand. When they played gigs in
cramped theatres, drummers were forced to play bass and snare drums
simultaneously, because there wasn’t room for two or three people.
In 1909 William Ludwig, founder of Ludwig & Ludwig drums, patented the first
modern bass drum pedal. His durable metal, spring-loaded thumper met the
demands of ragtime and jazz drummers who played faster and harder. The
pedal was the single most important advance that gave drummers the ability
to play powerful polyrhythms anchored by booming bass drum beats.
Drums from the 1920s to the 1940s
By the time Louis Armstrong, King Oliver, and Jelly Roll Morton made their
seminal jazz records of the 1920s (see Chapter 5), drummers led by Baby
Dodds were playing kits that included many items:
 Bass drum with pedal: 28 inches in diameter, a holdover from marching
bands. Big bass drums were standard into the 1930s.
 Snare drum: Throughout jazz, dating back to New Orleans brass 
bands, the snare drum was the key instrument in the drummer’s arsenal.
Depending on how it’s tuned, the snare fits in the middle-to-high range of
a group’s sound. The drummer uses his snare to keep time with just a few
combinations, or he fills in more elaborate textures with rolls and other
fast patterns. Good drummers use snares and cymbals to provide empa-
thetic support for vocalists, horn players, and other lead performers.

 Cymbals: In early jazz, one cymbal was called a choke cymbal. A drum-
mer would accent key moments in the music by striking the cymbal for a
dramatic crash, then choking it with his hand. The abrupt sound made
an exclamation point. In swing and bebop, drummers added more cym-
bals and expanded their role, keeping steady time or adding crashes to
accent emotional high points.
Kits also included wood blocks, cowbells, and other percussive parapherna-
lia, mounted atop the bass drum. By the ’30s, drummers had so much hard-
ware that a separate metal rack was added to hold these accessories. Jazz
drum sets became known as trap drums, for the contraptions kept in the tray.
Photos document the evolution of the drum set through jazz’s history. Bass
drums became much smaller and portable for road trips; they produced a
tighter sound suited to up-tempo swing and bebop. Snare drums, originally
made from bent, laminated wood, were later made from steel, which pro-
duced a crisper, louder sound. Ludwig’s 1920s “Black Beauty” snare, made 
of gunmetal engraved with a scroll pattern, became a coveted item that’s 
still manufactured and popular today.
Drummers eventually added more cymbals, as well as one or two tom-toms,
often mounted atop the bass drum. Tom-toms have proportions similar to 
a bass drum but are much smaller and provide a range of higher pitches,
depending on their size and tuning. Initially, these were Chinese drums with
painted heads that couldn’t be tuned. Eventually, a floor tom on legs became
standard as well. Later, tom-toms were made more like snare drums, only
deeper, and usually from bent wood, not steel.
Cymbals became bigger in the 1930s and ’40s, as drummers began to “ride”
them to keep time. The high-hat — a pair of cymbals on a metal stand
clapped together by a pedal — started out as one cymbal struck by an exten-
sion of the bass drum pedal, then became a pair of cymbals mounted within 
a foot pedal, and finally the high-hat that’s one of a jazz drummer’s essential
tools today. In Count Basie’s orchestra beginning in the 1930s, drummer Jo
Jones became a master of subtle high-hat rhythms and sounds.
Drums in modern times
By the 1940s, bebop drummers such as Kenny Clarke used drum sets that 
are essentially the same as most jazz players use today. (Check out Chapter 7
for bebop details.) Drums now come in a variety of materials (wood, metal,
carbon fiber), and various drummers (like Buddy Rich) expanded their drum
sets to suit their personal needs. However, the basic drum set includes
 Bass drum (with pedal)
 Snare drum
 Mounted tom-tom

 High-hat (see Figure 4-7)
As drum sets changed, so did the role of drummers. In the ’20s and ’30s,
drummers kept a steady beat on bass drum with cymbals and other drums
for accents. By the ’40s, bebop drummers lifted primary rhythmic roles
upward to cymbals and snare by using bass drum for a combination of 
steady rhythms and accents.
In the ’80s, drummers like Ronald Shannon Jackson used their kits to evoke
the layered sound of earlier African drum circles. In a small way, the drum-
mer’s role had returned home to its African roots, except one person now
covered the parts of many.
Good vibes
The vibraphone may be the ultimate jazz instrument. Marrying melodic capa-
bility with percussive power, the instrument slips easily between rhythmic and
lyrical roles. The vibraphone, often called vibes, can add pianolike chords with
an echoed, ringing sound that gives depth to the music.
A vibraphone is a melodic member of the percussion family whose relatives
include marimba, xylophone, and glockenspiel. All have bars laid out like a
piano’s keys, which the player strikes with mallets (see Figure 4-8). While the
marimba and xylophone’s bars are made of wood, vibes use bars made of
metal or aluminum on recent models.

Although rare, vibes have been used in dramatic ways since the 1920s:
 Lionel Hampton’s vibes were a driving lead voice in his big bands.
 Milt Jackson’s vibes added a fresh dimension to bebop.
 Cal Tjader fused vibes with Latinized versions of great jazz tunes.
 Gary Burton has made some of the most provocative and subtle jazz,
often in duo or small-group settings.
Vibes get their vibrations from motorized baffles that open and close inside
resonating tubes hanging below each aluminum bar. The baffles add a waver-
ing (vibrato) effect that can be varied in frequency (by changing the speed of
the motor that turns the baffles) to fit the mood or song. Vibes also have a
pedal that allows the player to damp the bars, that is, to stop them from ring-
ing after they are struck. To watch a vibraphonist in person is to see a magi-
cian work magic with two or four wands that are his mallets.
Treat yourself to a couple of CDs by jazz’s modern masters of vibraphone:
 The Complete Lionel Hampton, Volumes 1 and 2 (1937–1938) (RCA):
Get a good listen to jazz’s early master of vibes. Hear how Hampton’s
playing blossomed when he moved from drums to vibes and combined
his rhythmic sense with new harmonic and melodic potential.
 Dialogue (Blue Note): Bobby Hutcherson was the leading jazz vibra-
phonist of the late ’50s and ’60s, and on his debut solo album from 
1965, he established vibes as a strong counterpoint to jazz’s more famil-
iar instruments. As of 2006, Hutcherson is still in prime form and serves
as co-leader and mentor of the San Francisco Jazz Collective.

Tickling the Ebonies and 
Ivories: Keyboards
Pianists aren’t often the lead instruments in a jazz band, but they’re fre-
quently the glue that holds a group together. That’s because pianists, along
with guitarists, are the only players who can play all of a piece’s basic parts.
Pianists dating back to Jelly Roll Morton and Fats Waller were among jazz’s
first important innovators. Pianists, more than any other jazz instrumental-
ists, also have a long history of making great solo albums.
Just ahead, I explain the piano’s versatile personality and introduce you to
some of the important players and innovations.
The piano’s many talents
The piano was born in the early 1700s as a successor to the harpsichord.
Unlike the plucked strings of the harpsichord, the piano made its debut with
its padded mallets striking the strings. This effect displays a warmer, less
harsh tone. The piano brought durability and increased volume, as well as
foot pedals to control tone and duration of notes. By the end of the 18th 
century, pianos came in models ranging from compact uprights to 19-foot
concert grands, which were eventually used in jazz settings ranging from
clubs to concert halls.
In the years when jazz was invented, pianos were a part of many American
households, which is why a lot of ragtime and early jazz musicians were
pianists. Pianos, encompassing a musical range through 88 keys from bas-
soons to piccolos, also became important instruments for composers such 
as Duke Ellington.
Among jazz instruments, pianos and guitars (which I cover earlier in this
chapter) are the ones that allow a single performer to combine bass lines,
chords, and melodies, with all sorts of rhythmic variations. Pianos are 
basically an orchestra in a box — a big, beautiful wooden box.
Several performers in jazz’s rich history have played the piano:
 Scott Joplin and Eubie Blake wrote and played ragtime during jazz’s 
formative years. They kept one-two-one-two rhythms with left hand 
bass notes and chords while their right hands carried the melody. They
helped infuse the jazz that followed with the “ragged” swinging rhythms
that formed its basis.
66
Part I: All That Jazz: A Tour of the Basics 

 James P. Johnson and Duke Ellington, in 1920s New York City, were
among the great stride pianists, giving the style its name with left hands
striding back and forth between bass notes an octave apart while right
hands carried melodies and improvised. Their syncopated rhythms
(with accents all around the beat instead of right on it) and improvisa-
tions formed the basis of modern jazz piano. In fact, Ellington’s own
style evolved along with jazz, and he collaborated with top players in
most of jazz’s major eras and styles.
 Bud Powell, bebop pianist, used his left hand to provide spare, support-
ing chords as his right hand improvised melodic lines (like what Dizzy
Gillespie and Charlie Parker played on their horns). Hard bop pianists
backed off on the speed and dialed in a soulful, bluesier feeling.
 Cecil Taylor, avant garde pianist, broke the rules with both hands and
pounded the keys (and sometimes other parts of the piano) to drum up
powerful rhythms.
As the players evolved, so did their pianos. Jazz pianists today choose from a
variety of instruments ranging up to Cecil Taylor’s precious Bosendorfers,
which cost more than $100,000.
The organ as the piano’s soulful alter ego
Sacred and profane. That’s one way to view the organ’s evolution as a jazz
instrument. Pipe organs, originally created for spectacular European cathe-
drals, eventually became fixtures in early American movie theatres where
African-American musicians, including Fats Waller and Count Basie, often
played them with boldness. Then, during the 1960s, electric organs became
centerpieces in some very sexy soul-jazz.
In their construction, pipe organs bear obvious similarity to the human voice:
Their sound comes from wind rushing through tubes. And the organ is actu-
ally as much a wind instrument as a member of the keyboard and piano clan.
It has a keyboard, but the sound quality and way it’s produced is similar to
many horns and flutes. Electric organs use electronic circuits to create the
sound. Thanks to foot-pedaled bass notes, a good organist can, by himself,
cover all the elements of a small jazz group: bass, rhythms, chords, melodies,
and improvisations.
Partly because of its sound and partly because of its presence in churches,
organs first met the hands of African-American musicians during Sunday ser-
vices, where Fats Waller first played one. He became a legendary pianist, but
he was also jazz’s first important organist.
67
Chapter 4: Tools of the Trade: The Instruments of Jazz

Due to its wailing sound and lethargic key action compared with piano, the
organ is particularly well suited to slower, bluesy jazz, and in fact, some of
the coolest organ music is blues.
The Hammond B-3, with its big, welling sound, was made famous by blues and
jazz players from Jimmy Smith to Barbara Dennerlein and Joey DeFrancesco.
Because the player needs to hold down a key to produce a sound (instead of a
short strike that produces sound on a piano), the organ requires a more fluid
technique and produces a more flowing sound than the piano. Because it’s
electric, an organ can sustain a note indefinitely; organs also have a variety of
built-in instrumental sounds and are often played through a spinning speaker
that adds a wavering vibrato. The B-3 has two keyboards, as well as foot
pedals for bass notes, which gives it even more range than a piano. While the
B-3 is the standard and its sound is synonymous with organ in blues and jazz,
keyboard players have used other models as well as synthesizers to create
organlike sounds.

Your trip through jazz history in this part begins in
New Orleans, where African, blues, classical, funeral,
marching, and ragtime music come together in this rich
gumbo of a city. The first jazz musicians develop the
music in New Orleans and make the first significant
recordings in Chicago. Then you’re off aboard big band
swing for a stop at New York bebop. Later, it’s a short hop
to hard bop; cool, free, and electric jazz; Latin jazz; and

n this chapter, I tell you the details of the birth of jazz in New Orleans, the
influence of ragtime on early jazz, and the growth of Chicago as the center
of jazz in the 1920s. You also meet a few of the earliest (and most influential)
musicians of jazz.
Blending the Ingredients 
of Jazz in New Orleans
Waves of change swept America between the Civil War and the turn of the
century. Agriculture and rural life gave way to industry and urbanization.
With the end of the war and slavery, many African Americans moved to the
big cities.
Life was simpler then. Riverboats, horse-drawn carriages, and gas lamps
hadn’t been replaced by automobiles, airplanes, and electricity. While some
American cities wrestled with a new multicultural identity, New Orleans was
more accepting of ethnic diversity due to its early history under French and

72
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 
Spanish rule before it became a part of the United States. African Americans,
French, Spanish, Europeans, and Native Americans mixed more freely than 
in most cities, and the atmosphere was conducive to new combinations of
culture and fresh forms of expression.
In this cultural gumbo, the earliest jazz was born during the 1880s and 1890s,
played primarily by African Americans who brought their blues, spirituals,
and work songs together with European music and instruments (especially
brass). Improvisation — the spontaneous invention of rhythms and melodies
that is part of authentic African music — was a vital element in jazz from the
beginning.
New Orleans, with its rich multicultural history and population, was the nat-
ural place for jazz’s invention. Consider the ingredients available during the
last years of the 19th century:
 A mixed population with French, Spanish, African, and West Indian
roots — and a cosmopolitan atmosphere: African music came to New
Orleans via slave trade. Slaves arrived directly from Africa (the first slaves
were brought to Virginia in 1619) or via the West Indies, a busy slave
market because of the warm weather (similar to that of Africa).
 A great concentration of African Americans and other people of color:
In 1880, when New Orleans was a major population center in the South;
55,000 of 210,000 residents were non-white.
 Brass marching bands, a popular tradition since Louisiana was under
French rule: After the Civil War, marching bands brought brass instru-
ments into New Orleans, and into the hands of African-American players.
New Orleans brass bands utilized basic elements of jazz: improvisation,
polyrhythms, and syncopation (see Chapter 3 for more about these
elements).
 Relaxed attitudes toward people of color: The ethnically diverse popu-
lation mixed freely, sharing musical influences. When Code 111 was
enacted in 1894 proclaiming Afro-European Creoles and African Americans
to be of equal status, Creoles moved to the black part of town. This move
hastened the mingling of classically trained Creole musicians with 
bluesier, folksier blacks.
 A wealth of music including blues, spirituals, marches, popular “Tin
Pan Alley” songs, opera, and classical music: When you listen to
recordings by Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Jelly Roll Morton and
others, you can hear these influences.
 Storyville — the notorious district marked out by local statute for
licensed prostitution: Storyville’s night life included dozens of saloons,
honky tonks, and houses of pleasure featuring entertainment — including
early jazz players.

We Were Here First: 
Jazz’s Earliest Musicians
The first jazz bands were offshoots of New Orleans brass bands that marched
in parades and played social occasions ranging from picnics and parties to
funerals. Instrumentation varied, depending on the occasion:
 Marching bands might be larger, with portable instruments.
 Dance/party bands could include piano and occasionally upright bass. 
 Cornets, trumpets, and clarinets were the lead and solo instruments. 
 Tubas, trombones, and basses anchored the bottom end. 
 Drummers kept time on drum kits that combined parade drums.
Jazz has always been defined by its stars — those individual artists who gave
each new style its life, color, and unique personality. Early jazz was no excep-
tion. Although Louis Armstrong and some of his peers are the best known
pioneers (see “Migrating North: Chicago as the New Center of Jazz,” later in
this chapter, for more details about them), the generation before them led the
way, and had a legend of its own. I cover some of the earliest jazz trailblazers
in the following sections.
Buddy Bolden and his powerful cornet
Legend has it that the sharp, powerful sound of Buddy Bolden’s cornet car-
ried for miles through the purple New Orleans dawn — a time of day when a
good party would still be swinging. In the first years of the 20th century, a
transitional period between ragtime and jazz (I cover ragtime in more detail
later in this chapter under “Ragging the Rhythm: The Influence of Ragtime”),
Bolden was the Miles Davis or Charlie Parker of his day.
Born barely a decade after the Civil War, Bolden grew up hearing brass bands
like Excelsior, Eureka, and Onward, which all marched in military-style uni-
forms near his home. Bolden began playing cornet at 17 and, by 1900, was a
star who may have become worldly famous, but his career ended after
mental problems set in and he was institutionalized in 1907.
In 1895, Bolden formed what may have been the first jazz band: bass, drums,
valve trombone, clarinet, guitar, and his own cornet. The music was brassy
and sassy, in sharp contrast to the smoother, softer music made by bands
like Bolden’s rival, John Robichaux (see the next section for more about him).
73
Chapter 5: The Birth of an American Music: Jazz into the 1920s

Bolden was part of the darker uptown African-American population, and his
looser, largely improvised music jumped to marching band beats.
Bolden combined brass band music with blues, spirituals, marching music,
and traditional styles such as polkas, funeral dirges, and ragtime into his own
prototypical jazz. Those who heard him agree on his powerful cornet, ragged
rhythms, and bluesy colors, as well as his gift for improvising — a departure
from the tight scores of ragtime and brass band music.
While experts disagree as to the sophistication of Bolden’s technique, no one
questions the power of his music or that he delivered something fresh and
exciting — a new sound with African rhythms and roots that compelled folks
to pile on to the dance floor. In fact, some nights, when Bolden and
Robichaux’s bands performed blocks apart, Bolden could often lure fans to
his bandstand with his brilliant cornet. Unfortunately, no recordings of
Bolden’s band exist (a rumored recording on wax cylinder — the predecessor
to the record — has never been found).
You know what Bolden’s music sounded like because of musicians who later
described it or played in Bolden’s style. From the beginning, then, jazz’s evo-
lution wasn’t linear, as it often looks on timelines. Instead it occurred through
a rich exchange among bands, composers, and musicians who moved the
new music steadily forward.
But Bolden’s impact was huge and direct. Several early New Orleans trum-
peters heard him when they were budding young players:
 Joe “King” Oliver was born in 1885, eight years after Bolden and was 20
when Bolden hit his prime around 1905.
 Freddie Keppard was in his teens when Bolden hit his prime.
 Louis Armstrong was only five or six in 1905, but he later recalled having
seen and heard Bolden around New Orleans.
 Bunk Johnson, trumpeter, and Fate Marable, pianist, were two more
early New Orleans jazz musicians who probably heard Bolden as
teenagers and went on to significant careers of their own.
Other musicians on the scene provided direct links between Bolden and his
successors. Bud Scott (banjo player) went on from Bolden’s band to perform
with Keppard and Oliver.
Other Bolden-era innovators
While Buddy Bolden was the most innovative of his time, many players were
prominent in New Orleans during the late 1800s and early 1900s:
74
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

 John Robichaux’s orchestra: This group rivaled Bolden’s band.
Robichaux played the more stately Creole variety of jazz, in contrast to
Bolden’s loose, black, bluesy jazz, but Bolden’s group won a battle
between the two bands.
 The Onward Brass Band: The band was one of New Orleans’s top
marching bands beginning in the 1880s. The group continued into the
’30s and was led by famed trumpeter Joe “King” Oliver for a short time
around 1915.
 The Excelsior Band: This troop lasted for decades and saw many top
players pass through its ranks, including cornet and trumpeters Henry
“Red” Allen and Manuel Perez (who also played with Onward), trombonist
Honoré Dutrey (who later played with Louis Armstrong), and clarinetists
Lorenzo and Luis Tio.
 The Original Creole Band: Freddie Keppard featured his trumpet in this
ensemble that was one of the first jazz groups to tour extensively, bringing
live New Orleans jazz to California and many points in between as early
as 1914. Since Keppard began performing as a teenager at the time of
Bolden’s prime, his later recordings are among the few that give an idea
of what jazz sounded like in its early years.
 Freddie Keppard: He was a bandleader and cornetist and was second
only to Bolden among jazz’s early New Orleans horn players. He led the
Olympia Orchestra and in the 1920s was one of the first New Orleans
jazz musicians to move to Chicago. Compared with Armstrong’s smooth
style, Keppard chopped steadily ahead in marching band rhythm.
 George Lewis: Lewis was a clarinetist who stayed and played in New
Orleans while his peers went off to Chicago in the 1920s. He joined trum-
peter Bunk Johnson for a 1942 recording that replicated earlier New
Orleans jazz.
 Bunk Johnson: Born in 1889, trumpeter Bunk Johnson is the important
link between two masters: Bolden and Armstrong. Later, he was one of
the few original New Orleans players still alive to record the music
during its revival in the ’40s.
 Fate Marable: Fate was a pianist whose band played on Mississippi
riverboats in the early 1900s. Louis Armstrong, King Oliver, drummers
Baby Dodds and Zutty Singleton, banjo and guitar player Johnny St. Cyr,
trumpeter Henry “Red” Allen and many other musicians who honed
their skills in Marable’s hard working group.
 George Baquet: A top clarinetist, Baquet founded the Excelsior Band,
played in Keppard’s Creole Orchestra, and mentored Sidney Bechet, one
of the greatest clarinetists to come out of New Orleans.
 Kid Ory: This trombonist, born in 1886, was credited for popularizing
“tailgate” trombone — when New Orleans marching bands performed
from the backs of wagons and the trombone hung out over the tailgate.
75
Chapter 5: The Birth of an American Music: Jazz into the 1920s

 Joe “King” Oliver: Oliver led bands that featured group improvisation.
He was one of the first trumpeters to make extensive use of mutes — a
system of using a variety of objects in and out of the bell of the horn to
get a “wah-wah” sound. Later, musicians including Miles Davis used
mutes to attain their signature sounds. Oliver was an important mentor
to Louis Armstrong, who as a young musician played in Oliver’s band.
Between 1910 and 1920, several Caucasian musicians began ragging (see the
next section for info on ragtime) their music:
 Tom Brown: Born in New Orleans in 1888, he was a trombonist who by
1910 fronted his own bands in New Orleans. Brown played “hot” jazz in
the tradition of Bolden and Keppard. In 1915, he moved to Chicago and
was one of the first musicians whose music was called jass, or jazz.
 Johnny DeDroit & The New Orleans Jazz Orchestra: This group was a
fixture at New Orleans dances and restaurants during the 1920s. DeDroit
was a solid trumpeter, but his band grew to infamy for performing in elf
costumes at the Fairmont Hotel.
 The Louisiana Five: As the second New Orleans jazz group to record its
music, this ensemble popped on the scene only months after the
Original Dixieland Jazz Band (ODJB). The Five’s clarinetist Alcide Nunez
had earlier been in the Original Jazz Band.
 The New Orleans Rhythm Kings: Unlike the ODJB, this band openly
acknowledged the influence of black music in their jazz. Formed by
trumpeter Paul Mares, trombonist George Brunies, and clarinetist Leon
Roppolo, the group made the first integrated jazz recording (featuring
Jelly Roll Morton) in 1923. They also took the New Orleans sound to
Chicago, where their performances inspired the Austin High Gang, which
is covered later in this chapter.
Of all the white bands in this list, the New Orleans Rhythm Kings is the
only band whose music has been resurrected on CD. New Orleans
Rhythm Kings & Jelly Roll Morton captures a turning point in jazz and
race relations in America.
Ragging the Rhythm: The 
Influence of Ragtime
Beginning in the 1890s, the popular music known as ragtime was key to the
creation of jazz. I cover the elements of ragtime music and introduce you to
the genre’s innovators in the following sections.
76
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

The sound of ragtime
Ragtime was among the many varieties of music heard and played around
New Orleans in the early 1900s. Early jazz musicians, particularly pianists,
played the music and incorporated its syncopated rhythms and catchy
melodies into their jazz. Although both black and Creole musicians would’ve
heard ragtime, the Creoles were more likely to play the music verbatim from
sheet music because many of them had formal music training. Early jazz play-
ers acknowledged their music as a variation on ragtime.
Songs displayed a new combination of musical elements: classical, European,
Latin, blues, folk. Ragtime contained little improvisation, but its syncopated
or “ragged” rhythms marked a shift from the stiffer beats of popular dance
and marching music. Whether played by two hands on piano or by several
instruments, the rhythmically rich music overlapped syncopated patterns
and accents that fell in surprising places. (Check out Chapter 3 for more on
syncopation.)
Ragtime was European-influenced, in the sense that it was composed, not
improvised, and featured carefully crafted melodies and harmonies. It didn’t
use the simple, raw blues base common in early jazz. Depending on the player,
ragtime could sound concisely European, or it could become a loose, swinging
precursor of jazz.
The masters of ragtime
During ragtime’s prime years between 1899 and 1917, some 6,000 rags were
composed. The “big three” composers were Scott Joplin (“Maple Leaf Rag”),
James Scott (“Hilarity Rag”), and Joseph Lamb (“American Beauty Rag”). Joplin
was the most prolific, and he surpassed his peers in later years by penning
orchestral works that influenced both jazz and theater music. In the following
sections, I give you some details about the lives of ragtime’s “big three:” Joplin,
Lamb, and Scott.
By 1910, ragtime was a national phenomenon, and in the quest for popularity,
the music became lighter and sweeter, but the ragtime era came to a close in
1917 with Scott Joplin’s passing, and by the end of World War I, elements of
ragtime merged into varieties of jazz including swing — although you could
detect ragtime’s jaunty rhythms and complimentary left and right hand piano
parts in the playing of mostly James P. Johnson. Johnson is important for
bridging styles between earlier ragtime and subsequent swing. Many people
became familiar with Joplin’s music from the popular 1973 film The Sting, with
Robert Redford and Paul Newman.

Scott Joplin
Joplin (1868–1917) was born in Texas, grew up in Texarkana on the Texas-
Arkansas border, and moved to Sedalia, Missouri, where he studied European
music including opera. He performed in Chicago during the Chicago World’s
Fair in 1893, where ragtime was heard for the first time by an estimated 27.5
million people in attendance.
Over the next several years, ragtime became a popular craze, and the sheet
music of Joplin’s technically demanding “Maple Leaf Rag” eventually sold
more than one million copies. After the fair, Joplin attended George R. Smith
College and gave lessons in ragtime performance and composition. In 1899 in
Sedalia, he presented his musical “The Ragtime Dance,” a predecessor to his
later opera “Treemonisha.” Joplin moved to St. Louis in 1901 and focused
more on composing than performing.
Although Scott Joplin wrote several musicals, which never had popular suc-
cess, he was best known for his rags. Between 1899 and his death from syphilis
in 1917, Joplin published at least 60 songs and earned the self-proclaimed title
of “The King of Ragtime Composers.” Although his music was never recorded,
it survives on player piano rolls made from his performances, as well as on
CDs of his compositions played by pianists including Dick Hyman and Josh
Rifkin.
Joseph Lamb
Joseph Lamb (1887–1960) was born in Montclair, New Jersey, and heavily
influenced musically by his two sisters, who were classical pianists. Taking
no formal lessons himself, Lamb picked up piano by watching his sisters and
studying musical scores.
Lamb, a student of Scott Joplin’s, published a dozen popular rags during the
1910s, and was the lone white guy among the three prolific ragtime com-
posers. Lamb’s rags include “American Beauty,” “Champagne,” “Cleopatra,”
and “Ethiopia.”
What made Joseph Lamb such an interesting composer was that not only was
he a self-taught pianist, but also he had a talent of discovering a composer’s
style and giving his compositions a similar style. This technique made his
pieces much like Joplin’s.
An essential recording of Lamb’s music is “American Beauties: The Rags of
Joseph Lamb,” played by pianist Virginia Eskin.

James Scott
Scott (1885–1938), born in Neosho, Missouri, learned piano as a child by listen-
ing to his mother, a former slave, play folk, blues, and gospel songs. His dili-
gence and perfect pitch made him a quick study.
Scott composed close to 40 rags beginning in 1903. After Scott Joplin heard
Scott’s rags, he helped him land a publishing deal, and James Scott’s “Frog
Legs Rag” (1906) sold almost as many as Joplin’s bestselling “Maple Leaf
Rag.” By 1921, Scott had published two dozen popular rags.
Jazz began to eclipse ragtime in popularity in the 1920s, so Scott wrote a
protest song entitled “Don’t Jazz Me — Rag (I’m Music)” in 1921. But by the
late ’20s the popularity of ragtime was declining, and Scott couldn’t find a
publisher for his new compositions.
The evolution of ragtime into stride piano
After ragtime became a popular phenomenon that sold thousands of copies
of sheet music, the piano style, with its jaunty left-hand bass lines and twin-
kling right-hand melodies, evolved into the style known as stride. Stride refers
to the striding pattern of the pianist’s left hand, which jumps between low
notes and chords and notes an octave higher, resulting in a sort of “oompah”
bass pattern. The right hand, meanwhile, plays light, fast melodies. Stride
was important because it was the style that during the ’20s bridged the tran-
sition between ragtime and swing.
Here’s a look at a few important stride pianists.
Eubie Blake
Blake (1883–1983) was a key composer and player during the 1920s prime of
stride piano and early jazz, and, due to his longevity, was around to authenti-
cate early jazz for contemporary listeners.
Blake, a musician, composer, and performer from Baltimore, published his first
rags in 1914. He met his lifelong friend and collaborator, Noble Sissle, the 
following year. When Sissle enlisted in 1917, he recruited Blake to join the 
military band, but Blake was too old to serve, so he began composing music
for the band. After the war, Blake and Sissle went on to write and perform
such notable musical hits as “I’m Just Wild About Harry” and such successful
Broadway shows as “Shuffle Along.”
79
Chapter 5: The Birth of an American Music: Jazz into the 1920s

After their 1925 musical “The Chocolate Dandies” flopped, Blake and Sissle
toured Europe together and eventually broke up. They reunited on Blake’s
1968 album The 86 Years of Eubie Blake.
Too bad The 86 Years isn’t available on CD, but many of Blake’s earlier record-
ings can be found. One of the most interesting albums is Mozart to Modern —
performances by classical musicians of music by Blake, George Gershwin,
and Mozart.
James P. Johnson
A prolific pianist and composer, James P. Johnson (1894–1955) was known as
the King of Stride Piano. Johnson was born in New Brunswick, NJ, and as a
young musician studied and played classical music and popular songs includ-
ing the ragtime of Scott Joplin and others. He was the first of the legendary
Harlem stride pianists, a group that included Duke Ellington and Fats Waller,
who were heavily influenced by Johnson (Waller even took lessons from him).
Time proved the worth of his work. A retrospective of his music was per-
formed at Carnegie Hall in 1945. De Organizer was revived and staged in 2002,
helping to secure his place alongside other greats as a composer of American
music that encompassed blues, classical, jazz, and popular influences. The
inclusion of Johnson’s performances alongside recordings by saxophonist
Coleman Hawkins and pianist Art Tatum proves Johnson’s relevance to the
modern era that blossomed during the 1940s.
The multi-volume James P. Johnson series on the Classics label offers a com-
prehensive listen to Johnson’s recordings, from the 1920s through the 1940s.
Included are his original compositions, recordings with blues singers, versions
of other famous tunes, and his only performance of his tune “Yamecraw” 
(performed on another occasion by Fats Waller at Carnegie Hall).
It’s a New Record: The Original 
Dixieland Jazz Band
Although African-American musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Buddy Bolden,
Sidney Bechet, Jelly Roll Morton, and King Oliver were the players who created
early jazz and sped its evolution, the all-white Original Dixieland Jazz Band
(ODJB), made the first jazz record. 
Cornetist Nick LaRocca led the group. He began his career in the popular
Stein’s Band from Dixie, one of the best white groups of the teens. LaRocca
later claimed to be jazz’s inventor (as did Jelly Roll Morton) after the ODJB
made the first jazz recordings in New York in 1917. But the music copied 
80
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

black jazz, so most experts agree that the ODJB produced no significant
improvisation and didn’t play a major part in jazz’s invention.
Whether you believe that the ODJB contributed to jazz’s evolution, you
should have their music in your collection. Complete Original Dixieland Jazz
Band (1917–1936) gives an excellent overview of the band’s music, from
“Livery Stable Blues” — with horns braying like barnyard animals — to their
version of “St. Louis Blues.”
Migrating North: Chicago as 
the New Center of Jazz
Ragtime had already made a break with traditional American music when
Buddy Bolden and his peers began assimilating it into early jazz (see “Ragging
the Rhythm: The Influence of Ragtime” earlier in this chapter for details). After
Bolden, several musicians who’d played with or heard him took the music to
the next level. Between 1910 and 1920, the music matured, and as southern
blacks moved north for jobs, jazz migrated to Chicago, where bustling clubs
and recording studios gave players a shot at fame.
Sidney Bechet, Johnny Dodds, Freddie Keppard, Jimmie Noone, King Oliver,
Jelly Roll Morton, and Louis Armstrong were key players in the migration.
These musicians bridged the transition between early New Orleans jazz and
1920s Chicago, after they migrated (along with tens of thousands of blacks
from other southern states) to the Windy City, where many of them settled on
the South Side. As they took in new influences (including classical music), the
jazz they played in clubs, such as the black-owned Pekin Inn, the Richelieu,
and the Deluxe, grew more sophisticated.
Like New Orleans jazz, South Side (black) Chicago jazz had distinctive traits:
 Faster tempos, which prompted new higher levels of musicianship and
improvisation.
 Straightforward chord patterns that encouraged improvisation.
 Scads of new popular songs — many in 32-bar format — by composers
including Joe Jordan, Morton, and Spencer and Clarence Williams.
 The rise of singers such as Ida Cox, Alberta Hunter, Ma Rainey, Mamie
and Bessie Smith, Ethel Waters, and others.
 A new cache of leading players, only some of whom could read music
well, with a variety of personal styles, including Armstrong, Bechet,
Dodds, Lil Hardin, Earl Hines, Noone, Oliver, and Luis Russell.
81
Chapter 5: The Birth of an American Music: Jazz into the 1920s

In the following sections, I cover some of the most influential African-American
jazz musicians of 1920s Chicago. (For more about white jazz musicians in
Chicago during this time, see “Going Sweet with a Touch of Hot: Early White
Jazz Musicians,” later in this chapter.)
Louis Armstrong
Louis Armstrong (see Figure 5-1) was the father of modern jazz trumpet and
improvisation (both vocal and instrumental). Armstrong, more than any other
jazz musician, combined instrumental, comedic, compositional, and vocal
ability. He was the first famous player to popularize swinging, syncopated,
bluesy rhythms, and he was a madly inventive soloist and charismatic front
man who charmed a variety of audiences — white and black, young and old.
©William P. Gottlieb, www.jazzphotos.com
Armstrong (1901–1971) was the first modern jazz soloist, playing a lead role,
taking more and longer solos than supporting bandmates. Early bands,
including King Oliver’s, were more collaborative, but Armstrong used his
small groups to showcase his soloing abilities, and the notion of organizing a
Figure 5-1:

jazz.
82
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

band and music around a soloist became a standard approach in modern
jazz. Technically, Armstrong had no equals — no one could match his tone,
dexterity, and the ability to hit high notes unreachable by other musicians.
In Chicago, Louis Armstrong became a star by blowing sharp solos on trumpet
and cornet. While his mentor, King Oliver, played a powerful mid-range, bluesy
cornet, and legendary cornetist Freddie Keppard was penetrating and nimble
(see the next section for more about Keppard), Armstrong combined elements
from both with a special something of his own. Listening to Armstrong’s vocal
and instrumental improvisations, you can hear jazz’s connections to blues
and gospel: the shouts, moans, and cries common to blues; the mournful-to-
joyful sound of gospel. When Armstrong solos, you can also hear how his
instrumental phrasings grow from the way he sings, in the same way that later
solos by Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, and Miles Davis often improvised
lines as lyrical as a singer’s melodies. It’s no coincidence that Young and
vocalist Billie Holiday had such a natural rapport on the recordings they made
together.
By his teens, Armstrong was performing professionally aboard Mississippi
riverboats with bands such as Fate Marable’s. By his 20s, he could out play
any trumpeter at head-to-head improvising battles. In 1918, Armstrong
replaced his early idol King Oliver in Kid Ory’s band, and in 1922, Oliver sum-
moned Armstrong to Chicago to join the Creole Jazz Band as his sidekick cor-
netist. Armstrong recorded 41 cuts with the band in 1923 (a small portion of
the thousands of recordings he made during his career), and eventually sur-
passed Oliver in originality and long-term impact on jazz — Oliver’s career
was confined to the 1920s, and he made only a few recordings as a leader.
At the urging of his second wife, Lil Hardin, a pianist and member of Oliver’s
band, Armstrong joined Fletcher Henderson’s big band as featured soloist in
New York in 1924. Armstrong’s impact was immediate — the band began to
swing like never before.
In 1925, Armstrong returned to Chicago, where he formed his own group (the
Hot Five and later Hot Seven) and began recording as a leader. In the land-
mark recordings he made with those groups, you hear the transition from
old-school ensemble playing, to a new, modern jazz. By the end of the 1920s,
with his Hot Five and Hot Seven, Armstrong had completed what most
experts believe to be his most important recordings.
Every jazz collection must include the Hot Five and Seven sessions, which
produced more than 50 songs such as “Cornet Chop Suey,” “Heebie Jeebies,”
“Potato Head Blues,” “Struttin’ With Some Barbecue,” and “Wild Man Blues.”
The Hot Fives and Sevens boxed set includes these recordings on three discs
as well as Armstrong’s recordings with other early jazz groups and players on
a fourth disc.

Sidney Bechet
Clarinetist Sidney Bechet (1897–1959) had a career that spanned several 
generations of jazz, from early New Orleans through swing, bebop, and the
traditional jazz revival of the 1950s (see Chapters 6 and 7 for details about
these types of jazz). Born in New Orleans, he was known in his teens as the
best clarinet soloist there before he moved to Chicago in 1918. Bechet was the
first great jazz soloist to record (even before Louis Armstrong) and displayed
an abundance of jazz’s basic ingredients: loose, relentless swing and inspired
improvisation. Of Creole heritage, his music combined Euro, African, and blues
elements. He was also one of the first American jazz musicians to move to
Europe in 1925, living for many years in Paris where he died. Bechet was
extremely popular with French fans, but his move kept him less familiar to
American listeners. See Bechet in Figure 5-2.

Jelly Roll Morton
“Jelly Roll” Morton (1890–1941) was a pianist and composer (real name:
Ferdinand Joseph Lamothe, oft-stated La Menthe) who claimed that he
invented jazz, and he certainly had a significant impact. Morton was a woman-
izer, and “Jelly Roll” was common slang for his favorite part of a woman’s
body (this slang is mild compared to the sexual lyrics of some of his songs).
Morton (see Figure 5-3) is best known for the recordings he made with the
Red Hot Peppers in Chicago in 1923 shortly after he moved there. Before that,
he was a peer of Louis Armstrong and King Oliver in the important post-Bolden
years in New Orleans and spent a great deal of time on the West Coast between
1917 and 1922.
© CORBIS
Morton was proud of his French/African “Creole” heritage and broad musical
background encompassing classical and international music (he later noted
the “Latin tinge” in his music). Signature tunes include “Grandpa’s Spells” and
“Black Bottom Stomp,” and you can hear traces of classical music in many of
his recordings. Records made in 1926–1927 in Chicago by Morton’s Red Hot
Peppers rival those by Armstrong’s Hot Five and Hot Seven.

Joe “King” Oliver
Trumpeter Joe “King” Oliver (1885–1938), a native of New Orleans, headed to
Chicago in 1919 (he became known as “King” among friends and fans because
at the time he was the king of jazz trumpet). Oliver wasn’t an innovator on
the order of Louis Armstrong, but he was one of the first cornet/trumpet play-
ers who used mutes in the bell of his horn to attain a distinctive “wah-wah”
sound. Oliver was a powerhouse cornet player who conquered his leading
competitors — Manuel Perez and Freddie Keppard — by out-dueling both
men in an improvisational slugfest.
Trumpeters of the 1920s used mutes or plungers (sometimes the actual
rubber pieces from toilet plungers) in the bells of their horns to achieve a
wailing “wah-wah-wah” sound reminiscent of the sound of voices rising and
falling during a gospel church service. Oliver used mutes, cups, and glasses
to get his signature sound.
The early women of jazz
Although plenty of men were credited with jazz’s invention, women were
there too. Most of them were singers who sometimes crossed the line from
blues into jazz with their interpretations and improvisations. Here are a few:
 Ida Cox (1886–1967): Blues and jazz vocalist Cox sang with Jelly Roll
Morton and King Oliver during the 1920s, and she had a parallel career
billed as “Queen of the Blues,” writing and recording several songs. She
continued performing through the ’40s and ’50s, and in 1962 made the
album Blues for Rampart Street with saxophonist Coleman Hawkins.
Cox’s dozens of recordings are collected on the multi-volume Completed
Recorded Works on the Document label. Blues for Rampart Street has also
been re-released on CD.
 Lil Hardin (1898–1971): While most of early jazz’s women were singers,
Hardin was a pianist who played an essential role in promoting Louis
Armstrong’s career after she married the trumpeter in 1924. She also
composed many of Armstrong’s famous tunes including “Struttin’ With
Some Barbecue.” After she and Armstrong divorced in 1938, she led bands
of her own and appeared in Broadway musicals including Eubie Blake
and Noble Sissle’s “Shuffle Along” (see previous sections for information
on Blake and Sissle).
 Alberta Hunter (1895–1984): Hunter was another singer whose career
crossed between jazz, especially on recordings with trumpeter Louis
86
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Armstrong, clarinetist Sidney Bechet, and Fletcher Henderson’s orchestra.
Later in life she worked as a nurse for several years, before reviving her
career as a vocalist in the 1970s. Recordings from both the early and late
phases of her career are readily available on CD, including the excellent
Amtrak Blues — one of her last albums.
 Ma Rainey (1886–1939): Gertrude “Ma Rainey” grew up singing with her
family in minstrel shows. Like many of her female peers with prolific
careers as blues singers, Rainey also made many recordings with jazz
greats.
The CD Ma Rainey (Milestone) includes her famous “See See Rider Blues”
featuring Armstrong, Henderson, and clarinetist Buster Bailey, as well as
“Slave to the Blues” with Hawkins.
 Bessie Smith (1895–1937): Best known for the early blues and jazz divas,
Smith made her recording debut in 1923, accompanied by pianist Clarence
Williams on “Down Hearted Blues” and “Gulf Coast Blues,” which sold
750,000 copies. Her recording of “St. Louis Blues” with Louis Armstrong
is a diamond of early jazz, and her career as a singer was on the upswing
when she was killed in an auto accident in 1937.
Countless compilation CDs and box sets are devoted to Smith, but the
five-volume Bessie Smith: The Complete Recordings is the one to own if
you want a full representation of her music.
 Mamie Smith (1883–1946): She too was a blues diva who also performed
with jazz heroes like Coleman Hawkins and Bubber Miley, but before the
rest of these ladies, Smith made the first blues recordings in 1920, selling
more than a million of “It’s Right Here For You” and “Crazy Blues.” The
music was smoother and sweeter than some of her gutsier blues.
Crazy Blues (Sony) is an excellent collection of Smith’s best recordings,
while the four-volume Completed Recorded Works (Document) is the
authoritative set.
Investigating other significant 
African-American musicians
Other giants of the New Orleans-to-Chicago transition included
 Henry “Red” Allen (1908–1967): Louis Armstrong’s peer in New Orleans,
trumpeter Allen was one of jazz’s most innovative early soloists. He
played with greats including Fletcher Henderson, Coleman Hawkins, Fate
Marable, King Oliver, and Luis Russell.
87
Chapter 5: The Birth of an American Music: Jazz into the 1920s

 Johnny Dodds (1892–1940): Dodds’ strong improvised lines on clarinet
in bands led by Louis Armstrong and King Oliver served as sharp counter-
point to their trumpets.
 Warren “Baby” Dodds (1898–1959): Baby Dodds was a drummer extra-
ordinaire and brother of clarinetist Johnny Dodds. He pioneered the
design and use of a drum set that let one player produce polyrhythms.
 Earl Hines (1903–1983): In Chicago, pianist Hines was on the forefront
of the hot black jazz being played in South Side clubs. Hines was one of
the few pianists to play in leading swing bands as well as top ’40s bebop
groups that included Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker.
Piano Man (ASV Living Era) is a superb overview of Hines’ early mastery
in both solo and group contexts, while Earl Hines Solo Piano (Delta) is
cool music from the late period.
 Jimmie Noone (1895–1944): His style wasn’t as wild and free as Sidney
Bechet and Johnny Dodds, but his smooth, fluid melodies and improvi-
sations on clarinet gave him a sound of his own.
 George “Pops” Foster (1892–1969): Foster’s career lasted for more than
60 years. He was never prominent as a leader, but you can find his name
and bass-playing on countless albums by other musicians.
 Freddie Keppard (1889–1933): Keppard became popular in 1920s
Chicago and was also responsible for taking early New Orleans music to
the western parts of the U.S. in later years. Legend says he turned down
the opportunity to record the first jazz record as early as 1915. Much of
this cornetist’s music went unrecorded, because apparently, he was
afraid his style would be copied.
 Albert Nicholas (1900–1973): Nicholas was another New Orleans/Chicago
original on clarinet. You can hear him on New Orleans/Chicago Connection
(Delmark) which presents Nicholas playing with great “Dixie-blues” pianist
Art Hodes.
 Manuel Perez (1873–1946): The cornetist Perez was an unsung hero of
the early Creole jazz in New Orleans. He was a member of the Onward
Brass Band before starting his own Imperial Orchestra, and a top musi-
cian aboard riverboats with Fate Marable. Perez’s only recording is with
the Elgar’s Creole Orchestra.
 Luis Russell (1902–1963): In 1927, pianist Luis Russell formed Luis
Russell’s Orchestra — one of the first larger bands (10 pieces) that
pointed the way toward full-blown 1930s big bands. In the 1930s, Louis
Armstrong took over as leader, with Russell as his musical director.
Critics say Russell compromised the driving, bluesy sound of his band
as he helped Armstrong take it in a milder, more commercial direction.
88
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

 Clarence Williams (1898–1965): Williams was a Renaissance man of jazz
and wore many hats: bandleader, composer, manager, pianist, record label
honcho. He began his career in New Orleans and moved on to Chicago
and New York. He was among the first to profit by recording black singers
like Mamie Smith and marketing the music to white northerners. Williams
signed black artists like Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet, and he
helped many black performers maintain control of profits from their
music.
Going Sweet with a Touch of Hot: 
Early White Jazz Musicians
In Chicago during the 1910s and 1920s, as black jazz players created the
jumping South Side scene, they began to have an impact on white Chicagoan.
By the 1920s, some white players sat in with black bands — thankful for the
chance to discover, gracious in their praise of the black pioneers. Some black
musicians didn’t encourage whites to join them and were angry when they
felt white players were copping their ideas.
The best white jazz players abandoned sweet dance music made by white
bands and passionately pursued the hotter black sound. For teenage musi-
cians, it was a satisfying example of adolescent rebellion. White players
tended to have more formal training and hear different, lighter music at home
and in church. Their jazz reflected their roots, in that it was carefully arranged
and precisely played, but lacked the drive and spontaneity of black jazz.
In the following sections, I introduce you to some influential white musicians
who played a vital part in Chicago jazz during the 1920s.
Introducing Bix Beiderbecke
Cornetist Bix Beiderbecke (1903–1931) was Louis Armstrong’s white alter
ego. In Chicago, Armstrong and Beiderbecke knew, and heard, each other.
Like Armstrong, Beiderbecke was a trumpeter and cornetist, and he was the
first famous white jazz soloist and bandleader. Inspired by Armstrong and
other innovators, but also by classical composers including Claude Debussy,
Beiderbecke had a distinctive sound — delicate and lyrical. He made some of
the finest of the new hybridized white jazz.
89
Chapter 5: The Birth of an American Music: Jazz into the 1920s

Born in Davenport, Iowa, Beiderbecke (see Figure 5-4) was a teenage pianist
who taught himself cornet by listening to the Original Dixieland Jazz Band’s
Nick LaRocca and other leading players. But he soon developed an elegant
style of his own. Beiderbecke was an early master of the cornet and one of
the first white jazz players who jammed with African Americans, who
accepted him as a solid jazzman with an original voice.
© Bettmann/CORBIS
After moving to Chicago in 1921, Beiderbecke was smitten with the torrid jazz
scene. He admired fellow cornetists King Oliver and Louis Armstrong, but he
didn’t directly copy them. In 1923, Beiderbecke formed a band called The
Wolverines; later, in St. Louis, Missouri, he launched a band with leading St.
Louis saxophonist, Frankie Trumbauer. By 1925, Beiderbecke was making
magical records of his own. Handsome and hard-partying, Beiderbecke
served as a poster boy for the jazz age.
His imaginative use of the cornet’s middle range (as opposed to gruff lows
and squealing highs emphasized by others) inspired other cornetists and
trumpeters. His innovative ensemble arrangements pointed the way toward
more intricate group arrangements by Fletcher Henderson and other big band
leaders during the late 1920s and early 1930s (see Chapter 6 for more about

Henderson). And his dreamy, melodic compositions for piano were forerun-
ners of impressionistic jazz made by Bill Evans, Miles Davis, and other 1950s
cool jazz players (see Chapter 7).
Tuning in to the Austin High Gang
Chicago’s Austin High Gang (named for their suburban high school) made
jazz in the spirit of their heroes. The Gang was a loose collection of musicians
who hung out together but never recorded under that name. As student musi-
cians, many of the members played classical music and studied theory,
which gave a methodical sound to their jazz. In high school, they practiced
together constantly and performed at school dances.
The Gang ventured to South Side clubs and dance halls, where they were
blown away by a wild, smoky scene featuring uninhibited dancers and black
performers such as Louis Armstrong, Baby Dodds, and King Oliver. They
worshipped early white players such as Beiderbecke and the New Orleans
Rhythm Kings (see “Other Bolden-era innovators” earlier in this chapter for
more about them) who’d been inspired by King Oliver and his bands. Members
and associates of the Austin High Gang included the following:
 Eddie Condon: Condon (1905–1973) was one of the few guitarists to play
a prominent part in Chicago jazz in the years before electric guitars.
 Bud Freeman: Freeman (1906–1991) was one of the Gang’s leading saxo-
phonists and played with hero Bix Beiderbecke.
 Benny Goodman: Goodman (1909–1986) was a young jazz player with
extensive musical training. He studied classical clarinet as a boy and lis-
tened to leading New Orleans clarinetists as he developed a jazz style of
his own. Goodman played in Ben Pollock’s band in Chicago and later led
a big band of his own that played in the sweeter, popular, white swing
style (see Chapter 6 for more on Goodman and big bands).
 Gene Krupa: Krupa (1909–1973) became famous as the flamboyant, hair-
shaking, hard-drumming catalyst of Benny Goodman’s band. His playing
helped create the distinctive sound of popular Goodman tunes such as
“Sing Sing Sing.”
 Pee Wee Russell: A fresh voice on clarinet and a veteran of early
Southwestern jazz bands, Russell (1906–1969) was a prime Chicago-style
jazz player, but he also fit in effectively with younger bebop and avant
garde jazz players such as bassist Charlie Haden and pianist Steve Kuhn
during the ’60s. (See Chapters 7 and 8, respectively, for more about
bebop and avant garde jazz.)

ew Orleans rose to a Mardi Gras of primal jazz through the early 1900s,
but during the late teens and early 1920s, the best New Orleans musi-
cians migrated to Chicago to take advantage of the vibrant jazz scene (see
Chapter 5). In the 1930s, though, New York City became the new capital of
music composing, publishing, and recording and the hottest place for new jazz.
Already, in Chicago, the Midwest, and New York, larger bands had replaced
small groups as jazz’s dominant format. A new generation of big band leaders
launched the Swing Era in earnest. Born as America emerged from the
Depression, big band swing — a music that offered upbeat escape — became
a popular phenomenon. Traditionalists also believe that the big band era 
produced jazz that’s never been equaled (fans of bebop and newer music give
them a good argument).
Initially, two types of big bands emerged in the late 1920s and the early 1930s
(not counting the bands led by Duke Ellington, who belongs in a class all his
own — see “Coronating Duke Ellington” later in this chapter):
 Smooth and sophisticated bands played intricate arrangements and con-
fined soloists to smaller roles. College-educated players such as Benny
Goodman, Fletcher Henderson, Coleman Hawkins, and Don Redman 
populated many of these smooth bands.
 Rougher blues-oriented “territory” bands from the Midwest and Southwest
and their successors in New York City (such as Count Basie’s band)
showcased talented soloists.

In this chapter, I explain the beginnings of the big band era in big cities and
on the road with Midwest territory bands. I also introduce you to a variety of
important 1930s jazz figures, including Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and
Benny Goodman.
In with a Bang: Big Band Beginnings
Big band jazz came of age in the 1930s. Through the 1920s, groups in New
Orleans, Chicago, and New York City expanded in size and musical sophisti-
cation. Leaders like Count Basie, Benny Goodman, and Fletcher Henderson
were among the ’20s pioneers who became heroes of ’30s swing. New York
became the center of the music industry, while big band music spread to ball-
rooms across the country. More than any time in history, jazz was a central
part of mainstream American entertainment.
The new hub: New York City
Jazz had been growing in New York City since the turn of the century.
Musicians found all the elements that would make big band jazz a popular
and artistic success. Songwriting and music publishing were based out of
New York City, and big bands relied on popular songs, many of which came
from Broadway shows. The recording industry, which had been centered in
Chicago during the 1920s, began shifting to New York. By 1935, when big
band jazz’s Golden Era began, most of the jazz musicians who led important
big bands were in New York.
Not coincidentally for jazz, the Golden Era of big bands coincided with the
Golden Age of radio. Radio propelled big band music across the country, and
New York City owned the title of nation’s media hub. As many as 90 million
Americans listened to the radio, and big band music could be heard over the
air in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and many other cities.
The prime big band swing years highlighted several artists who set the stage —
both through their musical inventions and through their new ideas about the
meaning of being black in America. These ambitious artists shared a sophisti-
cated knowledge of music:
 Will Marion Cook (1869–1944): Cook, an African-American violinist
and composer, studied at Oberlin Conservatory and the National
Conservatory of Music (with Dvorak). He led the 50-piece New York
Syncopated Orchestra and wrote orchestral music in the classical 
94
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

tradition, while utilizing the rhythms and spontaneity of African and
African-American music. He also mentored young musicians Sidney
Bechet, clarinetist/saxophonist and Duke Ellington, pianist/bandleader.
Cook also helped open Broadway productions to black players.
 James Reese Europe (1881–1919): Europe laid the groundwork for the
big bands of the 1930s with music he made in 1913 and 1914. Europe
composed pieces for ensembles as large as his 50-piece Hell Fighters
Band (from the 369th U.S. Infantry), yet he infused his music with rag-
time’s syncopated momentum. (See Chapter 5 for details about ragtime.)
He collaborated with Cook to compose In Darkeydom in 1914, and he
and the fighters recorded 24 tunes before Europe was stabbed to death
by a drummer at a gig in Boston.
Today, the music is available on the CD James Reese Europe’s 369th
Infantry Hell Fighters Band (Memphis Archives).
 James P. Johnson (1894–1955): Johnson, a giant of stride piano (see
Chapter 5) emerged during the late 1920s and early 1930s as one of jazz’s
first distinguished composers. In symphonic works such as “Symphony
Harlem,” “Tone Poem,” and “Yamecraw,” he incorporated blues and
gospel within a classical context.
By 1923, New Orleans-flavored jazz belatedly spread across the country. The
artists responsible for this circulation included King Oliver, the Original
Dixieland Jazz Band, Jelly Roll Morton, Kid Ory, Clarence Williams (with Sidney
Bechet) and Doc Cook (with Freddie Keppard and Jimmie Noone), and the
New Orleans Rhythm Kings.
By the late ’20s and early ’30s, jazz, made by giants like Morton, Bechet, Oliver,
Armstrong, and Beiderbecke, evolved into big band swing. (See Chapter 5 for
more about all these musicians.)
In New York, the sophisticated, elegant music of big band swing replaced the
simpler sounds of New Orleans and South Side Chicago. Big band arrangers
such as Don Redman (with Fletcher Henderson) and Duke Ellington (eventu-
ally aided by Billy Strayhorn) crafted their music to make dramatic use of
expanded lineups. Intricate arrangements used sections of saxophones,
trumpets, and trombones to create the kind of drama formerly achieved by
soloists. In the context of these bands and arrangements, where the group
sound took first priority, soloists were confined to certain places within tight
arrangements. (Soloists didn’t take the lead until small-group jazz bloomed in
the 1940s. See Chapter 7 for more info.)
Most jazz artists who wanted to make it big needed to be in New York. Even
star soloists from the Midwest “territory bands,” an essential part of big band
history, wound up in New York eventually. (I cover these bands in detail later
in this chapter.)
95
Chapter 6: The Golden Era of Big Band Swing: The 1930s and Beyond

When New York City emerged as the new center for jazz, Harlem became the
core of black creativity. The Harlem Renaissance of the 1930s produced a
flowering of African-American arts led by writers like Langston Hughes and
Zora Neale Hurston. Jazz was an essential part of the scene. Duke Ellington
and Cab Calloway led house orchestras at the Cotton Club. Pianists James P.
Johnson, Willie “The Lion” Smith, and Fats Waller made quantum leaps
beyond the earlier piano of Earl Hines and Jelly Roll Morton. Not only were
Ellington, Johnson, and Waller phenomenal pianists, but they composed
music that has stood the test of time and is today regarded as some of the
finest American music of the 20th century.
Around the same time, New York also became the core for American popular
song. Composers such as Harold Arlen, George and Ira Gershwin, Jerome
Kern, and Cole Porter wrote dozens of Broadway hits that became raw mater-
ial for generations of jazz musicians who played the melodies and improvised
around the chord changes.
Leading the way: Fletcher Henderson
As you listen to Fletcher Henderson’s big band, you hear jazz evolving from
early New Orleans style to sophisticated swing. Georgia-born Henderson
(1897–1952) grew up listening to the blues of Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey,
and the big bands he led in New York beginning in 1923 swung with a rootsy,
bluesy feel — a feel absent from most ragtime and dance bands.
Henderson’s ensembles were more polished than the territory bands that
emerged at the same time (see the section on these bands later in this chap-
ter for details). His musicians were generally well trained, and many of them
read music (not always the case in the territory bands). Being able to read
well was essential because Henderson relied on tight arrangements with Don
Redman, Benny Carter, and Bill Challis. Henderson’s orchestra pointed the
way toward famous big bands of the 1930s (in fact, Henderson became Benny
Goodman’s arranger). Redman — saxophonist, clarinetist, and sensitive
arranger — held the key to Henderson’s success.
As early as 1924, when Henderson recruited Louis Armstrong, the combina-
tion of Redman’s charts and Armstrong’s virtuosity gave the music a hot, new
sound. Later, the band’s arrangements grew around star soloists such as sax-
ophonists Leon “Chu” Berry and Benny Carter, trumpeters Roy Eldridge and
Rex Stewart, and trombonists J.C. Higginbotham, Rex Stewart, and Dickie
Wells. From this group, Carter and Eldridge were most successful at making
the transition from big bands to the small group era of the ’40s and ’50s,
where their talents as improvisers could shine even brighter.
96
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Comparing Henderson’s big band during the group’s formative years in the
1920s, with Jelly Roll Morton’s Red Hot Peppers of that same era, gives you
an idea of the music’s evolution. Morton brought opera and classical influ-
ences into his music, but his arrangements, although tight, were never as
intricate or inventive as Redman’s arrangements for Henderson. Morton’s
band included seven members, compared with the 10 or 12 or more that
added new colors, complexities, and textures beginning with Henderson.
With its rich orchestrations, swinging rhythms, and subtle interplay between
sections, Henderson’s big band (including star soloists Louis Armstrong and
Lester Young) was the most important forerunner of the legendary big bands
of the 1930s. After Henderson became Benny Goodman’s arranger, musical
ideas transferred from one generation to the next.
Henderson’s importance is apparent on the boxed-set The Fletcher Henderson
Story: A Study in Frustration (Sony) and the multi-volume Fletcher Henderson
CD series on the Classics label.
Fletcher Henderson’s peers
Henderson boosted jazz into the modern era of big band swing by expanding
the size of jazz bands toward full-blown big bands, handpicking his star
soloists, and arranging material to showcase them. As the music picked up
steam, several other bandleaders helped bring the new music to the brink of
its golden era. Of course, Duke Ellington began organizing big bands in the
1920s and eventually built bands that many critics and fans feel were the
finest of the swing era. Ellington is covered later in this chapter.
Meanwhile, as Henderson and Ellington led the charge, several other big-
band leaders helped sustain the moment into the 1930s prime of swing. Some
were pure showmen who knew how to grab and hold an audience. Others
placed a higher priority on jazz as an art form. Let’s take a close look at a few
of the prime big band leaders from the music’s formative years.
 Cab Calloway (1907–1994): The “Hi-De-Ho” man mesmerized audiences —
beginning at Harlem’s Cotton Club in the ’30s — with his wild jazz, 
flip-flopping hair, big smile, warm vocals, and big bands.
 Benny Carter (1907–2003): Carter played a part in nearly every phase of
jazz’s development. His instrumental talents included the saxophone
and trumpet, but Carter also composed and arranged music. During the
early 1930s, he performed and arranged for Fletcher Henderson and
McKinney’s Cotton Pickers.
97
Chapter 6: The Golden Era of Big Band Swing: The 1930s and Beyond

Carter went to London during the mid-1930s to become a staff song-
smith and arranger for the BBC dance orchestra. While in London,
Carter eventually had a tremendous influence on the jazz of Western
Europe. When Carter returned to the United States, he led a popular big
band in New York City, and his career continued into the 1990s.
 Lionel Hampton (1909–2002): A jazz institution as both a musician and
bandleader — Hampton reigns as the most famous of all jazz vibraphon-
ists. In fact, in 1930, Hampton sat in on a recording session with
Armstrong, and during a break Hampton walked over to a vibraphone
and started to play. He ended up playing the vibes on one song. The
song became a hit; Hampton had introduced a new voice to jazz and
became “King of the Vibes.” His bands swung wildly.
 Earl Hines (1903–1983): Hines led one of the Midwest’s most popular
1930s big bands, home-based at Chicago’s Grand Terrace hotel. His
music gained more influence in some ways than Duke Ellington’s from
the same period. NBC radio carried the Hines band to points west and
south of Chicago.
 Andy Kirk (1898–1992): Kirk’s Clouds of Joy featured the arrangements
and piano of Mary Lou Williams. Unlike the ensemble’s Kansas City
peers, the band relied less on collective riffing (short, rhythmic phrases)
and more on Williams’s imagination, as well as solos by saxman Don
Byas (who became a leading soloist of both swing and bebop but fell
from American radar when he moved to Europe during the 1940s) and
trumpeter Howard McGhee.
 Jimmie Lunceford (1902–1947): Showmanship, swing, and tight arrange-
ments mark characteristics of Lunceford’s band, beginning with a 1934
stint at New York’s fabled Cotton Club. Sy Oliver’s lyrical arrangements
enabled some of the band’s finest music. In July of 1947, Lunceford 
collapsed and died while signing autographs in a Seaside, Oregon, record
store. The record of his death sites a heart attack as the cause, but
rumors circulated that a racist restaurant owner poisoned him.
 McKinney’s Cotton Pickers: Formed in Detroit during the early ’20s by
drummer William McKinney (who expanded his group from six to ten
pieces), the band made a big bang in Harlem ballrooms beginning in
1929. McKinney plucked arranger Don Redman from Fletcher Henderson
in 1927, and he also recruited star players such as saxophonist Coleman
Hawkins and pianists James P. Johnson and Fats Waller. The Cotton
Pickers were hot enough to hold their own with the more famous Duke
Ellington and Count Basie bands before they disbanded in 1934.
 Chick Webb (1909–1939). Hunchbacked and less than five feet tall,
Webb fought off congenital tuberculosis of the spine to become one of
the most competitive drummers and bandleaders of the big band era. In
a 1937 battle of the bands at New York City’s Savoy Ballroom, Webb’s
band blew away the rival Benny Goodman big band (with Gene Krupa on
98
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

drums). Powered by Webb’s dynamic personality and charismatic playing,
his orchestra featured a young singer named Ella Fitzgerald.
Webb discovered Fitzgerald after she won a talent contest at the Apollo
Theatre, became her legal guardian, and built his show around the
singer, who provided him with his biggest hit record, “A Tisket-A-
Tasket,” in 1938.
Stompin’ at the Savoy (Proper) is a comprehensive box set that includes
Fitzgerald’s hit and 99 other tunes ranging from updates of New Orleans
standards to flashy new swing numbers.
The influence of Chicago big bands
In Chicago, sweeter, milder white dance bands struck out in fresh directions.
Many of these bands recorded in New York, and many of their players later
joined famous New York bands. They had a smooth, swinging sound that
appealed to the mostly white crowds in the dance halls and ballrooms where
they performed. By most accounts, they didn’t have the impact of Fletcher
Henderson and his successors (see the previous sections), but they did
advance the cause of big band swing with larger lineups and sophisticated
arrangements.
 The Casa Loma Orchestra: Glen Gray formed his group (with advice
from Jean Goldkette) in Detroit in 1927, and it was named for the Casa
Loma Hotel in Toronto, where it was the house band. With arrangements
by guitarist Gene Gifford, Casa Loma became one of the leading white
swing bands and made several popular recordings (including “Casa
Loma Stomp” and “Smoke Rings”) that are available today on CDs.
Through various lineups, the band continued to tour until 1963.
 Jean Goldkette (1899–1962): His popular dance orchestra performed
early swing, with solos by Bix Beiderbecke (see Chapter 5) and trombon-
ist Tommy Dorsey. Under Glen Gray’s direction, this ensemble became
the famed Casa Loma Orchestra.
 Ben Pollack (1903–1971): Pollack, the original drummer with the New
Orleans Rhythm Kings, collaborated with Jelly Roll Morton. Pollack’s
swing bands included clarinetist Benny Goodman, trumpeter Harry
James, saxman Bud Freeman, and trombonist/arranger Glenn Miller. In
1934, members of Pollack’s band joined singer Bob Crosby’s (Bing’s
brother) popular swing ensemble.
 Glenn Miller (1904-1944): The Glenn Miller Band became one of the
swing era’s most popular bands during World War II, beginning with 
the 1940 hit “Tuxedo Junction” and continuing through Miller’s military
service, when he led the Glenn Miller Army Air Force Band. Their sound
featured clarinet and saxophone carrying the melody with the rest of the
99
Chapter 6: The Golden Era of Big Band Swing: The 1930s and Beyond

saxophone section providing a subtly shaded backdrop. Miller was a
trombonist and arranger in bands led by Ray Noble and Ben Pollock
before he formed his own group in 1937.
 Paul Whiteman (1890–1967): Whiteman was a famous bandleader
during the 1920s and the self-proclaimed “King of Jazz” — although
purists don’t even consider his music jazz, because it lacked swing and
improvisation. Whiteman’s group included star soloists Bix Beiderbecke
(see Chapter 5), trombonist Jack Teagarden (see Chapter 6), trumpeter
Bunny Berigan, and guitarist Eddie Lang. Despite his stellar lineup of
jazz musicians, Whiteman preferred melodic, intricately arranged popu-
lar music. For instance, he commissioned George Gershwin’s famous
composition, “Rhapsody in Blue.”
Traveling the Highway: Midwest
Territory Bands
New York big band jazz reached new levels of sophistication with fresh
arrangements and technically proficient players. But looser, blues-based
bands played and toured through the Midwest in the 1930s. These bands,
known as territory bands, performed on stages in San Antonio, Dallas,
Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Memphis, St. Louis, and Omaha.
The competitiveness of the regional bands reached an all-time high. Passion
motivated their music more than the desire for commercial success drove
many of the New York big bands. In the following sections, I introduce you to
Bennie Moten, an important territory bandleader, and some of the biggest
bands of the day.
Bennie Moten
Moten (1894–1935), a ragtime pianist who formed his band in Kansas City,
first recorded in 1923 with a six-piece New Orleans-style lineup. By 1924, 
he returned to the recording studio but this time in Camden, New Jersey. 
The ensemble expanded to 10-pieces — only two pieces shy of Fletcher
Henderson’s big band across the Hudson River in New York City (I discuss
Henderson in detail earlier in this chapter).
Moten’s music grew out of early jazz and blues, with impromptu head
arrangements (short melodic themes) that led to extended improvisational
jams. Moten’s band had a buoyant rhythm section that served as a model for
big band rhythm sections to come.
100
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

After 1929 Moten turned piano and arranging duties over to Bill “Count” Basie,
who modeled his own big band after Moten’s. (I talk about Count Basie later in
this chapter.) Moten’s ensemble made its last and most memorable recordings
in New Jersey in 1932. Arrangements by saxophonist Eddie Barefield and 
guitarist Eddie Durham alternated ensemble passages with sizzling solos by
trumpeter Oran “Hot Lips” Page, saxophonist Ben Webster, and others.
Scoping out other territory bands
Other territory bands swung hard with that loose, wide-open blues feel.
Recording wasn’t common in the Midwest; so much of this music (with the
exception of Bennie Moten’s) isn’t well documented (today, you can choose
from several excellent CDs of Moten’s music). Even though their recorded
legacies remain small, their reputations still loom large even today.
 Troy Floyd’s nine-piece San Antonio ensemble had tight arrangements
and a smooth, less bluesy feel than its peers, as captured on recordings
from 1928 and 1929.
 Walter Page’s Blue Devils hailed from Kansas City and featured top play-
ers including trombonist and arranger Eddie Durham, trumpeter Oran
“Hot Lips” Page, and singer Jimmy Rushing.
 Jesse Stone’s Blues Serenaders was a top Kansas City group, famous
today for helping to launch a young saxophonist named Coleman
Hawkins.
 Alphonse Trent’s all-black band broke color barriers with a longstanding
gig at the all-white Adolphus Hotel in Dallas during the 1920s. They also
reached a radio audience with live shows on a Dallas station.
Coronating Duke Ellington
Jazz’s gods (and goddesses) traditionally ascend mostly on the basis of
instrumental prowess, but for his impact in several important areas, Edward
Kennedy “Duke” Ellington (1899–1974) is without equal.
Born in Washington, D.C., in 1899, Ellington (see Figure 6-1) wanted to be a
painter, which may help explain the colorful sweep of his music. Duke’s
career spanned many genres: ragtime, New Orleans jazz, late-1920s territory
band, New York big band, 1940s bebop, 1950s cool jazz, and 1960s free jazz.
He also made contributions as a leader, composer, arranger, and pianist, and
he assimilated a tremendous variety of influences including classical music.
101

Like other inventors of sophisticated big band music, Ellington had formal
training. He moved to New York in 1922 and two years later took over Elmer
Snowden’s band, a six-piece unit, which was typical of the time. Inspired by
James P. Johnson’s classically influenced ragtime compositions, Ellington
began to write music of his own.
By 1926, Ellington’s group had grown to 12 pieces, but the stiff music couldn’t
compare with Louis Armstrong’s or Jelly Roll Morton’s (see Chapter 5 for more
about them). Trumpeter Bubber Miley pushed Ellington toward a looser, swing-
ing sound, and by the late 1920s, Ellington’s arrangements featured swelling
horns by soloists Miley, alto saxman Johnny Hodges, clarinetist Barney Bigard,
and trombonist Tricky Sam Nanton.
Ellington created waves of tension by setting sections against each other,
then making them “play nice” together. Blaring trumpets cut across silky
smooth saxes; melodies batted back and forth; tempos changed for dramatic
emphasis and the music swung with syncopated rhythms. Ellington some-
times composed at a piano with his band around him, and he wrote their
improvised melodies into his scores.

Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

The Duke was among the first big band leaders to showcase a singer’s voice
as an instrument, when Adelaide Hall sang wordless melodies on “Creole
Love Call” (Hall later lived in London and starred in stage musicals such as
“The Sun Never Sets”). Ellington also employed bassists in bold new ways, as
Jimmy Blanton and Oscar Pettiford became soloists and improvisers on par
with saxophonists and trumpeters.
As Ellington’s compositions matured, his songs became masterful ensemble
pieces for a dozen or more distinctive voices, as well as showcases for his tal-
ented musicians. Although Fletcher Henderson, Chick Webb, Jimmy Lunceford,
and other big band leaders of the 1920s advanced the music beyond the
rougher New Orleans and Midwest/Territory sounds (I discuss the Midwest
territory bands earlier in this chapter), Ellington elevated the art of big band
music to new heights of sophistication. His music wasn’t just entertainment: 
He often composed with a message in mind, and many of his compositions
meditated on his experiences as an African American. In fact, Ellington often
imagined theatrical scenes while he composed.
Ellington’s band reigned for five decades, and Ellington composed dozens of
tunes, later collaborating with his alter ego, Billy Strayhorn. (Strayhorn was
the band’s unsung creative force from 1938 through 1967, on compositions
and arrangements including “Lush Life,” “Passion Flower,” and “Take the A
Train.” Visit www.billystrayhorn.com.) Although big bands faded following
World War II, Ellington wrote and recorded jazz through two more decades.
Ellington enjoyed a comfortable income for the rest of his life thanks to royal-
ties from “Mood Indigo” and other compositions. The royalties helped subsi-
dize his big band, which often operated near break even or lost money.
There are at least 1,000 Ellington CDs covering the band’s music from the
1920s through the 1960s, and even, under new leaders including his son
Mercer, after Duke’s death. You probably want something from each decade;
studio sessions as well as live performances at Newport Jazz Festival and
elsewhere; his “Anatomy of a Murder” film score, his sacred music, and his
collaborations on piano with John Coltrane and other great improvisers.
Crowning a Count and a King of Swing
Jazz is famous for its royalty, and among this circle the Duke (Ellington) is a
sort of god. Yet there are many other players who earned their titles, includ-
ing soloists like Bird and Diz, and bandleaders like William “Count” Basie and
Benny Goodman — the King of Swing. Here, you take a look at the Count and
the King and what their creative talents contributed to the golden era of big
band swing.
103
Chapter 6: The Golden Era of Big Band Swing: The 1930s and Beyond

Count Basie
One of the greatest of the swing bands belonged to Count Basie (1904–1984).
Born in New Jersey, Basie (see Figure 6-2) spent his teens touring and getting
a behind-the-scenes knowledge of the world of entertainment. He also served
as an accompanist for silent films.
Basie lived in Harlem during the 1920s, where he played a variety of venues
and heard pianists James P. Johnson, Lucky Roberts, and Willie “The Lion”
Smith. He also met Fats Waller, who accompanied a silent film on pipe organ
at the Lincoln Theatre, and eventually Waller let Basie join him at the organ.
Basie was traveling with a vaudeville company that broke up in Kansas City,
and he decided to stay there.
©William P. Gottlieb, www.jazzphotos.com
In swing music, Basie rose to stardom through territory bands: Walter Page’s
Blue Devils and The Kansas City Orchestra, led by Bennie Moten (he served
as both pianist and arranger). Members of Moten’s group formed the nucleus
of Basie’s first band, the 9-piece Barons of Rhythm. (I cover territory bands
earlier in this chapter.)
Figure 6-2:

Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

When producer John Hammond (who also made Benny Goodman famous)
heard the Basie band’s 1936 radio broadcasts from Kansas City’s Reno Club,
he offered a recording contract and brought the band to New York City for a
gig at the Roseland Ballroom. Basie’s band expanded to 15 members and
became the house band at the Famous Door on New York’s 52nd Street.
Within two years Basie’s orchestra made its fame with hard-swinging tunes
such as “One O’Clock Jump” and “Jumpin’ at the Woodside.” Compared with
the carefully orchestrated sound of Benny Goodman and Duke Ellington’s
bands, Basie’s retained the looser, bluesy feel of the territory bands. Instead
of songs arranged all the way through, Basie’s band was known for riffing:
using head arrangements, consisting of a basic melody or “head,” at the start
of the song, followed by improvisations from several band members. Often,
the intuitive interplay between the players and sections sounded as if the
music was intentionally orchestrated.
Over the years, the Basie band doubled as a PhD program of sorts for musi-
cians. Basie’s list of phenomenal players include
 Jimmy Rushing, singer
 Herschel Evans and Lester Young, saxophonists
 Buck Clayton and Harry “Sweet” Edison, trumpeters
 Dickie Wells, trombonist
 Jo Jones, drummer
 Freddie Green, guitarist
Basie’s band played and recorded excellent music for several decades. Music
from the ’40s through the ’70s, with arrangements by Neal Hefti, Frank Wess,
Frank Foster, Thad Jones, is some of the band’s finest.
Every jazz collection should include a few recordings of the Basie band featur-
ing superb vocalists Jimmy Rushing, Big Joe Turner, and Joe Williams. Include
Sing Along with Basie, also featuring vocal trio Lambert, Hendricks & Ross in
your collection. Another must-have is the superstar collaboration between the

Benny Goodman, the “King of Swing,” carried big band swing to new popular-
ity and led the way in showcasing star soloists. Goodman (1909–1986) openly
expressed his admiration for early African-American swing bands, such as
Fletcher Henderson’s. (I talk about Henderson earlier in this chapter.) At the
105

suggestion of producer John Hammond, Goodman (see Figure 6-3) hired
Henderson to be his arranger. To meet the demand of the radio audience and
ballroom dancing crowd, both black and white bands tended toward smoother,
middle-of-the-road sounds.

As a young musician, Goodman classically trained on clarinet, in Chicago, he
also studied the music of Louis Armstrong and King Oliver (see Chapter 5), as
well as clarinetists Buster Bailey, Barney Bigard, Johnny Dodds, Albert
Nicholas, and Jimmie Noone.
Goodman’s big band music had a more precise and exacting sound than Count
Basie’s loosely swinging, liberally improvising crew, but Goodman had an ear
for gifted players. The music swung in a ballroom dancing mode, and the
leader himself played peerless clarinet.
Goodman integrated his group with Charlie Christian, Lionel Hampton, Teddy
Wilson, and others as essential members. The small group recordings he made
with these players during the 1930s sped the transition from big band swing to
a format that left more room for improvisation. Given Goodman’s phenomenal

popularity, his use of black musicians helped launch their careers (with con-
certs and recordings) in a way that wouldn’t have been possible had they
been in all-black bands.
The prime of Goodman’s big band career came between 1936 and 1939, when
his band included some big namers:
 Harry James, Bunny Berigan, and Ziggy Elman, trumpeters
 Jess Stacy and Teddy Wilson, pianists
 Davey Tough and Gene Krupa, drummers
 Lionel Hampton, vibraphonist
When Goodman’s band played Carnegie Hall in 1938, joined by members of
the Count Basie and Duke Ellington bands, the milestone performance elevated
the music to new legitimacy. This performance was the first time jazz had
been featured in such a big way at a concert hall previously known for classical
music. Even though Goodman was the headliner, he had the grace to include
several great players who provided inspiration.
The recording of this concert is available on the CD Carnegie Hall Jazz
Concert (Sony), and it should be a part of your collection.
Coming on Strong: Other
Important Big Bands
Although Count Basie and Benny Goodman were the powerhouses of big
band swing, several other notable bands pushed the music forward.
 Charlie Barnet (1913–1991): Barnet, a leader and saxophonist who
admired Count Basie and Duke Ellington’s big bands, was one of the first
to front an integrated orchestra; his group also was one of the first pre-
dominantly white bands to play Harlem’s famed Apollo Theatre. Barnet
assembled a big band in 1932 and became well known with the 1939 hit
“Cherokee.” In the 1940s, Barnet’s band recorded more hits including
“Skyliner,” and as the band moved to demanding bebop charts, the
lineup included rising stars such as trumpeters Maynard Ferguson and
Doc Severinsen and guitarist Barney Kessel.
 Bob Crosby (1913–1993): A bandleader and vocalist (brother of Bing
Crosby), he helped Chicago-style jazz evolve into big band swing with
new arrangements of earlier jazz tunes such as “South Rampart Street
Parade” and “Wolverine Blues.”
107
Chapter 6: The Golden Era of Big Band Swing: The 1930s and Beyond

 Jimmy Dorsey (1904–1957): A solid Chicago-style clarinetist (and saxo-
phonist), Dorsey was one of the first to use the alto sax in jazz at a time
when the tenor prevailed.
 Tommy Dorsey (1905–1956): Known for his warm tone on trombone,
Dorsey took an instrumental lead (like his brother, Jimmy) in early
Chicago jazz and the transition of jazz in Chicago to 1930s big band
swing. His orchestra included trumpeter Bunny Berigan, saxman Bud
Freeman, and a teen singer named Frank Sinatra.
 Artie Shaw (1910–2004): Shaw was a top-notch clarinetist who also led
big bands that were among the best of the 1930s. Shaw was a visionary
who experimented with strings and hired rising players. In the 1940s,
Shaw was among the few big band leaders to play bebop (see Chapter
7). Shaw and his band recorded a string of popular hits starting with
“Begin the Beguine” in 1938. In 1954, Shaw quit jazz to focus on his writ-
ing. His books include his first novel I Love You, I Hate You, Drop Dead
and the semi-autobiographical The Trouble With Cinderella. Although
Shaw continued to write, he never enjoyed the success with writing that
he attained with jazz.
The Rise of the Soloist: Instrumentalists
and Vocalists
As we’ve seen, big band swing was a cohesive group effort. In fact, it has been
said that for great leaders like Basie, Ellington, and Goodman, their bands
became their “instruments.” Still, individual artists were able to shine. While
leaders’ names were featured on album covers and theater marquees, top
singers and instrumentalists played featured parts. In big bands, many lead-
ing performers polished technical abilities that would sustain them through
long, prolific careers. Here, you can take a look at some of the individual stars
of great bands.
Turning up the heat: Brilliant improvisers
As new, sophisticated compositions and arrangements shaped the music of
big bands led by Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, and others,
the Golden Era of Swing was also marked by the emergence of some of jazz’s
most gifted soloists. I cover many of them in the following sections.
108
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

The saxophonists
Gifted saxophonists of the era included the following folks:
 Coleman Hawkins (1904–1969): This saxophonist pointed the way
toward modern saxophone with his phenomenal 1939 reinvention of the
song “Body and Soul,” improvising new melodies over the original
chords. His strong, melodic sound was suited to a big band because it
could blend with a saxophone section or stand out during solos.
 Lester Young (1909–1959): He played tenor saxophone with a smooth
and sweet sound. Young (see Figure 6-4) made breakthroughs in music
by varying the length of his phrases so that they overlapped breaks
between key passages in the music.
Like many great soloists of his era, Young was schooled in big bands.
When he was tapped in 1934 to replace Coleman Hawkins in Fletcher
Henderson’s big band, Young lasted only a short while — his light, airy
sound and unconventional phrasing wasn’t accepted by his bandmates.
Although Young is generally known for the music he made during the
1940s, he continued to record excellent albums during the 1950s, when his
style was emulated by cool jazz players like Paul Desmond and Stan Getz.
 Johnny Hodges (1907–1970): Hodges, an alto saxophonist and a
member of Duke Ellington’s orchestra, was one of the first to elevate the
saxophone to a lead instrument. He began on clarinet and studied with
Sidney Bechet. After switching to saxophone, he developed a warm
sound that was perfectly suited to ballads. In addition to his recordings
with Ellington’s big band, Hodges made several fine recordings during
the 1950s with small groups of Ellington band players.
The trumpeters
Important trumpeters of the era included the following players:
 Harry “Sweets” Edison (1915–1999) added bluesy riffs to Basie’s band
from 1938 to 1950.
 Roy Eldridge (1911–1989) invented fleet, technically adept solos with
Elmer Snowden’s band, McKinney’s Cotton Pickers, and Fletcher
Henderson, and was also a driving force in 1940s bebop (which I cover
in Chapter 7).
 Orin “Hot Lips” Page (1908–1954) was a star soloist in Midwest terri-
tory bands led by Walter Page and Bennie Moten. He later played with
Count Basie and Artie Shaw.

The rhythm players: Drummers and bassists
Drummers and bassists who kept the rhythm included the following people:
 Jimmy Blanton (1918–1942): was a member of Ellington’s big band and
who reinvented the role of the bass by combining arco (bowed) and
pizzicato (plucked) techniques to fill a range of musical roles. He carried
melodies and improvised phenomenally, and his duos with Ellington on
piano (such as “Pitter, Patter, Panther”) are considered revelations of the
modern era.
 Jo Jones (1911–1985): Jones made his name in Walter Page’s Blue
Devils, but while in Count Basie’s band, he elevated drumming to new
levels of sophistication. His subtle work on cymbals and use of complex
polyrhythms showed how a drummer could weave his sounds through-
out the music’s textures, instead of merely driving the beat.
 Gene Krupa (1909–1973): Krupa was the catalyst in Benny Goodman’s
big band. He became well known for his wild hair and bass drum bombs.
Krupa and Jo Jones transformed drumming from the basic function per-
formed in New Orleans and Chicago to the complex modern interplay
with a big band’s overlapping rhythms and harmonies found in New York.

 Oscar Pettiford (1922–1960): Pettiford succeeded Blanton as Ellington’s
bassist, and extended Blanton’s ideas while playing a variety of melodic,
harmonic, and improvisational roles (as well as cello).
 Chick Webb (1909–1939): Chick was among the first to tune his drums
and to use wire brushes.
Romancing America: Talented singers
Showmanship, musicianship, and tight, catchy tunes propelled big bands to
popular success. Most of the bands also featured vocalists whose personali-
ties and lyrics gave audiences a friendly way into the music. Some of the
great singers were primarily interpreters and entertainers (crooners); others
used their voices as instruments for innovation and improvisation and
extended Louis Armstrong’s earlier explorations of vocal potential, including
his early scat-singing (see the nearby sidebar for details). The recording ban
of 1942, in a dispute over royalties, didn’t cover vocalists, so many singers
made popular (though not always great) recordings.
Songwriters of the 1930s and 1940s such as George and Ira Gershwin, Cole
Porter, Harold Arlen, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, Jerome Kern, and
Johnny Mercer took jazz in a lighter direction. The singers connected with a
broader audience. Never before had so many talented singers and great
songs existed in the industry at the same time.
111
Chapter 6: The Golden Era of Big Band Swing: The 1930s and Beyond
Plugged in and proud of it: Charlie Christian, 
the first jazz guitarist
After Charlie Christian (1916–1942) plugged in
one of the first electric jazz guitars made by
Gibson, he quickly re-invented the art of jazz
guitar. In Christian’s hands, with a louder voice
that could be heard in a big band, the guitar
stepped out as a solo instrument that traded
licks with saxes and trumpets. In 1939 in Los
Angeles, Benny Goodman reluctantly granted
Christian an audition (after all, there was no
such thing as an electric jazz guitarist or even a
guitarist who wanted to solo like a saxophonist),
and after an awe-inspiring 45-minute solo on
“Rose Room,” Christian was invited to join the
band.
During the three years before he died of tuber-
culosis in New York, Christian created the
single-line style of electric jazz guitar, improvis-
ing melodic strings of notes in a style compara-
ble to that of the major saxophonists. In the
1940s, he was among the few big band swing
musicians to participate in jams at New York
City’s Hickory House that led to the invention of
bebop, which I cover in Chapter 7.

As composers created a songbook of American classics, singers became
interpreters of catchy lyrics and remarkable melodies that have become
“standards” of the jazz repertoire. For most of these singers, the jazz notion
of improvisation came less in the form of radical invention and more in the
form of interpretation — adding your personal signature to the melody with
individual voices and phrasings.
In front of the big bands of the 1930s and 1940s, singers scaled new heights of
popularity and creativity. In the jazz ensembles of the late 1920s, singers sang
an occasional number, but during the swing era, several bands built their suc-
cess around singers in the same way that band leaders such as Duke Ellington
and Count Basie composed and arranged music around their best instrumen-
talists. Check out the prominent male and female singers in the following list:
 Ivie Anderson (1905–1949): As an expressive interpreter and inventive
improviser, Anderson starred as the vocalist in Duke Ellington’s big band
through the mid-1930s. For her ability to carry a song while fitting within
the band, she was one of Ellington’s favorites.
 Mildred Bailey (1907–1951): She was the wife of vibraphonist Red
Norvo and had a delicate voice and solid sense of swing. Bailey is best
known for the music she made during the 1930s with Benny Goodman
and Paul Whiteman.
 Connee Boswell (1907–1976): Boswell was acknowledged by Ella
Fitzgerald as an important source of inspiration. She recorded with Bob
Crosby’s band, and during the 1930s, Connee helped invent multi-part
jazz vocal harmonies as one-third of the Boswell Sisters.
 Bing Crosby (1903–1977): From his roots in Chicago jazz, Crosby
became a pop sensation as a big band crooner with bands led by Paul
Whiteman. With Paul Whiteman (discussed earlier in this chapter)
during the late 1920s, Crosby’s strengths relied on warm personalized
vocals and improvisational scat-singing.
 Doris Day (born 1924) and Rosemary Clooney (1928–2002): They
became famous through their movies, but each held a leading lady role
in the big band era. Day sang sweetly and emotionally with Bob Crosby
and Les Brown’s bands. Clooney’s first hit was the 1951 “Come On-A My
House.” In the 1950s, she recorded several songs with Bing Crosby and
starred alongside him in the popular 1954 holiday classic “White
Christmas” — the kind of ballad that became her strong suit. She also
hosted her own television program in the ’50s.
 Ella Fitzgerald (1917–1996): She became a queen of swing during the
songwriting boom of the 1930s. Her first hit was the 1938 “A-Tisket, A-
Tasket.” When Chick Webb passed away in 1939, Fitzgerald stayed on to
112
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

lead his ensemble through two more years. She brought emotional
depth to beautiful and romantic lyrics, but her earliest vocals have an
innocent charm that sometimes boarders on childish cuteness. Ella was
the 20th century’s greatest and most prolific jazz singer, winning 13
Grammies and selling more than 40 million albums.
Fitzgerald continued her career through the ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s, and
while her voice began fading, some of her music is strong, especially the
1974 Ella in London, re-released on CD.
 Helen Forrest (1917–1999): She possessed smooth, innocent, emotion-
ally transparent vocals with Artie Shaw’s band (where she replaced Billie
Holiday) and with Benny Goodman and Harry James. I’m head over
heels for Helen Forrest!
 Billie Holiday (1915–1959): Her vocals were shaded with the dark emo-
tions of a life troubled by heroin addiction, depression, and racism. Her
best recordings derive from mostly small groups, especially when her
voice teamed with Lester Young’s saxophone. (Check out Young in “The
Rise of the Soloist: Musical Improvisers and Singers” earlier in this chap-
ter.) But Holiday also lent her hypnotic and seductive sound to the
bands of Count Basie, Benny Goodman, and Artie Shaw. Holiday
recorded the haunting song “Strange Fruit” in 1939 — the “fruit” being
black bodies that hung from southern trees after lynchings. This song
was a bold statement from a black performer some 25 years before the
Civil Rights movement.
 Jimmy Rushing (1903–1972): Rushing delivered a blues-infused voice
that fit with the Basie Band’s rootsy, driving brand of jazz. Like Basie,
Rushing’s early experience included a stint with Bennie Moten’s band.
 Sarah Vaughan (1924–1990): Born in Newark, New Jersey, Vaughn had
an abundance of the jazz singer’s essential gifts: a fine voice with a phe-
nomenal range and the ability to spark a song’s lyrics to life with her
personal emotional stamp. Her voice rivaled the voices of the world’s
finest singers, even in opera, and spanned more than four octaves and
was capable of infinite subtleties.
Vaughan also developed a recognizable sound all her own. Her throaty,
smoky low end covers a tenor sax’s territory, but she also handles high
passages with silky sophistication. When you listen to her, notice how
her voice keeps company with a range of instruments. She also makes
subtle use of dynamics (changes in volume) and space (best defined as
the number of instruments playing at once).

Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 
The art of scat-singing
Scat-singing refers to the technique where
vocalists improvise wordless melodies, based on
meaningless syllables and sounds. In the 1920s,
Don Redman (on “My Papa Doesn’t Two Time”
and Louis Armstrong (on “Heebie Jeebies”) pio-
neered experimentation with scat-singing, but
what survived was what would fit within the
three-minute limits of one side of a 78 rpm
record. Ella Fitzgerald developed a sophisticated
scat technique, inspired by the improvisations of
horn players. She invented fast, precise lines,
sometimes related to a song’s melody, other
times departing from it and weaving through the
harmonies. She shaped her sound by bending
notes and adding many types of tonal inflections.
Other singers also advanced the art of scat-
singing. Eddie Jefferson and King Pleasure sang
amazing bebop versions of jazz tunes originally
recorded as instrumentals. In the 1950s, Jon
Hendricks took scat-singing even further, creat-
ing complex multi-voice harmonies in his group
Lambert Hendricks & Ross. Hendricks proved
that singers can make great instrumental music
without any instruments at all.

Bebop to Cool: The 
1940s and 1950s
In This Chapter
 Witnessing the birth of bebop
 Introducing players who made bop be
 Mixing big bands with bebop
 Distinguishing between hard bop and cool jazz
S
tarting in the ’40s, World War II was in full swing, and Americans, includ-
ing musicians, were called to serve their country. The music industry
was slowed by a recording ban imposed by the musicians’ union in a dispute
over artists’ royalties. After sailing through the late 1930s, big band swing
and ballroom dancing began to stall under a newly imposed entertainment
tax. Gasoline rationing made it hard to travel any distance for a night on the
town.
As the ranks of bigger, flashier venues and bands thinned out, a new genera-
tion of young jazz musicians met to jam in small bars and after-hours clubs.
The new creative jolt hit hardest in New York City, with its unusually high
concentration of first-rate players. At clubs likes Minton’s, Monroe’s, the
Royal Roost, Small’s Paradise, and the Three Deuces, the sounds of madly
improvising saxophones and trumpets rose above a rapid-fire foundation of
bass and drums. Soon, the new music was christened bebop, for the two-beat
combinations that often ended musical phrases.
In this chapter, you explore how the inventors of bebop carried jazz into
unmapped territory. You find out how jazz’s new individual stars, the impro-
visers, went about creating their amazing solos. And you discover how 
bebop influenced big bands and branched into two other forms: hard bop
and cool jazz.

Taking Note of Bebop’s Beginnings
Jazz, like any art form, constantly evolves. The current generation matures
and a fresher new generation comes of age. Innovative and vital musical ideas
become mainstream or completely tapped out when players exploit the full
range of possibilities.
In its prime, big band swing, which grew out of New Orleans and Chicago
jazz, became commercial music for dancing and entertainment (see Chapter
6 for details about this form of jazz). Bands such as Duke Ellington’s and
Count Basie’s still had some of their most creative years ahead of them, but
for the most part, by the beginning of World War II, the best musicians looked
for a fresh approach. In the following sections, I cover the factors that led to
the creation of bebop, bebop’s characteristics, and bebop’s importance as a
statement of African-American identity.
Swing loses its vitality and audience
The birth of bebop coincided with World War II, or should I say collided? The
war adversely affected many aspects of the entertainment world:
 The draft removed tens of thousands of American men from swing jazz’s
ballroom scene, as well as from the bands.
 Gas and rubber shortages curtailed road trips — the means by which
many bands made their livings.
 Midnight curfews shut down clubs and ballrooms during their prime
hours.
 An amusement tax as high as 20 percent in some cities raised the cost of
operating venues.
 Racism made it tough for black musicians to tour; they had to stay in
separate hotels, eat in different restaurants, and were excluded from
performing at various venues.
 From 1942 to 1944, the recording ban removed new records as an impor-
tant source of a big band’s income and exposure.
The American Federation of Musicians (AFM) instigated the recording ban 
in a dispute over royalties. The ban applied only to instrumental music. The
AFM ordered its members not to record until major recording companies met
demands that royalties be paid not only for the sale of records but also for
116
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

use of the music by radio stations and on jukeboxes. The process took two
years before all the big recording labels met the demands and recording
resumed. Unfortunately, this lapse meant that most of bebop’s important
early performances were never caught on tape.
Some big bands did survive, however. For instance, Count Basie and Duke
Ellington kept their bands going through the ’40s, ’50s, and ’60s. But for every
band that managed to keep going, several broke up. Even the King of Swing,
Benny Goodman, redirected his energies to performing in small groups instead
of leading a big band. Eventually, too, Woody Herman, Stan Kenton, and other
leaders found ways to bebop with their big bands, as I explain later in this
chapter.
Bebop’s distinct traits emerge
Bebop was revolutionary music that emerged in New York City beginning
around 1940. Whereas big band swing had the faith of the American masses,
bebop went against the grain with its 180-degree shift of priorities.
Some young boppers appreciated the swing of bands led by drummer Chick
Webb or pianist Count Basie but preferred the more innovative music of Duke
Ellington and Artie Shaw’s orchestras. They also studied the music of pianist
Art Tatum and saxophonist Coleman Hawkins who had already explored
advanced harmonies, altered chords, and chord substitution — all hallmarks
of bebop. (I cover all these musicians, and swing in general, in Chapter 6.)
Bebop marked a departure from swing in every essential element. Here are its
characteristics:
 Improvisational: The song’s melody was only stated once at the begin-
ning and end. Improvisers such as Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie
(whom I cover later in this chapter) traded improvisations, replacing the
battling horn sections of big bands.
 Small-group music: Bebop often utilized a rhythm section of bass,
drums, and piano, plus trumpet, and saxophone.
 Speed: Bebop played at break-neck speeds; even on slow ballads, the
solos sped wildly.
 Brash and harsh: To the unskilled ear, the music sounded this way, even
if it was actually carefully structured.
 Complex rhythms: Musicians improvised rhythmic patterns around the
basic beat and around each other.
117
Chapter 7: Bebop to Cool: The 1940s and 1950s

 Rapid series of chords: Instead of being built around just a few chords
as in New Orleans jazz (see Chapter 5) and most big band swing, bebop
used rapid series of chords, many of them altered from their standard
form. Passing chords, inserted between the basic chords, added texture
and complexity.
 Drastically changed role for the instruments: Bop drummers shifted
primary timekeeping duties from bass drum to cymbals and snare, lend-
ing the music a lighter, effervescent aura. They began playing multiple
overlapping rhythms (polyrhythms — see Chapter 3 for details about
this and other elements of jazz theory).
Bebop becomes a statement 
of black identity
For some black musicians, bebop became a statement of black identity, at a
time when the civil rights movement was beginning. The NAACP organized 
its Legal Defense and Education Fund in 1939. Richard Wright’s 1940 novel
Native Son gave a bleak account of conditions for blacks in America. In 1941,
Bernard Rustin, who later organized the March on Washington, launched a
New York branch of the Congress on Racial Equality. In the past, white musi-
cians appropriated the best ideas from black New Orleans and Chicago jazz
(see Chapter 5 for details). White swing bands including Benny Goodman’s
enjoyed commercial success with music that included many ideas and play-
ers taken from African-American big bands. Black bandleader and arranger
Fletcher Henderson even became Goodman’s arranger.
As the black beboppers staked new ground, they risked rejection by their
public, peers, and critics to make music so fast and technically demanding
that it was difficult to understand and nearly impossible to copy. Compared
with the sweet, melodic sounds of big band swing, bebop had little commer-
cial potential.
118
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 
So where did “bebop” come from?
The word bebop may come from the “be-bop”
sound of bop’s improvised lines, especially
when the lines ended with a pair of notes, often
with the accent on the second syllable: be-BOP!
Or it may refer to two syllables used by players
to sing bop phrases. Like other labels applied to
art forms, bebop wasn’t coined by musicians,
but by writers. Throughout the history of jazz,
tension has existed between players who make
creative breakthroughs and critics and scholars
who attempt to define and label the music.
Ultimately, jazz doesn’t fit neatly into categories,
but they are useful in explaining the music.

Surveying Influential Bebop Musicians
Bebop began with saxophonists and trumpeters blowing red hot, speedy
lines that floated above equally fleet rhythm sections. Eventually, bop worked
its way into every format, from soloists to big bands, and was played on
every instrument. Bassists, drummers, guitarists, pianists — they all became
as inventive as horn players. Even vocalists began to bop. No matter what
kind of tone or range a musician had, he could fine ways to produce bebop’s
challenging new mode of improvisational jazz. I cover a variety of influential
bebop musicians in the following sections.
The early beboppers
Although bebop veered sharply away from swing, many of bebop’s inventors
began their careers in big bands; for instance, saxophonist Charlie Parker
started with Earl Hines, and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie started with Cab
Calloway (for more about these big bands, see Chapter 6). Others from the
swing era who participated in the transition to bebop include the following:
 Jimmy Blanton: Blanton’s able hands transformed the bass from a basic
beat keeper into a versatile tool for improvising. He was one of the first
jazz players to use a bow (arco) instead of just plucking the strings
(pizzicato).
 Charlie Christian: He used one of the first electric jazz guitars to play
saxophonelike lines of improvisation.
 Roy Eldridge: Playing an essential part in the history of jazz trumpet,
Eldridge emerged as a leading swing era trumpeter with his own groups
and in bands led by Gene Krupa and Artie Shaw. His solos had the melodic
familiarity of swing, along with bebop’s breathtaking speed and surprising
selection of notes.
 Coleman Hawkins: After ten years with the Fletcher Henderson
Orchestra, Hawkins, a saxophonist, emerged as a leading soloist of the
small group era, spanning the transition from swing to bebop. His 1939
version of “Body and Soul” is considered a landmark performance that
signaled the beginning of bebop. He dispensed almost entirely with the
original melody to improvise one of his own over the original chords.
(See the nearby sidebar “Creating something new from the old” for
details on this technique.)
 Jo Jones: As the timekeeper in Count Basie’s big band Jones expanded
the drummer’s role by using all of his cymbals and drums to create mul-
tiple, overlapping rhythms that contrasted with the rest of the band
instead of merely supporting it.
119
Chapter 7: Bebop to Cool: The 1940s and 1950s

 Davey Tough: As he drummed his way to the top of the heap of Chicago
jazz in the 1930s, Tough also foreshadowed the style of bebop drummers
like Kenny Clarke. Tough played fast and light, and instead of just pound-
ing out the beat, he subtly adjusted his rhythms and sounds to the mood
and movement of the music. He helped make the cymbals and snare
drum — suited to faster tempos — the mainstays of modern drumming
in the bebop era.
 Lester Young: Making his name as featured soloist in the Count Basie
Orchestra, Young’s idiosyncratic phrasing inspired both the boppers
and the cool jazz players of the 1950s. Young’s long, languid lines of
melody and improvisation on the saxophone stretched outside a song’s
structure and chord changes.
Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, 
the leaders of the pack
Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie led bebop’s charge into a new land of
altered harmonies, chords, and extended improvisations. Parker was the
compulsive creative genius, while Gillespie was the methodical one. Parker
and Gillespie came from very different backgrounds and lived individual
lives. But their careers soared as two of bebop’s most influential musicians.
Charlie “Yardbird” Parker
If you ask most music fans to name the single most important jazz musician 
of the 20th century, they might cite Louis Armstrong (see Chapter 5 for more
about him). But if you asked academics, critics, musicians, and jazz buffs, most
of them would single out saxophonist Charlie “Yardbird” Parker (1920–1955),
whose nickname, shortened to “Bird,” came to symbolize the soaring flight of
his music and his genius (although legend says the name came after Parker
suggested he and his bandmates cook up a “yardbird” for dinner, after their 
car ran over the chicken in question).

Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 
Creating something new from the old
The idea of using a popular song’s chords as the
basis for a radical new bebop song, without ref-
erencing the original melody, became common-
place with Charlie Parker and other beboppers.
For example, Parker’s “Koko” was built on
“Cherokee,” his “Donna Lee” on “Indiana,” and
his “Meandering” was a reworking of George
Gershwin’s “Embraceable You.” Beboppers could
utilize beautiful chord changes without paying
royalties, and, because most players learned the
changes to dozens of popular standards, there
was usually common ground for improvising
together.

Parker (see Figure 7-1) grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, after his birth on
August 29, 1920. Missouri also claimed many of the best territory bands (see
Chapter 6) led by Count Basie, Bennie Moten, and others. Parker went to New
York for the first time in 1939, and sat in on jams at Monroe’s Uptown House,
where musicians invented the music that became bebop.

Parker’s hard-edged tone cuts through other instruments. Sometimes his
phrases are long and overlap the chord sequences; other times they’re fast
fragments. Even his speediest, densest solos have logic and structure. His
influences weren’t only his predecessors in jazz but also classical composers
Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, Paul Hindemith, and Edgard Varese. You
can hear their influence in Parker’s unpredictable improvised melodies and
harsh, unconventional harmonies.
John Birks “Dizzy” Gillespie
Born in Cheraw, South Carolina, Dizzy Gillespie (1917–1993) became Charlie
Parker’s alter-ego. Gillespie (see Figure 7-2) was raised in a musical family. His
father was a musician who introduced his nine children to various instruments.
Dizzy started on trombone but switched to trumpet at 15. As a young profes-
sional, he performed in big bands led by Cab Calloway, Benny Carter, Charlie
Barnet, Earl Hines, and Duke Ellington (see Chapter 6 for more about them).

Chapter 7: Bebop to Cool: The 1940s and 1950s

Gillespie’s peers dubbed him “Dizzy” for his madcap antics on and off stage.
He told jokes, made clownish faces, threw an occasional spitball during prac-
tice, and, in the 1950s, began using a trumpet with its bell bent upward as if
sending sound toward the heavens.
©William P. Gottlieb, www.jazzphotos.com
Gillespie’s early influence was trumpeter Roy Eldridge, but by the mid-1940s,
with Parker, Gillespie developed a personal sound distinguished by many
characteristics:
 Dizzying speed
 Dramatic dives from high notes to low
 Alternating clear and slurred notes
 Alternative chords for familiar songs
 New tunes composed over the chords of popular songs
Gillespie wrote some of bebop’s signature songs (including “Hot House,” 
“A Night in Tunisia,” “Groovin’ High,” and “Salt Peanuts”). He was also one of
the first jazz players to add Latin rhythms (through associations with band-
leader Machito, Cuban composer/arranger Mario Bauza, and Cuban percus-
sionist Chano Pozo; see the nearby sidebar “Bebop’s Cuban connections”).

Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

A meeting of two great jazz minds
In 1943 in New York, Parker joined pianist Earl Hines’s big band, which
included Gillespie. The two began practicing together. Gillespie was more
interested in theory and chord patterns (in musicians’ jargon, he added
minor seventh and minor ninth and augmented and diminished chords that
gave the music an unusual sound). Parker was more into melodies and blues-
based improvisations that employed rapid and unusual rhythmic patterns. 
(I cover jazz theory in detail in Chapter 3.)
Unfortunately for jazz history and jazz fans, the recording ban meant that
early bebop wasn’t recorded (see the section “Swing loses its vitality and
importance,” earlier in this chapter).
Together, their connection was electrifying. Gillespie’s trumpet and Parker’s
alto saxophone established bebop’s signature two-horn lead, and together
each produced some of his best music. By 1945, Parker and Gillespie played
New York clubs such as the Three Deuces and the Spotlite, as well as in Los
Angeles.
If you’re eager to hear real bebop right away, get a copy of Bird and Diz At
Carnegie Hall (Roost), recorded in the fall of 1947. This live session is particu-
larly exciting because it includes shouts and murmurs from both the players
and audience as the music picks up steam. Highlights include “A Night In
Tunisia,” “Dizzy Atmosphere,” “Groovin’ High,” “Salt Peanuts,” and “Relaxin’
At Camarillo.”
On tunes such as Gillespie’s “Groovin’ High,” Parker and Gillespie played the
melody in tandem with harmonized lines intertwining. Their uncanny chem-
istry allowed each to play a bold individualistic line that dovetailed perfectly
with the others. Then they launched the music into orbit with their stellar
improvisations. Sometimes one or the other stretched out for several mea-
sures. Other times, they traded short improvised phrases, almost as if they
were having a conversation in hipster jive. There was no time to think.
Together, they had a chemistry that has never been equaled by another 
pair of jazz geniuses.
Bird and Diz move on
After initial sparks between these two masters produced some of jazz’s great-
est recordings, their paths diverged. Parker’s problems with drugs and alco-
hol began to take their toll. He was hospitalized for drug addiction and mood
disorder at Camarillo State Hospital north of Los Angeles for six months in
1946 and 1947. From 1947 to 1950, Parker fronted a variety of groups includ-
ing a highly regarded quintet that featured trumpeter Miles Davis in the role
formerly played by Gillespie. Davis provided a whispery, mellower alternative
to Gillespie’s high-pitched, frenetic sound.
123
Chapter 7: Bebop to Cool: The 1940s and 1950s

Davis only played bop for a short while before he moved on to cool jazz and
hard bop. His subtle, minimalist sound left Parker more room to improvise
than he had with Gillespie.
In addition to a quintet including Davis, Parker recorded and performed with
a variety of bebop’s top players during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Among
the most important of them were
 Drummer Max Roach, along with Kenny Clarke
 Pianist Duke Jordan
 Bassist Tommy Potter
You should have several Parker CDs, including collaborations with Gillespie.
Parker was the most significant soloist from the bebop era. Here are a few
suggestions to get you started:
 Dizzy Gillespie/Charlie Parker: Town Hall, New York City, June 22,
1945 (Uptown): Made during a radio broadcast, these recordings were
recently recovered and represent some of the best early bop played by
Parker and Gillespie.
 Diz and Bird at Carnegie Hall (Blue Note): In 1947, the bebop heroes
gave this excellent performance with a big band.
 Jazz at Massey Hall (OJC): Recorded in Toronto in 1953, the album
catches the dynamic duo with an all-star band performing bebop clas-
sics like “A Night in Tunisia” and “Salt Peanuts.”
 Charlie Parker: A Studio Chronicle 1940–1948 (JSP Records): A ton of
bop for a reasonable price.
 Charlie Parker: The Cole Porter Songbook (Polygram): Bird was
known for flying fast, but this set shows he also had a loving way with a
ballad.
Gillespie, meanwhile, pursued his ambition to lead a big band that would com-
bine bebop with Latin elements. This area became his focus during the late
1940s, when he played and recorded with Latin masters such as percussionist
Chano Pozo. Unlike Parker, who died prematurely, Gillespie enjoyed a long and
productive career, and mentored many generations of musicians. One of them
was his disciple, Cuban trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, whom Gillespie helped
bring to the U.S. In his later years, Gillespie traveled with his famous all-star
United Nations Orchestra, which combined great music with spreading a mes-
sage of world peace and multicultural harmony.
124
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Your collection should include at least a handful of Gillespie CDs. Here are a
few suggestions:
 Dizzy’s Big Four (OJC): Dizzy hooks up with three great players includ-
ing bassist Ray Brown (see Chapter 6) for a rousing session that shows a
range of moods and tones, including splashes of Latin flavors.
 Odyssey: 1945–1952 (Savoy): Ride along as Dizzy evolves from frantic
bebopper to seasoned master.
 The Dizzy Gillespie Story: 1939–1950 (Proper): Three discs of Dizzy’s
best bop, from the prime Parker years, as well as with Cab Calloway,
Lionel Hampton, and other collaborators.
 Sonny Side Up (Polygram): Dizzy goes to town with two great saxphon-
ist Sonnys: Rollins and Stitt.
Thelonious Monk, the quirky genius
Fragmented chords and off-kilter melodies lend Thelonious Monk’s playing a
strange charm. Unusual harmonies and melodies and teetering tempos are
Monk’s distinguishing traits as a bebopper who bent jazz beyond the rules 
of swing. Combining wild imagination with a dark sense of humor, Monk
(1917–1982) has the most recognizable style of any jazz pianist. Embedded
within his version of the Cole Porter song “Sweet and Lovely,” for instance, 
is “Tea For Two,” and he often reworked older tunes into new ones, such as
the popular song “I Got Rhythm” became Monk’s “Rhythm-a-Ning.”
125
Chapter 7: Bebop to Cool: The 1940s and 1950s
Bebop’s Cuban connections
Jelly Roll Morton talked about the “Latin tinge” in
his music, but Dizzy Gillespie was the first jazz
musician to give Latin rhythms — Afro-Cuban, to
be exact — a major role in his music. In the 1940s,
Gillespie collaborated with three famous Cubans:
composer Mario Bauza, conga drummer Chano
Pozo, and bandleader Machito. Through the rest
of his career, Gillespie employed a variety of Afro-
Cuban rhythmic combinations on his recordings
and in his live performances. Meanwhile, Latin
jazz musicians like Machito led bebop bands of
their own (see Chapter 9). There was a healthy
give-and-take between jazz musicians such as
Gillespie who began using Latin rhythms and
Latin musicians who took inspiration from bebop.
In the 1950s, vibraphonist Cal Tjader was an
innovator in combining Latin and jazz elements.
Trumpeter Kenny Dorham, pianist Horace Silver,
and pianist George Shearing employed Afro-
Cuban elements in a serious way in the 1950s. Of
course, Latin musicians made some of the most
important contributions. For more on Latin jazz,
see Chapter 9.

Whether making his own music or reworking classic jazz tunes such as “All
the Things You Are” and “I Should Care,” Monk (see Figure 7-3) communi-
cated oceans of emotion with only a few notes. Other bop pianists played
fast, using a lot of notes, but Monk selected the minimum number of notes to
convey a melody and a feeling. His left hand mixes spare chords and single
bass notes, while his right renders a written or improvised melody. Witness
his playing on The Complete Blue Note Recordings (Blue Note), a must-have
collection of Monk’s finest music that includes the great standards mentioned
above and many more, as well as several original Monk compositions like
“Misterioso” and “Well, You Needn’t.”

Vocalists who bopped
The art of scat singing — improvising melodies with nonsense sounds and
syllables — reached new creative highs in bebop. The King and Queen of this
vocal art were Jon Hendricks and Ella Fitzgerald. By freeing their voices from
lyrics, bebop vocalists used their voices like trumpets or saxophones to
improvise.
Figure 7-3:
Thelonious
Monk’s

unmistak-
able.
126
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Hendricks led the innovative late-1950s vocal trio Lambert, Hendricks & Ross
(with arranger Dave Lambert and Annie Ross), which took scat singing and
vocal harmony into new, complex three-part territory, with performances
such as their bebop-speed of “Cloudburst” and “Summertime,” where they
sing a melody improvised by trumpeter Miles Davis in his earlier version of
the tune. (The technique of re-creating an instrumental solo with voice is called
“vocalese,” and this trio sang new versions of dozens of bebop solos.)
Fitzgerald (see Figure 7-4) was a master of her instrument — her voice. She
approached singing like an instrumentalist with her 1920s performance of 
“A-Tisket, A-Tasket” with Chick Webb’s big band. Whether on “Cotton Tail”
with Duke Ellington’s big band, or trading licks with instrumentalists such 
as trumpeter Roy Eldridge, Fitzgerald demonstrated how a singer could use
her voice to improvise. (See Chapter 6 for more about her.)

Bebop’s other prime players
Dozens of musicians played excellent bebop during the 1940s. Here are some
of the other artists who energized the music during its formative years.

Chapter 7: Bebop to Cool: The 1940s and 1950s

Barney Kessel
A leading cool, swing, and bebop guitar man, Kessel (1923–2004) recorded
with Charlie Parker (on the Dial sessions, covered earlier in the chapter) and
played alongside Parker at producer Norman Granz’s legendary Jazz at the
Philharmonic concerts. Kessel went on to make eclectic music of his own,
often with bop leanings.
Catch Kessel on Complete Charlie Parker on Dial (Jazz Classics). Some of his
best music as a leader is on To Swing Or Not To Swing (Original Jazz Classics).
Fats Navarro
Fats Navarro (1923–1950), a young bop trumpeter inspired by both Charlie
Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, lived a short life but made a big impact. He
recorded more than 150 songs, many with groups other than his own.
Among his personal best pieces are Nostalgia (Savoy) and the two-CD
Complete Blue Note and Capitol Recordings of Fats Navarro and Tadd Dameron
(Blue Note).
Oscar Pettiford
Pettiford (1922–1960) ranks among the top three innovators on bass, coaxing
an array of sounds from his instrument with both pizzicato (plucked) and
arco (bowed) techniques. Good examples of Pettiford’s gift are on Oscar
Pettiford Sextet (Discovery).
Bud Powell
Bud Powell (1924–1966) came closer to than any pianist at equaling on his
instrument the bebop that Charlie Parker played on alto saxophone. Powell
was a vital force in bop’s invention as one of a handful of regular pianists who
frequented New York City’s 52nd Street scene during the mid-’40s. He was a
fast, fluid, clever player who meshed well with Charlie Parker and trumpeter
Dizzy Gillespie.
Max Roach
Max Roach (born 1924) was a mainstay of 1940s bebop and hard bop (which 
I cover later in this chapter). Early on, Roach was one of the leading bebop
drummers. Instead of just staying in the background and keeping time, Roach
listened closely to bop’s fast improvisers and invented drum parts that
responded to them. Unlike instrumentalists, drummers don’t have several
notes to choose from, but Roach used the various tones of his drums and
cymbals to create musical combinations. He also changed the way a drum-
mer keeps basic time, shifting the emphasis from bass drum to cymbals.
128
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Roach recorded dozens of albums with Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Charles
Mingus, Bud Powell, and Sonny Rollins. Later, he was one of the few bebop-
pers to play free jazz with saxophonist Anthony Braxton and pianist Cecil
Taylor (see Chapter 8). Formally trained in music, Roach was among the few
drummers to write his own extended compositions, such as the “Freedom
Now Suite,” inspired by black struggle for equality.
Roach conveyed a sense of jazz’s African roots — the group improvisation,
shifting and overlapping rhythms, and a spiritual dimension. He helped make
drummers an equal partner in group collaboration. Roach is one of the few
drummers with several CDs under his own name. Among the best of his
recordings are Deeds Not Words (OJC), Percussion Bitter Sweet (GRP), and
Brown and Roach, Inc. (Polygram).
Sonny Stitt
One of my favorite saxophonists is Sonny Stitt (1924–1982). Stitt played alto
and tenor saxophones. On alto, he had a sharp, cutting sound reminiscent of
Charlie Parker’s. On tenor, however, his sound was softer and gentler and
more original. Stitt made his first recordings in the 1940s, during bebop’s
prime. He went on to make more than 100 albums in a career that lasted
through the 1960s.
Stitt’s improvisations sparkle with freshness and energy, and his technique 
is flawless. You must hear Kaleidoscope (Original Jazz Classics), as well as
Sonny Stitt 1950–1951 (Melodie Jazz Classic).
Combining Bebop and Big Bands
World War II’s end in 1945 and the advent of bebop brought major changes 
to the sound of big bands. Among the draft, which took musicians and fans
away from the music, the recording ban, which kept new jazz away from the
public, and a cabaret tax that forced some clubs to close, the national jazz
scene was ready for revival.
Big bands led by Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman (see Chapter 6 for
details on those guys) remained popular among fans of swing, but other 
big-band leaders took a new approach.
 Woody Herman (1913–1987): Clarinetist and saxophonist Woody
Herman led the Woody Herman Orchestra — one of the most popular
swing bands of the early 1940s. In 1946 he organized the first bop-
oriented big band, The Herd (over the years, he led a series of three 
different Herds). Herman’s Herds combined driving rhythms with great
arrangements and tight solos.
129
Chapter 7: Bebop to Cool: The 1940s and 1950s

 Stan Kenton (1911–1979): Kenton was one of jazz’s most popular and
controversial figures of the 1940s, ’50s, and ’60s. Scorned by swing and
bop purists for playing dissonant, unconventional pieces, Kenton used
as many as 24 players (compared with 17 in a conventional big band).
Today, he is regarded as one of the most important modern bandleaders.
Kenton augmented his big band with extra brass, violins, or percussion,
and he built a reputation for offbeat compositions, provocative arrange-
ments, and great soloists.
 Claude Thornhill (1909–1969): Emerging as the leader of Claude
Thornhill and His Orchestra during the late 1940s, Thornhill was a
pianist and arranger whose orchestral recordings combined his love of
bebop and classical music. As compared with the big, brassy sound of
some big bands, Thornhill’s trademark was an understated sound with
arrangements that had his orchestra playing chords with the notes
spread among various sections. Thornhill’s use of french horn, bass clar-
inet, and tuba during the 1940s inspired Miles Davis’s 1949 Birth of the
Cool (Capitol), with arrangements by Thornhill’s protégé, Gil Evans.
To sample Thornhill’s unusual hybrid music, get a copy of Snowfall (ASV
Living Era). The music ranges from “Hungarian Dance No. 5” and “Arab
Dance” (from The Nutcracker) to bebop tunes like Charlie Parker’s
“Donna Lee.”
Branching Off Bebop into 
Hard Bop and Cool Jazz
Jazz headed in new directions during the 1950s, with hard bop refining ele-
ments of bebop and cool jazz offering a minimalist alternative.
 Hard bop, developed primarily in New York City, was a bluesy, driving,
stripped-down variant of bebop, made mostly by black musicians.
 Cool jazz was lighter, lyrical, intricately arranged, sometimes influenced
by classical music.
I cover both of these offshoots of bebop in the following sections. I also dis-
cuss an important musician who crossed between hard bop and cool jazz:
Miles Davis.
New York and hard bop
Some hard boppers were graduates of 1940s bebop, including drummer Art
Blakey and tenor saxophonists Sonny Rollins and Dexter Gordon. Others
were relative newcomers searching for new sounds. The new generation
130
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

included players from outside New York City, especially from Detroit and
Philadelphia.
Hard bop isn’t as fast or frantic as bebop. It had a dark, gritty aura that
seemed to suit New York in the 1950s. Hard bop is distinguished by a few key
characteristics:
 Intense, swinging momentum rooted in gospel and blues, at slower
tempos than bebop.
 New compositions that were more elaborate and technically demanding
(in terms of group precision) than bebop.
 Intuitive, subtle interplay between players in bands where the group
dynamic was as important as the solos.
Like bebop, hard bop was distinguished by its soloists’ distinctive voices.
Here are some of the many players who made important contributions.
Cannonball Adderley
A physical and creative giant of hard bop, alto saxophonist Adderley
(1928–1975) produced a long line of solid recordings during the 1950s and
’60s. Adderley improvised not only with speed and unpredictability, but also
with a sweet tone and a melodic approach. A milestone in Adderley’s career
came when he joined the Miles Davis All Star Sextet in the late 1950s, where
Adderley’s alto saxophone played counterpoint to John Coltrane’s tenor on
Davis’s famous Kind of Blue album.
The following Cannonball CDs are a few of my favorites:
 Cannonball Adderley Quintet in Chicago with John Coltrane
(Polygram): Two great saxophonists team up for a stirring session.
 Cannonball Adderley Quintet in San Francisco (Riverside): A great
live recording with Cannonball’s brother Nat on trumpet.
 Cannonball’s Bossa Nova (Blue Note): The saxophonist’s take on the
Brazilian craze that swept America during the early 1960s.
Art Blakey
Art Blakey (1919–1990) was one of the first drummers to tune his drums so
that his playing made a melodic contribution. Blakey shifted from bass drum
up to snare and cymbals, providing a looser, more fluid sound.
In the 1940s, Blakey played with Charlie Parker and other beboppers, but in
the 1950s he became the most prolific bandleader of the hard bop era.
131
Chapter 7: Bebop to Cool: The 1940s and 1950s

With pianist Horace Silver, Blakey founded the Jazz Messengers in 1953, and
after Silver left the following year, Blakey led the band through four decades
of innovative jazz. Blakey’s Messengers served as a type of grad school for
aspiring players like Wayne Shorter, Freddie Hubbard, and brothers Wynton
(trumpet) and Branford (saxophone) Marsalis. See Chapter 8 for more about
Shorter and Hubbard, and Chapter 10 for more about the Marsalis brothers.
Clifford Brown
By the age of 26, Brown (1930–1956) had already created some of hard bop’s
most significant music — a series of recordings highlighted by the recordings
he made with the Clifford Brown-Max Roach Quintet. Brown’s bright, bluesy
sound and beautiful phrasing made him one of the most distinctive trumpeters
of his time. Considering his youth, Brown played with surprising maturity. He
didn’t overplay to show off his technique, and he adapted well to musical con-
texts, whether driving a hard bop band, or playing a more subdued role in 
collaborations with singers Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington.
Dexter Gordon
Known as “Long Tall Dex,” Gordon (1923–1990) stood 6-foot 5-inches tall and
played tenor saxophone with a subtle, smooth sound that combined some of
Charlie Parker’s speed and inventiveness with Lester Young’s laid-back, lyri-
cal approach.
Gordon was part of the core group of bebop players in the 1940s, and was
one of the few who spent significant time in both New York City and Los
Angeles. He forged a link between gritty East Coast jazz and milder West
Coast jazz. During the 1950s, Gordon’s sound evolved into bluesy, hard bop,
but drug problems cut into his creativity during the 1950s, but he came back
strong in the 1960s and 1970s.
In his prime, Gordon played saxophone like he spoke: soft, mellow, whispery,
and with carefully chosen phrases. Some of his best music can be heard on
these CDs:
 Dexter Gordon: Ballads (Blue Note): Beautiful renditions of romantic
tunes such as “Body and Soul” and “Willow Weep for Me.”
 Go (Blue Note): A laid-back, bluesy set that was one of Gordon’s favorite
recordings, showcasing the saxophonist’s big, warm tone.
J.J. Johnson
Johnson (born 1924) was hard bop’s best trombonist during the 1950s, com-
posing, arranging, and playing music with a bluesy, hard bop feel, utilizing
unconventional instrumentations and harmonies. He was a driving force in
1940s bebop as one of the few trombonists who could keep up with Dizzy
Gillespie and Charlie Parker.
132
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Johnson recorded with fellow trombonist Kai Winding (the sound of two
trombones as lead voices takes some getting use to because they’re rarely
heard as a duo in jazz or any other music). He made several albums with his
own groups: Get Mad Bebop (Savoy), Early Bones (Prestige), and The Eminent
Jay Jay Johnson, Vols. 1 and 2 (EMD/Blue Note).
Jackie McLean
McLean (1932–2006) wailed a gritty alto saxophone in 1950s hard bop and
was one of Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers from 1956 to 1958, following stints
with Miles Davis and Charles Mingus. McLean went through a free-jazz phase
during the 1960s (see Chapter 8 for free jazz info), before returning to his
hard bop roots.
McLean made excellent albums on Blue Note including Swing, Swang,
Swingin’; Tippin’ the Scales; and Bluesnik. McLean continues to make 
solid music that features his biting, probing sound, including his 2005 
CD Consequence.
Charles Mingus
Mingus (1922–1978) played 1940s bebop with raw power and exhibited an
unconventional genius of standup bass and masterfully composed with ambi-
tious ideas. He went on to explore an array of styles including hard bop.
Mingus spent his formative years in Los Angeles — part of the jazz scene that
also included his good friend Buddy Collette. Mingus was a Renaissance man
whose talents reached beyond jazz: He arranged, composed, led a band,
played bass, and wrote a book (Beneath the Underdog) — Mingus’ colorful
account of a life in jazz. I cover Mingus in more detail in Chapter 8.
Hank Mobley
Mobley (1930–1986), a tenor saxophonist whose style was deeply rooted in
rhythm and blues, became one of the most soulful of 1950s hard boppers. On
his 25 or so albums, you can hear a sound somewhere between the tough-
ness of Sonny Rollins and the gentleness of Lester Young.
The best of his 1950s output includes No Room for Squares (EMD/Blue Note)
and Workout (Blue Note).
James Moody
Moody (born 1925) is the master of reeds — alto, tenor, and soprano saxes,
and flute, as well as an entertaining vocalists whose live shows often include
his signature song “Moody’s Mood for Love,” with its charmingly silly lyrics.
133
Chapter 7: Bebop to Cool: The 1940s and 1950s

Some of Moody’s early bop solos can be heard on the 1948 album Dizzy
Gillespie and His Big Band (GNP). Among Moody’s own albums, look for Hi-Fi
Party (Original Jazz Classics), Last Train from Overbrook (Argo), Never Again
(Muse), Young at Heart (WEA/Warner), and Moody Plays Mancini (WEA/Warner).
Moody’s 2004 CD Homage (Savoy Jazz) proves that he’s one of jazz’s survivors.
Sonny Rollins
On tenor saxophone, Rollins, who cites Coleman Hawkins as a primary influ-
ence (check out Chapter 6 for details on Hawkins), played some of the most
vital hard bop of the 1950s and 1960s.
Rollins’ method of improvisation included a “thematic” approach, wherein he
took pieces of a song’s melody and cycled them through several variations.
As of 2006, Rollins (born 1930) is one of the last living legends from the bebop
and hard bop eras. Take a listen to his CDs Saxophone Colossus (OJC), Tenor
Madness (OJC), and Way Out West (OJC).
Horace Silver
Horace Silver (born 1928) co-founded the Jazz Messengers, the leading hard
bop band, with drummer Art Blakey.
He was a central figure in hard bop, playing in a bluesy style driven by rhyth-
mic left-hand chord patterns and lyrical right-hand improvisations. He is also
a prolific arranger/composer and was among the first jazz players to bring
soul and funk flavors into the music.
Los Angeles and West Coast cool
Jazz recording and publishing have been based mostly in New York City (and,
to a lesser extent, Chicago) since the 1930s and ’40s, with the West Coast
viewed as a smaller, secondary scene. In fact, Los Angeles has a rich history
of hosting jazz and jazz musicians, dating back to visits by Jelly Roll Morton,
King Oliver, and Kid Ory during jazz’s formative years (see Chapter 5 for
details on these musicians).
In the 1940s and ’50s, Los Angeles had a vibrant jazz scene along Central
Avenue and in other neighborhoods. The scene included black hard bop
clubs like Billy Berg’s, the Finale, and Shepp’s Playhouse — all places where
Charlie Parker and other East Coast greats performed, as well as locals like
Sonny Criss, Teddy Edwards, Dexter Gordon, Wardell Gray, and Frank

Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

But the movement that made the West Coast famous was cool jazz. Here are
some of the elements that give the music its special sounds:
 Light, lyrical sound
 Gentler, flowing rhythms, as opposed to the driving rhythms of hard bop
 Whispery saxophones and muted trumpets
 Compositions and arrangements that incorporated the influence of clas-
sical composers like Stravinsky and Debussy
 Brazilian styles (such as samba and bossa nova) in music by saxophon-
ist Stan Getz and others
 Odd meters (instead of the familiar four-beats-per measure), especially
in Dave Brubeck songs like “Take Five” and “Blue Rondo á la Turk”
 Instruments not normally associated with jazz, such as French horn,
oboe, bassoon, and bass clarinet, especially in larger ensembles
By the 1950s, the West Coast became an important jazz center — not only 
for the Los Angeles scene but also because of San Francisco Bay Area clubs.
In L.A., Howard Rumsey’s Lighthouse became the hub for cool jazz. San
Francisco had clubs like the Blackhawk and Bay Area musicians like Dave
Brubeck, who single-handedly put cool jazz on the nation’s radar (for more
on San Francisco jazz, see the sidebar “Northern cool: The San Francisco 
Bay Area”).
Although cool jazz, like hard bop, relied upon tight, intuitive interplay
between band members, the music was also marked by amazing individuals
and solos. Let’s look at some heroes of cool jazz.
Chet Baker
Trumpeter Baker (1929–1988) was a leading creative force in California cool
jazz. He was known for a whispery, Miles Davis–like tone. Over the course of
his career, he played with Charlie Parker, as well as with several major cool
schoolers including saxophonists Gerry Mulligan, Jimmy Giuffre, and Stan
Getz; pianist Bill Evans; and drummer Shelly Manne. Baker was also an excel-
lent singer.
The movie “Let’s Get Lost” is a dark documentary about the later part of
Baker’s life. The CD My Funny Valentine (Blue Note) includes some of Baker’s
best playing.

Chapter 7: Bebop to Cool: The 1940s and 1950s

Dave Brubeck
Beginning in the 1950s, pianist Dave Brubeck (born 1920) offered a brainy
alternative to mellow cool jazz and driving hard bop. Brubeck studied with
modernist classical composer Darius Milhaud, and performed classical music
influences in his jazz. Some of Brubeck’s improvised music leans toward clas-
sical, with dark, graceful chord changes and melodies so carefully crafted
they sound as if they are composed.
Brubeck made the cover of Time magazine in 1954, and his recording of Take
Five, written by and co-starring saxophonist Paul Desmond, is probably the
best known jazz tune ever. Brubeck also composes religious music, and he’s
one of the few players to fuse jazz with classical strings in a successful way,
as heard on Brubeck Plays Bernstein (Sony).
Bill Evans
For pure emotional power, it’s hard to beat Bill Evans (1912–1980), a member
of Miles Davis’s late ’50s sextet that also included saxophonists John Coltrane
(see Chapter 8 for more about him) and Cannonball Adderley. Like Dave
Brubeck, Evans created music that fused classical music with jazz. As with
Brubeck, you can hear the classical influence in beautifully composed or
improvised melodies and harmonies. Sadly, some of the same, dark emotions
that fed Evans’ music also led him into drug abuse, which ended his life 
prematurely.

Northern cool: The San Francisco Bay Area
Although some top Bay Area jazz players moved
to New York to seek their fortunes, Dave Brubeck,
who was born in the Bay Area city of Concord,
stayed home and became a national phenome-
non. San Francisco’s cool jazz benefited from its
association with the emerging Beat scene, cen-
tered on North Beach cafes and bookstores like
City Lights and poets like Lawrence Ferlinghetti,
Allan Ginsburg, and Michael McClure. The scene
was fictionalized in Jack Kerouac’s classical Beat
novel On the Road.
Through the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Bay
Area scene was dominated by traditional jazz
revival bands like Lu Watters Yerba Buena Jazz
Band. Area clubs included the famous Blackhawk
in San Francisco, where several musicians includ-
ing Miles Davis recorded live albums. The
Blackhawk was a showcase for both New
Yorkers like Davis and locals like Brubeck, his col-
laborator, saxophonist Paul Desmond, and vibra-
phonist Cal Tjader (for more on Tjader and his
special brand of Latin jazz, see Chapter 9).
Although San Francisco never equaled Chicago,
Los Angeles, New Orleans, or New York with
the size of its scene, the Bay Area produced
artists like Brubeck and Tjader who made sig-
nature contributions to the West Coast sound.

Evans’ best recordings include his second album, from 1958, Everybody 
Digs Bill Evans (OJC), as well as his 1961 Sunday at the Village Vanguard
(Riverside), and Undercurrent (Blue Note), a duet with guitarist Jim Hall.
Gil Evans
The most famous arranger of cool jazz, Evans (1912–1988) helped artists
scale new heights of creativity by placing them in carefully orchestrated con-
texts that both showcased their genius and added complex shadings. For
trumpeter Miles Davis, Evans (with Gerry Mulligan) did the arrangements for
the landmark Birth of the Cool (Blue Note) album (see the section on Davis
below), and also arranged music for Davis’s Miles Ahead (Sony), Porgy and
Bess (Sony), and the Sketches of Spain (Sony).
Stan Getz
Getz (1927–1991) was a tenor saxophonist with a lush, gentle sound inspired
by Lester Young. Stan Getz made some of the best jazz of the 1950s, combin-
ing gritty hard bop with mellower cool jazz. In the early 1960s, his collabora-
tions with Brazilians like Antonio Carlos Jobim and Joao Gilberto sparked
America’s Bossa Nova craze, including the hit song “Girl from Ipanema.”
Check out Chapter 9 for more about Jobim and Gilberto.
Jimmy Giuffre
Giuffre (born 1921) was one of the most innovative West Coast jazzmen,
equally adept on clarinet and saxophone. After stints in several 1940s big
bands, Giuffre recorded some fine music in experimental groups such as his
trio with trombonist Bob Brookmeyer and guitarist Jim Hall — the group
lacked jazz’s traditional piano, bass, and drums.
Chico Hamilton
Vastly underappreciated, Hamilton (born 1921) was a versatile drummer who
played in small and large groups — some with unconventional lineups. The
Chico Hamilton Quintet, for instance, featured drums, saxophone, guitar,
bass, and cello (you can catch Hamilton and his group performing in a night
club scene in the 1958 film The Sweet Smell of Success). Hamilton demon-
strated his range by performing with old schoolers such as Count Basie and
Lester Young, as well as avant garde innovators like saxophonist Arthur
Blythe, and electric jazz pioneers such as guitarist Larry Coryell. (See
Chapter 8 for more about avant garde and jazz fusion.)
Lee Konitz
Another member of trumpeter Miles Davis’s Birth of the Cool (Capitol) crew
was alto and soprano saxophonist Lee Konitz (born 1927). His collaborators
also included other 1950s cool jazz colleagues such as saxophonists Warne
Marsh, Gerry Mulligan, and Jimmy Giuffre; and pianist Lennie Tristano. Konitz
was known for his understated playing.
137
Chapter 7: Bebop to Cool: The 1940s and 1950s

Shelly Manne
The best of the California cool drummers during the 1950s and 1960s was
Manne (1920–1984) who used his influence as a bandleader and owned the
famous Shelly’s Manne-Hole jazz club. Manne had enough technique and
showmanship to become the centerpiece of a band, but he also used his sen-
sitivity to create empathetic background rhythms for great soloists. He was
equally important as a drummer who could propel a small or large band and
perform flamboyant solos.
The Modern Jazz Quartet
Although not based on the West Coast, the Modern Jazz Quartet (MJQ)
played brainy, cool jazz with heavy classical leanings. In essence, the Quartet
was a traveling jazz chamber ensemble, in which classically trained pianist
John Lewis used intricate compositions and arrangements to take jazz in
directions as formal as classical music. Their prime years were the 1950s and
early 1960s, but they regrouped in the 1980s (See Chapter 8 for more about
this band).
Gerry Mulligan
Probably no one in jazz has done more with a baritone saxophone. Born in
New York, Mulligan (1927–1996) became a founding father of cool jazz,
through his participation in Miles Davis’s Birth of the Cool (Capitol): he
played and contributed several arrangements (although Gil Evans is mistak-
enly thought to have arranged the whole album).
By playing minimal melodic lines on baritone, Mulligan added a deep, dreamy
mood to cool jazz, as well as to sessions with swing-era stars including saxo-
phonist Ben Webster, and bebop pianist Thelonious Monk.
Art Pepper
Dark currents in Pepper’s cool, sometimes fragmented bop mirrored the ups
and downs of a tough life that included drug addition. Art Pepper (1925–1982)
was a California native and part of L.A.’s vital 1940s and 1950s scene. He
played in orchestras led by Benny Carter (I cover him in Chapter 6) and Stan
Kenton.
Shorty Rogers
Rogers (1924–1994) played a vital part in the Los Angeles cool jazz scene.
Shorty Rogers and His Giants (their CD has the same name) had a changing
lineup that sometimes expanded to nine players and showcased Rogers’
trumpet as well as his skill as an arranger. Roger composed cool-jazz scores
for the films The Wild One (with Marlon Brando) and The Man with the Golden
Arm (with Frank Sinatra).

Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Howard Rumsey’s Lighthouse All-Stars
Drummer Howard Rumsey (born 1917) launched his career during the 1940s
with Stan Kenton’s orchestra. After bouncing through various bands, he
landed as leader of the house band at the Lighthouse Cafe in Hermosa Beach
in Southern California.
Rumsey’s Lighthouse All-Stars served as a vital training ground for a crew of
important California cool players: trombonist Frank Rosolino; trumpeters
Conte Candoli, Stu Williamson, and Shorty Rogers; multi-reedmen Bob Cooper,
Bud Shank, Jimmy Giuffre, and Buddy Collette; pianists Claude Williamson,
Sonny Clark, and Hampton Hawes; and drummers Shelly Manne and Stan Levy.
Several CDs chronicle the music, including the three-volume Howard Rumsey’s
Lighthouse All-Stars (OJC).
George Shearing
Ranging from swing to Latin, bebop, cool, and classical, Shearing’s piano
playing is complex, subtle, and spectacular. Shearing’s late 1940s quintet fea-
tured great interplay between his piano and Marjorie Hyams’ vibes (Hyams
was one of jazz’s top players at the time but shortly retired to raise a family).
Hear Shearing (born 1919) on The London Years/1939–1943 (Hep), Lullaby 
of Birdland (Verve), Blues Alley and Jazz (Concord), and My Favorite Things
(Telarc).
Lennie Tristano
Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane are the famous figureheads of jazz’s
avant garde (see Chapter 8 for avant garde details), but in 1949, on the songs
“Intuition” and “Digression” — found on Crosscurrents (Capitol) — Tristano
(1919–1978) pointed the way toward 1950s cool jazz and ’60s free jazz.
Tristano’s sound included complicated changes in time signature (number of
beats per measure), dense harmonies, exotic melodies, dissonance between
his own piano parts and between other instruments, and a variety of seem-
ingly disparate sounds brought together.
Tristano’s collective improvisations with Lee Konitz and other cool jazz peers
were forerunners of collective jazz in the late 1960s, and his overdubbed
piano parts on the album Requiem (Atlantic), were also well in advance of the
rise of technology and computers in the studio. Tristano studied classical
music at the American Conservatory in Chicago before dedicating himself to
jazz, and you can hear the influence of composers including Stravinsky in
Tristano’s complicated, moody harmonies.
139
Chapter 7: Bebop to Cool: The 1940s and 1950s

Tristano’s 1949 album Crosscurrents (Capitol) is a landmark of improvised jazz
that sounds like it could’ve been recorded ten years later. Although the music
was almost entirely invented on the spot, it has logic, and it moves seam-
lessly through many moods.
Kai Winding
Kai Winding (1922–1983) is perhaps best known as J.J. Johnson’s cool jazz
counterpart on their shared recording dates (I discuss J.J. Johnson earlier 
in this chapter). Captivated by bebop, Winding had a major impact on Stan
Kenton’s orchestra with his unusual vibrato. Winding played on trumpeter
Miles Davis’s landmark Birth of the Cool (Capitol), and he frequently collabo-
rated with J.J. Johnson during the mid-’50s. Kai Winding Solo (Verve) catches
the trombonist in his prime.
Miles Davis and the best of both worlds
Miles Davis (1926–1991) was born in Alton, Illinois, and his lengthy career
spanned bebop, cool jazz, hard bop, fusion, and funk. Davis (see Figure 7-5)
began playing at age 9, entered Juilliard at 18, but soon dropped out to join
New York City’s emerging bebop scene. In the mid-1940s, Davis’s laid-back,
slurry sound made an interesting match with bebop pioneer Charlie Parker’s
manic saxophone. But Davis soon transformed his sound to the whispery,
minimalist style that became his trademark.
Davis was a visionary leader who brought out some of the best performances
by several dozen of jazz’s finest players, and who launched them on their
careers. Cannonball Adderley, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock,
Horace Silver, and Wayne Shorter are but a few of the musicians who per-
formed in Davis’s bands over the years. (See Chapter 8 for more about
Coltrane, Hancock, and Shorter.)
In 1949, Davis helped invent the cool sound with his Birth of the Cool (Capitol)
album, music played by a nine-piece ensemble, with arrangements by Gil
Evans and saxophonist Gerry Mulligan. Whether playing hard bop, cool jazz,
or later styles, Davis knew that space was as important as sound.
Davis’s mid-’50s quintet made a string of albums with one-word titles like
Cookin’, Workin’, Steamin’, and Relaxin’ (all available on Original Jazz
Classics) that exemplified dark, moody hard bop. Davis’s most famous album,
probably included in more jazz collections than any other, is the 1959 Kind 
of Blue (Sony), which includes the legendary John Coltrane on saxophone.
(I’m also a fan of Davis’s electric jazz, covered in Chapter 8).

Some purists feel that Davis sold out by going electric during the mid-’60s,
and by blending jazz with other music. To me, music from all his phases has
stood the test of time. In Chapter 8, I cover Davis’s electric phase in detail.

A Radical Departure: 
The 1960s and 1970s
In This Chapter
 Experimenting with the avant garde
 Feeling liberated with free jazz
 Recognizing how jazz reflected the sixties
 Focusing on electric fusions
W
hen the black-and-white ’50s faded into the Technicolor ’60s, jazz
exploded in radical directions that indicated the social and political
changes ahead. But the past wasn’t entirely abandoned. As new music devel-
oped, older forms of jazz came along. Giants from jazz’s Golden Age of the
’30s still made vital music (see Chapter 6 for details on this era), and hard
bop players from the ’50s played bluesy, hard-driving jazz for three more
decades (Chapter 7 has the scoop on bebop). But as in earlier eras, a new
generation once again arrived to lead jazz in new directions. Those paths
ranged from free improvisation to mergers of jazz with classical and world
music and the adoption of electric instruments and synthesizers.
The Future Is Now: Avant Garde Jazz
Avant garde jazz is experimental and often includes significant improvisation,
but it also usually has structure. It may sometimes sound chaotic, but it’s
often elaborately composed in advance.
In the following sections, I discuss two avant garde movements — the Lydian
Concept and Third Stream — that originated in the ’40s and ’50s and how
they continued to influence jazz musicians through the ’60s and ’70s.

George Russell and his Lydian Concept
Pianist and composer George Russell (born 1923) developed his “Lydian
Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization” during the 1940s. Lydian refers to
an ancient Greek scale — an exotic-sounding variation of a standard major
scale. Russell composed pieces for musicians that often used Afro-Cuban ele-
ments (see Chapter 9 for details about jazz with Afro-Cuban elements).
The Lydian mode was effectively used by Beethoven, Prokofiev, Ravel, and
Scriabin, but Russell was one of the first to bring this element — originally built
on simple blues or popular Broadway songs — into jazz. The Lydian mode
became the basis for spare, moody jazz compositions and improvisations.
Russell’s 1953 book on his own Lydian Concept set the stage for music by
John Coltrane, Miles Davis, pianist Bill Evans, and others in the 1960s, utiliz-
ing only a few scales (instead of the many scales required to follow bebop’s
frantic chord changes) and allowing greater freedom for improvisation.
Russell’s fans included modernist Japanese classical composer Toru
Takemitsu, another example of the increasingly blurred boundary between
jazz and classical music (see the next section).
Hear Russell’s older compositions on ’50s/early ’60s albums such as Jazz
Workshop (Bluebird); Stratusphunk (Original Jazz Classics); The Outer View
(Original Jazz Classics); and Electronic Sonata for Souls Loved by Nature (Soul
Note) (this one’s out of print, but dig around for a copy). Today, Russell leads
and tours with his International Living Time Orchestra. To hear how his
music has evolved, get The 80th Birthday Concert (Concept).
Third stream and its classical elements
In 1957, author-composer-conductor-teacher Gunther Schuller coined the
phrase third stream for music that combined jazz and classical elements. He
said that he meant for the term to refer to a separate new genre of music not
simply jazz with classical elements or vice versa. Classical composers such
as Bartok, who combined Hungarian folk music with classical forms, had ear-
lier invented similar hybrids.
Third stream music combined jazz’s rhythmic drive and improvisation with
classical instrumentation and forms such as:
 Fugues: Contrasting melodies that overlap and intertwine as they’re
expressed by different musical instruments.
 Suites: Musical compositions that move through loosely related move-
ments, like chapters in a short novel.
 Concertos: Composed for orchestra (or jazz ensemble) and one or two
solo instruments.
144
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Modern composers such as George Gershwin, Darius Milhaud, and Igor
Stravinsky had already brought jazz and African-American influences into
their music. Now avant garde jazz brought distinctive classical elements 
into a musical tradition that was built on blues and popular music.
In the following sections, I examine the contributions of three third stream
pioneers.
Dave Brubeck
Pianist and composer Dave Brubeck, born 1920, (see Figure 8-1) made his
mark on ’50s jazz and had significant impact on ’60s third stream jazz. One of
Brubeck’s favorite classical forms was the fugue, which he studied after some
coaxing from his mentor: Darius Milhaud. Brubeck continues to record and
perform today, often accompanied by symphony orchestra, continuing his
efforts to merge classical and jazz elements.
© Bettmann/CORBIS
In the ’60s, jazz composers began erasing the line between jazz and classical
music. Brubeck began to eliminate the division with his “Chromatic Fantasy
Sonata” (inspired by Bach’s “Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue”). This piece bor-
rows melodies from Bach and creates a new sonata (a musical composition of
three or four movements of contrasting forms). This piece is played by classi-
cal musicians such as the Brodsky Quartet, yet it uses rhythms and melodies
that evoke the spontaneous, improvised nature of jazz.

In 1967, Brubeck turned away from jazz to focus on composing other music
such as operas, ballets, cantatas, an oratorio, and various religious commis-
sions including a Catholic mass. This fusion of classical music with jazz was
praised by critics on Brubeck’s 1970 album, Elementals for Jazzcombo,
Orchestra and Baritone-Solo. Brubeck and his quartet also performed with 
the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and recorded several albums of his
sacred music with various symphony orchestras.
Charles Mingus
Mingus (1922–1979) was a player in the invention of bebop (see Chapter 7 for
details) and a prolific composer and utilized classical elements in his jazz.
Even in his teens, Mingus (see Figure 8-2) listened to Wagner, Strauss, and
Debussy and wrote his own band arrangements.
Fantasy, Inc.
Mingus’s 1963 ballet score “The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady” is a classical
suite: an orchestral piece for big band that includes classical colors such as
Mingus playing his bass arco style (with a bow instead of plucking with his fin-
gers) and horn arrangements reminiscent of Duke Ellington.
Figure 8-2:

Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Mingus’s 1972 album Let My Children Hear Music, one of his last recordings, is
one of his most ambitious compositions and ensemble arrangements of clas-
sical scope. Appropriately, an online blogger noted that he purchased this
album together with a recording of Mahler’s Eighth Symphony and found
them to be equally challenging orchestral compositions.
The Modern Jazz Quartet
The Modern Jazz Quartet banded in 1952 and played for 22 years (members
included bassist Percy Heath, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, and drummer
Connie Kay, who later was replaced with Albert “Tootie” Heath). This long
history meant that leader John Lewis’s successful combination of classical
forms and arrangements with jazz instruments and improvisations suggested
one path for jazz musicians of the ’60s seeking fresh directions.
Lewis loved writing jazz pieces that utilized the classical fugue form (see
“Third stream and its classical elements” earlier in this chapter for info on
fugue), such as “Alexander’s Fugue,” “A Fugue for Music Inn,” and “Vendome,”
a composition that alternates with sections from Oscar Hammerstein and
Jerome Kern’s “All the Things You Are.”
Letting Loose: Free Jazz
Free jazz liberates players from traditional structures, such as melodic
themes, patterns of chords, and restrictions on the duration or format of
improvisations. Whereas third stream avant garde jazz was innovative for
bringing together jazz and classical music, free jazz was based almost entirely
on improvisation. Many free jazz pieces begin with a musical theme, and
then, as in other forms of jazz, the players take turns soloing.
But a song’s structure varies from loose to virtually nonexistent:
 Bandmates improvised collectively or one at a time.
 Music shifts occurred impulsively instead of on cue or from sheet music.
 Free-jazz players used instruments in unconventional ways to produce
unusual sounds such as horns generating moans, shrieks, and cries.
Along with John Coltrane, saxophonist Ornette Coleman and pianist Cecil
Taylor rank as the most influential adventurers in early ’60s jazz. Although
their music seems to be coming from shared ideas, Coleman’s emerged freer,
while Taylor’s had more structure. I cover all three pioneers in the following
sections.

John Coltrane’s spiritual quest
Tenor saxophonist John Coltrane (1926–1967) grew up in High Point, North
Carolina, and played various horns as a teenager and for a Navy band in
Hawaii around the end of World War II in 1945. Although Coltrane (shown in
Figure 8-3) broke jazz wide open with his free explorations and spirituality, he
began his career in rhythm-and-blues and jazz bands led by King Kolax, Eddie
“Cleanhead” Vinson, Jimmy Heath, Howard McGhee, Dizzy Gillespie, and Earl
Bostic.

Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Coltrane’s move into experimental music came in Miles Davis’s 1959 Kind of
Blue quintet. On that album Coltrane’s solos began to break free from the
past as he explored wildly imaginative improvisations using only a few scales
and began to explore the exotic saxophone tones that eventually became his
signature. Key elements of Coltrane’s music include the following:
 Free, soaring solos: Coltrane selected a few chords and scales as the
basis for improvisations that became longer than most any player’s
before him.
 Wild sounds: Squeals and squawks that others may consider “noise” 
artfully integrated into his solos, extending the emotional range and
intensity.
 Modal: Modal is a meditative approach that Coltrane used as his fascina-
tion with Shankar and Indian music grew. Coltrane wrote songs centered
on single scales or modes instead of complex chord changes. Improvisers
felt freer to play straight from their feelings because they didn’t need to
follow the zigzagging chord changes of jazz.
 Blues connections: Coltrane captured the earthy feel of blues on albums
such as Blue Train.
Coltrane’s music and personal life continued to follow a spiritual path, and he
studied eastern religions and musicians including Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar
(Coltrane named his son Ravi, who’s discussed in Chapter 10). Coltrane saw
his music as a spiritual offering. To this day in San Francisco, the Church of
John Coltrane uses his music as a basis for services.
Coltrane’s 1964 album A Love Supreme marked a new milestone, as the music
took on a meditative aura, and Coltrane improvised with no restrictions as 
far as chord changes, melodies, or length of solo. The music built on spare
“sketches” of themes that Coltrane explained to his band just before the
recording session. Coltrane gave his only live performance of A Love Supreme
at the Antibes Jazz Festival in 1965.
Late in his career, Coltrane used pure feeling and less preconceived form 
in his music. He often used a soprano sax instead of a tenor sax to capture
increasingly intense feelings. The power of the music shows through his
albums that showcase both uncompromising art and commercial viability —
the saxophonist tapped something primal and universal in human emotions.
Among 20th century jazz musicians, Coltrane ranks as one of the most influ-
ential, alongside Charlie Parker (see Chapter 7) and Miles Davis (covered
later in this chapter and in Chapter 7). Young players who got their start with
Coltrane include drummer Elvin Jones and pianist McCoy Tyner. As they con-
tinued in Coltrane’s spirit, you could hear the dark moods and boundless
improvisation they learned from Coltrane.

Chapter 8: A Radical Departure: The 1960s and 1970s

Ornette Coleman on the fringe
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1930, saxophonist Ornette Coleman grew up
hearing Texas blues and R&B. He played in bands led by guitarist Pee Wee
Crayton and others. But unlike other young musicians who play and record in
established styles before finding a sound of their own, Coleman made fringe
music almost from the start.
Coleman’s music paralleled abstract painting — art with no tangible subject.
Instead, feelings, impressions, and emotions posed as the subjects. Coleman’s
music has only the loosest structure, sometimes as limited as a simple strand
of melody or repeated funky rhythms. Players improvised practically all the
music.
Harmolodics, as Coleman (see Figure 8-4) calls his musical system, lets musi-
cians respond to their intuitions and to each other as they invent new har-
monies and melodies on the spot. Coleman’s music challenges listeners to 
be patient with open ears and an open mind but reaping the rewards.

Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Coleman’s music may at times seem random, but it has traits in common with
other jazz:
 Improvisation: Coleman’s goal wasn’t to lead his bandmates, but instead,
it was to create a context where they found their deepest personal
expression through improvisation in a group context. No written melody
or harmony defined the range of improvisation.
 Form: Most of Coleman’s pieces derived their forms only from the spon-
taneous ideas of the performers and the ways in which individual listen-
ers interpreted the music. Like an abstract painting, Coleman’s music
produces vastly different emotions and thoughts in different listeners.
 Distinctive voices: Coleman’s revolutionary sound on alto saxophone
resonates in his sharp tone and soaring improvised melodies. Among
the first free jazz musicians, Coleman forced new sounds from his instru-
ments through different breathing techniques and also through use of
the horn’s parts, such as the clicking of keys, or tapping on the horn’s
body.
 Swing: Coleman may fly away from any sort of structure, but Charlie
Haden on bass and Billy Higgins on drums swing hard through several
sections on The Shape of Jazz to Come (Atlantic), laying down a loose,
grooving foundation for Coleman’s liberal creations.
 Logic: Coleman exhibited logic to his seemingly free jazz. He and trum-
peter Don Cherry (his frequent collaborator, whom I cover later in this
chapter) often played notes in tandem that implied chords. Coleman’s
approach relied on collective improvisation with gifted bandmates like
bassist Charlie Haden and drummers Ed Blackwell and Billy Higgins.
Check out Coleman on two prime examples of his jazz:
 Coleman’s 1959 album The Shape of Jazz to Come (with its cover by
abstract painter Jackson Pollock) set the jazz world on its ear with its
odd and exotic beauty. Some critics and old-school players didn’t know
what to make of Coleman’s wild, squealing improvisations. Early engage-
ments at the Five Spot club in New York brought curious legends like
Miles Davis, who watched in awe as Coleman performed using a plastic
saxophone.
 Coleman’s 1960 album Free Jazz (A Collective Improvisation) is another
example of early free jazz. Coleman assembled two quartets and made
them improvise face to face without predetermined chords, tunes, or
structures. The result? An exciting new variety of intuitive chamber music,
in which the players responded to and elaborated on each other’s ideas.
The collective approach signified the desire for social harmony at a time
when America lived in upheaval.

Chapter 8: A Radical Departure: The 1960s and 1970s

In the ’70s, Coleman visited Morocco and played with masters of joujouka,
the native music. Also in the ’70s, running a parallel track to Miles Davis,
Coleman plugged in with his band Prime Time. Alongside Coleman, the band
included two electric basses, two guitars, and two drummers, producing a
whirlwind of sound.
As of 2006, Coleman continues to tour and create new music, making him one
of the most prolific and durable of free jazz’s pioneers.
Cecil Taylor’s stunning tones
Unlike most of his ’60s peers, pianist Cecil Taylor (born 1929) had formal
training in classical music. At the New England Conservatory of Music, he
studied Stravinsky and emulated Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington, and Lennie
Tristano — all of whom used classical elements.
Taylor (see Figure 8-5) wasn’t interested in new electronic instruments
because he considered himself strictly an acoustic pianist. Nor did he favor
the formless approach of Ornette Coleman. Instead, Taylor used phenomenal
technique to achieve stunning, overlapping sounds and tones above a recog-
nizable structure.
Taylor’s 1966 album Unit Structures explodes like a volcano with percussion,
piano, two horns, and two basses, and various scales, rhythmic patterns, and
musical themes specified by Taylor and the music guided by Taylor’s piano.
His 1978 recording “Unit” is a sextet session in which the group improvisa-
tions empathize amazingly.
Some critics say that although Taylor’s music is improvised, it contains the
imaginative structure, harmonies, contrasting melodies, and rhythmic varia-
tions of great classical music.
Other free jazz players of the 1960s
Some musicians preferred completely free improvisation and others utilized
various means of structuring their music beforehand. All of them took jazz
into new and exciting places. I cover some of these giants in the following
sections.
The Art Ensemble of Chicago
This ensemble arose from the Association for the Advancement of Creative
Musicians (AACM) like the World Saxophone Quartet (covered later in this
chapter). The Art Ensemble included trumpeter Lester Bowie, bassist
Malachi Favors, drummer Don Moye, saxophonist Joseph Jarman, and flutist
and saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell (Bowie died in 1999; Favors in 2004).

The group’s jazz used authentic African sounds (including chants) and instru-
ments. It’s almost entirely improvised, and their performances provided a
spectacle, with band members painting their faces and wearing loose clothes
made from African-print fabrics. Balanced on the cutting edge of ’60s and ’70s
jazz, the ensemble’s music was also rooted deep in Africa.
Tutankhamun (Black Lion) embodies their early (circa-1969) music.
Paul Bley
On piano, Paul Bley (born 1932) plays a lighter, dreamier style of jazz than his
peers. Early on, Bley played with 1950s cool and hard-bop musicians such as
trumpeter Chet Baker and saxophonist Jackie McLean, but by the 1960s, Bley
left those structures to explore largely improvised jazz.
Look for Improvisations: Introducing Paul Bley (Original Jazz Classics), Paul
Bley with Gary Peacock (ECM), and Copenhagen and Harlem (Arista).
Anthony Braxton
With his cardigan sweaters and wire-rimmed glasses, Anthony Braxton 
(born 1945) looks like a college math professor, and his music is as perplex-
ing as advanced calculus. Sometimes Braxton played unaccompanied and
other times he composed epic works — symphonic in their precision and

complexity. Braxton plays the alto sax and other wind instruments as well as
piano and has produced some of jazz’s most unconventional music since the
mid-’60s.
Listen to For Alto Saxophone (Delmark), Dortmund/Quartet 1976 (Hat Art),
and Six Monk’s Compositions/1987 (Black Saint).
Don Cherry
Trumpeter Don Cherry (1936–1995) composed and played music that drew
from both international and classical sources. He inspired many musicians
who came through his bands.
 Cherry first explored free jazz as a member of Ornette Coleman’s
Quartet.
 He then formed his own band, Old and New Dreams, with drummer Ed
Blackwell, bassist Charlie Haden, and saxophonist Dewey Redman.
 Cherry played with Coltrane, Shepp, and other free-jazz leaders in 
the ’60s.
 In the ’70s he made music with rock musicians such as Lou Reed and the
Talking Heads.
 In the ’70s and ’80s, Cherry brought international sounds into his music
through his band, Codona, that showed a move from hard-edge free jazz
to a gentler combination of jazz sounds with the music of Africa, India,
South America, and the Middle East.
Head out to your favorite music store and get Cherry’s Symphony for
Improvisers (Blue Note) as well as Codona, Vols. 1, 2, & 3. The first CD 
finds Cherry leading a sextet through some bold improvised jazz in 1966,
whereas the Codona series combines Cherry’s sharp solos on trumpet 
with the soothing thrum of world rhythms.
Eric Dolphy
Eric Dolphy (1928–1964) was an associate of fellow saxophonists Ornette
Coleman and John Coltrane. Together in Coltrane’s group, Dolphy and
Coltrane soloed until they felt they finished — which may have been ten 
minutes or an hour or longer.
Through his association with composer Gunther Schuller, Dolphy also had a
hand, or horn, in early ’60s experiments at combining jazz with elements of
classical music. He mainly played the alto sax, but he also played bass clar-
inet and flute.
154
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Hear Dolphy’s wild leaps of imagination on Here and There (Original 
Jazz Classics), Out There (Original Jazz Classics), and Far Cry (Original 
Jazz Classics), and on several Coltrane albums including Impressions
(GRP/Impulse!).
Dolphy also made numerous free jazz albums as a leader beginning in 1960.
Out To Lunch (Blue Note), recorded months before his death in 1964, features
some of his wild, free blowing, with its dark, haunting undertones.
Archie Shepp
On tenor saxophone and piano, Archie Shepp (born 1937) has been a vital
free-jazz player from the start. Cecil Taylor recruited Shepp to his band in
1960, and in the mid-’60s Coltrane helped Shepp land a recording contract.
Throughout his career, Shepp asserted that improvisation is the essential ele-
ment of jazz, as it was in the African music that influenced jazz. Improvisation
became a sort of conversation between musicians, and also between Shepp
and his audiences, who would add to the music by openly responding with
hand claps, foot taps, shouts, and whatever else they could use.
Shepp saw his free jazz as expressing some of the emotions felt by African
Americans during the turbulent 1960s. One of Shepp’s songs is titled
“Malcolm, Malcolm — Semper Malcolm,” in honor of civil rights leader
Malcolm X. He believes that it was important for jazz to express political,
social, and emotional realities, not just entertain.
Although his early saxophone playing took the form of honking, screaming
expression, his more recent music is more bluesy and melodic, in order to
reach a broader audience.
Check out Archie Shepp in Europe (Delmark), Four for Trane (GRP/Impulse!),
On This Night (GRP), and Magic of Ju-Ju (GRP/Impulse!).
Sun Ra
Sun Ra (1914–1993) claimed he was from another galaxy and because his
birth certificate was never found, he held on to his other-worldly demeanor.
Quite possibly, Sun Ra’s musical transformation was one of the most radical
in jazz. He began in the 1940s as a musical arranger for Chicago stage shows
and as a member of Fletcher Henderson’s swing band (see Chapter 6 for
information on Henderson). But by 1955, he led the Arkestra series of bands:
 The Solar Arkestra
 The Myth-Science Arkestra
 The Omniverse Arkestra
155
Chapter 8: A Radical Departure: The 1960s and 1970s

These names all add to Sun Ra’s fascination with space travel. The bands
started out playing hard bop (see Chapter 7 for info on hard bop) but soon
began experimenting with free improvisation.
Live performances with the Arkestra groups paraded a spectacle of cos-
tumes, movement, and sound; the music was equally stunning. The visual
spectacle included the troupe hitting the stage in capes, robes, and space hel-
mets, joined by dancers who chanted phrases such as “We travel the space
ways, from planet to planet.” Sometimes the band paraded right off the stage
and through the audience.
You want some of Sun Ra’s music in your collection (especially if you plan to
be aboard the next mission to Mars). But before you try the music, you may
want to watch the Sun Ra’s weird sci-fi film Space is the Place, in which he
portrays an alien who comes to earth in a spaceship. Also check out Atlantis
(1967) and Languidity (1978) (both on the Evidence label) for two recordings
from Sun Ra’s earthbound collection, mixing swirling synthesizers with horns
and other acoustic instruments to create to sonic journeys through space.
Today the Arkestra, under the leadership of Marshall Allen, includes more
than a dozen players, some of whom were recruited by Sun Ra in the ’50s 
and ’60s.
The World Saxophone Quartet
Since the late ’60s, the World Saxophone Quartet has produced a string of
provocative albums of original music and revamped classic jazz. Members 
of The World Saxophone Quartet include
 Oliver Lake and Julius Hemphill, alto saxophonists
 David Murray, tenor saxophonist
 Hamiett Bluiett, baritone saxophonist
The group’s music combines jazz, blues, and gospel with authentic African
rhythms and instruments. They continued to perform and record through the
’80s and ’90s, until Hemphill’s death in 1995.
Get acquainted with the group by starting with Steppin’ With (Black Saint),
W.S.Q. (Black Saint), and Plays Duke Ellington (Elektra).
Chicago and New York City, 
the two centers for free jazz
In the ’60s and ’70s, Chicago and New York became the centers for free jazz.
156
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Chicago
In Chicago, a group of African-American jazz players led by pianist Muhal
Richard Abrams founded the AACM in 1965 as a nonprofit collection of musi-
cians and composers dedicated to creating “serious, original music” — a
more generic rephrasing of the collective’s original “Great Black Music.” So
naturally, Chicago became a destination for musicians wishing to tap the
AACM’s source of creative power and support.
Truly, the AACM supports new and diverse musical expressions of the black
experience in America by combining roots with revolution. Members of the
AACM painted their faces and wore tribal costumes while they performed
their avant garde music. The AACM gives black musicians the solidarity and
support they need to make music for artistic, not commercial, reasons. The
AACM members include
 The Art Ensemble of Chicago
 Lester Bowie
 Anthony Braxton
 Chico Freeman
 George Lewis
 Henry Threadgill
The AACM presents concerts, takes jazz into city schools, and maintains its
own music school. It is a vital organization still today.
New York City
In New York City, some musicians performed experimental jazz at various
urban venues including industrial-style lofts, thus earning the label “loft jazz.”
Andrew Cyrille, Sam Rivers, Cecil Taylor comprised some members of the
New York scene. Wildflowers (Knitting Factory) documents this period on a
boxed set of CDs.
In the ’80s, the Knitting Factory took on the role of lofts where experimental
jazz had been performed in the ’60s and ’70s. Players recorded by the
Knitting Factory label include
 Rashied Ali (onetime John Coltrane drummer)
 Anthony Braxton (also an AACM member)
 Don Byron
 Anthony Coleman
157
Chapter 8: A Radical Departure: The 1960s and 1970s

 Mark Dresser
 The Jazz Passengers
 Junk Genius (a San Francisco band)
 Roscoe Mitchell
 Roy Nathanson
In recent years, the Knitting Factory opened a Los Angeles sister club and
expanded its program to include contemporary music, not just jazz.
Both the Knitting Factory and the AACM have fascinating Web sites that pro-
vide a lot of information on the music as well as bios of many musicians.

Academia finally embraces jazz
One of the signs that jazz was earning accep-
tance as important American music came when
universities began to offer courses and degrees
in jazz history and performance.
 The University of North Texas became the
first American university to offer a degree
in jazz in 1947.
 Prompted by John Lewis, a faculty member
(with Max Roach, Kenny Dorham, Bill Evans,
and other jazz greats), Ornette Coleman and
Don Cherry enrolled at the Lenox School of
Jazz in Massachusetts in 1959.
 Also in 1959, big band legend Stan Kenton
began offering the first of his summer jazz
camps in Bloomington, Indiana.
 Indiana University (IU) popularized jazz
bands in the ’50s and ’60s and offered a
bachelor’s degree in jazz studies for the first
time in 1968. In 1979, IU added a master’s
degree program in jazz. As a result of new
awareness of black culture in the 1960s,
many other universities soon added a vari-
ety of African-American studies including
jazz.
The National Association of Jazz Educators
(now known the International Association of
Jazz Educators) was founded in 1968 to promote
jazz as an important part of curriculum at all
levels of education and has grown to more than
8,000 members in 42 countries.
Today universities offer many types of jazz pro-
grams, from history and theory, to performance,
and in all styles from ragtime to free jazz. Most
professional jazz players today have college
degrees in music, some of them from prestigious
schools like Juilliard and Berklee. College edu-
cations would have been a radical notion during
jazz’s early years, when aspiring performers
earned their “degrees” on the road.

Music with a Message: 1960s
Jazz as Social Expression
From the beginning, jazz had social and political significance. Listening to
melting-pot-early-jazz from New Orleans, sweet-Depression-antidote-jazz from
the 1930s, or wake-up-bebop from the 1940s, it’s easy to see how each type of
music reflected those times in America. In the 1960s, jazz’s social messages
screamed with blatancy, especially in the music of African-American musi-
cians for whom the music became a direct expression of new ideas about
being black in America. In the following sections, I discuss how musicians
explored their heritage and expressed their struggle.
Connecting with world cultures
African music was a primary building block of jazz. In the 1950s, jazz musi-
cians such as drummers Art Blakey and Max Roach began reconnecting with
the music’s origins by utilizing authentic African elements in their music.
In the 1960s and early 1970s, jazz musicians from many ethnic backgrounds
broadened the music by bringing in a variety of international influences at a
time when the U.S. was at war in Vietnam and racial tensions were on the rise
at home. Here are some examples of those influences:
 John Coltrane used the mournful drone typical of an Indian sitar 
(a stringed instrument) in his saxophone playing. Albums with this 
influence include Africa/Brass, Brazilia, India, and Olé.
 Chick Corea, jazz pianist, collaborated with Brazilian percussionist Airto
and his wife, vocalist Flora Purim, to make jazz with the lush bird cries
and rushing rhythms one associates with a rain forest, as on his album
Light as a Feather (Polygram).
 Yusef Lateef, flutist, brought minor-key Asian melodies to his 1961
recording Eastern Sounds (OJC).
 Charles Lloyd used Latin rhythms and tropical wind instrument sounds
through his saxophone and flute on his 1966 album Forest Flower
(Atlantic). This record became extremely popular with young ’60s jazz
fans and sold more than one million copies. The album showed Lloyd’s
growing fascination with Islamic Sufi music, Indian singer Nusrat Fateh
Ali Khan, and fado (Portuguese folk music) vocalist Amalia Rodrigues.
 John McLaughlin explored religion and music, two forces that turn up 
in the introspective, moody music, through his electric jazz guitarist.
Check out these sounds on albums such as The Inner Mounting Flame
(Sony) with the Mahavishnu Orchestra.
159
Chapter 8: A Radical Departure: The 1960s and 1970s

Black Power and racial turmoil
In jazz, a new group of musicians experimented with making music that didn’t
use earlier forms and techniques. Jazz’s avant garde sought to express pure
emotions in exciting new ways. During the 1960s and 1970s, these musicians
were often criticized or misunderstood. Today, though, they’re highly
regarded as innovators whose jazz kept pace with a rapidly changing world:
 Albert Ayler: Ayler (1936–1970) was one of the most experimental saxo-
phonists of the ’60s. He served in Vietnam and identified with the Black
Power movement, but emphasized that his music was spiritual, not
intended to provoke conflict. His free jazz captured the racial and politi-
cal turmoil of the ’60s, as well as hope for the future.
His jazz was ground in black church music, and early ’60s albums with
titles like Spiritual Unity (ESP) give a sense of his mission. Before he died,
Ayler’s music moved toward rock, with hippie-era lyrics by his girlfriend
Mary Maria Parks. His last albums included Music is the Healing force of
the Universe (Universal).
 Amira Baraka: In the ’60s, poet, author, and scholar Amira Baraka (for-
merly Leroi Jones) wrote about the significance of African-American
music as an expression of the black struggle for freedom and equality.
His book Blues People is a must for comprehending blues and jazz as an
expression of African-American culture.
 Archie Shepp: Shepp (covered earlier in this chapter) was a saxophonist
who identified with Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, the Black Muslims,
and the Black Power movement. He viewed his music as an expression of
the black struggle, and saw John Coltrane as a leader in freeing black
musicians to make music for higher purposes than entertainment.
Shepp’s Four for Trane (GRP), a tribute to his musical and spiritual
mentor, shows how one saxophonist reinvents another’s music through
improvisation. More than many of his peers, Shepp channeled African
music into his jazz, through sounds and rhythms such as on the albums
The Cry of My People (Impulse) and The Magic of Ju-Ju (Universal), with
his frantic, improvised saxophone lines woven through the light rhythms
of popular African Ju-Ju music.
Plug In: Electric and Eclectic Fusions
Free jazz constituted one jazz branch that flowed during the 1960s. Another
stream blended jazz with rock, funk, and other styles and became known as
fusion or electric jazz, which hit its prime during the late ’60s and early ’70s.
160
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Although some fans and critics dismiss fusion for not being genuine jazz, it
contains all the hallmarks. Musically, there’s no question: it’s jazz. Fusion
swings and includes extensive improvisation and features soloists with dis-
tinctive voices. In fact, many of the first musicians to play fusion had played
more traditional acoustic jazz before they went electric. I cover several of
them in the following sections.
Miles Davis
Miles Davis (1926–1991), who played unplugged bebop and cool jazz during
the 1940s and 1950s (check out Chapter 7 for details), teamed his trumpet
with electric instruments and utilized elements from funk and rock. His band-
mates included electric guitarists such as John McLaughlin and jazz pianists
161
Chapter 8: A Radical Departure: The 1960s and 1970s
Electrifying jazz instrumentation
Trumpeter Miles Davis was the first jazz musician
to go electric in a big way. As early as 1968, Davis
added electric keyboards to his band. By the sev-
enties, he electrified the rest of the band with
electric bass, electric guitar, and even electronic
effects for his trumpet. As instruments went elec-
tric, the process of recording went electronic.
Jazz albums were traditionally recorded live with
the band playing together in the same room, but
Davis’s albums began to use studio technology to
edit, cut, paste, and mix a variety of sounds.
Albums such as Bitches Brew came from longer
recordings that were edited to album length.
Inventor Robert Moog created some of the first
synthesizers, used by the Beatles in pop music,
and by various jazz musicians. Pianists such as
Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock used synthe-
sizers to emulate electric guitars, string sections,
or entire orchestras. Synthesizers gave any
instrument, even Davis’s trumpet, the ability to
sound like any other instrument. Some saxo-
phone players tried the new electric wind instru-
ment (EWI), which relied entirely on electronics
for its sound. It was mostly a novelty that never
became a regular instrument in jazz. Most saxo-
phonists play their instruments without special
effects now. Young musicians who like comput-
ers and electronic manipulation usually use
these tools to tweak sounds made on their regu-
lar instruments.
With electric instruments, bands such as Davis’s
had the ability to play loud enough for larger
venues. Davis eventually opened for the Grateful
Dead at the Fillmore in San Francisco and also
played large rock and jazz festivals. The electric
connection also meant the some jazz began
incorporating more rock sounds such as guitars.
Davis’s guitarists used various distorting effects
that gave them rock-and-roll tones. In fact, many
jazz fans wonder what may have happened had
Davis recorded with Jimi Hendrix or Prince. It
might have been another boring all-star jam ses-
sion, but it just might have produced some bril-
liant music, with Prince’s funk rhythms and
high-pitched vocals layered in with Davis’s whis-
pery trumpet.

like Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea — with Davis they played electric key-
boards, but Corea later returned to acoustic piano, while Hancock played
both acoustic and electric.
Playing his trumpet through electronic effects, Davis got a haunting, echoey
sound, and he sprayed delicate lines of improvised melody against the
canvas of throbbing, pulsing sounds provided by his bands.
Throughout his career, Davis had a knack for discovering raw talent.
Countless musicians who participated in Davis’s early electric sessions went
on to play essential parts during the next phase of jazz fusion. These musi-
cians included
 Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, and Joe Zawinul, keyboard players
 Wayne Shorter, saxophonist
 John McLaughlin, guitarist
 Ron Carter, acoustic and electric bassist
Davis’s 1960s albums In a Silent Way (Sony) and Bitches Brew (Sony) started 
a revolution by harnessing rock’s electric guitars and funk’s electric bass
rhythms and drums to Davis probing, amplified trumpet. It was the first 
time a veteran jazz musician embraced electric music.
Other fusioneers
In addition to Davis’s key recordings, hunt down some of these other players
at your local music store:
 Chick Corea (born 1941): Corea played with Miles Davis and went on to
fusions of his own, leading the group Return to Forever. Light As A
Feather (Polygram) blends Corea’s electric piano with Brazilian rhythms
and Flora Purim’s light, airy vocals. Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy
(Polygram) takes fusion in a more electrifying rock direction.
 The Crusaders: During the 1970s, parties popped with the Crusaders
just as much as with hard rock. Scratch (MCA) is an electric jazz-funk
party classic.
 Herbie Hancock (born 1940): Headhunters (Columbia) is one of Hancock’s
all-time top electric jazz/funk recordings, but I’m also partial to his 1974
Thrust (Priority), which includes the beautiful song “Butterfly.”
162
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

 Freddie Hubbard (born 1938): This talented trumpeter (and flugelhorn
player) made one of my favorite electric jazz albums. Red Clay came out
in 1970 and captured my attention with its spare arrangements and
Hubbard’s mellow flugelhorn solos.
 John McLaughlin (born 1942): McLaughlin formed the Mahavishnu
Orchestra — an electrifying jazz/rock fusion band, and its albums Inner
Mounting Flame (Columbia) and Birds of Fire (Columbia) are electric jazz
classics.
 Grover Washington, Jr. (born 1943): On my friend Brad Shuster’s mega-
watt system, saxman Washington’s 1975 Mister Magic (Motown) split our
eardrums. It’s one of the most important albums to merge jazz with funk
and soul — great solos, rock-solid rhythms.
 Weather Report: Led by keyboardist Joe Zawinul and saxman Wayne
Shorter, this electric jazz group really soared after bassist Jaco Pastorius
came aboard. Black Market (Columbia) makes my A-list of electric jazz.

The Perfect Hybrid: Latin Jazz
In This Chapter
 Surveying the elements and influences of Latin jazz
 Introducing the Cuboppers in the ’40s and ’50s
 Shimmying in the ’60s and plugging in to the electric ’70s
 Shaking it up with Latin jazz’s latest generation
B
ossa nova, Cubop, calypso, mambo, salsa, cha-cha-cha. Since the early
beginnings of jazz, Latin rhythms have spiced up the music. Over the
years, Latin music has proved to be extremely compatible with jazz when it
comes to creating new hybrid forms of music. Both are driven by syncopated
rhythms, but Latin music added new rhythmic patterns. Both often rely on
strong melodies as hooks, but Latin music added new romantic melodies
from Latin songs. Both are loose and spontaneous music, so their musicians
make music together very naturally.
Of course, jazz’s basic rhythmic roots derive from African heritage, but the
music has a tradition of rhythmic variety dating back to New Orleans, where
the cultural mix included African, French, Hispanic, and assorted tropical fla-
vors (see Chapter 5 for details).
In this chapter, I introduce you to several styles of Latin jazz, including Cubop
and bossa, and the amazing musicians who play them.
A Sound of Many Origins: 
Defining Latin Jazz
Latin can be a misleading word. Generally, “Latin” means anything from
Cuban to Mexican to South American, but in the history of American jazz, it
most often means Cuban (or Afro-Cuban, because much of Cuba’s population

originally came from Africa). Latin jazz incorporates a variety of elements —
mostly rhythmic — from several locales outside the United States and mostly
in the southern hemisphere.
 Salsa refers to spicy Afro-Cuban dance music (and Mexican hot sauce).
 Bossa nova and samba are Brazilian.
 Mambo is Cuban.
All through the creation of this new hybrid known as Latin jazz, American and
Latin musicians came together in a common love of improvisation and synco-
pated rhythms. Although Jelly Roll Morton (see Chapter 5) was the first big-
name jazz musician to acknowledge Latin flavors in his music when he spoke
of “the Spanish tinge,” the first significant appearance of Latin musicians 
and rhythms in jazz came when bebopper Dizzy Gillespie teamed with Cuban
bandleaders Machito and Mario Bauza as well as percussionist Chano Pozo in
the mid-1940s (see “Meet the Cuboppers: Latin Jazz in the 1940s,” later in this
chapter, for details on these folks). Although the Cubans became famous with
jazz fans, they had already been stars in their native country.
Hard bop pianist Horace Silver experimented with Latin jazz, as did arranger
Gil Evans with trumpeter Miles Davis (see Chapters 7 and 8), and Duke
Ellington (see Chapter 6). Saxophonist Stan Getz recorded popular Brazilian-
flavored albums in the ’60s, and Cuban saxophonist Paquito D’Rivera made
several excellent Latin jazz albums beginning in the ’80s.
Latin jazz also encompasses Airto Moreira’s Brazilian-flavored jazz; percus-
sionist Tito Puente (covered later in this chapter) — known to pop audiences
as composer of the Santana hit “Oye Como Va;” vibraphonist Cal Tjader’s
adventurous Latin jazz from the ’50s and ’60s; percussionist Carlos “Patato”
Valdez; and percussionist and composer Mongo Santamaria, who recorded
the 1963 hit song “Watermelon Man.”
Making Their Mark: Early 
Latin Influences on Jazz
Jelly Roll Morton, the pianist and bandleader who helped create New Orleans
jazz (see Chapter 5), utilized Caribbean rhythms. In his music from the ’20s,
you sometimes hear his left hand play a Latin pattern known as a habanera.
To get a feel for habanera, tap your foot 1-2 . . . 1-2, and over each set of two
foot beats, tap out four beats: 1 . . . 2, 3, 4. The hesitation between 1 and 2 is
what gives habanera its Latin flavor.
166
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

In the ’30s, bandleaders Don Azpiazu and Xavier Cugat helped popularize
Cuban dance music called rhumba. Cugat had a hit in 1935 with Cole Porter’s
“Begin the Beguine,” and continued to play light, commercial Latin jazz into
the ’50s. Cugat was important because he helped introduce America to Latin
rhythms, setting the stage for Latin jazz musicians such as
percussionist/bandleader Tito Puente and pianist Perez Prado (both artists
are discussed later in this chapter).
Among Latin musicians, Alberto (or Albert) Socarras impacted early jazz and
led Latin jazz bands during the ’30s and hired jazz musicians like singer Cab
Calloway (see Chapter 6) and Cuban percussionist/composer Mongo
Santamaria. Socarras was also one of the first jazz flutists.
Some swing bands used Latin flavors occasionally during the ’30s. Duke
Ellington (see Chapter 6) played songs written by his Puerto Rican trombon-
ist Juan Tizol, including the famous Ellington anthem “Caravan.” But it wasn’t
until the ’40s in New York that Latin elements began turning up in jazz in a
significant way.
Meet the Cuboppers: Latin 
Jazz in the 1940s
New York — an obvious birthplace for new forms of jazz — in the ’40s had
almost as eclectic a culture as New Orleans in the ’20s. Saxophonist Charlie
Parker and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, the inventors of bebop (see Chapter 7
for details on bebop), were the first famous jazz players to make major use of
Latin flavors. In turn, Cuban immigrants in New York merged bebop into their
music, and the cultural exchange between American jazz players and recent
immigrants created something called Cubop — blazing bebop played over
Afro-Cuban rhythms.
Cubop music may move to syncopated Latin rhythms, and then switch to the
straight up 1-2-3-4 of big band swing. When Gillespie and Parker collaborated
during the 1940s with bandleader Machito, the resulting hybrid featured Latin
rhythms (played on traditional drum sets and Latin congas and timbales) and
brassy horn sections, with Gillespie and Parker’s speedy, complicated bebop
solos soaring above it all. Gillespie and Machito’s artistic relationship lasted
on and off into the 1980s, and they’re considered key players in the invention
of Cubop.
167
Chapter 9: The Perfect Hybrid: Latin Jazz

Latin musicians who played a role in Cubop’s evolution include Mario Bauza,
Machito, Dizzy Gillespie, Chano Pozo, and Chico O’Farrill. I cover these musi-
cians in the following sections.
Mario Bauza and Machito
Mario Bauza (1911–1993) was a key player in the early 1940s’ fusion of jazz
with Latin influences. Bauza played trumpet in swing bands led by Don
Redman and Cab Calloway, and he acted as musical director in drummer
Chick Webb’s band (see Chapter 6 for more on these guys). Bauza and his
brother-in-law Machito (given name: Frank Grillo) were both Cubans who
came to the U.S. Three years after Machito (1912–1984) arrived in the U.S. in
1937, he started his own band called The Afro-Cubans. The next year, 1941,
Bauza joined The Afro-Cubans as writer, arranger, and trumpeter.
Collaborating with American jazzmen like Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker,
Machito (see Figure 9-1) and Bauza helped create Cubop. Cubop encom-
passes some of the most amazing and underappreciated jazz.

Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

The Original Mambo Kings (Verve) album featuring Machito’s ensemble is one
of the hottest big band jazz recordings. Machito and his orchestra stir up a
storm behind sax players Flip Phillips and Charlie Parker, and trumpeters
Mario Bauza and Dizzy Gillespie. Infectious rhythms on this recording keep
the music grooving, and it’s fresh ’40s Cubop — a new blend never heard
before. Overall, the sound suggests a similarity to the ensemble work in bands
led by Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and Benny Goodman (see Chapter 6 for
more about these musicians). Songs on this CD include Bauza’s composition
“Tanga,” one of the first Afro-Cuban jazz compositions.
Machito and Bauza endured for decades, continuing to make music into the
1970s. Excellent later examples of the band’s percolating dance music can be
heard through several recordings:
 Machito Plays Mambos and Cha-Chas (Palladium)
 Machito Live at the North Sea Jazz Festival (Top Ten Hits) — an example
of Cubop’s jazzier side
 Kenya (Palladium Latin Jazz) by Machito
 The Tanga Suite (Messidor) by Bauza
 Messidor’s Finest Volume One, where Bauza, in the 1990s, finally leads his
own orchestra in a recording of some of his finest music
Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo
Obviously it takes two to tango, or in this case, Cubop. Dizzy Gillespie
(1917–1993) lead the driving force of Cubop from the jazz side of music. Much
of the credit for bringing Afro-Cuban influences to jazz goes to Chano Pozo
(1915–1948), a Cuban percussionist who came to New York City in 1947.
Gillespie focused on Afro-Cuban rhythms years before bebop. In 1939, he and
Mario Bauza (see the previous section) played together in bandleader Cab
Calloway’s trumpet section, and Gillespie also played a brief stint in flutist
Alberto Socarras’s somewhat commercial Afro-Cuban big band. Gillespie 
carried the Afro-Cuban connection into bebop and Cubop. After he and 
saxophonist Charlie Parker had made many recordings and performed
numerous times together, Gillespie struck out on his own.
As leader of a bebop big band, Gillespie continued to utilize Latin rhythms.
Modeled on Billy Eckstine’s big band, which brought together many key play-
ers during the early days of bebop, Gillespie’s first band broke up in 1945,
without enough bookings to stay afloat. But Gillespie was hooked on the
format and organized another big band within a few years, with an emphasis
on Cuban rhythms.
169
Chapter 9: The Perfect Hybrid: Latin Jazz

Gillespie then hired Chano Pozo, whose percussion and vocal style traced
through Cuba and back to West African voodoo cults that arrived in Cuba
with the slave trade during the 18th and 19th centuries. Pozo had ancient
roots, but he also loved playing the new kind of jazz. His 15-month collabora-
tion with Gillespie during the late 1940s produced the definitive examples of
Cubop.
 Chano Pozo and Arsenio Rodriguez’ Legendary Sessions 1947–1953
includes torrid Cubop with Machito and his orchestra. Rodriguez was a
Cuban guitarist and bandleader who came to the U.S. in the 1940s and
continued to lead groups of his own while occasional playing with his
fellow Cubans.
 Gillespie and his band carried Cubop to a broader American jazz audi-
ence. The best examples of Gillespie and Pozo’s association come to
light on Dizzy Gillespie and His Big Band In Concert (GNP) and Diz ’n’
Bird at Carnegie Hall (Roost/Blue Note).
On the GNP disc, dating from 1948, “Emanon” shows how natural it was
for jazz drummers to collaborate with Cuban percussionists — an easy
merger that became common in years to come. Drummer Joe Harris
plays standard jazz rhythms and Pozo embellishes them, then they
switch roles, lending the music a loose, loping feeling.
Meanwhile, Charlie Parker also maintained his Latin love affair. South of the
Border (Verve) — a compilation of music including his collaborations with
Machito’s orchestra — incorporates much of Parker’s Cubop.
Chico O’Farrill
Like Mario Bauza and Chano Pozo, composer, arranger, and trumpeter Chico
O’Farrill (1921–2001) was born in Cuba and came to the U.S. at the height of
Dizzy Gillespie’s fascination with Cubop. O’Farrill arrived well versed in both
Afro-Cuban rhythms and American big band jazz. His symphonic arrange-
ments also displayed his love of classical composers Debussy and Stravinsky.
In O’Farrill’s compositions, you can hear Stravinsky’s sweeping melodies and
love of moody Russian folk music. His big band arrangements utilize har-
monies Stravinsky used with a classical orchestra, and it’s thrilling to hear
subtle classical elements pulsing to a Latin beat and accented by bebop
solos. (Today O’Farrill’s band continues with his son Arturo at the helm.)
O’Farrill is the unsung hero of Latin big band music, including hot dance
music. When he moved to New York in 1948, he soon found enthusiastic 
collaborators such as Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Goodman (see Chapter 6), 
and Stan Kenton (see Chapter 7).
170
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

O’Farrill created “Undercurrent Blues” for Goodman, “Afro-Cuban Suite” for
Charlie Parker with Machito’s orchestra, “Manteca Suite” for Dizzy Gillespie,
more than 80 arrangements for Count Basie (see Chapter 6 for more about
him), a symphony that opened in Mexico City in 1992, and the 1996 “Trumpet
Fantasy” for Wynton Marsalis.
Check out these must-haves for your collection:
 The CD Chico O’Farrill: Heart of a Legend tells part of the story of Latin
jazz from O’Farrill’s viewpoint and gives him deserved credit — not only
for Latin jazz in America but also for composing and arranging Cuban
masterpieces such as “La Verde Campina,” inspired by the gorgeous
Cuban countryside.
 O’Farrill’s recordings from the late 1940s and early 1950s — summarized
on the CD Cuban Blues (Verve) — are a must for your collection. The
eclectic blend on this session features several musicians: trumpeter Roy
Eldridge, saxophonist Flip Phillips, bassist Ray Brown, drummer Jo Jones,
plus Mario Bauza and a host of Latin percussionists. For a broader impres-
sion of O’Farrill, purchase the soundtrack from the film, Heart of a Legend.
The Beat Goes On: Latin Jazz 
Flowering in the 1950s
Machito, Dizzy Gillespie, and Chano Pozo set a torrid Afro-Cuban pace in the
1940s, and momentum carried into the 1950s, as bandleaders followed the
lead of these earlier guys and kept the spices flowing. During the 1950s, Latin
elements also turned up in the driving, bluesy jazz called hard bop, and in
orchestrated California cool jazz as the mambo beat became popular. (See
Chapter 7 for more about hard bop and cool jazz.)
In the following sections, I cover a few major players of Latin jazz in the
1950s.
Art Blakey
The largely rhythmic Latin influence mesmerized drummer Art Blakey
(1919–1990). Blakey, longtime leader of the Jazz Messengers, experimented
with all sorts of rhythms beginning soon after his 1948 visit to Africa, where
he experienced the dense overlapping rhythms of African drumming. Later,
Blakey mixed these rhythms with Latin rhythms through collaboration with
Latin musicians.
171
Chapter 9: The Perfect Hybrid: Latin Jazz

Orgy in Rhythm, Vols. 1 & 2 (Blue Note) incorporated Latin and Afro-Cuban
rhythms with powerful, percussive music. Blakey also plays a prominent part
on pianist Horace Silver’s recording, Horace Silver Trio, Vol. 1: Spotlight on
Drums (EMD/Blue Note), along with Latin percussionist Sabu Martinez, who
grew up in New York City’s Spanish Harlem neighborhood and got his break
when he succeeded Chano Pozo in Dizzy Gillespie’s band in 1948. Check out
Chapter 7 for more about Blakey.
Woody Herman
Bandleader, clarinetist, and saxophonist Woody Herman (1913–1987) and 
his Herd recorded their songwriter Ralph Burns’ Latin-flavored “Bijou” — 
a big band piece set to a rumba rhythm — during the 1940s. During the 
1950s, Herman teamed with Latin percussionist Tito Puente on Puente’s
Beat/Herman’s Heat (Evidence). The album is a tour de force of Latin jazz,
with Puente providing the percussive power on mambos, cha-chas, and 
other tunes set to Latin beats. See Chapter 7 for more about Herman.
Stan Kenton
Pianist, arranger, and bandleader Stan Kenton (1911–1979) experimented
with Latin rhythms by adding Latin musicians to his big band. In 1946, Kenton
and his band sold a million copies of the Latin jazz tune “Tampico,” with June
Christy on vocals. The following year, Kenton and the band recorded Pete
Ruggolo’s “Machito,” a tribute to the Cuban musician and bandleader. Adding
Latin rhythms proved to be both an artistic and commercial success.
Get a hold of The Innovations Orchestra (EMD/Blue Note), with Kenton’s 37-
piece ensemble including Brazilian guitarist Laurindo Almeida, conga player
Carlos Vidal, and trumpeter Chico Alvarez. Also check out Cuban Fire (Blue
Note) — another hot Kenton big band session, featuring an oversize ensem-
ble fueled by five Latin percussionists including Willie Rodriguez on bongos.
See Chapter 7 for more about Kenton.
Perez Prado
Cuban pianist Perez Prado (1916–1983) was known as “The Mambo King,” a
performer and bandleader who helped spark the mambo craze in the 1950s.
But his brand of Latin jazz was much broader than Cuban mambo. He loved
American swing jazz, and he acquired a love of all sorts of Latin rhythms and
172
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

musical elements through travels to Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico,
Spain, and Venezuela. Listeners sometimes observe that Latin jazz, with its
exotic sounds, seems rooted in nature. For Prado, this was no accident. He
used the sounds of birds, frogs, rushing rivers, and wind as the inspiration
for his mambos.
Check out Prado on Havana 3 a.m. (BMG) and Mondo Mambo (Rhino). Prado
and Machito (who I cover earlier in this chapter) team up with vocalist Beny
More on The Most from Beny More (BMG/RCA), and there’s some fine Cuban
big band music from the 1950s on Tumbao Cubano: Cuban Big Band Sound
(Palladium). Also look for Cuban guitarist Arsenio Rodriguez’ Leyendas
(Sony), as well as Puerto Rican vocalist Tito Rodriguez’ Live at Birdland
(Palladium).
Tito Puente
A category unto himself, Tito Puente (1923–2000) has been the single most
prolific player of Latin jazz since the 1950s. Puente was known as “El Rey” —
The King — of timbales. As a percussionist (he also played vibes, congas, and
bongos), Puente has worked with countless leading players including percus-
sionists Machito, Mongo Santamaria, Willie Bobo, and Carlos “Patato” Valdez.
As a leader, Puente’s own albums feature talents as diverse as saxophonist
Mario Rivera, flutist Dave Valentin, and rising young pianist Hilton Ruiz.
Always keeping the “Latin” before the “jazz,” Puente has made an amazing
string of recordings that feature a mix of original Latin jazz tunes and
reworked jazz standards, always with hot, driving rhythms.
Add some essential zing to your collection with Dance Mania (BMG), El Rey
(Concord Picante), Salsa Meets Jazz (Concord Picante), and Royal T (Concord
Picante).
George Shearing
In a small-group setting, pianist George Shearing (born 1919) went Latin with
great results during the 1950s. His thoughtful, subtle playing made an inter-
esting combination with claves, congas, maracas, and timbales on albums
such as Latin Escapade (Capital). He collaborated with Cuban percussionists
Armando Peraza and Willie Bobo. Shearing was already popular, so his Afro-
Cuban music reached a wide audience.
The Best of George Shearing (EMD/Blue Note) contains some of Shearing’s
best Latin jazz. See Chapter 7 for more about Shearing.
173
Chapter 9: The Perfect Hybrid: Latin Jazz

Cal Tjader
More than any American jazzman of the ’60s and ’70s, Tjader (1925–1982) 
was a vital creator of fresh Latin jazz. Cal Tjader’s contributions to Latin jazz
were twofold: He played melodic vibes that blended seamlessly with Latin
rhythms; and, as a leader, he selected great combinations of players and
Latin-flavored material.
He played with great Latin percussionists like Willie Bobo and Mongo
Santamaria and kept his Latin fascination going strong over the course of sev-
eral albums. His later works included Primo (Original Jazz Classics), Descarga
(Original Jazz Classics), La Onda Va Bien (Concord Picante), and A Fuego
Vivo (Concord Picante).
Check out 1954’s Tjader Plays Mambo (Original Jazz Classics) and subsequent
albums including Black Orchid (Fantasy), Latin Concert (Original Jazz
Classics), Latino (Fantasy), El Sonid Nuevo (Verve), and Primo (Original 
Jazz Classics).
The Good Life: The Bossa 1960s
The reedy sound of saxophones and flutes fits naturally with Latin rhythms,
especially those from Brazil and other parts of South America. These instru-
ments are perfect for evoking the feeling of rain forests, complete with the
sound of waterfalls, screeching monkeys, and chirping birds. So it’s not sur-
prising that musicians have been adept at blending Latin elements into their
jazz. The most successful of these musicians are
 Saxophonists Stan Getz and Gato Barbieri
 Flutists like Herbie Mann, and, more recently, Dave Valentin
 Singer Astrud Gilberto, one of the first people to make a case for bossa
in the United States with her recording of “Girl from Ipanema”
Bossa Nova music was gentle, romantic, and set to the Cuban samba rhythm.
In the following sections, I introduce you to major bossa musicians of the
1960s.
174
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Gato Barbieri
Born in Argentina, saxophonist Gato Barbieri (born 1934) blended Latin
rhythms and melodies into his free-spirited jazz since the late 1960s. Barbieri
was one of the first to use these rhythms as the foundation for honking,
squealing free improvisations.
El Pampero (BMG/RCA) epitomizes excellent early Barbieri, while more
recent gems include The Third World Revisited (Bluebird), Chapter 3: Viva
Emiliano Zapata (GRP/Impulse!), with arrangements by Chico O’Farrill, and
Para Los Amigos (A&M).
Ray Barretto
Like Cuban percussionist Chano Pozo before him, percussionist Ray Barretto
(1929–2006) broke into jazz jamming with New York City’s top players. He
played in Tito Puente’s band, but he also played with jazzmen including
pianist Red Garland, saxophonists Lou Donaldson and Gene Ammons, and
guitarist Kenny Burrell — as well as Cal Tjader (whom I cover earlier in this
chapter).
Barretto directed the Latin jazz of the Fania All Stars during the 1960s, and
has made a string of fine Latin jazz albums into the 1990s. His music is distin-
guished by a lighter, gentler feel than ’50s Cubop or early ’60s bossa nova.
Check out Barretto on Carnaval (Fantasy), Handprints (Concord Picante),
Taboo (Concord Picante), as well as on Ammons’ Boss Tenor (Original Jazz
Classics) and Donaldson’s Blues Walk (EMD/Blue Note).
Willie Bobo
Schooled as Machito’s assistant and later as a member of bands fronted by
Tito Puente and Cal Tjader, Willie Bobo (1934–1983) lent the Latin pulse to
some of jazz pianist George Shearing’s recordings, and late in his career col-
laborated with funk and rock musicians including Carlos Santana (Bobo’s
Spanish Grease album, on Polygram, merges soul, jazz, and Latin flavors).
A two-CD reissue of Bobo’s Unos, Dos, Tres and Spanish Grease (PGD/Verve)
albums is a 1960s classic. Also look for Talkin’ Verve (PGD/Verve) and Latino!
(Fantasy) with vibist Cal Tjader and percussionist Mongo Santamaria.
175
Chapter 9: The Perfect Hybrid: Latin Jazz

Stan Getz
Stan Getz (1927–1991), saxophonist, was a leader on the West Coast cool jazz
scene before he became smitten with Latin music, especially from Brazil.
Getz’s breathy, lyrical sound was well suited to gentle, beautiful Brazilian
songs.
Getz connected with Latin-loving vibraphonist Cal Tjader on Stan Getz with
Cal Tjader (Original Jazz Classics). After his seminal early 1960s sessions with
Joao Gilberto, Getz remained passionate about Latin rhythms, as heard on
The Best of Two Worlds (Sony) as well as Apasionado (A&M).
Astrud and Joao Gilberto
The 1963 collaboration of singer Astrud (born 1940) with husband, singer,
and guitarist Joao Gilberto (born 1932); Brazilian composer Antonio Carlos
Jobim; and American saxophonist Stan Getz produced warm, breezy Latin
jazz that was extremely popular in its time but has aged gracefully.
Get The Astrud Gilberto Album (PGD/Verve) as well as her Look at the Rainbow
(PGD/Verve). Also find The Legendary Joao Gilberto (World Pacific), as well as
Getz and Gilberto (Mobile Fidelity), essential albums of early ’60s bossa jazz.
Herbie Mann
Herbie Mann, a flutist born in 1930, merged jazz and Latin music in the 
most inventive ways in the ’60s. Earlier he had led the Afro-Jazz Sextet and
visited Brazil and Africa, and by the time of his 1960 Flute, Brass, Vibes and
Percussion (Verve), his music utilized an eclectic array of Latin elements —
particularly Brazilian and Afro-Cuban.
Brazil Blues (United Artists) portrays another Mann collection of exotic
sounds (including xylophonelike marimba). Do the Bossa Nova (Atlantic)
helped hail the start of the national bossa craze, and Mann later diversified
his cultural base even farther on the ’70s albums Reggae (Atlantic) and Brazil:
Once Again (Atlantic).
176
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Mongo Santamaria
For his prolific output as a leader of his own bands and with countless other
musicians, Mongo Santamaria (1922–2003), a percussionist and composer,
deserves to be ranked among jazz’s top players. His compositional hits
include “Afro Blue” and “Parati,” both Latin jazz standards. Born in Havana,
Cuba, Santamaria came to New York City in 1950 and made a mark recording
Afro-Cuban jazz and playing with pianist George Shearing. He later worked
with Latin jazz leader/vibraphonist Cal Tjader as well as with Dizzy Gillespie,
Chick Corea (covered later in this chapter), Hubert Laws, even harmonica
monster Toots Thielemans.
Heat up to Santamaria’s rhythms on Afro-Roots (Prestige), At the Black Hawk
(Fantasy), Skins (Milestone), Soy Yo (Concord), and on Tito Puente’s Top
Percussion (BMG).
Let’s Get Funky: The Spicy 1970s
While many top creators of 1960s Latin jazz kept going strong into the 1970s
and 1980s, younger players came along with new hybrids. Latin rhythms,
especially the mambo, lent a strong influence to funk and soul jazz sounds of
the early 1970s. Meet the influential players of 1970s Latin jazz in the follow-
ing sections.
Chick Corea
Electric instruments used by jazzmen such as pianist Chick Corea (born
1941) added new twists to Latin jazz. Corea’s Light as a Feather (Polydor)
seamlessly merges electric jazz with the Brazilian rhythms of percussionist
Airto Moreira and wild exotic vocals of Flora Purim. Corea’s later album My
Spanish Heart (Polydor) carries a mellower, more romantic Latin vibe.
Chapter 8 has more information about Corea.
Catch Corea, who’s busier than ever and still loves using Latin rhythms and
sounds, on his 2006 CD The Ultimate Adventure (Stretch Records), inspired 
by a story written by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard (Corea is a
Scientology devotee).
177
Chapter 9: The Perfect Hybrid: Latin Jazz

Poncho Sanchez
Poncho Sanchez (born 1951) learned about Latin jazz under a master: Cal
Tjader. Sanchez performed as a member of Tjader’s band for several years
beginning in 1975, and he spiced up albums such as La Onda Va Bien
(Concord Picante) and Gozame! Pero Ya (Concord Picante). By the ’70s,
Sanchez was hailed as the successor on timbales to Tito Puente.
Sanchez began leading his own bands during the early 1980s, producing some
of the decade’s hottest Latin jazz. Papa Gato (Concord Picante), Fuerte!
(Concord Picante), Chile Con Soul (Concord Picante), Para Todos (Concord
Picante), and Soul Sauce: Memories of Cal Tjader (Concord Picante) are
among more recent winners by Sanchez. Today, Sanchez is in the prime of his
career. He continues to record a new album almost every year, including the
2005 Do It! (Concord) with Sanchez’s version of the song “Tin Tin Deo,” writ-
ten for Dizzy Gillespie by Chano Pozo.
Arturo Sandoval
A protégé of Dizzy Gillespie, Cuban-born trumpeter Arturo Sandoval (born
1949) began making hot Latin jazz in Cuba in the 1970s — first as a member of
the Orquesta Cubana de Musica Moderna (also including saxophonist and
clarinetist Paquito D’Rivera), then as part of Irakere, a leading Cuban jazz
ensemble. Sandoval plays Gillespie-like bebop over scintillating Latin rhythm.
Check out Danzon (UNI/GRP), Arturo Sandoval & the Latin Train (UNI/GRP),
No Problem (Jazz House), and Hot House (N2K), as well as dueling with his
mentor Dizzy on Gillespie’s To a Finland Station (Original Jazz Classics).
Latin Jazz: The New Generation
Because of CNN, MTV, and satellite communications, culture is becoming
more global and less regional. Different types of music from various parts of
the world spread quickly. For example, thanks to the 1999 documentary film
Buena Vista Social Club, and its accompanying CDs, a whole new group of
Americans learned about authentic Cuban music.
Latin jazz today covers a tremendous range of styles, influences, and artists,
from “Texas rumba” to “Latin jungle jazz,” mambo and South American 
varieties. Visit www.latinjazznet.com or www.latinjazzclub.com.
With America’s rapidly growing Latino population (one-third of California’s
178
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

population in 2005, for instance), advertisers, radio (including satellite and
Internet), and television (especially cable and satellite) offer all sorts of new
Latin content, including a variety of music.
Today, some players uphold the tradition of Cubop or bossa nova or other
styles from past decades, but new combinations of Latin rhythms, jazz styles,
and other influences exist. The following sections cover a few of the best
musicians of Latin jazz today.
Jerry Gonzalez
Jerry Gonzalez (born 1949), a top latter-day bebop trumpeter and also an
excellent percussionist, founded the Fort Apache Band, an innovative Latin
jazz ensemble that does tangy things to famous jazz tunes by players such as
pianist Thelonious Monk, saxophonist Wayne Shorter, trumpeter Miles Davis,
and other legendary figures.
To hear how Gonzalez builds on his vast appreciation of jazz dating back to
Louis Armstrong with his Puerto Rican/New York City roots and his experi-
ences with Tito Puente and Mongo Santamaria, get The River Is Deep (Enja),
Rhumba Para Monk (Sunnyside), Obatala (Enja), and Pensativo (Milestone).
Sergio Mendes
Beginning with Brasil ’66, Brazilian bandleader and keyboard player Sergio
Mendes (born 1941) celebrated streaks of commercial success in the United
States, but his big bands have also made some red hot music, combining
excellent arrangements with solid musicianship and a variety of Brazilian-
flavored vocals.
Mendes grew up in Rio de Janeiro during the prime of Bossa Nova (see
above). His Brazilian mentors were Antonio Carlos Jobim and Joao Gilberto,
and he heard American jazz greats like Stan Getz and Dizzy Gillespie when
they came to Brazil. His love of jazz was one reason he moved to the U.S. in
1964. He formed Brazil ’65 the following year, and continued through several
decades, changing the band’s name as time went by – Brazil ’66, Brazil ’77,
Brazil ’88.
Get Sergio Mendes and Brasil ’66 (A&M), his group’s first album, and the
Brasileiro (Elektra) from the ’90s — Mendes’ return to Brazilian roots after
years of straying into mild pop.

Danilo Perez
Danilo Perez (born 1966), a pianist, grew up in Panama studying classical
music and moved to the U.S. for college, first at Indiana University, then at
Berklee College of Music. His music is deeply steeped in Panama combines
the precision of classical performance with the improvisational spirit of
modern jazz. Check out Perez’ CD Motherland (Polygram), with tunes like
“Panafrica,” “Panama Libre,” and “Panama 2000.”
Gonzalo Rubalcaba
A young, promising pianist born in Havana, Cuba, in 1963, Gonzalo Rubalcaba
grew up listening to his father, pianist Guillermo Rubalcaba, and other Cuban
music, as well as jazz by Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, and other American
jazz legends. He studied classical music at a Cuban conservatory, and later
toured with Cuban big band Orquesta Aragon. He began his solo career in the
late 1980s and soon signed with Blue Note.
Hear Rubalcaba in peak form on Supernova (Blue Note), with a trio including
bass and drums, supported by three additional Latin percussionists.

Musicians of the Latin jazz world
The growing audience for Latin jazz means grow-
ing attention via awards programs such as the
Grammies. The Latin Grammy Hall of Fame
opened in 2001 and the list of inductees included
 Argentian composer and master of the
accordionlike bandoneon Astor Piazzolla
(1921–1992), whose passions included
tango as well as Rachmaninov and Bach.
 Brazilian composer and singer Caetano
Veloso, a driving force of ’60s tropicalia, a
new music that reflected a new genera-
tion’s rebellion against Brazil’s military dic-
tatorship in the ’60s.
 Antonio Carlos Jobim, whose music became
popular in America during the early ’60s by
Stan Getz.
 And early 20th century Latin musicians such
as Don Azpiazu, Carlos Gardel, Lucho
Gatica, Armando Manzanero, Perez Prado,
Santana, and Javier Solis.
For more info on the Latin Grammies, check out
the Web site at www.grammy.com/Latin.
Billboard magazine’s annual Latin Music
Awards program is also a great way to keep
tabs on new Latin jazz music. Visit www.bill
boardevents.com/billboardevents/
latin/index.jsp for more info.

Hilton Ruiz
Ruiz (born 1952) grew up in New York City playing classical music, jazz, and
Latin jazz. As a teen, he played in a Latin soul band; his jazz mentor was
pianist Mary Lou Williams.
Ruiz shows his range on recordings such as Manhattan Mambo (Telarc),
Hands on Percussion (Sony) with timbales king Tito Puente and Heroes
(Telarc) — a collection of jazz tunes by some of his heroes, such as Dizzy
Gillespie’s “Con Alma” and Herbie Hancock’s “Maiden Voyage.”
Chucho Valdes
Born in Cuba, this bandleader and pianist (born 1941) founded the Cuban 
jazz ensemble Irakere in the 1970s, and he also plays wonderful Afro-Cuban–
flavored jazz piano, inspired by jazz pianists Bill Evans, Art Tatum, and McCoy
Tyner. He won a Grammy in 1998 for the album Habana (Polygram) — his col-
laboration with trumpeter Roy Hargrove. It’s a prime example of Valdes’ own
take on Latin jazz, distinguished by his blindingly fast improvisations. Today,

Looking Ahead: The Present 
and Future of Jazz
In This Chapter
 Meeting traditionalist musicians
 Looking at artists combining jazz and classical music
 Surveying contemporary jazz forms
 Taking stock of the future
 Listening to jazz masters’ current work
A
s the new millennium approached, one thing became clear: artists no
longer felt bound by categories, and jazz became difficult to define. In
2005, Herbie Hancock, a beacon of creativity in hard bop, fusion, and jazz-
funk, released Possibilities, a CD on which he collaborated with pop stars
such as John Mayer, Santana, Paul Simon, and Sting. Is it jazz? Probably not,
but Hancock’s willingness to step outside the jazz box is indicative of the
increasing irrelevance of categories.
Traditionalists speak of jazz as “America’s classical music,” yet, as is the 
case in classical music, innovation is an essential quality of jazz. In order to
move forward, new jazz is not going to sound like old jazz. In a global, cross-
cultural society, artists find new ways of containing jazz within new musical
contexts.
Before you consider what the future may hold, look at the recent past. It’s 
too early to have a clear perspective on jazz in the nineties, but the decade
produced exceptional music. In many ways, it was also a generational turning
point. In the past, jazz’s living legends, like African griots (storytellers),
handed down jazz’s origins and traditions through their interactions with
younger musicians. But since the last edition of this book, many of those
“griots” have passed away: Benny Carter (2003), Lionel Hampton (2004), Milt
Hinton (2000), J.J. Johnson (2001), and Artie Shaw (2004).
With the loss of the last of its original legends, jazz is headed into a new era
where young players won’t have first-hand access to the genre’s original mas-
ters. As that direct connection vanishes, some traditions may fade, or revive

(with a twist); meanwhile, young musicians may feel freer to explore unfamil-
iar directions. Already, that’s happening. In this chapter, I introduce you to a
new generation of jazz musicians — those who are upholding established tra-
ditions and those who are infusing jazz with other musical styles.
Unfamiliar music may take some getting used to. Some of the music in this
chapter, when you have a chance to listen to it, may sound strange to you,
and you may not even like it. Over the years I have found that it’s essential 
to turn off your inner critic when you’re first exposed to new music. Some of
the more experimental music is more approachable in terms of feelings and
impressions, instead of established styles or conventions. In time, some of
the music you like best at first may later seem dull; while music that first
rubbed you the wrong way grows on you the more you listen to it.
Current Artists Keeping Jazz Traditions
Among the current generation of jazz musicians, many people believe that
the acoustic jazz of the ’40s and ’50s set the all-time standard. They’re not
fond of electric jazz or free jazz. They like songs with melodies, and they
prefer improvisations that relate to the melodies and chords of these songs.
It’s been interesting to hear how they re-interpret classic jazz tunes and com-
pose new music in the classic jazz tradition.
The neo-traditionalist instrumentalists
In the ’80s, Wynton Marsalis helped launch a revival of ’50s and ’60s jazz (I
cover Marsalis later in this chapter). He’s been joined by a new generation 
of players who are fresh voices within established traditions.
This new generation includes
 Bassists: Ben Allison, Avishai Cohen, Robert Hurst III, and Christian
McBride
 Drummers: Herlin Riley, Kenny Washington, Jeff “Tain” Watts, and Matt
Wilson
 Flutist: Nicole Mitchell
 Guitarists: Fareed Haque, Kurt Rosenwinkel, and Mark Whitfield
 Percussionist: Hamid Drake
 Pianists: Vijay Iyer, Kenny Kirkland, Brad Mehldau, Jason Moran, Danilo
Perez, and Marcus Roberts
184
Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

 Saxophonists: Eric Alexander, Seamus Blake, Jane Bunnett, James Carter,
Claire Daly (a rare baritone specialist), Kenny Garrett, Branford Marsalis
(Wynton’s brother), Greg Osby, Evan Parker, Chris Potter, Steve Wilson,
and Miguel Zenón
 Trombonist: Josh Roseman
 Trumpeters: Terence Blanchard, Dave Douglas, Roy Hargrove, Ingrid
Jensen, Jeremy Pelt, and Wallace Roney
 Vibraphonist: Joe Locke
Choosing favorites is purely subjective and guaranteed to make someone
upset, but the following sections contain a few more good bets from the up-
and-comers.
Ravi Coltrane
One of the most promising players is Ravi Coltrane (born 1965), named by his
father John Coltrane after Indian sitar master Ravi Shankar. Coltrane is about
the same age as Wynton Marsalis, but he’s a late bloomer just hitting his
stride.
Like his father (see Chapter 8 for more about John), Ravi specializes in
soprano and tenor saxophones, and he composes his own music. His fourth
album, In Flux, came out in 2005 and earned his best reviews yet for the 
compositions, for his playing, and for his ability (like his father’s) to create
chemistry within the group.
Coltrane’s sound is a mix of his father’s cries, shrieks, and whispers, and a
subtler, gentler melodic approach reminiscent of earlier tenors. In the summer
of 2005, Ravi Coltrane took a challenging step. He played the JVC Jazz Festival
(see Chapter 14) with his father’s onetime pianist, McCoy Tyner, and their
excellent performance provoked eerie (but good) memories of his father’s
music.
Stefon Harris
Stefon Harris has good vibes, literally. He’s a vibraphonist and xylophonist —
heir apparent to mallet masters before him such as Gary Burton, Lionel
Hampton, Bobby Hutcherson, Milt Jackson, and Red Norvo.
Harris has a bachelor’s degree in classical music and a master’s degree in
jazz, so his music spans the distance between brainy and bluesy. He’s recog-
nized as both a prolific composer and a phenomenal (and phenomenally fast)
player. He’s been known to leave a cloud of red dust behind after his red-
tipped mallets attack the vibraphone’s metal bars, and he sometimes lines 
up both a xylophone and vibraphone, doubling his playing field and energiz-
ing the stage as he leaps great distances in a single bound.
185
Chapter 10: Looking Ahead: The Present and Future of Jazz

Harris’ music ranges from traditional to Latin to experimental and from a
plethora of originals to remakes of tunes ranging from “Summertime” to
“There Is No Greater Love.” Most of all, Harris sounds like a postmodern
bebopper, refining the rapid lines invented by Charlie Parker and others
during the ’40s. Check out Chapter 7 for more about bebop.
Harris’ CDs Black Action Figure and The Grand Unification Theory were both
nominated for Grammies. The second one sweeps through 11 movements
and incorporates elements of African, Latin, classical, and jazz music.
Charlie Hunter
If you like the grooving sound of 1960s giants like guitarist Wes Montgomery
and organist Jimmy Smith, you may like Charlie Hunter’s funked out jazz.
Hunter is a multi-tasking extraordinaire: He plays bass lines, pianolike chords,
and melodic guitar lines all at once, using a special eight-string guitar.
Hunter began playing at the age of 12, and in his teens, he studied with elec-
tric guitar wiz Joe Satriani. He played blues, funk, rockabilly, and soul before
discovering jazz at 18, working his way backward from Wes Montgomery to
jazz guitar pioneer Charlie Christian (see Chapter 6 for more about him), with
plenty of blues and soul along the way.
In 1993, Hunter was in the band Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, which
opened stadium shows for U2. Settling into a blues/soul/jazz sound of his
own through regular gigs with his band in the San Francisco Bay Area, Hunter
was signed to Blue Note Records. At first, critics labeled his music “acid jazz”
(see “What is acid jazz, man?” later in this chapter), but Hunter considers
himself a part of the jazz tradition going back to Louis Armstrong (see
Chapter 5) and Charlie Parker (see Chapter 7).
Hunter’s Steady Groovin’ (Blue Note) is a CD that sounds great cranked up on
your stereo with the mega-bass. Get blown away by the sound of one man
wielding his broad-necked ax. Another pick is Natty Dread (Blue Note) —
Hunter’s groove/jazz reincarnation of Bob Marley.
Chris Speed
These days, people think of the clarinet as a fossil from jazz’s dinosaur 
age, but Chris Speed (who also plays tenor sax) is spearheading the instru-
ment’s revival. Speed was born in Seattle and studied at the New England
Conservatory of Music in Boston before going pro with various bands.
Speed grew up with classical music, and his music also draws from funk, free
jazz, Middle Eastern music, and modern rock. Speed exemplifies the new gen-
eration of musicians who create music outside of jazz’s earlier traditions.

Jazz’s vocal resurgence
During jazz’s Golden Age, which is how some folks refer to the big band era of
the 1930s and early 1940s (see Chapter 6), jazz singers took center stage:
 Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra in a “sweet” vein
 Joe Williams and Jimmy Rushing in a bluesy Kansas City style
 Jon Hendricks, bebopper
 Billie Holiday, Helen Forrest, Ella Fitzgerald, and Sarah Vaughan, great
ladies of swing and scat-singing
Today’s best jazz vocalists are both inventive interpreters of great lyrics and
melodies, and muscular improvisers.
The gals
After recording CDs devoted to the music of Bill Evans (Blue in Green) and
Frank Sinatra (Dancing in the Dark), Tierney Sutton stretches out on her 2005
release I’m With the Band, presenting deeply personal readings of tunes
including “‘S Wonderful,” “Surrey with the Fringe On Top,” and “What a Little
Moonlight Will Do.” Along the way, she swaps solos with her bandmates as an
instrumental equal. Sutton’s voice is subtle, airy, and clear, and she has an
irresistible sense of swing.
The current she-generation also includes passionate Brazilian Luciana Souza;
Billie Holiday–influenced Madeleine Peyroux; and risk-taker Cassandra
Wilson, whose career thus far has ranged from freeform funk to bebop impro-
visation, and whose supple voice does justice to unconventional song selec-
tions ranging from Neil Young to Son House and even the Monkees.
The guys
On the he-side, Kurt Elling merges scat-singing and other vocal inventions
with standard jazz tunes and Beat poetry. Andy Bey is a late-bloomer with an
operatic range who breathes new life into familiar standards. Jamie Cullum is
the wild kid with a jazz-caliber voice and a repertoire that merges jazz, classi-
cal, blues, hip-hop, dance, and pop.
Women taking over the jazz world
At this point, for the first time, women stand out as great jazz players, not just
women jazz players. At last, a slew of women are building on the foundation
established by female jazz musicians including pianists Carla Bley, Lil Hardin
(Louis Armstrong’s wife), Marian McPartland, and Mary Lou Williams, and
trumpeter Clora Bryant.
187
Chapter 10: Looking Ahead: The Present and Future of Jazz

These days, Downbeat magazine’s annual Critic’s Poll is full of female instru-
mentalists:
 Baritone saxophonist: Claire Daly
 Bassist: Joëlle Léandre
 Drummers: Terri Lynn Carrington and Allison Miller
 Flutists: Holly Hofmann, Nicole Mitchell, Anne Drummond, and Ali
Ryerson
 Guitarist: Mimi Fox
 Organist: Barbara Dennerlein
 Percussionist: Susie Ibarra
 Soprano saxophonists: Jane Ira Bloom and Jane Bunnett
 Trumpeter: Ingrid Jensen
 Violinist: Jenny Scheinman
One of the most prolific and versatile women of jazz is composer and big
bandleader, Maria Schneider. Schneider moved from Minnesota to New 
York City to launch her career in 1985. She studied composition with Bob
Brookmeyer and served as an assistant to composer/arranger Gil Evans, 
conducting several of his pieces. Now the Maria Schneider Jazz Orchestra is
one of jazz’s finest big bands, and Schneider is considered one of jazz’s top
composers and bandleaders.
Schneider earned a Grammy in 2005 for the album Concert in the Garden
(Artist-Track), a melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic feast that has been com-
pared with sweeping Hollywood film scores.
Jazz Fusing with Classical Music
Currently most jazz musicians enter the profession with college degrees;
many of them have a serious working knowledge of both jazz and classical
music. They’ve grown up playing both varieties and many of them pursue
both genres — or explore fresh mergers of the two.
Wynton Marsalis leads the way
In the 1980s, trumpeter Wynton Marsalis (see Figure 10-1) staked his ground
as keeper of the bebop/hard bop flame and as a critic of electric jazz, pop
jazz, or jazz that departs from core values as set forth in the 1920s through
early 1960s.
188

Marsalis began his career as a member of Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers. On
his major-label debut album, he used Miles Davis’ rhythm section of pianist
Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter, and drummer Tony Williams. Since then
Marsalis has led a succession of young bands that adhere to the driving
unplugged sound of the 50s and 60s with strong standard tunes and new 
originals providing the context for excellent improvisations.
Marsalis composes, plays, and records classical music as well as jazz. As
artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center since 1997, Marsalis has almost
single-handedly elevated jazz in America to the status of classical music. Just
the fact of jazz being performed regularly at one of the nation’s most presti-
gious concert halls is significant because it was traditionally relegated to
smoky clubs. Marsalis has done more than any contemporary jazz musicians
to earn the same respect for jazz as classical music has always received. A
sign of the crossover between categories came in 1983 when Marsalis became
the first artist to win Grammies in both genres.
Marsalis has also expanded the range of a “jazz” artist. In recent years, his
projects have included a score for Sweet Release, a ballet staged by Alvin
Ailey American Dance Theatre; and At the Octoroon Balls, inspired by African-
American history and performed by the classical Orion String Quartet with
the Chamber Music Society of the Lincoln Center.

In 2002, Marsalis released the CD All Rise, a 12-part composition (inspired by
the 12-bar structure of blues) commissioned by the New York Philharmonic
with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra and Morgan State University Choir.
Live performances of All Rise received reviews that praised the successful
marriage of classical orchestra with jazz ensemble.
Earlier jazz geniuses like Scott Joplin (see Chapter 5) and Duke Ellington (see
Chapter 6) composed similarly ambitious works. The difference now is that
Marsalis, as an African-American jazz artist, has the status among American
artists to get his works produced and presented in top-notch venues.
Other recent jazz and classical connections
Jazz players today often reinvent great classical compositions as jazz 
pieces. Classical music offers amazing melodies and challenging harmonies.
Compositions by great composers provide an inspiring framework for impro-
visation, and it’s intriguing to see how jazz musicians invent new music
around the classics.
The Classical Jazz Quartet
The Classical Jazz Quartet presents cross-pollination between jazz and 
classical music. The group consists of prominent jazz players Kenny Barron
(piano), Ron Carter (bass), Stefon Harris (vibraphone), and Lewis Nash
(drums).
On their CD Nutcracker (Vertical Jazz), the group gives an eight-song tribute
to Tchaikovsky’s famous piece. The traditional ballet’s tale of Clara, a magical
nutcracker, and toys that come to life is re-imagined by Belden as the story of
a modern prince who sweeps his girl away to a happening jazz club. Within
the music, Tchaikovsky’s melodies appear and also serve as a point of depar-
ture for improvisations inspired by the original composition.
Marc O’Connor
Violinist Marc O’Connor is part of the new generation of musicians who don’t
feel restricted by conventional genres. In 2005, he released Hot Swing Live in
New York (Omac), his third CD in the tradition of his mentor, violinist Stephane
Grappelli. This swing is the vintage swing that was popular at Paris’s popular
Hot Club of France during the 1930s — one of the rare instances where a violin-
ist became a jazz legend. O’Connor also collaborated with classical cellist Yo-
Yo Ma on sweeping cross-cultural recordings such as Appalachia Waltz (Sony),
and in 2005 released Double Violin Concerto (Omac), an original composition.
To hear O’Connor improvise is to hear bluegrass, classical, and jazz seamlessly
combine.

Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Lalo Schifrin
Another critically acclaimed genre-buster is pianist and conductor Lalo
Schifrin. His most notable work is his Jazz Meets the Symphony CDs. The 
sixth installment, released in 2005, includes ten Schifrin compositions that
reflect an array of influences: “Bachianas Brasilerias No. 5,” “Jazzette,” 
“Salón México,” and “Cincinnati Kid.”
Born in Argentina in 1932, Schifrin moved to New York in 1958 and was in
Dizzy Gillespie’s Quintet from 1960 to 1962. His recent focus on capturing the
essence of jazz within a classical context is another new twist. Although the
music is completely composed (not improvised) it maintains jazz’s spontane-
ity — the sense that it is being created on the spot.
Considering Contemporary Jazz
Jazz emerges in various forms of popular music. Acid jazz, invented in
London clubs, uses jazz rhythms (and sometimes borrows bass lines or other
musical excerpts from ’60s and ’70s jazz recordings). Smooth jazz uses jazz
rhythms and includes some improvisation, but it’s better for setting a mood
than for serious listening. The popularity of smooth jazz radio stations during
the ’80s and ’90s introduced many listeners to jazz and led them to other,
more challenging forms of the music.
191
Chapter 10: Looking Ahead: The Present and Future of Jazz
College grad or road warrior?
In the old days 99.9 percent of jazz musicians
mastered their art on the bandstand and on the
road, playing night after night and spending time
with fellow musicians who schooled them in
music — the personal passing down of jazz tra-
dition. Today, most jazz players possess a degree
in music, sometimes from schools such as
Berklee, Juilliard, and Columbia, where the cur-
riculum includes history, theory, and exposure to
many types of music — in addition to actually
playing music.
The struggle to master an instrument is univer-
sal, but this newer approach to jazz is different.
Some people believe that a portion of the power
of jazz from the 1920s through 1950s came from
the challenging lives lived by artists who faced
prejudice, poverty, and addiction. Jazz musicians
like Chet Baker, Miles Davis, and Charlie Parker
exorcised demons with music, and the emotional
heat was tangible. It’s also true that financially
secure, college-educated players make some of
the fieriest jazz if they can dip into their deepest
thoughts, fears, and feelings.
Players today face challenges of their own: the
greatest of which may be redefining jazz and
taking it in fresh directions after nearly 100 years
of inspired innovation. A college education adds
the possibility of composing, arranging, educat-
ing, and performing in a variety of combinations
and contexts. In the future, it’s likely the “jazz”
musician won’t exist, only musicians who incor-
porate jazz history and principles into artistically
free careers. See Chapter 15 for more details
about the study of jazz in college.

What is acid jazz, man?
The term acid jazz, born in London and designed for moving and grooving,
was coined by dance club deejays and refers to music that combines jazz,
soul, funk, and even contemporary hip-hop. Some acid jazz blends in seg-
ments, or samples, from earlier recordings. An acid jazz artist may extract 
a funky bass part from a 1970s piece, tweak it electronically so you don’t 
recognize it, and build a new song on top with layers of instrumentation
(sometimes synthesized).
Much of acid jazz draws from funky jazz from the ’60s and ’70s. Acid jazz isn’t
genuine jazz because it doesn’t emphasize improvisation; it doesn’t swing
like jazz does; it doesn’t feature soloists with strong original voices:
 Guitarist: Grant Green
 Organist: Charles Earland
 Saxophonists: Houston Person and Lou Donaldson
 Trumpeters: Donald Byrd and Miles Davis
 Vibraphonist: Roy Ayers
If you’ve never sampled acid jazz, find one of several compilation CDs on dif-
ferent record labels:
 BGP
 Instinct
 Irma
 PGD/Hollywood
 Ubiquity
Look for the following acid jazz artists:
 A Tribe Called Quest
 Brand New Heavies
 Chris Bowden
 Count Basic
 Digable Planets
 EM&I
 Galliano
 Gang Starr and Tribe
 Greyboy

Is “smooth jazz” really jazz?
In the ’90s, a mild brand of instrumental music became popular on FM radio
stations. The stations promoted it as smooth jazz, but serious jazz fans don’t
consider it jazz. Many smooth jazz artists are fine players, and some of the
music is extremely appealing with melodic, funky, or romantic tones. But
most smooth jazz lacks jazz’s essential qualities as discussed in Chapter 2.
In short, smooth jazz often doesn’t have the rhythmic, syncopated drive
known as swing, and it also doesn’t include much improvisation. Additionally,
in their attempt to make simple, pleasant sounds, the players don’t allow
themselves to find their own individual voices, as the best players do in jazz.
With that said, however, nothing is wrong with liking smooth jazz. Music that
furthers interest in jazz and explores other players under the “jazz” heading
is good for the overall health of jazz.
Jazz on the Edge and into the Future
Going back to pianist Lennie Tristrano’s experiments with free-form improvisa-
tion during the late ’40s, some jazz musicians have put their energies into
making experimental music based on some of jazz’s principles. This music may
include swing and improvisation, but it may also include computers and elec-
tronic sound processing. Composers with roots in jazz are taking the music 
to new places. Some, for instance, create full-length operas. The difference
between these operas and the ones written by Scott Joplin and his peers
during the 1920s is that today’s jazz operas are actually being produced.
The following sections cover many of jazz’s artists who continue to push the
envelope of technology.

Chapter 10: Looking Ahead: The Present and Future of Jazz

George Lewis
George Lewis is my idea of an artist who maximizes the present and visual-
izes the future. He’s an author, composer, improviser, researcher, and trom-
bonist who also uses computers and computer software to make music. He
joined the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians in Chicago
in the 1970s, collaborated with free jazzer Anthony Braxton, and worked with
avant garde musicians Derek Bailey, Lester, Roscoe Mitchell, and John Zorn
(see Chapter 8 for more about free and avant garde jazz). Lewis also plunged
into computers and software to create interactive electronic music (a com-
puter responds to what he plays, and he responds to what the computer
“plays”), and he teamed with filmmakers and video artists to produce perfor-
mance pieces that combined music with projected visuals.
Lewis’s recordings include
 Conversations
 Endless Shout
 The Shadowgraph Series: Compositions for Creative Orchestra
 Voyager
For a look at one of music’s experimental laboratories, visit the Web site for
France’s Ircam (www.ircam.fr), where Lewis and other artists go to explore
new ways of making music, particularly by using new technology and com-
plex software.
Anthony Davis
George Lewis’s friend and sometime-collaborator, pianist Anthony Davis, is
another jazz musician moving beyond the old boundaries. Davis’s early
career included free jazz with Lewis, Anthony Braxton, and Oliver Lake, but
he has become known as the composer of experimental operas like X, The
Life and Times of Malcolm X, and Amistad, as well as music for Broadway pro-
ductions including Tony Kushner’s Angels in America: Millenium Approaches.
Lewis (at Columbia University) and Davis (at the University of California San
Diego) are full-time professors as well as internationally respected artists,
which means that they’re providing an incredible range of creative options 
to budding musicians.

Part II: Jazz Greats and Great Jazz: An Evolutionary Riff 

Other musicians
Other musicians who are pushing jazz into new unmapped territories include
the following:
 Bassist: Mark Dresser seizes the moment and improvises from whatever
he’s feeling at a particular moment. He believes that music is a summa-
tion of all the elements that come together at a point in time.
 Flutist: Mathias Ziegler combines jazz and classical sounds with a lot of
improvisation and uses special flutes that divide a musical scale into
quarter-tones — notes that fall in between the notes in a traditional
scale.
 Guitarists: Marc Ribot’s sound ranges from technically amazing to inten-
tionally raw; Bill Frisell and Derek Bailey use electronic equipment and
add squeaks, taps, and mechanical sounds to their playing.
 Mezzo-soprano: Alexandra Montano’s musical influences range from
Medieval and Renaissance music to opera. She sings pieces that range
from new classical music to improvised free jazz.
 Pianists: Myra Melford, a professor at U.C. Berkeley, combines jazz with
Indian music and instruments such as harmonium, and her music is
largely improvised. Denman Maroney is an improviser who plays what
he feels.
John Zorn’s Tzadik label has some of the most far-out, genre-bending music
you can wrap your ears around (www.tzadik.com).
Living Jazz Masters
While young upstarts offer hope for the future of jazz, some of the best jazz
today comes from living legends and seasoned professionals. These players
range in age from 40 to 80 and have survived jazz’s brutal coming of age and
are currently in their prime. Here are a few personal favorites and a sug-
gested CD by each of them:
 Howard Alden and Jimmy Bruno, Full Circle (Concord)
 Michael Brecker, Two Blocks from the Edge (Impulse!)
 Randy Brecker, Into the Sun (Concord)

T
he impact of jazz on American culture is undeniable, though you may not
even realize it. From films and novels, to advertising, fashion, and even
language, aspects of jazz filter out to the masses. In this chapter you look at
the ways in which jazz has permeated pop culture over the past 100 years,
from slang and film, to fiction and fashion. I want to give credit to the music
and the musicians for whatever coolness, hipness, and tastefulness they’ve
imparted to our nation over the years!
On the Silver Screen: Jazz on Film
Until the ’50s, jazz’s role in American films was primarily in the form of cameo
appearances in nightclub and party scenes; early portrayals of jazz musicians
helped sustain negative stereotypes. Jazz players weren’t featured as main
characters, and the music selected was generally mainstream. In the ’50s,
though, films such as Young Man with a Horn began to treat jazz and jazz per-
formers as legitimate artistic subject matter. In the following sections, find
out how films portrayed jazz and jazz musicians over time.

Casting Louis Armstrong in the beginning
Louis Armstrong made his most important music in the 1920s (see Chapter 5
for details), but he became a star in the 1930s through films that cast him as a
stereotypical black entertainer, on hand to provide a lighter interlude, but
not as a serious artist or actor. Lead roles went to white actors.
To some extent, the film roles represented Armstrong’s public persona as
required by a segregated society of that time. In live performance, he camped it
up just as much as on film. Many jazz fans feel that as a jazz musician, his most
important years were the 1920s, and thereafter Armstrong became a main-
stream entertainer more than a jazz innovator. While some African-American
critics feel that Armstrong sold out by taking roles as the always-happy black
entertainer, he was still one of the first black actors to be prominently featured.
Even if his performances on film were more Broadway shtick than serious jazz,
the appearance of a prominent jazz trumpeter on screen brought jazz into the
American mainstream. I cover some of Armstrong’s film roles in the following
sections.
A Rhapsody in Black and Blue
In the 1932 short film A Rhapsody in Black and Blue, Armstrong appears 
in a black man’s dream. The dream unfolds after the man, distracted from 
his household chores by Armstrong’s music, is knocked unconscious by 
his demanding wife. In the dream, Armstrong plays trumpet in a nightclub,
dressed in a leopard skin — a typical portrayal of a black man in those 
times as primitive and naïve.
Pennies from Heaven
In the 1936 film Pennies from Heaven, starring Bing Crosby, Armstrong plays 
a musician who negotiates a poor contract for himself, then sings the tune
“Skeleton in the Closet” as a skeleton chases him. On one level, this can be
seen as a fantasy or bad dream. On another, the image of a black man being
chased by a skeleton verged on the slapstick approach of minstrel shows in
which blacks were cast as buffoons.
Going Places
Armstrong often hammed it up like a clownish minstrel performer on film,
speaking throwaway lines, making faces, widening his eyes in exaggerated
amazement. In the 1938 film Going Places, Armstrong plays the groom of a
racehorse, a disappointing role that has him serenading the horse but not
interacting significantly with human characters. Again, Armstrong’s appear-
ance was a mixed blessing for jazz. Audiences saw a famous black musician in
a prominent part, introducing him to new audiences. But he could have had a
much more positive impact had he been cast as a hero.

Hello, Dolly!
Even Armstrong’s popular performance in Hello, Dolly! (1969) portrayed the
stereotypical black simpleton, making the white folks smile. At least in this
case, he co-starred with Carol Channing. Casting Armstrong alongside a white
entertainer was a step up from the old cliché of a black performer hamming 
it up for a white audience. The 1960s were a transitional time; in the 1950s,
black musicians weren’t cast as the equals of whites. Hello, Dolly! marked a
step in the right direction.
The title song summed up the pros and cons of Armstrong’s role. While the
song is a pop show number made for entertainment purposes, Armstrong’s
version gives it a jazz flavor. His gruff, friendly vocal style is quite different
than the usual smooth Broadway delivery, and he even manages to scat-sing
a few bars — one of the rare instances when jazz improvisation infiltrates a
show tune. Whether they knew it or not, American audiences were getting a
good shot of jazz with their entertainment.
Chronicling jazz musicians’ lives
Is there a genuine jazz film? One that makes authentic jazz its centerpiece
instead of a decoration? The short answer is yes, from Kirk Douglas’s trum-
peter role in Young Man with a Horn (1950) to Dexter Gordon’s emigrant saxo-
phonist in Round Midnight (1986) and a fading Chet Baker in the documentary
Let’s Get Lost (1988). The time between the Douglas and Gordon films gives a
window on social progress. It was the time it took to move from a white actor
playing a jazz musician, to a black actor and jazz musician giving a very real
portrayal of jazz music and a life in jazz. After Douglas portrayed an expatri-
ate jazz musician, Gordon actually was one.
In the following sections, I cover a few feature films and documentaries that
shed light on the lives of jazz musicians.
Hollywood feature films
In the 1950s, Hollywood, always looking for the latest cultural trend, latched
onto jazz. Boosted by pianist Dave Brubeck’s 1954 appearance on the cover
of Time magazine and other coverage of jazz, jazz musicians became the 
’50s equivalent of ’60s hippie rock musicians. At the same time, jazz began 
to turn up on soundtracks for films such as On the Waterfront, starring Marlon
Brando. The time was right for films (like the following) that took jazz as sub-
ject matter instead of just background color.
 Young Man with A Horn: This film, partially inspired by the tragic life
of trumpeter Bix Beiderbecke (see Chapter 5), features captivating
black-and-white images, good music, and a story that gets to the heart 
of a jazz musician’s struggles as a marginalized artist. Kirk Douglas, as
trumpeter Rick Martin, is torn between the music he makes as deeply
201
Chapter 11: Mass Appeal: Taking Note of Jazz in Popular Culture

personal art and the music he makes to earn a buck. When he duets with
Doris Day and departs from the score to improvise a few catchy lines,
the conductor tells Douglas to stick with what’s written.
 The Benny Goodman Story: Steve Allen in The Benny Goodman Story
(1955) barely scratches the surface of what it means to live a life in jazz.
The music here is excellent (the soundtrack is actually Goodman), but
important facts about Goodman’s career are left out of this Hollywood
tale of a star player’s rise to fame and fortune with his 1938 performance
at Carnegie Hall as the climax (well, that much is true). Goodman’s child-
hood poverty, his black heroes like clarinetist Jimmie Noone, his experi-
ences learning jazz from leading black jazz musicians, his hiring of black
arranger Fletcher Henderson to heat up the Goodman band’s sound, his
gutsy integration of his band — important turning points like these are
mostly missing. Instead of showing late nights, uncomfortable bus rides,
bad food, and unscrupulous promoters, this movie is a sanitized version
of jazz. I cover Goodman in detail in Chapter 6.
 Round Midnight: For me, the modern film that cuts closest to the core
of what a jazzman’s life is probably like is Bertrand Tavernier’s Round
Midnight, with the laconic, chain-smoking, musically brilliant saxophon-
ist Dexter Gordon in the lead role. Gordon says more with actions than
words. When he performs, you can tell immediately that this is a jazz
musician playing jazz, not an actor. Here’s a world-weary artist living one
moment at a time. You get the sense that in a career in jazz, nothing can
surprise him. One major downside to casting actors as jazz musicians is
that no matter how much they try, their technique never looks quite
right (see Sean Penn in Sweet and Lowdown). See Chapter 7 for more
about Gordon.
 Bird: For comparison’s sake, Tavernier’s film, with both Dexter Gordon
and his music, is more infused with jazz than Clint Eastwood’s 1988 Bird,
with Forest Whitaker playing Charlie “Yardbird” Parker (who I cover in
Chapter 7). But Bird still ranks as the best contemporary jazz film, com-
bining excellent music and acting with a compelling story crafted from
the ups and downs of Parker’s life.
 Kansas City: This movie (1996) has some great music and great period
costumes and settings. Given Robert Altman’s reputation for sponta-
neous filmmaking, it’s surprising that he didn’t do more with the wealth
of jazz talent on hand (more than a dozen top players, including bassist
Ron Carter, trumpeter Nicholas Payton, and vocalist Kevin Mahogany).
Someone still needs to make a Hollywood film set amid Kansas City jazz,
although this movie had a positive effect by bringing jazz to a mass audi-
ence for jazz.
Documentaries
More than Hollywood feature films, several fine documentaries offer unflinch-
ing portrayals of jazz and its heroes. My favorite examples include
202
Part III: The Beat Goes On: Jazz Appreciation 101 

 Bix Beiderbecke: This thorough documentary (1981) does an impres-
sive job showing how the genius trumpeter made his huge contribution
before dying at age 28. First-hand interviews with musical peers includ-
ing Hoagy Carmichael add credibility, and period photos capture the
flavor of the life, times, cities, and clubs inhabited by Beiderbecke.
 Let’s Get Lost: Director Bruce Weber’s 1988 intimate look at Chet Baker
in his final days is both tragic and inspiring. Baker was never able to kick
his junkie lifestyle and appears here as a bleary-eyed, toothless shadow
of his younger handsome self. However, his trumpet playing and his
heart-rending singing, along with Weber’s gorgeous black-and-white
imagery, sweep you away into the dreamy world of a real-life jazz legend.
See Chapter 7 for more about Baker.
 Jazz: Ken Burns’s ambitious series for public television (2001), available
on DVD, gives his typically romantic, sweeping portrayal of history, with
great interviews, period music, and hundreds of rare photographs. Some
jazz fans, though, were disappointed that he barely mentioned any jazz
made after the early ’60s.
Other films worth checking out
Here are some other documentaries and performance films that pulse with
authentic jazz: Jammin’ the Blues (Lester Young and other greats); Jazz on a
Summer’s Day (Louis Armstrong, Anita O’Day, Monk and others); Jazz ’34
(James Carter, Joshua Redman and other current jazz greats perform classic
jazz); Lush Life (composer Billy Strayhorn); The Sound of Jazz (Count Basie,
Coleman Hawkins and others); Straight, No Chaser (pianist Thelonious Monk).
Add to these Art Blakey: The Jazz Messenger; Celebrating Bird; Jackie McLean
on Mars; Jazz on the West Coast; Charles Mingus: Triumph of the Underdog; My
Name is Albert Ayler; and Mystery, Mister Ra (Sun Ra). Appendix C has more
information about these and other jazz films.
Using jazz in soundtracks
In another variation on the Hollywood-Jazz connection, a number of films
make extensive use of jazz on their soundtracks or have jazz scores com-
posed by jazz greats. These films’ soundtracks include the following:
 Anatomy of a Murder: Duke Ellington’s music on the soundtrack for
this movie (1959) by director Otto Preminger was praised for perfectly
complementing the mood of this black-and-white courtroom drama. For
more information on Duke Ellington, see Chapter 6.
 The Man with the Golden Arm: Famed film composer Elmer Bernstein
wrote the jazz-flavored score for The Man with the Golden Arm (1955),
starring Frank Sinatra as a card dealer who dreams of being a jazz drum-
mer but is sidetracked by his drug addiction and manipulative wife.
203
Chapter 11: Mass Appeal: Taking Note of Jazz in Popular Culture

 Ascenseur pour l’Echafaud: Miles Davis and a group including drum-
mer Kenny Clarke and three European players improvised the moody,
brooding score that perfectly suits Ascenseur pour l’Echafaud (1958), a
black-and-white French film directed by Louis Malle. Recorded around
the same time as Davis’s Kind of Blue album, the soundtrack is symbolic
of the fact that many famous modern American jazz musicians have
been more celebrated in Europe than at home. After all, Davis wasn’t
commissioned to score any American films.
 Blow Up: Miles Davis’s protégé, pianist Herbie Hancock (see Chapter 8),
composed the music for this French film (1966) by Michel Antonioni.
 Breathless: Another great example of jazz combined with an electrifying
film is Martial Solal’s score for Jean-Luc Godard’s Breathless (1960),
about a young couple on an adrenaline rush of a road trip. Solal’s music
was inspired by great jazz pianists such as Erroll Garner, Thelonious
Monk, Oscar Peterson, Bud Powell, Art Tatum, and Lennie Tristano.
 Taxi Driver: Famed film composer Bernard Herrmann, best known 
for scoring Hitchcock films like Vertigo and Psycho, also wrote the jazz
score for Martin Scorcese’s Taxi Driver (1976), and the spare saxophone-
centered music is the perfect accompaniment to the main character’s
unraveling mental state as he cruises the seedy underside of New York
City in his Checker cab.
 Rosewood: More recently, trumpeter Wynton Marsalis (see Chapter 10)
composed a score for the John Singleton film Rosewood (1997), about
the 1923 torching of a black town in Florida by a mob of white people.
The combination of jazz with prejudice makes a telling combination.
Among the many soundtracks, no one else has produced as many jazz sound-
tracks as Woody Allen. He’s famous (among other reasons) for using jazz in
his films. Composer, arranger, and jazz pianist Dick Hyman serves as his
musical director for Zelig (1983), Stardust Memories (1980), Radio Days (1987),
and Sweet and Lowdown (1999).
Sean Penn starred in Sweet and Lowdown as the jazz guitarist character partly
based on the great Belgian gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt. Reinhardt
and French violinist Stephane Grappelli were famous for their performances
together in the late 1930s and early 1940s. They made the Hot Club of France
famous, and popular swing revival bands today like the Hot Club of Cowtown
(from Texas) pay homage to Django.
For many years no trip to New York City was complete without a stop to hear
Woody playing clarinet on Monday nights, most recently at The Carlyle at
Madison Avenue and 76th Street. Allen is a decent musician, and you can also
see him perform on film in the documentary Wild Man Blues — named for the
famous tune written by Louis Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton.

Setting movie cartoons to jazz
Jazz’s influence on American culture hit a high in the mid-1920s as jazz went
mainstream through the popular image of the flapper girl in a short dress and
headband, dancing the Charleston with a tuxedoed guy packing Prohibition-
era bootleg liquor in a hip flask. Jazz was American music, and the Jazz Age
marked America’s modern era, setting it apart from European influences (in
music, art, architecture, and so on) that had dominated Victorian times.
Saturday matinee movies in the 1920s were double features with a cartoon in
between. Tapping into pop culture, these cartoons were often set to jazz. New
and upbeat, jazz lent the cartoons a hip pedigree, aligning them with modern
architecture and fashion. Jazz’s syncopated rhythms were perfect for cartoon
action sequences depicting fights, factories, or fast trains.
Cartoonist Max Fleischer’s famous Betty Boop character was based on flap-
pers, and he set the cartoons to swing jazz by Cab Calloway, Don Redman,
and others. Caricatures of Calloway (as a walrus) appear with Boop in
Talkertoon and Minnie the Moocher (Calloway co-wrote the famous song from
which the cartoon takes it title). In another cartoon Fleischer also had Betty
sing a duet with Louis Armstrong on his tune “I’ll Be Glad When You’re Dead
You Rascal You.”
Cartoons by Max and Dave Fleischer moved to the music of many famous
jazz groups:
 The Boswell Sisters in Sleepy Time Down South (1932)
 Cab Calloway’s Minnie the Moocher (1932)
 Albert Ammons in Boogie Doodle (1948)
 Oscar Peterson in Begone Dull Care (1949)
In the 1940s, composer Raymond Scott’s music, especially the tune
“Powerhouse,” was used for cartoon action sequences. Scott’s music
appeared in several classic Looney Tunes cartoons and more recently in The
Simpsons and Ren and Stimpy.
While there’s no direct evidence showing that moviegoers heard or bought
more jazz because of cartoons, these animated shorts were a vital part of the
pop culture that brought jazz to millions of Americans who may not have
heard much jazz otherwise.
Beyond conventional cartoons, several animated art films offer innovative
use of jazz, such as John and Faith Hubley’s Harlem Wednesday (1958), which
strings together paintings by Gregorio Prestopino and music by composer
and jazz saxophonist Benny Carter for a wildly inventive portrayal of a day in
the life of Harlem.
205
Chapter 11: Mass Appeal: Taking Note of Jazz in Popular Culture

This and other films by the Hubleys, with music by Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy
Gillespie, Lionel Hampton, and Quincy Jones, are available on the collection
The Cosmic Eye. The images in these films were inspired by the art of Klee,
Matisse, Miro, Modigliani, and Picasso, and they mark one of the few times
that jazz has been paired with the modern art that seems so similar in its
adventuresome spirit.
I Like Your Style: Jazz and Fashion
Jazz emerged as a colorful, exciting, spontaneous alternative to the staid
Victorian era. Along with it came fresh fashions that helped the music find its
new niche in American culture: as the colorful, flamboyant music of young
people. Women who loved swing dancing (known as “flappers” for their flap-
ping arms) wore short dresses and short hair. Men turned up in brightly col-
ored, carefully tailored, baggy zoot suits. Eventually, clothes also helped
elevate jazz’s status. Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, and others were seen in
crisp, modern suits, and jazz began to earn respect; highbrow venues such 
as Carnegie Hall started presenting jazz concerts.
Focusing on flappers
In the 1920s, women known as flappers brought a feminist streak to jazz. 
Big band swing was the soundtrack for their social lives. Wearing then-
outrageous sleeveless jerseys, short skirts, and bobbed hair, they were 
a sexy, flamboyant reaction to stiff Victorianism. These women of F. Scott
Fitzgerald’s Jazz Age danced The Black Bottom, The Charleston, and the Fox
Trot to syncopated jazz played by the big bands of Duke Ellington, Fletcher
Henderson, McKinney’s Cotton Pickers, and Paul Whiteman. Articles at the
time warned against the evils of jazz, syncopated music that sounded wild
compared to classical music and John Philip Souza marches. As they do
206
Part III: The Beat Goes On: Jazz Appreciation 101 
Seeing jazz musicians in cartoons
When it came to jazz, some of the hippest films
weren’t animated cartoons starring Mickey
Mouse and other cartoon heroes. By hip, I mean
in the sense that they used jazz in artful ways,
but not in the ways in which they depicted black
musicians such as Louis Armstrong (see
“Casting Louis Armstrong in the beginning” ear-
lier in this chapter). In the 1937 Clean Pastures,
he appears as a cartoon caricature with over-
size lips, a round body, and a dumbfounded look
on his face. Other jazz heroes recreated as car-
toon characters include Benny Goodman, Fats
Waller, and Paul Whiteman as well as Duke
Ellington in Date with Duke (1947) and Woody
Herman in Rhapsody in Wood (1947).

today, fashion designers looked to the emerging arts around them for inspira-
tion. In New York City, it was black ballroom dancing culture, featuring jazz
music and new women’s fashions that exposed arms, legs, and necks.
Female jazz singers made their own fashion statements, which became part
of their marketing through press photos and album covers. As front women
for big bands, singers such as Helen Forrest, Anita O’Day, Maxine Sullivan,
Sarah Vaughan, and Ethel Waters all wore gorgeous dresses, each with per-
sonal flair. (See Chapter 5 for more about these early women of jazz.)
Zipping up zoot suits
Long before zoot suits became the stuff of Broadway musicals, they made a
bold statement of identity for the hip black men who wore them to jazz con-
certs in 1930s Harlem. With their baggy, high-waisted, suspendered pants and
broad-shouldered tapering coats, they were a rebellion against the bland,
buttoned-down styles of the day. Malcolm X was a young hustler known as
Detroit Red who had his political consciousness raised when he participated
in the racially charged “zoot suit riots” in Detroit in the 1943, before he
became an early hero of African-American civil rights. In Los Angeles, young
Mexican-Americans also made a rebellious statement with their zoot suits.
The zoot suit is an extension of jazz’s early identity as dangerous, evil music —
music of nightclubs, dance halls, and bars — and especially African-American
music, which was at odds with the comfortable status quo.
As happened with the music, however, zoot suits eventually became accepted
as a fashion statement, and today are often viewed more as ultrahip outfits
than a statement of identity. Today, Andre 3000 of the hip-hop band Outkast
wears zoot suits as high fashion.
Dressing for respect
Bing Crosby, Benny Goodman, Frank Sinatra, and other white swing era stars
made stylish suits and ties fashionable for young white Americans. In the ’40s
and ’50s and beyond, many black jazz musicians made a point of being per-
fectly dressed in suits and ties. Through the decades, many jazz musicians
dressed formally because they wanted their music to earn the same respect
accorded to classical music. Gradually, jazz was invited into prestigious
venues like Carnegie Hall, and jazz fans came in appropriate attire. I cover 
the fashion influence of a few musicians in the following sections.
Dizzy Gillespie
Dizzy Gillespie, with his hip glasses, goatee, and stylish suits presented the
notion that jazz should be accepted as a serious art form but also as music
with its own distinctive identity. Suits and ties were a sign of respectability.
207
Chapter 11: Mass Appeal: Taking Note of Jazz in Popular Culture

Miles Davis
From his beginnings, Miles Davis was a fashion icon — an artist whose
clothes became as much a part of his stage presence as they did for pop
artists such as Jimi Hendrix and Prince. By the ’70s, Davis wore oversize
shades, black hats, capes, and long leather coats that made him seem like
some kind of artistic superhero: a combination of Clint Eastwood, Zorro, and
boxer Jack Johnson. Photos of Davis from various times in his long career
prove that he carefully crafted his visual identity.
Wynton Marsalis
Wynton Marsalis maintains the designer-suited image of jazz’s earlier years.
He wears tailored designer suits (not Davis’s flamboyant outfits) in keeping
with his identity as spokesman for a new era of black musicians. Seeing
Marsalis as a main player in Ken Burns’ Jazz series on public television, and
in his frequent appearances elsewhere in the media, makes one aware that at
least a few jazz musicians are finally gaining acceptance as great American
artists on a par with writers, painters, classical players, and conductors.
In Good Taste: Jazz in Art and Literature
Like other artists, photographers and writers are always on the lookout for
new modes of expression. In the decades following World War II, as jazz
evolved from bebop to hard bop and cool jazz, many of these artists became
fans of jazz. The music turned up in their art in ways that were sometimes
direct, sometimes oblique. I cover the influence of jazz on photographers 
and writers in the following sections.
Through the lens: Jazz photos
In recent years, photographs of black jazz musicians by William Claxton,
Gordon Parks, and other photographers are finally receiving their due as fine
art. (Others had photographed jazz musicians, but more as journalists than
fine artists.) These photos are worthy of museums and galleries, and they’re
important both for their depiction of jazz musicians as worthy subjects and
because they marked some of the first instances in which black photogra-
phers gained acceptance in the art world.
William Claxton
William Claxton grew up in California listening to big band jazz and began
shooting jazz musicians for album covers in the 1950s. His special skill was in
making them relaxed enough to reveal their inner emotions. In his photos,
these famous musicians live on as icons of the youthful, rebellious spirit of
jazz. While his photos weren’t originally viewed as fine art, they’re now trea-
sured by collectors, curators, and gallery owners.
208
Part III: The Beat Goes On: Jazz Appreciation 101 

In 2001 and 2002, Claxton’s photos were exhibited in London, Los Angeles, Paris,
and Tokyo. Claxton’s “Jazz Seen” takes you behind the curtain and offstage for 
a look at the personal lives of famous jazz performers and an intimate look at
their many moods. Connoisseurs may also want a copy of “Jazz Life” — an over-
size volume with a lot of photos and evocative text — Claxton’s elegant (and
expensive) collaboration with brainy European jazz critic Joachim Berendt.
Roy DeCarava
Roy DeCarava collaborated with poet Langston Hughes on the 1955 book The
Sweet Flypaper of Life, with Hughes’s words and DeCarava’s photos focusing
on family and neighborhood life in Harlem. For Americans who saw the book,
it offered a look into a culture they had rarely seen. DeCarava’s book The
Sound I Saw, written during the 1960s but not published until 2001, was a sim-
ilar project, only this time DeCarava supplied both the photos and the words.
The Sound I Saw combines his New York City street photos of Miles Davis,
Coleman Hawkins, Elvin Jones, and other jazz musicians at work and at play,
with his poetry depicting a range of images and emotions from black urban
life. It’s a heartfelt tribute to the lives of African-American artists, from one 
of their own.
Gordon Parks
Gordon Parks became known as a photojournalist for Life magazine, and his
photos of African Americans including jazz musicians such as Duke Ellington
(as well as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King) brought black life to main-
stream America during the civil rights era. Parks is also the author of two
memoirs and numerous other books, in which he often acknowledges the
importance of jazz on his life and photography. His gritty black-and-white
photos are the visual equivalent of gritty hard bop and free jazz played by
Clifford Brown, Ornette Coleman, and others (see Chapters 7 and 8 for more
about these forms of jazz).
Carl Van Vechten
Harlem photographer Carl Van Vechten shot photographs of many famed
artists of the Harlem Renaissance in the 1930s. From jazz, his subjects
included Bessie Smith, particularly one famous photo of her with hair pulled
back, looking to the side of the camera in a pensive mood, holding a feather
fan. In this photo (and others), Van Vechten portrayed the personal warmth
of a black artist who was part of a music form seen at the time as subversive
and threatening to mainstream culture and family values.
The write stuff: Jazz as an 
inspiration for books
When respected writers take jazz as their subject, they often discover hidden
subtleties and themes. When they take the time for in-depth consideration of
209
Chapter 11: Mass Appeal: Taking Note of Jazz in Popular Culture

jazz, they show you that the music and its artists are worthy of deeper reflec-
tion. And when their books serve as the basis for films, their fresh percep-
tions reach a mass audience.
Dozens of authors have used jazz as their inspiration, sometimes in mass-
market fiction, others in books with literary aspirations. Here are just a few.
 Candace Allen: Allen’s first novel was Valaida, based on the life of
Valaida Snow, one of jazz’s first female trumpeters. Allen captures the
difficulties of being a female African-American artist in a field dominated
by men, as well as the rush of playing jazz with some of Louis
Armstrong’s bandmates.
 Geoff Dyer: But Beautiful: A Book About Jazz won the Somerset Maugham
Prize for fiction in 1992. It’s a collection of stories inspired by the music of
jazz greats including Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk, Art Pepper, and
Bud Powell.
 Charles Mingus: No jazz library is complete without a copy of Charles
Mingus’ Beneath the Underdog, supposedly the bassist’s autobiography
but probably with plenty of exaggeration and imagination. It’s the fasci-
nating story of a jazz player learning the ropes in Los Angeles.
 Bill Moody: Moody is the author of a series of novels including Solo
Hand and Looking for Chet Baker and featuring Moody’s main character
Evan Horne, a jazz clarinetist. By setting his fiction amid jazz, Moody
gives readers a look into the world of the jazz musician.
 Michael Ondaatje: Ondaatje wrote the script for The English Patient
and penned the novel Coming Through Slaughter, inspired by the life of
Buddy Bolden — the legendary New Orleans cornet player (see Chapter
5 for details about him). Ondaatje’s book isn’t intended to be factual. It’s
an improvisation in words that uses Bolden, about whom little is known,
as a point of departure. Ondaatje’s book has been critically acclaimed as
one of the best jazz novels.
Are You Hep to the Jive? Jazz Jargon
One of the most pervasive ways in which jazz has become a part of our lives is
through language. Through movies, radio, books, and word of mouth, jazz jive
talk invented by Cab Calloway, Lester Young, and others was adopted by later
hipsters such as Jack Kerouac, ’60s hippies, and current rappers. Today words
like hip, cool, and bad (meaning good) are common, but most people probably
don’t know that they originated among jazz players in the ’30s and ’40s.
Bandleader Cab Calloway posed the question “Are you hep to the jive?” and
was a leader in popularizing the slang used by jazz musicians. Another leg-
endary slang singer was saxophonist Lester Young. He used so many particu-
lar phrases that at times you had to know him well to understand him. (See
Chapter 6 for details about both musicians.)
210
Part III: The Beat Goes On: Jazz Appreciation 101 

Calloway compiled much of the best jazz slang in his Hepsters Dictionary, pub-
lished in 1945. It’s now out of print and fetches as much as $350 on online 
auctions. Originally, the idea of coded slang dates back to a time when slaves
used words with double meanings so masters and bosses couldn’t understand
them. After Calloway and others popularized jazz lingo, though, it began enter-
ing mainstream American life through various art forms.
 Novelist Jack Kerouac was a huge fan of jazz whose characters in On the
Road spoke like jazz musicians.
 Screenwriters and directors also incorporated jazz language into biker
films like The Wild One (1953) and Easy Rider (1969).
 Most hippies who used words like cool and mellow and reefer probably
didn’t know that their lingo originated in Harlem during the 1930s and
1940s, was brought into the mainstream through books and literature,
and survived as a mainstream of hip culture through several decades.
In the ’60s, I took a drive with my parents through San Francisco’s Haight
Ashbury neighborhood to look at the hippies. Later, I learned that Jack
Kerouac and the Beat Generation had used words including “hip.” But it 
was years later that I found out that the word’s origin was probably in the
Chicago jazz scene during Prohibition, when jazz fans carrying hip flasks
became known as “hipsters.”
Here are a few of Cab Calloway’s favorite words (which he undoubtedly col-
lected from the black Harlem culture all around him) and their meanings.
Many of the phrases have become a part of the mainstream:
 Apple: The big town, Harlem (By some accounts, Lester Young coined
the phrase “The Big Apple.”)
 Beat it out: Play it hot, emphasize the rhythm (This was decades before
Michael Jackson’s “Beat It” or the Go-Gos’ “We Got the Beat.”)
 Chick: Girl
 Corny: Old fashioned
 Hip: Wise, sophisticated
 Mellow: All right, fine
 Pops, Jack: Salutation for males
 Reefer: Marijuana
 Riff: Hot lick, musical phrase
 Rock me: Send me, kill me, move me with rhythm
 Solid: Great, swell, okay

Chapter 11: Mass Appeal: Taking Note of Jazz in Popular Culture

Making the Sale: Jazz in Advertising
As jazz has moved from clubs to concert halls in recent years, led by Wynton
Marsalis’s high profile reign as artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center (see
Chapter 10 for more details), the music and its stars have become enough of
a part of popular American culture that they’ve turned up in advertisements
for products ranging from automobiles to watches and fashion.
Many companies and influential business savvy marketers have appealed to
the public through a marketing theme centered on jazz:
 Apple Computer: This company chose Miles Davis to represent iBook.
Davis’s “Flamenco Sketches” from the Kind of Blue album was used for a
romantic commercial titled “The Possibility of Love.” With Miles as the
soundtrack, you too can fall in love with a laptop! Apple is known for its
sexy designs, so a cut from Miles fits well.
 Acura: The use of Sarah Vaughan’s “Key Largo” for Acura tells you that
these cars are classy, elegant, and crafted down to the last detail.
 Volkswagen: Charles Mingus’s bluesy “II B.S.” for Volkswagen gives the
car an upbeat, universally appealing context.
 Estée Lauder: This huge cosmetics company used Louis Armstrong’s
“What A Wonderful World.” Armstrong’s song is a dream about an ideal
world — one that you may be able to enter with the right look.
 GMC: “They All Laughed” by Louis Armstrong was used for GMC’s Envoy
SUV — a song that’s a testament to the vision of explorers and inventors
such as Christopher Columbus and Thomas Edison. Here’s an attempt to
rub some adventurousness off on a car.
 Infiniti: Dave Brubeck’s “Take Five” takes on a different identity as part
of a pitch for Infiniti luxury automobiles than it had when it came out in
the late 1950s and its audience was beatniks and cool college students.
Now, those young seekers have come of age, and “Take Five” has
become a classic of controlled, intelligent jazz that still sounds great
after nearly 50 years.
 Radio Shack: Brubeck’s “Blue Rondo A La Turk” takes the rondo form
from classical music and transforms it into a jazz tune. Maybe this song
represents the diverse array of products in one of these stores, or the
sophisticated technology.

Good Times: Jazzing 
Up Any Dinner Party
In This Chapter
 Jazzing up your home décor
 Spinning tunes to set the mood
 Sparking conversation with jazz tidbits
 Picking out party favors
You’re hosting a mellow dinner party with good friends and not wanting
to make the usual small talk about the president’s policies, your parents,
or the real estate market. If you’ve read this far, you’re probably already a
music buff. You may have a pretty fair collection of CDs, some vinyl, maybe
an mp3 player loaded with a growing number of succulent jazz tunes. And if
you’ve read this far, your music library probably goes well beyond classic
albums by Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, or Charlie Parker. Nice work!
The purpose of this chapter is to provide some jazz recipes that make your
dinner party a smash hit, amazing your friends with your inside knowledge.
I’m going to tell you how to create the right mood with decorations, compile
playlists that surprise your guests, fill your conversation with captivating
details about jazz history, and send your guests home with cool trinkets.
Setting the Stage with Jazzy Décor
With a little daydreaming and careful online flea-marketing, you can transform
your living room into a gallery of great images and memorabilia from the his-
tory of jazz. Together with great food and music (see the following section for
details), these items help you sweep your guests away on a romantic flight of
jazz fancy.

The key to any jazz collection is that it’s personal. Choose the artists and
periods you like the most, and gather artifacts that reflect your passions. If
you need help deciding, head to Part II, where I cover many different eras,
from the 1920s to today’s jazz scene.
Don’t just settle for any old décor to set the mood for your party. The World
Wide Web is a fantastic source for inexpensive, one-of-a-kind finds. Look for a
few eye-catching items that may impress your guests and serve as great con-
versation pieces, like the following:
 Old magazines: I found a 1966 Life magazine with a fold-out cover of
Louis Armstrong blowing his horn. I also have a 1952 issue of Downbeat
with Louis on the cover, celebrating his induction into the Jazz Hall of
Fame. A more exotic choice: Satchmo on the cover of a 1947 issue of the
French magazine Regards. Any one of these would look great framed and
hung on your dining room wall. Three of them together would make a
really stunning statement.
 Photo prints: You can get a print of photographer Carl Van Vechten’s
black-and-white image of Bessie Smith holding a feather fan, with a shy,
pensive look on her face. This photo and others by Van Vechten are
available from the Library of Congress Web site. Photos of jazz musi-
cians by William Gottlieb (whose photos are featured in this book) also
are available from the Library of Congress. In your own city, there are
probably photographers or galleries selling prints of jazz performers
(either famous musicians or unsung local heroes).
 Posters: A silk-screened Mondrian-like poster in tribute to Afro-Cuban
percussion great Chano Pozo lends your décor the essential Latin ingre-
dient Pozo brought to his collaborations with Dizzy Gillespie. Or you can
add a cool ’50s touch in the form of a poster for Miles Davis’s 1957 head-
lining gig at San Francisco’s Blackhawk, with Dave Brubeck as the
opener. Artist Paul Colin’s posters of Josephine Baker and the jazz age
are available for less than $50 from a variety of online poster outlets.
IKEA, the Scandinavian home furnishing chain that’s gradually spreading
across the United States, is a great place to purchase good-looking wood
and metal picture frames at very reasonable prices.
 Vinyl records: Benny Goodman’s 1938 performance at Carnegie Hall was
an epic event, both for putting jazz in a first-class concert venue and for
showcasing black and white musicians together. I found the two-record
set on vinyl on eBay for less than $20, with a cool cover photo of
Goodman, flanked by lists of his stellar special guests. Display the album
cover where guests can see it, and play them cuts like “One O’Clock
Jump” and “Stompin’ at the Savoy” (I hope you have a turntable).
 DVDs: Launch your décor into the stratosphere with a DVD featuring
intergalactic jazz emissary Sun Ra. Even with the sound turned down,
Sun’s godly presence lends your party a special aura. Not exactly other-
worldly but certainly dreamlike is the Cool Jazz Sound DVD, which cap-
tures Miles Davis and John Coltrane performing together on television
214
Part III: The Beat Goes On: Jazz Appreciation 101 

on together in 1959. Charles Mingus: Triumph of the Underdog includes
rare footage of the enigmatic bassist. The larger and better your televi-
sion, the more amazing this DVD is.
Of course, the danger of DVDs is that they may hijack your party causing
you to forget all about dinner. For more examples of great DVDs, see
Chapter 11.
 Finishing touches: Turn on your lights to a jazz tempo with jazz-themed
switchplate covers, or serve food on china with jazz patterns. Other
items I’ve seen include a neon sign in the shape of a saxophone, lamps
made from trumpets and saxophones, musical instrument mouse pads,
and porkpie hats you can hang on the wall as a tribute to saxophonist
Lester Young, the subject of Charles Mingus’s famous composition
“Goodbye Porkpie Hat.”
Check out the following Web sites to help you decorate:
 eBay (www.ebay.com): eBay is an online superstore where you can find
good deals on jazz-related items, from vintage photos and vinyl records
with striking covers to rare books, collectible magazines, and frameable
posters.
 Google (www.google.com): Google is your best friend when you’re
searching for posters, photos, and other jazz-related artifacts. With 
this search engine, you can find dozens more sources in addition to 
the ones listed here.
 The Library of Congress (www.loc.gov): Jazz photos by the two great
Williams (Claxton and Gottlieb) are available in a high-resolution format.
 International Poster Gallery (www.internationalposter.com):
Beautiful jazz posters by artist Niklaus Troxler are more expensive than
conventional posters but worth the money if you’re starting a collection.
 www.jazzposters.com: This site features posters of most of jazz’s leg-
ends, some priced under $10 — including portraits, reproductions of
posters from past performances, and paintings.
 www.postershop.com: This site has a huge assortment of jazz posters
made from cool black-and-white photos of performers like Louis
Armstrong and Miles Davis.
Cueing Up Terrific Tunes
When you deejay your own party, be sure to select a flavorful mix of music
that’s hip enough to impress people but not so abstract that it detracts from
the mood. In the following sections, I give you tips on the coolest kinds of
music for each part of your evening.
215
Chapter 12: Good Times: Jazzing Up Any Dinner Party

If you have an mp3 player, you can compile various playlists for special 
occasions (see the sidebar “Compiling cool playlists for your dinner party”
later in this chapter for details). Another option? I use a 300-CD changer.
Sometimes I play a single CD all the way through; other times I set the
machine to “random play” and let it surprise me with combinations that 
I may not think of myself.
Easing into the evening
If you’re hosting three or four couples for an intimate evening, you want the
music to start off gentle and romantic. Don’t clobber guests with frantic
bebop or wailing free jazz. Ease your guests into the music, the evening, and
some conversation. Good choices for starters are 1950s cool jazz, solo piano
music, or romantic vocal jazz featuring Billie Holiday, Mel Tormé, or another
of jazz’s great singers.
For this mood, I recommend Miles Davis’s laid-back albums from the 1950s,
such as Relaxin’ and Steamin’, or various vocal albums. Two of my favorite
singers are Nat King Cole and Abbey Lincoln. The Best of Nat King Cole Trio:
Vocal Classics, Vol. 1 (1942–1946) (Blue Note) includes “Straighten Up and Fly
Right” and other sweet Cole classics. Lincoln’s That’s Him is a great (harder
to find) album that captures the singer in a young, innocent period singing
romantic tunes to the accompaniment of ace players such as saxophonist
Sonny Rollins and trumpeter Kenny Dorham. Lincoln’s voice is sweet on
tunes including her version of “Tender As A Rose.”
Other selections for the get-acquainted cocktail hour of your evening can
include something by Chet Baker (early muted trumpet or late-career misty
vocals); some moody solo piano (Bill Evans, Ahmad Jamal, or a personal
favorite, Mike Wofford); a selection of lush saxophone (breathy Ben Webster,
’50s Stan Getz, and Gerry Mulligan), and touches of flute (Charles Lloyd and
Herbie Mann). Online music stores list dozens of albums; choose some music
that most appeals to you, and you can tell your guests why you like it.
Boosting the energy during dinner
At this point the clock is headed toward 7:00 p.m., the sun’s dropping, people
are relaxing, and dinner is starting to season the atmosphere with sweet and
spicy smells.
When your guests are seated and dinner is served, the music needs to be
mellow enough for dining and dialogue, but uptempo enough to keep the
energy flowing. Kick it up a notch or two from your cocktail music mix. Big
band swing is good here (Woody Herman or Duke Ellington), along with some
Latin jazz (Chico O’Farrill or Tito Puente) or African percussion music (try
Babatunde Olatunji). Whatever music you choose, spend some time reading
216
Part III: The Beat Goes On: Jazz Appreciation 101 

bios and notes online so you can play the good host and provide a few sto-
ries and basic information (see “Keeping the Conversation Flowing with Jazz
Talk,” later in this chapter for more details).
Imagine good vibes around the table and think of ’50s hard bop by drummer
Art Blakey (and the Jazz Messengers), trumpeter Clifford Brown, pianist
Horace Silver, and saxophonists Cannonball Adderley and Sonny Rollins. Toss
in a J.J. Johnson/Kai Winding trombone duo for flavor, and simmer in some
bluesy jazz organ by Jimmy McGriff, Richard “Groove” Holmes, or Jimmy Smith.
Upping the elegance during dessert
Clear away those main course dishes, serve some espresso and/or liqueur,
and lead into dessert with something a little fancier and upbeat. In my mind,
dessert is the evening’s climactic moment, like finally seeing the aliens in a
sci-fi film, or the end of the big chase scene in an action movie. You’ve been
building to this point with food, music, and spirits. Now, as you bring out
homemade cream puffs, gourmet ice cream, apple pie, or chocolate mousse,
you want the music to accentuate this important flourish.
Any uptempo jazz is good. Mellow electric jazz from the 1970s may be a good
fit (something by Weather Report or Miles Davis?), especially if your guests
are also fans of rock ’n’ roll. Remember, you don’t have to serve a mix of
straight jazz — you can add pop, rock, folk, electronic, hip-hop, or any other
music that fits your personalized dinner party playlist.
Some fiery Latin jazz by Machito, Chano Pozo, Tito Puente, or Pancho Sanchez
heats up the mood. Big band music stimulates some fresh conversation: If you
can, find a copy of the Duke Ellington band’s Live at Fargo (I bought it on vinyl
in a used record store some years back; you may find a copy the same way 
or from an online rare records source). It’s an electrifying performance on a
snowy eve; as a conversation piece, play one of Ellington’s duos with bassist
Jimmy Blanton, fascinating for the interaction between the two musicians and
for Blanton’s breakthroughs in improvisation. Never No Lament: The Blanton
Webster Band (RCA) is a three-disc mother lode of golden music, including the
famous Blanton/Ellington duet on “Pitter Patter Panther.”
Here are a few other specific cuts to consider, especially if you’re the type
who may program the entire evening’s musical menu on your computer or
mp3 player.
 The Complete Decca Recordings, by Count Basie’s band
• “Roseland Shuffle”
• “One O’Clock Jump”
• “Topsy”
217
Chapter 12: Good Times: Jazzing Up Any Dinner Party

 Blowin’ Up A Storm, by Woody Herman
• “Apple Honey”
• “Bijou”
• “Caldonia”
• “Northwest Passage”
Ending your night on an electric note
Now that you’ve made it to the end of dessert, it’s time to bust open your
evening with the wildest jazz you’ve got. After all, if your friends aren’t ready
to try it now, they probably never will be. Anyway, if they don’t like it, you
can always change the music — or they may decide to say good night, and
you can play music until you’re satisfied.
Riveting electric jazz (Mahavishnu Orchestra, 1980s Miles Davis) may reener-
gize the party. You can mix in some hip-hop to keep things flowing (I’m a big
fan of Missy Elliott and Outkast). Improvised free jazz is the ultimate in wild
energy, perfect for jolting your guests wide awake just before they make the
drive home.
Check out these displays of jazz genius:
 Miles Davis’s Jack Johnson and Get Up With It (especially the eerie jolt of
“Rated X”)
 Mahavishnu Orchestra’s The Inner Mounting Flame (starring guitarist
John McLaughlin)
 Weather Report’s I Sing The Body Electric and Heavy Weather (with the
late great Jaco Pastorius on electric bass)
 Tony Williams’ Emergency
 The Art Ensemble of Chicago or the World Saxophone Quartet (all of the
many albums by these groups are worth a listen)
Hey, about now you should be getting a commission on all the CDs your
guests  buy after you get them hooked.

Chapter 12: Good Times: Jazzing Up Any Dinner Party
Compiling cool playlists for your dinner party
Disc jockeys understand the impact of assem-
bling sets of music by mood and transition. You
can select pieces from various periods that fit
your personal tastes or create an atmosphere for
different parts of your evening. Playing one CD
all the way through gives you the exact picture
of where an artist was at a particular point in his
career, and how that artist and his producer put
the music in order to have an impact. Using a
multi-CD changer and using the “random” fea-
ture is a great way to create unexpected transi-
tion. My changer has an uncanny knack for
finding interesting combinations I never would
have thought about.
If you want to get into creating playlists of your
own, a computer with music software is an
essential tool. This way, you can store thousands
of songs from your CDs and from online music
sources, catalog them any want you want, and
rearrange them into playlists to suit any mood or
occasion (like a dinner party). Here, I’ve included
some exemplary playlists; many of the songs are
available from various CDs or online sources. I
leave it up to you to find the music. Whether you
use them, these lists give you an idea of how
playlists can sustain a mood or explore a style of
jazz.
Playlist 1: Dinner or dessert
 Duke Ellington, “Queen Suite”
 Duke Ellington/Johnny Hodges, “Passion
Flower”
 Sarah Vaughan, “Lush Life”
 Ella Fitzgerald, “Daydream”

Clean”
 Charlie Parker, “Star Eyes”
 Ornette Coleman, “Science Fiction”
 John Coltrane, “Crescent”
 Art Ensemble of Chicago, “Fanfare for the
Warriors”
Playlist 2: Drinks or dinner

 Betty Carter, “My Favorite Things”
 Tierney Sutton, “Route 66”

Keeping the Conversation 
Flowing with Jazz Talk
Music and decorations  set the mood for your jazz party, but you can also take
an active role in prompting and sustaining good conversation. Some of your
guests may already know a lot about jazz, while others may be complete new-
bies. Armed with a few facts and anecdotes from jazz history, you can help
make sure the conversation is entertaining, lively, and built on jazz. In the fol-
lowing sections, I explain how to dig up interesting stories to tell to your
guests and provide you with some details about lesser-known musicians.
Finding nuggets of info to 
share with your guests
Stories about players, odd factoids, unsung heroes, insider slang — you can
store all sorts of items from books (such those in Appendix C) or online
sources in your head and drop them into the conversation.
The Red Hot Jazz Archive (www.redhotjazz.com) is a definitive online
source of information about jazz before 1930. You may be amazed how many
important players there were, how many great stories there are about those
players and their music, and how much you can discover about who played
with whom. This first-rate Web site compiled by jazz fanatics gives general
history, as well as individual biographies and discographies (lists of record-
ings) for dozens of famous and not-so-famous players, ranging from Louis
Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton to Bunk Johnson, Freddie Keppard, and
Clarence Williams. After an hour or two touring this Web site, you know
enough to share a bit with your dinner guests.
One trick I often use at parties is to keep a laptop computer with wireless
Internet connection at hand. That way, when the conversation raises questions,
you can come up with intriguing (and accurate) answers within a few seconds.
Dishing about lesser-known musicians
For every Louis Armstrong or Lester Young or Charlie Parker, there’s a Bix
Beiderbecke, Chu Berry, or Lucky Thompson who was a gifted unsung hero 
of his time. In fact, you can tell an alternate history of jazz using only unfamil-
iar favorites, and that history might be more compelling than the familiar 
version (see Part II for a quick overview). But then, I’ve always been a fan 
of the underdog, an advocate of artists who made a valiant effort but never
achieved immortality. So, in the following sections, I present a few of those
deserving musicians from jazz history.
220
Part III: The Beat Goes On: Jazz Appreciation 101 

New Orleans
Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, and King Oliver are names most often
associated with early jazz, which was born in New Orleans, but clarinetist
Jimmie Noone, cornetist Freddie Keppard, and drummers Baby Dodds and
Zutty Singleton were all in the thick of the action.
 Noone was a part of pre-recording-era bands such as Keppard’s and the
Young Olympia Band. His career stretched from New Orleans to 1920s
Chicago, then into the 1930s and early 1940s. Pull selections (and great
bio information) from Jimmie Noone: His Best Recordings (1923–1940)
(Best of Jazz).
 Dodds provided rhythmic juice for Armstrong, Morton, and Oliver. His
drumming is showcased on Baby Dodds (American Music).
 Singleton pioneered the use of brushes instead of drumsticks for a softer
swishing sound. The CD New Orleans Drums has several cuts featuring
Dodds and Singleton, but it’s out of print and tough to find.
Check out Chapter 5 for more about this jazz era.
Chicago
In Chicago there were two scenes: South Side and North Side, black and
white. Players from both sides checked each other out and many of them
played together.
Clarinetist Mezz Mezzrow’s memoir Really the Blues is a fascinating account
of his life inside the Windy City’s jazz scene in the 1920s and 1930s as both 
a musician and pot provider to stars like Louis Armstrong. Mezzrow hung 
out with black and white musicians, although he idolized the black artists.
His stories   be fun to recount at your party. Mezzrow’s book is rich with
accounts of “muggles” (marijuana) and “vipers” (pothead musicians) and 
all-night jaunts to South Side clubs and jam sessions.
See Chapter 5 for more details about this period of jazz.
Big bands
Bands led by Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and Benny Goodman get the lion’s
share of attention, but there were dozens of other worthy bands. Drummer
Chick Webb’s were some of the hottest. Webb was a wonder to watch, a tiny
hunchbacked man who leaned into his drum kit and made magic.
Charlie Barnet, Jimmy Dorsey, Erskine Hawkins, and Andy Kirk led important
thirties big bands, and you can reach back to the 1920s to grab McKinney’s
Cotton Pickers. Barnet was a wealthy ladies’ man who didn’t have to work
but became a killer tenor saxophonist and fronted top-notch bands that
included Lena Horne, Barney Kessel, Dodo Marmarosa, and Clark Terry. His
221
Chapter 12: Good Times: Jazzing Up Any Dinner Party

band’s big hit song was “Cherokee,” and by some accounts, they were “the
blackest white band of them all.” In jazz, that’s quite an honor. You can find
bios and other stories on these guys at www.redhotjazz.com.
Head to Chapter 6 to find out more about the big band era.
Bebop
Lucky Thompson is my favorite under-appreciated bebop hero. He was
among the few saxophonists of his era to play soprano (along with tenor),
and he was an awesome improviser on both ballads and uptempo tunes. 
He possessed Charlie Parker’s speed and ingenuity, combined with lyrical,
romantic phrasings and tone.
Trumpeter Howard McGhee was another major talent who is seldom men-
tioned. In mid-’40s Los Angeles, he was at the heart of a thriving club scene.
There are pictures of McGhee with Miles Davis, where McGhee is the cool vet-
eran and Davis his reverent disciple. McGhee’s CD Trumpet at Tempo (Jazz
Classics) should earn respect from your guests for your hipster knowledge of
jazz.
I give you the full scoop on the bebop era in Chapter 7.
Players on unusual instruments
Saxophones and trumpets are standard tools in jazz, but all sorts of other
instruments have done duty over the years.
 Accordion: Take Leon Sash — the guy made a legitimate jazz instrument
out of the accordion on his 1967 I Remember Newport album (Delmark);
imagine “Pennies From Heaven” and “Our Love Is Here To Stay” chan-
neled through Sash’s bellows and keyboard.
 Bagpipes: Rufus Harley played the bagpipes, and legend has it that he
abandoned his saxophone and took up the pipes after hearing them on
television as part of President John F. Kennedy’s funeral procession.
Harley’s recordings are tough to find, but you can hunt them down
online. His CD The Pied Piper of Jazz (Label M) consists of recordings
from the 1960s and proves that Harley is much more tasty than a plateful
of haggis (a nice name for the Scottish pudding made from sheep’s
intestines).
 Cello: Cellist Tristan Honsinger creates a blend of music somewhere
near the intersection of improvised jazz and classical music; blow a few
minds wide open with his CDs: Map of Moods (FMP) and Hearth (FMP).
Hearth is a collaborative effort with pianist Cecil Taylor and saxophonist
Evan Parker.
222
Part III: The Beat Goes On: Jazz Appreciation 101 

 Conch shells: For seasoning, add Steve Turré on conch shells. Usually a
trombonist, Turré occasionally blows the univalve mollusks associated
with ancient Crete, transforming the instrument of goddesses into a
medium for eery modern jazz. Sanctified Shells (Polygram) is Turré’s
conch-ified tour de force.
 French horn: Dial in something from Julius Watkins, who has been
called the “Charlie Parker of French Horn.” It’s not well known, but
Watkins recorded with Kenny Clarke, Miles Davis, and Thelonious Monk.
Try Julius Watkins Sextet Vols. 1 and 2 (Blue Note), a reissue of two
records Watkins made in the mid-1950s with crack musicians including
Clarke and Art Blakey.
Check out Chapter 4 for more details on the traditional instruments used in
jazz.
A few unsung female heroes
Jazz’s legends are almost entirely male, but man, some strong women have
held their own going back further than you may think.
Sprinkle a few of these ladies into the conversation to let your guests know
you’re an equal-opportunity host, and slide a few of their CDs into your
machine. Much of their music is readily available.
 Clora Bryant: Tell your friends that one of your favorite players is trum-
peter Clora Bryant (but you may want to listen to her music first). She
was a regular on Los Angeles’ Central Avenue scene in the ’40s and ’50s.
She led her own groups and performed alongside heavies such as Buddy
Collette and Charles Mingus. Clora traded solos with Dizzy Gillespie,
Dexter Gordon, and Charlie Parker, which isn’t something you do unless
you’ve got serious chops.
Bryant’s Gal With A Horn album (Vsop Records) was released in 1957,
and it’s a great conversation piece, with full-blown versions of “Sweet
Georgia Brown,” “Makin’ Whoopee,” and my favorite, “Man with a Horn.”
 Dorothy Ashby: You can bet your guests have never heard of Dorothy
Ashby. Women in jazz are rare enough, but harps are almost unheard of.
It’s ethereal to hear Ashby plucking jazz lines with the speed and nuance
of a saxophonist or pianist, but on the harp. If this all sounds heavenly
to you, get Ashby’s Afro-Harping (Verve) or Hip Harp (Prest).
 Valaida Snow: Valaida Snow’s bold trumpet earned her the nickname
“Little Louis” (after Louis Armstrong) in the 1930s, when she played with
greats like Count Basie, Fletcher Henderson, and Earl Hines. Hot Snow:
Queen of Trumpet and Song (DRG) is an impressive collection of Snow’s
trumpeting and vocals.
See Chapters 5, 6, and 10 for additional information on influential women in
jazz.

this sort of stuff, it’s hard to beat online auction sites such as eBay. Check out
these great party favors:
 CDs: One great choice? Slim’s Jam (Drive Archive) is a highly entertain-
ing CD featuring guitarist/vocalist/humorist Slim Gaillard jiving and jam-
ming with Charlie Parker and other giants.
 Movies: Stormy Weather stars Cab Calloway, Lena Horne, Bill Robinson,
and Fats Waller. It’s short on story, long on great performances.
 Magazines: Dig up treasures like a 1968 magazine ad featuring Benny
Goodman for Smirnoff vodka; a 1965 Downbeat magazine with Cecil
Taylor on the cover; and a 1962 magazine ad with Gene Krupa for
Zildjian cymbals.
 Postcards: A postcard signed by Billie Holiday, featuring a photo of
Antoine’s restaurant in New Orleans, is an excellent display piece to
frame and put in your house.
 Tote bags: Jazz tote bags featuring the faces of Duke Ellington, Ella
Fitzgerald, and other stars are your dinner party equivalent of those 
coveted gift bags given to stars in Hollywood.
 T-shirts: On an online auction site, you can find clothing like a
Thelonious Monk T-shirt and a Miles Davis pink baby-doll T-shirt.
 Buttons: Wear Satchmo all the time with Louis Armstrong pin-on buttons.
 Unusual items: Keep your eyes peeled for unique items such as a 1993
funeral handbill for Sun Ra and a set of Django Reinhardt guitar picks
with his photo on them.
Now that the party is over, you can relax and regroup. I recommend that you
play the James Brown CD, 20 All-Time Greatest Hits (Polydor/PGD). Well, it
doesn’t really qualify as jazz, but you can have that party debris cleaned up
in record time!

O
ne thought may haunt you as you get older: You have only so much time
on earth, so you better make the most of it. If you’re into music, this
means you must spend your time as carefully as you spend your money. If
you want the best that your time can buy, you should get out and hear as
much live music as you can, and make sure that it’s the best live music you
can find.
The purpose of this chapter is to help you have a “perfect” jazz concert expe-
rience. Tickets aren’t cheap these days, and when you spend the time and
money to hear live jazz, you want to be sure you have a great experience.
Many things can throw a wrench in your plans:
 Performers who aren’t in peak form
 Poor sound systems
 Uncomfortable seating
 Audiences that talk too much (instead of listening)
 Lights that are too bright or that hit you right in the eyes

228
Part III: The Beat Goes On: Jazz Appreciation 101
In this chapter, I tell you how to guarantee the best possible concert experi-
ence, from researching and choosing the performers you want to hear, to
finding a good seat, behaving appropriately at the show, and figuring out
which clubs in other cities may be worth a road trip.
Live music performed in a room is multidimensional in profound ways that I
doubt can ever be captured by a recording. Sure, you could pop a DVD into
your home theater system, but live music is unbeatable. The facial expres-
sions of performers add emotional impact, and the techniques of the bands
may amaze you.
Do Your Homework: Researching
Different Artists
So you want to hear some live jazz? Before you start filling your schedule
with concerts, you have to dig around a little for some information. You may
not know which artists are planning on visiting your area, or you may be
strapped for cash (or time!) and need to limit the number of concerts you
attend. And even if you already have a good idea which artists you want to
hear when they come to town, you still need to do some homework. With a
bit of research, you can find out
 Where your city falls on a performer’s tour (later is usually better
because they’re in the groove)
 What their newest album sounds like
 Who’s in the touring band (it’s probably different than the one on the CD)
 Which older tunes are likely to be featured along with new material
In the following sections, you decide on shows to see by finding basic tour
details and tracking down tour reviews.
Searching for basic information 
about musicians and tours
Musicians, when they perform at your local club or concert hall, are fre-
quently in the midst of a regional or national tour. Looking at several differ-
ent resources, such as Web sites and newspapers, can help you find out
which songs they’re playing, who’s playing with them, and whether they
seem to be sounding good.

In the following sections, I give you helpful tips for discovering which musi-
cians are coming to your area, finding the facts on different tours, and deter-
mining which shows are the ones you definitely want to see.
Using local resources to find out who’s coming to town
First thing’s first: Make a list of concerts you may want to see. Then use a few
local resources like those in the following list to discover which shows are on
the local horizon:
 The best source is often your city’s independent weekly paper — most
larger cities have them — or daily newspaper. (Magazines aren’t as good
as newspapers because long lead times prevent them from getting
detailed concert information.)
 Clubs and other concert venues have Web sites that include more exten-
sive calendars than your local papers.
 Your city probably has either a local public radio station or a college
radio station that announces jazz concerts.
With these sources, you may find out interesting information like the following:
 Whether the performer is playing multiple concerts in your town: Be
aware that opening nights sometimes are hampered by technical
glitches, or that the musicians may be tired (and uninspired) after a long
day or night of traveling.
 Whether the tour has a theme: Singers, for instance, sometimes pay
tribute to a favorite composer such as Cole Porter. Saxophonists or
trumpeters may honor greats like Charlie Parker or Miles Davis — this
can be great if you like that music, or disappointing if they don’t do it
justice.
Checking out a musician’s Web site for tour details
These days, most musicians have Web sites under their own names: herbie
hancock.com, wyntonmarsalis.com, jasonmoran.com. These sites are
usually well maintained and include information on concerts and CDs, as well
as news, photos, reviews, and even personal diaries. Here’s a sampling of
information you can find on musician Web sites:
 The tour schedule: It’s usually current, but if the schedule lists a con-
cert months in advance, the date(s) may change or be cancelled in the
event of illness.
 A sense of the artist’s latest creative efforts: Has he or she written and
recorded a bunch of new music? Collaborated with other talented musi-
cians or composers? Or is there a new CD compilation of old recordings?
229
Chapter 13: Lovin’ It Live: A Jazz Concert Survival Guide

Fans of many musicians keep Web sites of their own; these sites can be a great
place to find reviews and commentary. Fans tell you exactly what they think,
and they often have well-informed opinions. They know whether a musician is
in peak form and whether his or her band is good. They also often post set
lists of songs from recent concerts, so you can see exactly what’s coming your
way. You can find fan Web sites (and musician Web sites, for that matter) by
entering a musician’s name into your favorite search engine.
Getting the scoop on a musician’s latest work
A musician’s career goes through ups and downs and in-betweens. Every
year, every album, every tour comes from a different place. You want to know
whether it’s a good place, or at least a place you can relate to. Here’s how to
take a musician’s creative temperature:
 Get the musician’s latest CD: Read reviews on www.amazon.com,
salon.com, www.allaboutjazz.com, jazztimes.com, and other
Web sites. Many performers go on tour when they have a new recording
to promote. If you don’t like the album, you may not like the concert.
 See who’s in the band: Sometimes jazz musicians record with famous
players and hit the road with their working bands. And sometimes,
there’s better chemistry with the working band. But there are also times
when great players team up for a tour and create something new and
exciting. You should be able to find out the members of a musician’s
touring band on the musician’s Web site (see the previous section).
 Figure out whether the musician is moving ahead or treading water:
For some musicians, every year is a new challenge that brings new com-
positions, collaborations, and evolutionary changes to their technique.
For others, though, some years are spent performing earlier composition
or classic jazz tunes. Articles and interviews in jazz magazines such as
Downbeat and Jazz Times give you a detailed idea of what they’re thinking
and doing and whether it sounds good to you. See the next section for
more details about reviews.
Reading reviews of a tour
Reviewers and critics — some better than others — can give you an excellent
idea of what to expect at a jazz concert. I rely on original writing style and
writers who aren’t afraid to say what they think when I read reviews and
make my decisions about seeing particular shows. (Of course, reviews are
subjective, and you have to decide whether you want to see a performer.
Often your loyalty to a musician far outweighs any information you gather.)
230
Part III: The Beat Goes On: Jazz Appreciation 101

Your sources for reviews range from respected magazines similar to The New
Yorker (well, there’s really no magazine like The New Yorker) to top newspapers
such as The New York Times and writers for a variety of Web sites.
I spent four years reviewing live jazz for the San Diego edition of The Los
Angeles Times. I became interested in writing about music during college, and
my first hero among critics was the San Francisco Chronicle’s Thomas Albright.
He came to my critical review class at the University of California at Berkeley.
Albright wore a floppy moustache and a Civil War coat. His reviews showed
similar flair. He had a gift for capturing the electricity of great live music; his
knowledge of jazz was deep; and he had an ear for the subtler nuances of a
performance.
After you find your own gold standard among writers, you won’t trust just
any review. Here are some writers and publications that I trust when it comes
to reporting and reviewing jazz:
 The New Yorker: Top jazz scribes Whitney Balliett and Francis Davis 
are among those who’ve made this magazine’s jazz coverage highly
respected. Although The New Yorker doesn’t carry reviews or profiles in
every issue, its club and concert listings are a treasure trove of what’s
new with jazz’s leading players. Check out the magazine’s Web site at
www.newyorker.com.
 Downbeat: This magazine is the longtime Bible of jazz fans. I began
reading Downbeat as a teenager and buying albums based on how many
stars they received from the magazine’s reviewers. Hunt down some
back issues, and you may be amazed how many “scoops” the magazine
provided from the beginning, singling out promising talents such as Gene
Krupa and Benny Goodman before they became famous. Pioneering jazz
writers such as Stanley Dance, Leonard Feather, and Helen Oakley helped
Downbeat stake its claim. A subscription costs about $30 a year. Or pick
it up on most newsstands. Downbeat’s Web site (www.downbeatjazz.
com) doesn’t offer as much information as ones hosted by some other
jazz magazines.
 Jazz Times: This magazine, in recent years, has given Downbeat a run
for its money, surpassing its predecessors in size and quality. Jazz Times
features top writers such as Gary Giddins, Nat Hentoff, Bill Milkowsky,
and Josef Woodard. A subscription runs about $24 per year, or find it at
most newsstands. Jazz Times also has a good Web site: jazztimes.com.
 The New York Times: Jazz writer Ben Ratliff and the publication’s broad,
intelligent, forward-looking arts coverage both compel me to include The
Times on my list. Many of jazz’s best performers live in New York, so what
231
Chapter 13: Lovin’ It Live: A Jazz Concert Survival Guide

happens there often signals what’s to come in the rest of the country. I
have a Sunday-only subscription. If you don’t want it every week, pick up
an occasional copy from a major bookstore.
Ratliff’s concert and CD reviews, always delivered with intelligence and
humor, helps you decide which artists deserve your time and ticket
money. The newspaper’s web site (www.nytimes.com) gives you
access to articles by Ratliff and others if you’re a paid subscriber with a
password.
 City newspapers: If a performer is headed for your town from somewhere
else, you can check out reviews from earlier stops on the tour. Use a
search engine to find newspapers in those cities; keep in mind that
sometimes, you have to register for access (usually for free).
 allaboutjazz.com: This Web site is one of the oldest and best jazz
sites. It features a tremendous volume of CD and concert reviews that
give you valuable information on the most recent efforts by jazz artists
of all stripes. Currently, the content is free, which makes the site more
accessible than sites that charge or require you to have a subscription
to a related publication.
 villagevoice.com: This site is the online extension of the subversive
sixties weekly. Check out reviewers led by the brainy Francis Davis,
whose words also appear in The Atlantic Monthly and The New Yorker.
A Room with a View (and Good 
Sound): Assessing Venues
My rule of thumb is that music always takes priority over venue. When you
can catch someone you love in only one venue, you have to sacrifice your
ideals for reality. I’ve heard some great concerts in venues that by the light of
day would probably be condemned by a building inspector.
If it comes down to two great concerts on the same night, I’d rather hear the
one in the better venue. If you have a choice of hearing a performance in your
hometown (San Diego, in my case) or a nearby bigger city (Los Angeles), you
may consider making the trek (2 hours for me) if you discover that the venue
is superior. In San Diego, for instance, I know many music fans who drive to
Los Angeles to hear a performance at the spectacular new Disney Concert
Hall designed by architect Frank Gehry.
232
Part III: The Beat Goes On: Jazz Appreciation 101

In any case, it’s doesn’t hurt to find out a few details about a venue when you’re
preparing to see a show. In the following sections, I explain how to assess a
venue’s sound quality and clue you in on a few unpleasant elements to avoid.
Surveying sound quality
The United States has some of the world’s finest concert halls, and probably
some of the worst. Assessing sound quality is an individual matter, so you
have to evaluate for yourself the various halls and clubs in your region. All
sorts of variables affect the sound, but the bottom line is what you hear from
the audience. After you’ve attended several live performances, you know
which places sound good. Obviously, you want to stick with shows at the
best-sounding venues if possible, although there are times when a must-see
musician is performing somewhere (say, a county fairground) where you
have to settle for sub-par sound.
The center of a room usually offers the best sound. There’s usually a sweet
spot a few rows back from the stage, but not too far back. Occasionally, in a
spacious hall with amplified sound, sitting in the back can be good. The
sound from speakers may be more balanced there than it is if you’re some-
where closer, where you’re getting only part of the music.
However, if you sit too far back, especially in a large concert hall or spacious
theater, you may be the victim of bouncing sounds that, when they reach the
back, are out of whack. Also, if you sit too far off to one side, you risk imbal-
anced sound, especially if there’s a sound system with left and right speakers.
Perhaps the venue hosting your favorite jazz musician isn’t often used for live
music, like a library or a community center. If you’re paying for tickets, ask
local music fans if they’ve heard a show there, or ask the concert promoter
how the room is set up for seating and sound.
Steering clear of a few bad venue features
Flaws that can ruin your live music experience are fairly easy to find. If a venue
you’ve never been to before is presenting some jazz that you really want to
hear, my advice is to take a chance. If your experience is ruined by loud talking,
bad sound, or a poor performance, many places can refund your money or pro-
vide complimentary tickets to a future show. It never hurts to ask.
233
Chapter 13: Lovin’ It Live: A Jazz Concert Survival Guide

Also, if you find yourself in a bad seat (with an obstructed view, too much
street noise, or a loud hum from an air conditioner), tell an usher; he may be
able to move you somewhere better. I once got a sound guy to adjust the mix
so those in the back could hear the guitar better.
Here are a few qualities you don’t want in a club or concert hall:
 Poor location for bar or food concessions: Clinking glasses and ice,
shouting people, and whirring blenders don’t mix with live jazz. I also
find it very distracting when food is served during a performance. To
me, listening to jazz and eating dinner should be separate endeavors. If
you want to eat while you listen, stay home and watch a DVD. Or, if you
own the restaurant, serve food far from the stage.
 Bad lighting: A lighting designer once told me that the effects of the
lighting should be apparent but not the lighting itself. You don’t want
bright lights shining down on you or breaking your lines of sight. Make
sure that venues turn down the house lights during a performance. A
well-lit stage and a darker audience enhance your experience so you can
forget where you are for a while and float away with the music.
 Uncomfortable seating: After shelling out your hard-earned money for a
concert, you want to be comfy while enjoying the show. Some places
have one-size-fits-all seats that really only fit people who weigh about
150 pounds. Of course, the club owner or promoter wants room for as
many paying patrons as possible, but if you’re not driving a compact
body, make sure you find a place with accommodating seats. If you’re
tall, look for an aisle seat where you can stretch your arms and legs.
 Poor sight lines: A lot of jazz clubs operate in converted spaces with
columns, wall angles, and other quirks that make it difficult to see the
stage. If you arrive at a place like this and you’re lucky, the tables and
chairs are moveable. If you can’t see a thing, ask for the manager and
request another seat.
You also run the risk of sitting behind a tall person whose head blocks
the star saxophonist from your view. If you end up in this situation, ask
your neighbor if he would mind trading seats with someone at his table,
or in his row, if it helps more people gain a better view.
As newer clubs come on the scene, many of them accommodate guests
with tiered seating that lets you see over the heads of people in front of
you or eliminate poles and skewed views.
 Inadequate or filthy restrooms: The venue may have its act together
but forget the minor details. Messy restrooms are worse for women than
for men. You might want to scout the place in advance, or ask a friend
who’s visited before.
234
Part III: The Beat Goes On: Jazz Appreciation 101

Have a Seat: Scoring Great 
Tickets Creatively
Most clubs sell tickets in advance. Sometimes you can reserve seats, but
other times it’s first come, first served. At clubs with open seating, you and
your group can send a couple of people early to save seats for you.
Sometimes there is simply no way to get the good seats, at least not through
conventional channels. At medium and large venues, many of the best tickets
are commonly withheld for the band’s friends and family, or for VIPs. That
doesn’t mean you can’t get some of these tickets, though. I have used many
strategies, and have often succeeded. Here are a few tactics to try:
 Playing the media card: If you can write and you like music, you may be
able to review concerts for your community paper and gain free admis-
sion. Sometimes venues hold seats for reviewers.
 Being proactive: If a show is “sold out,” call the venue’s business office.
It may have last-minute extra tickets or know where you can find some.
Once I called the business office of a 1,000-seat outdoor concert venue
the day before a show and asked whether any of the good seats that had
been withheld were unclaimed. They were, and I got them for face value.
Another time, I called the business office of a sports arena where the
235
Chapter 13: Lovin’ It Live: A Jazz Concert Survival Guide
Traveling back in time to the Keystone Korner
I started going to jazz clubs when I was 18 or 19.
Back then, a driver’s license doctored with a
razor blade or a number clipped from a news-
paper and lick-glued over your actual birth date
would often get a teenager into a grownup club.
That’s how I began going to San Francisco’s
fabled Keystone Korner, where, by the time I
graduated from college, I had heard Miles Davis,
Dexter Gordon, Bobby Hutcherson, Rahsaan
Roland Kirk, Sam Rivers, and other legends
before I even knew they were legends.
Keystone was so small that there were no bad
seats in the house. Even in the back row, you
were only 50 feet from the stage, and the sound
filled the room and spilled onto the sidewalk.
Back then it was still kosher to smoke in clubs,
and lots of people did, but somehow it wasn’t
offensive (maybe because I bummed a cigarette
now and then myself). There was also no such
thing as a bad view. Every seat had a clear shot
at the stage. And I don’t remember any noise
from the bar, ice clanging into glasses, or people
shouting for drinks. Maybe I’ve mythologized the
place, but I remember Keystone Korner as the
perfect jazz club.

rock band REM was playing, and asked whether anyone there had special
tickets they weren’t using. They sent me to an employee with front row
center seats, and I ended up getting stared down by Michael Stipe.
 Scalping tickets: When a show is sold out, sometimes you can buy tickets
from someone outside the venue. I have gone to “sold out” concerts and
purchased tickets this way. If you show up about an hour before the
show, the person with the tickets, even a scalper, is getting antsy and
often sells tickets for face value. Bring cash. Don’t be afraid to bargain.
All he can say is no. (In some cities, selling tickets for more than face
value is illegal. But in most cities, people buy and sell tickets outside
venues all the time without any difficulty.)
Also, you can sometimes get tickets at a reasonable price from one of
the “ticket services” (nice words for scalpers). On the day of the show,
they are often caught holding more tickets than they can sell.
 Searching the Internet: Don’t forget online sources. Check on eBay and
www.craigslist.org. A few months back, my daughter was visiting
New York City and dying to attend a sold out Tori Amos show at the
Hammerstein Ballroom. I bought two good seats on eBay, relisted one of
them and sold it, and ended up with one great seat for a reasonable price.
 Calling your local jazz radio station: In most cities, these stations are
small public or college stations. Sometimes they give away tickets on the
air. Their phones aren’t usually too busy, so you may even get a deejay
on the line who gives you advice about concerts, venues, and tickets.
She might even know someone who has extra tickets to sell.
 Frequenting your local independent record stores: These stores are
stocked with knowledgeable clerks. Most stores have a jazz guru who
can recommend CDs and shows and who may have an inside scoop on
tickets.
Creativity is key! But sometimes, there’s no substitute for the good old-
fashioned way: Get there early or buy tickets weeks or months in advance, as
soon as you hear about a show. If you’re buying tickets on site, find out what
time the box office opens, and get there an hour (or sometimes even hours)
early.
Behave Yourself: A Concert 
Etiquette Primer
As you get ready to go to a jazz show, your adrenaline starts pumping. It’s
gonna be great to hang with friends, sit down amid an anxious crowd, sense
the anticipation when the performers walk out, and enjoy the great moment
when they begin playing.
236
Part III: The Beat Goes On: Jazz Appreciation 101

Throughout the course of a concert, you go through many emotions. So do
the musicians. What should you do to be sure you get the most from the
experience while showing the most respect for the players? I give you a few
basic tips in the following sections.
Respond appropriately to the music
You’re in a small recital hall with comfortable seats set on tiers with first-rate
sound and sight lines (for more info on the “perfect seat,” see “A Room with a
View [and Good Sound]: Assessing Venues” earlier in this chapter). But the
audience tends to be a little too conservative for your liking because when
the music gets hot, everyone sits in their seats like stone-cold marble statues.
Now, if I were a musician (well, a good musician), I would find it tough to rise
to the occasion. Many modern jazz players say that they’re proud that you
can hear jazz in concert halls once reserved for classical music. While your
behavior there may be more formal than in a club, musicians still need your
feedback.
So my first bit of advice is to respond to the music — out loud. Here are a few
examples:
 If a saxophonist plays a twisty line that gives you goose bumps, shout
out a word or two of encouragement.
 When the band gets grooving and the bass and drums lock into a solid
groove, clap your hands or stomp your foot in time, or at least wiggle
your head and shoulders.
 When a truly inspired performance comes to an end, be the first to get
on your feet and whistle or yell or clap. See yourself as a catalyst for
your section.
There are times when you should be quiet at a show too. If a solo pianist is
playing a soft, spacious ballad, try not to make noise: no whispering, talking,
cell phone ringing, seat squeaking — and especially no opening of candy,
gum, peanuts, or anything else that comes in that mortifyingly loud plastic.
Check the rules before you snap photos
Another question of etiquette is whether you can take photos at a concert. It’s
possible to sneak shots with a pocket digital camera, if you turn off the flash.
But you get better photos if you call the club or concert hall first and find out if
taking pictures is allowed. Most clubs and concert halls featuring well-known
jazz players probably won’t let you shoot. But smaller clubs may allow it.
237
Chapter 13: Lovin’ It Live: A Jazz Concert Survival Guide

If you’re a serious photographer, write the artist’s manager via the artist’s
Web site. If you can show good samples, and if you offer to provide copies of
anything you get that’s good, the manager may provide you the clearance to
take photos. Who knows?
Offer to shoot a concert for your local paper. This tactic may finagle you a
press pass. Don’t expect payment, but you might get great shots of a famous
player or two.
Approach musicians respectfully
You may dream of meeting your musical hero or at least getting him to sign
an album or photo. This, too, isn’t impossible. In a small club, I’ve often
watched fans tactfully approach the stage or the backstage exits after a show
and get something signed. Some venues offer special opportunities to meet
performers before or after a show, if you buy tickets for a series of concerts
or make a donation to the facility.
Here are a few more tips to obtain that coveted autograph (or at least a word
or a handshake):
 Write a performer a fan letter. As with photo requests (see the previ-
ous section), you can sometimes get a chance to meet your jazz idol.
The more that you can make your case, the better.
• Point to a certain album or song that changed your life.
• Talk about how your son or daughter plays in the high school jazz
band.
 Join the group’s fan club. Many clubs have benefits that include auto-
graph signings before or after a show, free merchandise, or early ticket
sales. Check the performer’s Web site for more information.
 Meet a band member (not the leader) first. Sometimes you can get to a
member of the band more easily than its leader. If you strike up a con-
versation by the stage during intermission or after the show, or at the
exit as you leave, you may be able to ask a band member to ask the
“boss” to sign something.
Most jazz performers aren’t media superstars (except maybe Wynton
Marsalis), and they don’t get mobbed. In fact, a lot of them (unfortunately)
can walk around most any American city without being recognized, although
some performers might draw a crowd in Paris or Tokyo. Most jazz musicians
are grateful for loyal fans like you and express their gratitude through auto-
graphs or handshakes.

Live and Global: Great Jazz 
Venues around the World
Big cities like New York and London have some of the best jazz venues, but
smaller towns have good jazz as well. In fact, hundreds of American cities
have some live jazz. In San Diego, about 20 minutes from the suburb where I
live, Dizzy’s is a small alcohol-free club in a downtown storefront that pre-
sents a mix of local and leading national players. If you come to San Diego,
you find interesting music almost every night of the week at Dizzy’s (www.
dizzyssandiego.com).
Whether you’re bound for Boston, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, Portland,
Tokyo, San Francisco, or another destination, finding a good jazz club gives
your stay a focal point. Plan your trip with jazz in advance, and when you get
there you won’t have the last-minute thumb-the-guidebook blues.
Here are some of the best jazz venues in the country and around the world:
 Baker’s Keyboard Lounge: Detroit, Michigan. Baker’s Keyboard Lounge
bills itself as the “world’s oldest jazz club.” It opened in 1934, and Dave
Brubeck, Cab Calloway, Chick Corea, Gene Krupa, and Sonny Stitt are a
few of the famous players who’ve performed there. In recent years, new
owners have set about restoring it to its former glory. Head to
www.bakerskeyboardlounge.com for its events calendar.
 Birdland, The Iridium, and The Village Vanguard: New York City, New
York. You could spend a month hearing jazz in the Big Apple. Jazz his-
tory was made in these venues. Several live albums were recorded here,
and their walls feature photos of dozens of legends. These clubs offer
world-famous jazz musicians several nights a week. Many venues pre-
sent artists for a week at a time. They often open a series mid-week and
run through the weekend. Most jazz bands sound best after they’ve had
a couple days to get into their groove.
If two shows play each night, try to catch the second one — the music is
generally hotter at the late show. Visit the clubs’ Web sites for touring
info: www.birdlandjazz.com, www.iridiumjazzclub.com, and
www.villagevanguard.net.
 The Blue Note: Various cities. When it comes to classy live jazz, the Blue
Note name has a definite caché in the states (the record label is a separate
business). If you’re looking for a guaranteed night of great jazz, you can’t
go wrong with the Blue Note clubs in Milano, Italy, or Tokyo, Japan. Blue
Notes are also located in Fukuoka, Nagoya, Osaka, and New York City. For

current location. Scott passed away in 1996, but his club (www.ronnie
scotts.co.uk) is world famous and continues to thrive.
 Yoshi’s: Oakland, California. Custom built for jazz, Yoshi’s is the most
comfortable, beautiful, and great-sounding club I’ve been to. Charlie
Haden, Charlie Hunter, Ahmad Jamal, and Mike Stern were all booked
during a recent month. The adjacent Japanese restaurant includes a
sushi bar. The club has won just about every suitable honor bestowed
by area media, and it’s ranked among USA Today’s “10 Great Places for a
Jazzy Night Out.” Visit the club’s Web site: www.yoshis.com.

Traveling Jazz: Your Ticket 
to the Best Festivals
In This Chapter
 Finding out about the Newport Jazz Festival
 Trekking to America’s finest jazz fests
 Going global with festivals around the world
 Reviving traditional jazz
 Planning your trip
Jazz festivals give you a chance to feast on great music for several hours
and even days — if you have the stamina. They offer a completely differ-
ent experience from clubs and concert halls (which I cover in Chapter 13),
but what you give up in intimacy and sound quality is made up for by the
spectacle, camaraderie, and massive energy of these friendly occasions that
are open to the skies and whatever weather they may bring.
No matter where you are in America or the rest of the world, chances are that
a cool jazz festival is a short plane, train, or automobile ride away. There are
dozens of them, ranging from famous international gatherings in Switzerland
and the Netherlands to beloved American fests in Chicago, Detroit, New York,
and other cities.
In this chapter, you look at a variety of jazz festivals in the United States and
abroad. I also show you how to choose one that’s best for you and give you a
few tips on preparing for your trip.

Starting with the Newport Jazz Festival
As a teen, George Wein was an aspiring jazz pianist who studied with legendary
musician Teddy Wilson at Juilliard. But his business side won out, and he
opened his Storyville jazz club in Boston in 1950. Four years later, prompted by
upscale jazz buffs, he launched the Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island.
Today this festival is regarded as the first of the big outdoor music festivals, as
well as a place where many of jazz’s key innovations went on public display for
the first time.
From the start, Newport Jazz (now known as the JVC Jazz Festival at Newport)
presented a phenomenal lineup inspired by Wein’s goal of mixing New Orleans
jazz with swing, bebop, and modern variations. (See Part II for a tour of
different jazz styles.) The first year’s program at the Newport Tennis Casino
included Ella Fitzgerald, Erroll Garner, Dizzy Gillespie, Lee Konitz, Gerry
Mulligan, Oscar Peterson, and Lennie Tristano, as well as a power-packed
tribute to Count Basie featuring Buck Clayton, Vic Dickenson, Milt Hinton, Jo
Jones, Teddy Wilson, and Lester Young.
Today, JVC Jazz Festivals take place in both Newport (August) and New York
City (June). During the summer, satellite versions of the festival are held in
several American cities.
 In Newport, a waterfront town of 26,000 situated on Aquidneck Island in
Narragansett Bay, festival concerts take place during four days at the
Newport Casino at the International Tennis Hall of Fame. The casino,
designed in 1880 in the Shingle style by architects McKim Meade and
White, is a grand piece of American architectural history.
 In New York City, festival concerts take place over the course of 12 days
at Carnegie Hall, the Rose Theater, the Studio Museum of Harlem, and
other venues. Just as Newport takes on the relaxed, breezy atmosphere
of its setting, the New York festival moves to the rhythms of this major
city, with its forest of high-rise buildings and its long tradition of innova-
tive jazz. New York has the world’s highest concentration of top-notch
jazz musicians (and fans!), and that’s reflected in this festival’s ability to
draw stellar talent and big audiences. After all, they don’t have to travel
far to perform. New jazz is often heard first in New York, and it’s inspir-
ing when “locals” like saxophonist Don Byron and guitarist/vocalist John
Pizzarelli bring their latest music and bands here.

Chapter 14: Traveling Jazz: Your Ticket to the Best Festivals
Touring Some American Festivals
America has the best jazz of any country in the world. From coast to coast,
numerous annual festivals give you a chance to experience a rich blend of
international, national, and regional talent. In the following sections, you get
the lowdown on some of the best jazz festivals in the United States.
Chicago Jazz Festival
The Chicago Jazz Festival (www.chicagojazzfestival.org) is held each
September in an exotic outdoor setting: urban Grand Park, with its views of
the downtown high-rise skyline. The city’s eclectic jazz history, from 1920s
hot jazz to 1960s free jazz, is reflected in the four-day schedule. Members of
the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), such as
Joseph Jarman and Leroy Jenkins, come to perform their avant garde music,
but there are also events such as 2005’s “Homage to King Oliver.”
Detroit International Jazz Festival
Billed as “America’s largest free jazz festival” (free as in ticket prices, not free
jazz), this festival, held over Labor Day weekend in September, is an urban
spectacle presented amid downtown high rises in Hart Plaza. Covering its
core bases with performers like Dave Brubeck, T.S. Monk, and McCoy Tyner,
the Detroit festival (www.detroitjazzfest.com) also branches into blues
and other related genres. Often, natives like saxophonist Charles McPherson,
who grew up listening to jazz as well as the Motown soul that originated in
Detroit, revisit their roots with performances here.
Earshot Jazz Festival, Seattle
The Space Needle isn’t Seattle’s only attraction, especially for three weeks in
late October and early November. This city presents a great jazz festival that
includes a broader range of music than many, from blues and spoken word to
the best freeform improvised jazz. Earshot (www.earshot.org) fills several
venues and forces you to appreciate this sparkling clean and artistic city.
Hundreds of performers take to the stage in venues all around town, from inti-
mate clubs to the Seattle Art Museum and the Seattle Symphony’s Nordstrom
Recital Hall at Benaroya Hall, which is renowned for excellent sound. The festi-
val takes full advantage of the rich arts and cultural scene, with jazz films at

the Northwest Film Forum and multimedia performances at Consolidated
Works, a venue for collaborative arts.
Elkhart Jazz Festival, Indiana
Indiana is America’s school band capital and home to Selmer, the famed sax-
ophone company. It stands to reason, then, that Elkhart is a hotbed of jazz.
Elkhart’s jazz fest (www.elkhartjazzfestival.com), covering three days
in June, is a jazz extravaganza occupying seven indoor and outdoor stages
by the Elkhart River. It prides itself on placing you closer to the music than
other fests. Several venues seat 200 to 300; they’re small enough that there’s
not a bad seat in the house. Howard Alden, Shelly Berg, Kenny Davern, Ken
Peplowski, and Bucky Piazzarelli are the kinds of players who turn up here.
Indy Jazz Fest, Indiana
Each June, a couple of weeks after the Indianapolis 500, the city reasserts its
artistic identity with the three-day Indy Jazz Festival (www.indyjazzfest.
net). Broader than just jazz, the three-day event is held outdoors in Military
Park downtown — a 14-acre park in the shape of a military badge, in honor of
the Civil War military camp once based there. This festival is billed as “a
family reunion,” and children under 14 get in free with an adult. Near the
main stage, Neighborhood Row has booths manned by recreational and non-
profit institutions with an emphasis on activities for kids. The musical lineup
has ranged from jazz greats like trombonist Slide Hampton and trumpeter
Christ Botti to blues guitarist Susan Tedeschi and pop singer Tony Bennett.
Monterey Jazz Festival, California
Monterey claims the title “longest running jazz festival in the world” (due to
the fact that the Newport Jazz Festival changed locations). The Monterey
Jazz Festival (www.montereyjazzfestival.org) began in 1958 and has
presented greats like Louis Armstrong, Art Farmer, Dizzy Gillespie, Billie
Holiday, and Max Roach. A counterpoint to the urban vibe of Chicago and
Detroit (covered earlier in this chapter), Monterey Jazz takes over the
Monterey Fairgrounds for three days in September, as the crowd reaches
40,000 plus. Historically, Monterey has been to the West Coast what Newport
Jazz was to the East Coast: the prestigious showplace for some of the
region’s best musicians to rub elbows with their international peers. Among
the West Coasters who have given Monterey its California flavor over the
years are Dave Brubeck, Charles Lloyd, Charles Mingus, and Gerry Mulligan.
244
Part III: The Beat Goes On: Jazz Appreciation 101 

For a taste of Monterey, get the box CD set Monterey Jazz Festival: 40
Legendary Years (Warner). Here, the Left Coast set shares disc space with
Cannonball Adderley, Dizzy Gillespie, and Thelonious Monk. You can decide
whether there’s a difference between the sounds of the East and West coasts.
New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival
Hurricane Katrina, in 2005, made many realize just how much the Big Easy’s
gumbo of authentic American people, architecture, and music is valued. The
New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival (www.nojazzfest.com) is no differ-
ent. Held over two weekends in late April and early May, the festival is a
gumbo of musical flavors, mixing all sorts of jazz with blues, country, folk,
rock, soul, blues, and regional specialties like brass bands, Terrence Simien,
Buckwheat Zydeco, and various Cajun and Bayou music. The 2005 event even
had a tribute to blues giant Howlin’ Wolf, featuring living legend Hubert
Sumlin. Despite some Katrina damage, the festival carried on in 2006 as usual
at the New Orleans Fair Grounds.
Playboy Jazz Festival, Hollywood
Hef’s Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles has a magnetic pull for celebrities, and
the Playboy festival (www.festivalproductions.net) in June is no less
glitzy an affair, with its star-spangled audience and famous host: comedian
Bill Cosby. The lineup may range from bona fide jazzers like Dave Brubeck,
Dave Holland, and Poncho Sanchez to Brazilian diva Daniela Mercury and
gospel group the Blind Boys of Alabama. The festival also celebrates music
such as gypsy, reggae, and salsa. The setting is superb: the Hollywood Bowl,
an architectural monument with a bandshell designed by Lloyd Wright
(Frank’s son), remodeled in a not-quite-authentic form said to improve the
sound. It’s a beautiful place to hear music on a warm California night.
Portland Jazz Festival, Oregon
Oregon’s African-American history is rooted in the men and women who came
here to build military ships during World War II. Since then, the city has sup-
ported a core of local players in a string of clubs. The Portland Jazz Festival
(www.pdxjazz.com) sprawls over ten days in February and is one of the best
in the country, with most concerts held in downtown hotel ballrooms. The
lineups are among the strongest anywhere. Maybe the lush forests and views
of the Cascade Mountains call players like Dee Dee Bridgewater, Ravi Coltrane,
Jim Hall, Nicholas Payton, and McCoy Tyner each year.
245
Chapter 14: Traveling Jazz: Your Ticket to the Best Festivals

San Francisco Jazz Festival
Unlike other festivals that bunch a ton of events into a few days, San
Francisco spreads its festival (www.sfjazz.org) through several weeks in
October and November. The jazz ranges from promising high schoolers to
top professionals including experimental pioneers like Don Byron, Ornette
Coleman, and the World Saxophone Quartet, along with authentic music from
Africa and other international locales. There’s always a strong contingent of
famous locals, too, such as Bobby Hutcherson, Joshua Redman, and Pharoah
Sanders — players who remind you that while the West Coast is best known
for cool jazz, edgier stuff is here, too.
Telluride Jazz Celebration, Colorado
Travel along winding mountain roads to this three-day indoor/outdoor bash
held every August in this former mining town high in the San Juan Mountains,
where the air is thinner and the mountain views are spectacular. At the
Telluride Jazz Festival (www.telluridejazz.com), listen to the likes of Ron
Carter, Dave Holland, John Scofield, and Lizz Wright. You won’t find a healthier-
looking crowd anywhere. Many of these folks spend their spare time scaling
peaks and fishing mountain creeks.
Foreign Affairs: Jazz Festing Abroad
With the lineups and crowds at their festivals, you almost get the feeling that
Europeans like jazz more than Americans. It’s a fact that American musicians
including Chet Baker, Sidney Bechet, Dexter Gordon, and Bud Powell became
European expatriates because they felt more appreciated.
European jazz festivals offer the chance to experience first-rate jazz in color-
ful locales. Many of these events combine top American players with excel-
lent natives, so the music sounds fresh — especially if the lyrics are in a
foreign language. In the following sections, I take you on a global tour of some
of the best international jazz fests.
Copenhagen Jazz Festival, Denmark
Scandinavia’s largest city hosts a fine jazz festival that begins the first Friday
in July and runs for ten days. Established players such as Gary Burton, Chick
246
Part III: The Beat Goes On: Jazz Appreciation 101 

Corea, Hank Jones, and Brad Mehldau are mainstays, along with contempo-
rary Scandinavians such as keyboard and synthesizer wiz Bugge Wesseltoft.
The Copenhagen Jazz Festival (festival.jazz.dk) is a place where you
hear many European languages as well as all sorts of English accents,
brought together by the universal “language” that is jazz. It’s a great way to
see the city because many concerts are free in urban parks and plazas.
Guelph Jazz Festival, Canada
This humble burg (its population is just over 100,000) at the junction of the
Speed and Eramosa does jazz in a big way. Founded in 1994, the Guelph Jazz
Festival (www.guelphjazzfestival.com) is held during five days in early
September and leans toward experimental jazz and improvisational music by
artists such as the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Mark Dresser, Joseph Jarman,
Roscoe Mitchell, Pauline Oliveros, and Wadada Leo Smith. Sometimes the
musicians collaborate with artists working in other media, such as visual art
or dance. The lineup also includes musicians from around the world: Asia to
Indonesia to Europe, as well as a lot of Canadian talent. In the tradition of
New Orleans, the festival knows how to take jazz to the streets — its 40th
anniversary tribute to the AACM consisted of a parade led by the 17-piece
Fanfare Pourpour through the heart of Guelph.
Guinness Jazz Festival, Cork, Ireland
World-class beer, the rugged Atlantic coastline, and rich farmlands cut by
river valleys — you couldn’t ask for a better setting than Ireland’s Guinness
Jazz Festival (www.corkjazzfestival.com), held during four days at the
end of October. The event mixes American talents like Chick Corea and
McCoy Tyner with rising Irish stars such as Dylan Rynhart and various
Europeans.
International Festival Musique Actuelle,
Victoriaville, Canada
Held in May in this city outside Montreal, this five-day festival (www.fimav.
qc.ca) emphasizes cutting-edge improvised music. One year it tossed free
jazz explorer Anthony Braxton together with the experimental Detroit elec-
tronic band Wolf Eyes. It also featured rock and feedback master Thurston
Moore from the rock group Sonic Youth and a group called The Boredoms. 
If you like jazz that pushes boundaries, this fest is your zone.
247
Chapter 14: Traveling Jazz: Your Ticket to the Best Festivals

Jazz Festival Willisau, Switzerland
American musicians like Don Byron, Dave Liebman, and Joe Lovano join tal-
ented jazzers from throughout Europe for four days of live music in early
September in this medieval town between Bern and Zurich. If you want con-
vincing evidence that Europeans are no slouches when it comes to innovative
jazz, go hear the Americans and Euros go head-to-head at this festival (www.
jazzwillisau.ch).
Malta Jazz Festival
In the center of the Mediterranean, Malta provides a great summer escape to a
festival held in the 16th-century capital city Valletta. The three-day Malta Jazz
Festival (www.maltajazzfest.com), held in July, offers a lineup that has
ranged from drummer Brian Blade to avant garde saxophonist and composer
John Zorn to Argentine composer Dino Saluzzi, a master of the bandoneon (a
small accordion especially popular in Latin America). While you listen to the
music, look up from the harborfront to the castle, built in the 16th century by
the Knights of St. John.
Moers International New 
Jazz Festival, Germany
Players from around the world (representing 14 nations one year) join the
best from the United States for an extended weekend of music making every
May, in the small town of Moers, near Dusseldorf. As it’s matured over 30
years, the Moers festival (www.moers-festival.com) has acquired an
experimental atmosphere. Performances range from contemporary big bands
to turntable masters to musicians from Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Nigeria,
Senegal, Trinidad, and Yemen. Now that’s international!
Montreux Jazz Festival, Switzerland
Switzerland’s stunning Lake Geneva in July sets the stage for the Montreux
Jazz Festival — the granddaddy of the Euro fests.
One of the first jazz albums that grabbed my attention was Les McCann and
Eddie Harris’s 1969 Swiss Movement, especially the song that became their
248
Part III: The Beat Goes On: Jazz Appreciation 101 

signature: “Compared to What.” At the time, the festival — brainchild of
Swiss jazz buff Claude Nobs — was a mere rookie and has since become
world famous.
As in relationships, Europeans aren’t as cut-and-dried as Americans are with
their musical categories. At Montreux’s “jazz” festival (www.montreux-jazz.
com), for instance, the music ranges from Crosby, Stills & Nash and B.B. King
to George Benson, Marcus Miller, and Oscar Peterson.
North Sea Jazz Festival, Rotterdam, 
the Netherlands
This three-day jazz party in July is known for the consistent high quality of its
music. In 1976, the North Sea Jazz Festival (www.northseajazz.nl) began
with a boom; the lineup included Count Basie’s big band, Dizzy Gillespie, Sun
Ra, Horace Silver, Cecil Taylor, and Randy Weston. It’s matured since then,
featuring an international flock of musicians in jazz and related genres. In
2006, this festival moved to Rotterdam, a booming industrial town, from its
longtime home in The Hague.
Umbria Jazz Festival, Perugia, Italy
The hilltop town of Perugia has addictive chocolate, the most amazing old
buildings (and narrow streets), and, since 1973, one of Europe’s best jazz fests,
spanning ten days in July. Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis played there in the
early years, and the festival has sustained its reputation for booking the best
American and European players. The Umbria Jazz Festival (www.umbriajazz.
com) offers the benefit of excellent jazz, spectacular old architecture, and a
core of enthusiastic Italian jazz fans who mingle with tourists from around the
world.
Checking Out Traditional Jazz Festivals
Old-school New Orleans jazz (see Chapter 5 for details), dominated by horns
and moving to basic one-two-one-two marching rhythms, enjoyed a revival in
the 1950s and remains extremely popular on an underground festival circuit
today. (Underground doesn’t mean the traditional jazz movement is small,
only that it flies mostly under the radar of American media.)
249
Chapter 14: Traveling Jazz: Your Ticket to the Best Festivals

Festival circuit bands have names that reek of nostalgia: The Bearcats, Buck
Creek, Cornet Chop Suey, Night Blooming Jazzmen, Royal Society Jazz
Orchestra, Titanic Jazz Band, and the 101st Army Dixieland Band. For music
largely invented by black musicians in the South, today’s traditional jazz festi-
vals are mostly inhabited by white musicians in the West. The music is mostly
in the same vein, and many of the same bands show up at several festivals.
Here are a few traditional fests to start you off:
 Colorado River Jazz Festival, Blythe, California: Blythe is a tiny town
on the California-Nevada border that sizzles in summer and is one of the
warmest spots in the country in February, when the Colorado River Jazz
Festival (home.earthlink.net/~blythejazzfest) takes place over
three days at the Colorado River Fair Grounds. The dry, flat, desert
beauty of the place provides a beautiful backdrop for a mix of jazz by
some of the groups named earlier, as well as distinctly West Coast bands
like Alcatraz Angeles (named after the island in San Francisco Bay that
was once home to a famous prison).
 Dixieland Jazz by the Sea, San Clemente, California: San Clemente is a
coastal beach town midway between San Diego and Los Angeles that
plays host to the Dixieland festival (www.sanclementerotary.org/
jazz) for two days each May. Unlike other Southern California cities,
San Clemente retains much of its original charm, with neighborhood
restaurants and shops and small, reasonably affordable motels. The fes-
tival is held at the San Clemente Community Center, a cozy Spanish-style
building typical of the area’s regional architecture.
 Dixieland-Monterey’s Jazz Bash by the Bay, California: Monterey 
has some of California’s earliest history and one of the longest-running
traditional jazz festivals. Dixieland-Monterey’s Jazz Bash by the Bay
(www.dixieland-monterey.com) began in 1980 and emphasizes 
classic jazz, big bands, swing, and ragtime. The waterfront location is a
draw not only for fans but also for top-drawer jazz acts that perform at
the three-day festival in early March. You hear echoes of Louis Armstrong,
Sidney Bechet, Jelly Roll Morton, and old New Orleans bands dominated
by trumpets, trombones, tubas, banjos, and clarinets.
 Sacramento Jazz Jubilee: The largest of the traditional jazz festivals,
the Jubilee (www.sacjazz.com) draws more than 100,000 rabid fans to
California’s capital city to hear 125 bands during four days over
Memorial Day weekend. The fest emphasizes traditional jazz, but since
the first event more than 30 years ago, it’s expanded to include gospel,
Latin, western swing, and zydeco.
 San Diego Thanksgiving Dixieland Jazz Festival: While the rest of the
nation begins its autumn chill, San Diego often gets a hot desert wind
known as a “Santa Ana” that takes temperatures into the summer range.
250
Part III: The Beat Goes On: Jazz Appreciation 101 

Jazz fans from colder climes escape for a five-day weekend of jazz that
begins the Wednesday night before Thanksgiving. The Dixieland Jazz
Festival (www.dixielandjazzfestival.org/festival.htm) books
bands from around the world alongside American groups. You haven’t
lived until you’ve heard a band like Paris Washboard (from France) belt-
ing out authentic American jazz.
Planning a Trip to a Festival
You’ve read about a few of the best festivals, and hundreds more around the
world feature all sorts of jazz. So how do you decide where to go?
 Do some research. A search engine like Google is your best friend. You
can find reviews of many jazz festivals dating back several years. These
reviews give you a good idea of the music and the shortcomings, such as
uncomfortable venues and poor sound.
 Consider cost. Your choices range from a festival close to home to one
requiring air travel, hotel rooms, ground transportation, and meals.
 Choose a festival that has a lot of the music you like. If you lean toward
experimental jazz, don’t go to a traditional jazz festival. And if you’re
purely into old-school jazz, you probably won’t be satisfied by one of the
more progressive festivals. Also, if you’re a jazz purist, take a close look
at what music is presented under the “jazz” banner. Many festivals fea-
ture some jazz alongside all sorts of other music.
Here are a few more tips for planning your great jazz getaway:
 Start planning your jazz festival vacation at least six months in
advance. If you have a line on a good travel agent, he can help with
details. If you’re reasonably organized, though, you can do a lot of plan-
ning and booking (of flights, hotels, rental cars, and so on) online. Before
you make travel plans, though, be sure to purchase or reserve your tick-
ets. Many festivals sell out in advance.
In cities that host major festivals, the best hotels are likely to be booked
well in advance. With a little research online, you can figure out whether
you want to stay near the festival, or maybe in a quaint, less crowded
location not far away.
 Check the weather of the city you plan to visit. Some places are dry as
a bone, and others get torrential rains. Some have T-shirt weather, and
others require warm jackets — especially at night in mountain locations.
251
Chapter 14: Traveling Jazz: Your Ticket to the Best Festivals

 Bring along your CDs for an autograph. Aside from the usual items that
a traveler needs, a jazz fan might bring CDs or photos by one of the fea-
tured artists and ask for an autograph. It’s not tacky at all to ask, unless
you go sell it later on eBay.
 Bring your camera. Make sure that you have plenty of film or a capa-
cious memory card in your digital camera. (I prefer a pocket-size digital
camera in hand for spontaneous shooting.) At a small-town fest, you can
never tell when one of the musicians may materialize unexpectedly,
giving you a shot at a candid photo. Keep in mind that cameras aren’t
allowed in many of the major jazz festivals, but smaller traditional jazz
festivals usually let you snap pictures.

to organize a band, and what you need to know before 
you take that band on the road. And if you want to take

Chapter 15
Feeding the Jazz Jones: Advice 
for Aspiring Players
In This Chapter
 Introducing kids to music
 Choosing an appropriate instrument
 Finding and working with a great teacher
 Studying music in college
A
love of jazz can be cultivated from childhood. Some experts even
believe that exposing a child to music before birth jumpstarts the
process. Children are capable of playing instruments at an early age, and the
benefits of hands-on musical experiences are tremendous. Studies are show-
ing that exposure to music helps students excel in science and math, and an
early interest in music can blossom into a passion that adds richness to life.
While all sorts of music can be gratifying as either a profession or a hobby,
jazz may be the most diverse, challenging, and consistently rewarding. It
combines the discipline and complexity of classical music with the raw emo-
tion of blues and gospel. Even children who can’t walk yet smile and wave
their arms and try to move to music when they hear it.
So how do you introduce your child to jazz? How do you help him choose an
instrument and find a teacher who conveys a healthy balance of fun and dis-
cipline? What can you do if you (or your child) want to pursue music at the
college level? In this chapter, I talk about ways to point young people toward
a deep involvement with music.

Sparking an Interest in Music
There’s one easy way to tell whether children are ready for music lessons: If
they ask, they’re ready. If you’re in tune with your children, you can tell when
they’re interested. You may notice them paying rapt attention to a musician
in a park or on TV. Or maybe they drum their hands like crazy to the radio.
Perhaps they invent melodies and lyrics. You also can use parent-teacher
conferences at school to get a sense of their musical interest or ability.
Part of your job as a parent is to let your children experience music, musi-
cians, and instruments. To figure out whether to invest in lessons, weigh your
youngster’s interest in music and playing an instrument with your inclina-
tions as a parent and your child’s personality and natural talents.
The famous “Suzuki Method” starts children on violin when they’re three or
four years old. But that’s pretty young. Generally, by the age of six or seven, a
child has developed the interest, physical skill, concentration, and cognitive
ability needed to benefit from music instruction.
Before children are ready for lessons, steer them toward music every chance
you get.
 Let your children hear and see live musicians.
• Invite a friend over who plays an instrument and have him 
perform.
• Go to a mall that has live music on weekends.
• Visit a neighborhood park with a summer jazz series.
• Sign children up for school field trips to the symphony, or take
them to a performance yourself.
• Attend church services as a great place for a no-pressure sample of
music. Countless blues, country, and jazz performers, from Ella to
Elvis, began their singing careers in church choirs.
 Be a role model.
• Show your kids how to use the stereo, and set one up where they
can use it often.
• Encourage your children to look at your albums and play them.
• Take family trips to record stores and buy a CD if they find one
they like — within the limits of their weekly allowance, of course.
256
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: The Jazz Musician 

• Don’t put your instruments away in a closet. Leave them where
they’re convenient for spur-of-the-moment jamming. Hang guitars
on wall hooks and reinforce the idea that music is an integral part
of daily life, not a separate pursuit that’s only for special people.
 Give children inexpensive instruments as birthday and holiday gifts.
• A plastic recorder is only $10 or $15. Many elementary schools
include group recorder lessons as part of basic curriculum.
• A wood block provides an economical introduction to drumming,
and snare drums and African djembe drums cost less than $100.
Although this book is about jazz, it’s most important that children develop an
interest in music, instead of a specific type of music. Regardless of which
instrument you and your child choose (see the next section), it’s a fact that
children absorb music (like they discover languages) much faster and more
naturally than adults. No right way exists, per se, to lead a child into music.
The most important thing is to make music available, encourage it, and see
how it evolves in a young, creative mind.
If you like, try the following ideas to aim children specifically toward jazz:
 Jazz instruments such as bass, drums, saxophone, and trumpet are
tough for four- and five-year-olds, but you can play a lot of jazz CDs for
them. Show them pictures of great jazz players like Charlie Parker, Miles
Davis, and Duke Ellington, and tell a few stories about them.
 Some great books about jazz have been written especially for children.
Duke Ellington: The Piano Prince and His Orchestra by Andrea Davis
Pinkney (Hyperion) is great for young readers, or to read to young chil-
dren. So is If I Only Had a Horn: Young Louis Armstrong by Roxanne Orgill
(Houghton Mifflin). Your local librarian or bookstore clerk can recom-
mend other titles.
Some children are so passionate about music that all you have to do is guide
them and help with details (and write the checks). Other kids need encour-
agement and aren’t as self-directed. Music lessons can be worthwhile even
for children who don’t seem eager. After a little effort on their part and
encouragement from you, many young musicians get the bug. If things don’t
work out, that’s okay; some children simply aren’t interested in playing an
instrument. But after those early years are gone, you can’t go back and
wonder whether music should’ve been a bigger part of your kids’ lives.
257
Chapter 15: Feeding the Jazz Jones: Advice for Aspiring Players

Selecting the Right Instrument
Which instrument should your child play? If he’s ready for lessons, hopefully
he tells you, but other factors can come into play. In the following sections, I
show you what to consider as you and your child decide on an instrument.
(Check out Chapter 4 for more information on the instruments of jazz music.)
Trying out instruments for size
One consideration is practical: Children need to start with an instrument that
suits their age, size, and strength. They should be able to reach basic fingering
positions on a neck or keyboard or keys on wind instruments such as flutes,
saxophones, and trumpets. A full-size bass is too much for a 6- or 8-year-old,
but a 1⁄4- or 1⁄2-size model should do the trick.
There’s also a practical element of the instrument’s own size and volume. If your
child takes a bus to school every day, a smaller instrument is easier to carry. If
you live in a modest apartment, condominium, or mobile home, a trumpet or
electric guitar might prove to be too much for you or your neighbors.
If your child’s school has a music program (no sure thing these days), a
teacher may demonstrate instruments and let a child decide which one to
play. If not, encourage music by attending concerts or visiting music stores.
Surveying the pros and cons 
of specific instruments
What kind of music does your child want to play? Basses, drums, saxophones,
and trumpets are prominent in jazz, but any instrument (and genre) is a good
place to start. All roads can lead to jazz eventually. I give you the lowdown on
the pros and cons of several instruments in the following sections.
If you have two children who are both learning instruments, think about getting
them involved with different instruments. This tactic avoids sibling rivalry and
gives each child her own territory to excel in.
Brass and wind instruments
Many children who gravitate toward wind instruments begin with the clar-
inet. It’s less cumbersome to play and more portable than a saxophone. Keep
in mind, though, that the clarinet requires a strong embouchure — musical
258
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: The Jazz Musician 

terminology for the set of lips and tongue that, along with breath, control the
sound of a wind instrument. Beginning clarinetists can be frustrated by the
challenge of getting a good sound.
Later, the same techniques used on a clarinet can be transferred to a saxo-
phone. Saxophones are cool because they’re the most common “stars” of a
jazz band. Young extroverts tend to take to the saxophone.
Trumpets deliver big, gratifying sounds. Beginning bands play music that
calls for two- and three-note trumpet parts.
Strings
Children as young as three can play downsized violins. Suzuki training is
specifically designed for very young children to learn music by ear and
master technique before they have the cognitive ability to read music. Violin
is a great way to get into music through school bands and orchestras, but
remember that violins aren’t common in jazz.
Guitars and basses, on the other hand, are core instruments in jazz and great
instruments for beginners. Guitars are easier for young, small hands to get a
grip on; jazz basses don’t have frets and their strings are huge compared with
guitar strings. It’s harder to get good sound from a bass. But both basses and
guitars are available in children’s models. A child can also start on guitar and
switch to bass later.
Drums
Drums are easy to get sound from right away. Child-size drum sets are avail-
able and so are small hand-played drums from around the world. Because
rhythms form the foundation of jazz (and pretty much all music), and because
percussion is a satisfying outlet for youthful energy, drums are great instru-
ments to start with. The downside to drums is that you can’t play melodies.
Children who already love humming and singing and fooling around on a
piano may be happier with another instrument.
Pianos
Traditionally, American children begin their musical educations on piano.
The great thing about piano is that it covers several octaves and combines
several parts of a piece: bass lines, chords, melodies, and various rhythms.
Because the keys are laid out in a row and easy to see, the piano is a good
instrument for gaining a basic knowledge of musical theory: how notes,
chords, and harmonies work.
Countless jazz composers and musicians began their musical training on
piano. It’s surprising how many pros who play other instruments still use a
259
Chapter 15: Feeding the Jazz Jones: Advice for Aspiring Players

piano to practice, teach, or compose. Pianists, though, can be lonely. If your
young musician likes working independently, this instrument may be a nat-
ural choice. On the other hand, band instruments come together in a collabo-
rative social environment that can be good for both loners and outgoing kids.
Large and unusual instruments
Some less popular instruments give children some elbow room. If your child
gets good, his talent and instrument can be more in demand. On one hand,
your child might feel self-conscious with a harp or bassoon; on the other, she
can feel special.
The tuba is surprisingly satisfying, standing out as the anchor of a piece’s
bottom end. In general, though, larger instruments including harps and trom-
bones are best for children age 10 and older.
Deciding whether to rent or buy
Should you rent or buy? It’s better to rent at first. You know within a few
weeks or months if music lessons agree with your child or whether you’ve
chosen the right instrument. After you discover a basic level of interest and
commitment, you can buy an instrument. Many music stores credit your
rental fees toward a purchase.
Some instruments used in jazz can be expensive. Here are some estimates for
beginners’ equipment:
 Saxophones and trumpets: Under $1,000
 Electric jazz guitar: Under $1,000
 Acoustic bass: $2,500 and up
 Drums: Under $1,000
 Piano: Thousands of dollars
And don’t forget about upgrades! In high school, many musicians want better
instruments. Wind instruments such as clarinets, flutes, and saxophones
become expensive. Some parents invest $5,000 or more in an upgrade. But 
if a child stops playing, many high-quality instruments can be sold for 50 
percent or more of their original price.
Making the Most of Lessons
When a child starts music lessons, it’s essential to find a teacher whose style
suits the student. You also need to make sure that you provide support for
your child’s practice routine. I cover these topics in the following sections.
260
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: The Jazz Musician 

Don’t put too much stock in those stories of gifted children who began music
lessons at age 3 or 4. There are just as many success stories about musicians
who found their calling in middle school or high school. Whatever you do,
don’t become a stage parent who puts too much pressure on your child, and
don’t satisfy shortcomings in your own childhood music experiences by
living vicariously through your child.
Finding a terrific teacher
In most communities, from small to large, there are many music teachers.
Drive around your community and you may pass music stores and private
homes with signs for music lessons. The Yellow Pages list music stores, music
lessons, and music teachers. Newspaper classified ads offer more choices.
So how do you find a teacher who’s right for your child? Heed the following
advice to find the most reputable and worthy teachers in your area:
 Rely heavily on word of mouth. This tool is your best. Ask if your 
child has friends who’re already taking lessons, and ask teachers for 
recommendations.
 Call two or three music stores to find out whether they offer lessons.
Different stores offer lessons on different instruments. Ask how much
the store charges for lessons, how long the lessons are, and what qualifi-
cations they require of their instructors.
 Check your local high school and college to find a music teacher.
High school teachers look for experience and usually don’t charge for
lessons. They want experience, satisfaction, and credit for service work
that can be listed on college applications.
College students usually charge for their services, but their rates are
often lower than what you’d pay a full-time professional or music store
instructor. Graduate students are particularly well qualified. Most of
them have years of experience playing and teaching.
Choose two or three candidates and talk to each of them — bring your child
along to see some interaction. Treat the meeting like an interview but a little
less formal. Find out the following information:
 Background in music: Have they performed or recorded professionally?
Do they have a degree in music? How long have they been teaching?
 Philosophy of teaching music: What do they do at the first few lessons?
How much practice do they require of students? Many teachers hold
periodic recitals featuring their students. Some have connections with
youth bands and orchestras and encourage their protégés to participate.
Public performances can be difficult for introverts, but they offer a
chance to gain confidence and experience.
261
Chapter 15: Feeding the Jazz Jones: Advice for Aspiring Players

 Evaluation of a student’s progress: Do they expect a new scale or piece to
be learned each week? Do they ask a child to practice a certain number of
hours each week and have a parent initial a time card? Does a child learn
one new piece each month? And how do they reward success? Young
players love it when a teacher sticks a little star on a sheet of music 
that’s been mastered.
 Rates: Rates can range quite a bit. One teacher I know gives 30-minute
lessons for $20; another offers 1-hour lessons for $50. Some teachers let
you pay by the lesson; others ask that you pay for a month of lessons up
front. Discounts may be available if you pay for several lessons at once.
 Cancellation policies: Some teachers have liberal policies and others
make you pay for missed lessons. In fairness to teachers, they rely on
having regular students to provide consistent income. It’s bad etiquette
to cancel constantly or change the schedule all the time.
 Expectations for parents: You need to know what the teacher expects
from you. Suzuki instruction requires parental participation. Obviously,
the older the child, the less parental supervision is necessary.
It’s common for budding musicians to have several different private instruc-
tors between grade school and high school. By eighth or ninth grade, many
kids tell you if they’re bored with their teachers.
Keeping an eye on the practice routine
When lessons begin, your role is to provide support. Aside from paying and
providing transportation, you need to encourage more than criticize. When 
a child starts lessons, teachers don’t usually want parents to be there. The
presence of a parent is a big distraction from the basic learning process and
the bond that should form between student and mentor.
It takes several lessons for most beginners to get basic sound from an instru-
ment and several more to be able to play a piece or two. You hear by trial and
error at first, but make sure to love those squeaks and squawks and botched
notes as signs of effort. Young players won’t get into jazz until they’ve mas-
tered basic skills.
Music teachers believe it’s a good idea to set aside a place in your home for
practicing. This hallowed ground could be the garage, the family room, a bed-
room, a den, and so on. Follow these points for consistent practice:
 Playing in the same place each time builds consistency. Get your aspir-
ing player practicing and in the groove as a habit more than a chore.
 Delete distractions. Don’t leave the television or stereo going in another
room; unplug the phone, or turn off the cell phone.
262
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: The Jazz Musician 

 Regularity is more important than the length of each practice session.
It’s better to practice 20 or 30 minutes each day than an hour a couple
times a week.
Without being too nosy, see whether your child’s teacher provides a good prac-
tice routine. Assignments vary according to age, so younger students should
be watching, imitating, and practicing. Musicians who are 5 or 6 years old don’t
have the language and abstract thinking skills of 10- or 12-year-olds, who can
master more advanced methods of analyzing and playing written music.
Beginners need to know exactly what to do for each five or ten minutes of
their practice sessions. The sessions should have enough flexibility that the
child doesn’t get bored. The routine needs to vary to keep young students
interested. Because improvisation is a part of jazz, students often have a
period of each lesson or practice session devoted to spontaneous invention.
Ask the music teacher to recommend CDs. Listening to these together can 
be a great way for you and your child to rally around music. It’s great fun to
figure out the ways in which rhythms, melodies, and harmonies fit together,
and to distinguish improvised sections from those that are composed. You
can talk about the moods and images each of you gets from a piece.
Many parents face the challenge of children who are bored of practicing or
even refuse to do it. Younger, newer students require more flexibility here.
Don’t give up too soon. Sometimes you can work with your child and his
teacher to develop a more satisfying practice plan. Try shorter sessions or
different music. If a child consistently refuses to play and tells you that he
can’t stand lessons, after a few weeks you may decide to steer him toward 
art classes, competitive sports, or another outlet for energy and creativity.
Pursuing Music in College
With more than 1,300 college and university music programs to choose from
in the United States, you (or your high school senior) can spend a lot of time
selecting a school with a strong music program. In the following sections, I
discuss the different facets of a college education in music and give you a list
of some great music schools in the U.S.
Receiving a well-rounded education
A young musician’s educational path depends on his goals. For those set on
careers as performers, many college programs offer a performance emphasis.
However, making a living as a performer is difficult. Some students wind 
up graduating to careers in completely different fields, and others pursue
263
Chapter 15: Feeding the Jazz Jones: Advice for Aspiring Players

jazz-related careers that don’t involve performance, such as artist manager,
arts administrator, author, concert promoter, critic, editor, educator, radio
host, record producer, and talent scout (known as “artists and repertoire”).
Many college students advance their musical educations on several fronts:
 Majoring in music or take several music classes while majoring in other
subjects ranging from liberal arts to sciences and technology.
 Performing in department of music groups and ensembles, but they also
have jazz groups of their own that play outside gigs.
 Taking private lessons with college professors and extra lessons with off-
campus instructors to gain a variety of experience.
Some undergraduate programs let students pursue jazz within a broader con-
text of music. For instance, the University of California, San Diego has two
jazz ensembles and a variety of jazz classes so students can learn history and
theory and gain performance experience. But there are also classes in music
history dating back centuries, in critical thinking, in computer music, and in
various other areas of music unrelated to jazz.
Even within a jazz program, an education can take many directions. Some stu-
dents concentrate on performance, and others focus on composition. Some
students aim for careers as professors and teachers, and others want jobs in
music administration. Music degrees with an emphasis on jazz usually require
non-jazz classes. Any good jazz program can produce a student with a solid
knowledge of jazz history and performance, as well as some knowledge of
other musical traditions. Boundaries between genres such as blues, classical,
and jazz are breaking down, so it’s healthy for students with a primary inter-
est in jazz to study many other types of music and perform with players in
many other styles. A lot of musicians love performing live jazz, but they also
play bluegrass, blues, classical, and other music. The more styles you can
play the more gigs you may get.
Although it’s not often discussed, I think it’s worthwhile for young musicians
to consider adding a few business classes to their college educations. Some
universities offer classes in the business side of music: managing public arts
organizations, negotiating recording contracts, managing talent. No matter
how gifted a musician is as a performer, knowledge of business is invaluable
because everyone needs to earn a living, manage a career, and know about
financial matters. In today’s industry, more and more artists are going the
independent route and distributing their music through Web sites and self-
produced CDs, so it’s valuable to have knowledge of business and finance.
Today’s successful jazz performers often have multi-faceted careers, making
contributions in other areas of music. While they maintain busy performance
schedules, some write books and operas, and still others explore the leading
edge of musical technology and computers. Most young musicians today
264
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: The Jazz Musician 

have grown up with a computer as a second “instrument” in their arsenal.
The more a young artist knows about all aspects of music, the better.
Looking at top music schools
Choosing a college or university is a subjective matter that takes into account
many factors: a student’s personality, preferences, and career goals; the
school’s programs; the school’s faculty; tuition fees; housing options; and
even the weather. That said, the following sections cover a few music schools
that have a reputation as excellent choices for aspiring jazz players.
Of course this is only a basic primer. You can find more detailed information
in many books and Web sites, including individual college and university
sites, as well as sites that give a broader view. Here are a few places to find
information about college music programs:
 The International Association for Jazz Education: Promoting jazz edu-
cation, the IAJE counts more than 8,000 educators and musicians from
around the world as members. The IAJE presents clinics and confer-
ences and hosts an annual meeting. It’s an excellent source of informa-
tion related to jazz education. The group’s Web site (www.iaje.org)
lists top college jazz programs around the world.
 The National Association for Music Education: Visit menc.org for
detailed descriptions of careers in music.
 The Student’s Guide to College Music Programs (Symphony): This
book lists many of America’s best music schools and provides informa-
tion on financial aid and careers in music.
 U.S. News & World Report: The magazine publishes an annual “best
colleges” issue, and some of the schools offer excellent music programs.

265
Chapter 15: Feeding the Jazz Jones: Advice for Aspiring Players

 Music synthesis
 Music therapy
 Performance
 Professional music
 Songwriting
As many as 85 percent of Berklee grads land a career in music. In many cir-
cles, a degree from Berklee is considered the gold standard. Compared with
campuses of major universities that often enroll 20,000 or 30,000 students,
Berklee is relatively small with a student body of just under 4,000.
Quincy Jones, Branford Marsalis, Dave Samuels, and Tierney Sutton are only
a handful of Berklee graduates with prominent careers in jazz. In 2005 alone,
Berklee alumni and faculty received a total of 23 Grammy nominations. For
more information on the Berklee School of Music, visit www.berklee.edu.

Wynton Marsalis serves as music director. Juilliard’s faculty includes drum-
mers Lewis Nash and Herlin Riley, pianist Kenny Barron, and Marsalis.
New York University (NYU)
New York, New York hosts this huge university, totaling its enrollment at
about 50,000. NYU isn’t cheap, but it’s also not as expensive as big private
universities. NYU is at the heart of America’s jazz pulse, though, and offers

students access to great live jazz several nights a week, along with under-
graduate and graduate programs in jazz.
The faculty is stocked with heavies like trombonist Robin Eubanks, trumpeter
Brian Lynch, saxophonist Chris Potter, and guitarist John Scofield. For more
information on NYU, visit www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/music.
Oberlin Conservatory of Music
Oberlin added jazz to its curriculum in 1972, but the school, based in Oberlin,
Ohio, has been associated with music since the 1953 release of Dave Brubeck’s
Jazz at Oberlin album, recorded in Finney Chapel. The music program offers
majors in jazz studies as well as composition, electronic and computer music,
music history, music theory, performance, and other areas.
The faculty includes saxophonist Gary Bartz (who’s played with Miles Davis
and Art Blakey) and drummer Billy Hart (who’s played with Herbie Hancock
and Cecil Taylor). Visit Oberlin’s Web site at www.oberlin.edu/con.

So You Wanna Be in a Band:
Fitting into a Jazz Ensemble
In This Chapter
 Fitting into an established band
 Recruiting a group of your own
 Drumming up some publicity to land gigs
 Getting into the performance zone
 Hitting the road, Jack
You went out and bought an instrument and have taken lessons for
months now. You’re reading music, and you’re good enough to play your
way through a half dozen standards. You’re ready to start making music with
other musicians. After all, jazz is group music as much as solo music.
As any musician can tell you, working in a band presents some of life’s major
challenges (and rewards). From what I know, a band is pretty much like a
family, with complementary and conflicting personalities, strengths and
weaknesses, and regular fights ranging from debates to shout fests. Getting
into a band is like getting into a relationship. If you don’t go in with blinders
on, your chances of success are much greater.
Being in a band is the most productive lesson a musician can have. It requires
a whole new level of musicianship, but it also forces players to rise to the
occasion with new levels of maturity and thoughtful communication. As life
experiences go, this is one of the most uniquely rewarding, and it’s never too
late to begin.
In this chapter, you can explore what it’s like to take those first steps toward
band-dom. You may not think you’re ready, but music teachers agree there’s
nothing like practicing with a band to speed your growth as a player.

Joining an Established Group
If you don’t see yourself as a bandleader, and you don’t want the headaches
that go with the job such as booking gigs and tracking finances, you can join
an existing band, which, for first-time band members, is a great way to learn
the ropes: how a band is run, how to schedule practices, what happens at
practice, and how to collaborate with a group of musicians with different 
personalities and musical abilities.
There are bands that specialize in most styles and periods of jazz. Decide
what kind of music you want to play and seek out like-minded players of simi-
lar ability — or who are slightly better than you are, so you can challenge
yourself. Also look for musicians who have similar goals. If you’re hardcore
and want to become skilled at a bunch of tunes, perform several nights a
week, and record a CD, then you don’t want to hook up with a group that
wants only to get together occasionally for a casual jam session.
Before you go looking for a band to join, you should probably know at least a
dozen jazz standards. Any good teacher can help you select and master these
songs (see Chapter 15 for advice on finding a great teacher).
Here are a few pointers on how to find a group that needs your talents:
 Classified ads: Independent weekly papers in most cities feature classi-
fied ads for musicians. Reading these ads can be a good way to latch on
to a small group that’s up and coming.
 College campuses: Some community colleges have big bands that are
open to players of all ages; College music programs have small groups
and ensembles that are open to students (sometimes even to non-music
students).
 Community groups: Most towns have independent ensembles that may
be run by enthusiastic individuals or community arts groups.
 Jazz societies: Many cities have societies or groups devoted to tradi-
tional jazz. These groups are great places to find out about local bands
seeking musicians.
Keep in mind that you may have to audition for a band. An audition may
require you to demonstrate basics such as scales and to join the band on a
basic jazz tune or two. If you don’t know any tunes yet, you probably aren’t
ready for a band, unless it’s specifically a beginning band. If you meet the
musical standard, consider these details before you join:
270
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: The Jazz Musician 

 Do the players argue and fail to reach mutually agreeable solutions?
 Do the players have musical harmony, or are they unable to find a
groove or agree on who solos when and for how long?
 How often does the band practice and where?
 Who chooses the music?
 What’s expected of you between practices in the way of learning new
material?
 If the players are a working band, do they actually have a system in
place for getting equipment and players to the gig on time and making
sure everything is set up right?
 How much does the band charge per gig, and how is the money distrib-
uted (often, the leader makes more than the rest of the band)?
Building a Band from the Ground Up
Forming and sustaining a band requires a whole new set of skills. Whether
you’re a teenager, a recent college graduate, or an older player getting your
mojo going again, you need to evolve from a solo cat who worries only about
the glitches, schedule, and talents of one to a manager, mentor, arranger, or
shrink who suddenly has two, three, or four other egos to consider.
Real musicians don’t form a band with the idea of fame, fortune, and record-
ing contracts. They do it for other reasons: love of music, camaraderie, a
structure for improving one’s ability, the satisfaction of trying something 
new. Just making the effort to be in a band, practice together, and master 
a few songs brings tremendous satisfaction.
In the following sections, I explain how to find members for your band and
tell you about the roles of the leader and the rest of the members. I also give
you tips on playing well together and building a repertoire of great music.
Recruiting the members
Before you start auditioning musicians, figure out how big you want your band
to be and which instruments to feature (see the following list). Many first
timers start out with a duo or trio. Because a pianist can cover bass, chords,
and melodies, he can fit with most any instrument. In any lineup, you need
someone who can cover these parts. Two horn players, for instance, can’t 
271
Chapter 16: So You Wanna Be in a Band: Fitting into a Jazz Ensemble

produce a full group sound because they specialize in melodies and not
chords and bass notes. You can build a trio around bass, drums, and just
about any other instrument: flute, guitar, saxophone, trumpet, vocal, or violin.
 Guitarists: A guitarist is capable (at least, in better hands than mine) of
covering bass lines, chords, and melodies. A guitarist can go it alone or
fit in a variety of contexts ranging from duos with pianists and vocalists,
to trios with bass and drums, to a quartet that adds a piano, and larger
ensembles up to big-band size.
 Pianists: These musicians have a versatility that’s similar to guitarists.
Going solo, they can play several parts at once but also mesh with other
instruments, playing bass lines, chords, and melodies as needed, as well
as improvising and providing support for other improvisers.
 Trumpeters, saxophonists, trombonists, clarinetists, flutists, and vocal-
ists: These instrumentalists need a band to support them and fill out the
textures around their single strands of melody.
 Drummers and bassists: These folks also need a band, and most bands
need them because they form a solid foundation. Bassists plunk out
steady rhythms and harmonize on melodies, while drummers take the
lead role in sustaining the tempo and beat. A new band can face the
challenge of staying on beat through the song, and a drummer provides
the solid anchor for that challenge.
You can search an abundance of places for musicians:
 Classified ads: Find players looking for bands here, or post an ad look-
ing for musicians.
 Music stores: Independent music stores sometimes have bulletin boards
with band-related postings. Ask a clerk for ideas on finding musicians.
 Jazz radio stations: Jazz radio stations in most towns are small and
community oriented. They usually know and promote local musicians.
Place a call and you can probably find a deejay or station manager who
can point you toward bands.
 Local musicians’ union: In some towns, union headquarters are places
where band members hang out, jam, and network. See if your town has
an active, helpful union. (See the sidebar “Should you join the union?”
later in this chapter for more about unions.)
 Friends who have friends who want to play: Every social setting, from
the workplace to a holiday party, usually includes people who play
music. Ask around until you find some musicians — if you’re not big on
parties, view them as creative opportunities that change your mind.
272
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: The Jazz Musician 

It’s easier to recruit one member at a time. If you find one person with whom
you can build rapport, the two of you can have an easier time adding a third
or fourth together.
You can tell a lot about a person by talking over the phone. For starters, 
you need to know if you like a person or can establish a basic connection.
Personalities and life experiences may be as important to your group’s chem-
istry as musical experience and ability. When talking to perspective band
members on the telephone, have the following list of questions at hand. You
can screen out a lot of people on the phone without taking the time to meet
them in person.
 Why do you want to be in a band?
 What kind of equipment do you have?
 How long have you been playing and how often do you play?
 What level do you consider yourself?
 What kind of performing experience do you have?
 What are your strengths as a player? Weaknesses?
 Where would we practice?
 Do you want to play gigs?
 Do you have any leads on gigs?
 What are a few of your favorite songs?
 Can you suggest other musicians to round out our group?
Also talk about practical matters such as time, money, and transportation.
Someone may be a great player but won’t work out if he can’t attend regular
practices due to time or distance factors. Also, you don’t want a drummer
with a tiny compact car who’s counting on you for transportation or a gui-
tarist who has a fine guitar but no amplifier. As long as you’re making music
for fun more than money, it shouldn’t be difficult to agree on finances. But if
you’re playing for profit, figure out the details ahead of time. You don’t want
to explain the payout details outside a club at 2 a.m. after a gig.
If you like your candidate(s) (and the answers you get) after asking these
questions, take the next steps to getting to know them:
1. If you’re just starting, you need to audition your first players. 
After you’ve recruited some musicians, you can invite new prospects to
meet the play with the group.
2. Count off a tune you both know and see what happens. 
273
Chapter 16: So You Wanna Be in a Band: Fitting into a Jazz Ensemble

If you and your prospect are ready to be in a band, you should be able to
find at least one song to play together. Keep it simple — play the melody
and then improvise a little. Find people who’re both empathetic collabo-
rators when you solo and who, if they know how to improvise, don’t hog
more than their share of solos.
3. Perform a gut check. 
Generally it’s good to trust your intuition. The music may be okay, but if
there’s something nagging you about your collaboration, the little voice
in your head probably won’t go away until you resolve the issue. People
who talk too much, don’t make eye contact, or seem unusually nervous
may be geniuses, or they may simply be annoying or difficult.
Try out more than one partner. After you meet two or three, you have some
grounds for comparison. If this is your first band, understanding how musical
personalities mesh takes time. Some of us like to lie back and let someone
else take the lead; others of us have strong personalities and need to sur-
round ourselves with willing followers.
When you think you have the makings of a band, and before the first formal
practice, develop a list of a half dozen or more songs you might play together.
My own first tunes on guitar were “Blue Bossa” and “Autumn Leaves.” Your
list of tunes can cover a range of moods and musical elements. You probably
want a couple of melodic ballads, an uptempo tune or two, some blues (good
for improvisation), and a couple wild cards — I love it when jazz players take
a familiar pop or rock song and jazzify it, as singer Paul Anka did with
Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” accompanied by a big band.
Understanding the role of a leader
If you’re the leader of the pack, you have certain responsibilities to your band-
mates: booking dates, keeping the calendar, calling practices, and reminding
people to come. Most likely, you’re also your own P.R. agency (see “Publicizing
Your Band and Landing Gigs” later in this chapter for details).
You don’t want to rule like General Patton, but you don’t need to be as irre-
sponsible as Bart Simpson either. Find a happy medium and a leadership
style that’s somewhere in between and combines organization and discipline
with a charm that makes you likable in spite of any flaws you may have.
A few folks are born leaders. It’s tough to imagine Miles Davis, Duke Ellington,
or Benny Goodman as anything except front men, but if you possess some
basic musicianship and maturity, you can acquire leadership skills, too.
274
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: The Jazz Musician 

So what do your bandmates need from their fearless leader? Check out this
list for starters:
 Be a great communicator. Set simple goals and communicate those
clearly. Tell musicians exactly what you expect from them.
 Lead by example. Practice diligently, be on time, know your band’s
material better than anyone else, and treat everyone respectfully.
 Take your band places they didn’t think they could go. Choose some
songs that challenge them. Give a less assertive band member a chance
to become the centerpiece of one tune. Push yourself and others in the
group to compose original material. Check out “Stocking up on standard
songs and wild cards” later in this chapter for more about selecting
music to play.
 Don’t be a dictator. More than any other musical genre, jazz is a collec-
tive effort. You need your bandmates as much as they need you, so
remember the golden rule: Treat others the way you want to be treated.
 Be forgiving. Everyone makes mistakes. The first time someone shows
up late, doesn’t practice, or muffs a performance, let them know that
you noticed, but that it’s okay as long as they try to do better in the
future.
 Be open to new ideas. Figure out how you think a song should sound,
but be open to new ideas after you begin rehearsing and if the song isn’t
working out. It doesn’t matter where a good idea comes from; it makes
everyone look good.
Considering band members’ contributions
Whether you join or lead a band, being a part of one involves the same kinds
of courtesies and responsibilities as when you start a new job or volunteer at
a local library or school. Being part of a band requires a degree of maturity,
and after a band agrees on shared goals, it’s the job of every member to work
toward the common good.
What does a band need from its members?
 Keep a regular practice schedule.
 Know the material.
 Own a good quality instrument and maintain it on a regular basis.
 Eat right, sleep right, and don’t do things that are bad for your health.
275
Chapter 16: So You Wanna Be in a Band: Fitting into a Jazz Ensemble

 Show up for every practice and perform in tip-top shape.
 Suggest but don’t argue to absurdity.
 Be a good public relations representative for the band.
 Don’t gossip.
Playing well together
Everyone brings an individual personality and approach to music. As a leader
(or member), you need to be a bit of a shrink to figure out other people and
how best to collaborate with them. In the following sections, I give you ways
to make sure that everyone in the band can shine and provide a few handy
hints on minding your manners as you play.
Ensuring that everyone can stand out
Personalities translate into musical approaches. A cocky and confident musi-
cian may feel that she deserves plenty of solo spots. An introspective player,
who may be just as good, won’t assert his desire to step into the spotlight. A
flamboyant person may overplay and get in the way, while a quieter person
may be more in tune with the song and the rest of the band.
Here are a few suggestions of how to include each member in a special way in
the band:
 Select material that suits your players. Don’t give a Dizzy Gillespie tune
with Rocky Mountain highs to a trumpeter who has trouble hitting high
notes. Don’t ask a vocalist who stumbles over lyrics to do “Twisted,” a
high-velocity song sung to perfection by fifties vocal group Lambert,
Hendricks & Ross.
 Have a least one tune where each band member can shine. Most 
musicians have favorite tunes they’ve already mastered, but if you’re 
the leader, your take on their talent helps you select material best suited
to their musical and improvisational strengths.
 Choose compositions that feature highlights for everyone. Select
uptempo driving numbers to showcase drummers, ballads for horns 
and vocalists, and songs with a strong beat for bassists.
 Go against the grain. Give your bassist the lead melody line, and let
your horns carry the rhythms. (See “Stocking up on standard songs 
and wild cards” later in this chapter for more about material.)
 Mix it up: Play sets of different-sounding songs that lend themselves to
individual solos. Mix it up with fast tempos, slow tempos, Latin tunes,
atonal tunes, Broadway hits, blues, and famous bebop numbers.
276
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: The Jazz Musician 

Also remember that improvisation is a vital element of jazz, and you need to
find the right ways to showcase your group’s improvisational talent. To many
players, the best songs for improvisation are those with simple chord changes
and straightforward, beautiful melodies. The less that’s written down on
paper, the more room for soloist creation.
Following some basic playing etiquette
Jazz musicians generally don’t like rules, but if you’re playing in a band or
going to jam sessions here are some basic guidelines that keeps you in good
with your peers.
 Keep your solos short and sweet so others get their time too. A solo
should add something to the tune and complement the group effort. A
soloist should listen closely to the other musicians, and there should be
give and take — not just take.
 Figure out the rotation for solos and stick to it. Often the bandleader
takes the last solo. Sometimes a natural order exists: Someone is good at
starting the rotation with a bold statement, and someone else is good at
bringing things back toward the song and its melody.
 Drummers and bassists get fewer solos. I don’t know about you, but 
if there’s one thing that usually irritates me, it’s an endless drum solo.
There are exceptions, but most jazz bands give most of the solo time 
to trumpets, saxophones, and other traditional lead instruments.
 Music is like good conversation, so don’t butt in on another soloist.
Well, there’s another thing that irritates me — it’s when one musician
plays too much while another is improvising. When someone solos, the
job of the other instrumentalists is to support him, not compete —
unless it’s the kind of song where a couple of players, say, a trumpeter
and saxophonist, are trading short solos in a sort of duel.
 Don’t play over a vocalist. When a singer is singing the words to a song,
be like wallpaper, stay in the background. The audience wants to hear
the lyrics and melody.
 Know the power of silence — what you don’t play is as important as
what you do play. My favorite players are those who add just the right
notes. It’s easy, especially for budding musicians, to play too much in
their desire to demonstrate their chops.
 Don’t play if you don’t know the song. Obviously, this tip applies to public
performances and jam sessions, not practices. It’s possible to fake it in
the background on some tunes, but you shouldn’t jump in on a solo if
you don’t know the chords and melody.
277
Chapter 16: So You Wanna Be in a Band: Fitting into a Jazz Ensemble

 Focus on fitting with the band, not standing out as a great genius.
Unless you’re the star, it’s much more important to be a partner with
your bandmates than to show off. No one likes a show-off — especially
one whose ego is bigger than his ability.
 Work out complementary melody parts so you aren’t all playing the
exact same line as other horns in the band. The coolest thing about 
a band’s version of a jazz standard is the original take on it, including
ways that one instrument or section can carry a melody while another
plays another line in harmony.
 Don’t diss a fellow player on stage, even if his solo stinks. Don’t curse
or say something mean, and keep a pleasant expression on your face;
the audience can tell what you’re feeling, and it’s not pleasant to watch 
a band in public conflict.
 Play in tune. Buy the right tune-up equipment and know how to use it.
Most bands tune to one instrument, such as the piano. Before you ever
join a band, you should be confident in your ability to tune up quickly
and accurately. The first time I went to a jam session, it took me ten 
agonizing minutes to tune my guitar because I was so nervous.
 Serve the music, not yourself. In addition to being considerate of your
bandmates, be respectful of the tune. You choose songs because they’re
thoughtfully composed. Comprehend the tune thoroughly, and when you
play it, imagine the composer and his times and earlier recordings as
you try to deliver a version worthy of the song and its history.
Stocking up on standard 
songs and wild cards
How many songs does your band need to have in its repertoire before it can
play a gig? I asked a musician I know and he gave me the obvious answer:
enough tunes to fill the length of the gig. If you’re going to an hour-long set,
you probably need eight to ten tunes, depending on the length of improvisa-
tions. The type of venue and audience tells you how much to solo and how
much to stick with a song’s written chords and melody.
Bands often play two sets in an evening, and if the audience remains largely
the same, you don’t want to repeat anything. So 15 to 20 tunes is an ideal
target. Working jazzmen — those who are in ongoing bands, substitute in
other bands, and participate in jam sessions — know dozens of tunes.
278
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: The Jazz Musician 

When you have basic mastery of an instrument, the first thing any jazz
teacher tells you is to start learning standards. Get your hands on a standard
song book like The Real Book (highly regarded among players as being con-
cise and accurate), and start working your way through it beginning with sim-
pler songs. Most standards have been recorded by dozens of famous jazz
players, so when you’re learning these songs, you can use your favorite ver-
sion to get ideas about phrasing, tempo, and dynamics. (Dedicated musicians
figure out how to transcribe music themselves. It’s the best way to ensure
accuracy, but most people rely on existing music books and the guidance of
more experienced players.)
After you and your band know a few tunes, the next batch comes easier. A
complete list of standards (including show tunes and jazz compositions) is
beyond our scope here, but here are several that are beautiful, often played,
and frequently requested.
 All Blues (Miles Davis)
 Autumn Leaves (Johnny Mercer)
 Blue Bossa (Kenny Dorham)
 Blue in Green (Miles Davis)
 Body and Soul (Johnny Green)
 Cherokee (Ray Noble)
 Desafinado (Antonio Carlos Jobim)
 Dolphin Dance (Herbie Hancock)
 Equinox (John Coltrane)
 Fall (Wayne Shorter)
 Footprints (Wayne Shorter)
 Freddie Freeloader (Miles Davis)
 Girl from Ipanema (Antonio Carlos Jobim)
 Goodbye Porkpie Hat (Charles Mingus)
 Green Dolphin Street (Kaper/Washington)
 Groovin’ High (Dizzy Gillespie)
 How High the Moon (Morgan Lewis)
 I Can’t Get Started (Vernon Duke)
 In a Sentimental Mood (Duke Ellington)
 I Should Care (Cahn Stordahl Weston)
279
Chapter 16: So You Wanna Be in a Band: Fitting into a Jazz Ensemble

 Isn’t It Romantic (Rodgers and Hart)
 Lush Life (Billy Strayhorn)
 Maiden Voyage (Herbie Hancock)
 Misty (Erroll Garner)
 Mood Indigo (Duke Ellington)
 My Favorite Things (Richard Rodgers)
 My Funny Valentine (Rodgers and Hart)
 Nica’s Dream (Horace Silver)
 Night and Day (Cole Porter)
 Ornithology (Charlie Parker)
 Prelude To A Kiss (Duke Ellington)
 ‘Round Midnight (Thelonious Monk)
 Satin Doll (Duke Ellington)
 Sidewinder (Lee Morgan)
 Sophisticated Lady (Duke Ellington)
 So What (Miles Davis)
 Stella by Starlight (Victor Young)
 Stolen Moments (Oliver Nelson)
 Straight No Chaser (Thelonious Monk)
 Take Five (Paul Desmond)
 They Can’t Take That Away from Me (George Gershwin)
 Well You Needn’t (Thelonious Monk)
 What Is This Thing Called Love (Cole Porter)
If you and your band can master even half these tunes, you should be able to
play just about any gig. Throw in a few songs that reflect your own personal
quirks and you’re on your way. You can take just about any pop or rock tune,
for instance, and jazz it up. Guitarist Brian Setzer has worked out a big band
arrangement of Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker, the famous holiday season ballet.
All sorts of Beatles tunes have been adapted by jazz musicians. There are
also songs that come in handy for special occasions, such as “Happy
Birthday,” “Auld Lang Syne,” and “The Wedding March” (Wagner).
A handful of jazzified pop hits may round out your set. Your repertoire could
range from Beck and Green Day to James Brown, Michael Jackson, Rick
280
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: The Jazz Musician 

James, Gwen Stefani, and Stevie Wonder. The more I think about it, the more I
can imagine what a wild time you would have with your versions of funk and
soul tunes. Get those horns swinging in unison!
Publicizing Your Band and Landing Gigs
A lot of folks want to get gigs, make CDs, and grow an ever greater following
for their music. Very few of them reach their goals. Musicians tend to focus
on their music, and it’s rare to find one who has an equivalent commitment 
to marketing himself and managing his career. If you really want to succeed 
in the music business, then you need to work as hard on marketing yourself
as you do on your music. In this high-tech age, there are more ways than 
ever to put yourself out there, as I show you in the following sections.
Harnessing the power of the Internet
Publicity isn’t difficult, but it’s time consuming. Musicians who sustain
careers have their act together communications-wise. And what faster, easier
way to communicate these days than via the World Wide Web? Here are some
ideas and examples (see Chapter 17 for more about using the Internet):
 One guitarist I know has, over the years, compiled an e-mail list of about
3,000 names. Every week he sends a personal newsletter full of humor
and anecdotes, as well as upcoming dates and news about his career. If
only 20 or 30 of these people turn up at each performance, he has a solid
core audience.
Names from your list come from several sources: sign-ups on your Web
site (the address should be listed on business cards, tickets, fliers, and
CDs), sign-ups at gigs, referrals from friends, and names (and e-mail
addresses) that you acquire in every social situation. Every situation,
including meetings at work and casual dinners with friends, presents 
an opportunity to talk about your music.
Any e-mail program is capable of keeping your mailing list, but some pro-
grams let you enter more data (such as multiple phone numbers) and
sort your list by zip code, length of time on your list, last CD purchased
from your Web site, and so on.
 Another musician I know is religious about getting her performances listed
in newspaper calendars. It’s surprisingly easy with the Internet. Almost
every paper has a Web site where you can submit event listings, and these
lists amount to some of the most effective free publicity you can get.
281
Chapter 16: So You Wanna Be in a Band: Fitting into a Jazz Ensemble

 Most every band has a Web site now, and if you’re the leader, it’s your
job to put one up or get someone to do it for you. It’s not expensive to
register a domain name like dirksdirtyband.com, and it’s also affordable
to get space on a server where you can park your site. Designing a basic
site is fairly simple. You don’t have to learn programming code; the Web
software available writes the code for you. All you have to do is design.
If you don’t have the time or interest, I guarantee there’s a 16-year-old 
in your neighborhood who can create something simple in exchange 
for a few CDs, a few bucks, or a credit and e-mail address as your Web
designer that helps him land more of his own Web designing gigs.
There are many ways to publicize your Web site:
• Ask writers to include the address at the bottom of articles about
your band.
• Put the address on bumper stickers, business cards, CDs, fliers,
and T-shirts.
• Put your band on Web sites such as www.craigslist.com and
include your Web address.
• Ask friends and fellow musicians to include links to your Web site
on their Web sites or myspace.com pages (myspace.com is a huge
online community where musicians can put their music out to a
mass audience for free).
Smiling for the camera
A good publicity shot is priceless in terms of the visibility it earns your
group. Many musicians don’t have photos at all, others have bad ones. For
general purposes you want a simple, clear black-and-white shot. A photo of
one musician with an instrument is preferable to a shot of an entire group; a
tight shot of band members together is better than a distant shot that shows
the band and a stage in front of an audience. Many publications run your
photo very small, and the more distant the shot, the smaller you and your
group look in a tiny reproduction of the photo. Don’t use one that’s too silly,
or cluttered with stuff like furniture, buildings, or cars. At the size many
photos are reproduced, a simple image looks much more dramatic.
With modern technology and more and more affordable digital cameras, 
it’s fast and easy to take reasonably good publicity shots on your own. Have
someone in your band take the picture or turn to a friend, an amateur pho-
tographer, or a photography student at the local college who can take some
pictures as a favor, for the experience, or for a nominal fee.
282
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: The Jazz Musician 

Use your imagination when taking photos for your group. Instead of having
someone shoot your photo straight on with a standard lens, try for unusual
angles with a wide angle lens. Interesting backgrounds can also hold atten-
tion. For instance, instead of shooting against a white wall or black curtain,
try a rough concrete surface, corrugated metal, or horizontal blinds.
Digital photography makes it easy to get photos out to the world along with
written information. Use photos on Web page and promotional fliers. Order a
few dozen 8" × 10" glossies (glossy prints) so you can submit them to newspa-
pers and Web sites along with written information. Get a few hundred small
(say, 3" × 5") glossy cards printed with a photo of the band and contact infor-
mation. Small printing shops print these things all the time, and they aren’t
expensive.
Playing for free
An economical way to put your music out there is to play some gigs on a 
volunteer basis. It takes only one chance encounter with the right person for
you to get noticed. Success in the arts is like a chemical reaction: After the
number of collisions reaches critical mass, something is bound to happen.
At the radio station where I hosted a program for a few years, there were two
kinds of musicians: those who felt that performing on our program was work
that they should be paid for and those who viewed exposure to thousands of
listeners as valuable free advertising. Many times, musicians who performed
on the program would tell us later that they couldn’t believe how many
people heard them and visited their Web site or bought their CD or booked
them to perform.
Producers who book these shows are extremely busy and receive stacks of
pitches in the mail every day. Send them a sample of your music and no more
than a page about your band and upcoming gigs — and an offer to perform
on short notice if they have a sudden opening.
Also, many local television stations have morning shows that feature local
musicians. Call the station and explain that you need to talk to whoever
books the guests. If you get that person on the line, tell them in less then 30
seconds the name of your band, your type of music, and that you think you’d
be good for their program. Then offer to send more information.
Although producers usually book the guests, hosts sometimes have a say, so it
doesn’t hurt to send your CD and page of information to them, too. Sometimes
you can find a radio or TV host who’s more into music than the producer.
283
Chapter 16: So You Wanna Be in a Band: Fitting into a Jazz Ensemble

If your group is small and portable, you can even do some busking — that’s 
a British term for performing spur-of-the-moment in public places such as
parks, street corners, and subway stations (you need a license to do that in
New York City now). Before San Diego’s historic Gaslamp Quarter district
went upscale, one could often find a saxophonist or guitarist performing
during the lunch hour with their instrument case open for contributions.
Put out some information cards where people can grab one, and if you have a
CD, put it on display for purchase. Also have regular business cards in case
people want something that fits into a wallet or small purse.
Some cities have laws about where you can and can’t perform in public.
Many cities encourage performances as a part of public arts programs, but 
in other locations, you may need a permit. It’s a good idea to call your city’s
planning department or the office of your city council member to find out
about these policies.
Performing at social events
People want live jazz for all sorts of events, ranging from Rotary Club barbe-
cues to Chamber of Commerce ribbon cuttings, dedications of new buildings,
company parties, weddings, and family reunions. Some of these gigs actually
pay better than club dates. I discuss these types of gigs in the following 
sections.
Word-of-mouth marketing is your best tool for obtaining gigs all around. Many
times your success is built off knowing people. If you find someone who
knows someone (and so on) and play a successful show for them, your gig
may lead to more gigs down the road.
Local events
Smaller satellite towns outside major cities often need entertainment for
events at city halls, libraries, parks, and schools. Visit your city’s Web site to
see whether there’s a spring or summer concert series. Call your city council
member’s office, school district office, school office, or branch librarian, and
ask whether they know of events that need live music. These opportunities
can hone your musical and P.R. skills. Put out a stack of business cards, and
who knows what may come of it?
Private parties
Don’t overlook so-called socials — private parties that often pay better than
regular gigs. In well-to-do neighborhoods, people pay a good band $1,000 or
more for a night of music. Polished professional groups may make $3,000 or
more. Many musicians play club dates for credibility and exposure, but they
play socials for the money.
284
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: The Jazz Musician 

Going corporate
Another variation on employment for musicians is the corporate gig. Many
American cities do blockbuster business in conventions and conferences.
Every event hosts parties and social occasions. Talk to your local convention
and visitors’ bureau to find out what events are coming to town and how vari-
ous companies hire performers. Many cities also have talent agents who spe-
cialize in providing entertainment for corporate occasions. If you seriously
want to pursue corporate dates, you may want to hire an agent (but know
that a percentage of your pay goes to the agent).
Approaching a variety of local venues
A lot of musicians complain that they just can’t land a gig, but I bet you there
are gigs to be had within a few minutes of your home. New jazz musicians
tend to think of a gig as a performance in a cool little jazz club with a name
like the Purple Onion, but there are all kinds of venues and occasions where
you might find work. Many restaurant owners hire musicians to play in their
bars. These gigs may not pay much, but they provide experience, and the fact
that some people are too busy talking to listen to you can be a blessing if
your band is still working out its kinks.
The Internet and telephones are great marketing tools, but sometimes a per-
sonal visit to a venue is even better. You can walk into a coffeehouse, night-
club, real estate office, record store, or restaurant and ask to see a manager
or whoever hires entertainers. All you want is “face time:” shake the person’s
hand, hand him a card, and tell him you’re happy to provide more informa-
tion at his convenience. You can offer to play one time for free, as a sort of
audition and trial to test audience response. Of course, this also would be a
great time to tell friends and family to show up and pack the house.
Pounding the pavement is the way to land jobs. A couple of enterprising 11th
graders I know have a weekly gig at a pizza joint in a hip part of town, and a
second gig performing in a small coffeehouse next to a multiplex cinema.
These are talented musicians who are still learning their craft. They have a
repertoire of a dozen or more tunes. They usually work as a trio of drums-
piano-bass, but sometimes splinter off a duo.
Producing a CD
When your group has mastered several tunes (and maybe even composed
some originals) and honed its sound at several gigs and practice sessions,
you may consider producing a CD of your music. Give some careful consider-
ation before you proceed. Many indie jazz CDs are mediocre, and it’s not nec-
essarily the musicians. If your repertoire consists primarily of standards, it’s
285
Chapter 16: So You Wanna Be in a Band: Fitting into a Jazz Ensemble

almost impossible to contribute a significant new version of a song such as
“‘Round Midnight” or “Embraceable You.” Even if you feel that your group’s
music is solid, getting a good recording of jazz is harder than it seems. Most
rock music, for instance, doesn’t rely on technical perfection. Distortion is a
desirable trait for electric guitar. But when it comes to acoustic jazz played
by piano, bass, drums, and horns, recording and mixing is a delicate matter.
So what are some of the benefits of producing a CD? You might consider cut-
ting your own CD for reasons other than a professional release. For instance,
a CD can
 Serve as a calling card to land gigs and radio performances: At radio
station KPBS-FM in San Diego, where I hosted a public radio program for
years, we received dozens of CDs each month, from established musi-
cians and from aspiring upstarts. It was rare when the performance and
technical quality were good enough to earn airplay, but sometimes the
CD landed the group an appearance on the program.
 Become a part of special promotions: Offer some CDs to your local 
college or public radio station to give away on the air or use as items 
for fundraising auctions. Or offer them on your Web site to the first ten
people who submit the correct answer to your jazz trivia question.
 Function as a sounding board: A CD gives you and your bandmates a
record of what you really sound like at a given time. It’s amazing what
you hear after you get a bit of distance from the recording and listen to
your CD again. It might sound better than you thought, or it might sound
horrific. Often the adrenalin rush of the recording session taints one’s
critical judgment.
 Make a good gift: A CD also makes a great gift for family and friends.
Depending on how serious you are about recording, you might want to retain
a producer/technical director. An experienced producer and engineer can
assist with the following tasks:
 Helping polish original tunes and select existing songs
 Giving advice on arrangements, suggesting parts to each player
 Knowing when a band has given its best performance, and when it needs
to do another take
 Identifying which microphones to use for various instruments and where
to place them
 Mixing the final result into a seamless blend.
 Dishing out advice on the order of tunes on a CD
You might find an engineer or producer at your local college music depart-
ment (maybe a student or staff person), at your local radio station, through a
286
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: The Jazz Musician 

fellow musician, or by asking a club manager. If you can afford to record in a
professional studio, it can provide an engineer.
Sometimes the same person can serve as engineer and produce. In other
cases, one person or more can help you choose songs and critique your per-
formances (this can be a friend or fellow musician), while a technical person
handles the actual recording.
For more details about technology as it relates to jazz, check out Chapter 17.
Preparing Yourself and 
Your Band to Perform
Giving your best onstage is a challenge similar to what Olympic athletes face
when, after months of training, they have to turn in their best performance in
competition. Many players have solid basic chops, but the special ones rise
to the concert occasion.
So what can you do to make sure that your best show comes out in front of
an audience? You need to practice, practice, practice. It’s not enough to just
make it through a tune. You should be able to play your part in your sleep.
Beginners sometimes have a hard time getting up in front of people and deliv-
ering a stellar performance on demand. In a few of my experiences, there
were times that I choked horribly. Despite all the cool things I played alone in
my living room, the fear factor temporarily wiped my brain blank and ren-
dered my hands useless.
If you’re like me and suffer from performance anxiety, try these practical
ideas to overcome your fears:
 Practice relaxation exercises such as deep breathing and meditation.
It’s amazing how much difference it makes if you just close your eyes
and force yourself to take 15 or 20 slow deep breaths, all the way in 
and out — the kind that feel like they fill you up with air right down 
into your belly.
 Always open your set with the same song — one that you know and
play well. That way, you know you’re off to a strong start, smoothing the
way to good performances to follow.
 Write out your set list beforehand and go over it with your band. That
way everyone knows what’s expected.
 Scout the venue before you play it. Whether it’s a nightclub, an audito-
rium, or someone’s living room, you can relieve a lot of performance-
night stress if you know how a room is configured and what your band
needs to do to set up and sound right.
287
Chapter 16: So You Wanna Be in a Band: Fitting into a Jazz Ensemble

Aside from the little things to do to psyche yourself up for the show, make
sure that you take care of the show details ahead of time so you won’t be
stressing out while you’re trying to play:
 Plan transportation, equipment loading and unloading, and parking
ahead of time. You need more time if you have a lot of equipment, a long
road trip, or a horrific trek from the parking lot to the stage. Drummers
and guitarists need extra time to set up equipment and check their sound.
 Bring extra items for emergencies. Include reeds, sets of strings, exten-
sion cords, headphones, patch cords, and so on.
 Find out in advance when and how you’re paid. A check before the
gig? Cash after the gig? Also ask who’s in charge of paying you. You don’t
want to be looking for a check at midnight in a roomful of people who’ve
had a few drinks.
 Ask a friend to record the show or take photos. If you want a recording
or photos, assign that to someone well in advance, and put them in
charge of the logistics. Sometimes you have to obtain press passes for
these types of activities.
 Arrange for someone to sell your CDs for you. If you plan to sell CDs at
your gig, check in advance to be sure it’s all right, too.
 Assemble the guest list. There always seems to be family and friends who
want to be on a guest list. If you need a list, put one person in charge
and make sure that you let your employer (venue manager) know about
it in advance.
The goal, according to most musicians I know, is to lose yourself in the music.
You don’t want to feel like you’re outside your body watching yourself have
an off night. Plan ahead and relax your body and soul. You want to be right
there inside the music, so absorbed that the audience and the things going
on around you are secondary.
Taking (and Polishing) 
Your Show on the Road
You may not be Dave Brubeck, but the time may come when you take to the
road for a short tour or something more ambitious. Successful touring with a
band is basically successful traveling but with instruments and appointments
to make. Many local and regional groups hit the road once or twice a year. 
288
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: The Jazz Musician 

It’s not about making money; it’s about the experience of seeing new places,
meeting new people, and testing your talent in new settings.
Touring is one of the best ways for a band to find its own sound. Hanging out
together and performing together every day promotes a bonding experience
through a meeting of minds (some of which are intuitive and nonverbal).
Even if you don’t all get along perfectly, playing together each night forces
you to find the band’s best groove. Almost every musician I meet who’s
recorded and toured tells me that the whole process is backwards. Instead of
recording a CD and then hitting the road to support it, they’d rather write the
material, take it on the road, and then record it, after they’ve finagled the
subtle band chemistry that makes a song unique.
A lot of people give you theories about finding a unique sound, but playing,
not talking, is the best way to do it. After all, your band consists of several
musicians who all have unique personalities, interests, and musical styles.
Naturally, whatever you play together won’t sound like anyone else.
If your band is new to the notion of road trips, keep it simple the first time out:
 Book a couple of gigs each in nearby cities and take a three-day-weekend
tour.
 Book dates in advance.
 Agree on financial terms.
 Arrange times for loading in equipment, doing a sound check, and start-
ing the performance.
 Make travel arrangements for the group.
• You can stay in a hotel or motel or bunk with people you know.
• Travel by car, van, or private plane.
 Take a digital camera to capture cool and fun moments.
 Take care of yourself.
• Eat less and eat well.
• Drink a lot of water.
• Get a good night’s sleep (if you stay in a motel, try to book one
that’s not right next to the freeway).
• Get to the gig ahead of time so you won’t be rushed.

Should you join the union?
Jazz musicians are typically freelancers with-
out an office and the social and professional
support that goes with it. The union (and local
union hall) provides a rallying point for players.
The musicians’ union serves as a focal point for
musicians’ interests. It can be reassuring for a
freelancer to know that he isn’t alone against
the world.
Local chapters of the American Federation of
Musicians (AFM) are powerful in big cities like
New York City and Chicago, but clubs in other
towns are low-paying and non-union. The union
has rules about pay and working conditions.
Local chapters have different membership
dues. You pay an annual fee plus a percentage
of your pay for each gig.
The union also provides a strong Washington
lobby that watches out for the interests of musi-
cians in areas such as copyrights, royalties,
and other issues related to the Internet, radio,
recording companies, and television; Medicare
and other issues that affect the personal wel-
fare of musicians are also supported.
Contrary to popular belief, the union isn’t in the
business of getting gigs for you, although it pro-
vides networking opportunities that help in this
regard. The union is best for musicians who
work for symphony orchestras, Broadway
shows, and theme parks — places that have
money and hire numerous musicians. So if your
music career includes all sorts of recording and
performance contexts, the union is useful. If
you’re a jazz player aiming only for gigs in small
clubs — well, most of them won’t use union-
approved contracts.

fits visit www.afm.org.

in High-Tech Times
In This Chapter
 Reviewing the impact of a few innovative engineers
 Thinking about a home studio
 Marketing your music with the help of the Web
I
n the past 20 years, affordable equipment and the growth of the Internet
have changed the way musicians steer their careers. It’s no longer “major
label or bust.” In fact, jazz being a specialized art form, few players land big
recording contracts or audiences. Instead, jazz musicians travel independent
routes and become producers, promoters, engineers, and artists all rolled into
one. The new self-determinism is a bonus for both musicians and listeners
who surf the net for affordable music that can be downloaded to a computer.
In this chapter, I describe how to become best friends with technology as you
take control of your music from home studios to Internet marketing and distri-
bution. First, though, a trip back to the days of tube tone, vinyl records, and
radio, a time when Les Paul and Rudy Van Gelder were the mad professors of
home studiology and invented recording techniques still used in jazz today.
The First Recording Masterminds
Jazz has been recorded in significant quantities since the 1920s, but having a
recording studio at home wasn’t feasible until equipment was produced in
larger quantities and at lower prices in the years after World War II. For the
first time, musicians such as Les Paul and engineers like Rudy Van Gelder
could use their own equipment and knowledge of music to customize the
sound of their recordings. This marked the beginning of a new way of making
records (and eventually CDs).

In the beginning, a few large record companies had the only professional stu-
dios, but by the 1950s, all sorts of individuals could set up a recording space
and experiment with new ways of capturing music. Today, there are old
schoolers who like to record the old-fashioned way and techies who produce
amazing recordings using laptop computers as their “studios.” For budding
jazz musicians and fans, it’s useful to know how recording has evolved, and I
give you some highlights in the following sections. Some of the best jazz was
recorded with equipment that was primitive by today’s standards — yet those
recordings sound surprisingly good.
Les Paul: A recording wizard
Known as the Wizard of Waukesha (Wisconsin), Les Paul was born in 1915
and built his first recording machine in 1929 at the age of 14. Through his
experiments with equipment and recording techniques, he pioneered many
elements that became standard in recording all types of music, including jazz:
 Sound-on-sound: Layering one musical part over another, originally on
one strip of tape. This method allowed Paul to create the sound of sev-
eral guitars by himself. Originally, Paul accomplished this by using two
tape machines: one to play back what was already recorded, the other to
record that music plus a new part he would add. By going back and forth
between machines, he could continue to add parts.
 Overdubbing: Mixing newly recorded material with previously recorded
material. Sometimes a musician overdubs a new part in place of an origi-
nal part that doesn’t work or contains a mistake.
 Reverb effects: Imitating the echo (or sense of depth) that rooms add
on music.
 Multi-tracking: Recording several different musical instruments or parts,
each as a separate part that can be customized and combined with other
parts. Multi-track recorders have expanded from two to four to thirty-
two and more tracks, meaning that each instrument or section in a big
band recording can be individually adjusted. With each instrument or
section on a different track, the volume and sound of each can be
adjusted to suit the whole.
Paul first tried sound-on-sound in 1934 on a platter machine (a predecessor
to the tape recorder that translated sound waves into grooves on a platter,
which later become known as a record). In the ’40s, Paul saw a German tape
recorder, and with some help from singer Bing Crosby, who wanted to record
his own music, convinced Ampex (an electronics company) to manufacture
50 recorders. Paul’s own personal machine had an extra recording head that
allowed him to experiment with recording multiple parts.
292
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: The Jazz Musician 

In his home garage studio in 1947, Paul made what many consider to be the
first multi-track recording, his “Lover,” featuring eight guitar parts all played
by Paul and layered over each other. Not only was Paul a technical genius,
but also he was (and is) a phenomenal guitarist, and his recording captured
the sound of his fast, melodic guitar lines skittered over each other in very
graceful ways. With one musician accompanying himself, it sounds as if sev-
eral players with amazing intuition are working together. As a result of this
recording, Paul signed with Capitol Records and teamed with his wife, vocal-
ist Mary Ford, on hits such as “How High the Moon” and “Brazil” (with six
guitar parts played by Paul).
In the ’50s, Paul designed the first eight-track tape recorder (for Ampex), and 
in consecutive years he spent time perfecting multi-track techniques. Not only
could Paul create layers of sound, but also he realized that multi-tracking freed
musicians to add parts at different times in different places. The parts could 
be recorded separately and mixed together later. Today, there are purists who
believe that jazz should be recorded live, with no overdubs. Even so, multi-
tracking is useful because bass, drums, piano, saxophone, and trumpet, for
example, can each be recorded on a separate track in balanced together in 
the final mix. Multi-tracking was even more important beginning in the late
1960s, when jazz musicians led by Miles Davis began to utilize electric instru-
ments and synthesizers. Instruments were added and subtracted, and had 
their sounds altered in the multi-track mixing process.
Rudy Van Gelder: Setting standards
Another scientist of sound is Rudy Van Gelder, who set the standard for 
jazz recording in the ’50s and ’60s with sessions for Blue Note Records in his
Inglewood, New Jersey, garage. Like Les Paul, Van Gelder began tinkering with
sound in his teens by taking apart radio equipment and building custom elec-
tronics from salvaged parts. He recorded neighborhood musicians in his par-
ents’ garage, and these demos were so remarkable that record labels came
calling for his services as an engineer. In the following sections, I give you 
the scoop on Van Gelder’s professional recording career.
Starting out as a professional engineer
Van Gelder was on a quest for perfect sound — in the case of jazz, he wanted a
natural, transparent recording that captured the music as if you were hearing it
live. Dozens of jazz albums recorded by Van Gelder are admired for capturing
the true nuances of each instrument and making each instrument stand out.
Van Gelder has been protective of his techniques, so the specifics of how he
achieved his sound remain secret. 
293
Chapter 17: Digital Jazz: Making Music in High-Tech Times

Van Gelder’s home studio became a laboratory where he experimented with
equipment and even built his own mixer when he couldn’t buy one to suit his
needs. At the time, only large record companies had state-of-the-art recording
equipment. Van Gelder pioneered an independent studio as an alternative to
major label recording studios.
His first audio mixing board came from a radio station because professional
quality boards weren’t yet widely available to individuals. Among Van Gelder’s
aesthetic decisions was the use of a 7-foot Steinway grand piano for pianists
such as Horace Silver, instead of a 9-foot concert model — the smaller instru-
ment produced a more balanced sound for recordings.
Van Gelder’s efforts paid off. The intimate environment of his home studio
helped musicians give warm, spontaneous performances like what they could
achieve in the laid-back atmosphere of a small club. His reputation spread.
Making legendary music with Blue Note Records
Van Gelder was working as an optometrist when Blue Note Records founder
Alfred Lion hired him in 1953 to engineer his first recording for the label at
his Hackensack, New Jersey, home studio. Van Gelder quit his day job in 1959
and moved to Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, where he still engineers albums
that are among the best in jazz.
Through the ’50s, the duo perfected Blue Note’s signature sound on dozens of
albums by legends like Cannonball Adderley, Art Blakey, Clifford Brown, and
Herbie Hancock. Van Gelder also engineered Miles Davis’s Birth of the Cool
and numerous essential recordings of avant garde jazz saxophonist John
Coltrane. (See Chapters 7 and 8 for details about all these musicians.)
Blue Note’s artists included many of the innovators in the ’50s jazz style
known as hard bop — bluesy, driving acoustic jazz featuring plenty of impro-
visation (see Chapter 7 for details on hard bop). Given the music’s sponta-
neous nature, Van Gelder refined his studio techniques (such as microphone
selection and placement) to capture the range of volumes, tempos, and tones
that arise when players venture off the charts.
Hardcore jazz fans knew that they could count on Blue Note for quality every
time — an amazing achievement when you consider that the recordings were
made at Van Gelder’s home. Songs were carefully selected and rehearsed, and
over time, Blue Note’s stellar reputation as the Mercedes Benz of jazz labels
was the result of Lion’s laser instinct for talent and material, and Van Gelder’s
consistently superb recordings.
294

Listening to Van Gelder today
Keeping pace with technology, Van Gelder continually upgrades his studio
with the latest digital equipment and software. Unlike analog recordings
made on tape, digital recordings can be duplicated without sacrificing sound
quality. But Van Gelder’s recordings make it obvious that it was the man as
much as the equipment that made the recordings great — technology is only
a tool, and that’s a lesson for every home studio maven. You need good ears
to get the most from those sessions.
As you expand your jazz collection, check out dozens of special Rudy Van
Gelder (RVG) reissues of his original Blue Note recordings. (I give you tips 
on building a jazz collection in Chapter 21.) Originally recorded for vinyl, the
songs have been remastered and remixed for CDs by Van Gelder, and these
albums often include additional bonus tracks that weren’t on the original
releases. See whether you can hear the distinctive nuances of the Van Gelder
touch (carefully balanced sound levels, clearly distinguished instruments,
and overall clarity) in the CDs from the following artists:
 Art Blakey, Buhaina’s Delight
 Tina Brooks, True Blue
 Clifford Brown, Clifford Brown Memorial Album
 John Coltrane, Blue Train
 J.J. Johnson, The Eminent, Vols. 1 and 2
 Hank Mobley, No Room for Squares
 Lee Morgan, The Sidewinder
 Leo Parker, Let Me Tell You ’Bout It
 Horace Silver, Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers
 Jimmy Smith, The Sounds of Jimmy Smith
Tapping into Today’s Technology 
to Create and Sell Jazz
In the early days of recording, making an album required a lot of planning, a
budget, and a means of distribution. An aspiring jazz player would be lucky
to get a recording opportunity that required getting a recording company’s
attention through a live performance heard by the right person or through
word of mouth. In the 1930s and 1940s, an affordable home studio didn’t
exist, let alone one that could make high-quality recordings that could be
easily duplicated and distributed.

Sound waves: Peaks in the history of recording
Jazz was first recorded in 1917 by the Original
Dixieland Jazz Band (see Chapter 5), but
recording technology had already evolved for
40 years. One disappointing fact is that other
types of music were recorded many years
before jazz; we mourn the loss of music made
by cornet player Buddy Bolden and other early
heroes. Nonetheless, the advent of sound
recording marked a genuine modern marvel.
Here are a few highlights:
 1877: Thomas Edison records sound to a
cylinder and demonstrates his phonograph
for the editors of Scientific American.
Edison’s first recording: “Mary Had a Little
Lamb.”
 1878: Edison patents his cylinder phono-
graph.
 1888: Emile Berliner patents the flat-disc
phonograph.
 1898: Valdemar Poulson patents the wire
recorder.
 1901: Thomas Edison’s music cylinders are
now mass-produced, but only 120 or so
can be made from one original master.
 1906: The Victor cabinet “Victrola” phono-
graph is released.
 1908: John Lomax records a black saloon-
keeper singing “Home on the Range.” His
son Alan later makes important archival
recordings of Jelly Roll Morton and count-
less blues musicians. John and Alan Lomax
were among the first to make important
recordings in the field using newly invented
portable equipment.
 1913: Thomas Edison’s cylinders become
obsolete when Edison begins manufactur-
ing the Edison Disc Phonograph.
 1917: The Original Dixieland Jazz Band
makes the first jazz recording.
 1923: Bessie Smith’s record “Down-Hearted
Blues” sells 750,000.
 1926: Bing Crosby makes recordings using
new Bell Labs microphones that enhance
the warm “crooner” sound.
 1927: Automatic Music Instrument intro-
duces the first jukebox.
 1928: German Georg Neumann launches a
microphone company that continues to
create some of the best mics for recording
music.
 1931: Pfleumer and AEG build the first mag-
netic tape recorders.
 1948: Columbia introduces the 331⁄3 rpm
record with 23 minutes of music per side.
 1949: Magnecord produces one of the first
stereo tape recorders.
 1958: The first stereo albums are released.
 1958: Koss introduces stereo headphones,
creating a whole new personal experience
of music.
 1962: Henry Kloss markets the first portable
stereo.
 1963: Philips unveils the compact audio
cassette.
 1979: Sony introduces the Walkman per-
sonal cassette player.
 1982: The first CDs are released.
 1981: IBM’s first PC is released, creating
the potential to record and mix music on
computers.

Powerful personal computers, sophisticated sound software, and the rise 
of the Internet have all changed the recording industry completely. Today,
with a modest investment in equipment, a jazz musician can begin recording
music with extremely high quality. That music can be cheaply copied onto
CDs, which cost only pennies apiece, or quickly posted on a Web site.
While use of all the new technologies isn’t yet universal among jazz players,
nearly all musicians employ some technology. The following sections feature
some simple advice from professional musicians about how to put technol-
ogy to work for you and your music.
For more detailed information on setting up a home studio, check out Home
Recording for Musicians For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Jeff Strong (Wiley). Other
books on specific types of recording software can be found through the For
Dummies line. For an introduction to creating Web sites and Internet market-
ing, check out Building a Web Site For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by David A.
Crowder (Wiley) and Internet Marketing For Dummies by Frank Catalano 
and Bud E. Smith (Wiley).
I cover a lot of sound ground here. You may be an ambitious sort who tries
some of these things (and more), or you may not be ready to record and
market music. No matter your experience or ambitions, remember that you’re
making music most of all for yourself, for the satisfaction of exploring your
creative side and expressing emotions in a medium that can be more effective
and satisfying than words. Finding an audience is a reward but not a promise.

 1984: Apple’s first Macintosh is released,
which eventually led to the advent of
Apple’s iTunes software and popular online
music store — an alternative way for artists
to distribute music.
 1988: CD sales exceed record sales.
 1989: Digidesign’s Sound Tools software is
released as the “first tapeless recording
studio.”
 1991: Sound Tools is renamed Pro Tools
(today available for both PC and Mac).
 1993: Digidesign releases Session 8 Lim-
ited, the first Windows-based recording
software.
 2001: Apple’s first iPod is released.

The nuts and bolts of home studios
Most every serious musician today, even amateurs, is equipped to do at least
some recording at home. Almost everyone owns a computer or has access to
one. With software and some basic electronic equipment, it’s fairly affordable
to record, edit, and mix music. Some computer setups are good enough to
produce pro-quality CDs, and others are sufficient to use for rehearsing,
making demos, and creating basic CDs of your music.
Typically, the younger the musician, the more he or she uses technology.
Today’s 20-year-olds have been using computers since they were in kinder-
garten. To young people, mouse-clicking through software menus is as easy
and natural as brushing their teeth.
The hard part of setting up a home studio, though, is gathering (and paying
for) all the special software and hardware that you need to start recording
seriously. A jazz guitarist I know says it takes $6,000 to $15,000 to equip a pro-
grade home studio.
Despite potentially paying thousands of dollars for home equipment, you may
reap savings by not having to purchase time in a professional studio, especially
if you plan to spend a fair amount of time on recording and polishing your
music. What’s another benefit of having your own studio? You can write and
transcribe music, in addition to recording and editing it, on a home computer.
Keep in mind that a recording or CD sounds only as good as your playback
system. Consumer stuff from a local warehouse store won’t do justice to the
music. Even musicians with modest home studios invest in a good pair of
studio monitor speakers, available from professional sound stores (many 
of which sell equipment online). These speakers are design to be clean and
accurate in order to help you get the best sound mix possible.
After you complete a CD of music at home, making copies doesn’t take 
much work. If you want more than a few copies, give your recording to a 
CD production company (you can find dozens of them online). They charge
about $1,500 for 1,000 CDs, including duplicating, packaging, and a simple
graphic design (if you don’t do one yourself). Of course, you can also sell
your songs from your own Web site or on many music Web sites that feature
independent musicians (see the next section).
Before you run out and start buying recording equipment, be sure that a
home studio truly fits your needs and the level of your expertise. You may
decide that you would rather pay a professional studio to do the job. In Los
Angeles, a jazz trumpeter I know says he can buy studio time for $50 to $100
per hour. It’s possible to record several songs in a day, so the convenience of
not worrying about equipment and engineering may be worth it to you.
298
Part IV: I Like the Way You Play: The Jazz Musician 

If you decide to take the plunge and set up a home recording studio, be sure
to give careful thought to its location. The more privacy a room has the more
ideal it is as a home studio. 
The rise of the Internet in selling music
Today, the music industry is so competitive, and profit margins are so
narrow, that recording companies often expect new artists to come to them
with professionally recorded CDs, ready for release. In some cases, musicians
even pay the recording companies to release their CDs just to get distribu-
tion. Other musicians, though, don’t think a musician should pay a company
to release his music. Marketing and distribution are often minimal, and most
new CDs get lost in the marketplace of music stores and online outlets.
In fact, the old model of distributing music via CDs in record stores is falling
away. Very few independent stores remain that are willing to stock and promi-
nently display CDs by unknown or local artists. Big chain stores are mostly
interested in music by popular artists guaranteed to sell. Even if a store stocks
your CD, a jazz fan who hasn’t heard of you stands very little chance of find-
ing and buying your CD among thousands of titles on shelves.
It’s very likely that someday soon, such a thing as a music store won’t exist,
and everyone may get their music online; in that case, an artist with a good
Web site and a good head for marketing has an even better position to bypass
the traditional methods. In the following sections, I discuss creating a Web site
and using other independent Web sites to market and sell your music.
Building your own Web site
Jazz musicians can reach out to music fans and keep the profits from their
work by building their own Web sites, where they market and sell CDs inex-
pensively. You can save even more money by figuring out how to build your
own site instead of hiring someone else to do it. 
Web sites are good places for visitors to hear your music. Most musicians
post short clips (say, 30 seconds) from the songs. If fans want to hear more,
they can order a CD.
Web sites aren’t just for selling CDs, either; you can advertise other products,
such as books, T-shirts, posters, and so on, and advertise upcoming events
just as easily.

Chapter 17: Digital Jazz: Making Music in High-Tech Times

Spread the word about the availability of CDs on your Web site with smart
publicity (see Chapter 16 for details on publicizing your band). Talk up your
site at gigs, for example. Sprague has built his loyal core following by devel-
oping a computerized mailing list over the course of 2,000 or so names. Fans
can sign up via the Web site or at his gigs, and he adds media types whenever
he meets them. He e-mails a weekly newsletter about his music and gigs,
interspersed with personal stories and musings. It’s a refreshing change 
from the Internet popups that rain down every day.
Spreading the word about your music on other Web sites
An offshoot of having your own entire Web site (see the previous section) 
is building a single Web page on a larger, independent site designed to help
market and sell music. For instance, you can market your music with a Web
page on cdbaby.com, which is an online record store selling music by inde-
pendent artists. Other sites where you can sell your music include ind-music.
com, cdarmy.com, and indietunes.com.

Chapter 18
Ten Great Cities for Jazz
In This Chapter
 Hearing great live jazz in city clubs
 Discovering other cultural venues and jazz resources
T
o truly experience jazz, you have to hear it live. While dozens of American
cities offer a lot of live jazz, the ten cities in this chapter stand above the
rest for their excellent mixes of local, national, and international talent; the
quality of their venues; and a larger context that’s rich in arts and aesthetic
attractions. So take a plane, train, or automobile and get out of here!
Austin
Known as the “Live Music Capital of the World,” Austin has one of the highest
per capita club ratios of any American city — more than Los Angeles, Las
Vegas, Memphis, Nashville, or New York City — according to the city’s Web
site (www.ci.austin.tx.us). This music madness infuses the jazz scene.
When you arrive in Austin, one of your first priorities is to dial in some 
music courtesy of several radio stations that feature jazz, including Paul
Trachtenberg’s weekday afternoon “Jazz, Etc.” on KUT-FM (90.5), a long-
running local favorite (www.kut.org). Small local radio stations are into
music for love, not money, and they tend to be great sources of information
about bands and clubs. They announce upcoming performances, they inter-
view performers, they give away tickets, and you may even get a deejay on
the phone to make a personal recommendation for a venue or concert.
Some fun jazz venues that you may want to check out include the following:
 Austin Java Café & Bar (www.austinjava.com)
 Manuel’s (www.austincityguide.com/content/manuel’s-
austin-restaurant-downtown.asp)

 Threadgill’s (www.threadgills.com)
 Jazz Kitchen Austin (www.austincityguide.com/content/
jazz-austin-bar.asp)
 Reed’s Jazz and Supper Club (www.sgrg.com/reeds)
 The Elephant Room (www.natespace.com/elephant)
Top jazz players from around the world often perform in Austin when they’re
on the road, usually at a couple of the city’s larger venues. One World Theatre
promotes jazz education and presents concerts at its headquarters in west
Austin — a romantic compound that resembles an Italian villa. Featured artists
have included Herbie Hancock, Pat Metheny, and McCoy Tyner. The Paramount
Theatre, once a great movie house, is an architectural grande dame where jazz
is perfectly suited to the 1930s-era Art Deco design.
For those of you who like your jazz New Orleans style, the Austin Traditional
Jazz Society (www.atjs.org) presents live music. And if you like it modern
or far-out, the University of Texas at Austin’s music department is home to
small and large jazz groups as well as the Alternative Improvisation Music
Ensemble (AIME). Visit the University of Texas at Austin on the Web at www.
music.utexas.edu.
Chicago
Trace the history of jazz and it makes an essential stop in Chicago during the
’20s and ’30s when Louis Armstrong and Bix Beiderbecke were two kings of
cornet here and when the white Austin High School jazz gang mingled with
the black South Side crew to swap licks. (See Chapter 5 for more about early
jazz in Chicago.) Today, Chicago is still a fine place for jazz. Rising jazz vocal-
ist Kurt Elling lives there, and the city has a solid stock of local players.
The Jazz Institute of Chicago (www.jazzinstituteofchicago.org) is an
essential hub that offers education through youth jam sessions and artists in
residency at local schools, archives of local jazz history, and live music includ-
ing a tour of jazz clubs and the annual Winter Delights Jazz Fair. Another worthy
annual gathering is the Elmhurst College Jazz Festival, with top college bands
and established stars. Visit www.ecjazzfest.org for more info.
The Chicago Jazz Orchestra (www.chicagojazzorchestra.com) offers an
annual subscription series that might include a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald or
another great. And look out for local trumpet legend Orbert Davis and his 55-
piece Chicago Jazz Philharmonic (www.chicagojazzphilharmonic.org),
which merges classical music with jazz.

Cool venues to check out include
 The Cotton Club: Decorated in the spirit of Cab Calloway, the club 
features jazz at least one night per week. Surf the site at www.
cottonclubchicago.com.
 Green Dolphin Street: Big-name players like Christian McBride are often
featured at this restaurant/bar. Visit the venue’s site on the Web at www.
jazzitup.com.
 MoJoe’s Hot House: Jazz plays a big part in the performing arts sched-
ule at this coffeehouse. Check the place out online: www.rockabilly.
net/honeybees/MojoesFront.html.
 The Jazz Showcase: Dizzy Gillespie and other greats have sustained this
venue’s reputation since the late 1940s. Go online and check it out at
www.jazzshowcase.com.
And if you’re looking to pick up a few records when you’re in town, Chicago’s
Jazz Record Mart, which claims the title “world’s largest jazz record store,” is
notable not only for the sheer size of its inventory, but also for a knowledge-
able staff that always includes actual jazz musicians. The store also has a
huge Web store at www.jazzmart.com.
Kansas City
Prohibition didn’t come to Kansas City, Missouri, in the 1930s. When Boss
Tom ran the town, liquor flowed and jazz prospered. Many clubs stayed open
all night long, which might explain the popularity of the cutting contest — a
duel to the death between two or more jazz giants. Clubs like the Panama, the
Reno, and the Sunset, and ballrooms such as Pla-Mor and El Torreon, were
their arenas. Musicians who lived in or passed through Kansas City on their
way to greatness included Count Basie, Andy Kirk’s Twelve Clouds of Joy, the
Jay McShann Orchestra, and Walter Page’s Blue Devils. And during their late-
night jams, budding young players like Charlie Parker got their first chances
to play with the big boys.
Those places are gone or no longer feature jazz, but the music lives on in
Kansas City today. The Kansas City Jazz Ambassadors online is a good
resource for information about clubs and concerts (www.jazzkc.org), and
the organization hosts an annual Jazz Lovers Pub Crawl, with proceeds sup-
porting jazz education and concerts.

Kansas City also is home to the American Jazz Museum (www.american
jazzmuseum.com), which calls itself “the premier jazz museum in the United
States.” The building is full of jazz photos, album covers, and memorabilia;
presents live jazz at its Blue Room nightclub and 500-seat Gem Theater; and
showcases art related to jazz, baseball, and African-American life in The
Changing Gallery. The John H. Baker Collection consists of more than 5,000
jazz films.
If you want to flash back to how jazz first reached a mass market, the
University of Missouri Kansas City has 250,000 rare recordings in its Marr
Sound Collection, including jazz LPs, 78s, 45s, and even old cylinders.
Highlights include “Nat King Cole The Early Years (1936–1942),” when he 
was more of a jazz musician than a pop star, and “The Wilbur ‘Buck’ Clayton
Collection” of photos documenting the career of the jazz trumpeter. You can’t
check out items, but you can do research on site. Check out the Web site at
www.umkc.edu.
Visit in fall and you can take in the Kansas City Blues and Jazz Festival. The
two genres are siblings, especially in a town where early jazz was built on
blues. Research the festival at kansascitymusic.com/festival. And
check out Chapter 14 for more about jazz festivals.

Part V: The Part of Tens

Los Angeles
Considering its wealth of talent, Los Angeles doesn’t have the kind of vital
jazz scene that thrived along Central Avenue, where Buddy Collette, Howard
McGhee, and many others set the pace in the ’40s and ’50s. Still, jazz clubs
today feature great music and larger venues like the Walt Disney Concert Hall
(wdch.laphil.com/home.cfm).
Disney’s venue is one of the world’s architectural wonders, and jazz plays 
a small but essential role in its programming. Wynton Marsalis, the Maria
Schneider Jazz Orchestra, and Wayne Shorter have all performed there, and
the Los Angeles Philharmonic hosted a Django Reinhardt Festival. Because
the Disney hall was designed primarily for acoustic performances (it’s the
home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic), it’s a great place to hear live jazz.
In warmer months, the Greek Theatre (www.greektheatrela.com) and the
Hollywood Bowl (www.hollywoodbowl.com) are spectacular places to hear
jazz under the stars (the Hollywood Bowl is home to the Playboy Jazz
Festival, which I cover in Chapter 14).
Other great venues for hearing live jazz include
 Catalina Jazz Club: The Los Angeles Jazz Society hosts a jazz brunch 
at this leading club, where evenings feature talent like guitarist Kenny
Burrell, vocalist Tierney Sutton, and Coltrane’s onetime bassist Dr. Art
Davis. Check out the Jazz Society at www.lajazzsociety.org and the
Catalina Jazz Club at www.catalinajazzclub.com.
 The Jazz Bakery: This venue is the only seven-night-a-week nonprofit
jazz venue. This place features touring stars like pianist Billy Childs, gui-
tarist Bill Frisell, and saxophonist Benny Golson. Visit the Web site at
www.jazzbakery.com.
 The Lincoln: Sizzling jazz and grilled T-bone steaks make a great combi-
nation at this steakhouse in beachfront Santa Monica. Call 310-828-3304
for more information.
 The Mint: This venue has great blues and jazz, mixing national and local
acts. Check out www.themintla.com.
 Steamers Jazz Club and Café: Latin jazz is an essential part of this
place’s weekly menu of jazz. www.steamersjazz.com.
The Los Angeles Jazz Institute is a lively focal point with a great Web site (www.
lajazzinstitute.org), extensive archives, and a solid concert season. If
you’re a jazz writer, a historian, or just a fanatical fan, this is the source of 
West Coast jazz history. The archives include personal collections from Gerry
Mulligan, Art Pepper, Shorty Rogers, Bud Shank, and other L.A. heroes.

Chapter 18: Ten Great Cities for Jazz

Orange County isn’t technically Los Angeles, but it’s only a short cruise down
the 5 or 405 freeway, and the Orange County Performing Arts Center is known
for primo jazz. Orange County’s wealth and prestige shows in its collection of
performing arts venues. The Center’s intimate Jazz Club series is especially
fine, presenting James Carter, Kurt Elling, and other marquee attractions.
Visit online at www.ocpac.org.
Miami
If there’s a capital of jazz with a Latin twist, it has to be Miami — enough of a
jazz city that the JVC Jazz Festival (www.festivalproductions.net/
jvcjazz.htm) makes a stop there, and touring acts like Wynton Marsalis
book into the Jackie Gleason Theatre (www.gleasontheater.com).
Pull yourself away from South Beach’s stunning array of Art Deco hotels and
go hear some live jazz at one of these venues:
 The Jazziz Bistro: In Boca Raton (42 miles up the coast from Miami),
this club was founded by a partnership including the owners of Jazziz
magazine, and it’s a jazz-themed club in the Hard Rock Hotel. Check out
the nightly line up at www.jazzizbistro.com.
 Upstairs at the Van Dyke: Voted Best Jazz Club by several local media,
this club is the prime spot to hear prominent players like Mose Allison,
Richie Cole, David Frishberg, Tom Harrell, and Bobby Watson in a histor-
ical building. Visit www.thevandykecafe.com for more details.
Salsa is hot jazz and dance music that’s splashed liberally throughout Miami,
at dozens of clubs including the following:
 Bongos Cuban Café: Owned by pop singer Gloria Estefan and her hubby,
and decorated with tropical touches, this is a great place to have a meal
and hear some Latin music. Check out www.bongoscubancafe.com.
 Café Mystique: The salsa dance known as “Rueda de Casino” was born
here, but if you don’t know how to dance, lessons are offered. Visit www.
cafemystique.net.
 Cristal: Shake it up on the spacious dance floor to live Latin music. Call
305-604-2582 for more information.
 Rancho Gaspar: This sprawling Latin music mecca is off the Florida
Turnpike at Okeechobee. Call 305-827-1659 for more information.
At many of these places, there’s an array of cross-cultural cuisine to go with
the music.
308
Part V: The Part of Tens

As in many other cities, local radio is a great way to tap the jazz scene in
Miami. Radio hosts usually give a rundown of what’s coming up the next
weekend, and they play a lot of good music (often including CDs by local
musicians).
Latin jazz musician Sammy Figueroa is a Miami institution; he hosts the “Latin
Jazz Quarter” radio show on WDNA-FM (88.9), and he can tell you which Miami
clubs and music are hottest. His CD . . . And Sammy Walked In was nominated
for a Grammy in 2006 for Best Latin Jazz Album. Figueroa also provided per-
cussion for Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins, and other greats.
For more about Latin jazz, check out Chapter 9.
New Orleans
It’s a tough time to write about jazz in the essential jazz city, as it recovers
from Hurricane Katrina, which struck in 2005. But as the once and future
Queen of Jazz, New Orleans earns its place in this chapter.
Jazz was born (at least publicly) in Congo Square, where the cultures and
music that merged into jazz mixed in public at a time when that couldn’t
happen in most American cities. Buddy Bolden made some of the earliest jazz
here, then came Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Johnny Dodds, King Oliver,
Kid Ory, and most all of jazz’s early greats (see Chapter 5 for details). New
Orleans also is the hometown of the prolific Marsalis family: pianist and father
Ellis, sons Branford (saxophone), Delfeayo (trombone), Jason (drums), and
Wynton (trumpet).
Jazz is an essential ingredient of the public party known as Mardi Gras, 
but for serious listening on a large scale, consider the New Orleans Jazz &
Heritage Festival, which serves up dozens of bands over several days every
spring. See Chapter 14 for details on this festival and check out www.
nojazzfest.com.
In addition to ornate buildings and jazz bars that look much the same as they
did in Armstrong’s era, New Orleans has many places where you can discover
the music’s history, including New Orleans Jazz Historical Park (performances,
lectures, walking tours of historical sites, and exhibits such as “A New Orleans
Jazz Funeral”). The park’s tours include neighborhoods such as the Canal
Street, Lafayette Square, and the Vieux Carré. Visit www.nps.gov/jazz/
index.htm for more info.
As for jazz clubs, they’re everywhere:

Chapter 18: Ten Great Cities for Jazz

 The Creole Queen: Take an old-school cruise on the Mississippi with
live jazz. For information, call 504-529-4567.
 Fritzel’s European Jazz Pub: Stiff German beer and authentic New
Orleans jazz make a satisfying merger here. Call 504-561-0432 for details.
 Preservation Hall: The popular center for authentic New Orleans 
jazz was badly damaged by Katrina but reopened in April 2006. The
Preservation Hall Jazz Band sustains its busy performing schedule,
including dates in New Orleans. Check this venue’s status online at
www.preservationhall.com/2.0/.
 Snug Harbor Jazz Club: One of the city’s leading jazz venues has live
music seven nights a week, including pianist Ellis Marsalis most Fridays.
Check out www.snugjazz.com.
 The Spotted Cat: This club has two bands or more every night, including
jazz, blues, and Latin music. Call 504-943-3887 for more information.
Visit this Web site to check the post-Katrina status of clubs: www.neworleans
online.com/neworleans/music/musicclubs.html.
New York City
Read the New Yorker and weep, if you’re a jazz fan who doesn’t live there. In
one issue, its calendar lists an all-star band led by saxophonist James Carter,
dueling pianists Bill Charlap and Bill Mays, guitarist Jim Hall’s trio, saxophon-
ist David “Fathead” Newman, trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, and, from Berlin,
Max Raabe and the Palast Orchester. Maybe not as impressive as bebop’s
52nd street hey-day, but magnificent by any other standard.
Jazz legends tend to play at the following noteworthy clubs:
 Birdland, www.birdlandjazz.com
 The Blue Note, www.bluenote.net/newyork/index.shtml
 Dizzy’s Club, www.jalc.org/dccc/c_calendar.asp
 Iridium, www.iridiumjazzclub.com
 Village Vanguard, www.villagevanguard.net
Jazz’s heritage in New York City is sustained on many fronts:
 World-renowned authors and critics such as Francis Davis, Gary
Giddins, and Ben Ratliff cover the music with sensitivity and intelligence.
310
Part V: The Part of Tens

 Prestigious jazz labels such as Blue Note, Columbia (Sony), and Verve
are based there (see Appendix B for details on them), as is the JVC Jazz
Festival (at Carnegie Hall and other venues), formerly the Newport Jazz
Festival (there’s a JVC festival in Newport, Rhode Island, too). Chapter
14 has the full scoop on this festival.
 Between his musical career and his other job as artistic director of Jazz
at Lincoln Center, trumpeter Wynton Marsalis creates critical mass for
the city’s jazz scene almost single-handedly. Get more info online at
www.jalc.org.
 New York University, the Manhattan School of Music, and Juilliard infuse
the scene with academic juice and young musical talent. These schools
can be researched at their respective Web sites: www.nyu.edu, www.
msmnyc.edu, and www.juilliard.edu. See Chapter 15 for more
details about music schools.
 Carnegie Hall (www.carnegiehall.org) presents jazz and improvisa-
tional music, along with its classical fare, and there’s almost always some-
thing jazzy playing on Broadway, like “His Royal Hipness Lord Buckley 
in the Zam Zam Room,” or some jazz-based dance by companies like 
Alvin Ailey.
 Jazzmobile, founded by pianist Billy Taylor, is in its fourth decade pre-
senting jazz concerts in New York City neighborhoods, as well as jazz
workshops in its building at 2230 Fifth Avenue. Look into this organiza-
tion online at www.jazzmobile.org.
Harlem has a healthily pumping heart again, including jazz venues such as
the following:
 The Arka Lounge: This neighborhood lounge has dancing and live jazz
(and Latin music). For information, call 212-567-9425.
 Bill’s Place: This spot features hard-driving old-school jazz in an atmos-
phere where audiences pay serious attention. For information, call 917-
837-6540.
 Copeland’s Restaurant: Soul food and jazz are featured several nights a
week, and there’s a Sunday gospel brunch. For more information, visit
www.copelandsrestaurant.com.
 The Cotton Club (not the original one): This spot reopened in 1978 with
Cab Calloway as the headliner and continues to present live jazz and a
Sunday gospel brunch. Visit www.cottonclub-newyork.com.
 EZ’s Woodshed: This is a jazz music store and café. Check out
www.bigapplejazz.com/ezswoodshed.html.

The Jazz Museum in Harlem, where bassist Christian McBride is co-director,
also presents an engaging array of lectures and performances. You can visit
the museum online at www.jazzmuseuminharlem.org.
When you get into town, find an Internet café (if you don’t have the Internet
at home or in your hotel room) and log on to www.nybluesandjazz.org,
an encyclopedic source of everything jazz in New York City.
Philadelphia
Philadelphia is only 100 miles from New York City, and that’s not a great dis-
tance for jazz’s spark to jump. Philly jazz dates back to early legends Eddie
Lang (guitar) and Joe Venuti (violin), both born in the Windy City (Chicago).
Later, guitarist Jimmy Bruno, saxophonist John Coltrane, bandleader and sax-
ophonist Charlie Ventura, and drummers Philly Joe Jones and Tony Williams
were among important players from this scene. Bootsie Barnes and Larry
McKenna are recent mainstays.
Good clubs to hang out in include the following:
 Chris’s Jazz Café, www.chrisjazzcafe.com
 J.J.’s Grotto, 215-988-9255
 The North Star, www.northstarbar.com
 Ortlieb’s Jazzhaus, www.ortliebsjazzhaus.com
 The Philadelphia Clef Club of Jazz and Performing Arts, Inc., www.
clefclubofjazz.com
 The Smoked Joint, www.smokedjoint.com
 Zanzibar Blue, www.zanzibarblue.com
Most of these clubs feature national and international names like Eric
Alexander, Jimmy Bruno, Winard Harper, Javon Jackson, Kevin Mahogany, 
Pat Martino, and Mickey Roker — it’s rare to have so many blue chip clubs 
in one city.
The Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts complex designed by prominent
architect Rafael Vinoly houses major entertainment including a regular
agenda of jazz on the order of vibraphonist Gary Burton and pianist Brad
Mehldau. Check out the astounding venue at www.kimmelcenter.org.

Part V: The Part of Tens

Other cultural venues that feature jazz include the following:
 Philadelphia’s International House is center for arts around the world,
with an eclectic array of music including African, improvisational, and
jazz — sometimes played all together. Violinist Leroy Jenkins and saxo-
phonist Henry Threadgill are among those who have performed there.
Visit www.ihousephilly.org for more info.
 The Philadelphia Chamber Music Society is grounded in classical music
but branches into jazz with prominent players like saxophonist Joe
Lovano. Log on to www.pcmsconcerts.org.
 Philadelphia Museum of Art (www.philamuseum.org) is a great place
to experience fine visual art along with occasional concerts by jazz
greats like Avishai Cohen.
National Public Radio (NPR) affiliate station WRTI-FM (90.1) combines jazz
and classical programming from its studios at Temple University, with several
hours of jazz hosted by real people every day. And while we’re talking about
Philadelphia culture and jazz, check out America’s leading lady of arts inter-
viewers: Terry Gross. She hosts her nationally syndicated public radio pro-
gram “Fresh Air” from WHYY-FM (91). She’s married to jazz critic Francis
Davis and often interviews jazz musicians.
San Diego
My own fair city doesn’t rank among the top five American cities for jazz, but I
include it here out of loyalty and a love of the underdog, and to prove that great
jazz exists in most mid-size and larger American cities, if you search it out.
One recent winter, you could choose from the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra in
La Jolla, vibraphonist Charlie Shoemake and pianist Bill Mays in Balboa Park
(our Central Park), the San Diego State University Jazz Ensemble featuring
recording artist Christopher Hollyday on saxophone, the San Francisco Jazz
Collective (vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson and other big names) sharing a
bill with the University of California San Diego’s Jazz Ensemble, and the
Rebirth Brass Band at a club called Canes.
Dizzy’s provides excellent local and regional jazz most every night, and the
club is an all-ages venue just a short walk from dozens of restaurants in the
historical Gaslamp Quarter and the San Diego Padres’ new ballpark. Dizzy’s
has become a local institution, and owner Chuck Perrin is a product of the
Beat Generation who still records and performs spoken word. Perrin’s tastes
in jazz were formed in the ’50s and ’60s. A typical month of music includes
313
Chapter 18: Ten Great Cities for Jazz

 A mambo night
 Boogie woogie pianist Sue Palmer
 Gretchen Perlato (winner of the 2004 Thelonious Monk Jazz Competition
for vocals)
 A jazz celebration on Bob Marley’s birthday
 The Miles Davis tribute band, ESP
Seats are all close to the performers, and the show exudes a familial vibe.
Without alcohol, audiences come mostly for the music, which creates a
respectful atmosphere. For more information on Dizzy’s, check out the Web
at www.dizzyssandiego.com.
Flipping through the San Diego Reader — the independent weekly that is the
authoritative source for arts events — you might find dates for top locals like
trumpeters Burnett Anderson and Gilbert Castellanos, Latin jazz band Agua
Dulce, and saxophonists Daniel Jackson and Chris Klich.
Another way to tune into the jazz scene in San Diego is by listening to Jazz 88 —
the FM radio station broadcasting from San Diego City College. Its signal can be
found in most parts of town.
San Diego lures its share of “name” jazz artists. The California Center for the
Arts in Escondido (about 20 minutes from downtown San Diego) presents
jazz ranging from guitarist Pat Metheny to the Juilliard Jazz Orchestra and
the touring stage show “American Big Band.” The 1,500-seat hall is one of the
region’s finest, in an architecturally magnificent complex designed by archi-
tect Charles Moore. To see a stunning picture of the complex and for more
info, visit www.artcenter.org.
As if that ain’t enough, jazz giants who call San Diego home include saxo-
phonists Charles McPherson and James Moody, and once in a while, you can
hear them in San Diego, when they’re not touring Europe or performing in
New York City.
If traditional jazz is your thing, try the San Diego Thanksgiving Dixieland Jazz
Festival with more than 100 bands, produced by the America’s Finest City
Dixieland Jazz Society (www.dixielandjazzfestival.org). See Chapter
14 for more details on this festival.

Part V: The Part of Tens

San Francisco Bay Area
Big time jazz here dates back to clubs like Barbary Coast, where Jelly Roll
Morton performed in the 1910s, and to jazz in San Francisco’s North Beach,
where clubs were jumping in the ’50s and ’60s.
The region has been home to jazz musicians including pianist Dave Brubeck
(who grew up on a ranch in Concord), saxophonist John Handy, vibraphon-
ists Bobby Hutcherson and Cal Tjader, and pianist Earl Hines, who moved to
the Bay Area in 1951 to take advantage of the area’s traditional jazz revival.
For years the Church of St. John Coltrane (www.coltranechurch.org) held
forth in San Francisco, using the saxophonist’s music as the centerpiece of its
services.
Leading places for jazz today include
 Yoshi’s: Yoshi’s, in Oakland’s Jack London Square, is one of the finest
clubs in the world, with a comfortable, contemporary interior, great
acoustics, and a consistently strong calendar featuring artists like Roy
Hargrove, Ahmad Jamal, Chris Potter, Russell Malone, the Mingus Big
Band, and McCoy Tyner — sometimes for a residency of a week or more.
Not long ago, Tyner played a week with a group including saxophonist Joe
Lovano, and a second week had Ravi Coltrane, McCoy Tyner, and other
prominent players. You don’t often see those kinds of residencies outside
of New York City. Check out the hype online at www.yoshis.com.
 Pearl’s: Sit down and dine and dig the jazz at this 1930s-style supper
club with crystal chandeliers and crisp tablecloths. For more informa-
tion, visit www.jazzatpearls.com/jazz/index.html.
 Savanna Jazz: Owned by educators committed to sustaining jazz, this
venue, with soft lighting and rich wood finishes, is a great place to hear
live music. Go to www.savannajazz.com/aboutus.htm.
Larger venues with regular jazz include University of California Berkeley’s
Zellerbach Hall (tickets.berkeley.edu). Bay Area saxophonist Joshua
Redman is curator of San Francisco Jazz, which presents jazz at places such
as the following:
 The Herbst Theatre, www.sfwmpac.org/herbst/ht_index.html
 The Palace of Fine Arts Theatre, www.palaceoffinearts.org
 The War Memorial Opera House, www.sfwmpac.org/operahouse/

The Bay Area is also strong when it comes to sub-genres of jazz, such as free
and Latin jazz. Formed in the ’70s, the Rova Saxophone Quartet invented new
modes of composition with improvisation. Their famous collaborators include
Anthony Braxton, the Kronos Quartet, and John Zorn, while their influences
range from John Cage, Charles Ives, and Edgar Varese to Ornette Coleman
and Cecil Taylor. You can catch Rova at a variety of Bay Area festivals and
venues and visit their site at www.rova.org.
If you crave unchained improvisation, the Bay Area has a strong scene you
can explore online at www.bayimproviser.com.
Thanks to Alice Waters of Chez Panisse (in Berkeley) restaurant fame, the Bay
Area has some of the West Coast’s best eateries, many of which feature jazz:
 Bistro Clement: The bistro serves French food and light jazz. Call 415-
387-6966 for more information.
 Enrico’s: This sidewalk café has excellent meals in the tradition of
Waters (lots of fresh local ingredients) and jazz most every night. Surf 
its Web site at www.enricossidewalkcafe.com.
Some of the area’s classy old hotels also have jazz, these include
 Hotel Rex at Union Square, www.jdvhospitality.com/hotels/
hotel/13
 Top of the Mark (high in the Mark Hopkins Hotel in downtown San
Francisco), www.topofthemark.com
 The View Lounge high in the Marriott Hotel, www.sfmarriott.com
 Jazz Brunch at the Ritz-Carlton, 415-773-6198
And don’t forget the Bay Area’s Mother Lode of nearby cities that offer jazz
with other adventures, such as the small surf and hippie town of Santa Cruz,
known for the waves at Steamer Lane (www.coastimages.com/spots/
steamer.htm) and the music at Kuumbwa Jazz Center (www.kuumbwajazz.
org), which catches big name players between Los Angeles and San Francisco.
San Jose has the Hedley Club at Hotel de Anza (www.hoteldeanza.com/
hedley.html) and the Temple Lounge (408-288-8518).

Ten Tips for Building and Enjoying
a Jazz Collection
In This Chapter

 Choosing your media and assembling a sound system
 Moving with portable music and headphones
 Setting up a music space
 Caring for your collection
 Expanding your collection
C
ollecting music is, to me, one of life’s great pleasures — the hunt, 
the find, the purchase, the payoff: playing it for the first time. I can’t
describe what a rush I felt when I stumbled across a vinyl version of the Duke
Ellington Orchestra’s famous live Fargo, N.D. 1940 album.
There’s only one rule about assembling a great collection of jazz: There are
no rules. The music you select is a means of expressing your own emotions,
personality, and tastes. The albums and artists you choose, the way you
store or display them, the equipment you use, the way you integrate music
into your life — these elements help make your personal statement. In this
chapter, I give you ten tips for starting a jazz collection and enjoying it to the
fullest.
Tell Your Own Story with Jazz
My collection is like a diary of my life. I started collecting music in the ’60s. In
orange crates is my adolescent vinyl, acquired between the ages of 10 and 20.
These records are a mix of rock and jazz: Ahmad Jamal, Miles Davis, Herbie

Hancock, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, and authentic
African Pygmy music on a Smithsonian Jazz Collection my mom gave me.
I can look through my collection and recall with surprising detail the places
or emotions associated with certain albums:
 Miles Davis was the first jazz musician who hooked me. I was 15, and I
listened to Bitches Brew over and over, mesmerized by Davis’s trumpet,
fascinated with the dense layers of instruments and sounds around it.
New details constantly revealed themselves. Most of my friends had
little interest in jazz, or even in Davis’s electric jazz rock, and those 
of us who loved it felt like we were part of a special underground.
 Miles in the Sky was another college revelation. I heard it for the first
time in a friend’s comfortable wood-paneled living room with hanging
spider plants. We were in a mellow mood — listening, not talking — and
the music had me floating.
 Saxophonist Sam Rivers released Involution when I was in college, too.
Involution was a reissue of music recorded in the late ’60s, and it took 
me deep into improvised acoustic jazz.
 Pianist McCoy Tyner’s double album Atlantis was partially recorded
during a performance I heard at Keystone Korner in San Francisco, and 
I didn’t realize until much later that Tyner was carrying the spirit of his
mentor John Coltrane.
If you’re just starting a collection, such memories will come to you one day. 
I find that the music that retains significant meaning to me came into my life
in organic, natural ways — I never set out to build a collection. Something I
heard on the radio struck a chord, and I went out and bought it. A friend rec-
ommended an album, and I took a risk. I started to like an artist, so I worked
my way deeper into his history with additional albums. Follow your instincts
and find music that speaks to you.
Listen to Jazz in Any Medium
Although most jazz is available on CD, some has never been released in digi-
tal format — one good reason to keep an open mind to vinyl LPs and 78s, and
even cassettes. I still play cassettes in my car (it handles both cassettes and
CDs), although the quality isn’t great. As you build your collection, be open
to any medium.
318
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Cassettes are delicate. Sound quality fades with too much heat and sun, and
tapes get tangled or broken. But cassettes are dirt cheap at garage sales, and
you can get a lot of music for your dollar. If you want to add a lot more music
to your collection quickly, cassettes are a good way to do it, but they really
aren’t collectible like vinyl or good-sounding like CDs.
Clean vinyl albums on a decent stereo sound really good. Many purists
believe that pristine vinyl on a decent turntable amplified by old-school
vacuum tubes gives a more real representation of music than CDs or down-
loaded songs. CDs contain music in digital form, whereas records have a nat-
ural range of sound. I think good vinyl sounds better than CDs.
The key to getting good sound from a record is having a clean record, a reason-
ably good sound system, and a fresh cartridge in your turntable. Some used
turntables are collector’s items and expensive, but there are affordable new
and used units; most new sound systems have a place to plug in a turntable.
The cartridge I bought recently (from an online store that specializes in car-
tridges) cost less than $50. See the next section for details on assembling a
good sound system, including turntables.
Rare vinyl is expensive, but great bargains can be found through garage sales,
radio stations, and relatives. A radio station recently sold several boxes of
vinyl to a collector for $100 (I wish I’d been there first), and I inherited a
quirky (though not jazz) collection from my grandparents (think Burl Ives
and Lawrence Welk) when they moved to a smaller home.
Here are more reasons to build a portion of your music collection with vinyl
recordings:
 Cost: Vinyl is cheap. Sometimes you only pay $2 or $3 for a vintage jazz
album.
 Looks: Vinyl looks great! Many albums are worth buying just for the
cover art. In fact, I display my old albums with their black and white
photos and cool type styles all over my house. I don’t believe that music
collections should be hidden away. Visitors to your home should be able
to examine your collection.
 Mood: Records hold less music than CDs, and the music is divided into
two sides of the album. Often, the two sides have different moods, or the
music has been put in a certain order to create a mood or tell a story. If
you want a truly authentic experience of music originally released on
vinyl, then you should hear it on vinyl.
You also can buy inexpensive hardware that lets you upload vinyl music to
your computer, although the process is time-consuming. From there you can
download it to your digital player. Some musicians simultaneously release
new music as vinyl, CDs, and online digital downloads.
319
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Building and Enjoying a Jazz Collection

When shopping for CDs, watch for the word remastered on the cover. It means
the sound of the original record has been cleaned up and optimized for CD. If
a title you want isn’t on a major label, read a review in a jazz magazine before
you buy it. You’d think that digital music on CDs would all sound pristine, but
a surprising number of bad CDs with muddy sound are out there.
As with records, your keys to getting good CD sound are a decent sound
system and a quality CD. Most of the music released on CDs by major labels
sounds good. Specialty labels like Proper and Rhino (see Appendix B for
more about them) do a great job of re-releasing vintage jazz in the beautifully
packaged box sets with extensive liner notes.
College age or younger music lovers gather most of their music digitally. 
A laptop computer or mp3 player holds thousands of songs. They can be
arranged into categories by style or artist or into playlists by mood or theme.
CDs offer better quality sound than digital downloads, but most listeners
can’t tell much difference.
Put Together a Good Sound System
You can get decent sound on a budget starting from $100. I’ve heard turnta-
bles that cost $20,000 and systems that run well into six figures. On the other
hand, an mp3 player or portable CD player plugged into one of those $50
computer speaker kits from a discount store pumps out surprisingly good
sound, too.
Here are some basic sound system options:
 20–60gb mp3 player, with computer or mp3 speaker system: Computer
sound systems with a subwoofer for bass are designed for loud video
gaming, which means they also have good volume and range for music.
An mp3-based system has huge capacity and is very portable if you buy
a compact speaker module made for your player. See the next section
for more details on mobile music systems.
 All-in-one compact stereo: Sony, Pioneer, and other companies make
these systems, and the sound is surprisingly good. They have enough
power to pump out bass, and they come with decent speakers. I had a
system with a built-in 25-CD changer, and it lasted for several years.
Set your multi-CD changer or mp3 player on random or shuffle, and
enjoy the sound of a radio station programmed by you. My 300-CD
changer in this mode comes up with combinations I never could have
imagined. French pop to Art Ensemble of Chicago to Outkast to punk
rock? Anything’s possible.
320
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Component system: Buy a receiver, CD/DVD player, two or more speak-
ers, and a subwoofer. If you’re willing to do some research, you can
handpick each item and get great deals from online sources. I bought a
refurbished Denon receiver for about $400 (less than half the list price),
JBL bookshelf speakers and subwoofer for about $400 online, and a 300-
CD changer from a discount chain for less than $200.
Stereo or multi-channel? If your system is only for music, get a really
good stereo receiver. If the system doubles as your home theater for
high-definition television programs and DVDs, get a multi-channel
receiver. For music only, you get more bang for the buck with stereo. 
You need only two speakers (and maybe a subwoofer for full bass).
How much power do you need? Like mileage ratings for cars, power 
ratings for audio equipment aren’t accurate or comparable. Generally
speaking, though, more power produces better sound. Even at modest
volumes, you need some oomph to push out good sound across the
range from low bass to high trumpet squeals.
 Old-school system: The best sound I’ve ever heard came from an analog
and tube-driven system (glass vacuum tubes look like cylindrical light
bulbs with a filament that glows inside). I’m not an expert, but you can
buy vintage or new equipment. There are Web sites, books, and maga-
zines devoted to this equipment. Most cities have at least one store that
specializes in this “audiophile” equipment. Before you even think of
buying it, take some of your favorite records and CDs and go listen to
them in a store. If the sound doesn’t blow you away, stick with less
expensive and more reliable digital equipment.
As if you don’t already have enough sources of music, here are three more: 
 Cable television: My cable provider streams 40 channels of music that I
can run through my sound system.
 Satellite radio: A subscription to XM or Sirius satellite radio costs about
$13 a month, and portable receivers bring music into your car, living
room, or hotel suite.
 Web sites: Web sites such as live365.com offer free Internet radio you
can stream through your computer and into your sound system.
Avoid those bargain price package-deal home theater systems. They’re okay
for watching movies at modest volume but not if your primary purpose is to
play jazz, with all of its nuances, at all sorts of volumes.
In my opinion, you must own a turntable. If you’re assembling a sound 
system from scratch, be sure it can accommodate a turntable. Some of the
less expensive systems don’t have a place to plug in a turntable, but most
component systems do. You can pick up a used turntable at a garage sale or
321
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Building and Enjoying a Jazz Collection

swap meet for about $25. You might also find one in classified ads or in a
store specializing in used equipment. Throw on a new cartridge for $50 or so
(replace the cartridge at least once a year because moist air, dust, and regu-
lar use take their toll), and you’re set. If you want a quality turntable, expect
to pay $400 or more.
Go Mobile
If you want to live with music, you can take it anywhere. A laptop computer
lets you listen while you log onto the Internet and get some work done in a
coffeehouse. An mp3 player lets you carry up to 15,000 songs (depending on
memory size) in your pocket, to the gym, on a walk, and in your car (with a
special transmitter, it plays wirelessly through your FM radio).
Large-capacity mp3 players store music on hard drives with moving parts 
that can fail. Entry-level models, on the other hand, use flash memory with 
no moving parts. It’s a more stable medium, and the capacity of flash memory
cards is growing.
Now that you have your player for music on the go, check out online music
stores that are actually quite reasonable sources for all your music down-
loads. You pay about $1 per song, and you buy only the songs you like. I’ve
purchased one or two tunes from an album that would have cost $12. The
downside to some online music stores is they make it difficult to transfer
music from an old computer to a new one or to store a copy of your library 
in case your computer crashes. But there are books that explain these tech
tricks; I recommend iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Tony Bove
and Cheryl Rhodes (Wiley).
Use Quality Headphones
There are at least two reasons why you need a good set of headphones: to
hear music loud and clear without ruining your ears, and to have a more inti-
mate experience of jazz. Believe me; you notice details in the music that you
never heard before.
Research is showing that kids who listen constantly to mp3 players are
already losing some hearing. Online, you can find information about the maxi-
mum volumes tolerated by human hearing and headphones that produce
clean, healthy sound. Use a search engine like Google or Yahoo! to get some
information on digital players and the risk of hearing loss.
322
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Cordless headphones are great for wandering around while you listen. If you
buy a set, be sure the wireless frequency doesn’t interfere with your wireless
phone or wireless Internet connections. When in doubt, ask the salesperson
at the local audio store which headphones are best for your needs.
Create a Music Space
With all the new compact and portable audio equipment, there’s hardly a need
to have a dedicated space in your home for music, but I recommend that you
create one because it’s easier to organize your music and arrange the space
and equipment for perfect sound. Here are some ideas to start you off:
 Get shelves to house your current collection with room for expansion.
Online sources including www.boltz.com sell some great shelving 
systems.
 Collect posters, photos, and albums with cool covers and display them.
 Print high-resolution photos — some of them by famous photographers —
of jazz musicians from the Internet.
 Use a space that doesn’t get too much through traffic, that’s not close to
other noisy parts of the house, such as the children’s television room or
an exercise room.
 Add comfortable seating — a couple of recliners or modern chairs are
better than a squishy sofa.
Discover New Finds from Other Jazz Fans
Building your collection is all about communication and awareness. Every
day brings opportunities to find out about another jazz musician or a great
band. And everyone you meet has a different take on music. Here are some
tips on how to discover jazz:
 Communicate with family, friends, and coworkers who share a love of
jazz. I work in a university music department where professors and stu-
dents tell me about an album, artist, or song almost every day. I write it
down or order it online immediately, before I forget. When someone says
they like a certain artist, ask them to recommend a specific album.
 When you hear a live band in a club, go up afterward and ask what
they’re listening to.
323
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Building and Enjoying a Jazz Collection

 At the record store, find out what’s new on a clerk’s mp3 playlist.
 Call your local jazz radio station and ask a deejay or program director to
recommend a few artists or titles.
 Surf the Web and when you find a fan or musician Web site, e-mail them,
and ask for recommendations. Sometimes a well-known jazz musician
may even respond.
Do Some Research for Jazz Gems
I hate to say it, but you’ve got to do some homework to build your collection
and your knowledge of jazz. If you love jazz, it’s not really work, and the
detailed facts you find in books and magazines greatly enhance your enjoy-
ment of jazz. It’s one thing to love an album and be able to name some of the
tunes. It’s a more profound experience to know when and where the album
was recorded, what that artist was up to at that point in his life and career,
how he connected with a particular producer or player, or why he had diffi-
culty getting the album made. Try the following tips:
 Research includes extensive reading. I collect books obsessively, even if
I never read them all the way through. Some books are great quick refer-
ences. I have several books about individual artists. Sometimes there’s
one chapter that makes the book worth having. My mom works in a
public library’s used bookstore and finds used gems for me. I troll used
bookstores for books on jazz history, styles, and theory.
 In most cities colleges, adult schools, music societies, libraries, and
other groups present lectures about jazz. Sometimes they have a musi-
cian talk about his music. Look in your local paper or call your local jazz
radio station to find out about them. Hearing someone explain jazz out
loud, with his own personal opinions, adds another dimension to your
appreciation.
 Colleges that offer a music major usually have great music libraries.
Sometimes a non-student can get a library card. Even without a card,
you can spend time there reading books or listening to CDs from their
collection. Libraries that check out CDs offer a great (cheap!) way to
hear more music.
 Jazz magazines are a good way to keep up with what’s new. I also order
old magazines from eBay, like the French periodical from the ’50s with
Louis Armstrong on the cover that I recently purchased for $7.
 Millions of Web sites feature jazz playlists and reviews. Radio station and
music Web sites offer reviews. Searching for an artist on a Web site like
324
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Google or entering a name on eBay may turn up titles you never knew
about. For instance, Barney Kessel is one of my favorite guitarists, and 
I constantly discover more recordings he plays on.
 Many albums include lengthy liner notes about an artist. Read this fine
print and you may discover other artists and albums.
Appendix C is full of jazz resources like books, magazines, and Web sites.
Edit and Upgrade Your 
Collection with Care
A collection is only as good as your ability to edit and upgrade. Build a collec-
tion that is as finely tuned from top to bottom as an expensive sports car. The
only way to do this is to constantly edit and upgrade.
 Go through a section of your music every few weeks and find the stuff you
don’t listen to at all. Trade it in at your local record store or sell it online,
and use the money to buy new music that suits your evolving tastes.
 Acquire some famous recordings for each musician as well as rarities
and albums by other musicians that feature your musician. Include some
live recordings too. There’s no vibe like the live vibe, and these can cap-
ture an artist at his or her best. (See Appendix A for more than 100 titles
that I recommend.)
 Use your growing knowledge of jazz to expand your collection at lower
cost. For instance, you might score a prized CD or record at a bargain
price, and resell it at a profit or trade it for something else you want.
 Keep your eyes open. A lot of recordings are out of print; sometimes you
can get a collector to make a recording for you, or you can find the
album if you keep a lookout for weeks or months.
 Keep a wish list of titles. Some Web sites allow you to keep a wish list,
and then they notify you if a title comes in.
Protect Your Stuff
I confess: I’m a chronic CD abuser. I say this with a smile, but the truth is I’ve
ruined dozens of CDs by letting them slide around in my car or shoulder bag.
You need a system for organizing and transporting your collection, and for
keeping it safe from the elements. Try out these suggestions:
325
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Building and Enjoying a Jazz Collection

 Records and CDs need individual protection. Store them in their original
jackets, or buy a CD case with sleeves for each disc.
 Don’t expose CDs or records to direct sunlight or to extreme heat or
cold. In the old days, the sun warped many of my records.
 Dust is your enemy. Keep it away from discs and records and your sound
system.
 If you live near the ocean, don’t put your equipment near an open
window. The salty moisture takes its toll by corroding metal parts.
 Keep your turntable covered. Never plug in or unplug components while
the system is on. Don’t crank the volume up all the way. The distortion
may shred your speakers. I’ve done it.
 Clean CDs and records with water and a clean cloth, or purchase a spe-
cial solution made for this purpose. Some CD scratches can be buffed out
with inexpensive disc-repair tools. I’ve brought many CDs back to life.

You’ve come a long way, baby, and you deserve a
reward. To tantalize your musical palate even further,
I present the appendixes — my gift to you. You unwrap a
list of more than 100 recommended recordings, a guide to
trustworthy jazz labels, and resources for furthering your
love of jazz.

Appendix A
More Than 100 Recommended
Jazz Titles
Your jazz collection should reflect your personal tastes and path into the
music, but in this appendix, I suggest more than 100 titles worthy of
inclusion in any collection that can get you started on building your music
library. Multi-CD sets of up to three CDs count as a single title, and I haven’t
even included larger box-set compilations. If you can afford them, box sets are
often a good place to start because you’re getting more music at one time.
I’ve tried to include several less-common choices here that demonstrate
jazz’s richness and a significant amount of early jazz performed on clarinet
and cornet (the trumpet’s predecessor) — jazz’s original leading instruments.
(Chapter 4 has general information about the instruments of jazz.) I leave the
newest music up to you and the critics. The selections in this appendix have
stood the test of time.
Early Jazz and New Orleans Jazz
Gathering CDs from jazz’s formative years gives you a chance to build 
your collecting skills. You need foundation titles by key players like Louis
Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton and ragtime composed by Scott Joplin and
others, but after you have a dozen or so CDs of music by well-known heroes,
you can explore musicians such as guitarist Eddie Lang and clarinetist
Jimmie Noone. Check out Chapter 5 for more details about early jazz.

Singers
The best jazz singers are sensitive interpreters of songs and brilliant impro-
visers. Of course, singers are only as good as the songs they sing. Luckily,
they can choose from hundreds of jazz standards with catchy melodies and

Appendix B
Trustworthy Jazz Labels
T
his list is by no means complete, but it includes a few labels you can
count on for high-quality liner notes, packaging, recording, and reproduc-
tion. As you build a jazz collection and gain knowledge of the music’s history,
you may want to peruse the catalogs of these labels. You may find one or two
that are especially well stocked with the kind of music you crave.
All labels have Web sites that list titles and let you order a catalog; I’ve
included the addresses in this appendix. Many of these sites are multimedia
events, with plenty of photos, samples of music, and artist bios.
Black Saint
Leave it to those tasteful Europeans to make the most of some great American
music. The Italian label Black Saint, based in Milan, Italy, has released first-rate
jazz (and improvisational and experimental music) for more than 30 years.
Today it’s run by Flavio Bonandrini, son of its longtime chief Giovanni.
A leader in free and avant garde jazz (see Chapter 8 for details about these

Blue Note Records
Founded in 1939 by Alfred Lion, Blue Note has a long, illustrious track record
when it comes to delivering blue-chip jazz. The label has also closely kept to
Lion’s original mission of capturing the essential “impulse” of “hot jazz or
swing” — not its “commercial adornments.” In other words, Lion was a purist
who worshipped authentic jazz and wasn’t interested in modifying it for
broader commercial appeal.
Lion’s earliest recordings include pianists Albert Ammons and Meade Lux
Lewis. Blue Note later recorded several famed artists:
 Sidney Bechet, clarinetist
 Earl Hines, pianist
 Charlie Christian, guitarist
 Tadd Dameron, pianist
 Fats Navarro, trumpeter
 Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, pianists
Blue Note hit a high mark during the ’50s and ’60s with big names:
 Drummer Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers
 James Moody, Dexter Gordon, and Sonny Rollins, saxophonists

developed new talents such as singers Kurt Elling and Cassandra Wilson.

Bluebird Jazz
Bluebird made its mark with bargain Depression-era prices (35 cents per
record) at a time when the going rate was 75 cents. Today the label (revived
in the 1970s after being dormant since 1950) is flying high with an ongoing
stream of reissues from its vast catalog. 
Artists who have a history with the label include

to Louis Armstrong, Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Parker, Ben Webster, and
other greats. The boxes and CD jackets come in bright colors with ’50s-inspired

the artists — often they’re smiling, which is a pleasant alternative to the
337
Appendix B: Trustworthy Jazz Labels

usual brooding portraits. Proper’s box sets include booklets that set the
industry standard. They’re often 50 pages or more and contain biography,
colorful stories, musical notes, and band lineups.

Rhino Records
Rhino’s debut release was a live performance at its Los Angeles record store

machine. Since then, the label has found its niche by releasing previously
unavailable recordings by important artists, sometimes acquiring cuts from a
variety of other labels.
Rhino Records is known for great packaging and liner notes that give bio-
graphical and musical details. This valuable source of reissues includes
music from Mose Allison, Art Blakey, Gary Burton, Ornette Coleman, Don
Cherry, John Coltrane, Duke Ellington, Art Farmer, and Roswell Rudd.

Sony Music USA
Sony wasn’t around in the early years of jazz (the company was founded in
1946), but it has become a major jazz label by acquiring Columbia, the long-
time home of Miles Davis, and Legacy, a major jazz label founded in 1990 to
reissue classic jazz from old labels like Brunswick, Okeh, and Vocalion. Today,
Sony offers music by dozens of jazz musicians, from Count Basie, Chet Baker,
and Sidney Bechet, to Machito, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Wayne Shorter, and

tions are a great way to score some rare tracks and get a taste of some fantas-
tic artists before committing to entire albums.

 The Pharaohs

Verve Music Group
Verve, a longtime leading jazz label, is a part of Universal Music Group. Verve
includes the GRP and Impulse! labels. The combined catalog is thick with
phenomenal jazz, primarily from the 1950s forward.
Verve Records was founded by Norman Granz in 1956 to oversee his past and
future jazz recordings. In the ’40s, Granz had made his name by creating the
Jazz at the Philharmonic series, which presented jazz in classical concert
halls. His first recordings were of Philharmonic concerts (the Complete Jazz
339
Appendix B: Trustworthy Jazz Labels

at the Philharmonic on Verve is a 10-CD set that captures the best of this
music, with performances by Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Parker, Lester Young,
and countless others). Granz was the first to realize the market for live
recordings that would bring the excitement and extended solos of concert
performances to home listeners.
After Granz sold Verve to MGM in 1960, producer Creed Taylor kept the 
creative vibe going, recording jazz by saxophonist Stan Getz (including Getz’s
popular bossa nova collaborations with Brazilian singer Joao Gilberto), 
guitarist Wes Montgomery, and vibraphonist Cal Tjader.
Other stellar names under the Verve umbrella include
 Cannonball Adderley, saxophonist
 Louis Armstrong, trumpeter
 Benny Carter, saxophonist and trumpeter

clarinetist and big-band leader.
The Benny Goodman Story: Comedian Steve Allen, a jazz fanatic, plays the

tainment but not good as history or at capturing Goodman and his music.

Bird: Director Clint Eastwood’s look at the life of Charlie Parker with the leg-
endary saxman played by Forrest Whittaker and with musicians including

look but not completely faithful to history — Dirty Harry and Forrest don’t, in
my estimation, capture the true essence of the man and his music.
Bix: Ain’t None of Them Play Like Him Yet: The title comes from a quote by
Louis Armstrong. This video covers the life and music of early jazz cornetist
Bix Beiderbecke, who achieved mythical status due to the fact that he lived
hard, played hard, and died at age 28 — having already made a major contri-
bution to the music.
Blow Up: An artsy black-and-white British flick from the 1960s, with David
Hemmings playing a photographer who solves a murder by blowing up —

the only drawback is that the video includes no performance clips.
The Cotton Club: Francis Ford Coppola’s spectacular musical set in Harlem
during its swing-jazz heyday, when stylish patrons hit the hippest clubs to

ered some of saxophonist John Coltrane’s best performances.

the making of the famous 1958 Esquire magazine portrait of 57 jazz greats by

soned jazz players.

other leading jazzmen in action.

Hampton, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and other famous players.
Illinois Jacquet: Texas Tenor: Profile of one of jazz’s under-sung heroes,
featuring his famous solo on Lionel Hampton’s “Flying Home.”
Jazz: Documentarian Ken Burns’ multi-part PBS series is rich in atmosphere,
content, and music, but gives short shrift to jazz from the ’60s on.
The Jazz Singer: The first movie to use sound, it stars the white Al Jolson in
blackface, capturing the spirit of the times, but not the true spirit of genuine
1920s jazz.

Kansas City: Those who view this Robert Altman film expecting epic treatment
of Kansas City’s legendary “territory” band scene of the ’20s and ’30s may be
disappointed. But the soundtrack album contains some great music by top
players including several of jazz’s Young Lions.
Lady Sings The Blues: Diana Ross stars as Billie Holiday in this musically
decent dramatized version of the singer’s life. Ross’s portrayal of the singer
as weak and dependent is considered by many people to be way off the mark,
but the film has one of Ross’s best performances as an actress nonetheless.
Lester Young: Song of the Spirit: Interviews and rare footage are included in
this profile of the troubled and talented tenor saxman.
Let’s Get Lost: A gritty documentary about jazz trumpeter Chet Baker that
follows him during the late phase of a life troubled by chronic heroin addic-
tion. Although the emaciated Baker is a sorry sight, his soul, charisma, and
musical genius come across, even in his final months.
Louis Armstrong: Satchmo: Includes rarely seen home movies of Armstrong
relaxing, as well as performances, TV appearances, and interviews.
Mambo Kings: Latin jazz master Tito Puente makes a cameo in this excellent
dramatization of Latin jazz and culture — a movie with a genuine plot, great
acting, and interesting characters (mainly two brothers who lead a hot Latin
big band), as well as mucho fine music.
Minnie the Moocher: Cab Calloway leads viewers on a tour of Harlem, remi-
niscing about the jazz scene of the 1930s and 1940s, with performance
footage of Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, Louis Armstrong, and others.
Mo’ Better Blues: A hip, lively movie by director Spike Lee, starring Denzel
Washington as a jazz musician.
Mystery, Mr. Ra: A video portrait of a jazz interloper — Sun Ra claimed he
came from outer space, and his music was plenty spacey. Surprisingly, he
began his career in Fletcher Henderson’s big band, and that’s only one of the
revelations about the avant garde keyboardist.
Nat King Cole: Unforgettable: Portrait of the great crooner — who was also
a first-rate pianist.

Space is the Place: A 1972 movie featuring Sun Ra and his Arkestra, it’s an
odd science fiction film made when Superfly and Shaft were all the rage.
Sweet Love Bitter: Comedian and social commentator Dick Gregory stars in
this fictionalized account of saxophonist Charlie “Yardbird” Parker’s final
tragic years. In the movie, Bird becomes Richie “Eagle” Coles — although the
name is different, some music aficionados prefer this flick to many others
that attempt to translate jazz to the big screen.
Tenor Titans: Hosted by Branford Marsalis, this one takes a look — and
listen — to several great saxmen including Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young,
and John Coltrane.
The Ladies Sing the Blues: Several greats, together on one video: Billie,
Bessie, Dinah, Lena, Ethel, Sarah, and others.
The Man with the Golden Arm: Frank Sinatra gives a great performance as a
jazz trumpeter who kicks his heroin habit. Fantastic score by Elmer
Bernstein.
The Trumpet Kings: Hosted by trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, a look at great
jazz trumpeters from Louis Armstrong to Dizzy Gillespie.
Thelonious Monk: American Composer: Portrait of the quirky jazz pianist,
including lots of rare footage of the master in action.
Thelonious Monk: Straight No Chaser: A profile of the pianist, executive
produced by jazz lover Clint Eastwood.
Vintage Collection: (Volume 1: 1958–59, Volume 2: 1960–61): Dozens of
jazz giants are captured in action in this video. This two-tape set offers a rare
look at Coleman Hawkins, Count Basie, Thelonious Monk, Ben Webster, Roy
Eldridge, Jo Jones, Milt Hinton, Jimmy Giuffre, Jim Hall, and others.
