First of all, I would like to thank David Barnes, Patricia Weir, 
Abhijeet Deobhakta, Nanda Padmanabhan, Nikhil Bangera, and 
Priyanka Baruah, without whom the book would have never seen 
the daylight. I would also like to thank Mohan Rapheal and Jimmy 
Karumalil for their efforts. After writing for so many sleepless 
nights, the book is finally over; but I want to thank all those who 
supported me at that time. My wife Ayesha for storytelling, Little 
Afif for missing his Papa, the staff of Somewhere In for receiving 
a sleepy developer in the morning, the staff of Pageflakes for their 
inspiration, and all the members of my PHP group, phpexperts. 
I would also like to thank all my family members for their great 
support during this period. Finally, I dedicate this book to the person 
who would have been the happiest person to see it; my father, Ali 
Akbar Mohammad Mohiuddin Hayder (1934-2006).

About the Reviewer
Nikhil Bangera graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Mumbai 
University and currently works as an Editor. His academic interests lie in Databases 
and Computer Security and he feels passionately about anything open source. This 
made him choose WordPress while looking for a platform to profess his obeisance to 
The Beatles.
I would like to thank my Mom and Dad for all their love and for 
keeping me with them for so long. To all my friends who love me, 
though I still show no promise of ever doing anything useful.

When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the 
relevant lines or items will be made bold:
<?php

WordPress and the 
World of Blogging
In the world of the Internet, you must have some sort of website to publish your 
identity. It could be somewhere where you can write about your work and interests. 
You may also write an online diary, which would be more interesting to read. 
People get to know you more than through any other media when they read about 
your regular activities, your thoughts, and news about you. These sorts of diaries 
are made for public viewing. People usually don't post their very personal or 
confidential information here.
These online diaries are interesting fields to grab news. "Netizens" describe these 
diaries with a special term "blog", which is actually derived from the word "weblog". 
Blogs are places where you make yourself global. They can be of different types. 
People always log news that interests them. Some write about music, some about 
politics, some about sports, and so forth. Blogs are the best place if you want to 
collect recent news. In real life when some natural disaster takes place or something 
special happens, journalists and other people always search these blogs to be up-to-
date. Recently, after the tsunami or after the bombings in London, the very first news 
was published in blogs. Blogs are a world-renowned system for publishing your 
content; there are several million active bloggers in this world.
Blogging History
According to Wikipedia, the largest free encyclopedia, the term "weblog" was 
first used by John Barger in 1997. In May, 1999, Peter Merholz converted the word 
into a new term keeping the characters the same. He made it "we blog" instead of 
"weblog". He especially pointed out the term "blog". Shortly after that, this word was 
globally accepted both as a noun meaning a weblog and as a verb meaning "to post 
in someone's blog".

WordPress and the World of Blogging
[  ]
One of the early blog sites "Xanga" had 100 weblogs in 1997, which surprisingly 
turned into 50 million by the end of 2005. People started using blogs globally in 
1999. Blogging started becoming popular when among others, Evan Williams and 
Meg Hourihan from Pyra Labs created their blog publishing tool Blogger. Using 
this site anyone can start blogging within minutes. The whole system was free and 
very attractive. Surprisingly, Google bought the whole service in 2004. Blogger is still 
a free blog-publishing tool, but under the banner of Google. The words "weblog", 
"weblogging", and "weblogger" were inserted into The Oxford Dictionary in March, 
2003. This purely indicates the magic of the word "blog", which is still the favorite 
publishing system among millions of people.
By the end of 2001, blogging had become more popular. Everyone focused on the 
possibilities and importance of blogs. Shortly after that people started researching on 
blogging. Even schools of journalism were very interested in the whole process.
There are other publishing systems like Wikis and CMSs, which also gained 
popularity in the meantime. CMS stands for Content Management System and 
these are generally used for publishing articles, news content, or general content in 
a website. They are especially built for maintaining every kind of website. Joomla, 
CivicSpace, Typo3, and DotnetNuke are popular CMS software systems. There 
is also a special kind of CMS that is called a Wiki. In Wikis any user can modify 
contents, and all the posts are editable by general users; and usually, Wikis are 
devoted to a specific audience. A Wiki tracks every change made by the users so that 
you can find who changed the information and why. One of the most popular Wiki 
engines is MediaWiki (http://www.mediawiki.com). A blog is also a kind of content 
management system but the main purpose is to maintain the articles chronologically.
Anatomy of a Blog
Unlike blogs, a blog engine is not a single website. However, the engine consists of 
different parts that are organized in a very structured way. Let us first discuss what 
the different types of blogs are.
Types of Blogs
In the real world, there are different types of blogs. I do not actually mean their 
purpose, but rather the category of their contents. In the following sections, you will 
see some of them and understand their necessity.
General Blogs
When people say 'blog', they usually mean the blogs that belong to this category. 
These blogs are generally text-based, but contain a lot of images and other media like 

Chapter 1
[ 7 ]
audio and video. These blogs are easy to maintain, lightweight, and are very popular 
for their simplicity. WordPress and Drupal are general blog engines.
Photo Blogs
Photoblogs or Phlogs are special kind of blogs where a group of people or 
individuals share their photos collected from various sources. These blogs are 
generally dedicated towards a specific audience. Most photoblogs are free. The usual 
subjects of photoblogs are films, wars, herbs, natural beauty or even weird images, 
and so forth; it's impossible to specify all of them. Professional photographers also 
share photos through their blogs.
In photoblogs, images are the main content; we all know that a picture speaks a 
thousand words. Among the photoblogs, one of the most important is Photoblogs.
org, which is developed by Brandon Stone. Photoblogs.org started with 15 blogs in 
2002 and now it contains around 10,000 blogs in 40 languages!
Some photobloggers upload images in their web space using any FTP application 
and directly link them through their blogs. Some bloggers use online photo 
repositories like Flickr (www.flickr.com), SmugMug (http://www.smugmug.com/), 
or Zoomr (www.zoomr.com) to reduce the bandwidth and also to achieve full-fledged 
image administration. These days PicasaWeb (http://picasaweb.google.com/) is 
also a very popular image-sharing service.
Mobile Blogs
Mobile blogs are often known as Moblogs. In this type of blogs, people access the 
contents and modify them for their mobile phones or portable devices like PDAs. 
Moblogs are usually developed in Japan where people have a huge number and 
variety of portable devices with cameras. The term Moblog was suggested by Adam 
Greenfield, who also arranged the First International Moblogging Conference 
(1IMC) in July, 2003. Mobile blogs are very popular these days due to the availability 
of portable devices. In 2004, on Singapore's national day, a national Moblog was 
launched, which is the first national moblog in the world. Mobile blogs are often 
known as gLogs (pronounced as glogs), when they are especially used as photoblogs.
Audio Blogs
Audio blogs are especially designed MP3 blogs, whose contents are downloadable 
in MP3 format. Most audio blogs are devoted to a special genre of music like rock, 
classic, or jazz. Audio bloggers also publish their content in AAC or Ogg Vorbis 
format, which is the most popular among *nix users. According to Wikipedia, 
many music bloggers publish content that may violate copyright laws. However, 
sometimes they manage to avoid it, since most of their contents are either old or not 

WordPress and the World of Blogging
[  ]
reissued recently and so may not cause monetary damage for the copyright holder. 
Many audio bloggers also place a notice in their blogs like "If the owner objects about 
this post, I will immediately remove it from my blog". Many commercial music companies 
also maintain audio blogs and publish their music files as an advertisement to 
gain popularity.
Video Blogs
Often known as vlogs, video blogs are similar to audio blogs except for the type 
of content they serve. Vlogs distribute video files to Netizens. These blogs became 
very popular when video streaming was invented and people started getting higher 
bandwidth connections than they had previously. After the marketing of Apple's 
iPod or iTune, vlogs became extremely popular. In the iTune community, video 
blogging is often known as "video podcasting". Some important facts from vlog 
history include: Yahoo's vlogger community grew to more than 1000 members in 
June, 2005; Apple declared that its iPod will play video files; and, Apple's iTune store 
will also serve videos. These days VlogMap.org shows vloggers from around the 
world with the help of Google Earth and Google Maps.
Common Terms
When you enter the world of blogging, you may hear a lot of new terms like posts, 
comments, trackbacks, and so forth. These are the parts that make a blog successful 
and usable in the real world. In the following sections, we will discuss in brief what 
these terms mean.
Post
Posts are the core part of a blog. Every time someone writes an article in a blog, 
it is known as a post. Whenever a post is made, visitors can make comments and 
follow-ups. In most of the blog engines, each post has a separate URL, which is also 
called permalink. With the help of different administrative panels, blog users can 
make posts in their blogs. For example, if a blog is text-based, there must be a system 
available to write the posts. If it is a photoblog, there must be tools available to 
manage pictures before posting. In audio blogs, there are also facilities for streaming 
the audio files.
Comments
Comments are actually follow-ups made to posts by the visitors to a blog. Comments 
may either be made by anonymous users or may require registration to write. These 
days many blogs allow anonymous users to comment, but with a necessary spam 
protection system. Comment spams are those useless automated comments that are 

Chapter 1
[  ]
simply advertising a product or a website or that are totally irrelevant to a post. 
These days some online marketing agencies are spreading advertisements via 
automated bots (bots are "robot" scripts). So if you allow anonymous commenting, be 
aware of comment spams.
Permalinks
Permalinks are an abbreviation for permanent links. Generally, a permalink is a 
permanent URL to a specific post in your blog. To optimize blogs for search engines 
and to make the URLs more readable, people use permalinks. Permalinks are 
short, straightforward, and easy to remember. In commercial websites with huge 
content, permanency of URL is a must to provide better marketing and advertising 
of the content.

WordPress and the World of Blogging
[ 10 ]
Let me show you why permalinks are friendlier with search engines. For example, 
suppose a URL is in the form http://example.com/ex.php?id=1&stat=4. When 
this page is linked from another site and the robots of search engines get this link, 
mostly they tend to skip the dynamic part of the URL. That is, the search-engine robots 
browse only up to http://example.com/ex.php, which by no means delivers the 
exact content you wanted to show. Moreover, consider the permalink URL that refers 
to the same blog post: http://blog.example.com/posts/php-lookback-2005. This 
is more readable and user-friendly. So permalinks are of great importance to bloggers, 
if they want to increase their site rank, publicity, and traffic.
Trackbacks
Trackbacks are referral links in which someone refers to your post in their blog. 
Basically, trackbacks are simple notifications that are sent when someone refers to 
the content of another blog. When someone trackbacks your post, a link to his or her 
blog will be displayed as a comment in that article so that you will be aware of all the 
referrals. However, spammers are also ready to abuse this useful system to advertise 
their product or websites.
RSS
RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. RSS is a very strong medium to 
distribute the up-to-date content or news from your website to the people who 
subscribe to RSS in your blog. WordPress and almost every other blog engine 
supports auto-generation of RSS feeds. RSS works great as an advertising medium. If 
you are not familiar with RSS, then let me explain it briefly.
A typical blog post RSS contains a link, a title, and a small excerpt of the ten to 
fifteen most recent posts. So when you make a post in your blog or someone posts a 
comment, the RSS updates automatically and your RSS subscriber gets an automatic 
notification about the update. They can then examine the RSS feeds and find the 
latest content. These days RSS is a very popular tool, but is highly criticized. This is 
because there are three independent forms of RSS that are not fully compatible with 
each other. They are RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, and RSS 0.91. Atom is rather a more matured 
syndication system that takes the best from RSS and is developed in a structured way.
Tags
Tags are keywords relevant to your post through which someone may find it. 
When you make a post, just find some keywords that best describe your post. These 
keywords are tracked by Technorati (see below to know about Technorati) and other 
indexing tools. For example, if you post about a natural disaster like an earthquake or 
hurricane, tag it with relevant keywords like land subsidence, earthquake, disaster, 

Chapter 1
[ 11 ]
and death. When people want to know about recent earthquakes, they may search 
with one of these terms, which will help your content to come in the front page. 
Simply use your common sense for choosing keywords. Don't abuse this tagging 
feature by using irrelevant tags to increase the traffic. If you abuse, there are chances 
of being banned from those indexing services and that will cause a major failure in 
your blogging life.
Please note that some blog engines, for instance Blogger, do not support trackbacks 
and tags unlike WordPress.
Your Friends in Blogging
Well, what if nobody knows that you have a blog or you blogged recently? Unless 
you are maintaining a very private blog, there is no value in writing your diaries 
without a reader. The question is how to let others know about your blogs. Of 
course, they would not be interested to read that you had a cup of coffee this 
morning or you slept eight hours last night. To inform people about your worthy 
content, a search engine is your best friend. So the more frequently you publish 
your content, the more the search engine robots visit your page. However, there is 
something really special for bloggers.
Search engine robots or spiders are automated scripts 
developed by search engine companies that crawl through 
the websites using the navigation links found on them. 
These robots just read the content of your page and add 
it to the search engine database by proper indexing. 
Thereafter, anyone can reach your page whenever they 
search for any relevant keyword that was present in your 
page content.
Technorati is the greatest content-syndication site, which indexes your content 
with the help of some tags. Technorati has automated trackback URLs, which ping 
the users when you update your blog. So Technorati indexes your recent update 
immediately after you make a post on your site and displays your post in that 
tag category. For example, when someone wants to know what other bloggers 
are thinking about AJAX, he or she goes to Technorati and searches for the term 
AJAX. Technorati will display all the blog posts that are indexed by it in different 
orders like chronologically or as per blog's authority. So you will not only get that 
information, but also you will be aware of the recent trends. We will learn the details 
about how to automatically ping Technorati to index your content in Chapter 4. Till 
then for more information visit Technorati at http://technorati.com.

WordPress and the World of Blogging
[ 12 ]
Another tool that helps you to publish your content for other people is del.icio.
us. If you read it without the breaks, you will find the word "delicious" in this URL 
http://del.icio.us/. del.icio.us is the largest public bookmark system operated 
via the same tag mechanism that is found in Technorati except that you have to enter 
your data manually. So when you make a post, just go to del.icio.us and bookmark 
your content with some relevant tags so that other people can find your content. If 
they find your content useful, they will also tag it and day by day it will be more 
visible to the outer world.
One more tool that you must be aware of is digg. This operates with a slightly 
different mechanism than the previous two. If you update your blog, just go to 
http://digg.com/ and submit your news. People can then rate your news by 
clicking on the digg option. The more your content is digged, the more popularity 
you will get. When people search your content, they get the most 
digged content on the front page. So you gain a great publicity, if your content 
is really useful.
All these tools are of very high volume and crawled by search engines every day. 
So if your URLs are indexed on these sites, no doubt you will get huge publicity. As 
more people visit your blog, you become more successful in blogging.
Meet the Giants
When you start blogging, you have several options for choosing a blog engine. 
You can choose a commercial one or a free one; you can choose a tool that suits 
you perfectly. Before starting a blog, just review the contents of your blog and the 
audience you are writing for.
In this section, we will see some popular blog engines, review their features, and 
discuss why WordPress is one of the best among them. We will also see what makes 
WordPress so perfect and popular, and how WordPress can fit to your needs.
The first name that comes from the history of blogging is Blogger.com 
(http://www.blogger.com). It is one of the earliest blog engines that is still available 
in the market. It's free to use but not open-sourced at all. You will find a huge 
blogger community who use Blogger.com.
Next we have the Blog City, another old but easy-to-maintain blog engine. You will 
also f﻿ind Yahoo 360 as another great blogging tool these days. Yahoo 360 started in 
2005, and came into the spotlight because of its abundance of features. We will also 
discuss MSN spaces, something from Microsoft that is similar to the Yahoo 360 blog. 
You will also see some of the features of the MovableType and ExpressionEngine 
blog engines.

Chapter 1
[ 13 ]
We will focus on some of the strong competitors to WordPress like boastMachine, 
Drupal, Serendipity, b2evolution, and Nucleus. Finally, we will see two other 
promising alternatives, namely Textpattern and bblog.
Blogger
Blogger is a lightweight blogging engine served by the giant, Google. This is one of 
the earliest blog engines that made blogging so popular. It is totally free to register 
an account with Blogger. The key feature of Blogger is its simplicity and its themes. 
The negative features are its incompatibility with plug-ins, being closed-sourced, 
and advertisements. Blogger blogs are very friendly with search engines as it 
is a part of Google- a very popular search engine. You can find Blogger at 
http://www.blogger.com.
Blog City 
Administering blogs with Blog City (www.blog-city.com), another senior from 
blogging history, is really simple; it's also free. The feature that will excite you most 

WordPress and the World of Blogging
[ 14 ]
is its simplicity. Their major goal is hyper minimalism. Although not feature-rich, 
Blog City is a text-based user-friendly blog engine. The missing features are a
photo gallery and eye‑splashing themes. Moreover, forced advertisements may be 
considered as another drawback. Blog City is also slightly heavier to load, i.e. it takes 
more time to download, than its peers.
Yahoo 360
Plenty of features make Yahoo 360 one of the coolest blog engines. Yahoo 360 was 
introduced in 2005. Generally, Yahoo 360 is a social‑communicating tool in which 
blogging is a feature. Integration with a lot of public services like Yahoo photos 
and Yahoo news makes it efficient and very strong in the market. However, all these 

Chapter 1
[ 15 ]
things also confuse a blogger whose main target is only blogging. At the time of 
writing this book, the Yahoo 360 blog didn't support plug-ins.
MSN Spaces
MSN spaces (http://spaces.live.com/) is the blogging tool introduced by the 
software giant, Microsoft in December, 2004. This blog is integrated with MSN 
Messenger and features a photo gallery, capability to SMS content from mobile 
phones, and integration with MyMSN. There are plenty of features that are not 
particularly suited for just blogging, but rather for social communication and 
personalization. MSN spaces serve advertisements in their blogs and the entire blog 
engine is a little heavyweight.

[ 16 ]
Six Apart
Six Apart (http://www.sixapart.com/) is another company that deals with 
blogging. It developed several popular blogging engines some of which are free 
while some are not. Among them, MovableType is a very popular blogging engine. 
MovableType sets the standards for many blogging features and develops one 
of the three popular blogging APIs (MovableType, MetaWeblog, and Blogger 
API). The other blogging engines developed by SixApart are Vox (www.vox.com), 
TypePad(www.typepad.com), and LiveJournal (www.livejournal.com/). Among 
these, LiveJournal is very popular. You would be surprised if you see some of the 
statistics of LiveJournal. It is a hosted free blogging engine that has more than 96 
million accounts among which 19 million are active. The number of posts per hour is 
above 18000.

Chapter 1
[ 17 ]
ExpressionEngine
ExpressionEngine (http://www.expressionengine.com) supports a lot of features, 
so it is actually more than a blog engine; sometimes it is called a web publishing 
engine by its developers. Even when you compare ExpressionEngine with other 
CMSs with its features, it will obtain a higher rank. ExpressionEngine is sleek, 
powerful, and documented very well by its developers. It has tons of features and 
modules. ExpressionEngine is a commercial and costly blogging tool (better say an 
advanced CMS), which also supports a very restricted free version with minimal 
features. Moreover, its administration panel is quite complicated, which can be 
daunting to learn for beginners and non-technical bloggers. ExpressionEngine also 
lacks plug-ins, themes, and a huge user community.

WordPress and the World of Blogging
[ 18 ]
Other Blog Engines
Besides these commercial or hosted solutions, there are also some cool free 
open‑source blogging engines. Let us take a look at them.
Serendipity
Serendipity, often called s9y, is a strong competitor to WordPress. It is feature‑rich, 
smooth, and well structured; so no one can skip it at a glance. However, the 
main problem of s9y is the lack of plug-ins and its heavy weight. s9y takes more 
bandwidth and time to serve its content than WordPress. However, Serendipity is 
a neat and very nice blogging tool for those who expect something more than just 
a blog. In Serendipity, you will have full control over plug-in development and 
management. This blog engine is compatible with different kinds of database servers 
like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. You will find Serendipity at this URL: www.s9y.org.

[ 19 ]
 
boastMachine
Another promising open-source blogging engine that recently came into focus 
is boastMachine (http://boastology.com/). It features rating of posts, a spam 
filter, an image manager, etc. By default, all these features are also available with 
WordPress via plug-ins. boastMachine is a lightweight engine. The main drawback 
of boastMachine is its incompatibility with plug-ins. Being comparatively new to the 
blogging market and maintained by a single user, boastMachine lacks a large user 
community and online help.

[ 20 ]
 
Drupal
Drupal is actually used as a content management system but was originally 
written by Dries Buytaert as a bulletin-board system. It's a system with very strong 
architecture featuring plug-ins and themes. Drupal has a huge user community and 
excellent documentation. Since Drupal's main goal is not blogging, it has plenty of 
modules that are best suitable for a website. Moreover, Drupal has modules like 
e-commerce, photo gallery, CVS integration, and mailing list manager. Mailing list 
manager is a feature through which you can manage a group of users and send 
mails to them. The Drupal administration panel is quite heavy and confusing for 
new bloggers. In the real world, there are different modified distributions of Drupal 
among which CivicSpace is a notable one.

Chapter 1
[ 21 ]
b2evolution
One of the greatest features offered by b2evolution (http://b2evolution.net/) 
is multi-user blogging, which is also present in WordPress via WordPress MU. This 
means you can host a single blog, but it can be used by multiple users as separate 
entities. b2evoution features auto-installation with minimum hassle. It's a feature-
rich blog engine. One of the greatest drawbacks of b2evolution is the lack of themes 
and plug-ins. Its administration panel is rich but very confusing. It is comparatively 
heavier than WordPress.

WordPress and the World of Blogging
[ 22 ]
Nucleus CMS
Nucleus CMS (http://nucleuscms.org/) is also a popular content management 
system. It is actually more than a blog engine. Nucleus supports a multi-lingual 
and multi-author blogging environment. Some other extensive features are the 
availability of a huge number of templates and plug-ins, an easy administration 
panel, easy syndication support, etc. Nucleus exposes a rich set of APIs to extend it 
via plug-ins. Administration of Nucleus is more complicated than that of other 
blog engines.

Chapter 1
[ 23 ]
Textpattern
Textpattern (http://www.textpattern.com/) is another lightweight blog engine 
that is compatible with plug-ins. Its main goal is to be a general-purpose CMS 
system. Textpattern supports multi-lingual blogging via UTF-8. Its feature-richness 
and easy administration makes it a very strong competitor to WordPress. Textpattern 
is developed by Dean Allen and is available on the market since early 2001.

WordPress and the World of Blogging
[ 24 ]
WordPress
WordPress is comparatively more lightweight than many of its siblings. It is a 
feature-rich, well‑structured blogging engine that has a huge user base. You will 
find the documentation of WordPress is some of the best documentation ever made. 
You will also get a very quick response from its user community to any problem you 
may ever have. There are thousands of contributors who are regularly developing 
plug-ins and themes. So if any lack of feature is found, you can easily find some 
good plug-ins to remedy it. Moreover, as a worst-case scenario, if you can't find 
any plug-in that fulfills your need, you can develop one on your own with the help 
of the state-of-the-art documentation and plug-in API of WordPress. Installing, 
administering, and maintaining your blog with WordPress is so easy that you 
require no previous blogging experience to deliver a world-class blog.

Chapter 1
[ 25 ]
Before proceeding further, let us see the complete feature list of WordPress:
Supports unlimited categories and sub-categories
Automatic syndication by RSS and Atom
Uses XML RPC interface for trackbacks and remote posting
Can cope with email posting
Supports plug-ins and themes (skinnable)
Ability to import data from MovableType, Textpattern, Greymatter, 
b2evolution, and Blogger, which is a great advantage when you want to start 
your blog from an existing one
Features extensive documents and a rich set of APIs to extend it
Very easy to administer and maintain with no blogging experience required
Very convenient search facility
Instant publishing of content, no matter how long it is, unlike some other 
blog engine where it is really a headache to update a simple thing
Multi-lingual blogging capability

Very well-structured administration panel with tons of features
Link manager
With the help of plug-ins and a rich set of APIs, you can modify WordPress to meet 
your requirements for even a complete website. Finally, WordPress comprises of tons 
of plug-ins, themes, and a really huge user community that can turn your blogging 
experience into a happy time.
WordPress is the best tool to start blogging with. Its administration panel will simply 
help you like a wizard. WordPress recently released version 2.0, which is a great 
upgrade, and has a lot of eye-catching features. We will cover them in Chapter 4. 
WordPress is developed in PHP, the world's most highly used scripting language, 
and uses MySQL as its database back end. So you not only get its cool features, but 
also the advantage of using the state-of-the-art database and scripting language. No 
doubt, WordPress will make your blogging life easier than ever. Let us now see some 
examples of other people's blogs, Codex, and some of its extraordinary themes.
The World of WordPress
WordPress is an open-source blog engine that is developed by Matt Mullenweg 
and Ryan Boren and released under the GNU General Public License. It's one of the 
most popular blogging tools among its siblings. WordPress is capable of managing a 
huge amount of data in a very structured way. Administration of WordPress is very 
simple, which makes it the first choice for thousands of users.
The name "WordPress" was proposed by one of Matt's friends, Christine Selleck. 
WordPress gained popularity and major acceptance among millions of users in a 
very short time. It has a huge user community. As mentioned before, one of the 
greatest advantages that you find in WordPress is the availability of a lot of plug-
ins and themes. The code of WordPress itself is very structured and makes it easier 
for developers to extend it by plug-ins. Codex, the official helpdesk for WordPress 
is very rich and it documents almost every piece of functionality delivered by 
WordPress with a lot of good examples.
We will discuss the pros and cons of using WordPress against its closest competitors 
later in this book. We will go through almost everything in WordPress. In a nutshell, 
WordPress is the easiest and the most enjoyable blog engine.
The best place where you can learn the ins and outs of WordPress is its central 
documentation system, Codex (http://codex.wordpress.org). WordPress has a 
world-class documentation and help system where you can find an answer to almost 
every question regarding WordPress. Following is a screenshot from Codex:
•

Chapter 1
[ 27 ]
Codex is divided into several categories and sub-categories for beginners, advanced 
users, and developers. Just head into the category to which you think your problem 
belongs. For example, if you find problems regarding installation, kick-starting 
blogging, or administration just move to the beginners section. If you want to 
discover more about using plug-ins, syndication, database backup, or moving your 
blog then head into the advanced category.
If you are interested in extending WordPress by writing plug-ins or decorating your 
blog with self-developed themes, go straight to the developers section and study the 
plug‑in APIs and theme documentation.
WordPress community also develops a cool forum named bbForum, which is also 
developed as an open-source forum module. This forum features different categories 
and sub-categories where you can directly post your problems and get help from 
thousands of users. You can also post solutions to other people's problems.
The WordPress community is very active and you will find rapid solutions to your 
problems here.

WordPress and the World of Blogging
[ 28 ]
If you are a WordPress theme or plug-in developer, you can publish your work 
in the plug-in or theme section of Codex, from where other people can find these 
updates. WordPress Codex is an interesting place for WordPress geeks.
WordPress comes with a great repository of themes and plug-ins that are contributed 
by its huge user community. Codex itself is the best place where you can find 
answers to almost every type of question regarding WordPress.
WordPress also maintains regular gatherings and meet‑ups on its IRC channel. If you 
want to participate just join #WordPress channel in irc.freenode.net with your 
favorite IRC client. You will find many developers and can talk to them directly. This 
is really great fun.
Posting and Participating in WordPress 
Forum
Whenever you have problems to which you find no answer in Codex, you can go 
directly to the community forum and post your problem there. While posting just 
keep in mind that you should tag your post with relevant keywords so that other 
people who encounter the same type of problem can find it easily.

Chapter 1
[ 29 ]
To post problems in the WordPress community, you have to register a free account. 
You can visit the URL http://wordpress.org/support/register.php and give 
your name, email address, and other optional things while registration. If you 
succeed, you will receive a password delivered to your mailbox. You can log in with 
that password and username to this community.
If you go to the WordPress support forums at http://wordpress.org/support, 
then you will find the following categories. Just select a category for your problem 
and post in that category. If you post in the wrong category, there are severe chances 
that you won't get a proper reply.

Finding Themes for WordPress 
There are thousands of theme developers for WordPress and most of their work 
free for public use. They all use some specific repository to publish their themes. 
The best source of themes and plug-ins is Codex. Let us look at the following URLs 
for themes:

To be informed about the arrival of new themes always visit the themes section in 
Codex and see the themes marked as new.
Finding Plug-Ins and WordPress News
Plug-ins are the most exciting feature of WordPress. They are small pieces of 
code that can be managed from the administration panel. The WordPress plug-in 
management system is so flexible that if you upload your plug-ins in the plug-
in folder, you will immediately get access to them via the plug-in section of the 
administration panel. You can also activate and de-activate them instantly.
WordPress plug-ins are basically meant to extend WordPress features. For example, 
if you want to add a photo gallery and a photo management system in conjunction 
with the world's best photo-sharing system Flickr (http://www.flickr.com), you 
can use FAlbum. You can syndicate RSS in your post using RSS processor plug-ins, 
which we will develop later in Chapter 9. You can do almost everything you want to 
do by using these plug-ins.
The best sources of plug-ins available over the net are the following:

There are several sites where news and events about WordPress are published daily 
or as soon as they are available. Moreover, there are several sites where you can find 
news about themes and plug-ins. The following are three up-to-date news sources of 
WordPress.
Blogging Pro at http://bloggingpro.com, the screenshot of which we have 
seen earlier in this chapter
WordPress Station at http://wpstation.com
And of course, Codex
Moreover, if you want to keep yourself up to date about new or upgraded releases 
of WordPress, you can sign in to its mailing list from the download page. When 
you subscribe, you will receive all upcoming news directly into your mailbox as 
the WordPress newsletter. Just notice that there is a mailing list subscribing system 
available at the bottom of the page (http://wordpress.org/download/). This 
feature really comes handy to keep yourself notified.

Summary
In this chapter, you have been made familiar with blogging and different types of 
blogging software. You have also seen the major benefits of using WordPress over 
other blog engines. WordPress is solely devoted to blogging, but you can also use it 
as a complete CMS with minimal hassle. Moreover, you will gain a lot of popularity 
with the WordPress community, if you develop themes and plug-ins. In the next 
chapter, we will discuss how to grab WordPress, set it up, and kick-start blogging.


Getting Started with 
WordPress
In the last chapter, you learned about blogging, its types, and the necessary blogging 
terms. This chapter will guide you through the process of setting up WordPress and 
customizing the basic features. WordPress is very small in size, easy to install, and 
easy to administer. This chapter will show you the different processes for installing 
WordPress and for setting it up.
WordPress is available in easily-downloadable formats from its website at 
http://wordpress.org/download/. Currently, WordPress version 2.0.5 is available 
for download. WordPress is a free open‑source application, which means you need 
not pay a single penny for whatever purpose you use it. WordPress is released under 
the GNU General Public License (GPL). If you are not familiar with the popularity 
statistics of WordPress, here is an exciting piece of news for you. The previous stable 
version of WordPress (version 1.5) had been downloaded more than 900,000 times. 
The recent version 2.0 has already been downloaded more than 1,316,092 times till 
the time of writing this book.
There is also a different version of WordPress with a multi-user blogging flavor, 
i.e. several users can maintain their blog separately with a single installation of 
WordPress. They can register and maintain their blogs independently of one another. 
This special version of WordPress is neither stable nor mature enough. Moreover, 
it is not officially supported. This version of WordPress is known as WordPress 
MU or WordPress multi user. In this chapter, we will only cover the installation of 
WordPress; however, we will discuss WordPress MU in Chapter 10.

Registering a Free Blog at WordPress.com
WordPress.com (http://www.wordpress.com) is a hosted service of the WordPress 
developers where you can register your blog for free. As it is a hosted service, 
you may not get complete freedom for doing all the things that are possible in a 
blog hosted by yourself. Especially, in WordPress.com you cannot upload your 
own theme or edit it unless you pay for it. However, even without that specific 
feature, WordPress.com is a great place to maintain your personal blog. I also have 
maintained my personal blog at WordPress.com for a long time. You can find my 
blog at http://hasin.wordpress.com.
To register your free blog, click on the Get a WordPress Blog Now link at the 
top-right corner. You will be redirected to the following page:

Chapter 2
[ 41 ]
Type your desired username and email address. Please be sure to check the license 
agreement checkbox as well as the Gimme a blog! checkbox.
After providing this information and clicking on the Next button, WordPress will ask 
for your Blog Domain, Blog Title, and Language as shown in following screenshot. 
You can also check if it's a private blog or not. Please notice that you cannot change 
the blog domain later. So be sure before submitting.
After providing this information and clicking on Signup, you will successfully 
register your blog in WordPress.com. However, remember that WordPress.com 
will send you an email with an activation link in it. You must click on it in order to 
activate your blog.

Installing WordPress Manually
As I said before, WordPress can be downloaded for a manual installation, which is 
extremely easy and requires no previous programming skills or advanced blog-user 
experience. It's simply some kind of ready-set-go type of blogging engine where 
you can easily start even if you are blogging for the first time. For the automatic 
installation, we will discuss how to set it up with the different administration tools 
available in cPanel.
First of all, download WordPress from its website at http://wordpress.org/
download/. It is available in both Gzip (tar.gz) and ZIP (.zip) format. Take a look 
at the following screenshot in which the download links are available on the right 
side; you may download either of them. If you are using Windows XP or Linux 
operating systems, you don't need to have any unzipping utility for extracting. 
Windows XP and later versions can directly extract files from compressed ZIP files. 
You will also get a built-in extraction facility if you are using Linux.

Before installing WordPress, please check the minimal requirements. You must 
have a web server that supports PHP. The best web server that you can count on 
is Apache. For PHP, you must have at least version 4.2 or later installed on your 
machine. WordPress will also run with PHP 5.x.x series without any problem. 
Besides, you require a MySQL database server; you must have at least MySQL 
version 3.23.23 or later installed on your machine. You may also have a local 
or remote MySQL server with complete privileges to create tables required for 
WordPress. If your web server meets all these requirements, it is surely ready to 
proceed further. Let us take a look at these minimum requirements once again. 
Apache mod_rewrite is also required for a user-friendly URL.
Apache mod_rewrite is installed by default in most web 
hosting accounts. If you are hosting your own account, you 
can enable mod_rewrite by modifying the Apache web 
server configuration file. You can check the URL http://
www.tutorio.com/tutorial/enable-mod-rewrite-
on-apache to know how to enable mod_rewrite on your 
web server. If you are running on shared hosting, then ask 
your system administrator to install it for you. However, 
it is more likely that you already have it installed on your 
hosting account.
Let us download the archive (either in .zip or .tar.gz format) of WordPress. 
Besides the remote installation of WordPress, I strongly suggest installing a local 
version as well. If you plan to develop themes or plug-ins, testing and deploying 
them directly to the remote server may require more time than testing and deploying 
them locally. Let us try the remote installation. If you extract the WordPress ZIP file, 
it will look something like this:

Getting Started with WordPress
[ 44 ]
Just note that there is a readme.html file inside this folder 
that gives you a very good introduction to many different 
features of WordPress.
Now we need to upload all these files to our website using any FTP client. There are 
several FTP clients available on the Internet for free usage (or as a shareware). Here 
we will use Filezilla (http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/) as an FTP client to 
connect to our FTP server and then upload these files. Following is a step-by-step 
guide to the installation process.
You can also use the popular web-based FTP applications 
Net2FTP at http://www.net2ftp.com or Web2FTP 
at http://web2ftp.com. Using these packages, you 
can upload archives from the Internet and they will 
automatically uncompress the archive. I found it really 
useful, because now I can always stay in touch with my 
FTP server without installing any desktop application.

Chapter 2
[ 45 ]
Step 1: Connect to your FTP Server
Using any FTP client, just connect to your FTP server and open the folder where you 
want to upload these files. I am using Filezilla as an FTP client here. After connecting 
to your FTP server, you will see the following window. (I am uploading my file in 
phpxperts.com in the testwp folder.)
On the left side, you will see the files from your local folder, and on the right side, 
you will see your remote folder.
Step 2: Upload the Files
Just locate the extracted WordPress files on your local machine from the left pane 
and drag all of them onto the right pane. You will see that all these files have been 
queued to be uploaded.
File transfer will then start automatically.

Getting Started with WordPress
[ 46 ]
Step 3: Install
Now it's time to install WordPress. For example, I just uploaded all my files at the 
URL http://www.phpxperts.net/WordPress. So this is going to be the URL of my 
WordPress blog. If you access your WordPress URL via your browser, it will look 
like this:
It says that you need to configure a file named wp-config.php before proceeding 
further. Open the WordPress folder and find the file named wp-config-sample.php. 
You have to rename this file as wp-config.php and modify its content. However, 
keep a backup of the original wp-config-sample.php file somewhere else for in 
case of problems. Don't worry; you need not be a PHP programmer for editing this 
file. Just open this file with a simple editor like VI or Notepad. The following is an 
example of the original wp-config.php file:
<?php
// ** MySQL settings ** //
define('DB_NAME', 'WordPress');    // The name of the database
define('DB_USER', 'username');     // Your MySQL username
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password'); // and password
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');    // 99% chance you won't need to 
change this value
// You can have multiple installations in one database if you give 
each a unique prefix
$table_prefix = 'wp_';   
// Only numbers, letters, and underscores please!
// Change this to localize WordPress.  A corresponding MO file for the 
chosen language must be installed to wp-includes/languages.
// For example, install demo to wp-includes/languages and set WPLANG 
to 'de' to enable German language support.

Chapter 2
[ 47 ]
define ('WPLANG', '');
/* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */
define('ABSPATH', dirname(__FILE__).'/');
require_once(ABSPATH.'wp-settings.php');
?>
There are several parameters for setting up a successful connection to the MySQL 
database. You now have to modify them so that they match the original settings 
of your MySQL database. If you already have a web hosting account, then you 
probably know the MySQL database details (i.e. database name, username, and 
password) for your account. If you don't have this data, please contact your web 
host providers for it. If you have cPanel in your web hosting account, you may 
create databases from the MySQL administration panel (depending on how many 
databases you can create for your hosting account). We will now discuss how to 
create a database from cPanel.
Well, it's not mandatory that you need cPanel in your 
hosting account to create databases. Sometimes it is also 
possible to create databases using Ensim, HSphere, or 
Plesk. If you have shell or secured shell access, you can 
achieve this functionality by giving commands.
To create a database from cPanel, log into cPanel and click on the "MySQL database" 
icon. You will get a page showing the details of your database entries. In this 
page, you will see a portion where you can create new databases as shown in the 
following screenshot:
Just enter the name of your database and click on the Add Db button; it will be created 
instantly. If database creation is successful, you will get the following confirmation:

Getting Started with WordPress
[ 48 ]
If you click on the Go Back link, you will reach the previous page where your 
database is listed in the available Db drop-down box. Now the next task is to create a 
user and assign that user to your database.
Enter a username and password into the text field and click on the Add User button. 
You will get a confirmation after successfully creating a user.
Let us assign full privilege to this newly created user of the database that you just 
created. Select the newly created user from the User drop-down list and the database 
from the Db list. Please ensure that you have marked the checkbox for All. Finally, 
click on the Add User to Db button, and that's it!
You can use this data for a custom WordPress installation.
If you are testing a WordPress installation on your local PHP, Apache, and MySQL 
installation, please log into your MySQL client and execute the following command 
to create a database:
mysql> create database wp;

Chapter 2
[ 49 ]
After creating the database, modify the wp-config.php file with the proper 
parameters. Actually, all we change here are the database parameters. For my 
machine, the wp-config.php file after modification looks like this:
<?php
// ** MySQL settings ** //
define('DB_NAME', 'wp');    // The name of the database
define('DB_USER', 'hasin');     // Your MySQL username
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'WordPress!@#$%'); // ...and password
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');    // 99% chance you won't need to 
change this value
// You can have multiple installations in one database if you give 
each a unique prefix
$table_prefix  = 'wp_';   // Only numbers, letters, and underscores 
please!
// Change this to localize WordPress.  A corresponding MO file for the 
chosen language must be installed to wp-includes/languages.
// For example, install demo to wp-includes/languages and set WPLANG 
to 'de' to enable German language support.
define ('WPLANG', '');
/* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */
define('ABSPATH', dirname(__FILE__).'/');
require_once(ABSPATH.'wp-settings.php');
?>

Getting Started with WordPress
[ 50 ]
If you have only one MySQL database in your web-
hosting account and you don't have permission to create 
more, then the $table_prefix setting in wp-config.
php is extremely helpful. For WordPress installation, this 
setting is used as a prefix for each table name; so there are 
no conflicts in between the existing tables and the newly 
created tables. By changing this setting, you can install as 
many WordPress installations as you want using a single 
MySQL database.
Note that I did not make any changes after the fifth line. Now again locate the 
WordPress URL via your browser. It now looks something like the following 
screenshot. Here, you will get a link to install.php.
Click on this install.php hyperlink. It will redirect you to the following 
installation page:
 

Chapter 2
[ 51 ]
Proceed further by clicking on First Step. This will redirect you to a page where you 
have to insert some basic settings about your blog.
Fill out the Weblog title and Your e-mail fields properly. The weblog title will be the 
title of your blog, and for all communication purposes WordPress will use this email 
address to communicate with you. So you must provide a valid email address. Now 
it's time to click and go to the second step. Do it and you will see something like the 
following screenshot:

Getting Started with WordPress
[ 52 ]
If you reach the page above, you have installed WordPress successfully in your 
hosting account. Just note that this page gives you an auto-generated password for 
your admin account. For my installation, it is 3564ff as you can see in the screenshot. 
This page also contains the link to the admin panel of your WordPress installation as 
wp-login.php. For later use, just note that you can get access to the admin panel via 
the URL http://your_WordPress_installation_path/wp-login.php.
Installing WordPress from the cPanel
We will now learn how to install WordPress automatically via Fantastico in cPanel 
and then log into the WordPress admin panel. There is no guarantee that you have 
Fantastico in your cPanel because it is a value-added service. Just log into your 
cPanel, and search for the word Fantastico. If you have it, you will find it. Follow 
these steps to get WordPress automatically installed on your hosting account.
Firstly, click on Fantastico. The following screenshot is a typical view of Fantastico 
after you get in. Note that you will find WordPress in the Blogs section of Fantastico. 
To start the automated installation, click on WordPress.

Chapter 2
[ 53 ]
Next, click on New Installation.
The screenshot opposite shows the page filled with sample data. If you want to 
enable blogging by email, then you have to fill out the email parameters with valid 
data. Please note that the data you give here as Site name will be the title of your 
blog. After entering the necessary data, click on Install WordPress.

Getting Started with WordPress
[ 54 ]
This is the final screen. Just click on Finish Installation to be redirected to the 
next page.

Chapter 2
[ 55 ]
In the following page, you have to enter a valid email address. The details of your 
WordPress installation will be mailed to that address.
That's all for installing WordPress from cPanel.
Upgrading WordPress from Older 
Installations
If you have an older version of WordPress installed and want to upgrade it instead 
of making an entirely new installation, the following steps will guide you through:

Getting Started with WordPress
[ 56 ]
As a first step, you must do the following for the security of your databases and files:
1.	 You must back up your WordPress database. If anything goes wrong while 
upgrading (there is a greater chance that everything will go fine), you may 
lose your database content.
2.	 You must back up all your WordPress files in the WordPress directory, even 
including the .htaccess file, if present.
3.	 Verify that these backups are not corrupted and you can use them later when 
required. If your Internet connection breaks during the download, you may 
have a corrupted file. So always try to check the backups to see whether you 
can unzip them.
4.	 Deactivate all your plug-ins. Deactivating plug-ins is a must, since some 
plug-ins may not work with the new coding structure of WordPress and 
these plug-ins may cause instability to your new WordPress installation. So 
before proceeding further, please ensure that you have already disabled all 
your plug-ins from your WordPress admin panel plug-ins section.
Warning: Do not start the upgrade process unless you have 
ensured that the preceding four steps are completed.
To upgrade completely, the following steps have to be performed:
5.	 Delete your old WordPress files except the following:
wp-config.php file
wp-content folder
wp-images folder
wp-includes/languages folder
.htaccess file, if you used custom mod_rewrite rules for 
your previous WordPress site
6.	 Upload  the new WordPress files to your previous WordPress folder. Some 
of the files may be automatically re-written. For now, just allow overwriting 
your files.
7.	 Run the WordPress upgrade and follow the necessary instructions from that 
page. You can access the upgrade page from this URL: http://example.
com/wp-admin/upgrade.php.
8.	 Upgrade your permalink setup to what it was before. If you wrote it in the 
.htaccess file, upgrade the .htaccess file according to the previous one. 
You have not yet been introduced to managing permalinks; that will come 
in the later chapters. You will then understand the importance of this step.

Chapter 2
[ 57 ]
9.	 Upgrade your plug-ins and themes. The new WordPress installation may 
break backward compatibility for some plug-ins. So plug-in developers may 
release new versions of their plug-ins that are compatible with this new 
version of WordPress. Just check the plug-ins that work with this version 
of WordPress from http://codex.WordPress.org/User:Matt/
2.0_Plugin_Compatibility.
10.	 Log in to the admin panel and activate your necessary plug-ins.
11.	 Finally, just ensure that all the features are working well.
We hope that you now have an upgraded version of WordPress running in 
your machine.
Basic Troubleshooting during Installation
After the completion of the WordPress installation, you may come across some 
basic problems. If there were some problems during installation, you may not 
have a proper output. We will discuss some of these problems and help you to 
get rid of them in Chapter 10. For now, you can visit the Codex site at 
http://codex.WordPress.org for some basic troubleshooting FAQ.
Logging into the Admin Panel
After a successful installation, it's time to get started. Let us log into the admin panel 
of WordPress to make some basic configurations. You must do it to get your blog up 
and running properly.
You can always log into the WordPress admin panel via the URL 
http://your_WordPress_installation_path/wp-login.php (for example, 
www.phpxperts.com/testwp/wp-login.php). You will see the following page:

Getting Started with WordPress
[ 58 ]
On this page, you also get an option to retrieve your lost password. For now, just 
enter your username that is by default "admin" and the password that you got 
during installation.
The WordPress admin panel displays tons of interesting features in a very structured 
way. We will get familiar with them with the passage of time. For now, we will only 
stick with those features that are necessary after a successful installation. Following 
is a screenshot of the WordPress admin panel that I see just after logging into my 
personal blog:
By default, the screen that you see just after login is called Dashboard. Here, you get 
some necessary and important information. From the dashboard, you can start basic 
things, start comment moderation, and see your recent posts and comments. The 
dashboard is a very important feature of WordPress.
Just below your blog title, notice a menu bar with different options like Dashboard, 
Write, Manage, and so forth.

Chapter 2
[ 59 ]
If you remember, during the final stage of manual installation (not from cPanel), you 
got a password with the help of which you logged into the admin panel just now. To 
keep such a password in mind would be a difficult task for many. So the first thing 
we are going to do is change that password into something more easy and readable.
Changing the Password
You can change your login information and password from the Users menu. 
Clicking on it, you will get a page where you can change your credentials and 
basic information. To change the password, locate the rectangle outlined in the 
following screenshot:
You can change a lot of information from here. Enter your desired new password 
and update by clicking the Update Profile button at the bottom-right corner. If you 
are successful, you will get a notice saying Profile Updated.
You need to change another important feature in this page. This is how other people 
see you in your blog. You can change this setting from the drop-down box named 
Display name publicly as. Select admin or your name from it. Just don't let others 
see you as your email address, which is the default. This may cause you to get a lot 
of spam in your mail box.

Getting Started with WordPress
[ 60 ]
Changing General Blog Information
You may need to change some general blog information like blog title, blog slogan, 
and so forth after a successful installation to kick-start blogging. For this, you can 
head towards General Options by clicking on the Options menu.
There are many options to play with, but we will only look at those options that are 
necessary as basic blog information. Here, you can enter your Weblog title, blog 
slogan as Tagline, E-mail address, Membership, New User Default Role, and 
Date and Time data. Most of these options are familiar to you except membership 
and new user role. WordPress is a blog engine where many users can blog at a 
single place if you allow them to write, after being registered. This means that they 
don't get a separate blog for themselves, but rather a single place where they can 
all contribute. They may have roles and privileges, and they can do a lot of things 
according to their roles. So be careful about these two settings.
There are two options available under Membership: one is Anyone Can 
Register and another one is Users must be registered and logged in to comment. 
The first one indicates that anyone can register in your blog and start having 
some fun. They can register themselves into your blog via the URL 
http://your_WordPress_installation_path/wp-register.php. If you turn the 
first option on, you will see something like the following when you visit that URL:

Chapter 2
[ 61 ]
If you don't allow public registration, you will get the following page:
If you don't need multiple users in your blog, it is suggested to turn this feature off 
because of possible security breaches. Moreover, this feature is not needed when you 
are maintaining your blog by yourself.
There is another setting that works in conjunction with the previous setting. This is 
the New User Default Role option, which means what should be the role when a 
user registers in your blog. If you allow public registration, just keep the setting as 
is, i.e. subscriber. Users as subscribers have minimal control over your blog unless 
you promote them to "Administrator", "Editor", "Author", or "Contributor". So by 
making them a subscriber when they register in your blog for the first time, you 
have less possibility of security breaches. Please ensure that you don't set them as an 
administrator, by default, else it might prove disastrous.

Getting Started with WordPress
[ 62 ]
You can also change the date and time settings from the General Options page. Here 
UTC time means "Universal Time Coordinated". This is same as GMT or Greenwich 
Mean Time. You can set it appropriately according to your time zone. For example, I 
live in Bangladesh and it's a +6 GMT timezone. So I would set the time in the Times 
in the weblog should differ by field to 6. If you are living in Canada, your timezone 
is GMT -6. So you will use -6 for this setting.
Posting your First Post
We have made a lot of settings and gone through several options. Now it's time to 
starting blogging. The core of any blog is a post, so you are going to make your first 
post. To post content, you can start by going to the dashboard and clicking on Write 
a post or you may directly click on Write from the menu bar. Here is what you see 
after you get in.
Every post should have a title and some content. There are many other options on 
this page, but we will discuss them in more detail in Chapter 4. For now, we will just 
write a sample article and post it. Write the title as you want and click on the Publish 
button once you are done. Don't worry about the sample post. You can manage 
your posts, edit them, or delete them anytime you want. So for now just make a post 
to start.
After posting, you can view your blog by clicking on View site in the top bar of the 
admin panel, just right after your blog title. You should see something like this:

Chapter 2
[ 63 ]
The WordPress post page features a rich WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) 
editor through which you can post contents in your blog. We will discuss it later in 
detail in Chapter 4.
Making a Comment
When you read your blog, you may see many outsiders making comments on your 
posts. You may also need to post comment on some of your posts in other blogs. 
Here we will discuss how we can make a comment on a specific post. We will 
comment on the post we just made.
You will notice a link saying No Comments just below your post. You can post 
comments by clicking on it, which will take you to the following page:

Getting Started with WordPress
[ 64 ]
Write anything here and submit your comment. If you make a successful comment, 
you will see something like this just under the content of your post.

Chapter 2
[ 65 ]
Retrieving a Lost Password
If you have lost your password and can't get into your admin panel, you can easily 
retrieve your password by clicking on the lost your password? button on the login 
page. A newly generated password will be instantly mailed to you at the email 
address given by you during or after installing WordPress via the General Options 
page. So always enter a valid email address; otherwise, it will be a big problem to 
retrieve lost passwords.
Summary
You have learned a lot of things from this chapter. Now you are able to install 
WordPress, make posts and comment on those posts totally by yourself. You have 
also learned how to change different administrative options for your blog. In the 
next chapter, we will discuss in detail the features for choosing and installing 
themes. In the meantime, play with these fun-filled features that you just learned 
about in this chapter.


Choosing and 
Installing Themes
In content management systems, it is a necessary feature to be able to change the 
look and feel of your website without knowing how to code in HTML and CSS. 
Almost every CMS supports the facility to allow users to change the look of their 
site. These managed looks are usually called themes. There are thousands of 
themes available for download free of cost. These themes are developed by 
members of the WordPress community and listed in a separate section in codex 
(http://Codex.wordpress.org/themes). Before using any theme, you should 
know some of the basic things about them. You must know how to install them, how 
to choose the themes that best suit your content and audience, and how to modify 
static content inside these themes. In this chapter, we will discuss all of these.
This chapter is a ground-up guide to using themes. The advanced topic of 
developing themes of your own will be discussed in a later chapter.
Finding Themes
Themes are basically distributed as compressed archives. To use them, all you have 
to do is to unzip them and place them in a special folder inside your WordPress 
directory, so it is not a complex process to do on your own. There are different 
websites where you can find themes in a downloadable format. Most of the theme 
developers offer their themes for free; however, a very few of them offer their themes 
for a few bucks. Some also offer customized themes according to your need, but of 
course that is considered as a paid service. If you are not satisfied with what you 
get for free, you may go for specialized themes. However, it is not a wise decision to 
head towards paid themes if you can get a similar one for free. If you finish this book 
step by step, you will also be able to develop themes totally by yourself.

Choosing and Installing Themes
[ 68 ]
Let us find some themes for our use. These themes are listed in mainly two 
categories, two-column themes and three-column themes. However, there are also 
one-column themes and four-column themes available in the community. Some of 
these themes are minimal and text-based; some of them are graphical. We will also 
see some of the very common themes well reputed by the WordPress community.
The Official WordPress Theme Page
WordPress distributes some beautiful themes from its original site. These are six in 
number, and are easy to experiment with. The URL for downloading these themes 
is http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/. You will find the Green Marine, Blix, 
Connections, Ocadia, Pool, and Almost Spring themes here. Among them, the Green 
Marine, Blix, Connections, and Almost Spring themes are very popular. Take a look 
at the WordPress theme-download section. One interesting thing is that all these 
themes are two-column themes, which is the most popular theme format.

Alex Marine's Theme Browser
Alex Marine is a developer who has spent a lot of time in developing various 
plug-ins, extending WordPress, and arranging the WordPress theme competition. 
His "WordPress 1.5 competition" had huge response. He has developed a 
theme‑browser website where you can select any theme from a drop-down box 
and instantly check the look of that theme. The URL of this theme browser is 
http://www.alexking.org/software/wordpress/theme_browser.php.
The winning themes from this competition are listed as follows:
Connections
Rin
Red Train
The 'Most Creative Design' prize was won by the Head theme. The 
'Pixel-Perfect Design' prize was won by the RDC and the FastTrack themes. 
The 'Most Versatile Design' prize went to the Zen Minimalist, Sharepoint Like, 
LetterHead, and Man~ja themes. You can see the complete list of winners at

WRC Theme Browser
There is another theme browser available called the WRC theme browser. This 
browser also enables you to view the look of every skin, but in a small grid, so you 
can view more than 16 themes at a time. You can also sort them by different options 
like one-column themes, multiple-column themes, alphabetically, widget-ready, 
plug-in required, date of publication, sidebars, etc. This is a very useful option. The 
URL of this theme browser is http://themes.wordpress.net.
You can also see the list of available files and a small description of the theme when 
you select it from the list.

Factors to Consider while Choosing a 
Theme
When you choose a theme, you should consider different factors like the content of 
your blog, the audience, and the meaning of the colors used. For example, you may 
see http://blogs.msdn.com and http://googleblog.blogspot.com. They are 
simple and elegant. They also serve their content in a formal and concise way so that 
it's a pleasant experience for all to visit them. This is just an example, but you may 
have to consider some issues like this while choosing a theme for your site. However, 
there is nothing to worry about; you need not be a color psychologist or a specialist 
in user experience. In the following sections, we will discuss some basic factors that 
should be considered before applying themes to a site.

Choosing and Installing Themes
[ 76 ]
Content of the Blog
It is a wise saying that "content is the king". Whatever your blog is about, content 
is at the heart of it. While choosing your theme, please keep a sharp watch on the 
subject of your content and whether the theme represents all the content that you 
want to show. Some themes can show static pages, while some can't. When you want 
to tell something that does not fall under a specific blog category, for example, about 
you or about your works and projects, that content is considered as static content. 
Content of this type is represented in separate pages. So when you plan to display 
static pages, your theme must be capable of showing them. Otherwise, you will 
add pages through the WordPress administration panel and they will not even be 
displayed.
Another important part of a theme is a "search" field. In this textbox, users can search 
for some specific keywords in your blog. Not all themes support searching. So please 
consider this option while choosing a theme, if you need a search button.
In themes, there must be an available place where you can add your favorite links or 
blogrolls. Themes must also support an RSS button, both in RSS and Atom format.
A typical theme must support archives where your blog posts are categorized by the 
date of posting. In WordPress themes, you can display your blog posts categorized 
by month, week, or date. These categories are called archives. Another important 
thing that themes should support is the display of available categories to which the 
posts belong. If a user can see the available category list, it will be easier for him or 
her to sort out what he or she is looking for.
In every post, a theme must supply a link for trackbacking that post. There must be a 
place where you can comment on every post.
Themes should also support pagination, which means having a navigation system to 
go to the previous and next pages. Usually in a WordPress blog, ten posts are shown 
in each page. So if you want to see previous posts, there must be a way to navigate 
through them. In the sidebar, many themes can display the latest posts and latest 
comments. Whenever a single post is displayed, a list of the relevant posts is also 
displayed in some of these themes.
Another very important issue is that some themes come with an inbuilt horizontal 
menu or vertical menu. Some of these themes are fine, since they use original 
contents of your WordPress blog posts, pages, and other stuff to create these 
dynamic menus. However, most surprisingly many themes come with some sticky 
content. For example, in some themes there is an option "About the Company" in 
the horizontal or vertical menu and when someone clicks on it, it redirects to a page 
that you can never create via the admin panel, or you can supply the contents for 
those pages. Moreover, it is totally irrelevant for an individual blogger to have a 

Chapter 3
[ 77 ]
default link "About the Company" in his or her blog. To remove those default menus, 
you have to modify themes manually and for this programming as well as HTML 
knowledge is required, which regular, non-tech bloggers may not have.
So while choosing themes, keep your eyes on these factors and judge whether each 
theme can really represent your content. Besides, keep in mind that people like 
simplicity. So if your readers are corporate users, try to be simple and precise.
Audience
Although there is no strict rule for choosing themes according to the article type, 
but if you look around, you may see that the appearance of a theme should match 
with the age of your audience, their mood, and their style. When you are writing 
for kids, you should choose something funny or colorful. When you are writing for 
travelers, your theme color should be green or blue, i.e. the color of nature. Travelers 
are always colorful, so try to use some bright and shiny themes. If your readers are 
corporate users, try to be precise while choosing these themes. Use your intelligence 
while choosing a theme according to the audience.
Colors and Fonts
Colors are also a very important thing when you consider the mood of your 
audience, and of course they are also relevant to the content of your blog.
Colors can give a very pleasant experience to your user, if you choose them correctly. 
Be very careful while mixing up different colors, especially for typeface. A very good 
color for the font may look very odd if the background color doesn't match with it. 
The colors that you choose for your blog will also determine the readability of your 
content. Nevertheless, have fun with colors.
Font is another issue to consider while choosing themes. Some fancy themes may use 
a lot of font faces in a theme, but that really degrades the user experience. Whether 
it's your own theme or a third-party one, try to use the minimum number of fonts. 
As far as possible, stay with only one font (size may vary for different sections, like 
header, footer, etc.) or at the maximum two.
There are some sites that really care about accessibility issues. Some plug-ins are 
available for switching between font sizes. For example, not all people may feel good 
with the same font size; these plug-ins give them the facility to increase the font size 
at run time.

Choosing and Installing Themes
[ 78 ]
Theme Size 
Many of these themes use graphical content. Some of them style their appearance 
using just CSS, some use both CSS and Images. If you look around some very 
popular themes like Green Marine, Almost Spring, or Blix, you will notice that they 
do the styling entirely using CSS; so they are small in size. Connection, another 
popular theme, uses a banner that is also very small in size. So you must make sure 
that your theme is small in size, and easy to load for users having slow Internet 
connections. If you use high-speed broadband connections, size doesn't matter for 
you. However, the fact is that you are not writing a blog for yourself. There will be 
readers from around the world where high‑speed Internet connection is too costly 
and they depend on dial-up or slow connections. So if your blog takes minutes after 
minutes to load, the chance is that the viewer will not feel comfortable and will be 
unlikely to come back to read it. Choose a theme that is decent, easy to navigate, easy 
to load, and most importantly comfortable to read through.
Installing and Changing Themes
So far we have learned where to find exciting themes and how to choose them. Now 
it's time to install themes practically on your WordPress blog. Themes are basically 
a set of files. Installing a theme is a very easy process. You have to extract the 
archive and paste the extracted content in a special folder called themes inside your 
WordPress folder. The following steps will guide you through.
Step 1: Download the Theme You Want
Wherever you can find your favorite theme, download it from there.
Step 2: Extract the Content
Now extract the content of that theme file to a folder on your local machine. If you 
plan to use a web-based FTP client like Net2FTP, then you can skip this step since 
with Net2FTP you can upload archived files in your FTP server and Net2FTP will 
automatically extract them if you need.
Step 3: Upload
Now you need to upload the contents that you have extracted from your 
theme to the themes folder of your WordPress blog. For this purpose, you 
must have an FTP client. You can either use a desktop client (my favorite is 
Filezilla; it's a free and an open-source program that you can download from 

Chapter 3
[ 79 ]
http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/), or you can use a web-based FTP client 
such as Net2FTP from http://www.net2ftp.com.
Uploading via Filezilla
First connect to your FTP server using Filezilla and locate the wp-content/themes 
folder inside your WordPress folder. Take a look at the following screenshot:
You can see only two themes here; one is classic and the other is default. WordPress 
comes with these two themes by default. Now locate the theme you want to 
upload. In the left-hand side pane of Filezilla, you will find the files on your local 
machine. For example, I am going to upload the almost-spring theme from the 
G:\Wp\themes folder.
Now drag the theme folder from the left pane to the right pane. It will be 
uploaded automatically.
That's it! You are done.

Choosing and Installing Themes
[ 80 ]
Step 4: Test the Theme
To change the theme and test newly installed themes, you must log into the 
administration panel. There is a menu named Presentation that will help you to 
change themes for your WordPress installation. Now it's time to test it practically. 
Log into the administration panel and click on the Presentation menu.
Please notice that our recent addition, Almost Spring 1.3, is visible on this page. To 
change your theme to the desired one, just click on the image.

Chapter 3
[ 81 ]
Now Almost Spring is our selected theme. If you browse your WordPress URL now, 
you will see the change.
Whenever you add a new theme in the themes folder, you will find it in the 
Presentation panel.
Typical Appearance of Different Themes
Here is the appearance of some typical one-column, two-column, three-column, and 
four‑column themes.

Choosing and Installing Themes
[ 82 ]
One-Column Themes
One-column themes just display posts, and sometimes have a sub-menu at the 
header and the footer; there is no sidebar. Let us take a look at a typical one-column 
theme. The theme we display here is Off The Wall developed by Sheba Um Malek.

Chapter 3
[ 83 ]
Two-Column Themes
Two-column themes display a column for posts and also a sidebar for displaying 
other information. For most examples in this chapter, we will use the Almost Spring 
theme, which is a two-column theme developed by Becca Wei.
Three-Column Themes
Three-column themes display one column for posts, and the other two columns for 
links. Let us take a look at the "Identification Band Triplet-Centered Boyish Style" 
theme version 2.0 by Frederic de Villamil aka neuro. You can find his other themes at 
http://t37.net/identification-bands.
You can choose another flavor for these three-column themes as shown in the 
following screenshot:

[ 84 ]
Four-Column Themes
Four-column themes are rare, though there are some very good themes available. 
These themes display posts in one column and the other three columns are 
used for different administration tasks. You can find four-column themes at 
http://fredericdevillamil.com/pages/themes#fourcols.
Some Unique Themes
There are some unique themes available, which enable several administrative panels 
when installed that are not generally available. Let us take a look at two of them. The 
first one is Kiwi, a fantastic free theme that can really bring an elegant look to 
your blog.
You can find Kiwi at http://no.oneslistening.com/. Kiwi is developed by Yas.

Chapter 3
[ 85 ]
Kiwi enables some administrative panels. With Kiwi, you can make any post a 
featured one. Kiwi also enables you to set some option froms the Options menu; you 
will find it named Kiwi.
 

Choosing and Installing Themes
[ 86 ]
From the post menu, you will also find some options from where you can select any 
post as a featured post.
There is another theme that can enable outstanding features for your WordPress 
blog. This theme is not free for commercial use. However, you can use it for almost 
any purpose if you like to use it personally. The theme is Semilogic and you can find 
it at http://www.semiologic.com/software/sem-theme/. The theme will convert 
your WordPress blog into a manageable CMS. You will have some great features 
with this theme.
After installing Semilogic, you will find several menus in your administration panel. 
For example, if you look at your Presentation menu, you will find the following:

Chapter 3
[ 87 ]
Semilogic enables the following administrative panels under the Presentation menu.
Basic Modification
There is no guarantee that themes developed by other people can fully satisfy your 
requirement. You may need something more that is not available in those themes. 
So the only way you can achieve that functionality is by developing themes on your 
own, or by customizing an existing theme. Here we will discuss how to enable and 
disable some functionality in WordPress themes. We will discuss developing themes 
yourself in Chapter 7. However, you need some basic PHP knowledge to modify 
themes for:
Enabling/disabling the page menu
Enabling/disabling search in the sidebar
Enabling/disabling calendar in the sidebar
Adding static content in the sidebar
Structure of a Theme
Before starting modifications, you should have a proper understanding of the files 
that are responsible for themes. When a page is rendered, it calls the index.php 
•
•
•
•

Choosing and Installing Themes
[ 88 ]
file in the particular theme folder that is currently set as active. The index file first 
loads the header, then displays the posts, then loads the sidebar, and finally loads 
the footer. So for the four basic modifications, we need to modify the file that is 
responsible for the sidebar. It is usually called sidebar.php.
To modify code in these theme files, you will get a separate administration panel 
under the Presentation menu. The sub-menu is called Theme Editor. You can edit 
either using this panel or manually by editing files under the theme folder. For small 
modifications, the Theme Editor is really handy.
Here you will see the code of the CSS file of the currently selected theme. You will 
also see all the files in the current theme on the right-hand side pane. If you click on 
Sidebar on the right-hand side, you will see the code of that file.

Chapter 3
[ 89 ]
Enabling/Disabling Page Menu in the Sidebar
If you open the sidebar for editing, using the theme editor or manually, you will find 
a line where the page menu is rendered. The line is as follows:
<?php wp_list_pages('title_li=<h2>' . __('Pages') . '</h2>' ); ?>
The function wp_list_pages() displays all the available pages in a list. The 
parameter Pages is the title of the section. So if you change Pages to anything else, 
like Navigation, you will notice the change in the theme.
<?php wp_list_pages('title_li=<h2>'.__('Navigation').'</h2>' ); ?>
If we remove the code or just comment the line as shown next, the page menu will 
disappear. Similarly, if there is no page menu in a theme, we can add this line to 
enable it.
<?php //wp_list_pages('title_li=<h2>'.__('Pages').'</h2>' ); ?>

[ 90 ]
Enabling/Disabling Search Bar in the Sidebar
Search is a very useful feature in a WordPress blog. Visitors can search for a specific 
keyword in your blog. If you don't find any search bar in a theme, you can modify 
index.php (the main index template) to achieve the functionality.
Usually search bars are placed in the sidebar. So if you find the search bar in any 
other place, for example in the top menu, there is a fairly good chance that it is 
inside the header.php file. In most cases, the search form is placed inside sidebar.
php. The file that is responsible for displaying search results is search.php. If you 
look at the index.php file of the Almost Spring theme, you will find that they 
include the search bar using a separate get_sidebar() function that actually 
includes searchform.php. Inside the search form, you will find the <form> element 
for search.
<form method="get" action="<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>">
<p>
<input type="text" value="<?php echo wp_specialchars($s, 1); ?>" 
name="s" id="s" />
<input type="submit" value="<?php _e('Search'); ?>" />
</p>
</form>
In other themes like Connections, Pool, and Green Marine, this code is embedded 
in sidebar.php. In some themes like Blix, the search form is embedded in 
header.php. You can easily locate the search bar if you analyze the appearance of 
your theme as well as the index.php file.
Let us disable the search bar. All you have to do is just comment the preceding 
code. In HTML, if you place some code inside <!--and --> markers, it will be 
considered as a comment and will not be rendered in the browser. Let us modify 
the code and make it look as follows:
<!--
<form method="get" action="<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>">

Chapter 3
[ 91 ]
<p>
<input type="text" value="<?php echo wp_specialchars($s, 1); ?>" 
name="s" id="s" />
<input type="submit" value="<?php _e('Search'); ?>" />
</p>
</form>
-->
Now refresh the blog and you will notice that the search bar has disappeared. If 
you find the search bar missing in any theme, just add the preceding code at the 
appropriate place and you will obtain the search bar functionality in your blog.
Enabling/Disabling Calendar in a Theme
If you can display your posts in a calendar, it will be very useful for your 
visitors. They can jump to posts of any date using this calendar. Let us look at a 
sample calendar.
This is a sample calendar in WordPress blog. WordPress has built-in functions for 
generating such a calendar. Please note that the dates on which you made some post, 
are highlighted and are clickable. For example, in the preceding calendar, you can 
click on 7th May to go to the post that you made on that day.
To enable the calendar in WordPress themes, just add the following code in 
sidebar.php:
<li id="calendar">
    <?php get_calendar(); ?>
</li>
Sometimes, in some themes you may need to add the following lines:
<ul>
..<li id="calendar">
....<?php get_calendar(); ?>

Choosing and Installing Themes
[ 92 ]
..</li>
</ul>
That's it!
Adding Static Content in the Sidebar
Usually a sidebar is generated dynamically, with various types of links. If you want 
to add some static content to the sidebar, open the sidebar.php file and add some 
code like the following:
<h2>About Me</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Hi I am Hasin Hayder, You can find my personal blog at <a 
href='http://hasin.wordpress.com'>The Storyteller</a>
</li>
</ul>
You will see the output as follows:
You can add something very special about you as static content in the sidebar.
Summary
This chapter describes how to manage the outlook of your WordPress blog. You 
have learned the necessity of themes, and the basic factors to be considered while 
choosing themes. There are plenty of sources from where you can download themes 
for your blog.
You also learned how to modify some basic features so that your blog perfectly fits 
your basic requirements. WordPress is a very popular and customizable blogging 
engine. So it's not a big matter to achieve great things by making small changes. Just 
practice these things, and you will discover many interesting features of WordPress 
by yourself.
In the next chapter, we will show you the details of posting, commenting, and other 
relevant features of your blog.

Blogging your Heart Out
WordPress is a very powerful blogging tool. It is user-friendly and gives you all 
the necessary tools for successful blogging. So far we have learned the features of a 
basic blog and the factors to be considered for choosing and installing themes. In 
this chapter, we are going to see the details of posting, commenting, and other 
relevant settings.
Posts in Detail
Posts are the main part of a blog. Every article that you publish in your blog will be 
considered as a post. Usually posts are same as blog entries. So in every blog, posts 
get the highest focus.
Before starting, you need to know about WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You 
Get) editors, in which you get the final result looking exactly the same as what you 
see in the edit box. This is a popular term for editors. In editors like OpenOffice or 
Microsoft Word, you can do almost everything you want to.
To give the same flexibility while writing in web applications, developers created 
JavaScript-based WYSIWYG editors. The most popular WYSIWYG editors for 
the web are HTMLArea editor, FCK editor, and TinyMCE editor. Prior to version 
2.0, WordPress had only a plain text editor. Although you can get WYSIWYG 
editors by installing plug-ins, this is something really big to get a simple job done. 
In WordPress 2.0, you have both the WYSIWYG editor and the plain text editor 
bundled together. The TinyMCE editor is set as the default WYSIWYG editor in 
WordPress 2.0.
Adding Posts to your Blog
Adding posts in WordPress is easy. We have seen the basic how-tos of posting in 
Chapter 2. In this section, we will go into the details of posting and will learn about 
rich text editing and how to get some extra jobs done while posting.

After logging into the WordPress control panel, you will find that there are two 
ways in which you can make a post. You can click on write a new post or, you can 
click on write from the menu bar; either way you will reach your posting page. As 
WordPress features rich text editing, you can do a lot of things with this cool editor. 
As you write, it will automatically format your text into HTML. Besides rich text 
editing, you must have some basic knowledge about any markup language like 
HTML. Let us take a look at the writing environment for your article:
The preceding screenshot is a combined view of the various significant parts of the 
post editor. Wordpress gives you ultimate control over your content. You can do 
almost everything with it. Following are the parts visible in the screenshot:
Title: Every post must have a title. This is the first thing that people will 
see. If the title is interesting, they will go through your content. So you must 
choose some attractive but relevant title for your post. Don't make it short or 
cryptic, but rather simple and informative. Another advantage of a good title 
is that a title with important words will increase the search-engine ranking of 
your page. Users will get your page easily via search engines if the titles are 
relevant to what they are looking for.

Chapter 4
[ 95 ]
Content: While writing your content, always use hyperlinks to the key 
points of your content. This will increase your page rank by generating 
outgoing requests. For example, if you write a post describing something 
about WordPress, always make the word "WordPress" hyperlinked to its 
website http://www.wordpress.org. Later in this chapter, we will see how 
to format your content as rich text. For the time being, just remember that 
content is something that keeps your site alive and makes it popular.
Image uploader: In WordPress 1.5.x, it was a hassle to add images to your 
post content. In Wordpress 2.0, this has been simplified by providing this 
image uploader option. With this option, you can upload as many images as 
you want. These images will be stored into a basic repository from which you 
can use and reuse them time after time.
Discussion Settings: With this settings panel, you may or may not permit 
the viewers of your article to make a comment about your post. You can also 
allow/disallow anyone to make trackbacks to this post. All these settings 
are to fight against comment flooding and comment spamming. Comment 
spam is an advertising technique where spammers post a lot of comments 
including URLs of their products. Sometimes they create automated scripts 
that surf from blog to blog and automatically submit comments. Excessive 
comment spamming is known as comment flooding.
Password Protection Settings: Sometimes you may need to post for a specific 
audience. You may not want anybody excluding them to see this post. For 
example, your project manager made some post specific to developers or QA 
assistants and he may not want it to be visible to others. In such a scenario, 
you can protect your post with a password. So if anyone knows the password 
to this post, he or she can read the content. The rest of them can only see 
the title.
Post slug: A post slug is a keyword that describes your post. So when some 
tag‑crawler crawls through your post, it can understand what your post is 
all about. Always use relevant keywords to describe your post. This is also 
extremely useful for posts with long titles. If your WordPress installation 
has custom URL mapping for post permalinks, the long title might look 
very odd. So you can write anything as a post slug and your URL will be 
formatted accordingly. This is also useful for bloggers who blog in Unicode 
(UTF-8). For example, one of my blog's URL is: http://hasin.wordpress.
com/2006/09/24/%e0%a6%ae%e0%a7%87%e0%a6%98-%e0%a6%a6%e0%a7%87%
e0%a6%96%e0%a6%a4%e0%a7%87-%e0%a6%87%e0%a6%9a%e0%a7%8d%e0%a6%9
b%e0%a7%87-%e0%a6%95%e0%a6%b0%e0%a7%87-%e0%a6%96%e0%a7%81%e0%a
6%ac-%e0%a6%9b%e0%a7%8b%e0%a6/. I then type "cloud" as post slug and my 
URL is reformatted as http://hasin.wordpress.com/2006/09/24/cloud/.

Categories: When you write your content, don't forget to specify the category 
it should belong to. You may post articles on different topics like Information 
Technology, Open-Source, Just about You, and so forth in your blog. So 
when visitors visit your blog, they can choose their topic of interest. When 
they click on the Open-Source category, they will see only those posts that 
you post under the Open-Source category. It will save their time and increase 
the readability of your blog. So always use categories in your posts.
Post Status: Sometimes you may not be ready to write the whole content at 
once. You may want to write it part by part or you may plan for future edits. 
In this case, you may not want to publish your post until you finish writing 
it. So with these settings you can specify whether your post will be published 
or saved internally as a draft. You may also want this post to be visible to 
all the registered members of your blog. You can then publish your post as 
"private". The Post Status option helps you with these settings.
Timestamp Settings: If you want to make a post today but want to show it 
posted at a previous date, or at a future date (probably you won't want it to), 
this option will help you to change the date settings specific to that post.
Trackbacks: We discussed a lot about trackbacks in Chapter 1. If you are 
posting about a topic that is already covered in another blog, then you may 
ping that blog as a confirmation that your post is relevant to that post. If that 
user allows trackbacks to his or her post, then immediately after pinging his 
post, there will be a comment with a link to your post published in his or her 
post. So trackbacks always increase site ranking by creating incoming links 
(or simply link exchanges).
Post Author Settings: From the Post author section on the right side, you 
will get a list of all the available users in your blog. If you are the only author 
of your blog, there is nothing to change. However, if there are multiple 
authors registered in your blog, then while writing a post you can select 
any author name from the list and the post will be displayed as posted by 
that author.
Rich Text Editing
In the post editing page, you will get a WYSIWYG editor for editing the content of 
your post. WYSIWYG editors are also known as rich text editors. WordPress uses 
the TinyMCE editor as its integrated rich text editor. These editors automatically 
generate necessary HTML code as soon as you format the content. You don't need to 
bother about anything else like HTML tags, hyperlinks, images, etc. In this section, 
we will delve into the rich text editing environment integrated with WordPress.

The following screenshot shows the toolbar that helps you to format your text. Let's 
see what the tools actually do.
The following three buttons help you to make your text bold, italics, or 
strikethrough. To see them in action, just select some text inside your editor and click 
on one of these buttons.
The following four buttons help you to add bullets or numbered bullets, and outdent 
or indent your text, respectively. You will get the outdent button enabled only when 
you are inside an indented text block.
The following set of buttons is for justifying your text. By clicking on them, you can 
make your paragraph left-justified, centered, or right-justified respectively.
If you are not familiar with justifying, let's take a look at the following image to 
understand what left, center, and right justification are.
In the preceding screenshot, the first paragraph is left-justified, next paragraph is 
centered, and the last paragraph is right-justified.

The following buttons help you to add a hyperlink or remove an existing hyperlink 
from your content.
To make any content hyperlinked, select some text that you want to have as a 
hyperlink and then click on the first button. You will be asked for the URL of the 
hyperlink. If your URL is an absolute URL to another site or web page, insert the 
URL followed by some required text. Following is a screenshot while inserting 
a hyperlink:
From the hyperlink dialog box, select the window in which the hyperlinked URL 
will open. You can select either Open link in a new window or Open link in same 
window as target; however, the better choice is opening the link in a new window as 
users can read both your post content and the new URL at the same time. Title is the 
displayable text that you will see when you move your mouse over this hyperlink. 
To remove a hyperlink, just select the hyperlinked text and click on the second 
hyperlink button.
Using the following button you can insert an image. Just remember that you can only 
include an image from an existing URL.
If you want to insert images of your own, you have to use the image uploader that 
comes later in this chapter. You will get the following dialog box when you click on 
this button.

Insert any Image URL following the text http://, for example 
http://www.packtpub.com/images/logo.jpeg. Image description is the text that 
is displayed when the image fails to load. You can use different alignment options 
from the alignment drop-down box.
If your content is too large, it may not be wise to display all of it on the front page of 
your blog. If you do, the blog front page may look ugly and people may lose interest 
in reading your blog because they have to scroll down a long post made by you and 
then find your next post. It is a better decision to display portions of your post and 
add a Read more link in your front page under each long post.
After reading the excerpt, if anyone is interested, he or she may click on the Read 
more link to read the rest of your post. This technique helps to make your blog look 
professionally neat and clean. You can display the excerpt up to a marker point in 
your post. This marker is <!--more-->. If you insert this marker inside your content, 
the text before this marker will be considered as the excerpt and displayed on the 
front page. The following button inserts the marker when you click on it:
These buttons help you to undo and redo your actions, respectively.
The next button, shown overleaf, is an interesting tool in this rich text editor. I have 
already said that rich text editors automatically generate HTML equivalent to your 
formatted content. After editing text, you can see its exact HTML code by clicking 
this button.

You can even edit the HTML code directly from this code box. Take a look at 
the following screenshot. The HTML code box shows you the exact HTML code 
according to your formatted content.
This button shows some necessary help while editing rich text. You will find some 
great help here.
Shortcuts while Editing
There are several keyboard shortcuts available while editing in the rich text editor. 
These shortcuts save your time and help you to write your content smoothly without 
interruption. Let's look at the available Hotkeys; you will find them by clicking the 
help button inside your rich text editor.

Uploading and Using Images in your Post
When you need to upload and use your own images, you have to use the image 
uploader available within the post section. This uploader helps you to upload 
images, manage them, and reuse them as many times as you want. You can upload 
images with all possible extensions like .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp, etc. Let us 
take a closer look at the image uploader.
To upload an image, let's browse for it. Give the image a relevant title and some 
description that helps you choose the right image from a set of uploaded images. 
After selecting the image file and inserting a title and a description, click on the 
Upload button.

This is the thumbnail of the uploaded image file.
If you click on it, you will see a menu that appears instantly as follows. The first three 
of these options will change one after another if you click over them. For example, if 
you click on Using Thumbnail, it will display the next active option Using Original, 
and so forth. In this picture, you are just viewing the default options that will change 
if you click on any of them.
The first option is Using Original or Using Thumbnail; this is how the image will be 
displayed in your post content.
The second option is Not Linked, Linked to Image, or Linked to Page. This 
specifies which action will take place when someone clicks over this image. There 
are three choices:
When someone clicks on this image nothing happens (specified by 
Not Linked).
When someone clicks on the thumbnailed image it shows the original image 
itself (specified by Linked to Image).
When someone clicks on this image it redirects to the container post 
(specified by Linked to page).
The third option is Send to Editor. When you click on it, the image will be inserted 
into your rich text editor.
The fourth option is to Delete the image.
The fifth option is to Close the menu.

If you plan to upload more images, then you can traverse through all your uploaded 
images by clicking on Browse All.
You can manipulate any image from this panel.
Managing Post Categories
When you make a post, always try to categorize it for better readability. Users 
always like to find articles about their interests. So if you categorize your articles, 
visitors can find them very easily. In this section, we will learn how to create new 
categories, how to post under one or multiple categories, and how to manage 
these categories.
In the posting section, there is a small category management panel in which you can 
name the new category to which the post should belong. There are also different 
administration panels for these categories. First let's create some categories before 
making posts via this category-management panel in the posting section. Take a look 
at the right side of the rich text editor; you will see the following setting panels:

Blogging your Heart Out
[ 104 ]
Click on the + sign after Categories. You will see the category panel instantly 
as follows:
Well, from this panel you can add new categories but cannot delete them. WordPress 
has a different category admin panel. You must use that admin panel to do 
something more with these categories. For now, let's create new categories titled 
PHP and Programming. Soon we will post our articles under these categories.
In the text box, type these two categories together separated by a comma and click 
on the Add button. You will see those categories added instantly and checked by 
default. When a category remains checked, the post belongs to that category.
For now, we will uncheck the Uncategorized category. Let us make a small post and 
see the output.

Chapter 4
[ 105 ]
Take a look at the bottom of this post. It displays the categories under which this 
article has been posted. Notice the PHP and Programming Language categories 
there. If you have many posts under one category, then clicking on that category will 
display all the posts under that specific category. Another noticeable thing here is 
that since you are logged in as admin, there is an Edit link available to you. If you 
click on this link, you can edit this post instantly. Other general users will not get this 
Edit link.
You can make a post under as many categories as you want. However, always try 
to be precise. Don't use too many categories for a single post as that may extremely 
bother your viewers.
Let us manage categories via the category admin panel. Click on the Manage link on 
the main menu bar and then click on Categories on the sub-menu bar.

Blogging your Heart Out
[ 106 ]
Here you see a set of tools and a list of all your categories. You can also see how 
many posts are there in each category and you can even edit or delete them. In 
the lower section of this page, there is a detailed panel for adding categories. Here 
Name is the title of the category. Through the Category Parent field, you can specify 
whether the new category is a sub-category of a previously created category, or is an 
independent category. You can also write some description of this category, which 
will be visible when someone moves the mouse cursor over this category. If you 
want to place a category as a child of an existing one, just select the parent category 
from the drop-down box of the Category Parent field.
If a post belongs to only one category and you delete that category, then the post will 
go by default to the Uncategorized category.
Managing Existing Posts
We have already seen that when you are logged in as Admin, you can see the Edit 
link just below the article that was posted by you. You can directly edit your post 
from there. There are separate admin panels for managing your posts. To start 

Chapter 4
[ 107 ]
managing your posts, just click on the Manage button from the menu bar and then 
click on Post from the sub-menu bar.
You can view, edit, and delete any post from this panel. If you have a lot of posts, 
then you can select the month from the Browse Month drop-down box and select the 
posts made in that month only. This will help you find specific posts easily.
The admin panel also helps you to find comments made under any post. You can 
then read and modify them. We will discuss this option later in this chapter.
Protecting Posts with a Password
In the settings panel, there are password protection settings. With help of this panel, 
you can protect your posts with a password. Someone can only view your post if he 
or she knows your password. Let us take a look at the password settings panel:
You can access password protection settings while composing a new post or from the 
post management panel. From the Manage menu, click on Post. To protect your post, 
just type a password and click on the save button under the rich text editor. Let us 
take a look at a protected post.

To see this post, just enter the password and hit Submit.
Trackbacks
When someone in another blog makes a post on some specific topic and you also 
want to make a post in your blog using that remote post as a reference, you can use 
trackbacks. Trackback is a process of pinging a blog and telling it that you referred to 
a post of that blog in your personal blog. If the trackback is successful, a link to your 
blog post will be displayed as a comment in that remote post. The trackbacked blog 
engine will crawl through your post and make a link available to its index.
There are some popular pinging services available on the Internet, which index 
millions of blogs everyday and archive their content so that users can search through 
these contents and go to that appropriate blog post. To name a few, we have 
Technorati (http://www.technorati.com), Weblogs (http://www.weblogs.com), 
Feedburner (http://feedburner.com), and Feedster (http://feedster.com) 
among others.
These indexing services are so popular and powerful that they index millions of 
blogs everyday. However, these crawlers crawl at a regular time interval. So if you 
make a post today and the crawlers crawl to your blog after two weeks, people will 
get your post in these indexing services two weeks after your making that post, 
which is often quite bothering. For this reason, these indexing services expose some 
trackback URLs to which these crawlers are listening. If someone 'knocks' or 'pings' 
with an URL, these crawlers immediately crawl to that page and index that post.
An automated pinging mechanism will ping these trackbacks instantly when you 
make a post. This will increase your site ranking by making your post visible to all 
the people who are searching. Technorati is a popular indexing service. It provides 
trackbacks, that you can use for automatic pinging. Let us see the process.
Firstly, go to http://www.technorati.com and look at the lower section of the page 
to find the Ping Us link.

Chapter 4
[ 109 ]
Clicking on this link you will reach the following page:
Now all you have to do is submit the URL of your blog. The Technorati crawler is 
familiar with different types of blog engines like WordPress, MT, Blogger, and so on. 
It will instantly index your site and list the new updates.
Another thing that you can do is, whenever you make a post, just enter the Technorati 
ping URL http://rpc.technorati.com/rpc/ping in the lower portion of your post 
page, which is called Trackbacks. Take a look at the following screenshot:
If you paste this trackback link in the trackback section, then after submitting the 
post WordPress will ping Technorati.
However, doing these things manually every time is a hassle. So let us make it 
automatic so that whenever you make a post, WordPress will ping Technorati. For 
that purpose log into your admin panel, click on the Options tab, and then click 
on Writing.
On the lower portion of this page, you will find a section titled Update Service. 
You may see something like http://rpc.pingomatic.com/ available there. 
Ping-O-Matic is a relay ping service that pings many other pinging services 
automatically. So when you ping Ping-O-Matic, it will do the rest of the job for you.

Blogging your Heart Out
[ 110 ]
Let us add the Technorati ping URL http://rpc.technorati.com/rpc/ping here. 
Technorati is a very popular blog‑indexing service and if you have your blog listed 
here, you can expect better page ranking for sure. On the other hand, Ping-O-Matic is 
a central pinging service that itself pings many other popular services. You just need 
to add this address in a new line and save it. Your Update Service section should 
look like the following screenshot:
After updating this setting, WordPress will automatically start pinging Technorati 
and will help to increase your site ranking.
You can also ping other blogs via the available trackback URL under each blog 
post. However, since it could be misused as a spamming tool, there are plug-ins 
available to stop trackback spam. One of the most popular ones is Akismet. Akismet 
is available in both free and commercial editions. To use Akismet, you must have an 
Akismet 'key' that is available by registering for a free account in WordPress.com.
If you are not sure where to find your Akismet key, create an account in WordPress.
com and the API key will be mailed to you when your registration is successful. 
However, you can actually retrieve it anytime by clicking on the My Profile link in 
the top right corner of your WordPress administration panel. To get your API key, 
click on that link and you will find your key on the right side. To enable Akismet, 
you must copy that key and go to the Plugin section. After activating the plug-in, it 
will prompt you for activating Akismet by entering the API key. You can also go to 
this activation page from this URL:
http://your_wordpress_blog/wp-admin/plugins.php?page=akismet\
akismet.php
Now paste the key that you copied from your profile page and click on Save. 
That's it!
Here is a comprehensive list of major ping services. You may try with these for 
better results:

Other Useful Settings
While posting, there are some other useful settings available to you. The most 
important among them is the ability to save a post for later use. You can save a post 
as a draft from the Post Status panel. We have already discussed a little about this 
panel at the beginning of this chapter. For now, let us take a look at this panel:
To save any post as a draft, just select the Draft option and click on Save. You may 
wonder how to get access to these drafts that you had saved earlier. Well, when you 
log in and come to this Post page, you will get all your available drafts at the top of this 
page. You can also get access to the available drafts by clicking on the Manage menu 
and then the Post sub-menu. Take a look at how these drafts are available to you:
To edit a draft, just click on it. To publish a draft, click on it and when it is available 
in the editing mode, click on the Publish button just under the rich text editor.
From the settings panel, you can also manually change the time of your post from 
the Post Timestamp panel. This panel looks like the following:

Blogging your Heart Out
[ 112 ]
You can select the date and time from here. These settings will override the actual 
posting date and time for this post.
Posting by Email
Besides the regular style of posting, WordPress also supports different ways of doing 
this job. For example, you can make posts by mailing to a specific account. This is 
possible if you set up an email account and make it available to WordPress. For 
posting by email, let us follow these steps.
Click on the Options menu and then Writing from the sub-menu.
At the bottom of this page, there is a section titled Writing by e-mail. You have to 
configure some settings before you can start posting by email.
In this section, you have to provide the Mail server, Login name (usually, that is 
your full email address), and the Password. Finally, select the category to which 
these posts should go. That's it, you are done!

Chapter 4
[ 113 ]
Remember that whatever you send to this email address, 
it will be posted to your blog. So don't use your frequently 
used email address or your public email address. Set up a 
private (and very private) email address for this purpose. 
Name the email address quite cryptically. WordPress helps 
you by providing some cryptic names; look at the portions 
outlined in the preceding screenshot.
When you send an email, you must tell WordPress that "I have sent an email, so go 
and fetch it, and then post it"; otherwise, WordPress will not know about your email. 
So immediately after sending an email to this address, access the following URL 
http://your_blog_address/wp-mail.php using your browser. Then WordPress 
will connect to this email address, fetch the email, and then post it automatically.
If you want to automate this task, you can run this URL automatically via a cron job. 
In Linux, just set the cron command as php full/path/to/the/wp-mail.php. Then 
it will automatically run the script at regular intervals and fetch the emails.
To set up cron jobs, you can access Cron Jobs in cPanel. 
If you have shell access, you can access it by invoking the 
crontab –e command.
For your information, the subject of your email will be considered as the title of the 
post and the body will be considered as the content. The basic HTML tags will be 
stripped out.
Other Ways of Posting
There are several other ways of posting in your WordPress blog. WordPress and other 
standard-compliant blogs implement some standard APIs to complete some specific 
tasks. There are three popular standard APIs available for blog engines; they are 
MovableType, MetaWeblog, and Blogger API. If any blog engine implements these 
APIs, then using standard interfaces, any remote program will be able to manipulate 
blogs by editing posts, retrieving posts, and so forth under a proper authentication 
scheme. There are many standard-compliant desktop editors available, which will 
help you to post on your blog. With these editors you can work faster.
WordPress XML-RPC server implements the following methods:
system.multicall
system.listMethods

If you don't understand how these methods work, let's see the following 
example. For this, you need some basic knowledge about XML-RPC with PHP. 
To make the following code work, download the PHP XML-RPC package from 
http://phpxmlrpc.sourceforge.net/. Then extract all files from this archive and 
copy them from the lib folder to the directory where you place the following script:
<?php
  include("xmlrpc.inc");
  $c = new xmlrpc_client("/xmlrpc.php", "hasin.wordpress.com", 80);
  $content['title']="XMLRPC Post";
  $content['description']="Some content posted using MetaWeblog API";
  $content['categories'] = array("frontpage");
  $x = new xmlrpcmsg("metaWeblog.newPost",
                      array(php_xmlrpc_encode("1"),
                      php_xmlrpc_encode("admin"),
                      php_xmlrpc_encode("root"),
                      php_xmlrpc_encode($content),
                      php_xmlrpc_encode("1")));
  $c->return_type = 'phpvals'; 
  $r =$c->send($x);
  if ($r->errno=="0")
  echo "Successfully Posted";
  else {
    echo "There is some error";
    echo "<pre>";
    print_r($r);
    echo "</pre>";
?>
Save this file as blogapi.php in any web server (even in your localhost) and browse 
this page from your browser. After executing this script, log into your WordPress panel 
and check that there is a new post titled XMLRPC Post under the frontpage category.
You can play with the other methods as well.

[ 116 ]
Bookmarklet
Bookmarklet is another interesting feature available with WordPress that enables 
you to post while you are visiting any page and want to make a quick post with 
reference to that page. For example, you are browsing an interesting web page under 
the Packt Publishing website whose URL is http://packtpub.com/smarty/book 
and its title is Smarty PHP Template Programming. Now you want to make a new 
post in your blog with a link to this page. Bookmarklet helps you to do this with the 
help of a toolbar button.
To enable WordPress bookmarklet in your browser, just log into the admin panel. 
After clicking on the Writing panel, scroll down to the bottom and you will find 
something as follows:
Please notice that there is a link called Press it – The Storyteller, where The 
Storyteller is my blog title. So all you have to do is drag this link to your 
bookmarklet toolbar. You will see a new button added in the toolbar instantly.
Now when you visit any website and want to post about it, just hit this button and 
see that the link and the title of that web page is included in your blog post. Take a 
look at the following screenshot. While visiting the Packt Publishing website, I just 
hit the button and the screenshot tells the rest.

Chapter 4
[ 117 ]
So you see that after pressing the bookmarklet button, you are redirected to your 
WordPress posting panel with a link to that page; this is just like inserting a link.
For those who are interested to know the JavaScript code of that bookmarklet button, 
right-click over it and you will find it. The code is as follows:
javascript:
if(navigator.userAgent.indexOf('Safari') >= 0)
{
  Q=getSelection();
}
else
{
  Q=document.selection?document.selection.createRange().
  text:document.getSelection();
}
  location.href='https://hasin.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php?te
xt='+encodeURIComponent(Q)+'&popupurl='+encodeURIComponent(location.
href)+'&popuptitle='+encodeURIComponent(document.title);
Comments in Detail
Comments are a very important part of your blog. User comments always inspire 
you and give you feedback about your post. However, comments could be misused 
as a tool for spamming and advertising, which is bothering every blogger. So you 
must have some knowledge on how to make your blog free from comment spam and 
make it function smoothly.
How to Make a Comment
If you visit a post, you will notice the No Comments or # Comments (where # is the 
total number of comments posted) links just below the post. To make a comment, 
you can just click on it and go ahead. However, you may not get a comment-writing 
section all the time, especially if the author of a post disables comments.
If you are logged in as a user of this blog, you can see your name by default as the 
name of the commenter. However, if you are an outsider, you will see the following 
section while making comments:

Blogging your Heart Out
[ 118 ]
As you can see, your name and email address are required and your website is 
optional. However, when you post comment as an outsider (or even as a user 
sometimes) your comment may not be visible instantly after posting. If the author 
wants to moderate the comments first, it will be queued to the comment moderation 
list. It will be displayed after the administrator approves it.
Comment Settings
By default, comments are allowed to publish instantly. However, to prevent spam 
or to avoid blacklisted comments, we should turn on moderation. Let us see how we 
can turn on moderation of comments.
Log into the WordPress admin panel, select the Options menu, and then click on the 
Discussion sub-menu.

Chapter 4
[ 119 ]
There are different settings for comment administration. The sixth checkbox from the 
top, which is labeled An administrator must approve the comment (regardless of 
any matches below) is the point we are looking for. If you check this checkbox and 
save, all comments will be queued for moderation. Let us check it and save.
Now when outsiders post comments in your blog, they will wait for approval. To 
test it, log out from your admin panel and make a comment on any of your posts.
Let us get familiar with the other options in this page.
Attempt to notify any Weblogs linked to from the article (slows down posting.) 
indicates that when you make a post, if that post contains hyperlinks, WordPress will 
try to ping those links. This is to increase the page ranking of your blog. Allowing 
this one is good for your blog, but it may slow down the posting process a bit as 
stated. However, it is recommended to keep it checked.
Allow link notifications from other Weblogs (pingbacks and trackbacks.) means 
that anyone can trackback to your posts and their links will be visible as trackbacks 
under your posts, as comments. This is also good for increasing the page ranking 
because it generates an outgoing link to someone else's site; a sort of link exchange. 
However, this will also increase the tendency of link spam. Bad people can make 
trackbacks to publish their link on your site, which will act as an advertisement for 
their site and increase traffic to their site.

Blogging your Heart Out
[ 120 ]
Allow people to post comments on the article means whether people can comment 
on your posts or not. If you uncheck it, the comment option will not be available to 
anyone; not good for your blog.
E-mail me when anyone posts a comment means WordPress will mail you when 
someone makes a comment in your blog and that comment is not considered as a 
spam or is held for moderation. If you turn this on, you will get notification instantly 
when comments are made. However, if you get huge numbers of comments, this 
may flood your inbox with lots of notifications everyday.
E-mail me when a comment is held for moderation means when someone makes 
a comment and that comment is queued for moderation, WordPress will mail you 
instantly. This setting is quite useful if you enable comment moderation so that you 
get instant notification and take necessary steps. Please remember that enabling 
this option as well as the previous one will send you only one mail when a spam is 
posted, because it already fulfills the first criterion.
Comment author must fill out name and e-mail means what it states. While 
commenting, name and email fields are mandatory, if you turn this on.
Comment author must have a previously approved comment means if you turn on 
this setting, comments will not be displayed until the same poster has one approved 
comment already. However, this setting is not so helpful. If you don't moderate 
comments, this setting may come handy.
Well, that's it. Let us now start moderating comments.
Comment Moderation
To moderate queued comments, just log into your WordPress admin panel and click 
on the Manage menu and then Posts. If you have comments awaiting moderation, 
you will see something like this:
Taking a closer look at the screenshot, you will see that there is a sub-menu stating 
that a comment is waiting for moderation. Click on the Awaiting Moderation (1) 
sub-menu. You will see the following screen:

Chapter 4
[ 121 ]
You see that someone named An Outsider posted a comment in your blog. If you 
want to know under which post he or she made this comment, click on the View 
Post link just below the comment. If you want to allow this comment, click on 
Approve and then click on the Moderate Comments button. If you feel that you 
need to edit something in this comment, click on the Edit link and you can edit it.
There are four choices for this comment. You can Approve it for display. You can 
mark this comment as Spam so that WordPress understands that these sort of 
comments will be marked as spam in future. You can straight Delete it. Finally, if 
you are not sure what to do with this comment, keep it in the moderation queue for 
later review by clicking Defer until later.
If you have more than one comment, then approving one after another may consume 
too much time. So there are options for bulk action. On the lower section of this page, 
there are four links titled Mark all for approval, Mark all as spam, Mark all for 
deletion, and Mark all for later. If you click on any one of them, all the comments 
awaiting moderation and visible in this page will be checked in that category. This 
will save some time and avoid repetitive task.
Fighting with Comment Spams
You have already got an idea how people can misuse some very useful features of a 
blog engine, like trackbacks and comments, for advertising purposes and spamming. 
So all you have to do is start fighting with spams. No doubt, it's very tough to make 
some automated programs or routines that can detect something as spam because 

Blogging your Heart Out
[ 122 ]
spams don't always fall into a specific category. Moreover, spammers are also clever. 
They are using new techniques, patterns, and styles for spamming. So it's really 
tough to automate the process of anti-spamming.
However, all you can do is help the inner anti-spam procedure of WordPress 
by providing some specific keywords that are generally marked as spam. If you 
supply these words to WordPress, comments will be marked as spam when they 
contain any of these words. You have two choices; you can either delete these spams 
automatically or hold them in the moderation queue for manual checkup.
Let us learn how you can supply these words for WordPress. Go to the Options 
menu and then the discussion sub-menu.
Firstly, you will see a section titled Comment Moderation. In this section, you can 
insert suspicious words. If any of these words is found in a comment, WordPress 
will hold it in the moderation queue, even if you turn on public commenting. There 
is also another marker to suspect a comment as spam. A comment spam always 
contains a link, sometimes more than one. In the comment moderation section, 
there is a box that also detects a comment as spam if a comment contains more than 
2 hyperlinks. You can set this number to any valid number. For example, you can 
queue all comments that contain even one hyperlink.

Chapter 4
[ 123 ]
Further down, there is another section titled Comment Blacklist. If you insert some 
words and WordPress finds any of those words in any comment, then WordPress 
will delete that comment immediately. Those comments will not be queued even for 
moderation. So be sure before inserting any words here. Partial words can match 
here. For example, if you indicate blackjack as a blacklisted word and insert only 
black in the comment, then all comments containing the word black (black is a 
common word and there may be many non-spam comments with this word) will be 
deleted. Moreover, if the word black is part of a word like "blackbox", it will also get 
deleted. So always be sure before inserting a word in this box.
There is also a checkbox Blacklist comments from open and insecure proxies at the 
lower portion in this page. Comment spams are relayed by open proxies to avoid 
IP bans. WordPress has an internal list of these open proxies. So if you turn this 
checkbox on, it will delete any comment made from those blacklisted proxies as well.
Gravatar
When someone makes a comment in your posts, you can see only his or her name. 
Any person posting comments using your email address must be you. So in 
whichever blog you make comments using an email address that belongs to you, it 
indicates that the person who made those comments is you. So an email address is a 
unique ID of a person.
When someone makes a comment in WordPress, by default you can only see his or 
her name and email address. It will be more pleasing if you can see his or her avatar 
in this comment. An avatar is a small image chosen by someone as his or her picture. 
It may be an image of anything. However, usually a person uses as an avatar a 
picture that he or she thinks best represents himself or herself.
Gravatars came from this idea. Gravatar means "Globally Recognized Avatar". 
www.gravatar.com is mainly a site that hosts your avatar as a URL from its site. You 
can upload your avatars into the gravatar website and get an ID against your email 
account. You can change your avatar anytime. You can also rate your gravatar for 
different audiences like "G" or "R" as suitable to all.
When someone who has an account in gravatar against his/her email address makes 
a comment in a blog, the blog engine searches the gravatar repository with his or 
her email address and finds the avatar. Then that blog engine displays the avatar (or 
gravatar) in every comment he or she has made in the blog.
This is a fantastic feature for every blog engine. Gravatars are known worldwide and 
almost all the big blog engines have the capability to include this feature. From the 
gravatar site, there are plug-ins available to add this feature to different blog engines. 
There is also a plug-in for adding this feature to WordPress.

Blogging your Heart Out
[ 124 ]
Summary
The key features of a blog are posts and comments. In this chapter, we learned all 
about posts and comments. We also learned how to increase the blog rating by using 
trackbacks. Besides this, we have seen how to fight with comment spammers and 
comment flooders. We will learn the details about templates, plug-ins, and some core 
coding parts of WordPress in the upcoming chapters. Till then, happy blogging!

Non-Blog Content
WordPress is a powerful content management system, which you can use for 
building general websites for your organization. A typical website consists of several 
pages and sometimes some special services like payment processing, RSS, forums, 
shoutbox, etc. In WordPress, you can do almost everything with the help of several 
plug-ins. You can also develop a general-purpose website by developing pages, 
which are basically considered as non-blog content. Before developing a site for your 
company or product, you may need to plan the site structure; otherwise, the site may 
look quite messy.
In this chapter, we are going to develop a general website that serves as a showcase for 
a production company. As a sample, we will develop a website for Packt Publishing, 
where it will display its books for sale and accept feedback from readers. Let's decide 
the goal of this site, and then we will proceed towards the site structure.
Goals and Site Structure
We are going to design a website for a publishing company. These sites have some 
specific goals to fulfill. For example, in our site we will be delivering the following 
content. However, in real life, a publishing site must also have payment-processing 
options besides these listed options:
About page
Homepage, where visitors get the latest news
Books page
Search box
A page for authors
Navigation panel
Top-ranked book list
An image gallery
•

Non-Blog Content
[ 126 ]
Our site has a front page where we will display our latest events. From this page, 
users will be able to navigate to the book gallery. They can also visit our top-ranked 
books, where we rank our books based on the hit counts. There must be a page that 
describes our company, and a page for authors to help them kick-start writing their 
book with our company.
In our book gallery page, visitors will be able to search books on different criteria. 
For example, they can sort them by the date of publishing, topics, alphabetically, or 
by price. From this page, they can click over any book for a detailed description.
A search option must be present so that users can search for books on any topic. 
They must be able to search by author name, book title, or any specific keyword.
A list of top-ranked books must be present in our front page. You may wonder how 
we calculate the top-ranked books. For the sake of simplicity, we will calculate the 
top-ranked books by counting the number of times they have been visited. As each 
book has its own page (to count hits), we will be able to achieve this functionality. 
However, in real life there may be several other measures on which the book rank 
is calculated; for example, the quantity of sales, quantity of positive feedbacks, and 
quantity of reviews. Among these, hit count is also a reliable process. If people are 
not interested in your book, definitely your book will receive a relatively lower count 
of hits compared to other books.
In the front page, we will also provide links to some sites that we think should be 
displayed there. A calendar must also be present for easier navigation by displaying 
daily or weekly posts as links in it, so that you can easily find them.
Getting Started
The only way we can create a new book entry is making a post. Then we can sort 
books according to different criteria.
Making the Site
Now it's time to find a suitable theme for our site. Green Marine always delivers a 
nice look and feel to your site; so let us try with Green Marine for the time being. We 
need to modify the functionality of this theme to meet our requirements. There will 
be small changes that you will have to make and you don't need to be a PHP coder 
for that.
Our first task is to add some pages where we need less modification. We will add the 
front page, the about us page, and the author page. Keep in mind that our front page 
will be a regular WordPress page that excludes the post, which will display only 
some specific content that we want to display on the front page.

Chapter 5
[ 127 ]
In general, all posts come to the front page instantly. However, in our site we are 
planning to display only some specific posts. There is no built-in option for this 
purpose, so we need to modify our theme. These are very small modifications and 
you don't need to be a regular PHP developer for that.
Step 1: Create a Special Category
From the previous chapter, you have learned how to create categories and how 
to make some post under a category. To solve our problem, we need to create a 
category that we will use only for some selected posts to be displayed on the front 
page. Let us create a category frontpage in our blog. You can follow these steps for 
creating a category:
Log into the WordPress administration panel.
Click on the Manage menu, and select Categories.
Scroll down to the Add New Category section.
Give the category name as frontpage and click on Add Category. Please note 
that it is a top category with no parent. You may add an optional description 
for each and every category.
Step 2: Make Some Posts under this Category
After creating the category frontpage, add some posts and select frontpage as their 
category from the right-hand side of the post section. Please be sure that your post 
belongs to this category only.
Now it's time to add some general posts. For this, create another category book and 
make some posts under that book category.

Non-Blog Content
[ 128 ]
If you look at your blog, you will find all the posts from all categories displayed on 
the front page. However, according to our requirement we will display only specific 
posts under the frontpage category. So we need to modify our theme a bit and tell 
WordPress to collect those posts only.
If you look at the preceding screenshot, you will find that posts from all the 
categories (here book and frontpage) are displayed on the index page.
Step 3: Modify Main Index Template of the Theme
Using any FTP client or the built-in Theme Editor, open the index.php page of your 
theme for editing. As we are using Green Marine, you will find this file in the path 
wp-content/themes/greenmarine/index.php.

Chapter 5
[ 129 ]
If you are not sure about the Theme Editor, it's accessible 
as a sub menu under the Presentation menu. From the 
Theme Editor, you will find a list of files in the current 
selected theme that are editable from here, but they must 
have write permission.
Add the following line just before the <?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_
posts()) : the_post(); ?> line:
<?php if (is_home())
{
  query_posts("category_name='frontpage'");
}
?>
The code means that if this is the front page, we will display posts from the category 
frontpage only. So the first ten lines of this file will look like this:
<?php get_header(); ?>
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>

Non-Blog Content
[ 130 ]
<hr />
<div id="content">
<? if (is_home())
{
  query_posts("category_name='frontpage'");
}
?>
<?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
Save this file and refresh the front page of your blog. You will find that all the posts 
are gone except those categorized as frontpage.
We are now seeing posts only from the frontpage category, which was a pretty 
easy task.
Step 4: Turn off Commenting on Front Page Posts
As it is a site for a publishing firm, we may not want to display public comments 
on the front page posts or allow commenting on the posts that we are displaying on 
the front page. Therefore, to turn off commenting for these posts, just open the posts 

Chapter 5
[ 131 ]
for editing and turn off commenting by unchecking the checkbox Allow Comments 
from the right side, under the Discussion panel.
If you refresh the front page and click on any of the posts, you will find them 
displaying Comments are closed. However, the link 0 Comments is still present on 
the front page. Now it's time to remove that link from the front page.
Open the index.php file using any editor and search for the following code block:
  <div class="comments">
    <?php wp_link_pages(); ?>
    <?php comments_popup_link(__('<strong>0</strong> Comments'), __
('<strong>1</strong> Comment'), __('<strong>%</strong> Comments')); ?>
  </div>
We need to tell WordPress that if it is the home page, then don't display the link. So 
add a small logic test before this code block and modify it like this:
<? if (single_cat_title("",false)!="frontpage"):?>
  <div class="comments">
    <?php wp_link_pages(); ?>
    <?php comments_popup_link(__('<strong>0</strong> Comments'), __
('<strong>1</strong> Comment'), __('<strong>%</strong> Comments')); ?>
  </div>
<? endif; ?>
The line single_cat_title("",false) returns the category name of the current 
post. So we simply checked that the current category is not frontpage; if not we 
still display the number of comments, using the function comments_popup_link; 
otherwise the link is skipped.

Non-Blog Content
[ 132 ]
Step 5: Populate Some Data
Now it's time to add some data to our database. As our website is a general-purpose 
website for publishers, we must have some books. We have to categorize each book 
in different book categories. In our sample website, we have four categories. Before 
populating data, let's create these four categories from the administration panel. 
We will make every book entry as a regular post, but they must belong to 
appropriate categories.
Open-source
Java
PHP
Content Management System
Don't worry about the display of these posts. They will not appear in the front page, 
since we are displaying only some specific posts on our front page.
Step 6: Create Category Pages
Now we have to create some category pages. If our visitor clicks on any category, 
they will see just the titles of the books. When they click on the title of one of these 
books, they can see the details about that particular book.
•

Chapter 5
[ 133 ]
So we have to modify our theme again. Let us open the index.php file inside our 
theme, i.e. in the Green Marine folder, and modify it as shown in the following 
code segment:
<?if (is_category()) $cat=true;?>
<?php get_header(); ?>
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
<hr />
<div id="content">
<?php if (is_home())
{
  query_posts("category_name='frontpage'");
        $homepage= true;
}
?>
<?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
  <?php // Post dates off by default the_date('','<h2>','</h2>'); ?>
  <div id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>">
  <h2><a href="<?php the_permalink() ?>" rel="bookmark">
  <?php the_title(); ?></a></h2>
<? if(!$cat):?>
  <div class="meta">
  <?php _e("Posted in"); ?> <?php the_category(',') ?>
  by <?php the_author() ?> on the <?php the_time('F jS, Y') ?>
  <?php edit_post_link(__('Edit This')); ?></div>
  <div class="main">
    <?php the_content(__('(more...)')); ?>
  </div>
<?endif;?>
  </div>
<? if (single_cat_title("",false)!="frontpage"):?>
<? if(!$cat):?>
<div class="comments">
    <?php wp_link_pages(); ?>
    <?php comments_popup_link(__('<strong>0</strong> Comments'), __
('<strong>1</strong> Comment'), __('<strong>%</strong> Comments')); ?>
  </div>
<? endif;?>
<? endif; ?>
<?php comments_template(); ?>

Non-Blog Content
[ 134 ]
<?php endwhile; else: ?>
<div class="warning">
  <p><?php _e('Sorry, no posts matched your criteria, please try and 
search again.'); ?></p>
</div>
<?php endif; ?>
<?php posts_nav_link(' &#8212; ', __('&laquo; Previous Page'), __
('Next Page &raquo;')); ?>
  </div>
<!-- End float clearing -->
</div>
<!-- End content -->
<?php get_footer(); ?>
If you look at the preceding code, you will find the modified code highlighted. At the 
top‑most line, we just check whether the page is a category page. If so, we initialize 
a variable as true. We did this at the top of the page because the is_category() 
function always returns true inside a WordPress 'post' loop; so we must check 
it outside the loop. After that we skipped displaying the details of the post, if it 
is a category page. Finally, we hid the pop-up comment link. Now if you visit a 
particular category, you will see the following screen:
This is the typical look of a category where we display only the titles of the books. 
Each of these links is clickable and will navigate to the book's details when clicked.

Chapter 5
[ 135 ]
You may not find the layout of the screen satisfactory. However, you can display it 
any way you want; you just have to know some CSS coding and that's all. You can 
do the rest. For the sake of simplicity, I skipped that part in this book.
Step 7: Add Some Description to Each Category 
Page
We will now add some description at the top of each category page. For example, 
when people click on the Open-Source category, they will see a detailed description 
of this category and what type of books are covered here. After that description, we 
will display our regular listing of books. Each category page must show its unique 
description. Let us take a look at the following screenshot:
The preceding page is displayed when someone clicks on the Open-Source category. 
Let us take a look at another category page:

Non-Blog Content
[ 136 ]
This is the CMS category. Please note that these two category pages each display 
their own description at the top of the page.
To achieve this functionality, we must add some description to each category from 
the administration panel. Let us log into the admin panel and select the Manage 
menu. Now click on the Categories sub-menu. You will find every category in your 
WordPress blog listed in this category management panel. Beside each category 
there is an Edit link. Click on that link and you will find the page where you can add 
a description for them.

Chapter 5
[ 137 ]
After adding some description, save it by clicking on the Edit Category button.
Now we have to modify our theme so that we can display these descriptions at the 
top of each category page. We first have to extract the description of the current 
category. Unfortunately, there is no built-in function in WordPress to do that. 
However, we can make use of some other functions. Firstly, we have to extract the 
current category name. We can do that using the single_cat_title() function. 
After that we must retrieve the current category object from which we can get the 
category description. Let's take a look at the code of the index.php file in our theme:
<?if (is_category()) $cat=true;?>
<?php  get_header(); ?>
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
<hr />
<div id="content">
<?php if (is_home())
{
  query_posts("category_name='frontpage'");
        $homepage= true;
}
?>
<?
$catobj=get_category(get_cat_ID(single_cat_title('',false)));
echo $catobj->category_description;
?>
<?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
  <?php // Post dates off by default the_date('','<h2>','</h2>'); ?>
  <div id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>">
  <h2><a href="<?php the_permalink() ?>" rel="bookmark">
  <?php the_title(); ?></a></h2>
<? if(!$cat):?>
  <div class="meta">
  <?php _e("Posted in"); ?> <?php the_category(',') ?> by 
  <?php the_author() ?> on the <?php the_time('F jS, Y') ?> 
  <?php edit_post_link(__('Edit This')); ?></div>
  <div class="main">
    <?php the_content(__('(more...)')); ?>
  </div>
<?endif;?>
  </div>
<? if (single_cat_title("",false)!="frontpage"):?>

Non-Blog Content
[ 138 ]
<? if(!$cat):?>
<div class="comments">
    <?php wp_link_pages(); ?>
    <?php comments_popup_link(__('<strong>0</strong> Comments'), __
('<strong>1</strong> Comment'), __('<strong>%</strong> Comments')); ?>
  </div>
<? endif;?>
<? endif; ?>
<?php comments_template(); ?>
<?php endwhile; else: ?>
<div class="warning">
  <p><?php _e('Sorry, no posts matched your criteria, please try and 
search again.'); ?>
  </p>
</div>
<?php endif; ?>
<?php posts_nav_link(' &#8212; ', __('&laquo; Previous Page'), __
('Next Page &raquo;')); ?>
  </div>
<!-- End float clearing -->
</div>
<!-- End content -->
<?php get_footer(); ?>
If you take a look at the preceding highlighted code, you will find that we used three 
functions, namely single_cat_title(), get_cat_ID(), and get_category(). The 
get_cat_id() function returns the ID of a category when the name of that category 
is supplied to this function as a parameter, and the get_category() function returns 
a category object when the category ID is passed as a parameter to it. When the 
following line of code executes, we get a category object in the $catObj variable:
$catobj=get_category(get_cat_ID(single_cat_title('',false)));
Now we will just access its description property and display it:
echo $catobj->category_description;
That's it! Notice how we can achieve some great functionality with just a few lines 
of code.

Chapter 5
[ 139 ]
Step 8: An All Books Section
Well, now we need to display all the books in one single page despite their parent 
category. That is, whether a book belongs to the Java category or the open-source 
category, they must all show up in the All Books page.
We have to first create a category named All Books from the Category section. Then 
we can proceed further with the other tasks.
Next, we just have to modify all our book posts and add the category that we created 
earlier as All Books. That is, a book that belongs to the PHP category or whatever 
other category, must also belong to this All Books category.
For this, just log into the admin panel and then select the Manage menu. Create a 
category called All Books from the Category sub-menu. Now click on the Posts 
sub-menu and edit each post to add the All Books category to it from the right-hand 
side category pane. From now on, for every book that you will add, add a parent 
category under which that book should display and of course this All Books category.
Now we have all our books displayed on one single page. Simple tricks save a lot 
of time. When you are not very familiar with the internals of WordPress, you may 
be scared to do a lot of coding for simple tasks. However, in real life WordPress is 

Non-Blog Content
[ 140 ]
so flexible and extensible that you can do almost everything with this amazing 
blog engine.
Step 9: Customize the Categories
Now it's time to decorate our Category menu so that it shows only the necessary 
categories and no extra ones. If we look at our Category menu now, we will find all 
our categories being displayed and creating a total mess. Let us take a look:
That's definitely not the look we want. We want to display only the following 
menus here:
PHP
CMS
Open-Source
Java
All Books
We need to exclude all other unnecessary menus from the list. There are again some 
built-in features that we can make use of. Now we need to modify the sidebar.php 
file inside our theme. If you open the file, you will find that the following segment is 
responsible for displaying the categories in a list.
<h3><?php _e('The Categories'); ?></h3>
<ul>
  <?php wp_list_cats(); ?>
</ul>
•
•
•
•
•

Chapter 5
[ 141 ]
This wp_list_cats() function generates a list from all the available categories and 
returns them in a list. Now we want to exclude some of these categories from being 
displayed. The Wp_list_cats() function supports category exclusion. All we have 
to do is to supply the IDs of the categories that we want to hide as a parameter to this 
function. However, we need to know the category IDs for this.
Now log into the administration panel and choose the Categories sub-menu from 
Manage. You will find a page that looks like the following screenshot:
Here, you find all the categories in our blog. In the left-most column, you will find their 
ID. In the preceding screenshot, we have noted the IDs we want to exclude. Those are 
5, 6, 2, and 1. Now let us edit the wp_list_cats() function in sidebar.php as follows:
<h3><?php _e('The Categories'); ?></h3>
<ul>
  <?php wp_list_cats("exclude=2,5,1,6"); ?>
</ul>
Now refresh your WordPress blog and take a look at the category panel.

Non-Blog Content
[ 142 ]
Now we have excluded all the unnecessary categories from our category panel. 
However, there is still something more to do. If you look at your category panel, you 
will find that the categories are displayed in no specific order. We can show them in 
ascending or descending order. For this we need to modify the preceding code block 
as shown below:
<h3><?php _e('The Categories'); ?></h3>
<ul>
  <?php wp_list_cats("exclude=2,5,1,6&sort_column=name"); ?>
</ul>
Now it is sorted and looks perfect. However, we don't want a title like The 
Categories. Let us make it Book Categories. Just modify the preceding code block 
and replace the The Categories text with Book Categories.
<h3><?php _e('Book Categories'); ?></h3>
<ul>
  <?php wp_list_cats("exclude=2,5,1,6&sort_column=name"); ?>
</ul>

Chapter 5
[ 143 ]
Now it perfectly fits with what we want.
Step 10: Adding the About Us Page and Author 
Page
Now we will add some other static pages as we planned earlier while planning the 
site structure. There will be a page about the company and a page solely for authors. 
Both of these pages are static and they will be displayed as a page, not regular posts. 
Besides these two static pages, we must have an image gallery and a top-ranked 
book list.
Let us add these static pages first. That will not be a big job at all. Just add them as 
pages, and you are done!
Step 11: Top Ranked Book List
This is a slightly tough part of this chapter. To display some books as top-listed 
books we have several options. We may create a manual list by editing the sidebar; 
however, it will not be dynamic at all and is not an acceptable solution. A better 
solution is to create a real top books list by counting the number of views of each 
book and dynamically displaying them. For this purpose, we need to create a plug-in 
on our own. Don't worry, we will keep it simple.
To make this plug-in work properly, we have to store the number of hits in persistent 
storage, that is where we can re-use them. You can use the database for storing them 
and that will be the best solution. However, as we are going for a simple plug-in, we 
will be using a simple text file for this purpose; but remember to use the database 
(either MySQL or SQLite) wherever possible. If you are already familiar with PHP 
coding, you can modify the code to suit any database table instead of a flat file.
Now we will design a plug-in, which adds a one pixel by one pixel image to the 
content of every post dynamically. The image will refer to a PHP file that will act as a 
hit counter after each call. The following code explains this:
<?
/*
Plugin Name: Hit Counter
Plugin URI: Uh.. No URL
Description: A plugin which counts the number of times a post been 
viewed
Author: Hasin Hayder
Version: 1.0 
Author URI: http://hasin.wordpress.com
*/

Non-Blog Content
[ 144 ]
?>
<?
add_filter("the_content","HitCount");
function HitCount($content)
{
  global $id;
  $categories = get_the_category();
  foreach($categories as $category)
  {
    if ($category->cat_name=="All Books")
    return $content."<img style='display:none '  
         src='http://wordpress_url/hitcount.php?id={$id}'>;
  }
  return $content;
?>
Please replace wordpress_url with your WordPress installation URL. Save this file 
as hitcounter.plugin.php and place this file in the /wp-content/plugins folder 
using any FTP client.
Now log into the admin panel and click on the Plugin menu. You will see a list of all 
the available plug-ins. The plug-in (HitCounter) also appears here. From this admin 
panel, you can activate and deactivate any plug-in. However, don't activate the 
HitCounter plug-in. We have something else to do.

Chapter 5
[ 145 ]
Now we need to create another file called hitcount.php in the root directory of our 
WordPress installation.
<?
$id = $_GET['id'];
$unserialized_data = file_get_contents("hits.txt");
  if (empty($unserialized_data))
  {
    $hits = array();
  }
  else 
  {
    $hits = unserialize($unserialized_data);
  }
  //echo "<pre>".print_r($hits, true)."</pre>";
  $hits[$id]=$hits[$id]+1 ;
  $fp=fopen("hits.txt","w");
  flock($fp, LOCK_NB);
  fwrite($fp, serialize($hits));
  flock($fp,LOCK_UN);
  fclose($fp);
?>
We need to do one more thing. Let us create a file called hits.txt in your 
WordPress root directory using an FTP client and change its permission to 665 or 
rw—rw—r——.
Now we need to create a function that generates our top books list. Let us modify 
our hitcounter.plugin.php file as follows:
<?
/*
Plugin Name: Hit Counter
Plugin URI: Uh.. No URL
Description: A plugin which counts the number of times a post been 
viewed
Author: Hasin Hayder
Version: 1.0
Author URI: http://hasin.wordpress.com
*/
?>
<?
add_filter("the_content","HitCount");
function HitCount($content)
{

Non-Blog Content
[ 146 ]
  global $id;
  $categories = get_the_category();
  foreach($categories as $category)
  {
    if ($category->cat_name=="All Books")
    return $content."<img style='display:none ' 
        src='http://localhost/wp/hitcount.php?id={$id}'>";
  }
  return $content;
function GetTopBooks($limit=10)
{
  $top_books = array();
  $unserialized_data = file_get_contents("hits.txt");
  $hits = @unserialize($unserialized_data);
  $limit=$limit>count($hits)?count($hits):$limit;
  $i=0;
  if (is_array($hits))
  {
  arsort($hits, SORT_DESC);
    foreach($hits as $post_id=>$post_hit)
    {
      $i++;
      if ($i>$limit) break;
      //$post_id = $hits[$i];
      $current_post = get_post($post_id);
      $top_books[] = 
      "<li><a href='http://localhost/wp/?p={$post_id}'>".
      $current_post->post_title."<a/></li>";
    }
  }
  return implode($top_books);
}
?>
Now we have a GetTopBooks() function that returns the list of top books in an 
array. We are going to use it in sidebar.php.
So modify sidebar.php as follows. The added portion of code has been highlighted.
<!-- begin sidebar -->
<div id="right">
  <!--
    <div id="author">

This will add the top books list in the sidebar as follows:
As soon as any visitor visits any book, the data will be updated and the list will be 
sorted accordingly.
Step 12: Adding Links of Associates
Now it's time to add some links of our associates. The associates will be 
displayed under a special Associates section. To add a link in our WordPress 
installation, log into the admin panel and select Links. You will see the available 
list of links as shown in the following screenshot:
You can manage all existing links from here. However, to add a new link just select 
the Add Link sub-menu under this menu. You will be redirected to a page where 
you can add new links.

Non-Blog Content
[ 150 ]
As soon as you add a link, it will be visible in the sidebar. You can also add links 
under different categories from the Link Categories menu.
Step 13: Adding an Image Gallery
Now here's another tough part of our project. We need to add an image gallery 
where we will display all cover pages of our books as images. To do this, let us see 
our possible choices:
We can use a plug-in that extracts all images from a specific directory and 
displays them.
We can store our images in any photo organizer (like Flickr) and displaying 
them from that organizer using any compatible plug-in; but we are not going 
to do that when we are deploy our blog in our self-managed hosting.
We can add images as a separate post that will link to each of the individual 
original posts.
In this section, we will see how to implement all these possible solutions. The best 
solution for our problem is the third option. However, in different scenarios the 
other two options would be considered as the best solution. So let's start one by one.
•

Chapter 5
[ 151 ]
Solution 1: Extract Images from a Specific Directory
For this, we need to design a plug-in that extracts all images from any specific 
directory and displays them as a gallery. Moreover, when someone clicks on any 
of those images, it will redirect to its corresponding book post. To accomplish this, 
we need to follow one rule, and that is, we must name each image according to the 
format PostId‑imagetitle.ImageExtension.
Let us now design the plug-in. It will extract all images from the coverpage folder 
inside our WordPress root directory.
<?
/*
Plugin Name: Image Gallery
Plugin URI: Uh.. No URL
Description: A plugin which displays all images under any dir as image 
gallery
Author: Hasin Hayder
Version: 1.0
Author URI: http://hasin.wordpress.com
*/
?>
<?
add_filter("the_content", "ImageGallery");
function ImageGallery($content)
{
  if (strpos($content, "{gallery}")!==false)
  {
    $content = str_replace("{gallery}","",$content );
    $fp = opendir("coverpage");
    $table = "<table cellpadding='5' cellspacing='5'>";
    $i=false;
    while ($dir = readdir($fp)) {
      if (is_file("coverpage/{$dir}"))
      {
        if(false==$i)
        {
          $table .="<tr>";
        }
        $i = !$i;
        $file = split("-",$dir);
        $post_id = $file[0];
        
        $table .="<td>

Non-Blog Content
[ 152 ]
        <a href='http://localhost/wp/?p={$post_id}'>
        <img src=''http://localhost/wp/coverpage/{$dir}'></a></td>";
        if(false==$i)
        {
          $table .="</tr>";
        }
      }
    }
    $table .= "</table>";
  }
  return $content.$table;
}
?>
Now save this file as imagegallery.plugin.php in the wp-contents/plugin 
folder. Next enable the plug-in from the Plugin administration panel.
To see the plug-in in action, create a folder named coverpage in the WordPress 
root directory. Inside the directory, place some image following the exact naming 
convention postid-filename.extension.
Now let us create a new page where you just add the string {gallery}. Please note that 
it is a page and not a regular post, since we are displaying this gallery as a separate 
page in our blog. You can also add some additional text; but {gallery} must be 
present in the content of the text.
That is all! Visit this page in your browser, and you will see the image gallery.

Chapter 5
[ 153 ]
Please note that you must add the string {gallery} wherever you want to display this 
image gallery. The string {gallery} can be added to any post or any page. Whenever 
you add the text {gallery} in the content, it will display the gallery there. It is not 
specific to this page only.
Solution 2: Image from Photo Organizer
There are some interesting plug-ins already available for this purpose. FAlbum does 
its job pretty well, if you are using photos from your existing Flickr account. If you are 
using any other popular image organizer/gallery script like Gallery or Coppermine, 
please take a look at the Codex plug-in directory for appropriate plug-ins.
Solution 3: Creating a Gallery Manually
This is the easiest step among these three solutions. Here all we need to do is to 
create a page where we add every image using the <img> tag or simply using the 
built-in image browser button at the bottom of the Write Page. Before that, we need 
to upload each and every book image with the built-in uploader of WordPress. 
Next, we will add those pictures one by one manually to our page. We can also add 
hyperlinks to these images using the <a> tag or by clicking the link button from the 
toolbar. That's it. Take a look at the following screenshot:

Non-Blog Content
[ 154 ]
Summary
In this chapter, we have learned how to create a complete general-purpose website 
with WordPress. These posts are considered as non-blog content. WordPress 
provides an extremely flexible set of APIs with which you can extend your 
theme and achieve almost every kind of functionality with minimum effort and 
code modification.
If you study the WordPress API from Codex, you will learn how to extend 
WordPress in more depth than discussed here. Moreover, we have two complete 
chapters on how to develop themes and plug-ins from scratch. In those chapters, 
we will discuss WordPress APIs in more details. For now, please review the 
modifications that you have just done in this chapter and try to play with them by 
modifying them according to your requirements.

Feeds and Podcasting
In this chapter, we will introduce you to the new buzzword in the Internet content 
management world. Since its invention in 1990, the World Wide Web has become 
the biggest repository of information. The total amount of information stored in 
servers located in different places on earth is tremendous and we can't even imagine 
it! With this ample information, it is really difficult to find out what is necessary for 
us. The evolution of search engines like Yahoo, Google, and Lycos make it a bit easier 
to locate the information. However, it's really a big job to deliver content to your 
readers and to read the necessary data. To keep yourself up to date with this vast 
amount of information you need an easy way to proceed.
Feeds were developed to address this problem. RSS feeds basically provide 
information about a web-based resource, its URL, its title, a short description, and 
sometimes links to other documents that are relevant to it. In this chapter, we will 
discuss how feeds can change the concept of content delivery, content aggregation, 
and how to stay up-to-date using feeds. Feeds are now so developed that you can 
deliver almost any type of content with them.
What are Feeds All About?
A few years ago you used to receive up-to-date news in your mailbox. You couldn't 
avoid reading those big emails for valuable news. However, these mails were stored 
in the mailbox in such an unstructured and haphazard manner that tracing them for 
later use was really a big job. Most of the time, those mails were considered as one-
time reading. Moreover, searching through mailboxes is sometimes not flexible and 
private business mailboxes are usually not big enough to store these big newsletters.
Yet another way of keeping yourself up to date is just visiting the website and 
checking manually if there is anything recent. However, there is no guarantee that 
you didn't overlook any item. In this process, you have to check the whole site to 
find out what's new.

Feeds and Podcasting
[ 156 ]
Here comes the magic of feeds. Feeds are a short summary of content presented in a 
pre-defined structured way that tells you exactly what is new and up to date. Using 
feed aggregators (software that can read feeds), you can always stay up to date. You 
can even listen to podcasts using your feed aggregator. If you know what is new, you 
will not bother to do a manual search for information. Feeds were invented to deliver 
recent news to visitors and to avoid the boredom of searching for information.
History of Feeds 
Whether it is the discovery of Newton's laws or Einstein's universal energy formula, 
there are always some great stories behind every innovation. To figure out how 
the RSS feeds evolved into the current state, let us take a look at their history. For 
starters, RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication.
Dave Winer of UserLand (http://www.userland.com) is the man mostly 
responsible for the evolution of RSS, the leading format for feeds. First he developed 
a system to deliver news, which he called scriptingNews. Thereafter, Dan Libby 
modified Winer's work to grab news and display it on the Netscape website. 
This time they only displayed a title, a link, and a small description. Due to this 
modification, Netscape users were able to read news aggregated from different 
sources into the Netscape website. If they were interested to read further, they could 
go directly to the original news source through the link provided.
Dan Libby's work was in some ways the first version of RSS. The process was called 
RDF, which stands for Resource Description Format. Using this format, anyone 
could publish the title, description, and link of any web-based resource. Shortly after 
Libby's work on RSS 0.9, he decided to bring about some major structural changes. 
The changed format was designated RSS 0.91.
In 2000, a group of developers created RSS 1.0 based on RDF. This version of RSS was 
a bit complicated with several modules. Developers could now use RSS to describe any 
resource. This version was a feature-rich pack of the original RSS. In the meantime, 
Dave Winer released the new edition of RSS 0.91, which he versioned as 0.92. At 
this time Netscape's original site, for which the RSS was developed, was shut down. 
However, many people had already started using RSS and they preferred to stay with 
the simple version of RSS, which was 0.91, and thus this version became the de facto.
In 2002, a new era began with the release of RSS 2.0. Dave Winer had left UserLand, 
but he was still interested in developing RSS formats. So he delivered this new 
version with some new features like publication date, a unique identifier, and 
support for namespaces.
In 2003, UserLand shifted the copyright of RSS 2.0 to Harvard while Dave Winer 
went to study for a year in Berkman Center for Internet and Society in Harvard. 

Chapter 6
[ 157 ]
During this time, an advisory committee for the evolution of RSS was formed. 
Meanwhile, based on some propositions on existing RSS formats by Sam Ruby, a 
developer in IBM, another feed format was born. The format was first called Echo, 
then Pie, and finally called Atom.
Some versions of RSS are based on RDF, while some are not. RSS 0.9 and 1.0 are 
based on original RDF. The modern RSS news aggregators can read all these formats. 
So you need not worry about which format to use to deliver content. However, the 
simplest RSS format is 0.91, which is better for faster delivery of your content. If you 
really don't want to deliver extended contents like images, audio, and video, then 
use the 0.91 version; otherwise, stay with RSS 2.0.
RSS Formats
We have gone through the history and evolution of the various RSS formats. In this 
section, we will take a short look at the structure of the different popular formats of 
RSS, especially 0.91, 1.0, and 2.0 and we will also take a look at Atom.
RSS 0.91
In RSS 0.91, everything is described under a channel. In a channel, there are several 
items. Every item has its own title, description, and link. A channel also features a 
title, link, and description of the whole RSS content. The following code block shows 
the typical format of RSS 0.91:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rss version="0.91">
<channel>
<title>the title of this feed</title>
<link>a valid URL to this feed</link>
<description>description of this feed</description>
<language>language code, for example en-us</language>
<item>
<title>Title of first item</title>
<link>Url of first item</link>
<description>Short description about this item.</description>
</item>
<item>
<title>Title of second item</title>
<link>Url of second item</link>
<description>Short description about this item.</description>
</item>
</channel>
</rss>

Feed Readers
After learning about feeds, you may wonder how these feeds are used or consumed 
by people in real life. Well, there are both web-based feed aggregators and desktop 
applications, which are called feed readers. These feed readers read feeds at a regular 
interval and mark the new items in bold (or with some other format). Thus, you can 
clearly understand what is new after your last visit to the particular website that 
produced the feed.
Some of the most popular feed readers are mentioned in the following list:
RSS Owl: This is an incredibly small application built on Java SWT 
technology. It is fast, small, and easy to use. RSS Owl requires Java runtime 
to work properly. This is an open-source software that you can obtain from 
http://www.rssowl.org.
Built-in feed reader of Firefox: The Firefox browser comes with a built-in feed 
reader. So whenever you point your browser to a feed URL, it is displayed in 
a nice and pleasing readable format.
Google feed reader: Google feed reader is another popular feed-reading tool. 
You can manage your feeds by keeping track of them and the Google reader 
will nicely display the feeds that have updated information.
Producing Feeds
You may wonder how these feeds are generated, especially in our WordPress blogs. 
Well, the whole process is automated. The WordPress distribution pack comes with 
a feed generator. The feed generator generates feeds from posts, comments, and even 
categories. The WordPress feed generator generates both Atom and RSS feeds.
•

Chapter 6
[ 161 ]
You can find the feed generator in the WordPress blog if you point your browser 
to any of the following URLs: http://your_wordpress_installation_path/
wp-rss.php, http://your_wordpress_installation_path/wp-rss2.php, 
http://your_wordpress_installation_path/wp-commentsrss2.php, and 
http://your_wordpress_installation_path/wp-atom.php. Let's take a look at 
the following screenshot that we can see when we browse to the wp-rss.php URL:
This is the default look of our WordPress blog that we created in the previous 
chapter. The feeds are shown in a nice format using the built-in feed reader of 
Firefox (included in the Bon Echo version). Let us take a look at the raw source that 
generates it. To view the source, click on the View menu and select Page Source, or 
simply hit Ctrl +u.

Feeds and Podcasting
[ 162 ]
So you see that the wp-rss.php URL generates RSS 0.92 compliant feeds. If you 
browse wp-rss2.php, you will find that the sources are RSS 2.0-compliant.

Chapter 6
[ 163 ]
So that's it. WordPress has built-in feed producers. If you want to provide an RSS 
links for posts in your blog, just point them to wp-rss.php and wp-rss2.php. 
For RSS feeds for comments, point to wp-commentsrss.php. For categories, point 
to wp-rss.php or wp-rss2.php along with a category ID. For example, wp-rss.
php?cat=15; here, 15 is the category ID.
Consuming Feeds
In the Feed Readers section, we discussed how you can consume feeds using different 
desktop software. In this section, we will see how we can consume feeds from 
remote sources into your WordPress blog.

Feeds and Podcasting
[ 164 ]
Whenever you need to consume and display feeds from another source, there will 
probably be one of two scenarios:
First and most of the time, you want to consume feeds and display their 
content (mostly, just the title) in your sidebar.
You may also consume feeds and display the title and a short description 
about it in your posts or pages. These posts will automatically display the 
latest feed contents whenever some visitor sees them.
In this section, we will discuss both cases and how to accomplish these tasks with 
our regular WordPress installation. In both these cases, we should use plug-ins. 
Sometimes we can use existing plug-ins, sometimes we can develop our own.
Feeds come in XML format. So if you want to fetch feed contents from a remote 
source, you will fetch an XML document that you need to parse and extract to 
display it in whatever format you want. In PHP, there are built-in XML parsers 
that can parse an XML document and supply you the contents in a usable way; for 
example, in arrays. However, to parse the XML document of an RSS feed, we are 
not going to re-invent the wheel by parsing it totally from scratch. There are several 
libraries to do the job for us; we only need to perform the rest of the job, which is to 
display the parsed content in a proper way. These libraries are open source, freely 
available under different open-source licenses like GPL, CC, and LGPL. A few of 
those that are most commonly used are lastRSS, magpieRSS, and SimplePie. Among 
these, I have found lastRSS to be very flexible to use.
Let's develop a small plug-in that displays content from an RSS feed inside a post or 
on a page. Firstly, let us create a PHP file named rss.plugin.php and save it in the 
wp-content/plugin folder. However, before that please download the lastRSS.
php file from lastrss.webdot.cz (http://lastrss.webdot.cz/lastRSS.zip) 
and place it in the same folder. The lastRSS.php file contains RSS parsing functions, 
which are used by this plug-in. Here is the code for the plug-in:
<?
/*
Plug-in Name: RSS Processor
Plug-in URI: http://hasin.phpxperts.com/
Description: A plug-in that aggregates RSS and parses to show it, you 
can use it in any post of any page
Author: Hasin Hayder
Version: 2.0 
Author URI: http://hasin.phpxperts.com
Feature: now supports multi rss source in single post or page. 
*/

After finishing your code, activate the plug-in from your plug-in administration 
panel. You will find the plug-in as RSS Processor.
To see the plug-in in action, just add the following line to any post or page content:
{rss uri='http://some_feed_url' count=10}

[ 167 ]
Now, take a look at the following screenshot:
Now if you locate this post in the browser, you will find the following output:

Feeds and Podcasting
[ 168 ]
Please compare it with our post body. After the content that we type in our post, all 
the contents are dynamically extracted from the RSS feed URL and the top five posts 
are displayed.
Adding Feeds in the Sidebar
The rss_sidebar() function in this plug-in has been designed to display extracted 
feed titles in your sidebar. Open your sidebar file using the theme editor or any FTP 
client, and add the following code at the bottom:
<div class="line"></div>
<h3>Feeds from PHPExperts</h3>
<?
rss_sidebar("http://rss.groups.yahoo.com/group/phpexperts/rss",5);
?>
Now save the changes and open your blog in the browser. If you take a look at the 
bottom of your sidebar, you will find the feeds.
Thus, you can get whatever you want with minimal amount of coding. That's the 
magic of WordPress and that's why WordPress is so popular and extensible.
Other Useful Plug-ins for Syndication
There are several other very popular plug-ins for syndication in WordPress. Some 
help to fetch the feed contents from remote sources and display them in a more 
stylish way, some collect the latest posts from remote sources and display them 
turning your blog into a planet.

Chapter 6
[ 169 ]
If you are involved with different developer communities, 
then you must be already familiar with planets. A planet 
is a kind of news aggregator that collects content from 
different blogs having the same interest. Usually, these 
planet applications collect news from RSS feeds of very 
popular and renowned blogs and display their contents in 
a single page. So if you browse a planet, you will instantly 
know what is hot and happening in the community. You 
will find some very popular planets like Planet-PHP 
(http://planet-php.org), Planet-MySQL 
(http://www.planetmysql.org/), Planet-Ruby 
(http://planetruby.0x42.net/), Planet-PostgreSQL 
(http://www.planetpostgresql.org/), and so forth.
You will find a list of available plug-ins at the following URL:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/Syndication
There are a number of plug-ins listed there, but the FeedWordPress plug-in is 
extremely useful, especially if you want to turn your WordPress blog into a planet.
FeedWordPress
FeedWordPress is a great plug-in if you want to aggregate posts from different blogs 
and display their content at a single place. In this section, we will discuss how to 
turn your blog into a planet using this great plug-in. FeedWordPress is developed 
by Charles Johnson (http://radgeek.com/contact) and you can download it from 
http://projects.radgeek.com/feedwordpress/.
Installing FeedWordPress is simple. After downloading and extracting the archive, 
you will find a folder named wp-content folder. Inside this folder, there are two files, 
namely update-feeds.php and feedwordpress.php. Place these files inside your 
WordPress directory as per the following directions:
1.	 Place feedwordpress.php inside your plugins folder 
(wp-content/plugins/).
2.	 Place update-feeds.php inside the wp-content folder.
Now go to your Plugins administration panel and activate this plug-in. You will 
find the plug-in as Feed Wordpress. After activating this plug-in, you will find 
an additional sub-menu Syndication under the Options menu. Take a look at the 
following screenshot:

Feeds and Podcasting
[ 170 ]
From this panel, you can syndicate remote feed contents under any specific category; 
you can also choose which items to syndicate.

Chapter 6
[ 171 ]
If you scroll down the page, you will find a section with further more options:
These settings provide more control over fetched contents, for example you can 
publish these feeds right after aggregating or you can hold them for moderation.
Podcasting
Podcasting is a way of sharing your blog in an audio format, which means you just 
record your voice on some topic and distribute it from your blog. Podcasters usually 
distribute content in RSS format or in Atom format. Podcast clients like iTune, Juice, 
and CastPodder are able to extract the content from your RSS feeds, download it into 
an audio player, and help the listeners listen to those files.
You may wonder how the podcast clients understand the music files as podcast. 
Well, whenever you make a post in your blog, a link to that post is automatically 
included in your blog RSS. While generating those RSS feeds, WordPress is 
intelligent enough to add an <enclosure> tag (available in RSS 2.0) if any music file 
is linked within that post. It will look something as follows in your blog RSS:
<enclosure url="http://your_domain/file_name.file_extension"
length="file_size_in_bytes" type="mime_type_of_this_file" />
Please note that the <enclosure> tag is a sub-tag of the <item> tag. So your job is 
to make a post and WordPress will do the rest for you. However, there are certain 
issues; let us now have a detailed look at podcasting.

Feeds and Podcasting
[ 172 ]
How to Podcast
For basic podcasting, just follow the directions given as follows:
Record your voice: You can record your voice or whatever you want to podcast 
using any commercial or free software and save it as an MP3 file. There are several 
commercial applications for working with sound; however, if you want to go for free 
software, I would recommend Audacity. This is a cross-platform sound editor. You can 
download Audacity from the following URL: http://audacity.sourceforge.net/. 
There is a free applications that runs on Windows and works pretty fine; it is called 
WavePad. You can download WavePad from http://www.nch.com.au/wavepad/.
Upload to a server: You can now upload your recorded music files onto your server 
or anywhere you want. You can also use archive.org to upload free of cost to host 
your audio files free of cost. However, there are some issues; if you use archive.
org, you will find that it gives you a URL that actually redirects to the music content 
behind the scene. Now, when you make a post that links to your archive.org 
music file, WordPress can't detect the redirection and hence it can't add the 
music file in the <enclosure> tag. To solve this issue, Tom Raftery's blog 
(http://www.tomrafteryit.net/wordpress-podcasts-not-showing-up-fixed/) 
has a solution where he recommends doing the following; and it works.
While creating a post, scroll down to the bottom section and you will find a 
section named Add custom field. Just add a key named enclosure and type 
the URL of your music file as the value of that key.
For subsequent posts, just select the item key from the custom field key 
drop‑down box, and type the URL of the music file as its value.
Make a post: After successfully uploading to any server, now its time to make a post. 
Please be careful, you must add a link to the absolute URL (that means the exact 
URL pointing to that audio file) of the music file inside your post content. No relative 
content will work. Take a look at the following screenshot:
•

Chapter 6
[ 173 ]
After saving this post, if you take a look at your RSS feed, you will find the first item 
(the post that you just made becomes your top item in RSS feeds) looking like this:
<item>
    <title>Sample Podcast</title>
    <link>http://localhost/wp/2006/06/27/sample-podcast/</link>
    <comments>http://localhost/wp/2006/06/27/sample-podcast/

<![CDATA[<p>Lets podcast from wordpress blog. All you have to do is

                  type='audio/mpeg'/>
</item>
Please notice the <enclosure> tag in the preceding feed entry. WordPress 
automatically detects the size of that audio file. So when someone subscribes to 
your blog RSS using iTune or any podcast client, this content will be automatically 
downloaded to his/her audio player for listening to that podcast.

[ 174 ]
Useful Plug-ins for Podcasting
There are plug-ins available for podcasting with WordPress. You can check the 
following two plug-ins for working further on podcasting:
Podpress (http://www.mightyseek.com/podpress) is a cool plug-in that will help 
you to podcast more smartly. This plug-in has built-in player support, preview 
support , video podcasting, and much more.
iPodCatter (http://garrickvanburen.com/wordpress-plugins/wpipodcatter) 
helps podcasters running WordPress to create a valid feed for iTunes' podcast 
directory and specify the itunes:duration and itunes:explicit tags on a per-
episode basis.
Dedicated Podcasting 
If you want a separate RSS feed just for your podcasts, then it is considered as 
dedicated podcasting. For this, you need to create a category like my_podcasts or 
something meaningful. Now whenever you make a podcast, just post under this 
special category my_podcasts.
We know that by default WordPress RSS contains all posts in its feed collection. 
However, to make a separate RSS feed URL just for this category, we need to browse 
the feed URL in the following format:
http://your_wordpress_installation/?feed=rss2&category_name=my_podcasts
If you browse this URL, you will find only the latest feeds from the 
my_podcasts category.
Summary
Feeds are a very important component for delivering the content of your blog to 
your readers. In this chapter, we learned what an RSS feed is and how to incorporate 
feeds within our WordPress blog. Though different versions of RSS are available, 
version 0.91 is the simplest while version 2.0 is feature-rich. If you want to deliver 
binary contents or audio/video files through your RSS, you must deliver the feeds in 
RSS 2.0 format.
In the next chapter, you will learn how to develop WordPress themes.

Developing Themes
One of the main attractions for WordPress users is the great themes contributed by 
the thousands of users around the world. Some of these themes are proprietary and 
some are free. Using these themes, you can decorate and display your WordPress 
blog in whatever style you want. Though in general bloggers are happy with 
customized themes, sometimes to make something different from others, you may 
want to customize the look and feel of your blog. If that is so, there is no way other 
than editing the theme files.
In this chapter, we will show you how to develop WordPress themes on your own. 
We will also show you some quick tricks to achieve the desired functionality by 
editing the minimum amount of code. Design hacks and directions will help you to 
develop awesome themes for the rest of the WordPress community.
Just keep in mind that creating a WordPress theme doesn't require you to be a PHP 
pro. All you need is a basic idea about PHP, loops, and variables. Sometimes even 
just a cut-copy-paste will work fine. The most important thing that you need is a 
good knowledge about CSS.
Start Using a Blank Page
Before going deep into theme development, we need to understand how WordPress 
actually works and how the contents are served to the end users. So we will start 
with a blank theme (a blank PHP file) and play with it. Once you get the basic idea, 
we will dive into further details.
Set It Up
Using your favorite text editor or PHP editor, create a blank PHP file inside the 
themes folder. WordPress themes have a lot of code in CSS and a minimal amount of 
code in PHP. A theme consists of at least one CSS file and a couple of PHP files. 

Developing Themes
[ 176 ]
To set up a blank theme, we need to create two files first and then we will grow 
gradually. So how do you want to name your theme? Choose an interesting name, 
because the WordPress community will know you by the name of your theme. For 
the time being, let our theme be known as "zephyr".
Every theme must stay in its own directory, and you must place each theme under 
the themes folder inside the wp-content/themes folder. Let us create a folder 
"zephyr" under the themes folder.
Inside this zephyr folder (wp-content/themes/zephyr), we will now create a CSS 
file by the name of style.css in which we will define our theme for the WordPress 
blogging engine (it may sound a bit weird, but that is easy). Let us create the CSS file 
with the following content:
/*
Theme Name: Zephyr
Theme URI: http://our_wordpress_url
Description: Some description about our theme
Version: 1
Author: Its You
Author URI: http://author_website_url
*/
This content must be at the top of the CSS file.
Now create a blank index.php file in the same folder. Just keep it blank with 
absolutely no code in it.
That's it; we have developed our first theme. If you don't believe it, just log into the 
WordPress admin panel and click on the Presentation menu. At the bottom of the 
page, you will find our theme zephyr listed there.

Chapter 7
[ 177 ]
If you select this theme and go to your WordPress blog, you will find a blank page. 
This is because we didn't add any code in our index file. The following sections will 
show you how to do this.
Adding Content to Our Theme
Now it's time to add some content to our theme. Let us display the title of all our 
posts. Open your index.php file inside the zephyr folder and add the following code:
<?php
if (have_posts())
{
  the_post();
  the_title();
}
?>
This code is totally self-explanatory. It means that if there are posts in our blog, we 
have to fetch them and display the titles. Please note that the content of the post is 
fetched by the the_post() function, which is a built-in function in WordPress. Now 
go to your blog and run it. You will be able to see only one title, which is from our 
last post. Clearly this is not what we were expecting. We wanted to see the titles of 
all our posts. To do this, we have to just add a loop.
<?php
if (have_posts())
{
  while(have_posts())
  {
    the_post();
    the_title();
    echo "<br/>";
  }
}
?>
The preceding code works by checking whether there are posts, and if so looping 
through them, fetching their content, and displaying the title. Now take a look at the 
blog. You will see something like the following screen:

Developing Themes
[ 178 ]
It is interesting to note that we displayed all these titles with just nine lines of code. 
Let's have some fun now. Each and every post in WordPress has an ID. We will now 
add a link to each of these titles. We will also see the content of the posts when the 
respective titles are clicked.
<?if (have_posts()):?>
  <? while(have_posts()):?>
    <? the_post()?>
    <a href='<?=the_permalink()?>'><?=the_title()?></a>
    <br/>
  <?endwhile;?>
<?endif;?>
Please note how we use the block syntax here for if and 
while loops. If you are not familiar with this syntax, 
please visit the alternative syntax for control structures 
in the PHP manual, which is available online at 
http://www.php.net/manual/en/
control-structures.alternative-syntax.php.
If you now visit the blog, you will find that every title is displayed as a text link; 
however, nothing happens when we click on them. To further modify it, we will add 
some more code so that we can see the content when we click on these titles.
<?if (have_posts()):?>
  <? while(have_posts()):?>
    <? the_post()?>
    <a href='<?=the_permalink()?>'><?=the_title()?></a>
    <?if (!is_home()):?>
    <p>
      <?the_content();?>

Chapter 7
[ 179 ]
    </p>
    <?endif;?>
    <br/>
  <?endwhile;?>
<?endif;?>
Now if you click on any title, you will see the content of that particular post.
Please note that an Edit link is also available if you are logged in as the 
administrator.
Next we are going to add the category name and modify the look and feel of this 
page. So far WordPress has been displaying our posts using only one file, index.php. 
If we want to modify the look and feel for just the single-post display as shown in the 
preceding screenshot, then we can add some code in the index.php file; however, 
it is a wise idea to split the code into multiple files for the sake of manageability. 
WordPress seeks a file called single.php for displaying a single post and if that is not 
available, WordPress uses the index.php file. We are now going to add the following 
code to the single.php file to display the post with a better look and feel:
<? if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
  <h2><? the_title(); ?></h2>
  <? the_content(); ?>
  <? edit_post_link(__('Edit'), '<p>', '</p>'); ?>
<? endwhile; endif; ?>

Developing Themes
[ 180 ]
If you now browse any post, you will view it in the following format:
Displaying the Post Excerpt on the Front Page
We displayed just the title of our posts on our front page. To display the excerpt 
under each post title, let us modify our front page as follows:
<?if (have_posts()):?>
  <? while(have_posts()):?>
    <? the_post()?>
    <a href='<?=the_permalink()?>'><?=the_title()?></a>
      <?the_content("more");?>
    <br/>
  <?endwhile;?>
<?endif;?>
The <the_content("more")> function will split the post content and display the 
portion before the <more> tag placed inside the post, if any is available.

Chapter 7
[ 181 ]
Please note the more link displayed in the preceding screenshot.
Retrieving the Category Name for Each Post
If we want to display on the front page the category name under which a post 
belongs, let us modify the code in the index.php file as follows:
<?if (have_posts()):?>
  <? while(have_posts()):?>
    <? the_post()?>
    <a href='<?=the_permalink()?>'><?=the_title()?></a>
    in <strong><?the_category(",");?></strong>
      <?the_content("more");?>
    <br/>
  <?endwhile;?>
<?endif;?>
Now if you browse the front page, it will display the category names beside all 
the posts.
Retrieving the Date and Author 
Again, we may want to display the date and author of each post beneath the post 
title. The WordPress API contains all the necessary functions for themes, and we 
have built-in functions for displaying the name and author of each post as well. Let 
us modify the single.php file as follows:

Developing Themes
[ 182 ]
<?if (have_posts()):?>
  <? while(have_posts()):?>
    <? the_post()?>
    <h1><a href='<?=the_permalink()?>'><?=the_title()?></a></h1>
    <?php _e("Posted "); ?> by <?php the_author() ?> at 
                                     <?php the_time('F jS, Y')?><hr/>
      <?the_content("more");?>
    <br/>
  <?endwhile;?>
<?endif;?>
Retrieving Lists of Categories, Archives, and 
Calendars
There are several ways in which you can sort your blog posts, for example, through 
categories and archives. You can also display a calendar where all the posts are 
linked by dates; so whenever you click on any date, you can see all the posts made 
on that day. The WordPress API has built-in functions for all these.
To retrieve the list of categories, you can use the wp_list_cats() function. While 
using this function, you can exclude some categories and sort them according to 
different criteria. For example, take a look at the following code:
<?
//this will display all categories
wp_list_cats();
echo "<hr>";
//this will display all available categories excluding some specified 
//exclusively
wp_list_cats("exclude=2,5,1,6&sort_column=name");
?>

Chapter 7
[ 183 ]
If you run this code in the index.php file, you will understand the difference.
To display the archive of your posts, use the wp_get_archives() function. You can 
display archives in the following formats:
Monthly
Daily
PostByPost
Weekly
You can limit the length of the archive by supplying an additional limit parameter. 
You can also enclose each archive link by supplying before and after parameters.
<? wp_get_archives('type=monthly&limit=5'); ?>
Take a look at the different archiving styles as shown in the following screenshot:
You can display a calendar in your WordPress blog using the 
wp_get_calendar() function.
The date on which a post was made will be shown as a link so that anyone can click 
it and view the posts.

[ 184 ]
Display an RSS Feed Image beside Every Category
If you want to display the RSS feed link for each of the categories, you just need to 
specify the feed image in the wp_list_cats() function. For example, take a look at 
the following code block:
<?
wp_list_cats("exclude=2,5,1,6&sort_column=name&feed_image=feed.gif");
?>
When you run the code (assuming you have placed a small RSS icon, feed.gif, in 
your WordPress root folder), you will see the following output:
Since we haven't defined any style for links yet, they are displayed in the 
default format.
All the category parameters are documented in detail in 
http://codex.wordpress.org.
Displaying Blogroll and Pagelinks
To display all the links in your blogroll, use the wp_get_links() function. It will 
deliver all the blogroll links enclosed by any HTML tag that you supply.
<?php get_links('-1', '<li>', '</li>', '', 0, 'name', 0, 0, -1, 0, 
true); ?>
The preceding line of code will display links from your blogroll under every 
category. The second and third parameters indicate the HTML tags that are to be 
used to wrap each of these links. Here, the <li> and </li> parameters mean that 
they will output links in the <li><a href='linkurl'>linktext</a></li> format. 
The sixth parameter indicates the field to be used to sort the links. The last parameter 
is a very interesting one. We supplied true, which indicates that the function will 
output the links on the page. If we supplied false, it would have returned the 
output instead of displaying it.

Chapter 7
[ 185 ]
Almost every WordPress core function has the capability 
of either displaying the output or returning it to the calling 
procedure. If you plan to process the returned output, then 
capturing the output is necessary.
To display the links of the available pages, use the wp_list_pages() function. You 
can supply the title to be displayed as shown below.
<? wp_list_pages("title_li=MyPages")?>
Displaying Blog Information
You may also want to display some basic information about your blog in your 
theme. This information could be your admin_email, rss_url, atom_url, 
pingback_url, or comments_url.
To display all or some of this information, you need to invoke only one function, 
which is bloginfo(). Let us see the following example:
<a href='<?bloginfo('rss_url')?>'>RSS</a><br/>
<a href='<?bloginfo('rss2_url')?>'>RSS2</a><br/>
<a href='<?bloginfo('atom_url')?>'>Atom</a><br/>
<a href='<?bloginfo('comments_rss2_url')?>'>CommentsRSS</a><br/>
This code will produce the following HTML output, specific to my blog settings.
<a href="http://localhost/wp/feed/rss/">RSS</a><br>
<a href="http://localhost/wp/feed/">RSS2</a><br>
<a href="http://localhost/wp/feed/atom/">Atom</a><br>
<a href="http://localhost/wp/comments/feed/">CommentsRSS</a><br>
Since I am running the blog example from my PC, the URL is localhost. However, it 
will vary from blog to blog.
There are several other parameters available that can be passed to bloginfo. These 
parameters are needed while developing plug-ins and themes where you need 
information to access specific files.
These parameters are wpurl, siteurl, description, name, pingback_url, 
stylesheet_url, stylesheet_directory, template_directory, admin_email, 
charset, and version.

Developing Themes
[ 186 ]
Displaying a Search Bar
A search bar is a essential part in the sidebar. If we want to display a search bar in 
our theme, we need to add the following code in our sidebar file, sidebar.php:
<li id="search">
  <?php include (TEMPLATEPATH . '/searchform.php'); ?>
</li>
The preceding code includes a file named searchform.php from our current theme 
directory. This searchform.php file includes the following block of code:
<form method="get" action="<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>">
<p>
<input type="text" value="<?php echo wp_specialchars($s, 1); ?>" 
name="s" id="s" />
<input type="submit" value=" Search " />
</p>
</form>
Displaying Comments under Each Post
We are now going to display a section for adding comments under each post, 
especially in single-post mode. When a visitor clicks over a post title, then he or she 
can read the post content, read the existing comments, and post his or her comments.
For displaying the comment submission form and the existing comments, we need to 
place code in a new file, comments.php. The following section explain this.
Displaying Existing Comments
Let us modify our comments.php file as follows. We will first check for available

display an RSS feed for the comments and a trackback URL for this post.

Now if you visit the page, you will find the screen looking as follows:

Chapter 7
[ 189 ]
We have discussed all the basic things you need to know for kick-starting theme 
development. We will now create a nice theme for ourselves with all these features 
and having a good look and feel.
Plan for a Design
Before creating a theme, always have a clear idea about the look and the features of 
your theme. WordPress themes can be of one-column, two columns, three columns, 
or four columns. Among these, one-column and two-column themes are the most 
common and popular as opposed to four-column themes.
Please note that table-based layout designs are not a good idea for designing layouts. 
Try to use <div> object and CSS for layout design. This will give you extreme 
flexibility over your themes.
In this chapter, we will cover a typical two-column theme since it is impossible to 
cover every type of layout. However, we will also cover the layout code for three-
column and four‑column themes. A two-column theme could be either of the 
following two; that is, we can have our sidebar either on the left or the right side.
Out of the preceding two layouts, we will design the first one here. However, it is not 
a big issue to convert our design to the second one.
In the sidebar, we will display categories, recent comments, recent posts, a calendar, 
a search bar, a login link, a blogroll, and some introductory text. We will also fetch 
RSS feeds from outside and display them in our sidebar.
In the header section, we will display our blog title and an image.
In the footer section, we will display some RSS links and copyright information.
Later in this chapter, we will also discuss widget-enabled themes and how to add 
several options in the administration panel. We will start by creating the CSS code 

Developing Themes
[ 190 ]
for our layout and design in a single index.php and style.css file. Gradually, we 
will split the components. Our theme will be Opera-, IE_, and Firefox-compatible.
CSS and HTML Code for a Two-Column 
Theme
As we start with a blank index.php file, we will not insert any PHP code at first. Let 
us make a simple index.php file with the following code:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-
1" />
<title>Untitled Document</title>
</head>
<style>
  div
  {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
  }
  body
  {
    margin:0px;
    margin-top: 10px;
  }
  #container
  {
    width: 900px;
    margin:auto;
    border: 0px solid #ccc;
  }
  
  #header
  {
    height: 100px;
  }
  
  #post_container
  {
    border: 0px solid #ccc;
  }
  
  .separator

Chapter 7
[ 191 ]
  {
    clear:both;
    margin-top: 10px;
    margin-bottom:5px;
    border: 0px solid #ccc;
  }
  #left_pan, #right_pan
  {
    float: left;
    height: 400px;
  }
  #left_pan
  {
    width: 200px;
  }
  #right_pan
  {
    width: 690px;
    margin-left: 5px;
  }
  #footer
  {
    clear: both;
    height: 20px;
  }
</style>
<body>
<div id="container">
  <div id="header">
  </div>
  <div class="separator">
  </div>
  <div id="post_container">
    <div id="left_pan">
    </div>
    
    <div id="right_pan">
    </div>
    <div class="separator">
    </div>
  </div>

Developing Themes
[ 192 ]
    <div class="separator">
    </div>
  <div id="footer">
  </div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
The code marked as bold in the preceding file is redundant. 
This is just to demonstrate how CSS-based layout actually 
works. In our original theme, we will remove these lines.
Now if you browse the page, you will see the following output:
The layout is same in Firefox, IE, and Opera. If you want your sidebar on the right 
side, just change the CSS code in the preceding file as follows and your sidebar will 
instantly move to the right.
#left_pan
  {
    width: 690px;
  }
  #right_pan
  {
    width: 200px;

Chapter 7
[ 193 ]
    margin-left: 5px;
  }
So you now understand why CSS-based layouts are so widely used. They are easy to 
maintain, easy to modify, and of course flexible to work with.
Next, we will split our theme into smaller parts for the sake of maintainability. For 
example, we will split our theme into four parts:
Header
Body
Sidebar
Footer
Let us modify our index.php file as follows:
<?php  get_header(); ?>
  <div id="post_container">
    <?php get_sidebar(); ?>
    <div id="right_pan">
    </div>
    <div class="separator">
    </div>
<?php get_footer(); ?>
You may wonder about the small size of the previously big index.php file. Well, 
the other parts of the file are distributed among four files: style.css, header.php, 
sidebar.php, and footer.php. The built-in function get_header() includes 
the content in header.php in the current directory (that is our theme directory). 
•

•

Developing Themes
[ 194 ]
get_sidebar() does the same, but it includes content from 
sidebar.php; get_footer() includes content from footer.php.
We moved out all style content to the style.css file. Let us now see the content for 
the other files.
header.php
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-
1" />
<title>Untitled Document</title>
</head>
  <style type="text/css" media="screen">
    @import url( <?php bloginfo('stylesheet_url'); ?> );
  </style>
<body>
<div id="container">
  <div id="header">
  </div>
  <div class="separator">
  </div>
sidebar.php
    <div id="left_pan">
    </div>
footer.php
  </div>
    <div class="separator">
    </div>
  <div id="footer">
  </div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
We have split our index.php file into four small parts. Here, we see three parts, 
namely header.php, sidebar.php, and footer.php. The index.php file will itself 

Chapter 7
[ 195 ]
contain another part that is the body. Since the body is quite large, we will create 
it step-by-step later in the chapter. All the four parts are included together in the 
index.php file; so the output remains same. We split our code into four separate files 
so that we can design each part more conveniently.
Design the Header
Now it's time to design our header. Open the header.php file in your favorite text 
editor. We need to see the blog title and the blog subtitle in the header. Besides, we 
also need a header image.
We need to create a nice background for our header section; so we create a 5*150 
pixel GIF file with a gradient effect. We save that file as bg.gif in the images folder 
under our themes folder.
Let us now code our header.php file as follows:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; 
                                               charset=iso-8859-1" />
<title>Untitled Document</title>
</head>
  <style type="text/css" media="screen">
    @import url( <?php bloginfo('stylesheet_url'); ?> );
  </style>
<body>
<div id="container">
  <div id="header">
    <div id="header_title">
      <?php bloginfo('name'); ?>
    </div>
    <div id="header_subtitle">
      <?php bloginfo('description'); ?>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="separator">
  </div>
We will also add the following CSS code to our style.css file:
#header
{

Developing Themes
[ 196 ]
  height: 150px;
  background-image: url("images/bg.gif");
  border: 1px solid #000;
}
#header_title
{
  font-family:Georgia;
  font-size: 28px;
  margin-top: 45px;
  margin-left: 20px;
  color: #eee;
}
#header_subtitle
{
  font-family:Georgia;
  font-size: 12px;
  margin-top: 5px;
  margin-left: 22px;
  color: #edc;
}
Our page now looks as follows:
Design the Sidebar
We need to place the following content in our sidebar:
Some description
Pages
Categories
Archives
Blogrolls (links)
RSS links
•
•

Chapter 7
[ 197 ]
We know how to fetch this content; so let us open the sidebar.php file and modify it 
as follows:
<div id="left_pan">
  <div class="sidebar_container">
    <ul>
      <li><h2>About</h2></li>
      <li>Packt publishing is a great publisher. Packt publishing is a 
great publisher. Packt publishing is a great publisher.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
    <div class="sidebar_container">
    <ul>
      <li><h2>Pages</h2></li>
      <?php wp_list_pages('title_li='); ?>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="sidebar_container">
    <ul>
      <li><h2>Categories</h2></li>
      <?php wp_list_cats("exclude=2,5,1,6&sort_column=name"); ?>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="sidebar_container">
    <ul>
      <li><h2>Archives</h2></li>
      <?php wp_get_archives();?>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="sidebar_container">
    <ul>
      <li><h2>Links</h2></li>
      <?php wp_get_links();?>
    </ul>
  </div>	
  <div class="sidebar_container">
    <ul>
      <li><h2>Meta</h2></li>
      <li><?php wp_loginout(); ?></li>
      <li><a href="<?php bloginfo('rss2_url'); ?>">RSS</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://wordpress.org/">WP</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

Developing Themes

Let us also modify the CSS code for our sidebar as follows:
#left_pan
{
  padding-left: 2px;
  padding-right: 2px;
  padding-bottom: 2px;
  padding-top: 2px;
}
#left_pan h2
{
  margin-top: 0px;
  padding-top: 2px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  font-size: 16px;
  padding-bottom: 5px;
  display: block;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;
  color: #8CBFF8;
}
#left_pan ul 
{
  padding:0px;
  margin: 0px; /* for IE */
  list-style:none;
}
.sidebar_container
{
  padding-left: 10px;
  padding-right: 10px;
  padding-top: 5px;
  padding-bottom: 5px;
  background-color: #093C76;
  color: #eee;
}
#left_pan a:link, #left_pan a:hover, #left_pan a:visited
{
  color: #eee;
  text-decoration: none;
}

Chapter 7
[ 199 ]
#left_pan a:hover
{
  text-decoration: underline;
}
Design the Body
We have now reached the most crucial part of our blog. We need to design the body 
of our blog. We need to display the post title, the post author, the date on which the 
post was made, the post excerpt, and the number of comments. Let us first design the 
body. Open the index.php file and modify it as follows:
<?php get_header(); ?>
  <div id="post_container">
    <?php get_sidebar(); ?>
    <div id="right_pan">
    <?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>

Developing Themes
[ 200 ]
    <div id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>">
    <h2><a href="<?php the_permalink() ?>">
    <?php the_title(); ?></a></h2>
    <div class="meta">
    <?php _e("Posted in"); ?> 
      <?php the_category(',') ?> by <?php the_author() ?> on the 
      <?php the_time('F jS, Y') ?> 
    <?php edit_post_link(__('Edit This')); ?></div>
    <div class="main">
    <?php the_content(__('(more...)')); ?>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="comments">
      <?php wp_link_pages(); ?>
      <?php comments_popup_link(__('<strong>0</strong> Comments'), __
('<strong>1</strong> Comment'), __('<strong>%</strong> Comments')); ?>
    </div>
    <?php comments_template(); ?>
    <?php endwhile; else: ?>
    <div class="warning">
      <p><?php _e('Sorry, no posts matched your criteria, please try 
and search again.'); ?></p>
    </div>
    <?php endif; ?>
    </div>
    <div class="separator">
  </div>
<?php get_footer(); ?>
The CSS code for the style.css file is as follows:
#right_pan
{
  padding-left: 10px;
}
#right_pan h2
{
  margin-top: 0px;
  font-size: 18px;
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}
#right_pan .meta
{
  font-size: 12px;

Chapter 7
[ 201 ]
  padding-bottom: 5px;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ABB9C8;
}
#right_pan a:hover, #right_pan a:link, #right_pan a:visited
{
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #27486E;
}
#right_pan .comments
{
  padding-bottom: 20px;
}
After adding the body, our page will look as follows:

When someone selects a single post, the screen will look as follows:
Design the Footer
This is the simplest part of our theme. Here is the code for footer.php:

    <div class="separator">
    </div>
  <div id="footer">

  </div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
The code for style.css is as follows:

#footer{

  border-top: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding-top: 20px;
  padding-bottom: 20px;
  font-size: 12px;
}
Themes in Minutes
In the previous section, we learned how to create themes from scratch. We had 
ultimate flexibility over our design and created exactly what we wanted. However, all 
this comes at a cost. To develop a theme completely from scratch needs a lot of time.
Recall how we started our theme development process. We first planned our theme, 
thought over its design, and probably sketched roughly with some illustration 
software. Finally, after fixing the design and content, we started coding. You should 
not self-design a theme unless you are delivering a very complex theme like the one 
http://www.ajaxian.com has. If you go to the Ajaxian website, you will find a lot of 
gadgets there and it represents its content in a very nice and stylish way.
For creating quick themes, you can pick an already existing theme that is similar to 
your planned design (at least in terms of layout) and modify its code. Sometimes 
these themes are so similar to each other that all you need to do is edit the CSS file.
Ian Marine's very popular Green Marine theme is a very interesting theme with a 
lot of work around. This theme comes in different color schemes obtained just by 
modifying its CSS file and sometimes slightly changing the image files. For example, 
there are two variations of the Green Marine theme created by Ian Marine. They are 
called Blue Marine and Orange Marine, respectively.
These two variations will help you to understand that you can bring considerable 
changes to the look and feel of the theme by modifying the CSS file.
There is one more trick for instantly getting a suitable theme for yourself. Many of 
these themes have built-in banner images. You can modify these banners and get a 
native look for your site. If you are not sure where to find these banner images, you 
can search for the images folder inside the theme folder. Usually theme developers 
use this images folder to store the images relevant to themes. If that doesn't work, 
you can search the image files inside the theme folder one by one or directly go to 
header.php and see where the banner image has been taken from.
You can go to http://codex.wordpress.org to look for some appropriate themes 
for your site. There you will find some popular WordPress theme repositories.

Developing Themes
[ 204 ]
Instant Theme Builders
Besides editing existing themes and developing from scratch, you can also obtain 
themes using theme builders. Theme builders are web-based or desktop-based 
applications where you can specify colors, layouts, and other styles for the different 
parts of a theme (namely, header, sidebar, body, and footer).You can then generate 
CSS files accordingly. 
The most advanced instant theme builder is available at: 
http://redalt.com/tools/builder.php.
Step 1: Select the Layout
In the theme builder by RedAlt, there are four supported layouts. You can select any 
of the four layout styles. Take a look at the following screenshot overleaf:
Step 2: Select Some Options
In this step, you can select some options for the different sections, like whether you 
want to display RSS Links, Trackback links, and so forth.

Chapter 7
[ 205 ]
Step 3: Select a Color Scheme
This step allows you to select a basic color scheme for your theme.
Step 4: Details of Colors and Download
In this step, you can specify the color details for the different sections.

Developing Themes
[ 206 ]
Finally, you can download the theme by clicking on the Download link at the bottom 
of the page.
After downloading, you can use this theme file as usual.
Widgetizing Themes
In WordPress 2.0, there is a plug-in called widget, which is an interesting part 
of WordPress. This plug-in has been developed by Automatic.com where the 
developer of WordPress, Matt Mullenweg also works. Using this plug-in, you can 
dynamically customize your sidebar by dragging and dropping widgets. Widgets 

Chapter 7
[ 207 ]
are small dragable parts that handle different types of functionality in the WordPress 
blog. For example, a Text Widget helps to display some text; an RSS widget fetches 
RSS contents from remote sites, and so forth.
In a standard widget plug-in, there are six types of built-in widgets. However, there 
are a lot of third-party widgets also. Let us see how to manage these widgets.
Log into the WordPress admin panel and select any theme from the Presentation 
menu. If that theme is "widget-ready" or compatible with widgets, you will instantly 
find a sub-menu called Sidebar Widgets available under the Presentation menu.
If you select the Sidebar Widgets menu, you will find something like the following:

Developing Themes
[ 208 ]
Now you can drag each of these items onto your sidebar (on the right) and your 
sidebar will contain only those items. For example, let us drag three widgets: recent 
posts, recent comments, and a text widget. If you click on the icon on the right-hand 
side of each widget, you can configure that widget.
Now if you browse your blog, you will see the change in your sidebar.
Making Your Theme Widget Enabled
To make our theme widget enabled, we need to make some simple changes. Open 
your sidebar file and modify according to the following:
<div id="left_pan">
  <div class="sidebar_container">
    <ul>
    <?php if ( !function_exists('dynamic_sidebar') || 
                                            !dynamic_sidebar() ) : ?>
       <li><h2>About</h2></li>

Chapter 7
[ 209 ]
       <li>Packt publishing is a great publisher. Packt publishing is 
        a great publisher. Packt publishing is a great publisher.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
    <div class="sidebar_container">
    <ul>
      <li><h2>Pages</h2></li>
      <?php wp_list_pages('title_li='); ?>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="sidebar_container">
    <ul>
      <li><h2>Categories</h2></li>
      <?php wp_list_cats("exclude=2,5,1,6&sort_column=name"); ?>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="sidebar_container">
    <ul>
      <li><h2>Archives</h2></li>
      <?php wp_get_archives();?>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="sidebar_container">
    <ul>
      <li><h2>Links</h2></li>
      <?php wp_get_links();?>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="sidebar_container">
    <ul>
      <li><h2>Meta</h2></li>
      <li><?php wp_loginout(); ?></li>
      <li><a href="<?php bloginfo('rss2_url'); ?>">RSS</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://wordpress.org/">WP</a></li>
  <? endif;?>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <div style="azimuth:behind">
  </div>
</div>
Well, one last step for completion. Create a file called functions.php in our theme 
folder, i.e. zephyr, and add the following code in it:

Developing Themes
[ 210 ]
<?
if ( function_exists('register_sidebars') )
  register_sidebars(1);
?>
Now if you select zephyr as your theme, you will find that a Sidebar Widgets 
menu appears.
Now you can drag and drop widgets from this menu. For example, make your 
sidebar like this:
After making all the desired changes, your blog will look as follows:

Summary
In this chapter, we learned how easy it is to develop themes according to our needs 
with the help of the feature-rich WordPress API. We also learned about widgets, how 
to use them, and how to enable our theme for widgets.
In the next chapter, we will learn about community blogging and managing user 
groups. Till then, have fun in playing with themes. Try to modify our theme. If you 
see anything interesting in any other theme, go to the code of that theme and learn 
how to implement that functionality in our theme.


Community Blogging
In the previous chapter, you learned how to manage the look and the feel of your 
WordPress blog by creating and modifying themes. In this chapter, we are going to 
introduce community blogging and user management. So far in this book we have 
been discussing a blog that is maintained by a single author; however, in real life 
this may not always make sense. There may be different communities with a set of 
bloggers who wish to blog at a single place, but as a separate entity.
In this chapter, we will discuss how to manage a group of authors in a single 
blog and how to manage their privileges. There is a special version of WordPress 
called WordPress MU that is developed solely as a multi-user blogging platform. 
WordPress MU is not officially maintained with WordPress releases. Since it is 
not a mainstream product, it is also not very well supported. However, it is worth 
being familiar with WordPress MU. This versatile multi-user blogging platform is 
discussed in detail in Chapter 10.
Flavors of Multi-User Blogging
WordPress is an extremely powerful blogging engine. Regular blogging requires a 
lot of features, some of which you discover when you require them. One of those 
features is multi-user blogging. Blogs are basically operated by single authors. 
However, there are several cases where a blog is required so that many people can 
blog jointly. If you are not sure, consider the following cases where a multi-user blog 
plays a diverse role.
A multi-user blogging platform is extremely useful for a group of people with 
similar interests. If that group wants to publish news on a specific topic (or on 
many topics in a broad sense), then there must be some facility so that they can log 
in as individual entities and post their content. However, in a multi-user blogging 
platform, content moderation is very vital. There must be some sort of moderation so 
that content is displayed after being approved by an authorized person.

[ 214 ]
Multi-user blogging platforms can play a vital role for developers. For example, if a 
group of remote developers (of a specific project) share their experiences in a blog, 
it will prove to be very helpful for new developers who might face similar kinds of 
problems. This blog may then act as a knowledge base for them.
Multi-user blogs are also helpful when used as a centralized news source or a central 
blogging zone for the employees of a company.
Managing Users in a Multi-User Blogging 
Platform
The first step of maintaining a multi-user blogging platform is to maintain a relation 
between the authors. All authors should not have similar privileges. There may 
be an author with higher privilege and power than the others. Above that author, 
there may be a small group of comparatively more privileged authors who act as 
moderators. Finally, there may be some general authors for writing and posting 
content frequently.
The WordPress admin panel provides everything you need to set up different 
privileges for these users. Let us first see how to create a user in a blog.
First of all, log into the admin panel and go to the Users menu. To add multiple 
users, select the Authors and Users sub-menu.
If you scroll down the page, you will find an option to add a new user to your blog. 
You are required to provide some basic information on this page. Let us add a user 
called test with a password demo.

Chapter 8
[ 215 ]
After the successful addition of a user, you will find the user added in the user panel. 
If you scroll down the page, you will see something like the following:
From this panel, you can set the user privileges right away by selecting their roles 
from the drop-down menu Set the Role of checked users to. Please note that 
all the newly added users will have the default privileges of a subscriber, which 
equals zero, which is the lowest in a group. A subscriber has the least privileges as 
compared to others. There are five different levels of privileges that you can set for 
a group of users or a particular user. These levels are Administrator, Editor, Author, 
Contributor, and Subscriber.

[ 216 ]
Administrator
An administrator is a person who can do everything in WordPress. There is no 
barrier for an administrator. As there are no permission problems for administrators, 
we will not be discussing more about them. However, it is not a wise decision to 
keep multiple administrators in one blog. An administrator can do the following 
jobs, which other editors can't do.
Switch the themes
Edit themes
Activate any plug-in
Edit any plug-in
Edit users 
Edit files
Manage options
Editor
An editor is capable of managing other people's post, moderating those posts, and 
finally publishing them. An editor cannot add or edit a user in WordPress. Let us see 
what an editor can do. First of all, let us take a look at the following screenshot. This 
is what an editor will see when logged into the blog.

Note that an editor has fewer menus available to him or her as compared to an 
administrator. Besides, there are lesser options available under each menu. For 
example, if an editor opens the Manage menu, he or she will see the following 
options available:
An editor can manage posts and modify their content. He or she can also manage 
the content of the pages. He or she can add and modify the categories, manage and 
moderate the comments, or mark the comments as spam, if any.

[ 218 ]
When an editor goes to the Link section, he or she will find the following menu 
available to him or her:
An editor is able to manage the links and link categories. He or she can also import 
links from an external OPML file. Briefly, as compared to an author, an editor can do 
the following additional jobs.
Moderate comments
Manage categories
Manage links
Author
An author is a comparatively less privileged person than an editor. When an author 
logs into the WordPress blog, he or she will have the following dashboard available:

Chapter 8
[ 219 ]
Authors can manage posts made by them or their subordinates. However, they cannot 
modify posts made by other authors. They cannot even modify comments made to a 
post that was not written by them. Authors have full freedom to modify their content, 
but are by no means privileged to modify others content. When authors click on the 
Manage menu, they will get the following options available:
As stated earlier, an author can only view other people's posts but cannot edit them. 
This is shown in the following screenshot:
Contributor
A contributor is only able to write and submit posts. However, these posts will not 
be published unless they are approved by an editor, an author, or an administrator. 
A contributor sees the same dashboard as an author, but there are significant changes 
in the writing panel and the manage section. Let us take a look at the contributor's 
writing panel:

Community Blogging
[ 220 ]
Please note that there is no Publish button in the writing panel. You can only save 
your post as a draft when you are logged in as a contributor.
Under the Manage menu, you will get the following options:
Subscriber
A subscriber can only read comments and posts. He or she can also subscribe to 
newsletters, if available any. Following is the dashboard for a subscriber when 
logged in.
User Levels
If you are using WordPress version 1.5 and have not updated to the recent version, 
then you may have some levels instead of these roles. There are levels from 0 to 10. 
Each level specifies some privilege. Let us see what these levels mean:
One who works at level 0 is a subscriber.
One who works at level 1 is a contributor.
One who works at level 2 to 4 is an author.
One who works at level 5 to 7 is an editor.
One who works at level 8 to 10 is an administrator.
Managing Profiles 
If you go to the Profile section as an administrator, you will find many options 
available to you. We are now going to have a brief discussion about the profile section.

The preceding page asks you to input all the basic information about yourself. 
You can also update your current password by entering the new password in the 
bottom-right section.
An important option is available at the bottom-left of this page, namely Use the 
visual rich editor when writing. This option specifies the type of editor that will 
appear while writing a post in the writing panel. If you check this option, you will 
get a WYSIWYG editor; otherwise, a traditional plain editor.
Deleting Users
If you want to delete an existing user, you should be aware of certain issues. While 
deleting a user, there are chances that you accidentally delete all the posts made by 
that user.

Community Blogging
[ 222 ]
To delete an existing user, just log into the admin panel and select the Profile menu. 
Select Authors and Users from the sub-menu. You will see all the available users in 
your blog. You can delete any one of them by checking the check box beside each of 
them and clicking the delete button at the bottom.
When you delete any user, the following screen appears asking you if you want to 
delete all the posts of that user.
You have two options while deleting a user. You can either attribute all his or her 
posts to another user or you can delete all the posts made by that user. Make a choice 
and click on the Confirm Deletion button.

Chapter 8
[ 223 ]
Restriction Plug-ins
There are several plug-ins available for setting different kinds of restriction levels in 
WordPress. In Codex, there are several plug-ins available for this.
Some of these plug-ins can hide portions of a WordPress post from unregistered 
users. Some can stick a page in the front page of WordPress and can restrict access 
from different IP addresses. Some allow administrators to restrict a specific post or 
an entire category to a group of registered users.
The WP-Members plug-in (http://butlerblog.com/wp-members/) turns your 
WordPress blog into a premium content site. It blocks content based on user login. 
The ViewLevel2 plug-in (http://blog.firetree.net/2005/08/25/viewlevel-
20/) blocks posts for users below a given level. There is another plug-in called 
Registered–Only (http://dev.wp-plugins.org/browser/registered-only/), 
which allows only registered users to view your blog.
The HideThis plug-in (http://edwards.org/2006/03/12/hidethis-v10-plugin-
for-wordpress/) hides a portion of the posts from non-registered users. Yet 
another interesting plug-in is the Freeze Users plug-in (http://txfx.net/files/
wordpress/wp_freeze_users.phps), which blocks users from changing passwords. 
This is useful if your blog has a user with an open password (sandboxing) and you 
don't want anyone to change that password.
You can get a list of the restriction plug-ins from 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/Restriction.
Summary
In this chapter, we discussed how to manage a group of users in a single blog and 
hence managing a community. Community blogging can play a very important 
role in user groups or news sites. We also learned how to manage different levels 
of privileges for users in a community. In the next chapter, we will learn how to 
develop plug-ins and widgets.


Developing Plug-ins and 
Widgets
Plug-ins for any application are small pieces of code that work on the same 
framework and API as provided by the application. You may wonder about 
the purpose and the significance of developing plug-ins. Well, the main goal of 
developing plug-ins is to extend the functionality of an application. If APIs are open, 
any third-party developer can extend the functionality of an application by creating 
plug-ins. WordPress exposes a rich set of APIs through which you can extend 
WordPress to a higher level. Developing plug-ins for WordPress is not a tough job; 
all you need to have is some PHP knowledge. Developers love WordPress because of 
its structured and beautiful set of APIs.
Widgets are also a type of plug-in, but they are developed using the widget 
framework that is created by Matt Mullenweg. Matt is the lead developer of 
WordPress and works at Automattic. The widget framework itself is developed 
using the plug-in API of WordPress. The main goal of widgets is to enrich the look 
and feel of WordPress by providing easy-to-use, draggable objects that can take user 
input and display some output based on that. Widgets are developed to decorate 
your sidebar more easily.
The widget plug-in allows you to visually add small widgets to the sidebar of your 
WordPress theme from the administration panel. You can simply drag and drop 
your available widgets into the sidebar; each of these widgets will add a special 
functionality to your WordPress outlook. Almost all widgets provide greater 
flexibility to modify your sidebar without any hassle or coding experience. In 
Chapter 7, we discussed how to make your theme widget enabled.
This chapter is basically divided into two major parts. In the first part of this 
chapter, we will discuss the basics about widgets, installing the widget plug-in, 
and developing custom widgets for our themes. In the next part, we will discuss 

Developing Plug-ins and Widgets
[ 226 ]
the basics of plug-in development and develop some small plug-ins to describe the 
process in detail.
Installing the Widget Plug-in
As explained earlier in the chapter, widgets work on the widget framework that is 
provided by the main widget plug-in. So our first task will be to install the widget 
plug-in on our WordPress blog. Firstly, download the archive of the widget plug-in 
from http://www.automattic.com. After downloading the widgets.zip file 
from www.automattic.com, extract it within the plug-ins folder that is inside the 
wp-contents directory inside your WordPress folder.
Now log into your WordPress admin panel and go to the Plugins section where you 
will find the widget plug-in appearing as Sidebar Widgets. Enable it by clicking on 
the Activate link just after the plug-in.
Creating Widgets
Widgets are basically nothing but plug-ins. However, it is important to note that 
widgets depend upon the widget framework and themes. Their dependence on 
themes is mainly because theme developers must allow the usage of widgets in their 
themes. As stated earlier, the main goal of widgets is decorating the sidebar in a 
drag-and-drop style. So if theme developers do not allow widgets in their themes, 
they won’t work. If you have the widget plug-in installed, then after setting a new 
theme you will find a menu called Sidebar Widgets under the Presentation menu. If 
that is not available, you will know that the theme doesn't support widgets. Later in 
this chapter, we will discuss how you can widgetize (that means to allow the usage 
of widgets in) your theme.
While designing a widget, you should know that a theme has two presentation 
states. One is from the admin panel and the other is what visitors will see on the 
theme. So you have to design both of these states during coding.
In this chapter, we are going to design a widget that will display any text in the 
sidebar of your WordPress blog. Though you can do unlimited things with 
widgets, you may check what other people have done with widgets at 
http://widgets.wordpress.com.

Chapter 9
[ 227 ]
Let us now create our widget through which we can add any text in our sidebar; 
let us call it Aside. In the previous chapters of this book, we designed some small 
plug-ins and we know that we must add a plug-in definition at the top of our plug-in 
code. So we are directly going to code. However, we will dissect our code in the 
next section.
<?
/*

function widget_aside_init()

Developing Plug-ins and Widgets
[ 228 ]
{
  if ( !function_exists('register_sidebar_widget') || !function_
exists('register_widget_control') )
  return;
  register_sidebar_widget('Aside', 'widget_aside_render');
  register_widget_control('Aside', 'widget_aside_admin', 350, 200);
}
function widget_aside_admin()
{
  if ($_POST['aside_submit']=='1'){
    $options['aside_title'] = $_POST['aside_title'];
    $options['aside_note'] = $_POST['aside_note'];
    update_option("widget_aside",$options);
}
  $options = get_option("widget_aside");
  if (empty($options))
  {
    $title = "Aside";
    $note = "Type your note here";
  }
  else{
    $title = $options['aside_title'];
    $note = $options['aside_note'];
  }
  echo "<div style='height: 200px'>
      <p style='text-align: left'>
      Title<br/>
      <input type='text' name='aside_title' value='{$title}'><br/>
      Note<br/>
      <textarea rows='5' cols='40' name='aside_note'>{$note}</
textarea><br/></p>
      <input type='hidden' name='aside_submit' value='1'></div>";
}
function widget_aside_render($args)
{
  extract($args);
$options = get_option("widget_aside");
  if (empty($options))
  {
    $title = "Aside";
    $note = "There is no note currently";

Chapter 9
[ 229 ]
  }
  else {
    $title = $options['aside_title'];
    $note = $options['aside_note'];
  }
  echo $before_widget;
  echo "<li><h2>{$title}</h2></li>";
  echo "<ul><li>{$note}</li></ul>";
  echo $after_widget;
}
add_action('plugins_loaded', 'widget_aside_init');
?>
Let's save this widget as aside.php in the plug-ins directory. Now you have to 
activate it from the Plugins menu inside the administration panel. You will find this 
widget as Aside as shown in the following screenshot:
Enable this widget by clicking on the Activate link. After enabling it, go to the 
Presentation menu and select Sidebar Widgets from the sub-menu. If your theme 
doesn't support widgets, you will not get the Sidebar Widgets menu. This is the way 
in which you can check if your theme supports widgets.

Developing Plug-ins and Widgets
[ 230 ]
The widget named Aside in the left pane is the widget we just developed. Since this 
theme supports widgets, we can see our widget listed here in the Available Widgets 
panel. Let us drag the widget from the left pane to the right pane and click on the 
icon just beside it. A new panel will appear with two input boxes; one is Title and 
the other is Note as shown in the following screenshot. Write anything in these 
two boxes.
Thereafter, close this panel by clicking on the X at the top-right corner and scroll 
down. Save the changes by clicking on the Save Changes button. Now browse to 
your WordPress URL and take a look at the front page sidebar.
Dissecting the Code
Let us now analyze our widget code.
A widget is simply an action plug-in that hooks the loaded plug-ins. Later in this 
chapter we will discuss hooks. After intercepting a hook, a widget just instructs 
WordPress which function to run at that point. In our first widget, we created the 
widget_aside_init() function that is responsible for widget initialization.

Chapter 9
[ 231 ]
When WordPress calls the widget_aside_init() function, we first check whether 
the widget plug-in is installed. If the widget plug-in is installed, we register our 
widget. As stated earlier, a widget has two presentation states; one is the admin state 
and the other is the display state. In the admin state, you can set different parameters 
and input data from the administration panel. In the display state, the widget 
renders some output in the sidebar that is visible to our viewers. The following two 
lines in our widget_aside_init() function are responsible for registering two 
functions for these two states of our widget:
  register_sidebar_widget('Aside', 'widget_aside_render');
  register_widget_control('Aside', 'widget_aside_admin', 350, 200);
So WordPress will execute the widget_aside_admin() function and the 
widget_aside_render() function in the admin state and the display state, 
respectively. Let us first discuss the admin state.
In this widget, we need to store the title of our widget and the note that is supplied 
by the users. The update_option() function will help us to achieve this. This 
function will store an array as a serialized object in the WordPress database. When 
you need to restore that data use the get_option() function.
In the admin state (that is in the widget_aside_admin() function) of our widget, 
we first check whether anyone has posted any update information . If so, we will 
store the data in the database. Later, we will restore the information and display it in 
two input boxes. While rendering the admin panel, ensure that you do not use any 
HTML <form> element, because WordPress already displays the information in an 
HTML form.
In the display state, there is nothing much to do; we just retrieve the information and 
display it.
While rendering data in the display state, always echo the $before_widget variable 
first, then the $before_title variable, and then your content. Finally, use the 
$after_title variable and the $after_widget variable. This is the convention 
suggested by Automattic to maintain backward compatibility with some themes.
Essential Rules
While developing widgets, please consider the following factors and always try to 
follow them:
Carefully choose the name of your widget so that it does not coincide with 
the name of an already existing one.
Carefully choose the function name inside your widget. Best practice is to use 
the namespace format while naming these functions. That is, if your widget 
•
•

Developing Plug-ins and Widgets
[ 232 ]
name is Aside, add aside_ as a prefix to all your functions. This will then 
avoid possible function name duplication. If there are two functions with the 
same name, it will not work and PHP will generate an error.
Use the namespace format in the entire form element so as to avoid the 
possibility of duplication with existing widgets.
Before creating nice widgets, we would recommend you to read the source 
code of the original widget plug-in and see how Automattic designed 
themes. This will increase your widget-creating capability.
Designing Multiple-Instance Widgets
There may be situations when you need multiple instances of your widgets. For 
example, a user may place several instances of the Aside widget in their sidebar. In 
this section, we will learn how to design widgets with multiple-instance capability.
In widgets with multiple-instance capability, you must handle each widget 
separately and individually. You must also provide a facility so that users can choose 
the number of instances of a widget. In the following example, we converted the 
Aside widget into one having multiple instances:
<?

{
  if ( !function_exists('register_sidebar_widget') || !function_
exists('register_widget_control') )
  return;
  add_action('sidebar_admin_page', 'widget_aside_page');
  add_action('sidebar_admin_setup', 'widget_aside_setup');
  widget_aside_setup();
}
function widget_aside_setup()
{
  //echo "accessed";
  if ($_POST['aside_number_submit']=='1')

[ 233 ]
  {
    $number_of_asides = $_POST['number_of_asides'];
    update_option("widget_aside_number",$number_of_asides);
  }
  $number_of_asides = get_option("widget_aside_number")+1;
  for ($i=1; $i<$number_of_asides; $i++)
  {
    $name = array('Aside %s', null, $i);
    register_sidebar_widget("Aside {$i}", 'widget_aside_render', $i);
    register_widget_control("Aside {$i}", 'widget_aside_admin', 350, 
200,$i);
  }
  for ($i=$number_of_asides; $i<6; $i++)
  {
    register_sidebar_widget("Aside {$i}", '', $i);
    register_widget_control("Aside {$i}", '', 350, 200,$i);
  }
}
function widget_aside_page() {
  $options = $newoptions = get_option('widget_aside');
?>
  <div class="wrap">
    <form method="POST">
      <h2>Aside Widgets</h2>
      <p>How many aside widgets would you like?
      <select name='number_of_asides'>
        <?
          for($i=1; $i<6; $i++)
          echo "<option value={$i}>{$i}</option>";
        ?>
      </select>
      <span class="submit"><input type='hidden' name = 'aside_number_

}
function widget_aside_admin($args)
{
  $widget_id = $args;
  if ($_POST['aside_submit']=='1'){

Developing Plug-ins and Widgets
[ 234 ]
    $current_widget_id = $widget_id;//$_POST['aside_id'];
    $options['aside_title'] = $_POST["aside_title{
                                                $current_widget_id}"];
    $options['aside_note'] = $_POST["aside_note{$current_widget_id}"];
    
  update_option("widget_aside{$current_widget_id}",$options);
  }
  $options = get_option("widget_aside{$widget_id}");
  if (empty($options))
  {
    $title = "Aside";
    $note = "Type your note here";
  }
  else {
    $title = $options['aside_title'];
    $note = $options['aside_note'];
  }
  echo "<div stle='height: 200px'>
      <p style='text-align: left'>
      Title<br/>
      <input type='text' name='aside_title{$widget_id}' 
                                               value='{$title}'><br/>
      Note<br/>
      <textarea rows='5' cols='40' name='aside_note{
                             $widget_id}'>{$note}</textarea><br/></p>
      <input type='hidden' name='aside_submit' value='1'>
      <input type='hidden' name='aside_id' value='{$widget_id}'>
      </div>";
}
function widget_aside_render($args,$id)
{
  extract($args);
  $widget_id = $id;
  $options = get_option("widget_aside{$widget_id}");
  if (empty($options))
  {
    $title = "Aside";
    $note = "There is no note currently";
  }
  else {
    $title = $options['aside_title'];
    $note = $options['aside_note'];
  }

  echo $before_widget;
  echo $before_title;
  echo "<h2>{$title}</h2>";
  echo "<ul><li>{$note}</li></ul>";
  echo $after_title;
  echo $after_widget;
}
add_action('plugins_loaded', 'widget_aside_init');
?>
Now if you scroll down the Sidebar Widgets page, you will find that you can specify 
the number of instances of the Aside widget from a drop-down combo box.
The above portion is rendered by the widget_aside_page() function. If you 
take a look at the code, you will find that the widget_aside_page() function 
executes by hooking the sidebar_admin_page action in the format 
add_action('sidebar_admin_page', 'widget_aside_page').
The following form is managed using the widget_aside_setup() function 
by hooking the sidebar_admin_setup action in the format 
add_action('sidebar_admin_setup', 'widget_aside_setup').

Developing Plug-ins and Widgets
[ 236 ]
If you take a look at your WordPress blog now, you will find that all the instances of 
the Aside widget are rendered correctly.
Third-Party Widgets
For some more widgets, you can visit the following URLs:

Plug-ins
Writing a plug-in is easier than writing a widget. To avoid confusion, a widget 
is basically a kind of plug-in that executes with the help of the widget plug-in 
developed by Automattic. In this section, we will understand how plug-ins function 
in WordPress and how we can develop one on our own.
Plug-ins are simple PHP functions that are invoked at some specific event. Plug-in 
developers specify those events and ping the WordPress engine to register their 
plug-in for running at those events. These events are called hooks. WordPress has 
many hooks inside it and those are documented in Codex, the main documentation 
repository. By intercepting those hooks, you can simply do magic with WordPress. 
If you are not sure what you can do, take a look at the Tiger Admin panel, which is a 
replacement of the default WordPress administration panel.

Let us develop a simple plug-in and we will learn through that.
Plug-in: RSS Processor
The RSS processor is a simple plug-in that fetches RSS feeds from a remote site and 
displays the feed title along with the feed URL. Users will be able to fetch as many 
RSS feed URLs as they want in each single post and page.
If a user adds the RSS URL in the following format, then only this plug-in will 
work. The user can also specify how many feeds they want to display through this 
URL. The format also specifies that the visitors will see the latest five posts from the 
phpExperts Yahoo group.
{rss uri='http://groups.yahoo.com/group/phpexperts/rss' limit='5'}
In this plug-in, we are going to use LastRSS, which is an RSS-processing class 
developed in PHP. You can download the class from http://lastrss.webdot.cz.

Let us use this plug-in and make a sample post in our blog. Prior to that, remember 
to activate the plug-in.
Now if you access the blog, you will see that the remote content has been fetched and 
displayed properly.

Hooks
Hooks are the main means through which plug-ins work. Hooks are a kind of event 
in the WordPress execution process that you can intercept to inject a function to work 
in that event. There are two types of hooks, namely action hooks and filter hooks. 
Action hooks take place when some action occurs, for example when someone makes 
a post, an action hook will be triggered. Action hooks won't ask for any information 
to be returned to WordPress. They only specify that an action has occurred. Filter 
hooks are similar, but they return information back to WordPress. For example, 
WordPress will pass the content of a post to your plug-in and you may change it, 
modify it, and then return the content to WordPress.
Understanding Hooks
The preceding RSS plug-in works using a filter hook. It intercepts at the 
the_content hook, which returns the content of the post. Let us create another 
plug-in that will filter blacklisted words in the user-defined list and replace them 
with *****. We will hook the pre_comment_content filter that occurs just before 
saving the content of the comment in the database. The following code achieves 
this functionality:
<?
/*
Plugin Name: Blacklisted Words Remover
Plugin URI: NA
Description: A sample plug-in for WordPress book

Chapter 9
[ 241 ]
Author: Hasin Hayder
Version: 1.0
Author URI: http://hasin.phpxperts.com
*/
?>
<?
add_filter('pre_comment_content', 'blacklist_process');
function blacklist_process($content
{
  $blacklist = array("sample1", "sample2", "sample3", "sample4");
  foreach($blacklist as $bword)
  {
    $content = str_replace($bword, "******", $content);
  }
  return $content;
}
?>
So when someone makes a comment as shown in the following screenshot, the 
output will be like the next screenshot shown overleaf.

After posting this comment, take a look at the blog:
I hope you now understand how these plug-ins work with action and filter hooks.
Automated Installation of Plug-ins with DB 
Access
If your plug-in has to access the database, there are several choices. You may 
supply the SQL statements necessary to create tables according to the requirement 
of your plug-in. The blog admin will then manually execute those SQL statements 
to make your plug-in work. However, if you do this, your blog admin may not be 
experienced enough to manage these database operations. So you have to think of an 
alternative idea.
Fortunately, in WordPress plug-ins can automate the whole process. That is, when 
someone activates your plug-in, you can capture that event and check whether the 
necessary tables exist in the database. If not, you will execute the necessary SQL 
statements to create the required tables. The entire process is transparent and your 
users need not bother about the installation.
In order to check the event when someone activates a plug-in, let us use the 
following code:
  if (isset($_GET['activate']) && $_GET['activate'] == 'true') {
    //Now you are in the activation event. Do the database operation 
       //here
    
  }
Let us create a simple plug-in that stores all the searched keywords in our WordPress 
blog into a database table. Table structure will be as follows:
table wp_searchedwords:
Field
Type
Null
Key
Default
Extra
id
int(11)
YES
PRI
NULL
auto_increment
word
varchar(255)
NULL

Chapter 9
[ 243 ]
When someone conducts a search, WordPress receives a GET request where the 
variable name is s; so the $_GET['s'] parameter describes the searched for words. 
To process any $_GET or $_POST parameter, we should hook the init action hook. 
Let us take a look at the following plug-in code:
<?
/*
Plugin Name: Searched Words
Plugin URI: NA
Description: A sample plug-in for WordPress book
Author: Hasin Hayder
Version: 1.0
Author URI: http://hasin.phpxperts.com
*/
?>
<?
add_filter('init', 'searchedwords_init');
add_action("admin_menu","admin_menu");
function searchedwords_init($content)
{
  if (isset($_GET['activate']) && $_GET['activate'] == 'true') {
    global $wpdb;
    $result = mysql_list_tables(DB_NAME);
    $current_tables = array();
    while ($row = mysql_fetch_row($result)) {
      $current_tables[] = $row[0];
    }
    if (!in_array("wp_searchedwords", $current_tables))
    {
      $result = mysql_query(
                            "CREATE TABLE`wp_searchedwords
                                          (id INT NOT NULL
                                           AUTO_INCREMENT
                                           PRIMARY KEY,
                                           word VARCHAR(255)
                                           )");
    }
  }
  if (!empty($_GET['s']))
  {

Developing Plug-ins and Widgets
[ 244 ]
    $current_searched_words = explode(" ",urldecode($_GET['s']));
    foreach ($current_searched_words as $word)
    {
      mysql_query("insert into wp_searchedwords values(null, 
'{$word}')");
    }
  }
}
function admin()
{
  echo "<div class='wrap'>";
  $result = mysql_query("select count(word) as occurance, word from 
wp_searchedwords group by word order by occurance DESC");
  echo "<h2>Top Searched Words</h2>";
  if (mysql_num_rows($result)>0)
  {
  while ($row = mysql_fetch_row($result))
  {
    echo "People searched for <b>{$row[1]}</b> for {$row[0]} 
time(s)<br/>";
  }
  }
  else {
    echo "<h3>Sorry - No searchword found</h3>";
  }
  echo "</div>";
}
function admin_menu()
{
  if (function_exists('add_submenu_page')) {
    add_submenu_page('index.php',  "Searched Keywords",  "Searched 
Keywords", 1, 'searchedwords.plugin.php', 'admin');
  }
}
?>
Save this plug-in as searchedwords.plugin.php in the plug-in folder of WordPress 
and activate it from the Plugins menu. As soon as you activate the plug-in, it creates 
a wp_searchedwords table in your WordPress blog database as follows:

Chapter 9
[ 245 ]
Moreover, as soon as you activate the plug-in, go to the Dashboard to find an extra 
menu called Searched Keywords.
Now if you click on this Searched Keywords menu for the first time, you will find 
the following screen:
The preceding screen shows that no keywords are found because this is our first 
time. Since no one searched for anything in our blog, the table is empty. Now let us 
search for something in our blog from the search box in the sidebar and come back to 
this Searched Keywords page. Now you will see the actual result.

Developing Plug-ins and Widgets
[ 246 ]
In this plug-in, we also introduced how to add admin pages inside the WordPress 
admin panel. Let us analyze the code and see what has actually happened.
Dissecting the Code
Firstly, we hooked the init action hook to process the request parameters and then 
we hooked the admin_menu hook to add our admin page.
add_filter('init', 'searchedwords_init');
add_action("admin_menu","admin_menu");
Thereafter, WordPress will access the searchedwords_init function inside our 
plug-in. In this function, we first check if the wp_searchedwords table exists in the 
WordPress database. If not, we will create this table.
We then check if there are any search requests. If available, we just store them in the 
database.
To add the admin page, we used the admin_menu() function. In this function, we 
added a function in the index page (dashboard).
add_submenu_page('index.php',  "Searched Keywords",  "Searched 
Keywords", 1, 'searchedwords.plugin.php', 'admin');
The format of this function is as follows:
function add_submenu_page($parent, $page_title, $menu_title, $access_
level, $file, $function = '')
So our code just adds an admin menu called Searched Keywords under the 
Dashboard section that will access the admin() function of searchedwords.plugin.
php, which is our plug-in file.
In the admin() function, we just analyze our database and display the searched 
keywords in ascending order. This function will be accessed each time anyone clicks 
on Searched Keywords from the admin panel.
Common Hook List
There are hundreds of hooks available in WordPress. It is not possible to cover all of 
them in this small book. However, you can visit the online reference of these hooks 
for further study. For most common hooks browse the following URLs:

Summary
Extending an existing system is always an interesting and challenging job. You have 
to care about the existing code base and structure and extend it in such a way that 
the design does not collapse after merging those extensions. This chapter discusses 
extending WordPress in detail by developing plug-ins and widgets. This chapter also 
shows us how to design widgets with multiple-instance support.
Extending WordPress is like a never-ending adventure. These days many services 
are published with an extremely simple set of APIs and we can integrate many 
of those into our WordPress blog. So reading this chapter will help you start this 
amazing journey by yourself.

Administrator's Reference
While blogging, various troubles may arise. You should have the proper knowledge 
to troubleshoot these problems. Moreover, having some advanced experience with 
WordPress will save your time in need. This chapter will give you an advanced view 
of WordPress, help you to troubleshoot problems, and give you a closer look at the 
ins and outs of WordPress.
System Requirements
Although WordPress usually works pretty well with LAMP and WAMP (LAMP 
stands for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP, and WAMP stands for Windows-Apache-
MySQL-PHP), there are several issues with both these platforms. We will have a 
closer look at these issues in this section.
WordPress requires a web server that can run PHP with the support of MySQL to 
function properly. The best web servers that work with PHP are Apache, IIS, and 
LiteSpeed. Let us take a look at the requirements here:
Web Server: Apache, LiteSpeed, or IIS 
(http://httpd.apache.org/, http://litespeedtech.com/, http://www.iis.net/)
PHP: Version 4.2 or later
MySQL: 3.23.23 or greater
If you want to have permalinks with custom URLs enabled in your blog, you must 
have Apache web server with mod_rewrite enabled in your server. If mod_rewrite 
is not available, the permalink URL may not look so friendly. However, in most cases 
Apache mod_rewrite is installed on web hosting accounts. You may mail to your 
system administrator if you don't have it installed on your account.

A Closer Look at the Installation
In Chapter 2, we discussed how you can install WordPress locally as well as 
remotely. We also saw how to install WordPress from cPanels. In this section, we 
will have a closer look at the other important topics of installation like upgrading 
WordPress, migrating WordPress data from one server to another, installing 
WordPress for a multi-user environment, setting file permissions, uninstalling 
WordPress, different kinds of troubleshooting during these processes, and finally 
backing up files and database of WordPress.
Upgrading WordPress
You may have an older version of WordPress installed on your machine like 1.5.x 
or even 1.2.x, and may already have a stable blog running. So choosing a new 
installation will not be a wise decision in these cases. The best option is upgrading 
your old WordPress installation to the new version, without losing your data and 
other files. Let us see how we can upgrade WordPress.
To upgrade, you have to follow the following steps. The process would also be 
similar if you want to upgrade from the 2.x version to a higher one.
Step 1: Back Up your Database
Before upgrading WordPress, we must back up our existing database. There is no 
assurance that nothing will go wrong. Thus, we should better avoid the risk of losing 
our database.
This is a most important step that you must do with proper attention. You can use 
any MySQL front-end like MySQL-front, phpMyAdmin, or even MySQL client for 
backing up your database. Please refer to the Backups section later in this chapter to 
know how to back up your WordPress database.
Step 2: Back Up your WordPress Files
Before proceeding further, you must perform one more backup. You must back up 
all the WordPress files including plug-ins, themes, and .htaccess files. You can do 
this by logging into your WordPress directory using an FTP client. We will discuss 
these in details later in this chapter in the Backing Up WordPress Files section.
Step 3: Verifying the Backups
After performing the backups, the major step is to verify whether the backed up files 
are OK and usable. If they were interrupted while downloading, they may not be 
usable in many cases. In that case, there is a great risk of losing all your data.
So always verify your backup files. Remember not to skip this step.

Chapter 10
[ 251 ]
Step 4: Deactivate All Your Plug-ins
The plug-ins that are working with the current installation of WordPress on your 
machine may not work with the upgraded installation of WordPress. If a plug-in 
breaks, your WordPress installation will not work as well. So before upgrading 
WordPress, you must deactivate all the active plug-ins.
To deactivate plug-ins, log into your WordPress administration panel and click on 
the Plugins menu. If you are using WordPress 1.5.x, you will see a screen similar to 
the following:
On the right side of this page, you can deactivate all the active plug-ins by clicking 
on the Deactivate links.
Step 5: Download and Extract WordPress
Now download the WordPress ZIP file onto your machine. If you have shell access, 
then you can also download WordPress in the web directory.
After downloading WordPress, extract all the files in a new folder named 
WordPress. If you are using Windows, then you can right-click on the ZIP file and 
extract using WinZip/WinRar software. If you are using *nix, then unzip all the files 
using the gunzip command.
gunzip -c wordpressfilename.zip | tar -xf – 
If you downloaded tarballs, you can use the following command:
using: tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz

Administrator's Reference
[ 252 ]
Step 6: Delete Old Files
Now delete all the files of your previous WordPress installation except the following 
listed files and directories. You can use any FTP client for deleting these files. You 
can also use shell commands. If you don't have an FTP client, you can use the best 
web-based FTP program: Net2FTP.
wp-config.php file
wp-content folder
wp-images folder
If you used a specific language pack, then don't delete the wp-includes/
languages/ folder
If you used custom mod_rewrite or permalinks, then don't delete the 
.htaccess files
wp-content/plugins folder, if you used custom plug-ins
wp-content/themes folder, if you had custom themes
If you have shell access, then use the following commands to delete the unnecessary 
files. The command sequences have been taken directly from WordPress Help. These 
commands place the necessary files inside a folder named backup in the current 
directory.
mkdir backup
cp wp-config.php .htaccess wp-layout.css index.php wp-comments.
php wp-comments-popup.php backup
cp -R wp-content backup
rm wp*.php wp-layout.css .htaccess
rm -rf wp-admin wp-images wp-includes
cp backup/wp-config.php
The third command, cp -R wp-content backup, copies the whole wp-content folder 
recursively inside the backup folder. So you can always restore any necessary files 
from this backup folder.
Log into your WordPress hosting account from any FTP client (for example, 
Filezilla). You will see something like this:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Chapter 10
[ 253 ]
Now right-click on the folder that you wish to delete, for example wp-admin, and hit 
the Delete key. It will be deleted instantly.
Deleting Folders Using Net2FTP
Net2FTP is one of the best web-based FTP programs and is an open-source script 
developed using PHP. The official Net2FTP site hosts this script. So you can perform 
FTP operation using this site at no cost at all.
To start the FTP operation, point your browser to http://www.net2ftp.com. You 
will find a login panel on the left-hand side.
Log into your WordPress FTP account using your username and password. If your 
login is successful, you will see something like the following page:

Administrator's Reference
[ 254 ]
At the upper-right corner, which is outlined, you will find the necessary buttons for 
file manipulation. Please note that there is a checkbox on the left-hand side of every 
folder. Clicking on the folder named wordpress, you will get into the WordPress 
folder immediately. Now, to delete the wp-admin folder, check the checkbox just 
beside the wp—admin folder. Click on the Delete button from the upper-right 
portion of this page. You will be redirected to a page like the following:
Finally, click on the button outlined.
Step 7: Upload the New Files
Connect to your WordPress host directory using your FTP client or Net2FTP 
and then upload the new files you extracted in Step 5. Using Net2FTP, you can 
directly upload the ZIP file or tarball, and Net2FTP will extract it immediately after 
uploading it to the current directory. You can upload all the files using any FTP 
client. If you have shell access, you can even upload the ZIP file or tarball and then 
extract it using shell commands as shown in Step 5.

Chapter 10
[ 255 ]
Just remember that when you upload using Net2FTP, some files in your old 
WordPress installation will be overwritten by some of the new ones and that is 
recommended. If you use any FTP client, allow it to overwrite.
Step 8: Run the WordPress Upgrade Program
After completing the preceding seven steps, now it's finally time to run the 
upgrade script. Point your browser to http://your_wordpress_directory/
wp-admin/upgrade.php.
Click on the Upgrade WordPress link.
That's it, you are done. Now you can log in using your old username and password. 
Upgrading WordPress is an absolutely hassle-free process.
Step 9: Update Permalinks and .htaccess
If you were using permalink settings in your previous installation, please log into 
your upgraded WordPress as the administrator and update the well formatted 
permalink structure as in the previous installation. In this case, you have to update 
the .htaccess file of the current installation to the version that your old WordPress 
installation used.

Administrator's Reference
[ 256 ]
Step 10: Install Updated Plug-ins and Themes
Make a list of your plug-ins that were running with the previous version of 
WordPress. The WordPress community makes a comprehensive list of plug-ins that 
are compatible with an upgraded version. Visit the URL and download all the
up-to-date versions of your plug-ins (http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/
2.0_Plugin_Compatibility).
Step 11: Reactivate Plug-ins
If everything runs OK and completed successfully, it's time to reactivate plug-ins. 
You can do it by logging in as the administrator, and then going to the plug-ins 
menu. It is recommended to activate plug-ins one by one and see whether it still 
works correctly or not. If any problem occurs, consider that plug-in as not compatible 
with this upgraded version of WordPress.
Migrating WordPress
Sometimes you may have to move from one server to another. If it was not possible 
to move your blog, all your blogging efforts would be worthless. This migration 
could be of two types:
Migration within your server, that is from one directory to another directory
Migration to another server
Fortunately, WordPress provides ways to migrate your blog. Here we discuss both 
cases of migration.
Migrating within the Same Site
For migrating within the same site, follow these steps:
Create the directory where you want to move this installation
Log into your old blog as administrator
Select the Options menu, and then select the General sub-menu. You will get 
the following screen:
•
•
•
•
•

Chapter 10
[ 257 ]
Now let us assume that we are moving WordPress from this wordpress folder to the 
wp2 folder.
1.	 Change the WordPress address to the new location, for example 
http://phpxperts.net/wp2.
2.	 Change the blog address URI to the new location, for example 
http://phpxperts.net/wp2.
3.	 Save the options by clicking the Update Options button.
4.	 Log out from your admin panel.
5.	 Copy your files to the new location.
6.	 Now visit the new location.
Migrating from One Server to Another
For migrating WordPress from one server to another, follow these steps:
1.	 Make a back up of your existing database; we have to edit this SQL file later.
2.	 Back up all files in your WordPress folder to a back up folder.
3.	 Open the wp-config.php file from your existing WordPress directory.

Administrator's Reference
[ 258 ]
Edit the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth lines according to the database name, 
database username, database password, and the hostname of your new 
server. Mostly, you don’t need to change the hostname.
4.	 Open the SQL file that you created while backing up the WordPress 
database. Replace all instances of your old WordPress URL with the new 
one. For example, if your existing WordPress URL is http://olddomain/
wordpress and your new URL is http://newdomain/wordpress, then 
replace all instances of http://olddomain/wordpress inside your SQL file 
with http://newdomain/wordpress. You can do this using any text editor. 
Save this modified version of your SQL file.
5.	 Upload all your WordPress files from the old installation to the new 
directory. Don't miss any file. Keep them as is.
6.	 Now restore the database using the modified version of your SQL file. If you 
don't know how to restore database from SQL files, read the Restoring the 
Database from a Backup section that comes later in this chapter.
7.	 Open phpMyAdmin (or connect to the new server's MySQL host using any 
MySQL client), select the new WordPress database that you just restored, and 
run the following SQL command:
	
update wp_options set option_value='new_wordpress_URL'
	
where option_name='siteurl' and option_value='home'
You can run SQL by clicking on the SQL tab in the top-right pane. A practical 
example could be something like this:
update wp_options set option_value='http://newdomain/wordpress'
where option_name='siteurl' and option_value='home'

Chapter 10
[ 259 ]
8.	 Change the permissions of your wp-content folder to rwxrwxrwx 777 for file 
upload facility.
9.	 You have to find out the absolute path of your WordPress folder in the 
server. You can do this by running a PHP file inside your WordPress 
wp‑content folder. The code of this PHP file is: <? echo getcwd(); ?>. Now 
execute this file using your browser. For example, if the output is something 
like home\user\phpxperts\htdocs\wordpress, then run the following SQL 
command in phpMyAdmin:

update wp_options set option_value= 'home\user\phpxperts\htdocs\
wordpress' where option_name= 'fileupload_realpath'
10.	 Now open your .htaccess file and see if it is blank or not. If blank, then you 
can copy your old .htaccess file here.
11.	 Browse the new URL of your migrated WordPress.
Multiple Installations
A multi-user environment is a WordPress hosting environment where a lot of users 
can register and blog separately. Each of them will get their own blog. All blogs run 
independently of one another. If you set up a multi-user environment, then you can 
host blogs for a lot of users.
There are different techniques to set up a multi-user environment for WordPress:
Using different databases
Using a single database
Using third-party solutions
Using different databases, you can set up as many blogs as you want. This is just 
normally installing WordPress under the same domain by modifying the wp-
config.php file. However, this technique depends upon your hosting facilities. If 
you have limited database options, then it is not the best solution for you.
Using single database, you can install as many WordPress blogs as you want. You 
can do this by just changing the table prefix in the wp-config.php file.

Administrator's Reference
[ 260 ]
The preceding screenshot shows a typical wp-config.php file. You can have many 
WordPress installations under the same database by changing the ninth line. Make 
the $table_prefix different for different users. That's it.
The final solution for setting up a multi-user environment is using third-party 
solutions. WordPress community develops a different version of WordPress just 
for setting up a multi-user blogging environment. This is called WordPress MU. 
WordPress MU is derived from the words WordPress multi-user.
WordPress MU
WordPress MU is a different product, which is maintained and developed separately. 
This version of WordPress is not supported officially and not maintained for general 
users. So the development process is a bit slow. Moreover, there are some complexities 
in maintaining and installing WordPress MU. So it is not a WordPress version for all 
bloggers. If you are an advanced user, you can take up the challenge.
WordPress MU is the ultimate solution for a multi-user environment. Although, it 
offers limited functionality and limited themes and plug-ins, WordPress MU offers 
the ability to manage each blog separately and securely. The famous multi-user blog 
hosts WordPress.com, edublogs.org, PRblogs.org, Bloggoing.com, Blogsome.com, 
and WeblogUP.com are all powered by WordPress MU.
Benefits of Using WordPress MU
There are several benefits of using WordPress MU. If you are a general blogger, then 
the benefits for you are:
You can set up your own blog without any hassle or knowing anything. You 
don't even have to edit any configuration files. Just register your username 
and start blogging instantly.
Built-in comment spam protection.

System Requirements for WordPress MU
WordPress MU requires everything that is required by WordPress itself. Besides, 
WordPress MU requires something more to run. Let us take a look at the requirements:
Web Server: Apache or Lightship or IIS
PHP: Version 4.2 or later
MySQL: 3.23.23 or greater
Smarty template engine, which is included with WordPress MU by default.
Apache mod_rewrite
Apache Symlinks. Wordpress MU developers have said that they will remove the 
necessity for this package in later versions.
Installing WordPress MU
Download the WordPress MU ZIP file from the website at http://mu.wordpress.
org. WordPress MU is still released as an unstable version and is under serious 
development. So the ZIP archive is named as wpmu-unstable.zip. Extract all the 
files from this archive to your WordPress directory using any FTP client.
Create a MySQL database for installing WordPress MU. Let us assume it is wpmu.
Point your browser to the WordPress MU URL. When the page comes for the first 
time, you will see that it prompts for a new installation.
On the lower portion of this page, you will see a form to input necessary database 
parameters. Please input all necessary parameters. Ensure that the permission to 
your wp-config.php file is writable or is set to 766 for your user account. Finally, 
click on Submit.

Administrator's Reference
[ 262 ]
Please input your blog title. This is the main WordPress MU account. After inserting 
the necessary data, please click Submit for the final step.
That's it! Installation of WordPress MU is complete. The password and all the 
necessary information will be sent to your email account that you provided in the 
second step.

Chapter 10
[ 263 ]
After installing, you can customize the look of your WordPress MU page by editing 
wordpressmu_path/wp-content/themese/home/home.php.
Installing Other People's Blogs in 
WordPress MU
You have just finished installing the WordPress multi-user version. Other people 
may now want to set up their blogs in WordPress MU. When they visit your 
WordPress MU page, they will see the following screen:

Administrator's Reference
[ 264 ]
Please note that there are two links for logging into WPMU admin panel. One link is 
the usual login link, and another is to set up a new blog. When visitors click on this, 
they can set up their own blogs. Let us take a look at this page.
Their blog is just one step away. Click on the Sign up button and it's done! They will 
get their administration information at the email address they provided. If the blog 
setup is successful, they will be redirected to the next page:
So setting up multiple blogs using WordPress MU is very easy.
Uninstalling WordPress
If you want to uninstall WordPress from your machine, it's an easy and hassle-free 
process. Follow these steps to uninstall WordPress from your machine:
Make a back up for your database.
Make a back up of your WordPress files, if you may ever want to start from 
your old blog.
•
•

Chapter 10
[ 265 ]
Delete the WordPress directory. If you have shell access and proper privilege, 
apply this shell command in your shell:
rm -rf your_wordpress_directory
Log into MySQL using phpMyAdmin or any MySQL client. If you 
have privilege to delete the database, then apply the following SQL 
command for deleting your WordPress database: DROP DATABASE 
your_wordpress_database.
In phpMyAdmin, you may not have the privilege to execute the DROP DATABASE 
statement. In that case, select your database and click on the Drop link at the 
upper-right corner of the right pane as shown in the following screenshot:
If you don't have proper privilege to delete your database or you installed 
WordPress in a common database that you use for other purposes also, then delete 
the following tables. Here I assume that your tables are prefixed by wp_:
wp_categories
wp_comments
wp_linkcategories
wp_links
wp_options
wp_post2cat
wp_postmeta
wp_posts
wp_usermeta
wp_users
You can delete any table using the DROP TABLE SQL command. For example, if you 
want to delete the wp_categories table, apply the following SQL command:
DROP TABLE wp_categories
Be sure before deleting these files.

Setting File Permissions
To install and maintain WordPress properly, you may need to change permissions 
to different files and folders in the WordPress directory. If you are using a Windows 
operating system, then file permission does not matter. However for Linux, 
permission does matter. If you don't set proper permissions, you may not be able to 
install WordPress and it will not function properly.
File permissions are settings that indicate who is privileged to do what. That is, in 
Linux some users may alter the content of a file, some may just read it, or some may 
not even have read or write access. Besides read/write permissions, there are also 
"execute" permissions. If a file is an executable file, then this permission indicates 
who can execute the file. Before setting permissions for WordPress, let's discuss the 
significance of the following files and folders:
/ or root: This is the root directory that contains all WordPress files and 
folders. If your WordPress directory resides on \home\user\hasin\web\
htdocs\wp, then your root directory for WordPress is the wp folder. All the 
files in this directory must be writable only by you.
/wp-admin: This folder contains all the functions and files required for 
administering WordPress. This folder must be writable by general users, or 
at least by users who have privileges to upload plug-ins or modify themes.
/wp-includes: This is the place where all WordPress core files reside. This 
folder must be writable by the owner, which means "you".
/wp-content: This is the folder that contains user files like themes, plug‑ins, 
uploaded images, etc. This must be writable by your user account.
/wp-content/themes: This is the folder that contains themes. If you use the 
custom theme editor that comes with WordPress, you may set this folder to 
writable.
/wp-content/plugins: This is the folder that contains plug-ins. This folder 
may or may not be writable, depending upon the plug-ins you use.
/.htaccess: If you decide to use custom permalinks, this must be writable 
by your user account. If you allow custom permalinks or formatted URLs 
managed automatically by WordPress, you must give write permission to 
this file.

How to Set Permissions
You can change permissions to files and folders using any FTP client. If you have 
shell access, you can even apply shell commands for changing file permissions. Let 
us see how we can change file permissions using the popular web-based FTP script 
Net2FTP.
After logging into your hosting account using Net2FTP, you can see a button named 
Chmod at the top-right corner. Select the folder by checking the checkbox beside 
the name of the folder for which you want to change permission and click on that 
Chmod button. The following screen will appear:

Administrator's Reference
[ 268 ]
Select the permissions by checking the checkboxes or by writing the value manually 
(for example, 776 here) and select the green arrow image at the top. You are done!
If you are using shell, change the file permissions with the chmod command. For 
example, the wp-admin folder should be set as rwxr--r-- or 0744. For example, see 
the following command:
chmod –R wp-admin 0744
If you are using an FTP client (for example, Filezilla), you may change permissions as 
follows.
After logging into your WordPress hosting account, open your WordPress root 
directory. You will see something like this in your FTP software (I use Filezilla here):
This is the root folder. Now for example, to change the permission for the wp-admin 
folder, right‑click on this folder and select File Attributes:

Chapter 10
[ 269 ]
Now a dialog box prompts for file permissions. Check the permissions boxes as 
shown in the following screenshot:
 
Click OK, and you are done. Change permissions for other folders in the same way.
Troubleshooting
In this section, we will discuss the problems that may arise during the installation 
and execution of WordPress and provide solutions for troubleshooting them.
Troubleshooting during Installation
During installation, different problems may arise. If you are familiar with them, you 
may sort them quickly, without hunting around for solutions. Most of the problems 
discussed here have been taken from the WordPress installation FAQs (Frequently 
Asked Questions) and Troubleshooting FAQs.
Problem: Headers Already Sent
Sometimes, when you point your browser to the blog, you may get an error that 
displays a headers already sent message on your page. The whole page may look 
scrambled and it will not function.
WordPress uses PHP session functions. If anything is displayed before these session 
functions, which may even be a blank space, then the session functions will not 
work properly because your browser has already received all headers and it starts 
displaying the output. In such circumstances, this error may occur.

Administrator's Reference
[ 270 ]
You have to figure out where the error has occurred. Most of the time, it is a file that 
you have edited manually. If you remember, you edited the wp-config.php file 
while installing WordPress. Open the file with your text editor and make sure that 
there is nothing before the <? at the first line and after the ?> at the last line. Now 
save this file, upload it to your WordPress directory, and refresh your page again.
Problem: Page Comes with Only PHP Code
This could only happen when your server cannot parse PHP properly. This is a 
problem of your server configuration; either PHP is not installed on your server or 
it is not configured to function properly. To solve this problem, contact the system 
administrator for your server or try installing PHP.
Problem: Cannot Connect MySQL Database
If WordPress cannot connect to the MySQL database, it shows a page like the 
following screen:
To solve this problem, open your wp-config.php file and check whether the 
database parameters are correct. If you are sure that these settings are fine, please 
check if the MySQL daemon/service is running properly. If MySQL is not running, 
run this service. If MySQL was running, try restarting the service.
In MySQL version 4.1 and later, password encryption settings have been changed 
a bit, so PHP cannot connect to some versions of MySQL. If you are sure that your 
database parameters are fine and MySQL is also running, then connect to MySQL 
using your MySQL command-line tool and apply these commands:
set password = OLD_PASSWORD('your_current_password');
flush privileges;
This will use old encryption of passwords so that PHP can connect to MySQL. For 
example, let's assume my current database password is root with new encryption 

Chapter 10
[ 271 ]
settings. I want to change it to old encryption settings. The following screenshot 
illustrates this:
Basic Troubleshooting 
The best place where you can find help for WordPress is its own help system, 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Troubleshooting. No other site is comparable 
with it. Following are some basic and common problems that you may face while 
using WordPress.
Problem: Cannot See Posts, All It Says is Search Doesn't 
Meet Criteria
This could happen because of caching. For example, you have searched once and 
WordPress stored the search result inside its cache. So every time you visit the 
page you see the old result. You can solve this problem by clearing the cache and 
cookies from your browser. For this problem, you may also check search.php and 
index.php for errors.
Problem: I Want to Make My Blog Totally Private
If you are running your blog for a personal and private group or for your own 
official department so that only members of your group can see it, then you would 
want to secure it with some kind of authentication. WordPress has no built-in facility 
to do it. All you have to do is modify your .htaccess file to enable basic HTTP 
authentication. For that, you have to create the htpasswd file using the htpasswd 
command in Linux. If you are using Windows, then search in Google for htpasswd.
exe and download it from a reliable location.
Let's create the htpasswd file by applying the following command in your 
command line:
htpasswd -cm .htpasswd myusername
This htpasswd command is a command-line tool available in all Linux distributions 
by default. Immediately after applying this command, the command-line tool will 
prompt you for a password; type your password. Please note that an htpasswd file 
containing the encrypted password has been created in the current working 

Administrator's Reference
[ 272 ]
directory for user 'username'. Copy that file to your WordPress folder. The htpasswd 
file itself is of no use, until you tell Apache what to do with it. So let us create a 
.htaccess file in your WordPress folder with the following content, which will tell 
Apache to turn on basic HTTP authentication using that htpasswd file:
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Restricted Area"
AuthUserFile "absolute_url_of_your_.htpasswd_file"
require valid-user
Save this file inside your WordPress directory as .htaccess. Now whenever 
you browse this WordPress URL using your browser, it requires the username 
and password that you created previously. You must supply the absolute URL 
of the htpasswd file in the .htaccess file; it will not work with a relative URL. 
For example, if your WordPress folder is located inside the /home/youraccount/
public_html/wordpress folder, then the location of the .htpasswd file should be 
/home/youraccount/public_html/wordpress/.htpasswd.
If you have trouble retrieving this absolute path, then please don't worry. Create a 
PHP file inside this WordPress folder with the following code:
<? phpinfo(); ?>
Now run this file. You will see a page with a lot of text. Search for the 
text _SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"], and you will find the absolute URL of this 
folder on the right-hand side of it. See the following screenshot:
Problem: I Don't Receive The Emailed Passwords
This problem may happen if your web server has no SMTP server installed, or if the 
mail function is explicitly disabled. Please contact your system administrator or try 
installing sendmail (or any other mail server) properly. It should work.
Problem: I Am Getting A Lot of Comment Spam
Please block comment spam by using black-listed words, which we would have 
discussed in Chapter 4 under the section Fighting with Comment Spams.
However, discussing all these problems will not be a wise idea because we need one 
or two separate chapters only for troubleshooting. So we have discussed only the 
basic problems. You can get a lot of help from the following URLs. Moreover, you 
have the huge user community of WordPress to help you. So always use the support 
forum and Codex.

Backups
In the previous sections, we saw the importance of regular backup. In this section, 
we will see how to back up your files and databases practically using an FTP client 
and MySQL client.
Backing Up WordPress Files
Firstly, let us back up the WordPress files using the web-based FTP clients Net2FTP 
and Filezilla.
Backing Up Files Using Net2FTP
After logging into your WordPress hosting account using Net2FTP, you will see 
something like the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Administrator's Reference
[ 274 ]
Now click on the All link outlined. All files will be selected as follows:
Now click on the Download button outlined. Then Net2FTP will make a ZIP file 
that contains all these selected files and download starts immediately. Save that file 
as a backup.

Chapter 10
[ 275 ]
Backing Up Files Using Filezilla
Let's back up all these files using another famous and open-source FTP client, 
Filezilla. First create a folder where you will keep these files. Then log into your 
WordPress hosting account using Filezilla. After logging in, you will see all the files 
as shown in the following screen:
Select your backup folder in the left pane as highlighted in the preceding screenshot. 
Now select all files in the right pane. From here, it's just a kid's play. Drag these files 
from the right pane to the left pane. The file copy will start and you are done.
If backing up is successful, you can see all files downloaded to your backup folder 
that you had selected in the left pane.
That's it! You have successfully backed up your WordPress files in your local 
backup folders.
Backing Up WordPress Database
You can use the popular and most available phpMyAdmin or any MySQL client to 
back up your WordPress database. Let us discuss the process of backing up.

Administrator's Reference
[ 276 ]
Backing Up the Database Using phpMyAdmin
Firstly, log into phpMyAdmin. If you use the control panel, the URL of phpMyAdmin 
is http://yourdomain:2082/3rdparty/phpMyAdmin/index.php. After logging 
in, you can find the following menu on the right-hand pane of phpMyAdmin. From 
there, let us select Databases as highlighted in the following screen:
Now you will find all your databases on the next screen. Click on the database name 
that is used for WordPress. It will immediately open the database showing all your 
tables. Take a look at the following screenshot:
Please notice the Export button at the top of this page. Export is the process of saving 
your database in different forms. From phpMyAdmin, you can export your database 
into a plain SQL file, which you can run later on to retrieve the contents of your 
database. You can also export your database to a Microsoft Excel file, CSV (Comma 
Separated Value) file, XML file, and so on. For proper retrieval, we need to export 
this database into a plain SQL file.

Chapter 10
[ 277 ]
Let us click on this Export button. You will be redirected to a page where you can 
select all the tables that you can export from this database.
From the table names under the Export label, at the upper-left corner (the box 
marked 1), you can select the tables to export. For backup, we must select all the 
tables. To select, click on the first table name, then hold down the Shift key and click 
on the last table name. All tables will be selected together.
From the section marked 2, you can select the export format. This is by default set 
to SQL format. Keep it as it is. From the box marked 3, you can select whether the 
structure of our database will be exported or not. From this section, check the first 
checkbox labeled Add DROP TABLE. This will generate an SQL command to drop 
the existing tables when you retrieve the backup.
From the section marked 4, you can select whether the data of your database will be 
exported or not. From here, select the first checkbox labeled as Complete inserts. 

Administrator's Reference
[ 278 ]
This will generate a complete INSERT statement for every row in every table. From 
the section marked 5, select "zipped". Then, phpMyAdmin will compress the query 
inside a ZIP file. This is a suitable option because this SQL file is a plain text file and 
the compression ratio is quite high. This will save both time and bandwidth.
After downloading the ZIP file containing the SQL statements, keep it in a 
secure place.
Backing Up the Database Using a MySQL Command
You can back up your database using MySQL command tools. There is a tool named 
mysqldump, which is shipped with the MySQL default installation. If you have 
shell access and proper privilege, you can run this command in your server or from 
elsewhere. The structure of this command is shown as follows:
mysqldump --add-drop-table -h mysqlhost -u username -p databasename | 
fileformat -c > filename
Here comes a real command:
mysqldump --add-drop-table -h phpxperts.net -u stanley -p phpxpert_wp | 
bzip2 -c > phpxpert_wp.sql.bz2
After performing this command, mysqldump will prompt you for a password. If you 
provide the correct username and password, it will start downloading your database 
as an SQL file.
Restoring the Database from Backup
If anything goes wrong, you have to restore your database from the backup that we 
made earlier in this chapter. You can restore older files using FTP, but restoring the 
database needs some extra effort.
Let us see how we can restore our database using phpMyAdmin.
Restoring the Database Using phpMyAdmin
Log into phpMyAdmin, if you have it configured with your MySQL database, 
which you used for the WordPress installation. Select your WordPress database 
from the left pane. You should see all the tables in the right pane as seen in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 10
[ 279 ]
Check all the tables and from the drop-down labeled With Selected at the bottom, 
select the Drop option. You will get a page to confirm this deletion as follows:
Click Yes and the files will be deleted. Now your database is free from these 
corrupt tables.
Now you have to restore your database from the database backup, which you 
archived earlier. Extract the backup archive, and you will get a file with a .sql 
extension. For example, if the previous database name was wordpress, then the SQL 
file would be wordpress.sql. Now click on the Import tab from the top. You will 
get the following screen:

Administrator's Reference
[ 280 ]
Browse the SQL file from your computer and click on Go. Immediately, it will 
upload the file and execute all the SQL commands stored in that file. If everything is 
OK, it will show that files have been imported successfully and you have successfully 
restored your database.
However, if you don't find any Import tab (for older versions of phpMyAdmin), then 
you have to execute the contents of the SQL file from the SQL tab. Click on the SQL 
tab at the top and you will get the following screen:
Open the SQL file using Notepad or any other editor and copy the contents 
from there. Paste the contents from the Notepad into this box and click on Go. If 
everything is OK, you will get a confirmation message on the next page that the 

Chapter 10
[ 281 ]
SQL queries have been executed successfully, which means you have successfully 
restored your old database.
Summary
WordPress is a famous blog engine, which is mature as well as popular. WordPress 
admin panel is designed to be very user friendly, the code is well structured for 
extension, and it can be extended by creating plug-ins. So your journey through 
WordPress is not finished, it's just the beginning.
