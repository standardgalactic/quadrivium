The modern world is full of 
computers! There are desktops, 
laptops, and tablets. Even a cell 
phone is a mini computer.
What is Coding?
Chapter
1

5
Other devices have 
computers, too. Satellites in 
space are controlled by computers. 
Modern TVs and washing machines 
also have computers. Modern cars 
have them, too.

6
The parts of a device that you 
can touch are called hardware. 
The program that tells a computer 
what to do is software. Hardware 
and software work together.
For example, an elevator is 
hardware. Press the button for your 
floor, and the software program tells 
the elevator where to go.

Code on a computer screen
Computer programs are called 
code. Code is a set of instructions 
for a computer to follow.

9
2. Wait for button to be pressed.
1. Wait for doors to close.
3. When current floor is the same  
as button pressed, open doors.
Coding is writing step-by-step 
instructions for a computer. For 
example, here are instructions  
for an elevator.
If button pressed is higher than  
current floor, move upward.
If button pressed is lower than  
current floor, move downward.

The abacus is sometimes called 
the first computer. It was invented 
more than 2,000 years ago to help 
with math.

A loom weaves thread into cloth. 
In 1801, French weaver Joseph 
Jacquard made punch cards with 
holes for his loom. The holes told 
the loom how to weave patterns in 
the cloth. These holes were an 
early computer code.

In the mid-1800s, Charles 
Babbage invented the Analytical 
Engine to do math problems.  
His friend, Ada Lovelace, wrote 
step-by-step programs for the 
Analytical Engine.

Ada Lovelace

Analytical Engine
She is known as the world’s first 
computer programmer. Lovelace 
realized that computers could do 
lots of different tasks.

16
During World War II (1939–
1945), German forces used a secret 
code called Enigma. Countries 
fighting against Germany needed 
to crack the Enigma code to get 
important information. British 
scientist Alan Turing invented a 
computer that decoded Enigma 
and helped to end the war.

Turing’s computer was 
called the Bombe. 

18
ENIAC was the first computer 
that could be programmed to  
do different tasks. ENIAC was  
so big, it took up the space of  
a whole room! 
Operators programmed ENIAC by 
putting plugs into large boards.

Since then, computers have 
become smaller and smaller.  
Now, small devices such as cell 
phones use tiny computer chips. 

Past and Present
FACT!
See how computers have changed!
In 1947, a moth trapped in a 
computer caused the computer 
to make mistakes. It was the  
first computer bug!

while feeling_brave:
    ghost_door = randint(1, 3)
    print(‘Three doors ahead...’)
    print(‘A ghost behind one.’)
    print(‘Which door do you open?’)
    door = input(‘1, 2, or 3?’)

Computers have different 
languages, too. A computer  
coder needs to use a language  
that the computer understands.

24
One of the simplest coding 
languages is “binary.” Binary  
is made up of 1s and 0s. Different 
arrangements of 1s and 0s give the  
computer different instructions.
Computers use binary code to send, 
receive, and store information.

The holes in a punch card give  
the computer instructions.
25
Binary code is similar to punch 
cards with different arrangements 
of holes. Punch cards were used  
to input coding until the 1970s.
Punched hole

More powerful computers  
and better software led to new 
coding languages. Coders type 
short commands on the keyboard 
instead of 1s and 0s.

Over time, most computer  
languages have become quicker 
and easier. Now, many pieces of 
code are pre-programmed. Coders 
click on pieces of code. Then they 
put the pieces of code together to 
create a whole new program.

28
Have you noticed that many 
website names begin with “www?” 
It stands for “World Wide Web.” 
Computers have been linked  
by the Internet since the 1960s.  
In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented 
the World Wide Web. People all 
over the world started sharing 
information on websites over the 
Internet. Today, there are millions 
of websites on the Internet.

Children around the world can learn 
fun facts on Internet websites.

Different Uses
Coding languages are used  
to create programs that help 
children learn.
Different coding languages  
are needed to create codes for  
different uses. Here are a few. 

31
Coding languages are 
used to create programs  
for science labs.
Coding languages are used 
to create programs for 
different types of work.

A modern computer program  
is called an app. App is short  
for application.

Apps are easy to download  
onto small computer devices  
such as cell phones and tablets. 
With apps, you can carry facts  
and fun with you all the time!
Many children enjoy using apps  
just as much as adults do—or maybe 
even more!
33

34
Apps have many different uses.  
People can play games and music  
with apps. They can edit photos  
and videos. Even shopping can be 
done with apps on the Internet.

35
People can keep in touch with 
messaging apps or video calls.  
They can find out about the 
weather. There are even apps  
that help create new apps.

Video
Vacations
Music

36
All programs need code in order  
to work. Coding languages, such  
as Scratch and Python, are easy  
for everyone to use.

say   Hello World!
Hello World!
Scratch is perfect for learning how to code.

37
These days, anyone can code! 
Anvitha Vijay from Australia was 
seven years old when she started 
creating apps. 
Her apps have 
had thousands 
of downloads.

The message 
appears on the 
screen like this
Python can be used to create 
different types of programs.

Coding can be a fun hobby or  
an interesting job. Many children 
practice coding at school.

There are coding clubs and camps, 
too. One thing is for sure—the 
ideas for coding are endless!

A VALUABLE AND SHARED READING EXPERIENCE
For many children, reading requires much effort, but adult 
participation can make this both fun and easier. So here are a few 
tips on how to use this book with your child.
TIP 1  Check out the contents together before your child begins: 
 
• read the text about the book on the back cover.
 
• flip through the book and stop to chat about the contents page 
together to heighten your child’s interest and expectation.
 
• make use of unfamiliar or difficult words on the page  
in a brief discussion.
 
• chat about the nonfiction reading features used in the book,  
such as headings, captions, or labels.
Guide for Parents
This book is part of an exciting four-level reading series for 
children, developing the habit of reading widely for both pleasure 
and information. These chapter books have a compelling main 
narrative to suit your child’s reading ability. Each book is designed 
to develop your child’s reading skills, fluency, grammar awareness, 
and comprehension in order to build confidence and engagement 
when reading.
Ready for a Level 2 book
YOUR CHILD SHOULD
 
• be familiar with using beginning letter sounds and context 
clues to figure out unfamiliar words.
 
• be aware of the need for a slight pause at commas and  
a longer one at periods.
 
• alter his/her expression for questions and exclamations.

47
TIP 2  Support your child as he/she reads the story pages:
 
• give the book to your child to read and turn the pages.
 
• where necessary, encourage your child to break a word  
into syllables, sound out each one, and then flow the  
syllables together. Ask him/her to reread the sentence  
to check the meaning.
 
• you may need to help read some new vocabulary words  
that are difficult for your child to sound out.
 
• when there’s a question mark or an exclamation point,  
encourage your child to vary his/her voice as he/she reads  
the sentence. Demonstrate how to do this if it is helpful.
TIP 3  Chat at the end of each page:
 
• ask questions about the text and the meaning of the words used. 
These help to develop comprehension skills and awareness of the 
language used.
Series consultant, Dr. Linda Gambrell, Distinguished Professor of 
Education at Clemson University, has served as President of the 
National Reading Conference, the College Reading Association, 
and the International Reading Association. 
A FEW ADDITIONAL TIPS
 
• Always encourage your child to try reading 
difficult words by themselves. Praise any self-
corrections, for example, “I like the way you 
sounded out that word and then changed the way 
you said it, to make sense.”
 
• Try to read together everyday. Reading little and 
often is best. These books are divided into 
manageable chapters for one reading session. 
However, after 10 minutes, only keep going if 
your child wants to read on. 
 
• Read other books of different types to your child 
just for enjoyment and information.
