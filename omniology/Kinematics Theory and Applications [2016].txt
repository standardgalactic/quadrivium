Preface
This book is devoted to the kinematics of the single rigid body and of sys-
tems of inter-connected rigid bodies. Engineers are confronted with an endless
variety of systems ranging from simple planar mechanisms to robots, walk-
ing machines, prothetic devices, vehicles, stewart platforms, shaft couplings,
gears etc. Subjects of kinematics are relationships between two and more
positions, ﬁnite and inﬁnitesimal displacements and continuous motions.
The book is intended for use as textbook in advanced courses on kine-
matics of mechanisms. It focuses on a solid theoretical foundation and on
mathematical methods applicable to the solution of problems of very diverse
nature. Applications are demonstrated in a large number of fully worked-out
problems. In kinematics a wide variety of mathematical tools is applicable.
The most important tools are vectors, tensors, matrices, complex numbers,
quaternions, dual numbers, dual vectors, dual quaternions and elements of
line geometry. Whereever possible vector equations are formulated instead of
lengthy scalar coordinate equations. The principle of transference is applied
to problems of very diverse nature.
The book has 19 chapters. Chapters 1 – 13, 16 and 18 are devoted to
spatial kinematics and Chapts. 14, 15 and 17 to planar kinematics. In Chapt.
19 nonlinear dynamics equations of motion are formulated for general spatial
mechanisms. Nearly one half of the book is dealing with position theory and
the other half with motion.
Chapter 1 on Finite rotation about a ﬁxed point introduces the direction
cosine matrix, the similarity transformation, Euler and Bryan angles, Euler-
Rodrigues parameters, quaternions, Cayley-Klein parameters, Rodrigues-,
Euler- and Wiener vectors.
Subjects of Chapt. 2 on Line geometry are Pl¨ucker vectors with applica-
tions to the line of intersection of two planes, to lines intersecting four given
lines, to the linear complex, to linear congruences and to ruled surfaces.
Chapter 3 on Finite screw displacement introduces the (4 × 4) transfor-
mation matrix for general rigid-body displacements, Chasles’ and Halphen’s

Preface
theorems and the screw triangle. Dual numbers and dual vectors lead to the
principle of transference. This principle is applied to the composition and
decomposition of ﬁnite and inﬁnitesimal screw displacements and to deter-
mining the manifold of screw displacements eﬀecting a prescribed line dis-
placement.
In Chapt. 4 entitled Degree of freedom of a mechanism Gr¨ublers formula is
developed and illustrated by applications to various spatial mechanisms with
or without overconstraint.
Chapter 5 is devoted to Spatial closed kinematic chains with a single
independent and with six dependent joint variables. Such chains are basic
elements of single-degree-of-freedom mechanisms. Eﬃcient methods are de-
veloped for expressing the dependent variables in terms of the independent
variable and of constant Denavit-Hartenberg parameters. As closure condi-
tions Woernle-Lee equations and Lee’s half-angle equations are formulated.
For products of vectors in these equations a novel technique is developed. It
is applied to ten mechanisms ranging from the RCCC mechanism with nine
to the general 7R mechanism with twenty-one parameters. The ﬁnal section
is devoted to the inverse kinematics of serial 6-d.o.f. robots.
Chapter 6 entitled Overconstrained mechanisms starts with Bricard’s the-
orem on single-loop-mechanisms with revolute joints. The technique devel-
oped in Chapt. 5 is applied to Bennett’s 4R-mechanism, Goldberg’s 5R-
mechanism, to Bricard’s 6R-mechanisms known as line-symmetric, plane-
symmetric and trihedral mechanisms and to Dietmaier’s 6R-mechanism. In
addition, Steﬀen’s mobile polyhedra, the Bricard-Borel mechanism, Bricard’s
hyperbolic mechanism, a cam mechanism and the HEUREKA octahedron are
analyzed.
Chapter 7 is devoted to the position theory for the terminal body of
spatial three-body chains with two revolute, prismatic or cylindrical joints.
Subject of Chapt. 8 is the direct kinematics of the Stewart platform of
general geometry. Coordinate-free vector equations are formulated for the
dual quaternion specifying the position of a platform The same problem is
solved by elementary means for a Stuart platform with triangular geometry.
Chapter 9 entitled Angular velocity, angular acceleration is the ﬁrst chap-
ter devoted not to position theory, but to continuous motion. Key words are
instantaneous screw axis, velocity screw, velocity and acceleration distribu-
tion in a rigid body, angular velocity of a body expressed in terms of positions
and velocities of three points, novel formulas for striction point and distribu-
tion parameter of raccording axodes, strapdown inertial navigation, motion
on curved surfaces, mecanum wheel.
In Chapt. 10 Kinematic diﬀerential equations are developed relating an-
gular velocity to the time derivatives of direction cosines, Euler- and Bryan
angles, Euler-Rodrigues parameters, Cayley-Klein parameters, Rodrigues pa-
rameters, Wiener parameters and the Euler vector.

Chapter 11 is devoted to Kinematics of tree-structured systems with joints
of arbitrary nature. Positions, velocities and accelerations of bodies are ex-
pressed as functions of generalized joint variables and of their time deriva-
tives. The structure of the tree is described by its path matrix with elements
+1 , −1 and zero.
Chapter 12 on Screw systems begins with the resultant of two general
velocity screws, with the raccording hyperboloids of revolution associated
with the relative motion of two bodies rotating about skew axes and with
the analogy between force screw and velocity screw. The principle of virtual
power leads to the concept of reciprocal screws. Screw systems reciprocal to
ﬁrst-order, second-order and third-order screw systems are investigated.
Chapter 13 on Shaft couplings starts with an analysis of Hooke’s joint
including the polhode and herpolhode cones of its cross-shaped central body.
From the principle of transference results are obtained for a joint coupling
skew axes. A simple formula is developed for the transmission ratio of a chain
of series-connected Hooke’s joints. Final sections are devoted to three classes
of homokinetic shaft couplings and to an elementary analysis of the tripod
joint.
In Chapt. 14 on Displacements in a plane complex numbers are used for
describing translation, rotation about a point and reﬂection in a line and
resultants of these three elementary displacements. Relationships between
three and between four positions of a plane including Burmester’s pole curve
are studied. The last section is devoted to Heesch’s work on tilings.
In Chapt. 15 on Plane motion the ﬁrst part is devoted to centrodes and
to the theorems of Burmester and Kennedy/Aronhold with a series of il-
lustrative examples. Instantaneous centers of rotation and of acceleration,
Bresse circles and normal poles are expressed in complex form. Curvature
theory of plane trajectories leads to the Euler-Savary equation, the cubic of
stationary curvature and to Ball’s point. A short section on Holditch’s the-
orem with applications is followed by the theory of trochoids in general and
of cycloids in particular. An application of cycloids is demonstrated by the
analysis of optimal dwell mechanisms. The ﬁnal section is devoted to the
problem of maneuvering a rectangle of maximum size in the space between
two nonorthogonal straight lines and a point.
In Chapt. 16 entitled Theory of gearing the ﬁrst part on gears with par-
allel axes has the key words analytical meshing conditions for calculating
the tooth ﬂank conjugate to a given ﬂank, external and internal pin gears,
curvature relationship for meshing tooth ﬂanks, Camus’ theorem, cycloidal
gears, involute gearing, addendum modiﬁcation, helicoidal gears. Subject of
the ﬁnal section is Giovanozzi’s theory of general spatial involute gearing.
Chapter 17 on the Planar four-bar begins with sections on Grashof’s con-
dition, the transfer function relating input and output angles, classical and
new formulas for stationary values of the transmission ratio, on four-bars
for the transmission of forces (shears, prongs etc.) and on coupler curves

Preface
(Roberts-Tschebychev theorem, double points, cusps, symmetrical coupler
curves). Two sections are devoted to applications of four-bars in planar robots
and in Jeantaud’s steering mechanism. For the former a simple position and
velocity analysis is formulated. Final sections are devoted to Tschebychev’s
optimal straight-line approximations by coupler curves, to Peaucellier’s in-
versor generating an exact straight line, to Burmester’s four-position theory
and to the trajectory of the composite system center of mass of a four-bar.
Chapter 18 on the Spherical four-bar has sections on the transfer function,
on conditions analogous to Grashof’s condition for the planar four-bar and on
coupler curves (symmetry conditions, double points, cusps, number of points
of intersection with a circle, stereographic projection). The chapter ends with
the investigation of a spherical parallel robot.
In Chapt. 19 entitled Dynamics of mechanisms nonlinear diﬀerential equa-
tions of motion for spatial mechanisms are developed from the principle of
virtual power. Equations for tree-structured systems are based on the kine-
matics formulation in Chapt. 11 . Equations for mechanisms with closed kine-
matic chains are obtained by incorporating additional kinematical constraint
equations.

A right-handed cartesian basis with unit basis vectors e1 , e2 , e3 is called
basis e . This symbol e denotes also the column matrix [ e1 e2 e3 ]T of the
three unit vectors.
The equation r = r1e1 + r2e2 + r3e3 deﬁnes the coordinates r1 , r2 , r3 of
a vector r in basis e and the column matrix r = [ r1 r2 r3 ]T of these coor-
dinates. This matrix is not the vector since it is diﬀerent in diﬀerent bases.
The relationship between vector and coordinate matrix is r = eT r = rT e .

another vector r in the same reference basis,
˜ω r is the column matrix of
the coordinates of ω × r . Also ˜ω r = −˜r ω .

e1 , e2 etc. The coordinates of a vector r in basis ek are denoted rk

the square of some scalar r1 or the ﬁrst component of a vector r in basis
e2 is seen from the context.

Chapter 1
Rotation about a Fixed Point.
Reﬂection in a Plane
Subject of this chapter are relationships between two positions of a rigid body
with a ﬁxed point. Note: Motions leading from one position to the other are
not investigated. Consequently, terms such as velocity or angular velocity do
not occur.

For describing positions two right-handed cartesian bases are deﬁned. The
origins of both bases coincide with the ﬁxed point of the body. The basis with
unit basis vectors e1
i (i = 1, 2, 3) serves as reference basis. The other basis
with unit basis vectors e2
i (i = 1, 2, 3) is ﬁxed on the body. It represents
the body. The bases are denoted e1 and e2 , respectively. The unit basis
vectors of any right-handed cartesian basis e satisfy the six orthonormality
conditions
ei · ej = δij
(i, j = 1, 2, 3)
(1.1)
as well as the right-handedness condition
e1 · e2 × e3 = +1 .
(1.2)
The positions between which relationships are to be established are the so-
called initial position in which e2 coincides with e1 and an arbitrary ﬁnal
position.

These direction cosines are the coordinates of e1
i (i = 1, 2, 3) in e2 as well
as the coordinates of e2
j (j = 1, 2, 3) in e1 . Deﬁnition: The (3 × 3) direction
cosine matrix A12 has in row i the coordinates of e1
i (i = 1, 2, 3) in e2 and,
consequently, in column j the coordinates of e2
j (j = 1, 2, 3) in e1 . The
three equations

are combined in matrix form in the equation

The symbols e1 and e2 , until now simply the names of bases, denote the col-
umn matrices of the unit basis vectors: e1 = [ e1

3 ]T , e2 = [ e2
1 e2
2 e2
3 ]T .
The exponent T denotes transposition. The use of boldface letters indicates
that the elements of e1 and e2 are vectors. The matrix product A12e2 is
evaluated following the rule of ordinary matrix algebra, although one of the
matrices has vectors as elements and the other scalars. For two matrices each
having vectors as elements both the inner product (dot product) and the
outer product (cross product) exist. Example: Scalar multiplication of (1.5)
from the right by e2T produces for the direction cosine matrix the explicit
expression
A12 = e1 · e2T .
(1.6)
This equation is the matrix form of the nine Eqs.(1.3).
The direction cosine matrix is the ﬁrst mathematical quantity used for
specifying the relationship between two positions. Other quantities are in-
troduced later. In what follows, properties of the matrix are discussed. Since
each row contains the coordinates of one of the unit basis vectors of e1 , the
determinant of the matrix is the scalar triple product e1
1 ·e1
2 ×e1
3 . According
to (1.2) this equals +1 . Hence
det A12 = +1 .
(1.7)
The six orthonormality conditions (1.1) express the fact that the scalar prod-
uct of any two rows i and j and also of any two columns i and j of A12
equals the Kronecker delta:

A matrix having these properties is called orthogonal matrix. Because of
(1.8) the product A12A12T equals the unit matrix. Hence the matrix has the
important property that its inverse equals its transpose:
(A12)
−1 = A12T .
(1.9)
Deﬁnition: The co-factor of the element a12
ij is (−1)i+j times the deter-
minant of the (2× 2)-submatrix of A12 left after deleting row i and column
j . Because of the orthogonality of the matrix every element equals it own
co-factor1. Omitting the upper indices 12 these identities can be written in
the forms
aii = ajjakk −ajkakj ,
ajk = aijaki −aiiakj ,

(1.10)
With (1.9) the inverse of (1.5) is
e2 = A21e1
with
A21 = A12T .
(1.11)
Let now v be an arbitrary vector (not necessarily the position vector of
a point). In the bases e1 and e2 it has diﬀerent coordinates v1

3 ]T of the coordinates of v in the
two bases are deﬁned. They are called coordinate matrices of v in e1 and in
e2 , respectively. It should be noted that the term vector is used for v and
not as abbreviation for coordinate matrix. We also distinguish between the
coordinate vi and the component viei of a vector. A component is itself a
vector, whereas a coordinate is a scalar.
In terms of coordinate matrices (1.12) has the form
e1T v1 = e2T v2 .
(1.13)
From (1.11) it follows that e2T = e1T A12 . Substitution of this expression
produces the equation e1T v1 = e1T A12v2 and, consequently,
v1 = A12v2 .

1 Rotation about a Fixed Point. Reﬂection in a Plane
More directly, this equation follows from the fact that the components of
v are linear combinations of unit basis vectors. The equation is the rule by
which vector coordinates are transformed from one basis into another. Be-
cause of this equation the direction cosine matrix is also called transformation
matrix. The absolute value of a vector does not change under a transforma-
tion. Indeed, with both sets of coordinates the scalar product v · v is the
same: v1T v1 = v2T A12T A12v2 = v2T v2 .
Example: Let r and r∗be the position vectors of an arbitrary body-ﬁxed
point in the initial position and in the ﬁnal position of basis e2 , respectively.
The coordinate matrices r∗1 in e1 and r∗2 in e2 satisfy the equation r∗1 =
A12r∗2 . However, since r∗coincides with r , when e2 coincides with e1 ,
also the identity r1 = r∗2 is true. From this it follows that the coordinates
of r∗and r in e1 are related through the equation
r∗1 = A12r1 .
(1.15)
End of example.
Imagine in addition to the bases e1 and e2 a third basis e3 , i.e., a third
position of the rigid body. Then three direction cosine matrices are deﬁned
by the equations
e1 = A13e3 ,
e1 = A12e2 ,
e2 = A23e3 .
(1.16)
The matrices are not independent. The last two equations establish the rela-
tionship e1 = A12A23e3 . Comparison with the ﬁrst equation yields
A13 = A12A23 .
(1.17)
This equation shows that orthogonal matrices constitute a group with respect
to multiplication. They satisfy the four conditions: 1) The product of any
two elements of the group is itself an element (A13 is an orthogonal matrix).
2) The product is associative. 3) There is a unit element, namely, the unit
matrix. 4) For every element of the group the inverse element exists, namely,
the transposed matrix. The group is denoted SO(3) with O for orthogonal.
Next, the eigenvalue problem A12v = λv or (A12 −λI)v = 0 is inves-
tigated where A12 is an arbitrary direction cosine matrix. The equation is
the transformation rule A12v2 = v1 in the special case v1 = λv2 . Since
the absolute value of a vector does not change under a transformation, it
can be predicted that all three eigenvalues have the absolute value one. The
eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic equation det (A12 −λI) = 0 .
Without the superscript of A12 this is the cubic equation
−λ3 + λ2 tr A −λ[(a11a22 −a12a21) + (a22a33 −a23a32)
+(a33a11 −a31a13)] + det A = 0 .
(1.18)

1.1 Direction Cosine Matrix

According to (1.7) the free term is +1 . Every expression in parentheses is the
co-factor of one diagonal element of A12 . According to the ﬁrst Eq.(1.10) the
co-factor is identical with the diagonal element. Consequently, the expression
in square brackets represents the trace of the matrix. Thus, the equation
reads
−λ3 + λ2 tr A12 −λ tr A12 + 1 = 0 .
(1.19)
It shows that every direction cosine matrix has the eigenvalue λ = +1 .
Division by (λ−1) produces for the other eigenvalues the quadratic equation
λ2 −(tr A12 −1)λ + 1 = 0 . It has the roots

(1.21)
If A12 is the unit matrix, it has the triple eigenvalue +1 . In the case
tr A12 = −1 it has the double eigenvalue λ2,3 = −1 .
Let n be the normalized eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue λ =
+1 . It is calculated from the equations
(A12 −I)n = 0 ,
n2
1 + n2
2 + n2
3 = 1 .
(1.22)
This eigenvector n represents the coordinate matrix of a unit vector n which
has identical coordinate matrices in the bases e1 and e2 . Also this vector
n is called eigenvector of A12 .
Imagine that, starting from the initial position, the body-ﬁxed basis e2
is rotated about the eigenvector n . The ﬁnal position depends upon the
rotation angle. Independent of the angle the vector n has identical coordinate
matrices n1 = n2 = n in e1 and in e2 . The existence of the eigenvector
guarantees the existence of an angle which carries the basis from its initial
position to the ﬁnal position given by the matrix A12 . Hence the
Theorem 1.1. (Euler) The displacement of a body-ﬁxed basis from an initial
position e1 to an arbitrary ﬁnal position e2 is achieved by a rotation through
a certain angle about an axis which is ﬁxed in both bases. The axis has the
direction of the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue
λ = +1 of the
direction cosine matrix A12 .
In Sect. 1.5 it is shown that the rotation angle in Euler’s theorem is the
angle ϕ in Eq.(1.20) for the eigenvalues λ2 and λ3 . Euler’s theorem guar-
antees that the direction cosine matrix A12 can be expressed in terms of
the coordinates of its eigenvector n and of the rotation angle ϕ . This is the
subject of Sect. 1.5 .

The complex conjugate eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalues cos ϕ±
i sin ϕ are determined at the end of Sect. 1.5 .
1.2 Similarity Transformation
Let A and B be arbitrary (n × n)-matrices, A nonsingular. The transfor-
mation of B into the matrix
B∗= A B A−1
(1.23)
is called similarity transformation of B .
Theorem 1.2. The matrices B and A B A−1 have identical characteristic
polynomials and, therefore, identical eigenvalues and identical traces.
Proof: The characteristic polynomial of A B A−1 is
det (A B A−1 −λI) =
det (A B A−1 −A λI A−1) = det [A (B −λI)A−1] = det (B −λI) = 0
(the determinant of a product of matrices equals the product of the determi-
nants of the factors). Since the trace is the sum of all eigenvalues, also the
traces are identical. End of proof.
Theorem 1.3. Let n and nB be the eigenvectors of A B A−1 and of B ,
respectively, associated with one and the same eigenvalue λ (arbitrary). They
are related by the equation
n = A nB .
(1.24)
Proof: By deﬁnition, A B A−1 n = λn and B nB = λnB . With (1.24) the
ﬁrst equation is A B A−1A nB = λA nB or B nB = λnB . This is the second
equation. End of proof.
Example: Let A12 be the direction cosine matrix relating the coordinates
of vectors in two bases e1 and e2 . Let, in particular, a1 , a2 and b1 , b2
be the coordinate matrices of two vectors a and b , respectively, so that,
for example, b1 = A12b2 . The cross-product a × b has in the two bases the
coordinate matrices ˜a1b1 and ˜a2b2 with the skew-symmetric matrices ˜ai =

⎥⎦(i = 1, 2) . Hence ˜a1 b1 = A12 ˜a2 b2 . On the right-hand side
b2 = A12T b1 is substituted. This results in the transformation formula
˜a1 = A12 ˜a2 A12T .
(1.25)
It is a similarity transformation. End of example.

1.3 Euler Angles

1.3 Euler Angles
Calculations with nine direction cosines subject to six constraint equations
are cumbersome. In the present section and in following sections the elements
of the direction cosine matrix are formulated in various ways in terms of either
three coordinates without constraint equations or in terms of four coordinates
with one constraint equation. In the present section so-called Euler angles
are introduced. The ﬁnal position e2 of the body-ﬁxed basis is the result of
three successive rotations (Fig. 1.1a ). In the initial position prior to the ﬁrst
rotation the body-ﬁxed basis coincides with e1 . The ﬁrst rotation is carried
out through an angle ψ about the axis e1
3 (in the usual right-handed sense).
It carries the body-ﬁxed basis into an intermediate position e2′′ . The second
rotation is carried out through an angle θ about the axis e2′′
1 . It carries the
body-ﬁxed basis into a new intermediate position e2′ . The third rotation is
carried out through an angle φ about the axis e2′
3 . It carries the body-ﬁxed
basis into the ﬁnal position e2 . A characteristic feature of Euler angles is that
the second and the third rotation are carried out about axes which are the
result of the previous rotation (or rotations). Another characteristic feature
is the sequence (3,1,3) of rotation axes.
The desired expression for the matrix A12 in terms of the three angles
is obtained from the transformation Eqs.(1.5) for the individual rotations.
Figure 1.1a yields the equations

e2′′ = Aθe2′ ,

From (1.26) it follows that A12 = AψAθAφ . When this is multiplied out and
use is made of the abbreviations cψ , cθ , cφ for cos ψ , cos θ , cos φ and
sψ , sθ , sφ for sin ψ , sin θ , sin φ , the matrix is obtained in the form
A12 =

(1.28)
The advantage of having only three coordinates and no constraint equation
is paid for by the disadvantage that the direction cosines are complicated
functions of the three coordinates. There is still another problem. Figure 1.1a
shows that in the case θ = nπ (n = 0, ±1, . . .) the axis of the third rotation
coincides with the axis of the ﬁrst rotation. This has the consequence that ψ
and φ cannot be distinguished.
Euler angles can be illustrated by means of a rigid body in a two-gimbal
suspension system (Fig. 1.1b ). The bases e1 and e2 are attached to the
material base and to the suspended body, respectively. The angles ψ , θ
and φ are, in this order, the rotation angle of the outer gimbal relative to
the material base, of the inner gimbal relative to the outer gimbal and of
the body relative to the inner gimbal. With this device all three angles can
be adjusted independently since the intermediate bases e2′′ and e2′ are
materially realized by the gimbals. For θ = nπ (n = 0, 1, . . .) the planes of
the gimbals coincide (gimbal lock).
Euler angles are ideally suited as position variables for the study of motions
in which θ(t) is either exactly or approximately constant, whereas ψ and
φ are (exactly or approximately) proportional to time, i.e.,
˙ψ ≈const and
˙φ ≈const . Euler angles are advantageous also whenever there exist two
physically signiﬁcant directions, one ﬁxed in the reference basis e1 and the
other ﬁxed in the body-ﬁxed basis e2 . In such cases, e1
3 and e2
3 are given
these directions so that θ is the angle between the two (as examples see
Eqs.(10.10) and (10.83)). However, the use of Euler angles is not restricted
to such special cases.
If the matrix A12 is given, the corresponding Euler angles are calculated
from the equations

Let (ψ , θ , φ) be the angles associated with σ = +1 . The angles associated
with σ = −1 are (π + ψ , −θ , π + φ) . Both triples produce one and the
same ﬁnal position of the basis e2 . Numerical diﬃculties arise when θ is
close to one of the critical values nπ (n = 0, 1, . . .).
1.4 Bryan Angles
These angles are also referred to as Cardan angles. As before, the ﬁnal po-
sition e2 of the body-ﬁxed basis is the result of three successive rotations
(Fig. 1.2a ). In the initial position prior to the ﬁrst rotation the body-ﬁxed
basis coincides with e1 . The ﬁrst rotation is carried out through an angle
φ1 about the axis e1
1 . It carries the body-ﬁxed basis into an intermediate
position e2′′ . The second rotation is carried out through an angle φ2 about
the axis e2′′
2 . It carries the body-ﬁxed basis into a new intermediate posi-
tion e2′ . The third rotation is carried out through an angle φ3 about the
axis e2′
3 . It carries the body-ﬁxed basis into the ﬁnal position e2 . A charac-
teristic feature of Bryan angles is the sequence (1,2,3) of rotation axes2. The
desired expression for the matrix A12 is, again, the product of three matrices
describing the individual rotations. Figure 1.2a shows that

three rotations. Other possible sequences of rotation axes for Bryan angles are (3,2,1) and
the cyclic permutations (2,3,1), (3,1,2),
(2,1,3) and (1,3,2). In Sect. 18.4 the sequence

Bryan angles, too, can be illustrated by means of a rigid body in a two-
gimbal suspension system. The arrangement is shown in Fig. 1.2b . The bases
e1 and e2 are attached to the material base and to the suspended body,
respectively. The angles φ1 , φ2 and φ3 are, in this order, the rotation angle
of the outer gimbal relative to the material base, of the inner gimbal relative
to the outer gimbal and of the body relative to the inner gimbal. The three
angles can be adjusted independently since the intermediate bases e2′′ and
e2′ are materially realized by the gimbals. For φ2 = 0 the three rotation
axes are mutually orthogonal. As with Euler angles there exists a critical case
in which the axes of the ﬁrst and of the third rotation coincide. It occurs if
φ2 = π/2 + nπ (n = 0, 1, . . .) .
In contrast to Euler angles linearization for small angles is possible. With
|φi| ≪1 (i = 1, 2, 3) sin φi ≈φi , cos φi ≈1 the matrix is
A12 ≈

(1.33)
The occurrence of the matrix ˜φ suggests to interpret
φ1 , φ2 , φ3 as co-
ordinates of a rotation vector φ . In the linear approximation the coordi-
nates are the same in both bases. Indeed, transformation, i.e., multiplication
of the coordinate matrix
φ = [ φ1 φ2 φ3 ]T
with A12 , causes no change:
A12φ ≈(I + ˜φ)φ = φ . The rotation vector φ is used as follows. Let r and
r∗be the position vectors of an arbitrary body-ﬁxed point before and after
the small rotation, respectively. The coordinate matrices of these two vectors
in e1 satisfy (1.15):
r∗1 = A12r1 ≈(I + ˜φ)r1 = r1 + ˜φ r1 . This is the
coordinate form of the vector equation

r∗≈r + φ × r
(valid for small rotations only) .
(1.34)
What follows, is not restricted to small angles. If the matrix A12 in (1.32)
is given, the associated Bryan angles are calculated from the equations

(1.35)
Numerical diﬃculties arise when φ2 is close to one of the critical values
π/2 + nπ (n = 0, 1, . . .) . Let
(φ1 , φ2 , φ3) be the angles associated with
σ = +1 . The angles associated with σ = −1 are (π + φ1 , π −φ2 , π + φ3) .
Both triples produce one and the same ﬁnal position of the basis e2 .
The combination of (1.35) and (1.28) yields Bryan angles in terms of Euler
angles. Conversely, the combination of (1.29) and (1.32) yields Euler angles
in terms of Bryan angles.
1.5 Rotation Tensor
In this section Theorem 1.1 is taken up again: The displacement of a body-
ﬁxed basis from an initial position e1 to an arbitrary ﬁnal position e2 is
achieved by a rotation through a certain angle ϕ about the axis given by
the eigenvector n which is associated with the eigenvalue λ = +1 of the
direction cosine matrix A12 . In what follows, the rotation is called rotation
(n, ϕ) . Note: The rotations
(n, ϕ) ,
(−n, −ϕ) and
(n, ϕ + 2π) produce
the same ﬁnal position. For this reason, they are called equal. Now, the unit
vector n and the angle ϕ of the rotation are prescribed. To be determined is
the direction cosine matrix A12 . In Fig. 1.3 the rotation is illustrated by its
Fig. 1.3 Body-ﬁxed vector in positions r before and r∗after the rotation (n, ϕ)

12
1 Rotation about a Fixed Point. Reﬂection in a Plane
eﬀect on a body-ﬁxed vector. Before the rotation the vector is in the position
r . The rotation
(n, ϕ) carries it into the position r∗. With the auxiliary
vectors a = n × r and b = n × a = n × (n × r) the vector r∗is expressed
in the form
r∗= r + (1 −cos ϕ)b + sin ϕ a
(1.36)
= r + (1 −cos ϕ)n × (n × r) + sin ϕ n × r
(1.37)
= cos ϕ r + (1 −cos ϕ)nn · r + sin ϕ n × r .
(1.38)
This has the form
r∗= R(n, ϕ) · r .
(1.39)
The equation deﬁnes the rotation tensor
R(n, ϕ) = cos ϕ I + (1 −cos ϕ)nn + sin ϕ n × I
(unit tensor I) . (1.40)
The inverse of the rotation (n, ϕ) is the rotation (n, −ϕ) = (−n, ϕ) . The
rotation (n, ϕ) as well as the inverse rotation carries the axial vector n into
itself. This is expressed by the identities
R(±n, ϕ) · n ≡n ,
n · R(±n, ϕ) ≡n .
(1.41)
The rotation tensor is symmetric if and only if sin ϕ = 0 , i.e., in the trivial
case ϕ = 0 and in the case
ϕ = π which is of particular interest. This
symmetric tensor is
R(n, ±π) = 2nn −I .
(1.42)
From Fig. 1.3 it is seen that a 180◦-rotation about the line deﬁned by n
is equivalent to reﬂection in this line. Deﬁnition: A point P∗with position
vector r∗is said to be the reﬂection of P (position vector r ) in a line if
- the line PP
∗intersects the reﬂecting line orthogonally
- the point of intersection is midpoint of PP
∗.
Equation (1.39) has the form r∗= 2nn · r −r , whence it follows that r∗+ r
has the direction of n . Hence
n = r∗+ r
|r∗+ r|
(ϕ = ±π ; r · n ̸= 0 ) .
(1.43)
Now back to the general case. From (1.37) it follows that
(r∗−r) · n = 0 .
(1.44)
Let R1 = R(n1, ϕ1) be the tensor of a ﬁrst rotation which is followed by a
second rotation with the tensor R2 = R(n2, ϕ2) . The ﬁrst rotation carries a
body-ﬁxed vector from its initial position r into the new position r∗= R1·r .
The second rotation carries this vector r∗into the ﬁnal position r∗∗= R2·r∗.
Combination of both equations yields the formula
r∗∗= R2 · R1 · r . The

1.5 Rotation Tensor
13
product R2 · R1 is the tensor Rres of the resultant rotation (nres, ϕres) :
Rres = R2 · R1 .
(1.45)
The product depends on the order of the rotations. The product is the unit
tensor, when the second rotation is the inverse of the ﬁrst rotation:
R(−n, ϕ) · R(n, ϕ) = I .
(1.46)
Up to now coordinate-free forms of rotation tensors have been used. Ap-
plications see in Sects. 1.15.2 , 1.15.9 and 1.15.11 . Decomposition of (1.39)
in basis e1 results in the coordinate equation
r∗1 = R(n, ϕ)r1 = [cos ϕ I + (1 −cos ϕ)n nT + sin ϕ ˜n ] r1 .
(1.47)
Comparison with (1.15) shows that R(n, ϕ) is the direction cosine matrix:
A12 = cos ϕ I + (1 −cos ϕ)n nT + sin ϕ ˜n
(1.48)
or explicitly
A12 =
⎡
⎣

(1.49)
The diagonal elements can be given other forms if use is made of the con-
straint equation
n2
1 + n2
2 + n2
3 = 1 .
(1.50)
The diagonal elements yield the ﬁrst equation below, and the oﬀ-diagonal
elements yield the second:

2ni sin ϕ = a12
kj −a12
jk (i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 cyclic)
↔
2˜n sin ϕ = A12 −A12T .
(1.52)
The ﬁrst equation is Eq.(1.21). This proves that the rotation angle ϕ is the
angle in the eigenvalues λ2,3 = e±iϕ of the direction cosine matrix.
When the matrix A12 is given, the rotation parameters ϕ and n1 , n2 , n3
can be determined in two ways. Either n is calculated from (1.22): (A12 −
I)n = 0 . Then (1.51) and (1.52) together determine ϕ uniquely. The al-
ternative way is to take one of the two solutions ϕ satisfying (1.51) and to

14
1 Rotation about a Fixed Point. Reﬂection in a Plane
calculate n1 , n2 , n3 from (1.52). This equation for n1 , n2 , n3 fails in the
particularly simple case ϕ = π . In this case, A12 is the symmetric matrix
(see (1.42))
A12 = 2n nT −I .
(1.53)
It satisﬁes the equation (A12−I)(A12+I) = 0 . The trace of A12 is −1 . From
(1.20) it is known that the matrix has the real double eigenvalue λ2,3 = −1 .
Let z be the eigenvectors associated with this double eigenvalue. They are
solutions of the equation (A12 + I)z = 0 . This is the equation nnT z = 0 ,
whence it follows that nT z = 0 . This means that every vector perpendicular
to the rotation axis n is an eigenvector. Indeed, the rotation (n, π) applied
to such a vector z results in −z . The same displacement from z into −z
occurs when the vector is reﬂected in the line n .
The formulation (1.49) of the matrix A12 in terms of the four rotation
parameters n1 , n2 , n3 and ϕ is particularly useful in cases when a body is
rotating about a ﬁxed axis which is not aligned with one of the basis vectors.
In this case, n1 , n2 , n3 are constants, and only ϕ is a variable. Applications
see in Sects. 1.15.3 , 6.11 and 18.4 . If one of the three coordinates n1 , n2 , n3
is zero, the other two are deﬁned by an angle. Example: With
n1 = 0 ,
n2 = sin α , n3 = cos α the matrix has the special form
A12 =
⎡
⎣
cos ϕ
−sin ϕ cos α
sin ϕ sin α
sin ϕ cos α
cos ϕ cos2 α + sin2 α
(1 −cos ϕ) sin α cos α
−sin ϕ sin α
(1 −cos ϕ) sin α cos α
cos ϕ sin2 α + cos2 α
⎤
⎦.
(1.54)
An application is shown in Sect. 16.2.1 .
For small rotations with
|ϕ| ≪1 the Taylor expansion of (1.48) up to
second-order terms yields the approximation
A12 ≈I + ϕ ˜n + 1
2ϕ2(n nT −I) .
(1.55)
An application is shown in Sect. 1.15.5 . The linear approximation
A12 ≈
I + ϕ ˜n is known from (1.33).
In what follows, the trace tr A12 and the vector 2n sin ϕ in (1.51) and
(1.52) are considered again. Both are expressed in terms of unit basis vectors.
For this purpose the deﬁnition of direction cosines in (1.3), a12

Because of the symmetry A12T = A12 they are, indeed, identical.
Next, (1.49) is used for expressing the complex conjugate eigenvectors as-
sociated with the eigenvalues cos ϕ ± i sin ϕ of the direction cosine matrix
in terms of n1 , n2 , n3 and ϕ . Let [ m1 m2 m3 ]T be the eigenvector asso-
ciated with cos ϕ + i sin ϕ . With the abbreviations c = cos ϕ , s = sin ϕ it
is determined from the equations

1.6 Euler-Rodrigues Parameters
Starting from (1.37) a new form is developed for the direction cosine matrix
A12 . By means of the formulas
1 −cos ϕ = 2 sin2 ϕ
2 ,
sin ϕ = 2 sin ϕ
2 cos ϕ
2
(1.66)
the transition to the half-angle is made. New quantities are deﬁned as follows:
q0 = cos ϕ
2 ,
q = n sin ϕ
2 .
(1.67)
The vector q lies in the rotation axis (Fig. 1.3). Therefore, it has identical co-
ordinates in the bases e1 and e2 . These coordinates are denoted q1 , q2 , q3 ,
and the coordinate matrix is called q . The four quantities q0, . . . , q3 are re-
ferred to as Euler-Rodrigues parameters. They satisfy the constraint equation
q2
0 + q2 =
3

i=0
q2
i = 1 .
(1.68)
This can also be written in the forms
1 −2q2 = q2
0 −q2 = 2q2
0 −1 .
(1.69)
Equations (1.67) show: A change of the signs of all four parameters means
that either cos ϕ/2 and sin ϕ/2 change signs or cos ϕ/2 and n change
signs. The former has the eﬀect that
(n, ϕ) is replaced by
(n, ϕ + 2π) .
The latter means that (n, ϕ) is replaced by (−n, −ϕ) . Neither one of these
changes has an eﬀect on the rotation.
Substitution of the expressions (1.66) into (1.37) produces the equation
r∗= r + 2[q × (q × r) + q0q × r] .
(1.70)
Reformulation of the double cross product and application of (1.69) lead to

1.6 Euler-Rodrigues Parameters
17
r∗= (q2
0 −q2)r + 2(qq · r + q0q × r)
(1.71)
= [(q2
0 −q2)I + 2(qq + q0q × I)] · r .
(1.72)
If one of the double cross products is kept, the alternative form is obtained:
r∗= q2
0r + qq · r + q × (q × r) + 2q0q × r .
(1.73)
Equation (1.70) yields
r∗−r = 2[q×(q×r)+q0q×r] ,
r∗+r = 2[r+q×(q×r)+q0q×r] . (1.74)
Elementary calculations show that
q0(r∗−r) = q × (r∗+ r)
(1.75)
or, with the so-called Rodrigues vector
u = q
q0
= n tan ϕ
2 ,
(1.76)
r∗−r = u × (r∗+ r) .
(1.77)
This relationship can also be inferred directly from Fig. 1.3. The Rodrigues
vector is subject of Sects. 1.9 and 1.13 .
The coeﬃcient of r in (1.72) represents a new form of the rotation tensor
in (1.39): r∗= R(n, ϕ) · r . The same arguments that led to (1.48) for the
direction cosine matrix A12 now lead to the equation
A12 = (q2
0 −q2)I + 2(q qT + q0˜q) .
(1.78)
Multiplying out results in the expression
A12 =
⎡
⎣
q2
0 + q2

⎦. (1.79)
This representation of the matrix is appealing in that every element is a
quadratic form of Euler-Rodrigues parameters. With (1.69) the diagonal el-
ements have the alternative form a12
ii = 2(q2
0 + q2
i ) −1 (i = 1, 2, 3) . Hence
A12 = −I + 2

The equations for q1 , q2 , q3 fail in the case q0 = 0 . This is the case ϕ = π ,
q = n when n must be determined from the equation (A12 −I)n = 0 (see
(1.51) and (1.52) in this case).
In contrast to Euler angles and to Bryan angles there is no critical case in
which the Euler-Rodrigues parameters are indeterminate. Hopf [10] was the
ﬁrst to prove that no representation of ﬁnite rotations by three parameters
is possible without singular points. Stuelpnagel [30] gave a simpler version of
the proof.
The matrix A12 in (1.78) resulted from scalar decomposition of (1.72). If,
instead, (1.73) is decomposed, the matrix has the alternative form
A12 = q2
0I + q qT + ˜q ˜q + 2q0˜q = q qT + (q0I + ˜q)2 .
(1.83)
This is the product
A12 = G HT
(1.84)
with the (3 × 4)-matrices
G = [−q , q0I + ˜q ] ,
H = [−q , q0I −˜q ] .
(1.85)
The comma separates the ﬁrst column from the remaining three columns.
Each of these two matrices is a homogeneous linear function of Euler-
Rodrigues parameters. It is an elementary task to verify that the matrices
have the orthogonality properties

1.7 Relationships Between Euler-Rodrigues Parameters
and Euler Angles
Expressions for Euler-Rodrigues parameters in terms of Euler angles are ob-
tained when in (1.81) and (1.82) for A12 Eq.(1.28) is substituted. The diag-
onal elements yield
1 + tr A12 = 1 + cθ + cθ(cψcφ −sψsφ) + (cψcφ −sψsφ)

= (1 + cos θ)[1 + cos(ψ + φ)] = 4 cos2 θ
2 cos2 ψ + φ

Hence q0 = ± cos θ/2 cos(ψ + φ)/2 . Arbitrarily, the positive sign is chosen.

Equation (1.93) is obtained more directly by equating the elements (3, 3) of
the direction cosine matrices in (1.28) and (1.79).

1 Rotation about a Fixed Point. Reﬂection in a Plane
1.8 Quaternions
Hamilton [8, 9] is acknowledged as inventor of quaternion algebra (in the year
1843). However, the quaternion product in connection with the composition
of ﬁnite rotations was formulated ﬁrst by Euler in 1748 and by Gauss in
1819 . A quaternion, abbreviated Q , is composed of a scalar u and a vector
v , i.e., of four quantities altogether. Therefore, the name quaternion. The
quaternion is denoted Q = (u, v) . The product of a quaternion (u , v) by
a scalar λ is deﬁned to be the quaternion (λu , λv) .
The sum and the product of two quaternions Q1 and Q2 are deﬁned to
be the quaternions
Q1 + Q2 = Q2 + Q1 = (u1 + u2 , v1 + v2) ,
(1.97)
Q2Q1 = (u2 , v2)(u1 , v1) =

u2u1−v2·v1 , u2v1+u1v2+v2×v1

. (1.98)
Because of the term v2 ×v1 multiplication is not commutative. It is associa-
tive, however, as can be veriﬁed by multiplying out: Q3Q2Q1 = Q3(Q2Q1) =
(Q3Q2)Q1 .
Remark: In the mathematical literature (Blaschke [4]) a quaternion is intro-
duced in the form
Q = ue0 + v1e1 + v2e2 + v3e3 .
(1.99)
The quaternion product is deﬁned by the multiplication rules
eje0 =
e0ej = ej ,
ejej = −e0
(j = 1, 2, 3) ,
ejek = −ekej = eℓ
(j, k, ℓ= 1, 2, 3 cyclic) .

(1.100)
End of remark.
The special quaternion (1 , 0) is called unit quaternion because multipli-
cation with an arbitrary quaternion Q yields Q , again:
(1 , 0)Q = Q(1 , 0) ≡Q .
(1.101)
The conjugate of Q = (u, v) is deﬁned to be the quaternion
˜Q = (u, −v) .
The product of a quaternion with its own conjugate is
Q ˜Q = (u, v)(u, −v) = (u2 + v2 , 0) = (u2 + v2)(1 , 0) .
(1.102)
Thus, it is a nonnegative scalar multiple of the unit quaternion. The square
root of this scalar is called the norm of Q , abbreviated
∥Q∥=

u2 + v2 .
(1.103)

1.8 Quaternions
21
An arbitrary quaternion Q with norm ∥Q∦= 0 satisﬁes the equation
( ˜Q/∥Q∥2)Q = (1 , 0) . Because of this property
˜Q/∥Q∥2 is called the in-
verse of Q .
The conjugate of the product Q2Q1 in (1.98) is (the vector part is mul-
tiplied by −1 )

Q2Q1 =

u2u1 −v2 · v1 , −u2v1 −u1v2 −v2 × v1

.
(1.104)
With the same quaternions Q1 and Q2 the product is calculated:
˜Q1 ˜Q2 = (u1, −v1)(u2, −v2)
=

u1u2 −v1 · v2 , −u1v2 −u2v1 + v1 × v2

.
(1.105)
Comparison reveals the formula
˜Q1 ˜Q2 = 
Q2Q1 .
(1.106)
With the Euler-Rodrigues parameters q0 and q of Eqs.(1.67) the quater-
nion of a rotation is deﬁned. It is denoted D :
D = (q0, q) =

cos ϕ
2 , n sin ϕ
2

.
(1.107)
It has the norm ∥D∥=

q2
0 + q2 = 1 . Hence its inverse equals its conjugate:
˜D = (q0 , −q) ,
˜DD = (1 , 0) .
(1.108)
The conjugate is the quaternion of the inverse rotation. The quaternion of the
null rotation (ϕ = 0) is the unit quaternion (1 , 0) . Normalized quaternions
constitute a group with respect to multiplication.
With an arbitrary vector r the special quaternion (0 , r) is constructed.
With the vector r shown in Fig. 1.3 and with the quaternion D of the
rotation in this ﬁgure the product is calculated:
D(0 , r) ˜D = (q0, q)(0 , r)(q0, −q) .
(1.109)
The product of the last two quaternions is
(0 , r)(q0, −q) = (r · q , q0r −r × q) .
(1.110)
With this expression the scalar part of D(0 , r) ˜D turns out to be
q0r · q −q · (q0r −r × q) = 0 .
(1.111)
The vector part is

22
1 Rotation about a Fixed Point. Reﬂection in a Plane
q0(q0r −r × q) + (r · q)q + q × (q0r −r × q)
= q2
0r + q0q × r + q(q · r) + q0q × r + q × (q × r) .
(1.112)
Reformulation of the double cross product yields the expression
(q2
0 −q2)r + 2(qq · r + q0q × r) .
(1.113)
Comparison with (1.71) shows that this is the vector r∗of Fig. 1.3 . The
results are summarized in the equation
(0 , r∗) = D(0 , r) ˜D .
(1.114)
Next, two consecutive rotations with quaternions D1 (ﬁrst rotation) and
D2 are executed. The result of the ﬁrst rotation is (0 , r∗) = D1(0 , r) ˜D1 .
The second rotation carries the vector r∗into the new position r∗∗given
by the equation (0 , r∗∗) = D2(0 , r∗) ˜D2 . For (0 , r∗) the expression from
the previous equation is substituted. This yields the relationship (0 , r∗∗) =
D2D1(0 , r) ˜D1 ˜D2 or, because of (1.106),
(0 , r∗∗) = (D2D1)(0 , r) 
(D2D1) .
(1.115)
This has the form (1.114). The results are summarized in
Theorem 1.4. (Euler, Gauss) The quaternion Dres of the resultant of two
consecutive rotations with quaternions D1 (ﬁrst rotation) and D2 is the
product
Dres = D2D1 = (q02, q2)(q01, q1)

(1.116)
The multiplication rule (1.98) yields the formulas
q0res = q02q01 −q2 · q1 ,
qres = q02q1 + q01q2 + q2 × q1 .

(1.117)
More explicitly, these are formulas for the rotation angle ϕres and for the
unit vector nres of the resultant rotation:

(1.119)

1.8 Quaternions
23
Because of the term with
n2 × n1
the axis of the resultant rotation is
not located in the plane of the axes of the other two rotations. Its location
depends upon the order in which the rotations are executed. In contrast, the
angle ϕres is independent of the order. Applications see in Sects. 1.15.2 and
1.15.12 .
For scalar decomposition of the vectors n1 and n2 the basis e1,2,3 shown
in Fig. 1.4 is chosen. Let α be the rotation angle about e3 which carries n1
into the position n2 . Then the vectors are
n1,2 = e1 cos α
2 ∓e2 sin α
2 .
(1.120)
With these expressions (1.118) and (1.119) take the forms

Fig. 1.4 Reference axes e1,2,3 for the vectors n1 and n2
In the case of small angles ϕ1 and ϕ2 the linearized Eqs.(1.118) and
(1.119) have the forms
cos ϕres
2
≈1 ,
nresϕres ≈n1ϕ1 + n2ϕ2 .
(1.123)
From the ﬁrst equation it follows that also ϕres is small. The second equation
proves that in this approximation it is possible to deﬁne rotation vectors
ϕres = nresϕres , ϕi = niϕi
and to calculate the resultant vector by the
parallelogram rule
ϕres ≈ϕ1 + ϕ2 .
(1.124)
The vector of a small rotation appeared already in the context of (1.33).
By squaring (1.118) and by applying theorems for circular functions it is
possible to produce an equation which is free of half-angles. In contrast, no
expression can be obtained for nres which is free of half-angles and of square

Fig. 1.5 Rotation of a vector r about an axis n normal to r
roots. Half-angles can be avoided only in the special case when in Fig. 1.3
r is normal to n . Then also r∗is normal to n . This special situation is
shown in Fig. 1.5 . In accordance with (1.38) the vectors r∗and r satisfy
the equation
r∗= r cos ϕ + n × r sin ϕ .
(1.125)
The quaternion form of this equation is not only Eq.(1.114), but also the
simpler equation
(0 , r∗) = (cos ϕ , n sin ϕ)(0 , r) .
(1.126)
Example: Given two consecutive rotations through identical angles ϕ about
the e1-axis (ﬁrst rotation) and about the e3-axis of a basis e , determine the
resultant rotation (nres, ϕres) for ϕ = 180◦(a) and for ϕ = 90◦(b).
Solutions are calculated from (1.117).
Problem (a): nres = e2 ,
ϕres = 180◦,
Problem (b): nres = (
√
3/3)(e1 + e2 + e3) ,
ϕres = 60◦. End of example.
1.9 Relationships Between Three Positions of a Body
New notations: In what follows, the axial unit vector and the angle of rotation
from a position i into a position j ̸= i are denoted nij and ϕij , respectively.
Thus, two rotations and the resultant of these two, up to now called (n1, ϕ1) ,
(n2, ϕ2) and (nres, ϕres) , respectively, are henceforth denoted (n12, ϕ12) ,
(n23, ϕ23) and (n13, ϕ13) , respectively. Deﬁne n31 = n13 and ϕ31 = −ϕ13 .
The rotation (n31, ϕ31) is the inverse of the resultant rotation (n13, ϕ13) .
The three rotations
(n12, ϕ12) ,
(n23, ϕ23) ,
(n31, ϕ31) executed in this
order or in any order produced by cyclic permutation carry a body via two
intermediate positions back into its initial position. Equations (1.118) and
(1.119) establish the relationships

1.9 Relationships Between Three Positions of a Body
25
In the ﬁrst equation
n23 · n12 = cos α2 is written. The index 2 of α2 is
common to both vectors. Every equation remains valid after cyclic permu-
tation of the indices 1, 2, 3 . In the three Eqs.(1.127) the cosine law for the
spherical triangle (P12,P23,P31) shown in Fig. 1.6 is recognized. Its vertices
are the tips of the vectors n12 , n23 , n31 . Its sides 1, 2, 3 have lengths α1 ,
α2 , α3 . The internal angles are semi-rotation angles. Since rotation angles
diﬀering by 2π are considered as equal, the sign convention is as follows:
ϕij/2 (i, j = 1, 2, 3) is the internal and also the external angle from side i
to side j . These results are summarized in
Theorem 1.5. Three consecutive rotations about axes pointing from 0 to
the vertices of a spherical triangle (P12,P23,P31) and through angles equal
to twice the internal or external angles of the triangle carry a body via two
intermediate positions back into its initial position. The triangle is called
rotation triangle.
The theorem is illustrated in Fig. 1.7 . For the sake of simplicity, the
rotation triangle (P12,P23,P31) is drawn as planar triangle. Consider the
symmetrically located (spherical) triangle (P12,P∗
23,P31) . After the ﬁrst
rotation
(n12, ϕ12)
about P12 it has the position (P12,P23,P∗
31) shown
by dotted lines. After the second rotation
(n23, ϕ23) about P23 it is in
the position (P∗
12,P23,P31) . The same position is produced by the resul-
tant rotation
(n13, ϕ13) about P31 with ϕ13/2 being the external angle
of the rotation triangle (P12,P23,P31) . The internal angle at P31 equals
ϕ31/2 = π −ϕ13/2 = (2π −ϕ13)/2 . This is the statement made by the
theorem.
Remark: In the case of nearly parallel rotation axes, the spherical triangle
is a nearly planar triangle in a plane tangent to the sphere. All statements
remain valid also in the limiting case of parallel rotation axes. In this case,
the center 0 of the sphere is at inﬁnity, and the triangle is a planar triangle.
This special case is considered in Sect. 14.4 . There, the triangle is called pole
triangle.

1 Rotation about a Fixed Point. Reﬂection in a Plane
Through (1.77) the Rodrigues vector nij tan ϕij/2 of the rotation (nij, ϕij)
was introduced. It is abbreviated uij . Division of (1.128) through (1.127) es-
tablishes the relationship
u31 = −u12 + u23 −u12 × u23
1 −u12 · u23
.
(1.129)
An alternative expression for u31 is derived from the spherical triangle in
Fig. 1.6. Scalar multiplication of (1.128) by (n23 × n12) yields

(1.131)
n12 × n23 · n31 = sin α1 sin α3 sin ϕ31

(1.132)
The cosine law states that
sin α1 sin α3 cos ϕ31
2
= cos α2 −cos α1 cos α3
= n12 · n23 −(n12 · n31)(n23 · n31) = (n12 × n31) · (n23 × n31) . (1.133)
This equation in combination with (1.132) yields
tan ϕ31
2
=
n12 × n23 · n31
(n12 × n31) · (n23 × n31) .
(1.134)
Multiplication with n31 produces for the Rodrigues vector u31 the formula
n31 tan ϕ31
2
= (n12 × n31) × (n23 × n31)
(n12 × n31) · (n23 × n31) .
(1.135)
In contrast to (1.129) n31 appears on both sides of the equation. Equations
(1.128) – (1.135) remain valid after cyclic permutation of the indices.
1.10 Relationships Between four Positions
Two positions determine a rotation, and three positions determine a rotation
triangle. Hence four positions determine altogether six rotations and four ro-
tation triangles. All relative positions are known if the positions 2 , 3 and
4 relative to position 1 are known. These three relative positions are de-

termined by altogether nine parameters, namely, two spherical coordinates
for each of the three vertices P1k (identical with Pk1 ) and the rotation
angles ϕ1k (k = 2, 3, 4). In each rotation triangle the axes and the semi-
rotation angles are related according to Fig. 1.6 . Every vertex is vertex in
two triangles. The reason is that for any two triples of positions i, j, k and
i, j, ℓ
(i, j, k, ℓ= 1, 2, 3, 4 diﬀerent) the corresponding rotation triangles
(Pij,Pjk,Pki) and (Pij,Pjℓ,Pℓi) are sharing the vertex Pij. In both trian-
gles the angle
ϕij/2 occurs at Pij either as internal or as external angle.
Figure 1.8a illustrates the case when it is the internal angle and Fig. 1.8b
the case when it is the external angle. Equation (1.134) yields for tan ϕij/2
in the triangle (Pij,Pjk,Pki) the ﬁrst expression below and in the triangle
(Pij,Pjℓ,Pℓi) the second expression:
tan ϕij
2
=
nij · njk × nki
(nij × njk) · (nij × nki) ,
tan ϕij
2
=
nij · njℓ× nℓi
(nij × njℓ) · (nij × nℓi)
(1.136)
(i, j, k, ℓ= 1, 2, 3, 4 diﬀerent) . In each of the ﬁgures the vertices Pik , Pkj ,
Pjℓ, Pℓi deﬁne the quadrilateral (Pik,Pkj,Pjℓ,Pℓi) . Each side of the quadri-
lateral connects two vertices having one index in common. Diametrically op-
posite vertices have no index in common. In both ﬁgures the opposite sides
PjkPki and PjℓPℓi of the quadrilateral are seen from Pij under angles which
are either equal or which add up to π . From Pij also the opposite sides PkiPℓi
and PjkPjℓare seen under angles which are either equal or which add up
to π . It is a trivial statement that a side is seen from its endpoint under an
arbitrary angle. Therefore, also the following is true. From every vertex of
the quadrilateral each pair of opposite sides is seen under angles which are
either equal or which add up to π .

1 Rotation about a Fixed Point. Reﬂection in a Plane
The altogether six vertices are forming three quadrilaterals, namely,
(P12,P23,P34,P41) , (P13,P32,P24,P41) and (P12,P24,P43,P31) . From every
vertex every pair of opposite sides of every quadrilateral appears under angles
which are either equal or which add up to π .
In what follows, it is assumed that of the altogether six vertices only the
vertices of a single quadrilateral (Pik,Pkj,Pjℓ,Pℓi) are given. It is natural to
ask for all axial unit vectors n having the property that from the tip of n
opposite sides of the given quadrilateral appear under angles which are either
equal or which add up to π . The solution is found as follows. The vector n
must satisfy the condition that the two expressions given in (1.136), but with
n replacing nij , are identical. This is the conditional equation
(n·njk×nki)[(n×njℓ)·(n×nℓi)] = (n·njℓ×nℓi)[(n×njk)·(n×nki)] (1.137)
(i, j, k, ℓ= 1, 2, 3, 4 diﬀerent) . It is a third-order equation for n . All vectors
n satisfying the equation determine a third-order cone with the apex at
0. It is called rotation cone. Equation (1.137) is satisﬁed by the four vectors
n = njk , n = nki , n = njℓand n = nℓi . As ﬁfth vector nij any generator
of the rotation cone can be chosen which is not one of these four vectors. With
this vector nij all rotation triangles on the sphere are determined and with
them all rotation angles and also the sixth vector nkℓ. This vector, too, is
located on the rotation cone.
The four-position theory just described is due to Roth [27]. Details see in
Sects. 3.12 and 7.3 . Roth’ theory generalizes Burmester’s planar four-position
theory. This planar theory is the subject of Sect. 14.5 .
1.11 Cayley-Klein Parameters
This section starts out from (1.15) relating the coordinates of a body-ﬁxed
vector in positions r and r∗which are related by a direction cosine ma-
trix A12 (see Fig. 1.3). The matrix is expressed in terms of Euler-Rodrigues
parameters (see (1.79)):

New complex-valued parameters α and β are deﬁned by the equations
α = q0 + i q3 ,
β = −q2 + i q1 .
(1.140)
These parameters are referred to as Cayley-Klein parameters. The inverse
rotation has the Euler-Rodrigues parameters q0 , −q1 , −q2 , −q3 and, con-

sequently, the Cayley-Klein parameters ¯α (complex conjugate) and −β . The
Cayley-Klein parameters corresponding to the null rotation ( q0 = 1, q1 =
q2 = q3 = 0 ) are α = 1 , β = 0 . Equations (1.140) yield for the Euler-
Rodrigues parameters the expressions

q3 = −i
2(α −¯α) ,
q2 = −1
2(β + ¯β) ,
q1 = −i
2(β −¯β) .
(1.141)
With these expressions the matrix A12 is a function of α and β .
With the real vector coordinates ri (i = 1, 2, 3) of (1.138) new complex-
valued coordinates are deﬁned as follows:
ϱ1 = r1 + i r2 ,
ϱ2 = −r1 + i r2 ,
ϱ3 = −r3 .
(1.142)
By the same equations the coordinates r∗
i (i = 1, 2, 3) deﬁne new coordinates

(1.145)
This equation is simpler than its real counterpart (1.138). Of course, the
coeﬃcient matrix is not orthogonal, because ϱ1 , ϱ2 , ϱ3 are not coordinates
in a cartesian coordinate system. However, the inverse matrix is simple. It
is the matrix associated with the inverse rotation which has the parameters
(¯α, −β) instead of (α, β) .
Substitution of Eqs.(1.141) into the constraint equation q2

(2 × 2)-matrices of this form with determinant 1 constitute a group with
respect to multiplication. Indeed, it is easily veriﬁed that the product of two
such matrices U 1 and U 2 is itself an element of the group. The multiplication
is associative. The unit element of the group is the unit matrix I which
corresponds to the null rotation. For every element U of the group the inverse
element exists, namely, the matrix associated with the inverse rotation. This
is the transpose of the complex conjugate matrix. It is denoted ¯U
T . Indeed,

Equations (1.149) and (1.151) are formally identical with (1.99) and (1.100),

Theorem 1.6. The resultant of two rotations with matrices U 1 (ﬁrst rota-
tion) and U 2 is characterized by the Cayley-Klein parameters of the unitary
matrix
U res = U 2U 1 .
(1.153)
This equation expresses in terms of complex-valued quantities what (1.116)
expresses in terms of real-valued quantities. Equation (1.153) has the form
(1.148) if the second rotation is the inverse of the ﬁrst rotation.
In what follows, another proof of the theorem is given. Let H be the
matrix H = r1S1 + r2S2 + r3S3 with the coordinates of r in (1.138). The

by comparing with (1.145). Let now U 1 and U 2 be the matrices of two

This proves (1.153).
In what follows, still another relationship between the vectors r and r∗
is developed (Klein/Sommerfeld [12]). Without loss of generality, the vectors
are assumed to be unit vectors. They are represented by points on the unit
sphere centered at the origin of basis e1 (Fig. 1.9). The e1
1, e1
2-plane is re-
ferred to as equatorial plane and the tip of e1
3 as north pole. Both points
are projected from the north pole onto the equatorial plane by a so-called
stereographic projection (see the dashed lines). Projections of points in the
northern hemisphere (in the southern hemisphere) lie outside (inside) the
unit circle. The projections of r and r∗are denoted z and z∗, respec-
tively. They are interpreted as numbers z = z1 + i z2 and z∗= z∗
1 + i z∗
2
in the complex equatorial plane with e1
1 being the real axis and with e1
2
being the imaginary axis3. From the similarity of triangles it follows that

z = (r1 + i r2)/(1 −r3) = ϱ1/(ϱ3 + 1) . For z also the following represen-
tation is possible. The equation
r2
1 + r2
2 = 1 −r2
3 is written in the form
(r1 + i r2)(r1 −i r2) = (1 + r3)(1 −r3) and, because of (1.142), in the form
ϱ1ϱ2 = (ϱ3 + 1)(ϱ3 −1) . Hence
ϱ2/(ϱ3 −1) = (ϱ3 + 1)/ϱ1 = 1/z . The
same relationships are valid for the quantities bearing the asterisk. Only the
following relationships are used:
ϱ1 = z(ϱ3 + 1) ,
ϱ2 = 1
z (ϱ3 −1) ,
z∗=
ϱ∗

ϱ∗
3 + 1 .
(1.157)
In the third equation ϱ∗
1 and ϱ∗
3 are replaced by the expressions from (1.145).
Furthermore, the unit in the denominator is replaced by the expression α¯α+
β ¯β (see (1.146)). This results in the equation
z∗=
α2ϱ1 + β2ϱ2 + 2αβϱ3
−α¯βϱ1 + ¯αβϱ2 + (α¯α −β ¯β)ϱ3 + α¯α + β ¯β
=
α[αϱ1 + β(ϱ3 + 1)] + β[βϱ2 + α(ϱ3 −1)]
α[−¯βϱ1 + ¯α(ϱ3 + 1)] + β[¯αϱ2 −¯β(ϱ3 −1)] .
(1.158)
For ϱ1 and ϱ2 the expressions from (1.157) are substituted. This yields the
ﬁnal equation
z∗=
αz + β
−¯βz + ¯α .
(1.159)
Thus, z∗is a linear fractional function of z with coeﬃcients which are the
elements of the matrix U . Based on this equation a new proof of (1.153) is
given as follows. Let α1 , β1 be the Cayley-Klein parameters of the ﬁrst of two
successive rotations and let α2 , β2 be the parameters of the second rotation.
Let, furthermore z∗∗be the complex number after the second rotation. Then,
by these deﬁnitions,
z∗=
α1z + β1
−¯β1z + ¯α1
,
z∗∗=
α2z∗+ β2
−¯β2z∗+ ¯α2
.
(1.160)
Substitution of the ﬁrst expression into the second yields for z∗∗a linear
fractional function of z with coeﬃcients according to (1.153). End of proof.

1.12 Euler Vector. Exponential Form of the Direction
Cosine Matrix
The Euler vector of a rotation (n, ϕ) is deﬁned to be the vector ϕn . In the
bases e1 and e2 it has identical coordinate matrices ϕn . With these coordi-
nates the skew-symmetric matrix ϕ˜n is deﬁned. Proposition: The direction
cosine matrix is
A12 = eϕ˜n .
(1.161)
Proof: According to (1.37)
A12 = I + ˜n ˜n(1 −cos ϕ) + ˜n sin ϕ .
(1.162)
The exponential function is deﬁned by its Taylor series
eϕ˜n = I + ϕ˜n + 1
2!ϕ2˜n2 + 1
3!ϕ3˜n3 + . . . .
(1.163)
All terms ˜nk with k > 2 can be expressed either through ˜n or through
˜n2 . This is shown as follows. The vector
n × (n × r)
is
n(n · r) −r .
Therefore, n × [n × (n × r)] = −n × r . The coordinate form of this equation
is
˜n3r = −˜nr . From this it follows that
˜n3 = −˜n and by continued
multiplication: ˜n4 = −˜n2 , ˜n5 = −˜n3 = ˜n etc. Equation (1.163) becomes
eϕ˜n = I + ϕ˜n + 1

(1.164)
This is the expression in (1.162). End of proof.
Caution: In the case of real exponents a and b the formula ea eb = ea+b is
valid. It is this formula which makes the exponential function useful. In the
case of matrices A and B as exponents, the formula eA eB = eA+B is valid
if and only if A B = B A . Therefore, the equation
eϕ1˜n1eϕ2˜n2 = eϕ1˜n1+ϕ2˜n2
(1.165)
is valid if and only if n1 = n2 . This is the trivial case that both rotations are
carried out about one and the same axis. If the equation were generally true,
the resultant of two successive rotations
(n1, ϕ1) and
(n2, ϕ2) would be
obtained by the parallelogram rule: nresϕres = n1ϕ1 + n2ϕ2 . This is known
to be wrong. It is approximately valid if ϕ1 and ϕ2 are small.

introduced:
u = q
q0
= n tan ϕ
2 ,
(1.166)
r∗−r = u × (r∗+ r) .
(1.167)
The vector u has identical coordinates in bases e1 and e2 . These coordi-
nates are referred to as Rodrigues parameters. They are denoted u1 , u2 , u3 .
The coordinate matrix is denoted u , and the absolute value of the vector is
denoted u . The coordinates are not subject to any constraint equation. In
the critical case ϕ = ±π , the absolute value of u is inﬁnite. In this case,
the direction must be given by n . In what follows, it is assumed that u is
ﬁnite. From (1.166) it follows that

cos ϕ = 1 −u2

sin ϕ =

sions

If the matrix A12 is given, the Rodrigues parameters are obtained most
easily by ﬁrst calculating the Euler-Rodrigues parameters q0 , q1 , q2 , q3 from
(1.81) and (1.82) and by substituting them into (1.166):
˜u = ˜q

(A12 + I)−1(A12 −I) ,

(1.173)
Proof: Decomposition of (1.167) in basis e1 yields, in view of (1.15),
(A12 −I)r1 = ˜u(A12 + I)r1 and, consequently, the ﬁrst Eq.(1.173).
Using (1.10) it is shown that the matrix A12 + I has the determinant 2(1 +
tr A12) and the co-factors c11 = c22 = c33 = 1 + tr A12 , cij = a12

= 1
2(I −˜u) .
(1.174)
Resolving this equation for ˜u results in the third Eq.(1.173). Finally, substi-
tution into the ﬁrst Eq.(1.173) produces 2˜u = (A12 −I)(I −˜u) . Resolving
this equation for ˜u results in the second Eq.(1.173) which shows that the
product on the right-hand side is commutative. End of proof. For numerical
evaluations (1.171) is preferable.
Multiplication of (1.174) with (A12 + I) reveals the formula
A12A12 = tr A12(A12 −I) + A12T .
(1.175)
In contrast to the previous equations, this equation is valid also in the case
ϕ = 180◦when
tr A12 = −1 and
A12T = A12 . Through continued mul-
tiplication with A12 all powers (A12)n
(n ≥2 ) are expressed as linear
combinations of A12 , A12T and I .
For the Rodrigues vector ures of the resultant of two consecutive rotations
with Rodrigues vectors u1 (ﬁrst rotation) and u2 division of (1.119) through
(1.118) yields
ures = u1 + u2 −u1 × u2
1 −u1 · u2
.
(1.176)
This is known from (1.129) where u31 is −ures . In the special case of mu-
tually orthogonal rotation axes 1 and 2 the equation is
ures = u1 + u2 −u1 × u2 ,

σ = n tan ϕ

(1.182)
It has identical coordinates in the bases e1 and e2 . These coordinates are
referred to as Wiener parameters. They are denoted σ1 , σ2 , σ3 . The coor-
dinate matrix is denoted σ , and the absolute value of the vector is denoted
σ . The coordinates are not subject to any constraint equation. Relationships

Given two successive 180◦-rotations about axes with unit vectors n1 (ﬁrst
rotation) and n2 enclosing the angle 0 < α < π , determine the axis and
the angle of the resultant rotation.
Two methods of solution are presented. The ﬁrst method uses Eq.(1.45) for
rotation tensors, and the second method uses Eqs.(1.118) and (1.119) for
quaternions. The given rotations have the tensors
R1 = 2n1n1 −I and
R2 = 2n2n2 −I . The unknown tensor of the resultant rotation has the form
(1.40). Equation (1.45) without the subscript res has the form
−(1−cos ϕ)(I−nn)+sin ϕ n×I = 4(n2 ·n1)n2n1 −2n2n2 −2n1n1 . (1.190)

1.15 Illustrative Problems

Scalar multiplication from the right by n produces the equation
0 = n2[2(n2 · n1)(n1 · n) −(n2 · n)] −n1(n1 · n) .
(1.191)
The coeﬃcients of n2 and of n1 must both be zero. This requires that
n1 · n = 0 and n2 · n = 0 . Consequently,
n = ±n1 × n2
|n1 × n2| = ±n1 × n2
sin α
.
(1.192)
Arbitrarily, the positive sign is chosen. A unique solution for the angle re-
quires expressions for cos ϕ and for sin ϕ . An equation for cos ϕ is ob-
tained when (1.190) is scalar-multiplied from the left and from the right
by n1 . Taking into account that
n1 · n = 0 this results in the equation
1−cos ϕ = 2[1−(n1 ·n2)2] = 2(1−cos2 α) = 2 sin2 α , whence it follows that
cos ϕ = cos 2α .
(1.193)
In order to get an expression for sin ϕ (1.190) is scalar-multiplied from the
left by n2 and from the right by n1 . On the right-hand side this yields
zero. The equation reads (1 −cos ϕ)n2 · n1 + sin ϕ (n1 × n2)2/ sin α = 0 or
(1 −cos ϕ) cos α + sin ϕ sin α = 0 and with (1.193), ﬁnally,
sin α(sin 2α −
sin ϕ) = 0 . This together with (1.193) yields
ϕ = 2α .
(1.194)
The second method of solution using quaternions is much simpler. Equa-
tions (1.118) and (1.119) are formulated with
ϕ1 = −π
(equivalent to
ϕ1 = π ) and with ϕ2 = π . This produces directly the results ϕres = 2α ,
nres = n1 × n2/|n1 × n2| = n1 × n2/ sin α .
The results are summarized as follows. The resultant of two 180◦-rotations
about axes n1 (ﬁrst rotation) and n2 enclosing the angle 0 < α < π is a
rotation about the axis n1 ×n2/|n1 ×n2| through the angle 2α . In Sect. 1.5
it was shown that a 180◦-rotation about an axis n is equivalent to reﬂection
in the line n . Therefore, the result can also be stated as follows. The resultant
of two successive reﬂections in lines n1 (ﬁrst reﬂection) and n2 enclosing the
angle 0 < α < π is a rotation about the axis n1 ×n2/|n1 ×n2| through the
angle 2α . The two 180◦-rotations (reﬂections) are not commutative. Reversal
of the order has the eﬀect that the direction of the resultant rotation axis is
reversed. The resultant rotation does not change if the pair of vectors n1 ,
n2 is rotated in its own plane about the ﬁxed point and with the angle α
kept constant.

To be determined are all rotations (n, ϕ) resulting in positions which can be

The elements a11 = a , a12 = b and a33 = c of a direction cosine matrix A
are prescribed. To be determined are all direction cosine matrices A having
these elements. Necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the existence of real
matrices are to be formulated.

In what follows, this special case is excluded. The elements a21 , a22 , a31
and a32 are calculated from four linear equations expressing the fact that the
scalar product of rows 1 and 2 equals zero, and that every diagonal element
equals its own co-factor:
aa21 + ba22 + a13a23 = 0 ,
aa22 −ba21 = c ,
(1.201)
ac −a31a13 = a22 ,
a22c −a32a23 = a .
(1.202)
Equations (1.201) are solved for a21 and a22 . Upon substitution of the result
for a22 Eqs.(1.202) are uncoupled. Taking into account (1.198) the results
are written in the form
a21 = −a a13a23 + b c

Together with (1.198) these equations determine all matrices. For given num-
bers a , b and c satisfying conditions (1.199) and not representing the special
case a = b = c = 0 the number of real matrices is either four or two or one
depending on whether zero or one or both of the elements a13 and a23 are
zero. All matrix elements are rational, if the elements in row 1 and in column

1 Rotation about a Fixed Point. Reﬂection in a Plane
1.15.5 Rear Axle of a Vehicle
Figure 1.10a shows the simplest design of a rigid rear axle for road vehicles
(Matschinsky [15]). The axle is rigidly attached to a draw-bar which is sup-
ported in the car body by the spherical joint 0 . Another spherical joint B
connects the axle to a so-called sway bar or Panhard rod. The other end of
this rod is supported in the car body by still another spherical joint A . The
position of the axle relative to the car body is interpreted as the result of
two successive rotations. Prior to the ﬁrst rotation the bases e2 (ﬁxed on the
axle) and e1 (ﬁxed in the car body) coincide. The ﬁrst rotation about the
line A0 (unit vector n , rotation angle ϕ1 ) carries the axle-ﬁxed basis to
the intermediate position e2∗and point B to the position B∗. The second
rotation is executed about the axle-ﬁxed line B∗0 (unit vector n∗, rotation
angle ϕ2 ). In Fig. 1.10b the system is shown schematically in a vertical pro-
jection in the null position ϕ1 = ϕ2 = 0 . The ﬁgure shows also basis e1 and
the unit vectors n and n∗along the rotation axes. It is assumed that in the
null position the axle, the draw-bar and the Panhard rod are coplanar. The
lengths h , a , ℓ, b are given. Point B is moving along a circular path which
in the ﬁgure appears as straight line. To be determined are the coordinates
in e1 of the wheel centers P1 and P2 as functions of ϕ1 and ϕ2 .
Fig. 1.10 Rear axle seen in perspective (a) and in vertical projection (b)
Solution: The lengths h , a and ℓdetermine the angle α . For abbreviation
the quantities c = cos α and s = sin α are deﬁned. The vector n has in
e1 the coordinate matrix
[c
s
0]T , and the vector n∗has in
e2∗
the
coordinate matrix [c −s 0]T . With the coordinates of n and with ϕ = ϕ1

2 e2 . Consequently, the matrix
A12 in the relationship e1 = A12e2 is the product A12 = A12

not shown in the ﬁgure allow only small rotation angles. For this reason the
second-order approximation (1.55) is used. This yields the matrix

In basis e2 the wheel centers P1 and P2 have the constant coordinate ma-
trices [−h b

matrices in e1 are found by multiplication with A12 . The displacements of

1.15.6 Rotation Determined from Three Positions of a
Body-Fixed Point
When the body shown in Fig. 1.3 is rotated about n through angles
ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ3 , the body-ﬁxed point originally positioned by the vector r is
displaced into positions r1 , r2 , r3 , respectively. If only r1 , r2 , r3 of ar-
bitrary, but equal absolute values are given, the vector n and the angles
ϕ2 −ϕ1 and ϕ3 −ϕ1 are determined as follows. Since n is orthogonal to
r1 −r2 , r1 −r3 and r2 −r3 ,
n = (r1 −r2) × (r1 −r3)
|(r1 −r2) × (r1 −r3)| = r1 × r2 + r2 × r3 + r3 × r1
|(r1 −r2) × (r1 −r3)|
.
(1.206)
The product in the denominator can be replaced by the product of any two
vector diﬀerences. According to (1.77)
r2−r1 = n tan ϕ2 −ϕ1
2
×(r2+r1) ,
r3−r1 = n tan ϕ3 −ϕ1
2
×(r3+r1) .
(1.207)
With the expression for n the products are calculated:
n × (r2 + r1) = (r2 −r1) (r1 + r2) · (r2 −r3)
|(r1 −r2) × (r2 −r3)| ,
n × (r3 + r1) = (r3 −r1) (r1 + r3) · (r2 −r1)

1.15.7 Rodrigues Vector Determined from Prescribed
Point Displacements
A body with one point ﬁxed in a reference basis e1 is rotated from an initial
position into a ﬁnal position. Let P1 and P2 be two body-ﬁxed points which
together with the ﬁxed point of the body deﬁne a triangle (thus, the three
points are not collinear). In the initial position of the body P1 and P2 have
position vectors r1 and r2 in the reference basis e1 . In the ﬁnal position
they have position vectors r∗
1 and r∗
2 , where |r∗
1| = |r1| and |r∗
2| = |r2| .
The problem to be solved is the following. Given the pairs of vectors r1 , r2
and r∗
1 , r∗
2 , determine the Rodrigues vector u = n tan ϕ/2 (the axial vector
n if u →∞) of the rotation (n, ϕ) carrying the body from the initial to
the ﬁnal position.
Solution: The rotation angle is ϕ ̸= 0 since the two positions are not identical.
Let the points be labeled such that r∗
1 −r1 ̸= 0 and r∗
2 + r2 ̸= 0 . This is
always possible since at least one diﬀerence r∗
i −ri and at least one sum
r∗
i + ri (i = 1, 2) is diﬀerent from zero and since a diﬀerence and a sum
cannot both be zero. With this labeling all denominator expressions to come
are diﬀerent from zero.
Starting point of the analysis are Eqs.(1.167) and (1.43):
r∗
1 −r1 = u × (r∗
1 + r1) ,
r∗
2 −r2 = u × (r∗
2 + r2)
(ϕ ̸= ±π) . (1.210)
n = r∗
2 + r2
|r∗
2 + r2|
(ϕ = ±π) .
(1.211)
Equations (1.210) show that nonzero diﬀerences r∗
i −ri (i = 1, 2) are or-
thogonal to u . The second equation is cross-multiplied by r∗
1 −r1 . Because
of the said orthogonality this yields the equation
(r∗
1−r1)×(r∗
2−r2) = (r∗
1−r1)×[u×(r∗
2+r2)] = u (r∗
1−r1)·(r∗
2+r2) . (1.212)
Two cases have to be distinguished:
Case 1) (r∗
1 −r1) × (r∗
2 −r2) ̸= 0 : The desired solution is
u = n tan ϕ
2 = (r∗
1 −r1) × (r∗
2 −r2)
(r∗
1 −r1) · (r∗
2 + r2)
(r∗
1 −r1 not orthogonal to r∗
2 + r2)
(1.213)

1.15 Illustrative Problems
45
or ϕ = ±π with n given by (1.211) else.
Case 2) (r∗
1 −r1) × (r∗
2 −r2) = 0 : In this case, there exists a scalar λ such
that
r∗
2 −r2 = λ(r∗
1 −r1) .
(1.214)
The ﬁrst Eq.(1.210) is multiplied by λ , and then the second equation is
subtracted. This produces the equation
u × [λ(r∗
1 + r1) −(r∗
2 + r2)] = 0
(1.215)
and after combination with (1.214) the equations
u × (λr1 −r2) = 0 ,
u × (λr∗
1 −r∗
2) = 0 .
(1.216)
The nonzero vector
(λr1 −r2) of the ﬁrst equation lies in the plane Σ
spanned by r1 and r2 . The vector (λr∗
1 −r∗
2) of the second equation lies in
the plane Σ∗spanned by r∗
1 and r∗
2 . These two planes have either a line of
intersection (case 2a) or they are identical (case 2b).
Case 2a:
Equations (1.216) require that the Rodrigues vector u is collinear
with both the vector in Σ and the vector in Σ∗. From this it follows that
u lies in the line of intersection of the two planes, and that ϕ is the angle
between the normals to the planes. This result is expressed as follows (note
the rigid-body property |r1 × r2| = |r∗
1 × r∗
2| ) :
n sin ϕ = (r1 × r2) × (r∗
1 × r∗

(r1 × r2)2
,
cos ϕ = (r1 × r2) · (r∗
1 × r∗
2)
(r1 × r2)2
. (1.217)
Case 2b:
The solution is ϕ = ±π with n given by (1.211).
1.15.8 Spherical Interpolation
Let r1 and r2 ̸= ±r1 be the coordinate matrices in basis e1 of two unit
vectors locating two points of a unit circle. Proposition: With the enclosed
angle α = cos−1(rT
1 r2)
r(ψ) = r1 sin(α −ψ) + r2 sin ψ
sin α
(1.218)
is a parameter equation, with parameter ψ , of the unit circle. Proof:
rT r sin2 α = [rT
1 sin(α −ψ) + rT
2 sin ψ][r1 sin(α −ψ) + r2 sin ψ]
= sin(α −ψ)[sin(α −ψ) + 2 cos α sin ψ] + sin2 ψ
= sin2 α cos2 ψ −cos2 α sin2 ψ + sin2 ψ = sin2 α .
(1.219)

1 Rotation about a Fixed Point. Reﬂection in a Plane
Hence rT r ≡1 . End of proof.
In three-dimensional space (1.218) is the equation of the great circle pass-
ing through two points r1 and r2 on the unit sphere. The equation is used
for locating points on Earth. In terms of geographical longitude λ and lati-
tude φ the coordinate matrix is r(ψ) = [ cos λ cos φ
sin λ cos φ
sin φ ]T .
With this equation ψ is converted into λ and φ .
In four-dimensional space the column matrix [ q0 q1 q2 q3 ]T of the Euler-
Rodrigues parameters associated with the angular position of a body is the
unit vector r . This vector r and the vector −r determine one and the
same angular position. Equation (1.218) is used for the animation of motion.
Two angular positions 1 and 2 determine associated vectors r1 and r2
enclosing the angle α = cos−1(rT
1 r2) . When ψ is prescribed as function of
time ψ(t) , the Euler-Rodrigues parameters r(ψ(t)) determine a tumbling
motion leading the body through position 1 ( ψ = 0 ) and position 2 ( ψ =
α ) . In computer animations this tumbling motion is more attractive than the
alternative possibility of rotating the body about a ﬁxed axis from position
1 into position 2 .
Equation (1.218) is not applicable to the interpolation between more than
two angular positions. An ordered sequence of m > 2 angular positions
can be interpolated as follows. The positions must be speciﬁed by rotations
(ni, ϕi) (i = 1, . . . , m) . The unit vectors ni deﬁne points Pi on the unit
sphere with associated geographical longitudes λi and latitudes φi (i =
1, . . . , m) . With a parameter t the three sequences of scalars λi , φi and ϕi
(i = 1, . . . , m) are interpolated in a form λ(t) , φ(t) , ϕ(t) such that λ(t =
ti) = λi , φ(t = ti) = φi , ϕ(t = ti) = ϕi (i = 1, . . . , m) . The functions λ(t)
and φ(t) determine the unit vector n(t) of the angular position (n(t), ϕ(t)) .
It is the desired interpolation.
1.15.9 Rotations Eﬀecting a Prescribed Line
Displacement
To be determined are all rotations (n, ϕ) about a ﬁxed point 0 which carry
a body-ﬁxed point from a given position r1 into another given position r2 .
Without loss of generality, it is assumed that r1 and r2 are unit vectors.
The problem can also be formulated as follows. Determine all rotations (n, ϕ)
about a ﬁxed point 0 which carry a body-ﬁxed line passing through 0 from
a given position r1 into another given position r2 .
Solution: In the special case r2 = −r1 , every rotation (n, ϕ = ±π) about
an axis n orthogonal to r1 , r2 is a solution. In what follows, it is assumed
that
r2 ̸= −r1 . In Fig. 1.11a the vectors r1 and r2 are shown in their
own plane, and in Fig. 1.11b they are shown in a projection in which they
coincide. Let α be the angle which rotates r1 in the projection (a) into

1.15 Illustrative Problems
47
Fig. 1.11 Axes n of rotations carrying r1 into position r2 lie in the n1, n3-plane
position r2 . Without loss of generality, it is assumed that 0 < α < π . Two
special solutions are obvious by inspection, namely, the rotations (n1, ±π)
and (n3, α) with axial unit vectors
n1 = r1 + r2
2 cos α
2
,
n3 = r1 × r2
sin α
.
(1.220)
Together with n2 = n3 × n1 these vectors deﬁne a right-handed cartesian
basis. In this basis the given vectors are
r1,2 = n1 cos α
2 ∓n2 sin α
2 .
(1.221)
Every rotation (n, ϕ) solving the problem has the property that r1 and r2
are generators of a circular cone with n as cone axis. From this it follows that
all unit vectors n lie in the plane of n1 and n3 . Furthermore, it is obvious
that every vector in this plane is a solution n . With a free parameter ψ it
is written in the form
n(ψ) = n1 cos ψ −n3 sin ψ .
(1.222)
As is shown in the ﬁgure, ψ is the angle from n1 to n in the positive math-
ematical sense around n2 . The angles associated with the special solutions
(n1, ±π) and (n3, α) are ψ = 0 and ψ = −π/2 , respectively. The general
relationship ϕ(ψ) is deduced from (1.37) which, in this case, has the form
r2 = r1 + (1 −cos ϕ)[(n · r1)n −r1] + sin ϕ n × r1 .
(1.223)
Scalar multiplications by r1 and by n × r1 eliminate the expression with
sin ϕ and the expression with (1 −cos ϕ) , respectively. For this purpose the
following products are calculated from (1.221) and (1.222):
(n · r1)2

hold: |α| ≤|ϕ| ≤π .

1.15.10 Sensor Calibration
On the end-eﬀector of a robot a basis e1 is ﬁxed. Another basis e2 is ﬁxed on
a sensor which is rigidly attached to the end-eﬀector. Let X be the unknown
direction cosine matrix relating these bases: e1 = X e2 . The determination
of X from measured data is referred to as sensor calibration. Two methods
based on diﬀerent measured data are described.
Method 1 : The measured data are the coordinate matrices of two arbitrarily
chosen noncollinear body-ﬁxed unit vectors n1 and n2 in both bases. They
are denoted as usual: n1

its transpose. In the case of nonorthogonal vectors the ith row (i = 1, 2, 3)

1 Rotation about a Fixed Point. Reﬂection in a Plane
End of example.
In numerous articles published in the robotics literature the solution is
attempted by the following diﬀerent method. The rigid body composed of
end-eﬀector and sensor is subjected to a rotation (n , ϕ) . This rotation carries
the bases e1 and e2 into new positions e1∗and e2∗, respectively. The
measured data is the pair of direction cosine matrices A and B in the
relationships
e1 = A e1∗
(a) ,
e2 = B e2∗
(b) .
(1.234)
The bases e1 and e2 are related through X in the initial as well as in the
ﬁnal position. This is expressed by the equations
e1 = X e2
(a) ,
e1∗= X e2∗
(b) .
(1.235)
Applying (1.235)a , (1.234)b , (1.235)b , (1.234)a in this order results in the
equation
e1 = X e2 = X B e2∗= X B XT e1∗= X B XT AT e1 .
(1.236)
Hence X B XT AT = I or A X = X B . A single rotation does not suﬃce.
Two rotations (n1 , ϕ1) and (n2 , ϕ2) about arbitrarily chosen noncollinear
unit vectors n1 , n2 and through arbitrary angles ϕ1 , ϕ2 yield two equations
Ai X = X Bi
(i = 1, 2)
(1.237)
with measured matrices Ai , Bi (i = 1, 2) . Articles in the robotics literature
were devoted to solving these equations numerically. Various complicated
iterative methods were proposed for this purpose. Both equations together
represent a set of eighteen homogeneous linear equations for the elements of
X . For having a nontrivial solution the matrices Ai , Bi (i = 1, 2) must be
compatible. The oﬀ-diagonal elements of Ai , Bi determine the coordinates
in e1 and in e2 , respectively, of the body-ﬁxed vector mi = ni sin ϕi (see
(1.52)). Compatibility requires that m1 · m1 , m2 · m2 and m1 · m2 be the
same with both sets of coordinates.
By writing (1.237) in the form Ai = X Bi XT
Ai is expressed as similar-
ity transform of Bi . Application of Theorem 1.3 (Eq.(1.24)) to this equation
leads directly to (1.230).
Angeles [3] proposes a combination of both methods by formulating (1.230)
not in terms of the coordinates of n1 , n2 and n1 × n2 , but in terms of the
coordinates of m1 , m2 and m1 × m2 calculated from measured matrices
Ai , Bi (i = 1, 2) .

1.15.11 Decomposition of a Rotation into three
Rotations
The material of this section and of the next section was published in Witten-
burg/Lilov [32]. Earlier contributions to the subject were made by Davenport
[6] and Wohlhart [33]. In the nonorthogonal gimbal suspension system of Fig.
1.12 the inner axis has the direction n1 , and the outer axis has the direction
n3 . If three rotations (n1, ϕ1) , (n2, ϕ2) , (n3, ϕ3) are carried out in this
order, all three rotation axes n1 , n2 , n3 are given in the outer (base-ﬁxed)
reference frame. Let (n, ϕ) be the resultant of this sequence of rotations. Its
tensor R(n, ϕ) is the product of the tensors of the three individual rotations
(see (1.45)):
R(n, ϕ) = R(n3, ϕ3) · R(n2, ϕ2) · R(n1, ϕ1) .
(1.238)
The problem to be solved is the following. The unit vector n and the angle ϕ
of the resultant rotation (n, ϕ) and, furthermore, the unit vectors n1 , n2 ,
n3 of the individual rotations are given. To be determined are the angles
ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ3 . The vectors n1 , n2 , n3 are neither coplanar nor pairwise
orthogonal. The relative orientation of the four vectors is speciﬁed by the six
parameters
ai = nj · nk ,
bi = n · ni
(i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 diﬀerent) .

Solution: Comparison of Fig. 1.12 with Fig. 1.2b shows: If n3 , n2 , n1 form
a right-hand cartesian basis e1
1 , e1
2 , e1
3 , the angles ϕ3 , ϕ2 , ϕ1 represent, in
this order, the Bryan angles φ1 , φ2 , φ3, respectively. This particular case is
characterized by the parameters ai = 0 , a = −1 and bi = ci (i = 1, 2, 3).
The solutions ϕ1 = φ3 , ϕ2 = φ2 and ϕ3 = φ1 are calculated from (1.35)
with the matrix elements of (1.49) with bi instead of ni (i = 1, 2, 3).
In the general case, the solution is found from (1.238) as follows. Two
scalar multiplications, one from the left by R(−n3, ϕ3) and the other from
the right by R(−n1, ϕ1) , produce the equation (see the identities (1.46))
R(n2, ϕ2) = R(−n3, ϕ3) · R(n, ϕ) · R(−n1, ϕ1) .
(1.242)
Scalar multiplication of this equation from the left by n3 eliminates ϕ3 , and
scalar multiplication from the right by n1 eliminates ϕ1 . This follows from
the identities (1.41). Thus, a scalar equation for the single unknown ϕ2 is
obtained by carrying out both multiplications:
n3 · R(n2, ϕ2) · n1 = n3 · R(n, ϕ) · n1 .
(1.243)
Two coupled scalar equations for the two unknowns ϕ3 and ϕ2 are produced
by multiplying (1.242) from the left by n2 and from the right by n1 and by
multiplying from both sides by n1 , respectively:
n2 · n1 = n2 · R(−n3, ϕ3) · R(n, ϕ) · n1 ,
n1 · R(n2, ϕ2) · n1 = n1 · R(−n3, ϕ3) · R(n, ϕ) · n1 .
 
(1.244)
Finally, two coupled scalar equations for the two unknowns ϕ1 and ϕ2 are
produced by multiplying from the left by n3 and from the right by n2 and
by multiplying from both sides by n3 , respectively:
n3 · n2 = n3 · R(n, ϕ) · R(−n1, ϕ1) · n2 ,
n3 · R(n2, ϕ2) · n3 = n3 · R(n, ϕ) · R(−n1, ϕ1) · n3 .
 
(1.245)
These equations are obtained from (1.244) by interchanging the indices 1 and
3 . Hence the solution for ϕ1 is obtained from the solution for ϕ3 by this
interchange of indices. For this reason only (1.243) and (1.244) are considered.
The tensors are given in (1.40), for example,
R(n, ϕ) = nn + cos ϕ(I −nn) + sin ϕ n × I
(1.246)
and similarly R(ni, ϕi) . First, the vectors are calculated:

The coeﬃcient C2 is the only one which depends explicitly on ϕ2 . Each
solution
cos ϕ2 of (1.248) determines the associated solutions for
cos ϕ3
and sin ϕ3 . The associated solutions for cos ϕ1 and sin ϕ1 are obtained
by interchanging the indices 1 and 3 .
Example: Let the given resultant rotation (n, ϕ) be the rotation ϕ = 0 .
The vector n is unspeciﬁed. Obviously, ϕ1 = ϕ2 = ϕ3 = 0 is a solution.
Equations (1.248), (1.251) and Eqs.(1.251) with indices 1 and 3 interchanged
determine two solutions. In the case ϕ = 0 , these three equations have the
special forms

are ϕ1 = ϕ2 = ϕ3 = π . End of example.

Γ is the complete unit circle if and only if r1,2 ≥1 . In the case a1 = a3 = 0 ,
these conditions are satisﬁed for arbitrary quantities
b1 , b3 . In the case
b1 = b3 = 0 , they are satisﬁed if and only if
a1 = a3 = 0 . Because
of (1.239) this means: The solutions (1.250) for ϕ2 are real for arbitrary
resultant rotations (n, ϕ) if and only if n2 is orthogonal to both n1 and
n3 . This is an important result. It means that the gimbal suspension system
of Fig. 1.12 is capable of producing arbitrary angular orientations of the
suspended body if and only if the axis between inner and outer gimbal is
orthogonal to both the ﬁxed outer gimbal axis and the axis between body and
inner gimbal. Commonly used gimbal suspension systems have this property.
Indeterminacy conditions: From Euler angles as well as from Bryan angles the
phenomenon of gimbal lock is known. The angles are not fully determinate

lock. In the case of Euler angles, only θ and either ψ + φ or ψ −φ are
determinate. In the case of Bryan angles, only φ2 and either
φ1 + φ3 or
φ1 −φ3 are determinate. The same phenomenon occurs here. Under certain
conditions for the given quantities n , ϕ , n1 , n2 and n3 the gimbals in Fig.
1.12 are locked. In this case, only ϕ2 and either ϕ1 + ϕ3 or ϕ1 −ϕ3 are

1.15.12 Decomposition of a Rotation into three
Rotations. Quaternion Formulation
In this section the problem posed in the previous section is solved by means of
quaternions. Let D be the quaternion of the given resultant rotation (n, ϕ) ,
and let D1 , D2 , D3 be the quaternions of the three rotations
(n1, ϕ1) ,
(n2, ϕ2) and (n3, ϕ3) , respectively. According to Theorem 1.4 (Eq.(1.116))
these quaternions satisfy the equation
D3D2D1 = D .

According to (1.107)
D =

The quaternions D1 , D2 , D3 are given by the same formula with the re-
spective index added everywhere. For the cosines and sines of half-angles the
following abbreviations are deﬁned:
Ci = cos ϕi
2 ,
Si = sin ϕi
2
(i = 1, 2, 3) ,
C = cos ϕ
2 , S = sin ϕ
2 . (1.262)
With this notation the quaternions are
Di = (Ci, niSi)
(i = 1, 2, 3) and
D = (C, nS) . Equation (1.260) becomes
(C3, n3S3)(C2, n2S2)(C1, n1S1) = (C, nS) .
(1.263)
The product is formulated in two steps. In the ﬁrst step the product
(C2, n2S2)(C1, n1S1) is calculated. According to the rule (1.98) it is the
quaternion
(C1C2 −n1 · n2 S1S2 , n1 S1C2 + n2 C1S2 −n1 × n2 S1S2) .
(1.264)
After another application of the product rule the scalar part and the vector
part of (1.263) are

Rodrigues [25] expressed the opinion that the equations cannot be solved
for the unknown angles ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ3 . As will be seen they can be solved. The
vector part of the equation is scalar-multiplied by n1 , by n2 and by n3 . The
scalar part and the three component equations are written as linear equations
for C1 and S1 :

This system of equations is invariant with respect to an interchange of the
indices 1 and 3 . More precisely, the ﬁrst as well as the third equation is
individually invariant whereas the second and the fourth are invariant as a
set. This invariance conﬁrms what is known from Sect. 1.15.11 . The solution
for ϕ1 is obtained from the solution for ϕ3 by interchanging the indices 1
and 3 .
The ﬁrst two equations have the special forms
p C1 + q S1 = C
and
−q C1 + p S1 = b1S with coeﬃcients p and q which are linear with respect
to
C2 , S2 , C3 , S3 . The sum of squares of the equations is the equation
p2 + q2 = C2 + b2
1S2 . The right-hand side expression is a given constant.

1.15 Illustrative Problems
57
The left-hand side expression represents the coeﬃcient determinant of the
original two equations. The equation is used in two ways. First, it is used as
an equation for the unknowns ϕ2 and ϕ3 . Second, the original two equations
are solved for C1 and S1 . Since the coeﬃcient determinant is constant,
the resulting expressions are linear with respect to C2 , S2 , C3 , S3 . These
expressions are then substituted into the third and the fourth Eq.(1.267).
This procedure results in two more equations for the unknowns ϕ2 and ϕ3 .
In each of the three equations the circular functions C2 , S2 , C3 , S3 appear
in products which allow the return from half-angles to full angles (the possible
return to the full angle ϕ is postponed until later). As a result of the said
algebraic manipulations the following equations are obtained:

Eqs.(1.268) – (1.270) are three compatible equations for only two unknowns.
The said linear combination eliminates ϕ3 . In the resulting equation ϕ2 is
the single unknown. As should be expected, this equation is Eq.(1.248). It
has the solutions ϕ21 and ϕ22 given in (1.250). For each solution any two of
the Eqs.(1.268) – (1.270) represent a system of two linear equations for the
associated solutions cos ϕ3 and sin ϕ3 and after interchanging the indices
1 and 3 for the solutions cos ϕ1 and sin ϕ1 . This concludes the solution
of Eqs.(1.267).
In Sect. 1.15.11 it has been said that the angles ϕ1 and ϕ3 are individually
indeterminate, if the given quantities satisfy the conditions (1.258). Under
these conditions the solution is given by Eqs.(1.259). The same conditions
and the same resulting equations can be deduced directly from (1.267). This
is left to the reader.
1.16 Reﬂection in a Plane
Subject of this section are reﬂections of points in a plane (Fig. 1.13). The
plane is referred to as reﬂecting plane. Points as well as the reﬂecting plane
are deﬁned in a reference basis e with origin 0 . The plane is determined
by its unit normal vector m (sense of direction arbitrary) and by the vector
r0 = r0m to the foot A0 of the perpendicular from 0 onto the plane. Let r
be the position vector of an arbitrary point P and let, furthermore, r∗be
the position vector of the reﬂection P∗of P . Reﬂection in a plane is deﬁned
as follows (compare the deﬁnition of reﬂection in a line following Eq.(1.42)).
P∗is the reﬂection of P if
- the line PP
∗intersects the reﬂecting plane orthogonally
- the point of intersection is midpoint of PP
∗.
Figure 1.13 shows that this deﬁnition is expressed by the equation

= m[m · (r −r0)] .
(1.274)
Taking into account the identity mm · r0 = mr0 = r0 the solution for r∗is
r∗= (I −2mm) · r + 2r0
(1.275)
= S · r + 2r0 .
(1.276)
The tensor
S = I −2mm
(1.277)
is called reﬂection tensor. It satisﬁes the equation
S · S = I .
(1.278)
The tensor has the single eigenvalue
λ1 = −1
and the double eigenvalue
λ2 = +1 . The eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue λ1 = −1 is m .
Every vector n in the reﬂecting plane, i.e., normal to m , is an eigenvector
associated with the eigenvalue λ2 = +1 . This is expressed by the equations
(I −2mm) · m = −m ,
(I −2mm) · n = n .
(1.279)
Proposition 1 : Reﬂection is involutoric (two reﬂections of a point P in
succession in one and the same plane result in the original point P ). Proof:
Twofold application yields the identity:
(I −2mm) · [(I −2mm) · r + 2r0] + 2r0 ≡r . End of proof.
Proposition 2 : Reﬂections are length- as well as angle-preserving. Proof: It
suﬃces to show that in the case r0 = 0 (point 0 is in the reﬂecting plane),
vectors r1 and r2 from 0 to points P1 and P2 , respectively, satisfy the
equation r∗
1 · r∗
2 = r1 · r2 . In the special case r1 = r2 , this equation proves
that length is preserved. Equation (1.276) yields
r∗
1 · r∗
2 = [r1 −2m(m · r1)] · [r2 −2m(m · r2)]
= r1 · r2 + (m · r1)(m · r2)(−2 −2 + 4) = r1 · r2 .
(1.280)
End of proof.
Proposition 3 : The reﬂection e∗of a right-handed cartesian basis e is a
left-handed cartesian basis. Proof: Again, it suﬃces to consider the special
case r0 = 0 . Since lengths as well as right angles are preserved, it suﬃces
to show that e∗
1 · e∗
2 × e∗
3 = −1 . First, the cross product is calculated:
e∗
2 × e∗
3 = [e2 −2m(m · e2)] × [e3 −2m(m · e3)]
= e2 × e3 −2(e2 × m)(m · e3) −2(m × e3)(m · e2) . (1.281)
With this expression another application of (1.276) yields

= 1 −2 = −1 .
(1.282)
End of proof.
Example: Equation (1.275) is applied to the planar problem shown in Fig.
1.14 . The vectors m , r0 and r are in the x, y-plane of an x, y, z-system.
Then also r∗is in this plane. This is the special case of reﬂection of the
x, y-plane in a line located in this plane. The line is deﬁned by the angle
α measured counterclockwise from the x-axis and by the coordinate a of
the point of intersection A with the x-axis. The unit vector m has the
coordinates [sin α −cos α]T . Furthermore, r0 = m a sin α . The coordinates
of r and r∗are denoted
[x

and
[x∗

(1.275) yields the coordinate equation

Next, the resultant of two successive reﬂections in diﬀerent planes is in-
vestigated. The ﬁrst reﬂection with tensor S1 = I −2m1m1 and with vector
r01 is followed by the reﬂection with tensor
S2 = I −2m2m2
and with
vector r02 . A point originally located at r is after the ﬁrst reﬂection in the
position S1 · r + 2r01 and after the second reﬂection in the position
r∗= S2 · (S1 · r + 2r01) + 2r02 = S2 · S1 · r + 2(S2 · r01 + r02) .
(1.284)
The special case of parallel planes:
This case is characterized by m1 = m2 = m ; r01 and r02 collinear; S2 =
S1 = I −2mm ; S2 · S1 = I and S2 · r01 = −r01 . Hence the

Theorem 1.7. The resultant displacement r∗−r caused by two successive
reﬂections in parallel planes with collinear vectors r01 (ﬁrst reﬂection) and
r02 is the translation 2(r02 −r01) by twice the distance of the two planes
in the direction normal to the planes. The translation changes sign when the
order of reﬂections is changed.
Next, the general case of reﬂections in nonparallel planes is investigated. The
planes intersect in a line which, being normal to both m1 and m2 , has the
direction of m1 × m2 . Without loss of generality the origin 0 is placed on
this line so that r01 = r02 = 0 . Equation (1.284) becomes
r∗= (I −2m2m2) · (I −2m1m1) · r = (2m2m2 −I) · (2m1m1 −I) · r . (1.285)
According to (1.42) the last two tensors are the tensors of 180◦-rotations
about the axes m1 and m2 , respectively. Hence the resultant reﬂection
equals the resultant of two 180◦-rotations about m1 (ﬁrst rotation) and
m2 . This resultant rotation was investigated in Sect. 1.15.2. The results are
summarized in
Theorem 1.8. The resultant of two successive reﬂections in nonparallel
planes with unit normal vectors m1 (ﬁrst reﬂection) and m2 enclosing
the angle
0 < α < π is a rotation through the angle 2α about the axis
m1 × m2/|m1 × m2| . This axis is the line of intersection of the two planes.
The resultant rotation does not change if the two planes are rotated about
their line of intersection with the angle α kept constant. The sense of rota-
tion is reversed when the order of reﬂections is changed. In the special case
of mutually perpendicular planes ( α = π/2 , 180◦-rotation about the line of
intersection) , the ﬁnal position is independent of the order of reﬂections.
A consequence of this theorem is
Theorem 1.9. Any sequence of an even number of reﬂections in planes pass-
ing through a common point 0 is equivalent to a rotation about an axis passing
through 0 .
Indeed, each pair of consecutive reﬂections is equivalent to a rotation, and
the resultant of an arbitrary number of rotations is equivalent to a single
rotation.

Line Geometry
Line geometry was invented by Pl¨ucker. The basic idea is to consider as
elements of three-dimensional space not points with point coordinates, but
lines with line coordinates. A line is understood to be a straight line. In the
present chapter some basic elements of line geometry are introduced.

2.1 Normal Vector of a Plane. Equation of a Plane
Figure 2.1a shows a plane in a cartesian basis with origin 0 . The plane does
not pass through 0 . Let P0 be the foot of the perpendicular from 0 onto the
plane, and let, furthermore, d > 0 be the length of this perpendicular. The
normal vector m of the plane is deﬁned to be the vector having the absolute
value |m| = 1/d and the direction from P0 to 0 . The position vector of P0
is −m/m2 . The vector r of an arbitrary point located in the plane satisﬁes
the equation
m · r = −1 .
(2.1)
From the coordinate form mxx+myy +mzz = −1 it is seen that the points
of intersection of the plane with the coordinate axes have the coordinates
x = −1/mx , y = −1/my and z = −1/mz , respectively.
If the plane passes through 0 (Fig. 2.1b), Eq.(2.1) is replaced by
m · r = 0 ,
(2.2)
where m is a vector normal to the plane with arbitrary absolute value |m| ̸=
0 and with arbitrary sense of direction.

2.2 Pl¨ucker Vectors. Pl¨ucker Coordinates of a Line
Figure 2.2 shows a line in a cartesian basis with origin 0 . The line is uniquely
determined by two points P and P′ with position vectors r and r′, respec-
tively. The line is also uniquely determined by the vectors
v = r′ −r ,
w = r × v = r × r′ .
(2.3)
These vectors satisfy the constraint equations
v2 = const ̸= 0 ,
v · w = 0 .
(2.4)
The vectors v and w are called ﬁrst and second Pl¨ucker vector of the line,
and their cartesian coordinates are called Pl¨ucker coordinates of the line.
Equations (2.4) are two constraint equations for the altogether six vector
coordinates. That four scalar quantities deﬁne a line is seen also as follows.
Choose an arbitrary x, y, z-system in which the line has points of intersection
with the x, y-plane and with the x, z-plane. Each of these points has two
coordinates. In what follows, we speak of lines (v, w) . The ﬁrst Pl¨ucker
vector v determines the direction of the line, and the second represents the
moment of the ﬁrst with respect to 0 . The line is uniquely determined by its
Pl¨ucker vectors because Eqs.(2.3) yield as equation of the line
r(λ) = λv + v × w
v2
(2.5)
where λ is a free parameter. The perpendicular from 0 onto the line is
r(0) = v × w
v2
.
(2.6)
The line passes through 0 if w = 0 . Multiplication of both Pl¨ucker vectors

2.3 Reﬂection in a Line
65
Fig. 2.2 Pl¨ucker vectors of a line
by an arbitrary common factor does not change the line. In the case v2 = 1 ,
the Pl¨ucker vectors are said to be normalized.
A line (v, w) lies in a plane given by either (2.1) or (2.2) if and only if
the following conditions are satisﬁed:
v · m = 0 ,
w × m =
" −v
(Eq.(2.1); plane not passing through 0)
0
(Eq.(2.2); plane passing through 0) .
(2.7)
This is seen as follows. The ﬁrst equation is obviously true. Consequently,
w × m = (r × v) × m = (m · r)v −(v · m)r = (m · r)v .
(2.8)
This together with (2.1) and (2.2) yields the second Eq.(2.7).
2.3 Reﬂection in a Line
From Sect. 1.5 it is known that reﬂection in a line is equivalent to 180◦-
rotation about the line (see (1.42)). In the present section the reﬂecting line
is not required to pass through the origin 0 of the reference frame. The line
is given by its normalized Pl¨ucker vectors v and w . Equation (2.5) of the
line (v, w) is
r(λ) = λv + v × w .
(2.9)
Let z be the position vector of an arbitrary point P , and let, furthermore,
z∗be the position vector of the reﬂection P∗of P . By the deﬁnition of
reﬂection in the line the vector (z∗+z)/2 is position vector r1 = r(λ1) of a
point on the line. In addition, z∗−z is normal to the line. Hence z∗= 2r1−z
and v · (r1 −z) = 0 . With r1 = λ1v + v × w the latter condition yields
λ1 = v · z and, consequently,
z∗= 2(v · zv + v × w) −z = (2v v −I ) · z + 2v × w .
(2.10)
The tensor is known from (1.42). The vector 2v×w is twice the perpendicular
from 0 onto the reﬂecting line. With the vector rA of an arbitrary point A

66
2 Line Geometry
on the line the second Pl¨ucker vector is w = rA × v . With this expression
the equation can be given the more useful form
z∗= 2rA −z + 2v v · (z −rA) .
(2.11)
2.4 Pl¨ucker Vectors of the Line of Intersection of two
Planes
A line (v, w) need not be determined by two points. It may just as well be
deﬁned as intersection line of two nonparallel planes. Therefore, it is possible
to express the Pl¨ucker vectors v and w in terms of the normal vectors m1
and m2 appearing in Eqs.(2.1) or (2.2) of two planes. The desired expres-
sions are derived from (2.7). The ﬁrst equation requires that v be orthogonal
to both m1 and m2 so that w = r×v lies in the plane of m1 and m2 . An
appropriate ansatz is v = m1×m2 , w = μ1m1+μ2m2 with unknown coeﬃ-
cients μ1 , μ2 . These coeﬃcients are obtained from two equations expressing
the second Eq.(2.7). Three cases have to be distinguished.
Case a: None of the two planes is passing through 0 . In this case, the equa-
tions read
(μ1m1 + μ2m2) × mi = −m1 × m2
(i = 1, 2) .
(2.12)
This yields μ1 = −1 , μ2 = 1 . Hence the desired Pl¨ucker vectors are
v = m1 × m2 ,
w = m2 −m1 .
(2.13)
Case b: Exactly one of the planes, say the plane with m1 , passes through 0 .
Then (2.12) must be satisﬁed for i = 2 , so that μ1 = −1 , again. For plane
1 the pertinent equation is the second Eq.(2.7). It yields μ2 = 0 . Thus, the
solution is
v = m1 × m2 ,
w = −m1 .
(2.14)
Case c: Both planes are passing through 0 . Then also the line of intersection
passes through 0 . Hence v = m1 × m2 , w = 0 .
2.5 Condition for two Lines to Intersect
Let (v1, w1) and (v2, w2) be two nonparallel lines, which means that v1 ×
v2 ̸= 0 (Fig. 2.3). No matter whether the lines intersect or not, they have a
uniquely deﬁned common perpendicular. It has the direction of v1 × v2 . Let
n be the unit vector in this direction, and let, furthermore, r1 and r2 be

2.5 Condition for two Lines to Intersect
67
Fig. 2.3 Skew lines and common perpendicular
the vectors to the points where the perpendicular intersects the lines. With
these vectors the quantities ℓand α are deﬁned (positive or negative):
r2 −r1 = ℓn ,
v1 × v2 = n|v1 × v2| = n|v1||v2| sin α .
(2.15)
|ℓ| is the length of the common perpendicular, and α is the angle, right-
handed about n , which turns v1 into the direction of v2 . The second
Pl¨ucker vectors of the lines are w1 = r1 × v1 ,
w2 = r2 × v2 . With these
vectors the expression is formulated:
v1 · w2 + v2 · w1 = v1 · r2 × v2 + v2 · r1 × v1 = −r2 · v1 × v2 + r1 · v1 × v2
= (r1 −r2) · v1 × v2 = −ℓ|v1 × v2| .
(2.16)
This is an equation for ℓ:
ℓ= −v1 · w2 + v2 · w1
|v1 × v2|
.
(2.17)
Its usefulness lies in the fact that the second Pl¨ucker vector wi = ri × vi
can be calculated with the vector ri of an arbitrary point on the line i . The
most important consequence of the equation is
Theorem 2.1. Two lines intersect if and only if their Pl¨ucker vectors v1 , w1
and v2 , w2 satisfy the condition
v1 · w2 + v2 · w1 = 0 ,
(2.18)
and the point of intersection is
r = w1 × w2
w1 · v2
.
(2.19)
The last equation is veriﬁed by substituting w1 = r×v1 and w2 = r×v2 .
Example: Given four pairwise skew lines gi = (vi, wi) (i = 1, 2, 3, 4), de-
termine all lines (x, y) which intersect these four given lines (the so-called

68
2 Line Geometry
transversals of the four lines).
Proposition: The number of lines solving this problem is either two or one or
zero. The following proof is due to Steiner [10] v.1:147–154. Let P(z) with a
coordinate z along g1 be an arbitrary point of g1 . The manifold of all lines
passing through P(z) and intersecting g2 deﬁnes a plane E(z) . Let Q(z) be
the point of intersection of g3 with E(z) . It can be shown that the manifold
of all lines g(z) = P(z)Q(z) for −∞< z < ∞deﬁnes a hyperboloid of
one sheet, here denoted H . Thus, every point of H is passed by exactly one
generator g(z) which intersects g1 , g2 and g3 . The line g4 intersects H
either at two points or in a double point or not at all. The generator g(z)
passing through such an intersection point intersects the four given lines. End
of proof.
For calculating the unknown lines (x, y) all vectors are decomposed in
some appropriately chosen common reference basis. The four intersection
conditions wi · x + vi · y = 0 (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are formulated in terms of the
vector coordinates. This results in a system of four homogeneous linear equa-
tions for the six unknown coordinates xk , yk (k = 1, 2, 3) . The coeﬃcient
matrix is of size (4 × 6) . Every solution (x, y) satisﬁes the orthogonality
condition x · y = 0 , i.e., x1y1 + x2y2 + x3y3 = 0 , as well as the normal-
izing condition x2
1 + x2
2 + x2
3 = 1 . Since, by Steiner’s proof, these altogether
six equations have isolated solutions, the (4 × 6) coeﬃcient matrix of the
linear equations has rank four. From this it follows that four out of the six
coordinates can be expressed as linear combinations of the remaining two.
Of these two at least one is ̸= 0 because otherwise only the trivial solution
would exist. The linear combinations are substituted into the orthogonality
condition x1y1 + x2y2 + x3y3 = 0 . This results in a single equation for the
two remaining coordinates. The equation is quadratic with respect to both
coordinates. It is solved for one of them. With each of its two solutions the
ﬁrst four coordinates are calculated. Thus, ﬁve coordinates are expressed in
terms of a single coordinate. This single coordinate may be chosen arbitrar-
ily. For example, it may be chosen so as to satisfy the normalizing condition
x2
1 +x2
2 +x2
3 = 1 . With or without normalization every 6-tuple of coordinates
determines uniquely one line (x, y) solving the problem.

coordinates

2.6 Pl¨ucker Vectors of the Common Perpendicular of
two Lines
In this section the lines (v1, w1) and (v2, w2) shown in Fig. 2.3 are con-
sidered again. The length of their common perpendicular is calculated from
(2.17). To be determined are the Pl¨ucker vectors v , w of the common per-
pendicular. Since v has the direction of v1 × v2 the ansatz is made:
v = v1 × v2 ,
w = λ1v1 × w2 + λ2w1 × v2 + μv1 × v2 .
(2.20)
The unknown coeﬃcients λ1 , λ2 , μ are calculated from the three conditions
that the common perpendicular intersects both lines, and that, furthermore,
v·w = 0 . The intersection conditions (2.18) are v·wi +vi ·w = 0 (i = 1, 2).
Substitution of (2.20) yields after elementary manipulations λ1 = λ2 = 1 .
The condition v · w = 0 is an equation for μ :
(v1 × v2) · (v1 × w2 + w1 × v2) + μ(v1 × v2)2 = 0 .
(2.21)
Lagrange’s identity for multiple products in combination with the orthogo-
nality v1 · w1 = v2 · w2 = 0 results in
μ = (v1 · v2)(v1 · w2 + v2 · w1)
(v1 × v2)2
(2.22)
(μ = 0 if the lines (v1, w1) and (v2, w2) intersect). With this and with
λ1 = λ2 = 1 the desired Pl¨ucker vectors (2.20) are
v = v1×v2 ,
w = v1×w2+w1×v2+(v1·w2+w1·v2)(v1·v2)
v1 × v2
(v1 × v2)2 .

2.7 Linear Complex
The four independent coordinates of the Pl¨ucker vectors v and w of every
line in three-dimensional space may be subjected to one, to two, to three or
to four independent scalar constraints. This results in line manifolds having
three or two or one or zero free parameters. A manifold of lines with three free
parameters (a single constraint) is called a complex and, in particular, a linear
complex, if the constraint equation is linear. This is the case investigated in
what follows. A manifold of lines with two free parameters (two constraints) is
called a congruence, and a manifold of lines with a single free parameter (three
constraints) is called a ruled surface. The special case of linear congruences is
brieﬂy treated in Sect. 2.8 . Ruled surfaces are the subject of Sect. 2.9 . Four
independent scalar constraints determine isolated lines. Note the diﬀerence
between line geometry and cartesian point geometry. Three point coordinates
may be subjected to one, to two or to three independent scalar constraints.
The results are surfaces, curves and points, respectively.
Let a and b be two arbitrarily prescribed, nonorthogonal vectors, i.e.,
a · b ̸= 0 . Since they are nonorthogonal, they are not Pl¨ucker vectors of a
line. Deﬁnition: The linear complex (a; b) is the manifold of all lines (v, w)
satisfying the linear constraint equation
a · w + b · v = 0 .
(2.25)
The linear complex (a; b) contains three independent coordinates. The lines
(v, w) are brieﬂy called complex lines. Since (2.25) is unaﬀected by multipli-
cation with an arbitrary constant, the vector a can be made a unit vector.
In what follows, this is not assumed.
Remark: In the special case a · b = 0 excluded from the investigation,
a and b are Pl¨ucker vectors of a line. In this case, (2.25) represents the
intersection condition for the lines (a, b) and (v, w). It is satisﬁed by all
lines (v, w) intersecting the line (a, b) at arbitrary points and in arbitrary
directions. This linear complex is called a special linear complex, and the line
(a, b) is called its axis.
2.7.1 Null Point. Null Plane
Imagine that the vectors a and b start out from the origin 0 in Fig. 2.2 . The
point P is an arbitrarily chosen ﬁxed point whereas P′ is a variable point.

2.7 Linear Complex
71
Equations (2.3) determine the Pl¨ucker vectors of all lines passing through P.
Among these lines only those are complex lines which satisfy (2.25):
a · r × r′ + b · (r′ −r) = 0 .
(2.26)
This equation establishes a linear relation between the three coordinates of
r′. Hence it is the equation of a plane passing through P . All lines lying
in this plane and passing through P are complex lines. Proposition: The
nonnormalized vector
n = a × r + b
(2.27)
is normal to the plane. Proof: Substitution of the expression for n into the
orthogonality condition n · (r′ −r) = 0 produces (2.26). End of proof.
For every point P (2.26) determines uniquely a plane. For reasons ex-
plained later (see Sects. 9.3 and 12.4) the point and the associated plane
are called null point and null plane, respectively. Since b is not orthogonal
to a , the normal vector n is not orthogonal to a either. This means: No
null plane contains a line parallel to a . The vector n does not change if
to r an arbitrary multiple of a is added. This means: Null planes passing
through diﬀerent null points are parallel if these null points are located on a
line parallel to a , and they are not parallel if the null points are not located
on a line parallel to a . Hence the conclusion: Every null plane has exactly
one null point. In every null plane all lines passing through the null point -
and these lines only - are complex lines. They form what is called a pencil of
complex lines.
2.7.2 Axis. Pitch
For clarifying the location of the inﬁnitely many null planes/null points in
space (2.26) is rewritten by substituting r = rA + ϱ and r′ = rA + ϱ ′ where
rA is the position vector of an as yet unspeciﬁed point A (Fig. 2.4). This
results after simple manipulations in the equation
a · ϱ × ϱ ′ + (a × rA + b) · (ϱ ′ −ϱ) = 0 .
(2.28)
For all points A on a line parallel to a the vectors a × rA + b are identical
(diﬀerent vectors for diﬀerent lines). There exists a single line parallel to a for
the points of which a×rA +b has the direction of a , i.e., a×rA +b = p a
with a scalar p of dimension length. This line is called axis of the linear
complex. Let u be the particular vector rA which is perpendicular to the
axis (see Fig. 2.4). Then also a × u + b = p a . Cross- and dot-multiplying
this equation by a and using the orthogonality a · u = 0 one gets for u and
for p the expressions

72
2 Line Geometry
Fig. 2.4 Axis of a linear complex
u = a × b
a2
,
p = a · b
a2
.
(2.29)
The axis has the Pl¨ucker vectors a and u×a = (a×b)×a/a2 = b−p a . In
a reference basis having its origin on the axis of the complex the same linear
complex has the second Pl¨ucker vector u × a = 0 . In this reference basis the
linear complex (a; b) is the complex (a; p a) .
For better understanding the relationships between axis, constant p , null
point and null plane points of a single line perpendicular to the axis are
considered (Fig. 2.5). The foot of this perpendicular is chosen as origin 0 so
that (2.29), (2.27) and (2.26) have the forms
u = 0 ,
b = p a ,
n = a × r + p a ,
(2.30)
a · [r × r′ + p (r′ −r)] = 0 .
(2.31)
Let P with position vector r be an arbitrarily chosen null point on the line.
The associated null plane contains the line because (2.31) is satisﬁed with
every position vector r′ collinear with r . The ﬁgure shows the pencil of
complex lines in this null plane. The null plane is inclined against the axis
of the complex by an angle α for which the triangle at P yields the formula
(with r = |r|)
tan α = p
r .
(2.32)
The angle α is the smaller, the larger the distance r of the null point from
the axis.
On every line perpendicular to the axis the allocation of null planes and
null points is the same. This simple allocation establishes a one-to-one rela-
tionship between a linear complex and a screw. The axis of the complex has
to be interpreted as axis of a screw with pitch p . The helix of the thread at
the distance r (arbitrary) from the axis progresses per revolution by 2πp .
Consequently, the inclination angle of this helix is the angle α in (2.32). This
means: Let P be an arbitrary null point in space. The corresponding null
plane is orthogonally intersected at P by the helix passing through P . In

2.7 Linear Complex
73
Fig. 2.5 The pencil of complex lines in the null plane with null point P is normal to the
helix through P
other words: The linear complex (a; b) is the manifold of all normals of all
helices produced by a screw having as axis the axis of the linear complex,
having the pitch p and arbitrary radius r . The pitch may be positive or
negative, i.e., the screw is right-handed or left-handed.
2.7.3 Determine the Null Point if the Null Plane is
Given and Vice Versa
Let r0 be the position vector of a null point, and let m · r = −1 be Eq.(2.1)
of the associated null plane. Then
m · r0 = −1 .
(2.33)
The vector a × r0 + b was shown to be normal to the plane (see (2.27)).
Consequently
m = A(a × r0 + b)
(2.34)
with an unknown scalar A . Cross-multiplying this equation with m and dot-
multiplying it with r0 and using in either case (2.33) results in the equations
0 = −a −(m · a)r0 + m × b ,
−1 = Ar0 · b .
(2.35)
If the null plane is given, the ﬁrst equation determines the null point:
r0 = m × b −a
m · a
.
(2.36)
If, instead, the null point is given, the second equation determines the null
plane:
m = r0 × a −b
r0 · b
.
(2.37)

2.7.4 Determine a Linear Complex from Given
Complex Lines
The linear complex (a ; b) is deﬁned by Eq.(2.25): a · w + b · v = 0 . Given
vectors a and b determine the axis and the pitch and the Pl¨ucker vectors
v and w of all complex lines (v , w) . The linear complex does not change
if a and b are multiplied by an arbitrary constant. The vectors a and b
are determined by ﬁve lines (vi , wi) (i = 1, . . . , 5) satisfying the condition
that the ﬁve equations
wi · a + vi · b = 0
(i = 1, . . . , 5)
(2.38)
are linearly independent. Applications to problems of kinematics see in Sects.
4.2.1 and 12.5 . In Zindler [13] reference is made to literature on 28 diﬀerent
methods for determining a linear complex from given data.
2.7.5 Reciprocal Polars
In what follows, the origin 0 is again an arbitrary point, and the vector a
need not be a unit vector. Proposition: For every line (p1, q1) not belonging
to the linear complex (a; b) there exist exactly one line (p2, q2) also not
belonging to the linear complex and exactly one scalar μ ̸= 0 such that
p1 + p2 = μa ,
q1 + q2 = μb .
(2.39)
The lines (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) are called reciprocal polars of the linear
complex.
Proof: The Pl¨ucker vectors of the two polars satisfy the equations p1 · q1 =
p2 · q2 = 0 . Since the polar (p1, q1) does not belong to the linear complex,
the Pl¨ucker vectors p1 and q1 do not satisfy (2.25). Hence a·q1+b·p1 ̸= 0 .
With (2.39) the equation p2 · q2 = 0 gets the form
(μa −p1) · (μb −q1) = μ2a · b −μ(a · q1 + b · p1) = 0 .
(2.40)
From this it follows that there exists, indeed, a single scalar
μ = a · q1 + b · p1
a · b
̸= 0 .
(2.41)
With this scalar the other reciprocal polar (p2, q2) is uniquely determined
by (2.39). Its Pl¨ucker vectors yield the identity a·q2 +b·p2 = a·q1 +b·p1 .
This proves that also the other reciprocal polar does not belong to the linear
complex. End of proof.

2.7 Linear Complex
75
The polar (p1, q1) remains unchanged if p1 and with it also q1 is multi-
plied by an arbitrary scalar. The scalar can be chosen such that (2.41) yields
μ = 1 .
Any two reciprocal polars are skew lines. Indeed, the intersection condition
(2.18) is violated:
p1·q2+p2·q1 = p1·(μb−q1)+(μa−p1)·q1 = μ(a·q1+b·p1) ̸= 0 . (2.42)
Theorem 2.2. The common perpendicular of two reciprocal polars (p1, q1)
and (p2, q2) intersects orthogonally the axis of the complex. In other words:
The axis of the complex and the reciprocal polars have a common perpendic-
ular.
Proof: Let N be the common perpendicular of the axis of the complex and
of the polar (p1, q1) . Without loss of generality the origin 0 is placed at
the foot of N on the axis of the complex. Furthermore, p1 is assumed to be
a unit vector. These assumptions have the consequence that b = p a , that
N has the Pl¨ucker vectors (p1 × q1 , 0) , and that a · p1 × q1 = 0 . The
last equation expresses the orthogonality of N to the axis of the complex. It
suﬃces to prove that N intersects the other reciprocal polar (p2, q2) , and
that it is orthogonal to it. These are the conditions
q2 · p1 × q1 = 0 ,
p2 · p1 × q1 = 0 .
(2.43)
With
p2 = μa −p1
and
q2 = μb −q1 = μp a −q1
they are, indeed,
satisﬁed. End of proof.
Proposition: Every complex line (v, w) intersecting one out of two recip-
rocal polars (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersects also the other.
Proof: Suppose the intersection condition (2.18) is satisﬁed for the polar
(p1, q1) , i.e., v · q1 + w · p1 = 0 . The intersection condition for the other
polar (p2, q2) is
v · q2 + w · p2 = v · (μb −q1) + w · (μa −p1)
= μ(a · w + b · v) −(v · q1 + w · p1) = 0 .
(2.44)
It is satisﬁed because (2.25) is valid. End of proof. Conversely, if
v·q1 +w·p1 = 0 and v·q2 +w·p2 = 0 , then also a·w+b·v = 0 , whence
it follows that every line intersecting two reciprocal polars is a complex line.
And furthermore: If two lines, say g and
g′ , have the property that every
line intersecting both of them is a complex line, g and
g′ are reciprocal
polars.
Proposition: The two transversals of any four linearly independent com-
plex lines (vi, wi) (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) of a linear complex (a; b) are reciprocal
polars. Proof: Since every complex line intersecting one of two reciprocal po-
lars intersects also the other, it suﬃces to show that a transversal cannot be a
complex line. This is done as follows. Suppose one of the transversals is a ﬁfth

76
2 Line Geometry
linearly independent complex line (v5, w5) . Then the system of ﬁve equa-
tions wi · v5 + vi · w5 = 0 (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) with a coeﬃcient matrix of rank
ﬁve has the nontrivial solution (v5, w5) satisfying the equation v5 · w5 = 0 .
But this is not the case since linear independence of the ﬁve lines means that
Eqs.(2.38), wi · a + vi · b = 0 (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) , with the same coeﬃcient
matrix have the nontrivial solution (a, b) satisfying the inequality a · b ̸= 0 .
End of proof.
Let P be an arbitrary point located on one of two reciprocal polars. The
manifold of all lines passing through P and intersecting the other polar
represents the pencil of complex lines in the null plane which has P as null
point. Figure 2.6 shows two reciprocal polars together with the pencils of
complex lines in two null planes corresponding to two null points P1 and P2 .
The line connecting these null points is a complex line in both null planes. If
a null point moves along one reciprocal polar, the corresponding null plane
rotates about the other reciprocal polar. This has the following consequence.
If the null planes are known for two null points on one reciprocal polar, the
other reciprocal polar is the line of intersection of these null planes.
Two pairs of reciprocal polars determine a linear complex. According to
Theorem 2.2 its axis is the common perpendicular of the common perpendic-
ulars of the two pairs. According to Fig. 2.6 a single pair determines the null
plane associated with an arbitrary null point on one of the polars. The axis,
this null plane and this null point determine the radius r and the inclination
angle α shown in Fig. 2.5. According to (2.32) the pitch of the linear complex
is p = r tan α .

2.8 Linear Congruence
77
2.8 Linear Congruence
A congruence is the manifold of all lines (v , w) which are subject to two
constraint equations. In this section linear congruences are brieﬂy treated.
This is the special case of the intersection of two linear complexes (see (2.25)):
C1 = a1 · w + b1 · v = 0 ,
C2 = a2 · w + b2 · v = 0 .
(2.45)
The lines (v , w) of the congruence are complex lines common to both C1 and
C2. Through every point in space a line of the congruence is passing, namely,
the line of intersection of the null planes of C1 and C2 associated with this
null point. In every plane a line of the congruence is located, namely, the
line passing through the null points of C1 and C2 associated with this null
plane. If two lines of the congruence intersect, the two null planes of C1 and
C2 associated with this null point coincide with the plane spanned by the
intersecting lines. In this case, every line in this plane and passing through
this point is line of the congruence.
Equations (2.45) are equivalent to the two linear combinations (themselves
linear complexes) C1 + λ1C2 = 0 , C1 + λ2C2 = 0 , i.e.,
(a1 + λ1a2) · w + (b1 + λ1b2) · v = 0 ,
(a1 + λ2a2) · w + (b1 + λ2b2) · v = 0
(2.46)
with arbitrary (real or complex) numbers λ1 and λ2 ̸= λ1 . These numbers
are determined such that both linear complexes are special. For this to be
the case λ1 and λ2 must be the roots of the quadratic equation (see the
remark following (2.25))
(a1 + λa2) · (b1 + λb2) = 0 .
(2.47)
Let it be assumed that the roots are diﬀerent. The special linear complex
with λi (i = 1, 2) consists of all lines intersecting the line with Pl¨ucker vec-
tors (a1 + λia2) and (b1 + λib2) . The two lines thus determined are called
directrices of the congruence. Let it be assumed that they are skew. The
congruence consists of all lines intersecting both directrices. In accordance
with the statements made above the following is true. Through every point
in space a line exists which intersects both directrices. In every plane a line
exists which intersects both directrices. If, in particular, a directrix is pass-
ing through the point or lying in the plane, the number of congruence lines
through this point or in this plane is inﬁnite. Further details see in Salmon
[7] and Salmon/Fiedler [8].

2 Line Geometry
2.9 Ruled Surfaces
Before investigating general ruled surfaces in Sect. 2.9.2 a special case is
considered.
2.9.1 Intersection of three Linear Complexes
The intersection of three linear complexes
C1 = a1 ·w+b1 ·v = 0 ,
C2 = a2 ·w+b2 ·v = 0 ,
C3 = a3 ·w+b3 ·v = 0
(2.48)
is a one-parametric manifold of lines and hence a ruled surface F . Every
generator of F belongs to the ∞2 linear combinations (themselves linear
complexes) C = λ1C1 + λ2C2 + C3 = 0 , i.e.,
C = (λ1a1 + λ2a2 + a3) · w + (λ1b1 + λ2b2 + b3) · v = 0
(2.49)
with arbitrary (real or complex) parameters λ1 and λ2 . Among these there
are ∞1 special complexes, namely, the ones satisfying the constraint equation
for λ1 and λ2
(λ1a1 + λ2a2 + a3) · (λ1b1 + λ2b2 + b3) = 0 .
(2.50)
Each of these special complexes is the manifold of all lines intersecting the
axis with Pl¨ucker vectors (λ1a1 +λ2a2 +a3) and (λ1b1 +λ2b2 +b3) . Thus,
a manifold of inﬁnitely many generators of F intersect the axes of these ∞1
special complexes. From this it follows that these axes themselves represent
a second manifold of generators of F . Thus, the ruled surface F consists
of two manifolds of generators, each generator of one manifold intersecting
every generator of the second manifold. Consequently, the ruled surface is
a quadric, i.e., in general, either a hyperboloid of one sheet or a hyperbolic
paraboloid.
2.9.2 Striction Point. Distribution Parameter
A general ruled surface is a manifold of lines with a single free parameter
u . It is deﬁned through the position vector r(u) of a curve and the unit
vector e(u) along the line passing through the point r(u) . The normalized
Pl¨ucker vectors of the lines are e(u) and r(u) × e(u) . The lines are called
generating lines or simply generators of the ruled surface. With an additional
free parameter λ the surface has the parameter equation

2.9 Ruled Surfaces
79
x(u, λ) = r(u) + λe(u) .
(2.51)
Until further below three special kinds of ruled surfaces are excluded. These
are
(a) general cylinders; all generators are parallel; e(u) = const.
(b) general cones; all generators are passing through a ﬁxed point called apex
of the cone. Without loss of generality, r(u) is measured from the apex so
that r(u) and e(u) are collinear
(c) ruled surfaces where e(u) is deﬁned to be the tangent to the curve r(u) .
In what follows, tangent planes are investigated. Derivatives with respect
to u are denoted by a dot. The tangent plane at the point x(u, λ) is spanned
by the vector ˙x = ˙r + λ˙e tangent to the curve λ = const through this point
and by the vector e of the generator through this point. These two vectors
deﬁne the unit normal vector n of the tangent plane at this point:
n = (˙r + λ˙e) × e
|(˙r + λ˙e) × e | .
(2.52)
In what follows, statements are made about an arbitrary single generator
with u = const. At the points λ →−∞and λ →+∞at inﬁnity the unit
normal vectors of the tangent planes are the mutually opposite vectors
n−∞= e × ˙e
|e × ˙e | ,
n+∞= −e × ˙e
|e × ˙e | .
(2.53)
The unit vector
nS = n−∞× e =
˙e
|˙e |
(2.54)
is orthogonal to both n−∞and n+∞. The particular point on the generator
u = const where nS is normal to the tangent plane is called striction point
S on the generator. From (2.52) it follows that at S [(˙r + λS ˙e) × e] × ˙e = 0 .
Because of the orthogonality e· ˙e = 0 this is the equation (˙r· ˙e+λS ˙e2)e = 0 .
Consequently
λS = −˙r · ˙e
˙e2
.
(2.55)
With this expression (2.51) yields the position vector of the striction point:
xS = r + λSe = r −˙r · ˙e
˙e2
e .
(2.56)
The curve xS(u) with variable u is the locus of all striction points. It is
called striction line of the ruled surface (in this case, line does not mean
straight line).
In what follows, a single generator with u = const is considered again.
At the striction point S the cartesian basis with unit vectors e , nS and

80
2 Line Geometry
n−∞= e × nS is deﬁned. It is referred to as canonical reference frame. Let
ϕ(λ) be the angle through which the tangent plane at the point λ is rotated
against the tangent plane at the striction point. Equation (2.52) for n(λ)
yields cos ϕ = nS · n and sin ϕ = n−∞· n . These are the equations (see
(2.55))
cos ϕ =
˙e · ˙r × e
|˙e | |(˙r + λ˙e) × e | ,
sin ϕ =
−˙e · ˙r −λ˙e2
|˙e | |(˙r + λ˙e) × e | =
(λS −λ)˙e2
|˙e | |(˙r + λ˙e) × e | .

⎬

⎭
(2.57)
This yields
tan ϕ = λS −λ
δ
(2.58)
with
δ = ˙e · ˙r × e
˙e2
.
(2.59)
The quantity δ is constant on the generator u = const. It is called distribu-
tion parameter because it determines the distribution of the tangent planes
along the generator. The rotation angle ϕ is an odd function of the dis-
tance λS −λ from the striction point. When traveling from the inﬁnite point
λ →−∞to the inﬁnite point λ →+∞, the tangent plane rotates through
the angle π . At the striction point one half of this rotation is executed.
The striction point is indeterminate, and the distribution parameter is
zero if ˙r is parallel to e , i.e., if the generator u = const is tangent to the
curve r(u) . This may happen at isolated points or even at all points of a
curve r(u) . Ruled surfaces where it happens at all points were excluded
from consideration.
In what follows, new interpretations are given for the striction point and
for the distribution parameter. Two generators associated with parameter
values u and u + Δu are considered. They are skew lines (see Fig. 2.7). Let
ℓbe the length of the common perpendicular, and let α be the projected
angle. The perpendicular is the axis of the screw displacement carrying one
generator into the other. The quantities ℓand α are the translatory and
the angular component, respectively, of this screw displacement. For a ﬁxed
u (arbitrary) there exist in the limit Δu →0 a screw axis and the pitch
lim
Δu→0(ℓ/α) of the screw. Propositions:
1. The screw axis has the direction of n−∞
2. The screw axis intersects the generator u = const at the striction point
3. The pitch is the distribution parameter δ .
Proof: The generators associated with u and with u + Δu have the Pl¨ucker
vectors
v1 = e(u) ,
w1 = r(u) × e(u) ,
v2 = e(u + Δu) ,
w2 = r(u + Δu) × e(u + Δu) .

The ﬁrst Eq.(2.23) determines the ﬁrst Pl¨ucker vector of the common per-
pendicular: v1 ×v2 = Δu e× ˙e+. . . . In the limit Δu →0 this yields for the
direction of the screw axis the vector e × ˙e . This is the direction of n−∞.
Thus, proposition 1 is proved. Let ϱ be the perpendicular onto the screw
axis. Equation (2.24) yields the expression
ϱ =

With the help of the Lagrangian identity for multiple products the following

The ﬁrst two terms represent the components of r in the directions of e and
of nS , respectively. The third term is the vector (r · n−∞)n−∞along the

This is, indeed, the striction point S of Eq.(2.56). This ends the proof of
proposition 2 .
Next, the pitch
lim
Δu→0(ℓ/α) of the screw is calculated. For a ﬁnite Δu
Eq.(2.17) expresses −ℓsin α in terms of the Pl¨ucker vectors of the two gen-
erators: v1 · w2 + v2 · w1 = −ℓsin α . Division of this equation through the
equation (v1 × v2)2 = sin2 α yields the quotient ℓ/ sin α and in the limit

This is, indeed, the distribution parameter δ of Eq.(2.59). End of proof.
Through (2.58) ruled surfaces become objects of kinematics. Imagine that
one generator of a ruled surface F1 and one generator of another ruled sur-
face F2 have identical distribution parameters δ . When the two generators,
the striction points on these generators and also the tangent planes to F1
and to F2 at the striction points are brought into coincidence, F1 and F2
are in tangential contact everywhere along the common generator. This is a
consequence of (2.58). Now, imagine that not only the two generators of F1
and F2 have identical distribution parameters, but that in every arbitrarily
small neighborhood there are generators with pairwise identical distribution
parameters, so that F1 and F2 can move relative to each other with perma-
nent tangential contact along the actual common generator. This rotational-
translational motion is called raccording motion. It is the subject of Sect.
9.5 .
During the raccording motion the striction lines of F1 and F2 are per-
manently intersecting. The directions of their tangents at the point of inter-
section depend on diﬀerential-geometric quantities of higher order so that,
normally, the lines are not cotangential.
Example: Determine the striction line and the distribution parameter for
the hyperboloid of revolution shown in Fig. 2.8 . Its equation in the x, y, z-
system is given as (x2 + y2)/a2 −z2/b2 = 1 .
Solution: The semi-axis a is the radius of the gorge circle in the x, y-plane.
This circle is chosen as curve having the position vector r(u) . Each point
r(u) is passed by two generators. The generators are orthogonal to r(u) and
inclined against the x, y-plane by the angle ψ with tan ψ = b/a . In the

projection in Fig. 2.8 the four generators through the points x = ±a , y =
z = 0 appear pairwise superimposed. These projected generators are the
asymptotes of the contour hyperbola y2/a2 −z2/b2 = 1 . The hyperboloid is
created by rotating the generators about the z-axis. Let the parameter u be
the angle ϕ of this rotation. Then ˙r = ˙ϕez × r and ˙e = ˙ϕez × e , whence
it follows that ˙r · ˙e = 0 , ˙e2 = ˙ϕ2 cos2 ψ and ˙r · e × ˙e = ± ˙ϕ2a sin ψ cos ψ
(the sign depends upon which of the two generators passing through r is
considered). This together with (2.56) and (2.67) yields xS(ϕ) ≡r(ϕ) and
|δ(ϕ)| ≡a tan ψ = b . Hence the striction line is the gorge circle, and the
distribution parameter (identical for all generators) is the imaginary semi-axis
b of the hyperboloid. Two hyperboloids of revolution with identical imaginary
semi-axes can be in raccording motion. The kinematical signiﬁcance of this
motion is explained in Sect. 12.2 . End of example.
Torses
At the beginning of this section three special kinds of ruled surfaces were
excluded, namely,
(a) general cylinders; all generators are parallel; ˙e(u) ≡0
(b) general cones; r(u) is measured from the apex; r(u) and e(u) are
collinear for all u
(c) ruled surfaces where e(u) and ˙r(u) are collinear for all u .
An example for a type (c) ruled surface is the involute helicoid used as tooth
ﬂank in involute helical gears (see Sec. 16.1.8). For cylinders the distribution
parameter is formally δ = ∞. For cones and for type (c) ruled surfaces it
is δ = 0 . All three types of ruled surfaces have in common that the tangent
plane is the same for all points of a generator. All three of them have the
property of being developable into a plane. The technical term is torse.

Finite Screw Displacement
Subject of this chapter are relationships between two positions of a rigid
body without a ﬁxed point. These two positions, referred to as initial and
ﬁnal position, respectively, are assumed to be arbitrary subject only to the
restriction that the ﬁnal position cannot be produced from the initial position
by pure translation. Motions leading from the initial to the ﬁnal position are
not investigated.
3.1 (4 × 4) Transformation Matrix
In Fig. 3.1 the most general displacement of a rigid body is shown. The body is
represented by a body-ﬁxed basis e2 . In the initial position e2 coincides with
a reference basis e1 with origin 01 . The displacement to the ﬁnal position of
e2 with origin 02 is the result of a rotation (n, ϕ) about 01 followed by the
translatory displacement r = −−→
0102 . The position of e2 after the rotation and
prior to translation is referred to as intermediate position (shown in dotted
lines). In the ﬁnal position a body-ﬁxed point Q with position vector ϱ2 in
e2 has in e1 the position vector

The (4 × 4) matrices are transformation matrices. Inversion is carried out

Example: In Fig. 3.2 a serial robot with six revolute joints is shown. Starting
at the base the bodies and joints are labeled from 1 to 7 and from 1 to
6 , respectively. The locations of the joint axes on the bodies are speciﬁed
by body-ﬁxed vectors r2, . . . , r6 pointing from one axis to the next and by
body-ﬁxed unit vectors n1, . . . , n6 along joint axes. The variable angle of
rotation in joint i is called ϕi . It is the angle of body i + 1 relative to body
i . The vector r7 locates a speciﬁed point P on the hand of the robot. An
arbitrarily chosen position of the robot is declared as null position. In this
position the angles are ϕ1 = ϕ2 = . . . = ϕ6 = 0 . On body 1 a reference
basis e1 is ﬁxed with its origin 0 on the joint axis 1 . On each of the bodies
i = 2, . . . , 7 a basis ei is ﬁxed in such a way that in the null position all
bases are oriented parallel to basis e1 . The given data are
- the column matrices ri
i of the coordinates of ri in ei
(i = 2, . . . , 7)
- the coordinates of ni in ei (identical with the coordinates in ei+1)
(i =
1, . . . , 6)
- the angles ϕi
(i = 1, . . . , 6).
The position of the robot hand in the reference basis e1 is determined by
the matrix A17 in the equation e1 = A17e7 and by the column matrix r1
P
of the coordinates of the position vector rP in e1 . To be determined are A17
and r1
P as functions of ϕ1, . . . , ϕ6 .
Solution: With the coordinates ni1 , ni2 , ni3 of ni in ei and with ϕi
Eq.(1.49) determines the matrix Ai−1,i in the relationship ei−1 = Ai−1,iei .
The desired matrix A17 is the product A12A23A34A45A56A67 . The position
vector of P is rP = r2 + r3 + · · · + r7 . The desired column matrix of its
coordinates in e1 is the expression (to be read from right to left)

3.2 Chasles’ Theorem
In Fig. 3.3
the same general displacement of a rigid body is shown which
was the subject of Fig. 3.1. The body is displaced from an initial position
1 to a ﬁnal position 2 . Let e2 be a body-ﬁxed basis which in position 1
coincides with a reference basis e1 with origin 01 (arbitrary). In position 2
the origin of e2 is at 02 . The vector pointing from 01 to 02 is called r .
Dashed lines indicate an intermediate position 2′ arrived at from position 1
by pure translation r , and dotted lines indicate another intermediate position
1′ arrived at from position 2 by pure translation −r . The displacement from
position 1 to position 1′ is a rotation (n , ϕ ) about 01 , and the displacement
from position 2′ to position 2 is the same rotation (n , ϕ ) about 02 . Hence
the conclusion: The displacement of the body from position 1 to position
2 can be interpreted in two ways, either as resultant of the rotation (n , ϕ )
about 01 followed by the translation r or as resultant of the same translation
r followed by the same rotation (n , ϕ ) about 02 .
For another origin 0′
1 of the basis e1 the rotation (n , ϕ ) is the same
because both e1 and e2 are oriented as before, but the translatory displace-
ment r′ from 0′
1 to 0′
2 is diﬀerent. If ϱ is the vector pointing from 01 to

1 and ϱ∗the vector pointing from 02 to 0′
2 , the relationship between r′
and r is r′ = r + ϱ∗−ϱ .
Proposition: For arbitrary n and ϕ ̸= 0 there exists a uniquely deter-
mined body-ﬁxed line having the direction of n all points of which have
identical displacements sn ( s = const) in the direction along this line. More
precisely, this is the statement made by
Theorem 3.1. (Chasles [8])1 Any not purely translatory displacement of a
rigid body from an initial to a ﬁnal position can be represented in a unique way
as screw displacement. This screw displacement is the resultant of a rotation
(n , ϕ ) about a body-ﬁxed screw axis S and a translation sn along this axis.
The screw displacement is the same regardless whether the rotation or the
translation is carried out ﬁrst.
Proof: Starting from (n , ϕ ) and from the displacement r the screw axis
and the displacement sn are determined as follows. Let ϱ be the body-ﬁxed
vector pointing from 01 to another body-ﬁxed point P (arbitrary). After
the rotation (n , ϕ ) about 01 P has the position vector (see (1.37))
ϱ∗= ϱ + (1 −cos ϕ) n × (n × ϱ) + sin ϕ n × ϱ .
(3.7)
After the subsequent translation r the point has the position vector r+ϱ∗,
so that the total displacement of P is
r + ϱ∗−ϱ . Points on the body-
ﬁxed screw axis, if it exists, have, prior to displacement, position vectors
ϱ = u+λn ( λ arbitrary) with u·n = 0 . Thus, u is the perpendicular from
01 onto the screw axis. For proving the theorem it has to be shown that with
these vectors ϱ the equation r + ϱ∗−ϱ ≡sn holds true independent of λ ,
and that, furthermore, the equation determines s and u uniquely. The ﬁrst
condition is satisﬁed, because λ is eliminated by the product n × ϱ . The
equation reads
r −(1 −cos ϕ) u + sin ϕ n × u = sn .
(3.8)
Scalar multiplication by n determines
1 This theorem was known already to Mozzi (1765; see Giorgini [16])

3.2 Chasles’ Theorem
89
s = n · r ,
(3.9)
and cross-multiplication by n produces the equation
n × r −(1 −cos ϕ) n × u −sin ϕ u = 0 .
(3.10)
This equation and (3.8) with sn = nn·r are two linear equations for u and
for the second Pl¨ucker vector u × n of the screw axis:
sin ϕ u −(1 −cos ϕ) u × n = n × r ,
(1 −cos ϕ) u
+ sin ϕ u × n = r −nn · r = (n × r) × n .

(3.11)
With the formula sin ϕ/(1 −cos ϕ) = cot ϕ/2 the solutions are
u = 1

,
(3.12)
u × n = 1


(n × r) × n cot ϕ
2 −n × r

.
(3.13)
This concludes the proof. The geometrical interpretation of the formula for
u is given in Fig. 3.3. The vector r is decomposed into its components v
orthogonal to n and sn along n , so that
s = n · r in accordance with
(3.9). Hence r = v + sn . The screw axis is called S . It is passing through
the apex P0 of the isosceles triangle in the plane normal to n having v as
base and ϕ as apex angle. The vector u is pointing from 01 to P0 . The
ﬁrst term in the expression for u represents the vector v/2 , and the second
is the altitude of the triangle above the base. Until further below (see Sect.
3.9) the screw displacement is denoted (S, n, ϕ, s).
In the general formula for the displacement r+ϱ∗−ϱ of arbitrary points
of the body the last two terms satisfy (1.44) and (1.77):
(ϱ∗−ϱ) · n = 0 ,
ϱ∗−ϱ = n tan ϕ
2 × (ϱ∗+ ϱ) .
(3.14)
With the ﬁrst equation it is veriﬁed that the component of the displacement
along the screw axis is
nn · r = sn for all points of the body. With the
second equation it is veriﬁed that the same screw axis is obtained if instead
of 01 another point 0′
1 is used as starting point. Let this point 0′
1 be the
point at the tip of a vector ϱ (arbitrary) from 01 . Furthermore, let u′ be
the perpendicular from 0′
1 onto the screw axis. It is given by (3.12) if r is
replaced by r + ϱ∗−ϱ . It has to be veriﬁed that the second Pl¨ucker vector
(u′ + ϱ) × n of the screw axis is identical with u × n . Because of (3.14) this
is, indeed, the case:

Example: Given n , ϕ , s and the position vector rA of a point A on the
screw axis, determine the relationship between the position vectors r and
r∗of an arbitrary body-ﬁxed point before and after the screw displacement.
Solution: From Fig. 1.3 it follows that the rotation is governed by (1.38) if r∗
and r are replaced by r∗−rA and r −rA , respectively. Hence the solution:
r∗= rA+cos ϕ (r−rA)+(1−cos ϕ)nn·(r−rA)+sin ϕ n×(r−rA)+s n . (3.16)
In the special case ϕ = π , s = 0 , the point is reﬂected in the screw axis:
r∗= 2rA −r + 2n n · (r −rA) .
(3.17)
This formula is known from (2.11). End of example.
3.3 Scalar Measures of a Screw Displacement
For a screw displacement with inﬁnitesimal quantities ϕ and s the quotient
p = s/ϕ is called pitch as is done for a machine screw. In the theory of ﬁnite
screw displacements the quotient s/ϕ does not occur. As scalar measure of
a ﬁnite screw displacement Dimentberg [12] deﬁnes the quantity
pD =
s
sin ϕ .
(3.18)
Parkin [34] deﬁnes the quantity2
pP =
s
2
tan ϕ
2
.
(3.19)
These two measures are related through the equation
pP = pD cos2 ϕ
2 .
(3.20)
2 This measure was already used by Sch¨onﬂies [32] p.1014

3.4 Roth’ Theorem
91
In the special case of an inﬁnitesimal screw displacement both measures are
identical with the pitch p = s/ϕ . Both measures ﬁnd applications (see Huang
[20] and Eqs.(3.207), (6.3), (6.23), (6.88)).
3.4 Roth’ Theorem
Starting point of this section is the trivial statement: If a body is rotated
about a ﬁxed point P , every point of the body has the property that its
distance from P is the same before and after the rotation. Roth [43] proved
Theorem 3.2. Given a point P and two positions of a body not resulting
from each other by a rotation about P , there exists a body-ﬁxed plane every
point of which has the property that its distance from P is the same in both
positions.
In what follows, not only a proof of the theorem is given. The body-ﬁxed plane
is determined as well. Let ri and r′
i be the vectors from P to an arbitrary
body-ﬁxed point in the initial and in the ﬁnal position, respectively. The
condition that the distances from P be the same in both positions reads
r′
i
2 = r2
i .
(3.21)
It suﬃces to prove that this condition is satisﬁed by three noncollinear body-
ﬁxed points. Then it is satisﬁed by every body-ﬁxed point in the plane
spanned by these points. Four noncoplanar body-ﬁxed points satisfying (3.21)
cannot exist since otherwise the displacement of the body would be a rotation
about P contrary to the assumption.
In the general case, the displacement of the body is a screw displacement.
Deﬁne (n, ϕ) to be the rotation, R ≥0 the distance of P from the screw
axis, e a unit vector through P normal to the screw axis (in the case R > 0 ,
the vector Re is the perpendicular from P onto the screw axis). Finally, let
s be the translation along the screw axis (see Fig. 3.4). The special cases of
pure translation ( s ̸= 0 , ϕ = 0 ) and of pure rotation ( s = 0 , ϕ ̸= 0 ) are
not excluded. Three distinguished points of the unknown body-ﬁxed plane

are its intersections with the line Pe , with the screw axis and with the line
perpendicular to both screw axis and line Pe . The vectors ri (i = 1, 2, 3)
from P to these points in the initial position have, with unknown quantities
λ , μ and ν of dimension length, the forms
r1 = Re + λn ,
r2 = (R + μ)e ,
r3 = Re + νn × e .
(3.22)
In the ﬁnal position after the screw displacement the position vectors are
found by simple inspection from Fig. 3.4 :
r′
1 = Re + (s + λ)n ,
r′
2 = sn + (R + μ cos ϕ)e + μ sin ϕ n × e ,
r′
3 = sn + (R −ν sin ϕ)e + ν cos ϕ n × e .

Substitution into (3.21) yields for the unknowns the expressions
λ = −s
2 ,
μ =
s2
2R(1 −cos ϕ) ,
ν =

2R sin ϕ .
(3.24)
Except for a single case these formulas deﬁne three points and, hence, a
plane. The single case is a pure rotation about an axis not passing through
P . It is characterized by s = 0 and R, ϕ ̸= 0 . The corresponding solutions
λ = μ = ν = 0 deﬁne only the point 0 . However, even in this case, a
body-ﬁxed plane with the required property exists. Without calculation it is
obvious that the plane contains the rotation axis. In the initial position it is
rotated against the line P0 through −ϕ/2 and in the ﬁnal position through
+ϕ/2 . In Fig. 3.5a the points P and 0 and the two positions of the plane
are shown in the projection along the rotation axis n . Thus, it is proved
that Roth’ Theorem is valid without any exception. In what follows, three
more special cases are considered in which the body-ﬁxed plane is predictable
without the above analysis.
1. The special case R = 0 , ϕ, s ̸= 0 (screw displacement with a screw
axis passing through P ): Without calculation it is obvious that the plane
is normal to the screw axis. The perpendicular from P onto the plane is
−(s/2)n in the initial position and +(s/2)n in the ﬁnal position of the
body (Fig. 3.5b). The plane is deﬁned by Eqs.(3.24) which, in this case, yield
λ = −s/2 and μ, ν →∞. A point A in this plane is displaced to A′ .
2. The special case ϕ = 0 , s ̸= 0 , R unspeciﬁed (pure translation sn):
Without calculation it is obvious that Fig. 3.5b applies also to this case. As
before, Eqs.(3.24) yield λ = −s/2 and μ, ν →∞.
3. The special case ϕ = π , R , s ̸= 0 (screw displacement with 180◦-
turn): Equations (3.24) yield
λ = −s/2 ,
μ = s2/(4R) and
ν →∞.
These results indicate that the line n × e is parallel to the plane. In Fig.
3.5c the two positions of the plane are shown in the projection along n × e .
The points with position vectors r1 , r′
1 and r2 , r′

are marked A , A′ and B , B′ , respectively. In this case, the solution is less

obvious than in the previous cases, but it is still predictable without analysis.
In all other cases λ , μ and ν are ﬁnite and diﬀerent from zero.
3.5 Screw Displacement Determined from
Displacements of Three Body Points
Problem: For three noncollinear body-ﬁxed points P1 , P2 , P3 the posi-
tion vectors zi before and z′
i after a displacement, respectively, are given
(i = 1, 2, 3) . The three displacements z′
i −zi (i = 1, 2, 3) are not identical.
Therefore, the displacement of the body is not a translation, but a screw
displacement. To be determined are the rotation (n, ϕ) , a vector from 0 to
some point on the screw axis and the translation s along the screw axis.
Solution: The rotation (n, ϕ) does not change if the displacement is superim-
posed by an arbitrary translation. Arbitrarily, the translation −(z′
3 −z3) is
superimposed. Then the resulting displacement is the rotation (n, ϕ) about
the ﬁxed point P3 . The position vectors from P3 to the body-ﬁxed points P1
and P2 before and after the rotation are given by
ri = zi −z3
and
r∗
i = z′
i −z′
3
(i = 1, 2) ,
(3.25)
respectively. These vectors determine the rotation (n, ϕ) . Its Rodrigues vec-
tor n tan ϕ/2 is calculated from (1.210) – (1.217) in Sect. 1.15.7 . The ro-
tation is superimposed again by the translation r = z′
3 −z3 . From the now
known quantities n , ϕ and r the translation s along the screw axis and the
perpendicular u from P3 onto the screw axis are calculated from (3.9) and
(3.12), respectively. The desired vector from 0 to the screw axis is z3 + u .
Note: In (1.210) – (1.217) u is the Rodrigues vector.

3.6 Halphen’s Theorem
In 1882 Halphen [17] published
Theorem 3.3. A screw displacement (S, n, ϕ, s) can be represented as resul-
tant of two successive reﬂections in lines g1 (ﬁrst reﬂection) and g2 . The
lines g1 and g2 intersect the screw axis S orthogonally. Line g2 results
from g1 by the screw displacement (S, n, ϕ/2 , s/2). One of the two lines
may be chosen arbitrarily.
Proof: Figure 3.6 shows in two projections the screw axis S together with two
lines g1 and g2 having the required properties. Let Q1 be an arbitrary point
of the body in the initial position prior to the ﬁrst reﬂection. Its location
relative to g1 is speciﬁed by the quantities d and α explained in the ﬁgure.
After the ﬁrst reﬂection the body-ﬁxed point is located at Q′ and after the
second reﬂection in g2 it is located at Q2 . The eﬀect of the ﬁrst reﬂection
is a rotation of the body-ﬁxed perpendicular from Q1 onto S through the
angle 2α about S and a displacement of Q1 by 2d in the direction n . The
second reﬂection in g2 increases the rotation angle by 2(ϕ/2 −α) and the
displacement along S by 2(s/2 −d) . Hence the total rotation angle is ϕ ,
and the total displacement along S is s . This proves the theorem.
In the special case s = 0 , Halphen’s theorem reduces to the statement
known from Sects. 1.15.2 and 1.16 that a rotation (n, ϕ) can be represented
as resultant of two reﬂections in lines which intersect n orthogonally and
which enclose the angle ϕ/2 . A reﬂection in a line and a 180◦-rotation about
this line result in one and the same displacement.

3.7 Resultant of two Screw Displacements. Screw
Triangle
Consider now the displacement of a body which is the result of two suc-
cessive screw displacements (S1, n1, ϕ1, s1) (ﬁrst screw displacement) and
(S2, n2, ϕ2, s2) . According to Chasles’ theorem the resultant displacement is
itself a screw displacement called the resultant screw displacement (Sres, nres,
ϕres, sres) . This resultant is geometrically constructed by applying Halphen’s
theorem several times. First, the general case is considered in which the screw
axes S1 and S2 are skew. Let g1 be the common perpendicular of S1 and
S2 (see Fig. 3.7). Each of the two screw displacements 1 and 2 is repre-
sented as resultant of two reﬂections. For the line of the second reﬂection of
screw displacement 1 and also for the line of the ﬁrst reﬂection of screw dis-
placement 2 the common perpendicular g1 is chosen. These two reﬂections
cancel each other. Hence the resultant screw displacement is the resultant of
the ﬁrst reﬂection of screw displacement 1 and of the second reﬂection of
screw displacement 2 . The lines of these two reﬂections are called g3 and
g2 . According to Halphen’s theorem, they are obtained by subjecting g1 to
the screw displacements (S1, n1, −ϕ1/2 , −s1/2 ) and (S2, n2, ϕ2/2 , s2/2 ) ,
respectively. Again, according to Halphen’s theorem, the resultant screw axis
Sres is the common perpendicular of g2 and g3 . Furthermore, sresnres/2 is
the vector along this common perpendicular shown in the ﬁgure, and ϕres/2
is the projected angle between g2 and g3 .
Up to now the screw axes S1 and S2 were assumed to be skew. Suppose
now that they intersect at a point P . In this case, the common perpendicular
g1 is uniquely deﬁned as normal through P of the plane spanned by S1 and
S2 . The length of the common perpendicular is zero.
The inverse of the resultant is the screw displacement (Sres, nres,−ϕres,
−sres) . It carries the body back to its initial position. The lines S1 , g1 , S2 ,

96
3 Finite Screw Displacement
g2 , S3 , g3 form a spatial hexagon with right angles at every corner. Three
arbitrary pairwise skew lines S1 , S2 , S3 have uniquely deﬁned common
perpendiculars g1 , g2 , g3 . Hence the three lines determine uniquely a system
of three screw displacements about these lines S1 , S2 , S3 which carry a
body from an initial position via two intermediate positions back into its
initial position3. In an arbitrarily chosen reference frame the three lines are
deﬁned by their Pl¨ucker vectors. From this it follows that the position and the
shape of the hexagon are determined by twelve independent parameters. For
reasons explained later the hexagon is called spatial triangle or screw triangle
(Yang [51], Roth [44]). In Sects. 3.11 and 3.12 analytical relationships are
developed for the screw triangle.
When in the given screw displacements 1 and 2 s1 and s2 are changed
(all other parameters held ﬁxed), then the lines g2 and g3 undergo lateral
displacements. This has no eﬀect on ϕres whereas all other parameters of
the resultant screw displacement are eﬀected. In Fig. 3.8 the special case
s1 = s2 = 0 is shown, i.e., the resultant of two pure rotations about skew
axes ( S1 , n1 , ϕ1 , S2 , n2 , ϕ2 and g1 are the same as in Fig. 3.7). The
points A1 and A2 coalesce in a single point A , and B1 and B2 coalesce in a
single point B .
Remark: In 1848 Cayley [7],v.1 gave analytical solutions for the resultant
of two successive screw displacements as well as for the inverse problem of
decomposing a given screw displacement into two screw displacements with
prescribed characteristics. He did not consider the special case of screw dis-
placements with 180◦rotation angles which was the subject of Halphen’s
paper [17] almost half a century later. Among the problems solved by Cayley
are the determination of the resultant of two successive pure rotations about
skew axes and the decomposition of a given screw displacement into two pure
Fig. 3.8 Resultant of two rotations about skew axes
3 The lines S1 , S2 , S3 and their perpendiculars g1 , g2 , g3 can change roles. Thus, the
same hexagon determines three screw displacements about g1 , g2 , g3 which carry the
body from its initial position via two intermediate positions back into the initial position

3.8 Dual Numbers

rotations with prescribed characteristics. The decomposition is the subject
of Cayley’s
Theorem 3.4. A given screw displacement can be represented as resultant
of two subsequent pure rotations. The axis of one rotation may be prescribed
arbitrarily (but not parallel to the axis of the resultant screw displacement).
Then the axis of the other rotation as well as the two rotation angles are
determined.
The geometrical solution is explained in Fig. 3.8 . Let it be assumed that the
resultant screw displacement and the axis S2 are prescribed as shown. The
axes S2 and Sres determine the common perpendicular g2 and its endpoints
B and C2 . Point C1 is determined by sres , and g3 is determined by ϕres .
Point A is the point of intersection of g3 with the plane through B and
perpendicular to S2 . The axis S1 of the ﬁrst rotation is the common perpen-
dicular of g3 and g1 = AB . Finally, ϕ1/2 and ϕ2/2 are the angles between
g1 and g3 and between g1 and g2 , respectively. An analytical solution of the
problem is given in Sect. 3.11 .
3.8 Dual Numbers
Let x and y be real numbers. The number x + εy is complex if ε2 = −1 .
Cliﬀord [10] was the ﬁrst to consider the case ε2 = 0 . In this case, x + εy
is called a dual number with x being its primary part and y its dual part.
It must be understood that ε2 = 0 does not mean that also ε = 0 . The
quantity ε is, just as i = √−1 , a unit, namely, the unit of the dual part.
The sum and the product of two dual numbers x1 + εy1 and x2 + εy2 are
deﬁned by the formulas
(x1 + εy1) + (x2 + εy2) = x1 + x2 + ε(y1 + y2) ,
(x1 + εy1)(x2 + εy2) = x1x2 + ε(x1y2 + y1x2) .
 
(3.26)
According to these deﬁnitions, for addition as well as for multiplication the
laws of commutativity, associativity and distributivity are valid. As with real
numbers expressions are multiplied out term by term always keeping in mind
the rule ε2 = 0 . Together with ε2 = 0 also all higher-order terms of ε are
zero: ε3 = ε · ε2 = 0 etc. The diﬀerence of two dual numbers is deﬁned
uniquely via the sum. The zero dual number is the number (0 + ε · 0) since
only this number has the property that addition to x + εy with arbitrary
x, y results in x + εy .
Equation (3.26) shows that the product of two dual numbers is zero not
only if at least one factor is the number (0 + ε · 0) , but also in the case
x1 = x2 = 0 with arbitrary y1 , y2 . From this it follows that division by
(x+εy) is not deﬁned if x = 0 . Indeed, multiplying both the numerator and

98

the denominator of 1/(x + εy) by x −εy results in the expression
1
x + εy = x −εy
x2
= 1
x + ε −y

(3.27)
which is deﬁned only in the case x ̸= 0 .
Dual numbers x + εy and (2 × 2)-matrices of the form

(3.28)
Let f(x + εy) be a once diﬀerentiable function depending on the dual
variable x + εy and possibly on additional parameters. The Taylor series
expansion about the point x consists, because of ε2 = 0 , of two terms only:
f(x + εy) = f(x) + εy ∂f
∂x
!!!
y=0 .
(3.29)
Hence the function f(x + εy) is a dual number. Its primary part is the func-
tion of the primary part of its argument. Its dual part is the derivative of the
primary part with respect to the primary part x of its argument multiplied
by the dual part y of x + εy . This dual part is referred to as dual deriva-
tive, and the process of calculating it is referred to as dual diﬀerentiation.
Examples:
cos(x + εy) = cos x −εy sin x ,
sin(x + εy) = sin x + εy cos x ,
(3.30)
tan(x + εy) = tan x + ε

cot(x + εy) = cot x −ε

(3.31)
The product of two functions f(x1 + εy1) g(x2 + εy2) is decomposed into
primary and dual part as follows:
f(x1 + εy1) g(x2 + εy2) =

f(x1) + εy1

(3.32)
Example:
sin(x1+εy1) cos(x2+εy2) = sin x1 cos x2+ε(y1 cos x1 cos x2−y2 sin x1 sin x2) .
(3.33)
Thus, the primary part is the product of the functions of the primary parts
of their variables. The rule for calculating the dual part is the product rule
of dual diﬀerentiation. The dual part is linear with respect to the dual parts
y1 , y2 of the arguments of the factors f and g , respectively. With these

3.9 Dual Vectors. Dual Angles
99
few rules all mathematical expressions encountered in later chapters can be
decomposed into their primary and dual parts.
A MAPLE software tool developed by Sinigersky [45] has subroutines for
the symbolic manipulation of dual numbers, dual vectors and dual quater-
nions and also for the dual diﬀerentiation of arbitrarily complex mathematical
expressions.
3.9 Dual Vectors. Dual Angles
Figure 3.9 shows a line vector ˆv of given magnitude. This is a vector which
is conﬁned to its line. In contrast to a free vector v a line vector can slide
along its line, but it cannot move lateral to it. A force is an example of a
line vector. Its line is called line of action. Let v be the free vector having
direction, sense of direction and magnitude in common with ˆv . The line
vector ˆv is uniquely determined if v is given and, in addition, the vector r
from a reference point 0 to an arbitrary point of the line of ˆv . The vectors r
and v together deﬁne the moment of ˆv with respect to 0 . It is abbreviated
w :
w = r × v
(equal for all points of the line of ˆv ) .
(3.34)
The vectors v and w = r×v represent the ﬁrst and the second Pl¨ucker vec-
tors of the line (see Sect. 2.2). They determine the line. With a free parameter
λ it is given by the vector equation
r∗(λ) = λv + v × w
v2
.
(3.35)
The Pl¨ucker vectors satisfy the conditions
v2 = const ,
v · w = 0 .
(3.36)
Deﬁnition: The line vector ˆv is the dual vector
Fig. 3.9 Line vector ˆv
Fig. 3.10 Screw angle ˆϕ = ϕ + εs

100
3 Finite Screw Displacement
ˆv = v + εw .
(3.37)
Because of (3.36) the scalar product of ˆv with itself is
ˆv2 = (v + εw)2 = v2 + 2εv · w = v2 .
(3.38)
In the case v2 = 1 , ˆv is a unit dual vector (unit line vector).
In Fig. 3.10 two unit line vectors ˆv1 and ˆv2 are shown the lines of which
are skew. By assumption, v2
1 = v2
2 = 1 . As vectors r1 and r2 the vectors
to the feet of the common perpendicular of the lines are chosen. Then, by
Eq.(3.37),
ˆv1 = v1 +εw1 = v1 +εr1 ×v1 ,
ˆv2 = v2 +εw2 = v2 +εr2 ×v2 . (3.39)
These expressions are valid also when the lines are parallel. In this case, r1
and r2 are the position vectors of an arbitrary common perpendicular.
Let n be the unit vector in the direction of r2 −r1 :
n = r2 −r1
|r2 −r1| = v1 × v2
|v1 × v2| .
(3.40)
In the case of parallel lines only the ﬁrst expression is useful and in the case
of intersecting (not identical) lines only the second expression. Furthermore,
the line vector is deﬁned
ˆn = n + εr1 × n .
(3.41)
It has the direction of n , and its line is the common perpendicular.
The line vector ˆv2 can be produced from ˆv1 by a screw displacement
about the screw axis ˆn . The rotation angle ϕ and the translation s of this
screw displacement (both positive, zero or negative) are determined by the
equations
v1 × v2 = n sin ϕ ,
r2 −r1 = n s .
(3.42)
The absolute values |s| and |ϕ| are the distance and the projected angle,
respectively, between the two lines. The special cases of parallel or intersecting
lines are characterized by ϕ = 0 or s = 0 , respectively.
Between the various quantities just deﬁned the following relationships exist:
v1 · v2 = cos ϕ ,
(r2 −r1) · (v1 × v2) = s sin ϕ .
(3.43)
Deﬁnition: The dual angle
ˆϕ = ϕ + εs
(3.44)
is called the screw angle of the screw displacement carrying ˆv1 into ˆv2 . The
screw displacement itself is denoted (ˆn, ˆϕ) . This replaces the earlier notation
(S,n, ϕ, s) . The pair S, n is replaced by ˆn , and the pair ϕ, s is replaced by
ˆϕ . The functions cos ˆϕ and sin ˆϕ are given in (3.30).

3.9 Dual Vectors. Dual Angles
101
The deﬁnitions given for dual vectors and for dual screw angles are very
useful. This is shown by calculating the dot product and the cross product
of the dual unit vectors ˆv1 and ˆv2 of Fig. 3.10 . With (3.39) and (3.43) the
dot product is
ˆv1 · ˆv2 = v1 · v2 + ε(v1 · w2 + v2 · w1)
(3.45)
= v1 · v2 + ε(v1 · r2 × v2 + r1 × v1 · v2)
= v1 · v2 + ε(−r2 · v1 × v2 + r1 · v1 × v2)
= v1 · v2 −ε(r2 −r1) · (v1 × v2) .
(3.46)
= cos ϕ −εs sin ϕ
(3.47)
and with (3.30)
ˆv1 · ˆv2 = cos ˆϕ .
(3.48)
Thus, the rule for calculating the dot product of two ordinary unit vectors is
transferred to dual unit vectors.
Comparison of (3.45) and (3.47) yields s sin ϕ = −(v1 · w2 + v2 · w1) and
the condition for two lines to intersect:
v1 · w2 + v2 · w1 = 0 .
(3.49)
These equations repeat what is known from (2.17) and (2.18). Another im-
portant relationship is deduced from (3.46):
(r1 −r2) · (v1 × v2)
is the dual derivative of
v1 · v2 .
(3.50)
The usefulness of this equation is demonstrated in Sects. 5.3.1, 6.3 and 6.4.4.
Next, the cross product of the dual unit vectors ˆv1 and ˆv2 is calculated.
With (3.39) it is
ˆv1 × ˆv2 = (v1 + εr1 × v1) × (v2 + εr2 × v2)
= v1 × v2 + ε[v1 × (r2 × v2) + (r1 × v1) × v2]
= v1 × v2 + ε[v1 · v2r2 −v1 · r2v2 + r1 · v2v1 −v1 · v2r1]
= v1 × v2 + ε[v1 · v2(r2 −r1) + r1 × (v1 × v2)]
(note v1 · r2 = v1 · r1)
= n sin ϕ + ε(cos ϕ ns + r1 × n sin ϕ)
(because of (3.43) and (3.42))
= (n + εr1 × n)(sin ϕ + εs cos ϕ) .
(3.51)
The correctness of the last expression is veriﬁed by multiplying out again.
With (3.37) and (3.30) the ﬁnal result is
ˆv1 × ˆv2 = ˆn sin ˆϕ .
(3.52)
Thus, also the rule for calculating the cross product of two ordinary unit
vectors is transferred to dual unit vectors.

3.10 Principle of Transference
In Chap. 1 relationships were established between positions of a body be-
fore and after a rotation (n, ϕ) about a ﬁxed point. Equations (3.48) and
(3.52) represent the basis of the principle of transference ﬁrst formulated by
Kotelnikov [26] in 1886 and by Study [47] in 1903. It says: Given an equation
relating positions of a body before and after a rotation (n, ϕ) about a ﬁxed
point. Replace the unit vector n along the axis by the dual unit vector ˆn
and the rotation angle ϕ by the dual angle ˆϕ . The equation thus obtained
relates positions of a body before and after the screw displacement (ˆn, ˆϕ) .
In Sects. 3.10.1 – 3.10.5 the notions of cartesian basis, direction cosine ma-
trix, Euler angle, rotation tensor and quaternion of a rotation are dualized,
i.e., transferred into respective dual quantities. Dualized equations relating
such quantities must subsequently be split into their primary and dual parts.
For this procedure it suﬃces to apply basic rules of (vector) algebra in com-
bination with the rule of dual diﬀerentiation (see (3.29) – (3.33), in particular
formulas (3.30) and (3.31) for trigonometric functions). These rules and for-
mulas reveal the following facts.
1. The primary parts of dual equations contain neither second Pl¨ucker
vectors w of screw axes nor translatory displacements s along screw axes.
Thus, primary parts of equations describe a (usually nonlinear) problem of
rotation about a ﬁxed point.
2. The quantities w and s of screw displacements appear in the dual
parts only and, moreover, in linear form only. The solution of these equations
is an elementary problem. Note: First Pl¨ucker vectors n of screw axes and
rotation angles appear in the dual parts as well. However, these quantities
are known from solving the primary parts.
Due to these facts the principle of transference is a powerful tool for solving
problems of very diverse nature. This is demonstrated in subsequent chapters
of this book (Sects. 3.11 , 3.12 , 3.14 and Chaps. 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 and 13).

3.10.1 Dual Basis. Dual Direction Cosine Matrix
Using Fig. 3.11 the notion of a (right-handed, orthogonal) dual basis is intro-
duced. Point 0 is the origin of ordinary bases e1 and e2 . These bases are
related through the direction cosine matrix (see (1.6)):

Vectors r1 and r2 locate the origins 01 and 02 , respectively, of two dual
bases. These dual bases are formed by the dual unit vectors ˆe1

Let ˆe1 and ˆe2 denote the two dual bases as well as the column matrices of
their dual basis vectors. The two sets of equations are written in the matrix
forms
ˆe1 = e1 + εr1 × e1 ,
ˆe2 = e2 + εr2 × e2 .

Every dual basis vector of ˆe1 is a linear combination of the dual basis vectors

Let
ˆA
12 be the matrix of the dual direction cosines. Dualization of (3.53)
yields
ˆe1 = ˆA
12ˆe2 ,
ˆA
12 = ˆe1 · ˆe2T .
(3.59)
Into the second equation the expressions (3.55) are substituted:
ˆA
12 = (e1 + ε r1 × e1) · (e2 + ε r2 × e2)T
= e1 · e2T −ε(r2 −r1) · e1 × e2T
= A12 −ε (r2 −r1) · e1 × e1T A12 .
(3.60)
Deﬁne r = r2 −r1 = −−→
0102 and let r1 , r2 , r3 be the coordinates of r in e1 .
Then
ˆA
12 = (I + ε ˜r)A12 ,
˜r =
⎡
⎣
0
−r3
r2
r3
0
−r1
−r2
r1
0
⎤
⎦.
(3.61)
From this it follows that the product ˆA
12 ˆA
12T
is the unit matrix. Hence its
inverse is also its transpose:
( ˆA
12)
−1
= ˆA
12T
.
(3.62)
The determinant of ˆA
12 equals 1 (the determinant of its dual part is zero).
Let ˆv1 and ˆv2 be the dual coordinate matrices of a dual vector of the form
(3.37), ˆv = v + εw , in the dual bases ˆe1 and ˆe2 , respectively. The vector
need not be a unit vector. The ﬁrst Eq.(3.59) is proof of the transformation
rule
ˆv1 = ˆA
12ˆv2 .
(3.63)
This is the dualized form of the transformation rule v1 = A12v2 for ordinary
vector coordinates.
3.10.2 Screw Axis, Screw Angle and Translation
Determined from Dual Direction Cosines
From Chap. 1 on rotations about a ﬁxed point Euler’s Theorem 1.1 is known.
It makes the following statements. The transformation matrix A12 has the
eigenvalue one. In the case A12 ̸= I , the matrix A12 determines uniquely
a rotation (n, ϕ) carrying a body-ﬁxed basis from the position e1 into the
position e2 = A12T e1 . The coordinate matrix n of n , identical in both
bases, is the solution of the equation
(A12 −I)n = 0 .
(3.64)

3.10 Principle of Transference
105
If A12 is unsymmetric, ϕ and n are determined by (1.51) and (1.52):
cos ϕ = 1
2(tr A12−1) ,
2ni sin ϕ = a12
kj−a12
jk (i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 cyclic) . (3.65)
If A12 is symmetric, then ϕ = ±π .
Transference of this theorem into dual form produces Chasles’ Theorem
3.1 and the following statements. The dual transformation matrix
ˆA
12 =
(I +ε ˜r)A12 has the eigenvalue one. A formal proof is given further below. In
the case A12 ̸= I , the matrix ˆA
12 determines uniquely a screw displacement
(ˆn, ˆϕ) carrying a body-ﬁxed dual basis from the position ˆe1 into the position
ˆe2 = ˆA
12T
ˆe1 . As before, the dual angle ˆϕ and the dual unit line vector ˆn
along the screw axis are written in the forms
ˆϕ = ϕ + εs ,
ˆn = n + εw
(n2 = 1 , n · w = 0) .
(3.66)
In what follows, it is shown how to determine the unknown scalars ϕ and s
and the unknown Pl¨ucker vectors n and w if the matrix ˆA
12 is given. The
unknowns are determined from the equation ( ˆA
12 −I)ˆn = 0 or in detail
[(I + ε ˜r)A12 −I](n + εw) = 0 .
(3.67)
If A12 is unsymmetric, Eqs.(3.65) in dualized form are valid. Only the ﬁrst
equation is needed:
cos ˆϕ = 1
2
#
tr [(I + ε ˜r)A12] −1
$
.
(3.68)
Equations (3.67) and (3.68) are split into their primary and dual parts. The
primary parts are the original Eqs.(3.64) and (3.65) for n and ϕ . With the
solutions for n and ϕ the dual parts of the equations determine w and s .
The dual part of (3.67) is the equation (A12 −I)w + ˜r A12n = 0
or, since
A12n = n ,
(A12 −I)w = −˜r n .
(3.69)
Since the matrix A12 −I has rank two, the equation has a solution w only if
the complete coeﬃcient matrix including the right-hand side terms has rank
two. This is, indeed, the case. Proof: The equation has the form B w = −˜r n .
The homogeneous equation B w = 0 has the solution w = μn (μ arbitrary).
Because of the orthogonality of A12 also the equation BT w = 0 has this
solution. From this it follows that the rows of BT , i.e., the columns of B
are in the plane orthogonal to n . In this plane also the column matrix −˜r n
is located since it is the coordinate matrix of the vector n × r . End of proof.
Hence the inhomogeneous equation has a solution wp . The complete solution
is w = μn+wp . From the conditions n2 = 1 and n·w = 0 valid for Pl¨ucker

106
3 Finite Screw Displacement
vectors it follows that μ = −nT wp . Thus, the ﬁnal solution for w is
w = (I −nnT )wp .
(3.70)
The perpendicular from 01 onto the screw axis is the vector u = n × w =
n × wp . It has the coordinate matrix
u = ˜n wp .
(3.71)
These results cover also the special case when the right-hand side of (3.69)
equals zero which means n × r = 0 . Then wp = 0 and w = 0 . This means
that the screw axis is the line connecting the origins 01 and 02 . This is obvious
without any analysis.
The dual part of (3.68) determines s . This equation reads (omitting the
upper indices in the elements of A12) :
−s sin ϕ = 1
2tr (˜r A12)
= 1
2

(a23 −a32)r1 + (a31 −a13)r2 + (a12 −a21)r3

.
(3.72)
The three diﬀerences of matrix elements are expressed with the help of the
second Eq.(3.65). This yields for s the explicit expression
s = n1r1 + n2r2 + n3r3 = nT r1 .
(3.73)
This is identical with (3.9). For the perpendicular u of a screw displacement
with given quantities n , ϕ and r vector methods led to (3.12). Comparison
with (3.71), u = n × wp , allows an interpretation of wp .
In what follows, it is proved that the dual matrix ˆA
12 has the eigenvalue
one. The characteristic equation is
det [(I + ε ˜r)A12 −λI ] = 0 . The term
free of λ consists of 24 expressions which cancel each other pairwise. The
remaining terms are (the upper indices in the elements of A12 are omitted)

(i, j, k = 1, 2, 3
cyclic). From (1.10) it follows that this equation is solved
with λ = 1 . End of proof.
The expression (3.61) for the dual transformation matrix was obtained by
applying the transference principle to the matrix A12 of a rotation expressed
in terms of direction cosines. In Chap. 1 the matrix A12 has been expressed
in various ways by the unit vector n along the axis of a rotation and by
the angle ϕ . The most useful expressions are those in (1.49) in terms of
n1 , n2 , n3 , sin ϕ , cos ϕ , in (1.79) in terms of Euler-Rodrigues parameters

3.10.3 Dual Euler Angles. Dual Bryan Angles
In Fig. 3.12 the dual basis ˆe2 is produced from ˆe1 by a screw displacement

The same result is obtained from (3.61) with r1 = u1 , r2 = r3 = 0 . The dual

In what follows, the same idea is applied to the direction cosine matrix
A12 expressed as function of Euler angles ψ , θ and φ (see (1.28)). Euler
angles are deﬁned in Fig. 1.1a . They are angles of subsequent rotations about
the axes e1
3 , e2′′

and e2′

a screw displacement about the respective axis. The three dual screw angles
are denoted ˆψ = ψ + εuψ , ˆθ = θ + εuθ and ˆφ = φ + εuφ , respectively. They
are dual Euler angles. The dual direction cosine matrix ˆA
12 is obtained from
the direction cosine matrix A12 by the rule of dual diﬀerentiation:

The primary part is the matrix A12 of Eq.(1.28). Dual diﬀerentiation of
the element (1,3), i.e., of the product sψsθ , yields the expression uψcψsθ +
uθ sψcθ . These two terms are the elements (1,3) of the matrices associated
with uψ and uθ .
The same procedure is applied to the direction cosine matrix expressed as
function of Bryan angles φ1 , φ2 and φ3 (see Fig. 1.2a and Eq.(1.32)). Each
of the three subsequent rotations about the axes e1
1 , e2′′

replaced by a screw displacement about the respective axis. The dual screw

They satisfy the constraint equation

Dual-Quaternion Formulation
Halphen’s geometrical construction of the resultant of two screw displace-
ments resulted in the spatial hexagon shown in Fig. 3.7 . Extracting ana-
lytical expressions for the unknowns ϕres , sres and Sres from this ﬁgure is
diﬃcult. Explicit solutions are most easily obtained on the basis of Theorem

two successive rotations (n1, ϕ1) (ﬁrst rotation) and (n2, ϕ2) resulted in the
explicit coordinate-free Eqs.(1.118) and (1.119). Decomposition of vectors in

Theorem 3.5 states that the same equations are valid when vectors n of
rotation axes are replaced by dual vectors ˆn = n + εw of screw axes and
rotation angles ϕ by dual screw angles ˆϕ = ϕ + εs . The angle α between
intersecting rotation axes is replaced by the dual angle ˆα = α + εℓof the
screw displacement which carries ˆn1 into ˆn2 (this means that ℓ, positive or
negative, is the length of the common perpendicular of the two screw axes).
For making (3.107) with ˆn1,2 and ˆα valid the origin 0 of the basis e1,2,3 of
Fig. 1.4 must be the midpoint of the common perpendicular (see Fig. 3.13).

From (3.108) ϕres is determined (sign arbitrary), from (3.109) nres , from
(3.110) sres and from (3.111) wres . A sign change of ϕres results in a change
of signs of all other quantities. For the screw displacement this has no eﬀect.
The quantities s1 , s2 and sres appear in linear form only.
For specifying the location of the resultant screw axis the perpendicular
u = nres×wres from point 0 onto the screw axis is needed. The cross-product
of the vectors in (3.109) and (3.111) is 2u sin2 ϕres/2 where sin2 ϕres/2 is
determined by (3.108). The result of this multiplication is4

In accordance with Fig. 3.7 this equation shows that, in general, the resultant
screw axis does not intersect the common perpendicular e3 of the screw axes
1 and 2 . The resultant screw displacement has scalar measures pD and pP
deﬁned by (3.18) and (3.19). They are written in the forms

These equations govern the even more special case of the resultant of two
180◦-rotations about skew axes. With ϕ1 = −π (equivalent to ϕ1 = π ) and
with ϕ2 = π they yield ϕres = 2α , sres = 2ℓ, nres = e3 , u = 0 . Hence
the resultant is the screw displacement about the common perpendicular of
the two rotation axes with rotation angle 2α and translation 2ℓ. This is the
statement made by Halphen’s theorem.
Example:
In Theorem 3.4 the problem is posed: Decompose a screw dis-
placement given by sres , ϕres and by its axis Sres into two subsequent pure
rotations ϕ1
about S1 (ﬁrst rotation) and ϕ2
about S2 of which either
only S2 or only S1 is given. To be determined are ϕ1 , ϕ2
and the axis
not given.
Solution: Let S2 be given. The unknown ﬁrst rotation is the resultant of
the given screw displacement followed by the inverse of the second rotation.
From this it follows that (3.108) – (3.112) are valid if the following changes
are made.
1. The basis e1,2,3 is placed at the midpoint of the common perpendicular
g2 of the given axes Sres and S2 . The quantities ℓand α specify the relative
location of these axes.
2. ( sres , ϕres ) , ( s1 , ϕ1 ) and ( s2 , ϕ2 ) are replaced by ( 0 , ϕ1 ) , ( sres ,
ϕres ) and ( 0 , −ϕ2 ) , respectively. Following these changes (3.108), (3.109),

(3.124)
With this angle ϕ2 (3.120) and (3.121) determine cos ϕ1/2 and n1 sin ϕ1/2 .
The vector u determined by (3.123) is the perpendicular from the midpoint
of g2 in Fig. 3.8 onto the ﬁrst rotation axis. The equations fail in the case
sin α = 0 (axes S2 and Sres parallel).
When instead of S2 the axis S1 is given, ϕ1 , ϕ2 and S2 are determined
as follows. The unknown second rotation is the resultant of the inverse of the
ﬁrst rotation followed by the given screw displacement. In (3.108) – (3.112)
the following changes are made.
1. The basis e1,2,3 is placed at the midpoint of the common perpendicular
g3 of the given axes Sres and S1 . The quantities ℓand α specify the relative
location of these axes.
2. ( sres , ϕres ) , ( s1 , ϕ1 ) and ( s2 , ϕ2 ) are replaced by ( 0 , ϕ2 ) , ( 0 , −ϕ1 )
and ( sres , ϕres ) , respectively. The modiﬁed Eq.(3.110) leads to

Special case α = 0 (parallel screw axes; n1 = n2 ) : The case

has to be distinguished from the general case ϕ2 ̸= −ϕ1 . This general case
is considered ﬁrst. Equations (3.108) – (3.112) reduce to

This equation proves that the parallel screw axes n1 , n2 and nres , seen
in projection along the axes, form the triangle (P1,P2,P3) shown in Fig.
3.14a . It has internal angles ϕ1/2 and ϕ2/2 at P1 and P2 , respectively,
and the external angle ϕres/2 at P3 . The vector
(ℓ/2)e3 + u
is −−−→
P1P3 ,
and (e2 sin ϕ1
2 + e3 cos ϕ1
2 ) is the unit vector in the direction of −−−→
P1P3 . The
equation expresses the sine law in the triangle.
In the special case
ϕ2 = −ϕ1 , (3.108) yields ϕres = 0 . This indicates
that the resultant of the two screw displacements is a translation. No further
information is obtained from (3.109) – (3.112). Both magnitude and direction
of the translation are obtained from Fig. 3.7. In the case of parallel screw axes
n1 = n2 and with ϕ2 = −ϕ1 , the lines g2 and g3 are parallel. In Fig. 3.14b
the screw axes and the lines are shown in projection along the axes as in Fig.
3.14a . The component (s1+s2)e1 of the displacement is normal to the plane.
The in-plane component is illustrated by the displacement of the point which
prior to the ﬁrst screw displacement is located at A . It is displaced via B
to C . The total translatory displacement vector is
sres = (s1+s2)e1+−→
AC = (s1+s2)e1+ℓ[−sin ϕ1 e2+(1−cos ϕ1)e3] . (3.129)
Equations (3.126) – (3.129) remain valid in the case s1 = s2 = 0 . In this
case, the equations determine the resultant of two rotations about parallel
axes. In Sects. 14.3 and 14.4 this case is investigated in more detail.

3.12 Equations for the Screw Triangle
The quaternion formulation of the resultant of two rotations led to the ro-
tation triangle shown in Fig. 1.6 . Three rotations (n12, ϕ12) , (n23, ϕ23) ,

3.12 Equations for the Screw Triangle

(n31, ϕ31) executed in this order or in any order produced by cyclic per-
mutation carry a body via two intermediate positions back into its initial
position. Each rotation is the inverse of the resultant of the previous two.
Application of the sine and cosine laws led to (1.134):
tan ϕ31
2
=
n12 × n23 · n31
(n12 × n31) · (n23 × n31) .
(3.130)
Analogously, two successive screw displacements followed by the inverse of
the resultant of these two carry a body via two intermediate positions back
into its initial position. The ﬁgure analogous to the rotation triangle is the
spatial hexagon shown in Fig. 3.7 with ϕres and sres replaced by −ϕres ,
−sres . This analogy explains the name screw triangle of the hexagon.
Let the three screw displacements be newly labeled 12 , 23 and 31 . Then,
according to the principle of transference, (3.130) is valid in the form
tan ˆϕ31
2
=
ˆn12 × ˆn23 · ˆn31
(ˆn12 × ˆn31) · (ˆn23 × ˆn31)

(ij) = (12), (23), (31) . The vectors nij and wij are the Pl¨ucker vectors
of the screw axis ij in a reference frame with arbitrary origin 0 . The per-
pendicular from 0 onto the screw axis is nij × wij . From the dual part of
the equation an expression for the translatory displacement s31 is developed.

The numerator is

(3.134)
This is proved as follows. With the abbreviations a = n12 × n31 and b =
n23 × n31 and with β = ∢(a, b) the equation reads
a2b2 cos2 β + (n12 · b)2 = a2b2 or
(n12 · b)2 = a2b2 sin2 β = (a × b)2 = [(n12 × n31) × b]2
= [(n12 · b)n31 −(n31 · b)n12]2 .

3.12 Equations for the Screw Triangle

These vectors are simpliﬁed as follows. First, the vector v12 . Obviously,
v12 · n31 = 0 . When the multiple products are simpliﬁed, it turns out that
also v12 · n12 = 0 . Hence v12 has the form v12 = An12 × n31 with an
unknown scalar A . It is determined by dot-multiplying this equation by
(n12 × n31) . Taking into account (3.134) this results in the equation
A(n12 × n31)2 = [(n12 × n31) · (n23 × n31)]2 + (n12 × n23 · n31)2
= (n12 × n31)2(n23 × n31)2 .
(3.143)
Hence
v12 = (n23 × n31)2 n12 × n31 .
(3.144)
The same arguments lead to
v23 = (n12 × n31)2 n23 × n31 .
(3.145)
The product v31·w31 in (3.141) eliminates the (nonzero) component of v31
in the direction of n31 . For determining the relevant components the ansatz
is made: v31 = An12 × n31 + Bn23 × n31 + Cn31 . Scalar multiplication
with (n23 × n31) × n31 eliminates B and C , and scalar multiplication with
(n12 × n31) × n31 eliminates A and C . The ﬁrst multiplication yields
A(n12 × n23 · n31) =
#
[(n12 · n23) −(n12 · n31)(n23 · n31)]n12 × n23
−(n12 × n23 · n31)[2(n12 · n23)n31 −(n12 · n31)n23

$
· [(n23 · n31)n31 −n23]
= −(n12 × n23 · n31)(n12 · n31)[1 −(n23 · n31)2]
= −(n12 × n23 · n31)(n12 · n31)(n23 × n31)2 .
(3.146)
Hence A = −(n12 · n31)(n23 × n31)2 . In the same way
B = (n23 · n31)(n12 × n31)2 . Hence
v31 = −(n12 · n31)(n23 × n31)2 n12 × n31
+(n23 · n31)(n12 × n31)2 n23 × n31 + Cn31 .
(3.147)
The expressions obtained for v12 , v23 and v31 are substituted into (3.141).
Further substitution into (3.140) yields for s31 the ﬁnal result

In this section Eqs.(3.109) – (3.112) for the resultant of two screw displace-
ments are evaluated in the special case of inﬁnitesimal screw displacements.
Let p1 , p2 and pres be the pitches of the three screw displacements so that

For Eq.(3.109) a Taylor series expansion up to 1st-order terms is made.
When (3.107) is taken into account, this results in the parallelogram rule for
small rotations (see Fig. 3.15):
nϕ = e1(ϕ1 + ϕ2) cos α

(3.151)
= n1ϕ1 + n2ϕ2 .
(3.152)
In (3.110) and (3.112) si = piϕi (i = 1, 2) and s = pϕ are substituted.
Following this, Taylor series expansions are made up to 2nd-order terms.
This results in the equations

From the latter equation it follows that u has the form u = ue3 . This means
that the resultant screw axis intersects the common perpendicular e3 of the

Equations (3.161) – (3.163) determine a one-parametric manifold of resul-
tant screw displacements with the angle χ between screw axis and x-axis as
parameter. In what follows, statements are made about this manifold. Elim-
ination of χ from Eqs.(3.161) results in the equation of a circle relating p
and z :
(p −p0)2 + z2 ≡h2 .
(3.164)
Every value of z in the interval |z| ≤|h| occurs at two angles χ1 and
χ2 = π/2 −χ1 which are located symmetrically with respect to χ = π/4 as
well as to χ = −π/4 . These two angles specify the directions of two screw
axes which intersect at z on the e3-axis. The two screw axes intersecting at
z = +h coincide (χ1 = χ2 = π/4) . Likewise, the two screw axes intersecting
at z = −h coincide (χ1 = χ2 = −π/4) . The pitch associated with these
screw axes is p0 .
The two screw axes intersecting at z = 0 are the principal x, y-axes
(χ1 = 0, χ2 = π/2) . The associated principal pitches are the extremal pitches
px = p0 −h ,
py = p0 + h .
(3.165)
In terms of principal pitches the constants p0 and h are
p0 = 1
2(px + py) ,
h = 1
2(py −px) ,
(3.166)
and Eqs.(3.161) have the forms
p = px cos2 χ + py sin2 χ ,
z = −(px −py) sin χ cos χ .

(3.167)
The ﬁrst equation has the two forms p −px = (py −px) sin2 χ and p −py =
−(py −px) cos2 χ . Together with the second Eq.(3.167) this yields
(px −p) cos χ
+z sin χ = 0 ,
z cos χ −(py −p) sin χ = 0 .

(3.168)
This is an eigenvalue problem with eigenvalue p(z) and with the associ-
ated eigenvector [ cos χ(z)
sin χ(z) ] . The characteristic equation for p is
Eq.(3.164).
Every pitch p in the interval between the extremal pitches px and py
occurs at two angles ±χ . Deﬁnition: Two screws of equal pitch are called
conjugate screws. The pair of conjugate screws at angles ±0 coincides in
the principal screw with pitch px . Likewise, the pair of conjugate screws at
angles ±π coincides in the principal screw with pitch py . For a given pitch

Real solutions exist only if pxpy ≤0 .
The one-parametric manifold of screw axes deﬁnes a ruled surface. With an
additional parameter λ this ruled surface has the parameter representation
u(χ) + λn(χ) . Its coordinate form is
x = λ cos χ ,
y = λ sin χ ,
z = (py −px) sin χ cos χ .
(3.170)
The parameters λ and χ are eliminated by forming x2 + y2 = λ2 and
xy = λ2 sin χ cos χ . Combining these equations with the third Eq.(3.170)
results in the third-order equation
z(x2 + y2) = (py −px)xy .
(3.171)
This ruled surface is called cylindroid. In the theory of ruled surfaces a line
which is intersected by every generator is called directrix. The z-axis is a
double directrix because it is intersected by two generators at every point
|z| ≤| 1
2(py −px)| . From (2.59) the distribution parameter δ is calculated as
function of χ . For this purpose the following change of notation has to be
made (see (2.51)). The role of the parameter u is played by χ . The curve
r(u) is the directrix
u(χ) = (py −px) sin χ cos χe3 , and the unit vector
e(u) is n(χ) . According to (3.170)
˙n = e3 × n and
˙n2 ≡1 . Hence with
˙u(χ) = (py −px) cos 2χe3 the distribution parameter is δ(χ) = ˙n · ˙u × n =
(py −px) cos 2χ . The two pairs of coinciding generators at z = −1
2(py −px)
and at z = 1
2(py −px) are torsal lines (δ = 0 ) . In Fig. 3.16 the cylindroid
is represented in the x, y, z-system by an orthogonal net of lines χ = const
and λ = const. The curved lines λ = const are kinematically insigniﬁcant.
Their only purpose is to show the shape of the surface more clearly. What
matters are the straight lines χ = const, i.e., the screw axes. These axes
extend to ±∞. The symmetry with respect to the two planes each spanned
by the directrix and by one torsal line is clearly shown.
Let n and w be the ﬁrst and the second Pl¨ucker vector of the screw axis
associated with the angle χ . The x, y, z-coordinates of these vectors are
n : [ cos χ sin χ
0 ] ,
w : (py −px) sin χ cos χ [ −sin χ cos χ

The results obtained so far are summarized as follows. The resultant of
two arbitrarily oriented inﬁnitesimal screw displacements with constant pa-

rameters α , ℓ, p1 and p2 and with variable parameters ϕ1 and ϕ2 is the
manifold of screw displacements on the cylindroid deﬁned by its axis, by u0
and by its principal pitches px and py associated with mutually orthogo-
nal principal axes x and y . The same manifold of screw displacements is
obtained if the two principal screws are used as starting point. This is the
special case α = π/2 and ℓ= 0 . Equations (3.163) yield u0 = 0 (this is
in accordance with the statement preceding (3.165)) and p0 = px + py ,
h = py −px
(as before; see Eqs.(3.165)). Every screw on the cylindroid is
resultant of two principal screws about the principal axes. Also the following
is true. Every screw on the cylindroid is resultant of two (arbitrary) conju-
gate screws. The quantities u0 and h determining the cylindroid depend on
the diﬀerence p1 −p2 only, whereas p0 and, hence, p(χ) depend on the sum
p1 + p2 . If p1 and p2 (arbitrary) are increased by one and the same amount
(arbitrary), the cylindroid remains the same, whereas p(χ) is increased by
the same amount independent of χ .
The cylindroid was discovered independently by Hamilton [18] (1830),
Pl¨ucker [38] (1865) (see also [39]), Battaglini [3] (1869) and Ball [2] (1900).
Geometrical properties of the cylindroid see in Zindler [57]. In the present
book the cylindroid is met again in the next Sect. 3.14 and in Sect. 12.6.2 .
The end of the previous Sect. 3.11 on the resultant of two ﬁnite screw
displacements was devoted to cases which require special considerations
(Eqs.(3.118) – (3.129)). The same cases are considered here, and results are
developed from the said equations. As before, the index res is omitted.
Special case ϕ2 = 0 : Since the pitch p2 is not deﬁned the inﬁnitesimal
displacement s2 is expressed in the form s2 = μϕ1 . As origin 0 of the
e1,2,3-system an arbitrary point on the screw axis ˆn1 is chosen (see the text
following (3.115)). Substituting s2 = μϕ1 and s1 = p1ϕ1 into (3.115) and
(3.116) and making a Taylor series expansion for u results in the equations

ϕ = ϕ1 ,
n = n1 ,
p = p1 + μ cos α ,
u = e3μ sin α .
(3.173)
These equations show that the resultant screw axis has the direction of n1 ,
and that it intersects the e3-axis orthogonally at the point u = μ sin α .
Special case α = 0 (parallel screw axes) and ϕ2 ̸= −ϕ1 : Equations (3.126)

This means that the resultant screw axis intersects the e3-axis orthogonally
at a point u which depends on the ratio ϕ2/ϕ1 . The points P1 , P2 and P3
in Fig. 3.14a are collinear.
Special case α = 0 (parallel screw axes) and ϕ2 = −ϕ1 : According to
(3.129) the resultant displacement is a pure translation s . With s1 = p1ϕ1
and s2 = p2ϕ2 = −p2ϕ1 it is
s = [(p1 −p2)e1 −ℓe2]ϕ1 .
(3.175)
This displacement is normal to e3 .
3.14 Screw Displacements Eﬀecting a Prescribed Line
Displacement
In Fig. 3.17 two skew lines are deﬁned by their unit line vectors ˆr1 and ˆr2 .
The line vector ˆr2 is produced from ˆr1 by the screw displacement (ˆn3, ˆα)
with the dual unit vector ˆn3 along the common perpendicular and with the
dual screw angle ˆα = α+εℓbetween the two lines. Without loss of generality,
it is assumed that 0 < α < π whereas ℓmay be positive, zero or negative.
The dual unit vector ˆn3 is one of the basis vectors ˆni (i = 1, 2, 3) of a dual
basis which has its origin at the midpoint 0 of the common perpendicular.
The basis vector ˆn1 is bisecting the angle α when seen in the projection
along ˆn3 . The line vector ˆr2 is produced from ˆr1 not only by the screw
displacement (ˆn3, ˆα) , but also by the screw displacement (ˆn1, ±π) . Both
screw displacements carry the point A ﬁxed on line 1 to the point B ﬁxed
on line 2 . These observations stimulate an investigation of the following
problems.
Problem 1 : Determine the manifold of all screw displacements (ˆn, ˆϕ) of a
rigid body which carry a body-ﬁxed directed line from position ˆr1 into po-
sition ˆr2 . In this manifold determine the submanifold of all screw displace-

ments which are pure rotations. The problem statement does not require that
point A of ˆr1 is carried to a speciﬁed point on ˆr2 .
Problem 2 : From the manifold of all screw displacements solving Problem 1
determine the submanifold of all screw displacements carrying point A of ˆr1
to an arbitrarily prescribed point P on ˆr2 . Consider the special case P=B .
Both problems have a practical background. Let the body-ﬁxed line be
the axis of a cylindrical workpiece which is displaced by a robot from a box
into the chuck of a machine. In the box the axis has position ˆr1 , and in
the chuck it has position ˆr2 . The robot is equipped with a single cylindrical
joint so that it can execute screw displacements only. The angular position
of the cylindrical workpiece in the chuck is of no interest. If the depth of
insertion into the chuck is not prescribed either, every screw displacement
solving Problem 1 is acceptable, otherwise every screw displacement solving
Problem 2 .
Solution to Problem 1 : The solution is deduced by means of the principle
of transference from the solution to the following rotation problem solved in
Sect. 1.15.9 . Determine all rotations (n, ϕ) about a ﬁxed point 0 which carry
a body-ﬁxed line passing through 0 from a given position r1 into another
given position r2 . The lines r1 and r2 and the angle α between them are
shown in Fig. 1.11a . Figure 1.11b explains cartesian basis vectors n1 , n2 ,

The notation in Fig. 3.17 is chosen such that in the case ℓ= 0 the dual angle
ˆα is the angle α of Fig. 1.11, and that the dual vectors ˆri (i = 1, 2) and ˆni
(i = 1, 2, 3) are the vectors ri (i = 1, 2) and ni (i = 1, 2, 3), respectively. The
solution to the rotation problem of Fig. 1.11 is a one-parametric manifold of
rotations (n, ϕ) . With a free parameter ψ it is given in (1.222) and (1.228)
in the form
n = n1 cos ψ −n3 sin ψ ,
cot ϕ
2 = −cot α

(3.178)
All vectors and angles are transferred into dual form by deﬁning dual parts
as follows:
ˆα = α + εℓ,
ˆϕ = ϕ + εs ,
ˆψ = ψ + εu ,
(3.179)
ˆni = ni
(i = 1, 2, 3) ,
ˆri = ri + εwi
(i = 1, 2) ,
ˆn = n + εw . (3.180)
The identity ˆni = ni holds true because the second Pl¨ucker vectors are zero
with respect to the origin 0 of the dual basis. The second Pl¨ucker vectors

(3.181)
The same formulas are obtained by dual diﬀerentiation of (3.177). The quan-
tities ψ and u are two independent parameters of the manifold of solutions.
To be determined as functions of ψ and u are the dual parts s and w of
the screw displacement. Unknown, too, is the geometrical meaning of u . The
unknowns are determined as follows. Equations (3.178) are transferred into
the dual forms
ˆn = n1 cos ˆψ −n3 sin ˆψ ,
cot ˆϕ
2 = −cot ˆα
2 sin ˆψ .
(3.182)
The dual part of the ﬁrst equation yields
w = −u(n1 sin ψ + n3 cos ψ) .
(3.183)
This together with the ﬁrst Eq.(3.178) yields for the perpendicular n × w
from 0 onto the screw axis the expression
n × w = un2 .
(3.184)
From this it follows, ﬁrst, that all screw axes intersect the line ˆn2 at right
angles and, second, that the free parameter u (positive, zero or negative)
represents the length of the perpendicular from 0 onto the screw axis. This
is shown in Fig. 3.17 . The line ˆn2 is called nodal line of the two lines ˆr1 and
ˆr2 .

With the ﬁrst Eq.(3.186) s becomes a function of u and ψ :
s = u sin α cos ψ −ℓsin ψ

(3.188)
With Eqs.(3.178) for n and ϕ and with the equations for w , n × w and
s the two-parametric manifold of screw displacements (ˆn, ˆϕ) solving Prob-
lem 1 is uniquely determined. The special screw displacements (ˆn3, ˆα) and
(ˆn1, ±π) shown in Fig. 3.17 belong to this manifold. The associated param-
eter values are ψ = −π/2 , u = 0 for the ﬁrst and ψ = 0 , u = 0 for the
second.
Pure rotations satisfy the condition s = 0 , i.e.,
u = ℓtan ψ
sin α
.
(3.189)
This condition deﬁnes the one-parametric submanifold of rotations in the
two-parametric manifold of screw displacements. The special rotation with
parameter values ψ = 0 , u = 0 belongs to this submanifold. The manifold
of all rotation axes deﬁnes a ruled surface. Let x , u , z be the coordinates
of points of this ruled surface along n1 , n2 and n3 , respectively. From the
primary part of (3.182) and from (3.189) it follows that z/x = −tan ψ =
−(u/ℓ) sin α
or
ux = −zℓ/ sin α . This is the equation of an equilateral
hyperbolic paraboloid. In a ξ, η-system rotated through 45◦about the n2-
axis the transformation is x = (ξ + η)
√
2/2 and u = (−ξ + η)
√
2/2 and
consequently ux = −(ξ2 −η2)/2 . Hence the principal-axes equation of the
hyperbolic paraboloid is z = (ξ2 −η2)/a with a = 2ℓ/ sin α . This ends the
solution of Problem 1 .
Solution to Problem 2 : According to the problem statement the point A on
ˆr1 at the foot of the common perpendicular is displaced to some prescribed
point P on ˆr2 . This displacement is achieved by a one-parametric subman-
ifold of the screw displacements solving Problem 1 . An appropriate measure

3.14 Screw Displacements Eﬀecting a Prescribed Line Displacement

of displacement of point A is the quantity (rP −rB) · r2 = (rP −rA) · r2 .
The analysis to follow shows that the essential measure of displacement is
the quantity σ = (rP −rB) · r2 cos α/2 .
Further below σ is prescribed. However, before doing so, σ is determined
for the screw displacements solving Problem 1 as function of ψ and u . Let
ϱ be the vector leading from the point of intersection of a screw axis ˆn with
the nodal line n2 to point A . Figure 3.17 yields the expression

(3.191)
The term sn is due to translation, and the remaining terms are copied from
(1.37). The scalar products are expressed in terms of ψ and u with the help
of (3.190), (3.177) and (3.178):
n · ϱ = 1

For s , for (1 −cos ϕ) and for sin ϕ the expressions (3.188) and (3.187),
respectively, are substituted. This yields σ as function of ψ and u . The
result is written in the two forms
σ = 2u sin α

(3.193)
In what follows, the manifold of all screw displacements is determined for
which σ is an arbitrarily prescribed constant −∞< σ < ∞. Then (3.193)
represents a constraint equation for ψ and u . As independent parameter ψ
is chosen. The solution for u as function of ψ is written in the two forms

The vector u(χ)n2 is the perpendicular from 0 onto the screw axis. The
rotation angle ϕ and the translation s are determined through (3.178) and
(3.188) as functions of ψ = χ + ψ0 .
The one-parametric manifold of screw axes with parameter χ deﬁnes a
ruled surface. With an additional free parameter λ this ruled surface has the
parameter equations
x = λ cos χ ,
z = −λ sin χ ,
y = h sin 2χ .
(3.200)
Compare this with Eqs.(3.170). Except for an interchange of y and z both
sets of equations are identical. Hence the ruled surface is a cylindroid the
directrix of which is the nodal line. The parameter-free equation of the cylin-
droid is (cf. (3.171))
y(x2 + z2) = −2hxz .
(3.201)
Every prescribed value of σ determines a one-parametric manifold of screw
displacements with the associated cylindroid of screw axes.
Following (3.171) some important geometrical properties of the cylindroid
were listed (see Fig. 3.16). At every point y in the interval |y| ≤|h| the
directrix is orthogonally intersected by two screw axes. At y = 0 these
screw axes lie in the x-axis and in the z-axis, respectively. These are the
principal screw axes. At y = −h and at y = +h the two intersecting screw
axes coincide. The angles associated with these axes are χ = −π/4 and
χ = +π/4 , respectively. These screw axes are torsal lines of the cylindroid.
Each of the two planes spanned by the directrix and by a torsal line is a
plane of symmetry of the cylindroid. Every pair of screw axes intersecting
the directrix in one point is located symmetrically with respect to each of the
planes of symmetry, i.e., under angles χ1 and χ2 related by the equation
χ2 = π/2 −χ1 . The relationship between the corresponding angles ψ1 =
χ1 + ψ0 and ψ2 = χ2 + ψ0 is ψ2 = π/2 −ψ1 + 2ψ0 .
It was shown that the screw axes under the angles ψ = 0 and ψ = −π/2
belong to special screw displacements. The ﬁrst one is characterized by ϕ =
±π and the second by ϕ = α and s = ℓ. It will be seen that also the
screw displacements with screw axes located symmetrically to these screw
axes have special properties. The associated angles are ψ = π/2 + 2ψ0 and
ψ = 2ψ0 , respectively.

First, it is investigated which screw axis ˆn intersects one or the other of
the two lines ˆr1 and ˆr2 . The screw axis ˆn = n+εw has the Pl¨ucker vectors
n and w given in (3.182) and (3.183), respectively. The lines ˆri = ri + εwi
(i = 1, 2) have the Pl¨ucker vectors ri and wi given in (3.177) and (3.181).
The condition of intersection is n · wi + ri · w = 0 (see (2.18)). It turns out
that this condition has for both lines the same form
ℓsin α
2 cos ψ + 2u cos α
2 sin ψ = 0 .
(3.202)
This equation is multiplied by sin α/2 , and then u sin α is replaced by the
expression in (3.194). Simple reformulation produces the ﬁnal form
(ℓcos ψ + σ sin ψ)

sin2 α
2 + cos2 α
2 sin2 ψ

= 0 .
(3.203)
The results are summarized as follows. A screw axis which intersects one of
the two lines intersects also the other, and there is only one such screw axis.
Its angle ψ is given by tan ψ = −ℓ/σ or, because of (3.196), by tan ψ =
−cot 2ψ0 . Hence ψ = 2ψ0 + π/2 . This shows that the screw axis is the one
which is located symmetrically with respect to χ = π/4 to the screw axis
associated with ψ = 0 , ϕ = π .
Every screw axis on the cylindroid, i.e., every angle ψ or χ , respectively,
is associated with a rotation angle ϕ and a translation s . The angle is deter-
mined by (3.178). The two screw axes along the principal axes and the two
screw axes along the torsal lines are examples of pairs of mutually orthogonal
screw axes (with or without intersection point). All pairs of mutually orthogo-
nal screw axes satisfy the identity (1.229): cot2(ϕ/2)+cot2(ϕ∗/2) ≡cot2 α/2 .
The quantity s in the screw displacements solving Problem 2 remains
to be formulated. It is obtained by substituting in (3.188) for u sin α the
expression from (3.194). The result is
s = σ cos ψ −ℓsin ψ .
(3.204)
Comparison with (3.195) yields the relationship
s(ψ) = −4 tan α
2 [u(ψ/2) −u0] .
(3.205)
Let s1 and s2 be the values of s associated with the principal axes x
(ψ = ψ0) and z (ψ = ψ0 −π/2). With (3.196)

(3.206)
From (3.204) it follows that there is only a single screw displacement which
is a pure rotation (s = 0). The direction of its axis is determined by tan ψ =
σ/ℓ= tan 2ψ0 . Hence ψ = 2ψ0 . This shows that the rotation axis is the

screw axis which is located symmetrically with respect to χ = π/4 to the
screw axis associated with ψ = −π/2 , ϕ = α and s = ℓ.
The results developed up to this point were obtained ﬁrst by Moshammer
[33], Pelisˇek [35], Rath [40] and Lilienthal [28]. See also Bottema [4]. None of
the cited papers made use of the principle of transference.
Equation (3.19) deﬁned for screw displacements the scalar measure pP =
(s/2)/ tan ϕ/2 . With the second Eq.(3.178) and with (3.204)
pP = 1

(3.207)
The angle ψ = 0 is associated with s = σ and
pP = 0 . Transformation
of (3.207) into the principal-axes system by means of (3.198) results in the
equation
pP = pP0 −h cos 2χ ,
pP0 = 1
4ℓcot α
2 .
(3.208)
The mean value pP0 of pP occurs in the torsal lines. The extremal values
pP0±h have opposite signs. They occur in the principal axes. For every pair of
screw axes which is located symmetrically with respect either to χ = π/4 or
to χ = −π/4 both screw axes are associated with one and the same measure
pP . Equations (3.208) and (3.199) reveal the remarkable relationship
(pP −pP0)2 + y2 ≡h2 .
(3.209)
It is formally identical with (3.164).
Special case σ = 0 ( A is displaced to B )
The formulas for ˆn and ϕ are independent of σ . Equations (3.195) – (3.198),
(3.204) and (3.206) become

Degree of Freedom of a Mechanism
A mechanism consists of rigid bodies and of joints inter-connecting the bodies.
A joint is a mechanical device which introduces kinematical constraints on
the motion of the two bodies relative to each other. This implies that inter-
connections by springs or dampers do not constitute joints since such elements
do not create kinematical constraints. Two bodies cannot be connected by
more than one joint. This means that the complete system of devices inter-
connecting two bodies is counted as a single joint. A joint does not connect
more than two bodies. If, for example, p > 2 bodies are rotating about a
single common shaft, this shaft represents p−1 joints each of them connecting
two bodies.
A single body moving in three-dimensional space without any kinematical
constraint is said to have the degree of freedom F = 6 . This is the minimal
number of generalized coordinates required for specifying its position and
angular orientation relative to some reference body. Let the moving body be
connected to the reference body by a joint. Kinematical constraints intro-
duced by this joint have the eﬀect that the body has a degree of freedom
1 ≤F ≤5 . This number F is also called degree of freedom f of the joint.
The number of independent kinematical constraints in the joint is 6 −f .
Examples: Revolute, prismatic and helical joints have f = 1 , cylindrical and
universal joints have f = 2 , and a spherical joint has f = 3 . The degree of
freedom is f = 4 ( f = 5 ) if the spherical joint is free to move along a rigid
line (in a rigid surface).
A mechanism is a joint-connected system of bodies. Let n be the number
of bodies. One of the bodies is held ﬁxed. In order to be connected the mech-
anism must have m ≥n−1 joints. Each joint i = 1, . . . , m has its individual
degree of freedom 1 ≤fi ≤5 . The mechanism as a whole has a degree of
freedom F . This is the minimal number of generalized coordinates required
for specifying its position and angular orientation relative to the single body
held ﬁxed. The degree of freedom F depends not only on the numbers n
and m and on the degrees of freedom 1 ≤fi ≤5 (i = 1, . . . , m) of the

individual joints, but also on the structure of the system. This dependency
is the subject of the present chapter.
4.1 Gr¨ubler’s Formula
A mechanism with m = n−1 joints is said to have tree structure (Fig. 4.1a).
Its characteristic feature is that any two bodies are connected by a uniquely
determined chain of bodies and of joints. Examples are serial robot arms
without kinematical constraint of the gripper to the surrounding environment
and the human body when standing on one foot and with free hands. A
mechanism with m = n joints contains a single closed chain or single loop.
An example is shown in Fig. 4.1b . A single loop without side branches (the
subsystem formed by the shaded bodies) is called simple closed chain. A
mechanism with m > n joints is called multiloop mechanism. It is created by
adding more joints in Fig. 4.1b . In both ﬁgures the schematically indicated
joints are of arbitrary nature with individual degrees of freedom 1 ≤f ≤5 .
Fig. 4.1 Mechanisms with tree structure ( m = n −1 ) (a) and with a single closed chain
( m = n ) (b). Simple closed chain formed by the shaded bodies
The degree of freedom F of a mechanism is determined as follows. As a
preparatory step all joints of the mechanism are removed, so that all bodies
except the single body held ﬁxed are free of kinematical constraints. In this
state these n −1 bodies have a total degree of freedom 6(n −1), namely,
six for each body. In joint i (i = 1, . . . , m) with joint degree of freedom
1 ≤fi ≤5 there are 6 −fi kinematical constraints. The total number of
constraints of all m joints equals the sum of all numbers (6 −fi) . The total
number of independent constraints may be smaller. It is smaller by d where
d (defect) denotes the number of dependent constraints. After reconstituting
the removed joints the degree of freedom of the mechanism is obtained:

4.1 Gr¨ubler’s Formula
139
This formula is valid for all mechanisms. In theory as well as in engineering
practice planar mechanisms and spherical mechanisms are important. In a
planar mechanism each body is in plane motion, and the reference plane is
the same for all bodies. In a spherical mechanism each body is rotating about
a ﬁxed point, and all bodies have the same ﬁxed point. A simple example is
the spherical four-bar with four bodies and four revolute joints intersecting
at a single point. In planar motion as well as in spherical motion about a
ﬁxed point a single unconstrained body has the degree of freedom three. In
planar as well as in spherical mechanisms an individual joint has the joint
degree of freedom 1 ≤fi ≤2 and, consequently, 3 −fi constraints. In both
types of mechanism the degree of freedom of the mechanism is
F = 3(n−1−m)+d+
m

i=1
fi
(planar and spherical mech’s ; 1 ≤fi ≤2 ) . (4.2)
Planar mechanisms can be seen as special cases of spherical mechanisms. The
ﬁxed point common to all bodies is at inﬁnity.
In the literature (4.1) and (4.2) are usually written without the defect d .
These formulas are due to Gr¨ubler [3]. The formulas are accompanied by the
warning that false results are obtained in the case of dependent constraints.
A simple example shows that false results may be obtained even if the defect
is taken into account. Imagine two systems 1 and 2 which are sharing a
single body 0 which is held ﬁxed. Suppose, (4.1) yields F1 = −1 for sys-
tem 1 (indicating rigidity) and F2 = 1 for system 2 . Clearly, the entire
system composed of systems 1 and 2 together has the degree of freedom
F = 1 . However, (4.1) applied to the entire system yields the wrong result
F = F1 + F2 = 0 indicating rigidity. The formula F = F1 + F2 is correct
if and only if F1, F2 ≥0 . The general statement is: Equations (4.1) and
(4.2) applied to an entire system yield correct results if and only if, by the
same equations, every subsystem of the entire system has a degree of freedom
≥0 . Hence the conclusion: In order to get a correct result it is necessary,
ﬁrst, to determine the degree of freedom of subsystems. Every subsystem
with a degree of freedom ≤0 must be counted as a single rigid body. Only
then do (4.1) and (4.2) yield correct results for the entire system. Most en-
gineering systems are so simple that the degree of freedom of subsystems is
obvious without any analysis. In complex spatial multiloop systems, however,
a separate analysis of subsystems may be necessary.
Equations (4.1) and (4.2) show that the degree of freedom F of a mech-
anism is independent of which body is chosen as ﬁxed body.
Mechanisms with tree structure (Fig. 4.1a) are characterized by m = n−1
and d = 0 . In this case, both formulas for the degree of freedom read

chain (Fig. 4.1b ; m = n ) (4.1) and (4.2) have the forms

(4.4)
A mechanism with degree of freedom F = 1 is called 1-d.o.f. mechanism or
mobility-one mechanism. From (4.4) follows
Theorem 4.1. In a simple closed chain with mobility one and with indepen-
dent constraints ( F = 1 , d = 0 ) the number of joint variables is

(4.5)
Applied to revolute joints ( fi ≡1 ) this theorem states that a simple (non-
spherical) spatial closed chain must have seven revolute joints and seven
bodies in order to have mobility one if all constraints are independent. For
planar and for spherical simple closed chains this number of revolute joints
and of bodies is four. Engineering realizations are the planar four-bar and the
spherical four-bar. For both of them the ﬁrst Eq.(4.4) yields the correct result
F = 1 only if d = 3 . Indeed, three constraints are dependent. In the planar
four-bar, for example, one out of four parallel revolute joints establishes the
constraint to the plane of motion. This constraint must not be counted as
independent in the other three revolutes.
A mechanism is said to be overconstrained if it has a degree of freedom
F ≥1 only because of the existence of dependent constraints (d > 0) .
Overconstrained mechanisms must be manufactured with great precision be-
cause inaccuracies result in the loss of mobility. Inhomogeneous changes of
temperature may have the same eﬀect. For these reasons most engineering
mechanisms are designed such that overconstraint does not occur. Example:
The ideal planar four-bar is an overconstrained mechanism. This overcon-
straint is avoided by giving the bearing of one axis the freedom to adjust its
direction as is required.
4.2 Illustrative Examples
The determination of the defect d in Gr¨ubler’s Eq.(4.1) can be a diﬃcult
problem requiring a kinematics analysis in which all mechanism parameters –
link lengths and parameters specifying directions of joint axes – are involved.

4.2 Illustrative Examples
141
In the following sections this analysis is demonstrated for seven diﬀerent
mechanisms.
4.2.1 Five-Point-Contact Joint
Subject of investigation is a rigid body ﬁve points of which are constrained
to move in prescribed surfaces. To be determined is the degree of freedom
of the body. The ﬁve surfaces constitute a single body referred to as frame.
The system is a mechanism with n = 2 bodies and with m = 1 joint. The
constraint of a point Pi to a surface prevents the point from moving in the
direction of the unit vector ni normal to the surface. There are ﬁve such
constraints in the joint. If d is again the number of dependent constraints,
the joint degree of freedom is f = 6 −(5 −d) = 1 + d . According to (4.1)
this is also the degree of freedom of the mechanism and, thus, of the body.
The defect d is determined as follows. According to Chasles’s Theorem
3.1 an inﬁnitesimal displacement of a rigid body is a screw displacement with
a certain screw axis and a certain pitch (this includes as special cases pure
translation and pure rotation). The inﬁnitesimal displacement of an arbitrary
body-ﬁxed point is directed along the helix through this point. Every line
perpendicular to the helix is a complex line of the linear complex with this
screw axis and with this pitch (see the comment on Fig. 2.5). From this it
follows that the normals to the ﬁve surfaces at the points Pi (i = 1, . . . , 5) are
complex lines. Let ri (i = 1, . . . , 5) be the position vectors of the points Pi
in a reference basis ﬁxed on the frame. In this basis the normals have Pl¨ucker
vectors vi = ni and wi = ri × ni
(i = 1, . . . , 5) . From ﬁve independent
complex lines the vectors a and b of a linear complex (a ; b) are determined
by Eqs.(2.38):
wi · a + vi · b = 0
(i = 1, . . . , 5) .
(4.6)
The screw axis has the direction of a . The location of the screw axis and the
pitch are determined by (2.29):
u = a × b
a2
,
p = a · b
a2
.
(4.7)
From these facts it follows that the defect d of the coeﬃcient matrix in (4.6)
is the quantity determining the degree of freedom f = 1 + d of the joint.
An engineering realization of the constraint of a body to ﬁve surfaces is
shown in Fig. 4.2 . The body, now called platform, is connected to a frame
by ﬁve rods with spherical joints at both ends. Each surface is a sphere with
the rod length as radius. The axes of the ﬁve rods are the complex lines. The
platform on ﬁve rods ﬁnds an important engineering application in the ﬁve-
point wheel suspension system for cars shown in Fig. 4.3 . The platform is the

carrier of the wheel, and the frame is the car body. A single spherical joint
on the car body is operated by the steering mechanism. When the steering
is held ﬁxed, the carrier has a single degree of freedom. Springs connecting
the carrier with the car body allow small carrier displacements only. These
displacements are screw displacements.
The screw displacement of a platform can be made visible by the following
experiment. Instead of mounting the platform on rigid rods it is suspended
by ﬁve mutually skew inextensible strings in such a way that an equilibrium
position exists in which the weight of the platform keeps all strings tight.
A small perturbation causes the platform to oscillate about the equilibrium
position. This oscillation is a screw motion about the axis and with the pitch
determined by (4.6) and (4.7).
If the rods in Fig. 4.2 are counted as bodies, the entire system is composed
of n = 7 bodies (ﬁxed frame, platform and ﬁve rods) and of m = 10 spherical
joints each having the joint degree of freedom f = 3 . With these numbers
Gr¨ubler’s formula (4.1) yields for the degree of freedom of the mechanism the
result F ′ = 6(n−1−m)+d+mf = 6+d . Since every rod has the degree of
freedom of rotation about its own axis, the degree of freedom of the platform
is F = F ′ −5 = 1 + d as before.
To a platform mounted on ﬁve rods additional rods can be added in such a
way that, in the assembly position, all rods are lines of a single linear complex.
In this position then, the degree of freedom of the platform is F = 1 . In
general, it is not possible to move the platform into another position. The
platform is said to be shaky in this position. In exceptional cases a platform
is mounted on more than ﬁve rods in such a way that large motions are
possible. This requires an arrangement where every position in the course of
motion satisﬁes the condition that all rods are complex lines of a single linear
complex. The platform-ﬁxed endpoint of each rod is moving on the sphere
having its center at the other endpoint of the rod. In Sect. 6.8 such systems
are investigated.

4.2.2 Shaky Truss
In Fig. 4.4a a planar multiloop mechanism with n = 7 bodies (ﬁxed body 0
plus bodies 1, . . . , 6) and with m = 9 revolute joints is shown (the connection
of bodies 2 , 4 and 5 represents two joints). To be determined is the degree
of freedom F .
Fig. 4.4 Planar mechanism with 7 bodies and 9 revolute joints (a) before and (b) after
eliminating rod 6
Solution: Equation (4.2) yields F = d . Hence the degree of freedom is F > 0
only if at least one constraint is dependent. In order to ﬁnd out whether this
is the case, rod 6 is eliminated and, thereby, a single constraint forcing the
endpoints P16 and P36 to have identical velocity components in the direction
of rod 6 . The mechanism without rod 6 is shown in Fig. 4.4b . If in this
system with degree of freedom F = 1 P16 and P36 have identical velocity
components in the direction of the eliminated rod 6 , this rod 6 is unnec-
essary which means that d = 1 . Velocities are determined with the help of
Theorem 15.3 by Kennedy and Aronhold. The condition to be satisﬁed is
that the pole P13 is located on the line P16P36 . This pole P13 is found as
intersection of the lines P10P30 and P12P23 . The poles P12 and P23 are
determined as intersections of the lines P10P20 and P14P24 and of the lines
P20P30 and P25P35 , respectively. In the present case, P13 is, indeed, located
on the line P16P36 . However, this is true only in the instantaneous position
of the mechanism. Hence the conclusion: In the position shown the mecha-
nism in Fig. 4.4a has the degree of freedom F = 1 . Neighboring positions
cannot be assumed. In statics the system is called an inﬁnitesimally mobile
or shaky truss. Gr¨ubler’s formula and the formula used for checking statical
determinacy of trusses are directly related.

4 Degree of Freedom of a Mechanism
4.2.3 Closed Chain Formed by Four Planar Four-Bars
The planar system shown in Fig. 4.5 can be interpreted in diﬀerent ways.
For one thing, it is a multiloop system with m = 12 bodies (the shaded
bodies plus eight rods) and with n = 16 revolute joints each joint having the
individual degree of freedom f = 1 . With these numbers Gr¨ubler’s Eq.(4.2)
yields the total degree of freedom F = d+1 . In a much simpler interpretation
each pair of rods interconnecting two shaded bodies constitutes a joint with
the individual degree of freedom f = 1 . In this interpretation the system
consists of bodies 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and of joints 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . With these
numbers Gr¨ubler’s equation yields F = d + 1 as before. In joint 1 the link
lengths ℓ1 , r1 , a1 , r2 represent a four-bar. Since the same is true for the
other joints, the mechanism is formed by four coplanar four-bars. The link
of length ℓ1 in four-bar 1 is the ﬁxed link. On this link the x, y reference
system is ﬁxed. The kinematics is analyzed as follows.
The links of lengths ℓ4 and a4 are eliminated and thereby the constraints
on the x, y-coordinates of the endpoints P1, P2, P3, P4 :
(x2 −x1)2 + (y2 −y1)2 −ℓ2
4 = 0 ,
(x4 −x3)2 + (y4 −y3)2 −a2
4 = 0 . (4.8)
The resulting system of four-bars 1 , 2 , 3 has the degree of freedom three.
As independent variables the input angles ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ3 of these four-bars are
chosen. Figure 17.1 shows that a four-bar with input angle ϕi can assume
two positions with output angles ψi1 and ψi2 . Their sines and cosines are
determined by (17.12) and (17.11). For four-bar 1 the equations are

The x, y-coordinates of the points A and B in these two positions are ex-
pressed in terms of ℓ1 , r2 , cos ψ1k , sin ψ1k
and of parameters specifying
body 1 .
The same equations, but with ϕ2 as independent variable and with other
parameters, determine the coordinates of P1 and P3 in the x′, y′-system
shown in the ﬁgure. As before, two diﬀerent solutions exist for every angle
ϕ2 . Transformation from the x′, y′-system into the x, y-system results in
expressions for the x, y-coordinates of P1 and P3 as functions of ϕ1 and
ϕ2 . Next, the x, y-coordinates of P2 and P4 are expressed as functions of
ϕ1 and ϕ3 . With minor modiﬁcations the equations are the same as for the
coordinates of P1 and P3 .
The results obtained so far are summarized as follows. Four diﬀerent sets
of x, y-coordinates of P2 and P4 are known as functions of ϕ1 and ϕ3 , and
four diﬀerent sets of x, y-coordinates of P1 and P3 are known as functions of
ϕ1 and ϕ2 . Each of the former four sets has to be combined with each
of the latter four sets. Thus, altogether sixteen combinations have to be
investigated. For each combination Eqs. (4.8) are formulated. For at least
one combination the degree of freedom is either F = 1 or F = 2 . It is
F = 1 if for every ϕ1 (in a certain interval) unique real solutions ϕ2 , ϕ3
exist. It is F = 2 if both constraint equations are identical. A combination
has the degree of freedom F = 0 if real solutions ϕ2 , ϕ3 do not exist for
any angle ϕ1 .
4.2.4 Trihedral Plane-Symmetric Bricard Mechanism
The mechanism shown in Fig. 4.6 is a spatial closed chain with six bodies
(ﬁxed body 0 and bodies 1, . . . , 5 ) and with six revolute joints 1, . . . , 6 . The
two joint axes of each body are mutually orthogonal and nonintersecting.
Bodies 0 , 2 and 4 are identical and bodies 1 , 3 and 5 are identical. Fur-
thermore, body 1 is a mirror image of body 0 . In the position shown the
bodies are inscribed in a cube with all joint axes and all common perpen-
diculars of adjacent joint axes aligned along edges of the cube. In this cube
conﬁguration the joint axes 1 , 3 , 5 form a trihedral intersecting at a single
point, and the axes 2 , 4 , 6 form another trihedral. Furthermore, the six
axes display a triple plane-symmetry. They are symmetric with respect to
the plane spanned by the axes 1 and 4 , to the plane spanned by the axes 2
and 5 and to the plane spanned by the axes 3 and 6 .
The kinematics of the mechanism is best understood if a model is avail-
able. It can be produced from cardboard by folding bodies. The angle γ
should be 30◦. From such a model it is learned that the mechanism has the

4 Degree of Freedom of a Mechanism
Fig. 4.6 Spatial closed chain with six bodies and six revolute joints
degree of freedom F = 1 . Moreover, the axes
1 , 3 , 5 and 2 , 4 , 6 are
permanently forming two trihedrals and also the triple plane-symmetry is
preserved. These experimental results are conﬁrmed by the following kine-
matics analysis (Wittenburg [7, 8]).
Equation (4.1) yields F = d . Hence a degree of freedom F > 0 exists only
if at least one constraint is dependent. According to Gr¨ubler’s formula there
are altogether 30 constraints in the altogether six joints. It is not necessary to
analyze this system of constraints. The kinematics analysis is much simpler
if the joint between bodies 0 and 5 is cut. This results in a serial open chain
with ﬁve joints. For this chain Gr¨ubler’s formula (4.3) yields the degree of
freedom F = 5 . Reconstitution of the cut joint introduces ﬁve constraints.
These are the constraints which have to be analyzed. This is done as follows.
On each body i (i = 0, . . . , 5) a body-ﬁxed basis ei is deﬁned. In Fig. 4.6
only basis e0 is shown. In the cube conﬁguration of this ﬁgure all body-ﬁxed
bases are aligned parallel. The locations of the origins are without interest.
Three of the ﬁve constraint equations express the fact that, independent of
rotation angles in the joints, the chain of vectors leading from the point P on
body 0 along body edges to the coincident point P on body 5 is closed. This
is the vector equation

follows. In joint i (i = 1, . . . , 5) ϕi is the rotation angle of body i relative
to body i −1 . Sign convention: ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ3 are positive and ϕ4 , ϕ5 are
negative in the case of a right-handed rotation about the basis vector in the
respective joint axis. In the cube conﬁguration all angles are zero. Let Ai be
the transformation matrix for joint i deﬁned by the equation ei = Ai ei−1 .

c4(s3s2c1 + c3s1) −s4c2c1 = 0 .

position of the mechanism the constraint equations are satisﬁed:
ϕ3 = ϕ1 ,
ϕ5 = ϕ1 ,
ϕ4 = ϕ2 .

4 Degree of Freedom of a Mechanism
In addition to (4.20) this constitutes a fourth independent constraint equa-
tion. There are no other independent constraint equations. Hence the mech-
anism is overconstrained with the degree of freedom F = 1 . As independent
variable the angle ϕ1 is chosen.
Remark: The constraint Eqs.(4.20) can be found without making experiments
as follows. Multiply (4.16) by c1c4 , (4.17) by −c1s4 , (4.19) by −(1 −s1)
and add. Simple reformulation followed by division through c4 results in an
equation relating ϕ3 to ϕ1 :
(1 −s1)c3 = (1 −s3)c1 .
(4.23)
The equation has the solutions ϕ3 = ϕ1 and ϕ3 = π/2 . Only the ﬁrst
solution is useful. This is the ﬁrst Eq.(4.20). Because of the equal character
of all bodies and of all joints and because of the deﬁnitions of joint angles this
equation holds true if the indices are increased by 1 and by 2 . This yields
the other two constraint equations ϕ4 = ϕ2 and ϕ5 = ϕ3 . End of remark.
The relationship (4.22) is illustrated in the diagram of Fig. 4.7 . Because
of the conditions | sin ϕ1,2| ≤1 the angles are restricted to the intervals
−210◦≤ϕ1 ≤+30◦and −30◦≤ϕ2 ≤+210◦. Motion in these intervals is
possible without collision of neighboring bodies if the angle γ shown in Fig.
4.6 is γ ≤30◦. The mechanism can undergo a continuous twisting motion
similar to an elastic ribbon.
Diﬀerentiation of (4.22) with respect to time yields the relationship be-
tween angular velocities:

(1 −sin ϕ1)2 cos ϕ2

The mechanism is highly special. A mechanism having two trihedrals of
permanently intersecting axes need not be plane-symmetric, and a plane-
symmetric mechanism need not be trihedral. Bricard [1] discovered a ﬁve-
parametric family of trihedral mechanisms and an eight-parametric family of
plane-symmetric mechanisms. These mechanisms are analyzed in Sects. 6.4.2
and 6.4.3 .
4.2.5 Line-Symmetric Bricard Mechanism
The mechanism shown in Fig. 4.8 is another spatial closed chain with six
bodies (ﬁxed body 0 and bodies 1, . . . , 5) and with six revolute joints 1, . . . , 6
(thick lines). The two joint axes of each body are mutually orthogonal and
intersecting. In the position shown the axes are edges of a cube (dashed
lines). The name of the mechanism points to the fact that the six joint axes
are pairwise symmetric with respect to a line (pairs 1 and 4 , 2 and 5 ,
3 and 6 ). In the cube conﬁguration the line of symmetry is identiﬁed as
follows. Draw in the square at the bottom of the cube the diagonal through
P and give this diagonal a vertical translation by half the side length of the
cube. It is obvious that a 180◦-rotation about the line thus deﬁned carries
joint axis i ( i = 1, 2, 3) into the position originally held by joint axis i + 3 .
A kinematics analysis is found in Pandrea [5]1. For checking results it is
helpful to have a model made of six identical pieces of cardboard.
Fig. 4.8 Spatial closed chain with six bodies and six revolute joints
1 Pandrea attributes the mechanism to Franke. In a private communication P. Dietmaier
pointed out that R. Franke: Vom Aufbau der Getriebe, v.2 (1951) Deutscher-Ingenieur-
Verlag D¨usseldorf shows, without kinematics analysis, a line-symmetric mechanism in
which the joint axes on the bodies are skew.

4 Degree of Freedom of a Mechanism
Equation (4.1) yields F = d . Hence a degree of freedom F > 0 exists only if
at least one constraint is dependent. Constraint equations are formulated by
a method similar to the one used in the previous section. On each body i (i =
0, . . . , 5) a body-ﬁxed basis ei is deﬁned. In Fig. 4.8 only basis e0 is shown.
In the position shown in this ﬁgure all body-ﬁxed bases are aligned parallel.
Three of the ﬁve constraint equations express the fact that, independent of
rotation angles in the joints, the chain of vectors leading from the point P on
body 0 along body edges to the coincident point P on body 5 is closed. This

A6A5A4A3A2A1 = I or
A3A2A1 = (A6A5A4)T .
(4.27)
Every matrix Ai is a function of the rotation angle ϕi of the respective
joint i . Deﬁnition: ϕi is the rotation angle of body i relative to body i −1
(i = 1, . . . , 5) and of body 0 relative to body 5 in the case i = 6 . Sign
convention: ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ4 are positive and ϕ3 , ϕ5 , ϕ6 are negative in the
case of a right-handed rotation about the basis vector in the respective joint
axis. In the conﬁguration shown in the ﬁgure all angles are zero. With the

Following Pandrea the identity of matrix elements is formulated. The ele-
ments (1,2) and (2,1) yield the equations
c1s2 = c4s5 and
c3s2 = c6s5 .
They are satisﬁed with
c4 = c1 ,
s5 = s2 ,

but also with c4 = −c1 , s5 = −s2 , c6 = −c3 . In either case the signs of
s4 , c5 and s6 are still unknown. The calculations to come reveal that the
pairwise identity of all matrix elements is possible only if Eqs.(4.30) are valid
in combination with
s4 = −s1 ,
c5 = c2 ,
s6 = −s3 .
(4.31)
Hence
ϕ4 = −ϕ1 ,
ϕ5 = ϕ2 ,
ϕ6 = −ϕ3 .
(4.32)
After substituting (4.30) and (4.31) into (4.29) the pairwise identity of the
matrix elements (1,1) and (3,1) is formulated. This produces the equations
c1c2c3
+s1s3 = c2 ,
s1c2c3 +(s2 −c1)s3 = 0 .

By substituting these expressions the pairwise identity of all matrix elements
in (4.29) is veriﬁed.
Next, (4.26) is decomposed in basis e3 . Using, for the moment, in (4.28)
only (4.30) and (4.31) this decomposition produces the equations
c2 + c1s2 = 1 −s1 ,
(4.35)
c2 −c3s2 = 1 + s3 ,
c3 −s2s3 = c1 −s1s2 .
(4.36)
When in (4.36) c3 and s3 are replaced by the expressions (4.34), these two
equations are satisﬁed if (4.35) is satisﬁed. This proves the existence of a single
dependent constraint. Thus, the mechanism is an overconstrained mechanism
with the degree of freedom F = 1 . Equation (4.35) has two solutions

4 Degree of Freedom of a Mechanism
This is proved by substituting (4.37) into (4.34) and by verifying that c3k =
s2j and s3k = −c2j .
The square root in (4.37) is zero for s1 = (1 −
√
3)/2 , i.e. for ϕmin ≈
−21, 5◦and for ϕmax ≈π + 21, 5◦. Only if ϕ1 is in the interval between
these bounds, the angle ϕ2 is real. At the bounds the solution is c2 =
√
3−1 .
This determines the angles ϕ2 ≈±42, 9◦. In the diagram in Fig. 4.9 ϕ2k
and ϕ3k
(k = 1, 2) are shown as functions of ϕ1 . The mechanism can be
assembled in two conﬁgurations. The change from one conﬁguration to the
other is achieved by opening and re-closing a single joint in such a way that
body-ﬁxed vectors along the opened joint axis have equal directions after if
they have equal directions before. In Fig. 4.8 the ﬁrst conﬁguration is shown
for the variable ϕ1 = 0 with ϕ2 = . . . = ϕ5 = 0 . In the second conﬁguration
ϕ1 = 0 is associated with ϕ3 = −π/2 , ϕ4 = 0 , ϕ2 = ϕ5 = ϕ6 = π/2 . This
conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 4.10a . It is possible to open and to re-close
a single joint in such a way that the said body-ﬁxed vectors along the joint
axis reverse their relative orientation. However, this re-closing is possible in a
single position only in which the system is then rigid. This position is shown
in Fig. 4.10b .

The mechanism is a very special case of a nine-parametric family of line-
symmetric Bricard mechanisms. These mechanisms are analyzed in Sect.
6.4.1.
4.2.6 Homokinetic Shaft Coupling
The mechanism shown in Fig. 4.11 is a spatial simple closed chain S1R1S2R2
with an additional revolute joint R3 . The parameters are such that, in the
position shown, the closed chain is symmetric with respect to the plane Σ
which is bisecting the angle between links 1 and 2 (referred to as shafts 1
and 2 ) and containing S1 , S2 and the point of intersection A of the revolutes
R1 and R2 (in the ﬁgure Σ is normal to the plane of the drawing). For the
entire mechanism with ﬁve bodies 0, . . . , 4 and with ﬁve joints Gr¨ubler’s
Eq.(4.4) yields the degree of freedom F = 3 . Shaft 2 is free to change its
direction in space as is indicated by arrows. In addition, shaft 1 is free to
rotate about its longitudinal axis (angle of rotation ϕ1 ). In every position
of the mechanism the closed chain is symmetric with respect to the plane
Σ bisecting the angle between shafts 1 and 2 and containing S1 , S2 and
A . When the direction of shaft 2 is ﬁxed, Σ is ﬁxed independent of ϕ1 .
Permanent symmetry with respect to a ﬁxed plane Σ has the consequence
that both shafts have identical angular velocities: ˙ϕ2 ≡˙ϕ1 . The results are
summarized as follows. The plane-symmetric closed chain is a shaft coupling
characterized by the properties
(A) the axis of shaft 2 is free to change its direction during operation
(B) ˙ϕ2/ ˙ϕ1 ≡1 independent of ϕ1 in every position of shaft 2 held ﬁxed.
Shaft couplings having these two properties are called homokinetic. The com-
bination of these properties is essential in many engineering systems. A typ-

ical example is the coupling between front wheel and drive shaft in a front-
wheel driven automobile. The coupling must have property (A) since the
direction of the wheel axis is changing due to steering maneuvers and to dy-
namic processes in the suspension system. Property (B) is necessary in order
to prevent resonance vibrations in the car. The well-known Hooke’s joint is
a shaft coupling having property (A), but not property (B). Its ratio ˙ϕ2/ ˙ϕ1
is a π -periodic function of ϕ1 . Only its mean value is 1 . This is shown in
Sect. 13.1 . In the power train of a car such a source of vibrations with a fre-
quency proportional to the speed of the car is unacceptable. It was the need
for cars with front-wheel drive which triggered the development of compact
and reliable homokinetic shaft couplings. See Sect. 13.4 for a more general
theory.
4.2.7 Mobile Tilings
In Fig. 4.12a
Q is a convex quadrilateral of arbitrary nonparallelogram-
shape. By 180◦-rotations about the midpoints of its sides four congruent
quadrilaterals are produced. Let Q′ be one of them, and let t1 and t2
be the two diagonals as shown. By repeated translations t1 and t2 of the
hexagon composed of Q and Q′ the inﬁnite plane is ﬁlled with congruent
quadrilaterals without gaps and overlaps. The individual quadrilateral is re-
ferred to as tile, and the plane-ﬁlling pattern is called tiling. The tiling is
invariant with respect to periodical translations with t1 , t2 , t1 + t2 and
t1−t2 . It is also invariant with respect to 180◦-rotations about the midpoints
of sides of quadrilaterals.
Remark: All statements made up to this point are valid also for parallel-
ograms and for nonconvex quadrilaterals. They are also valid in the much
more general case when each side of Q is replaced by an arbitrary centrally
symmetric curve. More about tilings is found in Sect. 14.6.
Kokotsakis [4] recognized that a tiling made of convex quadrilaterals of
arbitrary nonparallelogram-shape is a 1-d.o.f. mechanism if all quadrilaterals
are rigid bodies and all sides revolute joints.
Proof (Stachel [6]): The shaded area in Fig. 4.12b is a cluster of four con-
gruent quadrilaterals Q1 , Q2 , Q3 , Q4 grouped around center 01 . In what
follows, it is referred to as cluster 1 . When it is isolated from the surround-
ing quadrilaterals, it represents a spherical four-bar with constant angles α1 ,
α2 , α3 , α4 and with axes along unit vectors n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 pointing away
from 01 . Notation: αi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) is the internal angle of Qi at 01 . The
variable angle of rotation of Qi relative to Qi−1 about ni is called ϕi
(i = 1, 2, 3, 4 cyclic; ϕi = 0 in the planar position). This is the notation used
in Fig. 18.1a . For a given angle ϕ1 the spherical four-bar can assume two
positions. Two solutions ϕ4 as functions of ϕ1 are determined by Eqs.(18.2),

4.2 Illustrative Examples
155
Fig. 4.12 Tiling with irregular convex quadrilaterals (a) and clusters of four quadrilat-
erals (b)
(18.3). With cyclic permutations of indices the same equations relate other
pairs of neighboring angles so that also ϕ2 and ϕ3 are determined as func-
tions of ϕ1 . If ( ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ3 , ϕ4 ) is a solution then, because of the symmetry
to the plane, also ( −ϕ1 , −ϕ2 , −ϕ3 , −ϕ4 ) is a solution. In what follows,
ϕ1 > 0 is assumed. The equations reveal the following facts. If α4 is the
largest of the four angles α1 , α2 , α3 , α4 , as is the case in the ﬁgure,
ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ4 > 0 and ϕ3 < 0 in one position and
ϕ1 , ϕ3 , ϕ4 > 0 and ϕ2 < 0 in the other position.
These results are easily veriﬁed experimentally by folding a circular piece of
paper along four radii having the directions of n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 (the four
sectors should be made very stiﬀ). It is also apparent that the cluster is
immobile if the quadrilateral is nonconvex.
In what follows, it is assumed that in Fig. 4.12b the shaded cluster 1
is shown deformed in one of its two possible modes (ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ3 , ϕ4) with
ϕ1 arbitrary. Let ϱi denote the tensor of the 180◦-rotation about the axis
through the midpoint of the edge common to Qi and Qi−1 which is (i)
normal to ni and (ii) bisecting the angle π −ϕi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4 cyclic ). The
rotation ϱi transforms Qi into Qi−1 and vice versa since a 180◦-rotation
equals its inverse. The short-hand notation of these relationships is
Q1 = ϱ1Q4 ,
Q4 = ϱ1Q1 = ϱ1ϱ2Q2 ,
Q3 = ϱ4Q4 ,
Q4 = ϱ4Q3 = ϱ4ϱ3Q2

(4.40)
and, consequently,
ϱ4ϱ3 = ϱ1ϱ2 .
(4.41)
By applying ϱ1 to the entire cluster 1 the overlapping congruent cluster 2
with center 02 and with new quadrilaterals ϱ1Q2 and ϱ1Q3 is obtained.
Likewise, applying ϱ4 to cluster 1 the overlapping congruent cluster 4 with

156
4 Degree of Freedom of a Mechanism
center 04 and with new quadrilaterals ϱ4Q1 and ϱ4Q2 is obtained. Proposi-
tion: The three quadrilaterals ϱ1Q2 , Q4 and ϱ4Q2 are obtained by subject-
ing Q1 , Q2 and Q3 , respectively, to the rotation ϱ2 followed by the rotation
ϱ1 , i.e., ϱ1Q2 = ϱ1ϱ2Q1 , Q4 = ϱ1ϱ2Q2 , ϱ4Q2 = ϱ1ϱ2Q3 . Proof: The ﬁrst
equation is true since Q2 = ϱ2Q1 . The second equation is one of Eqs.(4.40).
The third equation follows from ϱ4Q3 = ϱ4ϱ3Q4 in combination with (4.41).
End of proof. From this it follows that the cluster 3 formed by the quadri-
laterals ϱ1Q3 , Q1 , ϱ4Q3 and Q5 with center 03 is also congruent with
cluster 1 and that it is the result of the said rotations. By applying the same
procedure successively inﬁnitely many clusters can be added in all directions,
all clusters being congruent with cluster 1 independent of the deformation
of cluster 1 . This ends the proof of mobility with degree of freedom one.
Taking ϱ1 as example, the 180◦-rotations are expressed analytically as
follows. It suﬃces to know the angle ϕ1 of the rotation (n1, ϕ1) and the
position vectors ri (i = 1, 2, 3) of the corners 01 , 02 , 03 of Q4 in some
arbitrarily chosen reference system. These data determine the midpoint rA =
(r1 + r2)/2 on the edge and the unit vector n1 = (r2 −r1)/|r2 −r1| of the
rotation (n1, ϕ1) . The auxiliary vector ϱ = r3 −r1 determines the unit
vector e = (ϱ −n1 n1 · ϱ)/|ϱ −n1 n1 · ϱ)| in the plane of Q4 and normal to
n1 . The vectors n1 and e and the angle ϕ1 determine the unit vector n
along the axis of the 180◦-rotation ϱ1 :
n = e sin ϕ1
2 −n1 × e cos ϕ1
2 .
(4.42)
According to (3.17) the relationship between the positions r and r∗of an
arbitrary point before and after the 180◦-rotation ϱ1 is
r∗= 2rA −r + 2n n · (r −rA) .
(4.43)
Formulas for the rotations ϱ2 , ϱ3 and ϱ4 are obtained by cyclic permutation
of indices.

Spatial Simple Closed Chains
Subject of this chapter is the kinematics of 1-d.o.f. spatial simple closed
chains with axial joints. The simple closed chain is explained in Fig. 4.1b .
Axial joints are the cylindrical joint (C), the revolute joint (R) and the pris-
matic joint (P). Overconstrained mechanisms are excluded from considera-
tion. Then it is known from Theorem 4.1 that a 1-d.o.f. spatial simple closed
chain has seven joint variables. The variable of either one revolute joint or
one prismatic joint is declared independent. The problem to be solved is to
determine the six dependent variables in terms of the independent variable
and of constant mechanism parameters. The solution to this problem is of
great engineering importance because 1-d.o.f. spatial simple closed chains are
basic elements of machine mechanisms.
A simple closed chain is speciﬁed by the ordered sequence of letters C ,
R and P of its joints. Neither cyclic permutation of the sequence of letters
nor reversal of the sequence changes the mechanism. Thus, the sequences
RCPRC , CPRCR and CRPCR represent one and the same mechanism
whereas the sequence CCRRP represents a diﬀerent mechanism with the
same set of joints. The sequence of letters does not tell which joint variable
is considered as independent variable.
Let nC , nR and nP be the numbers of cylindrical, of revolute and of
prismatic joints, respectively. Important characteristic numbers are the total
number nϕ of angular variables, the total number nt of translatory variables
and the total number n of joints and of bodies. These numbers are
nϕ = nC + nR ,
nt = nC + nP = 7 −nϕ ,
n = nC + nR + nP . (5.1)
The numbers nC , nR and nP are subject to the constraint nϕ + nt =
2nC +nR +nP = 7 and also to the constraint nϕ = nC +nR > 3 because with
three or fewer rotation axes no change of angular positions is possible. An
equivalent formulation is nt = nC+nP ≤3 . It expresses the fact that three is
the maximum number of independent translations. Under these constraints

∗) Nϕ = 4 conﬁgurations exist if (i) the mechanism is RCRCR and (ii) the independent
angle is in one of the underscored revolutes. Nϕ = 8 otherwise
altogether ten combinations of numbers nC , nR and nP are possible. They
are listed in Table 5.1 in the order of increasing numbers nϕ . For each com-
bination the complete list of mechanisms with the respective combination is
given. Whenever possible the letter sequence is shown in a form symmetri-
cal to the central letter. Symmetrical letter sequences are printed boldface.
The numbers Nϕ and Nt in the last columns are results of the kinematics
analysis to come. Nϕ is the number of conﬁgurations which a mechanism
has for a given value of the independent angular variable in a revolute joint,
and Nt is the number of conﬁgurations which a mechanism has for a given
value of the independent translatory variable in a prismatic joint. The planar
four-bar mechanism is known to have two conﬁgurations for a given value of
the input crank angle. The mechanisms in Table 5.1 have two or four or eight
or sixteen conﬁgurations.
About the relationship between Nϕ and Nt the following can be said
without any analysis. Let the angular and the translatory variable in a cylin-
drical joint λ be called ϕλ and hλ , respectively. If joint λ is a prismatic
joint, ϕλ is a constant ϕ∗
λ and hλ is variable. If joint λ is a revolute joint,
ϕλ is variable and hλ is a constant h∗
λ . Imagine now two mechanisms I and
II with the only diﬀerence that joint λ is a prismatic joint in mechanism I
and a revolute joint in mechanism II . Furthermore, it is assumed that the
independent variables are chosen such that in both mechanisms hλ = h∗
λ
and ϕλ = ϕ∗
λ . Then both mechanisms are identical in this position of their
joint λ . Consequently, both mechanisms have the same sets of solutions for
the six dependent variables. This means that Nt for mechanism I equals
Nϕ for mechanism II . This equality is shown in Table 5.1 . By replacing in
a mechanism of row 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 or 9 a prismatic joint by a revolute joint a

mechanism of row 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 , respectively, is produced. The number
Nt for the former equals the number Nϕ for the latter.
Before starting the kinematics analysis joint variables and mechanism pa-
rameters must be deﬁned. This is the subject of the following Sect. 5.1 . Sec-
tion 5.2 is devoted to coordinate transformations of relevant vectors. In Sect.
5.3 on closure conditions basic equations are formulated for the kinematics
analysis. The application of these equations to the mechanisms of Table 5.1
is demonstrated in Sect. 5.4 .
5.1 Joint Variables. Denavit-Hartenberg Parameters
A single-loop mechanism with n bodies has n joints (4 ≤n ≤7). Bodies as
well as joints are labeled from 1 to n in such a way that the joint axes i
and i + 1 are located on body i (i = 1, . . . , n cyclic). Figure 5.1 shows the
bodies i −1 , i and i + 1 together with their joint axes. The most general
case is assumed that the two joint axes of each body are skew. Then the
two joint axes of each body i have a common normal which is ﬁxed on the
respective body i . The joint axis i is, in turn, the common normal of the
thus deﬁned common normals on bodies i−1 and i . On the joint axis i the
dual unit line vector ˆni is deﬁned, and on the common normal of the joint
axes i and i + 1 , i.e., also ﬁxed on body i , the dual unit line vector ˆai is
deﬁned (i = 1, . . . , n).
The unit line vector ˆni+1 is produced from ˆni by a screw displacement
with ˆai being the screw axis. As shown in Fig. 5.1 the rotation angle about
the screw axis is called αi and the translation along the screw axis is called
ℓi . These two constants (positive or negative) are the only kinematical pa-
rameters of body i . Together they deﬁne the constant dual screw angle
ˆαi = αi + εℓi .
(5.2)
In the same way the unit line vector ˆai is produced from ˆai−1 by a screw
displacement with the screw axis ˆni and with a dual screw angle
ˆϕi = ϕi + εhi .
(5.3)
Figure 5.1 shows also ϕi and hi . In a cylindrical joint ϕi and hi are joint
variables. In a revolute joint hi is a constant parameter and only ϕi is vari-
able. In a prismatic joint ϕi is a constant parameter and hi is variable. The
constant hi in a revolute joint is referred to as oﬀset. The 4n quantities
αi , ℓi , ϕi , hi (i = 1, . . . , n) are the so-called Denavit-Hartenberg parame-
ters of the mechanism (see Denavit/Hartenberg [3]). Seven among them are
variables, and 4n −7 are constant system parameters. The number of con-

162
5 Spatial Simple Closed Chains
Fig. 5.1 Bodies i−1 , i and i+1 with joint axes. Dual unit line vectors, body parameters
and joint variables
stant system parameters ranges between nine for the mechanism RCCC and
twenty-one for all mechanisms with n = 7 .
The n line vectors hiˆni and the n line vectors ℓiˆai (i = 1, . . . , n) create
a mobile spatial polygon with right angles at every corner. Analyzing the
mechanism means analyzing this polygon.
The assumption that consecutive joint axes i and i + 1 are skew can
now be dropped. If they intersect, then ℓi = 0 , ˆαi = αi , and the unit line
vector ˆai is along the common normal of the joint axes through their point
of intersection. If the axes of three consecutive revolutes i −1 , i and i + 1
intersect at a single point, these axes are equivalent to a spherical joint S
located at this point. Example: The mechanism RRSRR is a special case of
the mechanism 7R .
If two consecutive joint axes i and i + 1 are parallel, then αi = 0 . The
common normal to the joint axes can be placed such that either hi = 0 or
hi+1 = 0 .
5.2 Screw Displacements. Coordinate Transformations
This section is devoted to screw displacements in the mobile spatial poly-
gon spanned be the line vectors hiˆni and ℓiˆai (i = 1, . . . , n). The screw
displacements relating ˆni to ˆni+1 and ˆai+1 to ˆai are described by the
equations
ˆni+1 = ˆni cos ˆαi+ˆai×ˆni sin ˆαi ,
ˆai = ˆai−1 cos ˆϕi+ˆni×ˆai−1 sin ˆϕi . (5.4)
This is the dualized form of (1.125) which describes the rotation shown in
Fig. 1.5 . For a more compact formulation the following abbreviations are
introduced:

ˆSi = sin ˆαi ,
ˆci = cos ˆϕi ,
ˆsi = sin ˆϕi
(5.5)
(i = 1, . . . , n cyclic) . The equations then read (in the second equation all
indices are increased by one):
ˆni+1 = ˆCiˆni + ˆSiˆai × ˆni ,
ˆai+1 = ˆci+1ˆai + ˆsi+1ˆni+1 × ˆai
(5.6)
(i = 1, . . . , n cyclic) . On an indeterminate body k of the mechanism a dual
cartesian basis is deﬁned with unit basis vectors
ˆe1 = ˆnk ,
ˆe2 = ˆak ,
ˆe3 = ˆnk × ˆak .
(5.7)
Equations (5.6) constitute two-step recursion formulas for the coordinate
decomposition of all vectors ˆnk+j and ˆak+j (j = 1, 2, . . .) in this basis.
From ˆak and ˆnk+1
ˆak+1 = ˆck+1ˆak + ˆsk+1( ˆCkˆnk + ˆSkˆak × ˆnk) × ˆak
= ˆsk+1 ˆSkˆnk + ˆck+1ˆak + ˆsk+1 ˆCkˆnk × ˆak .
(5.8)
From ˆak+1 and ˆnk+1
ˆnk+2 = ˆCk+1ˆnk+1 + ˆSk+1ˆak+1 × ˆnk+1
= ( ˆCk+1 ˆCk −ˆSk+1 ˆSkˆck+1)ˆnk + ˆSk+1ˆsk+1ˆak
−( ˆCk+1 ˆSk + ˆSk+1 ˆCkˆck+1)ˆnk × ˆak .
(5.9)
In the next step ˆak+2 and ˆnk+3 are calculated by increasing in (5.8) and
(5.9) all indices by one and by substituting for ˆak+1 and ˆnk+2 the previous
formulas. Formulas for ˆnk+4 and ˆak+4 are obtained with the least eﬀort
if in the expressions for ˆnk+2 and ˆak+2 all indices are increased by two.
Example:
ˆnk+4 =
( ˆCk+3 ˆCk+2 −ˆSk+3 ˆSk+2ˆck+3)ˆnk+2 + ˆSk+3ˆsk+3ˆak+2
−( ˆCk+3 ˆSk+2 + ˆSk+3 ˆCk+2ˆck+3)ˆnk+2 × ˆak+2 .
(5.10)
Into this expression the previously obtained expressions for ˆnk+2 and ˆak+2
are substituted. Every expression thus obtained is linear with respect to every
sine and to every cosine involved. Products sine × cosine of one and the same
angle do not appear.
From the coordinates of the vectors ˆnk+j and ˆak+j (j arbitrary) in the
basis (5.7) the coordinates of ˆnk−j and ˆak−j are obtained by a change
of symbols. This is shown as follows. Inversion of the relationships (5.4) is
achieved by reversing the sign of the dual angle:
ˆni = ˆni+1 cos ˆαi −ˆai × ˆni+1 sin ˆαi ,
ˆai−1 = ˆai cos ˆϕi −ˆni × ˆai sin ˆϕi .
(5.11)

With (5.5) these are the equations (in the ﬁrst equation all indices are de-
creased by one)
ˆni−1 = ˆCi−1ˆni −ˆSi−1ˆai−1 × ˆni ,
ˆai−1 = ˆciˆai −ˆsiˆni × ˆai .
(5.12)
Comparison with (5.6) reveals: For arbitrary j the coordinates of ˆnk+j in
the basis (5.7) become those of ˆak−j and vice versa if (i) ˆe1 and ˆe2 are
interchanged, (ii) j is replaced by −j and (iii) ˆα and ˆϕ are interchanged.
Table 5.2 contains the coordinates of all vectors ˆnk±j and ˆak±j (k arbi-
trary; j = 0, 1, 2, 3) and of ˆnk+4 and ˆak−4 . The table is used for calculating
sums and products of vectors. It greatly simpliﬁes the kinematics analysis
of simple closed chains in this chapter. In Chap. 6 it is applied to overcon-
strained closed chains and in Chap. 7 to serial chains. When the symbol ˆ
is deleted everywhere, the table gives the coordinates of ﬁrst Pl¨ucker vectors
nk±j and ak±j .

5.3 Closure Conditions
Having deﬁned variables and parameters and having established basic rela-
tionships in the mobile spatial polygon of vectors hiˆni + ℓiˆai (i = 1, . . . , n)
we can ﬁnally turn to the kinematics problem of this chapter: Determine six
dependent variables of a single-loop mechanism in terms of a single indepen-
dent variable. For this purpose six scalar equations relating the altogether
seven variables are required. Any such equation is called closure condition
because it expresses the closure of the kinematical loop. Closure conditions
are highly nonlinear. Therefore, it is not useful to formulate six fully coupled
equations. It is essential to formulate a set of m < 6 equations for m un-
knowns with m being as small as possible. Once these equations are solved
for the m unknowns it is simple to express the remaining 6 −m unknowns
one by one in terms of previously determined unknowns. In the literature
various methods for formulating closure conditions are found:
Yang [40] – [42], Duﬀy [4] – [8], Duﬀy/Crane [9], Yuan [44], Yuan/Freuden-
stein/Woo [45], [46], Dukkipati/Soni [13], Dukkipati [14], Soni/Pamidi [35],
Soni [36], Lee [20, 27], Lee/Liang [21] – [24], Liang/Lee/Liao [28], Wo-
ernle [39], Lee/Woernle/Hiller [26], Raghavan/Roth [32], Lee/Roth [25],
Nielsen/Roth [30], Crane/Duﬀy [2] and others. Many more references are
found in [15]. An historical overview is found in Peisach [31].
In what follows, methods developed by Woernle [39] and Lee [27] are used.
They lead to a minimal set of either m = 1 or m = 2 or m = 4 coupled
equations depending on the type of mechanism. The formulations presented
appeared in Wittenburg [47].
5.3.1 Woernle-Lee Equations
Figure 5.2 shows schematically the polygon of dual-vectors of a single-loop
mechanism. Actually, only the vectors associated with two speciﬁc joints
labeled a and b are shown. The rest of the polygon is indicated by dashed
lines. How to choose the joints a and b is explained later. These joints
divide the mechanism into a left segment and a right segment. The ordinary
vector r shown in the ﬁgure joins the axes a and b . This vector has two
representations. One as a sum of vectors ﬁxed on bodies of the left segment
and one as a sum of vectors ﬁxed on bodies of the right segment. The vectors
are the primary parts of dual vectors. The two representations are
r =
"−(hbnb + ℓbab + hb+1nb+1 + . . . + ℓa−1aa−1) (left segment)
hana + ℓaaa + ha+1na+1 + . . . + ℓb−1ab−1
(right segment) .

Fig. 5.2 Segments of a mechanism deﬁned by two joints a and b
In the particular case b = a + 1 the joints a and b are direct neighbors. In
this case, the vector r in the right segment is r = hana + ℓaaa . If the axes
a and a + 1 are nonparallel, then aa = (1/Sa)(na × na+1) (see Fig. 5.2). In
this case, (5.13) has the special form
r =
⎧
⎨

−(ha+1na+1 + ℓa+1aa+1 + . . . + ℓa−1aa−1)
(left segment)
hana + ℓa
Sa
(na × na+1)
(right segment) .
(5.14)
In terms of na , nb and r seven scalar quantities F1, . . . , F7 are deﬁned as
follows:
F1 = na · nb ,
F2 = r · na × nb ,
F3 = na · r ,
F4 = nb · r ,
F5 = r · np × nq
(r from (5.14); p ̸= q arbitrary) ,
F6 = r2 ,
F7 = 1

(5.15)
The scalars F1 and F2 represent the primary part and the dual part, re-
spectively, of the dual scalar product ˆna · ˆnb . The primary part is calculated
with coordinates from Table 5.2 (without the symbol ˆ ). The dual part is
calculated not as product r·na×nb , but as dual derivative of F1 (see (3.50)).
The MAPLE software tool developed by Sinigersky [34] has special routines
for switching back and forth between the ordinary notation cos α , sin α ,
cos ϕ , sin ϕ and the short-hand notation C, S, c, s . Dual diﬀerentiation is
carried out automatically. By combining Table 5.2 with this tool kinematics
equations for mechanisms can be formulated semi-automatically.
Each of the scalar quantities F1, . . . , F7 is expressed in the left segment as
function of variables and in the right segment as another function of variables.
These functions are called F ℓ
k and F r
k (k = 1, . . . , 7). The equality of both
scalars establishes the seven Woernle-Lee equations
F ℓ
k = F r
k
(k = 1, . . . , 7) .
(5.16)
5.3 Closure Conditions
167

These equations have properties which make them useful as closure condi-
tions. The most important properties are the following:
- the parameters ϕa and ϕb do not appear explicitly in any of the equations
F ℓ
k = F r
k
(k = 1, . . . , 7). This is a consequence of the fact that each of the
vectors na and nb is ﬁxed on a body of the left segment and also ﬁxed on
a body of the right segment
- the parameters ha and hb do not appear explicitly in the equation
F ℓ
2 = F r
2 . This is a consequence of the fact that this equation is the dual
derivative of the equation F ℓ
1 = F r
1 .
From these properties the following criteria for choosing the joints a and
b are derived. The joint combination ab is
- CC in mechanisms with two or three cylindrical joints (rows 1, 2, 5 of Table
5.1)
- CR in mechanisms with one cylindrical joint (rows 3, 6, 8 )
- RR in all other mechanisms
- the angles ϕa and ϕb must be dependent variables.
This choice of joints has the consequence that the maximum possible num-
ber of dependent variables is eliminated from the equations. The properties
of the equations F ℓ
1 = F r
1 and F ℓ
2 = F r
2 can now be stated in more detail as
follows. The equation F ℓ
1 = F r
1 is an equation in terms of angular Denavit-
Hartenberg parameters only. Every sine and every cosine appears in linear
form only. Products sine × cosine of one and the same angle do not appear.
The independent variable is either the angle in a speciﬁc revolute joint or
the translatory variable in a speciﬁc prismatic joint. Until further below it is
assumed to be an angle. The mechanisms in Table 5.1 have a total number
nϕ of angular variables in the range 4 ≤nϕ ≤7 . With one of them being
independent and with ϕa and ϕb being eliminated the equation F ℓ
1 = F r
1
is an equation for 1 ≤nϕ −3 ≤4 unknown angular variables.
Unknowns in the equation F ℓ
2 = F r
2 are the same nϕ−3 angular variables
and, in addition, ν translatory variables. The number ν is the diﬀerence
between the total number nt = nC + nP of translatory variables and the
number of cylindrical joints among the joints a and b . This formula yields
ν = 1 for the mechanism RCCC and ν = nP for all other mechanisms.
Table 5.1 shows that ν is in the range 0 ≤ν ≤3 . The translatory variables
and the sines and cosines of angular variables appear in linear form only.
The mechanisms in rows 5 , 8 and 10 of Table 5.1 have angular variables
only (ν = 0). For these mechanisms the equation F ℓ
2 = F r
2 has, with other
coeﬃcients, the same form as the equation F ℓ
1 = F r
1 .
Let b be the larger of the indices a and b so that 1 ≤a < b ≤n and
b = a+d with d > 0 . Because of the cyclic repetition of the indices 1, . . . , n
the identity holds: b ≡b −n = a + d −n . With this identity the equation
F ℓ
1 = F r
1 is written in the form
nk · nk+d = nk · nk+d−n
(k = a) .
(5.17)
168
5 Spatial Simple Closed Chains

Example: In the case a = 3 , b = 6 , n = 7 , the equation is nk · nk+3 =
nk · nk−4 with k = 3 . The product nk · nk+3 is found in Table 5.2 as ﬁrst
coordinate of the vector nk+3 with k = 3 . It is a function of ϕ4 and ϕ5 . For
the product nk · nk−4 the vector nk−4 is not found in the table. The table
suﬃces, however, because the product has the alternative form nk−2 · nk+2
with k = 1 . It is a function of ϕk−1 = ϕ0 ≡ϕ7 , ϕk = ϕ1 and ϕk+1 = ϕ2 .
For details see the right-hand side of (5.82). End of example.
Mechanisms with nϕ = 4 : Let ϕ1 and ϕλ be the independent and the
dependent angular variable, respectively. The equation F ℓ
1 = F r
1 is
Acλ + Bsλ = R .
(5.18)
The coeﬃcients A , B and R are functions of ϕ1 . For every value of ϕ1 the
equation has two (not necessarily real) solutions ϕλ . This is an important
result. It means that the mechanisms in rows 1 to 4 of Table 5.1 have two
diﬀerent conﬁgurations for every value of the independent angular variable.
This is the number Nϕ shown in Table 5.1 .
Dual diﬀerentiation of (5.18) produces the equation F ℓ
2 = F r
2 :
(A′ + hλB)cλ + (B′ −hλA)sλ = R′ ,
(5.19)
where A′, B′, R′ are the dual derivatives of A , of B and of R , respectively.
Since ϕλ is known from (5.18), this equation is a linear equation for ν = 1
or 2 or 3 translatory variables. The mechanisms in rows 1 and 2 of Table
5.1 with ν = 1 are the simplest mechanisms. Equation (5.19) determines the
single translatory variable. For the mechanism RCCC this is shown in detail
in Sect. 5.4.1 .
Mechanisms with nϕ = 5 : These are the mechanisms in rows 5 , 6 and 7
of Table 5.1 . Let ϕλ and ϕμ be the two dependent angular variables. The
equation F ℓ
1 = F r
1 has either the form
A2cλ + B2sλ = A1cμ + B1sμ + R1
(5.20)
or the form
A [ cλcμ
cλsμ
cλ
sλcμ
sλsμ
sλ
cμ
sμ
1 ]T = 0 .
(5.21)
The coeﬃcients A1 , B1 , R1 , A2 , B2 and the row matrix A are functions of
the independent variable. Equation (5.20) occurs if the joints λ and μ belong
to diﬀerent segments created by the cylindrical joints, and (5.21) occurs if
they belong to one and the same segment.
Unknowns in the equation F ℓ
2 = F r
2 are the same angles ϕλ and ϕμ and,
in addition, ν = 0 or 1 or 2 translatory variables. For the mechanisms
RCRCR and CRRRC with ν = 0 the equations F ℓ
2 = F r
2 and F ℓ
1 = F r
1
5.3 Closure Conditions
169

have identical forms, i.e., either the form (5.20) or the form (5.21). Both
equations together determine ϕλ and ϕμ . Details see in Sect. 5.4.2 .
The mechanisms in rows 6 and 7 of Table 5.1 : It will be seen that the
equation F ℓ
5 = F r
5 has the form (5.21) for the same unknowns ϕλ and ϕμ .
Thus, all mechanisms with nϕ = 5 are governed either by two Eqs.(5.20) or
by two Eqs.(5.21). Once the two unknowns ϕλ and ϕμ are determined the
equation F ℓ
2 = F r
2 represents a linear equation for ν = 1 or ν = 2 unknown
translatory variables.
Mechanisms with nϕ = 6 : The only mechanisms of this type are the mech-
anisms 5R-C and 6R-P . The joints a and b (a cylindrical and a revolute
joint or two revolute joints) are chosen such that two dependent angular vari-
ables are in one segment and the third dependent angular variable together
with the independent variable is in the other. Let ϕλ , ϕμ and ϕν be the
dependent variables. The matrix form of the equation F ℓ
1 = F r
1 is
A [ cν
sν ]T = B [ cλcμ
cλsμ
cλ
sλcμ
sλsμ

(5.22)
The row matrices A and B are either constant or functions of the indepen-
dent variable. The equation F ℓ
2 = F r
2 for the mechanism 5R-C has the same
form with other coeﬃcient matrices A and B .
In the equation F ℓ
2 = F r
2 for a mechanism 6R-P the unknown translatory
variable of the prismatic joint appears in addition to the three unknown
angular variables. If this translatory variable is called hκ , the equation has
the form
A [ cν

hκsν
hκ ]T
= B [ cλcμ
cλsμ

(5.23)
Mechanisms with nϕ = 7 : The only mechanism of this type is the mechanism
7R . The joints a and b are chosen such that two dependent angular variables
are in each segment. Let ϕ7 be the independent variable. Then a = 3 , b =
6 is a possible choice. The four dependent variables are ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ4 and
ϕ5 . The equation F ℓ
1 = F r
1 is known already from the example given for
Eq.(5.17). Its matrix form is
A [ c4c5

s5 ]T
= B [ c1c2

(5.24)
The row matrix A is constant, and B is a function of ϕ7 . The equation
F ℓ
2 = F r
2 has the same form with other coeﬃcient matrices A and B . Details
see in Sect. 5.4.7 .
The equations F ℓ
3 = F r
3 and F ℓ
4 = F r
4
Unknowns in these equations are the same 1 ≤nϕ −3 ≤4 angular variables
which appear in the equations F ℓ
1 = F r
1
and F ℓ
2 = F r
2
and, in addition,
170
5 Spatial Simple Closed Chains

all translatory variables including ha and hb (constant parameter or vari-
able). In the equations for the mechanisms in rows 3 , 4 , 8 and 9 the total
number of variables is four, so that these two equations together with the
equations F ℓ
1 = F r
1 and F ℓ
2 = F r
2 represent a system of four equations for
four unknowns.
The mechanisms in rows 3 and 4 : The equation F ℓ
1 = F r
1 is Eq.(5.18).
With each of its two solutions the other three equations are coupled linear
equations for three unknown translatory variables.
The mechanisms 5R-C and 6R-P : Unknowns are three angular and one
translatory variable. The equations F ℓ
3 = F r
3 and F ℓ
4 = F r
4 have the form
(5.23), and the equations F ℓ
1 = F r
1 and F ℓ
2 = F r
2 have the form (5.22).
The mechanism 7R : The four unknowns are angular variables. The four
equations F ℓ
k = F r
k
(k = 1, 2, 3, 4) have the form (5.24).
The equation F ℓ
5 = F r
5
This equation is formulated only for the mechanisms in rows 6 and 7 of Table
5.1 . These mechanisms have nϕ = 5 angular variables and either n = 6
joints with one cylindrical and one prismatic joint or n = 7 joints with two
prismatic joints. These joints are the only ones with translatory variables.
They are chosen as joints p and q in the expression F5 = r · np × nq . With
(5.14) for r the equation F ℓ
5 = F r
5 is
−(ha+1na+1 + ℓa+1aa+1 + . . . + ℓa−1aa−1 + hana) · (np × nq)
= ℓa
Sa
(na × na+1) · (np × nq)
= ℓa
Sa
[(na × np) · (na+1 × nq) −(na × nq) · (na+1 × np)] .
(5.25)
The vectors hpnp and hqnq are among the vectors indicated by dots. Mul-
tiplication with (np × nq) eliminates the variables hp and hq . The angular
variables in the joints a and a + 1 are eliminated as well. This means that
only two dependent angular variables appear explicitly. Let them be denoted
ϕλ and ϕμ . Then the equation has the form
A [ cλcμ
cλsμ
cλ
sλcμ
sλsμ
sλ
cμ
sμ
1 ]T = 0 .
(5.26)
This is, with a diﬀerent coeﬃcient matrix A , the form of the equation F ℓ
1 =
F r
1 (see (5.21)). In both equations the unknowns ϕλ and ϕμ are the same
if the joints a and b = a + 1 are the same.
It remains to be shown how to generate the coeﬃcient matrix A in (5.26)
with the help of Table 5.2 . First, the left-hand side of (5.25) is considered.
It is a linear combination of products nℓ· np × nq
(ℓ̸= p, q arbitrary)
and aℓ· np × nq
(ℓ̸= a arbitrary). Every product is evaluated as (3 ×
3)-determinant of vector coordinates copied from Table 5.2 . The goal is to
formulate the determinant such that the angles ϕa and ϕa+1 do not appear
5.3 Closure Conditions
171

explicitly, and that sλ , cλ , sμ , cμ appear in linear form only. This goal is
achieved if the determinant is evaluated in three steps as follows.
Step 1 : To those of the indices ℓ, p and q which are smaller than or
equal to a the number n is added (n = 6 or n = 7). The new indices are
called ℓ′ , p′ and q′ .
Step 2 : The new indices ℓ′ , p′ and q′ are brought into a monotonically
increasing order. One of them is the central index. To this index the name k
is given. The other two indices are k −d1 and k + d2 with d1, d2 ≥0 .
Step 3 : The rows of the (3 × 3)-determinant are the coordinates of the
vectors with indices k , k−d1 and k+d2 . These coordinates are copied from
Table 5.2 . The vector with the index k is either nk with the coordinates
[ 1
0
0 ] or ak with the coordinates [ 0
1
0 ] . With either one of these
forms the determinant is reduced to a (2 × 2)-determinant. The coordinates
of the vectors with indices k −d1 and k + d2 are linear with respect to
cλ , sλ , cμ and sμ . The variables ϕa and ϕa+1 do not appear.
Example: For a mechanism with n = 7 joints the product a1 · n5 × n6 is
to be expressed such that the variables ϕa and ϕa+1 with a = 4 do not
appear explicitly.
Solution: The given indices are ℓ= 1 < a , p = 5 > a and q = 6 > a .
Hence ℓ′ = ℓ+ n = 8 , p′ = 5 , q′ = 6 . The desired form of the product is

End of example.
For the left-hand side expression of (5.25) considered so far the desired
form (free of ϕa and ϕa+1 and linear in the sines and cosines of the remaining
three angles) is possible no matter which angle is chosen as ϕa . For the right-
hand side expression this choice is not arbitrary. For both sides the angle
dictated by the right-hand side is chosen. The rule for choosing joint a is
explained, ﬁrst, for the mechanisms in row 6 with one prismatic joint and
one cylindrical joint. Let the cylindrical joint be joint q . One of the joints a
and a + 1 must be the cylindrical joint q , and the other must be a revolute
joint with a dependent angular variable. This allocation is possible no matter
in which revolute joint the independent variable is located. In the case a = q ,
the right-hand side of (5.25) is
ℓa

(Canp · nq −np · na+1) .
(5.28)
In the case a + 1 = q , the right-hand side of (5.25) is

−ℓa
Sa
(Canp · nq −na · np) .
(5.29)
In either case Table 5.2 yields an expression with the desired linearity prop-
erties.
Next, the mechanisms with two prismatic joints p and q are considered.
The joints a and a + 1 must be revolute joints with dependent angular
variables, and one of them must be neighbor of a prismatic joint ( p or q ).
This allocation is possible no matter in which revolute joint the independent
variable is located. Since each of the two prismatic joints can be joint p , it
suﬃces to distinguish whether joint a or joint a + 1 is neighbor of joint p .
If joint a is neighbor of joint p , then a = p + 1 and na × np = −Spap and
na · np = Cp . The right-hand side of (5.25) is
ℓa
Sa
(−Spap · na+1 × nq −Canp · nq + Cpnq · na+1) .
(5.30)
If joint a + 1 is neighbor of joint p , then
p = a + 2 and
na+1 × np =
−Sa+1aa+1 and np · na+1 = Ca+1 . The right-hand side of (5.25) is
ℓa
Sa
(Canp · nq −Ca+1na · nq + na × nq · Sa+1aa+1) .
(5.31)
In either case Table 5.2 yields an expression with the desired linearity prop-
erties. The products ap · na+1 × nq and na × nq · aa+1 are evaluated as
determinants.
The equations F ℓ
6 = F r
6 and F ℓ
7 = F r

These equations are formulated only for the mechanism 7R which has an-
gular variables only. In every scalar product appearing in the expressions for
r2 every sine and every cosine appears in linear form only. Products sine ×
cosine of one and the same angle do not appear. If as joints a and b the
joints 3 and 6 are chosen again, the equation F ℓ
6 = F r
6 has the form (5.24).
Only the coeﬃcient matrices are diﬀerent.
Surprisingly, also the equation F ℓ
7 = F r
7 has the form (5.24) (with other
coeﬃcient matrices). In spite of the deﬁnition F7 = 1
2F1F6 −F3F4 the func-
tions F ℓ
7 and F r
7 are both linear with respect to the sines and cosines of
angles. For the function F r
7 this is proved as follows. With (5.13) for r the
function F r
7 is a linear combination of products hihj , hiℓj and ℓiℓj with
a ≤i, j ≤b . As an example the coeﬃcient of hihj with i ≤j is considered.
This coeﬃcient denoted Hij is
Hij = (na · nb)(ni · nj) −(na · ni)(nb · nj) −(na · nj)(nb · ni)
(5.32)
= (na × ni) · (nb × nj) −(na · ni)(nb · nj)
(a ≤i ≤j ≤b) .
(5.33)
The products (na ×ni) and (na ·ni) are linear with respect to the sines and
cosines of angles between bodies a and i , and the products (nb × nj) and
5.3 Closure Conditions
173

(nb · nj) are linear with respect to the sines and cosines of angles between
bodies b and j . From this follows the linearity of Hij with respect to the
sines and cosines of all angles. For other terms of F r
7 and for F ℓ
7 similar
arguments hold. End of proof.
The discussion of Woernle-Lee equations is summarized as follows.
Mechanisms in rows 1 and 2 of Table 5.1 : The equations with F1 and F2
are formulated. They have the forms (5.18) and (5.19). The ﬁrst equation
determines two solutions for a single unknown angle ϕλ . With each solution
the second equation is a linear equation for a single translatory variable.
Mechanisms in rows 3 and 4 : The equations with F1 , F2 , F3 and F4 are
formulated. The ﬁrst equation is Eq.(5.18). It determines two solutions for a
single unknown angle ϕλ . With each solution the remaining three equations
are linear equations for three unknown translatory variables.
Mechanisms in rows 5 , 6, 7 : Two equations are formulated. These are the
equations with F1 and F2 for the mechanisms in row 5 and the equations
with F1 and F5 for the mechanisms in rows 6 and 7 . Both equations
have either the form (5.20) or the form (5.21). These equations are easily
decoupled. Methods of solution see in Sect. 5.4.3 .
Mechanisms 5R-C , 6R-P and 7R : The four equations with F1 , F2 , F3
and F4 determine four unknowns. Without additional equations of another
mathematical form it is impossible to decouple these equations. The necessary
additional equations are the half-angle equations introduced further below.
Up to this point the independent variable was the angle of an arbitrarily
chosen revolute joint. In what follows, it is the translatory variable in an
arbitrarily chosen prismatic joint. This change has the eﬀect that in each
of the seven Woernle-Lee equations the number of unknown angular vari-
ables increases by one whereas the number of unknown translatory variables
decreases by one. The two numbers of unknowns are 2 ≤nϕ −2 ≤4 and
0 ≤nP−1 ≤2 . For the mechanisms of Table 5.1 this change has the following
eﬀect.
For the mechanisms in rows 2 , 3 and 4 the same equations are formulated
which are formulated for the mechanisms in rows 5 , 6 , 7 with an independent
angular variable. These are the equations with F1 and F2 for the mechanisms
in row 2 and the equations with F1 and F5 for the mechanisms in rows 3
and 4 . Both equations have either the form (5.20) or the form (5.21).
For the mechanisms in rows 6 , 7 and 9 the four equations with F1 , F2 , F3
and F4 determine four unknowns. For the mechanisms in row 6 they are
the same equations which govern the mechanism 5R-C with an independent
angular variable. For the mechanisms in row 7 they are the same equations
which govern the mechanism 6R-P with an independent angular variable.
174
5 Spatial Simple Closed Chains

For the mechanism 6R-P they are the same equations which govern the
mechanism 7R with an independent angular variable. These relationships
were predicted when Table 5.1 was introduced.
5.3.2 Half-Angle Equations
These equations were ﬁrst formulated by Lee [27]. Again, Fig. 5.2 is consid-
ered. The ordinary unit vectors nb , ab und nb × ab form an orthogonal
cartesian basis ﬁxed on body b , and the unit vectors nb , ab−1 , nb × ab−1
form another basis ﬁxed on body b −1 . Temporarily, the abbreviations are
used:
db = nb × ab ,
d∗
b−1 = nb × ab−1 .
(5.34)
The two bases are rotated against each other through the angle ϕb about
the common axis nb . Let v be an arbitrary vector. Its coordinates in the
two bases are related through the matrix equation

(5.35)
The new variable xb = tan ϕb/2 is deﬁned. The expressions cos ϕb = (1 −
x2
b)/(1 + x2
b) and sin ϕb = 2xb/(1 + x2
b) are substituted into (5.35). In order
to avoid the quadratic term x2
b the equation is premultiplied by the matrix
⎡
⎣

is linear with respect to xb :

5.3 Closure Conditions

v1 = na ,
v2 = r ,
v3 = na×r ,
v4 = 1
2 r2na−(na·r)r . (5.38)
The vectors na and r are the ones shown in Fig. 5.2 and in (5.13). In what
follows, it is important that −hbnb is part of r in the left segment, and that
hana is part of r in the right segment.
The scalar products vi · ab and vi · nb × ab on the left-hand side of the
equations are evaluated in the left segment, and the scalar products vi ·ab−1
and vi · nb × ab−1 on the right-hand side of the equations are evaluated in
the right segment. With every vector vi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) the vector products
in (5.37) are linear with respect to the sines and cosines of all angles involved.
The expressions for r in (5.13) allow the following conclusions (note that
the vector nb ×ab is ﬁxed on body b , and that the vector nb ×ab−1 is ﬁxed
on body b −1 ):
1. With all vectors vi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) all scalar products are independent
of both ϕa and ϕb .
2. The angle ϕb appears in every equation, however, only in the form
xb = tan ϕb/2 .
3. With vi = v1 only angular variables appear.
4. With vi = v2 all scalar products are independent of hb . In the products
on the right-hand side ha occurs in linear form.
5. With vi = v3 all scalar products are independent of ha . In the products
on the left-hand side hb occurs in linear form.
6. With vi = v4 both ha and hb occur in ﬁrst and second-order terms.
These equations are formulated only for the mechanism 7R in which the
parameters h1, . . . , h7 are constant.
For the evaluation of products in (5.37) Table 5.2 is used. The following
facts are helpful. The vector nb × ab ﬁxed on body b has the coordinates
[0 0 1]T in the basis of body b . The vector nb × ab−1 ﬁxed on body b −1
has the coordinates [Cb−1 0 −Sb−1]T in the basis of body b −1 .
The product v3 · ab is formulated with r = r + hbnb −hbnb :
v3 · ab = −[(r + hbnb) × na · ab + hbna · nb × ab] .
(5.39)
In the second term the previously given coordinates of nb × ab are used. In
the ﬁrst term the vector r + hbnb joins the dual vectors ˆna and ˆab (see
Fig. 5.2). From this it follows that the ﬁrst term represents the dual part of
ˆna · ˆab . It is calculated as dual derivative of na · ab . Similarly,
v3 · ab−1 = −r × na · ab−1 = −(dual derivative of na · ab−1 ) .

5.4 Systematic Analysis of Mechanisms
The previous section provided equations which are suﬃcient for the analysis
of all mechanisms of Table 5.1 . In the present section methods for decou-
pling these equations are presented. For each type of mechanism a polyno-
mial equation of minimal order is developed for a single unknown variable.
This minimal order is the maximum number of conﬁgurations the mechanism
under consideration can have for a given value of the independent variable.
In these analyses all constant Denavit-Hartenberg parameters are assumed
to be nonzero and arbitrary. As special cases a 7R-mechanism with three
parallel joint axes and a 7R-mechanism with a spherical joint are analyzed.
5.4.1 RCCC
This is the simplest of all mechanisms listed in Table 5.1 . It has the smallest
number of joints (n = 4) and the smallest number of constant parameters
(4n −7 = 9) . Figure 5.3 shows schematically the mobile polygon with unit
vectors ni and ai (i = 1, 2, 3, 4). The vectors are uniformly directed counter-
clockwise. Joint 1 represents the revolute joint. The variable ϕ1 in this joint
is the independent variable. The six dependent variables are the quantities
ϕi , hi in the cylindrical joints i = 2, 3, 4 . The nine constant parameters are
h1 in joint 1 and the quantities αi , ℓi of bodies i = 1, 2, 3, 4 .
General remarks on vector polygons of mechanisms: A mechanism with n
joints has a polygon with 2n sides. It can be drawn schematically as a regular
2n-gon with all unit vectors ni and ai (i = 1, . . . , n) pointing counter-
clockwise. A regular 2n-gon has 2n axes of symmetry. Any closure condition
formulated for a speciﬁc mechanism remains valid if the labels of its constant
and variable Denavit-Hartenberg parameters are changed according to the
Fig. 5.3 Mechanism RCCC . Polygon with unit vectors ni , ai and Denavit-Hartenberg
parameters αi , ℓi , ϕi , hi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4). Joint 1 is the revolute with the independent
variable ϕ1 . The dashed line of symmetry
177
5.4 Systematic Analysis of Mechanisms

symmetry. Symmetry is particularly useful if symmetrically located joints
are of equal type, i.e., CC or RR or PP. In Fig. 5.3 this is the case for the
dashed line of symmetry. Closure conditions remain valid if the quantities
(α1 , ℓ1 , ϕ2 , h2 , α2 , ℓ2) are replaced by (α4 , ℓ4 , ϕ4 , h4 , α3 , ℓ3) and vice
versa. Not every mechanism has such an axis of symmetry, for example not
the mechanism RCPRC .
Also the following is true. Any closure condition formulated for a spe-
ciﬁc mechanism remains valid if the labels of its constant and variable
Denavit-Hartenberg parameters are cyclicly increased by an arbitrary inte-
ger λ (±1, ±2, . . .) . This means that the two joints a and b on which the
closure condition is founded are replaced by the joints a + λ and b + λ ,
respectively. A cyclic rotation of labels by an integer λ is equivalent to a
symmetry change of labels if the joints a + λ and b + λ are located sym-
metrically to the joints b and a , respectively. Cyclic rotation of labels and
symmetry changes of labels are much simpler than re-formulations of closure
conditions for new joints a and b .
Now back to the mechanism RCCC . Among the three cylindrical joints 2 ,
3 and 4 any two can be chosen as joints a and b . For each pair Eqs.(5.18)
and (5.19) are formulated. The unknowns in these equations are the two
variables of the third cylindrical joint. The ﬁrst equation is the Woernle-
Lee Eq.(5.17). It is given for only two joint combinations because any other
combination is produced by a cyclic change of indices.
joint combination a = 2 , b = 3 :
nk · nk−3 = nk · nk+1
joint combination a = 2 , b = 4 :
nk · nk−2 = nk · nk+2
 
k = a . (5.41)
For the joint combination a = 2 , b = 3 Table 5.2 yields the equation
S3[s4s1S1 −c4(S4C1 + C4S1c1)] + C3(C4C1 −S4S1c1) = C2 .
(5.42)
This is Eq.(5.18) for ϕ4 :
Ac4 + Bs4 = R .
(5.43)
The coeﬃcients depend on ϕ1 :
A = −S3(S4C1 + C4S1c1) ,
B = S1S3s1 ,
R = C2 −C3(C4C1 −S4S1c1) .
 
(5.44)
Dual diﬀerentiation of (5.43) yields Eq.(5.19) for h4 :
h4(Bc4 −As4) = Dc4 + Es4 + F .
(5.45)
The coeﬃcients D , E and F are the dual derivatives of −A , −B and R ,
respectively:

(5.46)
For every value of ϕ1 Eq.(5.43) has two (not necessarily real) solutions ϕ4 .
The associated solutions h4 are determined by (5.45).
Next, equations for ϕ2 and h2 are produced. This is done by increasing
all indices in (5.43) and (5.44) cyclicly by one. Equation (5.43) is replaced by
the equation
S4[s1s2S2 −c1(S1C2 + C1S2c2)] + C4(C1C2 −S1S2c2) = C3 .
(5.47)
This is the equation for ϕ2 :
A∗c2 + B∗s2 = R∗,
(5.48)
A∗= −S2(S1C4 + C1S4c1) ,
B∗= S4S2s1 ,
R∗= C3 −C2(C4C1 −S4S1c1) .
 
(5.49)
The cyclic change of indices in (5.45) and (5.46) is left to the reader. Next,
ϕ3 is determined from (5.41) for the joint combination a = 2 , b = 4 . Table
5.2 yields the equation
C3C2 −S3S2c3 = C1C4 −S1S4c1 .
(5.50)
It displays the symmetry of Fig. 5.3 . It determines c3 as a linear function
of c1 . Every value of ϕ1 yields two solutions ±ϕ3 . Dual diﬀerentiation of
(5.50) produces for h3 the formula
h3S2S3s3 = h1S1S4s1 + c3(ℓ2C2S3 + ℓ3S2C3) + (ℓ2S2C3 + ℓ3C2S3)
−c1(ℓ1C1S4 + ℓ4S1C4) −(ℓ1S1C4 + ℓ4C1S4) . (5.51)
If h3 is the solution associated with +ϕ3 , −h3 is the solution associated
with −ϕ3 .
The analysis is now complete except for one open problem. For every
value of ϕ1 there exist two solutions (ϕ2, h2) , two solutions (ϕ3, h3) and
two solutions (ϕ4, h4) . What remains to be shown is which of the solutions
ϕ2, ϕ4 occur together with +ϕ3 and which with −ϕ3 . For solving this
problem two closure conditions are needed relating ϕ3 to ϕ4 and ϕ3 to ϕ2 ,
respectively. They are obtained by increasing the indices in (5.43) by two and
by three, respectively. This produces the equations
S1[s2s3S3 −c2(S2C3 + C3S3c3)] + C1(C2C3 −S2S3c3) = C4 ,
(5.52)
5.4 Systematic Analysis of Mechanisms
179

S2[s3s4S4 −c3(S3C4 + C3S4c4)] + C2(C3C4 −S3S4c4) = C1 .
(5.53)
The relationship between ϕ4 and ϕ2 is obtained more easily from (5.50) by
a cyclic increase of indices by one:
C4C3 −S4S3c4 = C2C1 −S2S1c2 .
(5.54)
Any two of these equations determine whether numerically calculated angles
ϕ4 and ϕ2 belong to +ϕ3 or to −ϕ3 .
Special Cases: Bennett Mechanism and Spherical Four-Bar
Under certain conditions on the nine constant Denavit-Hartenberg parame-
ters ℓ1 , . . . , ℓ4 , α1 , . . . , α4 and h1 of the mechanism RCCC the translatory
variables h2 , h3 , h4 are constant (actually identically zero) independent of
the angle ϕ1 . This means that the mechanism has four revolute joints and,
yet, a single degree of freedom. It is an overconstrained mechanism. There are
two such special mechanisms. One of them is called Bennett mechanism. It is
the subject of Sect. 6.2 . The other is the spherical four-bar with four revolute
joints the axes of which intersect at a single point. Intersection means that
the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters ℓ1, . . . , ℓ4 and h1 are zero. Equations
(5.46) yield D = E = F ≡0 and with this, (5.45) yields h4 ≡0 . Dual
diﬀerentiation of (5.47) and (5.51) yields h2 ≡0 and h3 ≡0 . The equa-
tions relating the angular variables ϕ1, . . . , ϕ4 do not change (see (5.43),
(5.44), (5.48), (5.49), (5.50), (5.54)). These results conﬁrm that the spherical
four-bar has a single degree of freedom.
In Fig. 5.4 a spherical four-bar is shown as quadrilateral A0ABB0 the
links 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 of which are arcs of great circles on the unit sphere about the
intersection point 0 of the joint axes. The unit vectors n1, . . . , n4 along the
axes are pointing away from 0 . The unit vector ai normal to both ni and
ni+1 has the direction of ni × ni+1 (here and in what follows, i = 1, . . . , 4
cyclic). The angle αi is the angle about ai from ni to ni+1 , and ϕi is the
angle about ni from ai−1 to ai (see Fig. 5.1). The angle αi equals the arc
of link i on the unit sphere. Link i is said to have the length αi . At this
Fig. 5.4 Spherical four-bar

point the kinematics analysis is stopped. It is resumed in Chap. 18.
Final remark: The expressions in (5.42) – (5.46) are moderately complicated.
For mechanisms with up to twenty-one instead of nine constant parameters
much more complicated expressions are generated. In every case the genera-
tion requires only two operations. One is copying terms from Table 5.2 and
the other is calculating dual derivatives. Both operations can be executed by
the MAPLE software tool [34] already mentioned.
5.4.2 RCRCR and CRRRC
These mechanisms have n = 5 joints, 4n −7 = 13 constant parameters, two
cylindrical joints and nϕ = 5 angular variables. Figures 5.5a and b show
the mobile polygons with unit vectors ni and ai (i = 1, . . . , 5). Each ﬁgure
is structurally symmetric with respect to the dashed line.
With the cylindrical joints as joints a and b the equations F ℓ
1 = F r
1 and
F ℓ
2 = F r
2 are formulated. From Sect. 5.3.1 it is known that these equations
relate the angles in the three revolute joints. Two of them are unknown
dependent angles. The equations have the form (5.20) if the unknowns are
located in diﬀerent segments created by the cylindrical joints, and they have
the form (5.21) if they are located in one and the same segment. The case of
location in diﬀerent segments occurs if (i) the mechanism is RCRCR and (ii)
the independent angle is in one of the underscored revolutes. This simpler case
is treated ﬁrst. It is the case of Fig. 5.5a with ϕ1 as independent variable.
The cylindrical joints are the joints 3 and 5 . The equation F ℓ
1 = F r
1 is the
equation nk ·nk+2 = nk ·nk−3 with k = 3 . Table 5.2 yields the explicit form
C4C3 −S4S3c4
= S5[s1s2S2 −c1(S1C2 + C1S2c2)] + C5(C1C2 −S1S2c2) .
(5.55)
This is a special form of (5.20):

ϕ2 of the form
A sin2 ϕ2 + B sin ϕ2 cos ϕ2 + C sin ϕ2 + D cos2 ϕ2 + E cos ϕ2 + F = 0 (5.60)
with new coeﬃcients which are functions of ϕ1 . The substitution x =
tan ϕ2/2 ,
cos ϕ2 = (1 −x2)/(1 + x2) ,
sin ϕ2 = 2x/(1 + x2) produces
for x the 4th-order equation
x4(D−E +F)+2x3(C −B)+2x2(2A−D+F)+2x(C +B)+D+E +F = 0 .
(5.61)
It has four (not necessarily real) solutions ϕ2 for every value of ϕ1 . This is
the number Nϕ = 4 in Table 5.1 . With every real solution ϕ2 the associated
values c4 and s4 and, thus, ϕ4 are determined from (5.56) and (5.58).
Note: The substitution x = tan ϕ2/2 makes sense only if ϕ2 ̸= π . ϕ2 = π
is a solution if D −E + F = 0 and a double solution if, in addition, also
C−B = 0 . These are the coeﬃcients of x4 and x3 in the polynomial1. In the
case B = C = 0 , (5.60) is quadratic in cos ϕ2 , and in the case B = E = 0 ,
it is quadratic in sin ϕ2 . In either case the substitution x = tan ϕ2/2 is
unnecessary.
The variables ϕ3 , h3 and ϕ5 , h5 in the cylindrical joints are still un-
known. The angles ϕ3 and ϕ5 are determined ﬁrst as follows. One of the
two half-angle equations (5.37) is formulated with a = 5 , b = 3 and v = n5 .
This is a linear equation for x3 = tan ϕ3/2 as the only unknown. The same
equation with a = 3 , b = 5 and v = n3 determines x5 = tan ϕ5/2 . Next,
1 Example: The equation 4 sin2 ϕ + 3 sin ϕ cos ϕ + 3 sin ϕ + 2 cos2 ϕ + cos ϕ −1 = 0
has the solutions ϕ1 = ϕ2 = π . Equation (5.61) is 5x2 + 6x −1 = 0 . It has the solutions
ϕ3 = −π/2 and ϕ4 = −2 tan−1(1/5)

the unknowns h3 and h5 are expressed in terms of all other variables includ-
ing the previously determined angles ϕ3 and ϕ5 . A single linear equation
for h3 is obtained by formulating one of the half-angle equations (5.37) with
a = 5 , b = 3 and v = r . The same equation with a = 3 , b = 5 and v = r
determines h5 . Note that the vector r depends upon a and b according to
Fig. 5.2 . This concludes the analysis of the mechanism RCRCR with ϕ1 as
independent variable.
Next, ϕ4 is assumed to be the independent variable. In this case, both
Eq.(5.55) and its dual derivative have the form (5.21). With new names for
coeﬃcients they are written in the form
c1 (ai1c2 + ai2s2 + ai3)

(i = 1, 2) . Equation (5.55) yields, for example,
a11 = S5C1S2 ,
a12 = 0 ,
b11 = 0 , b12 = −S5S2 , r11 = C5S1S2 , r12 = 0 , r13 = C4C3 −S4S3c4 −
C5C1C2 . The two Eqs.(5.62) are solved as linear equations for c1 and s1 :
c1 = B1R2 −B2R1
A1B2 −A2B1
,
s1 = −A1R2 −A2R1
A1B2 −A2B1
.
(5.63)
The common denominator and the two numerator expressions contain zero,
ﬁrst and second-order terms of c2 and s2 . Substitution into the constraint
equation c2
1+s2
1 = 1 eliminates ϕ1 . The resulting equation relates ϕ2 to the
independent variable ϕ4 . This is the equation (A1R2 −A2R1)2 + (B1R2 −
B2R1)2 −(A1B2 −A2B1)2 = 0 . It contains zero, ﬁrst, second, third and
fourth-order terms of c2 and s2 with coeﬃcients which are functions of ϕ4 :
A cos4 ϕ2 + B cos3 ϕ2 sin ϕ2 + . . . = 0 .
(5.64)
The substitution x = tan ϕ2/2 , cos ϕ2 = (1−x2)/(1+x2) , sin ϕ2 = 2x/(1+
x2) produces for x an 8th-order polynomial equation2. For a given value
of the independent variable ϕ4 it has eight (not necessarily real) solutions
ϕ2 . This is the number Nϕ = 8 in Table 5.1 . For every solution ϕ2 the
corresponding solution ϕ1 is calculated from (5.63).
For the mechanism CRRRC in Fig. 5.5b the same set of Eqs.(5.62) is
obtained. Only the indices of the unknown variables and the coeﬃcients are
diﬀerent. The details are left to the reader. This concludes the analysis of the
mechanisms RCRCR and CRRRC .
Equations (5.63) require a comment. It may happen that the common
denominator and the two numerator expressions are linear functions of c2
and s2 . This requires that in all three expressions c2s2 has the factor zero,
2 ϕ2 = π is a root of multiplicity n if the highest-order term in the polynomial is x8−n

and that c2
2 and s2
2 have identical factors. For the factors of c2s2 to be zero
the three conditions on the left-hand side below must be satisﬁed. For the
factors of c2
2 and of s2
2 to be identical the three conditions on the right-hand
side must be satisﬁed.
a11r22 +a12r21 = a21r12 +a22r11 ,
a11r21 −a21r11 = a12r22 −a22r12 ,
b11r22 +b12r21 = b21r12 +b22r11 ,
b11r21 −b21r11 = b12r22 −b22r12 ,
a11b22 +a12b21 = a21b12 +a22b11 ,
a11b21 −a21b11 = a12b22 −a22b12 .

(5.65)
Under these conditions the equation (A1R2 −A2R1)2 + (B1R2 −B2R1)2 −
(A1B2 −A2B1)2 = 0 contains only zero, ﬁrst and second-order terms of c2
and s2 . Hence it does not have the form (5.64), but the form (5.60). This
equation has four solutions for every value of the independent variable. The
mechanism RRSRR analyzed in Sect. 5.5.2 is governed by a set of equations
satisfying the conditions (5.65).
5.4.3 RCPRC , CCPRR and RCPCR . Independent
Variable in the Prismatic Joint
These mechanisms are obtained from the previously investigated mechanisms
RCRCR and CRRRC when one revolute joint is replaced by a cylindrical
joint. The letter sequences are written such that the prismatic joint is joint
3 . The translatory variable h3 in this joint is the independent variable. As
before, the two cylindrical joints are the joints a and b . As before, the clo-
sure conditions F ℓ
1 = F r
1 and F ℓ
2 = F r
2 are formulated and, as before, the
angles ϕλ and ϕμ of two revolute joints are the only unknowns in these
equations. In the mechanism RCPRC the two angles are located in diﬀerent
segments created by the cylindrical joints, and in the mechanisms CCPRR
and RCPCR they are located in one and the same segment. For the ﬁrst
mechanism both equations have the form (5.20), and for the other two mech-
anisms they have the form (5.21). The numbers of solution are four for the
former and eight for the latter. These are the numbers Nt given in Table
5.1 . This concludes the analysis.
5.4.4 Mechanisms in Rows 6 and 7 of Table 5.1 .

It was shown that the closure condition F ℓ

is Eq.(5.21) with two
unknowns ϕλ and ϕμ , and that the closure condition F ℓ
5 = F r
5 has the
same form (see (5.26)). The unknowns ϕλ and ϕμ are the same in both

equations if the joints a and b are the same for both equations. The choice
of these joints is dictated by the method for formulating the right-hand side
of (5.26). Both equations are written in the form (5.62). For a given value of
the independent variable the number of solutions is eight since the conditions
(5.65) are not satisﬁed. This concludes the analysis.
5.4.5 5R-C
This mechanism has n = 6 joints, 4n−7 = 17 constant parameters, nϕ = 6
angular variables and a single translatory variable in the cylindrical joint.
Figure 5.6 shows schematically the mobile polygon with unit vectors ni and
ai (i = 1, . . . , 6). Joint 3 is the cylindrical joint. The dashed line is an axis
of structural symmetry. The vector r shown in the ﬁgure is
r =
"−(h3n3 + ℓ3a3 + h4n4 + ℓ4a4 + h5n5 + ℓ5a5) (left segment)
h6n6 + ℓ6a6 + h1n1 + ℓ1a1 + h2n2 + ℓ2a2
(right segment) .
(5.66)
The revolute joint 6 and the cylindrical joint 3 are chosen as joints a and
b , respectively. This has the eﬀect that every closure condition displays the
symmetry.
Let ϕ5 be the independent variable. Then two unknown variables ϕ1
and ϕ2 appear in the right segment and the single unknown variable ϕ4 in
the left segment. First, the closure conditions F ℓ
1 = F r
1 and F ℓ
2 = F r
2 are
formulated. The former is the equation nk · nk+3 = nk · nk−3 with k = 3 .
The scalar products are copied from Table 5.2 :

The coeﬃcient matrices A1 and B1 are of size (2 × 2) and (2 × 9) , respec-

No other closure condition yields a third equation for the same three un-
knowns. The closure conditions F ℓ
3 = F r
3 and F ℓ
4 = F r
4 with F3 = n6 · r
and F4 = n3 · r have the form (5.23) with hκ = h3 . One of these equations
is used later for the calculation of h3 once ϕ1 , ϕ2 and ϕ4 are known. For
the determination of these angles the two pairs of half-angle equations (5.37)
with v = n6 and with v = r are formulated. In the four Eqs.(5.37) the same
unknown elements of uℓare located on the left-hand sides and the elements
of ur on the right-hand sides. All these elements occur once without and
once with the factor x6 = tan ϕ6/2 . The four equations are combined in the
matrix form

The coeﬃcient matrices A2 and A3 are of size (4×4) , and B2 and B3 are
of size (4 × 9) . They are functions of ϕ5 .
The goal is now to deduce from the six Eqs.(5.69) and (5.71) a polynomial
equation for a single unknown variable. Two additional equations are pro-
duced by multiplying (5.69) with x6 . These two equations together with the
two Eqs.(5.69) and the four Eqs.(5.71) represent a system of eight equations.

resulting expression is substituted into the last four equations. These four
equations are then of the form
P z = 0
(5.73)
with a (4 × 18)-matrix P . Next, two new variables xi = tan ϕi/2 (i = 1, 2)
are deﬁned. Substituting ci = (1 −x2

i ) and si = 2xi/(1 + x2
i ) (i =

The coeﬃcients ai , bi , di , pi , qi , ri themselves are second-order functions
of x1 with coeﬃcients depending on ϕ5 . The four Eqs.(5.74) are multiplied
with x2 . These new equations and the four Eqs.(5.74) are combined in matrix

The (8 × 8) coeﬃcient matrix must satisfy two conditions.
1. For a nontrivial solution to exist the determinant Δ of the coeﬃcient
matrix must be zero.
2. The nontrivial solution must have a nonzero 8th component. This latter
condition is formulated as follows. Let K1 be the (8 × 7)-matrix formed by
the ﬁrst seven columns of the coeﬃcient matrix, and let K2 be the eighth
column. Furthermore, let ξ be the column matrix

This equation must have a unique solution. This is condition 2 . The matrices
K1 and K2 depend on x1 which is calculated from the ﬁrst condition Δ =
0 . This is a 16th-order equation3 for x1 . With this equation it is proved
that the mechanism 5R-C has at most sixteen diﬀerent conﬁgurations for a

given value of the independent variable ϕ5 . This is the number Nϕ given
in Table 5.1 . Lee [27] gave a numerical example with sixteen diﬀerent real
conﬁgurations.
Every solution x1 determines ϕ1 = 2 tan−1 x1 . The associated solutions
x2 and x6 , i.e., ϕ2 and ϕ6 are determined by (5.77). With the solutions
for ϕ1 and ϕ2 Eqs.(5.69) are two linear equations for c4 and s4 . They
determine ϕ4 . The last two unknowns are the variables ϕ3 and h3 in the
cylindrical joint. The equation F ℓ
3 = F r
3 has the form (5.23) with hκ = h3 .
It determines h3 . The angle ϕ3 or rather x3 = tan ϕ3/2 , can be calculated
from one half-angle equation (5.37) with a = 6 , b = 3 and v = n6 . An
alternative method is to formulate and to solve two linear equations for c3
and s3 , for example, the Woernle-Lee equations F ℓ
1 = F r
1 with F1 = n4 · n1
and with F1 = n5 · n2 . They are obtained from (5.67) by a cyclic increase
of all indices by one and by two, respectively. This concludes the analysis of
the mechanism 5R-C .
5.4.6 RRCRPR , RRCPRR , RRCRRP . Independent
Variable in the Prismatic Joint
Each of these mechanisms can be produced from the mechanism 5R-C by
replacing one revolute joint by a cylindrical joint. To be speciﬁc, the mecha-
nism RRCRPR is investigated. Its vector polygon has the form of Fig. 5.6 .
The only diﬀerence as compared with the mechanism 5R-C is that joint 5 is
replaced by a prismatic joint. In the previous analysis the angle ϕ5 was the
independent variable. Now, ϕ5 is constant whereas h5 , previously constant,
is the independent variable. With the joints a = 3 and b = 6 the same equa-
tions F ℓ
1 = F r
1 and F ℓ
2 = F r
2 are formulated. These are Eq.(5.67) and its
dual derivative. The matrix form of these two equations is, again, Eq.(5.69).
The only diﬀerence is, that now the coeﬃcient matrix A1 is a function not of
ϕ5 , but of h5 . Also the rest of the analysis is the same as for the mechanism
5R-C . Two pairs of half-angle equations (5.37) with v = n6 and with v = r
result in Eqs.(5.71). Via Eqs.(5.73) - (5.75) the existence of sixteen solutions
x1 = tan ϕ1/2 for a given value of the independent variable h5 is proved.
This concludes the analysis.
5.4.7 Mechanism 7R
This mechanism has n = 7 joints and 4n −7 = 21 constant parameters.
The only variables are the angles ϕ1, . . . , ϕ7 in the revolute joints. Figure 5.7
shows schematically the polygon with unit vectors ni and ai (i = 1, . . . , 7).

In each of these eight equations the elements of uℓappear on the left-hand

with coeﬃcient matrices A2 and A3 of size (8 × 8) and B2 and B3 of

by multiplying (5.89) with x6 . These six equations together with the six
Eqs.(5.89) and the eight Eqs.(5.92) represent a system of twenty equations.

with a (4 × 18)-matrix P . They are formally identical with (5.73). Also
(5.74) and (5.75) and the conditions on the coeﬃcient matrix in (5.75) are
valid again (the only diﬀerence being that now ϕ7 is the independent vari-
able instead of ϕ5 and that a larger number of constant Denavit-Hartenberg
parameters is involved). The condition that the determinant Δ must be zero
results in a 16th-order equation for x1 = tan ϕ1/2 with coeﬃcients depend-
ing on ϕ7 . Thus, it is proved that the mechanism 7R has at most sixteen
conﬁgurations for a given value of the independent variable ϕ7 . The unknown
angles ϕ1 , ϕ2 and ϕ6 are calculated as was shown following (5.77). With
ϕ1 , ϕ2 and ϕ6 the column matrix ur in the four Eqs.(5.79) is known. These
equations are solved for uℓ. This solution determines the angles ϕ1 and ϕ2 .
The last unknown ϕ3 is found by the method explained in the section on
the mechanism 5R-C . This concludes the analysis of the mechanism 7R .
5.4.8 4R-3P . Independent Variable is an Angle
These are the mechanisms in row 4 of Table 5.1 . At the end of Sect. 5.3.1
on Woernle-Lee equations it was said that the closure conditions F ℓ
k = F r
k
(k = 1, 2, 3, 4) are formulated not only for the mechanism 7R , but also for the
mechanisms 4R-3P . These mechanisms have seven joints and, consequently,
the vector polygon shown in Fig. 5.7 . The mechanism 7R is converted into
a mechanism 4R-3P by replacing three out of the four revolute joints 1 , 2 ,
4 and 5 by prismatic joints. This has the eﬀect that in the four Eqs.(5.82),
(5.84), (5.87) and (5.88) three out of the variables ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ4 and ϕ5 are
(arbitrary) constants. Only one of them, say ϕj , is still a variable. For this
variable (5.82) becomes an equation of the form Acj + Bsj = R . It has two
solutions for every value of the independent variable ϕ7 . With each solution
the remaining three Eqs.(5.84), (5.87) and (5.88) become linear equations
with known coeﬃcients for the translatory variables in the three prismatic
joints. This concludes the analysis of the mechanisms 4R-3P .
5.4.9 6R-P . Independent Variable is an Angle
The mechanism 6R-P has the same vector polygon the mechanism 7R has
(Fig. 5.7). The mechanism 7R is converted into the mechanism 6R-P by
replacing a single revolute joint by a prismatic joint. Let this be joint 5 .
Again, the four Eqs.(5.82), (5.84), (5.87) and (5.88) are used. As before, ϕ7
is the independent variable. But now, ϕ5 is a constant and h5 is a variable.
The only places where this variable appears explicitly, are the left-hand sides
of (5.84), (5.87) and (5.88). These three equations have the form (5.23) with

equations (5.37) formulated with the vectors v1 , v2 and v3 shown in (5.38).
In each of these altogether six equations the column matrices of (5.95) appear
once without and once with the factor x6 = tan ϕ6/2 . The six equations are

Eqs.(5.97) represent a system of fourteen equations. It is written in the form

z . The resulting expression is substituted into the last four equations. These
four equations are then of the form

with a (4 × 18)-matrix P . They are formally identical with (5.73). The re-
duction to a 16th-order equation proceeds as before. Thus, it is proved that
the mechanism 6R-P has at most sixteen conﬁgurations for a given value of
the independent variable ϕ7 . The unknown angles ϕ1 , ϕ2 and ϕ6 are cal-

culated as was shown following (5.77). With these results the column matrix
z in the fourteen Eqs.(5.98) is known. The ten equations already mentioned
yield y and with it the variables ϕ4 and h5 . The last two unknowns ϕ3 and
ϕ6 can be determined either from half-angle equations or from Woernle-Lee
equations F ℓ
1 = F r
1 . See the sections on the mechanisms RCRCR and 5R-C .
This concludes the analysis of the mechanism 6R-P when the independent
variable is an angle.
5.4.10 6R-P . Independent Variable in the Prismatic
Joint
Again, the vector polygon shown in Fig. 5.7 is used. This time, joint 7 is
the prismatic joint. As in the analysis of the mechanism 7R the same four
Eqs.(5.82), (5.84), (5.87), (5.88), the same two Woernle-Lee equations with
F6 and F7 and the same four pairs of half-angle equations are formulated.
The only diﬀerence is that in these equations ϕ7 is now constant whereas
h7 is the independent variable. The only unknowns are, as before, the angles
ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ4 and ϕ5 . The ﬁnal result of the analysis is, again, a 16th-order
polynomial equation for x1 = tan ϕ1/2 . This explains the number Nt = 16
in Table 5.1 for this mechanism.
5.5 Mechanisms with Special Parameter Values
In the analysis of every mechanism up to now it was assumed that all con-
stant Denavit-Hartenberg parameters are nonzero and arbitrary. The large
number of parameters (between nine and twenty-one) allows for an enormous
number of special cases. The Bennett mechanism and the spherical four-bar
introduced in Sect. 5.4.1 are special cases of the mechanism RCCC . Table
5.2 shows that parallelity or orthogonality of the joint axes on a single body
k results in substantial simpliﬁcations ( Sk = 0 , Ck = 1 in the former case
and Sk = 1 , Ck = 0
in the latter). In the following sections two special
mechanisms are investigated.
5.5.1 7R with Three Parallel Joint Axes in Series
Subject of investigation is a mechanism 7R with three parallel successive
joint axes, say n2 , n3 and n4 . The parallelity has the eﬀect that the bodies
1, 2, 3 and 4 are in planar motion relative to each other. For the Denavit-
194
5 Spatial Simple Closed Chains

Hartenberg parameters this parallelity means α2 = α3 = 0 and, therefore,
S2 = S3 = 0 , C2 = C3 = 1 . When this is substituted into (5.82), the
unknowns ϕ2 and ϕ4 disappear. For the two remaining unknowns ϕ1 and
ϕ5 the equation has the form
S4S5c5 = A1c1 + B1s1 + R1
(5.100)
with coeﬃcients
A1 = S1(C6S7 + S6C7c7) ,
B1 = −S1S6s7 ,
R1 = C4C5 −C1(C6C7 −S6S7c7) .
 
(5.101)
Except for changes of indices (5.100) is identical with (5.56). Equation (5.84)
is replaced by the dual derivative of (5.100). This equation is Eq.(5.58) with
the same changes of indices. It was shown that these equations have four
solutions (ϕ1, ϕ5) for every value of the independent variable ϕ7 . This ends
the analysis of the special case.
5.5.2 RRSRR
The mechanism RRSRR is another special case of a mechanism 7R . The
letter S stands for the spherical joint which was explained in Sect. 5.1 .
The polygon of vectors is shown in Fig. 5.8 . Bodies 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are cou-
pled by revolute joints 1, 2, 3, 5 and by the spherical joint. Unit vectors
ni (i = 1, 2, 3, 5) and ai (i = 1, 2, 5) are located on joint axes and on
normals common to pairs of joint axes, respectively. The vectors ℓ3a3 and
ℓ4a4 denote the normals from the spherical joint onto the joint axes 3 and
5 , respectively. The mechanism has twelve constant parameters, namely, hi
(i = 1, 2, 3, 5) in revolute joints and ℓi (i = 1, . . . , 5), αi (i = 1, 2, 5) on
bodies. Variables are the angles ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ3 , ϕ5 in revolute joints and, in
addition, three angles associated with the spherical joint. These latter ones
are not considered.
The symmetry allows the same conclusions which were drawn from the
symmetry of Fig. 5.3 . The independent variable is either ϕ5 or ϕ1 . Because
of the symmetry only these two cases need be considered. As joints a and
b in the sense of Fig. 5.2 the spherical joint and joint 3 are chosen. One of
the two segments between the joints a and b has no joint variables. The
other segment has the joint variables ϕ1 , ϕ2 and ϕ5 . Two of these are
unknowns. These two are determined from the two Woernle-Lee Eqs.(5.16)
with F3 = n3 · r and F6 = r2 . The vector r is shown in Fig. 5.8 :

Taking into account the orthogonality n3 · a3 = 0 the closure conditions are

In (5.104) the seven quadratic terms yield the constant (ℓ2

Each vector is orthogonal to its right-hand neighbor. This determines the
products
a4 · n5 = n5 · a5 = a5 · n1 = n1 · a1 = a1 · n2 = n2 · a2 = 0 .
Between each vector and its second neighbor to the right either a joint angle
or a constant angle is located. This determines the ﬁve products a4 · a5 =
c5 , n5 · n1 = C5 , a5 · a1 = c1 , n1 · n2 = C1 , a1 · a2 = c2 . For calculating
the remaining products the vectors are decomposed in a basis ﬁxed on body
1 . With k = 1 the vectors are
a4 = ak−2 , n5 = nk−1 , a5 = ak−1 ,
n1 = nk ,
a1 = ak ,
n2 = nk+1 ,
a2 = ak+1 ,
n3 = nk+2 . The
coordinates are copied4 from Table 5.2 into the following Table 5.3 .

a given value of the independent variable is eight in the general case and

velocities ˙ϕi and ˙hj , respectively. One of them is independent and the other
six are dependent. The time derivatives of six suitably chosen closure condi-

tions constitute a system of six homogeneous linear equations for the seven
generalized velocities. The solution of this system expresses each of the six
dependent generalized velocities as some multiple of the independent general-

used also for the determination of the dependent variables. In what follows,
details are shown for the mechanisms RCCC and 7R .

5.7 Spatial Serial Robots
A spatial serial robot consists of a stationary base, a robot hand and a serial
kinematical chain connecting hand and base. The serial chain is the arm of
the robot. With a suitable combination of cylindrical, revolute and prismatic
joints in the arm with altogether six joint variables the hand has relative
to the base three rotational and three translatory degrees of freedom. The
minimal number of joints is three with the joint combination 3C and the
maximal number is six with the joint combination 6R . The bodies are labeled
1, . . . , n with the base being body 1 and the hand being body n . The joints
are labeled 1, . . . , n −1 beginning at the base. The problem to be solved is
the following. The pose, i.e., the position and the angular orientation of the
hand relative to the base, is prescribed in terms of six variables of unspeciﬁed
nature, for example, by three coordinates of a single point plus three angular
variables. Determine all sets of six joint variables producing this prescribed
pose. The solution is found as follows. In a preparatory step the six prescribed
variables are converted into another set of six variables which are deﬁned as
follows. In the prescribed pose bodies n and 1 are imagined to be connected
by a revolute joint labeled n with an axis of arbitrarily chosen location and
direction and with locked joint variable ϕn . The six new variables are the
six Denavit-Hartenberg parameters deﬁned by this joint, namely, αn , ℓn on
body n , ϕn and hn in joint n and α1 , ℓ1 on body 1 . Together with the real
joints of the robot this ﬁctitious joint creates a spatial single-loop mechanism
199
5.7 Spatial Serial Robots

with given constant Denavit-Hartenberg parameters and with a given value
of the joint variable ϕn . Thus, the problem to be solved is the following.
Determine six dependent joint variables of a spatial single-loop mechanism
for a given value of a single independent variable ϕn . The complete solution
is known from the previous sections. Table 5.4 is deduced from Table 5.1 .
Each of the ten rows shows the joint combination of the respective row in
Table 5.1 with one revolute joint deleted. The deleted joint is the ﬁctitious
joint. The ten joint combinations represent all possible robot arms giving

be ordered along the robot arm from base to hand in many diﬀerent ways.
Diﬀerent sequences of letters represent diﬀerent robots. Examples are the
sequences (from base to hand) CRRPP, CRPRP, RRPPC etc. with the joint
combination C-2R-2P. Let νr be the number of diﬀerent robots that can be
built with a given joint combination. It is calculated as follows. Let νC , νR
and νP be the numbers of cylindrical, of revolute and of prismatic joints,
respectively. The total number of joints in the arm is ν = νC +νR +νP . With
these numbers the number νr is

5 Spatial Simple Closed Chains

The number Nϕ is copied from Table 5.1 . It represents the number of (real
or complex) six-tuples of joint variables for a given pose of the robot hand.
Every real six-tuple determines an arm conﬁguration producing the given
pose. From Table 5.1 it is known that in row 5 the number Nϕ is either four
or eight depending on which revolute joint carries the independent angular
variable. In Table 5.4 the independent variable is ϕ5 in the ﬁctitious joint 5 .
This explains the correspondence between the numbers Nϕ = 4 and 8 and
the various joint sequences. For all other joint combinations the number Nϕ
is independent of the sequence of joints.
Lee [27] investigated the following problem. The hand of a 6R-robot is in
pure translation with a point P of the hand moving along a given straight
line. Let z be the coordinate of P along this line. The six Denavit-Hartenberg
parameters αn , ℓn , ϕn , hn , α1 , ℓ1 of the ﬁctitious joint are functions of z .
The number of real solutions for the six joint variables, i.e., of arm conﬁgu-
rations is a function of z , too. This function divides the z-axis into intervals
with diﬀerent numbers of arm conﬁgurations. With the parameter values
chosen by Lee z-intervals with the maximum number Nϕ = 16 were found.

Chapter 6
Overconstrained Mechanisms
By deﬁnition, an overconstrained mechanism is a mechanism for which
Gr¨ubler’s formula (4.1) yields a degree of freedom F > 0 only because the
system of kinematic constraint equations has a suﬃciently large defect d > 0 .
It is known that a simple closed kinematic chain with n < 7 joint variables
has a degree of freedom F > 0 only if it is overconstrained. Sections 6.1 –
6.4 are devoted to simple closed chains with four, with ﬁve and with six rev-
olute joints. In the remaining Sects. 6.5 – 6.11 other types of overconstrained
mechanisms are analyzed.
The planar four-bar and the spherical four-bar with n = 4 revolute
joints are among the oldest overconstrained mechanisms. Two simple over-
constrained mechanisms with n = 6 revolute joints are shown in Figs. 6.1
and 6.2 . In Fig. 6.1 the ﬁxed frame, three shafts and the cross-shaped central
bodies of two Hooke’s joints are interconnected by two frame-ﬁxed revolutes
and by two more revolutes in each Hooke’s joint. The mechanism shown in
Fig. 6.2 was invented by Sarrus. Body 4 has the single degree of freedom of
translation along the x-axis. The body is connected to the frame 1 by two
dyads (bodies 2,3 and 5,6 ) each dyad having three parallel revolute joints

6 Overconstrained Mechanisms
perpendicular to the x-axis (otherwise arbitrarily directed, but not all six
parallel).
6.1 Bricard’s Theorem on Closed Chains with Revolute
Joints
The early history of the search for overconstrained mechanisms was marked
by chance discoveries and by ingenuity. The ﬁrst systematic investigations
were made by Delassus [15, 16]. An important step forward was made by
Bricard’s
Theorem 6.1. In the case of n = 6 revolute joints the joint axes are, in
every position of the system instantaneously, lines of a linear complex. In the
case of n = 5 revolute joints the joint axes are, in every position of the system
instantaneously, lines of a linear congruence. In the case of n = 4 revolute
joints the joint axes are, in every position of the system instantaneously,
generating lines of a ruled surface of order two (a quadric).
Proof for the case n = 6 (Bricard [10]): Let joint i connect bodies i and
i −1 (i = 1, . . . , 6 cyclic), and let ωi(ni, ai × ni) be the associated velocity
screw of body i relative to body i −1 (see (9.33)). The vectors ni and
ai × ni are the Pl¨ucker vectors of joint axis i . The velocity screw of body 6
relative to itself is zero. This is the set of equations
6

i=1
ai × niωi = 0 ,
6

i=1
niωi = 0 .
(6.1)
Decomposition in some common reference frame yields six homogeneous lin-
ear equations with a (6×6)-coeﬃcient matrix of vector coordinates multiplied
by the column matrix of angular velocities. Since these latter ones are not
all zero, the coeﬃcient matrix must be singular. More precisely, some linear
combination of its rows must be zero. In vector notation this is expressed by
the six equations (one for each column of the matrix)
a · ai × ni + b · ni = 0
(i = 1 . . . , 6)
(6.2)
where a and b are vectors whose altogether six coordinates are the coef-
ﬁcients of the said linear combination. This is Eq.(2.25) deﬁning the lines
(ni , ai × ni) to be lines of the linear complex (a; b) . End of proof.
Proof for the case n = 5 : The closed kinematic chain with six axes is
formally reduced to a chain with ﬁve axes if the sixth axis (n6 , a6 × n6)
has arbitrary location while simultaneously
ω6 = 0 . Equations (6.1) lead
again to (6.2). Because of the arbitrariness of n6 and a6 ×n6 the said linear
complex (a; b) is now subject to a linear constraint equation. This proves

6.2 Bennett Mechanism
207
that the axes 1 , . . . , 5 are lines of a linear congruence. The proof for the
case n = 4 repeats the same arguments. With axes 5 and 6 being arbitrary
the linear complex (a; b) is subject to two linear constraint equations. This
ends the proof of the theorem.
The theorem states that (in the case n = 6 , for example) a closed kine-
matic chain with six joint axes is instantaneously mobile if in the position
under investigation the six joint axes are lines of a linear complex. Motion
into another position is possible only if in every intermediate position the
six joint axes are lines of a linear complex. In general, this is not the case if
a single assembly position of a mechanism is the result of selecting at ran-
dom six lines of a linear complex as joint axes. The theorem provides a new
direction to the search for overconstrained systems, namely: Find closed kine-
matic chains having the property that its six axes belong in every position
to a linear complex. This search led Bricard [10] to three classes of overcon-
strained mechanisms which are the subjects of Sects. 6.4.1 , 6.4.2 and 6.4.3 .
The chapter begins with the celebrated Bennett mechanism which has four
revolute joints.
6.2 Bennett Mechanism
In Sect. 5.4.1 the closed kinematical chain RCCC was investigated (see Fig.
5.3 and (5.43) – (5.51)). Bennett [8] noticed that the joint variables h2 , h3
and h4 in the three cylindrical joints are identically zero if the parameters
satisfy the conditions
α3 = α1 ,
ℓ3 = ℓ1 ,
α4 = α2 ,
ℓ4 = ℓ2 ,
ℓ2 sin α1 = ℓ1 sin α2 ,
h1 = 0 .
 
(6.3)
A proof is given further below. With h2 = h3 = h4 ≡0 all four joints of
the mechanism are revolute joints with zero oﬀset. This mechanism is called
Bennett mechanism. It is an overconstrained mechanism with the degree of
freedom F = 1 . Gr¨ubler’s formula (4.1) yields F = −2+d . Hence the number
of dependent constraint equations is d = 3 . According to Bricard’s Theorem
6.1 the joint axes are, in every position of the mechanism instantaneously,
generators of a hyperboloid.
From the condition ℓ2 sin α1 = ℓ1 sin α2 it follows that sin α1 and sin α2
have the same sign. Arbitrarily, the positive sign is assumed, i.e., angles in
the interval 0 < α1, α2 < π (angles zero and π are excluded because only
spatial mechanisms are investigated). The Bennett mechanism is speciﬁed by
the three parameters ℓ1 , α1 and α2 . Together they determine ℓ2 .
Note: The alternative decision to use as parameters the quantities ℓ1 , ℓ2 and
α1 has the disadvantage that either no real angle α2 or two diﬀerent angles
α2 satisfy the condition ℓ2 sin α1 = ℓ1 sin α2 . Two mechanisms diﬀering in

208
6 Overconstrained Mechanisms
α2 only are not representing two types of Bennett mechanism, but simply
two diﬀerent Bennett mechanisms.
Kinematical properties of the Bennett mechanism are deduced from the
equations governing the mechanism RCCC and from the conditions (6.3).
First, it is proved that h2 = h3 = h4 ≡0 . Equation (5.51) reduces to
h3 = 0 . This concludes the proof for h3 . From the symmetry of Eqs.(6.3)
it follows that h2 ≡0 if h4 ≡0 . The solution h4 ≡0 requires that the
numerator expression in (5.45) be identically zero. In addition, (5.43) is valid.
Therefore, it must be shown that the equations
Ac4 + Bs4 −R = 0 ,
Dc4 + Es4 + F = 0
(6.4)
do not contradict each other. The coeﬃcients A , B , R , D , E , F are those
given in (5.44) and (5.46). In view of (6.3) they have the forms
A = −S1(S1C2c1 + S2C1) ,
B = S2
1s1 ,
D = ℓ1(ac1 + b) ,
R =
S1(S2C1c1 + S1C2) ,
E = −2ℓ1S1C1s1 ,
F = ℓ1(bc1 + a)
 
(6.5)
with constants
a = S1(2C1C2 −S2
2) ,
b = S2(2C2
1 + C1C2 −1) .
(6.6)
With these expressions Eqs.(6.4) are two linear equations for two unknowns:
S1C2
1 + c1c4
s1s4
+ C1S2
c1 + c4
s1s4
= S1 ,
a 1 + c1c4
s1s4
+ b c1 + c4
s1s4
= 2S1C1 .
(6.7)
The solution is
1 + c1c4
s1s4
= 1 −C1C2
C2 −C1
,
c1 + c4
s1s4
= −S1S2
C2 −C1
.
(6.8)
The diﬀerence of these two equations produces on the left-hand side the
expression
(1 −c1)(1 −c4)
s1s4
= tan ϕ1
2 tan ϕ4
2
(6.9)
and on the right-hand side the constant
1 −(C1C2 −S1S2)
C2 −C1
=
1 −cos(α1 + α2)
2 sin α1+α2
2
sin α1−α2
2
= sin α1+α2
2
sin α1−α2
2
.
(6.10)
It can have any positive or negative value. Thus, the result for ϕ4 is
tan ϕ4
2 = p cot ϕ1
2 ,
p = sin α1+α2
2
sin α1−α2
2
.
(6.11)

6.2 Bennett Mechanism
209
This equation relates to every angle 0 ≤ϕ1 ≤2π a single angle ϕ4 (and
vice versa) for which h4 ≡0 . This concludes the proof.
The existence of a single angle ϕ4 for every angle ϕ1 proves that the
Bennett mechanism does not have a second conﬁguration. Full-cycle rotata-
bility in joint 1 follows also from the fact that in (6.4) A2 + B2 −R2 =
(S1S2s1)2 ≥0 and D2 + E2 −F 2 = [ℓ1S2(C1 + C2)s1]2 ≥0 .
Next, the relationship between ϕ2 and ϕ1 is established. For the mech-
anism RCCC it is given by Eqs.(5.48), (5.49). With (6.3) the coeﬃcients
A∗, B∗, R∗turn out to be the coeﬃcients A , B , R in (6.5) with α1 and
α2 interchanged. Because of (6.11) this means that ϕ2 = −ϕ4 .
Finally, the relationship between ϕ3 and ϕ1 is established. Equation
(5.50) reduces to cos ϕ3 = cos ϕ1 . Hence either ϕ3 = ϕ1 or ϕ3 = −ϕ1 .
Another equation involving ϕ3 is Eq.(5.53). With (6.3) it becomes
S1C2(c3 + c4) −S2(s3s4 −C1c3c4) + C1S2 = 0 .
(6.12)
Depending on whether ϕ3 = ϕ1 or ϕ3 = −ϕ1 this is one of the two equations
S1C2(c1 + c4) −S2(±s1s4 −C1c1c4) + C1S2 = 0 .
(6.13)
For c1 + c4 and for c1c4 expressions obtained from (6.8) are substituted. It
turns out that only the equation with the minus sign is identically satisﬁed.
This shows that ϕ3 = −ϕ1 .
Next, the angular velocity
˙ϕ4 and the angular acceleration ¨ϕ4 are de-
termined by diﬀerentiating (6.11) with respect to time. The ﬁrst derivative
yields
˙ϕ4 = −p ˙ϕ1
cos2 ϕ4

(6.15)
or, ﬁnally,
˙ϕ4 = −˙ϕ1
2p
1 + p2 −(1 −p2) cos ϕ1
.
(6.16)
The ratio
˙ϕ4/ ˙ϕ1 is oscillating 2π-periodically between the extremal values
−p and −1/p . Diﬀerentiating one more time yields for the angular acceler-
ation the expression
¨ϕ4 = −¨ϕ1

Byshgens [13] and Dimentberg/Schor [18] gave the ﬁrst proofs that the
Bennett mechanism, the planar four-bar and the spherical four-bar are the

6 Overconstrained Mechanisms
only overconstrained mechanisms composed of four links and four revolute
joints. See also Dietmaier [19].
In Chap. 7 chains RR are investigated. A chain RR is a chain of three
bodies interconnected by two revolute joints. One of the terminal bodies is
the ﬁxed frame. The other terminal body has the degree of freedom two.
Subject of investigation are positions of the moving body and trajectories of
body-ﬁxed points. In the Bennett mechanism bodies 3 and 1 are the terminal
bodies of two chains RR , one with joints 1 , 2 on body 2 and the other with
joints 3 , 4 on body 4 . Equations (6.3) and the relationships ϕ3 = −ϕ1 ,
ϕ4 = −ϕ2 show that both chains RR are congruent. Every position of body
3 and the trajectories of all points of body 3 are generated by both chains
RR . In Chap. 7 these statements are arrived at by arguments diﬀerent from
the ones used here.
6.3 Kinematical Chains with Five Revolute Joints
The only known 5R mechanism is the Goldberg mechanism treated in Sect.
6.3.1 . Whether other types exist, is an unsettled question. If so, then the
ﬁfteen constant Denavit-Hartenberg parameters ℓi , αi , hi
(i = 1, . . . , 5)
satisfy certain conditions. A set of suﬃcient conditions is formulated as fol-
lows. The unit vectors in the polygon of vectors ℓiai +hini (i = 1, . . . , 5) are
shown in Fig. 5.5a in which now all ﬁve joints are understood to be revolute
joints. Woernle-Lee equations eliminate two joint variables. Five equations
relating ϕ3 , ϕ1 , ϕ5 are based on the products n2 · n4 , n2 · r , n4 · r , r2
and r · n2 × n4 with the vector r pointing from n2 to n4 . This vector has
the two representations
r =
"h2n2 + ℓ2a2 + h3n3 + ℓ3a3
(right segment)
−(h4n4 + ℓ4a4 + h5n5 + ℓ5a5 + h1n1 + ℓ1a1)
(left segment) .
(6.18)
The ﬁfth equation is the dual derivative of the ﬁrst equation (see (3.50)).
Evaluation of the equations by means of Table 5.2 is an elementary exercise
left to the reader. The ﬁrst equation is nk · nk+2 = nk · nk−3 with k = 2 .
The equations are
S2S3c3
+A1c5 +B1s5 = R1 ,
ℓ3 S2s3 +A2c5 +B2s5 = R2 ,

AiBj ). Substitution of (6.21) into the ﬁfth Eq.(6.19) results after multiplica-
tion with Δ in an equation in which ϕ1 is the only variable. This equation

The coeﬃcients are functions of the ﬁfteen parameters. Without loss of gen-
erality, the parameter ℓ1 can be set equal to one so that ℓ2, . . . , ℓ5 and
h1, . . . , h5 are determined as multiples of ℓ1 . Hence there are only four-
teen essential parameters. Equations (6.19), (6.20) remain valid when the
indices of all parameters and variables are cyclicly increased by 1 , by 2 , by
3 , by 4 . Hence altogether ﬁve 6th-order identity equations with variables
xi = tan ϕi/2 (i = 1, . . . , 5) and with coeﬃcients depending on the fourteen
essential parameters are obtained. In each identity equation the seven coeﬃ-
cients must be zero. In addition, the conditions c2

6 Overconstrained Mechanisms
6.3.1 Goldberg Mechanism
Goldberg [20] recognized that an overconstrained 5R mechanism can be con-
structed by merging two Bennett mechanisms. Both mechanisms must be
identical in the parameters α1 and ℓ1 and diﬀerent in the third parameter,
i.e., α2 in one mechanism and α3 ̸= α2 in the other (see Fig. 6.3a ). The
parameters satisfy Eqs.(6.3), i.e.,
ℓ2 = ℓ1
sin α2
sin α1
,
ℓ3 = ℓ1
sin α3
sin α1
(6.23)
as well as the identity of pairs of opposite bodies. All joints have zero oﬀ-
set. Four bodies have the parameters ℓ1 , α1 . In Fig. 6.3b the mechanisms
are shown in positions in which they share body 1 with parameters ℓ1 , α1 .
The degree of freedom two as well as the quantities ℓ1 and α1 remain un-
changed when body 1 is removed while preserving all six joint axes (Fig. c).
Indeed, none of the original Bennett mechanisms is mobile with other than
the original quantities ℓ1 , α1 . In the system of Fig. 6.3d one of the two
joints bridging both mechanisms is frozen in an arbitrarily chosen position
β . This results in the Goldberg mechanism with ﬁve bodies and ﬁve revolute
joints. It has ﬁve constant parameters, namely, the four essential parameters
α1 , α2 , α3 , β and the length ℓ1 which merely determines the size.
The bodies are newly labeled as shown in Fig. 6.3d . Body i is the body
of length ℓi (i = 1, . . . , 5). Joint 3 between bodies 2 and 3 is the mobile
joint bridging the two Bennett mechanisms. Body 5 with joint axes 5 and
1 is the body created by freezing the joint in the position β . The coeﬃcients
Ai , Bi , Ri (i = 1, . . . , 5) in (6.19) and (6.20) depend on the parameters
ℓ5 , α5 of this body 5 and on the oﬀsets h5 , h1 of its joints 5 and 1 . As
preparatory step these four parameters are expressed in terms of β and of
the parameters ℓ2 , α2 and ℓ3 , α3 of the two bodies merged into body 5 .
These two bodies are labeled body 2′ and body 3′ , respectively. The vector
r pointing from axis 5 to axis 1 has the two representations

with the notation familiar from Figs. 5.1 and 5.2. The unknown parameters
are determined from ﬁve Woernle-Lee equations for the loop formed by the
bodies 2′ , 3′ , 5 and by the joints 5 , 1 and the frozen joint. The ﬁve
equations are based on the scalar products n5 · n1 , n5 · r , n1 · r , r2 and
r · n5 × n1 . The ﬁrst four equations are obtained from Table 5.2 :
cos α5 = cos α2 cos α3 −sin α2 sin α3 cos β ,

(6.28)
The ﬁfth equation is the dual derivative of the ﬁrst equation:
ℓ5 sin α5 = ℓ2 sin α2 cos α3 + ℓ3 cos α2 sin α3
+(ℓ2 cos α2 sin α3 + ℓ3 sin α2 cos α3) cos β
= ℓ1
sin2 α2 cos α3 + sin2 α3 cos α2 + (cos α2 + cos α3) sin α2 sin α3 cos β
sin α1
.
(6.29)
From these equations the angle β is eliminated in order to express ℓ5 , h1
and h5 in terms of ℓ1 , α2 , α3 and α5 (Dietmaier [19]). Equation (6.29)
with the expression for sin α2 sin α3 cos β from (6.25) yields
ℓ5 = ℓ1

(6.30)
The diﬀerence of (6.26) and (6.27) is
(h5 −h1)(1 −cos α5) = 0 .
(6.31)
In the general case1 α5 ̸= 0 , the equation yields h5 = h1 . Equation (6.28)
with ℓ5 from (6.30) and with cos β from (6.25) yields
1 Dietmaier investigates also the special cases α5 = 0 , π (axes 1 and 5 parallel). It is
shown that α5 = 0 can occur only when the mechanism is a planar 2-d.o.f. mechanism.
The case α5 = π requires β = 0 , α2 + α3 = 0 and h5 = h1 (arbitrary)

satisﬁed. Taking the ﬁrst set, i.e., (6.19) and (6.20) as example three opera-
tions are carried out which are repeated with the other four sets of equations.

Let in each set of four equations produced from (6.19), (6.20) by cyclic permu-
tation of indices ϕj be the independent variable. Then the other two variables
are ϕj+2 and ϕj−1 where ϕj+2 is the variable associated with constant co-
eﬃcients. Repetition of the same three operations result in Eqs.(6.37) of the
general form
cos ϕj+2 = f(ϕj, ϕj−1) ,
sin ϕj+2 = g(ϕj, ϕj−1)

(6.40)
For a given angle ϕj each of these Eqs.(6.40) has two solutions ϕj−1 . About
the number of solutions common to both equations the following statement
can be made. In the Goldberg mechanism two Bennett mechanisms are con-
nected by joint 3 . A single variable in a Bennett mechanism uniquely de-
termines all other variables in the same Bennett mechanism. Hence a single
common solution exists if ϕj is not ϕ3 . This solution is
cos ϕj−1 = w1v2 −w2v1
u1v2 −u2v1

sin ϕj−1 = u1w2 −u2w1

From the identity of the Eqs.(6.44) it follows that for a given angle ϕ3 two
sets of solutions ϕ1k , ϕ2k , ϕ4k , ϕ5k
(k = 1, 2) exist. For every solution
ϕ2k
(k = 1, 2) the ﬁrst two Eqs.(6.42) determine ϕ5k . Next, with ϕj =
ϕ2k (6.41) determines ϕ1k , and (6.39) determines ϕ4k . This concludes the
analysis of the Goldberg mechanism.

6.4 Kinematical Chains with Six Revolute Joints

It is unknown whether there exist 5R mechanisms other than Goldberg
mechanisms. It was shown that its fourteen essential parameters must satisfy
45 conditions. Starting from the same2 Eqs.(6.19), (6.20) Dietmaier [19] for-
mulated a diﬀerent set of 45 conditions fk = 0 (k = 1, . . . , 45). A numerical
search was made for zero-value minima of the function F = 45
k=1 f 2
k . Start-
ing from a randomly picked point in the 14-dimensional parameter space the
algorithm yields a certain minimum. If this minimum is not zero-valued, a
new search is made with a new starting point. Among the zero-valued minima
found only those are of interest which represent a new type of mechanism,
i.e., neither a Goldberg mechanism nor a degenerate mechanism (planar, for
example). Although Dietmaier tried 2×106 randomly picked starting points
no new type of mechanism was found. This is not a proof, but a strong
argument for the Goldberg mechanism to be the only 5R mechanism.
6.4 Kinematical Chains with Six Revolute Joints
The number of diﬀerent types of overconstrained kinematic chains with six
links and six revolute joints is unknown as well. Many diﬀerent types are
known. Simple examples are shown in Figs. 6.1 and 6.2 . Systematic de-
scriptions and analyses see in Baker [4, 7], Mavroidis/Roth [25, 26, 27] and
Dietmaier [19]. Bricard [10] discovered three classes of mechanisms known
as line-symmetric, plane-symmetric and trihedral mechanisms. They are the
subjects of the three sections to come. Several other types of mechanisms are
obtained by merging a number of Bennett mechanisms or of Goldberg mech-
anisms in the spirit of Goldberg’s construction of the ﬁve-joint mechanism in
Fig. 6.3 (Mudrov [29], Goldberg [20], Wohlhart [31, 32]). Dietmaier [19] found
a new class of mechanisms by the numerical search described above. For six-
link mechanisms the function to be investigated has the form F = 102
k=1 f 2
k
with functions fk depending on eighteen Denavit-Hartenberg parameters.
Dietmaier’s mechanism is the subject of Sect. 6.4.4.
6.4.1 Line-Symmetric Bricard Mechanism
A mechanism having six arbitrarily skew, consecutively labeled joint axes 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 is said to be symmetric with respect to a line z if the geometry
is invariant to a 180◦-rotation about this line. Bricard [10] recognized that
such a mechanism is deformable with degree of freedom one, and that the
symmetry is maintained in the course of deformation. His proof of mobility
2 (6.19), (6.20) and Dietmaier’s Eqs.(3-7) – (3-11) are identical if in the latter ones
( si , θi , αi , ai ) is replaced by ( hi , ϕi , αi−1 , ℓi−1 )

one is as follows. Suppose that body 2 is ﬁxed in some reference frame, and
that the constraints in all joints are removed. Relative to the reference frame
the line z is speciﬁed by four parameters, and the positions of bodies 1 and
3 are speciﬁed by additional twelve parameters. Through these altogether
N = 16 parameters the positions of the other three bodies 4 , 5 and 6 are
speciﬁed as well because of the symmetry with respect to z . Each revolute
joint introduces ﬁve constraints. Because of the pairwise symmetry of joints
the total number of independent constraints is only 3×5 = 15 . The diﬀerence
N −15 = 1 is the degree of freedom of the mechanism. End of proof.
The line-symmetry of the mechanism ﬁnds its expression in the identities
αi+3 = αi ,
ℓi+3 = ℓi ,
ϕi+3 ≡ϕi ,
hi+3 = hi
(i = 1, 2, 3) .

According to Theorem 6.1 the six joint axes are, in every position of the
mechanism instantaneously, lines of a linear complex. Conjecture: The axis
of this linear complex intersects the line of symmetry z orthogonally. The
following proof is due to Hon-Cheung [22]. It makes use of two properties of
reciprocal polars which were established in Sect. 2.7.5 :
(a) The two transversals of any four independent complex lines are reciprocal
polars of the linear complex.
(b) The common perpendicular of two reciprocal polars intersects orthogo-
nally the axis of the linear complex.
Joint axes 1, 2, 3, 4 are line-symmetric to joint axes 4, 5, 6, 1 , respectively.
According to (a) the two transversals of the former four axes are reciprocal
polars and so are the two transversals of the latter four axes. The common
perpendicular p of the former two reciprocal polars is line-symmetric to
the common perpendicular p′ of the latter two reciprocal polars whence
it follows that the common perpendicular of p and p′ intersects the line
of symmetry z orthogonally. But according to (b) the axis of the linear
complex intersects both p and p′ orthogonally, too. Therefore, this axis

and the common perpendicular of p and p′ intersecting z orthogonally are
identical. End of proof.
6.4.2 Plane-Symmetric Bricard Mechanism
Another family of overconstrained mechanisms identiﬁed by Bricard [10] is
referred to as plane-symmetric because of the pairwise symmetry of joint axes
with respect to a plane Σ . In Fig. 6.5 the spatial polygon of vectors hini
and ℓiai (i = 1, . . . , 6) is shown schematically. The symmetry requires the
opposite joint axes 1 and 4 to lie in Σ and to have zero oﬀset: h1 = h4 =
0 . It is left to the reader to verify that the remaining Denavit-Hartenberg
parameters satisfy the conditions (for deﬁnitions see Fig. 5.1)

h6 = h2 ,
ℓ5 = ℓ2 ,

Dissection of joints 1 and 4 produces two symmetrical twin halves of
the system. Consider the twin half consisting of bodies 1 , 2 and 3 and
imagine body 2 to be ﬁxed. Let body 1 be rotated relative to body 2
through an arbitrary ﬁxed angle ϕ2 so that joint axis 1 assumes a certain
position. Likewise, let body 3 be rotated relative to body 2 through the angle
ϕ3 (variable) so that joint axis 4 generates an hyperboloid of revolution
(in the case α3 = 0 a cylinder of radius ℓ3 and in the case α3 = π/2 a
plane every point of which outside a circle of radius ℓ3 is located on two
generators associated with diﬀerent angles ϕ3 ). The ﬁxed axis 1 intersects

two generators of the hyperboloid (of the cylinder, of the plane in the said
special cases) which are axes 4 coplanar with axis 1 . Thus, for every ϕ2 there
are two angles ϕ3 putting the twin half into a position with coplanar axes 1
and 4 . The other twin half is mounted symmetrically thereby determining
ϕ1 and ϕ4 . Thus, not only mobility one of the mechanism is proved, but also
the existence of two positions for a given independent angle ϕ2 . An equation
relating ϕ2 and ϕ3 is derived from the intersection condition of the axes 1
and 4 . This condition is written in the form (see Fig. 6.5)
λn1 + ℓ1a1 + h2n2 + ℓ2a2 + h3n3 + ℓ3a3 + μn4 = 0
(6.61)
with unknowns λ and μ of dimension length. Decomposition of the vectors
results in three equations relating λ , μ , ϕ2 and ϕ3 . Vector coordinates are
copied from Table 5.2. The simplest equations are obtained by decomposition
on body 3 , i.e., by evaluating the equation
λnk−2 + ℓ1ak−2 + h2nk−1 + ℓ2ak−1 + h3nk + ℓ3ak + μnk+1 = 0
(6.62)
with k = 3 . This results in the set of equations

ϕ3 is obtained by evaluating the Woernle-Lee equation based on the product

An equation for tan ϕ4/2 is obtained in the same way by expressing the
product n3 · n1 in the two forms nk · nk−2 = nk · nk+4 with k = 3 . In view
of the symmetry of Fig. 6.5 the equation is directly obtained by interchanging
in (6.67) α1 with α3 and ϕ2 with ϕ3 :

S1(c3s2 + C2s3c2) + C1S2s3

Example: The triple plane-symmetric mechanism shown in Fig. 4.6 is char-
acterized by the parameters ℓ1 = ℓ2 = ℓ3 = 1 ,
h2 = h3 = 0 and
α1 = α2 = α3 = π/2 . This is the special case with a single solution (ϕ1 , ϕ3)

results were obtained in (4.20) and (4.22). End of example.
6.4.3 Trihedral Bricard Mechanism
This mechanism was developed by Bricard [10] in search for a system having
the property that in every position the six axes are lines of a special linear
complex. Consider Fig. 6.6 . The arbitrary spatial trihedral with lines 2, 4,
6 and with vertex A , referred to as trihedral A , is given. Furthermore, a
point B is given. The perpendiculars 1, 3, 5 from B onto the three planes of
trihedral A deﬁne the trihedral B . The construction implies that the lines
2, 4, 6 of trihedral A are perpendiculars of the three planes of trihedral B .
With the labeling shown in Fig. 6.6 the line i (i = 1, . . . , 6 cyclic) is normal
to the plane of lines i −1 and i + 1 . Let P2 , P4 , P6 and P1 , P3 , P5 be
the feet of the correspondingly labeled perpendiculars. They form the spatial
polygon shown in dashed lines. The length of the side PiPi+1 is called ℓi .
The line segment APi (i = 1, 3, 5) which is not shown is hypotenuse in
the rectangular triangle (A,Pi,Pi−1) as well as in the rectangular triangle

Imagine now the lengths ℓ1, . . . , ℓ6 to be rigid rods interconnected by revo-
lute joints at the points Pi (i = 1, . . . , 6). Each joint axis has the direction
of the corresponding perpendicular i . This means that each rod carries two
mutually perpendicular joint axes which are also perpendicular to the rod.
The axes 2, 4, 6 intersect at the single point A , and the axes 1, 3, 5 intersect
at the single point B . Proposition: Every mechanism composed of six rods
and of six revolute joints having these orthogonality properties and arbitrary
lengths ℓ1, . . . , ℓ6 satisfying (6.71) has a single degree of freedom if one body
is held ﬁxed. This is the trihedral Bricard mechanism (sometimes also re-
ferred to as orthogonal Bricard mechanism). As is the case in the Bennett
mechanism each joint has zero oﬀset. Bricard’s proof of mobility one is as
follows. The construction of the system requires the speciﬁcation of twelve
parameters, namely, three coordinates for each of the points A and B and
two direction cosines for each line of trihedral A . Six out of these twelve
parameters determine the dimensions of the system and the remaining six its
position in space. Of interest are only the ﬁrst six parameters. Their number
exceeds the number of independent lengths by one. The single free param-
eter constitutes the single degree of freedom. End of proof. Since in every
position of the mechanism the six joint axes intersect the line AB , they are
lines of the special linear complex with the axis AB . In Fig. 4.6 the special
mechanism is shown in which the six lengths ℓ1 , . . . , ℓ6 are identical.

6.4 Kinematical Chains with Six Revolute Joints
225
A trihedral Bricard mechanism can assume so-called planar positions, i.e.,
positions in which the polygon of points P1, . . . ,P6 is planar. In these positions
three joint axes are normal to the plane. They intersect at inﬁnity. The other
three joint axes are lying in the plane. They either intersect at a single point
or are parallel. The two rods coupled by any of these three joints are collinear.
From this it follows that every planar position of the mechanism creates a
triangle of rods in the plane. In order to ﬁnd all planar positions with collinear
pairs of rods, say pairs (1,2), (3,4) and (5,6), the altogether eight combinations
of sums and diﬀerences |ℓ1 ± ℓ2| , |ℓ3 ± ℓ4| and |ℓ5 ± ℓ6| are calculated. Each
combination is checked whether it satisﬁes the triangle-inequalities. In the
same way all planar positions with collinear pairs of rods (2,3), (4,5) and (6,1)
are determined. With at least four of the altogether sixteen combinations of
sums and diﬀerences the triangle-inequalities are satisﬁed. The proof is left
to the reader. It makes use of (6.71).
Example: The mechanism with lengths (ℓ1, ℓ2, ℓ3, ℓ4, ℓ5, ℓ6) = (16, 3, 9, 17,
5, 8) has the eight planar positions shown in Figs. 6.7a-h . In Fig. 6.7d all
six rods are collinear, and the intersection points of both triples of joint axes
are at inﬁnity. End of example.
The ﬁgures reveal the existence of two diﬀerent types of trihedral mecha-
nisms. In Figs. 6.7a-d the number of diﬀerences of lengths in the triangle is
odd, and in Figs. 6.7e-h the number of sums of lengths is odd. According to
the rules in Fig. 5.1 the following quantities are deﬁned:
– unit vectors n1 , . . . , n6 along the joint axes (sense of direction arbitrary)
– vectors ℓiai = −−→
PiPi+1 (i = 1, . . . , 6)
– constant angles αi and joint variables ϕi (i = 1, . . . , 6) .
The angles α1 , . . . , α6 are either +π/2 or −π/2 . Simple inspection reveals
that, no matter how n1 , . . . , n6 are directed, the number of positive angles
αi = +π/2 is even in Figs. 6.7a-d and odd in Figs. 6.7e-h . Wohlhart [33] who
presented the ﬁrst complete kinematics analysis speaks of a type 2 mecha-
nism in the former case and of a type 1 mechanism in the latter. A type 2
mechanism is obtained from type 1 and vice versa by opening one joint and
by closing it again after giving one of the neighboring bodies a 180◦-rotation
about a normal to the joint axis.
Let n1 , . . . , n6 be directed such that αi = +π/2 (i = 1, . . . , 6) in type
2 , and that α1 = α3 = α5 = +π/2 ,
α2 = α4 = α6 = −π/2 in type
1 . With the usual notation Ci = cos αi ,
Si = sin αi
this means that
Ci = 0

Si = +1

(k = 6) ,
(6.74)
nk · nk−3 = nk · nk+3
(k = 6) .
(6.75)
The third equation is based on the product r·n6×n4 with r being the vector
pointing from P6 to P4 . Since r , n6 and n4 are coplanar, the Woernle-Lee
equation splits into two equations:
(ℓ6ak + ℓ1ak+1 + ℓ2ak+2 + ℓ3ak+3) · nk × nk+4 = 0 ,
(ℓ4ak−2 + ℓ5ak−1) · nk × nk−2 = 0 .

By substituting coeﬃcients it is veriﬁed that the square roots are identical:

5) = 0 because of (6.71). Furthermore, by
substituting the expressions (6.82) it is veriﬁed that the third Eq.(6.80) is
satisﬁed by the combinations (ϕ31 , ϕ51) and (ϕ32 , ϕ52) .
The ﬁrst Eq.(6.77) determines for each of the two solutions c3 , s3 , c5
the corresponding cosine c2 and hence two angles ±ϕ2 . The corresponding
cosine c4 is obtained by substituting the ﬁrst expression s2 = s4s5/s1 into
the second Eq.(6.80) and by deleting the common factor s4 . In the same way
the corresponding cosine c6 is obtained from the second expression for s2 in
combination with the sixth Eq.(6.80). The results are
c4 = −λs1(ℓ2c2 + ℓ1) + ℓ4s5
ℓ3s5
,
c6 = −λs3(ℓ1c2 + ℓ2) + ℓ5s5
ℓ6s5
.
(6.83)
The signs of s4 and s6 are determined from (6.77). If s2 changes sign,
also s4 and s6 change signs. These results are summarized as follows. For
every value of ϕ1 there exist four (not necessarily real) sets of solutions
(σϕ2i , ϕ3i , σϕ4i , ϕ5i , σϕ6i)
(i = 1, 2 ; σ = ±1 ). Equations (6.77) and
(6.83) fail in planar positions characterized by either s1 = s3 = s5 = 0
or by s2 = s4 = s6 = 0 . In these cases, the joint angles are determined from
triangles (see Fig. 6.7).
Example: For the lengths (ℓ1, ℓ2, ℓ3, ℓ4, ℓ5, ℓ6) = (16, 3, 9, 17, 5, 8) and for
ϕ1 = 80◦a type 1 mechanism has the solutions
(ϕ2 , ϕ3 , ϕ4 , ϕ5 , ϕ6) ≈(σ36.8◦, 142.9◦, σ48.4◦, 127.9◦, σ27.3◦) and
(σ92.8◦, 67.8◦, σ98.3◦, 83.7◦, σ111.5◦) ( σ = ±1 ). End of example.
Example: The trihedral mechanism in Fig. 4.6 is a type 1 mechanism with
identical lengths ℓi ≡1 (i = 1, . . . , 6). It has four planar positions. Equations
(6.80) reduce to
1.
(c3 + 1)s1 −(c1 + 1)s3 = 0 ,
2.
(c4 + 1)s2 −(c2 + 1)s4 = 0 ,
3.
(c5 + 1)s3 −(c3 + 1)s5 = 0 ,
4.
(c6 + 1)s4 −(c4 + 1)s6 = 0 ,
5.
(c1 + 1)s5 −(c5 + 1)s1 = 0 ,
6.
(c2 + 1)s6 −(c6 + 1)s2 = 0 .

For a given angle ϕ1 these equations and (6.77) have a single solution only,
namely, ϕ3 = ϕ5 = ϕ1 , ϕ4 = ϕ6 = ϕ2 and c1 + c1c2 + c2 = 0 . Except for
slightly diﬀerent deﬁnitions of angles, the same results were obtained in (4.20)
and (4.22). Compare also the ﬁrst Eq.(6.84) with (4.23). End of example.
With six rods of mutually diﬀerent lengths altogether six diﬀerent se-
quences and with each sequence both types of mechanism can be formed. In
general, the numbers of planar positions are diﬀerent for diﬀerent sequences
and for diﬀerent types. Example: The sequence of lengths in Figs. 6.7a-h is

6.4 Kinematical Chains with Six Revolute Joints
229
the ﬁrst of the following six sequences which represent all possible mecha-
nisms which can be formed with these lengths:
(16, 3, 9, 17, 5, 8)
(16, 8, 9, 17, 5, 3)
 
(a) ,
(16, 17, 9, 8, 5, 3)
(16, 17, 9, 3, 5, 8)
 
(b) ,
(16, 8, 9, 3, 5, 17)
(16, 3, 9, 8, 5, 17)
 
(c) .
It is left to the reader to verify the following statements. With each of the se-
quences (a) both types have four planar positions. With each of the sequences
(b) both types have two planar positions. With each of the sequences (c) there
are two planar positions of type 1 and three of type 2 .
Condition (6.71) is A + B + C = 0
with
A = (ℓ1 −ℓ2)(ℓ1 + ℓ2) ,
B = (ℓ3 −ℓ4)(ℓ3 + ℓ4) , C = (ℓ5 −ℓ6)(ℓ5 + ℓ6) . Nonzero integer solutions
(ℓ1, ℓ2, ℓ3, ℓ4, ℓ5, ℓ6) are obtained from numbers A , B , C = −(A + B) which
are products of two diﬀerent even or two diﬀerent odd numbers. Example:
A = 2 · 8 , B = 1 · 17 , C = −1 · 33 = −3 · 11 yield (ℓ1, ℓ2, ℓ3, ℓ4, ℓ5, ℓ6) =
(5, 3, 9, 8, 16, 17) and (5, 3, 9, 8, 4, 7) .
Condition (6.71) is satisﬁed by the lengths ℓ1 = a , ℓ2 = a + b , ℓ3 =
a + 2b + c , ℓ4 = a + c , ℓ5 = a + b + 2c , ℓ6 = a + 2b + 2c (a, b, c arbitrary).
Example: a = b = 1 , c = 2 yield (ℓ1, ℓ2, ℓ3, ℓ4, ℓ5, ℓ6) = (1, 2, 5, 3, 6, 7) . The
mechanism with these lengths has seven planar positions (four of type 2 ).
In one planar position of type 1 and in one of type 2 all six lengths are
collinear.
6.4.4 Dietmaier’s Mechanism
The ideas and results presented in this section are due to Dietmaier [19]. The
analysis of the 7R mechanism in Sect. 5.4.7 resulted in a 16th-order equation
for the variable x1 = tan ϕ1/2 with coeﬃcients depending on the variable ϕ7
and on constant Denavit-Hartenberg parameters. A prescribed value of ϕ7
(arbitrary) determines up to sixteen real roots x1 . The 16th-order equation
describes a 6R mechanism when the parameters and variables of body 7
and of joint 7 are set equal to zero: ℓ7 = h7 = 0 , α7 = 0 , ϕ7 ≡0 (see Fig.
5.7 ). This has the consequence that the coeﬃcients of the 16th-order equation
are constants. Since x1 is variable, all seventeen coeﬃcients must be zero.
This requirement establishes seventeen conditions on the Denavit-Hartenberg
parameters ℓi , hi , αi ( i = 1, . . . , 6 ; ℓ1 = 1 without loss of generality). The
16th-order equation remains valid when the indices of all parameters and
all variables are cyclicly increased by k = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . Hence altogether
6 × 17 = 102 conditions must be satisﬁed. Dietmaier’s numerical search
for Denavit-Hartenberg parameters satisfying these conditions led to a new
family of overconstrained 6R mechanisms. The parameters must satisfy the
following complicated symmetry relationships.
1. The opposite bodies 1 and 4 are identical:

230

ℓ4 = ℓ1 ,
α4 = α1 .
(6.85)
2. The opposite joints 2 and 5 have zero oﬀset:
h2 = 0 ,
h5 = 0 .
(6.86)
3. Joints 1 and 3 and joints 4 and 6 have pairwise identical oﬀsets:
h3 = h1 ,
h6 = h4 .
(6.87)
4. Bodies 2 and 3 and the opposite bodies 5 and 6 have pairwise identical
ratios
ℓ2

ℓ3

ℓ5

5. These ratios are subject to the symmetrical constraint equation
ℓ2
sin α2
(cos α2 + cos α3) =
ℓ5
sin α5
(cos α5 + cos α6) .
(6.89)
The last three equations can be used for expressing ℓ3 , ℓ5 and ℓ6 in terms
of ℓ2 , α2 , α3 , α5 and α6 . With the usual notation Ci = cos αi and
Si = sin αi
ℓ3 = ℓ2

ℓ5 = ℓ2
S5(C2 + C3)
S2(C5 + C6) ,
ℓ6 = ℓ2
S6(C2 + C3)
S2(C5 + C6) .
(6.90)
Let ϕ1 be the independent variable. The associated solutions for ϕ2 , ϕ4 , ϕ5 ,
ϕ6 are determined from (5.94) and (5.93) after setting ℓ7 = h7 = 0 , α7 =
0 , ϕ7 ≡0 . The matrices A , B and P are constants. The matrix ur is
deﬁned in (5.80). One out of the four Eqs.(5.94) is solved for x6 . Substitution
into the other equations results in three equations which are quadratic in the
sines and cosines of ϕ1 and ϕ2 . Hence they have the forms
Ai sin2 ϕ2+Bi sin ϕ2 cos ϕ2+Ci sin ϕ2+Di cos2 ϕ2+Ei cos ϕ2+Fi = 0 (6.91)
(i = 1, 2, 3) with coeﬃcients which are functions of ϕ1 . The equations are
fourth-order equations for the variable x2 = tan ϕ2/2 (see (5.60)). Only those
solutions x2 which are common to all three equations determine relevant
angles ϕ2 . Once ϕ2 is known also ϕ6 = 2 tan−1 x6 is known and then
also ϕ4 and ϕ5 from y (see (5.93)). Dietmaier’s numerical investigations
revealed that his 6R mechanism has up to four diﬀerent conﬁgurations for
a given value of the independent variable no matter which angle is chosen
as independent variable. In this respect the mechanism is diﬀerent from all
other known 6R mechanisms.

6.5 Mobile Polyhedra

6.5 Mobile Polyhedra
Euler expressed, without mathematical arguments, the conviction that all
polyhedra are rigid. By this the following is meant. In a polyhedron every
face is interpreted as rigid body and every edge as revolute joint. Nonrigid
means that the polyhedron is a mobile mechanism. Cauchy proved that all
convex polyhedra are, indeed, rigid (see Demaine/O’Rourke [17]). Bricard [10]
constructed mobile nonconvex octahedra which are self-intersecting. Connelly
constructed the ﬁrst nonconvex polyhedron capable of moving without self-
intersection. Stimulated by this achievement Steﬀen constructed simpler ones
(see Connelly [14]). The simplest one is constructed as follows (see Fig. 6.8).
Starting point is the rigid isosceles triangle (A1, 0,A2) in the plane E with
leg lengths ℓand with vertex angle α . On the perpendicular to E through
0 the point B1 is marked at an arbitrary distance h from 0 . Rods of equal
length a connect A1 and A2 with B1 . Two more rods of equal length b
connect A1 and A2 with a point B2 on the dashed bisector of the angle
α . In the next step, congruent triangles (A1,B1,C1) and (A1,B2,C1) are
constructed as follows. To B1 a rod of length b is attached and to B2 a rod
of length a . The point C1 connecting these rods is located on a circle in a
plane normal to the line B1B2 and with its center on this line. With a given
length A1C1 = c (arbitrary) there are two possible locations for C1 . One of
them is chosen arbitrarily. Let C∗
1 be the other point not chosen. Repetition
of this construction produces two more triangles (A2,B1,C2) and (A2,B2,C2)
which are congruent to the previous ones. Of the two possible locations for C2
the one is chosen with which the dashed line C1C2 is not parallel to A1A2 .
Let C∗
2 be the other point not chosen.

6 Overconstrained Mechanisms
Now, imagine the connections of rods at the points A1 , A2 , B1 and B2
to be spherical joints. The system thus deﬁned has the degree of freedom
one. The rigid isosceles triangle (A1,A2,B2) can rotate (in a limited angular
range) about its base line A1A2 . This rotation forces C1 and C2 to move
along certain trajectories. During this motion the distance of these two points
is not constant. Now, C1 and C2 are connected by a rod of ﬁxed length d .
In order to restore the degree of freedom the angle α is made variable by
connecting the rods 0A1 and 0A2 at 0 by a spherical joint.
The 1-d.o.f. system thus constructed consists of the rigid triangles (0,A1,B1),
(0,A2,B1), (A1,B1,C1), (A1,B2,C1), (A2,B1,C2), (A2,B2,C2), (B1,C1,C2)
and (B2,C1,C2). This system is one half of the desired polyhedron. The other
half is obtained in two steps. First step: The existing halfpolyhedron - placed
in the position with B2 in E - is reﬂected in E . Second step: The reﬂections
of C1 and C2 are replaced by the reﬂections of C∗
1 and of C∗
2 , respectively.
With the reﬂection B′
1 of B1 the triangular faces (B1,B′
1,A1) and (B1,B′
1,A2)
of the polyhedron are produced.
With suitably chosen lengths h , a , b , c , d B2 is able to move along a
short segment of a trajectory on either side of E without causing a collision
of faces of the polyhedron. In [14] the lengths are proposed: 2h = 17 , a =
12 , b = 10 , c = 5 , d = 11 . The polyhedron can be produced by folding
the symmetric ﬁgure shown in Fig. 6.9 . The polyhedron has n = 14 faces
(bodies) and m = 21 edges (revolute joints). With these numbers Gr¨ubler’s
formula (4.1) yields the degree of freedom F = −27+d . Since F equals one,
the system of altogether 5 × 21 constraint equations has the defect d = 28 .

6.6 RRCRP Mechanism
233
6.6 RRCRP Mechanism
A closed kinematic chain RRCRP has six joint variables. Hence it is rigid
unless it is overconstrained. It will be seen that the special chain shown
in Fig. 6.10 is overconstrained with degree of freedom one. The assembly
position shown is characterized as follows. The axis of the revolute R4 is
orthogonal to the x, y-plane of the frame-ﬁxed x, y, z-system with origin 0 .
The other four joint axes are in this plane (the prismatic joint P parallel
to the revolute R1 at y = ℓ= const; the axes of the revolutes R1 and
R2 and of the cylindrical joint C intersecting at 0 ; R1 and R2 under an
angle α = const and R2 and C orthogonally). After a rotation through ϕ1
(arbitrary) in R1 the unit vector n2 along the axis of R2 has the coordinates
n2 = [cos α
−sin α sin ϕ1
−sin α cos ϕ1] . Dependent on ϕ1 the angle ϕ2
in R2 and the translatory variable in joint C can be determined such that
the vector r pointing to the revolute R4 has the required coordinates y = ℓ
and z = 0 . Moreover, the angle ϕ3 in joint C can be determined such that
the axis of R4 has the required direction orthogonal to the x, y-plane. This
proves that the mechanism has the degree of freedom one, and that ϕ1 can
be used as independent input variable. As output the translatory variable in
the prismatic joint P is chosen. Let this be the coordinate x of r . From the
orthogonality condition n2 · r = 0 it follows that
x = ℓtan α sin ϕ1 .
(6.92)
Rotation with constant angular velocity ˙ϕ1 = ω is converted into oscillatory
translation x(t) = ℓtan α sin ωt . The mechanism was used in a pneumatic
saw (see Design and development/scanning the ﬁeld for ideas, Sept.1964,
p.158 ). See also Altmann [2, 1].

6.7 4R-P Mechanism
In the ﬁxed x, y, z-system of Fig. 6.11a
two skew lines n1 and n2 are
ﬁxed. Their common perpendicular of length ℓlies in the z-axis. This axis
is intersected by n1 at z = ℓ/2 (point A1 ) and by n2 at z = −ℓ/2 (point
A2 ). The projected angle α between the lines is bisected by the y-axis. The
lines n1 and n2 are the axes of two cylinders 1 and 2 of equal radius r .
Points denoted B1 and B2 are ﬁxed on the cylinders. More precisely, Bi
(i = 1, 2) is ﬁxed on cylinder i such that the line AiBi is orthogonal to both
ni and z-axis, and that, furthermore, B1 and B2 are, in the projection
shown, on a line parallel to the y-axis and at equal distances from the x-
axis. Imagine now that both cylinders are rotated about their axes through
identical angles ϕ (arbitrary). This causes B1 and B2 to move on their
respective circles to new positions B′
1 , B′
2 . The displacements in z-direction
are identical, namely, u = r sin ϕ , and also the displacements in x-direction
are identical, namely,
r(1 −cos ϕ ) . In the projection shown the distance
between B′
1 and B′
2 is δ = 2r cos ϕ sin α/2 . The generator of cylinder i
passing through B′
i is called n′
i (i = 1, 2). In Fig. 6.11b the essential points
and lines are shown in the projection along the x-axis. In this projection, the
axes and generators of the cylinders are shown as lines parallel to the y-axis.
Through B′
1 and B′
2 lines B′
1C1 and B′
2C2 of equal lengths ℓ/2 are drawn
parallel to the z-axis. The line p through C1 and C2 is (not only in this
projection) parallel to the y-axis.
Imagine now that A1A2 , A1B′
1 , A2B′
2 , B′
1C1 and B′
2C2 are rigid
links which are interconnected by four revolute joints with pairwise paral-
lel axes n1 , n′
1 and n2 , n′
2 and by a prismatic joint with the axis p .
The result is a spatial overconstrained single-degree-of-freedom mechanism

6.8 Bricard-Borel Mechanism
235
4R-P with only ﬁve joint variables. The variable ϕ is identical in all four
revolute joints. The joint variable in the prismatic joint is δ . It is indepen-
dent of ℓ. This mechanism was described ﬁrst by Mavroidis/Roth [27]
(see
also Mavroidis/Beddows [28] ). The links need not have the shapes shown
in the ﬁgures. Every link can be given any shape provided its two Denavit-
Hartenberg parameters (length of the common perpendicular and projected
angle of the two joint axes on the link) have the correct values. The link
coupling the parallel axes n1 and n′
1 , for example, can be placed anywhere
between these axes. With this freedom of design it is possible to achieve full-
cycle mobility in the revolute joints without collision of links and joint axes.
The prismatic joint must be designed such that the passage through δ = 0
is possible. In the special case α = 0 , the mechanism is the planar foldable
four-bar in parallelogram conﬁguration.
The mechanism is a simple means of converting the angular velocity
˙ϕ
about the ﬁxed input axis n1 into an identical angular velocity about the
ﬁxed skew output axis n2 the location of which can be freely chosen by
specifying the two design parameters α and ℓ. The mechanism is simpler
and less expensive than a set of hypoid gears serving the same purpose. This
is particularly true when ℓis large. However, like the planar foldable four-
bar the mechanism is not well suited for transmitting a large torque from the
input to the output axis.
6.8 Bricard-Borel Mechanism
The system shown in Fig. 6.12a consists of two parallel circular discs 1 and
2 (radii R1 and r1 ̸= R1 arbitrary) and of n ≥5 rods of equal length ℓ1
connecting the discs. The rods are generators of a frustum of a regular cone.
The system is shown in two projections. The endpoints Pi and Qi of the rods
i = 1, . . . , n are connected to the discs by spherical joints. Disc 1 is a ﬁxed
base. Disc 2 is referred to as platform. Every rod is free to rotate about its
longitudinal axis. This degree of freedom is not of interest. Because of the
symmetry of the arrangement it is obvious that the platform has a single
degree of freedom. It is free to undergo a continuous screw motion about the
vertical z-axis with an independent angular variable ϕ and with a translatory
variable z which is a function z(ϕ) . This function is obtained from Fig. 6.12b
which shows the vertical projection in a position ϕ (arbitrary). In the x, y, z-
system the endpoints P1 and Q1 of rod 1 have the coordinates [R1 0 0]
and [r1 cos ϕ r1 sin ϕ z] , respectively. The condition of constant rod length
establishes between z and ϕ the constraint equation (r1 cos ϕ −R1)2 +
r2
1 sin2 ϕ + z2 = ℓ2
1 . Hence
z(ϕ) =

1) .
(6.93)

236
6 Overconstrained Mechanisms
Fig. 6.12 Platform mounted on rods in positions ϕ = 0 (a) and ϕ ̸= 0 (b)
The same function z(ϕ) is obtained with arbitrary parameters R , r , ℓ
satisfying the conditions
Rr = R1r1 ,
ℓ2 = ℓ2
1 −(R2
1 + r2
1) + (R2 + r2) .
(6.94)
The same function z(ϕ) is also obtained if both endpoints of a rod, i.e., the
entire rod, are vertically lifted or lowered by an arbitrary amount (each rod by
an individual amount). Also, because of the symmetry of the equations, it is
immaterial whether the larger or the smaller radius is located on the platform.
The degree of freedom one remains unchanged if an arbitrary number of rods
each satisfying the said conditions is added to the system. Every point of the
three-dimensional platform can be connected by a rod with a point of the
base which is uniquely determined by the conditions. From this it follows that
every point of the platform is moving on a base-ﬁxed sphere. Platform-ﬁxed
points of the screw axis move on spheres with inﬁnite radius. Conversely,
every point ﬁxed on the base moves on a platform-ﬁxed sphere. All rods
are lines of the linear complex with the given screw axis and with the pitch
p = dz/dϕ . These characteristics of the system were ﬁrst discovered by
Bricard [11] and Borel [9]. See also Husty/Zsombor-Murray [23].

faces, more speciﬁcally the only ruled surfaces having the property that

Hyperboloid of one Sheet
Equations (6.97) reveal the following properties of generators. Two gener-
ators belonging to one and the same regulus are skew. Every generator of

238
6 Overconstrained Mechanisms
one regulus intersects all generators of the other regulus and exactly one of
them at inﬁnity. Three generators belonging to one and the same regulus are
not parallel to one and the same plane. Three such generators determine a
hyperboloid uniquely.
Imagine now that arbitrarily many (in the limit all) generators are rigid
rods. Moreover, imagine that at every intersection point of any two such rods
the respective rods are connected by a spherical joint (in the limit there is a
spherical joint at every point of the hyperboloid). Proposition: The system of
rods thus deﬁned is an overconstrained mechanism having a single degree of
freedom. It can move in such a way that in every position the rods are genera-
tors of a hyperboloid of one sheet. The intersections of all these hyperboloids
with the plane x3 = 0 are confocal ellipses.
Proof (see Bricard [10] and Hilbert/Cohn-Vossen [21]): It must be shown
that the distance of any two spherical joints P and Q on an arbitrarily chosen
rod is invariant under this motion. For this purpose (6.95) is written in the
form

This identity proves the invariance of the distance of points. The mecha-
nism of rods which, in its initial position, is assembled on the hyperboloid
F governed by (6.99) with given constants a3 ≤λ ≤a2 ≤a1 is able to
assume a position in which it is located on a hyperboloid F′ governed by the
same equation with the same constants a3 ≤a2 ≤a1 and with an arbitrary
a3 ≤λ′ ≤a2 .
The hyperboloid with the free parameter λ′ intersects the plane x3 = 0
in the ellipse depending on λ′ :
x2
1/(a1 −λ′) + x2
2/(a2 −λ′) = 1 . Its focal
points are located on the x1-axis symmetrically to the origin. Their distance
is

(a1 −λ′) −(a2 −λ′) = √a1 −a2 independent of λ′ . Hence the ellipses
are confocal. End of proof.
In the limit λ′ = a2 the ellipse degenerates to the line connecting the
focal points. In this case, all rods lie in the x1, x3-plane and tangent to the
hyperbola x2
1/(a1−a2)−x2
3/(a2−a3) = 1 . In the limit λ′ = a3 all rods lie in
the x1, x2-plane and tangent to the ellipse x2

2/(a2 −a3) = 1 .
The hyperbolic paraboloid, too, is a 1-d.o.f. mechanism when all generators
are interconnected by spherical joints at every point of intersection. By the

Hyperbolic Mechanism for the Generation of a Plane
The minimal system of rods constituting a hyperbolic mechanism consists of
ﬁve rods (see Fig. 6.14). Two skew rods g and g1 representing generators of
regulus 1 are interconnected by three rods of constant lengths (generators of
regulus 2). The spherical joints on g and g1 may be placed arbitrarily subject
only to the inequality condition P1P2 : P1P3 ̸= Q1Q2 : Q1Q3 (in the case of
equality the ﬁve lines would be generators of a hyperbolic paraboloid). Every
generator of regulus 2 intersects all generators of regulus 1 and exactly one
of them at inﬁnity. Hence there exist a single generator of regulus 2 parallel

to g and a uniquely deﬁned intersection point of this generator with g1 . Let
Q be this point. When the 1-d.o.f.-mechanism is moving, each joint Qi is
moving on a sphere around Pi (i = 1, 2, 3). Point Q , in particular, is moving
on a sphere of inﬁnite radius, i.e., in a plane E normal to g . Let 0 be the
point where g intersects E . When E and g are held ﬁxed as is shown in Fig.
6.14, the mechanism has the additional degree of freedom of rotation about
g . Hence Q is free to move (in a certain ring-shaped region) in the ﬁxed
plane E . This generation of a plane by a mechanism having only spherical
joints represents a spatial analog to the generation of a straight line by a
Peaucellier inversor (see Sect. 17.13).

The angle α and the length p1
of the perpendicular from the origin
onto the tangent depend on ψ1 . This dependency is investigated as fol-
lows. Through ψ1 the new angle β is deﬁned by the equations
cos ψ1 =
(a/p1) cos β , sin ψ1 = (b/p1) sin β . Together with (6.108) this yields for the
coordinates x1 , y1 associated with ψ1 the expressions x1 = (a2/p1) cos β ,
y1 = (b2/p1) sin β . By assumption, these coordinates satisfy (6.107) as well
as (6.109). Substitution yields the equations
a2 cos2 β + b2 sin2 β = p2
1 ,
a2 cos β cos α + b2 sin β sin α = p2

From them it follows that β = α and, furthermore,
p2
1 = a2 cos2 α + b2 sin2 α = 1
2(a2 + b2) + 1
2(a2 −b2) cos 2α .
(6.111)
A tangent t2 orthogonal to t1 has in its normal form the parameters α±π/2
and p2 . For this tangent (6.111) has the form p2
2 = a2 sin2 α + b2 cos2 α .
Hence p2
1 + p2
2 = a2 + b2 . This concludes the proof.
The angle γ shown in the ﬁgure is determined by

6 Overconstrained Mechanisms
Imagine now that the ellipse is free to rotate about its center P10 , and that
the right angle formed by t1 and t2 is materialized as rigid body with a
ﬁxed center at P20 . Then the ellipse can rotate full circle. In every position
it is in tangential contact with the arms t1 and t2 . The ellipse represents
a cam, and the right angle is the follower driven by the cam. The system
is mobile with degree of freedom F = 1 . Gr¨ubler’s formula (4.2) with n =
m = 3 and f1 = f2 = f3 = 1 yields F = d . This shows that the system
is overconstrained with d = 1 . Manufacturing errors result in the loss of
mobility.
As angular coordinate of the cam the angle ϕ1 from the frame-ﬁxed line
P10P20 to the minor principal axis of the ellipse is chosen and as coordinate of
the follower the angle ϕ2 from the same frame-ﬁxed line to the bisector of the
right angle (ϕ1 , ϕ2 positive clockwise). The ﬁgure shows that γ = ϕ2 + π/4
and γ −ϕ1 + α = π/2 . Together with (6.113) this yields
ϕ1 = ϕ2 + α(ϕ2) −π

with
cos 2α = −a2 + b2
a2 −b2 sin 2ϕ2 .
(6.114)
This equation cannot be solved explicitly for ϕ2 . However, the following
statements are obviously true. The angle ϕ2 is an odd, π-periodic function of
ϕ1 . It is zero for ϕ1 = kπ/2 (k = 0, 1, 2, · · · ). Stationary values of ϕ2 occur
in positions when the principal axes of the ellipse are parallel to t1 and to t2
(the dashed lines in Fig. 6.15). The ﬁgure yields ϕ2max = tan−1(a/b) −π/4
for
ϕ1 = tan−1(a/b) . Diﬀerentiation of both Eqs.(6.114) with respect to
time yields the angular velocity ratio

During the quarter revolution of the ellipse from the position

to the position
ϕ1 = π/2 , ϕ2 = 0 , α = 3π/4
this ratio
changes from the extremal value 2a2/(a2 −b2) through ∞at ϕ2 = ϕ2max
to the extremal value −2b2/(a2 −b2) . This investigation is continued in Ex.

6.11 Heureka Octahedron
In Fig. 6.16a a regular octahedron is shown. It has eight faces 1, . . . , 8 (equi-
lateral triangles) and six corners. Each corner is common to four faces. At
each corner the four faces are grouped in two pairs of adjacent faces. The
pairs are identiﬁed by the face labels separated by a komma. Examples: At
the top corner pairs 1,4 and 2,3 and at the bottom corner pairs 5,8 and 6,7.
Imagine the faces to be bodies pairwise interconnected by identical joints at

the corners (one joint connecting pair 1,4 and another joint connecting pair
2,3 at the top corner etc.). The resulting mechanism has n = 8 identical
bodies and m = 12 identical joints. With f being the individual degree
of freedom of a single joint Gr¨ubler’s Eq.(4.1) yields for the total degree of
freedom of the mechanism the formula F = d + 12f −30 . This is F = d + 6
in the case of spherical joints and F = d −6 in the case of joints with f = 2
(universal joints). In Fig. 6.16b a mechanism with spherical joints is shown
in a slightly unfolded position which is preserving the original symmetry. The
joints are denoted P1 , . . . , P12 . Example: Face 1 is connected to face 2 by
joint P1 , to face 8 by joint P2 and to face 4 by joint P3 . In what follows,
it is shown that the total degree of freedom is F = 1 if universal joints are
employed provided the two axes of rotation of the joint, each ﬁxed on one
of the connected bodies, are properly directed relative to the bodies. In 1991
a very large mechanism of this kind was a major attraction at the Scien-
tiﬁc Exhibition HEUREKA at Zurich. Since then the mechanism is known as
Heureka octahedron. Since it is d = 7 times overconstrained, it became the
subject of scientiﬁc investigations (Stachel [30], Zsombor Murray [36], Baker
[6], Wohlhart [35]). The analysis presented here is diﬀerent.
The Heureka octahedron is a multiloop mechanism. This is seen from the
so-called system graph shown in Fig. 6.17 . Its vertices 1, . . . , 8 represent
the bodies, and its edges 1, . . . , 12 (straight or curved lines) represent the
joints. The appearance of a graph depends on the labeling of bodies and of
joints, on the arrangement of vertices on the sheet of paper and on the shape
chosen for the connecting lines. A well-drawn graph should display structural
symmetries of the mechanism as clearly as possible. If possible, crossings of
edges should be avoided (this is not always possible). The graph in Fig.

Fig. 6.17 System graph of
the Heureka octahedron with
elementary loops I – V
Fig. 6.18 Screw motion of face 1
6.17 is free of crossings and highly symmetric. It reveals the existence of ﬁve
elementary loops I , II , III , IV and V . Each elementary loop is formed by
four bodies and four joints. Other loops present in the graph are combinations
of elementary loops. For proving that the Heureka octahedron has the degree
of freedom F = 1 it suﬃces to prove that a single independent variable
determines the kinematics of all ﬁve elementary loops. The proof is achieved
as follows. First, the triangular face 1 of Fig. 6.16a is considered when it is
isolated from its three neighbors. In Fig. 6.18 it is shown in the ﬁxed reference
basis e . The outward normal to face 1 is speciﬁed by its unit vector n1 with
coordinates n1 = n2 = n3 =
√
3/3 . The circular cylinder with axis n1 which
is circumscribing the triangle intersects the e1, e2-plane, the e2, e3-plane and
the e3, e1-plane in three congruent ellipses. Clearly, it is possible to subject
face 1 to a continuous screw motion with rotation ϕ1 about n1 and with
translation u1(ϕ1) along n1 in such a way that P1 moves along the ellipse
in the e3, e1-plane, P2 along the ellipse in the e1, e2-plane and P3 along
the ellipse in the e2, e3-plane. In what follows, the translatory displacement
u1 as well as the positions of the three points are determined as functions
of ϕ1 . Let the position shown be the null position ϕ1 = 0 , u1 = 0 . Let,
furthermore, e1 be the body-ﬁxed basis which coincides with e in the null
position. In e1 P1 , P2 , P3 have the coordinate matrices R1
1 = [1 0 0]T ,
R1
2 = [0 1 0]T
and
R1
3 = [0 0 1]T , respectively. This deﬁnition of unit
length implies that the side length of the equilateral triangular faces is
√
2 ,
and that the distance of opposite faces of the octahedron (faces 1 and 6 ,
for example) is
4/
√
3 . Let
ri = [xi yi zi]T
be the coordinate matrix of
Pi (i = 1, 2, 3) in e after the screw displacement. It is calculated from the

Closure of loop I at P2 requires that x∗
2 ≡x2 and y∗
2 ≡y2 . This is, indeed,
the case. Equations (6.131), (6.127), (6.125) and (6.119) yield x∗
2 = −z12 =
x4 = z1 ≡x2 and y∗
2 = x12 = −y4 = x1 ≡y2 .
The closure of the other four elementary loops is proved in the same way
by subjecting faces 3 , 4 and 5 to screw displacements about their outward
normals. For reasons of symmetry this is unnecessary. Each loop is composed
of four faces and four joints. In the folded position of the mechanism shown
in Fig. 6.16a two of the four joints coincide in one corner of the octahedron.
In loop I joints P1 and P12 coincide at the front corner with coordinates
(x, y, z) = (1 0 0) . In loop II joints P4 and P7 coincide at the corner
(0 −1 0) . In loop III joints P6 and P9 coincide at the corner (−1 0 0) . In
loop IV joints P3 and P5 coincide at the top corner (0 0 1) , and in loop V
joints P10 and P11 coincide at the bottom corner (0 0 −1) . In every loop
the geometry is the same.
Equations (6.125) and (6.119) express x1 and z1 once in terms of ϕ1
and once in terms of ϕ2 . The pairwise identity of the two expressions has
the form

Hence ϕ2 ≡−ϕ1 . Also for the coordinates of P4 , P11 and P12 two expressions
in terms of two angles have been formulated. They lead to the identities
ϕ7 ≡−ϕ2 ≡ϕ1 , ϕ6 ≡−ϕ7 ≡ϕ1 and ϕ8 ≡−ϕ7 ≡ϕ1 . The general rule is
that screw angles of any two faces coupled by a joint are of equal magnitude
and opposite sign:
ϕ3 ≡ϕ5 ≡ϕ7 ≡ϕ1 ,
ϕ2 ≡ϕ4 ≡ϕ6 ≡ϕ8 ≡−ϕ1 .
(6.133)
These equations in combination with (6.118), (6.124), (6.126), (6.128) and

them outward or all inward):

unit normal vector ( ϕ6n6 = ϕ1n1 , for example). From this it follows that
the motion of opposite faces relative to each other is pure translation 2u(ϕ1)
along the common normal. For faces 1 and 6 this follows also from (6.129),
(6.127), (6.125) and (6.119). In combination they state that the coordinates
of opposite joints of the two faces (joints P1 and P9 , joints P2 and P7 ,
joints P3 and P11 ) are of equal magnitude and opposite sign: x9 = −x1 ,
y9 = −y1 , z9 = −z1 etc. In Fig. 6.16b this is shown.
Through the same Eqs.(6.129), (6.127), (6.125) and (6.119) the coordinates
of all twelve points Pi (i = 1, . . . , 12) are expressed in terms of the coordi-

At both ends of the admissible interval −120◦≤ϕ1 ≤0 the eight faces
form a closed octahedron. At ϕ1 = −60◦the eight faces experience the
maximum outward translatory displacement umax =
√
3/3 .
The motion of the mechanism described above is possible with twelve
spherical joints. What remains to be shown is that it is possible with two-
degree-of-freedom joints as well. This is done as follows. For reasons of
symmetry it suﬃces to consider faces 1 and 2 coupled by joint P1 . Let
Ω21 be the angular velocity of face 2 relative to face 1 about the com-
mon point P1 . It is the diﬀerence Ω21 = ω2 −ω1 of the angular veloc-
ities of faces 2 and 1 , respectively, relative to basis e . This diﬀerence is
Ω21 = ˙ϕ2n2 −˙ϕ1n1 = −˙ϕ1(n2+n1) . The vectors n1 and n2 are ﬁxed in ba-
sis e . The constant angle α between them is determined by cos α = n1 ·n2 .
The coordinates (
√
3/3)[1 1 1] of n1 and (
√
3/3)[1 −1 1] of n2 deter-
mine cos α = 1/3 (α ≈70.5◦) . The vector n2 + n1 and, therefore, also Ω21
is directed along the bisector of this angle. Hence the joint connecting faces
1 and 2 is a two-degree-of-freedom joint with an axis of rotation 1 ﬁxed on
face 1 in the direction of n1 and with an axis of rotation 2 ﬁxed on face
2 in the direction of n2 (see Fig. 6.20). This joint is a universal joint with
nonorthogonal axes intersecting at P1 .
Faces 7 and 6 are separated from face 1 by two and by three joints,
respectively. Let Ω71 and Ω61 be their angular velocities relative to face
1 . These angular velocities are Ω71 = ˙ϕ7n7 −˙ϕ1n1 = ˙ϕ1(n7 −n1) and
Ω61 = ˙ϕ6n6 −˙ϕ1n1 ≡0 . The latter formula reconﬁrms that face 6 is in pure
translation relative to face 1 . The former can be written in the alternative
forms Ω71 = ˙ϕ1(n7 + n6) = Ω76 and Ω71 = −˙ϕ1(n4 + n1) = −Ω41 . These
equations show that the relative angular velocities of all pairs of nonopposite
faces have identical absolute values.
The Heureka octahedron at the Scientiﬁc Exhibition at Zurich would not
have been a major attraction had only the identical screw motions of the eight
faces relative to basis e been demonstrated. Since one face of the octahedron
was ﬁxed horizontally to the ground, not the motion relative to basis e was
visible, but the motion of the remaining seven faces relative to the ﬁxed face.

Viewers were allowed to stand on this face while the octahedron was opening
and closing around them. In what follows, it is assumed that face 1 is ﬁxed.

If the joint at Pi (i = 1, . . . , 12) is a universal joint with joint axes along
the normals of the two bodies coupled by this joint, the mechanism has the
degree of freedom F = 1 . Furthermore, each face i = 1, . . . , 8 moves in such

a way that (i) its normal ni does not change its direction and (ii) each corner
moves in an ellipse in a principle plane of basis e . The idea to generalize the
Heureka octahedron in this way is due to Wohlhart [34]. The proof presented
here is diﬀerent.
For reasons of symmetry it suﬃces to prove the propositions for face 1 . Its
outward normal unit vector has the coordinates (normalized vector product

From the analysis of the Heureka octahedron the conditions are copied that
P1 moves in the e3, e1-plane, P2 in the e1, e2-plane and P3 in the e2, e3-
plane. These conditions plus the stationarity condition of the unit normal
vector require that the displacement of face 1 is a rotation about the unit
normal vector superimposed by a translation which does not have the direc-
tion of the unit normal vector. Equation (6.116) is replaced by the equation

The other two ellipses are obtained by cyclic permutation of indices. In the
special case a1 = a2 = a3 = 1 , which characterizes the Heureka octahedron,
(6.142) – (6.144) are identical with (6.118), (6.119) and (6.121), respectively.
This ends the proof that face 1 is moving in the predicted way. For reasons
of symmetry the trajectories of the corners of faces 2, . . . , 8 are congruent
ellipses. For the same reason, also Eqs.(6.133) are valid: ϕ3 ≡ϕ5 ≡ϕ7 ≡
ϕ1 , ϕ2 ≡ϕ4 ≡ϕ6 ≡ϕ8 ≡−ϕ1 . In joint Pi (i = 1, . . . , 12) the relative
angular velocity of the two coupled faces lies in the plane of the normals of
these faces. From this it follows that joint i is a universal joint with joint
axes along the normals of the two faces. The cosine of the constant angle αi
between the normals is the scalar product of the unit normal vectors. Face
1 is connected to face 2 by joint 1 (angle α1 ), to face 8 by joint 2 (angle
α2 ) and to face 4 by joint 3 (angle α3 ). The same three angles appear in
the joints of each face. The four unit normal vectors involved have in basis e
the following coordinates: Face 1 : [n1 n2 n3] , face 2 : [n1 −n2 n3] , face 8 :
[n1 n2 −n3] , face 4 : [−n1 n2 n3] . With (6.139) this yields

Two-Joint Chains
Figure 7.1 shows a spatial chain of three bodies 0 , 1 and 2 interconnected
by two joints 1 and 2 . Body 0 is referred to as frame and body 2 as
terminal body. Joints are either revolute (R) or prismatic (P) or cylindric
(C). Throughout Sects. 7.1 and 7.2 cylindrical joints are excluded. Chains
with revolute and prismatic joints are classiﬁed by the sequence of joints
(joint 1 , joint 2 ) as RR , RP , PR , PP. Since each joint has a single joint
variable, the degree of freedom of the terminal body is two. In Sect. 7.1 the
work space of points ﬁxed on the terminal body is investigated. Sect. 7.2
is devoted to the problem of synthesis of RR chains capable of producing

problem is solved for chains CC . Chains RR , PP and CC are structurally
symmetric. By this is meant that the structure remains the same if body 0
becomes body 2 and vice versa.

7 Two-Joint Chains
7.1 Work Space of Points of the Terminal Body
On body 0 the reference basis e0 is ﬁxed with its origin 0 at an arbitrarily
chosen point on joint axis 1 . The basis vector e0
1 is directed along this joint
axis (see Fig. 7.1). Let x be the position vector of an arbitrary point Q ﬁxed
on the terminal body 2 . The coordinates x1 , x2 , x3 of x in e0 are functions
of the two joint variables, say q1 and q2 , and of constant parameters of the
chain. The functions deﬁne a surface in e0 . This surface is the work space of
Q . Lines q1 = const (arbitrary) and q2 = const (arbitrary) on the surface
are either circles or straight lines depending on whether the other variable not
held constant is an angle in a revolute joint or a straight-line displacement
in a prismatic joint. Each of the chains RR , RP , PR and PP has its own
characteristic surface. The purpose of this section is to analyze, for each
type of chain separately, the dependency of the surface upon the constant
parameters of the chain.
Parameters and variables are the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters ex-
plained in Sect. 5.1 (see Fig. 5.1). Unambiguous deﬁnitions require a chain
of mutually orthogonal lines along joint axes and lines perpendicular to joint
axes. For body 1 the situation is the same as for body i in Fig. 5.1 . Unit
vectors along the joint axes are called n1 and n2 , and the unit vector along
the common perpendicular is called a1 . Bodies 0 and 2 do not have a sec-
ond joint axis. As lines perpendicular to the existing joint axes the axis e0
2
ﬁxed on body 0 and the perpendicular from Q onto joint axis 2 are chosen.
Let a2 be the unit vector pointing from the foot of this perpendicular to-
ward Q . The lines thus speciﬁed deﬁne the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters
ϕ1 , h1 , α1 , ℓ1 , ϕ2 , h2 and ℓ2 of the chain. If joint i (i = 1 or i = 2) is
a revolute joint, ϕi is variable and hi is constant. If joint i is a prismatic
joint, ϕi is constant and hi is variable. The position vector x of Q is
x = h1n1 + ℓ1a1 + h2n2 + ℓ2a2 .
(7.1)
The coordinates of n1 , a1 , n2 and a2 in basis e0 are taken from Table
5.2 by setting k = 0 . The abbreviations in the table are C1 = cos α1 ,
S1 = sin α1 and ck = cos ϕk , sk = sin ϕk (k = 1, 2) . By deﬁnition (see Fig.
5.1 and Eqs.(5.6), (5.7)), basis e0 is located not in joint 1 but in a joint 0
connecting body 0 to a preceding body −1 . In order to adapt to the present
situation the angle α0 between joint axes 0 and 1 must, formally, be deﬁned
as zero. This means that S0 = 0 and C0 = 1 . With these deﬁnitions Table
5.2 yields the coordinate equations

These equations are the parameter equations of the surfaces to be investi-
gated.
7.1.1 Chains RR Deﬁning Tori
Variables in (7.2) are the angles ϕ1 and ϕ2 . The origin of basis e0 on joint
axis 1 is now placed at the foot of the common perpendicular of both joint
axes. This has the consequence that h1 = 0 . The expression r =

x2
2 + x2
3
depends on ϕ2 only. From this it follows that the surface is a surface of
revolution. It is generated by rotating a planar curve k about the axis e0
1 , i.e.,
about the axis of joint 1 . The generating curve has the parameter equation
x1(ϕ2) = h2C1 + ℓ2S1s2 ,
r(ϕ2)
=

(ℓ1 + ℓ2c2)2 + (ℓ2C1s2 −h2S1)2 .

(7.3)
The trivial case of parallel joint axes (α1 = 0) is characterized by x1 ≡h2 .
The workspace of Q is the ring-shaped area |ℓ1 −ℓ2| ≤r ≤ℓ1 + ℓ2 in the
plane x1 = h2 . In what follows, α1 ̸= 0 is assumed.
The special case α1 = π/2 , h2 = 0 :
Equations (7.3) have the forms x1 =
ℓ2s2 , r = ℓ1 +ℓ2c2 . Elimination of ϕ2 produces for the curve k the equation
of a circle: x2
1+(r−ℓ1)2 = ℓ2
2 . The surface of revolution is the torus generated
by rotating this circle about the x1-axis. In the case ℓ2 > ℓ1 , the circle
intersects the x1-axis. In this case, the generating curve k of the torus is
moon-shaped and pointed on the axis of joint 1 .
In the general case α1 ̸= 0, π/2 , the surface of revolution is a generalized
torus with a noncircular generating curve k (see Fichter/Hunt [2]). The di-
versity of forms is illustrated by the two curves k1 and k2 shown in Fig.
7.2 . Both curves have the parameters α1 = 30◦, h2 = 3
√
3 and ℓ1 = 4 in
common. The only diﬀerence is the parameter ℓ2 = 5 for k1 and ℓ2 = 6 for
k2 . The parameters of k1 satisfy the condition ℓ2
2 = ℓ2
1 + h2
2 tan2 α1 . Under
this condition the curve is pointed on the axis of revolution at x1 = h2/C1 .
The elimination of ϕ2 from (7.3) is achieved as follows. The ﬁrst Eq.(7.3)
multiplied by 2ℓ1/S1 is the ﬁrst equation below, and the sum of squares of
both Eqs.(7.3) together is the second equation.

Suppose α1 , ℓ1 , h2 , ℓ2 are given. From (7.6) the associated parameters
p2
1 , p2 , p3 , p4 are calculated and from these, in turn, three roots μi = ℓ2

(i = 1, 2, 3) . One of them is the prescribed quantity μ1 = ℓ2

of two new chains RR generating the same torus which is generated by the
original chain. The remaining parameters of these new chains are calculated

The ﬁrst condition is always satisﬁed. The second condition is satisﬁed only
in the trivial case when S1ℓ1h2 = 0 . Hence
Theorem 7.1. Every chain RR with parameters α1 , ℓ1 , h2 , ℓ2 satisfying
the condition ℓ1h2 sin α1 ̸= 0 is one out of two chains RR generating one
and the same torus. Both chains have the ﬁrst joint axis and on this joint
axis the foot of the common perpendicular of joint axes 1 and 2 in common.
The theorem is of the same nature as de la Hire’s theorem on the double
generation of trochoids and as the theorem of Roberts and Tschebyschev on
the triple generation of coupler curves by planar four-bars (see Sects. 15.5.2
and 17.8.1). The theorem is in agreement with a statement made at the end of
Sect. 6.2, namely, that in a Bennett mechanism the trajectories of all points
ﬁxed on body 3 are generated by two chains RR .
Example: The curve k2 in Fig. 7.2 is generated by the chain RR with
parameters α1 = 30◦, h2 = 3
√
3 , ℓ1 = 4 and ℓ2 = 6 . Equation (7.10) is
(μ −16)(μ2 −127μ + 482) = 0 . It has the roots μ1 = ℓ2
1 = 16 , μ2 ≈21.93
and μ3 ≈105.1 . The roots μ2 and μ3 yield the parameters ℓ12 ≈4.68 and
ℓ13 ≈10.25 . The parameters associated with ℓ12 ≈4.68 are S12 ≈0.5853
(real angle α12 ), ℓ22 ≈5.12 and h22 ≈5.55 . End of example.

7 Two-Joint Chains
7.1.2 Chains RP Deﬁning Hyperboloids of Revolution
Variables in (7.2) are ϕ1 and h2 . As before, the origin of basis e0 is placed
at the foot of the common perpendicular of both joint axes so that, again,
h1 = 0 . As before, ϕ1 is eliminated by forming x2
2 + x2
3 = (ℓ1 + ℓ2c2)2 +
(ℓ2C1s2 −h2S1)2 . For h2 the expression h2 = (x1 −ℓ2S1s2)/C1 obtained
from the ﬁrst Eq.(7.2) is substituted. The resulting parameter-free equation
of the surface is
C2
1(x2
2 + x2
3) −(S1x1 −ℓ2s2)2 = C2
1(ℓ1 + ℓ2c2)2 .
(7.14)
There are two trivial cases, namely, S1 = 0 (parallel joint axes 1 and 2 )
and C1 = 0 (perpendicular joint axes). In the ﬁrst case, the surface is the
circular cylinder of radius r =

ℓ2
1 + ℓ2
2 + 2ℓ1ℓ2c2 (see (7.3)). In the second
case, the surface is located in the plane x1 = ℓ2s2 = const. The surface is
the manifold of all points on or outside the circle x2
2 + x2
3 = (ℓ1 + ℓ2c2)2 . In
the general case S1C1 ̸= 0 , the surface is a hyperboloid of revolution with
the x1-axis, i.e., the axis of joint 1 , as axis of revolution.
7.1.3 Chains PR Deﬁning Elliptic Cylinders
Variables in (7.2) are h1 and ϕ2 . The basis vector e0
2 is placed parallel to
the common perpendicular of the two joint axes so that the constant angle
ϕ1 is zero (c1 = 1 , s1 = 0) . Then (7.2) has the form
⎡

The coordinates x2 and x3 depend on the variable ϕ2 only. With c2 ex-

The coordinate x1 depends on ϕ2 and, in addition, on h1 . The surface
under investigation is, therefore, a cylinder with the elliptic cross section and
with generating lines parallel to the axis of joint 1 .

7.1.4 Chains PP Deﬁning Planes
As in the chain PR the basis vector e0
2 is placed such that ϕ1 = 0 . Then
(7.15) applies again. But now, h1 and h2 are the variables. The surface
under investigation is the plane x2 = ℓ1 + ℓ2c2 = const.
7.2 Chains RR Leading the Terminal Body Through
Prescribed Positions
This section is devoted to chains RR . Two problems are formulated as fol-
lows.
Problem 1 : Determine the constant parameters of a chain RR capable
of leading the terminal body, i.e., basis e2 , through prescribed positions
1 , 2 , . . . , m in basis e0 . In addition, the joint variables in these positions
are to be determined.
Problem 2 is a relaxed form of Problem 1 : Position 1 is not prescribed.
Only the m −1 screw displacements leading from position 1 to positions
2 , . . . , m are prescribed.
Problem 2 has been the subject of intensive research (Roth [6, 8], Suh
[10, 11], Tsai [12], Tsai/Roth [13], Huang [3], Perez Gracia/McCarthy [4]).
Tsai and Roth based their analysis on the geometry of the screw triangle (Fig.
3.7). They proved that at most three positions relative to each other can be
prescribed arbitrarily. The analysis led to ten coupled second-order equations
for ten unknowns which were then reduced to a bicubic equation with a
single real and positive root. This root proved the existence of two chains
RR . It was shown that these chains form a Bennett mechanism. In view of
what has been said at the end of Sect. 6.2, this result had to be expected.
Perez Gracia/McCarthy [4] combined the analysis of the screw triangle with
properties of the Bennett mechanism, in particular with the fact that ﬁnite
displacement screws of the coupler form a cylindroid (Huang [3]). For the
problem of three relative displacements a system of four coupled equations for
four unknowns was obtained. These equations reproduced numerical results
obtained by Tsai and Roth.
The analysis presented in what follows addresses Problem 1 . The analysis
is based on the principle of transference. According to this principle, ﬁrst,
a rotation problem is investigated. This is the case of a chain RR with
intersecting joint axes. The notation of Fig. 7.1 is used again. Without loss
of generality, the origins of the bases e0 and e2 are placed at the point
of intersection of the joint axes. Furthermore, the basis vector e2
2 of e2 is
directed along the axis of joint 2 . In basis e0 , the unit vector n1 along
the axis of joint 1 is unknown. It is speciﬁed by two angular parameters
ψ and θ deﬁned further below. The unknown angle between joint axes 1

264
7 Two-Joint Chains
and 2 is now called α instead of α1 . The angles ψ , θ and α are the
only constant parameters of the system. Variables are the joint angles ϕ1
and ϕ2 . The altogether ﬁve quantities ψ , θ , α , ϕi
1 and ϕi
2 determine
a position i of the terminal body, i.e., the transformation matrix Ai in
the equation e2 = Ai e0 . Further below, Ai is expressed in terms of these
ﬁve angles. Prescribed positions 1, . . . , m , i.e., prescribed matrices Ai (i =
1, . . . , m ) are determined by 3 + 2m angles (three parameters ψ , θ , α and
2m joint angles ϕi
1 , ϕi
2 ). On the other hand, a direction cosine matrix is
uniquely determined by three quantities (Euler angles, for example). Hence
m matrices are determined by 3m quantities. Thus, there are 3m equations
for 3 + 2m unknowns. From the equality 3m = 3 + 2m it follows that at
most three positions of the terminal body can be prescribed.
In what follows, Ai is expressed in terms of the angles ψ , θ , ϕi
1 , α
and ϕi
2 of ﬁve consecutive rotations carried out in this order. In the position
ψ = θ = ϕi
1 = α = ϕi
2 = 0 basis e2 coincides with e0 . This position
is referred to as initial position of e2 . The position after the ﬁfth rotation
is referred to as ﬁnal position. Each rotation is carried out about an axis
which is the result of all previous rotations. The position of e2 after the k th
rotation (k = 1, 2, 3, 4) is referred to as intermediate position e(k) . As usual,
a rotation is denoted by the unit vector along the axis and by the angle of
rotation. The sequence of rotations and of positions of the body-ﬁxed basis
e2 is as follows:

In Fig. 7.3 all bases and angles are shown. The ﬁrst two rotations position
the axis of joint 1 in basis e0 . The axial unit vector n1 is e(2)

For arbitrarily prescribed2 matrices A1, A2, A3 this equation has two real
solutions ψ1 and ψ1 + π . The associated cosines and sines are Cψ1, Sψ1
and −Cψ1, −Sψ1 , respectively. With ψ1 (7.26) determines two solutions θ1
and θ1 + π . In the same way ψ1 + π determines two solutions −θ1 and
−θ1 + π . The two pairs of solutions (ψ1, θ1) and (ψ1 + π, −θ1 + π) have to
be considered as equal since they determine one and the same direction of n1 .
For the same reason the two pairs of solutions (ψ1, θ1+π) and (ψ1+π, −θ1)
have to be considered as equal. Both of them determine the opposite direction
−n1 . In what follows, only the two pairs of solutions (ψ1, θ1) and (ψ1, θ1+π)
are distinguished. With the pair (ψ1, θ1) (7.24) determines Cα (identical

same way, the pair of solutions (ψ1, θ1 + π) determines the angles ±α + π .

value of i the quantities ci

2 associated with one triple are equal to
those associated with the other triple, whereas the values si
1 associated with
the two triples are of opposite signs. From this it follows that the angles ϕi

associated with the two triples are identical, whereas the angles ϕi

with the two triples are of opposite sign. Since also the associated vectors n1
are of opposite sign, both triples represent one and the same solution. A
second solution is obtained from the triple (ψ1, θ1, −α) . Both solutions are
real for arbitrary prescribed positions of the terminal body.

A2, A3. One out of the three expressions for tan ψ may be 0/0 . Similarly, one out of the
expressions for tan θ may be 0/0 . If Ai is the unit matrix, then (7.24) reads Cα = CθCψ .
This does not represent a critical case

Skew Joint Axes
From the principle of transference it follows that the number of positions
which can be prescribed for the terminal body of a chain with skew joint
axes cannot be larger than for a chain with intersecting axes. Skew joint
axes have a common perpendicular of length ℓ̸= 0 . This length ℓand
the angle α are the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters of body 1 . The unit
vector along the common perpendicular is called a (Fig 7.4). The origin
00 of e0 is no longer located on the axis of joint 1 nor is the origin 02
of e2 located on the axis of joint 2 . The origins are deﬁned by the vector
u from 00 to the foot P1 and by the vector v from the foot P2 of the
common perpendicular to 02 . Furthermore, the bases e0 and e2 are ﬁxed
on their respective bodies such that they are aligned parallel in the position
ψ = θ = ϕ1 = α = ϕ2 = 0 . As before, the basis vector e2
2 is aligned parallel
to the axis of joint 2 , so that in position i the unit vector a has in e2 the
coordinate matrix [ cos ϕi

2 ) = [ ci

2 ]T . A position i of the
terminal body is prescribed by the direction cosine matrix Ai relating the
bases e0 and e2 and by the coordinates of the vector ri = −−→
0002 in basis e0 .
In three prescribed positions i = 1, 2, 3 the vector equations to be satisﬁed
are
u + ℓa + v = ri
(i = 1, 2, 3) .
(7.29)
Deﬁne the column matrices u and ri of the coordinates of u and ri , re-
spectively, in e0 and the column matrix v of the coordinates of v in e2 .
With these coordinate matrices the decomposition of (7.29) in e0 yields the
equations

This is a set of nine inhomogeneous linear equations for the seven unknown
parameters represented by u , ℓand v . The matrices Ai and ri are pre-
scribed, and so are ci

2 as solutions of (7.25). The equations do not have
a solution u , ℓ, v . This means that Problem 1 with three prescribed po-
sitions does not have a solution. Further below the relaxed Problem 2 is
investigated. Before doing so Eqs.(7.30) are derived in a diﬀerent way in
order to illustrate the principle of transference.
Proposition: Equations (7.30) represent the dual part of the dualized
Eqs.(7.19) from which the unknown angles were obtained. Proof: Equations
(7.19) are equivalent to (7.18): Ai = Aϕi
2AαAϕi
1AθAψ (i = 1, 2, 3). The du-
alization of this equation requires three operations.
Operation 1 : The matrix Ai is replaced by (see the transpose in (3.61))

Operation 2 : Of the ﬁve rotations on the right-hand side of the equation the
rotation through the angle α is the only one which is replaced by a screw
displacement. The dual screw angle is ˆα = α + εℓ. This means that the
matrix Aα is replaced by a dual matrix
ˆAα = Aα + εℓBα . For Aα the
expression in (7.21) is available. Dual diﬀerentiation yields

the translation v . The dual transformation matrices associated with these
translations are (I −ε ˜u) and (I −ε ˜v) , respectively (see (7.31)). The result
of all three operations is the dualized form of (7.18):
Ai(I −ε ˜ri) = (I −ε ˜v)Aϕi
2(Aα + εℓBα)Aϕi
1AθAψ(I −ε ˜u)
(7.33)
(i = 1, 2, 3) . Multiplication from the right by the inverse of AθAψ(I −ε ˜u)
yields

2(Aα + εℓBα)Aϕi

(i = 1, 2, 3) . The primary parts of these equations are Eqs.(7.19). These
equations determine the unknown angles ψ , θ , α and ϕi

The dual parts of the equations read

In what follows, the problem of three positions is stated in the relaxed
form of Problem 2 . Instead of prescribing three positions the displacement
from position 1 to position 2 and the displacement from position 1 to
position 3 are prescribed (and, thereby, the displacement from position 2
to position 3 ). Position 1 itself is not prescribed. It is part of the solution.
In order to formulate the problem thus deﬁned a second basis e is rigidly
attached to body 0 . It has the same origin 00 basis e0 has. The constant
direction cosine matrix A in the equation e = A e0 is treated as unknown.

270

The three positions ri (i = 1, 2, 3) are prescribed in basis e . The matrices
ri (i = 1, 2, 3) are now understood to be the prescribed coordinate matrices
in basis e . This has the consequence that the coordinate matrices in e0
are AT ri instead of ri (i = 1, 2, 3). Hence Eqs.(7.30) are replaced by the
equations

The quantities on the left-hand side are deﬁned as before. The matrix A
introduces three new unknowns. Thus, there are nine equations for ten un-
knowns. The equations have, therefore, a one-parametric family of solutions.

Four of these six equations are solved for the unknowns v and ℓ. Substitution
of this solution into the remaining two equations results in two homogeneous
linear equations for the elements of A . Let A be expressed in terms of Euler-
Rodrigues parameters q0 , q1 , q2 , q3 in the form (1.79) and let, furthermore,
q0 be the independent parameter. Then the linear equations for the elements
of A are second-order equations for q1 , q2 , q3 . They are supplemented by
the equation q2
1 + q2
2 + q2
3 = 1 −q2
0 . For a given value of q0 the three second-
order equations determine up to eight solutions (q1 , q2 , q3) and associated
matrices. Every solution A determines v and ℓfrom (7.40), the coordinate
matrices AT ri in basis e0 and u from (7.39).

7.3 Chains CC Leading the Terminal Body Through
Prescribed Positions
This section is devoted to chains CC with skew joint axes. The problem to be
solved is the same as in the previous section on chains RR . To be determined
are the parameters of a chain (or of chains) leading the terminal body 2
through prescribed positions i = 1, . . . , m . The positions are prescribed by
– the position vectors ri ( i = 1, . . . , m ) of the origin of basis e2 in basis e1
and by
– the direction cosine matrices Ai ( i = 1, . . . , m ) deﬁned by the equation
e2 = Ai e0 .
To be determined are
– the Pl¨ucker vectors of joint axis 1 ﬁxed in basis e0
– the Pl¨ucker vectors of joint axis 2 ﬁxed in basis e2
– the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters of body 1 .
What is the maximum number mmax of positions which can be prescribed?

272
7 Two-Joint Chains
These problems were solved by Roth [7]. The method of solution presented
here is basically the same.
The Pl¨ucker vectors of joint axis 1 ﬁxed in basis e0 are denoted n (axial
unit vector) and w . The perpendicular from the origin of e0 onto joint axis
1 is n×w . The Pl¨ucker vectors of joint axis 2 ﬁxed in basis e2 are denoted
N (axial unit vector) and W . The perpendicular from the origin of e2 onto
joint axis 2 is N × W . Since the coordinates of these vectors in e0 depend
on the position i of body 2 , they are denoted Ni (axial unit vector) and
Wi . The perpendicular from the origin of e0 onto joint axis 2 in position
i is Ni × (ri × Ni + Wi) . Let N i be the coordinate matrix of Ni in e0 .
Then
N i = AiT A1N 1
(i = 1, . . . , m) .
(7.44)
Both joint axes are ﬁxed on body 1 . The Denavit-Hartenberg parameters α
and ℓof this body 1 are determined by the equations, independent of the
position of body 2 (see (2.17)),
cos α ≡n · Ni
(i = 1, . . . , m) ,
(7.45)
ℓsin α ≡n · (ri × Ni + Wi) + w · Ni
(i = 1, . . . , m) .
(7.46)
The parameters α and ℓare eliminated by subtracting the ﬁrst equation
from each of the remaining m −1 equations:
n · (Ni −N1) = 0
(i = 2, . . . , m) ,
(7.47)
w·(Ni−N1) = −n·(ri×Ni−r1×N1+Wi−W1)
(i = 2, . . . , m) . (7.48)
Three Prescribed Positions
Let joint axis 2 on body 2 be chosen arbitrarily. This means that the coor-
dinates of Ni and Wi in e2 (identical for i = 1, 2, 3 ) are chosen arbitrarily.
The coordinates of Ni and Wi (i = 1, 2, 3) in e0 are determined by the
prescribed matrices Ai (i = 1, 2, 3). The two orthogonality conditions (7.47)
determine the ﬁrst Pl¨ucker vector of joint axis 1 :
n = (N2 −N1) × (N3 −N1)
|(N2 −N1) × (N3 −N1)|
= N1 × N2 + N2 × N3 + N3 × N1
|N1 × N2 + N2 × N3 + N3 × N1| .
(7.49)
Since the second Pl¨ucker vector w is orthogonal to n , the ansatz is made:
w = A(N2 −N1) + B(N3 −N1) .
(7.50)
Substitution into (7.48) produces for A and B the scalar equations

7.3 Chains CC Leading the Terminal Body Through Prescribed Positions
273
[A(N2 −N1) + B(N3 −N1)] · (N2 −N1) = −n · (r2 × N2 −r1 × N1 + W2 −W1) ,
[A(N2 −N1) + B(N3 −N1)] · (N3 −N1) = −n · (r3 × N3 −r1 × N1 + W3 −W1) .

(7.51)
The symmetrical coeﬃcient matrix has the determinant
(N2 −N1)2(N3 −N1)2 −[(N2 −N1) · (N3 −N1)]2
= [(N2 −N1) × (N3 −N1)]2 ̸= 0 .
(7.52)
With the solutions for A and B the vector w and also the perpendicular
n × w from the origin of e0 onto joint axis 1 is determined. Finally, (7.45)
and (7.46) determine cos α and ℓsin α . The formula for cos α is
cos α =
N1 × N2 · N3
|N1 × N2 + N2 × N3 + N3 × N1| .
(7.53)
These results are summarized as follows. If three positions of body 2 are
arbitrarily prescribed, an arbitrary line on body 2 can be chosen as axis of
joint 2 . This axis determines uniquely the associated joint axis 1 ﬁxed on
body 0 and the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters of body 1 . Because of the
structural symmetry also the inverse is true: On body 0 an arbitrary line
can be chosen as axis of joint 1 . This line determines uniquely the associated
joint axis 2 ﬁxed on body 2 and the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters of body
1 .
Four Prescribed Positions
The Pl¨ucker vector n must satisfy three orthogonality conditions (7.47) with
vectors (N2 −N1) , (N3 −N1) and (N4 −N1) . This requires coplanarity
of the three vectors:
(N2 −N1) · (N3 −N1) × (N4 −N1) = 0
(7.54)
or, in terms of the coordinate matrices N i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) in basis e0 ,
det
0
N 2 −N 1 ; N 3 −N 1 ; N 4 −N 1
1
= 0 .
(7.55)
Because of (7.44) this equation becomes
det
0
(A2T A1 −I)N 1 ; (A3T A1 −I)N 1 ; (A4T A1 −I)N 1
1
= 0 .
(7.56)
This equation represents a third-order polynomial equation in terms of the
coordinates of N1 . All vectors N1 satisfying this equation deﬁne, if attached
to the origin of e0 , a general cone called rotation cone. It is the cone known
from Sect. 1.10 . Every generator of the cone is an admissible ﬁrst Pl¨ucker
vector N1 of joint axis 2 in position 1 of the body.
Let the coordinates of N1 in e0 be arbitrarily chosen admissible coordi-
nates. The prescribed matrices Ai (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) determine the coordinates

274
7 Two-Joint Chains
A1N1 in e2 and the coordinates
N i = AiT A1N 1
of Ni (i = 2, 3, 4) in
e0 . The ﬁrst Pl¨ucker vector n of joint axis 1 is determined from (7.49), and
cos α is determined from (7.53). The second Pl¨ucker vectors w and W1 are
determined from the three Eqs.(7.48),
w · (Ni −N1) = −n · (ri × Ni −r1 × N1 + Wi −W1)
(i = 2, 3, 4) (7.57)
in combination with the orthogonality relationship
w · n = 0 .
(7.58)
The vectors are decomposed in basis e0 . Because of (7.44) the coordinates
of Wi are linear functions of the coordinates of W1 . Hence Eqs.(7.57),
(7.58) represent four inhomogeneous linear equations for the coordinates of
w with known coeﬃcients and with right-hand side terms which are linear
with respect to the coordinates of W1 . For a solution to exist the (4 × 4)
determinant of the complete coeﬃcient matrix including the right-hand side
terms must be zero. Because of the said properties of the matrix this equation
has the form aW11+bW12+cW13 = d with the coordinates W11 , W12 , W13
of W1 and with known constants a , b , c , d . The equation deﬁnes a plane
E1 in which W1 is located. Since W1 is also located in the plane E2 normal
to N1 , the tip of W1 is an arbitrary point on the line of intersection of E1
and E2 . This is expressed in the form W1(λ) = W1(0) + λe (unit vector
e having the direction of the line; perpendicular W1(0) from the origin of
e0 onto the line; free parameter λ ). For every vector W1(λ) Eqs.(7.57)
have a unique solution w(λ) satisfying also (7.58). Since this solution is
linear with respect to λ , it has the form w(λ) = w(0) + λw∗with uniquely
determined vectors w(0) and w∗. Equation (7.46) with i = 1 , w(λ) and
W1(λ) determines the associated Denavit-Hartenberg parameter ℓ(λ) .
The results are summarized as follows. The ﬁrst Pl¨ucker vector N1 of
joint axis 2 in position 1 is an arbitrarily chosen generator of the third-order
rotation cone. This vector determines uniquely a one-parametric manifold of
joint axes 2 with Pl¨ucker vectors N1 and W1(λ) ﬁxed on body 2 as well as
a one-parametric manifold of joint axes 1 with Pl¨ucker vectors n and w(λ)
ﬁxed in e0 . The perpendiculars from the origin of e2 onto the manifold of
joint axes 2 are N1 × W1(λ) , and the perpendiculars from the origin of e0
onto the manifold of joint axes 1 are n×w(λ) . From this it follows that the
manifold of joint axes 2 is located in a plane ﬁxed on body 2 , and that the
manifold of joint axes 1 is located in a plane ﬁxed in e0 .
Five Prescribed Positions
In the case of ﬁve prescribed positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , positions 1, 2, 3, 4 deﬁne
a rotation cone C1 , and positions 1, 2, 3, 5 deﬁne another rotation cone C2 .
The ﬁrst Pl¨ucker vector N1 of joint axis 2 in position 1 is generator of both
cones. Two third-order cones having the same apex intersect in nine real or

complex straight lines. Three real lines mark the ﬁrst Pl¨ucker vectors of the
screw displacements leading from position 1 to position 2 , from position 2
to position 3 and from position 3 to position 1 , respectively. These are the
eigenvectors associated with eigenvalue 1 of the prescribed matrices A1T A2 ,
A2T A3 and A3T A1 , respectively. Since N1 cannot be any of these vectors,
there remain either six or four or two or zero real lines representing solutions
N1 . Let N1 be one of these solutions. The associated vector n is uniquely
determined from any two out of altogether four Eqs.(7.47). The associated
second Pl¨ucker vectors w and W1 of joint axes 1 and 2 are determined
as follows. Four positions 1, 2, 3 and 4 determine the plane E1 described
above in which W1 is located. By the same arguments the four positions
1, 2, 3 and 5 determine another plane E∗
1 in which W1 is located, too. In
addition, W1 is located in the plane E2 normal to N1 . Hence W1 is the
point of intersection of E1 , E∗
1 and E2. Except for degenerate cases, this is
a single point. The second Pl¨ucker vector w of joint axis 1 is determined
by Eqs.(7.57) as before. Also this vector is uniquely determined if W1 is
uniquely determined.
The four- and ﬁve-position theory just described is due to Roth [7]. It is
the spatial generalization of Burmester’s planar four- and ﬁve position theory
which is the subject of Sects. 14.5 and 17.14 .

Stewart Platform
A Stewart platform (or Gough platform; Stewart [9]) is a rigid body which is
connected to a supporting frame by six telescopic legs with spherical joints
at both ends (Fig. 8.1). The spherical joints Qi on the frame have position
vectors Ri in a frame-ﬁxed basis e1 , and the joints Pi on the platform have
position vectors ϱi in a platform-ﬁxed basis e2 (i = 1, . . . , 6). Neither the
six points on the platform nor those on the frame are coplanar or otherwise
regularly arranged.
In a general position ﬁve legs of given constant lengths determine a linear
complex (see Sect. 2.7.4) giving the platform a single degree of freedom,
namely, instantaneously a screw motion about the axis of the actual linear
complex. A sixth leg of constant length which is not a complex line of this
linear complex connects the platform rigidly to the frame. With telescopic legs
of variable lengths the degree of freedom of the platform is six. In addition,
each leg has the degree of freedom of rotation about its longitudinal axis.
This degree of freedom is without interest. In practice it is often suppressed
by replacing one spherical joint per leg by a Hooke’s joint.
Stewart platforms ﬁnd applications whenever the six position variables of
a body must be controllable both fast and with high accuracy. Examples are
grippers of robots, carriers of vehicles in drive and ﬂight simulators and of

work pieces in tool machines. Stewart platforms are also found in the ﬁeld of
vibration control and in micro system technology. When operating a Stewart
platform, positions must be avoided in which all six legs are lines of a single
linear complex. In such positions the platform has at least one additional
degree of freedom which cannot be controlled by actuators in the legs.
Inverse kinematics of the Stewart platform: The coordinates of the vectors
Ri and ϱi (i = 1, . . . , 6) in the respective bases as well as the position of
the platform, i.e., of basis e2 in e1 are given. To be determined are the six
leg lengths ℓi (i = 1, . . . , 6). This is an elementary problem. The platform
position determines the position of the points Pi (i = 1, . . . , 6) in e1 and
with them the leg lengths ℓi = |PiQi| (i = 1, . . . , 6).
8.1 Direct Kinematics of the General Stewart Platform
The problem of direct kinematics is considerably more diﬃcult than inverse
kinematics. It is stated as follows. Given the leg lengths ℓi , the vectors Ri
in e1 and the vectors ϱi in e2 (i = 1, . . . , 6) , determine all positions of e2
in e1 . In what follows, it is assumed that the given parameters are such that
the platform can assume only a ﬁnite number of positions in which the legs
do not belong to a single linear complex.
Husty [2] was the ﬁrst who succeeded in formulating scalar equations for
the determination of all positions of a platform with arbitrarily prescribed
parameters Ri , ϱi , ℓi (i = 1, . . . , 6). His coordinate formulation leads to
expressions which can only be handled by an automatic formula manipulation
program. The method presented here formulates the same equations in vector
form. These equations are compact and simple (Wittenburg [11]).
The unknown position of e2 in e1 is represented as displacement from an
initial position in which e2 coincides with e1 . This displacement is described
by its dual quaternion (see (3.98))
ˆD = (q0, q) + ε(q′
0, q′) .

The unknown quantities q0 , q , q′
0 and q′ satisfy (3.89) and (3.102)

0 + q2 = 1 ,

0 + q · q′ = 0 .

The vector r0 = −−→
0102 joining the origins of the two bases and the square of
this vector are (see (3.104) and (3.101))

In the initial position the platform-ﬁxed point Pi has in e1 the given posi-
tion vector ϱi . Let ϱ∗

of e1 point Q6 . The condition that the legs have prescribed lengths ℓi are

The second term in this expression is transformed as follows:
Ri · [q × (q × ϱi) + q0q × ϱi] = (q0Ri −q × Ri) · (q × ϱi) .
(8.10)
In the ﬁrst term of (8.9) the expressions from (8.6) for ai and r0 are used.
This yields
(Ri −ai) · r0 = 2Ri · (q0q′ −q′

The expression in curled brackets equals zero (note (8.2) and the product
rule (q × ϱi) · (q × q′) = q2(q′ · ϱi) −(q · q′)(q · ϱi) ) . Hence (8.8) takes the
form

These ﬁve equations1 together with (8.2), (8.3) and (8.8) determine the eight
unknowns q0,1,2,3 and q′
0,1,2,3 . Before reducing them to a smaller set of
equations a statement is made about the number of solutions.
Proposition: The maximum number of (real or complex) solutions is eighty.
If (q0,1,2,3, q′
0,1,2,3) is a solution, also (−q0,1,2,3, −q′
0,1,2,3) is. Since these
two solutions determine one and the same platform position, the maximum
number of diﬀerent platform positions is forty.
Proof by Wampler [10]: Deﬁne
zT = [q0 q1 q2 q3] and z′T = (2/ℓ6)[q′
0 q′

zT z = 1 ,
zT z′ = 0 .

(q′

2 + q′2) −(q2
0 + q2) = 0 .
(8.16)
This is the equation
z′T z′ −zT z = 0 .
(8.17)
Also in (8.14) the constant (r2
i +ℓ2
6−ℓ2
i ) is multiplied by (q2
0+q2) . Following
this the terms in the second row represent a quadratic form in q0,1,2,3 . It has
the form zT Aiz with a symmetric matrix Ai . The terms in the ﬁrst row
are bilinear and, consequently, of the form 2zT Biz′ . It is seen that Bi is
skewsymmetric. Equations (8.14) now read
zT Aiz + 2zT Biz′ = 0
(i = 1, . . . , 5 ; AT
i = Ai , BT
i = −Bi ) .
(8.18)
Wampler investigates the more general equations
zT Aiz + 2zT Biz′ −λ2z′T Aiz′ = 0
(i = 1, . . . , 5 ; AT
i = Ai , BT
i = −Bi )
(8.19)
in which λ is a real parameter. With new variables
x = z + λz′
and
y = z −λz′ the products
xT x ,
yT y ,
xT y and
xT (Ai −Bi/λ)y are
formed. Using (8.15) and (8.17) as well as the symmetry of Ai and the
skewsymmetry of Bi the resulting expressions are

(2q′

Proof: Substitute pi = 2Ri −ri and ϱi = Ri −ri and use 4(q′2

yT y = 1 + λ2 ,
(8.20)
xT y = 1 −λ2 ,
(8.21)
xT (Ai −1
λBi)y = zT Aiz + 2zT Biz′ −λ2z′T Aiz′ .
(8.22)
According to (8.19) the expression on the right-hand side is zero. Hence
xT (Ai −1
λBi)y = 0
(i = 1, . . . , 5) .
(8.23)
The eight original equations have now been replaced by the eight new
Eqs.(8.20), (8.21) and (8.23). The left-hand side expressions in both Eqs.(8.20)
are homogeneous quadratic forms, and those in the altogether six Eqs.(8.21)
and (8.23) are bilinear forms. About the number of solutions of such spe-
cial equations a simple statement is made by Bezout’s theory (see Mor-
gan/Sommese [8]). The maximum number of solutions equals the coeﬃcient
of the term α4β4 in the expression (α + β)6(2α)(2β) . This coeﬃcient is
eighty. This number eighty is valid also in the case λ = 0 , although (8.23)
does not allow setting λ = 0 . Because of the implicit function theorem ev-
ery nonsingular solution in the case λ = 0 is associated with a nonsingular
solution in an open set λ ̸= 0 . Since the maximum number of solutions is
eighty in the open set, it is eighty also in the case λ = 0 . This ends the proof.
The proof does not answer the question whether this maximum number can
actually occur. This problem was settled by Dietmaier [1]. He determined pa-
rameter values for which Husty’s equations yield forty diﬀerent real platform
positions.
Reduction of the Equations
In what follows, the original Eqs.(8.2), (8.3), (8.8) and (8.14) for the un-
knowns q0 , q , q′
0 and q′ are considered. In several steps these equations are
reduced to a system of three equations for three unknowns. Equations (8.14)
and (8.3) together represent a system of linear equations for q′
0 and q′ . This
system is written in the form
ciq′
0 + vi · q′ = bi

The coeﬃcients of the sixth equation are orthogonal not only to the unknown
solution q′

c6ci + v6 · vi = 0
(i = 1, . . . , 5) .

Solutions q′
0 and q′ exist if the system of equations has rank four. By as-
sumption, this is the case. One of the four equations used must be the sixth
equation because the coeﬃcients of the other ﬁve equations belong to the
three-dimensional complement of the coeﬃcients of the sixth equation. Let it
be assumed that the equations 1, 2, 3, 6 have rank four. First, the quantity

A frame-ﬁxed reference basis is deﬁned as follows. Its origin is an arbitrary
point in the plane of the triangle (Q1,Q2,Q3), and its basis vector e3 is normal
to this plane. Furthermore, let ni be the unit vector pointing from Qj to
Qk (i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 cyclic). In the ﬁgure only the vector n1 pointing from
Q2 to Q3 is shown. When the leg lengths are given, the triangle (Q2,Q3,P1)
is given, too, and so is the altitude h1 and the foot A1 of the perpendicular
dropped from P1 onto the line Q2Q3 . Let a1 be the position vector of A1
in the reference basis and let, furthermore, ϕ1 be the angle through which
the altitude of length h1 is rotated against the direction of n1 × e3 . Then
P1 has the position vector
r1 = a1 + h1(n1 × e3 cos ϕ1 + e3 sin ϕ1) .
(8.46)
In this expression the angle ϕ1 is the only unknown.
What has been explained for the triangle (Q2,Q3,P1) is valid, with cyclic
permutation of indices, also for the triangles (Q3,Q1,P2) and (Q1,Q2,P3). For
each of them there is an equation of the form (8.46). With the abbreviations
ci = cos ϕi and si = sin ϕi (i = 1, 2, 3) the three equations have the forms
ri = ai + hi(ni × e3ci + e3si)
(i = 1, 2, 3) .

In Fig. 8.2 the side lengths b1 , b2 , b3 of the platform-ﬁxed triangle (P1,P2,P3)
are shown. The rigidity of the triangle requires that b2

(i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 cyclic). Since the vectors ai and ni
(i = 1, 2, 3) are or-
thogonal to e3 , these three equations have the special forms
D1s2s3 + E1c2c3 + F1c2 + G1c3 + H1 = 0 ,
D2s3s1 + E2c3c1 + F2c3 + G2c1 + H2 = 0 ,

From these equations it is seen that if (ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3) is a solution, then also
(−ϕ1, −ϕ2, −ϕ3) is a solution. The second solution is the reﬂection of the
ﬁrst in the plane of the frame triangle.
The third Eq.(8.48) yields

(8.51)
This is a quadratic equation for c2 with coeﬃcients which are functions of
c1 . The ﬁrst two Eqs.(8.48) are resolved for s3 and c3 . With this solution
the equation s2
3 + c2
3 = 1 is formed. This is the equation
[(F1c2 + H1)(E2c1 + F2) −(G2c1 + H2)(E1c2 + G1)]2
+ [D1s2(G2c1 + H2) −D2s1(F1c2 + H1)]2
= [D1s2(E2c1 + F2) −D2s1(E1c2 + G1)]2 .
(8.52)
The quantities s1 and s2 appear only in the forms s2
1 , s2
2 and s1s2 . The
expressions s2
1 and s2
2 are replaced by 1 −c2
1 and by 1 −c2
2 , respectively,
and s1s2 is replaced by the expression in (8.50). The resulting equation is
another quadratic equation for c2 with coeﬃcients which are functions of
c1 . With abbreviations for the said coeﬃcients the equations are written in
the forms
Kic2
2 + Lic2 + Mi = 0
(i = 1, 2) .

This is an 8th-order polynomial for c1 = cos ϕ1 . Its solutions determine
eight (not necessarily real) pairs of angles ϕ1 and −ϕ1 . Merlet [4] gave a
numerical example with eight diﬀerent real solutions c1 thus showing that a
polynomial of degree smaller than eight cannot be found. For every solution
ϕ1 the two Eqs.(8.53) determine c2 uniquely, and (8.50) determines s2 .
Hence ϕ2 is uniquely determined. The solutions s3 and c3 of the ﬁrst two
Eqs.(8.48) determine the angle ϕ3 .

Chapter 9
Angular Velocity. Angular
Acceleration
This is the ﬁrst chapter devoted not to position theory, but to continuous mo-
tion. The essential kinematical quantities are velocity, acceleration, angular
velocity and angular acceleration.
9.1 Deﬁnitions. Basic Equations
In Fig. 9.1 an arbitrarily moving reference basis e1 with origin 0 is shown.
Relative to e1 a body is moving. The body is represented by the basis e2
rigidly attached to it. The origin A of this basis is an arbitrarily chosen point
of the body. Relative to e2 a point Q is moving. The position vectors of Q
in the two bases are denoted r and ϱ , respectively. The ﬁgure shows the
relationship
r = rA + ϱ .
(9.1)
In general, the velocities of Q relative to the two bases are diﬀerent, and
also the accelerations of Q relative to the two bases are diﬀerent. The velocity
and the acceleration relative to e1 are denoted v and a , respectively. They
are the ﬁrst and the second time derivative, respectively, of r in e1. The

velocity and the acceleration of Q relative to e2 are denoted vrel and arel ,
respectively. They are the ﬁrst and the second time derivative, respectively,
of ϱ in e2. In what follows, the basis in which a vector is diﬀerentiated is
denoted by an upper index set in parentheses. With this notation the said
velocities and accelerations are

vrel =

arel =

(9.2)
In contrast to vectors scalar quantities have identical time derivatives in
diﬀerent bases. These derivatives are denoted by dots as usual. The goal
of the present section is to express v and a in terms of ϱ , vrel and arel
and of quantities describing the motion of e2 relative to e1.
The relationship between time derivatives of a vector in two bases e1
and e2 is met frequently and not only with position vectors. For this reason
it is formulated ﬁrst for a vector p of arbitrary physical nature. Let pi
(i = 1, 2, 3) be the coordinates of p in e2. Then

nates in e2 :

1, 2, 3). Diﬀerentiation of this equation in e1 yields

Because of the orthonormality conditions this reduces to aik+aki = 0 (i, k =
1, 2, 3). Hence a11 = a22 = a33 = 0 . Instead of nine unknowns aij there are
only three. These are given the new names aij = −aji = ωk (i, j, k = 1, 2, 3
cyclic). In these terms (9.4) gets the form

The three quantities ωi (i = 1, 2, 3) are interpreted as coordinates of a vector
ω21 in e2. Then

dt e2
i = ω21 × e2
i
(i = 1, 2, 3) .
(9.8)
The vector ω21 is called angular velocity of the body, i.e., of basis e2, relative
to e1. In (9.3) – (9.8) the origin A of e2 does not play any role. Hence the
angular velocity is independent of A . In ﬁgures the angular velocity vector
may be attached to any point of the body. It is not wrong, but sometimes
misleading to talk about the angular velocity about A . This is particularly
true when the body has a ﬁxed point diﬀerent from A .
With (9.8) Eq.(9.3) gets the form
(1)dp
dt
=
(2)dp
dt
+ ω21×p
(ω21 = angular velocity of e2 relative to e1) . (9.9)
This is the desired relationship between the time derivatives of an arbitrary
vector p in two diﬀerent bases. Application to ω21 itself shows that the
time derivatives in both bases are identical. Therefore, the simpler notation
is used:
(1)dω21
dt
=
(2)dω21
dt
= ˙ω21 .
(9.10)
This vector is called angular acceleration of the body relative to e1.
After these preparations the desired expressions for velocities and acceler-
ations can be formulated. Starting point is (9.1) : r = rA+ϱ . The equation is
diﬀerentiated twice with respect to time in e1. The derivatives of rA are the
velocity and the acceleration of the body-ﬁxed point A relative to e1. They
are denoted vA and aA , respectively. For diﬀerentiating ϱ (9.9) is used.
Instead of ω21 simply ω is written. With the notation (9.2) the velocity is
v = vA + ω × ϱ + vrel .
(9.11)
The acceleration a is found by diﬀerentiating one more time in e1. In doing
so (9.9) is applied to the second and to the third vector. Each of these vectors
contributes the term ω × vrel . The resulting expression is
a = aA + ˙ω × ϱ + ω × (ω × ϱ) + 2ω × vrel + arel .
(9.12)
In the special case vrel = 0 , arel = 0 (9.11) and (9.12) express the velocity
and the acceleration, respectively, of the body-ﬁxed point Q deﬁned by the
position vector ϱ :

292
9 Angular Velocity. Angular Acceleration
v = vA + ω × ϱ ,
(9.13)
a = aA + ˙ω × ϱ + ω × (ω × ϱ) .
(9.14)
Since these formulas are valid for all points Q of the body, they describe
the velocity distribution and the acceleration distribution in the rigid body.
These distributions are the subject of Sects. 9.3 and 9.8 .
In (9.11) and (9.12) the rigid-body terms are called transport velocity vt
and transport acceleration at of Q . With this notation the velocity of Q is
v = vt + vrel , and the acceleration is a = at + 2ω × vrel + arel . The term
2ω × vrel is called Coriolis acceleration.
In what follows, the second time derivative of ω and the third time deriva-
tive of r , the so-called jerk j , are formulated. Also these derivatives are un-
derstood as derivatives in basis e1 . They are found by repeated applications
of (9.9). The upper index (1) is omitted. The results are
d2ω
dt2 = γ + ω × ˙ω ,
(9.15)
j = d3r
dt3
= jA + (γ + ω × ˙ω) × ϱ + 2 ˙ω × (ω × ϱ) + ω × [ ˙ω × ϱ + ω × (ω × ϱ)]
= jA + (γ −ω2ω) × ϱ −3( ˙ω · ω)ϱ + 2(ω · ϱ) ˙ω + ( ˙ω · ϱ)ω .
(9.16)
Here, γ is the derivative of ˙ω in e2 , and jA is the jerk of the body-ﬁxed
point A relative to e1 .
9.2 Inverse Motion
The motion of basis e1 relative to e2 is called the inverse of the motion
of e2 relative to e1. Let ωrel and
˙ωrel be the angular velocity and the
angular acceleration, respectively, of e1 relative to e2. These quantities are
determined as follows. Equation (9.9) is solved for the right-hand side time
derivative of p . This is achieved by interchanging the indices 1 and 2 . The
result is ω12 = −ω21 . By deﬁnition, ω12 is the desired angular velocity
ωrel . This yields the ﬁrst equation below. The second equation follows by
the argument used for (9.10) (again ω is written instead of ω21) :
ωrel = −ω ,
˙ωrel = −˙ω .
(9.17)
Next, (9.11) is applied twice, once to an arbitrary point A ﬁxed in e2 and
once to the point ﬁxed in e1 instantaneously coinciding with A . In the ﬁrst
case, the equation is v = vA . In the second case, v = 0 , and vrel is the
desired velocity of the inverse motion. Hence in this case, 0 = vA + vrel .

Combination of both equations yields
vrel = −v .
(9.18)
In the same way an expression for arel is obtained from (9.12). The two
applications yield the equations a = aA
and 0 = aA + 2ω × vrel + arel .
Combination with (9.18) yields
arel = −a + 2ω × v .
(9.19)
Again, the quantities on the left-hand side belong to the inverse motion and
the ones on the right-hand side to the motion. Equations (9.17) – (9.19) are
summarized in
Theorem 9.1. The switch from motion to inverse motion has the conse-
quence that angular velocity, angular acceleration and velocities of arbitrary
points are multiplied by (−1). For accelerations this rule is valid only for
points satisfying the condition ω × v = 0 . These points deﬁne the instanta-
neous screw axis.
9.3 Instantaneous Screw Axis. Pitch. Velocity Screw.
Linear Complex of Velocity
Equations (9.1) and (9.13) describe the instantaneous velocity distribution
in a rigid body at an arbitrary ﬁxed time t . The body point at the position
vector
r = rA + ϱ
(9.20)
with arbitrary ϱ has the velocity
v = vA + ω × ϱ .
(9.21)
The equation is in accordance with the rigid-body property that the velocities
v1 and v2 of any two body-ﬁxed points have identical components along the
line connecting these points:
(v1 −v2) · (ϱ1 −ϱ2) = [ω × (ϱ1 −ϱ2)] · (ϱ1 −ϱ2) = 0 .
There are two special cases, namely,
- pure translation: ω = 0 , v ≡vA for all points of the body
- pure rotation about a point A : vA = 0 , v = ω × ϱ .
In the general case, the velocity distribution can be interpreted as superpo-
sition of the velocity distributions of these two special motions translation
with velocity vA and rotation about A with angular velocity ω .
All body-ﬁxed points along a straight line parallel to ω have one and
the same velocity (diﬀerent for diﬀerent lines). In the case ω ̸= 0 , there

294
9 Angular Velocity. Angular Acceleration
exists exactly one line parallel to ω the points of which have a velocity in
the direction of ω , i.e., the velocity v = p ω with a scalar p of dimension
length. Hence for all points on this line p ω = vA + ω × ϱ . Let u be the
perpendicular from A onto this particular line. Then also
p ω = vA + ω × u .
(9.22)
Cross- and dot-multiplying this equation by ω and using the orthogonality
ω · u = 0 one gets for u and for p the expressions
u = ω × vA
ω2
,
p = ω · vA
ω2
.
(9.23)
If in (9.21) an arbitrary point on the line determined by u is chosen as point
A , the velocity of an arbitrary point located by the vector ϱ is
v = p ω + ω × ϱ .
(9.24)
This shows that the instantaneous velocity distribution is that of a screw
motion, i.e., the superposition of rotation with angular velocity ω about
this particular line and of translation with velocity p ω along the line. The
line is called instantaneous screw axis (ISA), and p is the pitch of the screw.
The velocity v of an arbitrary point not located on the ISA has the direction
of the helix through this point.
In the special case p = 0 the velocity vA and, consequently, the velocities
v of all points of the body are in planes orthogonal to ω . This is the case
of plane motion. It is the subject of Chap. 15 .
In an x, y, z reference system with its origin 0 on the screw axis and
with the z-axis in the direction of ω the velocity of a body-ﬁxed point with
coordinates [x, y, z] (arbitrary) has the coordinates
v = ω[ −y
x
p ]
(9.25)
and the absolute value
|v| = ω

x2 + y2 + p2 . Cylinders
x2 + y2 = r2
( r arbitrary) are surfaces of equal absolute value |v| . Lines parallel to the
z-axis are lines of equal velocity v .
Let E be the body-ﬁxed plane parallel to the z-axis which intersects the
x, y-plane in the line y = ax+b (a, b arbitrary), and let, furthermore, n be
the vector with coordinates [ 1 a b/p ] . When attached to a point P of E
this vector lies in E . From (9.25) it follows that the velocity of every point
P of E is orthogonal to n .
Next, all points of an arbitrarily located body-ﬁxed plane E are deter-
mined which have in-plane velocities. From (9.24) it follows that no such
points exist in planes orthogonal to ω . A plane E is speciﬁed by its
Eq.(2.1) ,
m · ϱ = −1 , and the in-plane condition on the velocities is
m · (p ω + ω × ϱ) = 0 . In terms of coordinates these two equations are

m2x + m2y

y(z) = −my(1 + mzz) + mxmzp

(9.27)
This determines a straight line in E . Its Pl¨ucker vectors and the perpendicu-
lar from the origin 0 onto the line are calculated from two points of the line
(see (2.3) and (2.6)). For convenience, the points z = 0 and z = −1/mz are
chosen. Simple algebra yields the coordinates of the said three vectors (both
Pl¨ucker vectors multiplied by mz(m2

y) ):

The ﬁrst Pl¨ucker vector has the direction of m×(ω×m) . The perpendicular
onto the line is the sum of the perpendicular −m/m2 onto the plane and an
in-plane vector of absolute value pmz/

m2x + m2y in the direction of ω×m .
Substitution of (9.27) into (9.25) yields the velocity as function of z . At
z = −1/mz the velocity has the direction of the line and, consequently, its
minimal absolute value. This minimal value is
|v|min = p ω

(9.29)
This concludes the investigation.
In what follows, the curve deﬁned by those body-ﬁxed points is determined
the velocities of which are directed either towards or away from a prescribed
point A . Without loss of generality, A is placed on the positive x-axis with
coordinates [ 2a , 0 , 0 ] . With (9.25) the condition on the velocity of the point
[x, y, z] is
x −2a
−y

x = z
p .
(9.30)
By eliminating the three coordinates, one at a time, the projections of the
curve onto the planes of the other two coordinate axes are obtained:

x(z) = 2a

The curve is located on the cylinder (x−a)2 +y2 = a2 ; it is passing through
A ; the z-axis is asymptote. Points on the curve on one side of A have
velocities pointing away from A , and points on the other side of A have
velocities pointing towards A . In terms of the polar coordinate ϕ in the
x, y-plane ( tan ϕ = y/x )
x = a(1 + cos 2ϕ) ,
y = a sin 2ϕ ,
z = p tan ϕ .
(9.32)
In the case of plane motion the curve is Thales’ circle (x −a)2 + y2 = a2
over the diameter 0A .
Velocity Screw
The pair of vectors (ω, v) in (9.24) is called velocity screw of the body1. By
writing ω = ωn (unit vector n ) and a = −ϱ it is given the standard form
(ω, v) = ω(n , a × n + p n) .
(9.33)
The vector a is directed from the point having the velocity v to an arbitrary
point of the ISA. The vectors n and a × n are the Pl¨ucker vectors of the
ISA. The scalar ω is called intensity of the velocity screw. The expression in
parentheses is called unit screw. There are two special cases:
The special case of plane motion ( p = 0 ): The unit screw is identical with
the screw axis, namely, (n, a × n) .
The special case of pure translation: Every point of the body has the same
velocity vn with unit vector n . A screw axis does not exist. The pitch is
undeﬁned ( p = ∞according to (9.23)). Equation (9.33) has the form
(ω, v) = v(0 , n) .
(9.34)
In what follows, the general case is considered. The unit line vector ˆn
along the ISA and the velocity screw are written as dual vectors. The former
is composed of the Pl¨ucker vectors of the ISA and the latter is deﬁned as
ˆω = ω + εv :
ˆn = n + εa × n ,
(9.35)
ˆω = ω + εv = ω[n + ε(a × n + p n)] .
(9.36)
These dual vectors are related through the equation (to be veriﬁed by multi-
plying out again)
ˆω = ω(1 + εp)ˆn .
(9.37)
Comparison with (2.29) shows that Eqs.(9.23) deﬁne the axis and the pitch
of the linear complex (ω ; vA) . It is called linear complex of velocity. From
Fig. 2.5 it is known that the complex lines of this linear complex are normals
of the helices, i.e., of the velocities v . Let z be the ﬁrst Pl¨ucker vector of

a complex line passing through the point with position vector ϱ and with
velocity v = vA + ω × ϱ . Orthogonality requires that v · z = 0 . This is the
equation (vA + ω × ϱ) · z = 0 or ω · ϱ × z + vA · z = 0 . In this equation the
deﬁning Eq.(2.25) of the linear complex (ω ; vA) is recognized. The vectors
z and ϱ × z are the Pl¨ucker vectors of a complex line passing through the
null point with position vector ϱ and with velocity v = vA + ω × ϱ .
Theorem 9.2. Every plane not containing a line parallel to the ISA is in-
stantaneously intersected orthogonally by the velocity (the trajectory) of ex-
actly one body-ﬁxed point.
Proof: Every such plane is a null plane. It is intersected orthogonally by a
helix of the screw at its uniquely deﬁned null point and only at this point.
For a plane speciﬁed in the form m·ϱ = −1 the null point is calculated from
(2.36) which, in the present case, has the form
ϱ0 = m × p ω −ω
m · ω
.
(9.38)
In the x, y, z-system used in (9.25) it has the coordinates (1/mz)[ pmy
−pmx
−1 ] . End of proof.
Theorem 9.3. If a straight line g is at one point instantaneously normal to
the velocity (the trajectory) of the coinciding body-ﬁxed point, every point of
g is instantaneously normal to the velocity of the coinciding body-ﬁxed point.
Proof: Orthogonality of the line g to a single trajectory means that g is a
complex line of the linear complex of velocity. In the context of Fig. 2.6 it
was shown that every point P of a complex line is null point of a null plane
containing the line g . The null plane is intersected orthogonally by a helix
at its null point P . Hence also g is intersected orthogonally. A simpler proof
makes use of the rigid-body property. Body-ﬁxed points located on g have
identical velocity components along g . So, if one point has a zero velocity
component, all points have. End of proof.
Theorem 9.3 explains the names null plane and null point. The null plane
associated with a null point P is the locus of points which have zero velocity
components toward P (see Fig. 2.5 ).
Imagine in Fig. 2.5 a sphere of arbitrary radius a centered at the point
P with coordinates [ r , 0 , 0 ] . From Theorem 9.3 it follows that the great
circle in which the null plane associated with P intersects the sphere is the
locus of points on the sphere which have velocities tangent to the sphere.
This is independently veriﬁed as follows. An arbitrary point [x, y, z] on the
sphere has the velocity coordinates (9.25), v = ω[ −y
x
p ] and the local
normal with coordinates
[ x −r
y
z ] . The orthogonality condition is
ry + p z = 0 . This is the equation of the null plane associated with P .
Subject of the following investigation is the motion of a rigid body three
noncollinear points P1 , P2 , P3 of which are constrained to prescribed spatial

curves. Spatial means: The tangents to the curves at the three points are
neither parallel nor are they in the plane of the points. According to Gr¨ubler’s
formula (4.1) the degree of freedom of the body is F = d . Hence without
defect of the system of constraint equations the body is immobile. Let Σ0
be the plane of the points P1 , P2 , P3 and let, furthermore, Σi (i = 1, 2, 3)
be the plane normal to the curve at Pi .
Theorem 9.4. The body is instantaneously mobile with degree of freedom
F = 1 if the four planes Σi (i = 0, 1, 2, 3) intersect at a single point.
Proof: If the body is mobile, Σi (i = 1, 2, 3) is the null plane corresponding
to the null point Pi . Let Qi be the point of intersection of the three planes
Σ0 , Σj , Σk (i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 diﬀerent). According to Theorem 9.3 the tra-
jectory of the body-ﬁxed point coinciding with Qi intersects orthogonally
both the line QiPj and the line QiPk . Hence it intersects orthogonally also
Σ0. Consequently, Qi is the null point of the null plane Σ0 . Since a plane
has exactly one null point, motion is possible if and only if Q1 , Q2 and Q3
coincide in a single point Q0 . In this case, the instantaneous motion is a
screw motion with degree of freedom F = 1 . End of proof.
The instantaneous screw axis is constructed from two pairs of recipro-
cal polars of the linear complex (see Sect. 2.7.5). The lines P1P2 = g3 and
P2P3 = g1 are not lines of the linear complex since they lie in Σ0 without
passing through the nullpoint Q0 . Since g3 is intersected by the pencil of
complex lines in Σ1 and also by the pencil of complex lines in Σ2 , the line g3
reciprocal to g3 , too, is intersected by these pencils of complex lines. Hence
g3 is the line of intersection of Σ1 and Σ2 . It is passing through Q0 . For the
same reason the line g1 reciprocal to g1 is the line of intersection of Σ2 and
Σ3 also passing through Q0 . According to Theorem 2.2 the axis of the linear
complex is the common perpendicular of the common perpendiculars of the
pairs g3 , g3 and g1 , g1 . The pitch of the instantaneous screw is calculated
from (2.32), p = r tan α . The quantities r and α are explained in Fig. 2.5
where P and its nullplane are any of the pairs Pi , Σi (i = 1, 2, 3).
The trajectories of three body-ﬁxed points in the course of an arbitrary
general motion are curves satisfying the condition stated in Theorem 9.4 not
only instantaneously, but continuously.
At the beginning of Sect. 2.7.5 on reciprocal polars (p1, q1) and (p2, q2)
of a linear complex it was shown that the absolute value of p1 in (2.39) can
be chosen such that in (2.41) μ = 1 . Let this be the case. Applied to the
linear complex (ω ; v) Eqs.(2.39) then read:
p1 + p2 = ω ,
q1 + q2 = v .
(9.39)
By deﬁnition, the second Pl¨ucker vector qi of a polar (pi, qi) is the moment
of the ﬁrst vector pi . In the equations the kinematical relationships are
recognized (note that ai = −ϱi (i = 1, 2)):

ω1 + ω2 = ω ,
ω1 × ϱ1 + ω2 × ϱ2 = v .
(9.40)
These equations are proof of
Theorem 9.5. An arbitrary velocity screw (ω, v) with ω ̸= 0 can be repre-
sented as resultant of two pure rotations. The axis of one of these rotations
can be chosen arbitrarily subject to the restriction that it is not a line of the
linear complex (ω; v) . The axis of the other rotation is the uniquely deter-
mined reciprocal polar of the ﬁrst axis.
Further applications of velocity screws and linear complexes see in Chap. 12 .
9.4 Angular Velocity of a Body in Terms of Positions
and Velocities of Three Points
Problem statement: In some reference basis the instantaneous position vectors
r1 , r2 , r3 of three noncollinear points P1 , P2 , P3 of a rigid body as well
as the instantaneous velocities v1 , v2 , v3 of these points are given. To be
determined is the instantaneous angular velocity ω of the body. Since none
of the three points is dominant in any way, it must be possible to ﬁnd an
expression for ω which is cyclicly symmetric with respect to the indices 1,
2, 3 .
Solution: Starting point is the equation
vi −vj = ω × (ri −rj)
(i, j = 1, 2, 3) .
(9.41)
Using this equation the product is formed:
(v1 −v3) × (v2 −v3) = [ω × (r1 −r3)] × (v2 −v3)
= ω · (v2 −v3) (r1 −r3) −ω (r1 −r3) · (v2 −v3) .
(9.42)
The ﬁrst scalar product is zero because of (9.41). If and only if ω lies in
the plane of the three points, again because of (9.41), also the second scalar
product and, consequently, the left-hand side of the equation is zero. For the
moment this special case is excluded. Then the angular velocity is
ω = (v1 −v3) × (v2 −v3)
(r3 −r1) · (v2 −v3) .
(9.43)
When multiplied out, the numerator displays the desired cyclic symmetry.
Not so the denominator. Diﬀerentiation of the rigid-body property (r3 −r1)·
(r2 −r3) = const with respect to time yields the equation
(r3 −r1) · (v2 −v3) = −(v3 −v1) · (r2 −r3) .
(9.44)

300
9 Angular Velocity. Angular Acceleration
The left-hand side expression is the denominator of (9.43). When this expres-
sion is added one more time to both sides of the equation, the denominator
takes the form
(r3 −r1) · (v2 −v3) = 1
2[(r3 −r1) · (v2 −v3) −(v3 −v1) · (r2 −r3)] . (9.45)
This is substituted into (9.43). Then the numerator and the denominator are
multiplied out. This results in two alternative forms displaying the desired
symmetry (see Stojanov [11], Charlamov [4], Wittenburg [14, 15]):
ω = 2
v1 × v2 + v2 × v3 + v3 × v1
v1 · (r2 −r3) + v2 · (r3 −r1) + v3 · (r1 −r2)
(9.46)
= −2
v1 × v2 + v2 × v3 + v3 × v1
r1 · (v2 −v3) + r2 · (v3 −v1) + r3 · (v1 −v2) .
(9.47)
For numerical evaluations (9.43) is preferable. With ω and vA = vi (i = 1
or 2 or 3) Eqs.(9.23) determine the perpendicular ui from Pi onto the
instantaneous screw axis and the pitch p .
If the denominator and, hence, also the numerator is zero, ω lies in the
plane of the three points. Consequently, there exist coeﬃcients λ and μ such
that
ω = λ(r1 −r2) + μ(r2 −r3) .
(9.48)
This ansatz yields
v3 −v2 = ω × (r3 −r2) = λn ,
v1 −v2 = ω × (r1 −r2) = μn , (9.49)
where n is the vector
n = (r1 −r2) × (r3 −r2) = −(r1 × r2 + r2 × r3 + r3 × r1) .
(9.50)
Scalar multiplication of Eqs.(9.49) by n yields
λ = 1
n2 n · (v3 −v2) ,
μ = 1
n2 n · (v1 −v2) .
(9.51)
With these expressions (9.48) has the symmetrical form
ω = 1

The statements made so far refer to instantaneous velocities and angular
velocities at a ﬁxed time t . In what follows, continuous motions are inves-
tigated which are neither planar motions nor motions about a ﬁxed point.
In the course of a continuous motion the ISA generates a ruled surface in
the reference basis e1 and another ruled surface in the body-ﬁxed basis e2 .
These ruled surfaces are called ﬁxed axode Ff (ﬁxed in e1) and moving axode
Fm (ﬁxed in e2).
Proposition: At every point along the common ISA the tangent planes
of Ff and of Fm coincide. Proof: Let km be an arbitrary curve ﬁxed on
Fm which intersects the generators of Fm . Furthermore, let P be the point
which at all times t is located on both km and the ISA(t) (see Fig. 9.2).
Finally, let vrel be the velocity of P along km . On Ff P is moving along
a diﬀerent trajectory kf . Its velocity along kf is, according to (9.11) and
(9.24), v = p ω + vrel . The plane spanned by p ω and v coincides with the
plane spanned by p ω and vrel . Since these planes are the tangent planes of
Ff and of Fm , respectively, also the tangent planes coincide. End of proof.
These statements are summarized in
Fig. 9.2 Velocities proving that at every point of the ISA the tangent planes of the axodes
coincide
Theorem 9.6. (Painlev´e) Every continuous motion of a rigid body which is
neither a planar motion nor a motion about a ﬁxed point can be interpreted
as raccording motion of a body-ﬁxed axode Fm on an axode Ff ﬁxed in the
reference basis. Both axodes are ruled surfaces which are generated by the
ISA. The raccording motion is the superposition of translation with velocity

9 Angular Velocity. Angular Acceleration
p ω along the ISA and rotation (rolling motion) with angular velocity ω
about the ISA.
In Sect. 13.2 Fenyi’s joint is investigated. Its central body is executing a
periodic spatial motion without a ﬁxed point. The raccording axodes of this
motion are determined in analytical form.
From Sect. 2.9 on ruled surfaces it is known that the tangent planes at all
points of a generator are uniquely determined by the location of the striction
point S on the generator and by the distribution parameter δ . From Theo-
rem 9.6 it follows that both axodes have, on the common generator ISA, the
same striction point and the same distribution parameter. In what follows,
the pertinent formulas from Sect. 2.9 are considered again. The parameter
equation of a ruled surface was written in the form (see (2.51))
x(u, λ) = r(u) + λe(u)
(9.54)
with u and λ being free parameters and with e being the unit vector along
the generator u = const (arbitrary). The striction point on the generator is
determined by the value λS of λ at this point. The unit vector normal to the
tangent plane at the point x(u, λ) of this generator depends on λ only. It is
called n(λ) , and the unit vector normal to the tangent plane at the striction
point is called nS . In the projection along the generator the vector n(λ) is
rotated against nS through an angle ϕ(λ) . The vector nS , the parameter
value λS , the angle ϕ(λ) and the distribution parameter δ are, according
to (2.54), (2.55), (2.56), (2.58) and (2.59),
nS = (e × ˙e) × e
|(e × ˙e) × e| ,
λS = −˙r · ˙e

(9.55)
These formulas are not directly applicable to raccording axodes. What is
needed are formulas in terms of the ﬁve kinematical quantities rA, vA, aA, ω
and ˙ω . In what follows, such formulas are developed for the moving axode
(Wittenburg [15]).
The parameter equation (9.54) is replaced by the equation
r(t, λ) =
rA(t) + u(t) + λe(t) . Thus, the parameter u is replaced by time t , and
the vector r(u) is replaced by the vector rA(t) + u(t) to the foot of the
perpendicular from A onto the ISA. The unit vector e along the ISA is
expressed in the form e = ω/|ω| . With this vector and with (9.23) for u
the equation is (omitting the parameter t )
r(λ) = rA + ω × vA
ω2
+ λ
|ω| ω .
(9.56)
From
ω = ω e
and
˙ω = ˙ω e + ω ˙e
it follows that
(ω × ˙ω) × ω =
ω3 (e × ˙e) × e . With this equation the ﬁrst Eq.(9.55) for nS is expressed in

9.5 Raccording Axodes. Striction Point. Distribution Parameter
303
terms of kinematical quantities:
nS = (ω × ˙ω) × ω
|ω × ˙ω||ω|
.
(9.57)
Expressions for λS , for tan ϕ(λ) and for δ are found from properties of the
acceleration of body-ﬁxed points momentarily coinciding with the ISA. The
point coinciding with r(λ) has the acceleration (see (9.14))
a(λ) = a(0) −λ
|ω| ω × ˙ω
(9.58)
where a(0) is the acceleration of the body-ﬁxed point at the foot of the
perpendicular u on the ISA (see (9.23)):
a(0) = aA + ˙ω × u −ω2u = aA −ω × vA + ˙ω × (ω × vA)
ω2
.
(9.59)
Proposition: The acceleration a(λ) lies in the plane spanned by the ISA
and by n(λ) . Proof: The acceleration has a component along the ISA due
to the translatory part of the raccording motion and a component ar(λ)
due to the rolling motion. Consider the rolling motion alone. In Sect. 15.5.2
(Eq.(15.127)) it is shown that the body-ﬁxed point which is in rolling contact
at r(λ) is passing through a cusp of its trajectory with the normal unit vector
n(λ) being, in the limit, the tangent to the trajectory. Hence ar(λ) has the
direction of n(λ) . End of proof. In particular, the acceleration aS = a(λS)
of the body-ﬁxed point coinciding with the striction point lies in the plane
spanned by ω and nS . From this together with (9.57) it follows that the
striction point is characterized by coplanarity of the vectors aS , ω and ˙ω :
aS · ω × ˙ω = 0 .
(9.60)
Substituting for aS the expression from (9.58) with λ = λS results in
λS
|ω| = a(0) · ω × ˙ω
(ω × ˙ω)2
.
(9.61)
Substitution of this expression into (9.56) yields the desired expression for
the position vector rS of the striction point:
rS = rA + ω × vA
ω2
+ a(0) · ω × ˙ω
(ω × ˙ω)2
ω .
(9.62)
This point S is the origin of the canonical reference frame. Unit vectors along
its axes are e = ω/|ω| , ω × ˙ω/|ω × ˙ω| and nS .
Writing (9.58) also for λ = λS and taking the diﬀerence results in the
equation

304
9 Angular Velocity. Angular Acceleration
a(λ) = aS + (λS −λ) ω × ˙ω
|ω|
.
(9.63)
The second term is a vector normal to aS . Hence the conclusion: The striction
point is the point of minimum acceleration on the ISA : |a(λ)|min = |aS| .
An expression for
tan ϕ(λ)
is developed from Fig. 9.3 in which the
collinear vectors n(λ) and ar(λ) are shown in the canonical reference frame.
They are located in the plane spanned by nS and ω × ˙ω . The angle ϕ(λ)
is determined by
cos ϕ(λ) = ar(λ) · nS
|ar(λ)|
,
sin ϕ(λ) = ar(λ) · ω × ˙ω
|ar(λ)| |ω × ˙ω| .
(9.64)
The numerator expressions are with (9.57), (9.58), (9.60) and (9.63)
Fig. 9.3 Vectors n(λ) , ar(λ) and angle ϕ(λ) in the canonical reference frame
ar(λ) · nS = a(λ) · nS = a(0) · nS = a(0) · [(ω × ˙ω) × ω]
|ω × ˙ω| |ω|
,
(9.65)
ar(λ) · ω × ˙ω = (λS −λ) (ω × ˙ω)2
|ω|
.
(9.66)
From these expressions it follows that tan ϕ(λ) has the desired form
tan ϕ(λ) = λS −λ
δ
(9.67)
with the distribution parameter
δ = a(0) · [(ω × ˙ω) × ω ]
(ω × ˙ω)2
.
(9.68)
In (9.65) also a(λ) · nS = aS · nS is correct. This yields the more appealing
formula
δ = aS · [(ω × ˙ω) × ω ]
(ω × ˙ω)2
.
(9.69)
As has already been said, raccording motion of the moving axode and the
ﬁxed axode requires that both axodes have, at every instant of time, the
same striction point rS and the same distribution parameter δ . The moving
axode and the ﬁxed axode exchange their roles when the change from motion

9.6 Spatial Rotation About a Fixed Point

to inverse motion is made. According to Theorem 9.1 this change has the
eﬀect that vA , a(0) , aS , ω and ˙ω are multiplied by −1 . Equations (9.62)
and (9.69) show, that neither rS nor δ is eﬀected by this change.
9.6 Spatial Rotation About a Fixed Point
In (9.21) the ﬁxed point is chosen as point A . Then
v = ω × ϱ .
(9.70)
The ISA is the straight line having the direction of ω and passing through A .
The translatory velocity p ω of the raccording motion is zero. The raccording
axodes are general cones with the common apex A . The cones are rolling
one on the other without slipping. They are generated by the vector ω(t)
attached to A . They are referred to as moving cone (also polhode cone ;
ﬁxed on the body) and as ﬁxed cone (also herpolhode cone ; ﬁxed in the
reference basis e1). The general situation is shown in Fig. 9.4 . Painlev´e’s
general Theorem 9.6 has the special form:
Theorem 9.7. (Poinsot) Every continuous motion of a rigid body about a
ﬁxed point can be interpreted as rolling motion of a body-ﬁxed moving cone
(polhode cone) on a cone ﬁxed in the reference basis e1 (herpolhode cone).
Both cones are generated by the angular velocity vector ω(t) .
This theorem is a direct consequence of the fact that the angular acceleration
˙ω is identical in both cones and that it is tangent to both cones (Fig. 9.4).
Fig. 9.4 Polhode cone and herpolhode cone
When the body has the degree of freedom one, its position is a function
of a single variable, say ψ , and its angular velocity has in e2 coordinates
of the form ωi = ˙ψ fi(ψ)
( i = 1, 2, 3 ). This means that the shape of the
polhode cone does not depend on the initial conditions of the motion. The
same is true for the herpolhode cone. The shapes of the cones can help to
detect unexpected relationships between diﬀerently deﬁned motions. This is
demonstrated by a motion deﬁned in Sect. 10.1 and by the motion of the
central cross in a Hooke’s joint which is investigated in Sect. 13.1.1.

306
9 Angular Velocity. Angular Acceleration
Any two bodies i and j with a common ﬁxed point have relative to each
other an angular velocity. Let ωij be the angular velocity of body i relative
to body j . Then the angular velocity of body j relative to body i (inverse
motion) is
ωji = −ωij .
(9.71)
Three bodies i , j and k (arbitrary, diﬀerent) with a common ﬁxed point
have relative to each other angular velocities ωij , ωjk and ωki . Repeated
application of (9.8) yields the equation
ωij + ωjk + ωki = 0
(i, j, k arbitrary) .
(9.72)
This shows that the instantaneous axes of rotation are coplanar and that
the angular velocities form a closed planar triangle. Because of (9.71) this
equation can also be written in the form
ωij + ωjk = ωik
(i, j, k arbitrary) .
(9.73)
The equation is illustrated by the bevel gear pair shown in Fig. 9.5a . Two
bevel wheels 1 and 2 are mounted in the frame 0 . Their angular velocities
ω10 and ω20 relative to the frame have the directions of the axes. The
relative angular velocity ω21 has the direction of the common generator of
the two pitch cones. These pitch cones represent the ﬁxed and the moving
cone of the motion of one wheel relative to the other. Thus, the directions of
the three angular velocities are prescribed by the design. If one of the angular
velocities is prescribed, the other two are determined by (9.72). The equation
requires that the vector triangle in Fig. 9.5b be closed.
Fig. 9.5 Bevel gear pair (a) and angular velocity diagram (b)
The geometrical construction just demonstrated for two wheels is appli-
cable to arbitrarily complicated bevel gear trains with degrees of freedom
F ≥1 . All wheel axes as well as all generators of all pitch cones are passing
through a common point. Every wheel axis and every generator common to
the cones of two wheels determines the direction of a relative angular velocity.

9.7 The Ancient Chinese Southpointing Chariot
307
This fact in combination with (9.71), (9.72) or (9.73) determines all angular
velocities if F angular velocities are arbitrarily prescribed.
Example: In the bevel diﬀerential shown in Fig. 9.6a with bodies 0, . . . , 4
the gear box 4 can rotate relative to the frame 0 . The bevel diﬀerential
has the degree of freedom F = 2 . The lines with indices ij determine the
directions of the angular velocities ωij (i, j = 0, . . . , 4 ; j ̸= i ) . Any two
angular velocities can be prescribed arbitrarily. Then the remaining ones are
uniquely determined. In Fig. 9.6b the angular velocity diagram is shown.
End of example.

9.7 The Ancient Chinese Southpointing Chariot
Subject of this section is an engineering problem. In Needham [7] it is re-
ported that in China possibly as early as 3000 years ago and with certainty
at about 200 a.C. during imperial processions two-wheel chariots were dis-
played on which a rotating wooden statue pointed its arm due south inde-
pendent of driving maneuvers. In a rather detailed description dated 1107
a gear train connecting the wheels of the chariot to the vertical axis of the
statue is described. In Fig. 9.7 the essential elements of a modern reconstruc-
tion by Lanchester [6] are shown. In the chariot (body 1 ) wheels 6 and 7
are rotating about vertical axes. These wheels are driven by wheel pairs 2 ,
4 and 3 , 5 , respectively. Together with the two wheels 8 wheels 6 and
7 constitute a bevel diﬀerential2. The statue 9 is rotated by the wheels 8 .
The system has only three parameters, namely, the width ℓof the track,
the radius r of the chariot wheels 2 and 3 and the angular velocity ratio
2 In spite of its elaborate character the description of the year 1107 is not detailed enough.
It does not prove the usage of a bevel diﬀerential. In Europe the bevel diﬀerential appears
for the ﬁrst time in the 18th century in clocks

|ω61/ω21| = |ω71/ω31| = i . What are the conditions to be satisﬁed by these
parameters in order to give the statue the desired property?
Solution: The gear train must realize the identity ω90 = ω91 + ω10 ≡0 , i.e.,
ω91 ≡−ω10 .
(9.74)
As representative driving maneuver a circle with radius R about the center
0 and with angular velocity ω10 > 0 of the chariot body is chosen. This
maneuver causes angular velocities ω21 > 0 and ω31 > 0 in the directions
shown in the ﬁgure. The points ﬁxed on wheels 2 and 3 which are in contact
with the ground have, in negative z-direction, the velocities v2 = ω10(R −
ℓ/2)−ω21r and v3 = ω10(R+ℓ/2)−ω31r , respectively. The rolling conditions
require that v2 = v3 = 0 . The diﬀerence of these two equations is
ω31 −ω21 = ℓ
rω10 .
(9.75)
The given angular velocity ratio i yields
ω61 = iω21 ,
ω71 = −iω31
(> 0 in positive y-direction) .
(9.76)
In Fig. 9.8 the angular velocity diagram of the bevel diﬀerential composed of
the members 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 is shown. The directions of all angular velocities
except ω18 are prescribed by the design as shown. The magnitudes of ω61
and ω71 are chosen arbitrarily. They determine ω67 = ω61 −ω71 . First,
ω86 is determined from the vector equation ω67 + ω78 + ω86 = 0 . Next,
ω18 is determined by the vector equation ω61+ω18+ω86 = 0 . Finally, ω91
and ω89 are determined from the vector equation ω91 + ω18 + ω89 = 0 .
The angular velocity diagram reveals the relationship

ω91 = ω61 −1

Hence with (9.76)

The wheels shown in Fig. 9.7 do not satisfy this condition. Note: Precise
functioning of the chariot requires a perfectly even terrain.
9.8 Acceleration Distribution. Instantaneous Center of
Acceleration
The instantaneous acceleration distribution in a rigid body is determined by
(9.14). It depends on the vectors aA , ω and ˙ω :
a = aA + ˙ω × ϱ + ω × (ω × ϱ) .
(9.81)
If ω and ˙ω are not collinear, there exists a single body-ﬁxed point G which
instantaneously has zero acceleration. This point is called instantaneous cen-
ter of acceleration. It is located on the so-called inﬂection curve. This is the
geometric locus of all points characterized instantaneously by collinearity
of acceleration a and velocity v . The name is explained by the fact that
points of inﬂection have this property. The condition is written in the form
a = s ω v , where s is a dimensionless parameter. Explicitly
aA + ˙ω × ϱ + ω × (ω × ϱ) = s ω (vA + ω × ϱ) .
(9.82)
This is a linear equation for ϱ(s) . The center of acceleration G is the point
ϱG = ϱ(s = 0) . For ϱ the ansatz is made:
ϱ = c1aA + c2 ˙ω + c3ω .
(9.83)
Substitution into (9.82) and scalar multiplications by aA , by ˙ω and by ω
result in linear equations for c1 , c2 , c3 :

c1 is linear in s , c2 is of second order in s , and c3 is of third order.
The ansatz (9.83) fails, when A is the striction point S because aS , ˙ω and
ω are coplanar (see (9.60)). In this case, the vectors in (9.82) are decomposed
in the canonical reference frame deﬁned in the text following (9.62). Its basis
vectors are e1 = ω × ˙ω/|ω × ˙ω| , e2 = nS
(normal to the tangent plane
of the raccording axodes at the striction point S) and
e3 = ω/|ω| . The
coordinate matrices of ϱ , ω , ˙ω , vS and aS are written in the forms
ϱ =

x is linear in s , y is of second order in s , and z is of third order. Hence
the projection of the inﬂection curve onto the x, y-plane is a parabola and
the projection onto the x, z-plane is a cubical parabola. With s = 0 the
equations yield the coordinates of the center of acceleration G :

(9.87)
Next, the instantaneous acceleration distribution (9.81) is considered. As
point A the center of acceleration G is chosen. The acceleration is written
as product of a tensor with ϱ :
a = ( ˙ω × I + ω ω −ω2 I ) · ϱ .
(9.88)
This equation shows that the accelerations of all body-ﬁxed points located
on a ray emanating from G have equal directions. Their magnitudes are
proportional to the distance |ϱ| from G . In general, the direction is neither
orthogonal to nor collinear with ϱ . This gives rise to the following problems
(Veldkamp [12]). Determine all straight lines passing through the center of
acceleration all points of which have accelerations which are (a) orthogonal
to the line or (b) collinear with the line.

9.8 Acceleration Distribution. Instantaneous Center of Acceleration
311
Problem (a): Orthogonality means that a · ϱ = 0 , i.e.,
(ω · ϱ)2 −ω2ϱ2 = −(ω × ϱ)2 = 0 .
(9.89)
The solution is ϱ = λ0ω where λ0 is an arbitrary scalar having the phys-
ical dimension length×time. This means that the only straight line passing
through G which solves this problem is the line parallel to the instantaneous
screw axis. The accelerations of the points on this line are a = λ0 ˙ω × ω .
Problem (b): Collinearity means that a has the form a = λω2ϱ where λ is
an indeterminate dimensionless scalar. With this expression (9.88) takes the
form
[ ˙ω × I + ω ω −ω2(1 + λ) I ] · ϱ = 0 .
(9.90)
The vectors in this equation are decomposed in the reference frame with
origin G and with axes parallel to the canonical reference frame, so that ω
and ˙ω have the coordinates given in (9.85). This results in the coordinate
equation

(9.91)
This represents an eigenvalue problem with eigenvalues λi (i = 1, 2, 3) and
with associated eigenvectors ϱi . The characteristic equation is
λ3 + 2λ2 + (1 + μ2)λ + μ2 sin2 α = 0
(9.92)
or
λ(λ + 1)2 + μ2(λ + sin2 α) = 0 . Real eigenvalues are in the interval
−sin2 α < λ < 0 . From this and from the equation
a = λω2ϱ it fol-
lows that the collinear vectors a and ϱ have opposite signs. This means
that the accelerations of all points located on the straight lines determined
by the eigenvectors are directed toward the center of acceleration G . The
discriminant of the equation is (see Bronstein/Semendjajew/Musiol/M¨uhlig
[3]):
D = μ2
27

μ4 + 1
4μ2(27 cos4 α −18 cos2 α −1) + cos2 α

(9.93)
The equation D = 0 is a quadratic equation for μ2 as function of cos α
and also a quadratic equation for cos2 α as function of μ . The equation
has the double root μ2 = 1/3 if cos α = 1/3 . Real solutions exist only
for
0 < μ2 ≤1/3
and for
0 < | cos α| ≤1/3 . In a diagram with axes
cos α and μ the curve D = 0 separates the domain D < 0 with three
real eigenvectors from the domain D > 0 with a single real eigenvector.
At the point μ2 = 1/3 ,
cos α = 1/3 the curve has a cusp. With these
parameter values the characteristic Eq.(9.92) has the form (λ + 2/3)3 = 0 .

In Fig. 9.9 the curve D = 0 is shown not in the cos α, μ-diagram, but in
a diagram with axes μ sin α and μ cos α . According to (9.85) these are the
coordinates of the vector ˙ω/ω2 in the plane of ω and ˙ω . The unit vector
ω/|ω| is directed along the μ cos α-axis (see (9.85)). Three real eigenvectors
exist if the vector ˙ω/ω2 terminates in the shaded domain D < 0 .
Three real eigenvectors are not mutually orthogonal. Let βi be the angle
between the eigenvector ϱi and ω . With the coordinates ϱi1 , ϱi2 , ϱi3 of ϱi
cos2 βi =

(because of (9.92)). Consequently,
λi = −sin2 βi . The sum of the three
eigenvalues equals −2 (factor 2 of λ2 in (9.92)). Hence

cos2 βi = 1 .
(9.97)
This result is due to Bottema [1]. From λ > −sin2 α it follows that sin2 βi <
sin2 α (i = 1, 2, 3) .

( β1 = 60◦, β2 = 36◦, β3 = 72◦). End of example.
A line not passing through the center of acceleration is speciﬁed by the
equation ϱ(λ) = ϱ0 + λn with the dimensionless unit vector n along the
line and the perpendicular ϱ0 ̸= 0 from the center of acceleration onto the
line (hence ϱ0 · n = 0 ). The point ϱ(λ) has the acceleration
a(λ) = ˙ω × ϱ0 + ω × (ω × ϱ0) + λ[ ˙ω × n + ω × (ω × n)] .
(9.98)
On every line not parallel to the ISA exactly one point has an acceleration
perpendicular to the line. The pertinent value of λ is determined from the
condition a(λ) · n = 0 . This is the equation
˙ω × ϱ0 · n + (ω · ϱ0)(ω · n) −λ(ω × n)2 = 0 .
(9.99)
Next, lines and points on these lines are determined which have an accel-
eration along the line. The condition is
a(λ) = νn
with an arbitrary
scalar ν of dimension acceleration. Suppose that n is given. Then the equa-
tion is a linear equation for λ and for two coordinates of ϱ0 in the plane
perpendicular to n . The solutions are proportional to ν , i.e., of the form
λ = (ν/ν∗)λ∗, ϱ0 = (ν/ν∗)ϱ∗
0
where λ∗and ϱ∗
0 are the solutions for
an arbitrary reference value ν∗. They determine uniquely a straight line
(ν/ν∗)(ϱ∗
0 + λ∗n) through the center of acceleration. All points of this line,
and these points only, have accelerations in the direction of n . It remains to
be shown that the coeﬃcient matrix of λ and ϱ0 is nonsingular. Decompo-
sition in a system in which n and ϱ0 have the coordinate matrices [ 1 0 0 ]T
and [ 0 y z ]T , respectively, results in the equation

It is straight-forward to show that the determinant of the coeﬃcient matrix
is −( ˙ω × ω)2 ̸= 0 .
Next, (9.88) is used for determining the surface deﬁned by all body-ﬁxed
points ϱ which have an acceleration of prescribed absolute value |a| (arbi-
trary). The vectors are again decomposed in the reference frame with origin
G . With the coordinates of ϱ , ω and ˙ω given in (9.85) the acceleration has
the coordinates

This matrix has real eigenvalues λ1 , λ2 , λ3 and mutually perpendicular
eigenvectors. In terms of the eigenvalues and in the x, y, z-system of prin-
cipal axes deﬁned by the eigenvectors the equation is
λ1x2 + λ2y2 + λ3z2 = a2

(9.104)
Both the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are independent of a . The eigen-
values are the roots of the characteristic equation det (A −λI) = 0 :
λ3 −2λ2(1 + μ2) + λ(1 + μ2)2 −μ4 sin4 α = 0 .
(9.105)
They are positive. This is seen by writing the equation in the form λ[λ −
(1 + μ2)]2 = μ4 sin4 α . Hence the surface is an ellipsoid. Vieta’s theorem
establishes for the eigenvalues the equations λ1 + λ2 + λ3 = 2(1 + μ2) and
λ1λ2 + λ2λ3 + λ3λ1 = (1 + μ2)2 , whence it follows that

Given a body-ﬁxed plane E by its Eq.(2.1) , m · ϱ = −1 , determine all
points ϱ of E the accelerations of which are (a) in-plane or (b) perpendicular
to the plane. The same problems with velocity instead of acceleration were
solved by Eqs.(9.26) – (9.28) and (9.38) for planes given in the x, y, z-system
underlying these equations. In the present case, the plane is given in the
reference system with origin G and with the coordinates (9.85).
Problem (a): Vectors ϱ satisfy the equations m·ϱ = −1 and m·a/ω2 = 0 .
With the coordinates (9.101) of a the ﬁrst equation and the sum of both
equations are written as linear equations for x and y in terms of z :

xμ(my cos α −mz sin α) −yμmx cos α = −[1 + z(μmx sin α + mz)] .
 
(9.109)
The solution x(z) , y(z) determines a straight line in E . No such line exists
in planes with normal vectors m satisfying the condition that the coeﬃcient
determinant is zero. This condition is (m2
x + m2
y) cos α −mymz sin α = 0 or
(see (9.28) and (9.85)) [m×(ω×m)]· ˙ω = 0 or (m×ω)·(m× ˙ω) = 0 . This
shows that m = c ω and m = c ˙ω with c = const (arbitrary) are special
solutions. The general solution is obtained by writing the scalar equation
in the form
m2
x + (my −1
2mz tan α)2 = ( 1
2mz tan α)2 . This is, with the
free parameter mz , the equation of a cone. The cone intersects the plane
mz = const in a circle. Every vector m along a generator of the cone is a
solution. The special solutions m = c ω and m = c ˙ω are vectors along the
two generators in the plane mx = 0 .
Problem (b): Vectors ϱ satisfy the equations m · ϱ = −1 and λm = a/ω2
with an indeterminate scalar λ . Decomposition of all vectors results in four
linear equations for x , y , z and λ :

are parallel to the plane spanned by ω and ˙ω .

9.9 Angular Acceleration of a Body in Terms of
Positions, Velocities and Accelerations of Three
Points
Problem statement: In some reference basis the instantaneous position vectors
r1 , r2 , r3 of three noncollinear points P1 , P2 , P3 of a rigid body as well as
the instantaneous velocities v1 , v2 , v3 and the instantaneous accelerations
a1 , a2 , a3 of these points are given. In Sect. 9.4 the instantaneous angular
velocity ω of the body was expressed in terms of r1 , r2 , r3 and v1 , v2 ,
v3 (see (9.46), (9.47) and (9.52)). In the present section a cyclicly symmetric
expression is developed for the angular acceleration
˙ω of the body. The
method of solution is similar to the one used for determining ω . Let A
be an arbitrary body-ﬁxed point and let ϱi be the vector pointing from
A to Pi . Then ω × ϱi = vi −vA . With this expression Eq.(9.81) for the
acceleration ai takes the form ai = aA + ˙ω ×ϱi +ω ×(vi −vA) (i = 1, 2, 3).
The diﬀerence of two of these equations reads
ai −aj −ω × (vi −vj) = ˙ω × (ri −rj)
(i, j = 1, 2, 3) .
(9.111)
This equation serves as starting point just as (9.41) was the starting point
for formulating ω . The equivalent to (9.42) is the equation
[a1 −a3 −ω × (v1 −v3)] × [a2 −a3 −ω × (v2 −v3)]
= −˙ω (r1 −r3) · [a2 −a3 −ω × (v2 −v3)] .(9.112)
If the scalar product on the right-hand side is nonzero,
˙ω = [a1 −a3 −ω × (v1 −v3)] × [a2 −a3 −ω × (v2 −v3)]
(r3 −r1) · [a2 −a3 −ω × (v2 −v3)]
.
(9.113)
The numerator (abbreviated N) is multiplied out:
N = (a1 −a3) × (a2 −a3) + [ω × (v1 −v3)] × [ω × (v2 −v3)]
+[ω × (v2 −v3)] × (a1 −a3) −[ω × (v1 −v3)] × (a2 −a3) .
(9.114)
Multiplying out further and rearranging terms results in the cyclicly sym-
metric expression
N =


i=1
ai ×[aj −ω ×(vj −vk)]+ωω ·(v1 ×v2 +v2 ×v3 +v3 ×v1) (9.115)
(i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 cyclic) . Next, the denominator in (9.113) (abbreviated D) is
given a symmetric form. The equation (r3 −r1)·(r2 −r3) = const expressing
the rigid-body property is diﬀerentiated twice with respect to time. This

yields
(r3 −r1) · (a2 −a3) = −(a3 −a1) · (r2 −r3) −2(v3 −v1) · (v2 −v3) . (9.116)
If to both sides of this equation the expression (r3 −r1) · [a2 −a3 −2ω ×
(v2 −v3)] is added, the left-hand side turns out to be 2D . Therefore,
D = 1


−(v3 −v1) · (v2 −v3) −(r3 −r1) · ω × (v2 −v3) .
(9.117)
The last two terms cancel each other (interchange the multiplication symbols
and note that (r3 −r1) × ω = −(v3 −v1)) . The remaining terms have the
desired symmetry property. Multiplying out yields the ﬁnal result
˙ω = 2

(i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 cyclic) .
(9.118)
The angular velocity ω is given either by (9.46) or by (9.52).
If in (9.112) the scalar product on the right-hand side is zero, also the left-
hand side is zero. Because of (9.111) this means that the vectors ˙ω×(r1−r3)
and ˙ω ×(r2 −r3) are collinear. From this it follows that ˙ω is in the plane of
the points P1 , P2 , P3. Consequently, there exist coeﬃcients λ and μ such
that
˙ω = λ(r1 −r2) + μ(r2 −r3) .
(9.119)
This ansatz yields
a3 −a2 −ω × (v3 −v2) = ˙ω × (r3 −r2) = λn ,
a1 −a2 −ω × (v1 −v2) = ˙ω × (r1 −r2) = μn ,
 
(9.120)
where n is the vector
n = (r1 −r2) × (r3 −r2) = −(r1 × r2 + r2 × r3 + r3 × r1) .

9.10 Strapdown Inertial Navigation
The body shown in Fig. 9.10 stands for an aircraft. In an inertial reference
basis e1 the body-ﬁxed point A has the position vector r(t) . The points
Pi (i = 1, . . . , 6) are six body-ﬁxed points with position vectors ϱi = −−→
APi .
Let ai be the acceleration of Pi relative to e1 . An accelerometer positioned
at Pi measures as function of time the component αi(t) of this acceleration
ai in a body-ﬁxed direction speciﬁed by the unit vector ni : αi(t) =
ai ·ni (i = 1, . . . , 6). To be determined are, as functions of time, the position
r(t) and the direction cosine matrix A12(t) relating e1 to a body-ﬁxed basis
e2 . The characterization strapdown points to the fact that the accelerometers
are ﬁxed in e2 rather than in an inertial platform the orientation of which
relative to the reference basis e1 is held constant by means of gyroscopic
instruments.

From the numerical solution for q0(t) , q1(t) , q2(t) , q3(t) the direction cosine
matrix A12(t) is calculated from (1.79).
In the last step, the acceleration ¨r is calculated from the ﬁrst three Eqs.
(9.126). Also these equations are decomposed in the body-ﬁxed basis e2 . For
all vectors except ¨r the coordinates are known by now. This yields for the
coordinate matrix ¨r2 in e2 an equation of the form N ¨r2 = F(t) with a
constant matrix N . By deﬁnition, N −1 exists. The coordinates ¨r1 of ¨r in
e1 are
¨r1 = A12(t)N −1F(t) .
(9.133)
Numerical integration of this equation yields r1(t) . This concludes the solu-
tion of the problem.
The equations are particularly simple if the vectors ϱi and ni (i =

9.11 Motion on a Curved Surface
Let Σ be a continuously curved surface and let, furthermore, p and q be
suitably chosen curvilinear coordinates such that every point of Σ is inter-
section point of two lines p = const and q = const. The point is denoted
P(p, q) . Its position vector measured from some reference point is denoted
r(p, q) . The partial derivatives ∂r/∂p and ∂r/∂q are vectors tangent to the
line p = const and to the line q = const, respectively, at P(p, q) . The unit
vector n normal to Σ at P(p, q) is
n(p, q) =

Example: The surface Σ is the ellipsoid x2/a2+y2/b2+z2/c2 = 1 . Suitable
curvilinear coordinates p and q are angles which represent geographical
longitude and geographical latitude when the ellipsoid is a sphere. In the
x, y, z-system the position vector r measured from the center, its partial
derivatives and the unit normal vector n have the coordinates

Let P be a point moving on Σ . Prescribed functions p(t) , q(t) of time
t determine the trajectory r(t) = r( p(t) , q(t) ) , the velocity ˙r(t) and the

9 Angular Velocity. Angular Acceleration
Next, the case is considered that a plane Σ′ is moving on a curved sur-
face Σ . Let 0 be a point ﬁxed in Σ′ . The position vector of 0 is denoted
r0 . Furthermore, let n′ and ω be the unit normal vector and the angular
velocity, respectively, of Σ′ . The motion of Σ′ on a curved surface Σ with
coordinates p , q is called Levi-Civita motion (Pﬁster [9]) if at all times t the
following constraints exist:
- Σ′ is tangent to Σ
- the point of contact is 0
- the angular velocity of Σ′ lies in Σ′ .
These constraints are expressed through the equations
n′ ≡n(p, q) ,
(9.144)
r0 ≡r(p, q) ,
(9.145)
ω = n ×
∂n
∂p ˙p + ∂n
∂q ˙q

.
(9.146)
Proof of (9.146): The vector n′ ﬁxed in Σ′ has the time derivative ˙n′ = ω×
n′ . Because of (9.144) this is the equation ˙n = ω × n . Cross-multiplication
from the left with n produces, because of the orthogonality of n and ω ,
the equation n × ˙n = ω . This together with (9.143) yields (9.146). End of
proof. The angular acceleration is ˙ω = n × ¨n .
Without the constraint (9.146) the system is holonomic with degree of
freedom three. Suitable coordinates are the coordinates p , q of 0 on Σ and
the angle between an arbitrary straight line ﬁxed in Σ′ and the tangent to
the line p = const at 0 . Equation (9.146) is integrable in analytical form
if and only if Σ is a surface with zero Gaussian curvature (for example
a general cylinder). In this case, not only the position of 0 , but also the
angular orientation of Σ′ is uniquely determined as function of p and q . If
Σ is not of this special form, (9.146) is a nonholonomic constraint equation.
In this case, kinematic diﬀerential equations must be formulated relating
time derivatives of coordinates of the angular orientation of Σ′ to ω . As
coordinates Euler angles are chosen with the surface normal n as axis of
rotation of the third angle φ . The constraint equation requires ω3 ≡0 .
Therefore, the kinematic diﬀerential Eqs.(10.24) have the form
⎡
⎣
˙ψ
˙θ
˙φ
⎤
⎦=
⎡

(9.147)
If the motion of 0 on Σ is prescribed by functions of time p(t) and q(t) ,
r0(t) and ω(t) are known as functions of time. Starting from initial condi-
tions satisfying (9.144) integration of (9.147) yields the angular orientation
of Σ′ as function of time.

9.11 Motion on a Curved Surface
323
Motion of a Curved Surface on Another Curved Surface
In Fig. 9.11a Σ1 and Σ2 are curved surfaces. Let pi , qi be the curvilinear
coordinates of Σi (i = 1, 2) . Surface Σ2 is moving relative to Σ1 in such
a way that both surfaces have, at all times t , a single (moving) point of
tangential contact. Examples are the motion of a ﬁnger of a robot hand on a
curved object and the single-point contact of tooth ﬂanks in a gear train. Such
motions may be holonomic or nonholonomic. In the case of pure rolling they
are nonholonomic. At the instantaneous contact point P a point P1(p1, q1)
of Σ1 coincides with a point P2(p2, q2) of Σ2 . At P Σ1 and Σ2 have the
same normal: n1 ≡n2 . The trajectories of P1 on Σ1 and of P2 on Σ2 are,
in general, not cotangent. In the course of a sliding motion, for example, one
trajectory may degenerate to a point while the other is a continuous curve.
The single-point contact represents a 5-d.o.f. joint. It seems natural to
choose as coordinates describing the position of Σ2 the coordinates (p1, q1)
of P1 , the coordinates (p2, q2) of P2 and, in addition, the angle between the
tangents at P to the lines p1 = const and p2 = const. These coordinates,
originally introduced by Darboux [5], are still used in the literature. They
have the disadvantage of leading to complicated expressions for the angular
velocity and the angular acceleration of Σ2 .
A diﬀerent set of coordinates free of this disadvantage was proposed by
Neumann [8] and Richter [10] (see Pﬁster [9]). Following their ideas the two-
body system Σ1–Σ2 with a 5-d.o.f.-joint is interpreted as four-body system
Σ1–Σ′
1–Σ′
2–Σ2 with three joints (see Fig. 9.11b). Bodies Σ′
1 and Σ′
2 are
coalescent planes which rotate relative to each other about a point 0 ﬁxed in
both planes. The angle of rotation of Σ′
2 relative to Σ′
1 is denoted χ . Plane
Σ′
1 is executing a Levi-Civita motion relative to Σ1 , and plane Σ′
2 is execut-
ing another Levi-Civita motion relative to Σ2 . Point 0 is the common point
of contact of the four bodies. It coincides with the moving points P1(p1, q1)
and P2(p2, q2) . The angular velocity of Σ2 relative to Σ1 is written in the

where ω1 and ω2 are the angular velocities of Σ′

Civita motions read

9.12 Mecanum Wheel
A Swedish invention referred to as Mecanum wheel consists of a rigid wheel
hub and of rigid rollers mounted on the periphery of the hub according to
Fig. 9.12 . Each roller can freely rotate about an axis which in radial projec-
tion makes an angle α with the axis of the wheel hub. The generating line
of the rollers is formed so as to keep the hub axis at a constant distance R
above ground. This distance is the outer wheel radius. When the wheel hub
is rotating, the contact point on the roller moves from one end of the roller
to the other, i.e., from one side of the wheel to the other. This lateral motion
has interesting kinematical and dynamical eﬀects. In a vehicle equipped with
mecanum wheels the axes of the hubs are ﬁxed on the vehicle body. Such a
vehicle can rotate on the spot and translate in any direction without slipping
on the ground provided a single roller per wheel has ground contact. Vehicle
motion is controlled by controlling the angular velocities of wheel hubs rela-
tive to the vehicle body. Because of their maneuverability such vehicles ﬁnd
applications as store trolleys, assembly platforms in factories, platforms for
mobile robots etc. The following kinematics analysis was published in [13].
In Fig. 9.13 the axis of the wheel hub and a single roller contacting ground
are shown. The reference basis with unit basis vectors ex , ey , ez is ﬁxed on
the vehicle. Its origin S is the center of the hub, ey is directed along the
hub axis, and ez is normal to the plane on which the roller is rolling. The
basis with unit basis vectors e1 , e2 , e3 is ﬁxed on the hub. Its origin is the
center S∗of the roller, e2 is directed along the roller axis, and e3 is pointing
towards S . Let ϕ be the rotation angle of the hub relative to the vehicle
about ey with ϕ = 0 in the position e3 = ez . The angular orientation
of basis e1,2,3 with respect to basis ex,y,z is the result of this rotation ϕ
followed by a rotation about e3 through the roller inclination angle α . Hence

The point P of contact between roller and ground has in basis ex,y,z coor-
dinates [ 0 , y , −R] with a variable y(ϕ) . The vertical through P intersects
the roller axis. Therefore, ϱSP can also be represented in the form
ϱSP = −re3 + ue2 −wez
(9.153)
with r being the constant distance between S and S∗and with variables
u(ϕ) and w(ϕ) . Decomposition of this expression in ex,y,z with the help of
(9.152) yields
⎡

The velocity state of the vehicle is described by its angular velocity ˙θez and
by the velocity vS = vxex+vyey of S . Let, furthermore, ˙ψe2 be the angular
velocity of the roller relative to the hub. In these terms, the contact point P
of the roller has the velocity

vP = vS + ˙θez × ϱSP + ˙ϕey × ϱSP + ˙ψe2 × ϱS∗P

= vxex + vyey −( ˙θy + ˙ϕR)ex −˙ψz(ey sin α cos ϕ + ex cos α) .
(9.156)
The rolling condition vP = 0 yields the equations
vx −˙θy −˙ϕR −˙ψw cos α = 0 ,
vy −˙ψw sin α cos ϕ = 0 .
(9.157)
For y and w the expressions (9.155) are substituted. The resulting equations
are resolved for ˙ϕR and
˙ψ :
˙ϕR = vx −
 vy
cos ϕ −˙θr tan ϕ

cot α ,
˙ψ =
vy
(R cos ϕ −r) sin α . (9.158)
The formula for ˙ψ shows that the contacting roller does not rotate relative to
the hub if vy = 0 . In this case, the entire wheel consisting of hub and rollers
forms a single rigid body. In the position ϕ = 0 (contact point P vertically
below S ; roller axis horizontal) the ﬁrst Eq.(9.158) reduces to
˙ϕR = vx −
vy cot α . From this it follows that ˙ϕ = 0 if the velocity vS is directed normal
to the roller axis. Only the rollers are rotating. This can also be predicted
from Fig. 9.12 .
Equations (9.158) are valid as long as ϕ is in a narrow range −ϕmax ≤
ϕ ≤ϕmax assuring contact between roller and ground. When the angle ϕ
of a roller is close to ϕmax , the next roller contacts ground and its angle is
close to −ϕmax . In the case
˙θ ̸= 0 , the two rollers require diﬀerent angular
velocities ˙ϕ(ϕmax) and ˙ϕ(−ϕmax) . The diﬀerence is ˙ϕ(−ϕmax)−˙ϕ(ϕmax) =
−2(r/R) ˙θ cot α tan ϕmax or, in view of (9.155),
2ymax ˙θ/R . The quantity
2ymax is the active width of the wheel. These results show that in phases
of motion with two rollers contacting ground pure rolling is impossible if
the vehicle is rotating ( ˙θ ̸= 0 ). The periodical change between slipping and
rolling causes vibrations of systems mounted on the vehicle. Such vibrations
have been observed.
In (9.158) the angle ϕ is small. Assuming that also ˙θ is small the equations
can be approximated as follows:
˙ϕR = vx −vy cot α ,
˙ψ(R −r) =
vy
sin α .
(9.159)
Next, motions of a vehicle equipped with mecanum wheels are considered. For
this purpose two new reference systems are deﬁned in the plane of motion.
One with axes X , Y is ﬁxed on the ground. The other with basis vectors
eξ , eη and origin A (arbitrary) is ﬁxed on the vehicle. In this vehicle-ﬁxed
system a mecanum wheel is located by the vector rS = aeξ +beη of its center
S and by the constant angle β between the axes eξ and ex . The velocity
of S relative to ground is vS = vA + ˙θez × rS . For formulating (9.159) the

Kinematic Diﬀerential Equations
The angular velocity ω of a body-ﬁxed basis e2 relative to a reference basis
e1 cannot, in general, be expressed as time derivative of some other vec-
tor. This is possible only in the special case when the direction of ω
is
constant in e2 and, thereby, also in e1 . In all other cases the relationship
between variables describing the angular position of the body on the one
hand and the angular velocity on the other is expressed through kinematic
diﬀerential equations in which the coordinates of ω appear as time-varying
coeﬃcients. In kinematics as well as in dynamics the relevant coordinates
of ω are those in the body-ﬁxed basis e2 . In what follows, ω1 , ω2 , ω3 are
these coordinates, and the column matrix of these coordinates is denoted ω .
In the sections to come kinematic diﬀerential equations are formulated for
direction cosines, Euler angles, Bryan angles, Euler-Rodrigues parameters,
Cayley-Klein parameters, Rodrigues parameters, Wiener parameters and for
the Euler vector.
10.1 Direction Cosines
Let r be the position vector of an arbitrary body-ﬁxed point. Its constant
coordinate matrix r2 in e2 and its time-varying coordinate matrix r1(t) in
e1 are related through the equation r1(t) = A12(t) r2 . Diﬀerentiation yields
the velocity coordinates relative to e1 and decomposed in e1 :
˙r1 = ˙A
12r2 .
(10.1)
In terms of ω the velocity is ˙r = ω ×r . Its coordinate matrix in e2 is ˜ω r2
and in e1 it is A12˜ω r2 . Comparison with (10.1) yields the equation
˙A
12r2 =
A12˜ω r2 . Since this equation is valid independent of r2 , the preceding factors
on both sides are equal:

10 Kinematic Diﬀerential Equations

(10.2)
These are, in matrix form, the desired diﬀerential equations for direction
cosines. They are called Poisson’s equations. They are linear equations with
time-varying coeﬃcients. Equations for individual direction cosines are ob-
tained by multiplying out:
˙a12
11 = ω3a12
12 −ω2a12
13
etc.
(10.3)
Equation (10.2) yields for the trace of
˙A

Its time derivative is calculated from six Eqs.(10.3):

ω .
(10.6)
The kinematic diﬀerential equations determine the direction cosines when
ω1(t) , ω2(t) , ω3(t) are known from an analytical or numerical integration
of dynamics equations of motion. Frequently, dynamics equations of motion
contain as unknowns not only ω1 , ω2 , ω3 and
˙ω1 , ˙ω2 , ˙ω3 , but also the
direction cosines themselves. In such cases the dynamics equations of motion
and the kinematic diﬀerential equations must be integrated simultaneously.
If the direction cosine matrix is prescribed as function of time, the coor-
dinates of ω are calculated from the equation
˜ω = A12T ˙A
12 .
(10.7)
The coordinates of ω in basis e1 deﬁne the coordinate matrix ω1 and
the skewsymmetric matrix ˜ω1 . They are related to ω and ˜ω by the trans-
formations ω1 = A12ω and ˜ω1 = A12˜ωA12T
(see (1.25)). With (10.7) the
latter equation is ˜ω1 = ˙A
12A12T .
Example: Two points P1 and P2 of a body with a ﬁxed point 0 are
constrained to mutually perpendicular ﬁxed planes E1 and E2 , respectively.
Plane E1 is the e1
1, e1
2-plane of a ﬁxed reference basis e1 having 0 as origin,
and E2 is the e1
1, e1
3-plane of the same basis. The coordinate matrices of P1
and P2 in the body-ﬁxed basis e2 with origin 0 are given as r2
1 = [ 1 0 0 ]T
and
r2
2 = [ cos α
0
sin α ]T , respectively
(0 < α ≤π/2 ). The angle
α
is the apex angle in the isosceles triangle (P1,0,P2). Together with P1
and P2 the body-ﬁxed lines 0P1 and 0P2 are constrained to E1 and E2 ,

respectively. The body has the degree of freedom F = 1 . It is free to rotate
such that in projection along e1
1 the base P1P2 of the triangle is moving
through all four quadrants of the e1
2, e1
3-plane. The kinematics is most easily
described in terms of Euler angles. From (1.28) the direction cosine matrix
is copied:

In e1
P1 and P2 have the coordinate matrices

and
r1

1 and the second coordinate

The coordinates ω1 , ω2 , ω3 are parameter equations of the moving polhode

These curves are discussed in Sect. 13.1.1 where they are met again. There,
it is shown that the motion of the central cross in a Hooke’s joint is the

The smaller circle is rolling inside the ﬁxed circle which is twice as big. These

In Sect. 1.4 it was shown that in the case of small angles φ1 , φ2 , φ3 lin-
earization of the direction cosine matrix is possible (see (1.33)). Linearization
of (10.26) yields ωi ≈˙φi (i = 1, 2, 3). Hence the angular orientation of the
body is the result of simple integration:

10.4 Euler-Rodrigues Parameters
Introductory remarks: The vector q = n sin ϕ/2 is one out of ﬁve vectors of
the general form z = nf(ϕ) . The other four vectors are n itself, the Ro-
drigues vector n tan ϕ/2 , the Wiener vector n tan ϕ/4 and the Euler vector
nϕ . The vector z has identical coordinates in e1 and in e2 . But its time
derivatives in the two bases are diﬀerent. The relationship is

(10.29)
End of the introductory remarks.
Kinematic diﬀerential equations for Euler-Rodrigues parameters are es-
tablished by three diﬀerent methods. The ﬁrst method starts out from
Eqs.(1.117) for the Euler-Rodrigues parameters of the resultant of two con-
secutive rotations:
q0res = q02q01 −q2 · q1 ,
qres = q02q1 + q01q2 + q2 × q1 .
(10.30)
The parameters (q01, q1) are attributed to time t during a continuous mo-
tion, and the parameters (q0res, qres) are attributed to time
t + dt . The
quantities (q02, q2) represent the Euler-Rodrigues parameters of the diﬀer-
ential rotation ω dt = eωω dt during the time interval dt (unit vector eω ).
These parameters are
q02 = cos

With these expressions Eqs.(10.30) take the forms
q0(t + dt) = q0(t) −1
2 ω · q(t) dt ,
q(t + dt) = q(t) + 1
2 [q0(t)ω + ω × q(t)] dt .

Division by dt yields for ˙q0 and for the derivative of q in e1 the diﬀerential
equations
˙q0 = −1
2ω · q ,
(1) dq
dt
= 1
2(q0ω + ω × q) .
(10.33)
Because of (10.29) the derivative in e2 is
(2) dq

= 1
2(q0ω −ω × q) .
(10.34)
Decomposition of these equations in e2 yields the desired kinematic diﬀer-

(10.35)
The equations are linear with a time-varying skew-symmetric coeﬃcient ma-
trix.
The second method for generating these equations uses Eqs.(1.81), (1.82),
(1.78) and (10.4) – (10.6) relating Euler-Rodrigues parameters to direction
cosines. From (1.81), (1.82) and (10.5)
4q2
0 = tr A12 + 1 ,
4q0q = p .
(10.36)
Both equations are diﬀerentiated:
8q0 ˙q0 = tr ˙A
12 ,
4q0 ˙q = ˙p −4 ˙q0q .
(10.37)
The ﬁrst equation in combination with (10.4) yields
8q0 ˙q0 = −ωT p
and
with the second Eq.(10.36)
˙q0 = −1
2 ωT q .
(10.38)
This is the ﬁrst Eq.(10.35). With this expression for ˙q0 and with (10.6) for
˙p the second Eq.(10.37) becomes
4q0 ˙q =

tr A12
I −A12T + 2q qT 
ω
(10.39)
and with (10.36) for tr A12 and (1.78) for A12 4q0 ˙q = 2(q2

˙q = 1

(10.40)
This is the second Eq.(10.35).

These expressions and the expression for cos θ are substituted into the third
diﬀerential Eq.(10.23) for Euler angles: ω3 = ˙ψ cos θ + ˙φ . This results in the

Simple reordering results in (10.35).

tities must not be used for calculating from (1.79) a direction cosine matrix
for the transformation of vector coordinates. Before doing so the quantities
must be replaced by corrected quantities satisfying the constraint equation.
Correction formulas are developed in Sect. 10.9 .

are again expressed in terms of α and β by substituting the expressions in

The kinematic diﬀerential equation for the Euler vector and the formula
for ω were established by other methods and with diﬀerent notations by
Stuelpnagel [5], Peres [2], Nazaroﬀ[1], Shuster [4] and Pﬁster [3].
Example 1 : The solutions of the various kinematic diﬀerential equations
are a-priorily known if the direction cosine matrix A12(t) is prescribed as
function of time. As illustrative example the matrix is prescribed as follows:
A12(t) =

basis e2 about the axis e1

motion is a permanent rotation about the axis e1

the constant coordinate matrix ω = [0 0 ω] . The same coordinate matrix
is obtained from (10.7):
˜ω = A12T ˙A
12 . The matrix A12(t) determines as
functions of time the corresponding Euler angles, Bryan angles and Euler-
Rodrigues parameters. Equations (1.29), (1.35), (1.81) and (1.82) yield
Euler angles:
ψ ≡0 ,
θ ≡π/2 ,
φ = ωt ,

2 , the Wiener vector σ(t) = e2
3 tan ωt

and the Euler
vector φ = e2

As illustrative examples the diﬀerential equations for Euler angles and for
Euler-Rodrigues parameters are formulated. With the given angular velocity
coordinates [0

ω] Eqs.(10.24) for Euler angles read:
˙ψ = 0 ,
˙θ = 0 ,
˙φ = ω . Together with the prescribed initial values this yields the solutions
(10.78).

2 q3 ,
˙q1 = ω
2 q2 ,
˙q2 = −ω

˙q3 = ω

(10.79)
Combining the ﬁrst equation with the fourth and the second with the third
results in the equations ¨q0 = −(ω/2)2q0 and ¨q1 = −(ω/2)2q1 . They have
the general solutions
q0(t) = A0 cos ωt
2 + B0 sin ωt
2 ,
q1(t) = A1 cos ωt
2 + B1 sin ωt

With these solutions the solutions for q2(t) and q3(t) are obtained from
(10.79). The constants of integration A0 , B0 , A1 , B1 are determined by
the prescribed initial conditions q0(0) = q1(0) =
√
2/2 , q2(0) = q3(0) = 0 .
The ﬁnal results are those given in (10.78). End of example.
Example 2 : The coordinates of the angular velocity ω of a body in the
body-ﬁxed basis e2 are given as functions of time in the form
ω1(t) = −Ω sin ω0t ,
ω2(t) = Ω cos ω0t ,
ω3(t) ≡μΩ
(10.81)

referred to in Theorem 9.7 is a circular cone with the axis e2

has constant magnitude Ω

1 + μ2 . It is rotating with the angular velocity
ω0 about the cone axis. To be determined are the herpolhode cone and the
angular position of the body as functions of time.
Solution: The diﬀerential Eqs.(10.24) for Euler angles are

Equations (10.81) are the solutions of Euler’s dynamics equations of motion
for a classical problem of rigid body dynamics, namely, the motion of an
inertia-symmetric body about its center of mass in the absence of external
torques (Wittenburg [6, 8]). The angular momentum vector of the body has
constant magnitude and direction in an inertial reference basis e1 . This
additional condition requires the Euler angles to be the special solutions

cot θ ≡μ + ω0
Ω = const ,
˙ψ ≡

(10.83)
These results are interpreted as follows (see Fig. 1.1). The motion of basis
e2 is the superposition of two rotational motions. One is rotation with
˙ψ =
const about e1
3 in the position θ = const., and the other is rotation with ˙φ =
const about e2
3 . This means that the body-ﬁxed axis e2
3 is moving on the
cone with axis e1
3 and with semi apex angle θ . The ﬁxed herpolhode cone
generated by ω is another circular cone also with the axis e1
3 . The vector
ω along the line of contact of polhode and herpolhode cone is permanently
in the plane spanned by e2
3 and e1
3 .
The general solution ψ(t) , θ(t) , φ(t) is obtained not from (10.82), but
via Euler-Rodrigues parameters. The diﬀerential Eqs.(10.35) for these pa-
rameters are
2 ˙q0 = −Ω(−q1 sin ω0t + q2 cos ω0t + μq3) ,
2 ˙q1 =
Ω(−q0 sin ω0t −q3 cos ω0t + μq2) ,

Solving these equations is diﬃcult. Solving the diﬀerential Eqs.(10.49) for the

10 Kinematic Diﬀerential Equations
The ﬁrst equation is diﬀerentiated:
α′′ = i μα′ + e−2i Dτ(−2i Dβ + β′) .
(10.87)
By means of (10.86) the term
e−2i Dτ(−2i Dβ + β′)
is expressed as lin-
ear combination of α′ and α . This procedure results in the second-order
equation
α′′ + 2i Dα′ + (1 + μ2 + 2Dμ)α = 0 .
(10.88)
The ansatz α = A eλτ leads to the equation λ2 +2i Dλ+1+μ2 +2Dμ = 0 .
It has two purely imaginary solutions

(10.89)
Hence α(τ) is a linear combination of two harmonic oscillations:
α(τ) = A ei ν1τ + B ei ν2τ .

The ﬁrst Eq.(10.86) yields
β(τ) = e2i Dτ(α′ −i μα)

i (ν1 −μ)A ei ν1τ + i (ν2 −μ)B ei ν2τ1
= i (ν1 −μ)A e−i ν2τ + i (ν2 −μ)B e−i ν1τ .
(10.91)
At this point the return from the complex Cayley-Klein parameters to the
real Euler-Rodrigues parameters is made. Writing the complex constants of
integration in the forms A = A1 + i A2 , B = B1 + i B2 and expressing the
exponential functions through circular functions the equations α = q0 +i q3 ,
β = −q2 + i q1 yield the explicit solutions
q0 = A1 cos ν1τ −A2 sin ν1τ + B1 cos ν2τ −B2 sin ν2τ ,
q3 = A2 cos ν1τ + A1 sin ν1τ + B2 cos ν2τ + B1 sin ν2τ ,
q2 = (ν1 −μ)(A2 cos ν2τ −A1 sin ν2τ) + (ν2 −μ)(B2 cos ν1τ −B1 sin ν1τ) ,

Direct Kinematics of Tree-Structured
Systems
In Fig. 11.1 a general spatial tree-structured system is shown. Its bodies
i = 0, . . . , n and its joints i = 1, . . . , n are regularly labeled. By this is
meant that joint i (i = 1, . . . , n) connects body i to a body
b(i) < i .
Example: In Fig. 11.1 b(5) = 3 and b(1) = 0 . Regular labeling is always
possible and, in general, in more than one way. The simplest tree-structure
is a serial chain (a system without side branches). In a serial chain joint i
(i = 1, . . . , n) connects body i to body b(i) = i −1 .
Body 0 is moving relative to a common reference basis e according to
some unspeciﬁed prescribed functions of time t . This general case includes the
special case of a body 0 at rest. On each body i (i = 0, . . . , n) a reference
basis ei is ﬁxed. Its origin 0i and its angular orientation on the body are
chosen arbitrarily. The schematically indicated joints are of arbitrary nature
with individual degrees of freedom 1 ≤fi ≤6 . Note: A joint with fi = 6 is
not a joint in the sense deﬁned in Chap. 4 because the number of constraints
is
fi −6 = 0 . Such a joint might have the form of a spring or damper
connection. It is assumed that for each joint i = 1, . . . , n fi joint variables
qiℓ
(ℓ= 1, . . . , fi) have been chosen which are suitable for describing the
position of body i relative to body b(i) .

11 Direct Kinematics of Tree-Structured Systems
The problem of direct kinematics is stated as follows. Determine as func-
tions of joint variables and of time derivatives of joint variables for all bodies
i = 1, . . . , n the position vector ri , the velocity ˙ri and the acceleration ¨ri of
0i relative to the common reference basis e , the direction cosine matrix Ai
deﬁned by the equation e = Aiei , the angular velocity ωi and the angular
acceleration ˙ωi relative to basis e . For body 0 these six quantities are, by
assumption, prescribed functions of time r0(t) , ˙r0(t) , ¨r0(t) , A0(t) , ω0(t)
and ˙ω0(t) . The solution to the problem is given in Sect. 11.2 . It is based on
the kinematics of individual joints which is treated ﬁrst.
11.1 Kinematics of Individual Joints
In Fig. 11.2 a single joint i of unspeciﬁed nature connecting two bodies i
and b(i) is shown. The reference bases ﬁxed on these bodies are ei and eb(i) ,
respectively. Let qi be the column matrix of joint variables qi1, . . . , qifi . The
problem of joint kinematics is stated as follows. Determine as functions of the
variables qi and of their time derivatives the following six quantities: The
position vector cb(i)i , the velocity vi and the acceleration ai relative to
eb(i) of a single point Pi ﬁxed in ei , the direction cosine matrix Gi deﬁned
by the equation
eb(i) = Giei , the angular velocity Ωi and the angular
acceleration εi of ei relative to eb(i) .
The single point Pi ﬁxed in ei is referred to as articulation point. How
to choose this point is shown further below. The articulation point has in
ei a constant position vector
cii
and in eb(i) a variable position vector
cb(i)i(qi) . The ﬁrst index refers to the body and the second to the joint.
The velocity vi and the acceleration ai relative to eb(i) are the ﬁrst and
the second time derivative, respectively, of cb(i)i in eb(i) . For joints with
holonomic constraints of arbitrary nature the six kinematical quantities have
the forms

Depending on the nature of joint i , on the choice of joint variables and on
the choice of the articulation point the vectors kiℓand piℓare either ﬁxed
on body b(i) or functions of joint variables. Vectors si ̸= 0 and wi ̸= 0
exist only if at least one of the vectors kiℓor piℓ, respectively, is not ﬁxed
on body b(i) . Vectors si and wi are second-order functions of ﬁrst time
derivatives of joint variables. It is always possible to express the coordinates
of cb(i)i and of vi and ai in basis eb(i) and the coordinates of Ωi and εi
in ei as functions of joint variables and of time derivatives of joint variables.
The four velocities and accelerations are written in the forms

of these four sets of n equations is written in matrix form. For this purpose,
column matrices Ω , ε , v , a , w
and s
of n vectors each are deﬁned
(for example
Ω = [Ω1 . . . Ωn]T ). Furthermore, column matrices ˙q and ¨q
are deﬁned which are composed of
˙qi and ¨qi , respectively (i = 1, . . . , n).
Finally, block-diagonal matrices k and p are deﬁned which have the matrices
kj and pj , respectively, along the diagonal. In terms of these matrices the
four sets of equations are
Ω = pT ˙q ,
v = kT ˙q ,
ε = pT ¨q + w ,
a = kT ¨q + s .

Examples:
1. Spherical, universal and revolute joints: The choice of the articulation point
is dictated by the nature of the joint. In a spherical joint the center of the
sphere is chosen. In a universal joint the point of intersection of the two axes
on the central cross is chosen. In a revolute joint an arbitrary point on the
joint axis is chosen. In all three cases the articulation point is ﬁxed not only
in ei , but also in eb(i) . Hence cb(i)i = const , vi = 0 and ai = 0 .
2. Revolute joint: Deﬁne the unit vector p along the joint axis and the angle
of rotation q about this axis. With these deﬁnitions Ωi = p ˙q and εi = p¨q .

11 Direct Kinematics of Tree-Structured Systems
3. Universal joint: Deﬁne axial unit vectors p1 ﬁxed on body b(i) and p2
ﬁxed on body i and angles of rotation q1 , q2 about these axes. With these
deﬁnitions Ωi = p1 ˙q1 + p2 ˙q2 and εi = p1¨q1 + p2¨q2 + Ωi × p2 ˙q2 , whence it
follows that wi = p1 × p2 ˙q1 ˙q2 .
4. Spherical joint: Three angular joint variables (Euler angles or Bryan angles)
are inconvenient because they lead to unwieldy expressions for Ωi and εi
and because singular positions cannot be avoided. It is preferable to use
Euler-Rodrigues parameters q0 , q1 , q2 , q3 . The three rotational kinematical

parameters and the coordinates Ωiℓare related through the kinematical dif-
ferential Eqs.(10.35).
5. Cylindrical joint: As articulation point an arbitrary point on the joint axis
is chosen. Furthermore, the axial unit vector p ﬁxed on both bodies, the
cartesian coordinate q1 along the axis and the angle of rotation q2 about
the axis are deﬁned. With these deﬁnitions

the unit vector e along the crank, the unit vector p normal to the plane and

prior to Sect. 11.1 is solved: Determine as functions of joint variables and of
time derivatives of joint variables for all bodies i = 1, . . . , n the position vec-
tor ri , the velocity ˙ri and the acceleration ¨ri of 0i relative to the common
reference basis e , the direction cosine matrix Ai deﬁned by the equation

set of recursive equations is developed. For applications in analytical investi-

ri with respect to time. According to Eq.(9.9) in which e1 and e2 are now
identiﬁed with e and eb(i) , respectively, the results are
˙ωi = ˙ωb(i) + εi + ωb(i) × Ωi ,

are substituted. The altogether six Eqs.(11.10) and (11.11) are evaluated
in the given order and step by step with i = 1, . . . , n . At the start with
i = 1 the leading terms on the right-hand sides are the prescribed quantities
Ab(i) = A0(t) , ωb(i) = ω0(t) , rb(i) = r0(t) etc. At each step i all quantities
on the right-hand sides of the equations are known either from the preceding
step with b(i) or from a preceding equation at step i . The matrices Ai and
Ab(i) are used for transforming vector coordinates from bases ei or eb(i)
into basis e .
11.2.2 Explicit Solution
The material presented in this section is taken from Wittenburg [2, 4]. Taking
angular velocities as example, it is seen from Fig. 11.1 that ωi (i = 1, . . . n
arbitrary) is the sum of the prescribed angular velocity ω0(t) of body 0 and
of the relative angular velocities Ωj of all joints on the direct path between
bodies 0 and i . For this reason, numbers Tji are deﬁned as follows:

According to (11.1) the term Ωj in ωi and the term vj in ˙ri are linear
combinations of ﬁrst time derivatives ˙qiℓof joint variables. Hence ωi and
˙ri have the forms

matrices p , k , w and s are determined by the kinematics of joints, and
the matrices T and C are determined by the topology of the tree.
Example: In a system with n revolute joints each joint j has a single axial
unit vector pj and a single rotation angle qj around this vector. The matrix
p is the diagonal matrix of the vectors p1, . . . , pn . As articulation points
points on the joint axes are chosen. This has the consequence that not only
the vectors cjj , but also the vectors cb(j)j
and, hence, all vectors in the
matrices C0 and C are body-ﬁxed vectors. Furthermore, k = 0 , w = 0
and s = 0 .

From the point of view of computation time required for numerical eval-
uations the recursive Eqs.(11.10), (11.11) are preferable. The explicit formu-
lation (11.20), (11.21) is useful for analytical investigations. In Chap. 19 it
is applied to dynamics of mechanisms. In this application, basis e is inertial
space, and the origins 0i of the body-ﬁxed bases ei (i = 1, . . . , n) are the
body centers of mass.

Screw Systems
In this chapter the investigation of velocity screws is resumed. Deﬁnitions see
in Sect. 9.3 .
12.1 Resultant of two Velocity Screws. Cylindroid
The system shown in Fig. 12.1 has two helical joints with skew axes and with
pitches p1 and p2 . The terminal body 2 has relative to frame 0 the degree of
freedom two. The length of the common perpendicular of the joint axes is ℓ,
and the projected angle is α . Unit vectors n1 and n2 having the directions
of the axes are attached to the midpoint 0 of the common perpendicular.
This point 0 is the origin of a frame-ﬁxed basis e . The basis vector e1 is
directed along the bisector of the angle α between n1 and n2 , and e3 is
directed along the common perpendicular. The instantaneous velocity screws
of body 1 relative to frame 0 and of body 2 relative to body 1 are (see
(9.33))
ω1(n1 , a1 ×n1 +p1n1) ,
ω2(n2 , a2 ×n2 +p2n2) ,
a1,2 = ∓ℓ
2 e3 . (12.1)
Let ω(n , a × n + p n) be the instantaneous velocity screw of body 2 rela-
tive to frame 0 . It is the resultant of the two velocity screws. Its unknown
quantities ω , n , a and p are calculated as follows. Since the superposition
principle is valid for velocities the resultant velocity screw is the sum
ω(n , a×n+p n) = ω1(n1 , a1×n1+p1n1)+ω2(n2 , a2×n2+p2n2) . (12.2)
With the above expressions for a1 and a2 this equation splits into the equa-

The ﬁrst equation expresses the parallelogram rule for angular velocities (Fig.

These equations are identical with Eqs.(3.158) and (3.159) governing the
resultant of two inﬁnitesimal screw displacements. Compare also Fig. 12.2
with Fig. 3.15 and Eqs.(12.7) and (3.156). The formal identity is explained
by the equation
d(ϕ + εs) = (ω + εv) dt . A change of variables led to
Eqs.(3.160) – (3.171) which show that the resultant screw axis is generator
of a cylindroid (Fig. 3.16). The same equations and the same ﬁgure are valid
for the resultant velocity screw.
Let P be an arbitrary point ﬁxed on body 2 of Fig. 12.1 . In the case
ω2 = 0 , P has a velocity v1 proportional to ω1 , and in the case ω1 = 0 , P
has a velocity v2 proportional to ω2 . Superposition determines the velocity
v = v1+v2 . If the point P is chosen at random, v1 and v2 are not collinear.
Together they determine a certain plane. The direction of v in this plane
depends on the ratio ω1/ω2 . The question arises: Are there body-ﬁxed points
such that v1 and v2 are collinear so that the direction of v is independent
of ω1/ω2 ? The answer is as follows. If the principal pitches of the cylindroid
determined by the velocity screws (12.1) have opposite signs, there are two
screws of zero pitch on the cylindroid (see (3.169)). Proposition: All body-
ﬁxed points P on the axes of these screws have the desired property. Proof:
Zero pitch means that for an appropriate ratio ω1/ω2 such a point P has
the resultant velocity v = v1 + v2 = 0 . This implies that v1 and v2 are
collinear. Since the directions of v1 and v2 are independent of ω1 and ω2
also the direction of v is independent. End of proof.

12.2 Relative Velocity Screw. Raccording Hyperboloids
The bodies shown in Fig. 12.3 are rotating about skew axes. The length of
the common perpendicular is ℓ, and the projected angle is α . Unit vectors
n1 and n2 having the directions of the axes are attached to the midpoint
0 of the common perpendicular. This point 0 is the origin of a frame-ﬁxed
basis e . The basis vector e1 is directed along the bisector of the angle α
between n1 and n2 , and e3 is directed along the common perpendicular.
The velocity screws of the bodies relative to the frame are
ω1(n1 , a1 × n1) ,
ω2(n2 , a2 × n2) ,
a1,2 = ∓ℓ
2 e3 .
(12.11)
Gears not shown in the ﬁgure keep the angular velocity ratio μ = ω2/ω1
constant. Without loss of generality, it is assumed that μ > 0 . Subject of
investigation is the velocity screw of body 2 relative to body 1 . Let this
relative velocity screw be denoted ω(n , a × n + p n) . It is the diﬀerence
ω(n , a × n + p n) = −ω1(n1 , a1 × n1) + ω2(n2 , a2 × n2) .

as well as these angles are functions of μ . The cosine and sine laws yield the

The resultant screw axis deﬁned by u and n is ﬁxed in basis e . In a basis
ﬁxed on the rotating body i (i = 1, 2) the screw axis generates a hyper-
boloid of revolution. Equations describing these hyperboloids are developed
as follows. Because of the rotational symmetry the hyperboloid on body i
(i = 1, 2) is described in a nonrotating cartesian xi, yi, zi-system. Its origin
is the intersection of the rotation axis i with the e3-axis. The xi-axis is
directed along e3 , and the zi-axis has the direction of ni . In this system
the equation of the hyperboloid has the normal form

with semi-axes ri and bi . The semi-axis ri is the radius of the gorge circle
of the hyperboloid i . These radii are

1 + μ2 −2μ cos α ,
r2 = ℓ

(12.20)
In the x1, y1, z1-system of body 1 the resultant screw axis lies in the plane
x1 = r1 , and its slope is z1/y1 = cot α1 . Similarly, in the x2, y2, z2-system
of body 2 the resultant screw axis lies in the plane x2 = −r2 , and its slope
is z2/y2 = cot α2 . Substitution of these expressions into (12.19) results in
the equations b2
i = r2
i cot2 αi (i = 1, 2). For ri and cot αi Eqs.(12.20) and
(12.16) are substituted. This yields identical results
b1 = b2 = b

imaginary semi-axes of both hyperboloids:
b =

This identity had to be expected. According to Painlev´e’s Theorem 9.6 the
hyperboloids are in raccording motion. This is possible only if both hyper-
boloids have, in the common resultant screw axis, identical distribution pa-
rameters and coinciding striction points. The example at the end of Sect. 2.9
has shown that the imaginary semi-axis b is the distribution parameter, and
that the striction point lies on the gorge circle.
Depending on the parameters α, ℓand μ |u| is smaller, equal or greater
than |ℓ/2| . The hyperboloid with the smaller gorge circle radius is in tangen-
tial contact either outside or inside the other hyperboloid. External contact
requires that r1 > 0 as well as r2 > 0 . Under the initial assumption μ > 0
these conditions are satisﬁed with
| cos α| < μ <
1
| cos α| .
(12.22)
In addition to tangential contact along the resultant screw axis the hyper-
boloids may have an intersection curve. An equation for this curve is deter-
mined in the x, y, z-system whose x-axis coincides with the common perpen-
dicular e3 and whose z-axis coincides with the resultant screw axis. Figure
12.4 yields the transformation relationships (abbreviations ci = cos αi , si =
sin αi (i = 1, 2) )
x1 = x + r1 ,
x2 = x −r2 ,
yi = ciy −siz ,
zi = siy + ciz
(i = 1, 2) .
(12.23)
With these expressions Eqs.(12.19) of the hyperboloids become

(12.24)
(i = 1, 2) . The arguments leading to (12.21) showed that r2
i = b2 tan2 αi
(i = 1, 2). From (12.16) it follows that tan α1/ tan α2 < 0 if r1 and r2 are
both positive and > 0 otherwise. With the signs of ri = ±bsi/ci
chosen
correctly Eqs.(12.24) become
x2c2
i + y2(c2

i ) + 2sici(xb −yz) = 0
(i = 1, 2) .
(12.25)
These equations are identically satisﬁed by all points on the z-axis. The
diﬀerence of the ﬁrst equation multiplied by c2s2 and the second equation
multiplied by c1s1 is the equation
x2c1c2 + y2(c1c2 + s1s2) = 0 .
(12.26)
From (12.16) it follows that
c1c2 = (μ cos α −1)(μ −cos α)
1 + μ2 −2μ cos α
,
c1c2 + s1s2 = cos α .

Hence (12.26) is solved by
y = ±qx
with
q =

(μ −cos α)(1 −μ cos α)
cos α(1 + μ2 −2μ cos α) .
(12.28)
When this expression is substituted into one of the Eqs.(12.25), also for z a
linear function of x is obtained. The ﬁrst equation yields

(12.29)
If q is real, the hyperboloids are not only in tangential contact along a com-
mon generator. In addition, they intersect in two more generators which are
arranged symmetrically to the generator of tangential contact. The quantity
q is real if and only if in addition to conditions (12.22) for external contact
of the hyperboloids the condition |α| ≤π/2 is satisﬁed.
Equations (12.18) – (12.28) are particularly simple in the special case of
two shafts rotating with identical angular velocities (μ = ω2/ω1 = 1 ). The
essential quantities are
ωn = ω1(n2 −n1) ,

(12.31)
The result u = 0 tells that the screw axis intersects the common perpendic-
ular of the two shafts orthogonally at the midpoint 0 , and the result for ωn
tells that the screw axis n lies along e2 . The two raccording hyperboloids
are congruent. They are in external contact along the resultant screw axis.
12.3 Rotary Piercing of Tubes over Plug
Seamless steel tubes are hot-rolled in a so-called piercing mill by a process
known as rotary piercing of tubes over plug (patent Mannesmann; see VDI-
Zeitschrift Heft 25 (1890) and Fr¨ohlich [4]). The principle is explained in Fig.
12.5. Two identical rollers 1 and 2 of radius R are rotating with equal
angular velocities Ω about skew axes. The common perpendicular of the
axes is the z-axis normal to the plane of the drawing. The projected angle
α between the axes is bisected by the x-axis. A cylinder 3 of radius r with
its axis along the x-axis is in contact with each roller at a single point on
the z-axis (at z = r with the top roller 1 and at z = −r with the bottom
roller 2 ). At these points the rollers have circumferential velocities v1 and
v2 of equal magnitude ΩR and directions as shown. When the cylinder 3

366
12 Screw Systems
Fig. 12.5 Piercing mill
is a rigid body, it follows from the rolling conditions at the points of contact
that the cylinder is in screw motion along the x-axis with translatory velocity
v = ΩR sin α/2 and with angular velocity ω = (ΩR/r) cos α/2 . The pitch is
v/ω = r tan α/2 . This velocity screw is neither the sum nor the diﬀerence of
the velocity screws of the rollers.
Actually, the hot cylinder 3 is not rigid, but deformable. It enters the mill
as a solid cylinder. It is driven by traction forces of the rollers against a conical
plug (see the ﬁgure). As a result of rotation and of stress concentration in
front of the plug the material is deformed into a cylindrical tube.
12.4 Analogy Between Force Screw and Velocity Screw
As is well known, an arbitrary system of forces F1, F2, . . . can be reduced
to an equivalent force system consisting of a single force F applied to an
arbitrarily chosen reduction point A and of a free torque (a couple) MA .
The force F is the resultant of the given forces shifted to the point A . It is
independent of the location of A . The torque MA is the resultant moment
about A of the given forces. This torque depends on the location of A . For
a diﬀerent reduction point Q given by the vector ϱ = −→
AQ the resultant
torque is
M = MA + F × ϱ .
(12.32)
This equation is analogous to Eq.(9.21) describing the velocity distribution
in a rigid body: v = vA +ω ×ϱ . Velocity is replaced by torque, and angular

12.4 Analogy Between Force Screw and Velocity Screw
367
velocity is replaced by force. Equation (9.21) led to the deﬁnition of an in-
stantaneous velocity screw with pitch p and to the associated linear complex
of velocity and to reciprocal polars associated with this linear complex. For
every Eq.(9.21) – (9.40) the analogous equation exists for torques and forces.
In what follows, this is shown in some detail. Equation (12.32) tells that
for all reduction points located on a line parallel to F the same resultant
torque is obtained (diﬀerent for diﬀerent lines). In the case F ̸= 0 , there
exists exactly one line parallel to F for the points of which the torque has
the direction of F , i.e., the torque M = p F with a scalar p of dimension
length. Hence for all points on this line p F = MA + F × ϱ . Let u be the
perpendicular from A onto this particular line. Then also
p F = MA + F × u .
(12.33)
Cross- and dot-multiplying this equation by F and using the orthogonality
F · u = 0 one gets for u and for p the expressions
u = F × MA
F2
,
p = F · MA
F2
.
(12.34)
If as reduction point A an arbitrary point on the distinguished line thus
determined is chosen, (12.32) has the form
M = p F + F × ϱ .
(12.35)
Equations (12.33) – (12.35) are analogous to (9.22) – (9.24). The entity anal-
ogous to the velocity screw (ω, v) is the force screw1 (F, M) . The screw axis
with the direction of F is determined by u . The screw has the pitch p . The
resultant torque M with respect to a point not located on the screw axis has
the direction of the tangent to the helix through this point. This point and
the plane through this point and orthogonal to the helix are a null point and
the associated null plane of the linear complex (F; M) associated with the
force screw (F, M) . The resultant torque about the null point has a zero-
component along every complex line in this null plane. This is, historically,
the reason for choosing the names null plane and null point2.
Writing again a = −ϱ and F = Fn the force screw has the standard
form analogous to (9.33):
(F, M) = F(n, a × n + p n) .
(12.36)
The scalar F is the intensity, and the factor behind is the unit screw. There
are two special cases.
1 The name force screw is used instead of wrench
2 Historically, the notion of force screw and formulas for the resultant of two force screws
(Battaglini [2]) preceded the corresponding results for inﬁnitesimal screw displacements
(Ball [1])

368
12 Screw Systems
1) Planar force system: The pitch is p = 0 . The force screw is F(n, a × n) .
2) The case F = 0 : The force system is a free couple M . A screw axis does
not exist. The pitch is not deﬁned (p = ∞according to (12.34)). Equation
(12.36) has the form (see (9.34))
(F, M) = M(0, n) .
(12.37)
The equations analogous to (9.35) – (9.37) are
ˆn = n + εa × n ,
(12.38)
ˆF = F + εM = F[n + ε(a × n + p n)]
(12.39)
= F(1 + εp)ˆn .
(12.40)
The analogy to Theorem 9.5 is
Theorem 12.1. An arbitrary force screw (F, M) (an arbitrary system of
forces) with F ̸= 0 can be represented as resultant of two forces. The line of
action of one of these forces can be chosen arbitrarily subject to the restriction
that it is not a line of the linear complex (F; M) . The line of action of the
other force is the uniquely determined reciprocal polar of the ﬁrst line.
12.5 Virtual Power of a Force Screw. Reciprocal Screws
Virtual power of forces is the key to the proof of
Theorem 12.2. If six forces F1, . . . , F6 constitute an equilibrium system,
the lines of action of these forces are complex lines of a linear complex.
The following proof is due to Sylvester [11], v.3 . Imagine that the forces are
acting on a rigid body. Equilibrium requires that the virtual power of the
forces calculated for a virtual velocity of the body is zero. The lines of action
of ﬁve forces deﬁne the axis and the pitch of a linear complex (Eqs.(2.38),
(2.29)). As virtual velocity of the body a virtual velocity screw with the
same axis and the same pitch is chosen. This has the consequence that each
of the ﬁve forces has individually zero virtual power since it is normal to the
virtual velocity of its point of application. Since the total virtual power of
all six forces must be zero also the sixth force must be normal to the virtual
velocity of its point of application. Hence also the line of action of this force
is a line of the same linear complex. End of proof.
Imagine that a rigid body is subject to a system of forces deﬁned by its
force screw. This force screw has either the general form (F, M) = F(n1, a1×
n1 + p1n1) or the special form M(0, n1) when only a free couple is acting.
Imagine, furthermore, that the instantaneous state of motion of the body is
given by its velocity screw. This screw has either the general form (ω, v) =

ω(n2, a2 × n2 + p2n2)
ω(n2, a2 × n2 + p2n2)
or the special form
v(0, n2)
in the case of pure
translation. Virtual changes of the velocity screw are expressed in the form
δω(n2, a2 × n2 + p2n2)
in the general case and in the form
δv(0, n2)
in
the special case. In Fig. 12.6 the general case is shown with unit vectors n1
and n2 along the screw axes and with vectors a1 and a2 pointing from an
arbitrary point 0 to points on the screw axes. For convenience, the points
at the feet of the common perpendicular are chosen since the second Pl¨ucker
vectors a1 × n1 and a2 × n2 are independent of which points are chosen.
The virtual power δP of the force screw calculated for the virtual change of
the velocity screw is
δP = F · δv + M · δω .
(12.41)
For screws of the general form
δP = δωF

n1 · (a2 × n2 + p2n2) + n2 · (a1 × n1 + p1n1)

(12.42)
= δωF

(a1 −a2) · n1 × n2 + (p1 + p2)n1 · n2

.
(12.43)
If one of the screws is general and the other is special, the virtual power is
δP = δP ∗n1 · n2 with either δP ∗= δωM or δP ∗= δvF . If both screws
are special, then δP = 0 .
Equilibrium requires that the virtual power is zero. If exactly one of the
screws is special, this is the orthogonality condition n1·n2 = 0 . In the general
case, the condition is
(a1 −a2) · n1 × n2 + (p1 + p2)n1 · n2 = 0
(12.44)
and in terms of the Pl¨ucker vectors ni and wi = ai × ni (i = 1, 2) of the
screw axes

The equations are symmetric with respect to the indices 1 and 2 . Two screws
satisfying the condition are called reciprocal screws. From Fig. 12.6 it is seen

370

that the scalar form is
(p1 + p2) cos α −ℓsin α = 0 ,
(12.46)
where ℓand α (both positive or zero or negative) are the length of the
common perpendicular and the projected angle between the screw axes.
Equations (12.40) and (9.37) deﬁned the dual screws:
F + εM = F(1 + εp1)ˆn1 ,
ω + εv = ω(1 + εp2)ˆn2 ,
ˆni = ni + εai × ni
(12.47)
(i = 1, 2) . The scalar product of the dual unit screws is
(1+εp1)(1+εp2)ˆn1·ˆn2 = n1·n2+ε[(a1−a2)·n1×n2+(p1+p2)n1·n2] . (12.48)
The reciprocity condition (12.44) is satisﬁed if the dual part of the scalar
product is zero.
Example: The robot arm shown in Fig. 12.7 is mounted on a stationary
frame 0 . Bodies 0, 1, 2 and 3 are interconnected by a revolute joint 1 , a
prismatic joint 2 and a helical joint 3 with given pitch p3 . The joint axes
are deﬁned by their unit vectors n1 , n2 , n3 . Joint variables are rotation
angles ϕ1 , ϕ3 in joints 1 and 3 , respectively, and translatory displacements
s2 and s3 = p3ϕ3 in joints 2 and 3 , respectively. Each of these variables
describes the position of the outer body relative to the inner body, and in
each joint the positive direction is the direction of the axial unit vector. Two
problems are stated as follows.
1. Given ˙ϕ1 , ˙s2 and ˙ϕ3 , determine the angular velocity ω3 of body 3 and
the velocity vP of the given point P , both relative to the frame.
2. Body 3 is subject to a force F applied at P and to a torque MP about P .
Determine the column matrix [M1 F2 M3]T of axial joint torques and forces
to be produced by motors in the joints such that the robot is in equilibrium.
Formulate the conditions M1 = 0 , F2 = 0 and M3 = 0 .
Solution to Problem 1 : The principle of superposition yields for ω3 and vP
the expressions
ω3 = ˙ϕ1n1+ ˙ϕ3n3 ,
vP = ˙ϕ1a1×n1+ ˙s2n2+ ˙ϕ3a3×n3+p3 ˙ϕ3n3
(12.49)
with vectors a1 and a3 pointing from P to arbitrary points of the joint axes
1 and 3 , respectively (see Fig. 12.7). The matrix form of the equations is

coeﬃcient matrix (j = 1, 2, 3) is the unit screw of joint j (see (9.33) and
(9.34)).
Solution to Problem 2 : Equilibrium requires that under virtual velocities the
virtual power δP of all forces and torques acting on the system equals zero.
This is the condition

12.6 Reciprocal Screw Systems
Constraint forces in joints of a mechanism have zero virtual power. For this
reason they need not be taken into account in equations expressing the princi-
ple of virtual power. This advantage of the principle, as compared with other
methods, is clearly demonstrated by the equilibrium condition (12.51). It is
even more important when the principle is used for formulating dynamics
equations of motion of mechanisms (see Eq.(19.3)).
In what follows, constraint forces in joints of mechanisms are the subject of
investigation. General statements are derived from the fact that their virtual
power is zero. In abstract form this is expressed in
Theorem 12.3. The force screw of an arbitrary system of constraint forces
acting on a single body of a mechanism is reciprocal to a virtual velocity screw
of the body.
The degree of freedom of the single body under investigation is in the range
1 ≤f ≤5 . Depending on the nature of the mechanism the virtual veloc-
ity screw of the body is either general or special. Only the general case is
treated in detail although the simpler special case is typical for the majority
of mechanisms used in engineering.
In Sect. 4.1 on Gr¨ubler’s formula it was said that a body with degree of
freedom f is subject to N = 6 −f linearly independent constraints. The
precise meaning of linear independence can now be formulated as follows.
Reciprocity of a virtual velocity screw having the unit screw (n, a×n+p n)
to N force screws having unit screws (ni, ai × ni + pini) (i = 1, . . . , N)
is expressed by N equations of the form (12.44). With the abbreviations
m = a × n + p n and mi = ai × ni + pini (i = 1, . . . , N) the equations can
also be written in the form (see (12.42))
mi · n + ni · m = 0
(i = 1, . . . , N) .
(12.55)
This is a set of N homogeneous linear equations for the coordinates of n
and m . The force screws are linearly independent if the (N × 6) coeﬃcient
matrix has the full rank N . In this case, the set of equations has 6 −N
linearly independent nontrivial solutions (n , m) . Any linear combination of
these solutions is itself a solution. The vectors n and m of every solution
determine the associated perpendicular n × m/n2 onto the screw axis and
the associated pitch p = n · m/n2 .
Before going into details it is pointed out again that every statement about
degree of freedom, about velocity screws and about force screws is referring
to an instantaneous position of the body, i.e., of the mechanism. Any gen-
eralization to continuous motions with changing relative positions of bodies
requires additional arguments beyond the scope of the present investigation.
If the body under consideration has the degree of freedom f = 1 , it
is characterized by a single velocity screw and by a system of ﬁve linearly

12.6 Reciprocal Screw Systems
373
independent reciprocal force screws. In the case f = 2 , the number of linearly
independent velocity screws is two, and the number of linearly independent
force screws is four. The two linearly independent velocity screws deﬁne a
cylindroid, and any resultant of the four linearly independent force screws
is reciprocal to every velocity screw on the cylindroid or, shorter, reciprocal
to the cylindroid. In the case f = 3 , the number of linearly independent
velocity screws as well as the number of linearly independent reciprocal force
screws is three. An investigation beyond f = 3 is unnecessary. In the case
f = 4 , for example, the manifold of all force screws deﬁnes a cylindroid,
whereas the manifold of all velocity screws are the screws reciprocal to this
cylindroid. In what follows, the mutually reciprocal screw systems of order
one to ﬁve are investigated. Additional material see in Timerding [12]. Hunt
[5] and Phillips [8] demonstrate applications of reciprocal screws to the study
of mechanisms.
12.6.1 First-Order Screw System and Reciprocal
Fifth-Order System
The general form of the ﬁrst-order system is a single unit screw (n, w + p n)
with Pl¨ucker vectors n and w of its axis and with pitch p . The ﬁfth-
order system reciprocal to this screw consists of all screws (n1, w1 + p1n1)
satisfying the reciprocity condition (12.45):
n · w1 + [w + (p + p1)n] · n1 = 0 .
(12.56)
This is Eq.(2.25), a·w1+b·n1 = 0 , deﬁning the linear complex (a; b) with
a = n and b = w+(p+p1)n . Equations (2.29) yield the pitch a·b = p+p1
of this linear complex and the perpendicular onto its axis u = a×b = n×w .
The Pl¨ucker vectors of this axis are a = n and w1 = u × n = w . Thus,
the ﬁfth-order screw system (n1, w1 + p1n1) reciprocal to the single screw
(n, w + p n) is the manifold of all linear complexes having the axis (n, w)
of the given screw and the pitch p + p1 with p1 being a free parameter. In
the special case p1 = −p , there is a single reciprocal screw along the axis
(n, w) . All reciprocal screws of given pitch
p1 ̸= −p
(arbitrary) passing
through a given point P (arbitrary) are in the null plane associated with the
null point P of the linear complex with axis (n, w) and with pitch p + p1 .
If a ﬁfth-order screw system is given by ﬁve linearly independent screws
(ni, wi + pini) (i = 1, . . . , 5), the single screw (n, w + p n) reciprocal to all
ﬁve is determined from (12.55).
Example: In Sect. 12.2 the relative motion of two wheels rotating with
constant angular velocity ratio μ = ω2/ω1 = const
about skew axes was
shown to be a velocity screw ω(n, n×r+p n) (see Fig. 12.3). The direction of

374
12 Screw Systems
the axis is determined by the parallelogram rule ω = ω2 −ω1 (Eq.(12.13)).
The pitch
p(μ)
is given in the ﬁrst Eq.(12.18). The second equation for
u(μ) determines the point where the screw axis intersects orthogonally the
common perpendicular of the two wheel axes. Imagine the two wheels to be
a pair of gears with any kind of teeth appropriate for keeping the relative
velocity screw constant. Let P be an arbitrary point at which, in the course
of meshing, two tooth ﬂanks are in tangential contact, and let n1 be the
common unit normal vector at P . The normal contact force Fn1 exerted at
P by one tooth ﬂank on the other is a force screw F(n1, n1 ×r+p1n1) with
pitch p1 = 0 . Being a constraint force with zero virtual power the force screw
is reciprocal to the relative velocity screw. Hence the conclusion (Phillips
[9]): Whatever tooth shapes are chosen and wherever tangential contact is
established in the course of meshing the common normal at the point of
contact must belong to the linear complex having the axis and the pitch p of
the relative velocity screw. This statement is an expression of the fact that
the relative sliding velocity at the point of contact, v21 = ω(n × ρ + p n)
with ρ being the vector from an arbitrary point on the screw axis to the
contact point, has the direction of the helix through the contact point. If one
tooth ﬂank is prescribed, the other, so-called conjugate ﬂank is determined
by this condition. In Sect. 16.2 this is shown in more detail. End of example.
12.6.2 Second-Order Screw System and Reciprocal
Fourth-Order System
The general form of the second-order system is the screw system on a cylin-
droid. Some of its properties are known from Eqs.(3.150) – (3.172) and from
Fig. 3.16 . The third-order Eq.(3.171) of the cylindroid is
z(x2 + y2) = 2hxy ,
2h = py −px .
(12.57)
The z-axis is the directrix. The principal screws along x-axis and y-axis have
the principal pitches px and py , respectively. In the context of reciprocity
conjugate screws (screws of equal pitch) play an important role. For simpli-
ﬁcation the expression ‘two screws intersect’ means that ‘the axes of the two
screws intersect’. From (12.46) it follows that a screw along the z-axis with
arbitrary pitch including p = ∞(pure translation) is reciprocal to the cylin-
droid, because all screws on the cylindroid are intersected perpendicularly by
the z-axis. Another consequence of Eq.(12.46) is
Theorem 12.4. Let σ and σ be two conjugate screws of pitch p (arbitrary)
on the cylindroid. Any screw τ intersecting both σ and σ (the two points
of intersection being arbitrary) and having the pitch −p is reciprocal to both

12.6 Reciprocal Screw Systems
375
σ and σ and, hence, to the cylindroid since every screw on the cylindroid is
a linear combination of the two conjugate screws.
Special reciprocal screws identiﬁed by this theorem are the screw along the x-
axis with pitch −px and the screw along the y-axis with pitch −py . Indeed,
either one of them is reciprocal to both principal screws and, hence, to the
cylindroid.
From the third-order Eq.(12.57) of the cylindroid it follows that any line
neither parallel nor orthogonal to the z-axis intersects the cylindroid in three
points located on three screws (two of which may coalesce or be imaginary).
In particular
Theorem 12.5. A screw τ intersecting two conjugate screws σ and σ of
pitch p intersects a third screw σ∗on the cylindroid perpendicularly. And
conversely: If a screw τ intersects one screw σ∗perpendicularly, it inter-
sects, in addition, two conjugate screws (which may coalesce or be imagi-
nary).
The ﬁrst statement is proved as follows. By Theorem 12.4 the screw with
pitch −p is reciprocal to σ∗since σ∗is a linear combination of the two
conjugate screws with pitch p . However, the pitch of σ∗is diﬀerent from
p since not more than two screws on the cylindroid have identical pitches.
Therefore, reciprocity of τ and σ∗requires, because of (12.46), that τ and
σ∗intersect perpendicularly. This ends the proof of the ﬁrst statement. The
converse is true since it follows from (12.57) that none of the other two screws
intersected by τ is intersected perpendicularly. Therefore, reciprocity to τ
requires that both have the same pitch. End of proof.
In what follows, analytical methods are used for proving that there are no
reciprocal screws other than those covered by Theorem 12.4 . The analysis
will show that every point not lying on the z-axis is apex of a second-order
cone all generators of which are axes of reciprocal screws. The cylindroid is
represented by a pair of conjugate screws σ and σ with angles χ and −χ
(arbitrary). Their common pitch is given by (3.167),
p1,2 = px cos2 χ + py sin2 χ ,
(12.58)
and their ﬁrst and second normalized Pl¨ucker vectors, denoted n1 , w1 and
n2 , w2 , have the x, y, z-coordinates (see (3.172))
n1,2 : [ cos χ ±sin χ
0 ] ,
w1,2 : (py−px) sin χ cos χ [ −sin χ ±cos χ
0 ] .
(12.59)
Let τ be the unknown reciprocal screw with normalized Pl¨ucker vectors n
and w and with pitch p . The coordinates of n are denoted [nx ny nz] . Let
x, y, z be the coordinates of a point on the screw axis. The second Pl¨ucker
vector w has the coordinates [ −zny + ynz
znx −xnz
−ynx + xny ] . The
screw τ must satisfy the two reciprocity conditions (12.45):

(i = 1, 2) .
(12.60)
These equations are
(py −px) sin χ cos χ(−sin χnx ± cos χny)
+ cos χ(−zny + ynz) ± sin χ(znx −xnz)
+ (p + px cos2 χ + py sin2 χ)(cos χnx ± sin χny) = 0 .
(12.61)
The sum and the diﬀerence of the equations are
(px + p)nx −zny + ynz = 0 ,
znx + (py + p)ny −xnz = 0 .

(12.62)
Solving for p yields the equivalent expressions
p = zny −ynz

−px = xnz −znx

(12.63)
Elimination of p results in the equation
(xnx + yny)nz −z(n2
x + n2
y) −(py −px)nxny = 0 .
(12.64)
Let x0, y0, z0 be the coordinates of an arbitrary point P not lying on the
z-axis. A reciprocal screw τ passing through P has direction cosines nx ,
ny , nz which are proportional to (x −x0) , (y −y0) , (z −z0) , respectively.
Hence the reciprocal screws passing through P are deﬁned by the equation
( py −px = 2h )
[x(x−x0)+y(y−y0)](z−z0)−z[(x−x0)2+(y−y0)2]−2h(x−x0)(y−y0) = 0 .
(12.65)
This is the equation of a second-order cone with apex P . The cone is referred
to as reciprocal cone. Its properties are revealed by investigating the curves
of intersection with planes z = const and with the cylindroid.
The cone has a generator parallel to the z-axis (the equation is satisﬁed
by x = x0 , y = y0 and z arbitrary). At a point called A this generator
intersects a single screw of the cylindroid (perpendicularly). Let σ0 be this
screw. Its angle χ0 against the x-axis is χ0 = tan−1(y0/x0) . The conjugate
screw σ0 lies under the angle −χ0 against the x-axis. These two screws lie
in the planes z = h sin 2χ0 and z = −h sin 2χ0 , respectively. In Fig. 12.8a
the screws σ0 and σ0 are shown in the projection along the z-axis (brieﬂy
called vertical projection). The points P and A are projected into the point
called P0 . Among all planes z = const the plane z = −z0 is the one for
which Eq.(12.65) is simplest, namely,
z0(x2 + y2 −x2
0 −y2
0) + 2h(x −x0)(y −y0) = 0 .
(12.66)

Let this conic section be denoted e1 . It is passing through P0 with the slope
−x0/y0 , i.e., perpendicularly to σ0 . Its principal axes are rotated 45◦against
the x, y-directions. This rotation is accomplished by the substitution

The conic section is either elliptic or parabolic or hyperbolic depending on
whether |z0| −|h| is positive or zero or negative, respectively. The ellipse
e1 shown in Fig. 12.8a is associated with the parameters x0 = 4 , y0 = 3 ,
z0 = 2 , h = 1 . It is used for illustrating relationships which, in modiﬁed
form, are valid in the parabolic and in the hyperbolic case, as well.
In the vertical projection every generator of the reciprocal cone intersects

of this generator and, with (12.63), the associated pitch p . With this pitch,
the screw τ having the generator PG as axis is reciprocal to the cylindroid.
The pitch associated with the generator parallel to the z-axis is ∞since
nz/nx and nz/ny tend towards ∞when G tends towards P0 .
Equation (12.65) of the cone as well as Eq.(12.57) of the cylindroid is linear
in z . Elimination of z results in an equation for the curve of intersection of
cone and cylindroid in the vertical projection. Collecting the terms involving
z (12.65) has the form
−z0[x(x−x0)+y(y−y0)]−2h(x−x0)(y−y0)+z[x0(x−x0)+y0(y−y0)] = 0 .
(12.71)
Substituting for z the expression
z = 2hxy/(x2 + y2)
from (12.57) and
multiplying with (x2 + y2) results in the equation

This shows that the cone and the cylindroid intersect in curves which, in
vertical projection, are a circle and another second-order curve e2 with prin-
cipal axes rotated 45◦against the x, y-system. The circle called c is shown
in Fig. 12.8a . It is independent of z0 . It is passing through the origin 0
and through P0 , and its center M is midpoint between these points. The
other second-order curve e2 is passing through the origin 0 with the slope
−y0/x0 , which means that at 0 it is tangent to σ0 . The transformation

Comparison with (12.69) shows that e2 and e1 are concentric and similar the
size ratio being z0/h . In Fig. 12.8a both ellipses are shown. The conic sec-
tion e2 intersects the x-axis (the y-axis) at x = 2hy0/z0 (at y = 2hx0/z0 ).
Equation (12.73) yields the slope of the tangents t1 and t2 to e2 at these
points. It is easily veriﬁed that both tangents are passing through P0 . The
sector formed by the two tangents including the tangents themselves is de-
noted Φ . Since e2 is section of a cone it is located in a plane. In general,
a plane intersects the third-order cylindroid in a third-order curve. In the
present case, this curve splits into the conic section e2 and a straight line.
This straight line is the tangent σ0 of e2 .
The reciprocal cone and its intersections with the cylindroid are inter-
preted geometrically as follows. Let Σ be the plane spanned by the point A
on σ0 and by the conjugate screw σ0 . For reasons explained above plane Σ
intersects the cylindroid in the straight line σ0 and in a second-order curve.
Since the cylindroid is conﬁned to the interval |z| ≤|h| , the curve must be
an ellipse e . For reasons explained later it is the ellipse which in the verti-
cal projection appears as circle c . Thus, σ0 is common to the two planes
in which the cylindroid is intersected by the reciprocal cone. The ellipse e
intersects the line σ0 at the point C on the z-axis and at the point B at
the foot of the perpendicular from A (the angle at B is right also in vertical
projection). The vertical distance between A and B is zA−zB = 2h sin 2χ0 .
The projected distance is 2r sin 2χ0 where r is the radius of circle c . Hence
the angle of inclination α of plane Σ is determined by tan α = h/r . Since
the ellipse extends from z = −h to z = h the semi-major axis of the ellipse
is
a =

sin α = h
√
1 + tan2 α

h2 + r2 .
(12.76)
These results establish as by-product
Theorem 12.6. A circular cylinder of radius r having the directrix as gen-
erator intersects the cylindroid in an ellipse with semi-axes r and
√
h2 + r2 .
Figure 12.8b shows the screw σ0 and the ellipse e with points A , B and
C in their own plane Σ . Let D be an arbitrary point on the screw σ0 .
From Theorem 12.5 it follows that at the point of intersection Q with e the
line AD intersects a third screw σ∗orthogonally. When D is point C the
third screw σ∗is the only other screw which, together with σ0 , intersects
the z-axis at this point C . When D is point B the third screw σ∗coalesces
with σ0 expressing the fact that plane Σ is tangent to the cylindroid at B .
This explains why the ellipse e is passing through B and C .

12 Screw Systems
The line AQ and the associated orthogonal screw σ∗are shown also in
the projection of Fig. 12.8a . In this projection the orthogonality is nothing
but Thales’ theorem on the circle c . The screw σ∗is orthogonal not only to
the line AQ , but also to the generator PQ of the reciprocal cone. From the
second part of Theorem 12.5 it follows that the generator PQ intersects the
cylindroid in two conjugate screws, i.e., at two points. In the projection of
Fig. 12.8a these are the points Q1 and Q2 on e2 . They are real if the line
P0Q belongs to Φ . In this case, the lines 0Q1 and 0Q2 are the projections
of the two conjugate screws. With their angle against the x-axis (12.58)
determines the pitch, say p′ . The screw PQ with pitch −p′ is reciprocal
to the cylindroid. Screws on the cylindroid have pitches p′ in the interval
px ≤p′ ≤py
(assuming arbitrarily that px < py ). Hence the conclusion:
Reciprocal screws PQ with projections P0Q belonging to Φ have pitches
−py ≤−p′ ≤−px . All other reciprocal screws on the cone have pitches out-
side this range. The reciprocal screws with pitches −px and −py have axes
which are, in the vertical projection, the tangents t1 and t2 , respectively. It
is easily veriﬁed, that the points of intersection of e2 with the ξ, η-axes are
located on the line passing through P0 and through the center of e2 . From
this it follows that the reciprocal screw having, in the vertical projection, this
axis has the pitch −1

Except for one special case, this ends the geometrical interpretation of
the reciprocal cone. The special case is the one when the apex P is on the
cylindroid, i.e., P=A . In this case, the cone breaks up into two planes. One
of them is plane Σ . According to Theorem 12.4 every screw in Σ passing
through A and having the pitch −p ( p being the pitch of σ0 and σ0 ) is
reciprocal to the cylindroid. The second plane Σ′ is the one normal to σ0
and passing3 through A . According to Theorem 12.5 every line in this plane
and passing through A intersects two (not necessarily real) conjugate screws
having an associated pitch p′ . Therefore, the screw having this line as axis
and the pitch −p′ is reciprocal to the cylindroid. This ends the analysis of
the fourth-order screw system reciprocal to a given cylindroid.
In what follows, the inverse problem is solved: Determine the cylindroid re-
ciprocal to a given fourth-order screw system represented by four independent
screws labeled 1, 2, 3, 4 . The method of solution is due to Ball [1]. Let the
four given screws be ordered such that their pitches are p1 < p2 < p3 < p4 .
Screws 1 and 3 deﬁne the cylindroid (1, 3), and screws 2 and 4 deﬁne the
cylindroid (2, 4). Choose a pitch p such that p2 < p < p3 . On each of the
cylindroids (1, 3) and (2, 4) there are two real conjugate screws having this
pitch p . These altogether four screws have two transversals. Let σ and τ
be the two screws having these transversals as axes and the pitch −p . By

by the transformation
x = x′ cos χ0 −y′ sin χ0 ,
y = x′ sin χ0 + y′ cos χ0 ,
z = z′ +
h sin 2χ0
Σ′ is the plane x′ = 2r . Substitution into (12.57) yields the desired equation:
z′(4r2 + y′2) + 2hy′(y′ sin 2χ0 −2r cos 2χ0) = 0

12.6 Reciprocal Screw Systems

Theorem 12.4 the cylindroid determined by σ and τ is reciprocal to the four
screws 1, 2, 3, 4 . Thus, the problem is solved.
This section is closed by the demonstration of still another property of
the cylindroid. Proposition: For every screw 1 on the cylindroid speciﬁed by
its angle χ1 , by its coordinate z1 = h sin 2χ1 and by its pitch p1 = p0 −
h cos 2χ1 there exists one other screw 2 on the cylindroid with an angle χ2 ,
with the coordinate z2 = h sin 2χ2 and with the pitch p2 = p0 −h cos 2χ2
such that the screws 1 and 2 are reciprocal to each other. Proof: As condition
for reciprocity Eq.(12.46) is used: (p1 + p2) cos α −ℓsin α = 0 . Substitution
of
p1 + p2 = 2p0 −h(cos 2χ1 + cos 2χ2) ,
ℓ= h(sin 2χ2 −sin 2χ1)
and
α = χ2 −χ1 yields
2p0 cos(χ2 −χ1) −h

(cos 2χ1 + cos 2χ2) cos(χ2 −χ1)
+(sin 2χ2 −sin 2χ1) sin(χ2 −χ1)

= 0 .
(12.77)
The factor of h being 2 cos(χ2 + χ1) this becomes
tan χ1 tan χ2 = −p0 −h
p0 + h = −px
py
.
(12.78)
This equation determines for every angle χ1 two angles χ2 and χ2 + π
belonging to one and the same screw 2 . This ends the proof. Proposition:
The pitches p1 and p2 associated with any such pair of reciprocal screws on
the cylindroid satisfy the identity

p2

px

py
or
p1p2

(12.79)
Proof: In terms of tangents the pitches are (see (3.167))
pi = px + py tan2 χi
1 + tan2 χi
(i = 1, 2) .
(12.80)
These expressions are substituted into the equation p1p2(px + py) = (p1 +
p2)pxpy . Upon multiplying out
(tan χ1 tan χ2)2
is replaced by (px/py)2 .
This proves the identity.

three velocity screws having the basis vectors as screw axes. These screws
have the standard form ωx( ex , pxex ) , ωy( ey , pyey ) , ωz( ez , pzez ) with
ﬁxed pitches px , py , pz and with variable intensities ωx , ωy , ωz . The
resultant velocity screw has the standard form
(ω , a × ω + p ω ) = ω (n , a × n + p n )
(12.81)
with intensity ω and with normalized Pl¨ucker vectors n and a × n of the
screw axis. The unknowns are determined from the equations
ω n = ωxex + ωyey + ωzez ,
(12.82)
ω (a × n + p n) = ωxpxex + ωypyey + ωzpzez
(12.83)
From the ﬁrst equation it follows that ωx = ωnx etc. Hence the second
equation becomes
a × n + p n = pxnxex + pynyey + pznzez .
(12.84)
Scalar multiplication by n yields for the pitch

or
p3 −(px + py + pz)p2 + (x2 + y2 + z2 + pxpy + pypz + pzpx)p
−(pxx2 + pyy2 + pzz2 + pxpypz) = 0 .
(12.88)
For any given point [ x y z ] this third-order equation has three (real or
complex) roots p1 , p2 , p3 . By Vieta’s theorem, p1 + p2 + p3 = px + py +
pz = const
(coeﬃcient of −p2 ). The number of real roots depends upon
the discriminant D (see Bronstein/Semendjajev/Musiol/M¨uhlig [3]). The
equation D = 0 deﬁnes a surface of sixth order in x , y and z separating
two domains D < 0 and D > 0 . Through each point [ x y z ] in the domain
D < 0 three screw axes with diﬀerent real pitches p1 , p2 , p3 are passing, and

12.6 Reciprocal Screw Systems

through each point in the domain D > 0 a single screw axis with real pitch is
passing. The coordinates nx , ny , nz of the unit eigenvector associated with
an eigenvalue pi of multiplicity one are determined by two of the Eqs.(12.86)
in combination with the condition n2

z = 1 . In what follows, it is
assumed that
pz < py < px
(12.89)
thereby excluding the special cases
pz = py < px ,
pz < py = px
and
pz = py = px . For p = const Eq.(12.87) is the equation of a real hyperboloid
of one sheet if p is in the interval pz ≤p ≤px . The axes of all screws with
given pitch p are generators belonging to one and the same regulus of the
respective hyperboloid. All screws having pitch −p and screw axes belonging
to the other regulus are reciprocal to the ﬁrst ones because every generator
of one regulus intersects all generators of the other regulus. All hyperboloids
have the x, y, z-axes as principal axes. The following ﬁve cases have to be
distinguished
1. pz < p < py :
Hyperboloid x2/a2 + y2/b2 −z2/c2 = 1 ; elliptical cross

Zero-pitch screws about generators of one regulus are reciprocal to zero-pitch
screws about generators of the other regulus. Hence

12 Screw Systems
The practical signiﬁcance of this theorem is illustrated in Fig. 12.9 . The body
with a spherical head is the terminal body of a chain with three revolute
joints along skew axes n1 , n2 and n3 . In the absence of the support of the
spherical head the body is free to move instantaneously with independent
angular velocities (zero-pitch velocity screws) about the three lines. Through
these lines a hyperboloid is determined on which the lines belong to one
regulus (regulus 1). The other regulus 2 is the manifold of all transversals
t1 , t2 , t3 etc. of the three lines. Forces (zero-pitch force screws) along these
lines are reciprocal to zero-pitch velocity screws along lines of regulus 1 .
The rigid support of the spherical head is causing such a force along the line
t1 . Neither this force nor constraint forces along other transversals have any
eﬀect on the instantaneous mobility of the body. The hyperboloid is the pitch
quadric of the two mutually reciprocal zero-pitch screw systems.

Shaft Couplings
A shaft coupling is, in the broadest sense, a mechanical device transmitting
rotational motion from a shaft 1 to another shaft 2 . In addition, a shaft
coupling may serve the purpose of keeping one shaft in position relative to
the other. Example: If both shafts are mounted in bearings in a common
frame, a pair of gears having the transmission ratio one (spur gears, bevel
gears or hypoid gears depending on the relative location of the shafts) is
a shaft coupling transmitting rotational motion in such a way that ω1 =
const in shaft 1 causes ω2 ≡ω1 = const
in shaft 2 . If both shafts are
mounted in parallel and suﬃciently close together, an Oldham coupling is
serving the same purpose. The Oldham coupling is functioning properly even
in the case when the distance between the shafts is changing during operation.
Neither gears nor Oldham couplings serve the purpose of keeping one shaft
in position relative to the other. Another example: Only shaft 1 is mounted
in ﬁxed bearings. Shaft 2 is required to intersect shaft 1 at a given point
0 whereas its direction is free to change. Bevel gears are not applicable in
this case. A common Hooke’s joint (also called universal joint) is a possible
shaft coupling. Its cross-shaped central body serves the purpose of keeping
the shafts intersecting at 0 . In addition, rotational motion is transmitted
from shaft 1 to shaft 2 . However, as will be seen in the following section,
ω1 = const
in shaft 1 does not cause ω2 ≡ω1 = const
in shaft 2 . Shaft
couplings allowing changes of relative position while maintaining the identity
ω2 ≡ω1 are called homokinetic. The general theory of homokinetic couplings
is the subject of Sect. 13.4. The engineering importance and a simple example
were explained in Sect. 4.2.6.

13 Shaft Couplings
13.1 Hooke’s Joint
In the plane of Fig. 13.1 two shafts 1 and 2 are mounted in bearings such
that the shaft axes intersect at point 0 under a constant angle α . The shafts
are coupled by a Hooke’s joint. Its essential element is a cross-shaped central
body. Each shaft is connected to this body by a revolute joint the axis of
which is normal to the shaft. On the central body the two joint axes intersect
orthogonally at 0 . In the ﬁgure the system is shown in a position in which
one axis of the central body is in the plane of the drawing, while the other
axis is perpendicular to it. The central body and the two revolute joints
together constitute Hooke’s joint. The angle α is a free parameter which in
Fig. 13.1 is prescribed by the other two revolute joints connecting the shafts
to a frame. The entire system composed of frame, shafts, central body and
of four revolute joints represents a spherical four-bar with center 0 . From
Chap. 4 it is known that the degree of freedom is one. Thus, Hooke’s joint
transmits a rotation from shaft 1 to shaft 2 . Let ϕ1 and ϕ2 be the angles of
rotation of shaft 1 and of shaft 2 , respectively, relative to the frame. They
are related by a constraint equation
f(ϕ1, ϕ2) = 0 . In what follows, this
equation is formulated. Subsequently, various other kinematical relationships
are derived from this equation.
In Fig. 13.1
e1 and e2 are two reference bases ﬁxed on the frame. Their
common basis vectors e1
3 = e2
3 are normal to the plane of the two shafts,
and e1
1 and e2
1 are directed along the respective shaft axes. The bases are
related by the constant transformation matrix

Let n1 and n2 be unit vectors ﬁxed on the central body along the joint
axes. In the position shown in Fig. 13.1 n1 = e1
2 . Let this be the position
ϕ1 = 0 of shaft 1 and the position ϕ2 = −π/2 of shaft 2 . This means that
ϕ2 = 0 is the position when n2 = e2
2 . In a position ϕ1 (arbitrary) n1 has

position ϕ2 (arbitrary) n2 has in e2 the coordinate matrix
n2
2 = [0 cos ϕ2 sin ϕ2]T .
(13.2)
Transformation yields the coordinate matrix n1
2 = A12n2
2 in basis e1 . The
coordinate matrices n1
1 and n1
2 determine the coordinate matrix n1

⎡
⎣
−cos α sin ϕ1 cos ϕ2 + cos ϕ1 sin ϕ2
−sin α sin ϕ1 cos ϕ2

⎤
⎦.
(13.3)
From the ﬁrst two matrices the desired relationship
f(ϕ1, ϕ2) = 0 is ob-
tained. Orthogonality of the vectors n1 and n2 requires that n1 · n2 = 0 .
This is the equation f(ϕ1, ϕ2) = cos ϕ1 cos α cos ϕ2 + sin ϕ1 sin ϕ2 = 0 or
tan ϕ2 tan ϕ1 = −cos α .
(13.4)
This relationship was ﬁrst published in 1824 by Jean Victor Poncel´et (1788-
1867) (see also Poncel´et [15]). The output angle ϕ2 is an odd, π-periodic
function of the input angle ϕ1 . It is independent of the sign of α . In view
of Fig. 13.1 this had to be expected. The equation yields the expressions

Diﬀerentiation of (13.4) with respect to time results in the equation

This is an even π-periodic function of ϕ1 . In the case

The diﬀerence
χ(ϕ1) = ϕ2 −ϕ1 + π/2
is an odd π-periodic function
of ϕ1 (note that ϕ2 = −π/2 when ϕ1 = 0 ). Its maxima and minima of
equal absolute value occur in positions when ˙ϕ2 = ˙ϕ1 . According to (13.7)
this is the case when
cos2 ϕ1 = 1/(1 + cos α) . From this it follows that
sin2 ϕ1 = cos α/(1 + cos α) and tan ϕ1 = √cos α . Furthermore, according
to (13.4), tan ϕ2 = −√cos α . This yields for the maximum of χ the formula

Example: χmax ≈4.1◦at ϕ1 ≈42.9◦for α = 30◦. The Taylor formula
for small angles α is χmax ≈α2/4 . End of example.
13.1.1 Polhode and Herpolhode Cones of the Central
Cross
The cross-shaped central body is executing a periodic motion about a ﬁxed
point. For this reason, both the polhode cone and the herpolhode cone are
closed cones. In what follows, these cones are determined1. Let
˙ψ1n1 and
˙ψ2n2 be the angular velocities of the cross relative to the two shafts so that
the angular velocity ω of the cross relative to the frame has the alternative
forms
ω = ˙ϕ1e1
1 + ˙ψ1n1 = ˙ϕ2e2
1 + ˙ψ2n2 .
(13.11)
In the reference basis with basis vectors n1 , n2 , n3 = n1 × n2 ﬁxed on the
cross ω has the coordinates

The scalar products are read from (13.2) and (13.3). For cos ϕ2 , sin ϕ2 and

These equations are parameter equations of the polhode cone (the moving
cone) with ϕ1 as parameter. The cone is best portrayed by its curve of
intersection with a plane parallel to the n1, n2-plane. This curve has the

Squaring both equations leads to expressions for cos2 ϕ1 and for sin2 ϕ1 .
Their sum equals one. This is the parameter-free equation
x2 + x2y2 + y2 = tan2 α .
(13.15)
In Fig. 13.2 curves are shown for various angles α . The ellipse is explained
later. An investigation of the curvature shows that the transition from convex
to nonconvex curves occurs at α = 60◦. The smaller α the better is the ap-
proximation of a circle of radius α . In joints used in engineering angles up to
approximately α = 35◦are realizable. At the points of symmetry of the curve
marked by |x| = |y| (13.15) yields y2 = 1/ cos α−1 . Equation (13.14) yields
for the associated angle ϕ1 the expression
sin ϕ1 =

cos α/(1 + cos α) .
This is the angle associated with the maximum diﬀerence χmax .
The herpolhode cone (the ﬁxed cone) is determined by the coordinates
of ω in basis e1 . Let these coordinates be denoted Ω1 , Ω2 , Ω3 . Equation
(13.11) in combination with (13.3) and with

Figure 13.3 shows the location of the herpolhode cone and of this ellipse
relative to the two shafts. Both shaft axes are generators of the cone. The
projection of the ellipse along the axis of shaft 2 is a circle. In the position
ϕ1 = 0 the planes of intersection of the cones coincide, and the common
generator ω lies in the shaft axis 2 . In Fig. 13.2 the ellipse associated with
α = 75◦is shown in this position. For arbitrary α and in every position ϕ1
the ﬁxed cone lies entirely inside the moving cone so that rolling of one cone
on the other is possible without collision. Per revolution of shaft 1 the vector

ω is sweeping out the ﬁxed cone twice and the moving cone once. This means
that the moving cone is rolling around the ﬁxed cone twice per revolution of
shaft 1 .
The cones are known from Sect. 10.1. The motion studied there is the
inverse of the motion of the central cross. The moving cone of one motion is
the ﬁxed cone of the other and vice versa (compare (13.15) and (13.18) with
(10.19)).
In preparation for Sect. 13.2.1 the angle of rotation ψ1 of the cross relative
to shaft 1 is determined as function of ϕ1 . Arbitrarily, ψ1 = 0 is associated
with ϕ1 = 0 . From (13.12) and (13.13) it follows that

13.2 Fenyi’s Joint
Figure 13.4 is the exploded view of a shaft coupling brought to the author’s
attention by Fenyi2. The coupled shafts 1 and 2 are skew. They are mounted
in frame-ﬁxed bearings not shown in the ﬁgure. Let ˆe1
2 and ˆe 2
2
be dual
unit vectors along the shaft axes, and let, furthermore, ˆα = α + εℓbe the
constant dual screw angle displacing ˆe1
2 into the position ˆe 2
2 . The projected
angle α and the length ℓof the common perpendicular of the two shaft
axes are the only parameters of the joint. To each shaft and at right angles
to the shaft two collinear trunnions are rigidly attached. These trunnions
are moving in bearings of the central ring-shaped body. The axes of these
bearings intersect at a right angle at M . In the assembled state the ring
transmits the rotational motion of shaft 1 to shaft 2 . Relative to each pair

Fig. 13.4 Exploded view of Fenyi’s joint
of trunnions the ring executes a screw motion. It is assumed that shaft 1
is in pure rotation relative to the frame (angle of rotation ϕ1 ). In order to
function properly the bearings of shaft 2 must allow shaft 2 to execute a
screw motion composed of a rotation ϕ2 and a translation z . In the special
case α = 0 , the joint is the Oldham coupling shown in Fig. 15.6 . In the
special case ℓ= 0 , the joint is Hooke’s joint shown in Fig. 13.1 , and all
screw displacements are pure rotations.
The following kinematics investigation is based on the principle of trans-
ference. The rotational part of the problem is identical with that of a Hooke’s
joint with parameter α . The principle of transference is applied to Eq.(13.4):
tan ϕ2 tan ϕ1 = −cos α .
(13.22)
The angle α is replaced by
ˆα = α + εℓ, and the angle ϕ2 is replaced by
ˆϕ2 = ϕ2+εz . The angle ϕ1 is not eﬀected because shaft 1 is, by assumption,
in pure rotation. Thus, the dual form of (13.22) is tan ˆϕ2 tan ϕ1 = −cos ˆα .
This is the equation (see (3.31))

tan ϕ2 + ε


tan ϕ1 = −(cos α −εℓsin α) .
(13.23)
The primary part of this equation is Eq.(13.22). The dual part is
(z/ cos2 ϕ2) tan ϕ1 = ℓsin α . Writing
1/ cos2 ϕ2 = 1 + tan2 ϕ2
and using
(13.22) this yields for the translatory displacement of shaft 2 the expression
z = ℓsin α sin ϕ1 cos ϕ1
1 −sin2 α cos2 ϕ1
.
(13.24)
This is an odd, π-periodic function of ϕ1 . Its maxima and minima of equal
absolute value occur when dz/dϕ1 = 0 . This equation leads to cos2 ϕ1 =
1/(1 + cos2 α) , sin2 ϕ1 = cos2 α/(1 + cos2 α) and sin ϕ1 cos ϕ1 = cos α/(1 +
cos2 α) . When this is substituted into (13.24), the maximum range of the
translatory displacement of shaft 2 is found to be

13.2.1 Raccording Axodes of the Central Ring
The central ring is executing a periodic spatial motion without a ﬁxed point.
The periodically moving instantaneous screw axis is the generator of two
closed raccording axodes. In what follows, parameter equations with ϕ1 as
parameter are developed for these axodes. On the frame the basis e1 known
from Fig. 13.1 is ﬁxed. Its origin A is the point where the axis of shaft
1 intersects the ﬁrst axis of the ring. On the ring the basis n with basis
vectors n1, n2, n3 known from Fig. 13.1 is deﬁned. It has its origin at the
point of intersection M of the two ring axes. By writing the vector from A to
M in the form z1n1 the coordinate z1 = z1(ϕ1) is deﬁned. Let u(ϕ1) be the
perpendicular from A onto the instantaneous screw axis (ISA) of the ring,
and let, furthermore, ω(ϕ1) be the angular velocity of the ring relative to
the frame. With a dimensionless parameter λ the vectors from A and from
M to an arbitrary point P(λ) on the ISA are
rAP(ϕ1, λ) = u(ϕ1) + λℓ

rMP(ϕ1, λ) = u(ϕ1) + λℓ

The coordinates of rAP in basis e1 and the coordinates of rMP in basis n
are the desired parameter equations of the ﬁxed axode and of the moving ax-
ode, respectively. With increasing |λ| the equations of the axodes approach
asymptotically those of the herpolhode cone and of the polhode cone, respec-
tively, of the cross-shaped central body in Hooke’s joint (see Figs. 13.2 and
13.3).
The perpendicular u from A onto the ISA is, according to (9.23),
u = ω × vA

(13.27)
with vA being the velocity of the ring-ﬁxed point coinciding with A . This
velocity is vA = ˙z1n1 . Expressions for z1 and for ˙z1 are obtained by trans-
ferring Eq.(13.21) into dual form: tan(ψ1 + εz1) = tan(α + εℓ) sin ϕ1 . Its
dual part is the expression for z1 given below. Diﬀerentiation3 yields ˙z1 .

In Fig. 13.5 the axodes for the parameter value α = 60◦are shown (the
ﬁxed axode dark, the white moving axode in a single position). Each ax-
ode is represented by a net of lines λ = const ( −2 ≤λ ≤2 ) and ϕ1 =

revolution of shaft 1 . For showing the moving axode in a single position
ϕ1 = φ together with the ﬁxed axode the coordinates in the column matrix
on the right-hand side of (13.31) are transformed into basis e1 . The trans-
formation matrix for this purpose is composed of the three columns shown
in (13.3) with ϕ1 = φ . To the resulting coordinates the coordinates of the

13.3 Series-Connected Hooke’s Joints
Equation (13.7) has shown that the output angular velocity of Hooke’s joint is
oscillating if the input angular velocity is constant. For this reason the single
Hooke’s joint has a limited range of engineering applications. The present
section is devoted to the following problem. A chain of shafts 1, . . . , n is
interconnected by Hooke’s joints 1, . . . , n −1 . The shafts labeled 1 and n
are referred to as input shaft and as output shaft, respectively. The entire
system between these two shafts represents a single joint. To be formulated
are necessary and suﬃcient conditions guaranteeing the angular velocity ratio
˙ϕn/ ˙ϕ1 ≡1 .
First, the case n = 3 is investigated, i.e., the case of Hooke’s joints 1 and
2 coupling shafts 1 , 2 and 3 . The parameter α of Fig. 13.1 associated with
Hooke’s joint 1 is now called α1 . The parameter α2 associated with Hooke’s
joint 2 is the constant angle between shafts 2 and 3 . Until further below it is
assumed that shafts 1 , 2 and 3 are coplanar. Since they are coplanar, only
two conﬁgurations are possible in which shafts 1 and 3 intersect at an angle
which is either α1 + α2 or α1 −α2 . The cross of each of the two Hooke’s
joints is rotating relative to shaft 2 about an axis which is perpendicular to
shaft 2 . Let β2 be the constant angle between these two perpendiculars. It
is a third parameter in addition to α1 and α2 . The sign of β2 is speciﬁed
by the deﬁnition that ϕ2 −β2 is the input angle of the second Hooke’s joint.
Applying (13.4) to both joints results in the relationships
tan ϕ2 tan ϕ1 = −cos α1 ,
tan ϕ3 tan(ϕ2 −β2) = −cos α2 .
(13.32)
In what follows, only the special cases β2 = 0 and β2 = π/2 are considered.
With the identity tan ψ = −cot(ψ −π/2) the second Eq.(13.32) is given the
form

398
13 Shaft Couplings
β2 = 0 :
cot(ϕ3 −π
2 ) tan ϕ2 = cos α2 ,
β2 = π
2 :
tan ϕ3 cot ϕ2 = cos α2 .

(13.33)
Combination with the ﬁrst Eq.(13.32) eliminates ϕ2 . The result is the desired
input-output relationship
β2 = 0 :
tan(ϕ3 −π
2 ) tan ϕ1 = −cos α1/ cos α2 ,
β2 = π
2 :
tan ϕ3 tan ϕ1 = −cos α1 cos α2 .

(13.34)
This is written in the form
tan(ϕ3 −γ3) tan ϕ1 = −a3 ,
a3 =
2
cos α1/ cos α2
(β2 = 0)
cos α1 cos α2
(β2 = π
2 )
(13.35)
with either γ3 = π/2 or γ3 = 0 .
The generalization to chains with n −1 Hooke’s joints coupling shafts
1 , . . . , n is straight-forward. Again, the shafts are assumed to be coplanar.
With each new shaft i a new shaft parameter βi−1
(either βi−1 = 0 or
βi−1 = π/2 ) and a new joint parameter αi−1 are introduced and with them
a new equation of the general form (13.33) with indices i and i −1 instead
of 3 and 2 . The angle ϕi−1 is eliminated by combining this equation with
the previous equation of the general form (13.35). The ﬁnal result for the
input-output relationship for a chain of n −1 Hooke’s joints coupling shafts
1 , . . . , n has the form
tan(ϕn −γn) tan ϕ1 = −an
(13.36)
with constants γn and an . The latter is

(13.38)
The desired angular velocity ratio
˙ϕn/ ˙ϕ1 ≡1 is achieved with an = 1 .
This is a condition on the joint parameters α1 , . . . , αn−1 and on the shaft
parameters β2 , . . . , βn−1 .
Example n = 3 : Equation (13.35) shows that a3 = 1 requires β2 = 0
and, in addition, cos α1/ cos α2 = 1 , i.e., |α1| = |α2| . This result was to be
expected. In Figs. 13.6a and b the two possible arrangements with coplanar
shafts 1 , 2 and 3 are shown.

resulting in
˙ϕ3 ≡˙ϕ1
At this point the condition of coplanarity of the three shafts is abandoned.
Obviously, the property ˙ϕ3 ≡˙ϕ1 is preserved if the planar system (for exam-
ple, the one in Fig. 13.6a) is subjected to the following three-step operation:
Step 1: In an arbitrary position shaft 2 is cut thus splitting the entire system
into a left part 1 and a right part 2
Step 2: Part 2 including joint 2 and the bearing of shaft 3 is rotated as one
single rigid body about the axis of shaft 2 through an arbitrary angle ψ
Step 3: In the new position ψ the two parts of shaft 2 are rigidly joined
together.
In the special case ψ = π , the new position is the position shown in Fig.
13.6b . If ψ ̸= π , the axes of shafts 1 and 3 are skew in the new position.
Example n = 4 : Equation (13.37) shows that the condition a4 = 1 is
satisﬁed in each of the following three cases.
Case a: (β2, β3) = ( π
2 , 0)
and
cos α1 cos α2 = cos α3
Case b: (β2, β3) = (0 , 0)
and
cos α2 cos α3 = cos α1
Case c: (β2, β3) = (0 , π
2 )
and
cos α3 cos α1 = cos α2 .
In Fig. 13.7 case (c) is illustrated by a system of coplanar axes with α3 =
α1 = 20◦and
cos α2 = cos2 20◦
(α2 ≈28◦). This example shows that
geometrical symmetry of the coupling of shafts 1 and 4 is not a necessary
condition for the identity of input and output angular velocity.
Example n = 5 : The condition a5 = 1 is satisﬁed by altogether seven dif-
ferent combinations (β2, β3, β4) and by associated conditions on α1 , . . . , α4 .
The details are left to the reader. See also Duditza [4, 7]. In Fig. 13.8 a simple
example with ﬁve coplanar axes is shown. It is the combination of two sys-
tems of the type shown in Fig. 13.6b . The parameters are β2 = β3 = β4 = 0
and α1 = α2 = α3 = α4 = α . Shafts 1 , 3 and 5 have identical angular
velocities ˙ϕ5 ≡˙ϕ3 ≡˙ϕ1 .
In every system with coplanar axes i = 1, . . . , n the property ˙ϕn ≡˙ϕ1 is
preserved if the three-step operation explained for the case n = 3 is applied
analogously, i.e., by cutting an arbitrary intermediate shaft j = 2 , . . . , n −
1 and by a rigid-body rotation of the part located beyond the cut shaft.
This operation may even be performed repeatedly with diﬀerent intermediate
shafts.

13.4 Homokinetic Shaft Couplings
By deﬁnition, the coupling of two shafts is homokinetic if it satisﬁes the
conditions
(A) the axes of the shafts are free to change their relative position and
direction during operation
(B) the angular velocities are identical in every relative position and di-
rection held ﬁxed.
The homokinetic coupling is the mechanism required for positioning and di-
recting the axis of shaft 2 relative to shaft 1 . If both location and direction
of this axis are variable, the mechanism must have the degree of freedom
F = 5 (three coordinates of a single point plus two direction cosines). Cou-
plings of simpler nature, namely, with degree of freedom F = 2 , are required
for shafts the axes of which are permanently intersecting at a ﬁxed point. In
engineering these simpler solutions are fully suﬃcient. Such coupling cannot
be a serial chain because it would have to be a chain of two intersecting revo-
lute joints. However, this is Hooke’s joint which is known to violate condition
(B). This means that homokinetic couplings must be closed kinematic chains.

13.4 Homokinetic Shaft Couplings
401
13.4.1 Couplings With a Spherical Joint
Permanent intersection of the axes of shafts 1 and 2 is most easily achieved
by means of a spherical joint. According to Gr¨ubler’s Eq.(4.4) a simple closed
chain with a spherical joint must have ﬁve additional joint variables in order
to have the degree of freedom F = 2 . Let Σ be the plane which is (i) bisect-
ing the angle between the two shafts and (ii) normal to the plane spanned
by the shafts. Conditions (A) and (B) are both satisﬁed if in every relative
position of the shafts the closed chain is both structurally and dimensionally
symmetric with respect to Σ . If only revolute joints R , prismatic joints P
and combinations of these two (cylindrical joints C , spherical joints S and
planar joints E ) are used, altogether eight ﬁve-variable chains can be formed
which are structurally symmetric with respect to a central joint. These are
the chains
RRRRR , RRPRR , PRRRP , RPRPR , RSR , PSP , CRC
and RER . The central joint is indicated by a boldface letter. If the central
joint is a revolute R , its axis must lie in Σ . If it is a prismatic joint P , it
must be perpendicular to Σ . If it is a planar joint E , the plane E must be
normal to Σ . Every one of the eight mechanisms has been used in patented
shaft couplings. Detailed documentations see in Kutzbach [10, 11], Duditza
[5] and Seherr-Thoss/Schmelz/Aucktor [17]. In most engineering realizations
adjacent joint axes are either parallel or at right angles. This is not a nec-
essary condition. The only necessary condition, in addition to symmetry, is
that the shafts must have the freedom to rotate full cycle.
A homokinetic coupling based on the chain RSR was shown in Fig. 4.11.
A coupling based on the chain CRC is shown schematically in Fig. 13.9a .
It was known to Koenigs [9] already. The patented engineering realization is
known as Hebson coupling. A single chain CRC suﬃces. The second chain
CRC is added in order to diminish dynamical unbalance (total balance is
achieved when shafts 1 and 2 are collinear). In a Hebson coupling a larger
number of chains is evenly distributed around the cylinders. The joints R in
these chains may be replaced by spherical joints since the additional degrees
of freedom thus introduced are passive. With this coupling inclination angles
up to 90◦are possible.
The so-called Tracta coupling shown schematically in Fig. 13.9b is based
on the chain RER . The chain is encapsulated in two concentric spherical
shells which together represent the spherical joint connecting shafts 1 and
2 . The axes of both revolutes R are in the plane E . Each revolute axis
intersects one shaft axis orthogonally. Rotations in these revolutes keep plane
E normal to plane Σ independent of the angular position ϕ of the shafts. In
the ﬁgure plane E is shown in the positions ϕ = 0, π and ϕ = ±π/2 . The
Tracta coupling is widely used in the automotive ﬁeld because of the following
properties: Inclination angles up to 50◦; compact form; simple assembly; no
loss of lubrication; large wear-resistant contact surfaces.

402
13 Shaft Couplings
Fig. 13.9 Hebson coupling (a) and Tracta coupling (b)
In the homokinetic coupling shown in Fig. 13.10 two revolutes on either
side of plane Σ constitute the central cross of a Hooke’s joint each connecting
one shaft to the intermediate body 3 . For this reason the coupling is referred
to as bicardanic coupling. Body 3 is a cylinder with the axis 01-02 inside
of which centrally placed rings 4 provide a planar joint in plane Σ for the
smaller circular disc 5 . Normal to this disc another hollow cylinder 6 is
rigidly connected. This cylinder is guide for two spherical bodies ﬁxed at the
ends of shafts 1 and 2 at equal distances from 01 and from 02 , respectively.
The entire mechanism connecting shafts 1 and 2 is homokinetic. The point
of intersection of the shafts is not ﬁxed on the shafts, but constrained to lie
in Σ . This type of coupling ﬁnds applications in low-speed vehicles such as
agricultural machines. For high-speed vehicles it is not suitable because the
nonuniform motion of the coupling mechanism is a source of vibrations.
Duditza [4, 5] and Kutzbach [10] describe various other forms of bicardanic
homokinetic couplings.

13.4.2 Couplings With Three Parallel Serial Chains
In the shaft couplings described in the previous section permanent symmetry
of a ﬁve-d.o.f. chain with respect to plane Σ is achieved by a central spher-
ical joint S closing the chain. The same constraints that are exerted by the
spherical joint S can be exerted by placing two additional ﬁve-d.o.f. chains
parallel to the ﬁrst one. For reasons of dynamic balancing and of simplicity
of design three identical chains are placed at intervals of 120◦. The so-called
Clemens coupling shown schematically in Fig. 13.11 is derived from Fig. 4.11.
The serial chain R1S2R2 of this coupling is placed three times in parallel. On
each shaft the three revolute axes ﬁxed on the shaft are placed 120◦apart.
The three spherical joints are permanently in the bisecting plane Σ .
Fig. 13.11 Clemens coupling with three identical parallel chains RSR
The shafts 1 and 2 in Fig. 13.12 are connected to the sides of the rigid
isosceles triangle (01,C,02) of base length 2ℓand apex angle 2β by two pairs
of revolutes R1 , R2 and R3 , R4 . At 01 the axis of R1 intersects both shaft
1 and R2 orthogonally, and at 02 the axis of R4 intersects both shaft 2 and
R3 orthogonally. In the ﬁgure the symmetrical position is shown in which the
shafts intersect in the bisecting plane Σ normal to 0102 and passing through
C . When the shafts are held ﬁxed in this position, rotation of the triangle
about the line 0102 causes both shafts to rotate through identical angles ϕ .
The chain R1R2R3R4 is one out of three identical chains sharing the line
0102 and the plane Σ . The entire shaft coupling thus described is known as
Unitru coupling. It is homokinetic because it allows changing the direction
of shaft 2 while maintaining symmetry with respect to Σ .
In what follows, it is shown under which condition on the design parameter
β , for a given inclination angle α of the shafts, the triangle and the shafts
are free to rotate full cycle. Deﬁnition: The angle of rotation ϕ of the shafts
and the angle of rotation ψ of the triangle are zero when the shafts as well as
the triangle are in the plane of the drawing (the frame-ﬁxed x, y-plane). In
this position the revolutes R1 and R4 are parallel to the z-axis. The point
P on the axis of R4 at the distance ℓfrom 02 is an auxiliary point. With

This requires cos β ≥cos γ or β ≤γ ≤π/2 . The inclination angle between

2β = 90◦inclination angles α up to 90◦are possible.
13.4.3 Ball-in-Track Joints
The symmetrical ﬁve-d.o.f. chains essential for all previously described shaft
couplings have the disadvantage of being structurally complex. Much simpler
realizations are shown in Figs. 13.13a and b . The shafts in Fig. 13.13a are

of arbitrary shape drawn in thick lines are in the plane of the drawing. Imag-
ine these curves to be rigid and rigidly attached to the shafts. Due to the
symmetry the point of contact is in the bisecting plane Σ . Both symmetry
with respect to and contact in the bisecting plane are maintained when the
inclination angle α between the shafts is changed and also, when both shafts
are rotated through arbitrary identical angles into positions in which the two
curves are no longer coplanar. The sliding point contact of two curves con-
stitutes a ﬁve-d.o.f. joint. The symmetrical closed chain formed by this joint
in parallel to the spherical joint represents a homokinetic coupling of shafts
1 and 2 . However, since point contact is transmitting force from one shaft
to the other in only one sense of direction of rotation, a second pair of rigid
curves for the opposite sense of direction is necessary. This is the pair drawn
in dashed lines in the same plane. Repeating the arguments at the beginning
of the previous section the shaft coupling continues to be homokinetic if the
central spherical joint is replaced by two additional sets of curves in planes
placed at intervals of 120◦. Engineering realizations see in Kutzbach [10].
The contacting curves are edges of bodies.
Single-point contact of curves is unsatisfactory. A much better design is the
so-called ball-in-track joint shown in Fig. 13.13b . The role of the contact point
is played by the center C of a spherical ball of arbitrary diameter. Motion
of C relative to the shafts along prescribed symmetric curves is realized by
appropriately curved shallow grooves referred to as tracks in which the ball is
constrained to move. Each track is rigidly attached to one of the shafts. The
element composed of a ball enclosed between two crossing tracks is called
ball-in-track joint. It is a ﬁve-d.o.f. joint. Homokinetic shaft couplings with
ball-in-track joints have many advantages such as small size, small dynamic
unbalance and distribution of contact forces among a large number of balls.
However, there are disadvantages, too. Problems arise from the fact that the
motion of balls in crossing tracks is not rolling, but sliding and boring with
the possibility of jamming due to friction. This aspect of kinematics see in
Phillips/Winter [14].
The so-called Devos coupling shown schematically in Fig. 13.14 has two
balls-in-tracks in parallel to a spherical joint S . The tracks are symmetrically
located cylinders. In order to keep the centers of the balls in the bisecting
plane Σ the balls are also constrained to move along the cylindrical pin
3 which is rigidly attached to the sphere of the joint S . This implies that
the sphere of the joint S cannot be rigidly connected to any of the two
shafts. Details of design not shown in the ﬁgure allow the shaft coupling to
be assembled under prestress in such a way that its elements are ﬁrmly held
together.
Figure 13.15 shows the essential elements of a shaft coupling without cen-
tral spherical joint and with balls in torus-shaped tracks in the particular
position when the circular lines of contact between ball and both tori (indi-

cated by the dashed circles) are in the plane of the drawing4. Let this be the
position ϕ = 0 of the shafts. The radii r1 and r2 of these circles satisfy the
condition r2 −r1 = 2ρ where ρ is the radius of the balls. This has the eﬀect
that the trajectory of the center C of the ball relative to shaft 1 is the circle
of radius r = r1 + ρ about 01 and that the trajectory of C relative to shaft
2 is the circle of the same radius r about 02 . In the position ϕ = 0 these
circles are symmetric with respect to and intersecting in the bisecting plane
Σ . The pair of balls shown in the ﬁgure is one out of three or more pairs
moving in tracks which are placed at equal angular intervals. After what has
been said in the context of Figs. 13.13a,b the symmetry properties prove that
the shaft coupling is homokinetic. Not only in the position ϕ = 0 , but in
arbitrary positions ϕ ̸= 0 point C is in the plane Σ at equal distances r
from 01 and from 02 . Hence the trajectory of C relative to the frame is a
circle in Σ with the center at the midpoint between 01 and 02 . The radius
of this circle depends on α .
The position of C in the tracks is described by the angle β = ∢(001C) .
It is a function ϕ . The extremal values β1 and β2 are obtained from the
condition that the x, y-coordinates of C satisfy the equation x = y tan α/2 .
This is the set of equations
h −r cos β1,2 = ±r sin β1,2 tan α

13.4.4 Tripod Joint
The tripod joint shown in Fig. 13.16 is another ball-in-track coupling. Its
kinematics was investigated by Roethlisberger/Aldrich [16], Duditza [5], Du-
ditza/Diaconescu [6], Durum [8], Orain [12, 13] and Akbil/Lee [1, 2]. In what
follows, an elementary analysis is presented. Imagine that in the ﬁxed carte-
sian x1, y1, z1-system of Fig. 13.17 the shaft labeled 1 is rotating about the
z1-axis. The rotation angle is ϕ . A point Q ﬁxed on the shaft at radius
a is moving on a circle. In the position ϕ of the shaft Q has the coordi-
nates x1(ϕ) = a cos ϕ , y1(ϕ) = a sin ϕ . The circle and this point Q(ϕ) are

tions of the angle α

projected parallel to the z1-axis onto the x, y-plane of another ﬁxed x, y, z-
system which is inclined against the x1, y1, z1-system by an angle α about
the x1-axis. The projection of the circle is the ellipse with semi-axes a and
b = a/ cos α . Point Q(ϕ) is projected into the point P(ϕ) with coordinates
x(ϕ) = a cos ϕ ,
y(ϕ) = b sin ϕ .
(13.44)
Let, in the same x, y-plane, x0(ϕ) and y0(ϕ) be the coordinates of another
point P0(ϕ) , i.e., of another curve. To be determined are all curves P0(ϕ)
having the property that the angle between the line P0(ϕ)P(ϕ) and the
x-axis is identical with ϕ . This is the condition
b sin ϕ −y0(ϕ)
a cos ϕ −x0(ϕ) ≡tan ϕ .
(13.45)
The ansatz
x0(ϕ) = ξ(ϕ) cos ϕ ,
y0(ϕ) = η(ϕ) sin ϕ
(13.46)
results in the condition

This condition is satisﬁed by inﬁnitely many functions, for example, by the
family of functions
ξ(ϕ) = −r(cos2 ϕ + c1) , η(ϕ) = r(sin2 ϕ + c2) with
constants r , c1 , c2 satisfying the constraint equation r(1+c1 +c2) = b−a .
In the special case c1 = c2 = −3/4 , r = −2(b −a) , Eqs.(13.46) are

When shaft 1 is rotating with angular velocity
˙ϕ , P0(ϕ) is moving with
angular velocity 3 ˙ϕ on the circle with radius ϱ about 0 , and the line
P0(ϕ)P(ϕ) is rotating with angular velocity
˙ϕ . Examples:
ϱ ≈0.08a for
α = 30◦, ϱ ≈0.21a for α = 45◦, ϱ = 0.5a for α = 60◦. The Taylor formula
is ϱ/a ≈α2/4 .
Imagine that on the circle of radius a ﬁxed on shaft 1 not a single point
Q , but three points Q1 , Q2 , Q3 are marked 120◦apart. The projections
of these points are three points Pi(ϕ) (i = 1, 2, 3) on the ellipse. For each
one of these points (13.48) yields the same point P0(ϕ) since 3 · 120◦= 2π .
From this it follows that the rays P0(ϕ)Pi(ϕ) (i = 1, 2, 3) emanating from
P0(ϕ) form a rigid 120◦-star with the center at P0 . This star is rotating with
angular velocity
˙ϕ while its center P0 is moving on the circle of radius ϱ
with angular velocity 3 ˙ϕ . The lines Qi(ϕ)Pi(ϕ) (i = 1, 2, 3) are parallel to
the axis of shaft 1 and ﬁxed on shaft 1 . In the tripod joint shown in Fig.
13.16 the star, the three lines Qi(ϕ)Pi(ϕ) (i = 1, 2, 3) and the permanent
intersection of each ray with the associated line at Pi are materially realized.
Each ray is guide for a ball which is free to move along the ray. The associated
line ﬁxed on shaft 1 is the axis of a cylinder in which the ball is also free to
move. Orthogonal to the star and through its center P0 a shaft 2 is rigidly
attached to the star. The star and this shaft together constitute the tripod
giving the joint its name. The tripod has the same angular velocity ˙ϕ shaft
1 has independent of the direction of shaft 2 relative to shaft 1 . It has the
additional degree of freedom of translation along the axis of shaft 1 . In spite
of these properties the tripod joint is not homokinetic because shaft 2 cannot
be held ﬁxed due to its motion on a cylinder of radius ϱ . By means of an
Oldham coupling the motion of shaft 2 can be transmitted to a shaft 3 the
axis of which is the z-axis. This combination tripod joint – Oldham coupling
is a homokinetic coupling of shafts 1 and 3 .
If a point ﬁxed on shaft 2 at a distance ℓ≫a from P0 is coupled to the z-
axis by a spherical joint S , the kinematics of the tripod is slightly changed.
An analysis made by Duditza and Diaconescu [5, 6] leads to the following
ﬁrst-order approximation. Three times per revolution of shaft 1 the axis of
shaft 2 is moving on a circular cone with the apex at S and with the semi-

Displacements in a Plane
Subject of this chapter are relationships between positions of a plane Σ in
a reference plane Σ0 . Motions leading from one position to another are not
considered. Displacements in a plane are translation, rotation, reﬂection and
resultants of these three. All of them are special cases of the spatial displace-
ments investigated in Chaps. 1 and 3 . Consequently, theorems governing the
latter remain valid, normally in simpliﬁed form. In addition, special theorems
exist which are valid for planar displacements only.

14.1 Complex Numbers in Planar Kinematics
In planar kinematics vector equations can be replaced by equations written in
terms of complex numbers. In what follows, these two formulations are com-
pared. The complex plane is the e1, e2-plane of a cartesian e1, e2, e3-system
with origin 0 . The real axis is the e1-axis. Let a and b be the cartesian
coordinates of a point P in the plane (Fig. 14.1). The position vector of this
point is denoted r = ae1 + be2 . The complex number representing the point
is denoted z = a + i b . It can be interpreted as directed object pointing from
0 to P . In contrast to r it is not a vector. The conjugate of z is deﬁned
to be z = a −i b . It is easy to verify the following correspondences between
vectors and complex numbers:
r2 = a2 + b2 ,
zz = a2 + b2 ,
(14.1)
r1 + r2 = (a1 + a2)e1 + (b1 + b2)e2 ,
z1 + z2 = (a1 + a2) + i (b1 + b2) ,
(14.2)
r1 · r2 = a1a2 + b1b2 ,
1
2 (z1z2 + z1z2) = a1a2 + b1b2 ,
(14.3)
r1 × r2 = (a1b2 −a2b1)e3 ,
1
2 (z1z2 −z1z2) = i (a1b2 −a2b1) . (14.4)

Fig. 14.1 Complex number
From the last two correspondences the following statements are deduced.
z1 and z2 are mutually orthogonal if z1z2 = −z1z2
z1 and z2 are collinear (equal or opposite direction) if z1z2 = z1z2 .
 
(14.5)
These conditions can also be formulated as follows:
z1 and z2 are mutually orthogonal if
Re(z1z2) = 0
z1 and z2 are collinear (equal or opposite direction) if
Im(z1z2) = 0 .
 
(14.6)
In conclusion it can be said that all vector algebraic operations can be ex-
pressed in terms of complex numbers. Complex numbers have additional
advantages which make them more powerful than vectors. For one thing,
division is possible:
z1
z2
= z1z2
z2z2
=
z1z2
a2
2 + b2
2
.
(14.7)
The most important advantage is that a complex number z = a + i b can be
expressed in exponential form as z = |z|eiϕ where |z| =
√
a2 + b2 and ϕ
are polar coordinates (see Fig. 14.1). The angle is also referred to as argument
of z : ϕ = Arg z . The conversion from one form to the other is achieved by
Euler’s formula for a complex number of absolute value 1 :
ei ϕ = cos ϕ + i sin ϕ .
(14.8)
The exponential form is used for multiplication and for division:
z1z2 = |z1||z2|ei (ϕ1+ϕ2) .
(14.9)
This formula shows that multiplication has the eﬀect of stretch-rotation. The
absolute values are multiplied, and the angles are summed. The conjugate of
z = |z|ei ϕ is z = |z|e−i ϕ . From this it follows that z/z = ei 2ϕ and hence
ϕ = 1
2i ln z
z .

Example 1: In Fig. 14.2 the vector rB is uniquely determined by the coor-
dinates x = 4 , y = 3 of the vector rA , by the angle α and by the absolute
value

vector algebra is cumbersome. In terms of the complex numbers rA and rB
the solution is much simpler:
rB = 7

Example 3: z(t) = r(t)ei ϕ(t) with real functions r(t) ≥0 and ϕ(t) is
the time-dependent complex number representing a point in planar motion
along a trajectory in the complex plane. The quantities r(t) and ϕ(t) are
polar coordinates. The ﬁrst and the second time derivatives yield for the
velocity and for the acceleration the expressions v(t) = ˙z = ( ˙r + i ˙ϕr)ei ϕ(t)
and a(t) = ¨z = [¨r −˙ϕ2r + i ( ¨ϕr + 2 ˙ϕ ˙r)]ei ϕ(t) , respectively. The development
of the corresponding vector equations is more complicated. These equations
read v(t) = ˙rer + ˙ϕret and a(t) = (¨r −˙ϕ2r)er + ( ¨ϕr + 2 ˙ϕ ˙r)et with unit

14.1.1 Curvature of a Plane Curve
Let r(t) be the complex representation of a plane curve. The real parameter
t is time if r(t) is the trajectory of a moving point. What follows, is valid,
however, also for curves which have nothing to do with motion such as geo-
metrical ornaments. In such cases t does not represent time. The derivative
with respect to t is denoted r′ = dr/dt .
The chord r(t + Δt) −r(t) divided by Δt converges in the limit Δt →0
towards the complex number r′ having the direction of the tangent. Let n(t)
be the normal to the curve at the point r(t) . It has the direction of r′i . With
a real parameter λ this normal has the complex form
ζ = r + λr′i .
(14.13)
From this equation and from the conjugate complex equation
¯ζ = ¯r −λ¯r′i
the parameter λ is eliminated. This produces for the normal n(t) of the
curve the parameter-free representation
(ζ −r)¯r′ + (¯ζ −¯r)r′ = 0 .
(14.14)
In Fig. 14.3 the normals n(t) and n(t+Δt) are shown. In the limit Δt →0
their point of intersection converges toward the center of curvature M of the
curve for the point r(t) . Hence M is at the intersection of n and n′ . The
equation of n′ is obtained by diﬀerentiating (14.14):
(ζ −r)¯r′′ + (¯ζ −¯r)r′′ = 2r′¯r′ .
(14.15)
Let ζM be the complex number pointing to the center of curvature. It is
obtained by multiplying (14.14) by r′′ , (14.15) by r′ and by taking the
diﬀerence:
ζM = r + 2r′
r′¯r′
r′¯r′′ −¯r′r′′ .
(14.16)
The absolute value of the second term represents the radius of the circle of
curvature of the curve at the point r(t) . Its inverse is the curvature κ . The
curvature is (note the factor i in (14.13) and the equation |r′| = (r′r′)1/2 )
κ = 1
2i
¯r′r′′ −r′¯r′′
(r′¯r′)3/2
.
(14.17)
The same expression can also be found as follows. According to (14.10) the
angle Arg(r′) of the tangent r′ against the real axis is
Arg(r′) = 1
2i ln r′
r′ .

A point of stationary curvature of a curve is called vertex. An ellipse, for
example, has four vertices. Every point of a circle is a vertex. The vertex
condition dκ/dt = 0 is the equation
2r′r′(r′r′′′ −r′r′′′) −3(r′r′′ −r′r′′)(r′r′′ + r′r′′) = 0 .

14.2 Elementary Displacements
The plane Σ positions of which are investigated is represented by a triangle
ﬁxed in Σ . In Fig. 14.4 this triangle is shown in three positions (A1,A2,A3) ,
(A′
1,A′
2,A′
3) and (A′′
1,A′′
2,A′′
3) in the reference plane Σ0 . Every position can
be produced from every other position by a displacement. Arrows indicate
the sense of the triangles (clockwise or counterclockwise). The sense of the
triangle (A′
1,A′
2,A′
3) is equal to that of the triangle (A1,A2,A3) , whereas
the sense of the triangle (A′′
1,A′′
2,A′′
3) is opposite. This shows that there are
displacements preserving the sense and others reversing the sense.
We begin by deﬁning three elementary displacements called translation,
rotation and reﬂection. During a translation, abbreviated T , every point
experiences the same translatory displacement t . A rotation, abbreviated C ,
is carried out about a ﬁxed point called pole P through an angle ϕ (positive

image the line g being the mirror. The triangle (A1,A2,A3) in Fig. 14.5 is
used for demonstrating a translatory displacement t , rotation about a pole P
and reﬂection in a line g . Translation and rotation are both sense-preserving
displacements. From Sect. 1.16 it is known that reﬂection is a sense-reversing
displacement.
The three elementary displacements are formulated analytically as follows.
The reference plane Σ0 is interpreted as complex plane. Let z be the complex
number representing an arbitrary point of Σ prior to the displacement, and
let z′ be the complex number representing the same point in its position
after the displacement. The equivalent vectors are z and z′ (so, the symbol
′ does not indicate diﬀerentiation). Relationships between z′ and z for the
three elementary displacements are deduced from Figs. 14.6a,b,c .
Translation T : Let t be the complex number representing the translatory
displacement as is shown in Fig. 14.6a . Then
z′ = z + t .
(14.23)
The equivalent vector equation is
z′ = z + t .
(14.24)
The inverse of the translation t is the translation −t .
Rotation C : Let p be the complex number locating the pole P as is shown
in Fig. 14.6b . Then z′ −p = ei ϕ(z −p) and, consequently,
z′ = p + w(z −p)
with
w = ei ϕ = cos ϕ + i sin ϕ .
(14.25)
The trivial case ϕ = 0 is characterized by w = 1 and the case ϕ = π by
w = −1 . The general expression for w yields

The inverse of the rotation with pole P and with rotation angle ϕ is the
rotation about the same pole P with the rotation angle −ϕ .
Reﬂection S : As is shown in Fig. 14.6c the reﬂecting line is represented in
the form a+λb with complex numbers a and b and with the real parameter
λ . Proposition: The desired relationship between z′ and z is
z′ = a + b
b (z −a) .
(14.28)
Proof: First, the reﬂecting line a + λb is mapped onto the real axis by the
translation −a followed by the rotation associated with multiplication by b .
Through these operations the points z and z′ are mapped into the points
b(z −a) and
b(z′ −a) , respectively. These new points are reﬂections of
each other in the real axis. From this it follows that b(z′ −a) is the complex
conjugate of b(z −a) . This establishes the equation
b(z′ −a) = b(z −
a) . Resolution for z′ produces (14.28). End of proof. The equivalent vector
equation is Eq.(1.276):
z′ = (I −2mm) · z + 2r0
(14.29)
with the unit vector m normal to the reﬂecting line (sense of direction arbi-
trary) and with the perpendicular r0 from the origin onto the reﬂecting line.
The inverse of the reﬂection in a line is this reﬂection itself. Thus, reﬂections
are involutoric.

14.3 Resultant Displacements. Commutativity
Conditions
Resultants of two displacements are written as products, for example T2T1
as resultant of a translation T1 followed by another translation T2 and
TC as resultant of a rotation C followed by a translation T . Altogether
nine resultants have to be investigated, namely,
T2T1 ,
C2C1 ,
S2S1 ,
TS , ST , SC , C S , TC , C T . From the fact that S is the only sense-
reversing elementary displacement it follows that TS , ST , SC and C S are
sense-reversing whereas
T2T1 ,
C2C1 ,
S2S1 , TC and C T are sense-
preserving. The investigation to come reveals, among other things, condi-
tions for products to be commutative, for example conditions for the equality
TS = ST .
The resultant T2T1 : The equivalent Eqs.(14.23) and (14.24) make the state-
ment
z′ = z + t1 + t2 ,
z′ = z + t1 + t2 .
(14.30)
The resultant is a translation which is calculated by the parallelogram rule.
The resultant is unconditionally commutative:
T2T1 = T1T2 . Moreover,
translations form a group. Indeed, the resultant is itself a translation; the as-
sociative law is valid; the unit element exists, namely, the translation t = 0 ,
and the inverse element exists, namely, the translation −t .
The resultant S2S1 : For reﬂections the vector formulation (14.29) is more
convenient than the complex formulation (14.28). In Sect. 1.16 the same
formulation was used for reﬂections in an arbitrarily oriented plane. In the
present planar case, reﬂecting planes are orthogonal to the plane Σ0 . Their
intersections with Σ0 are the reﬂecting lines. Theorems 1.8 and 1.7 on the
resultant S2S1 remain valid in the following simpliﬁed forms.
Theorem 14.1. The resultant of two successive reﬂections in nonparallel
lines with unit normal vectors m1 (ﬁrst reﬂection) and m2 enclosing the
angle 0 < ϕ < π is a rotation through the angle 2ϕ about the axis
m1 × m2/|m1 × m2| normal to Σ0 through the point P of intersection
of the two reﬂecting lines. The resultant rotation does not change when the
two lines are rotated about their point of intersection with the angle ϕ kept
constant. The sense of rotation is reversed when the order of reﬂections is
changed. In the special case of mutually perpendicular lines ( ϕ = π/2 , 180◦-
rotation), the ﬁnal position is independent of the order of reﬂections.
Theorem 14.2. The resultant displacement z′ −z caused by two successive
reﬂections in parallel lines with normal vectors r01 = r01m (ﬁrst reﬂection)
and r02 = r02m is the translation 2(r02 −r01) by twice the distance of the
two lines in the direction normal to the lines. The translation changes sign
when the order of reﬂections is changed.

Fig. 14.7 Generation of z′ from z by two successive reﬂections in lines g1 (ﬁrst reﬂec-
tion) and g2 and the resulting rotation about the pole P
The two successive reﬂections and the rotation about P referred to in Theo-
rem 14.1 are shown in Fig. 14.7 . According to the last sentence in this theorem
two successive reﬂections are commutative if and only if the reﬂecting lines
g1 and g2 are orthogonal.
The resultants TS and ST : Let e be the unit vector in the direction of the
reﬂecting line (sense of direction arbitrary). The translation is
t = mm · t + ee · t
( m · m = e · e = 1 , m · e = 0 ) .
(14.31)
For the two resultant displacements the relationships between the ﬁnal posi-
tion z′ and the initial position z are according to (14.29)
TS :
z′ = (I −2mm) · z + 2r0 + t ,
ST :
z′ = (I −2mm) · (z + t) + 2r0 .

(14.32)
With (14.31) these relationships become
TS :
z′ = (I −2mm) · z + 2(r0 + 1
2 mm · t) + ee · t ,
ST :
z′ = (I −2mm) · z + 2(r0 −1
2 mm · t) + ee · t .

(14.33)
Let g denote the reﬂecting line speciﬁed by the perpendicular r0 . The vectors
(r0 + 1
2 mm · t) and (r0 −1
2 mm · t) have both the direction of r0 . They
are the perpendiculars from the origin onto two lines parallel to and at equal
distances from g . Comparison with the ﬁrst Eq.(14.32) for the resultant TS
shows that each equation expresses the resultant of a reﬂection about a line
parallel to g followed by the translation ee · t along g .
Deﬁnition: The special resultant displacement TS of a reﬂection followed
by a translation along the reﬂecting line is called glide reﬂection. The results
obtained are summarized as follows. The resultants TS and ST are diﬀerent
glide reﬂections. The diﬀerence is that their reﬂecting lines are parallel to
and at equal distances from g . Their translatory displacements along the
reﬂecting lines are equal. Identity of the two resultants, i.e., commutativity
TS = ST , requires that m · t = 0 .

420
14 Displacements in a Plane
A glide reﬂection is the same independent of whether the reﬂection is car-
ried out before or after the translation. It has the property that the midpoint
(z + z′)/2 of the displacement lies on the reﬂecting line, and that the trans-
lation (positive in the direction of e ) is t = e · (z′ −z) . A glide reﬂection
is a screw displacement with rotation angle π . For this reason the analytical
methods developed in Chap. 3 are applicable. In the theory of planar dis-
placements glide reﬂections are as important as translations and rotations.
Theorem 14.3. Every sense-reversing displacement is either a reﬂection or
a glide reﬂection. Every sense-preserving displacement is either a translation
or a rotation.
Proof: Let zi
(i = 1, 2, 3) be the initial positions of the corner points of
a triangle, and let z′
i
(i = 1, 2, 3) be the ﬁnal positions. First, the case is
considered that the displacement is sense-reversing. In this case, two out of
the three midpoints
(zi + z′
i)/2 , say
(z1 + z′
1)/2 and
(z2 + z′
2)/2 , are
diﬀerent. They deﬁne a line g . It is an elementary task to prove that also
(z3 + z′
3)/2 is located on g . Hint: Consider, ﬁrst, the special triangle the
third corner z3 of which is located on g at the midpoint (z1 + z′
1)/2 . Then
it follows from the rigid-body property that also z′
3 is located on g , and
that, furthermore, the three translations e · (z′
i −zi) (i = 1, 2, 3) are equal.
Next, a triangle with an arbitrarily located corner z3 is considered which is
rigidly connected to the previously considered special triangle. Using, again,
the rigid-body property and elementary geometry it is shown that also in this
case the midpoint (z3 + z′
3)/2 is located on g , and that, furthermore, the
translation e · (z′
3 −z3) is the same as before. If the identical translations
e · (z′
i −zi) (i = 1, 2, 3) are zero, the displacement is a reﬂection in g . This
ends the proof of the ﬁrst part of the theorem.
Next, the case is considered that the displacement is sense-preserving. In
this case, the three midpoints (zi+z′
i)/2 (i = 1, 2, 3) are not collinear, so that
the displacement is not a glide reﬂection. If the three displacements z′
i −zi
(i = 1, 2, 3) are identical, the displacement is a translation by this vector
diﬀerence. Otherwise it is a rotation. In this case, the initial and ﬁnal positions
of two points suﬃce for determining the pole and the angle of the rotation. In
complex formulation these are the quantities zi and z′
i (i = 1, 2). The points
are denoted Ai in the initial position and A′
i in the ﬁnal position. The ﬁrst
Eq.(14.25) applied to both points yields two equations for the unknowns p
and w :
z′
1 = p + w(z1 −p) ,
z′
2 = p + w(z2 −p) .
(14.34)
The solutions are

z2 −z1
,
p =

1 −w z′

w

(i = 1, 2) .
(14.35)
The rigid-body property |z′
2 −z′
1| = |z2 −z1| = has the consequence that
|w| = 1 . Therefore and with (14.27) the solutions determine the angle ϕ

In Fig. 14.8a these results are interpreted geometrically. The expression for
w determines uniquely (except for 2π) the angle ϕ between the dashed lines
A1A2 and A′
1A′
2 . The formulas for p express the fact that the pole P is the
intersection point of the midnormals of A1A′
1 and A2A′
2 . The angle ϕ is the
angle at P in the isosceles triangles (A1,P,A′
1) and (A2,P,A′
2) . The triangle
(P,A1,A2) ﬁxed in Σ is rotated about P into the position (P,A′
1,A′
2) . In
Fig. 14.8b A1A′
1 and A2A′
2 are parallel. In this case, P is the intersection
of the lines A1A2 and A′
1A′
2 . In Fig. 14.8c all four points
A1 , A′
1 , A2 ,
A′
2 are collinear. In this case, ϕ = π , and the pole P is midpoint between
A1 and A′
1 and also midpoint between A2 and A′
2 . End of proof.

The resultants SC and C S : Both resultants are glide reﬂections. For both
resultants the line of reﬂection and the translation along this line are con-
structed geometrically by displacing an isosceles triangle from an initial posi-
tion 1 via an intermediate position 2 into the ﬁnal position 3 . This geomet-
rical approach is simpler than the analytical approach by means of complex
numbers. First, the resultant SC is considered. In Fig. 14.9a the point P
is the pole of the rotation C , and g is the reﬂecting line of the subsequent
reﬂection S . Let ϕ be the angle of the rotation C (positive counterclock-
wise). In the intermediate position 2 following the rotation the triangle has
the apex P , the apex angle ϕ and the base on g . From this position 2

Fig. 14.9 Resultants SC (a) and C S (b) . Pole P and angle ϕ of the rotation C , line
of reﬂection g , line g′ and translation t of the resultant glide reﬂection
the initial position 1 is obtained by the inverse of the rotation C , i.e., by
clockwise rotation through ϕ about P . The ﬁnal position 3 is the result of
reﬂecting position 2 in the line g . In position 1 the corner points of the
triangle are denoted A1 , A2 , A3 as shown. In position 3 these points as-
sume the positions A′
1 , A′
2 , A′
3 . The desired line g′ of the glide reﬂection
is the line passing through the midpoints between Ai and A′
i (i = 1, 2, 3).
Two of these midpoints coincide. The line g′ makes the angle ϕ/2 with g .
It is orthogonal to the lines A1A′
2 and A′
1A′
3 . Hence the distance between
these two lines is the translation of the glide reﬂection along g′ . In terms of
the distance h of P from g this translation t is 2h sin ϕ/2 in the direction
shown by the arrow.
Next, the resultant C S is considered (Fig. 14.9b). The pole P and the
angle ϕ of the rotation C as well as the line g of the reﬂection S are
as before. Positions 1 and 2 of the triangle before and after the reﬂection
and the ﬁnal position 3 after the rotation are as shown. The points initially
located at A1 , A2 , A3 assume the ﬁnal positions A′
1 , A′
2 , A′
3 . The line g′
of the glide reﬂection is determined as before. Again, two of the midpoints
between Ai and A′
i (i = 1, 2, 3) coincide. The line g′ makes the angle ϕ/2
with g , but this time to the other side. As before, the translation t of the
glide reﬂection along g′ is 2h sin ϕ/2 in the direction shown by the arrow.
The resultants SC and C S are commutative if and only if P is located
on g ( h = 0 ) and if, in addition, ϕ = π . Under these conditions the lines g′
of both resultants are the perpendicular to g through P , and the translation
is zero. This means that the resultant is a reﬂection.
The resultants TC and C T : The complex formulations (14.23) and (14.25)
are used. For the two resultants the relationships between the ﬁnal position
z′ and the initial position z are

Both resultants are rotations through the angle ϕ of the rotation C about
diﬀerent poles located by p∗and p∗∗, respectively. For geometrical interpre-
tations see Fig. 14.10 which shows P , ϕ and t , and, prior to displacements,
two lines 0 and 1 which are ﬁxed in Σ . For the resultant TC only line 1 is
of interest. After the rotation C it is in position 2 , and after the subsequent
translation T it is in the ﬁnal position 3 . The same ﬁnal position is the
result of the rotation through ϕ about P∗. The diﬀerence p∗−p has the
components t/2 and (t/2) cot ϕ/2 . The pole P∗is the apex of the isosceles
triangle with base t and with the angle ϕ at P∗. For the resultant CT only
line 0 is of interest. After the translation T it is in position 1 , and after the
subsequent rotation C it is in the ﬁnal position 2 . The same ﬁnal position
is the result of the rotation through ϕ about P∗∗. These results show that
the resultant TC is never commutative.

The resultant C2C1 : At the end of Sect. 3.11 the resultant of two screw dis-
placements with parallel screw axes was derived from dual quaternion equa-
tions. The results were summarized in (3.126) – (3.129) and in Figs. 3.14a,b .
The resultant C2C1 of two rotations about parallel axes is the special case
s1 = s2 = 0 . In what follows, these results are derived from the complex for-
mulations (14.25) – (14.27). Let p1 , ϕ1 be the pole location and the angle,
respectively, of the ﬁrst rotation C1 and p2 , ϕ2 those of the second rota-
tion C2 . Equation (14.23) yields the relationship between the ﬁnal position
z′ and the initial position z in the form

wi = ei ϕi
(i = 1, 2) .
(14.39)
In the special case ϕ2 = −ϕ1 , which means w1w2 = 1 , the resultant is a
translation, because the equation then reads
z′ = z + t
with
t = (1 −w2)(p2 −p1) = (1 −cos ϕ1 + i sin ϕ1)(p2 −p1) .
(14.40)
This is, with a diﬀerent notation, the special case s1 = s2 = 0 of (3.129).
The translation t is the complex number equivalent to the vector −→
AC in Fig.
3.14b .
In the general case ϕ2 ̸= −ϕ1 , the resultant C2C1 is a rotation. Equation
(14.39) has the form
z′ = p + w1w2(z −p)
with
p = p1 + (p2 −p1) 1 −w2
1 −w1w2
.
(14.41)
The factor w2w1 shows that the angle of the resultant rotation is
ϕres = ϕ1 + ϕ2 .

Except for diﬀerences of notation, the last two equations are identical with
(3.126) and (3.128). The geometrical interpretation was given in Fig. 3.14a .
The poles identiﬁed by p1 , p2 and p deﬁne a triangle (P1,P2,P3) with inter-
nal angles ϕ1/2 and ϕ2/2 at P1 and P2 , respectively, and with the external
angle ϕres/2 at P3 .
Equations (14.39) and (14.43) show that the resultant displacement C2C1
is commutative only in the case when the poles P1 and P2 coincide. Table
14.1 summarizes the commutativity conditions found for the various resultant
displacements. The resultant T2T1 is the only resultant which is uncondi-
tionally commutative, and reﬂection is the only displacement which can be
commutative in the product with all three elementary displacements.

14.4 Relationships Between Three Positions
With a new notation this section continues the investigation of the pole tri-
angle deﬁned by (14.42) and (14.43). The pole and the angle of a rotation
from a position i into a position j are denoted Pij and ϕij , respectively.
The pole and the angle of the inverse rotation from position j into position
i are
Pji =Pij ,
ϕji = −ϕij .
(14.44)
The ﬁrst rotation about the pole P12 through the angle ϕ12 carries the
plane Σ from a position 1 into a position 2 , and the second rotation about
the pole P23 through the angle ϕ23 into a position 3 . The resultant of the
two rotations is the rotation through the angle ϕ13 = ϕ12 + ϕ23 or, what is
the same, through ϕ13 = 2π + ϕ12 + ϕ23 , about P13. The inverse rotation
through the angle ϕ31 = −ϕ13 about the same pole carries Σ back into its
initial position. Hence with (14.44)
1
2(ϕ12 + ϕ23 + ϕ31) = π .
(14.45)
According to this equation ϕ12/2 , ϕ23/2 and ϕ31/2 are the internal angles
of the pole triangle (P12,P23,P31) (see Fig. 14.11). Every side of the triangle
is labeled by the index common to the two poles on this side. Since rotation
angles diﬀering by 2π are considered as equal, the angle ϕij/2 is the internal
and also the external angle leading from side i to side j . The results are
summarized in
Theorem 14.4. Three consecutive rotations about the poles of a pole triangle
through angles which are twice the internal or external angles of the triangle
carry the plane via two intermediate positions back into its initial position.
This theorem represents a special case of Theorem 1.5 on three rotations
about non-coplanar axes intersecting at a single point (see the spherical tri-
angle in Fig. 1.7). If the intersection point moves to inﬁnity, the spherical
triangle degenerates to the planar pole triangle.
Let Q be an arbitrary point ﬁxed in Σ and let Q1 , Q2 and Q3 be the
points in the reference plane Σ0 where Q is located in the positions 1 , 2
and 3 of Σ . These points are called homologous points of Q . At every pole
the two sides of the triangle and the enclosed semi-rotation angle create the
situation shown in Fig. 14.7 . Every two of the points Q1 , Q2 and Q3 are car-
ried into each other by a sequence of two reﬂections in sides of the triangle.
The altogether six reﬂections are sharing one and the same reﬂection point
Q′ . In Fig. 14.11 this reﬂection point is shown in the triangle (Q1,Q2,Q3).
The circumcircle of this triangle and its center Q0 are shown as well. The
homologous points Q1 , Q2 , Q3 are now simply called circle points. In what
follows, relationships between circle points, poles and the points Q′ and Q0

and center Q0
Fig. 14.12 Reﬂections of poles, orthocenter S and circumcircle
are developed, ﬁrst by geometrical and then by analytical methods. In Sect.
17.14 these relationships are used for the design of mechanisms leading a
plane through prescribed positions. As a preparatory step some new points
and circles are deﬁned in the pole triangle (P12,P23,P31) (see Fig. 14.12). The
reﬂection of Pij in the opposite side of the triangle is called the reﬂected pole
Pk
ij (i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 diﬀerent). Every reﬂected pole lies on the perpendicular
from the pole onto the opposite side of the pole triangle. The point of con-
currency of these perpendiculars (the orthocenter of the triangle) is denoted
S . The reﬂection of S in the triangle side PijPjk (twice the index j ) is
denoted Sj (j = 1, 2, 3). Proposition: The three points Sj (j = 1, 2, 3) are

14.4 Relationships Between Three Positions
427
located on the circumcircle of the pole triangle. Proof: The altitudes of the
pole triangle create pairs of similar right-angled triangles so that angles γ1 ,
γ2 and γ3 appear twice each as shown. The angles subtended by the line
segment PjkPki are γi + γj at Pij and 180◦−(γi + γj) at Sk . From this it
follows that both points are located on the circle. End of proof. Consequently,
the three reﬂections of the circumcircle in the sides of the triangle (dashed
lines) intersect at S .
Next, relationships are formulated between the center Q0 , the reﬂection
point Q′ , the circle points Q1 , Q2 , Q3 and the poles. The point Q0 is the
intersection point of the midperpendiculars of the triangle (Q1,Q2,Q3), and
every midperpendicular passes through one pole. The midperpendiculars are
shown in Fig. 14.13 . As an example, consider the perpendicular bisector
passing through P12 . At P12 the angles satisfy the equation ∢(P31P12P23) =
ϕ12/2 as well as the equation ∢(Q1P12Q0) = 1
2∢(Q1P12Q2) = ϕ12/2 . Since
the angles ∢(Q1P12P31) and ∢(P31P12Q′) are equal, they are also equal to
the angle ∢(Q0P12P23) . In Fig. 14.13 these angles are denoted β12 . By the
same arguments angles β23 and β13 appear twice each at the other poles
of the pole triangle. As is shown in the ﬁgure each angle is measured from
two sides of the triangle with opposite signs. Through these relationships
the point Q′ is determined if Q0 is given and vice versa. If Q0 (if Q′ ) is
not located in a pole, Q′ (or Q0) is uniquely determined. The circle points
Q1 , Q2 , Q3 are obtained by reﬂecting Q′ in the sides of the pole triangle.
Obviously, the following statement is true: The center Q0 and the reﬂection
Fig. 14.13 Relationships between circle points, reﬂection point Q′ and center Q0

428
14 Displacements in a Plane
point Q′ can be interchanged. If Q0 is made the reﬂection point of three
homologous points, Q′ is their center point (Burmester [4]). The two points
can be inside, on the perimeter or outside the triangle. It is left to the reader
to prove that the radii of the circle about Q0 and of the circle about Q′ as
center are equal.
Special case (a): Q0 coincides with a pole, for example with P12: In this case,
Q′=Q3 is an undetermined point on the line P23P31 ; Q1 lies on the dotted
line P31P1
23 , and Q2 lies on the line P23P2
31 .
Special case (b): Q′ coincides with a pole, for example with P12: In this
case, Q1=Q2=Q′=P12 ; Q3 =P3
12 ; Q0 is an undetermined point on the line
P23P31 .
Inﬁnitely Distant Center Point
With a center point Q0 at inﬁnity the circle points Q1 , Q2 , Q3 are on a
straight line. Its location is explained by Fig. 14.14 . Let Q0 be prescribed
as intersection of two arbitrarily directed parallel lines passing through P12
and P23 , respectively. In this case, the angles β12 and β23 explained in Fig.
14.13 are identical: β12 = β23 = β . This has the consequence that Q′ lies
on the circumcircle of the pole triangle (equal angles β subtended by the
chord P31Q′ ) . Since Q1 , Q2 , Q3 are the reﬂections of Q′ in the sides of the
triangle, each point lies on the reﬂection of the circumcircle in one side of the
triangle. Since these reﬂected circles are concurrent in S , the line Q1Q2Q3
passes through S .

Inﬁnitely Distant Circle Points
The interchangeability of center point Q0 and reﬂection point Q′ has the
consequence: If Q0 is an arbitrarily prescribed point on the circumcircle of
the pole triangle, the corresponding reﬂection point Q′ and the corresponding
circle points Q1 , Q2 , Q3 are at inﬁnity. The direction toward the reﬂection
point Q′ is determined by the angle β against the triangle side P23P31 (Fig.
14.15). Proposition: The direction toward the circle point Qi (i = 1, 2, 3) is
normal to the line Q0Si . The proof is given for the case i = 3 : The lines
leading from P23 toward Q′ and Q3 , respectively, must be symmetric with
respect to the line P23P31 . This is, indeed, the case since not only the two
angles β are equal, but also the two angles denoted α are equal. The reason
is that
γ = 90◦−α is the angle subtended by the chord S3P23 . End of
proof.
Sense of Triangle of Circle Points
In Fig. 14.16 the pole triangle of Fig. 14.13 is shown again. Its sides 1 , 2 and
3 deﬁne the sense of the pole triangle. In the ﬁgure the sense is clockwise.
In what follows, the side i of the pole triangle continued to inﬁnity in both
directions is referred to as line i (i = 1, 2, 3). The lines 1 , 2 and 3 divide the
inﬁnite plane into seven domains (the lines themselves do not belong to any
of these domains). If the center point Q0 is inside the pole triangle, also Q′
is inside, and the triangle of circle points Q1, Q2, Q3 has the same sense the
pole triangle has. Every time Q0 crosses one of the lines 1 , 2 , 3 the sense of
the triangle of circle points is reversed. Hence both triangles have the same
sense if Q0 is located in one of the four domains marked = , and they have

Fig. 14.16 The seven domains in the plane of the pole triangle and the sense of the
triangle of circle points Q1 , Q2 , Q3 . Symbols = and ̸= indicate that the sense is equal
or opposite, respectively, to the sense of the pole triangle if Q0 is located in the domain
under consideration
opposite senses if Q0 is located in one of the three domains marked ̸= . If
Q0 is located on one of the lines 1 , 2 , 3 , but not in a pole, two circle points
coincide (see the special case (b) above). In this case, there is no unique sense
of the triangle of circle points. If Q0 is located in a pole, Q′ is an arbitrary
point of the opposite line (see the special case (a) above). In this case, the
sense of the triangle of circle points depends upon whether Q′ is located on
a side of the pole triangle or on one of the continuations of this side. In the
former case, the sense equals the sense of the pole triangle, and in the latter
it is opposite to it.
Analytical Relationships
In what follows, the geometrical relationships described so far are expressed in
analytical form. First, the relationship between center point Q0 and reﬂection
point Q′ is expressed in terms of so-called normal coordinates. In Fig. 14.17
the normal coordinates u1 , u2 , u3 of Q0 are shown. Deﬁnition: ui is the
distance from the line i . All three normal coordinates are positive if Q0
is inside the triangle. Since a point of a plane has only two independent
coordinates, the three coordinates are subject to a constraint equation. It
expresses the fact that the areas of the three triangles created by the segments
connecting Q0 with the poles add up to the total area A of the triangle. In
terms of the side lengths s1 , s2 , s3 this is the constraint equation
s1u1 + s2u2 + s3u3 = 2A .
(14.46)
Let u′
1 , u′
2 , u′
3 be the correspondingly deﬁned normal coordinates of the
reﬂection point Q′ . The two-fold symmetrical occurrence of the angle β31
has the consequence that u1 : u3 = u′
3 : u′
1 . From this and from two more
such equations it follows that the desired analytical relationship between Q0
and Q′ has the form

It is quadratic-involutoric. Further applications of normal coordinates to the
study of positions of a plane are found in Blaschke [3] p.165 .
In what follows, analytical relationships are developed between the circle
points Q1 , Q2 , Q3 and the center point Q0 . In an arbitrary cartesian co-
ordinate system ﬁxed in Σ0 the coordinates of a point are interpreted as
real part and as imaginary part of a complex number. This number is given
the name of the point itself. Examples are the numbers Q1 and P12 in Fig.
14.13 . In this ﬁgure, the example i = 1 , j = 2 illustrates the fact that
for arbitrary combinations of indices i and j ̸= i the diﬀerence Q0−Pij is
rotated against the diﬀerence Qi−Pij through the angle ϕij/2 . This means
that the numbers ei ϕij/2(Qi −Pij) and (Q0 −Pij) have equal directions
(i, j = 1, 2, 3 ; i ̸= j ). According to (14.6) this is expressed in the form

(Qi −Pij)(¯Q0 −¯Pij)

(i, j = 1, 2, 3 ; i ̸= j ) .
(14.48)
Let the coordinates of the points be denoted as follows:
Qi = ξi+i ηi ,
Q0 = x+i y ,
Pij = uij+i vij
(i, j = 1, 2, 3 ; i ̸= j ) .
(14.49)
Substitution of these expressions results in equations which are linear with
respect to ξi , ηi , x and y . If the center point is known and the circle
points are unknown, the equations are written in the form (abbreviations
sij = sin ϕij/2 , cij = cos ϕij/2 ) :

(i, j = 1, 2, 3; i ̸= j) . For a ﬁxed value of i (i = 1, 2, 3) these are two
equations for ξi and ηi . Equation (14.48) shows that no unique solution
exists if Q0 is located in a pole. This is the special case (a) explained above.
If the coordinates (ξi, ηi) of a single circle point are given, the equations
are resolved for the coordinates (x, y) of the center point. For i = 1 , 2 and 3
one and the same coordinates (x, y) are obtained. Formally, this resolution
is achieved by reversing the sign of ϕij and by interchanging (ξi, ηi) and
(x, y) . The reason is that the resulting equations express the fact that the
numbers
e−i ϕij/2(Q0 −Pij) and
(Qi −Pij) have equal directions. The
solution is not unique if Qi is located in a pole. This is the special case (b)
explained above.
14.5 Relationships Between Four Positions. Pole Curve
Two positions of a plane determine a pole and a rotation angle, and three
positions determine a pole triangle. Hence four positions determine altogether
six poles and four pole triangles. In Fig. 14.18 the four positions are deﬁned by
the points Ai , Bi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4). The poles are constructed according to the
rules of Fig. 14.7 . In what follows, it is assumed that no pole is at inﬁnity and
that no two poles coincide. All relative positions are known if the positions
2 , 3 and 4 relative to position 1 are known. These three relative positions
are determined by altogether nine parameters. These are two coordinates
for each of the three poles P1k and the rotation angles ϕ1k (k = 2, 3, 4).
Between the poles and the semi-rotation angles of every pole triangle exist
the relationships shown in Fig. 14.11 and in (14.45). Every pole is pole in two
triangles. The reason is that for any two triples of positions i , j , k and i , j , ℓ
(i, j, k, ℓ= 1, 2, 3, 4 diﬀerent) the corresponding pole triangles (Pij,Pjk,Pki)
and (Pij,Pjℓ,Pℓi) are sharing the pole Pij . In both triangles the angle ϕij/2
is either internal or external angle at Pij . As an example, consider the pole
P12 common to the pole triangles (P12,P23,P13) and (P12,P24,P14) . From
P12 the sides P23P13 and P24P14 are seen under one and the same angle
ϕ12/2 . Also the sides P23P24 and P13P14 are seen from P12 under one and
the same angle (diﬀerent from ϕ12/2 ). The two pairs of sides represent pairs
of opposite sides of the pole quadrilateral (P13,P32,P24,P41). This notation
indicates the sequence of poles. Every side connects two poles having one
index in common. Poles in opposite corners, so-called opposite poles, have no
index in common.
Opposite sides of this pole quadrilateral are seen also from P34 under one
and the same angle (diﬀerent for each pair) and, ﬁnally, they are seen under
one and the same angle from any pole of the pole quadrilateral itself. The
reason is that a side seen from one of its endpoints appears under an arbitrary
angle.

spectively, A2 , A3 , A4 have the coordinates (−2; 2) , (−4; 5) and (−6; 5) , respectively.
The angles from A1B1 to AiBi (i = 2, 3, 4) are 45◦, 70◦and 120◦, respectively
The quadrilateral just considered is one of altogether three pole quadrilat-
erals of the general form (Pij,Pjk,Pkℓ,Pℓi) (i, j, k, ℓ= 1, 2, 3, 4 diﬀerent). The
other two are (P12,P23,P34,P41) and (P12,P24,P43,P31) . For all pole quadri-
laterals the following is true: From every pole any pair of opposite sides is
seen under angles which are either equal or which add up to π . Example:
From P13 the opposite sides P12P23 and P34P41 are seen under the angles
π −ϕ13/2 and ϕ13/2 , respectively. These angles have equal tangents. In
what follows, it is assumed that of the altogether six poles only the poles
of a single quadrilateral (Pij,Pjk,Pkℓ,Pℓi) are given. It is natural to ask for
all points P having the property that from P opposite sides of the given
quadrilateral appear under angles which are either equal or which add up to
π . The solution is found as follows. The pole quadrilateral (Pij,Pjk,Pkℓ,Pℓi)
is shown in Fig. 14.19 . let rij , rjk , rkℓand rℓi be the vectors pointing
from P to the four poles. Furthermore, let e be the unit vector normal to
the plane. Equality of tangents of angles is expressed as follows:
e · rij × rjk
rij · rjk
= e · rℓi × rkℓ
rkℓ· rℓi
(i, j, k, ℓ= 1, 2, 3, 4 diﬀerent) .
(14.51)
The relationships just described for pole triangles are identical with those
for spherical triangles associated with four positions of a rigid body with a
ﬁxed point (see Fig. 1.8a,b and (1.137)). It was shown that in the spherical
case, (1.137) deﬁnes a third-order cone of rotation axes. In the present planar
case, (14.51) deﬁnes a third-order pole curve (Burmester [4]). The curve is
uniquely deﬁned by a single pole quadrilateral, i.e., by eight parameters. On

this curve a ﬁfth pole can be chosen arbitrarily. Its location determines the
ninth parameter and, hence, also the sixth pole. Also this sixth pole lies on
the pole curve.
In Sect. 17.14 the pole curve plays a central role in the synthesis of linkages
leading a plane through prescribed positions. In what follows, the curve is
abbreviated p . It has many remarkable properties. Its equation in a carte-
sian x, y-system is deduced from (14.51). As shown in Fig. 14.19 the axes
are chosen such that Pij is the origin and that Pjk lies on the x-axis. The
coordinates of the poles are denoted (a2, 0) , (a3, b3) and (a4, b4) as shown.
With (x, y) being the coordinates of the point P the vectors in (14.51) have
the coordinates
rij :
(−x, −y) ,
rjk :
(a2 −x, −y) ,
rkℓ:
(a3 −x, b3 −y) ,
rℓi :
(a4 −x, b4 −y) . Equation (14.51) takes the form
a2y
x2 + y2 −a2x =
(b4 −b3)x + (a3 −a4)y + a4b3 −a3b4
x2 + y2 −(a3 + a4)x −(b3 + b4)y + a3a4 + b3b4
. (14.52)
Re-ordering of terms produces the following equation which is cubic in x as
well as in y :
(λx + μy + A)(x2 + y2) + B(y2 −x2) + 2Cxy + Dx + Ey = 0 ,

E = −a2(a3a4 + b3b4) .
 
(14.54)
In the case λ = μ = 0 , the pole quadrilateral is a parallelogram, and p is
an equilateral hyperbola. In what follows, this special case is excluded. It is
treated in Luck/Modler [13].
Propositions: 1) The curve p has an asymptote which is parallel to what is
called the midline of the pole quadrilateral. This is the line connecting the
midpoints of its diagonals.
2) In the x, y -system the asymptote has the slope −λ/μ .
Proof for (1): In Fig. 14.19 the midpoints of the diagonals are denoted M1 and
M2 . Through the four poles lines parallel to the midline M1M2 are drawn.
The projections of opposite sides of the pole quadrilateral along M1M2 are
equally long. From this it follows that from the inﬁnitely distant intersection
points of these parallel lines pairs of opposite sides are seen under equal
angles. This proves proposition (1) . In the x, y-system M1 and M2 have the
coordinates
x1 = a3/2 , y1 = b3/2 and
x2 = (a2 + a4)/2 , y2 = b4/2 .
This yields for the slope of M1M2 the expression
(y2 −y1)/(x2 −x1) =
(b3 −b4)/(a3 −a2 −a4) . According to (14.54) this is −λ/μ . End of proof.
The cubical nature of p has the consequence that every (straight) line not
parallel to the asymptote intersects p at three points two of which might
be imaginary. Lines parallel to the asymptote intersect p at two – real or
imaginary – points. The asymptote itself intersects p at a single real point.
In Fig. 14.20 the same pole quadrilateral is shown. Each side is denoted by
the index common to the poles at its endpoints. Let Πik be the intersection
point of the opposite sides j and ℓand let Πjℓbe the intersection point
of the opposite sides i and k . From Πik and from Πjℓopposite sides
are seen under equal angles βik and βjℓ, respectively. Hence both points
belong to p . The altogether three pole quadrilaterals deﬁne six points Πij
(i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 ; i ̸= j). In Fig. 14.18 these points are shown.
In Fig. 14.20 circles ki and kk with the peripheral angle βik subtended
by the opposite sides i and k , respectively, are drawn. They intersect at
Πik and at one more point which, because of the equality of the two angles,
also belongs to p . By the same argument the circles kj and kℓwith the
peripheral angle βjℓsubtended by the opposite sides j and ℓ, respectively,
intersect at Πjℓand at one more point belonging to p . The ﬁgure shows that
the four circles intersect at a single point Φ . This is proved as follows. To
begin with, let Φ be the intersection of kj and kk only. Also ki is passing
through Φ if the peripheral angles α −βjℓat Φ and γ at P ℓi are equal.
This is, indeed, the case since α appears as peripheral angle in the circle kk
also at Pkℓ, and from the triangle (Pℓi,Pkℓ, Πjℓ) it follows that γ = α−βjℓ.
In the same way it is shown that also the circle kℓis passing through Φ .
The curve p intersects the four circles at Φ , Πik , Πjℓ, at the poles of the
pole quadrilateral and at no other point. Indeed, if there were to be another

436
14 Displacements in a Plane
Fig. 14.20 Π-points of a pole quadrilateral and focus Φ
intersection point, say with the circle kj , the side j would be seen from this
point under the angle βjℓand the opposite side ℓunder a diﬀerent angle.
For each of the three pole quadrilaterals there exists an intersection point
Φ of four associated circumcircles of triangles. All three intersection points
coincide. Indeed, if they were diﬀerent points, the curve p could not inter-
connect these three points, the six poles and the six Π-points without inter-
secting at least one of the twelve circles at one more point. The signiﬁcant
point Φ is called the focus of p .
Of the asymptote so far only its direction parallel to the midline of the
pole quadrilateral is known. The focus Φ determines also its location. In Fig.
14.20 the following is seen. If, with the pair of opposite poles Pij and Pkℓ
being ﬁxed, the pole Pℓi tends on p towards Φ , the pole Pjk tends towards
inﬁnity on the asymptote. From this it follows that the asymptote is on the
same side of Φ as the midline and at twice the distance. Another consequence
is that the midlines of all three pole quadrilaterals coincide.
Another signiﬁcant point on p is deﬁned by the circumcircles of the four
pole triangles (see Fig. 14.21). The circumcircles intersect at a single point
U . This is proved as follows. First, only the circumcircles of the triangles
(P12,P24,P41) and (P13,P34,P41) are considered. They intersect at P41 and
at U . At P41 the peripheral angle subtended by P12P24 in the one circle
and the peripheral angle subtended by P13P34 in the other circle are equal.
Hence also at U the peripheral angles subtended by these sides are equal.
Since these sides are opposite sides of a pole quadrilateral, U belongs to p .
From no other point of the circle except P41 and U the two opposite sides are

14.5 Relationships Between Four Positions. Pole Curve
437
Fig. 14.21 Poles of Fig. 14.18 with circumcircles of four pole triangles intersecting at U
seen under equal angles. The same statements are valid for the circumcircles
of any two of the four pole triangles. From this it follows that, ﬁrst, all four
circles intersect at U and that, second, the curve p intersects these four
circumcircles at no points other than U and the poles.
In what follows, a property of the six Π-points is revealed. Let the curve
p be given and on it an arbitrary point P together with two straight lines
passing through P . These lines intersect p at two more points each. The four
intersection points thus deﬁned constitute a pole quadrilateral one Π-point of
which is the given point P . Now, choose as point P the pole Pℓi in Fig. 14.20
and through Pℓi the lines PℓiPij and PℓiPkℓ. These lines create the pole
quadrilateral (Pij, Πjℓ,Pkℓ, Πik) in which Πjℓand Πik are opposite poles.
The six Π-points constitute three pairs of opposite poles. Consequently, they
represent the poles belonging to four positions of the plane with which the
same pole curve p is associated. The Π-points of these poles are poles again
etc. Starting from the six original poles this procedure produces an inﬁnite
sequence of six-tuples of poles all lying on p . On a computer screen a graph
of p is most easily generated by calculating a suﬃciently large number of
six-tuples of poles. In Fig. 14.22 the pole curve for the six poles of Fig. 14.18
is shown together with its focus and its asymptote. The point of intersection
of the asymptote with p is called cardinal point H of p .
Next, Eq.(14.53) of the pole curve p is considered again. New coordinates
ξ, η are deﬁned through the transformation equations
x = μ(ξ −ξ0) + λ(η −η0)

λ2 + μ2
,
y = −λ(ξ −ξ0) + μ(η −η0)

λ2 + μ2
(14.55)
where ξ0 and η0 are as yet unspeciﬁed constants. This transformation has
the eﬀect that the ξ-axis is parallel to the asymptote of p . Substitution into
(14.53) produces an equation of the form

The coeﬃcients A′, . . . , F are functions of λ , μ , A , . . . , E and of ξ0 , η0 .
The constants ξ0 and η0 are chosen such that B′ = 0 and C′ = 0 :
ξ0 = −2Bλμ + C(λ2 −μ2)
(λ2 + μ2)3/2
,
η0 = 2Cλμ −B(λ2 −μ2)

(14.57)
Further below it is proved that the origin of the ξ, η-system is the focus Φ .
The x, y-coordinates of the origin are obtained from (14.55):
xΦ = Bλ −Cμ
λ2 + μ2 ,
yΦ = −Bμ + Cλ
λ2 + μ2 .
(14.58)
From the fact that the origin Φ lies on p it follows that also F = 0 . With
new abbreviations a , d and e Eq.(14.56) of the curve gets its normal form
(η −a)(ξ2 + η2) + d ξ + eη = 0 .

xΦ , yΦ satisfy the equations of the circles ki and kj of Fig. 14.20 . The
equation of a circle passing through three points (xi, yi) (i = 1, 2, 3) is

Both equations are, indeed, satisﬁed with (14.58) in combination with (14.54).
End of proof.
Resolution of (14.59) for η −a yields an expression which tends to zero
for
ξ →±∞. Consequently, the asymptote of p in the ξ, η-system has
the equation η = a . Its intersection with p , i.e., the cardinal point H in
Fig. 14.22 , has the coordinates ηH = a and ξH = −ae/d . The midline of
all three pole quadrilaterals has the equation
η = a/2 . This follows from
previous comments on Fig. 14.20 .
Further properties of the pole curve are revealed by introducing in (14.59)
for ξ2 + η2 the abbreviation r2 and by resolving the equation for η . This
results in the equations
ξ2 + η2 = r2,
η = a r2 −ξd/a
r2 + e

They are parameter equations with parameter r of a family of concentric
circles centered at Φ and of a family of lines passing through the cardinal
point H . The pole curve p is the geometric locus of all intersection points
of the family of circles and the family of lines (for each value of r one circle
and one line). The circle and the line for r = 0 intersect at the double
point Φ . From this it follows that the tangent to p in Φ passes through
H . This follows more directly from the derivative of (14.59). At Φ it is
η′ = −d/e = ηH/ξH .

addition, the transformation ξ = x+ξD , η = y+ηD to a parallel x, y-system
with origin (ξD , ηD) is made. The resulting equation is quadratic in x :
x2(y −ηD) + 2xyξD + y2(y + ηD) = 0 .
(14.66)
It is satisﬁed by
x = y = 0 . The Taylor formula for the solutions in the
neighborhood of the origin is x1,2 = yξ′
1,2 with the expressions (14.65). End
of proof.
The equation
e = a2
4 −d2
a2
(14.67)
resulting from (14.64) is a necessary condition for the existence of a double
point. Because of the squaring of a and d it is not a suﬃcient condition.
A pole curve without double point is either bicursal (Fig. 14.22) or uni-
cursal (the solid line in Fig. 14.23). Of which type it is can be seen di-
rectly from Fig. 14.18. An arbitrarily chosen quadrilateral (Pij,Pjk,Pkℓ,Pℓi)

(i, j, k, ℓ= 1, 2, 3, 4 diﬀerent) is interpreted as mobile four-bar with two ar-
bitrarily chosen neighboring poles, say Pij and Pjk , serving as frame (Fig.
14.24). Following a rotation ϕ of the left crank (or rocker) the coupler PℓiPkℓ
is either in the position AB or in the position AB′ . The midnormal of PℓiA
is intersected by the midnormal of PkℓB at Q0 and by the midnormal of
PkℓB′ at Q′
0 . Proposition: Q0 and Q′
0 are located on p .
Proof for Q0 : The triangles (Q0,A,B) and (Q0,Pℓi , Pkℓ) have all three side
lengths and, hence, also the angle α in common. Therefore, also the angles
denoted β are equal. From Q0 opposite sides of the quadrilateral are seen
under identical angles ( PijPjk and PℓiPkℓunder the angle α and PijPℓi
and PjkPkℓunder the angle β/2 ). This ends the proof for Q0 . The proof for
Q′
0 is based on the congruence of the triangles (Q′
0,A,B′) and (Q′
0 ,Pℓi ,Pkℓ) .
End of proof.
The pole curve is composed of the trajectories of Q0 and Q′
0 generated
when the shortest link of the four-bar is rotated through its entire angular
range. Depending on the link lengths this range is either 2π (case I ; fully
rotating link) or < 2π (case II). Conditions see in Grashof’s Theorem 17.1
(Eq. (17.4)). In case I , the trajectories of Q0 and Q′
0 are isolated from each
other which means that the pole curve is bicursal. In case II , the pole curve
is unicursal. The curve has a double point if the four-bar is foldable.
14.6 Tilings
Tiles are congruent plane ﬁgures which, if properly arranged, ﬁll the inﬁnite
plane without gaps and overlaps. The resulting pattern is called tiling. Every
tile of a tiling can be made to coincide with any other tile of the same tiling by
translation or rotation or reﬂection or glide reﬂection. The problem of ﬁnding
all possible forms of tiles is an open problem (see Gr¨unbaum/Shephard [6]).
The present section is devoted to important contributions made by Heesch
[8]. Without showing details of the theory his ﬁnal results are presented
because they have great aesthetical appeal as well as great economical and
engineering importance. If the inﬁnitely extended tiling as a whole coincides
with itself after a rotation about a pole P0 through an angle 2π/n (n integer),
it coincides with itself also after a rotation about P0 through any of the angles
2kπ/n (k = 1, . . . , n). The tilings under consideration have the property
that periodical translations in one or more directions 1, 2, . . . with associated
minimal period lengths t1, t2, . . . result in self-coincidence. Let t be the
smallest of these period lengths. Translation by t carries the said rotation
pole P0 to a point P1 at the distance t , and the translation by −t carries it
in the opposite direction to a point P−1 so that P−1 , P0 and P1 are collinear
with equal distances t . Rotation about P0 through the angle 2kπ/n carries
P1 into a point P(k, n) . This point may coincide with P−1 . If it does not

442
14 Displacements in a Plane
coincide, however, then, by assumption, its distance from P−1 cannot be
smaller than t . It is easily proved that this condition can be satisﬁed for all
k = 1, . . . , n only with n = 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 . In the case n = 5 , for example,
it is not satisﬁed with k = 2 . Thus, the only possible rotation angles are
2π/n with n = 2, 3, 4 and 6 .
Heesch gives a list of 28 basic types of tiles. The boundary of a tile consists
of at least two pairs and of at most ﬁve pairs of congruent segments. In
each pair of segments one segment can be arbitrarily prescribed (continuously
curved or with corners). The associated second segment is produced from
this ﬁrst one either by translation or by rotation or by glide reﬂection. In
the case of rotation, one of the endpoints of the ﬁrst segment is the pole,
and the rotation angle is 2π/n with n = 6, 4, 3 or 2 . A pair of segments
with rotation angle 2π/n (n = 6, 4, 3) is abbreviated CnCn , and a pair of
segments with rotation angle 180◦(i.e., a centrally symmetric line) is simply
abbreviated C (instead of C2C2 ). Figures 14.25a and b show as examples
a pair C6C6 and a line C .
Each segment in a pair of translated segments is abbreviated T , and each
segment in a pair of glide-reﬂected segments is abbreviated G . A pair T· · · T
must be disconnected (no intersections; no common endpoints). An example is
shown in Fig. 14.25c . A pair of glide-reﬂected segments is either disconnected
(G· · · G in Fig. 14.25d) or one endpoint of one segment coincides with the
image of the other endpoint (GG in Fig. 14.25e).
A basic type of tile is identiﬁed as follows. With an arbitrarily chosen sense
along the boundary the segments are sequentially listed by the symbols de-
noting the corresponding displacements (Cn , C , T or G). The complete
sequence of symbols serves as identiﬁer of the basic type. If the bound-
ary contains two pairs of glide-reﬂected segments, these pairs are denoted
G1 · · · G1 and G2 · · · G2 . Likewise, two pairs of translated segments are de-
noted T1 · · · T1 and T2 · · · T2 . If a boundary contains several pairs of rotated
segments with identical rotation angles, the pairs are placed in brackets, for
example (C4C4)(C4C4) . In this case, one segment C4 of the ﬁrst pair and
one segment C4 of the second pair can be prescribed independently and ar-
bitrarily. In the case of two or more lines C all lines are independent.

3) The axes of both glide reﬂections are orthogonal to each other
Remarks: The footnotes 1) , 2) and 3) of the Table are conditions. In what
follows, some geometrical properties are listed which do not represent condi-
tions, but consequences of two general conventions. The ﬁrst general conven-
tion requires that the boundary of each basic type is closed and free of double
points. This implies that the freedom in choosing one segment per pair is not
unlimited. The second general convention requires that in basic types with
several pairs of the form CnCn in each pair the sense of direction of rotation
(from the ﬁrst segment to the second segment) be the same. These conven-
tions have the following consequences which are not obvious immediately.
Basic type No. 3 : The axes of both glide reﬂections are parallel.
Basic type No. 10 : The four endpoints of the segments form a rhombus.
Basic type No. 11 : The four endpoints of the segments form a square.
Basic type No. 12 : The three poles form an equilateral triangle.
Basic type No. 13 : The pole of the pair C3C3 lies outside the equilateral
triangle formed by the pair C6C6 .
Basic type No. 19 : The axis of glide reﬂection is orthogonal to the translation
of the pair T· · · T . Begin by drawing the pair T· · · T .
Basic types No. 20 , 27 , 28 : All glide reﬂection axes are parallel to the trans-
lation of the pair T· · · T . Begin by drawing the pair T· · · T .

The nine basic types No. 2 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 18 , 20 , 21 , 26 and 28 represent
principal types from which all other basic types can be produced by shrinking
pairs of segments to zero. The following examples demonstrate the freedom
of choice in the design of tiles.
Basic type No. 12 (C3C3)(C3C3)(C3C3) : In Fig. 14.26a the points A , B and
P as well as the segment C3 from A to B and the segment C3 from A to P
are freely chosen. 120◦-rotations of these segments about B and P , respec-
tively, produce the points A′ and A′′ . The pole D of the third pair C3C3
and the poles B and P form an equilateral triangle. The freely chosen seg-
ment C3 from D to A′ is rotated through 120◦about D . In Fig. 14.26b the
tiling is shown. The salamander is a modiﬁcation of a form originally drawn
by the artist Escher. In a preface to one of Escher’s books Heesch expresses his
respect for Escher’s intuitive grasp of the basic type (C3C3)(C3C3)(C3C3) .
See also Coxeter’s comments on Escher’s work in Locher [12].
Basic type No. 15 CC3C3C6C6 : In Fig. 14.27a the points A , B and D as
well as the segment C6 from A to B and the segment C3 from A to D are
freely chosen. Rotations about B through 60◦and about D through 120◦
produce the points A′ and A′′ . These points are connected by a freely chosen
centrally symmetric line C . In Fig. 14.27b the tiling is shown (published in
1985 in [5] p.56 and the same year as frontcover of the June issue of mathe-
plus. Duden-Zeitschrift f¨ur Sch¨uler).
Basic type No. 26 CG1CG2G1G2 : In Fig. 14.28a the points A , B and A′′
as well as the segment G1 from A to B and the segment G2 from B to
A′′ are freely chosen. The segment G1 from A to B is glide-reﬂected to
A′B′ (axis 1-1 of glide reﬂection and translation along the axis arbitrary).
The segment G2 from B to A′′ is glide-reﬂected to B′′A

Heesch’s results have (quote Heesch) two important ﬁelds of application:
For one thing, they represent a basis for teaching all branches of art design
with surfaces; on the other hand, they constitute a rationalization principle
for the mass production of semi-ﬁnished products. Mass-produced parts made
of sheet metal for certain engineering purposes can often, without loss of func-
tionality, be slightly changed in shape so as to become tiles. The production
of sheet metal parts having this property reduces sheet metal waste, produc-

circular object. The tiling with this shape is shown in Fig. 14.29c .
Heesch’s theory does not require symmetry of individual tiles. However,
both axially symmetric tiles and centrally symmetric tiles can be obtained
from many basic types by a proper choice of segments. To give an example,
the basic type No. 2, T1T2T3T1T2T3 , is a centrally symmetric hexagon if as
segments T1 , T2 and T3 straight lines are chosen (lengths and directions
arbitrary). Other important results obtained from Table 14.2 are the follow-
ing.
Every triangle is a tile of the basic type CCC .
Every quadrilateral (convex or nonconvex) is a tile of the basic type CCCC .
Table 14.2 does not solve the problem for pentagons and hexagons completely,
but it provides important contributions to the solution. For being a tile it is
not necessary, but suﬃcient that two or more congruent polygons properly
joined together represent a basic type. In Heesch/Kienzle [7] ten diﬀerent
sets of suﬃcient conditions are listed for pentagons and thirty for hexagons.
Some of these sets of conditions are as follows.
Pentagons
1. A pentagon with two parallel sides is a tile. Two congruent pentagons of
such a shape produce the basic type T1T2T3T1T2T3 (Figs. 14.30a,b). Special
cases: Figure a
with two or three or four or ﬁve sides of the pentagon equal
in length.
2. A pentagon (convex or nonconvex) is a tile if it has two right angles with
pairwise identical leg lengths (the thick lines in Fig. 14.31). As is shown in
the same ﬁgure four congruent pentagons of such a shape produce the basic
type T1T2T1T2 . Special cases: Convex pentagons with three or four or ﬁve
sides equal in length.

two non-adjacent sides of equal lengths b and angles α + β = 180◦. Segments T1 , T2 ,
T3 of the boundary are marked by small circles
3. A pentagon is a tile if it has two nonadjacent sides of equal length b and
angles α + β = 180◦(the thick lines in Fig. 14.32). As is shown in the
same ﬁgure four congruent pentagons of such a shape produce the basic type
T1T2T3T1T2T3 . The same is true if the condition α +β = 180◦is replaced
by the condition α + β = 360◦. Special cases: Three or four or ﬁve sides of
the pentagon equal in length.
Hexagons: Let the sides of the hexagon be sequentially labeled 1 to 6 .
1. A hexagon is a tile if (i) sides 1 and 3 are parallel and (ii) sides 4 and 6
are parallel (Fig. 14.33 a or b)
2. A hexagon is a tile if sides 1 , 3 and 5 are parallel (Fig. 14.33c)
3. A hexagon is a tile if either sides 1 and 3 or sides 1 and 4 are (i) parallel
and (ii) equal in length (Fig. 14.33d or e).
It is left to the reader to produce from each of the Figs. 14.33a–e a basic
type by joining several congruent hexagons together.
It was said that the conditions on pentagons and hexagons given by
Heesch/Kienzle are suﬃcient, but not necessary. For the following state-
ments the reader is referred to Schattschneider [14] and Gr¨unbaum/Shephard
[6]. 1. The number of diﬀerent types of convex pentagonal tiles is unknown.
Many types are known, including types not satisfying the conditions given
by Heesch/Kienzle.
2. The number of diﬀerent types of convex hexagonal tiles is known to be
three.

(e) Sides 1 and 4 parallel and equal in length
3. Convex polygonal tiles with seven or more corners do not exist.
4. With many polygonal tiles more than one tiling is possible. Example: In the
case a = b the pentagon in Fig. 14.31 admits the tiling shown in Fig. 14.32.
A more remarkable example is the equilateral pentagon with internal angles
140◦, 60◦, 160◦, 80◦, 100◦(in this order) found by Rice (see Schattschnei-
der [14]). Since there are eleven ways in which these angles can be combined
to make 360◦, several diﬀerent tilings are possible, including two which dis-
play rotational and no other form of symmetry. This pentagon is composed
of a rhomb and an equilateral triangle. It is a special case of the type shown
in Fig. 14.30a .

15.1 Instantaneous Center of Rotation. Centrodes
According to (9.13) the instantaneous velocity distribution in a rigid body
in an arbitrary state of motion is determined by the velocity vA of a single
point A and by the angular velocity ω :
v = vA + ω × ϱ .
(15.1)
If the velocity vA(t) of the single point A is, independent of t , in a ﬁxed
plane ΣA , and if, in addition, ω(t) is, independent of t , orthogonal to
ΣA , the velocity v(t) of every point of the body and, consequently, also its
trajectory, is in a plane parallel to ΣA . This state of motion of the body
is called plane motion. In the special case ω(t) ≡0 , plane motion is pure
translation with velocity vA(t) . In what follows, ω(t) ̸= 0 is assumed. In
this general case, the screw axis (ISA) has the constant direction of ω(t) ,
and the pitch is p ≡0 (see (9.23)). The perpendicular from A onto the
screw axis is instantaneously
u = ω × vA
ω2
.
(15.2)
If as point A a point on the instantaneous screw axis is chosen, (15.1) be-
comes
v = ω × ϱ .

15 Plane Motion
This equation shows that the instantaneous velocity distribution is that of a
rotation with ω about what is called instantaneous axis of rotation.
In what follows, the body is represented by a single body-ﬁxed plane Σ2
which is moving in a reference plane Σ1 . The body-ﬁxed point A , its velocity
vA and the vector u are located in Σ2 as well as in Σ1 . The point at the
tip of u is the point of intersection of the instantaneous axis of rotation with
both planes. This point is referred to as instantaneous center of rotation P
because Σ2 is instantaneously rotating about P . During a continuous plane
motion which is not a rotation about a ﬁxed axis the instantaneous center P
is neither ﬁxed in Σ2 nor ﬁxed in Σ1 . Its trajectory in Σ2 is called moving
centrode km . It is determined by the time-varying vector u(t) given by (15.2).
The trajectory of P in Σ1 is called ﬁxed centrode kf . At every time t both
centrodes have point P in common and, at this point, zero relative velocity.
Let vrel be the velocity of P along the moving centrode. Then its velocity
along the ﬁxed centrode is, according to (9.11), v = vA +ω ×u+vrel = vrel .
Hence the tangents of the centrodes at P coincide (see Fig. 15.1). These
results are summarized in
Theorem 15.1. During a continuous plane motion of a body the moving
centrode km (ﬁxed in Σ2 ) is rolling without slipping on the ﬁxed centrode kf
(ﬁxed in Σ1 ).
This theorem is a special case of Painlev´e’s Theorem 9.6 on the raccording
motion of two axodes which are generated by the instantaneous screw axis
in general spatial motion of a rigid body. In plane motion the screw axis is
the instantaneous axis of rotation. Both axodes are general cylinders. The
raccording motion is pure rolling. The centrodes are the intersections of the
cylinders with the planes Σ1 and Σ2 .
Inverse motion: The inverse of the motion of Σ2 relative to Σ1 is the mo-
tion of Σ1 relative to Σ2 . Both motion and inverse motion have the same
instantaneous center of rotation P and the same centrodes in Σ1 and in
Σ2 . What the ﬁxed centrode is for the inverse motion is the moving centrode

plane Σ2 , instantaneous center of rotation P and vector u

for the motion and vice versa. In both motion and inverse motion P moves
along the centrodes with equal velocities.
15.1.1 Theorems of Burmester and Kennedy/Aronhold
Equation (15.2) determines the location of the instantaneous center P . In
Sect. 15.2.1 a simpler equation in terms of complex numbers is formulated.
For most practical purposes the following geometric method of construction
is preferable. According to (15.3) the vector from the center P to an arbitrary
point of the body is orthogonal to the velocity v of this point. From this
it follows that P lies on the normal of v through the body point under
consideration. Two nonparallel normals determine P uniquely. Consequently,
P is known if for two body points with nonparallel velocities the directions of
these velocities are known. Neither the magnitudes nor the senses of direction
need be known. If the velocities are parallel, also their magnitudes must be
known. There are two special cases.
1. Permanent rotation about an axis ﬁxed in Σ1 and, consequently, also ﬁxed
in Σ2 . In this case, the point P on this axis is not only instantaneous, but
permanent center of rotation. Centrodes do not exist.
2. Pure translation: All points of Σ2 have identical velocities. The angular
velocity is ω = 0 . Equation (15.2) states that the center P is the inﬁnitely
distant intersection of the normals to these velocities.
In Fig. 15.2 a body is shown together with the instantaneous center P .
The velocity vi of an arbitrary body-ﬁxed point Pi is proportional to the
radius PPi . Let the rotated velocity v∗
i be the vector vi rotated counter-
clockwise through π/2 . It is pointing towards P . Elementary geometry yields
Burmester’s
Theorem 15.2. The polygon connecting the tips of the rotated velocities v∗
i
of points Pi ( i = 1, 2, . . . ) is both similar and directed parallel to the polygon
P1, P2, . . . .
This theorem is valid independent of the scale chosen for the velocity vectors.
If, in particular, the scale is chosen such that all vectors v∗
i terminate at P ,
the similar polygon degenerates to the point P .
If three bodies i , j and k are in plane motion relative to each other,
there exist, at any time t , three instantaneous centers Pij , Pjk , Pki and
three relative angular velocities ωij , ωjk , ωki. Deﬁnition: ωij is the angular
velocity of body i (ﬁrst index) relative to body j . Then
ωji = −ωij .
(15.4)
In addition, ωik = ωij + ωjk is valid and, consequently,

points of some link the directions of the velocities are known. In such cases,
the geometric construction of the instantaneous center requires
Theorem 15.3. (Kennedy/Aronhold)1 The instantaneous centers Pij , Pjk
and Pki of three bodies i , j , k in plane motion relative to each other are
collinear.
Proof: Suppose the centers Pik and Pjk are known (Fig. 15.3). The center Pij
is the point at which body i and body j have equal velocities v relative to
body k . This establishes the equation ωik × ϱPikPij = ωjk × ϱPjkPij . The
two vector products are collinear only if ϱPikPij and ϱPjkPij are collinear.
This ends the proof already. In addition, the equation requires the two vector
products to be equal in magnitude and in sense of direction. If ϱPikPij and
ϱPjkPij have equal directions (opposite directions), also ωik and ωjk have
equal directions (opposite directions). Hence the scalar magnitudes satisfy

The theorem of Kennedy and Aronhold is a special case of the theorem stating
that three instantaneous screw axes associated with spatial motions of three
bodies relative to each other have a common perpendicular (see Sect. 12.1).
15.1.2 Illustrative Examples
In this section the importance of instantaneous centers and of centrodes for
the solution of practical problems is illustrated by eight examples.
Example 1 : Cam mechanism
The cam mechanism of Fig. 6.15 is investigated again. The missing instanta-
neous center P12 is determined from (15.6) by setting k = 0 , i = 1 , j = 2 ,
ω10 = ˙ϕ1 and ω20 = ˙ϕ2 . The distance between P10 and P20 is the con-
stant
√
a2 + b2 . Hence
ϱP20P12 = ϱP10P12 −
√
a2 + b2 . Therefore, with the
abbreviation ϱP10P12 = ϱ ,
˙ϕ1/ ˙ϕ2 = (ϱ −
√
a2 + b2)/ϱ or
ϱ =
√
a2 + b2
1 −˙ϕ1/ ˙ϕ2
.
(15.7)
In the rotating x, y-system P12 has the coordinates x = −ϱ cos ϕ1 , y =
ϱ sin ϕ1 . The ratio
˙ϕ1/ ˙ϕ2 and the angle ϕ1 are known functions of ϕ2 (see
(6.114) and (6.115)). The coordinates x(ϕ2) , y(ϕ2) determine the centrode
ﬁxed on the cam. It was shown that during the quarter revolution of the
ellipse from the position
ϕ1 = ϕ2 = 0 , α = π/4
to the position
ϕ1 =
π/2 , ϕ2 = 0 , α = 3π/4
the ratio
˙ϕ1/ ˙ϕ2
changes from the extremal
value
2a2/(a2 −b2)
through ∞at ϕ2 = ϕ2max to the extremal value
−2b2/(a2 −b2) . The associated points of the centrode have the coordinates
[ x = 0 ,
y = −(a2 −b2)/
√
a2 + b2 ] , [ x = 0 , y = 0 ] and
[ x = (a2 −
b2)/
√
a2 + b2 , y = 0 ] , respectively. The entire centrode is obtained by
reﬂecting the curved segment connecting these three points in the x-axis and
in the y-axis. The centrode has the form of a rosette with four leaves of equal
length (one pair of leaves diﬀerent in shape from the other). Similar arguments
lead to equations for the centrode ﬁxed on the follower. This centrode is an
oval with a single axis of symmetry along the bisector of the right angle.
Example 2 : Elliptic trammel
In Fig. 15.4a a rod of length ℓis shown the endpoints A and B of which
move along mutually orthogonal guides. These guides deﬁne the plane Σ1 .
The rod is part of the inﬁnitely extended plane Σ2 . The instantaneous center
P is the intersection point of the perpendiculars drawn as dashed lines. In

456
15 Plane Motion
every position of the rod its distances from M and from the midpoint C
of the rod are ℓand ℓ/2 , respectively. From this it follows that the circles
shown in the ﬁgure are the centrodes. Theorem 15.1 says that the small circle
k2 ﬁxed on the rod rolls in the big circle k1 ﬁxed in Σ1 .
Remark: In Sect. 10.1 the motion of a body with a ﬁxed point 0 was
investigated two points P1 and P2 of which are constrained to two mutually
orthogonal ﬁxed planes E1 and E2 , respectively. In the projection along the
line of intersection of E1 and E2 these planes are mutually orthogonal guides
for the projections of P1 and P2 . When the apex angle α in the triangle
(P1,0,P2) is very small, the polhode cone and the herpolhode cone have the
circular cross sections described by Eqs.(10.21). These are the circles shown
in Fig. 15.4a where the two points are called A and B . End of remark.
Obviously, not only the points A and B on the circumference of k2 , but
every point on this circumference moves along a straight line through M .
Hence two wheels having the diameter ratio 1 : 2 can be used for guiding the
endpoints of a rod along two lines under an arbitrary angle α (see Fig. 15.4b).
If ℓis again the rod length, the radius of the small wheel is ℓ/(2 sin α ) . This
follows from the theorem that in the small circle the central angle subtended
by the chord ℓequals 2α .
During two full revolutions of k2 the rod moves through all four quad-
rants of k1 . From an engineering point of view the generation of this motion
by means of two toothed wheels is better than by sliding two points along
straight guides. The simplest possible forms of toothed wheels are shown in
Fig. 15.5 . On the small wheel cylinders of arbitrary diameter are ﬁxed with
their centers on the circumference of k2 . Every cylinder is moving in a slot
cut into the big wheel. The cylinders and the slots are the ﬂanks of the teeth.
The minimum number of teeth is two. Pins, as the cylinders are called, are
the historically oldest forms of teeth. See also Sec. 16.1.5 .

In what follows, the trajectory of an arbitrary point Q ﬁxed in Σ2 is
investigated. The straight line passing through Q and C intersects k2 at
two points A and B (see Fig. 15.4c). After what has been said these points
move along mutually orthogonal straight lines passing through M . These
lines ﬁxed in Σ1 constitute the x, y-system best suited for the description
of the trajectory of Q . With r denoting the radius of the small circle and
with the distance R of Q from C the x, y-coordinates of Q are
x = (r −R) cos ϕ ,
y = (r + R) sin ϕ .
(15.8)
In the special cases R = r and R = −r , these are the equations of the
straight lines x ≡0 and y ≡0 , respectively. In all other cases, the constraint
equation cos2 ϕ + sin2 ϕ = 1 produces the equation of an ellipse:
x2
(r −R)2 +
y2
(r + R)2 = 1 .
(15.9)
The semi-axes |r −R| and |r + R| are the distances of Q from A and from
B , respectively. Hence the conclusion: A rod with endpoints moving along
straight guides as well as a set of gear wheels having the diameter ratio 1 : 2
is capable of generating elliptical trajectories with arbitrary ratio of principal
axes. For this reason both systems are referred to as elliptic trammel.
Darboux Motion
Before continuing with plane motion a harmonic translation along the axial
z-axis is superimposed on the rolling motion. Let z(ϕ) = a sin ϕ with arbi-
trary amplitude a be the displacement when the radius MC is under the
angle ϕ against the x-axis as shown in Fig. 15.4c . In this so-called Darboux
motion the circles k1 and k2 are the cross sections of raccording cylinders.
Proposition: The trajectory of every body-ﬁxed point is located in a plane
(every point in its own plane) and, furthermore, these trajectories are either
ellipses or straight-line segments.
Proof: As representative point the point is chosen which has in the position
ϕ = 0 the coordinates
x = (r −R) cos ϕ0 , y = (r + R) sin ϕ0 , z = z0

458
15 Plane Motion
with arbitrary constants R , ϕ0 , z0 . In the position ϕ ̸= 0 (arbitrary) it
has the coordinates
x(ϕ) = (r −R) cos(ϕ + ϕ0) , y(ϕ) = (r + R) sin(ϕ +
ϕ0) , z(ϕ) = a sin ϕ + z0 . The trajectory is in a plane if these coordi-
nates are linearly dependent, i.e., if there are constants F , G , K such that
Fx(ϕ) + Gy(ϕ) + z(ϕ) + K ≡0 . This is the condition
sin ϕ [−F(r −R) sin ϕ0 + G(r + R) cos ϕ0 + a]
+ cos ϕ [ F(r −R) cos ϕ0 + G(r + R) sin ϕ0]
+ K + z0 ≡0 .(15.10)
It is satisﬁed by
F = a sin ϕ0
r −R
G = −a cos ϕ0
r + R
K = −z0 .
(15.11)
This proves that the trajectory is planar. That it is either an ellipse or a
straight-line segment follows from the fact that its projection onto the x, y-
plane is described by (15.9). End of proof. Darboux [7] showed that this
special motion is the only nonplanar motion (planar in the narrower sense
deﬁned following (15.1)) having the property that every body-ﬁxed point is
moving in a plane (see also Bottema/Roth [4]).
After this digression the plane motion shown in Fig. 15.4a is considered
again. In what follows, the inverse motion is investigated. This means that
the small circle k2 is stationary. The large circle k1 is rolling on k2 . Every
diameter of k1 is sliding through a ﬁxed point on k2 . This is shown in
Fig. 15.6a . The two mutually perpendicular diameters of k1 which up to
now were ﬁxed guides for moving points A and B are now moving lines g1
and g2 which are guided through ﬁxed points A and B , respectively. An
engineering realization is the Oldham coupling of which an exploded view is
shown in Fig. 15.6b . The ﬁxed points A and B are located on the axes of
two parallel shafts with discs 1 and 2 . Grooves on these discs are guides for
the lines g1 and g2 which are materialized as rails on the central disc 3 . The
Oldham coupling transmits the angular velocity of one shaft to the other.

B (a) and exploded view of Oldham coupling (b)

Figure 15.7a shows the circle k1 rolling on the ﬁxed circle k2 . As in Fig.
15.4a the radii are denoted ℓfor k1 and ℓ/2 for k2 . Also the notations P
and M for the instantaneous center of rotation and for the center of k1 are
the same. To be investigated is the trajectory of an arbitrary point Q ﬁxed on
k1 at the radius R ( R < ℓor R = ℓor R > ℓ). This point Q determines
two mutually perpendicular diameters ﬁxed on k1 which are sliding through
ﬁxed points A and B on the circumference of k2 . The trajectory of Q , from
now on abbreviated q , is most easily described in the x, y-system with origin
A and with the x-axis along the diameter AB of k2 . The polar coordinates
r and ϕ of Q are related through the equation2
r(ϕ) = ℓcos ϕ + R
(15.12)
(right-angled triangle (M,A,B) ). The x , y-coordinates are
x(ϕ) = r cos ϕ = (ℓcos ϕ + R) cos ϕ ,
y(ϕ) = r sin ϕ = (ℓcos ϕ + R) sin ϕ .
 
(15.13)
Elimination of ϕ yields the implicit equation

15 Plane Motion
(x2 + y2 −ℓx)2 = R2(x2 + y2) .
(15.14)
In terms of the dimensionless quantities ξ = x/ℓ, η = y/ℓand ϱ = R/ℓ
the equation is
(ξ2 + η2 −ξ)2 = ϱ2(ξ2 + η2) .
(15.15)
These curves are called lima¸cons of Pascal (after Etienne Pascal, father of
Blaise Pascal).
Equation (15.14) shows that the x-axis is an axis of symmetry of q . The
equation does not change if R is replaced by −R . Hence two points Q and
Q∗located symmetrically to M trace one and the same lima¸con of Pascal.
The reason is that the center M of k1 circles k2 twice per revolution of
k1 . After half a revolution M is in its initial position, while Q is in the
position Q∗opposite M . Other properties of lima¸cons of Pascal are explained
geometrically as follows. In Fig. 15.7a the line QH perpendicular to the line
AQ is drawn. It is tangent to the circle k3 with radius R and with ﬁxed
center B . From this it follows that the lima¸con of Pascal q is the pedal curve
of this circle. The pedal curve of an arbitrary curve c is deﬁned as follows.
From a ﬁxed point A perpendiculars are dropped to all tangents of c . The
curve connecting the feet of these perpendiculars is the pedal curve of c .
From this it follows that q is tangent to k3 at the points of intersection
with the x-axis.
The tangent t of q in Q is perpendicular to PQ since P is instantaneous
center. The midpoint K of PQ is also midpoint of AH . Thales’ circle over
PQ (the dotted circle) passes through the ﬁxed point A (also through H ).
At Q it is tangent to q . Points H and K vary with ϕ . Their cartesian
coordinates xH , yH and xK , yK are related through the equations xH =
2xK and yH = 2yK . Since H lies on the ﬁxed circle (xH −ℓ)2 + y2
H = R2 ,
point K lies on the ﬁxed circle (xK −ℓ/2)2 +y2
K = (R/2)2 . This is the circle
k shown in Fig. 15.7a . It is concentric with k2 , and its radius is R/2 . These
facts are summarized in the statement that q is enveloped by all circles
centered on k and passing through A . This is demonstrated in Fig. 15.7b
in which A and the circle k are copied from Fig. 15.7a .
Next, the polar-coordinate equation (15.12) is considered again: r(ϕ) =
ℓcos ϕ + R . In the case R < ℓ, the function r(ϕ) has two roots. They are
associated with the double point A of q (Fig. 15.8a). In the case R = ℓ,
r(ϕ) has a double root. In this case, q has a cusp at A (Fig. 15.8b). This
curve is called cardioid. In the case
ℓ< R < 2ℓ, shapes with inﬂection
points result (Fig. 15.8c), and in the case R > 2ℓ, shapes without inﬂection
points (Fig. 15.8d). In the case R > ℓ, the ﬁxed point A is an isolated point
which is not part of the trajectory traced by Q . Equation (15.14) is satisﬁed
by the coordinates x = y = 0 of A independent of R , whereas the polar-
coordinate equation r(ϕ) = ℓcos ϕ + R shows that r = 0 is possible if and
only if R ≤ℓ.

trammel is made use of in many engineering apparatuses (examples see in
Wunderlich [30]).
Example 3 : Body with one line passing through a ﬁxed point and
with one point moving along a ﬁxed line
In Fig. 15.9 the x, y-system is the ﬁxed frame Σ1 , and the ξ, η-system is the
moving body Σ2 . The body-ﬁxed η-axis is constrained to pass through point
A ﬁxed in the frame at x = a , and point B ﬁxed on the body at ξ = b
is constrained to move along the frame-ﬁxed y-axis. To be determined are
the equations of the ﬁxed centrode kf in the x, y-system and of the moving
centrode km in the ξ, η-system. In addition, equations are to be formulated
for the trajectory of the body-ﬁxed point Q with coordinates ξ = v , η = u
(arbitrary).
Solution: Motion and inverse motion (motion of Σ1 relative to Σ2 ) are
of identical nature. Equations for the centrode kf in the x, y-system are
transformed into equations for km in the ξ, η-system by replacing (x, y, a, b)
by (ξ, η, b, a) . This is seen by reﬂecting the ﬁgure in the line y = x .
Fixed centrode kf : The instantaneous center P is the intersection of the
normal to the η-axis at A and the normal to the y-axis at B . The x, y-
coordinates of P are expressed in terms of the angle ϕ :

In the special case b = 0 , this is the parabola y2 = a(x −a) . In the special
case b = a , it is the parabola
y2 = a(2x −a) . In this case, Fig. 15.9 is
symmetric. The pole P is equidistant from the ﬁxed point A and from the

parabola. The moving centrode is the congruent parabola η2 = a(2ξ −a)
with focus B and with the η-axis as directrix.

equation for x −a with the solutions

(15.18)
This equation is satisﬁed by the coordinates x = a , y = 0 of A . This does
not mean that kf is unconditionally passing through A . This happens when
B is at the origin of the x, y-system. This is possible only if a2 > b2 . Likewise,
km is passing through B only if b2 > a2 .
Trajectory of Q : In terms of ϕ the x, y-coordinates of Q are
x = u cos ϕ + (v −b) sin ϕ ,
y = (ηA −u) sin ϕ + v cos ϕ
= −u sin ϕ + v cos ϕ + (a + b sin ϕ) tan ϕ .
⎫

(15.19)
The velocity and the acceleration of Q are determined by the time derivatives
˙x , ˙y and ¨x , ¨y , respectively. For eliminating ϕ the second equation is written
in the form
y cos ϕ = −u sin ϕ cos ϕ + v(1 −sin2 ϕ) + a sin ϕ + b sin2 ϕ .
(15.20)
Solving for cos ϕ yields the expression

463
cos ϕ = v + a sin ϕ + (b −v) sin2 ϕ

(15.21)
Substitution into the ﬁrst Eq.(15.19) produces a linear equation for sin ϕ
with the solution
sin ϕ =
uv −xy
u(x −a) + y(b −v) .
(15.22)
With this expression the ﬁrst Eq.(15.19) yields
cos ϕ = x(x −a) + v(b −v)
u(x −a) + y(b −v) .
(15.23)
The parameter-free equation sin2 ϕ + cos2 ϕ = 1 is quadratic in y :
y2[x2 −(b −v)2] −2yu[bx −a(b −v)]
= u2[(x −a)2 −v2] −[x(x −a) + v(b −v)]2 .
(15.24)
In the case u = 0 , (15.22) follows directly from the ﬁrst Eq.(15.19).
If Q is located on km , the trajectory has a cusp on kf in the position
when Q is the pole P . The condition for Q to be located on km is obtained
from (15.17) by replacing (x , y , a , b) by (v , u , b , a) :
u2 −b(v −b) = a

u2 + (v −b)2 .
Example 4 : Rod moving tangent to a circle and with one point
along a straight line
The rod AB in Figs. 15.10a,b is constrained to move tangentially to a unit
circle and with its endpoint A along a straight line. In Fig. 15.10a this line
is a diameter of the circle and in Fig. 15.10b it is a tangent to the circle. To
be determined are in either case the equations of the ﬁxed centrode kf in the
x, y-system with origin 0 and of the moving centrode km in the ξ, η-system
with origin A .
Solution: In both ﬁgures the instantaneous center P is the intersection of the
normal to the circle at the point of contact and of the normal to the straight
line at A . The coordinates x, y and ξ, η of P as functions of the angle α
are obtained from triangles. First, Fig. 15.10a is analyzed. The coordinates

The ﬁrst two equations yield x2 = (1 + sin α)/(1 −sin α) = 1 + 2 sin α/(1 −
sin α) = 1+2y . Hence the centrodes are the congruent parabolas x2 = 2y+1
and ξ2 = 2η + 1 . These parabolas are shown in Fig. 15.10b . The foci are
0 and A , respectively, and the directrices are the line y = −1 and the
line η = −1 , respectively. Through a comparison of angles it is veriﬁed that
(0,A,P) is an isosceles triangle. From this it follows that the parabolas are
located symmetrically with respect to the altitude h of the triangle, and that
this altitude is the common tangent at P .
The motions shown in Figs. 15.10a and b can be interpreted in a diﬀerent
way as follows. The body-ﬁxed line η = −1 is moving through the ﬁxed point
0 , and the body-ﬁxed point A is moving along a ﬁxed line y = const ( y = 0
in Fig. 15.10a and y = −1 in Fig. 15.10b ). With this interpretation both
motions turn out to be special cases of Fig. 15.9. The notation is diﬀerent,
however. Figure 15.10a is the special case b = 0 , and Fig. 15.10b is the
special case a = b = 1 . From (15.17) it was deduced that in the former case
one of the centrodes is a parabola, and that in the latter case both centrodes
are congruent parabolas.

nism in antiparallelogram conﬁguration. The ﬁxed link A0B0 and the coupler
AB have equal length ℓ, and the crossed cranks A0A and B0B have equal
length r > ℓ. In the instantaneous position shown the line t–t is a line
of symmetry. To be determined are the ﬁxed centrode kf and the moving
centrode km of the coupler.
Solution: The instantaneous center P is the point of intersection of the
cranks. Since its distance from B equals its distance from A0 , the sum
of the distances PA and PB is the constant length A0A= r . From this it
follows that the moving centrode km is the ellipse having A and B as foci
and passing through P . For reasons of symmetry the ﬁxed centrode kf is the
ellipse having A0 and B0 as foci. The line t–t is the instantaneous tangent.
The semi principal axes of the ellipses are a = r/2 and b = 1/2
√
r2 −ℓ2 < a .
This is seen by drawing the four-bar and the ellipses in the two positions in
which AB is parallel to A0B0 .
In what follows, the same four-bar is considered, but this time the longer
link BB0 is the ﬁxed link. The moving coupler is the link AA0 . In this
case, P∗is the instantaneous center of the coupler. Since its distance from B
equals its distance from A0 , the diﬀerence of the distances P∗A and P∗A0
is the constant length AB= ℓ. From this it follows that the moving centrode
k∗
m is the hyperbola having A and A0 as foci and passing through P∗. For
reasons of symmetry the ﬁxed centrode k∗
f is the hyperbola having B and
B0 as foci. The line t–t is the instantaneous tangent. The semi principal
axes of the hyperbolas are a = ℓ/2 (real axis) and b = 1/2

r2 −ℓ2 . This
concludes the investigation.

In the foldable four-bar considered next, not opposite links, but adjacent
links have pairwise identical lengths. The left crank A0A and the coupler
AB have length a , and the ﬁxed link A0B0 and the right crank B0B have
length ℓ> a . The four-bar should be drawn in a position in which the
crank angle ϕ = ∢(B0A0A) is in the range 0 < ϕ < π/2 . The line AB0
is a line of symmetry. As before, the pole P of the coupler is the point of
intersection of the cranks. Its polar coordinates in the ﬁxed frame are ϕ and
r =A0P . Let R be the distance of P from B0 . The law of cosines states that
R2 = ℓ2+r2+2ℓr cos ϕ . Auxiliary lines and points are deﬁned as follows. The
line through B parallel to the line of symmetry intersects the line A0B0 at a
point C at the distance ℓfrom B0 (similar triangles). The line through B0
parallel to the coupler intersects the auxiliary line BC at a point D . Finally,
let P∗be the reﬂection of P in the line of symmetry. The similarity of the
triangles (B,P∗,C) and (D,B0,C) establishes the equation (R + ℓ)/r = ℓ/a .
Hence R = ℓ(r/a −1) . Setting the square of this expression equal to the
previous expression for R2 results in the polar-coordinate equation for the
ﬁxed centrode kf :
r =
2ℓa
ℓ2 −a2 (ℓ+ a cos ϕ) .
(15.28)
Comparison with (15.12) shows that kf is a lima¸con of Pascal and, because of
ℓ> a , one without double point. Its line of symmetry is A0B0 . The constant
coeﬃcients depending on ℓand a determine the quantities ℓand R of Fig.
15.8.
An equation for the moving centrode km is obtained as follows. In the
coupler-ﬁxed system the pole P has the polar coordinates ϕ = ∢(ABB0)
and r′ =BP= ℓ−R and with the above expression for R
r′ = ℓ(2 −r/a) .
Hence
r = a(2 −r′/ℓ) . Substitution into (15.28) results in the desired
equation for km :
r′ =
2ℓa
a2 −ℓ2 (a + ℓcos ϕ) .
(15.29)
This is a lima¸con of Pascal with the double point B and with the line of sym-
metry BA . The equation is obtained directly from (15.28) by interchanging
ℓand a .
Example 6 : Door mechanism
In Fig. 15.12 the labeled six-body linkage of an airplane door is shown in the
position door closed. The body of the airplane is the frame 0 , and the door
is body 5 . All revolute joints are instantaneous centers with labels as shown.
The joints of bodies 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 form a parallelogram 1 , and the joints of
bodies 5 , 3 , 2 , 4 form another parallelogram 2 . Both parallelograms share
bodies 2 and 3 and the joint P23 . About which point P50 does the door
rotate relative to the frame in the position shown? Where is P50 located in
other positions of the door? In doors of modern furniture the same linkage is
used with link lengths on the order of 1 cm.

15.1 Instantaneous Center of Rotation. Centrodes
467
Fig. 15.12 Six-link door mechanism with permanent center of rotation P50
Solution: In a parallelogram parallel sides rotate relative to each other
about an inﬁnitely distant instantaneous center. According to the theorem of
Kennedy/Aronhold this center is the intersection of the other pair of parallel
sides of the same parallelogram. Examples: P30 is the intersection of the lines
P13P10 and P23P20 , and P25 is the intersection of the lines P23P35 and
P24P45 . This determines the desired center P50 as intersection of the lines
P20P25 and P30P35 . The instantaneous centers P50 , P20 , P23 and P35 form
a parallelogram.
During large motions of the door body 3 is in translatory motion relative
to body 0 . The parallelogram 2 produces constraints forcing also body 4
to be in translatory motion relative to body 0 . During a translatory motion
of a body the diﬀerence of the position vectors of two body-ﬁxed points A
and B is constant: rA −rB = const . Applied to body 3 this means: The two
joints connecting body 3 with body 5 and with body 2 , respectively, have
a constant diﬀerence of position vectors. Since the latter joint is moving on
a circle around P20, the former is moving on a circle around P50 . The same
argument applies to body 4 . The joints connecting this body with body 5
and with body 2 , respectively, have a constant diﬀerence of position vectors.
Since the latter joint is moving on a circle around P20, the former is moving
on a circle around P50 . Hence two points of body 5 move on circles about
P50 . This proves that P50 is not only instantaneously, but permanently center
of rotation of the door.
Example 7 : Instantaneous centers of an eight-link mechanism
In this example, the theorem of Kennedy and Aronhold alone does not
suﬃce for constructing instantaneous centers of rotation. In addition, also
Burmester’s theorem 15.2 must be applied. The planar linkage in Fig. 15.13
consists of the frame 0 and of moving bodies 1, . . . , 7 which are intercon-
nected by the ten revolute joints A , B , C , D , E , B′ , C′ , D′ , E′ , F . Ac-

468
15 Plane Motion
cording to Gr¨ubler’s Eq.(4.2) the degree of freedom of the linkage is one. To
be determined are the instantaneous centers Pi0 (i = 1, . . . , 7) and P23 .
Solution: All revolute joints are centers of rotation with the respective labels
as shown. Examples are P10=A and P12=B . The system does not contain
any four-bar linkage so that no pair of straight lines is available which, by the
theorem of Kennedy and Aronhold, might yield an additional instantaneous
center. In the following applications of Burmester’s theorem 15.2 velocity al-
ways means velocity relative to frame 0 . In Fig. 15.13 the rotated velocities
of the points B and B′ are drawn to scale as vectors v∗
B and v∗
B′ , respec-
tively, terminating at the center P10 =A . Theorem 15.2 applied to body 2
states that the tip of the rotated velocity v∗
E of point E on rod 2 lies on the
line h parallel to rod 2 . The tip of the rotated velocity v∗
D of D lies on the
line CD since rod 4 rotates about the center P40 =C . Next, theorem 15.2 is
applied to body 6 . The tips of the rotated velocities v∗
D , v∗
E and v∗
F form
a triangle which is both similar and parallel to the triangle (D,E,F) . It is the
triangle (D1,E1,F1) if the tip of v∗
E is located at E1 , and it degenerates to
point M (intersection of h and CD ) if the tip of v∗
E is located at M . Since
the tip of v∗
E is an as yet unknown point on h , the tip of v∗
F is an as yet
unknown point on the line g=MF1 .
By the same arguments applied to the right-hand side of the system, i.e.,
to bodies 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 , the tip of v∗
F is located also on the line g′=M′F′
1 .
Hence the tip of v∗
F lies at the intersection Q of g and g′ . This determines
the instantaneous center P60 as intersection of the velocity normals
v∗
D
and v∗
F and the instantaneous center P70 as intersection of v∗
D′
and v∗
F .

of P60 and P70 rests on Burmester’s theorem 15.2

15.1 Instantaneous Center of Rotation. Centrodes
469
All other instantaneous centers are found with the help of the theorem of
Kennedy and Aronhold. Examples: The center P20 is the intersection of the
lines P62P60 = EP60 and P10P21 = AB . The center P30 is the intersection
of the lines E′P70 and AB′ . The center P23 is the intersection of the lines
P20P30 and P21P31 = BB′ .
Example 8 : Kutzbach’s angular velocity diagram for spur gears
In spur gears all bodies move in one common plane. All axes of gear wheels
and also all pitch points are instantaneous centers of rotation. Since the
distances of these points are constant, also all angular velocity ratios are
constant. The planetary gear shown in Fig. 15.14a is used as illustrative
example for explaining Kutzbach’s general-purpose method for determining
angular velocities [22]. The gear consists of the stationary frame 0 , the pinion
cage 1 and gear wheels 2 , 3 and 4 . The degree of freedom is one. A single,
arbitrary angular velocity is prescribed, for example, ω10 (pinion cage 1
relative to the frame). To be determined are all angular velocities ωij (i, j =
0, . . . , 4 ; i ̸= j ).
Solution: The instantaneous centers P30 , P32 and P24 in Fig. 15.14a are
pitch points, and the centers P31 , P21 , P10 and P40 are located on wheel
axes. From these centers lines parallel to the axes are drawn thus creating
the r, v-velocity diagram in Fig. 15.14b . This velocity diagram consists of
straight lines i = 0, . . . , 4 . Deﬁnition: The line i is the graph of the function
vi(r) . This function determines the velocity (relative to body 0 ) of the point
ﬁxed on body i at the radius r from the center line. The line 0 for the
frame and the line v1(r) = ω10r for the pinion cage 1 are given by the
problem statement. These lines are drawn ﬁrst (with arbitrary scale). Wheel
3 has at the radius of P30 the same velocity body 0 has, and at the radius
of P31 the same velocity body 1 has. Through these two points the line 3

470
15 Plane Motion
is determined. Subsequently, the lines 2 and 4 are determined in the same
way.
The diagram in Fig. 15.14c is the angular velocity diagram. It is con-
structed by drawing, from a point on the center line, lines parallel to all
lines in the velocity diagram. These lines have the equations vi(r) = ωi0r .
The function values at an arbitrarily chosen radius r = r0 are ωi0r0 . Thus,
these values together with the scale chosen for the prescribed angular velocity
ω10 determine the directions and magnitudes of all other angular velocities
ωi0
(i = 1 . . . , 4). With these velocities also all relative angular velocities
ωij = ωi0 −ωj0 (i, j = 1, . . . , 4 ; i ̸= j ) are determined. For demonstration
ω23 is shown.
15.2 Velocity and Acceleration in Complex Formulation
In the case of plane motion, complex formulations of position, velocity and
acceleration of points are more convenient than vector formulations. In Fig.
15.15 the planes Σ1 and Σ2 of Fig. 15.1 are shown again. To Σ1 the real
and the imaginary axis of a complex plane are attached. In this plane complex
numbers representing positions, velocities and accelerations are formulated.
Let ϕ(t) be the time-dependent angle of rotation of Σ2 relative to Σ1 .
It is the angle of an arbitrarily chosen line ﬁxed in Σ2 against the real axis
ﬁxed in Σ1 (positive counterclockwise). The angular velocity and the angular
acceleration of Σ2 are
˙ϕ and ¨ϕ , respectively. It is assumed that
˙ϕ ̸= 0 .
Points A and Q are arbitrarily chosen points ﬁxed in Σ2 . Let rA and r
be the complex numbers specifying their positions in Σ1 . The relationship
between the two is expressed in the form
r = rA + ϱei ϕ
( ϱ = complex const) .
(15.30)
Diﬀerentiation with respect to time yields expressions for velocity and ac-

and Q ﬁxed in Σ2 . ϱ is a complex constant

15.2 Velocity and Acceleration in Complex Formulation
471
celeration. With the abbreviations ˙r = v ,
˙rA = vA ,
¨r = a and ¨rA = aA
these expressions are
v = vA + i ˙ϕϱei ϕ = vA + i ˙ϕ(r −rA) ,
(15.31)
a = aA + i ¨ϕ(r −rA) + i ˙ϕ(v −vA) = aA + (i ¨ϕ −˙ϕ2)(r −rA) .
(15.32)
These equations are the complex formulations of the vector Eqs.(9.13) and
(9.81) in the case of planar motion. At time t = const (arbitrary) v and a
are linear functions of r with constant coeﬃcients. From this fact Burmester
derived two theorems:
Theorem 15.4. The tips of the complex velocities vi of arbitrary points Qi
of Σ2 ( i = 1, 2, . . . ) produce a ﬁgure similar to the ﬁgure produced by the
points Qi .
Theorem 15.5. The tips of the complex accelerations ai of arbitrary points
Qi of Σ2 ( i = 1, 2, . . . ) produce a ﬁgure similar to the ﬁgure produced by the
points Qi .
Theorem 15.4 is the complex formulation of Theorem 15.2 on rotated veloc-
ities.
15.2.1 Instantaneous Center of Rotation
Let rP be the complex number representing the instantaneous center of ro-
tation P . Equation (15.31) with r = rP and v = 0 yields the expression
rP = rA + i vA
˙ϕ
.
(15.33)
This is the complex formulation of (15.2). In the special case A=P and vP =
0 , (15.31) becomes
v = i ˙ϕ(r −rP) .
(15.34)
This is the complex formulation of (15.3). Two complex velocities vA and
v of arbitrary points positioned at rA and r , respectively, determine the
instantaneous center of rotation rP uniquely. Equation (15.34) is written
also with rA and vA : vA = i ˙ϕ(rA −rP) . Multiplying this equation by v ,
(15.34) by vA and taking the diﬀerence results in
rP = vrA −vAr
v −vA
.
(15.35)
This is the complex formulation of the geometric construction of P as point
of intersection of the normals to the velocities of two points. Solving the
equation for v yields the expression

472
15 Plane Motion
v = vA
r −rP
rA −rP
.
(15.36)
15.2.2 Instantaneous Center of Acceleration
Equation (15.32) shows that there exists a point in Σ2 which has, instanta-
neously, the acceleration a = 0 . This point is called instantaneous center of
acceleration G . Actually, every body-ﬁxed point on the line through G and
normal to Σ2 has zero acceleration. The complex position rG of G is
rG = rA −
aA
i ¨ϕ −˙ϕ2 .
(15.37)
In the special case A=G and aG = 0 , (15.32) becomes
a = (i ¨ϕ −˙ϕ2)(r −rG) .
(15.38)
Two complex accelerations aA and a of arbitrary points positioned at rA
and r , respectively, determine the instantaneous center of acceleration rG
uniquely. Equation (15.38) is written also with rA and aA :
aA = (i ¨ϕ −
˙ϕ2)(rA −rG) . Multiplying this equation by a , (15.38) by aA and taking the
diﬀerence results in
rG = arA −aAr
a −aA
.
(15.39)
Solving this equation for a yields the expression
a = aA
r −rG
rA −rG
.
(15.40)
Equations (15.37) – (15.40) correspond to (15.33) – (15.36).
In (15.38) the factor (i ¨ϕ −˙ϕ2) is the same for all points of Σ2 . This
factor has the eﬀect of stretch rotation of r −rG . Let α be the angle of
this stretch rotation. The angle is π/2 in the special case
˙ϕ = 0 , and it is
π in the special case ¨ϕ = 0 . Figure 15.16 shows the general case with the
center of acceleration G and with the accelerations a1 and a2 of two points
Q1 and Q2 , respectively. By attaching to Q1 not only a1 , but also a2 and
the acceleration zero of G the triangle (P1,P∗
2,Q1) is obtained. From (15.38)
it follows that the triangles (G,Q1,P1) and (G,Q2,P2) are similar, and from
Theorem 15.5 it follows that the triangles (P1,P∗
2,Q1) and (Q1,Q2,G) are
similar. These two similarities are the geometrical interpretations of (15.40)
and (15.39). They determine a2 if only G and the acceleration a1 are given,
and they determine G if only a1 and a2 are given.

15.2.3 Inﬂection Circle. Bresse Circles
Subject of investigation is again the instantaneous state of plane motion at
some ﬁxed time t . Up to now the locations of the real axis and the imaginary
axis of the complex plane in Σ1 were unspeciﬁed. Now, the instantaneous
center of rotation P is chosen as origin. Furthermore, the imaginary axis is
given the (positive or negative) direction of the acceleration of the point of
Σ2 coinciding with P . This has the consequence that the center of rotation
has position rP = 0 , velocity vP = 0 and acceleration aP = i a0 with a
positive or negative scalar a0 . The position in Σ1 of a point ﬁxed in Σ2 is
written in the form
r = x + i y . This means that x and y are cartesian
coordinates along the real and the imaginary axis. In these terms Eqs.(15.31)
and (15.32) for velocity and acceleration of the point r have the forms
v = i ˙ϕ(x + i y)
a = i a0 + (i ¨ϕ −˙ϕ2)(x + iy)
= −˙ϕy + i ˙ϕx ,
= −˙ϕ2x −¨ϕy + i (a0 −˙ϕ2y + ¨ϕx) .

(15.41)
The following problems are solved.
1. Determine all points of Σ2 characterized by collinearity of acceleration a
and velocity v.
2. Determine all points of Σ2 characterized by mutual orthogonality of ac-
celeration a and velocity v.
The center of acceleration G as well as the center of rotation P are singular
points satisfying both conditions. The ﬁrst condition is satisﬁed by points
the trajectories of which have zero curvature. In other words: The point is
either on a straight trajectory or it is instantaneously inﬂection point of
its trajectory. The second condition is satisﬁed by points the acceleration
of which is instantaneously pointing through P (either toward P or away
from P ). In other words: These points have, instantaneously, no acceleration
component along their trajectory. According to (14.6) a and v are collinear
if the imaginary part of av is zero, and they are mutually orthogonal if the

474
15 Plane Motion
real part is zero. With (15.41)
av = ˙ϕ{ ¨ϕ(x2 + y2) + a0x + i [ ˙ϕ2(x2 + y2) −a0y]} .
(15.42)
Both conditions result in the equation of a circle. The ﬁrst circle is called
inﬂection circle (geometric locus of all instantaneous inﬂection points). Both
circles are also referred to as Bresse circles [6]. Their equations are
inﬂection circle:
˙ϕ2(x2 + y2) −a0y = 0 ,
(15.43)
second Bresse circle:
¨ϕ (x2 + y2) + a0x = 0 .
(15.44)
In Fig. 15.17 both circles are drawn in solid lines. With the coordinate
y2 = a0
˙ϕ2
(15.45)
of the point denoted P2 the inﬂection circle has the equation
x2 + y2 −y2y = 0 .
(15.46)
From the ﬁgure it is seen that at points of inﬂection tangents to trajectories
are passing through P2 . At the origin P and at the center of acceleration G
both circles intersect orthogonally. The coordinates of G are
Fig. 15.17 Center of acceleration G at the intersection of the Bresse circles (solid lines).

(15.47)

15.2 Velocity and Acceleration in Complex Formulation
475
The line passing through P2 and G passes also through the second point of
intersection of the second Bresse circle with the x -axis. In the case ¨ϕ = 0 ,
the second Bresse circle degenerates to the line x = 0 , and the center of
acceleration G is located at P2 .
Next, the motion of Σ2 is again interpreted as rolling motion of the cen-
trode ﬁxed in Σ2 on the centrode ﬁxed in Σ1 . The point of rolling contact
is P . The point of Σ2 coinciding with P has, instantaneously, zero velocity
and the acceleration a0 in y -direction. From this it follows that its trajec-
tory has a cusp in P . The trajectory into and out of P is tangent to the
y -axis. This means that the y -axis is the common normal of both centrodes,
and the x -axis is the common tangent.
Example: In the elliptic trammel shown in Fig. 15.4a the circle k2 is the
moving centrode. It was shown that all points of k2 move on straight lines.
From this it follows that k2 is also the inﬂection circle. The second Bresse
circle has its center on the tangent to the inﬂection circle in P . Its radius
depends on ¨ϕ . End of example.
15.2.4 Center of Acceleration and Bresse Circles of
the Inverse Motion
The inverse of the motion of Σ2 relative to Σ1 is the motion of Σ1 relative
to Σ2 . For angular velocity and angular acceleration of Σ1 and for velocities
and accelerations of points ﬁxed in Σ1 (9.17), (9.18) and (9.19) are valid for
general spatial motion:
ωrel = −ω ,
˙ωrel = −˙ω ,
vrel = −v ,
arel = −a + 2ω × v .
(15.48)
The quantities carrying the index
rel are associated with the inverse motion,
and the ones without this index are associated with the motion. In the special
case of planar motion, the equations have the forms
˙ϕrel = −˙ϕ ,
¨ϕrel = −¨ϕ ,
vrel = −v ,
arel = −a + 2i ˙ϕv . (15.49)
Let G∗be the center of acceleration of the inverse motion. Its location rG∗
is obtained in two steps. First, in (15.37) for the location rG of G the index
rel is attached to all quantities. In the second step all quantities carrying the
index are replaced by the respective expressions in (15.49). The result is
rG∗= rA + 2i ˙ϕvA −aA
i ¨ϕ + ˙ϕ2
.
(15.50)
The same procedure applied to (15.43) and (15.44) yields for the Bresse circles
of the inverse motion the equations

476
15 Plane Motion
inﬂection circle:
˙ϕ2(x2 + y2) + a0y = 0 ,
(15.51)
second Bresse circle:
¨ϕ (x2 + y2) + a0x = 0 .
(15.52)
Thus, the second Bresse circles of motion and inverse motion are identical,
whereas the inﬂection circle of the inverse motion is the reﬂection of the
inﬂection circle of the motion in the tangent to the centrodes. Also the center
of acceleration G∗is the reﬂection of the center of acceleration G . In Fig.
15.17 all centers and circles are shown.
15.3 Curvature of Plane Trajectories
15.3.1 Normal Poles
As before, an arbitrary continuous motion of a plane Σ2 relative to a refer-
ence plane Σ1 is considered. In the present section curvatures of trajectories
of points of Σ2 are investigated. Curvature is a diﬀerential-geometric prop-
erty which is determined by the shape of the trajectory independent of the
motion generating the trajectory. For this reason, the complex representation
known from (15.30) is used with ϕ as independent variable:
r(ϕ) = rA(ϕ) + ϱei ϕ
(ϱ = const) .
(15.53)
As before,
˙ϕ ̸= 0 is assumed which means that the instantaneous center of
rotation exists.
The n th derivative of r with respect to ϕ is denoted r(n) . For the deriva-
tives with n =1 , 2 and 3 also the notations r′ , r′′ and r′′′ are used. The
n th derivative is (see (15.31) and (15.32))
r(n) = r(n)
A
+ inϱei ϕ = r(n)
A
+ in(r −rA)
(n = 1, 2, . . .) .
(15.54)
Deﬁnition: The normal pole of n th order, denoted Pn , is the particular point
of Σ2 for which the n th derivative is zero. Let rPn be the complex number
representing Pn . Then, by deﬁnition,
0 = r(n)
A
+ in(rPn −rA)
(n = 1, 2, . . .) ,
(15.55)
whence it follows that
rPn = rA −i−nr(n)
A
(n = 1, 2, . . .) .
(15.56)
The expression on the right-hand side is independent of ϱ . Since A is an
arbitrary point of Σ2 , rA can be replaced by r . Hence

15.3 Curvature of Plane Trajectories
477
rPn = r −i−nr(n)
(n = 1, 2, . . .) .
(15.57)
For n = 1, . . . , 4 the formula yields
rP1 = r + i r′ ,
rP2 = r + r′′ ,
rP3 = r −i r′′′ ,
rP4 = r −r(4) . (15.58)
In continuing this sequence the factors +i , +1 , −i , −1 of the n th deriva-
tive are periodically repeated. Equation (15.57) yields
r(n) = in(r −rPn)
(n = 1, 2, . . .) .
(15.59)
Thus, r(n) is known for all points of Σ2 if Pn is known. Writing (15.57)
also for rPn+1 and taking the diﬀerence results in the equation
in(rPn+1 −rPn) = r(n) + i r(n+1)
(n = 1, 2, . . .)
(15.60)
and with the ﬁrst Eq.(15.58)
r(n)
P1 = in(rPn+1 −rPn)
(n = 1, 2, . . .) .
(15.61)
The relationship dr/dt = ˙ϕ dr/dϕ shows that P1 is identical with the in-
stantaneous center of velocity. In the special case of motion with ˙ϕ = const,
dnr/dtn = ˙ϕn r(n) and, in particular, d2r/dt2 = ˙ϕ2 r′′ . From this it follows
that in the special case
˙ϕ = const, P2 is identical with the instantaneous
center of acceleration G . Already in Fig. 15.17 this point was denoted P2 .
In the x, y-system of this ﬁgure the normal poles are, in the instantaneous
position shown,
rP1 = 0 ,
rP2 = i y2 ,
rPn = xn + i yn
(n > 2) .
(15.62)
The coordinates y2 , xn and yn (n > 2) are determined by the motion of
plane Σ2 .
Example: In Figs. 15.26 and 15.27 the rolling motion of a planetary wheel
1 on or inside a ﬁxed sun wheel 0 is shown. The planetary wheel is the
moving plane Σ2 , and the sun wheel is plane Σ1 . The point denoted P10 is
the normal pole P1 . As points A and Q in the sense of Fig. 15.15 the wheel
center P12 and the wheel-ﬁxed point C are chosen. Their complex numbers
rA and r are given in (15.119) in terms of constant parameters r0 , r1 , b
and of the variables ϕ1 and ϕ2 explained in the ﬁgures: rA = (r1 −r0)ei ϕ2 ,
r = (r1 −r0)ei ϕ2 + bei ϕ1 . The angle ϕ1 is the angle ϕ of Eq.(15.53). From
(15.120) the relationship ϕ2 = λϕ with λ = r1/(r1 −r0) is copied. With
the additional abbreviation r1 −r0 = a the complex numbers are
rA = aei λϕ ,
r = aei λϕ + bei ϕ .
(15.63)
The n th derivative of r is

478
15 Plane Motion
r(n) = in(λnaei λϕ + bei ϕ) = in[r −a(1 −λn)ei λϕ] .
(15.64)
With this expression Eq.(15.57) for the normal pole Pn becomes
rPn = a(1 −λn)ei λϕ = (1 −λn)rA
(n ≥1) .
(15.65)
Hence rPn −rA = −λnrA . This shows that the normal poles are located on
the normal to the centrodes, and that their distances from the center of the
planetary wheel form a geometric series. The elliptic trammel in Fig. 15.4
is the planetary gear with λ = −1 . In this special case, the normal poles
coalesce alternatingly with P1 and with the center of the planetary wheel.
End of example.
15.3.2 Normal Poles of the Inverse Motion
Let P∗
n be the n th-order normal pole of the inverse motion (motion of Σ1

15.3.3 Euler-Savary Equation
In this section the curvature of trajectories is investigated. An important
role is played by the inﬂection circle shown in Fig. 15.18. As is known from
Fig. 15.17 the circle is determined by the normal poles P1 and P2 . It is the
geometric locus of all points of Σ2 the trajectories of which have, instanta-
neously, an inﬂection point and a tangent passing through the normal pole
P2 which has the coordinate (see (15.45)) y2 = a0/ ˙ϕ2 , a0 being the accel-
eration of the point of Σ2 coinciding with P1 . For simplifying the ﬁgure the
case y2 < 0 is illustrated.The tangent to the inﬂection circle in P1 is also the
tangent to the centrodes which are in rolling contact at P1 . The vector e in
the ﬁgure is the unit vector along an arbitrarily directed line through P1 . In
what follows, this line is referred to as line e . It is speciﬁed by the angle α
against the x-axis. Let Q with position vector re be an arbitrary point ﬁxed
in Σ2 on the line e . Furthermore, let W be the second intersection point
of the line e with the inﬂection circle. Its position vector is denoted rWe , so
that α and rW are the polar coordinates of the circle. To be determined is
the instantaneous center of curvature M of the trajectory of Q . The position
vector of M is denoted Re . The coordinates r , rW and R are positive, zero
or negative. Finally, let ϱ be the radius of curvature of the trajectory of Q
(not to be confused with the complex number ϱ in (15.53)). Its deﬁnition is

ϱ = R −r .
(15.69)
In the case shown in the ﬁgure, ϱ < 0 .
The desired relationship between M and Q , i.e., between R and r is
found as follows. The velocity v of Q has the magnitude v = r ˙ϕ . The
normal component of the acceleration of Q which is directed toward M is
denoted ane . Its magnitude an (positive or negative) is a function of the
radius of curvature:
an = v2
ϱ = r2 ˙ϕ2
R −r .
(15.70)
With (9.81) an is expressed through the acceleration a0 of the point of Σ2
instantaneously coinciding with P1 :
an = a0 · e −r ˙ϕ2 .

Hence
a0 · e −r ˙ϕ2 = r2 ˙ϕ2

From the unconditionally valid three-angle equation4
3 Euler 1765, Savary 1845
4 When π/2 is added to all three angles or to α1 and α2 only or to α1 only, the
alternative equations are obtained:
cos α1 sin(α2 −α3) + cos α2 sin(α3 −α1) + cos α3 sin(α1 −α2) = 0 ,
cos α1 cos(α2 −α3) −cos α2 cos(α3 −α1) + sin α3 sin(α1 −α2) = 0 ,
cos α1 sin(α2 −α3) −sin α2 cos(α3 −α1) + sin α3 cos(α1 −α2) = 0 .
The corresponding equations for hyperbolic functions are
sinh x1 sinh(x2 −x3) + sinh x2 sinh(x3 −x1) + sinh x3 sinh(x1 −x2) = 0 ,
cosh x1 sinh(x2 −x3) + cosh x2 sinh(x3 −x1) + cosh x3 sinh(x1 −x2) = 0 ,
cosh x1 cosh(x2 −x3) −cosh x2 cosh(x3 −x1) −sinh x3 sinh(x1 −x2) = 0 ,
cosh x1 sinh(x2 −x3) −sinh x2 cosh(x3 −x1) + sinh x3 cosh(x1 −x2) = 0 .
These formulas are not found in any collection of formulas known to the author including
the rich collection Skanavi [27]

15.3 Curvature of Plane Trajectories

sin α1 sin(α2 −α3) + sin α2 sin(α3 −α1) + sin α3 sin(α1 −α2) = 0
(15.76)
in combination with (15.74) it follows that
s1 sin(α2 −α3) + s2 sin(α3 −α1) + s3 sin(α1 −α2) = 0 .
(15.77)
Given the constants s1 and s2 on two lines e1 , e2 and the direction of a
third line e3 relative to these two, the equation determines the constant s3
on line e3 . The tangent to the centrodes as line of reference is not needed
for this purpose. The equation was ﬁrst formulated by Fayet [9] without,
however, explicitly referring to (15.76).
From the right-angled triangle (P1,W,P2) in Fig. 15.18 it follows that
rW = y2 sin α . This proves the identity of s with the polar coordinate rW :
s = rW .
(15.78)
This follows also directly from (15.73). At the inﬂection point W the center
of curvature is at inﬁnity. Hence R = ∞and s = rW .
Euler-Savary Equation of the Inverse Motion
In the inverse motion, trajectories in Σ2 produced by points Q ﬁxed in Σ1
are considered. Let M∗be the center of curvature with the position vector
R∗e . In the inverse motion a0 is replaced by −a0 (see Theorem 9.1; a0 is
the acceleration of the point coinciding with P1). From (15.74) it follows that
s is replaced by −s . Thus, the Euler-Savary equation of the inverse motion
is
1
r −1
R∗= −1
s .
(15.79)
Now back to the motion. The trajectory of the point Q coinciding with
P1 ( r = 0 ) has a cusp at P1 . About the curvature at the cusp no statement
is made by the Euler-Savary equation.
On the tangent to the centrodes, i.e., on the line characterized by α = 0 ,
(15.75) requires that R = 0 independent of r . This means: For all points Q
on this line, with the exception of Q=P1 , the associated center of curvature
M is located at P1 .
A single pair of points Q1 , M1 and its quantities r1 , R1 determine a line
e1 and, through (15.73), the constant s1 on this line. The same equation
then determines for every point Q on this line the associated point M .
Likewise, a second pair of points Q2 , M2 on another line e2 determines s2
on this line and then for every point Q on this line the associated point M .
Subsequently, Fayet’s Eq.(15.77) determines the constant s3 on any third
line e3 speciﬁed by the angular diﬀerence α3 −α1 and, consequently, the
center of curvature M for every point Q on this line.
Example: These analytical methods ﬁnd an important application in the
theory of the four-bar mechanism (see the four-bar M1Q1Q2M2 in Fig. 15.19).

482
15 Plane Motion
The moving plane Σ2 under investigation is the plane ﬁxed to the coupler
Q1Q2 . When the four-bar is moving, every point Q ﬁxed in Σ2 moves along
a trajectory referred to as coupler curve. Properties of coupler curves are
the subject of Sect. 17.8. The Euler-Savary equation determines the center
of curvature of the coupler curve in an instantaneous position of Q .
The pole P1 of Σ2 lies at the intersection of the cranks. On the lines e1
and e2 the ﬁxed points M1 and M2 are the centers of curvature associated
with Q1 and Q2 , respectively. The ﬁgure provides the quantities r1 , R1 ,
r2 , R2 and α2 −α1 from which s1 and s2 and everything else is calculated.
The points W1 and W2 have the polar coordinates s1 and s2 , respectively.
The pole P2 is the point of intersection of the perpendiculars to the lines e1
and e2 at W1 and W2 , respectively. In the auxiliary ξ, η -system with origin
P1 and with the ξ-axis along e1 these perpendiculars have the equations
ξ = s1 and ξ cos(α2 −α1) + η sin(α2 −α1) = s2 , respectively. Hence P2
has the coordinates ξ2 = s1 , η2 = [s2 −s1 cos(α2 −α1)]/ sin(α2 −α1) . The
tangent to the centrodes has the equation η = −ξξ2/η2 . The signiﬁcance of
the angles β1 , β2 is explained later. End of example.

The analytical methods explained above have geometrical interpretations
which are useful for graphical constructions. Graphical constructions have
the advantage of making things visible. But they have the disadvantage of
relying on intersections of lines which, frequently, are either almost parallel
or intersecting outside the available sheet of paper.

15.3 Curvature of Plane Trajectories

First, a method known as sawtooth construction is explained. As prepara-
tory step, the Euler-Savary Eq.(15.73) in combination with (15.69), R =
ϱ + r , and with (15.78), s = rW , is written in the form
ϱ(rW −r) = r2 .
(15.80)
Consider Fig. 15.20 which is in part a copy of Fig.15.18. The relationships
between the points P1 , Q , M and W on a line e can be expressed geo-
metrically as follows. Let P∗be an arbitrarily chosen auxiliary point. Lines
P∗M and P∗P1 are drawn and parallel to these lines the lines g1 through
P1 and g2 through W . Proposition: The point of intersection W ∗of g1
and g2 lies on the line P∗Q .
Proof: The triangles (Q,M,P∗) and (Q,P1,W∗) are similar, and the trian-
gles (Q,P1,P∗) and (Q,W,W∗) are similar. Therefore, QP∗: QW∗equals
ϱ : r as well as r : (rW −r) . Hence ϱ(rW −r) = r2 . This is Eq.(15.80). End
of proof.
The name sawtooth construction refers to the shape of the ﬁgure. If P1
and any two of the points Q , M and W are given, the missing third point
is determined.
Fig. 15.20 Sawtooth construction
Example: In Fig. 15.19 the points W1 , W2 can be constructed by two
sawtooth constructions applied to the lines e1 and e2 (preferably, both with
one and the same auxiliary point P∗). Following this, the normal pole P2 is
constructed graphically as point of intersection of two perpendiculars. Any
third line e3 intersects the circle in a point W3 . For an arbitrary point Q
on this line the associated point M can be constructed by one more sawtooth
construction. End of example.
Bobillier showed that the tangent to the centrodes (the x-axis) can be con-
structed without constructing the inﬂection circle (see Fig. 15.19). It suﬃces
to draw the line h through P1 and the point A at the intersection of the

lines M1M2 and Q1Q2 (when the quadrilateral M1Q1Q2M2 is interpreted
as four-bar, A is the instantaneous center of rotation of the two cranks rel-
ative to each other). The lines e1 , e2 and h deﬁne the angles β1 and β2 .

Consider the triangles (A,P1,M1) and (A,P1,Q1) located to the right of line
e1 . The diﬀerence of the areas equals the area of the triangle (A,Q1,M1) .
This is expressed in the form

Once the tangent to the centrodes is known, the theorem can be used
for constructing the center of curvature M3 associated with an arbitrarily
chosen point Q3 . This is done in the following steps.

1. Draw the line h′ through P1 under the angle α1 (known by now) against
the line P1Q3 .
2. Construct the point A′ as point of intersection of h′ with the line Q1Q3 .
3. The desired point M3 is the point of intersection of the lines M1A′ and
P1Q3 .
15.3.4 Radii of Curvatures of Centrodes
In Fig. 15.21 the points Q and M on an arbitrary line e are those of Fig.
15.18. In the ﬁgure also the centrode k2 ﬁxed in Σ2 and the centrode k1 ﬁxed
in Σ1 together with their point P1 of rolling contact are shown. The centers
of curvature of the centrodes at P1 are denoted Mp
1 and Mp
2 , respectively.
They are located on the common normal to the centrodes. Let en be the
unit vector directed from P1 toward Mp
2 . The radii of curvature ϱ1 and ϱ2
are deﬁned by expressing the vector from P1 to Mp
i
(i = 1, 2) in the form
ϱien . This means that always ϱ2 > 0 , whereas ϱ1 is positive or negative
depending on whether the two centrodes are curved toward the same side
or toward opposite sides. From (15.46) it is known that the acceleration a0
of the point ﬁxed in Σ2 and coinciding with P1 has the direction of en .
This acceleration remains unchanged if the centrodes are replaced by their
instantaneous circles of curvature. The reason is that acceleration as well as
curvature depend on ﬁrst- and second-order derivatives of position vectors
only, whereas the diﬀerence between curve and circle of curvature depends
on higher-order derivatives. Thus, a0 is the acceleration produced by the
rolling motion of the circle of curvature of k2 on the circle of curvature of
k1 . This acceleration is taken from (15.127) in the chapter on cycloids. For
the present purpose the notation has to be changed as follows. The radius r0
must be replaced by ϱ1 , r1 by ϱ2 and the angular velocity ˙ϕ1 by ˙ϕ . The

and Mp
2 is the same as the relationship between associated points M and Q
on the line en . Equation (15.75) establishes between ϱ1 , ϱ2 and the radii

When ϱ1 and ϱ2 are known, this equation determines the center of curvature
M for every point Q in the entire plane. Euler showed that this analytical
solution is equivalent to the following geometrical solution. Construct in Fig.
15.21 the point B as point of intersection of the line QMp
2 with the perpen-
dicular to e through P1 . Proposition: The center of curvature M lies at the
intersection of e and BMp

is introduced. Similar triangles yield
R
b = R −ϱ1 sin α
ϱ1 cos α
,
r
b = r −ϱ2 sin α
ϱ2 cos α
.
(15.91)
Elimination of b produces (15.90). End of proof. Note: Unlike (15.90), the
geometrical construction fails when Q and M are located on the normal en .
Example: Equation (15.90) and the alternative geometrical construction of
M are of particular interest in the case when the centrode k2 is materialized
as circular wheel rolling on the inside or outside of another circular wheel
k1 . Trajectories of points Q ﬁxed in the plane of k2 are called trochoids.
They are the subject of Sect. 15.5. For every position of Q the associated
center of curvature is determined. Consider, for example, the special case
when k1 is a straight line (a wheel of inﬁnite radius ϱ1 ) and when Q is
a point on the circumference of k2 . The trajectory is the cusped cycloid b
shown in Fig. 15.38 where the points Q and P1 are denoted C and P ,
respectively. In this case, the rule of construction in Fig. 15.21 shows that P
is the midpoint between the generating point C and the center of curvature
M . End of example.
Equation (15.89) shows that the normal poles P1 and P2 do not suﬃce for
determining ϱ1 and ϱ2 . In addition, also P3 must be known. An expression
for ϱ1 in terms of the coordinates of these three poles is found as follows.
The circle of curvature with radius ϱ1 has the equation x2 + y2 −2ϱ1y = 0 .
Hence ϱ1 ≡(x2 + y2)/(2y) and

(15.92)
For determining this limit value it is suﬃcient to formulate the Taylor expan-
sion of the centrode k1 , i.e., of the trajectory of P1 , in the neighborhood of
the origin. In complex notation this is the curve rP1(ϕ) . For convenience, it
is assumed that rP1(0) is the origin. Hence
rP1(ϕ) = rP1(0) + ϕ r′
P1(0) + 1
2 ϕ2 r′′
P1(0) + . . . .

15.3.5 Cubic of Stationary Curvature. Directrix
In Sect. 14.1.1 the curvature κ of a curve and vertices of a curve were deﬁned.
The vertex condition dκ/dϕ = 0 is Eq.(14.22):
2r′r′(r′r′′′ −r′r′′′) −3(r′r′′ −r′r′′)(r′r′′ + r′r′′) = 0 .
(15.97)
This equation determines all points r of a moving plane Σ2 which are mo-
mentarily at a vertex of their respective trajectories. Let x and y be the
coordinates of r in the x, y-system of Fig. 15.17: r = x+i y . For the deriva-
tives r′ , r ′′ and r′′′ Eqs.(15.59) are used: r(n) = in(r −rPn) (n = 1, 2, 3) .
For rPn
(n = 1, 2, 3) Eqs.(15.62) are substituted. This results in the expres-
sions
r′ = i (x+i y) ,
r′′ = −x−i (y−y2) ,
r′′′ = y−y3−i (x−x3) (15.98)
and

r′r′ = x2 + y2 ,

Because of the third-order terms the curve is referred to as cubic of station-
ary curvature. The equation is simplest in terms of polar coordinates r , α .
Substitution of x = r cos α , y = r sin α results in the explicit equation
r =
cos α sin α
λ cos α + μ sin α .
(15.103)
The stationarity condition dr/dα = 0 is tan3 α = λ/μ , and the stationary
value is rstat = (1/μ)[1 + (λ/μ)2/3]−3/2 = (1/λ)[1 + (μ/λ)2/3]−3/2 .
If the x, y-coordinates of two vertices are known, λ and μ are determined
by two linear Eqs.(15.101). Then also the coordinates of the normal pole P3
and the radii of curvature of the centrodes are known. Equations (15.102)
and (15.96) yield the expressions
x3 = 3y2
2μ ,
y3 = 3y2(1 −y2λ) ,

ϱ2 =

(15.105)
Taylor expansion of (15.101) about the origin starts with the second-order
term
−xy . From this it follows that the curve has a double point at the
origin, and that at the origin both the x-axis and the y-axis are tangents.
In the special case λ = 0 , μ ̸= 0 , the curve has the equation y[μ(x2 +
y2) −x] = 0 . It splits into the x-axis and a circle. Likewise, in the special
case μ = 0 , λ ̸= 0 , the curve has the equation
x[λ(x2 + y2) −y] = 0 .
It splits into the y-axis and a circle. The two circles with their centers at
( x = 1/(2μ) , y = 0 ) and ( x = 0 , y = 1/(2λ) ) , respectively, are the circles
of curvature of the curve at the double point.
Equation (15.101) of the curve is a special case of Eq.(14.53) deﬁning
Burmester’s pole curve. The geometrical reason is the following. Burmester’s
pole curve is the expression of relationships between centers of rotation de-
ﬁned by four discrete positions of a plane. The cubic of stationary curvature

is the expression of relationships between instantaneous centers of rotation
deﬁned by four inﬁnitesimally neighboring positions of a plane (at a vertex
a trajectory is contacting the curve in – at least – four inﬁnitesimally close
neighboring points; it is contacting its circle of curvature in at least three
points). In Sect. 14.5 properties of Burmester’s pole curve were investigated
(see (14.53) – (14.63)). The curve has an asymptote. The asymptote has the
slope −λ/μ . It intersects the curve at a single point H called cardinal point.
Another characteristic point is the focus Φ . The tangent to the curve in Φ
passes through H . For the cubic of stationary curvature with Eq.(15.101)
the following special formulas are obtained5. The equation of the asymptote
parallel to the line λx + μy = 0 is
λx + μy +
λμ
λ2 + μ2 = 0 .

From these equations it follows that P1 lies halfway between the asymptote
and the line parallel to the asymptote and passing through Φ .
Example: The coupler of the four-bar mechanism shown in Fig. 15.19 is
considered again. The points Q1 and Q2 are both vertices because every
point of a circular trajectory is a vertex. Hence the x, y-coordinates of these
points determine the parameters λ and μ , the cubic of stationary curvature,
its asymptote, the normal pole P3 , the radii of curvature of the centrodes
and the points H and Φ of the coupler in the instantaneous position shown.
In Fig. 15.22 the cubic of stationary curvature, its asymptote and the points
H and Φ are shown together with various other lines and points which are
explained later. End of example.
Directrix of the Cubic of Stationary Curvature
In Fig. 15.23 the x, y-system with origin P1 is the same as in previous ﬁgures.
Let ˆQ be an arbitrary point (not yet conﬁned to the straight line referred
to as directrix). The diagonal in the rectangle deﬁned by the axes and by
the lines parallel to the axes and the perpendicular from the origin onto this
diagonal deﬁne the point Q . Through this construction every point ˆQ is

directrix, asymptote, focus Φ , cardinal point H and Ball’s point U of the coupler
mapped into a uniquely deﬁned point Q . Points ˆQ on the x-axis and/or on
the y-axis are mapped into the origin P1 . The inverse mapping of Q into ˆQ
is determined by drawing through Q the perpendicular to the line joining Q
with P1 . This rule of construction fails if Q is a point on the x-axis and/or
on the y-axis. The geometrical rules for constructing Q from ˆQ and vice
versa are expressed analytically as follows. Let ˆx and ˆy be the coordinates
of ˆQ and x and y be the coordinates of Q . The two lines intersecting at
Q have the equations y/ˆy + x/ˆx = 1 and y/x = ˆx/ˆy . Resolving once for
x and y and once for ˆx and ˆy results in the equations
x = ˆy

(15.109)
Through these equations it is reconﬁrmed that every point ˆQ is mapped into
a uniquely deﬁned point Q , and that the inverse mapping from Q into ˆQ
is uniquely deﬁned for all points Q except points on the x-axis and/or on
the y-axis. From (15.108) it follows that

(15.111)
Hence the conclusion: If ˆQ is located on the line μˆx + λˆy −1 = 0 , Q is
located on the cubic of stationary curvature. Thus, this line is mapped into
the cubic of stationary curvature by means of the construction shown in Fig.
15.23 and also by means of (15.108). The line is called directrix of the cubic
of stationary curvature. It intersects the x-axis at x = 1/μ and the y-axis at
y = 1/λ . These two points of intersection are mapped into the double point
x = y = 0 of the cubic of stationary curvature.
From Eqs.(15.107) for the coordinates of H and Φ it follows that the line
P1H is parallel to the directrix and that, furthermore, Φ is the midpoint of
the perpendicular from the origin P1 onto the directrix. Equations (15.109)
map H and Φ into points ˆH and ˆΦ , respectively, on the directrix. These
points have the coordinates

with the x- and y-axes. In Fig. 15.22 ˆΦ and lines for the construction of ˆQ1
and ˆQ2 from Q1 and Q2 , respectively, according to Fig. 15.23 are shown.

15.3.6 Ball’s Point
The cubic of stationary curvature intersects the inﬂection circle at the pole
P1 and at one more point. This point is called Ball’s point, denoted U . The
trajectory of the point of Σ2 coinciding with U has at this point not only
zero curvature, but also zero rate of change of curvature. It is, therefore, a
good straight-line approximation of its tangent UP2 . The coordinates of U
are determined as follows. The inﬂection circle has the equation (see (15.46))
x2 + y2 −y2y = 0 .
(15.113)
Combination with (15.100) for the cubic of stationary curvature produces the
equation y2y(−y3x + x3y) = 0 . The solution y = 0 belongs to the pole P1 .
The second solution yields for the coordinates of U the ratio yU/xU = y3/x3 .
This shows that U is located on the line P1P3 . Substitution of yU = xUy3/x3
into (15.113) yields an expression for xU . The coordinates are
xU = x3
y2y3
x2
3 + y2

yU = y3
y2y3

(15.114)
By substituting for x3 and y3 the expressions (15.104) the coordinates are
expressed in terms of y2 , λ and μ :
xU = y2
μy2(1 −λy2)
(1 −λy2)2 + μ2y2
2
,
yU = y2
(1 −λy2)2
(1 −λy2)2 + μ2y2
2
.
(15.115)
With the expressions (15.114) Eqs.(15.109) determine the coordinates of the
associated point ˆU on the directrix. It turns out that ˆyU = y2 . This means
that ˆU is the point of intersection of the directrix with the tangent to the
inﬂection circle at the pole P2 . From this point ˆU Ball’s point U can be
constructed following the rules of Fig. 15.23. In Fig. 15.22 ˆU and U and the
geometrical construction are shown. Remark: That the asymptote intersects
the x-axis at the point x = xˆ
U is a peculiarity of this example. Normally,
this is not the case.
At the beginning it was said that the trajectory of the point of Σ2 coincid-
ing with Ball’s point U is a good straight-line approximation of its tangent
UP2 . In engineering, straight-line approximations are required for many pur-
poses. So-called level-luﬃng jib cranes, for example, are large-size four-bars
maneuvering the load-lifting hook. The pulley for the hook-carrying rope is
attached to the coupler at a point which is Ball’s point when the crane is
halfway between its extremal positions. The parameters of the four-bar are
chosen such that the almost straight trajectory is horizontal. This arrange-
ment has the eﬀect that a load is carried in good approximation horizontally
when the crane is operating with constant length of the rope. Details see in
Dijksman [8].

15.4 Holditch’s Theorem
493
15.4 Holditch’s Theorem
In a reference plane Σ a closed curve k is given (Fig. 15.24a ). The curve
may be either convex or nonconvex. It is free of double points. It may have
straight-line segments and a ﬁnite number of corners. A rod (a line segment)
of length 2ℓis guided with its endpoints C1 and C2 on k . Provided ℓis
suﬃciently small a periodic motion is possible such that per period the rod
is rotated through 2π counterclockwise (this sense of rotation is arbitrarily
chosen) and that at the end of the period C1 and C2 are back in their initial
positions. In the course of this motion both C1 and C2 trace the entire curve
k . In what follows, this motion is investigated. Taking the nonconvex curve
and the rod in Fig. 15.24a as example, the following statements can be made.
The periodic motion is, in general, not possible without reversing several
times (more precisely an even number of times)
- the sense of direction of motion of C1 and C2 along k
- the sense of rotation of the rod.
Uniform sense of rotation is possible if and only if k is convex. Uniform sense
of direction of motion of C1 and C2 is, in general, impossible even if k is
convex.
Let rC be the vector pointing from some reference point 0 ﬁxed in Σ
to the midpoint C of the rod and let, furthermore, ϱ be the vector from
C to C1 . Then r(t) = rC(t) + λϱ(t) ( λ arbitrary) is the time-dependent
position vector of the point denoted P(λ) on the line passing through C1
and C2 . In the course of the said periodic motion every point P(λ) traces
a closed trajectory. In Fig. 15.24b the trajectories of P(0) (point C) and of
P(λ =
√
2) are shown. The curve k itself is the trajectory of both P(1) = C1
and of P(−1) = C2 .

In Fig. 15.24a the shaded areal element dA enclosed by the position
vector r and by the path element dr is shown. It is expressed in the form
dA = 1
2 e · r × dr where e is the unit vector normal to the plane (sense of
direction as indicated). Areal elements can be positive, zero or negative. Let
A(λ) be the area enclosed by the trajectory of P(λ). It is the line integral

(15.116)
The term free of λ represents the area A(0) enclosed by the trajectory of
C . The coeﬃcient of λ2 is the area πℓ2 of the circle having the rod length
2ℓas diameter. The coeﬃcient of λ is the diﬀerence
1
2[A(1) −A(−1)] . It is
zero because A(1) as well as A(−1) is the area enclosed by k . Hence
A(λ) = A(0) + λ2πℓ2 .
(15.117)
Subtraction of the same equation for the special case λ = 1 results in
A(λ) −A(1) = (λ2 −1)πℓ2 .
(15.118)
This equation is Holditch’s [15] famous6
Theorem 15.7. The diﬀerence of the areas enclosed by the trajectory of
P(λ) and by k is, independent of the shape of k , (λ2 −1) times the area
πℓ2 of the circle having the rod length 2ℓas diameter.
Example: For the trajectories with λ = 0 and λ =
√
2 shown Fig. 15.24b
the diﬀerence of areas is the same, namely, πℓ2 .
If k is convex, trajectories of points with |λ| < 1 are inside of k or on
k , and trajectories of points with |λ| > 1 are outside of k or on k .
If the shape of k is such that in some section of motion C1 and C2 are
guided on nonparallel straight lines, the trajectories of all points P(λ) in this
section are segments of ellipses (see the elliptic trammel in Sect. 15.1.2). This
case is illustrated in Fig. 15.25a . The curve k is an equilateral triangle, and
the length 2ℓof the rod is smaller than the altitude of the triangle. The
trajectory of the midpoint C=P(0) is composed of three congruent elliptic
segments and of three straight-line segments. Arrows indicate the sense of
6 Holditch’s brief communication (less than a single page) seems to indicate that only
convex curves k and points with |λ| ≤1 are considered. These restrictions are unnecessary.
The theorem is one out of very few global statements about curves (global in contrast to
local statements of diﬀerential geometry). For this reason Giering [12] speaks of a jewel
of geometry. Generalizations of the theorem see in Schoenﬂies/Gr¨ubler [26], Hoschek [16],
Hering [13] and Feldhoﬀ[10]

direction of motion of P(0). These arrows show that the area A(0) enclosed
by the trajectory of P(0) is calculated from the partial areas denoted A1 , A2
and A3 according to the formula A(0) = A3 −A2 −2A1 .
The vertices of the triangle are the centers of the ellipses. Point C is at
a vertex of an ellipse when the rod is either parallel to or orthogonal to an
altitude of the triangle. These two positions yield for the semi major axes a
and b of the ellipses the formulas a = 3
4Lc , b = a/3 where L is the side
length of the triangle and c (arbitrary) is the ratio c = 2ℓ/h (rod length
divided by the altitude of the triangle).
In Fig. 15.25b the curve k is the same triangle. The rod length equals
the altitude of the triangle ( c = 1 ) . This is the maximum possible length.
At the points of contact the elliptic segments have equal tangents and equal
curvature. The rod may be guided along k such that P(0) traces the tra-
jectory in the way shown in Fig. 15.25a . However, the rod may also be
guided such that its endpoints C1 and C2 move along k without revers-
ing the sense of direction. In this case, P(0) is tracing twice per period
the oval formed by the three elliptic segments (see the arrows). From this
it follows that the two areas denoted A2 and A3 are identical and that,
furthermore, A(0) = −2A1 = A(1) −πℓ2 . With the side length L of the
triangle
A(1) = L2√
3/4 and
ℓ= L
√
3/4 . Hence the area of the oval is
A1 =

15.5 Trochoids
Trochoids are trajectories of points C ﬁxed on a planetary wheel 1 which
is rolling on a stationary sunwheel 0 . In Figs. 15.26 and 15.27 all possible
arrangements of wheels are shown. In Fig. 15.26 the wheels are touching each

496
15 Plane Motion
Fig. 15.26 Wheels touching each other from the outside. For the straight-line position
shown the parameters are r0 = −3 , r1 = 2 , b = 4
Fig. 15.27 Wheel 1 inside wheel 0 . For the straight-line position shown the parameters
are r0 = 5 , r1 = 2 , b = 1 . In the small ﬁgure wheel 0 is inside wheel 1
other from the outside, and in Fig. 15.27 one wheel is inside the other. The
one inside may be either wheel 1 or wheel 0 (see the small ﬁgure). The point
C ﬁxed on wheel 1 is located at a radius which is either smaller than or equal
to or larger than the radius of wheel 1 . Depending on the arrangement of
the wheels and on the location of C on wheel 1 trochoids come in many
diﬀerent shapes. This makes them interesting for engineering applications.
Mathematical investigations of trochoids started very early because of their
role in the explanation of orbits of solar planets by cycles and epicycles (de
la Hire [14], J. Bernoulli). The crank 2 connecting the centers of the wheels
has no inﬂuence on the shape of trochoids. Its only purpose is to keep the
wheels in touch and to make wheel 1 rolling.
The curvature of trochoids was the subject of the example illustrating Fig.
15.21.

15.5 Trochoids
497
From the elliptic trammel in Fig. 15.4 the following results are known
about wheels having the ratio 1 : 2 of radii with the small wheel being inside
the larger wheel. If the small wheel is the planetary wheel 1 , trochoids are
diameters of wheel 0 if C is located on the circumference of wheel 1 and
ellipses otherwise. If the large wheel is the planetary wheel 1 , trochoids are
lima¸cons of Pascal (Fig. 15.8).
15.5.1 Basic Equations in Complex Notation
Three parameters suﬃce if the radii r0 and r1 of the wheels and the radius
b of point C on wheel 1 are deﬁned as quantities which may be positive or
negative. These deﬁnitions are given next. In Figs. 15.26 and 15.27 the poles
P20 , P12 and P10 are shown. The tangent to the trochoid is the normal to the
line P10C . The position of C is speciﬁed by the complex number z in the
complex plane with origin P20 . A system has several, possibly even inﬁnitely
many so-called straight-line positions. In these positions the three poles and
the point C are located on a single line. The real axis of the complex plane
is placed along the line of an arbitrarily chosen straight-line position. In the
chosen position the signs of the scalar parameters r0 , r1 and b are deﬁned
as follows:
r0 > 0 ( r0 < 0 )
if P20 lies to the right (to the left) of P10 ,
r1 > 0 ( r1 < 0 )
if P12 lies to the right (to the left) of P10 ,
b > 0 ( b < 0 )
if C lies to the right (to the left) of P12 .
The rotation angles ϕ1 of wheel 1 and ϕ2 of crank 2 relative to frame 0 are
zero in the straight-line position and positive counterclockwise. The parame-
ters belonging to Figs. 15.26 and 15.27 are given in the ﬁgure headings. With
parameters and variables thus deﬁned the complex number z representing
C is always
z = (r1 −r0)ei ϕ2 + bei ϕ1 .
(15.119)
The angular ratio ϕ1/ϕ2 is constant and, consequently, identical with the
angular velocity ratio ˙ϕ1/ ˙ϕ2 . According to (15.6) the ratio is
ϕ1
ϕ2
= ˙ϕ1
˙ϕ2
= r1 −r0
r1
.
(15.120)
The angular velocities themselves need not be constant. Trochoids are closed
(nonclosed) curves if the ratio ϕ1/ϕ2 = (r1 −r0)/r1 is a rational number (an
irrational number, respectively). In gears with teeth the ratio is rational.
Equation (15.119) is diﬀerentiated twice with respect to time. In combi-
nation with (15.120) this yields for the velocity and the acceleration of the
generating point C the complex expressions

Imagine that in the mechanism of Figs. 15.26 or 15.27 the crank is mak-
ing a single 2π-rotation so that its ﬁnal position coincides with its initial
position. Then also the circle of wheel 1 is the same in the ﬁnal and in the
initial position. However, wheel 1 is rotated in this process through the an-
gle
Δϕ1 = 2π(r1 −r0)/r1 . If (r1 −r0)/r1 is not an integer number, C
assumes a new position C1 . From this it follows that two points of wheel
1 on the same radius b and displaced by the angle Δϕ1 trace one and the
same trochoid. For the same reason all points C1 , C2 etc. with equal angular
displacements Δϕ1 trace one and the same trochoid. For a closed trochoid
there exists a minimal integer number ν such that νΔϕ1 is an integer mul-
tiple of 2π . The points C , C1 ,. . . , Cν on wheel 1 form a regular polygon
all vertices of which trace one and the same trochoid. This fact is made use
of in the Wankel engine (see Fig. 15.28). The mechanism in this ﬁgure has
the parameters r0 = 2 and r1 = 3 . They yield Δϕ1 = 1
3 2π . The polygon is
an equilateral triangle. This triangle represents the rotating piston. Between
piston and trochoid three chambers are created the volumes of which are pe-
riodically changing when the crank is rotating. The trochoid itself depends on
the additional free parameter b . In Fig. 15.28 b = 9 is chosen. In a Wankel
engine the three sides of the piston are not straight lines, but curves shaped
in such a way that the ratio of minimum and maximum chamber volumes is
as small as possible. The optimal curve is described by Wunderlich [30].

trace the trochoid with parameters r0 = 2 , r1 = 3 , b = 9

15.5.2 Double Generation of Trochoids
The trochoid of a mechanism with parameters r0 , r1 , b is generated by an-
other mechanism having the same center P20 , but diﬀerent parameters r∗
0 , r∗
1
and b∗(Philippe de la Hire [14]). This double generation has interesting engi-
neering applications. The complex number z in (15.119) remains unchanged
if the new parameters satisfy the conditions
r∗
1 −r∗
0 = b ,
b∗= r1 −r0 ,
ϕ∗
2 = ϕ1 ,
ϕ∗
1 = ϕ2 .
(15.123)
From the last two conditions it follows that ϕ∗
2/ϕ∗
1 = ϕ1/ϕ2 and with this

In Figs. 15.29 and 15.30 the solid lines show again the mechanisms of Figs.
15.26 and 15.27, respectively. The second mechanism is found graphically as
follows (see Fig. 15.29). The centers P∗
20 of wheel 0∗and P20 of wheel 0
coalesce. The dashed lines parallel to the lines P20P12 and P12C form the
parallelogram with the corner P∗
12 opposite P12 . The point P∗
12 is the center
of wheel 1∗. The pole P∗
10 is determined by the fact that it is on the line
P∗
12P20 as well as on the normal P10C to the tangent of the trochoid. The
poles P20 , P∗
10 and P∗
12 determine the positions of the wheels 0∗and 1∗. The
parallelogram is seen to accomplish the interchange of angles as is prescribed
by the last two Eqs.(15.123). In the case of opposite signs of ϕ2 and ϕ1
(Fig. 15.30), interchanging the angles has the eﬀect that the cranks of the
two generating mechanisms must be rotated in opposite directions in order
to trace the trochoid in the same sense.
The two generating mechanisms have some properties in common. By other
properties they can be distinguished. First, a distinguishing property. If P20
is outside the circle of wheel 1 in one generation, P20 is inside the circle of
wheel 1 in the other generation (see Figs. 15.29 and 15.30). By convention,
the generation with P20 outside the circle of wheel 1 is called ﬁrst genera-
tion. Next, a property common to both generating mechanisms. Wheel 0 is

touched by wheel 1 either in both mechanisms from the outside (Fig. 15.29)
or in both mechanisms from the inside (Fig. 15.30). Trochoids generated by
mechanisms of the former type are called epitrochoids, and trochoids gener-
ated by mechanisms of the latter type are called hypotrochoids. Epitrochoids
and hypotrochoids alike are divided into three families:
1. Trochoids have double points if in the ﬁrst generation the generating point
C is outside the circle of wheel 1 , i.e., if |b/r1| > 1 . Such trochoids are called
curtate trochoids (Fig. 15.26 and the lima¸con of Pascal in Fig. 15.8a ).
2. Trochoids have cusps on the circumference of wheel 1 if the generating
point C is located on the circumference of wheel 1 (in both generations;
|b/r1| = 1 ). Such trochoids are called cycloids (either epicycloids or hypocy-
cloids).
3. Trochoids have neither double points nor cusps if in the ﬁrst generation
point C is inside of wheel 1 , i.e., if |b/r1| < 1 . Such trochoids are called
prolate trochoids (Fig. 15.28 and the lima¸cons of Pascal in Figs. 15.8c,d ).
Example: In the system shown in Fig. 15.31 with parameters r0 > r1 >
0 the trajectory of C is a hypocycloid. Wheel 1 is rotating with angular
velocity ˙ϕ1 = const. Determine in the position shown ( C in the cusp of the
cycloid) the acceleration a0 of C and for an arbitrary position the velocity
v .
Solution: In (15.121) and (15.122) the substitution b = −r1 is made. In the
position ϕ1 = ϕ2 = 0 the acceleration is

˙ϕ1 is the distance of C from the
instantaneous center of velocity P10 . The maximum velocity occurs in the
vertices of the trajectory: vmax = 2r1 ˙ϕ1 . End of example.
15.5.3 Cycloids
Both generating mechanisms of a cycloid share the same sunwheel 0 and,
furthermore, cusps occur on the sunwheel. An example is the cardioid shown
in Fig. 15.8b . It is an epitrochoid with the two generations according to Fig.
15.32. Hypocycloids of particular interest are Steiner’s hypocycloid in Fig.
15.33b and the astroid in Fig. 15.33c . A special case belonging to this family
is the system shown in Fig. 15.33a . It is known from the elliptic trammel.
This particular hypocycloid is a diameter of the sunwheel.
Equation (15.119) for the astroid is simplest when as straight-line position
ϕ1 = ϕ2 = 0 not the position shown in Fig. 15.33c is chosen, but the position
when P10 is a cusp of the astroid. Then r1 = 1

z = −3

= −r0 (cos3 ϕ2 + i sin3 ϕ2) .

(c) )
In Fig. 15.34a three circles 1 , s1 and s2 with radii r , nr and (n+1)r ,
respectively, (n ≥2 integer) are one inside the other with a common contact
point Q . In the example shown, n = 3 . Circle s2 is held ﬁxed. When circle
1 rolls inside
s1 , an arbitrarily chosen point P on the circumference traces
a hypocycloid z1 with n cusps on
s1 . Similarly, when circle 1 rolls inside
s2 , the same point P traces a hypocycloid z2 with n + 1 cusps on
s2 (in
the example shown, z1 is Steiner’s hypocycloid and z2 is an astroid). The
hypocycloid z2 is ﬁxed on the ﬁxed circle s2 . Both cycloids have the common
tangent t normal to QP. According to (15.125) the second generation of z2
has the same sunwheel s2 and an inner planetary wheel with radius nr .
This is the radius of
s1 . Thus, the rolling of
s1 inside
s2 represents the
second generation of z2 . In this second generation of z2 all cusps of z1 move
along z2 , and in every position z1 and z2 are co-tangential at one point.
The centers 01 of
s1 and 02 of
s2 , at the distance r from each other,
are the poles P12 and P20, respectively, of crank 2 . Equation (15.120) yields
˙ϕ1/ ˙ϕ2 = 1/n .
In Fig. 15.34b the special case n = 2 is shown. In this case, the hypocy-
cloid z1 is a diameter of s1 having the length 4r , and z2 is Steiner’s hypocy-
cloid with radius 3r of the sunwheel s2 . In the second generation of z2 ( s1
rolling inside s2 ) the endpoints of the diameter move along z2 . During this

15.5 Trochoids
503
Fig. 15.34 Rolling of circle 1 (radius r ) inside circles s1 (radius nr ) and s2 (radius
(n + 1)r ) produces hypocycloids z1 and z2 , respectively. When s1 rolls in s2 , the cusps
of z1 are guided along z2 , and both hypocycloids are continuously in tangential contact.
Cases n = 3 (a) and n = 2 (b)
motion the diameter is always in tangential contact with z2 and, conse-
quently, inside z2 . In other words: The diameter of length 4r can be rotated
full circle inside Steiner’s hypocycloid with a sunwheel of radius 3r . For a
long time it was believed that this hypocycloid represents the smallest area
inside of which a line segment of length 4r can be rotated full circle. Besicov-
itch [2] showed, however, that this is possible inside arbitrarily small areas.
These areas consist of intricately branching subdomains.
The area enclosed by Steiner’s hypocycloid is calculated from Holditch’s
Eq.(15.117), A(λ) = A(0) + λ2πℓ2 , with ℓ= 2r and λ = 1 and with the
area A(0) enclosed by the midpoint of the line segment. The trajectory of this
midpoint is the circle of radius r inscribed in Steiner’s hypocycloid. When
the line segment is rotating once counterclockwise, the midpoint traces this
circle twice clockwise. Therefore, A(0) = −2πr2 . Hence the area enclosed by
the cycloid is A(1) = 2πr2 , i.e., twice the area of the inscribed circle. Every
point ﬁxed on the line segment traces a trochoid. With the pertinent value
of λ the formula yields the area enclosed by this trochoid.
Now back to the general case with n > 2 . The motion of cycloid z1
inside z2 is creating n chambers of periodically changing volumes. This
phenomenon has found engineering applications. If the crank is driven by
a motor, the chambers can be used for pumping ﬂuid. By controlling the
pressure inside the chambers by means of a rotating distribution valve z1 ,
the crank can be driven (the crank rotating n times as fast as z1). The

systems shown in Figs. 15.34a and b are special cases of cycloidal gearings.
For additional material on this subject see Sec. 16.1.2.
Consider the cycloid z1 in Fig. 15.35. It is the trajectory of the point C
ﬁxed on wheel 1 rolling on wheel 0 . This generating system is referred to as
system r0, r1 . As straight-line position with angles ϕ1 = ϕ2 = 0 the position
is chosen when C is located at the vertex C0 of z1 . Then the parameters
are r0 < 0 and r1 > 0 . The circle on which C0 is located is called circle
of vertices. Its radius is 2r1 −r0 . The line P10C is the normal n to z1 at
C . The tangent t passes through the point P∗
12 common to wheel 1 and to
the circle of vertices (wheel 1 is Thales’ circle in the right-angled triangle
(P10,C,P∗
12)). The rotation angle ϕ1 of wheel 1 is (see (15.120))
ϕ1 = r1 −r0
r1
ϕ2 .
(15.130)
The angle ∢(CP12P∗
12) is seen to be ϕ1 −ϕ2 , whence it follows that
∢(CP10P∗
12) =
1
2(ϕ1 −ϕ2) (theorem on angles subtended by the chord
CP

12 ) . The angle of rotation of the normal n as well as of the tangent
t from their positions in the straight-line position is α = 1
2(ϕ1 −ϕ2) + ϕ2 =
1
2(ϕ1 + ϕ2) or, with (15.130),
α = 2r1 −r0
2r1
ϕ2 .
(15.131)
Comparison with (15.130) shows that this is the rotation angle of a wheel
with radius 2r1 instead of r1 rolling on the same sunwheel 0 . In the ﬁgure
this wheel is shown in the position α as dashed line. The tangent t is a
diameter ﬁxed on this wheel. These results are summarized in

Theorem 15.8. A cycloid generated as point trajectory in a system r0, r1 is
enveloped by a diameter ﬁxed on the planetary wheel in the system r0, 2r1
Consider the special case r0 = −2r1 shown in Fig. 15.36. The circle of vertices
has the radius R = 2|r0| . The epicycloid has two cusps. From Fig. 15.35 the
general formula β = ∢(P10P∗
12C)= 1
2π −1
2(ϕ1 −ϕ2) is known. In the special
case under consideration, this becomes β = 1
2π −ϕ2 . In Fig. 15.36 it is seen
that β is also the angle between the line P20P
∗
12 and the perpendicular s
to the line P20C0 . A light beam having the direction of s is reﬂected on the
circle of vertices in the direction of the tangent to the cycloid. This explains
a phenomenon which can be observed in a cup of coﬀee in early-morning
sunshine. Parallel sun rays are reﬂected on the inner wall of the cup (circle
of vertices of radius R ). The reﬂected rays envelope an epicycloid with two
cusps on the circle of radius R/2 . In the vicinity of one cusp the cycloid is
clearly visible.
Fig. 15.36 Generation of a two-cusped epicycloid by means of reﬂected light
As another special case Steiner’s hypocycloid of Fig. 15.33b is consid-
ered. The ﬁrst generating system is the system r0, 1
3r0 . According to the
theorem the cycloid is enveloped by a diameter ﬁxed on the planetary wheel
in the system r0, 2
3r0 . This system is also the second generating system of
the same cycloid. In other words: The endpoints of the enveloping diameter
of the planetary wheel in the second generation are tracing the cycloid. This
property is known already from Fig. 15.34b . Steiner’s hypocycloid is the only
hypocycloid having this property.
Next, the evolute of the cycloid z1 in Fig. 15.35 is determined. Let it be
called z2 . By deﬁnition, z2 is the curve which is enveloped by the normal n
of z1 . The following facts are obvious:
1. n is tangent to z2 ; n is passing through P10 which is located on the
circle with radius r0
2. t is tangent to z1 ; t is passing through P∗
12 which is located on the circle
with radius 2r1 −r0

506
15 Plane Motion
3. P20P10 is collinear with P20P
∗
12 ; both n and t are rotating with ˙α ; n
is orthogonal to t .
A direct consequence of these facts is
Theorem 15.9. (Bernoulli, de la Hire)7 The evolute of a cycloid z1 in the
system r0, r1 is another similar cycloid z2 , which is the trajectory of a point
in the new system
pr0, pr1 with p = r0/(2r1 −r0) . The circle of vertices
in the new system is identical with the circle of the sunwheel in the initial
system. The vertices of the evolute z2 coalesce with the cusps of z1 .
Figure 15.35 shows the evolute z2 and in dashed lines the wheels of the
new system. Further properties of cycloids and of trochoids in general are
found in Wunderlich [30] and Strubecker [28]. Higher-order trochoids were
investigated by Wunderlich [29].
15.5.4 Ordinary Cycloids
An ordinary cycloid8 is the trajectory of an arbitrary point (not just a cir-
cumferential point) ﬁxed on a circular wheel which is rolling along a straight
line. This is the situation when in Fig. 15.26 r0 is inﬁnite. In what follows,
the notation shown in Fig. 15.37 is used. The radii of the circle and of point C
are denoted r and b respectively ( r, b > 0 ). The angle of roll of the circle is
ϕ (positive clockwise). The position ϕ = 0 is deﬁned to be the position when
the center as well as point C is on the imaginary axis with C being below
the center of the circle. In this position these two points have the complex
numbers i r and z = i (r −b) , respectively. In the position ϕ (arbitrary)
the numbers are rϕ + i r and

respectively. This yields for the x, y-coordinates of C and for their time
derivatives the expressions

y = r −b cos ϕ ,
˙x = ˙ϕ(r −b cos ϕ) ,
˙y = ˙ϕb sin ϕ ,

¨y = b( ¨ϕ sin ϕ + ˙ϕ2 cos ϕ) .

(15.133)
Depending on whether b < r or b = r or b > r ordinary cycloids are either
curtate or cusped or prolate (Fig. 15.38). By the conventions of Sect. 15.5.2
only the cusped cycloids should be called cycloids. The indiscriminate name
ordinary cycloid is much older than this convention. The cusped ordinary
cycloid has in the cusps the acceleration coordinates
¨x = 0 ,
¨y = r ˙ϕ2 .
(15.134)
Another property was shown in the example illustrating Fig. 15.21: In every
position ϕ the point of rolling P is midpoint between the generating point
C and the center of curvature M .
15.5.5 Involute of a Circle
The inverse motion of a circle rolling along a straight line is the rolling of a
straight line g on a ﬁxed circle k of radius r0 . This is the situation when in
Fig. 15.26 r1 is inﬁnite. In Fig. 15.39 the line g is tangent to k at point A .
To be investigated are the trajectories traced by the point B ﬁxed on g and
by the point P rigidly attached to g at the distance h on the perpendicular

15 Plane Motion
through B . In the case h < 0 , P is located on the other side of g , i.e., on
the side toward the circle k .
First, the trajectory of B . It is an epicycloid. Point A is the instantaneous
center of rotation of g and, therefore, the center of curvature of the trajectory
of B . The trajectory is, therefore, the involute of k , and k is called base
circle of the involute. The segment AB may be interpreted as part of a string
which is winding oﬀthe circle k . Figure 15.39 shows that the following facts
are true
- every normal to the involute is tangent to k and vice versa
- the involute has a cusp B0 on k . It is symmetric with respect to the diameter
of k through B0
- the line segment AB which is the radius of curvature of the involute at B
equals the length of the arc AB0 of k . It is r0φ . The element of the arc
length of the involute is, therefore, ds = r0φ dφ and the arc length itself is
s = r0φ2/2 (s = 0 at B0)
- in terms of the angle ψ as parameter B has the polar coordinates (note
that ϕ + ψ = φ = tan ψ )
ρ(ψ) =
r0
cos ψ ,
ϕ(ψ) = inv ψ
(15.135)
with the involute function deﬁned as
inv ψ = tan ψ −ψ
(15.136)
- involutes of base circles with diﬀerent radii r0 are geometrically similar
- involutes on one and the same base circle, i.e., trajectories of diﬀerent points
B1 , B2 , . . . ﬁxed on g are parallel curves.
Next, the trajectory of P is investigated. It is an epitrochoid. This time,
cartesian coordinates in the special x, y-system shown and polar coordinates
ρ, ϕ are expressed not as functions of the angle ψ , but of φ . With AB = r0φ
the coordinates are
x = −(r0 + h) sin φ + r0φ cos φ ,
ρ =

⎬
⎭
(15.137)
The coordinate x(φ) is an odd function of φ , and y(φ) is an even function of
φ . From this it follows that the y-axis is an axis of symmetry. The tangent
to the trajectory at P is normal to the line AP . In the special case h = 0 ,
the curve is the involute with the polar coordinates (15.135). Another special
case is h = −r0 ( P is at the center 0 of the circle in the position φ = 0 ).
In this case, the equations are ρ = r0φ and ϕ = φ −π/2 . These are the
equations of Archimedes’ spiral.
The coordinate x is zero if φ satisﬁes the equation φ = [(r0+h)/r0] tan φ .
This equation has the solution φ = 0 and one more solution if h < 0 . These

15.5 Trochoids
509
curves have a double point on the axis of symmetry. They are curtate, and
those with h > 0 (without double point) are prolate.
15.5.6 Dwell Mechanisms Based on Cycloids
In the mechanism shown in Fig. 15.40 the crank 2 causes the planetary wheel
1 (radius r ) to roll inside the sunwheel 0 (radius R ). In the position ϕ = 0
point A lies on the x-axis at xA = R −2r . Rod 3 (length ℓ) connects
A to the slider 4 . The ﬁgure shows the case R/r = 3 . In what follows, the
general case R/r = n ( n ≥3 ; integer) is investigated. In the interval −ϕ0 ≤
ϕ ≤+ϕ0 with ϕ0 = π/n the hypocycloid traced by A is a rather good
approximation of a circular arc. For this reason it is possible to render the
ratio ξ(λ, ϕ) = xB(λ, ϕ)/r in the interval −ϕ0 ≤ϕ ≤+ϕ0 approximately
constant provided the ratio λ = ℓ/r is chosen appropriately. The mechanism
can then be used as dwell mechanism with a single dwell per revolution of
crank 2 . An appropriate value λ1 is obtained if ℓis the radius of curvature
ϱ of the hypocycloid at the point ϕ = 0 . Another appropriate value λ2
is obtained from the condition ξ(λ2, 0) = ξ(λ2, ϕ0) . To be determined are
λ1 and λ2 as functions of n . The optimal value λ0 is obtained from the
condition that the diﬀerence between the absolute maximum and the absolute
minimum of the function ξ(λ, ϕ) in the interval −ϕ0 ≤ϕ ≤+ϕ0 is minimal.
This is Tshebychev’s criterion of optimality. Determine λ0 and the minimal
diﬀerence in the cases n = 3 and n = 4 .
Solution: Figure 15.40 shows the poles P10 , P20 and P12 . With these poles
(15.6) yields the angular velocity ratio
ω10/ω20 = −(n −1) . This is
Eq.(15.120). This ratio yields for the angle of rotation α of wheel 1 rel-

The radius of curvature is ϱ = 1/κ . For the radius of curvature of the

From the values for ϕ = 0 the desired ratio λ1 is found:

(15.142)
For determining λ2 the relations are used
sin(n−1)ϕ0 = sin(π−π/n) = sin ϕ0 ,
cos(n−1)ϕ0 = −cos ϕ0 . (15.143)
With these relations the conditional equation ξ(λ2, 0) = ξ(λ2, ϕ0) for λ2
takes the form
n −2 + λ2 = n cos ϕ0 +

Squaring produces a linear equation with the solution

.
(15.145)
Next, the optimal ratio λ0 is determined and for this purpose the absolute
maximum and the absolute minimum of the function ξ(λ, ϕ) in the interval
0 ≤ϕ ≤ϕ0 with λ being a constant parameter. First, all angles ϕ in the
interval 0 ≤ϕ ≤ϕ0 are determined for which ξ(λ, ϕ) attains stationary
values. These angles are the roots of the equation ∂ξ/∂ϕ = 0 . With (15.139)
this is the equation

It has the root ϕ1 = 0 and also the root ϕ2 = ϕ0 since because of (15.143)
the ﬁrst and the second term in brackets are both zero for ϕ = ϕ0 . From this
it follows that for λ = const (arbitrary) the function ξ(λ, ϕ) has stationary
values at ϕ = 0 and at ϕ = ϕ0 . These stationary values as functions of λ
are denoted ξs1(λ) and ξs2(λ) . Equation (15.144) yields

For λ = λ2 these stationary values are identical, namely,
ξs1(λ2) = ξs2(λ2) =

1 −n sin2 ϕ0/2 .
(15.148)
From this identity it follows that (15.146) has at least one more root in the
interval 0 ≤ϕ ≤ϕ0 provided λ satisﬁes certain conditions. Further progress
at this point is possible only if the integer n is speciﬁed.
Special case n = 3 (ϕ0 = 60◦): Equations (15.142) and (15.145) yield λ1 =
8 and λ2 = 7 . With the formulas
sin 2ϕ −sin ϕ
= 2 sin ϕ(cos ϕ −1

third root ϕ3 . Squaring and simple reformulations yield the explicit result
cos[ϕ3(λ)] = 1
2 λ2/3 −1 .
(15.151)
This root is in the interval 0 ≤ϕ3 ≤ϕ0 if

27 ≤λ ≤8 = λ1 . Let ξs3(λ)

desired optimal parameter is λ0 = λ2 = 7 . Figure 15.41 shows the graphs
of the function ξ(λ, ϕ) −ξ(λ, 0) for λ = 7 and for λ = 8 in the interval
−80◦≤ϕ ≤80◦. Notice the scale. The diﬀerences between maximum and
minimum are
Δξ(7) = ξs2(7) −ξs3(7) ≈0.022 ,
Δξ(8) = ξs2(8) −ξs1(8) ≈0.066 .

The quality of dwell is much better with λ0 = λ2 = 7 than with λ1 = 8
obtained from the condition on curvature. Equation (15.151) determines the
angle ϕ3(7) ≈33.9◦.
In Fig. 15.41 the upper limit of the interval of dwell is denoted ϕ4 . It is
deﬁned through the equation ξ(7, ϕ4) = ξs3(7) or explicitly


49 −4(1 −cos2 ϕ4)(cos ϕ4 + 1)2 = 3(72/3 −1) .
(15.156)
Solving for the root and squaring results in a cubic equation for cos ϕ4 .
Since this equation has the double root cos ϕ4 = cos[ϕ3(7)] = 1
2 72/3 −1 , a
linear equation is obtained. This equation has the solution cos ϕ4 = 1
4(5 −
72/3) , ϕ4 ≈70.4◦. Thus, the dwell has the length of approximately 141◦
per revolution of the crank.

What follows next, is valid again for the general case with n ≥3 (integer).
The pole P10 in Fig. 15.40 lies on the line AB if the points A , B and P10
satisfy the condition (xB−xA)(y10−yA)+yA(x10−xA) = 0 . The coordinates in
this equation are x10 = nr cos ϕ , y10 = nr sin ϕ and xA, yA , xB = rξ from
(15.138) and (15.139). Substitution of these expressions yields, surprisingly,
Eq.(15.146) again. This identity has to be interpreted as follows. At ϕ = 0
and also at ϕ = ϕ0 P10 lies on the line AB independent of the value of λ .
In the interval −ϕ0 ≤ϕ ≤+ϕ0 P10 lies on the line AB independent of ϕ
if λ has the optimal value λ0 . Outside the interval −ϕ0 ≤ϕ ≤+ϕ0 P10
does not lie, in general, on the line AB .
15.6 Rectangle Moving Between two Lines and a Point
Figures 15.42a and b illustrate a problem encountered when moving a piece
of furniture. The rectangle of unit length is to be displaced from position I
to position II in the space formed by the angle α between straight lines g1
and g2 and by the point P0 . Given α and the coordinates x0 , y0 of P0
in the x, y-system shown in the ﬁgures, determine whether the prescribed
displacement is possible and if so, what is the maximum admissible width
Bmax of the rectangle?
In the literature only the special case α = π/2 is treated analytically

In all four references the maximum length of the rectangle for a given width is
determined. This statement of the problem results in a sixth-order polynomial
equation for the unknown length. In the present section the problem is stated
diﬀerently. The length of the rectangle is given. The maximum possible width
is the unknown. This approach leads to a fourth-order polynomial in the case
α ≥π/2 and to a sixth-order polynomial in the case α < π/2 .
For achieving the maximum possible width corner points of the rectangle
must be guided along g1 and g2 . In the case α ≥π/2 shown in Fig. 15.42a ,
the motion of the rectangle consists of three phases, namely, of translation
along g1 until B is at 0 , of a motion with the position variable ϕ in the
interval
0 ≤ϕ ≤π −α
and of translation along g2 . These phases are
numbered 1 , 3 and 5 . In the case α < π/2 shown in Fig. 15.42b , phase 3 is
restricted to the interval π/2−α ≤ϕ ≤π/2 . In the interval 0 ≤ϕ ≤π/2−α
between phases 1 and 3 a phase 2 occurs with A moving along g1 and
with B′ moving along g2 . Between phases 3 and 5 a phase 4 occurs with
A′ moving on g1 and with B on g2 . The translatory motions in phases 1
and 5 are trivial. The other motions in phases 2 , 3 and 4 are known from
the elliptic trammel in Sect. 15.1.2 . They are called elliptic motions because
trajectories of body-ﬁxed points are ellipses. The inverse motion is known,
too. For an observer ﬁxed on the moving rectangle P0 is moving on a lima¸con
of Pascal.
The solution to the problem is simpliﬁed by the fact that the trajectory of
every point of the rectangle is symmetric with respect to the bisector g of the
angle α . Phase 1 is symmetric to phase 5 , phase 2 is symmetric to phase
4 , and phase 3 is symmetric with respect to its midpoint in the position
ϕ = (π −α)/2 . For two positions of P0 which are symmetric with respect
to g the maximum possible width is the same. For this reason it suﬃces to

15.6 Rectangle Moving Between two Lines and a Point
515
investigate the case when P0 is below the symmetry axis g or on g . Thus,
the maximum possible width is determined in phases 3 (second half only),
4 and 5 .
Method of Solution
The width b of the rectangle is treated as a free parameter. For each phase
i of motion (i = 1, . . . , 5) a one-parametric family of curves Ei(b) is deﬁned
as follows. For a given value of b Ei(b) is the curve on which P0 must be
located such that in phase i a rectangle of width b has a degree of freedom
when it is in contact with P0 .
Let fi(x, y, b) = 0 be the equation describing Ei(b) . Furthermore, let the
domain Γi be the set of all points (x, y) in the sector between g1 and g2
for which the equation fi(x0, y0, b) = 0 has (at least) one real solution b .
With this deﬁnition the maximum width Bmax for a given location (x0, y0)
of P0 is the minimum bmin of all solutions b of the equations fi(x0, y0, b) = 0
(i = 1, 3, 5 if α ≥π/2 and i = 1, . . . , 5 if α < π/2 ) . In the case bmin < 0 ,
the displacement from position I to position II is not possible.
It will be seen that each pair of domains Γi and Γj (j ̸= i) has a nonempty
intersection. Let Γ ′
i (i = 1, . . . , 5) be the subdomain of Γi in which P0 must
be located so that bmin is a solution of fi(x0, y0, b) = 0 . If the domains Γ ′
i
(i = 1, . . . , 5) are known, the solution for Bmax is found in two steps. First,
it is determined in which domain Γ ′
k P0 is located. Then, the single equation
fk(x0, y0, b) = 0 is solved. Its smallest root is Bmax .
The domains Γ ′
i
(i = 1, . . . , 5) are determined by their boundaries. Let
Gij = Gji (i, j = 1, . . . , 5 ; i ̸= j ) be the boundary between Γ ′
i and Γ ′
j .
By deﬁnition, for every point (x, y) on Gij there exists a real value of b
satisfying the equations fi(x, y, b) = 0 and fj(x, y, b) = 0 . Elimination of
b from these equations yields an equation for Gij .
15.6.1 Obtuse-Angled Corner
This is the case α ≥π/2 . Figure 15.42a shows that the curve E5(b) in phase
5 is the line y ≡b for x ≥0 . The curve E1(b) is the reﬂection of E5(b) in
g . It is the line parallel to g1 at the distance b . Its equation is
x sin α −y cos α −b = 0
(x cos α + y sin α ≥0) .
(15.160)
From this it follows that the domain Γ5 is the ﬁrst quadrant of the x, y-plane,
and that Γ1 is the reﬂection of Γ5 on g . Furthermore, the symmetry axis
g is the boundary G15 between the domains Γ ′
1 and Γ ′
5 .
Next, a parametric equation is given for the curve E3(b) in phase 3 of
the motion. Figure 15.43 shows a rectangle of width b in phase 3 . The
instantaneous center of rotation P (or pole P ) is the intersection of the

516
15 Plane Motion
normals to g1 at A and to g2 at B . It has the coordinates xP = sin ϕ/ sin α
and yP = cos ϕ/ sin α . Its distance from 0 is 1/ sin α independent of ϕ .
Thus, the pole is moving on the circle with radius
1/ sin α
about 0 . Let
n(ϕ) be the normal to AB through P . In the ﬁgure the quantities ϕ and
b and the location of P0 are chosen such that the following conditions are
satisﬁed:
a) P0 lies on A′B′
b) P0 lies on n(ϕ) . When these conditions are satisﬁed, P0 lies between A′
and B′. The point of the rectangle coinciding with P0 has zero velocity in
the direction of n(ϕ) . In this position the rectangle has a degree of freedom.
With a larger width b motion is impossible. From this it follows that E3(b)
is the envelope of all lines A′B′ in the interval 0 ≤ϕ ≤π −α . This implies
that curves E3(b1) and E3(b2) are parallel curves with the distance |b1 −b2|
between them. The envelope E3(b) is determined as follows. The normal form
of A′B′ with ϕ and b as free parameters is x cos β + y sin β −(p + b) = 0 .
With the length p = xP cos β of the perpendicular from 0 onto the line AB
and with β = ϕ + α −π/2 this becomes

x −sin ϕ


sin(ϕ + α) −y cos(ϕ + α) −b = 0 .

On E3(b) this equation as well as its partial derivative with respect to ϕ is
satisﬁed:
x cos(ϕ + α) + y sin(ϕ + α) −sin(2ϕ + α)
sin α
= 0 .
(15.162)
The solutions of these two equations for x and y are parameter equations
of E3(b) :

Figure 15.44 shows parallel curves E3(b) for several values b ≥0 in the
case α = 110◦. The lines n1 and n2 are the normals n(ϕ = 0) and n(ϕ =
π −α) , respectively. The curves E3(b) are symmetric with respect to g .
The endpoints for ϕ = 0 and for ϕ = π −α are located on n1 and n2 ,
respectively. The endpoint on n2 has the coordinates x = 1 , y = b . The
curve E3(b = 0) is the envelope of all lines AB. When P0 is located on E3(0) ,
the maximum admissible width of the rectangle is Bmax = 0 . For points P0
in the domain between g1 , g2 and E3(0) no rectangle can be moved from
position I to position II.
For parameter values b in a certain, as yet unknown interval the curves
E3(b) have cusps. Let K be the curve connecting all cusps. It is the evolute
of all E3(b) and also the envelope of the normals n(ϕ) . The equation of
n(ϕ) is Eq.(15.162). On K this equation as well as its partial derivative with
respect to ϕ is satisﬁed:

In Fig. 15.44 the evolute K is shown. It is symmetric with respect to g . Its
endpoints associated with ϕ = 0 and with ϕ = π −α are the points Q1
on n1 and Q2 on n2 , respectively. At these points K merges tangentially
with n1 (with n2 ). The point Q2 has the coordinate y = −2 cot α . The tip
S of K belonging to the central value ϕ = (π −α)/2 has the coordinates
xS = 1/ sin(α/2) ,
yS = 1/ cos(α/2) . Its distance from 0 is 2/ sin α , i.e.,
twice the radius of the pole circle. The width b = bS associated with the
special curve E3(b) through S is obtained from the ﬁrst Eq.(15.161) with
x = xS and ϕ = (π−α)/2 . It is bS = (3−cos α)/(2 sin α) . From this it follows
that the curve E3(b) has cusps if b is in the interval −2 cot α ≤b ≤bS .
The domain Γ3 of deﬁnition of curves E3(b) is the shaded domain in Fig.
15.44 . In what follows, the boundary G35 between the domains Γ ′
3 and Γ ′
5 is
determined. By deﬁnition, every point of G35 is the intersection point of two
curves E3(b) and E5(b) with identical b . Since both curves have the point
with coordinates x = 1 , y = b in common, the normal n2 is part of G35 .
Figure 15.44 shows that a curve E3(b) with cusps and the line E5(b) for the
same value of b have a second point of intersection located between the lines
n2 and K (in the small ﬁgure this is shown schematically). Also this point
is part of G35 . A parameter equation for G35 is found as follows. For E3(b)
Eqs.(15.161) and (15.162) are used (in the interval (π −α)/2 ≤ϕ ≤π −α
describing the branch below the symmetry line g ). In both equations b is
replaced by y because E5(b) has the equation y = b . This results in two
linear equations for x and y :
x sin(ϕ + α) −y[1 + cos(ϕ + α)] = sin ϕ sin(ϕ + α)

The coeﬃcient determinant is 1 + cos(π + α) . In the solutions for x and y
this determinant appears not only as denominator, but also as factor in both
numerators. From this it follows that both x and y are indeterminate in the
case ϕ = π −α . The solution associated with this indeterminacy is the line
n2 which was shown to be part of G35 . The other branch of G35 is described

The other endpoint associated with ϕ = π −α is the point Q2 on n2 . In Fig.
15.45 this branch of the boundary G35 is shown. The results are summarized
as follows. The domain Γ ′
3 has the symmetry axis g . The part below g is
bounded by the section 0 ≤x ≤1 of the x-axis, by the section of n2 between
the points (x = 1 , y = 0) and Q2 and by the section of G35 between Q2
and S∗. That the section of n2 above Q2 does not play a role is seen in
Fig. 15.44 from the curves E3(b) and E5(b) terminating on this section of
n2 . Figure 15.45 shows also the domains Γ ′
1 , Γ ′
3 and Γ ′
5 , the line g and
the curve E3(0) . The three domains have the point S∗in common. If P0 is
located at S∗, all three motion phases 1 , 3 and 5 yield one and the same
maximum width Bmax . This implies that S∗has equal distances from g1 ,
from g2 and from the curve E3(0) . The maximum width is Bmax = y∗with
y∗from (15.168).

if, second, for x and y the coordinates x0 and y0 of P0 are substituted.
The maximum admissible width Bmax is the smallest of the roots b . The

For every root ϕ of the second equation the associated solution b(ϕ) is
calculated from the ﬁrst equation. On the number of solutions the following
statement can be made. Consider in Fig. 15.44 the curve E3(b) with the
cusp shown in the enlarged inset. A neighboring curve E3(b + Δb) with a
suﬃciently small Δb intersects the curve E3(b) at two points, one of them
located between G31 and n1 and the other between G35 and n2 . Hence the
conclusion: Two solutions b exist if P0 is located either between G31 and n1

For solving the second Eq.(15.169) the terms cos(ϕ+α) , sin(ϕ+α) and

This is the case α < π/2 . Both domains Γ1 and Γ5 cover the entire sector
between g1 and g2 . The curves E1(b) and E5(b) have the same equations
as before.
Phase 3 of the motion is restricted to the interval π/2−α ≤ϕ ≤π/2 . In
this interval all previous results remain valid, i.e., Eqs.(15.161) – (15.163) for
the curves E3(b) , Eq.(15.165) for K and Eq.(15.167) for the curved section
of G35 . In the center ϕ = (π −α)/2 of the interval all curves intersect the
symmetry axis g .
Figure 15.46 shows for α = 40◦the curve K , the curved section of G35
and curves E3(b) for several values b ≥0 . At the ﬁnal angle ϕ = π/2 the
curve K and all curves E3(b) terminate on the line y = 1 . In particular,
E3(0) terminates at the point Q0 with the coordinate x = cot α , and K
terminates at the point Q3 with the coordinate x = 2 cot α . The curved
section of G35 starts at the point S∗(see Fig. 15.45 and (15.168)), and it
terminates with ϕ = π/2 at the intersection of g2 and E3(0) . Reﬂection of
G35 on g produces G31 . The domain Γ3 is the shaded area of the sector
between g1 and g2 .
Phase 2 : Figure 15.47 shows a rectangle and a point P0 in positions sat-
isfying the conditions (a) and (b). For the center of rotation P the dashed
auxiliary lines yield the x -coordinates xP = (sin ϕ + b cos ϕ)/ sin α , yP =

The normal form of the equation for the line A′B′ is determined by the angle
β = π/2 −(ϕ + α) and by the length p = xP cos β of the perpendicular.
The equation is

Figure 15.48 shows for α = 40◦curves E2(b) for several values b ≥0 . At the
end of the interval, i.e., for ϕ = π/2−α , all curves terminate on the normal
to g1 through the point Q0 known from Fig. 15.46 . The interval starts with
ϕ = ϕ0
given by (15.171). All curves E2(b) with b ≥cot α start on the
line y = sin α . In particular, E2(b = cot α)
starts at the point R0 with
the coordinate x = (1 + 1/ sin2 α) cos α . The curve E2(b) with b ≤cot α

These coordinates are obtained from (15.174) by substituting for sin ϕ and
cos ϕ the expressions sin ϕ0 and cos ϕ0 , respectively, of (15.171). Equation
(15.175) is a parametric equation of the curve called e1 . It starts with b = 0
at the point Q0 and it terminates with b = cot α at the point R0 . Elimination
of the parameter b yields the explicit equation x =

The domain Γ2 is the shaded area in Fig. 15.48 . Of its boundary only
the small section is still unknown on which the curves E2(b) have cusps.
This section is called e2 . For a given value of b (arbitrary) all normals n(ϕ)
envelope a curve K(b) . This curve K(b) is found by the same method that
was used for the curve K of Fig. 15.44 . Starting point is Eq.(15.173) of the
normal n(ϕ) . On K(b) this equation as well as its partial derivative with
respect to ϕ is satisﬁed:
−x sin(ϕ + α) + y cos(ϕ + α) −2 cos(2ϕ + α) −b sin(2ϕ + α)
sin α
= 0 . (15.176)
At the cusp of E2(b) Eqs.(15.172), (15.173) and (15.176) have the quantities
b , x , y and ϕ in common. Summation of (15.172) and (15.176) eliminates
x and y . The resulting equation is solved for b :
b = 3 cos(ϕ + α) cos ϕ −cos α
3 cos(ϕ + α) sin ϕ + sin α .

Substitution of this expression into (15.174) results in the desired parametric

In Fig. 15.48 this curve is shown. With ϕ = 0 it starts at the point R1 with
coordinates x = (1 + 2/ sin2 α) cos α , y = sin α . At this point the curve e2
merges tangentially with the line y = sin α . With ϕ = π/2 −α the curve
terminates at the point x = 0 , y = 1/ sin2 α . No explicit formulas have been
found for the point of tangential contact between e2 and e1 . The section of
e2 to the right of this point is part of the boundary of Γ2 .
In what follows, the curves G21 and G23 are determined. First, the curve
G21 . It is the geometric locus of the intersection points of E2(b) and E1(b) .
The expressions (15.174) are substituted into (15.160). The resulting equation
is solved for b :
b =
(1 + cos ϕ) cos(ϕ + α)
(1 + cos ϕ) sin(ϕ + α) −sin α .
(15.179)
When this is substituted back into (15.174), the parametric equation for G21
is obtained:
x(ϕ) = cos α + [1 + sin α sin(ϕ + α)] cos(ϕ + α)
sin α[(1 + cos ϕ) sin(ϕ + α) −sin α]

Figure 15.48 shows the curve G21 . With ϕ = 0 it starts at the same point
R1 as e2 . With ϕ = π/2 −α it terminates at Q0.
Next, the curve G23 is determined. Since neither for E2(b) nor for E3(b)
an equation free of the parameter ϕ is known, the curve G23 cannot be found
by the method used for G21 . For E2(b) (15.172) and (15.173) are used and
for E3(b) (15.161) and (15.162). At the intersection point the equations are
identical in x and y , but the parameters ϕ are not the same for E2(b) and
E3(b) . The angles are called ϕ2 for E2(b) and ϕ3 for E3(b) . The equations
are written as linear equations for x , y and b with coeﬃcients depending

A necessary condition for the existence of solutions x , y , b is the vanish-
ing of the (4 × 4)-determinant of the coeﬃcients including the right-hand
side expressions. The third and the fourth columns are multiplied by sin α .
Then, using addition theorems, the terms cos(2ϕi +α) and sin(2ϕi +α) are
expressed as functions of ϕi and of (ϕi + α) (i = 2, 3). Finally, the abbre-
viations are introduced: s = sin α ,
c = cos α ,
si = sin ϕi ,
ci = cos ϕi ,
Si = sin(ϕi + α) , Ci = cos(ϕi + α) (i = 2, 3). The resulting equation has

Finally, the expressions Si = sic + cis and Ci = cic −sis are introduced
(i = 2, 3). This results in an equation for ϕ2 and ϕ3 . Its highest-order term
is cos3 ϕ2 cos4 ϕ3 . The solution for, say ϕ2 , must be calculated numerically.
For reasons of symmetry it suﬃces to consider the interval π/2 −α ≤ϕ3 ≤
(π −α)/2 . For every pair of values (ϕ2, ϕ3) the corresponding quantities
x , y and b are calculated from (15.181). From b the angle ϕ0 of Eq.(15.171)

Finally, an equation determining bmin is formulated for the case when P0

variable u = tan ϕ/2 is introduced. The result is the 6th-order equation for

Chapter 16
Theory of Gearing
Gears are wheels with teeth shaped so as to transmit rotational motion from
one wheel to another. One of the wheels may be a rack (a wheel of inﬁnite
radius). In this case, rotational motion of a wheel is transformed into trans-
latory motion of the rack or vice versa. The present chapter is restricted to
gears transforming uniform motion of one wheel into uniform motion of the
other wheel or rack. This restriction eliminates from investigation specialties
such as elliptical wheels, Geneva wheels etc.
Gear pairs are classiﬁed by the relative location of the wheel axes and by
the shapes of teeth. Wheel axes are either parallel or intersecting or skew. In
all three cases there is a choice between external gearing (both wheels car-
rying the teeth externally and contacting each other externally) and internal
gearing (one wheel with external teeth inside the other wheel with internal
teeth). In all these cases an inﬁnite variety of tooth shapes exists for trans-
mitting uniform motion into uniform motion. For practical reasons only a
small number of shapes is actually used. Criteria for making the choice be-
tween external and internal gearing and for selecting particular tooth shapes
are among others (not necessarily in the given order and not unrelated)
– the power to be transmitted
– the gear ratio ω2/ω1 to be produced
– the volume required
– magnitude and direction of load imposed on shaft bearings
– the amount of sliding of contacting teeth (heat development, wear, lubri-
cation)
– the kind of contact (convex-convex or convex-concave; along a line; at a
single point)
– the sensitivity to manufacturing errors
– the amount of noise produced
– manufacturing costs.
Gearing technology has reached a high standard of precision. Of its
many aspects only some elements of kinematics are treated in the present

Townsend [18], Litvin [12], Dudley [5, 6], K. Roth [15, 16] and to the rich
literature cited therein. For the history of gearing see Matschoss [13].
Let ω1 and ω2 be the scalar magnitudes (both positive) of the angular
velocities of a pair of gears relative to the frame in which the gear axes are
mounted, and let n1 and n2 be the numbers of teeth of the two gears. The
gear ratio is
μ = ω2
ω1
= n1
n2
(16.1)
for external as well as for internal gears and with parallel or intersecting or
skew gear axes.
16.1 Parallel Axes
Transmission of rotation from one shaft to another parallel shaft is possible
by means of two cylindrical friction wheels which are rolling one on the other
without slipping. In Figs. 16.1a and b cross sections of the two possible
arrangements of wheels are shown. The radii are r1 and r2 . The circles p1
and p2 rolling one on the other are the centrodes of the wheels. The point
of rolling is the center of relative rotation P12 . In the theory of gearing the
centrodes are referred to as pitch circles and P12 as pitch point. The wheels
in Fig. 16.1a are rotating relative to the ﬁxed frame with opposite senses
of direction whereas those in Fig. 16.1b are rotating with equal senses of
direction. If in both cases ω1 and ω2 are the magnitudes of the angular
velocities relative to the frame, in both cases the rolling condition is ω1r1 =
ω2r2 or
μ = ω2
ω1
= r1
r2
.
(16.2)
If the wheels are gears, the centrodes exist only virtually. As is indicated in
the ﬁgures on parts of the circumferences the centrodes are replaced by teeth.
These teeth must have shapes which ensure that the gear ratio
ω2/ω1
is
constant throughout the motion. Necessary conditions are formulated further
below. In Fig. 16.1a both wheels have external gearing whereas in Fig. 16.1b
the larger external wheel has internal gearing. Equations (16.1) and (16.2)
establish between angular velocities, radii of pitch circles and numbers of
teeth the relationship
μ = ω2
ω1
= r1
r2
= n1
n2
.
(16.3)
A cylindrical gear – with external or internal gearing – is called spur gear if
the teeth are parallel to the gear axis. Such gears are treated ﬁrst. Spur gears
have line contact. This has the consequence that unavoidable misalignment

16.1 Parallel Axes
531
Fig. 16.1 Cylindrical friction wheels in rolling contact with opposite (a) and with equal
senses of rotation (b)
of wheel axes results in edge contact leading to rapid destruction of teeth. In
order to prevent this kind of failure the tooth ﬂanks on the wheel with fewer
teeth are given a minute crowning so that point contact is guaranteed. In what
follows, the kinematics of ideal spur gears without crowning is investigated.
From Fig. 16.2 a necessary condition on the shapes of teeth ensuring con-
stant gear ratio ω2/ω1 is deduced. The ﬁgure shows two tooth ﬂanks which
are instantaneously in contact at B . They belong to two wheels which are
rotating about ﬁxed centers P10 and P20 with instantaneous angular veloci-
ties ω1 and ω2 , respectively. Note that at this point pitch circles do not yet
exist. According to the theorem of Kennedy and Aronhold the instantaneous
center P12 of relative rotation of the wheels is the point of intersection of the
common normal at B with the line P10P20 . The vectors a = −−−→
P10P20 and
b = −−−→
P12P10 determine the instantaneous gear ratio (see (15.6))

where a and b are the magnitudes of a and b , respectively (both positive
if a and b are pointing in the same direction; the ﬁgure shows the case of
internal gearing; in the case of external gearing the vectors a and b have
opposite directions). In the case of arbitrarily shaped tooth ﬂanks, the center
P12 is not ﬁxed, and μ is a function of the angle of rotation of wheel 1 .
Hence the
Theorem 16.1. A constant gear ratio μ = ω2/ω1 requires mating tooth
ﬂanks to be shaped such that throughout the period of tangential contact the
common normal at the point of contact passes through a ﬁxed point on the
line P10P20 . Then this point is the pitch point P12 of two virtual pitch circles
p1 , p2 . Tooth ﬂanks satisfying this condition are said to be conjugate.
The condition stated in this theorem is necessary, but not suﬃcient. Another
necessary condition is that before a pair of meshing teeth is separating the
subsequent pair of teeth must have started meshing already. In the follow-
ing section Theorem 16.1 is used for formulating a relationship between the
curvatures of conjugate tooth ﬂanks at the point of contact.
With certain restrictions one out of two meshing tooth ﬂanks, say ﬂank f1 ,
can be chosen arbitrarily. The conjugate ﬂank f2 is then uniquely determined.
In Sec. 16.1.4 Theorem 16.1 is used for determining parameter equations of
f2 from given parameter equations of f1 .
An altogether diﬀerent way of determining the unknown ﬂank f2 from
a given ﬂank f1 is based on the fact that f2 is enveloped by f1 when the
wheels are rotating with the prescribed gear ratio. This is true not only for
spur gears, but for all kinds of gears. In engineering practice, this fact is
the basis of manufacturing methods. A cutting or milling tool 1 having the
shape of f1 is brought in contact with a cylindrical blank 2 . Tool 1 and
blank 2 are rotating with the prescribed gear ratio. In addition, tool 1 is
slowly moved into blank 2 thereby removing material in such a way that
at every stage the shape of 2 is enveloped by the shape of 1. This process
is continued until tool 1 and the ﬁnished wheel 2 have reached the desired
relative position. A survey of manufacturing methods see in K. Roth [16].

vectors ωi = ωie (i = 1, 2) and r = ren . At B the tooth ﬂanks are sliding
relative to each other. The relative velocity is expressed in two ways. In terms
of relative rotation about P12 it is
v12 = (ω1 −ω2) × r = ω1r(1 −μ)et .
(16.5)
Expressed as diﬀerence of the velocities of the two body-ﬁxed points coincid-
ing with B it is
v12 = ω1 × z1 −ω2 × z2 .
(16.6)
Let s1 and s2 be the arc lengths of the ﬂanks at B with directions as shown
in the ﬁgure. The velocities of B relative to the two ﬂanks are ˙s1et and ˙s2et ,
respectively. The curvatures of the contacting ﬂanks at B are denoted κ1
and κ2 . The sign conventions are such that the angular velocity of en is
given by the formula (κ1 ˙s1 +ω1)e as well as by the formula (κ2 ˙s2 +ω2)e (in
Fig. 16.2 κ1 > 0 and κ2 < 0 ). From the equality of these two expressions it
follows that
κ1 ˙s1 −κ2 ˙s2 = −ω1(1 −μ) .
(16.7)
Furthermore,
˙en = (κ1 ˙s1 + ω1)et .
(16.8)
From the identity z1 −z2 ≡a = const it follows that
˙z2 ≡˙z1 = ˙s1et + ω1 × z1 = ˙s2et + ω2 × z2
(16.9)
and from this in combination with (16.5)
˙s1 −˙s2 = −ω1r(1 −μ) .
(16.10)
In order to bring angular accelerations into play the orthogonality relation-
ship v12 · en = 0 is diﬀerentiated with respect to time:
˙v12 · en + v12 · ˙en = 0 .
(16.11)
Equation (16.6) yields
˙v12 = ˙ω1 × z1 + ω1 × ˙z1 −( ˙ω2 × z2 + ω2 × ˙z2) .
(16.12)
The condition μ = const means that
˙ω2 = 0 if
˙ω1 = 0 . Therefore, the
equation must be valid for ˙ω1 = ˙ω2 ≡0 . Hence, with (16.9),
˙v12 = (ω1 −ω2) × ˙z1 = (1 −μ)ω1 × ( ˙s1et + ω1 × z1)
= −ω1(1 −μ)( ˙s1en + ω1z1) .
(16.13)
With this expression and with (16.5) and (16.8) Eq.(16.11) becomes
(κ1 ˙s1 + ω1)r −( ˙s1 + ω1en · z1) = 0
(16.14)

534
16 Theory of Gearing
The coeﬃcient of ω1 is r −en ·z1 = en ·(r−z1) = en ·b . Thus, the equation
yields
˙s1 = ω1
en · b
1 −κ1r .
(16.15)
From (16.10) an expression for ˙s2 is obtained. Substitution of these two
expressions into (16.7) results in the desired condition on curvatures of con-
jugate ﬂanks. It has the symmetrical form
en · b(κ1 −κ2) + (1 −μ)(1 −κ1r)(1 −κ2r) ≡0 .
(16.16)
In terms of radii of curvature ϱi = 1/κi (i = 1, 2) it has the form
en · b (ϱ2 −ϱ1) + (1 −μ)(ϱ1 −r)(ϱ2 −r) ≡0 .
(16.17)
Equations (16.4) through (16.17) remain valid in the limit case a →∞,
i.e., ω2 →0 and μ →0 . In this case, body 2 in Fig. 16.2 is a rack in
translatory motion with velocity v = ω1r1 . Equations (16.16) and (16.17)
are used not only in kinematics, but also for calculations of Hertzian pressures
from curvatures at points of contact.
16.1.2 Camus’ Theorem
In Fig. 16.3 p1 and p2 are the pitch circles of two wheels with pitch point
P12 . Let q be an arbitrary smooth curve which is ﬁxed in a plane Σ and
which is in tangential contact with p1 and p2 at P12 . Furthermore, let Q
be an arbitrary point ﬁxed in Σ , i.e., rigidly connected to q . The curve q is
rolled once on p1 and once on p2 . Point Q generates in the ﬁrst process a
trajectory f1 on wheel 1 and in the second process a trajectory f2 on wheel
2 . Camus1 proved
Theorem 16.2. The trajectories f1 and f2 are conjugate tooth ﬂanks.
Proof: In the ﬁgure the rotations of p1 and p2 about their centers with rolling
contact at P12 and the rolling of q on both pitch circles occur simultaneously
in such a way that q is permanently in contact with p1 and with p2 at P12 .
For an observer ﬁxed on p1 Q is moving along f1 and for an observer ﬁxed
on p2 Q is moving along f2 . In this process Q is permanently contact point
of f1 and f2 , and the line P12Q is permanently the common normal of f1
and f2 at this contact point Q . Hence, by Theorem 16.1 , f1 and f2 are
conjugate tooth ﬂanks. These arguments are valid for external as well as for
internal gearing. End of Proof.

The trajectory of the contact point Q in a frame-ﬁxed reference system
(line b in the ﬁgure) is referred to as line of contact. At Q the line P12Q is
tangent to b .
16.1.3 Cycloidal Gearing
Camus’ theorem provides a simple explanation of de la Hire’s classical theory
of cycloidal gearing2. In Fig. 16.4 the case of external gearing is demonstrated.
The curve q is a circle touching p1 from the inside and p2 from the outside,
and Q is a point ﬁxed on q . When the circle q is rolled inside p1 , Q
generates a hypocycloid f1 ﬁxed on p1 , and when q is rolled on p2 , Q
generates an epicycloid f2 ﬁxed on p2 . The two cycloids are conjugate ﬂanks.
More precisely, f1 is the bottom part of a tooth on p1 , and f2 is the top
part of a tooth on p2 . The missing parts of the teeth are generated by means
of another circle q′ which is rolled on the outside of p1 and on the inside
of p2 . This circle generates the epicycloid f ′
1 on p1 and the hypocycloid f ′
2
on p2 . In Fig. 16.4 the circles q and q′ have equal diameters. This is not
necessary, though.
Remark: One of the pitch circles, say p1 , may be a rack, i.e., a circle of
inﬁnite radius. In this case, f1 and f ′
1 are ordinary cycloids generated by
rolling q and q′ on the straight pitch line p1 .
A given gear ratio
ω2/ω1 = n1/n2 = r1/r2
requires that each wheel
is equipped with equally spaced identical teeth, n1 on wheel 1 and n2 on
wheel 2 . The length of arc of the pitch circle available per tooth is identical
for both pitch circles. It is called circular pitch t :
t = 2πr1
n1
= 2πr2
n2
.
(16.18)

536
16 Theory of Gearing
In Fig. 16.4 the numbers are n1 = 9 and n2 = 12 . The height of a tooth
above the pitch circle, the so-called addendum a , is limited by the condition
that teeth must not be pointed. The maximum possible addendum is dictated
by the epicycloids on the smaller wheel. On both wheels the cycloidal tooth
ﬂanks have the same height a above and the same depth a below the pitch
circle, so that the active height of the teeth is 2a . The feet of neighboring
teeth are separated by a smooth curve called ﬁllet the purpose of which is (i)
to reduce the notch eﬀect, (ii) to prevent contact with the tips of opposite
teeth and (iii) to provide room for lubricating ﬂuids.
In the course of meshing the point of contact is moving along the dotted
line of contact A1-P12-A2 with endpoints A1 and A2 on the dashed adden-
dum circles. It is seen that the gearing satisﬁes another necessary condition,
namely, that before one pair of meshing teeth is loosing contact another pair is
already meshing. The relative sliding velocity at a contact point B anywhere
on the line of contact is given by (16.5). It is proportional to the distance
r = BP12 . It is maximal at A1 and at A2 and it is zero when P12 is the
point of contact.
In well-lubricated gears (no friction force in the common tangent plane) the
force transmitted by one tooth on the other has the direction of the contact
normal BP12 . The periodical change of this direction is a disadvantage of
cycloidal gears. Another weakness, from the point of view of bending stiﬀness
and bending stresses, is the concave shape of the bottom parts of teeth. A
favorable characteristic is the concave–convex contact of teeth which reduces
contact pressure as well as wear. For all these reasons cycloidal gears are
used in ﬁne precision mechanics exclusively. An example is the watch gear
shown in Fig. 16.5 . In this particular example, the hypocycloids inside the
pitch circles are straight lines passing through the respective centers. This
indicates that the radius of the circle q equals r1/2 , and that the radius of
the circle q′ equals r2/2 . The large backlash of this gearing does not cause

Fig. 16.5 Watch gearing with straight-line tooth ﬂanks inside the pitch circles
problems because in watch gearings the sense of rotation does not change.
Remark: All kinds of gears require a small backlash preventing teeth from
having contact on both ﬂanks simultaneously. For the manufacturing of teeth
this means that on the pitch circle the arc length of a tooth is a little smaller
than half the circular pitch t , and that the width between teeth is a little
larger than t/2 . In the remainder of this chapter this is not mentioned again.
16.1.4 Construction of Conjugate Flanks
Reuleaux showed how to use Theorem 16.1 for constructing conjugate tooth
ﬂanks. In Fig. 16.6 his method is demonstrated in the case of external gearing.
The ﬁgure shows pitch circles p1 and p2 with ﬁxed centers P10 and P20 and
the pitch point P12 . Let ﬂank f1 on wheel 1 be some arbitrarily prescribed
smooth curve subject only to the condition that the normal to f1 at the point
B1 (arbitrary) intersects p1 . Let N1 be this wheel-ﬁxed point of intersection.
In Fig. 16.6 f1 is shown when wheels 1 and 2 are in some arbitrarily chosen
Fig. 16.6 Reuleaux’s construction of ﬂank f2 conjugate to a given ﬂank f1

538
16 Theory of Gearing
initial position. To each pair (point B1 , normal B1N1 ) a conjugate pair (point
B2 , normal B2N2 ) of ﬂank f2 in the initial position of f2 is constructed
as follows. Conjugate means that (B1 , B1N1 ) and ( B2 , B2N2 ) are the
points and normals which coincide in the course of meshing at a certain
point B . Let ϕ1 = ∢(B1P10B) be the unknown angle of rotation of wheel
1 carrying B1 to B . According to Theorem 16.1 the common normal to
the ﬂanks at B is the dotted line passing through P12 . This means that
the rotation through ϕ1 carries the wheel-ﬁxed point N1 to P12 . Hence
ϕ1 = ∢(N1P10P12) . When wheel 1 rotates through ϕ1 , wheel 2 rotates in
the opposite direction through ϕ2 = μϕ1 . Hence, the initial positions of B2
and B2N2 are determined by rotating wheel 2 from the meshing position
( B , BP12 ) through the angle −ϕ2 . In this way the contact point B and the
initial positions of B2 and B2N2 of ﬂank f2 are determined for each pair
( B1 , B1N1 ) of ﬂank f1 . It may happen that ﬂank f1 is intersecting f2 at
some point while it is in contact at another point. This phenomenon is called
undercutting. It restricts the freedom in choosing ﬂank f1 . The geometric
locus of all contact points B is the line of contact (see the example in Fig.
16.4 where the line of contact is the arc sequence A1-P12-A2 ).
Analytically, the condition in Theorem 16.1 is formulated as follows. The
x0, y0-system shown in Fig. 16.7a is frame-ﬁxed. Against this x0, y0-system
the x, y-system ﬁxed on wheel 1 and the ξ, η-system ﬁxed on wheel 2 are
rotated through the angles ϕ1 (arbitrary) counterclockwise and ϕ2 = μϕ1 =
(n2/n1)ϕ1 clockwise, respectively. The following transformation equations
are deduced from the ﬁgure:
x0 = x cos ϕ1 −y sin ϕ1 −r1 ,
y0 = x sin ϕ1 + y cos ϕ1 ,
 
(16.19)
ξ = −x cos(ϕ1 + ϕ2) + y sin(ϕ1 + ϕ2) + (r1 + r2) cos ϕ2 ,
η =
x sin(ϕ1 + ϕ2) + y cos(ϕ1 + ϕ2) −(r1 + r2) sin ϕ2 .
 
(16.20)
Flank f1 is assumed to be given in the x, y-system in the form x(u) , y(u)
with a parameter u . To be determined are, in parameter form as functions of
u , the line of contact in the frame-ﬁxed x0, y0-system and the conjugate ﬂank
f2 in the ξ, η-system. The solution is found as follows. The transformation
(16.19) of x(u) , y(u) into the x0, y0-system yields for ﬂank f1 as functions
of ϕ1 the coordinates
x0(u) = x(u) cos ϕ1 −y(u) sin ϕ1 −r1 ,
y0(u) = x(u) sin ϕ1 + y(u) cos ϕ1 .
(16.21)
Let the partial derivative with respect to u be denoted by the symbol prime.
The normal to f1 has the slope −x′
0(u)/y′
0(u) . The condition that in the
position ϕ1 the normal at the point x0(u) , y0(u) passes through P12 has
the form
y0(u)/x0(u) = −x′
0(u)/y′
0(u)
or
x0(u)x′
0(u) + y0(u)y′
0(u) = 0 .

Each solution determines the angle ϕ1(u) , i.e., the position of wheel 1 , for
which the point x0(u) , y0(u) determined by (16.21) is a point of contact
(point B of Fig. 16.6). From this it follows that the line of contact has, in
the frame-ﬁxed x0, y0-system, the parameter equations
x0B(u) = x(u) cos ϕ1(u) −y(u) sin ϕ1(u) −r1 ,
y0B(u) = x(u) sin ϕ1(u) + y(u) cos ϕ1(u) .
 
(16.25)
Equations (16.20) determine the ξ, η-coordinates of ﬂank f2 :
ξ(u) = −x(u) cos[ϕ1(u) + ϕ2(u)] + y(u) sin[ϕ1(u) + ϕ2(u)] + (r1 + r2) cos ϕ2(u) ,
η(u) =
x(u) sin[ϕ1(u) + ϕ2(u)] + y(u) cos[ϕ1(u) + ϕ2(u)] −(r1 + r2) sin ϕ2(u) .

(16.26)
These equations represent a mapping of ﬂank f1 into ﬂank f2 . This ends the
solution of the problem for external gearing.

16 Theory of Gearing
In the case of internal gearing, Fig. 16.7b replaces Fig. 16.7a . Deliberately,
the inner wheel is given the label 2 in contrast to the labeling in Figs. 16.1b
and 16.2 . The x0, y0-system and the x, y-system are located as before. This
has the consequence that (16.19) and (16.22) – (16.25) remain valid. The line
of contact is the same for external and for internal gearing. Equations (16.26)
for ﬂank f2 are replaced by
ξ(u) =
x(u) cos[ϕ2(u) −ϕ1(u)] + y(u) sin[ϕ2(u) −ϕ1(u)] −(r1 −r2) cos ϕ2(u) ,
η(u) = −x(u) sin[ϕ2(u) −ϕ1(u)] + y(u) cos[ϕ2(u) −ϕ1(u)] + (r1 −r2) sin ϕ2(u) .

(16.28)
Remark: Sometimes it is simpler to solve (16.23) for u(ϕ1) than for ϕ1(u) .
In such cases, the free parameter in (16.25) – (16.28) is ϕ1 .
16.1.5 Pin Gears
The teeth of a pin gear are circular cylinders mounted between two circular
discs. Manufacture is inexpensive since no cutting of teeth is necessary. For
this reason the larger of the two wheels is made the pin wheel. Pin gears of
small size are used in watches and of large size in reducers of cranes and other
heavy-duty machinery.
Figure 16.8 shows a case of external gearing. On the larger wheel pins
of radius ρ are placed with their centers on the pitch circle p1 . Consider
the pin centered at the pitch point P12 . Let this position be the position
ϕ1 = ϕ2 = 0 of the wheels. The circular contour of the pin is the given ﬂank
f1 . When the pitch circles are rotating with rolling contact at P12 , the center

541
of the pin traces an epicycloid z ﬁxed on p2 . In the same process the circle
f1 ﬁxed on p1 sweeps over an area of wheel 2 which is enveloped by two
curves which are parallel to z at the distance ρ . These parallel curves are
the ﬂanks f2 conjugate to f1 . With the angle u as parameter the equations
of the circle f1 are
x(u) = r1 + ρ cos u ,
y(u) = ρ sin u .
(16.29)
Hence x′(u) = −ρ sin u , y′(u) = ρ cos u . Equation (16.23) has the form
sin(u + ϕ1) = sin u .
(16.30)
The solutions are
ϕ1 = 0 :
u arbitrary ,
ϕ1 ̸= 0 :
ϕ1 = ±π −2u .
 
(16.31)
The solution in the case ϕ1 = 0 expresses the fact that in the position shown
in the ﬁgure the normal at every point of the circle passes through P12 . The
solutions ϕ1 = ±π −2u represent identical positions of wheel 1 . Therefore,
it suﬃces to consider the solution ϕ1 = π −2u . The position shown in the
ﬁgure is characterized by ϕ1 = 0 , i.e., by u = π/2 . This means that in the
position shown ﬂank f2 is in contact with the pin at this point. Substituting
(16.29) and the solution ϕ1 = π −2u into (16.25) results in the equations
for the line of contact:
x0B(u) = −r1(1 + cos 2u) −ρ cos u = −(2r1 cos u + ρ) cos u ,
y0B(u) =
r1 sin 2u + ρ sin u =
(2r1 cos u + ρ) sin u .
 
(16.32)
Comparison with (15.13) shows that the line of contact is a lima¸con of Pascal.
Substitution of (16.29) into (16.26) yields for f2 the equations
ξ(u) = −ρ cos[u + ϕ1(u) + ϕ2(u)] −r1 cos[ϕ1(u) + ϕ2(u)] +(r1 + r2) cos ϕ2(u) ,
η(u) =

(implying
r1 = 2r2 ) and ρ = 0.2r2 . Equations (16.32) and (16.33) are
x0B(u) = −r2(4 cos u + 0.2) cos u ,
ξ(u) = r2 (0.2 cos 5u + 2 cos 6u + 3 cos 4u) ,
y0B(u) =
r2(4 cos u + 0.2) sin u ,
η(u) = r2 (0.2 sin 5u + 2 sin 6u + 3 sin 4u) .

(16.35)
The line of contact is the dotted line denoted b . The functions ξ(u) , η(u)
without the terms cos 5u and sin 5u describe the cycloid z traced by the
center of the pin. These lines b and z as well as the ﬂank f2 display the

542
16 Theory of Gearing
symmetry shown in the ﬁgure. The following discussion of f2 is concerned
with the branch η > 0 . The small ﬁgure shows, enlarged and schematically,
the curves f1 and f2 in the vicinity of tangential contact at the point u =
π/2 . At this point f2 is passing, with increasing u , from the outside to
the inside of f1 . After passing through a cusp C it crosses f1 at another
point A . With the given parameters the cusp C is the point u ≈92.4◦,
ξ ≈0.9792r2 , η ≈0.1986r2 , and A is the point u ≈93.2◦, ξ ≈0.9816r2 ,
η ≈0.1992r2 . This means that A lies at approximately 0.09ρ to the right
of the y0-axis. The tip B of the tooth shown in the large ﬁgure is the point
of intersection of f2 with the line η = π
8 ξ . It is associated with u ≈103.5◦.
In conclusion: The arc A–B of f2 has contact with f1 in the narrow interval
93.2◦< u < 103.5◦of f1 . To the right of A the tooth ﬂank must be given a
form avoiding contact with the pin. The arc A–C of f2 interferes with the
pin. This problem of interference does not occur when the centers of the pins
are placed on a circle of radius < r1 , for then the cycloid z and the parallel
curve f2 do not have cusps. End of example.
Example: In Fig. 16.9 a case of internal gearing is shown. The outer wheel
1 has n1 = 10 pins, and the inner wheel 2 has n2 = 9 teeth, so that
r2/r1 = n2/n1 = 9/10 . The centers of the pins of radius ρ are placed on a
circle of radius λr1 with λ > 1 . With the angle u shown in the ﬁgure the
ﬂank f1 of the pin having its center on the x-axis is given by the equations
x(u) = λr1 −ρ cos u ,
y(u) = −ρ sin u .
(16.36)
Equation (16.23) is
sin(u + ϕ1) = λ sin u .

The solution for u as function of ϕ1 is

With this expression Eqs.(16.25) for the line of contact and Eqs.(16.27) for

In Fig. 15.5 the geometrically simplest case of internal pin gearing is il-
lustrated. It is the case with the inner pitch circle being half the size of the
outer and with pins located on the inner wheel. The cycloids traced by the
centers of the pins are straight lines and so are the parallel curves, i.e., the
tooth ﬂanks on the outer wheel. It is easy to show that also in this case the
line of contact is a lima¸con of Pascal.
16.1.6 External Involute Spur Gears
In well-lubricated gears (no friction force in the common tangent plane) the
force transmitted by one tooth on the other has the direction of the contact
normal (line BP12 in Fig. 16.6). When the transmitted torque is constant,
both magnitude and direction of this force should also be constant in order to
prevent periodic excitations. These conditions are satisﬁed if and only if the
line of contact is a straight line in which case it is also the line of action of the
contact force. Another desirable property of gears is the following. Conjugate
ﬂanks of two wheels should be geometrically similar in order to be able to
use one and the same manufacturing tool for both wheels. In what follows,
it is shown that the involute of a circle is the curve having these desired
properties. This was ﬁrst shown by Euler [7]. For properties of involutes see
Sect. 15.5.4 . In Fig. 16.10 the pitch circles of two wheels with centers P10
and P20 and with pitch point P12 are shown again. Through P12 a straight
line A1A2 is drawn under an arbitrary angle α . This line is tangent to two
so-called base circles c1 about P10 and c2 about P20 . Their radii are

(i = 1, 2) .
(16.40)
The ratio is r01/r02 = r1/r2 . The base circles c1 and c2 are rigidly attached
to the respective wheels. Imagine the straight line A1A2 to be part of a string
which is wound oﬀcircle c1 and rolled up by circle c2 when the wheels are
rotating. Consider a point B ﬁxed on the string in its motion from A1 to
A2 . Seen from an observer ﬁxed on c1 the trajectory of B is the involute
f1 , and seen from an observer ﬁxed on c2 the trajectory of B is the involute
f2 . At B the two involutes are in tangential contact. The common normal is
the line BP12 . This proves the two properties of involute gearing stated in
the beginning: Involutes are, indeed, tooth ﬂanks producing a constant gear
ratio ω2/ω1 = r1/r2 . Both ﬂanks are geometrically similar, and the line of
contact is a straight line, namely, the line A1A2 . This frame-ﬁxed line is the
line of action of the contact force. In addition, involute tooth ﬂanks have the
important property to remain conjugate, i.e., to be meshing correctly, when
the distance between the centers of the two base circles is changed. Involute
tooth ﬂanks are the only ones having this property3. With changing distance
the angle α as well as the radii r1 and r2 of the pitch circles change in such
a way that the ratio r1/r2 remains unchanged.
That the two involutes are conjugate tooth ﬂanks is conﬁrmed by (16.17).
In the present case, the quantities a and b as well ϱ1 and ϱ2 have pairwise
opposite signs. With the deﬁnitions given in Fig. 16.2 the various quantities
are a = r1 + r2 , b = −r1 , μ = b/(a + b) = −r1/r2 , en · b = −r1 sin α ,
ϱ1 −r = r1 sin α , ϱ2 −r = −r2 sin α and ϱ2 −ϱ1 = −(r1 + r2) sin α . With
these quantities (16.17) is, indeed, satisﬁed.
The angle α is called angle of pressure. If for a given angle of pressure
the radius r01 is made larger and larger, the meshing segment of ﬂank f1 is
curved less and less. In the limit r01 →∞a rack with straight-line tooth

ﬂanks is obtained. Hence the conclusion: A wheel 2 with involute gearing
and a rack 1 with straight line tooth ﬂanks and with equal angle of pressure
α satisfy the condition that a constant angular velocity ω2 of the wheel
produces a constant translatory velocity r2ω2 of the rack.
Remark: It is unnecessary to prove by means of (16.22) – (16.26) that the
ﬂank f2 conjugate to an involute ﬂank f1 on the base circle c1 is an involute
on the base circle c2 . As is seen in Fig. 16.10 the deﬁnition of the involute
implies that the line A1A2 is the line of contact. Therefore, the following
formulation of (16.22) and (16.25) is done simply as an exercise. Parameter
equations of the involute on the base circle c1 of radius r1 cos α are copied
from (15.137) with h = 0 and with u instead of φ :
x(u) = r1 cos α(−sin u + u cos u) ,
x′(u) = −r1 cos α u sin u ,
y(u) = r1 cos α(cos u + u sin u) ,
y′(u) =
r1 cos α u cos u .
 
(16.41)
Equation (16.22) has the form
u[cos α + sin(u + ϕ1)] = 0
(16.42)
or sin(u + ϕ1) = −cos α = −sin(α + π/2) . Hence ϕ1 = −(u + α + π/2)
and
cos ϕ1 = −sin(u + α) ,
sin ϕ1 = −cos(u + α) .
(16.43)
With these expressions Eqs.(16.25) for the line of contact are
x0B(u) = −r1 sin α (sin α + u cos α) ,
y0B(u) = −r1 cos α (sin α + u cos α) .
 
(16.44)
Hence y0B(u) = x0B(u) cot α . This is, indeed, the equation of the line A1A2
in Fig. 16.10 . The transformation of Eqs.(16.26) into the standard form of
an involute is tedious. End of remark.
For a single wheel the radius r of the pitch circle, the angle of pressure
α and the number n of teeth determine the radius r0 = r cos α of the base
circle and the circular pitch
t = 2πr
n
.
(16.45)
Two mating wheels have the same circular pitch t since r1/n1 = r2/n2 .
Following (16.18) the addendum a and the active height 2a of teeth were
deﬁned. In the theory of involute gearing these quantities are expressed in
terms of the so-called module m which is deﬁned by the equation
m = 2r
n = t
π .
(16.46)
Two mating wheels have the same module m . By industrial standard a nor-
mal tooth has height m above and depth (6/5)m below the pitch circle.

546
16 Theory of Gearing
These two measures are referred to as addendum and dedendum, respectively.
With appropriate tools the involute is cut between the circle with radius
ri = r −m and the addendum circle with radius ra = r + m . The diﬀer-
ence ra −ri = 2m is the active height of the teeth. The clearance of radial
width m/5 at the foot of teeth is the room for the ﬁllet which was explained
following (16.18). The deﬁnition (16.46) is chosen such that the tooth thick-
ness d(ra) at the tip of the tooth is reasonable for any number n of teeth.
Reasonable means not unnecessarily large and always positive. A formula for
d(ra) is given in (16.66).
Figure 16.11 shows the contact line A1A2 of Fig. 16.10. Tooth contact is
conﬁned to the segment B1B2 inside the addendum circles with radii ra1
and ra2 . These radii determine the angles γ1 and γ2 and the length ℓof
the segment B1B2 :
ℓ= r01(tan γ1 −tan α) + r02(tan γ2 −tan α) ,
cos γi = r0i

(i = 1, 2) .
(16.47)
Before one pair of teeth goes out of meshing the next pair must be meshing
already. On the line of contact the distance between points of meshing of
subsequent teeth is δ = 2πr01/n1 = 2πr02/n2 (since involutes are parallel
curves the distance δ equals the arc length on the base circle). The ratio
ε = ℓ/δ is called contact ratio. It must be larger than 1 . The formulas yield

One out of many ways of cutting teeth of the desired shape into a cylindri-
cal blank of radius ra = r+m is by means of a rack cutter. This is a modiﬁed
rack which is capable of meshing with the wheel to be cut. Its teeth are cut-
ting blades. The motion of work piece and rack cutter relative to each other

is the intended rolling of the pitch circle p on the pitch line Π
of the rack
cutter superimposed by a reciprocating translatory motion in the direction
normal to the plane of rolling (Fig. 16.12a). In the space of width m above
and m below the pitch line Π
the tooth of the rack cutter has straight-line
ﬂanks under the angle of pressure α . Industrial standard is α = 20◦. The
distance between adjacent teeth on the pitch line equals the circular pitch
t = πm of the wheel. The straight-line section of the tooth is cutting the
involute. The tip of radial extension m/5 consists of a straight-line segment
parallel to
Π
and of a circular arc which is cutting the ﬁllet.
Figure 16.12a shows the line of contact passing through the pitch point
P12 under the angle α and touching the base circle c of the involute at A
(compare with Fig. 16.10). The segment P12A has length r sin α . Hence the
distance of A from the line
Π
is r sin2 α . In order to avoid undercutting
the condition
m ≤r sin2 α
must be satisﬁed. In view of (16.46) this is a
condition on the number of teeth of the wheel:
n >
2
sin2 α ≈17.1
(for α = 20◦) .
(16.49)
In practice n = 17 is acceptable.
Addendum Modiﬁcation
In order to allow for numbers of teeth n < 18 without undercutting the rack
cutter is laterally shifted away from the wheel. In Fig. 16.12b this so-called
rack shift or addendum modiﬁcation is denoted e . Note that the pitch line Π
is not shifted because it is, by deﬁnition, the tangent to the pitch circle. Only
the teeth of the rack are shifted. Consequently, the condition m ≤r sin2 α
is replaced by m −e ≤r sin2 α or

(16.51)
Example: n = 13 yields e/m ≥0.24 , and n = 8 yields e/m ≥0.53 .
End of example.
In what follows, the eﬀects of addendum modiﬁcation on the geometry
of teeth are investigated. The inner radius of the involute tooth ﬂank is
ri = r + e −m . Deﬁnition: The tooth thickness d(ρ) at an arbitrary radius
ρ ≥ri is the arc length of the circle of radius ρ between the ﬂanks of the
tooth (see Fig. 16.13). The thickness d(r) on the pitch circle equals the space
width between the tooth ﬂanks of the rack cutter on the line
Π . Figure

The factor of r is the angle under which d(r) is seen from the wheel center.
The thickness d(ρ) at the radius ρ is seen under an angle which is larger by
2[inv α −inv ψ(ρ)] (see Figs. 16.13 and 15.39). The angles in this expression
are (see (15.135) and (15.136)):
inv α = tan α −α ,
inv ψ(ρ) = tan ψ(ρ) −ψ(ρ)
with
cos ψ(ρ) = r0

(16.54)
It is seen that an addendum modiﬁcation e > 0 has the eﬀect of increasing
the tooth thickness. The foot of the involute on the base circle is characterized
by inv ψ(ρ) = 0 . Consequently, the angle χ between the cusps of the involute

ρp = r cos α

(16.56)
Solving an equation inv ψ = c = const , i.e., f = tan ψ −ψ −c = 0 , for ψ

This is the equation

solution is ψ = 85◦. The formulas yield ψ0 ≈83.4◦, ψ1 ≈85.5◦, ψ2 ≈
85.05◦, ψ3 ≈85.0005◦. End of example.
In what follows, the meshing of two wheels with addendum modiﬁcations
e1 and e2 is investigated. Without addendum modiﬁcations the geometry is
as shown in Fig. 16.10 . Because of increased tooth thickness it is necessary
to increase the distance r1 + r2 between the wheel centers in order to avoid
interference of teeth. It has already been said that proper meshing of two
involute ﬂanks is possible with arbitrary distances. Let D′ be the unknown
distance. It determines the radii r′

angle of pressure α′ such that

The distance D′ is determined by the condition that on these new pitch
circles the tooth thickness d(r′

between neighboring teeth on wheel 2 (and vice versa). The tooth thickness
is given by (16.54) with ψ(r′

The change of signs is explained by the fact that the sum of the angles

expressions and making use of the second Eq.(16.59) results in an equation
for α′ :
inv α′ =

With the angle α′ thus determined the distance D′ is calculated from
(16.59):
D′ = r01 + r02
cos α′
= (r1 + r2) cos α
cos α′ .
(16.63)
Next, the radii rai (i = 1, 2) of the addendum circles at the tips of teeth
are determined. The inner radii of the involute ﬂanks are known to be rii =
ri + ei −m (i = 1, 2). The active height h = ra1 −ri1 = ra2 −ri2
of the
teeth is the diﬀerence
h = D′ −(ri1 + ri2) = D′ −[(r1 + e1 −m) + (r2 + e2 −m)]

(16.64)
Without addendum modiﬁcation (also in the more general case e1 + e2 = 0 )
this formula yields the normal active height 2m . It can be shown that h <
2m if e1 + e2 > 0 . The desired radii of the addendum circles are
rai = rii + h = ri + ei −m + h
(i = 1, 2) .
(16.65)
With these radii Eq.(16.48) for the contact ratio remains valid provided α
is replaced by α′ .
Example: For a pair of wheels the data are given: n1 = 8 , e1/m = 0.56 ;
n2 = 13 , e2/m = 0.24 . To be determined are the angles χi and the radii
ρpi (i = 1, 2) of the teeth, the distance D′ , the active height h , the radii
rai (i = 1, 2) and the contact ratio ε . All lengths are to be expressed as
multiples of r1 .
Solution: Equations (16.55) – (16.65) and (16.48) yield
χ1 ≈30.05◦, ψp1 ≈47.50◦, ρp1 ≈1.391 r1 , χ2 ≈17.22◦, ψp2 ≈40.73◦,
ρp2 ≈2.015 r1 , α′ ≈27.92◦, D′ ≈2.792 r1 , h ≈0.467 r1 , ra1 ≈1.357 r1 ,
ra2 ≈1.902 r1 , γ1 ≈46.17◦, γ2 ≈36.60◦, ε ≈1.09 .
End of example.
In this example, the purpose of addendum modiﬁcation is to prevent un-
dercutting. The same goal is achieved without addendum modiﬁcation by

16.1 Parallel Axes
551
increasing the tooth numbers
n1 = 8 , n2 = 13
to
n1 = 24, n2 = 39 .
Addendum modiﬁcation is used not only for the prevention of undercutting.
Another purpose is to achieve a desired distance D′ of the wheel axes or
a desired change of tooth thickness (possibly with addendum modiﬁcation
e1 +e2 < 0 ). If, for example, D′ is prescribed, (16.63) and (16.62) determine
α′ and e1 + e2 .
This section is closed with a formula for the tooth thickness d(ra) at the
tip of a tooth in the case of zero addendum modiﬁcation. With (16.46) the
tip radius is ra = r + m = r(1 + 2/n) . Hence with (16.53) and (16.54)

standard addendum is well chosen.
16.1.7 Internal Involute Spur Gears
Figure 16.14 diﬀers from Fig. 16.10 in that the pitch circle p1 of wheel
1 with radius r1 is inside wheel 2 . The outer wheel has internal gearing,
whereas the inner wheel has external gearing as before. As in Fig. 16.10 the
common normal en to the involutes f1 and f2 at the point of contact B
is tangent to the base circles c1 and c2 . Equation (16.17) is satisﬁed with
a = r2 −r1 ,
b = r1 ,
μ = b/(a + b) = r1/r2 ,
en · b = −r1 sin α ,
ϱ2 −ϱ1 = A1A2 = (r2 −r1) sin α , ϱ1 −r = r1 sin α and ϱ2 −r = r2 sin α .
This suﬃces as proof for the involutes being conjugate tooth ﬂanks.

552
16 Theory of Gearing
In comparison with the pairing of two wheels with external gearing the pairing
internal / external gearing has the following advantages:
– the internal teeth have the shape of the free space between external involute
teeth. Consequently,
– the teeth are stronger because they are thicker at the base
– since the internal teeth have concave ﬂanks, the Hertzian pressure is smaller
– both shafts have the same sense of rotation; this has the consequence that
– the sliding velocity of tooth ﬂanks relative to each other is proportional not
to |ω1| + |ω2| , but to |ω1| −|ω2|
– the design is more compact because it has the size of the outer wheel
– in a given volume more power can be transmitted
– the inner wheel and the contact zone are shielded by the outer wheel.
A disadvantage is that many manufacturing methods available for external
gears cannot be used for internal gears.
Problems of undercutting occur when the diﬀerence n2−n1 of the numbers
of teeth is too small. From experience it is known that no undercutting occurs
if n2−n1 > 10 . Diﬀerences smaller than 10 are possible with a reduced tooth
height of the internal teeth.
Equations (16.62) and (16.63) for the angle of pressure α′ and for the dis-
tance D′ of wheel centers as function of addendum modiﬁcation is replaced
by the equations

The equation for α′ results from the condition that the tooth thickness d(r′

given by (16.60) equals the space width w(r′
2) between neighboring teeth on
wheel 2 and that the latter is given by (16.60) with the index 1 replaced by

16.1.8 Involute Helical Gearing
The pitch circles p1 , p2 and the base circles c1 , c2 (radii r01 , r02 ) shown
in Fig. 16.10 and the string A1A2 wound around the base circles are the front
views (cross sections) of pitch cylinders, of base cylinders c1 , c2 and of a
belt wound around the base cylinders. Figure 16.15 is a perspective view.
In the frame-ﬁxed x, y, z-system the moving planar section E of the belt is
deﬁned by the pressure angle α . The following statements repeat what has
been said in the context of Fig. 16.10 . Seen from an observer ﬁxed on c1
the trajectory of a belt-ﬁxed point B is an involute in the plane z = const
in which B is located and seen from an observer ﬁxed on c2 the trajectory
of B is another involute. At B the involutes are in tangential contact the

553
common tangent being normal to E . With points B located on a belt-ﬁxed
straight line parallel to the z-axis two conjugate involute tooth ﬂanks of spur
wheels with straight-line teeth are generated. In Fig. 16.15 the belt-ﬁxed
points B are located on a belt-ﬁxed straight line e which is making an angle
β0 against lines parallel to the z-axis. The involutes are shown for only two
points on this line. The conjugate tooth ﬂanks formed by the manifold of
involutes for all points of the line are surfaces h1 and h2 called involute
helicoids. Both helicoids are instantaneously in tangential contact along the
generating line e . The common tangent plane intersects E orthogonally.
This means that a helicoid is a ruled surface of the special kind called torse
(distribution parameter δ = 0 on every generator; see the end of Sec. 2.9.2).
In wrapping around the base cylinders the belt-ﬁxed line e is forming on
each base cylinder ci (i = 1, 2) a base helix Hi having the slope cot β0 .
From this it follows that every generator of the helicoid hi is tangent to Hi .
The base helices on the two base cylinders have opposite hands.
The unit vector n normal to the common tangent plane of h1 and h2
is located in E and normal to e . In the x, y, z-system it has the constant
coordinates
nx = sin α cos β0 ,
ny = cos α cos β0 ,
nz = −sin β0 .

(16.70)
In the absence of friction the resultant contact force has the frame-ﬁxed
direction of n . Let F be the magnitude of this force. Its torque about the
axis of wheel i (i = 1, 2) has magnitude Fr0i cos β0 . Equilibrium in the
state of constant angular velocities requires Mi −Fr0i cos β0 = 0 with Mi
being the external torque about the axis of wheel i . Thus, both direction
and magnitude of the resultant contact force are constant:
F =
Mi
r0i cos β0
n = const
(i = 1 or 2) .
(16.71)
In axial direction the force has the component F sin β0 = (M1/r01) tan β0 .
Each wheel must be supported in a bearing capable of carrying this axial load.
The axial component is zero if each wheel is composed of two symmetrical
sections, one with left-turning and the other with right-turning helicoids (so-
called double helical gearing).
An involute helical gear with base helix angle β0 can be cut by an ordinary
rack cutter used for cutting straight involute teeth. As in Fig. 16.12a the pitch
cylinder of the gear is in rolling contact with the pitch plane Π of the rack
cutter (in Fig. 16.12a the pitch line Π is the side view of the pitch plane).
The only diﬀerence is that the teeth t – t of the rack cutter must make an
angle β with the z-axis as is shown in Fig. 16.16 . This angle β is the helix
angle not on the base cylinder, but on the larger pitch cylinder of radius r .
The helix on this cylinder has the smaller slope

The rack cutter in Fig. 16.12a is speciﬁed by the pressure angle α = 20◦,
by the distance t which equals the circular pitch and by the addendum
m = t/π (the active tooth height is 2m ). In what follows, these quantities
are given the new names αn = 20◦, tn and mn = tn/π , respectively. The
index n points to the fact that these parameters are measured in the plane
n – n normal to the teeth of the rack cutter. In Fig. 16.16 the involute is
cut in the plane normal to the gear axis. The tooth height is in both planes
the same, i.e., mn = tn/π . The circular pitch and the pressure angle are
diﬀerent, however. They are now called t and α . The ﬁgure shows that
t =

From Fig. 16.10 it is known that involute tooth ﬂanks of spur gears have
the property to remain conjugate when the distance between the gear axes
is changed. It is this property which led to Eqs.(16.50) – (16.65) relating
addendum modiﬁcation to changes of tooth thickness and to changes of dis-
tance between gear axes. Involute helical gears with parallel axes, too, remain
conjugate when the distance between the gear axes is changed. The reason is
that in every cross section z= const two involute tooth ﬂanks are meshing.
Consequently, Eqs. (16.50) – (16.65) are valid also for helical involute gears
if the following rules are observed. Everywhere, t and α are the quanti-
ties deﬁned in (16.73). In (16.50), (16.64) and (16.65) the quantity m is the
tooth height mn . In contrast, in (16.52) m is introduced via (16.74). It is,
therefore, the quantity deﬁned by this equation. This is true also for (16.54),
(16.55), (16.60) and (16.61) which are derived from (16.52).

is an eﬀective means against undercutting. This is one of many advantages of
involute helical gears as compared with involute spur gears. Another advan-
tage is that the contact ratio can be made ≫1 by increasing β . Another
advantage is that gears with helical teeth develop less noise because the inset
of meshing is gradual rather than abrupt along the entire length of teeth.
End of example.
Up to now the case of external helical gearing has been considered. How-
ever, two gears with equal base helix angles β0 are meshing correctly also
in the case, when the larger wheel has internal gearing. As in the case of
internal straight involute teeth, the problem of undercutting requires special
investigations. And so does the problem of assembly in the case when the
diﬀerence n1 −n2 is small.
Involute Helicoid Analytically
Let x0(φ) and y0(φ) be the coordinates of a curve with the free parameter φ
in the plane z = 0 of an x, y, z-system. A surface called helicoid is generated
by subjecting this curve to a continuous screw displacement with axis z ,
angle of rotation ψ and pitch p . The helicoid has the coordinates
x(φ, ψ) = x0(φ) cos ψ −y0(φ) sin ψ ,
y(φ, ψ) = x0(φ) sin ψ + y0(φ) cos ψ ,

16.2 Skew Axes
In Sect. 12.2 the relative motion of two wheels rotating with constant angular
velocity ratio μ = ω2/ω1 = const about skew axes was shown to be a veloc-
ity screw. Its axis has the direction of the relative angular velocity ω2 −ω1
(Eq.(12.13)). The axis intersects orthogonally the common perpendicular of
the two wheel axes at a point determined by u(μ) . This scalar as well as the
pitch p(μ) of the screw are given in (12.18). Seen by an observer ﬁxed on
wheel i (i = 1, 2) the screw axis is sweeping out an hyperboloid of revolution
with a gorge circle of radius ri given in (12.20). Both hyperboloids have one
and the same imaginary semi-axis b given in (12.21). The hyperboloids are
in raccording motion sharing the frame-ﬁxed screw axis, the striction point
on the common perpendicular of the wheel axes and also the distribution pa-
rameter which is identical with b . The example given in Sect. 12.6.1 revealed
the following reciprocity relationship which is now stated as
Theorem 16.3. A constant gear ratio ω2/ω1 requires tooth ﬂanks to be
shaped such that wherever tangential contact of tooth ﬂanks is established the
common normal at the point of contact belongs to the linear complex having
the axis and the pitch of the relative velocity screw.
This theorem is the spatial generalization of Theorem 16.1 for plane motions
of spur gears. In Sect. 16.1.4 Reuleaux’s construction of conjugate tooth ﬂanks
for spur gears was explained (see Fig. 16.6). The spatial generalization of this
method is explained in the next section. For simplifying the comparison of
both methods the same notation for points, lines and angles is used.
16.2.1 Construction of Conjugate Flanks
In Fig. 16.18
P10 and P20 are the endpoints of the common perpendicular
of the axes of the raccording hyperboloids 1 and 2 . At P12 the axis of the
relative velocity screw is shown normal to the plane of the drawing (unit
vector n ). The axes of the hyperboloids (unit vectors n1 and n2 ) are tilted
against n through the angles α1 and α2 , respectively, deﬁned in Fig. 12.4
and in (12.16). The absolute values of the vectors r1 and r2 are the radii
of the gorge circles of the hyperboloids. Let ﬂank f1 on wheel 1 be some

16.2 Skew Axes
559
arbitrarily prescribed smooth surface subject only to the condition that the
normal to f1 at B1 (arbitrary) intersects the hyperboloid 1 . Let N1 be this
wheel-ﬁxed point of intersection. In Fig. 16.18 f1 is shown when wheels 1
and 2 are in some arbitrarily chosen initial position. To each pair (point
B1 , normal B1N1 ) a conjugate pair (point B2 , normal B2N2 ) of ﬂank f2
in the initial position of f2 is constructed as follows. Conjugate means that
( B1 , B1N1 ) and ( B2 , B2N2 ) are the points and normals which coincide
in the course of meshing at a certain point B . This point B is determined
by Theorem 16.3. In contrast to the planar case in Fig. 16.6, it cannot be
constructed graphically. Analytically it is determined as follows. From (2.25)
it is known that a line with Pl¨ucker vectors (v1 , w1) belongs to a linear
complex (a ; b) if
a · w1 + b · v1 = 0 .
(16.85)
The vectors are represented in the x, y, z-system shown in Fig. 12.4 which
has the origin at P12 , the x-axis along r1 and the z-axis along the axis of
the relative velocity screw. In this reference frame the vectors of the linear
complex are
a = n
and
b = p n
(see the text following (2.29)). The
displacement from B1 to B is a rotation through an unknown angle ϕ1
about n1 . Let z1(0) be the given position vector of B1 and z1(ϕ1) the
position vector of B . With the rotation tensor R(n1, ϕ1) deﬁned in (1.40)
z1(ϕ1) = r1 + R(n1, ϕ1) · (z1(0) −r1) .
(16.86)
Let v1(0) be the given unit vector along the normal B1N1 . By the same
rotation this vector is carried into the position
v1(ϕ1) = R(n1, ϕ1) · v1(0) .
(16.87)
This is the ﬁrst Pl¨ucker vector of the normal to the tooth ﬂanks at point B .
The second Pl¨ucker vector is w1(ϕ1) = z1(ϕ1) × v1(ϕ1) . Since the vectors
(z1(ϕ1)−r1) and v1(ϕ1) and, consequently, also their vector cross product
are ﬁxed on wheel 1 , this is
Fig. 16.18 Construction of ﬂank f2 conjugate to a given ﬂank f1

16 Theory of Gearing
w1(ϕ1) = r1 × R(n1, ϕ1) · v1(0) + R(n1, ϕ1) · (z1(0) −r1) × v1(0) . (16.88)
The vectors v1(ϕ1) , w1(ϕ1) , a = n and b = p n are substituted into
(16.85). The equation is then decomposed in the x, y, z-system. The vectors
r1 and n have the coordinate matrices [ r1 0 0 ]T and [ 0 0 1 ]T , respectively.
The tensor R(n1, ϕ1) has the coordinate matrix A12 given in (1.54) with
sin α1 and cos α1 from (12.16). The resulting equation for the unknown
angle ϕ1 has the form A cos ϕ1 + B sin ϕ1 = C with coeﬃcients A , B , C
satisfying the condition A2 +B2 −C2 > 0 for the existence of real solutions.
For comparison: The equivalent Eq.(16.23) for the planar case has the same
form. With the pertinent solution ϕ1 the position vector z2(0) of B2 and
the unit normal vector v2(0) at B2 are determined by subjecting z1(ϕ1)
and v1(ϕ1) to the rotation ϕ2 = −(n1/n2)ϕ1 about n2 . This is done by
Eqs.(16.86) and (16.87) with indices changed accordingly.
16.2.2 General Spatial Involute Gearing
Let h1 and h2 be two involute helicoids on skew axes. Each helicoid hi
(i = 1, 2) has its own base cylinder ci of radius r0i , its own base helix angle
β0i and its own angle αi which determines the radius ri = r0i/ cos αi of
the pitch cylinder pi (see Fig. 16.15). The pitch cylinder is rolling on the
pitch plane of the rack cutter used for producing the helicoid. Let h1 be
the helicoid on gear 1 in Fig. 16.15. The axis of h2 intersects the x-axis
orthogonally at a point x = d ≥r1 + r2 . The projected angle between the
two axes is called λ (rotation about the x-axis in the positive mathematical
sense). Thus, the x-axis is the common perpendicular of the axes, and d is
the minimal distance. The situation shown in Fig. 16.15 is the special case
β01 = β02 = β0 , α1 = α2 = α , d = r1 + r2 , λ = 0 .
Following Giovannozzi [9, 10] and without reference to Theorem 16.3 it is
shown that under certain conditions h1 and h2 are conjugate tooth ﬂanks.
In particular, it is shown that the distance d has no inﬂuence on any of the
angular relationships which follow. The reason is that involute helicoids are
torses. On every generator the tangent plane is the same for all points of this
generator.
Let P be a point of contact. For each of the two helicoids hi (i = 1, 2) the
statements made in the context of Fig. 16.15 are valid, namely: The contact
point P is located on a generator ei of hi in a plane Ei which is tangent
to the base cylinder ci and deﬁned by the angle αi . The generator ei is
making the base helix angle β0i with lines parallel to the axis of ci . The
contact normal at P lies in E1 as well as in E2 and it is normal to e1 as
well as to e2 . From the skewness of the axes it follows that h1 and h2 have
single-point contact and that the frame-ﬁxed line of intersection of E1 and

16.2 Skew Axes
561
E2 , referred to as g , is the common contact normal. According to (16.69)
the point ﬁxed on hi which is coinciding with P has, in the direction of g ,
a velocity component of magnitude vi = ωir0i cos β0i
(i = 1, 2) . From the
kinematical constraint v1 = v2 it follows that
ω2
ω1
= n1
n2
= r01 cos β01
r02 cos β02
.
(16.89)
When the helicoids rotating with this angular velocity ratio remain in contact,
the contact point P moves along g . Hence the frame-ﬁxed line g is the line of
contact. Being normal to h1 and to h2 it is the line of action of the normal
contact force which, therefore, is frame-ﬁxed, too. Another consequence of
(16.89) is that, depending on β01 and β02 , the wheel having the smaller
number of teeth may have the larger radius.
Tangential contact requires that at the point of contact the unit normal
vectors n1 of h1 and n2 of h2 satisfy the equation n2 = −n1 . The x, y, z-
coordinates of n1 are known from (16.68):
n1x = sin α1 cos β01 ,
n1y = cos α1 cos β01 ,
n1z = −sin β01 .

Following this rotation it has the coordinates

Hence
β2 −β1 = λ

or, with (16.73),

(16.103)
This equation shows that both gears must be cut by rack cutters with iden-
tical normal pressure angles αn . This condition and (16.97) together consti-
tute necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the two helicoids to be conjugate
tooth ﬂanks. If the crossing angle λ of the gear axes is prescribed, β1 and
β2 may be chosen positive, zero or negative subject only to (16.97). In the
case βi = 0 , gear i is a spur gear. The angles β1 , β2 and αn determine
the angles α1 and α2 . Equations (16.89) – (16.103) are the rules governing
general spatial involute gearing (title of Phillips’ book [14]). The equations
are independent of the shortest distance d of the wheel axes. So is the di-
rection of the line of contact g . Only the location of g in the x, y, z-system
depends on d . The line is laterally displaced when d is changed (all other
parameters held constant). In general, g does not intersect the x-axis. The
helicoids remain conjugate when the shortest distance d is changed. This
requires, of course, a change of tooth thickness.
In engineering the special case d = r1 + r2 is standard for gears with
zero addendum modiﬁcation. In this case, the pitch cylinders are in (sliding)
contact on the x-axis at the point x = r1 . In what follows, this point is
called P0 . The line g is passing through this point. Figure 16.19 shows in
projection along the x-axis the angular velocities ω1 and ω2 of the pitch
cylinders under the angle λ . The point P0 is in the plane of the drawing.
The cylinder c1 is below and the cylinder c2 is above this plane. The line t –
t stands for the coinciding teeth of two imaginary rack cutters, one in mesh
with gear 1 and the other in mesh with gear 2 . The ﬁgure is a generalization
of Fig. 16.16 which shows the special case λ = 0 . As in this ﬁgure the line
t – t is making the angle βi with the axis of gear i (i = 1, 2). At P0 the
pitch cylinders and the pitch planes of the associated rack cutters have the
velocities vi of magnitude riωi (i = 1, 2) in the directions shown. The
relative velocity v2 −v1 has the direction t – t of the teeth if β1 and β2 are

satisfying (16.97). Indeed, the sine law applied to the velocity triangle with
the angles λ , π/2+β1 and π/2−β2 states that r2ω2/ cos β1 = r1ω1/ cos β2 .
This is Eq.(16.99). By the ﬁgure it is conﬁrmed that the initially coinciding
teeth of both rack cutters are permanently coinciding and that the two gears
are permanently meshing. For the sliding velocity v2 −v1 the cosine law
yields the formula

into (16.99) yields for β1 and β2 the formulas
tan β2 =

β1 = β2 −λ .
(16.105)
The three quantities λ , ω2/ω1 and r2/r1 are free design parameters. If, for
example, λ and ω2/ω1 are prescribed, the third parameter r2/r1 can be
chosen such that the sliding velocity in (16.104) is below an acceptable level.
Gear i (i = 1, 2) has an addendum cylinder of radius rai = ri +mn . The
contact line g passing through P0 intersects the cylinder 1 at a point P1
and the cylinder 2 at a point P2 . The gears must have axial lengths ℓ1 and
ℓ2 and positions on their shafts such that in the course of meshing of two
tooth ﬂanks the contact point can move all the way from P1 to P2 . Lengths
larger than ℓ1 and ℓ2 are unnecessary.
In (16.48) the contact ratio was given for spur gears with involute teeth.
It is left to the reader to show that in the case of skew axes the contact ratio

Planar Four-Bar Mechanism
The solid lines in Fig. 17.1 are the links of a planar four-bar mechanism or
brieﬂy planar four-bar. The link lengths ℓ(base or ﬁxed link), r1 (input

whether individual links can rotate relative to others full cycle (i.e., unlim-
ited) or through an angle smaller than 2π . The link lengths also determine
the so-called transfer function relating the output angle ψ to the input angle
ϕ . The time derivative of this function yields the transmission ratio i = ˙ϕ/ ˙ψ
as function of ϕ . The transfer function and the transmission ratio depend on
three parameters only, namely, on r1/ℓ, r2/ℓand a/ℓ. Points ﬁxed in the
plane of the coupler move along coupler curves. The shapes of these curves
depend on six parameters, namely, on the four link lengths and, in addi-
tion, on two coordinates of the coupler-ﬁxed point in the coupler plane. The
coupler plane as a whole undergoes a translatory-rotatory motion through
a continuum of positions which depends on the four link lengths. The said
dependencies which are the subject of the following sections are highly com-
plicated. It is this complexity in combination with simplicity of design which
makes the planar four-bar the most important linkage in engineering.

17 Planar Four-Bar Mechanism
In many machines a certain desired property is achieved by combining a
four-bar with additional elements. A typical example is shown in Fig. 17.2 .
Without the motor-driven crank mechanism MDB drawn with dashed lines
the mechanism is a four-bar A0ABB0 with base A0B0. None of its links is
able to rotate full cycle relative to the base. When this four-bar is moving
through its entire range, the coupler-ﬁxed point C traces the dotted coupler
curve. A section of this curve is a very good straight-line approximation. The
combination of the four-bar A0ABB0 with the crank mechanism MDB results
in a machine in which C is moving periodically back and forth the straight
section when the crank is rotating. Point C can be used as guide for the
piston of the pump at an oil-well.

17.1 Grashof Condition
In this section answers are given to the following questions. Through which
angle can two neighboring links of a four-bar rotate relative to each other?
Under which condition is this angle unlimited? In this case, one link is said
to be fully rotating relative to the other. For every possible angle ϕ between
two neighboring links there exist two positions of the four-bar (see Fig. 17.1).
In some four-bars the transition from one of these positions into the other can
be achieved by a continuous motion. In others the transition is possible only
by disconnecting and reassembling the four-bar. Under which conditions is
disconnection and reassembly necessary? The properties addressed by these
questions do not depend on which link is chosen as ﬁxed link and which
as input link. Arbitrarily, the angle ϕ of the link of length r1 against the

Fig. 17.3 Limit positions of a four-bar
link of length ℓis investigated. Extremal values of ϕ in limit positions are
denoted φ . In Figs. 17.3a,b,c all possible conﬁgurations in limit positions are
shown. All of them are characterized by collinearity of the other two links of
the four-bar. For the extremal angles φ1 and φ2 the cosine law yields the
expressions
cos φ1,2 = r2
1 + ℓ2 −(r2 ∓a)2
2r1ℓ
.
(17.1)
The links are fully rotating relative to each other if cos φ1 ≥+1 as well as
cos φ2 ≤−1 . These conditions are
a)
|r1 −ℓ| ≥|r2 −a| ,
b)
r1 + ℓ≤r2 + a .
(17.2)
In the special case of four identical link lengths ℓ= r1 = r2 = a
φ1 = 0 ,
φ2 = π . This means that neighboring links can rotate full cycle relative to
each other.
In what follows, it is assumed that at least two link lengths are diﬀerent.
Let ℓmin and ℓmax ̸= ℓmin be the smallest and the largest, respectively, of
the four link lengths, and let ℓ′ and ℓ′′ ( ℓ′ < ℓ′′ or ℓ′ = ℓ′′ or ℓ′ > ℓ′′ ) be
the other two link lengths so that
ℓmin ≤ℓ′, ℓ′′ ≤ℓmax
(ℓmax ̸= ℓmin) .
(17.3)
Grashof1 [17] is the author of
Theorem 17.1. The link of length ℓmin is fully rotating relative to all other
links if and only if the condition
ℓmin + ℓmax ≤ℓ′ + ℓ′′

is satisﬁed. Then these other links are fully rotating relative to the link with
ℓmin , but they are not fully rotating relative to each other. If condition (17.4)
is not satisﬁed, no link is fully rotating relative to any other link.
Proof: The following statements are easily veriﬁed if not obvious.
I. Equations (17.1) as well as conditions (17.2a,b) are invariant with respect
to an interchange of r1 and ℓand also of r2 and a .
II. If neither r1 nor ℓis
ℓmin , one of the conditions (17.2a), (17.2b) is
violated.
III. If either (r1, ℓ) or (ℓ, r1) is the pair ( ℓmin, ℓmax) , condition (17.2a) is
satisﬁed, and condition (17.2b) is condition (17.4).
IV. If either (r1, ℓ) or (ℓ, r1) is the pair ( ℓmin, ℓ′) , condition (17.2b) is sat-
isﬁed, and condition (17.2a) is condition (17.4).
The combination of statements I to IV proves Grashof’s theorem. According
to this theorem four-bars are divided into
- four-bars satisfying Grashof’s condition; these four-bars are further sub-
divided
- general case:
ℓmin + ℓmax < ℓ′ + ℓ′′
- special case:
ℓmin + ℓmax = ℓ′ + ℓ′′
- four-bars not satisfying Grashof’s condition, i.e., four-bars with
ℓmin +
ℓmax > ℓ′ + ℓ′′.
Matters are even more complicated due to the fact that in engineering prac-
tice a particular link of a four-bar is declared to be the ﬁxed link. A neigh-
boring link (input link or output link) is referred to as crank or as rocker
depending on whether or not it is fully rotating relative to the ﬁxed link.
Depending on the behavior of input link and output link a four-bar is either
a double-crank or a crank-rocker or a double-rocker. It is obvious that a four-
bar not satisfying Grashof’s condition is a double-rocker. On the other hand,
a four-bar satisfying Grashof’s condition may be either a double-crank or a
crank-rocker or a double-rocker. Details are worked out in what follows.
Four-Bars Satisfying Grashof’s Inequality Condition ℓmin + ℓmax < ℓ′ + ℓ′′ .
For demonstration the link lengths (3, 5, 6, 7) are used which satisfy Grashof’s
condition (3 + 7 < 5 + 6) . In Fig. 17.4a the ﬁxed link is the shortest link.
This link (and only this link) is fully rotating relative to all other links. In
other words: The input link, the output link and the coupler are fully rotating
relative to the ﬁxed link. Hence the four-bar is a double-crank. For a single
input angle the two existing positions of the four-bar are shown (one of them
with dashed lines).
In Fig. 17.4b the input link is the shortest link. Only this link is fully
rotating relative to all other links. Hence the four-bar is a crank-rocker. The
four-bar is shown in all four limit positions of the rocker. The angular range of
the rocker consists of two sectors < 180◦which are arranged symmetrically
to the base line. The base line is outside these sectors. For a single input
angle the two existing positions of the four-bar are shown (one of them with

crank (a) with all links fully rotating. Crank-rocker (b) with fully rotating input crank.

dashed lines). In these two positions the output link is located on opposite
sides of the base line.
Figure 17.4c diﬀers from Fig. 17.4a in that the ﬁxed link and the coupler
are interchanged. The coupler is the shortest link. Only the coupler is fully
rotating relative to all other links. The four-bar is referred to as double-rocker
of ﬁrst kind. The ﬁgure shows the limit positions of both rockers. The angular
range of each rocker is a single sector. The sectors of both rockers are on one
and the same side of the base line. For a single input angle the two existing
positions of the four-bar are shown (one of them with dashed lines). In these
two positions the output link is located on one and the same side of the base
line.
In Figs. 17.4a , b and c reﬂection of every possible position in the base
line is another possible position.
Four-Bars not Satisfying Grashof’s Condition
For demonstration the link lengths (4, 5, 6, 8) are used which do not satisfy
Grashof’s condition (4+8 > 5+6) . Not a single link is fully rotating relative
to the ﬁxed link. These four-bars are referred to as double-rockers of second
kind. Figure 17.5a shows the limit positions of both rockers. The angular
range of each rocker is a single sector which is symmetrical to the base line.
For a single input angle the two existing positions of the four-bar are shown
(one of them with dashed lines). In Figs. 17.5a,b,c the four given lengths
are given to diﬀerent links of the four-bar. It is seen that depending on this
distribution the ﬁxed link is inside the angular range of either both rockers
(Fig. 17.5a) or of a single rocker (Fig. 17.5b) or of no rocker (Fig. 17.5c).

17 Planar Four-Bar Mechanism
Fig. 17.5 Three double-rockers of second kind with diﬀerent distributions of the link
lengths (4, 5, 6, 8). No link is fully rotating
For demonstration the link lengths (1, 3, 4, 6) are used which satisfy the
condition that 1 + 6 = 3 + 4 . Depending on whether the shortest link is the
ﬁxed link or the input link or the coupler the four-bar is either a double-crank
or a crank-rocker or a double-rocker of ﬁrst kind, respectively (compare Figs.
17.4a, b, c). In this respect there is no diﬀerence to the general case of four-
bars satisfying the inequality condition ℓmin + ℓmax < ℓ′ + ℓ′′ . The equality
ℓmin + ℓmax = ℓ′ + ℓ′′ has the consequence that the four-bar is foldable. In
a folded position all four links are collinear. Two diﬀerent kinds of foldable
four-bars have to be distinguished:
- ﬁrst kind:
r1 + a = r2 + ℓ
(Fig. 17.6a)
- second kind: r1 + r2 = a + ℓ
(Fig. 17.6b).
With link lengths (1, 3, 4, 6) the following foldable four-bars (ℓ, r1, a, r2)
can be formed:
Foldable four-bars of ﬁrst kind: Two double-cranks (1, 3, 4, 6),
(1, 4, 3, 6);
four crank-rockers (4, 1, 6, 3), (3, 1, 6, 4),
(6, 1, 4, 3),
(6, 1, 3, 4);
two double-rockers of ﬁrst kind (4, 6, 1, 3),
(3, 6, 1, 4) ;
Foldable four-bars of second kind: One double-crank (1, 3, 6, 4);
two crank-rockers (3, 1, 4, 6),
(4, 1, 3, 6);
one double-rocker of ﬁrst kind (6, 4, 1, 3).
Example: The foldable four-bar of ﬁrst kind in Fig. 17.6a is the double-
rocker with (ℓ, r1, a, r2) = (4, 6, 1, 3) , and the foldable four-bar of second
kind in Fig. 17.6b is the double-rocker with (ℓ, r1, a, r2) = (6, 4, 1, 3) . For
a single angle ϕ of the input link the two associated positions of coupler and
output link are shown. The points P1 and P2 are the instantaneous centers
of rotation of the coupler in these positions. Let x be the coordinate of P1
or P2. In positions suﬃciently close to the folded position ( ϕ = ψ = 0 in
Fig. 17.6a and ϕ = π −ψ = 0 in Fig. 17.6b) the following approximations
are valid:

Instantaneous centers of rotation P1 and P2 of the coupler tend toward M1 and M2 when
the four-bar is folding
x tan ϕ ≈
"(x −ℓ) tan ψ
(foldable four-bars of ﬁrst kind)
(ℓ−x) tan(π −ψ)
(foldable four-bars of second kind).
(17.5)
In Sect. 17.2 these approximations are used for determining instantaneous
centers of rotation of the coupler in folded positions when intersection points
P1 and P2 do not exist. End of example.
In the folded position motion is possible in two ways with either ˙ψ/ ˙ϕ > 0
or
˙ψ/ ˙ϕ < 0 . In engineering applications of foldable four-bars provisions
must be made either to avoid the folded position or to pass through it with
prescribed sense of rotation.
Consider again Figs. 17.3a,b,c . When the input link of length r1 is moving
away from its limit position, the joint connecting coupler and output link is
free to move in two diﬀerent directions as is indicated by arrows. From this
the following conclusion is drawn. Two positions of a four-bar which are
associated with an arbitrarily given angle of a rocker can be reached one
from the other by a continuous motion. The four-bars in Figs. 17.4a,c as well
as those in Figs. 17.5a,b,c have this property. In contrast, two positions of
a four-bar which are associated with an arbitrarily given angle of a crank
cannot be reached one from the other by a continuous motion, but only by
disconnection and reassembly (Figs. 17.4b,c). Exception: Foldable four-bars.
Transition from one position to the other is possible via the folded position.
17.2 Transfer Function
From Figs. 17.5 and 17.4 it is known that to every position (ϕ, ψ) of the four-
bar the position symmetrical to the base line A0B0 with angles (−ϕ, −ψ)
exists. This symmetry is found in all subsequent equations. The transfer
function determines ψ as function of ϕ . First, implicit forms f(ϕ, ψ) = 0
of the transfer function are formulated. Starting point are the coordinates of

xA = r1 cos ϕ ,
xB = ℓ+ r2 cos ψ ,
yA = r1 sin ϕ ,
yB =
r2 sin ψ .
 
(17.6)
The constant length a of the coupler requires that (xB−xA)2+(yB−yA)2 = a2
or explicitly
(ℓ+ r2 cos ψ −r1 cos ϕ)2 + (r2 sin ψ −r1 sin ϕ)2 −a2 = 0 .
(17.7)
This is already the desired equation f(ϕ, ψ) = 0 . Reformulation gives it the
form
f = 2r2(ℓ−r1 cos ϕ) cos ψ−2r1r2 sin ϕ sin ψ−2ℓr1 cos ϕ+r2

or alternatively

2 −a2 = 0 . (17.9)
Equation (17.8) has the form
A(ϕ) cos ψ + B(ϕ) sin ψ = C(ϕ)

with coeﬃcients
A = 2r2(ℓ−r1 cos ϕ), B = −2r1r2 sin ϕ , C = 2r1ℓcos ϕ−(r2

These are the Eqs.(17.1). The angles are the limit angles of the input link
known from Figs. 17.3a,b,c .
This section is closed with an application of (17.9) to foldable four-bars
(see Figs. 17.6a,b). In the process of folding the instantaneous centers of
rotation P1 and P2 of the coupler tend toward points M1 and M2 on the
base line. These points are determined by combining (17.5) and (17.9). First,
foldable four-bars of ﬁrst kind are considered. In the limit ϕ →0 , ψ →0
(17.5) yields x/(x −ℓ) = ψ/ϕ . With ℓ= r1 −r2 + a (17.9) becomes
r1(r1+a)+r2(r2−a)−r1r2[1+cos(ϕ−ψ)]−(r1−r2+a)(r1 cos ϕ−r2 cos ψ) = 0 .
(17.17)
Taylor expansion up to second-order terms and division through ϕ2 produces
for λ = ψ/ϕ = x/(x −ℓ) the quadratic equation λ2r2(r2 −a) −2r1r2λ =
−r1(r1 + a) . The solutions λ1,2 and the associated coordinates x1,2 of M1
and M2 are
λ1,2 = r1r2 ± √r1r2aℓ
r2(r2 −a)
,
x1,2 =
λ1,2
λ1,2 −1 ℓ.
(17.18)
The solution for foldable four-bars of second kind is obtained in a similar
way. In (17.9) the substitutions ψ = π −α and ℓ= r1 + r2 −a are made.
Following this, a Taylor expansion up to second-order terms is made. The
result is a quadratic equation for λ = α/ϕ = x/(ℓ−x) . The solutions λ1,2
are identical with those in (17.18):
λ1,2 = r1r2 ± √r1r2aℓ
r2(r2 −a)

x1,2 =

Examples: The link lengths of Fig. 17.6a yield x1 ≈5.17 , x2 ≈10.8 and
those of Fig. 17.6b yield x1 ≈4.64 , x2 ≈2.21 . These are the points M1 and
M2 shown in the ﬁgure. End of examples.

17.3 Interchange of Input Link and Fixed Link
In Fig. 17.8 the four-bar A0ABB0 with link lengths ℓ, r1 , a , r2 is called
four-bar F . Dashed lines parallel to the ﬁxed link and to the input link
deﬁne the point P . The quadrilateral B0PAB is drawn one more time in
dotted lines. The dotted quadrilateral is called four-bar F∗. Its ﬁxed link
has length r1 , and its input link has length ℓ. Both four-bars have the same
coupler and the same output link. If F is a foldable four-bar, also F∗is
foldable. If F is a double-rocker of ﬁrst kind (of second kind), also F∗is a
double-rocker of ﬁrst kind (of second kind). If F is a double-crank, F∗is
either a double-crank or a crank-rocker. If F is a crank-rocker, F∗is either
a double-crank (if ﬁxed link and crank are interchanged) or a crank-rocker (if
ﬁxed link and rocker are interchanged). Example: Let F be the crank-rocker
in Fig. 17.4b . Interchange of ﬁxed link and crank produces the double-crank
of Fig. 17.4a .
In Fig. 17.8 F and F∗have one and the same input angle ϕ . The relation
between the output angles ψ and ψ∗is seen to be
ψ + ψ∗≡ϕ + π .
(17.20)
For a given angle ϕ Eqs.(17.12) determine in the four-bar F two angles ψ1
and ψ2 and in the four-bar F∗with coeﬃcients
A∗= 2r2(r1 −ℓcos ϕ) ,
B∗= −2ℓr2 sin ϕ , C∗= C two angles ψ∗
1 and ψ∗
2 . The coordination of the
pairs of angles is as follows: ψ1 +ψ∗
2 ≡ϕ+π . This is veriﬁed by substituting

Its dependency on ϕ is found by the same method that was used for ψ . Point
B has coordinates xB = r1 cos ϕ+a cos χ and yB = r1 sin ϕ+a sin χ . These
expressions are substituted into the constraint equation (xB −ℓ)2 +y2
B = r2
2 .
This results in the equation
¯A cos χ + ¯B sin χ = ¯C ,
(17.21)

¯B = 2r1a sin ϕ ,
¯C = 2r1ℓcos ϕ−(r2

These coeﬃcients are obtained from those in (17.11) by interchanging r2 and

(17.23)
The exponent k in this equation must be the same as in (17.12). Only then
the constraint equation r1 cos ϕ + a cos χ = ℓ+ r2 cos ψ is satisﬁed.
The angle χ reaches a stationary value (maximum or minimum) when
the angular velocity
˙χ of the coupler is zero. This is the case when the
instantaneous center of rotation P30 , i.e., the intersection of input link and
output link, is at inﬁnity. Figure 17.9 shows that this is possible in two
positions. Let ϕ = ϕ∞and χstat be the associated angles. One position
is characterized by
ψ = ϕ∞and the other by
ψ = ϕ∞+ π . Equation
(17.10) yields for cos ϕ∞the two expressions given below. Expressions for the
associated stationary angles χstat are obtained from the cosine law applied
to the triangles shown in Fig. 17.9 :
cos ϕ∞= ℓ2 −a2 + (r1 ∓r2)2
2ℓ(r1 ∓r2)
,
cos χstat = ℓ2 + a2 −(r1 ∓r2)2
2aℓ
. (17.24)
The angles ϕ∞have a kinematical interpretation. They determine the direc-
tions of asymptotes of the ﬁxed centrode of the coupler. The centrode has no
asymptotes if both cosines have absolute values > 1 , i.e., if the conditions
(ℓ−a)2 > (r1 −r2)2 and (ℓ+ a)2 < (r1 + r2)2 are satisﬁed. This is the

17 Planar Four-Bar Mechanism
Fig. 17.9 Stationary values of the angle χ occur when the cranks are parallel
case if and only if the coupler is fully rotating. These four-bars are either
double-cranks (Fig. 17.4a) or double-rockers of ﬁrst kind (Fig. 17.4c). In Ex.
6 of Sect. 15.1.2 centrodes of couplers of four-bars with special link lengths
were investigated.
In Fig. 17.7 the transmission angle μ of a four-bar is deﬁned. Its depen-
dency on ϕ is obtained as follows. The length of the diagonal starting from
A is expressed by means of the cosine law once in terms of cos ϕ and once
in terms of cos μ . The identity of these expressions results in
cos μ = 2r1ℓcos ϕ −(r2
1 + ℓ2) + r2
2 + a2
2r2a
.
(17.25)
Extremal values of μ are obtained from (17.1) by interchanging (r1, ℓ) and
(r2, a) :
cos μstat = r2
2 + a2 −(ℓ∓r1)2
2r2a
.
(17.26)
In positions with these extremal values the input link and the ﬁxed link are
collinear (see Fig. 17.3). In phases of motion in which the coupler is required
to transmit a large torque to the output link the transmission angle μ should
diﬀer from π/2 as little as possible. In other words: | cos μ| should be as small
as possible.
17.5 Transmission Ratio. Angular Acceleration of
Output Link
The angular velocity ratio i = ˙ϕ/ ˙ψ is called transmission ratio of the four-
bar. In what follows, the inverse value 1/i = ˙ψ/ ˙ϕ is represented in geometric
and in analytical form. The geometric form is obtained from (15.6). Let the
ﬁxed link, the input link and the output link be links 0 , 1 and 2 , respec-

Here, x12(ϕ) is the coordinate of the instantaneous center P12 along the base

one at the center P20 . Over the ξ -axis thus deﬁned the ratio 1/i is plotted
at the center P12 .

The expression cos ϕ−p2 in (17.35) is zero only if the conditions ϕ = 0 and
r1 = ℓare satisﬁed which imply that also r2 = a . The square root in (17.35)

This is Eq.(17.1) deﬁning the angles shown in Figs. 17.3a,b,c .
With the exception of p1 all constants in (17.36) are invariant with respect
to an interchange of base length ℓand input link length r1 . Because of the
ﬁrst Eq.(17.37) this is true also for (p1 −p2)2 . A relation between the ratios

17.6 Stationary Values of the Transmission Ratio
In this section geometrical and analytical methods are used for determin-
ing those input angles ϕ for which the ratio 1/i in (17.35) and hence the
transmission ratio i itself attains stationary values. Starting from Fig. 17.10
Freudenstein [14] discovered the following geometrical relationship. Imagine
that the input link is moving with ˙ϕ > 0 through its entire angular range. In
the course of this motion the instantaneous center P12 moves along the ξ -
axis. Whenever it has zero velocity, the ratio 1/i attains a stationary value.
This is a consequence of the monotonicity property of the function 1/i(ξ)
shown in the ﬁgure. The velocity of P12 is zero if and only if the coupler-
ﬁxed point momentarily coinciding with P12 has a velocity in the direction
of the coupler (labeled body 3 ). Then the center P30 of the coupler lies on
the normal to the coupler erected in P12 . In other words: In positions of
the four-bar with a stationary value of 1/i the lines P12P30 and P31P32
are mutually orthogonal2. Figure 17.11 shows two diﬀerent four-bars in such
positions.
If a stationary value occurs at ϕ = 0 or at ϕ = π , P12 and P30 are
located on the base line, and the coupler is orthogonal to the base line. Then
the parameters satisfy the condition

2 .
 
(17.41)
In the vicinity of an angle ϕ for which 1/i has a stationary value the angle
between the lines P12P30 and P31P32 is very sensitive to changes of ϕ . The
desired angle ϕ can, therefore, be determined graphically rather precisely
by checking the orthogonality. In order to determine for a given four-bar
all positions with a stationary value of 1/i the four-bar and the center P12
must be drawn for a number of (monotonically increasing) angles ϕ over the
entire possible range φ1 ≤ϕ ≤φ2 . A stationary value of 1/i is passed every
time the moving center P12 changes its sense of direction along the ξ -axis
(jumps from ∞to −∞do not count as changes of sense of direction). Once
a position is known approximately it can be improved by checking the angle
between the lines P12P30 and P31P32 .
Example: For the double-crank in Fig. 17.4a this investigation reveals that
stationary values of 1/i occur in the two positions shown in Fig. 17.12a with
ϕ ≈9◦and with ϕ ≈95◦. With the coordinate of P12 (17.27) yields for the
position ϕ ≈9◦a maximum (1/i)max ≈2.7 and for the position ϕ ≈95◦
a minimum (1/i)min ≈0.42 .
For the crank-rocker of Fig. 17.4b the same investigation can be made.
This is unnecessary, however, because this four-bar is obtained from the pre-
viously investigated one by interchanging the ﬁxed link and the input link.
From (17.38) it follows that two four-bars thus related have stationary values
of 1/i for one and the same angles ϕ . Furthermore, these stationary values
add up to one. If the stationary value is a maximum in one of the four-bars, it
is a minimum in the other and vice versa. Hence the crank-rocker of Fig. 17.4b
has at ϕ ≈9◦a minimum (1/i)min ≈−1.7 and at ϕ ≈95◦a maximum
(1/i)max ≈0.58 . Figure 17.12b shows the crank-rocker in these positions.
End of example.
In what follows, two analytical methods for determining stationary values
of 1/i are described. Method 1 is a direct method based on (17.35). With
the abbreviation x = cos ϕ it is written in the form

and Q′ = −x/Q are substituted. The resulting
equation is multiplied by PQ . This eliminates the case sin ϕ = 0 . Whether

The special case r1 = ℓis characterized by p1 = p2 = 1 and, therefore, by
the third-order equation
(p3−1)(1+x)[λ2−(x−p4)2]+(x−p3)[p4(1+x2)+x(λ2−p2
4−1)] = 0 . (17.45)
The equation is quadratic if, in addition, also a = ℓ.
In the general case r1 ̸= ℓ, (17.44) is squared. The squared equation is
invariant with respect to the interchange of r1 and ℓ(see the comments
following (17.36) and (17.37)). Because of the sign ± no extraneous roots
are introduced by squaring. Equation (17.44) with the positive sign has the
meaningless root x = p2 > 1 . This is veriﬁed with the help of (17.37). From
this it follows that the squared equation is divisible by (x −p2)2 . Following
this division it is a sixth-order equation. The division is performed in two
steps. Squaring results in the equation

The equation is of ﬁfth order if a = ℓand/or a = r1 . Only real roots
|x| ≤1 are signiﬁcant. For every such root it is checked to which sign in
(17.44) the root belongs. With the same sign (17.42) and (17.12) determine
the corresponding stationary value of 1/i and the angle ψ .
Example: With the parameters of the double-crank in Fig. 17.4a as well
as with those of the crank-rocker in Fig. 17.4b (17.51) has the four real
roots x = cos ϕ ≈−0.084 ,
0.9882 , 1.11 and
4.02 . The ﬁrst two roots
determine the angles ϕ ≈94.8◦and ϕ ≈8.8◦, respectively. These are the
angles shown in Figs. 17.12a and b . End of example.
The second (historically the ﬁrst) analytical method for determining sta-
tionary values of 1/i is due to Freudenstein [14]. Also this method leads to
a sixth-order equation. The method starts out from Fig. 17.10 and from the
coupler curve traced by a point C ﬁxed on the coupler line P31P32 . Let
η = const be the coordinate of this point along the coupler line ( η = 0 , when

17.6 Stationary Values of the Transmission Ratio
585
C is at P31 and η > 0 , when C and P32 are on the same side of P31 ).
In Sect. 17.8.3 the equation of the coupler curve in the x, y -system of Fig.
17.7 is given. In what follows, only the coordinates of the intersection points
of the curve with the x -axis are needed. They are the roots of Eq.(17.100)
which is cubic with respect to x and to η :
(η −a)(x −ℓ)(x2 + η2 −r2
1) −ηx[(x −ℓ)2 + (η −a)2 −r2
2] = 0 .
(17.53)
The corresponding angle ϕ is determined by the cosine law:
cos ϕ = x2 + r2
1 −η2
2r1x
.
(17.54)
In Sect. 17.8.4 it is pointed out that not every real root x of (17.53) represents
an intersection point of the coupler-curve with the x -axis. A root represents a
singular point without kinematical signiﬁcance if it is associated with values
| cos ϕ| > 1 . In what follows, only those roots are of interest which yield
values | cos ϕ| ≤1 .
Let now C be the coupler-ﬁxed point which coincides with P12 when
the four-bar is in a position with a stationary value of 1/i . In Fig. 17.13
this situation is shown. The coordinate η of this point is associated with a
solution x of (17.53) which is equal to the stationary value of the coordinate
x12 of the center P12 . Although x12 and x have diﬀerent deﬁnitions, x as
function of η has the same stationary value. From this it follows that the
implicit derivative of (17.53) with respect to η is valid with dx/dη = 0 .
This is the equation
(x −ℓ)(x2 + η2 −r2
1) −x[(x −ℓ)2 + (η −a)2 −r2
2] −2ℓη(η −a) = 0 . (17.55)
This equation and (17.53) together determine the unknowns x and η . De-

1/i . The coupler point C
momentarily coinciding with P12 has coordinates x and η

17 Planar Four-Bar Mechanism
coupling leads to the desired sixth-order equation. This decoupling is achieved
in several steps. First, (17.55) is multiplied by η and then (17.53) is sub-
tracted. This results in the equation
a(x −ℓ)(x2 + η2 −r2
1) −2ℓη2(η −a) = 0 .
(17.56)
This equation and (17.55) are rewritten by introducing the dimensionless
variable ξ = x/ℓalready known and the new dimensionless variable ν = η/a .
The new equations for the unknowns ξ and ν are
ℓ2ξ2 −ξ(ℓ2 + a2 + r2

2) + r2
1 + a2[−3ν2 + 2ν(1 + ξ)] = 0 ,
(17.57)
ℓ2(ξ3 −ξ2) + r2
1(1 −ξ) + a2[−2ν3 + ν2(1 + ξ)] = 0 .
(17.58)
In order to get a linear equation for ν (17.57) is multiplied by (λ1+λ2ν) and
then added to (17.58). The free coeﬃcients λ1 and λ2 are then determined
such that the coeﬃcients of ν3 and ν2 equal zero. This yields two linear
equations for λ1 and λ2 . Their solutions are λ1 = −(1+ξ)/9 , λ2 = −2/3 .
The resulting linear equation for ν has the solution

C0 , C1 and C2 are obtained from C6 , C5 and C4 , respectively, by inter-

x = ℓξ and η = aν (17.54) determines the corresponding angle ϕ . The
corresponding stationary value of 1/i is given by (17.27): 1/i = ξ/(ξ −1) .
Consider again two four-bars resulting one from the other by interchanging
the link lengths r1 and ℓ. Let (17.60) be the conditional equation for one of
these four-bars. The equation for the other four-bar is C0ξ6 +C1ξ5 +C2ξ4 +
C3ξ3 + C4ξ2 + C5ξ + C6 = 0 . If ξ is a root of one equation, 1/ξ is root
of the other equation. With both roots (17.59) and (17.54) determine one
and the same angle ϕ . For both roots the corresponding quantities 1/i are
calculated from (17.27). These two quantities add up to one.
It is seen that C6 = 0 if a = ℓand that C0 = 0 if a = r1 . In either
case (17.60) is of ﬁfth order. Under the same conditions also the previous
method resulted in a ﬁfth-order equation (see (17.52)). In the case r1 = ℓ,
the previous method resulted in the third-order Eq.(17.45). With the present
method this case yields the identities C6 = C0 , C5 = C1 and C4 = C2 .
Equation (17.60) then has the form
C0ξ6 + C1ξ5 + C2ξ4 + C3ξ3 + C2ξ2 + C1ξ + C0 = 0 .
(17.62)
If ξ is a root, also 1/ξ is a root. Also the quadratic equation ξ2 +bξ +1 = 0
has this property. Hence there exist coeﬃcients b1 , b2 , b3 such that (17.62)
has the form
C0(ξ2 + b1ξ + 1)(ξ2 + b2ξ + 1)(ξ2 + b3ξ + 1) = 0 .
(17.63)
The determination of b1 , b2 , b3 by comparison of coeﬃcients requires solving
a cubic equation.
17.7 Transmission of Forces and Torques
Transmission of motion is not the only purpose of mechanisms. Equally im-
portant is transmission of forces and torques. In what follows, the state of
equilibrium of an arbitrary planar or spatial single-degree-of-freedom mecha-
nism is investigated. The planar four-bar is just an example. For every mech-
anism the input variable is called ϕ , and the output variable is called ψ .
Let, furthermore, M1 be the driving torque applied to the input link, and let
M2 be the counteracting torque applied to the output link. Thus, a torque
M1 > 0 is accelerating the mechanism and a torque M2 > 0 is decelerating
it. In a state of equilibrium the ratio M2/M1 has a certain value. It is deter-
mined from the equilibrium condition. According to the principle of virtual
power this is the equation
M1δ ˙ϕ + (−M2)δ ˙ψ = 0 .
(17.64)

588
17 Planar Four-Bar Mechanism
From the deﬁnition of the transmission ratio i = ˙ϕ/ ˙ψ it follows that δ ˙ψ =
δ ˙ϕ/i . Therefore, the equilibrium condition is (M1 −M2/i)δ ˙ϕ = 0 . Hence
M2
M1
= i .
(17.65)
This equation is valid in the more general sense that ϕ and ψ are generalized
coordinates (for example, angles or cartesian coordinates), and that M1 , M2
are the associated generalized forces (torques or forces).
In a mechanism for the generation of large forces or torques the trans-
mission ratio i should be as large as possible. Typical examples are shears,
prongs and clamping devices of various kinds. In what follows, the shears
shown in Figs. 17.14a – d are investigated. Each of them is a four-bar. The
input and output variables are the opening widths x1 and x2 between the
points of application of the hand forces F1 and the cutting forces F2 , re-
spectively. In each case the equilibrium condition (17.65) is
F2
F1
= ˙x1
˙x2
.
(17.66)
In each case the ratio of forces is to be expressed in terms of the lengths given
in the ﬁgures.
Solution: Since x1 and x2 describe relative positions, it is unnecessary to de-
clare any particular link as ﬁxed link. In Table 17.1 the velocities ˙x1 and ˙x2
are expressed in terms of relative angular velocities (positive counterclock-
wise). These expressions are obvious from the ﬁgures. In each expression

the two relative angular velocities are related through a constraint equation.
These equations have the following forms.
(a)
˙x3 = −ℓ2ω10 = −ℓ3ω23 ,
(b)
The constraint ˙x3 = 0 means that ℓ2ω10 −(ℓ2 + ℓ3)ω20 = 0 ,
(c)
˙x3 = −ℓ3ω10 = −(ℓ2 + ℓ3)ω23 ,
(d)
In Fig. 17.14d instantaneous centers are shown. From (15.6) it fol-
lows that
ω10/ω30 = L4/L3
and
ω23/ω30 = L1/L2
and, consequently,
ω10/ω23 = L2L4/(L1L3) .
With these constraint equations the ﬁnal results shown in Table 17.2 are
obtained.

Comparative evaluation: Figures 17.14a,b,c are drawn with identical lengths
ℓ1 = 35 , ℓ2 = 3.5 , ℓ3 = 6 , ℓ4 = 9 . With these lengths F2/F1 ≈6.7 for
the shears (a), F2/F1 ≈11.6 for the shears (b) and F2/F1 ≈3.3 for the
shears (c). Shears (c) are the only ones in which the object to be cut can
be placed in the position ℓ4 = 0 . Then,
F2/F1 ≈6.4 . With parameters
of commercially available pruning-shears of this kind a ratio F2/F1 = 15 is
possible. Compared with all other devices these shears have the advantage
that for a given width of the object to be cut the opening angle between the
shearing blades is the smallest.

17 Planar Four-Bar Mechanism
In shears (d) the lengths L2 and L3 are constant. The lengths L4 and
L1 depend very much on the opening angle. Both of them decrease mono-
tonically in the process of closing the blades. Figure 17.14e shows the blades
fully closed. The dimensions should be chosen such that in this position the
instantaneous centers P13 , P10 and P20 are almost collinear as shown. In
this case, the ratio L4/L1 is > 1 in every position, and it increases mono-
tonically when the blades are closing. With shears of this kind reinforcement
steel rods of 15 mm diameter can be cut by hand.
17.8 Coupler Curves
Every point ﬁxed in the plane of the coupler traces a coupler curve when the
four-bar is moving through its entire range. It is the complexity of these curves
to which the four-bar owes much of its importance in engineering (see Fig.
17.2). In the following sections properties of coupler curves are investigated.
The curvature of coupler curves was the subject of Sect. 15.3.3 (see Fig.
15.19).
17.8.1 Roberts/Tschebychev Theorem. Cognate
Four-Bars
Figure 17.15 is started by drawing the four-bar A0A1B1B0 and a point C
ﬁxed in the plane of the coupler A1B1 . This plane is represented by the
coupler triangle (A1,B1,C). Subject of investigation is the coupler curve gen-
erated by C . To this basic ﬁgure lines A0A2C and B0A3C are added thus
creating two parallelograms. In the next step, triangles similar to the coupler
triangle are drawn as shown with bases A2C and A3C . This results in points
B2 and B3 . Finally, another parallelogram deﬁning the point C0 is drawn.
Point A0 is made the origin of a complex plane. In this complex plane arbi-
trary points such as B1 , for example, are interpreted as complex numbers.
The number is given the name of the point itself. For the addition of complex
numbers the parallelogram rule is valid. This means, for example, that the
number C0 is the sum
C0 = A2 + (B2 −A2) + (C0 −B2) .
(17.67)
The coupler triangle (A1,B1,C) deﬁnes the complex number
z = |C −A1|
|B1 −A1| ei α .
(17.68)

17.8 Coupler Curves
591
Fig. 17.15 Roberts/Tschebychev theorem
The deﬁnition is such that
C −A1 = (B1 −A1)z .
(17.69)
For the three terms in (17.67) the ﬁgure yields the expressions
A2 = C −A1 = (B1 −A1)z ,
B2 −A2 = (C −A2)z = A1z ,
(17.70)
C0 −B2 = B3 −C = (A3 −C)z = (B0 −B1)z .
(17.71)
Substitution into (17.67) reveals that
C0 = (B1 −A1 + A1 + B0 −B1)z = B0z = const .
(17.72)
Thus, C0 remains ﬁxed independent of the motion of the four-bar A0A1B1B0 .
From this follows
Theorem 17.2. (Roberts4/Tschebychev5) For every four-bar A0A1B1B0
with a coupler point C there exist two additional four-bars A0A2B2C0 and
B0A3B3C0 the coupler points C of which trace one and the same coupler
curve. Because of this property the three four-bars are said to be cognate.
The coupler triangles of the three four-bars are similar, but in each triangle
another angle is opposite the coupler. Equation (17.72) shows that also the
triangle (A0,B0,C0) is similar to the coupler triangle (A1,B1,C). For B2 the
sum of the two Eqs.(17.70) yields
B2 = B1z .

5 Pavnuty Lvovic Tschebychev (1821-1894); he considers a basic ﬁgure with arbitrary
coupler triangle, but with identical link lengths r1 = r2 , and he constructs geometrically
one other four-bar ([40] p.273 published in 1878)

592
17 Planar Four-Bar Mechanism
Hence also the triangle (A0,B1,B2) is similar to the coupler triangle and with
the same argument also the triangle (B0,A1,B3).
Imagine that the three four-bars are physically connected at C , and that
B0 and C0 are free to move. The resulting mechanism is deformable subject
to the constraints that (i) links and coupler triangles remain undeformed,
and that (ii) parallelograms remain parallelograms. In Fig. 17.16 a position
is shown in which the links of four-bar A0A1B1B0 are stretched out in the
line A0 ˜A1 ˜B1 ˜B0 . The new positions of the remaining points (denoted by the
symbol tilde) are determined by the three parallelograms not shaded and by
the three similar coupler triangles (shaded). In this position all three four-
bars have their links stretched out. The triangle (A0 ˜B0 ˜C0) is similar to the
coupler triangles. It is this ﬁgure from which all lengths of the other two
four-bars are most easily obtained.
Figure 17.15 is particularly simple if the coupler point C in the four-
bar A0A1B1B0 is located on the line A1B1 of the coupler. This case is
characterized by α = 0 or π and z real. From this it follows that in all three
four-bars C is located on the coupler line. The positions of C0 , A2 , B2 , A3
and B3 are determined by the equations
C0 = B0z ,
A2 = (B1 −A1)z ,
B2 = B1z , B3 = C + (B0 −A1)z with real z . Figure 17.17 explains how
to proceed geometrically when the four-bar A0A1B1B0 and point C on the
coupler are given. As in Fig. 17.15 A2 and A3 are constructed by drawing the
parallelograms A0A1CA2 and B0B1CA3 . Next, B2 and B3 are constructed,
the former as point of intersection of the lines A0B1 and CA2 and the
latter as point of intersection of the lines B0A1 and CA3 . Finally, C0 is
constructed as in Fig. 17.15 by drawing the parallelogram B2CB3C0 .

In what follows, the general case shown in Fig. 17.15 is considered again.
The parallelity of lines in parallelograms in combination with the rigidity of
coupler triangles has the consequences: If one of the links A0A1 , A2B2 and

17.8 Coupler Curves
593
C0B3 is fully rotating, all three of them are fully rotating, and if any one
of them is not fully rotating, none of them is fully rotating. The same state-
ments apply to the links B0B1 , A3B3 and C0B2 . The combination of these
arguments leads to the following statements:
1. If four-bar A0A1B1B0 is a double-rocker of second kind, the other two
four-bars are double-rockers of second kind as well.
2. If four-bar A0A1B1B0 is a double-crank, the other two four-bars are
double-cranks as well.
3. If four-bar A0A1B1B0
is a crank-rocker with crank A0A1 , four-bar
A0A2B2C0 is double-rocker of ﬁrst kind, and four-bar B0A3B3C0 is a crank-
rocker with crank C0B3 .
4. If four-bar A0A1B1B0 is a double-rocker of ﬁrst kind, the other two four-
bars are crank-rockers with cranks A0A2 and B0A3 , respectively.
The Roberts-Tschebychev theorem has important engineering applica-
tions. If the generation of some particular coupler curve is required and if
there is not enough space for the chosen four-bar, the same coupler curve
is generated by two other four-bars which are located somewhere else and
which are diﬀerent in size. The same curve can be generated by still other
linkages. Equation (17.71), C0−B2 = (B0−B1)z , shows that the links C0B2
and B0B1 have identical angular velocities when the four-bars are moving.
Identical angular velocities are produced also by means of three gears with
centers ﬁxed in the base according to Fig. 17.18a . The two outer gears have
arbitrary, but equal diameters, and each of them is rigidly connected with
one of the two links. The central gear has arbitrary diameter and arbitrary
location. When the central gear is set into motion, C is generating the same
coupler curve that is generated by the three four-bars.
The linkage shown in Fig. 17.18b is composed of some of the links in
Fig. 17.15 . The degree of freedom is two. The parallelogram is free to rotate
as rigid body about A0 . It may also deform. Hence it is possible to guide
B1 along an arbitrarily prescribed curve (within a certain workspace). From
(17.73), B2 = B1z , it follows that B2 generates the same curve rotated
through the angle α and multiplied by the factor |z| = A1C/ A1B1 . This
linkage is called Sylvester’s plagiograph [38], v.3 .
If, in particular, B1 is guided along a straight line f1 (arbitrary), B2 is
moving along a straight line f2 which is rotated counter-clockwise against f1
through α . The links A0A1B1 with B1 guided along f1 constitute a slider-
crank mechanism, and the links A0A2B2 with B2 guided along f2 constitute
another slider-crank mechanism. With both mechanisms the coupler-ﬁxed
point C traces one and the same coupler curve. Thus, the existence of two
cognate slider-crank mechanisms is proved. The ﬁgure explains how to con-
struct one from the other.

17.8.2 Parameter Equations for Coupler Curves
For the graphical display of coupler curves a parameter representation of
the curve is required which determines, in the x, y -system of Fig. 17.19 ,
the coordinates x and y of the coupler point C as functions of the input
angle ϕ . Constant parameters in these functions are ℓ, r1 , r2 , a and the
coordinates η and ζ of C in the coupler plane. Using the inclination angle

χ of the coupler as auxiliary variable the coordinates of C are
x = r1 cos ϕ + η cos χ −ζ sin χ ,
y = r1 sin ϕ + η sin χ + ζ cos χ . (17.74)
This is the desired parameter representation of the coupler curve. For cos χ
and sin χ the expressions from (17.23) are substituted:

√¯A2 + ¯B2 −¯C2

2) .
(17.76)
Every input angle ϕ determines two positions of the four-bar and, hence, two
positions of the coupler point C . From Sect. 17.1 it is known that double-
rockers of ﬁrst kind (Fig. 17.4c) and of second kind (Figs. 17.5a,b,c) have
the property that the two positions can be reached one from the other by
a continuous motion. Hence these four-bars have the property that the cou-
pler curve is unicursal (a single closed curve). In contrast, double-cranks and
crank-rockers have the property that the two positions associated with a sin-
gle input angle cannot be reached one from the other by a continuous motion,
but only by disconnection and reassembly (see Figs. 17.4a and b). This has
the consequence that coupler curves of such four-bars are bicursal (two closed
branches). The transition from unicursal to bicursal coupler curves occurs in
foldable four-bars. In this case, the two closed branches of a bicursal curve
create a singular point. The three coupler curves in Fig. 17.20 demonstrate
the transition from unicursal to bicursal curves. Except for r1 the sets of
parameters (ℓ, r1 , r2 , a , η , ζ) are the same for all three curves. The circle
is explained following Eq.(17.87).

Figure 17.19 is considered again. This time, the location of the coupler point
C in the coupler plane is speciﬁed not by the parameters a , η , ζ , but by

Fig. 17.20 Coupler curves of a double-rocker of second kind with r1 = 3.01 (unicursal),
of a foldable four-bar with r1 = 3 and of a crank-rocker with r1 = 2.99 (bicursal). The
other parameters ℓ= 8 , r2 = 5 , a = 6 , η = 0 and ζ = 4 are the same in all three
cases. For the circle see (17.87)
For making statements about properties of coupler curves the parameters
b1 , b2 , β are more suitable. First statements are the following.
In the case b1 = 0 (in the case b2 = 0 ), coupler curves are circles or arcs of
circles with radius r1 about A0 (with radius r2 about B0 ). Coupler curves
are conﬁned to the area bounded by the concentric circles about A0 with
radii |r1 −b1| and r1 + b1 and by the concentric circles about B0 with radii
|r2 −b2| and r2 + b2 . In the case b1 , b2 ≫ℓ, a , r1 , r2 , coupler curves are
approximately circles or arcs of circles.
The goal of the following analysis is an implicit equation of the coupler
curve in the form f(x, y, ℓ, r1, r2, b1, b2, β) = 0 . In developing this equation
the auxiliary variables α and d shown in Fig. 17.19 are used temporarily.
From the ﬁgure it is seen that
x = r1 cos ϕ + b1 sin α .
(17.78)
The cosine law applied to the triangles (A,D,A0 ) and (A,D,C) yields two
expressions for d2 . The identity of these expressions is the equation
r2
1 + x2 −2xr1 cos ϕ = b2
1 + y2 −2b1y cos α .
(17.79)
For r1 cos ϕ the expression from (17.78) is substituted. This results in the
following equation which is linear with respect to both sin α and cos α :
2b1(x sin α + y cos α) = x2 + y2 + b2
1 −r2
1 .
(17.80)
The same equations are formulated for the triangles (B,D,C) and (B,D,B0 ).
They are obtained by replacing in the above equations
x , r1 , b1 , α by
ℓ−x , r2 , b2 , β −α , respectively. To sin(β −α) and to cos(β −α) addition

The highest-order term p1(x2 + y2)3 shows that on each of the imaginary
lines y = +ix and y = −ix the coupler curve has a triple-root at inﬁnity.
The curve is a tricircular sextic.
Proposition: An arbitrary circle with center point coordinates x0, y0 and
with radius r intersects the coupler curve in six (not necessarily real) points.
The following proof provides a method for calculating the intersection points.
With a parameter γ the circle has the parameter equations
x = x0 +
r cos γ , y = y0 + r sin γ . This yields x2 + y2 = r2 + x2
0 + y2
0 + 2r(x0 cos γ +
y0 sin γ) . These expressions are substituted into (17.85). The result is an
equation of third order in cos γ and sin γ . The substitution
z = tan γ/2
leads to a 6th-order polynomial equation for z . End of proof.
The existence of six intersection points of a coupler curve and a circle can
be expressed in the following alternative form. Given three circles a , b , c
and a triangle (A,B,C), there exist six (not necessarily real) positions of the
triangle in which A lies on a , B on b and C on c . This result is important
for Sect. 17.10 on planar robots.

It is the equation of the circle shown in Fig. 17.21 . The circle passes through
A0 and B0 . It has the central semi-angle β and, hence, the peripheral angle
β . It was shown that β is also the angle at C0 in the triangle (A0,B0,C0)
of Fig. 17.15 . Therefore, also C0 is located on the circle. From this fact
Roberts concluded Theorem 17.2 on the existence of three cognate four-bars
generating one and the same coupler curve. The three centers A0 , B0 and C0
are referred to as singular foci, and the circle itself is called circle of singular
foci. Since Δ equals zero on the circle, cos α and sin α are indeterminate if
the coupler point is located on the circle. Indeterminate means that at least
two diﬀerent positions of the four-bar generate one and the same point of the
coupler curve. In other words: The coupler curve intersects the circle at this
point at least twice.
Figure 17.22 proves the inverse statement: If the coupler point C is at one
and the same point in two (or more) positions of the four-bar, this multiple
point lies on the circle. The coupler triangle is (A1,B1,C) in one position

Fig. 17.22 Proof that double points of the
coupler curve lie on the circle of singular foci
and (A2,B2,C) in the other. It must be shown that ∢(A0,C,B0) equals the
angle β in the coupler triangle. The dashed lines A0C and B0C bisect the
auxiliary angles γ and δ . With ψ as auxiliary angle β = γ + ψ = δ + ψ
and, consequently, δ = γ . Hence ∢(A0,C,B0)= γ/2 + ψ + δ/2 = β . End of
proof.
There is only a single type of double point of a coupler curve which, in
general, is not located on the circle (17.87). This is the singular point on the
coupler curve of a foldable four-bar associated with the folded position. It is
a point belonging to two branches of the curve and to a single position of the
four-bar. Example: The four-bar with parameters ℓ= 8 , r1 = 3 , r2 = 5 ,
a = 6 is a foldable four-bar. The coupler point η = 0 , ζ = 4 generates the
coupler curve shown in Fig. 17.20 which has two ordinary double points on
the circle (17.87) and the singular double point related to the folded position.
Conditions for the singular double point to lie on the circle of singular foci
are formulated as follows. Let the parameters of the foldable four-bar satisfy
the condition ℓ+ r1 = a + r2 . In the folded position the coupler point C
has the coordinates x = η −r1 , y = ζ . The condition to lie on the circle
Δ = 0 is, according to (17.82),

ℓ= (μ2

The parameters μ1 , r1 , μ2 , r2 can be chosen arbitrarily subject to the con-
ditions that (i) a > 0 ,
(ii) a , b1 , b2 satisfy the triangle inequalities and
(iii) ℓ> 0 .
In what follows, four-bars are considered which are not foldable. Like any
other circle the circle of singular foci (17.87) intersects a coupler curve at
not more than six real points. Hence a coupler curve can have at most three
double points. In Fig. 17.23 a coupler curve with three double points is shown.
It is generated by a double-rocker with parameters ℓ= 10 , r1 = 4 , a =
4 , r2 = 9 , η = 2 , ζ = 4 . Two double points may coincide in a quadruple
point. An example is shown in Fig. 17.28 .
A double point degenerates into a cusp if the loop associated with the
double point contracts into a single point. From this it follows that also
cusps lie on the circle (17.87), and that the maximum number of cusps is
three. The condition for a cusp to exist is that the coupler point C is located
on the moving centrode of the coupler. In the course of rolling of the moving
centrode on the ﬁxed centrode the point C generates the cusp when it is the
point of contact, i.e., the instantaneous center of rotation of the coupler and,
hence, the intersection point of the input and the output link of the four-bar.

Figure 17.24 demonstrates that this may happen in altogether four diﬀerent
conﬁgurations. The common feature is that the segments of lengths (r1, b1)
and (r2, b2) are pairwise collinear. In any such conﬁguration the base A0B0
is seen from C either under the angle β or under the angle π −β . This
proves again that cusps lie on the circle (17.87). In the four-bar A0ABB0
drawn with thick lines the cosine law applied to the triangles (A0,B0,C) and
(A,B,C) yields the equations
ℓ2 = (r1 + b1)2 + (r2 + b2)2 −2(r1 + b1)(r2 + b2) cos β ,
a2 = b2
1 + b2
2 −2b1b2 cos β .
 
(17.93)
Elimination of cos β results in a condition for the existence of cusps:
b1b2[(r1 +b1)2 +(r2 +b2)2 −ℓ2]−(r1 +b1)(r2 +b2)(b2
1 +b2
2 −a2) = 0 . (17.94)
With reference to Fig. 17.24 (b1, b2) can be replaced by (−b1, b2) , (b1, −b2)
and (−b1, −b2) .
Example: To be determined are parameters of coupler curves of foldable
four-bars of the kind ℓ+r1 = a+r2 which have not only the singular double
point, but also a cusp on the circle of singular foci.
Solution: The parameters must satisfy (17.92) as well as (17.94). Substitution
of the expressions (17.92) into (17.94) results in
(μ1 + μ2 −1)[μ1(1 + μ1)r1 −μ2(1 + μ2)r2]2 = 0 , i.e.,

As is the case in (17.94) ( μ1 , μ2 ) may be replaced by ( −μ1 , μ2 ) , ( μ1 , −μ2 )
and ( −μ1 , −μ2 ) . Parameters of coupler curves having the desired proper-
ties are determined either from (a) or from (b) . Condition (b) is a special
case. Substitution of this expression for r2 and of b1 = μ1r1 , b2 = μ2r2 into
the second Eq.(17.93) shows that cos β = 1 . This means that the generating
point of the coupler curve lies on the coupler. End of example.
Figure 17.25 is proof of the existence of coupler curves with three cusps. A
coupler curve has three cusps if in one of the three positions both A and B
are located on the circle with the diameter A0–B0 (Cayley [6] v.9:551–580 ,
Mayer [27]). Let the position drawn in thick lines in Fig. 17.24 be modiﬁed
so as to satisfy this condition. The angles in the coupler triangle are denoted
β , ∢(CBA) = α and ∢(CAB) = γ . Proposition: The triangles (C,A0,B0)
and (C,A,B) are congruent with
∢(CA0B0) = α
and
∢(CB0A0) = γ .
Proof: It suﬃces to prove the ﬁrst identity. This is done in three steps.
1. ∢(CA0B) = π/2 −β (right-angled triangle).
2. The center 0 of the said circle is the apex of the three isosceles triangles
(A0,0,A) , (A,0,B) and (B,0,B0) . The second triangle has the apex angle
∢(A0B) = π −2β (twice the angle subtended by A–B ). Hence ∢(BA0) =
∢(AB0) = β .
3. The angles ∢(CA0B0) = ∢(A0A0) and ∢(CBA) = α are both equal
to π −β −γ . End of proof. The bisected isosceles triangles establish for the
internal angles of the triangles the formulas
cos α = ±r1
ℓ,
cos β = a
ℓ,
cos γ = ±r2
ℓ,
α+β+γ = π . (17.96)
The signs ± take into account that, formally, the sign of r1 and/or r2 can
be reversed. The cosines of the internal angles β1,2,3 of an arbitrary triangle
satisfy the equation6

the third. The ratios determine the angles in the coupler triangle, the side
lengths b1 = a sin α/ sin β , b2 = a sin γ/ sin β and the position of the cusp.
This cusp is referred to as principal cusp because it is the only one in which
both endpoints of the coupler are located on the circle with the diameter
A0–B0 . In the other two positions only one of them is on this circle. More
precisely, in the second position the endpoint originally at A has moved
to the reﬂection A′ of A in the line A0B0 , and the cusp is on the line
A0A′ at the distance |r1 −b1| from A0 . Similarly, in the third position the
endpoint originally at B has moved to the reﬂection B′ of B in the line
A0B0 , and the cusp is on the line B0B′ at the distance |r2 −b2| from B0 .
Simple algebra reveals that the distances of the second and of the third cusp
from the principal cusp are ℓsin 2α/ sin β and ℓsin 2γ/ sin β , respectively.
These expressions resemble those for b1 and b2. According to the Roberts-
Tschebychev Theorem three cusps are generated by three cognate four-bars.
Each cusp is the principal cusp for one of these four-bars. In Fig. 17.25 the
three cognate four-bars are congruent.
The conditions (17.96) are particularly simple in the case of foldable four-
bars. Example: Foldable four-bars of the kind a + r2 = ℓ+ r1 . With (17.96)
this equation is cos β + cos γ = 1 + cos α = 1 −cos(β + γ) or
(1 + cos β) cos γ −sin β sin γ = 1 −cos β .
(17.99)
This is an equation for γ in terms of β . It has real roots γ for angles β
satisfying the condition cos β ≥2 −
√
5 ( β < 104◦approximately).
Additional material on coupler curves is found in Mayer [27] and M¨uller
[28, 30, 31].
17.8.4 Symmetrical Coupler Curves
Coupler curves which are symmetrical with respect to the base line A0B0
have an Eq.(17.84) in which y appears in terms of even orders only. For
this it is necessary that sin β = 0 . This means that the generating coupler
point C lies on the coupler line AB (not necessarily between the points
A and B ). The coupler curve in Fig. 17.2 is an example. According to the
Roberts-Tschebychev theorem every such coupler curve is generated by two
more four-bars. Also in these four-bars the coupler point lies on the coupler
line.
In Eq.(17.84) for symmetrical coupler curves with sin β = 0 the parame-
ters are b1 = η and b2 = η −a where η is the parameter used in Fig. 17.19 .
Of particular interest are intersection points of the coupler curve with the
axis of symmetry. With y = 0 the following equation is obtained for these
points which is of third order in x and in η :

604
17 Planar Four-Bar Mechanism
(η −a)(x −ℓ)(x2 + η2 −r2
1) −ηx[(x −ℓ)2 + (η −a)2 −r2
2] = 0 .
(17.100)
For given parameters the equation has either one or three real roots x . For
this reason one does not expect coupler curves which do not intersect the
x -axis. Such coupler curves do exist, however. Example: If
η = 2a
and
r2 = a , the equation has the roots x1 = ℓand x2,3 = ℓ±

4a2 + ℓ2 −r2
1 .
For the parameter values ℓ= 1 , a = 1.3 and r1 = 0.4 the three roots
are real. Yet, the coupler curve does not intersect the x -axis. In Fig. 17.38
the branch of this curve above the x -axis is shown. The three real roots
are marked B0 , P1 and P2 . They represent singular points of the coupler
curve. In order to understand this phenomenon (17.80) and (17.81) must be
formulated for the special case b1 = η , b2 = η −a , β = 0 , y = 0 :
x2 + η2 −2xη sin α = r2
1 ,
(x −ℓ)2 + (η −a)2 −2(x −ℓ)(η −a) sin α = r2
2 .
(17.101)
Each equation expresses the cosine law for one of the triangles of Fig. 17.13 .
The elimination of sin α is possible without imposing the constraint equation
cos2 α + sin2 α = 1 . Simple linear combination of the equations results in
(17.100). Only those real solutions of this equation are admissible solutions
for which Eqs.(17.101) yield | sin α| ≤1 .
Symmetrical coupler curves of a diﬀerent nature are generated if the four-
bar and the coupler triangle satisfy the symmetry conditions r1 = r2 = r
and
b1 = b2 = b , respectively. Fig. 17.26 shows the system in its sym-
metrical trapezoidal position. The coupler curve of point C is symmetrical
with respect to the midnormal of the base A0B0 . The ﬁgure shows also one
of the cognate four-bars which, according to the Roberts-Tschebychev the-
orem, generate the same coupler curve. The third four-bar is the reﬂection
of the second in the midnormal of the base A0B0 . The parameters of the
second four-bar are denoted r′
1 , a′ , r′
2 , b′
1 , b′
2 . They satisfy the condition
r′
2 = b′
2 = a′ . Hence also this is a suﬃcient condition for the coupler curve
to be symmetric. The symmetry axis passes through C0 , and its inclination
angle against the base line C0A0 is β/2 . The angle at C is β′ = π/2−β/2 .
In Fig. 17.27 this kind of four-bar A0A1B1B0 with coupler point C is
shown again, but this time with the usual notation, i.e., r2 = b2 = a instead
of
r′
2 = b′
2 = a′ and β instead of β′ . The length of the input link is r .
The symmetry axis of the coupler curve passes through B0 under the angle
π/2 −β against the base line. The symmetry axis is made the y -axis of an
x, y -system with origin B0 . At B1 the transmission angle 2α is shown. It is
convenient to use α as independent variable for the x, y-coordinates of C .
From isosceles triangles with the apex B1 the auxiliary quantities ϱ and d
are obtained:
ϱ = 2a cos(α −β) ,
d = 2a sin α .
(17.102)
The angle δ appears also in the triangle (A0,B0,A1) . The cosine law r2 =
d2 + ℓ2 −2dℓcos δ yields

These equations ﬁnd an application in Sect. 17.12.3.
From the ﬁgure it is seen that intersection points of the coupler curve with
the symmetry axis are characterized by δ = 0 . In such positions A1 lies on
the base line. Then either d = ℓ−r or d = ℓ+ r and y = ϱ . Equations
(17.102) yield the associated angles α and the stationary values y :

y = 2a cos(α −β) .

The position d = ℓ−r is always possible, the position d = ℓ+r only if the
four-bar is a crank-rocker. It is left to the reader to show that the positions
d = ℓ−r and d = ℓ+ r of a crank-rocker yield identical values of y if
the parameters satisfy the condition r2 +ℓ2 cot2 β = 4a2 cos2 β . In this case,

606

the coupler curve has a quadruple point on the circle of singular foci. In Fig.
17.28 these conditions are satisﬁed.

17.9 Slider-Crank. Inverted Slider-Crank
The slider-crank mechanism shown in Fig. 17.29a is derived from the four-bar
in Fig. 17.19 by moving the point B0 in y-direction to −∞. This has the
eﬀect that the endpoint B of the coupler of length a is guided along the
straight line y = h = const. In the inverted slider-crank mechanism of Fig.
17.29b the coupler of length a has become the ﬁxed link, while the ﬁxed
link with the parameter h has become the moving coupler. The parameter
h can be positive or zero or negative. Arbitrarily, it is considered as positive
in both ﬁgures. In both ﬁgures the crank angle ϕ is the input variable, and
the inclination angle χ of the coupler and the position s of the slider are
output variables. Every value of ϕ is associated with two positions of the
mechanism. In Fig. 17.29a the two values of χ and s are determined by the
equations
sin χ1,2 = h −r sin ϕ

s1,2 = r cos ϕ ±

In Fig. 17.29b the output variables are obtained from two equations express-
ing the fact that the slider has the coordinates x = a and y = 0 :
r cos ϕ + h cos χ + s sin χ = a ,
r sin ϕ + h sin χ −s cos χ = 0 . (17.108)
Decoupling produces the equations

(17.109)
The ﬁrst equation has two solutions cos χ1,2 and sin χ1,2 . The associated
solutions s1,2 are obtained from the second equation. In both ﬁgures the
equivalent to Grashof’s Theorem 17.1 is
Theorem 17.3. The link with the shorter of the two lengths a and r is fully
rotating relative to all other links if
h2 ≤(a −r)2 .
(17.110)
Coupler curves: In both ﬁgures the coupler-ﬁxed point C is speciﬁed by
constant parameters b1 , b2 and β . In Fig. 17.29a the notation is the same
as in Fig. 17.19, whereas in Fig. 17.29b
b2 and β are deﬁned diﬀerently.
Implicit equations for coupler curves in the form f(x, y, r, b1, b2, β) = 0 are
obtained from two linear equations for the sine and cosine of the auxiliary
variable angle α . For both ﬁgures (17.78) and (17.79) are valid. Hence also
the resulting Eq.(17.80) is valid:
2b1(x sin α + y cos α) = x2 + y2 + b2
1 −r2 .
(17.111)
In Fig. 17.29a
the second linear equation for cos α and sin α is
y = h + b2 cos(β −α) .
(17.112)
In Fig. 17.29b the coordinates of point E satisfy the three equations
xE = x −b2 sin(α −β) ,
yE = y −b2 cos(α −β) ,
xE = a −yE cot(α −β) .
(17.113)

608
17 Planar Four-Bar Mechanism
Elimination of xE and yE produces the desired second linear equation:
(x −a) sin(α −β) + y cos(α −β) = b2 .
(17.114)
To this equation and to (17.112) addition theorems are applied. Following
this, the two sets of equations, one for Fig. 17.29a and one for Fig. 17.29b, are
solved for cos α and sin α . As in Eqs.(17.83) for the four-bar these solutions
have the forms cos α = U/Δ and sin α = V/Δ with the pertinent coeﬃcient
determinants U , V
and Δ . The desired implicit equations of the coupler
curves are the equations cos2 α + sin2 α = 1 , i.e., U 2 + V 2 = Δ2 . The
equation Δ = 0 determines the locus of double points and cusps of coupler
curves. Omitting elementary intermediate steps only the ﬁnal equations are
documented.

Since a straight line intersects a quartic in at most four real points, the
maximum number of double points and of cusps is two. In the context of Fig.
17.18b the existence of two cognate slider-crank mechanisms producing one
and the same coupler curve has been proved.

however. The maximum number of double points and of cusps of coupler
curves on the circle is three. It can be shown that the third singular focus
coincides with the singular focus A0 . This has the consequence that there
are no cognate inverted slider-crank mechanisms.
17.10 Planar Parallel Robot
The triangular platform (A,B,C) of the planar parallel robot in Fig. 17.30
is positioned by means of three telescopic arms with controllable lengths ri
( i = 1, 2, 3 ) which are pivoted at A0 , B0 , C0 . The platform serves as
carrier of tools or of work pieces7. The characterization as parallel points to
the fact that the platform is positioned by arms in a parallel arrangement
in contrast to a serial robot where it is positioned by a single arm with a
series of links and joints (see Sect. 5.7). Parallel robots are able to manipulate
heavier loads than serial robots, and they position them with higher accuracy
and with greater stiﬀness.

17 Planar Four-Bar Mechanism
The planar parallel robot poses the following kinematics problem. Alto-
gether nine parameters are given. These are three quantities specifying the
triangle (A,B,C), the arm lengths ri ( i = 1, 2, 3 ) and, in the x, y -system
shown, the x -coordinate of B0 and the x, y -coordinates of C0 . To be deter-
mined are all possible positions of the triangle (A,B,C).
Solution: Imagine that joint C connecting the platform with arm 3 is
eliminated. Point C is located on the coupler curve generated by C ﬁxed
to the four-bar A0ABB0 and also on the circle k of radius r3 about C0 .
The four-bar and the coupler curve in Fig. 17.30 are copied from Fig. 17.23.
The circle k intersects the coupler curve at six points. This is the maximum
possible number of points. How to calculate these points was explained fol-
lowing (17.85). Each point determines a possible position of the robot. This
concludes the position analysis.
Next, the velocity state is analyzed. Imagine that the telescopic joint in
arm 3 is a passive joint so that this arm adapts itself freely to motions of the
four-bar A0ABB0 with ﬁxed lengths r1 and r2 . The platform (A,B,C) has
relative to the base the instantaneous center P3 at the intersection of arms
1 and 2 . Let ω3 be the angular velocity of the coupler ( ω3 > 0 counter-
clockwise). The velocity of C is v3 = ω3 × ϱ3 . It is tangent to the coupler
curve. As is shown α3 denotes the angle between r3 and v3 in the case
ω3 > 0 . Arm 3 changes its length with the velocity
˙r3 = ω3ϱ3 cos α3 . Con-
versely, if ˙r3 is prescribed, ω3 = ˙r3/(ϱ3 cos α3) . This angular velocity and
the instantaneous center P3 determine the velocities of A , B and C . The
formula for ω3 shows that ˙r3 ̸= 0 is possible only if in the position under
investigation the coupler curve and the circle k are not in tangential contact.
The quantities ϱ3 and cos α3 are calculated from the triangle (C0,P3,C) .
Similar statements are valid when in the position under investigation arm
1 only or arm 2 only experiences a rate of change of length ˙r1 or ˙r2 , respec-
tively. In Fig. 17.30 also the instantaneous centers P1 , P2 together with the
associated quantities ϱ1 , α1 and ϱ2 , α2 are shown. When the three rates
of change ˙r1 , ˙r2 , ˙r3 occur simultaneously, the superposition principle yields
the resultant angular velocity
ω =
3

i=1
˙ri
ϱi cos αi
.
(17.119)
The velocity of each of the points A , B , C is the sum of three velocities
two of which are collinear. The instantaneous center of the platform is the
intersection point of the normals of the velocities of A , B and C .

17.11 Four-Bars with Prescribed Transmission Characteristics
611
17.11 Four-Bars with Prescribed Transmission
Characteristics
The transmission characteristic is the relation between input angle ϕ and
output angle ψ . In what follows, the implicit form (17.9) is used:
−ℓr1 cos ϕ + ℓr2 cos ψ = r1r2 cos(ϕ −ψ) + 1
2[a2 −(r2
1 + ℓ2 + r2
2)] . (17.120)
It depends upon the three parameters r1/ℓ, r2/ℓand a/ℓwhere ℓis a
given unit length. In some engineering applications it is required that a four-
bar produces prescribed pairs of input and output angles (ϕk, ψk)
(k =
1, 2, . . .) . In other applications it is required that some prescribed function
ψ = f(ϕ) be optimally approximated over a certain interval 0 ≤ϕ ≤ϕmax .
These and related problems have been treated extensively in the literature
(see, for example, Lichtenheldt/Luck [26], Hain [18, 19], Soni [36]). In what
follows, a few problems are discussed in detail.
17.11.1 Prescribed Pairs of Input-Output Angles
First, the case is treated that three pairs of angles (ϕk, ψk) (k = 1, 2, 3) are
prescribed. Equation (17.120) yields the three equations
−ℓr1 cos ϕk +ℓr2 cos ψk = r1r2 cos(ϕk −ψk)+ 1
2[a2 −(r2

(k = 1, 2, 3) . The diﬀerences ﬁrst minus second and second minus third
equation have the general forms
A1ℓr1 + B1ℓr2 = C1r1r2 ,
A2ℓr1 + B2ℓr2 = C2r1r2
(17.122)
with given constants Ai , Bi , Ci
(i = 1, 2) . Division by r1r2 results in two
linear equations for ℓ/r1 and ℓ/r2 with uniquely determined real solutions.
These solutions are substituted into one of the Eqs.(17.121). This equation
then determines a2/ℓ2 . The solution thus obtained is useful only if, ﬁrst,
r1 > 0 , r2 > 0 , a2/ℓ2 > 0 and, second, the four-bar with these link lengths
is capable of producing the prescribed pairs of angles in the desired order and
without disconnection and reassembly.
In most engineering applications it is not required that the four-bar pro-
duces prescribed pairs of angles (ϕk, ψk)
(k = 1, 2, . . .) . Instead, pairs of
angular diﬀerences (ϕk −ϕ0, ψk −ψ0)
(k = 1, 2, . . .) are prescribed where
the pair (ϕ0, ψ0) is an unspeciﬁed initial position of the four-bar. The angles
ϕ0 and ψ0 are free parameters so that the total number of free parameters

is ﬁve. In this formulation of the problem (17.120) must be satisﬁed for the
pair (ϕ0, ψ0) and for up to four pairs (ϕ0+ϕk, ψ0+ψk) (k = 1, 2, 3, 4) . The
previous discussion has shown that results may be useless for various reasons
(negative or imaginary link lengths, wrong order etc.). Therefore, only three
pairs (ϕ0 + ϕk, ψ0 + ψk)
(k = 1, 2, 3) are prescribed. This has the conse-
quence, that the solutions for ψ0 , r1 , r2 and a are functions of ϕ0 . This
initial angle ϕ0 is a free parameter which is chosen later so as to arrive at a
useful solution. The altogether four equations are
−ℓr1 cos ϕ0+ℓr2 cos ψ0 = r1r2 cos(ϕ0−ψ0)+ 1

The ﬁrst equation is subtracted from each of the remaining three equations.
The diﬀerences are then divided by r1r2 . This results in the equations

(k = 1, 2, 3) .(17.125)
These are three linear inhomogeneous equations for ℓ/r1 and ℓ/r2 . For a so-
lution to exist it is necessary that the (3×3) -coeﬃcient determinant including
the right-hand side terms be zero. This condition results in an equation in
which ϕ0 and ψ0 are the only unknowns. In order to be able to express
ψ0 as function of ϕ0 Eqs.(17.125) are rewritten with the help of addition
theorems in such a way that cos ψ0 and sin ψ0 are isolated. The equations
thus rewritten are
ak ℓr2 + (bk cos ψ0 + ck sin ψ0) ℓr1 = dk cos ψ0 + fk sin ψ0 ,
ak = cos(ϕ0 + ϕk) −cos ϕ0 ,
dk = cos ϕ0 −cos(ϕ0 + ϕk −ψk) ,

diﬀer by 180◦. With each real solution ψ0 two out of the three Eqs.(17.126)
determine r1/ℓand r2/ℓ. With these solutions r1/ℓand r2/ℓ(17.123)
determines a2/ℓ2 . At this point the desired formulation of the unknowns
ψ0 , r1 , r2 and a as functions of the free parameter ϕ0 is accomplished.
The variation of ϕ0 in search of a useful solution must be done numerically.
17.11.2 Prescribed Transmission Ratios
In this section four-bars are determined which produce two prescribed pairs of
angles (ϕk, ψk) (k = 1, 2) and, in the second position (ϕ2, ψ2) , a prescribed
value i2 of the transmission ratio i = ˙ϕ/ ˙ψ . The ﬁrst two conditions yield

(k = 1, 2) . As before, the diﬀerence of these two equations produces the
ﬁrst Eq.(17.122). For the transmission ratio (17.31) is used. This yields an
equation of the same type:

This is the second Eq.(17.122). The further steps of solution are as before.
The method of solution for ﬁve parameters (see (17.123), (17.124)) remains
the same if one or two of the Eqs.(17.124) are replaced by the requirement
that the transmission ratio is prescribed for one or two of the remaining pairs
of angles.

17.11.3 Jeantaud’s Steering Mechanism
In an automobile the steering mechanism causes the axes of the front wheels
to turn about points A0 and B0 ﬁxed in the car body. In Fig. 17.31 the axes
are shown in a vertical projection during a left turn. With an ideal steering
mechanism the turning angles α and β are coordinated such that the two
front axes and the rear axis of the car have, independent of the radius R of
the curve, a common intersection point. The lengths ℓand h are constant
parameters. From triangles the equations are obtained: h = (R−ℓ/2) tan α ,
h = (R + ℓ/2) tan β . Elimination of the variable R results in
cot β −cot α = ℓ
h .
(17.132)
This equation deﬁnes the function β(α) . It is an odd function. The curve
denoted k in Fig. 17.32 is the graph of this function for the speciﬁc parameter
value ℓ/h = 0.5 in the interval of interest up to the maximum steering angles
(αmax, βmax) . If, for example, αmax = 40◦, (17.132) yields βmax ≈30.6◦.
Jeantaud invented the steering mechanism shown in Fig. 17.33 . It is a
symmetrical four-bar approximating (17.132). The input link and the output
link of equal length r are rotating about A0 and B0 , respectively. They
are rigidly connected with the front axes. The ﬁgure shows the mechanism
in
the symmetrical trapezoidal position (front axes not turned) and in a

position eﬀecting a left turn. The link lengths are ℓ, r and a . Suitable
dimensionless parameters are ϱ = r/ℓand the angle γ . The ﬁgure shows
that a = ℓ−2r cos γ . Hence
2r2 +ℓ2 −a2 = 2r2 +4rℓ(1−ϱ cos γ) cos γ = 2rℓ(2 cos γ −ϱ cos 2γ) . (17.133)
The turning angle of the left front axis is α . The angle of the right axis is
called not β , but β∗because it is an approximation of β . The ﬁgure shows
angles ψ and ϕ . When this ﬁgure is rotated 180 ◦, it has the form and the
notation of Fig. 17.7 . Equation (17.9) relating ϕ and ψ is
2rℓ(cos ψ −cos ϕ) −2r2 cos(ϕ −ψ) + 2r2 + ℓ2 −a2 = 0 .
(17.134)
For 2r2+ℓ2−a2 the expression in (17.133) is substituted. Figure 17.33 shows
that ϕ = γ + β∗and ψ = π + α −γ . Also these substitutions are made.
When the resulting equation is divided by 2rℓ, it has the form
cos(γ + β∗) + cos(γ −α) −ϱ cos(2γ + β∗−α) = 2 cos γ −ϱ cos 2γ . (17.135)
After applying the addition theorem for the cosine function this takes the
form
A cos β∗+ B sin β∗= C ,
(17.136)
A =
cos γ −ϱ cos(2γ −α) ,
C = 2 cos γ −ϱ cos 2γ −cos(γ −α) ,
B = −sin γ + ϱ sin(2γ −α) .
 
(17.137)
The equation has two solutions β∗. Their sines are
sin β∗= BC ± A
√
A2 + B2 −C2
A2 + B2
.
(17.138)
The pertinent solution is the one which has the same sign that α has. This
solution deﬁnes a two-parametric manifold of functions
β∗(α, ϱ, γ) with
parameters ϱ and γ . Every parameter combination (ϱ, γ) determines a curve
β∗(α) in the diagram of Fig. 17.32 . It is reasonable to require that the curve
passes through the point α = αmax , β∗= βmax . This means that (17.135)
is satisﬁed with α = αmax and β∗= βmax . This equation determines for
every value of γ the associated value of ϱ . Thus, a one-parametric manifold
of curves with parameter γ is left. In Fig. 17.32 a single nonoptimal curve
is shown. The optimal value of γ is determined from the criterion that the
maximum of the deviation |β∗(α) −β(α)| in the interval 0 ≤α ≤αmax be
minimal. It turns out that this criterion yields two solutions γ1 > 0 and
γ2 < 0 . Example: With ℓ/h = 0.5 , αmax = 40◦and βmax ≈30.6◦the
solutions are γ1 ≈67◦, ϱ1 ≈0.25 and γ2 ≈−121◦, ϱ2 ≈0.25 . The four-
bar with γ2 is located in front of the front axis. The four-bar with γ1 is the
one shown in Fig. 17.33 . It is located behind the front axis (Brossard [4]).

17.12 Coupler Curves with Prescribed Properties
A problem frequently encountered in engineering is the design of a four-bar
for the generation of a coupler curve having certain prescribed properties.
If the four-bar has to be a crank-rocker, a suitable design may be found in
the book by Hrones/Nelson [22]. It is a compilation of 7300 coupler curves.
In each diagram a single crank-rocker is shown together with coupler curves
for a variety of coupler-ﬁxed points. A diﬀerent ordering principle of coupler
curves is found in Volmer [41]. Each diagram is a compilation of four-bars
(not only crank-rockers) and of coupler curves having the same singular foci
and the same double points on the circle of singular foci (17.87). In what
follows, some mathematical problems and methods of solution are discussed
which are encountered in the generation of coupler curves with prescribed
properties.
17.12.1 Coupler Curves Passing Through Prescribed
Points
The parameter representation of the coupler curve in the form of Eqs.(17.74)
– (17.76) contains the six constant parameters ℓ, r1 , r2 , a , η , ζ and as sev-
enth parameter the variable ϕ . These equations describe the coupler curve in
the special x, y -system of Fig. 17.19 . Three additional constant parameters
determine the location of this x, y -system in an x′, y′ -reference system.
In a typical problem statement it is required that a coupler curve passes
through prescribed points in the x′, y′ -system. Also the order in which these
points are passed is prescribed. Let m be the number of prescribed points.
The 2m prescribed coordinates result in 2m conditional equations. These
equations contain 9 + m free parameters, namely, the nine constant param-
eters listed above and for every prescribed point the associated crank angle.
From the equality 2m = 9 + m it follows that up to nine points can be pre-
scribed. To be sure, not for every set of nine prescribed points real solutions
exist and if they are real, the nine points are, in general, not passed in the
prescribed order. It may happen that the calculated coupler curve is bicursal
with some of the nine points on each branch.
The number m of points that can be prescribed is smaller than nine if the
additional requirement exists that the angle ϕk −ϕ1 of rotation of the input
crank associated with the passage from point P1 to point Pk is prescribed
for k = 2, . . . , m . The only free angle is ϕ1 . This means that altogether ten
free parameters exist while the number of equations to be satisﬁed is 2m as
before. From the equality 2m = 10 it follows that at most ﬁve points can
be prescribed. Methods for solving this problem see in Freudenstein [15] and
Dijksman [8].

17.12.2 Straight-Line Approximations
Coupler curves with approximately straight-line segments have important
engineering applications (see Fig. 17.2). The earliest straight-line approxi-
mation was invented by Watt8 for the purpose of guiding the piston in his
steam engine. His four-bar is a symmetrical double-rocker of second kind
with link lengths ℓ, r1 , a , r2 satisfying the conditions r1 = r2 = r
and
ℓ= 2

r2 + (a/2)2 . The ratio a/r is a free parameter. In Fig. 17.34a the
four-bar with link lengths r = 35 , a = 24 and ℓ= 74 is shown in four
positions. The ﬁgure-eight-shaped coupler curve generated by the midpoint
C of the coupler is symmetric to both the base line A0B0 and the midnormal
of this base line. The maximum distance from the base line (in position 4 of
point C) is

a(ℓ−a)/2 .
Watt was unaware of cognate four-bars since the Roberts-Tchebychev the-
orem had not yet been discovered. So was Evans who invented the so-called
grashopper linkage shown in Fig. 17.34b . It is a cognate of Watt’s mechanism.
Positions 1, 2, 3, 4 of the coupler point C are the same as in Fig. 17.34a .
Evans’ linkage has the advantage of being half the size of Watt’s mechanism
for one and the same coupler curve.

wrote: “Though I am not over anxious after fame, yet I am more proud of the parallel
motion than of any other mechanical invention I have ever made”

618
17 Planar Four-Bar Mechanism
Roberts9 is the inventor of another straight-line approximation (see Fig.
17.35). The coupler curve is symmetric with respect to the midnormal of the
base. In the symmetry position shown the coupler point C is on the base
line (coupler length a = ℓ/2 , coupler triangle with b1 = b2 = r ). The three
congruent triangles are determined by the single parameter ϱ = r/ℓ. In the
ﬁgure the case ϱ = .6 is shown. The coupler curve has a cusp and double
points at A0 and B0 .
Fig. 17.35 Roberts’ straight-line approximation by the double-rocker with r/ℓ= .6
Remark on the inﬂuence of the parameter ϱ : With ϱ = 1/2 the coupler curve
has three cusps. This curve is shown in Fig. 17.25 . With every ϱ > 1/2 the
coupler curve has a single cusp and double points at A0 and B0 . The midpoint
between A0 and B0 is a minimum. The maximum deviation Δmax from
the straight line between A0 and B0 occurs at two symmetrically located
maxima. With increasing ϱ this Δmax tends monotonically toward zero10.
In the same process the straight-line approximation becomes increasingly
better in an increasingly longer interval extending beyond the points A0 and
B0 . With ϱ = 3/4 the four-bar is foldable. With ϱ > 3/4 the coupler is fully
rotating. From an engineering point of view large values of ϱ are impractical.
Watt’s, Evans’ and Roberts’ straight-line approximations were found by
engineering intuition. A more systematic approach was explained in Sect.
15.3.6. The coupler curve of the point which, in a position under investigation,
is Ball’s point of the coupler is a good straight-line approximation, because
it has at this point zero curvature and zero rate of change of curvature. A
textbook entirely devoted to straight-line approximations (by means of four-
bars and of other linkages) is Kraus [25]. Straight-line approximations by
means of inverted slider-crank mechanisms see also in Wunderlich [46]. By

far the best straight-line approximations by coupler curves of four-bars were
obtained by Tschebychev [39, 40] who used this problem for demonstrating
the power of a new and widely applicable approximation theory invented by
him. His method is the subject of the next section.
17.12.3 Tschebychev’s Straight-Line Approximations
The general problem solved by Tschebychev is the following. In a given in-
terval xa ≤x ≤xb a given function F(x) is to be approximated by another
function of the form
Pn(x, p0, . . . , pn) = p0f0(x) + . . . + pnfn(x)
(17.139)
with free parameters p0, . . . , pn and with given linearly independent func-
tions f0(x), . . . , fn(x) . Tschebychev proved
Theorem 17.4. If the function Pn(x, p0, . . . , pn) has at most n real roots
in the interval
xa ≤x ≤xb , uniquely determined parameters p0, . . . , pn
exist such that the maximum of the absolute value of the approximation error
Δn(x, p0, . . . , pn) = Pn(x, p0, . . . , pn) −F(x) in the interval xa ≤x ≤xb is
minimal:
|Δn(x, p0, . . . , pn)|max = Min!
(xa ≤x ≤xb) .
(17.140)
Moreover, if D
is this maximum, the optimal function
Δn(x, p0, . . . , pn)
attains in the interval xa ≤x ≤xb alternatingly not less than (n+2) times
extremal values D and −D .
For a proof of the theorem see Tschebychev [39] (p.111 and 273), Watson [45]
and Powell [34]. Figure 17.36 shows schematically the graph of the optimal
function Δn in the case n = 2 . At the boundaries xa and xb and at
unspeciﬁed points x in the interval xa ≤x ≤xb the maximum D and the
minimum −D are attained not less than four times. Points x of extremal
values in the interval are double roots of one of the two equations
Δn(x, p0, . . . , pn) ± D = 0 .
(17.141)
Extrema at the boundaries xa and xb of the interval are either simple roots
or double roots of (17.141). Double roots satisfy also the equation
Δ′
n(x, p0, . . . , pn) = 0 .
(17.142)
The n + 2 Eqs.(17.141) and the n Eqs.(17.142) for double roots x in the
interior of the interval represent altogether 2n+2 equations. This equals the

17 Planar Four-Bar Mechanism

and −D
inside and
on the boundaries of the interval xa ≤x ≤xb
number of unknowns. Unknown are D , p0, . . . , pn and the n double roots x
in the interior of the interval. Thus, it is possible to express all unknowns in
terms of xa and xb . The equations are linear with respect to D , p0 , . . . , pn
and they are nonlinear with respect to the double roots x in the interior of
the interval.
Remarks: 1. The set of Eqs.(17.141) does not change if D is replaced by
−D . For this reason D is redeﬁned as either maximum or minimum of the
function.
2. If in (17.140) the function Δn is replaced by λΔn with an arbitrary
constant λ , the solutions for p0 , . . . , pn , x1 , . . . , xn+2 remain unaltered,
but D is replaced by λD .
Now back to straight-line approximations. In [40] p.51 Tschebychev inves-
tigated the family of coupler curves which are symmetric with respect to the
midnormal of the base A0B0 and among these coupler curves those which
approximate a straight line parallel to the base. Roberts’ coupler curve be-
longs to this family. Watt’s does not. For the family of symmetric coupler
curves the parameter Eqs.(17.104), (17.105) based on Fig. 17.27 are used11:

The symmetry-axis is the y -axis. The constant parameters of the four-bar
are ℓ, r , a , β , and the free parameter is the angle α . Intersection points

17.12 Coupler Curves with Prescribed Properties

Tschebychev determined parameters ℓ, r , a , β such that the coupler curve
is the optimal approximation to a straight line y = y0 = const. The diﬀerence
y(α) −y0 or rather a constant multiple of it is the function Δn = Pn −F .
With n = 2 it is written in the form
Δ2 =
2ℓ
(ℓ2 −r2) cos β [y(α) −y0] = p0f0(α) + p1f1(α) + p2f2(α) −F(α)
(17.145)
with the following functions and coeﬃcients
f0(α) = 1 ,
f1(α) = sin α cos α ,
f2(α) = sin2 α ,
F(α) = −cot α ,

(17.147)
In this formulation the problem appears as approximation of the function
F(α) = −cot α by P2 = p0f0 +p1f1 +p2f2 . In the interval 0 ≤α ≤π the
function P2 has at most two real roots. In the segment of the coupler curve
which is of interest the inequality 0 < α < π/2 holds. Thus, the condi-
tions for the applicability of Tschebychev’s theorem are satisﬁed. Equations
(17.141) read:
p0 + p1 sin α cos α + p2 sin2 α + cot α ± D = 0 .
(17.148)
According to the theorem each equation has (at least) one simple root and
one double root in the interval 0 < α < π/2 . This is, indeed, the case. The
equations can be written in the forms
sin(α −α1) sin2(α −α3) = 0 ,
sin(α −α4) sin2(α −α2) = 0
 
(17.149)
with constants
0 < α1 , . . . , α4 < π/2 . For the ﬁrst equation this is
shown as follows. With an addition theorem and after division through
sin α sin α1 sin2 α3 the equation has the form
(cot α1 −cot α)[1 + (cot2 α3 −1) sin2 α −2 cot α3 sin α cos α] = 0 . (17.150)
Multiplying out further leads to
cot α1 + 2 cot α3 + (1 −2 cot α1 cot α3 −cot2 α3) sin α cos α
+ [(cot2 α3 −1) cot α1 −2 cot α3] sin2 α −cot α = 0 .
(17.151)
This is indeed Eq.(17.148). In the case +D , comparison of coeﬃcients yields

In the same way the second Eq.(17.149) and Eq.(17.148) with −D yield

The results obtained so far are summarized as follows. Each of the equations
Δ2 = ±D has in the interval 0 < α < π/2 a simple root ( α1 or α4 ) and a
double root ( α2 or α3 ). Suppose that α1 < α4 . The graph of the optimal
function Δ2 is as shown in Fig. 17.36 with α instead of x . The roots α1
and α4 are the boundaries of the approximation interval.
The six Eqs.(17.152) – (17.155) suﬃce for determining the unknowns
D , p0 , p1 , p2 , α2 and α3 as functions of α1 and α4 . The two Eqs.(17.142),
which are valid for x = α2 and for x = α3 , are not needed because
Eqs.(17.148) are available in the explicit form (17.149). Solutions for the
unknowns are obtained as follows. Equations (17.152) and (17.154) yield
p0 = −1
2(cot α4 + cot α1) −(cot α3 + cot α2) ,
(17.156)
D =
1
2(cot α1 −cot α4) + (cot α3 −cot α2) .
(17.157)
With (17.153) and (17.155)
p1
p2
= −tan(α1 + 2α3) = −tan(α4 + 2α2) .
(17.158)
From this it follows that either
α1 + 2α3 = α4 + 2α2
(17.159)
or
α1 + 2α3 = α4 + 2α2 + π . From these two equations and from (17.153)
and (17.155) it follows that either
(1 −cos 2α3) sin α1 = (1 −cos 2α2) sin α4
(17.160)
or
(1 −cos 2α3) sin α1 = −(1 −cos 2α2) sin α4 . Because of the restriction
0 < α1, α4 < π/2 only (17.159) together with (17.160) is useful. Equation
(17.159) yields
α3 = α2 + 1
2(α4 −α1) .

With the corresponding expression
cos 2α3 = cos 2α2 cos(α4 −α1) −
sin 2α2 sin(α4 −α1) Eq.(17.160) becomes an equation for α2 :
[sin α4 −sin α1 cos(α4 −α1)] cos 2α2
+ sin α1 sin(α4 −α1) sin 2α2 = sin α4 −sin α1 .
(17.162)
Of its two solutions for α2 only one is located between α1 and α4 . Only
this solution is useful. The associated angle α3 is calculated from (17.161).
Following this, Eqs.(17.155) – (17.157) determine p0 , p1 , p2 and D as func-
tions of α1 and α4 .
The three Eqs.(17.147) relate the seven quantities
α1 , α4 , ℓ, y0 , r , a
and β . These relations are expressed as follows. Equating the two expressions
for p0 in (17.147) and (17.156) yields for y0 the expression shown below.
Similarly, equating the two expressions for p1 in (17.147) and (17.153) yields
for a2 the expression shown below. Finally, equating the expressions for
p2/p1 in (17.147) and (17.158) yields for tan β the two expressions shown
below.

Four out of the seven quantities
α1 , α4 , ℓ, y0 , r , a and β can (within
certain limits) be prescribed arbitrarily. The base length ℓis prescribed as
unit length. The interval boundaries α1 and α4 are associated with certain
points (x1, y1) and (x4, y4) , respectively, of the coupler curve which are de-
termined by (17.143). It is the segment of the coupler curve between these
points which is approximated to the straight line y = y0 . Now, it is decided
that one of these points, say (x1, y1) , is located on the symmetry axis. Be-
cause of the symmetry this has the consequence that the coupler curve is
approximated in the segment of double length between the points (−x4, y4)
and (x4, y4) . According to (17.144) the condition
x1 = 0 has one of the
forms sin α1 = (ℓ∓r)/(2a) . By an investigation which is omitted here it can
be shown that a better approximation of the straight line y = y0 is achieved
when the plus sign is chosen:
sin α1 = ℓ+ r
2a
.
(17.166)
The angle α1 is real only if the four-bar to be determined is a crank-rocker.
Whether the results satisfy this condition remains to be seen.
The third quantity we prescribe is β = 0 . This means that the coupler
point lies on the coupler line. Having made these decisions on ℓ, α1 and β

a one-parametric manifold of four-bars is left. As parameter the ratio
ϱ = r
ℓ
(17.167)
is chosen. It should be noted that Roberts’ four-bar is a double-rocker with
an angle β ̸= 0 . Thus, the straight-line approximations to be determined are
of a diﬀerent nature12.
The next task is to express the quantities y0 and a in (17.163) and
(17.164) in terms of ℓand ϱ . In addition, two new quantities are deﬁned
which are measures of quality of the approximation. These are the relative
length L/ℓ= 2x4/ℓ= 2x(α4)/ℓof the approximately straight segment and
the relative width
B/L = 2(y −y0)max/L
of the error in this segment.
These quantities are expressed in terms of ϱ . This is done ﬁrst for B/ℓ.

With β = 0 Eqs.(17.165) take the simple forms
2α3 = π
2 −α1 ,
2α2 = π
2 −α4 .
(17.169)
With these expressions (17.160) becomes
(1 −sin α1) sin α1 = (1 −sin α4) sin α4 .
This has the trivial solution α4 = α1
and the signiﬁcant solution
sin α4 = 1 −sin α1 .
(17.170)
The ﬁrst Eq.(17.169) yields
sin(α1 + 2α3) = 1
and
cos 2α3 = sin α1
or
with (17.166) cos 2α3 = (ℓ+ r)/(2a) . Substitution of these expressions into
(17.164) leads to
a = ℓ
2(3 −ϱ) .
(17.171)
The parameter ϱ is free subject to the condition that the four-bar is a crank-
rocker. For this to be the case, r = ϱℓmust be the shortest link. In addition,
Grashof’s inequality (17.4), ℓmin + ℓmax ≤ℓ′ + ℓ′′ , must be satisﬁed. Both
conditions are satisﬁed if and only if 0 < ϱ ≤1 .
The expression obtained for a is substituted back into (17.166). With this
equation and with (17.169) and (17.170) the formulas are obtained:
12 Tschebychev [40] (p.273, p.285, p.301 and p.495) investigated also the case β ̸= 0 . Also
for this case he gave explicit formulas for a one-parametric family of four-bars. In [40] p.495
the approximation of a circle is investigated

From L/ℓand B/ℓthe second measure of quality B/L is calculated.
L > 0 requires that ϱ > 1/3 . The diagram in Fig. 17.37 shows as functions
of ϱ the ratios L/ℓand |B/L| characterizing the quality of the straight-line
approximation. The former should be large and the latter very small. These
goals are achieved with values of ϱ close to 1/3 .
Example: With ϱ = r/ℓ= .4 (17.171), (17.173), (17.176) and (17.174),
determine the coupler length
a = 1.3ℓ, the length
y0 ≈2.19ℓ
and the
measures of quality
L/ℓ≈1.44 and
|B/L| ≈.00020 . This is an excellent
straight-line approximation. The entire coupler curve is shown in Fig. 17.38 .
The four-bar is drawn in solid lines. Dashed lines show the cognate four-
bar generating the same coupler curve. For the signiﬁcance of the points
B0 , P1 and P2 see the comment following (17.100). For comparison: The
straight-line approximations by Watt / Evans (Fig. 17.34a,b ) and by Roberts
(Fig. 17.35) are not nearly as good. The measures of quality for Roberts’
approximation are L/ℓ≈1
and
|B/L| ≈.0068 . From Fig. 17.37 it is
seen that with increasing ϱ the measure of quality L/ℓimproves while the
essential measure of quality |B/L| deteriorates. For
ϱ = r/ℓ= .5 , for
example, the measures are
L/ℓ≈2.22 and
|B/L| ≈.0022 . This is still a
very good straight-line approximation. End of example.

17.13 Peaucellier Inversor
Until after Tschebychev’s work on straight-line approximations it was taken
for granted that no plane mechanism consisting of rigid links with rotary
joints could possibly generate an exact straight line. It caused, therefore,
quite a sensation when in 1864 Peaucellier [33] invented a simple mechanism
achieving just this13. The mechanism which became known as Peaucellier
inversor is shown in Fig. 17.39 . It has two ﬁxed points 0 and A a distance
a apart. A crank of length ϱ connects A to the point called P . This point
P is connected to 0 via two rods of equal length b and four rods of equal
length c < b . The trajectory of P is the circle k with the equation
(x −a)2 + y2 = ϱ2 .
(17.177)
13 The history of this invention see in Sylvester [38], v.3

In what follows, the trajectory of P′ is investigated. First, relationships be-
tween the polar coordinates of P and P′ are established. Both points have
equal polar coordinates ϕ , but diﬀerent polar coordinates r and r′ . The re-
lationship between r and r′ is established as follows. In terms of rM (polar
coordinate of M) and of auxiliary lengths d and h the polar coordinates are
r = rM −d and r′ = rM + d . Hence rr′ = r2
M −d2 . Also r2
M = b2 −h2 and
d2 = c2 −h2 . Therefore, ﬁnally,
rr′ = R2
(R2 = b2 −c2 = const > 0) .
(17.178)
The transformation of P into P′ or vice versa according to this equation is
called inversion in the circle
x2 + y2 = R2 .
(17.179)
The circle itself is called inversion circle k0 . Every point of k0 is trans-
formed into itself. The trajectory of P′ is the inverse of the circle k in k0 .
Its equation is obtained as follows. Let (x, y) and (x′, y′) be the cartesian
coordinates of P and P′, respectively. The two sets of coordinates are related
by the equations
x = x′ r
r′ = x′ R2
r′2 =
x′R2
x′2 + y′2 ,
y =

This is another circle centered on the x-axis. It is called the inverted circle
k′. Depending on R , a and ϱ the circles k and k0 may or may not intersect
in real points. If they intersect, k′ intersects the circle k0 in the same points
because every point of k0 is transformed into itself. In Fig. 17.39 the circles
intersect in two points. Let ξ be the x-coordinate of these points. Equations
(17.177) and (17.179) yield
ξ = R2 + a2 −ϱ2
2a
.
(17.182)
The circle k′ intersects the x-axis at the points
x1 =
R2
a + ϱ ,
x2 =
R2
a −ϱ .
(17.183)
In the limit ϱ →a the circle k′ degenerates. Its radius, its center point co-
ordinate as well as the point x2 of intersection with the x-axis tend toward
inﬁnity. In contrast, the other point of intersection tends toward the ﬁnite
point x1 = R2/(2a) . The point ξ tends toward the same point. Thus, the
circle k′ degenerates to the straight line
x = R2/(2a) and to a point at
inﬁnity. In Fig. 17.40 the limiting case ϱ = a is shown. Point P is moving
on the circle k passing through 0 , while P′ is moving along the straight line
x = R2/(2a) . In the example shown the circles k and k0 do not intersect. If
they intersect, also the trajectory of P′ passes through the points of intersec-
tion. If ϱ and a are diﬀerent, but almost identical, k′ is a circle of very large
radius which intersects the x-axis at a point very close to x1 = R2/(2a) . In
engineering such circular trajectories are as interesting as straight-line tra-
jectories. Peaucellier’s discovery inspired Hart [20], Sylvester [38] and Kempe
[23] to invent other mechanisms with rotary joints which generate straight
lines (see also Schoenﬂies/Gr¨ubler [35], Dijksman [9], Pavlin/Wohlhart [32],
Demaine/O’Rourke [7]).

17.14 Four-Bars Producing Prescribed Positions of the
Coupler Plane. Burmester Theory
The purpose of many linkages is to carry a planar object, i.e., a plane Σ ,
through an ordered set of prescribed positions 1, . . . , n relative to a reference
plane Σ0 . If the number n is suﬃciently small, this task can be achieved
by making Σ the coupler plane and Σ0 the frame of a four-bar (as will
be seen the condition is n ≤5 ). The moving four-bar carries the plane Σ
through a continuum of positions, to which the prescribed positions belong if
the free design parameters are chosen properly. The complete solution to this
problem which is due to Burmester [5] is the subject of this chapter. Exten-
sive use is made of Sect. 14.5 in which fundamental concepts of Burmester
were introduced. See the deﬁnitions of homologous points of points of Σ , of
pole triangle, pole quadrilateral and pole curve. Burmester’s basic idea is the
following. The two Σ -ﬁxed endpoints of the coupler move on circles about
frame-ﬁxed endpoints of two cranks (or rockers). Hence the problem can be
stated as follows. Determine all n -tuples of homologous points Q1, . . . , Qn
which are located on a circle and for each such n -tuple the center Q0 of the
circle. The line segments Q0Qi (i = 1, . . . , n) deﬁned by each such n -tuple
represent the positions of a suitable crank in the positions Σ1, . . . , Σn of the
coupler plane Σ . Two arbitrarily chosen n -tuples of this kind deﬁne two
suitable cranks and, thus, a four-bar. Whether a four-bar thus determined
produces the prescribed positions in the prescribed order remains to be seen.
The problem of order is the subject of Sect. 17.14.4 .
In what follows, n homologous points on a circle are called circle points,
and the center of the circle is called center point. The slider-crank mechanism
in Fig. 17.29a is a degenerate four-bar in that one center point Q0 is at
inﬁnity. The circle is a straight line. The elliptic trammel in Fig. 15.4 has
two sliders. In the inverted slider-crank mechanism in Fig. 17.29b and in the
inverted elliptic trammel the sliders are pivoted at center points Q0 ﬁxed in
Σ0 . The associated circle points Q1, . . . ,Qn are at inﬁnity. In the mechanism
shown in Fig.15.9 one slider is pivoted in the frame Σ0 and the other in the
coupler Σ . This mechanism equals its inverse.
17.14.1 Three Prescribed Positions
Three prescribed positions can be generated by four-bars of all types including
the previously listed degenerate forms. Three prescribed positions determine
a pole triangle (P12 ,P23 ,P31 ). Since three points are always located on a
circle, one out of three circle points Q1 , Q2 , Q3 can be chosen arbitrarily.
The other two circle points are then found as is shown in Fig. 14.11 by
17.14 Four-Bars Producing Prescribed Positions of the Coupler Plane. Burmester Theory

17 Planar Four-Bar Mechanism
reﬂections in the sides of the pole triangle. The center point Q0 is the center
of the circumcircle of the triangle (Q1,Q2,Q3).
Instead of a single circle point the center point Q0 can be chosen arbitrar-
ily. The associated circle points Q1 , Q2 , Q3 are determined either geometri-
cally by the pole triangle (Fig. 14.13) or analytically from (14.50). Following
Fig. 14.13 special cases (a) and (b) were explained when a pole is chosen
either as center point or as circle point.
Figure 14.14 explains how to determine solutions with a center point Q0 at
inﬁnity and with circle points Q1, Q2, Q3 along a straight line. The straight
line is passing through the orthocenter S of the pole triangle. If the line is
prescribed, the circle points are determined, and if a single circle point is
prescribed, the line and the other two circle points are determined.
Figure 14.15 explains how to determine solutions with circle points lying
at inﬁnity. As center point Q0 an arbitrary point on the circumcircle of the
pole triangle can be chosen. The chosen point determines the directions Q0Qi
(i = 1, 2, 3) in the three positions. They are the normals to the lines Q0Si .
Instead of Q0 the direction towards a single inﬁnitely distant circle point,
say Q3 , can be chosen. It determines the line Q0S3 and, consequently, Q0
and the other two directions.
17.14.2 Four Prescribed Positions. Center Point
Curve. Circle Point Curves
Four prescribed positions of the coupler plane determine six poles, four pole
triangles, three pole quadrilaterals and the associated pole curve p (see Figs.
14.18 and 14.22). The pole curve is the geometric locus of all points from
which opposite sides of a pole quadrilateral are seen under angles which are
either identical or which add up to π . The present problem is to determine
all four-tuples of homologous points Q1 , Q2 , Q3 , Q4 which are located on
a circle and for each circle the center point Q0 . Following Burmester the
geometric locus of all center points thus deﬁned is called center point curve.
Proposition: The center point curve is the pole curve. Proof: Figure 17.41
shows four homologous points Q1 , Q2 , Q3 , Q4 on a circle with center Q0 .
Homologous means that the poles of the pole quadrilateral (P12,P23,P34,P41)
are located somewhere on the dashed bisectors of the angles of rotation ϕij =
∢(QiPijQj) (i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 diﬀerent). From Q0 the opposite sides P12P23
and P34P41 are seen under the angles
1
2 (β12 + β23) and
1
2 (β34 + β41) ,
respectively. Since β12 + β23 + β34 + β41 = 2π , these angles add up to π . If
a pole, say P41 , is located on the other side of Q0 , the two opposite sides of
the pole quadrilateral are seen under identical angles. End of proof.
Thus, both cranks of any four-bar capable of leading the coupler plane
through four prescribed positions must be centered on the pole curve. The

Fig. 17.41 Pole quadrilateral with four circle points and center point Q0
problem of determining circle points associated with a chosen center point
or of determining the center point associated with a chosen circle point is
reduced to the previously solved problem with three prescribed positions
since a solution satisfying four prescribed positions 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 satisﬁes any
three positions, for example, positions 1 , 2 , 3 and positions 1 , 2 , 4 . Hence
circle points associated with a chosen center point Q0 are determined either
geometrically from pole triangles (Fig. 14.13) or analytically from Eqs.(14.50)
which are now valid for the larger set of indices i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 ( i ̸= j ).
Special case: As center point Q0 a pole is chosen, for example, Q0=P12 .
From the text following Fig. 14.13 (special case (a)) it is known that in the
pole triangle associated with positions 1 , 2 , 3 Q3 is an undetermined point
on the line P23P31 . For the same reason, Q3 is an undetermined point on
the line P34P41 in the pole triangle associated with positions 1 , 3 , 4 . Hence
Q3 is the point of intersection of these two lines.
There is only a single solution with a center point Q0 at inﬁnity and with
circle points Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 along a straight line. The center point Q0 is the
inﬁnitely distant point on the asymptote of the pole curve. The straight line
is orthogonal to the asymptote. Since it is passing through the orthocenters,
of all four pole triangles (see Fig. 14.14) collinearity of these orthocenters is
proved.
Likewise, there is only a single solution with circle points Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4
at inﬁnity. From Fig.14.15 it is known that the center point Q0 is located
on the circumcircles of all four pole triangles. These circles have a single
point of intersection U (Fig. 14.22). As in the case of three positions, the
directions Q0Qi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) toward the inﬁnitely distant circle points are
determined from pole triangles (Fig. 14.15). A center point Q0 on p close to
U is associated with a very long crank with very distant circle points.
Circle point curves:
The geometric locus of the circle point Qi is called
circle point curve ki ( i = 1, 2, 3, 4 ). If a single circle point curve, say k1 ,
is known, the other three curves are obtained by rotating k1 about poles.
From Fig. 14.13 and Eq.(14.50) it is known that Q1 and Q0 switch roles if

the angles ϕ12 and ϕ13 are replaced by −ϕ12 and −ϕ13 , respectively. This
means that the pole P23 is replaced by its reﬂection P1
23 in the side P12P 31
of the pole triangle (see Fig. 14.12). With other indices the same is true for
the other two pole triangles (P12,P24,P41) and (P13,P34,P41) associated with
Q1 . In these triangles P24 and P34 are replaced by the reﬂected poles P1
24
and P1
34 , respectively. Hence the conclusion: The circle point curve k1 is the
center point curve (pole curve) associated with the six poles P12 , P13 , P14 ,
P1
23 , P1
24 , P1
34 . The curve passes through these six poles. It does not pass
through the poles P23 , P24 , P34 . With indices properly changed the same is
true for the circle point curves k2 , k3 and k4 .
17.14.3 Five Prescribed Positions
Center points Q0 are located on the center point curve associated with the
four positions 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 as well as on the center point curve associated
with the four positions 1 , 2 , 3 , 5. Two third-order curves have nine (real
or imaginary) points of intersection. Since the curves are circular, there exist
two imaginary points of intersection at inﬁnity. This leaves seven points of
intersection. Each of the two curves passes through the poles P12 , P23 und
P31 . That these points cannot be center points Q0 is proved by taking P12 as
example. According to statements made earlier positions 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 require
Q3 to be the point of intersection of the lines P23P31 and P34P41 . For the
same reason, positions 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 require Q3 to be the point of intersection
of the lines P23P31 and P35P51 . This is impossible. End of proof.
Hence either zero or two or four real points of intersection are candidates as
center point Q0 , namely, those real points which are diﬀerent from P12 , P23
and P31 . These points are called Burmester points. For methods of construc-
tion of these points see M¨uller [29]. No four-bar producing ﬁve prescribed
positions exists if the number of Burmester points is zero. A single four-bar
exists if the number is two and six if the number is four. This completes the
solution of Burmester’s problem in the case of ﬁve prescribed positions. More
than ﬁve positions cannot, in general, be prescribed.
17.14.4 Crank-Rockers Producing Four Prescribed
Positions in Prescribed Order
A Burmester solution for four prescribed positions is inadmissible if the four-
bar produces the prescribed positions either in a wrong order or in two dif-
ferent conﬁgurations of the four-bar. The problem of identifying admissible
solutions was ﬁrst investigated by Filemon [12, 13] and since then by many re-

searchers. A list of 170 references is given in Balli/Chand [3]. In what follows,
Filemon’s method of identifying all admissible crank-rockers is described.
A crank-rocker is producing four prescribed positions in the prescribed or-
der 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 if the circle points on the crank circle are arranged in the order
Q1 , Q2 , Q3 , Q4 either clockwise or counterclockwise. For this to be the case,
the three triangles of circle points (Q1,Q2,Q3), (Q2,Q3,Q4) and (Q3,Q4,Q1 )
must have one and the same sense. For the deﬁnition of sense of a triangle
see Fig. 14.16 and the accompanying text. The sense is determined by the
location of the center point Q0 relative to the three lines of the correspond-
ing pole triangle. Four pole triangles have altogether twelve lines dividing
the inﬁnite plane into domains. From Fig. 14.22 the following properties of
the center point curve are known. The curve is intersected by lines at the six
poles Pij , at the six points Πij
(i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 diﬀerent) and at no other
point. From this and from Fig. 14.16 the following conclusions are drawn.
When Q0 travels on p through a pole Pij
(i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 diﬀerent), two
lines belonging to one and the same pole triangle are crossed. This crossing
has no eﬀect on the sense of any triangle of circle points. In contrast, when
Q0 travels through a point Πij (i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 diﬀerent), two lines belong-
ing to diﬀerent pole triangles are crossed. This has the consequence that two
triangles of circle points change sense. The six points Πij
(i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4
diﬀerent) divide the curve into seven sections (no matter whether the curve
is unicursal or bicursal). The senses of circle point triangles do not change as
long as Q0 stays in one and the same section of the curve. Identical senses
of all three circle point triangles are achieved with a set of points Q0 which
is either a single section or the union of several nonneighboring sections. In
what follows, the set is denoted σc.
Example: In Fig. 14.22 the sense of the three circle point triangles is clock-
wise for points Q0 in the unbounded section to the right of Π12 and in the
section Π14-Φ- Π34 . It is counterclockwise in the unbounded section to the
left of Π23 . Thus, the set σc of admissible crank centers is the union of these
three sections.
From Fig. 17.4b the following properties of crank-rockers are known. A
four-bar is a crank-rocker if
(a) Grashof’s inequality condition ℓmin + ℓmax ≤ℓ′ + ℓ′′ is satisﬁed and if,
in addition,
(b) the crank has the minimal length ℓmin .
The angular range of a rocker consists of two disconnected sectors < 180◦
which are arranged symmetrically with respect to the base line. For being an
admissible crank-rocker a Burmester solution must satisfy condition
(c) all four circle points of the rocker must be on one and the same side of the
base line, for otherwise the four prescribed positions could not be produced
without disconnecting and reassembling the crank-rocker.
An algorithm determining, for a given center point curve p , all admissible
crank-rockers can now be formulated as follows.

17 Planar Four-Bar Mechanism
Choose an arbitrary point Q0r of p and an arbitrary point Q0c of the set σc
(the indices r and c stand for rocker and crank, respectively). Determine the
circle point Q1r associated with Q0r and the circle point Q1c associated with
Q0c . These four points determine a four-bar in the prescribed position 1 . If
this four-bar does not satisfy conditions (a) and (b), choose another point
Q0c of the set σc and repeat. Otherwise, determine also the circle points Q2r ,
Q3r , Q4r associated with Q0r and check whether condition (c) is satisﬁed. If
not, choose another point Q0c of the set σc and repeat. Otherwise, Q0r and
Q0c are centers of the rocker and of the crank of an admissible crank-rocker.
The sequence of decisions thus described has to be made for every point Q0r
of p in combination with every point Q0c of the set σc.
17.15 Trajectory of the Center of Mass of a Four-Bar
In Fig. 17.42a r0 , r1 , r2 , r3 represent diﬀerences of complex numbers in
the complex plane. All of them have constant absolute values. They form a
quadrilateral. The relation between the four is
r2 = r1 + r3 −r0 .
(17.184)
Let it be assumed that r0 has constant direction. Then the diﬀerences of
complex numbers form a mobile four-bar with base r0 . For any coupler-ﬁxed
point C a complex constant z exists such that
A1C = zr3 .
(17.185)
When the four-bar is moving, the tip of the complex number
rC = r1 + zr3
(17.186)
traces the coupler curve generated by C .
The moving links i =1, 2, 3 have masses mi and centers of mass Si (Fig.
17.42b ). The positions of the centers of mass on the bodies are expressed in
the form
ϱi = ziri
(i = 1, 2, 3)
(17.187)
with complex constants zi . Let rS be the complex number representing the
composite system center of mass S of the four-bar (the moving parts only).
It is determined by the formula

17.15 Trajectory of the Center of Mass of a Four-Bar
635
Fig. 17.42 Four-bar with coupler point C (a) and with centers of mass (b)
rS = m1ϱ1 + m3(r1 + ϱ3) + m2(r0 + ϱ2)
m1 + m2 + m3
= m1z1r1 + m3(r1 + z3r3) + m2[r0 + z2(r1 + r3 −r0)]
m1 + m2 + m3
= (m1z1 + m2z2 + m3)r1 + (m2z2 + m3z3)r3 + m2(1 −z2)r0
m1 + m2 + m3
.
(17.188)
In the general case m1z1 + m2z2 + m3 ̸= 0 ,
rS = m1z1 + m2z2 + m3
m1 + m2 + m3

r1 +
m2z2 + m3z3
m1z1 + m2z2 + m3
r3

+ m2(1 −z2)r0
m1 + m2 + m3
.
(17.189)
The term in parentheses has the form (17.186) with
z =
m2z2 + m3z3
m1z1 + m2z2 + m3
.
(17.190)
The complex number rC moves along the coupler curve of the coupler-ﬁxed
point C speciﬁed by this constant z . The constant complex factor in front
has the eﬀect of a stretch-rotation of this coupler curve and the constant
behind has the eﬀect of a translatory displacement. Hence the trajectory of
the composite center of mass of a moving four-bar is similar to a uniquely
determined coupler curve of the four-bar.
The acceleration of the composite center of mass determines the resultant
inertia force acting on the base of the four-bar. The resultant force is zero
throughout the motion if (17.188) yields rS = const. This is the case under
the weak conditions
m1z1 + m2z2 + m3 = 0 ,
m2z2 + m3z3 = 0 .
(17.191)
In these conditions the link lengths do not appear. The four link lengths,
the three masses and, in addition, the position of the center of mass on
a single link, for example, the number z3 , can be chosen arbitrarily. Both

636

conditions are satisﬁed if the centers of mass on the other two bodies satisfy
the conditions
z1 = m3
m1
(z3 −1) ,
z2 = −m3
m2
z3 .
(17.192)
Note that for producing the time-varying angular acceleration of the coupler
a torque is required. Even if the conditions (17.191) are satisﬁed this torque
causes time-varying forces of equal magnitude and opposite directions acting
on the base in the crank bearings.

Spherical Four-Bar Mechanism
From Sect. 5.4.1 it is known that the spherical four-bar mechanism or brieﬂy
spherical four-bar is a special mechanism RCCC . Figure 18.1a is a copy of
Fig. 5.4 . The four-bar has four revolute joints the axes of which intersect in a
single point 0 . The links are shown as arcs of great circles on the unit sphere
about 0 . Constant parameters αi > 0 , joint variables ϕi and associated unit
vectors ni and ai (i = 1, . . . , 4) were deﬁned as follows. The unit vectors
n1, . . . , n4 along the joint axes are pointing away from 0 . The unit vector
ai has the direction of ni × ni+1 (here and in what follows, i = 1, . . . , 4
cyclic). The angle αi is the angle about ai from ni to ni+1 . This angle is
the arc length (link length) of link i . Throughout this chapter it is assumed
that αi ≤π . The joint variable ϕi is the angle about ni from ai−1 to
ai . In what follows, link 4 is considered as frame, link 1 as input link, link
2 as coupler and link 3 as output link. This means that the angles ϕ1 and
ϕ4 represent the input angle and the output angle, respectively. Since the
spherical four-bar is a special mechanism RCCC , it is governed by the same

equations relating joint variables ϕ1, . . . , ϕ4 and parameters α1, . . . , α4 . On
the other hand, the spherical four-bar shares many characteristics with the
planar four-bar. In the limit αi →0 (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) it is a planar four-bar in
a plane tangent to the sphere (Fig. 18.1b).
18.1 Transfer Function
The transfer function relating the angles ϕ1 and ϕ4 is known from the
analysis of the mechanism RCCC . It is copied from (5.43) and (5.44):
A cos ϕ4 + B sin ϕ4 = R
(18.1)
with coeﬃcients (abbreviations Ci = cos αi and Si = sin αi )
A = −S3(S4C1 + C4S1 cos ϕ1) ,
B = S1S3 sin ϕ1 ,
R = C2 −C3(C4C1 −S4S1 cos ϕ1) .
 
(18.2)
The equation has two solutions ϕ4 which are determined by their sines and
cosines:
cos ϕ4k = AR + (−1)kB

A2 + B2 −R2

sin ϕ4k = BR −(−1)kA

(k = 1, 2) .
(18.3)
In the case αi ≪1 (i = 1, 2, 3, 4), when the spherical four-bar approximates
a planar four-bar in a plane tangent to the sphere the coeﬃcients A , B , R
are represented by their second-order approximations
A ≈−α3(α1 cos ϕ1 + α4) ,
B ≈α1α3 sin ϕ1 ,
R ≈α1α4 cos ϕ1 −1
2(α2
2 −α2
1 −α2

4) .
 
(18.4)
Compare this with the transfer function of the planar four-bar given in (17.10)
and (17.11). In these equations the following changes of notation are necessary
(see Fig. 18.1b). The input angle ϕ of the planar four-bar is identiﬁed with
ϕ1 −π and the output angle ψ with 2π −ϕ4 . The link lengths r1 , a , r2 , ℓ
of the planar four-bar are given the new names α1 , α2 , α3 , α4 , respectively.
Following these changes (17.10) and (17.11) are identical with (18.1), (18.4).

18.2 Grashof Type Conditions
641
18.2 Grashof Type Conditions
Grashof’s conditions for the planar four-bar were deduced from Figs. 17.1a,b,c
which show limit positions of the input link. These positions are characterized
by collinearity of coupler and output link. In the case of the spherical four-bar,
the equivalence to collinearity of coupler and output link is the coincidence
of the great circles of coupler and output link. If, for convenience, great-circle
arcs are drawn as straight lines, the Figs. 18.2a,b,c are equivalent to Figs.
17.1a,b,c . The triangles are spherical triangles. The angles φ1 and φ2 are
limit values of the input angle ϕ1 . The cosine law for spherical triangles
yields the equations
cos(α3 ± α2) = cos α1 cos α4 + sin α1 sin α4 cos(φ1,2 −π) .
(18.5)
Hence
cos φ1,2 = cos α1 cos α4 −cos(α3 ± α2)
sin α1 sin α4
.
(18.6)
The same expressions are obtained from the condition that in (18.3) A2 +
B2 −R2 = 0 . Equations (18.2) yield (with the abbreviations c1 = cos ϕ1 and
s1 = sin ϕ1 )
A2 + B2 −R2 =

(18.8)
The roots c1 of this expression are, indeed, the quantities in (18.6).
The input link is fully rotating relative to the base if Eqs.(18.5) yield
cos(φ1 −π) ≥+1 as well as cos(φ2 −π) ≤−1 . These are the conditions
cos(α4 + α1) ≥cos(α3 + α2) ,
cos(α3 −α2) ≥cos(α4 −α1) .
(18.9)
The special case of four identical link lengths α1 = α2 = α3 = α4 is treated
ﬁrst. Equations (18.5) yield φ1 −π = 0 , φ2 −π = π . This means that the
input link can rotate full circle relative to the base.
In what follows, it is assumed that at least two link lengths are diﬀerent.
Let αmin and αmax ̸= αmin be the smallest and the largest link length,
respectively, and let α′ and α′′ be the other link lengths so that αmin ≤
α′ , α′′ ≤αmax . Because of the assumption 0 < αi ≤π (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) the
second condition (18.9) is equivalent to
|α3 −α2| ≤|α4 −α1| .
(18.10)
The ﬁrst condition is satisﬁed if
either
α4 + α1 ≤α3 + α2 ≤2π −(α4 + α1)
or
2π −(α4 + α1) ≤α3 + α2 ≤α4 + α1 .
 
(18.11)
Condition (18.10) and the ﬁrst condition (18.11) are satisﬁed if and only if
α1 + α4 ≤π ,
α1 + α2 + α3 + α4 ≤2π ,
α1 = αmin
or
α4 = αmin ,
αmin + αmax ≤α′ + α′′ .
 
(18.12)
Condition (18.10) and the second condition (18.11) are satisﬁed if and only
if
α1 + α4 ≥π ,
α1 + α2 + α3 + α4 ≥2π ,
α1 = αmax
or
α4 = αmax ,
αmin + αmax ≥α′ + α′′ .
 
(18.13)
In conclusion, link 1 is a fully rotating crank if either the set of conditions
(18.12) or the set of conditions (18.13) is satisﬁed. The last two of the con-

18.3 Coupler Curves
643
ditions (18.12) are formally identical with Grashof’s condition for the pla-
nar four-bar. Conditions (18.13) are diﬀerent. Examples: Conditions (18.12)
are satisﬁed by the set of parameters α1 = 50◦, α2 = 100◦, α3 = 120◦,
α4 = 80◦, and conditions (18.13) are satisﬁed by the set of parameters
α1 = 120◦, α2 = 70◦, α3 = 100◦, α4 = 160◦. The above results apply
also to the mechanism RCCC .
Like planar four-bars also spherical four-bars fall into the categories of
crank-rockers, double-cranks, double-rockers and foldable four-bars. A spher-
ical four-bar is foldable if αmin + αmax = α′ + α′′ .
18.3 Coupler Curves
Every point C ﬁxed on the coupler of a moving spherical four-bar traces a
coupler curve which is located on a sphere. Without loss of generality the
point C is chosen on the unit sphere. Together with the endpoints A and B
of the coupler the point C creates a coupler-ﬁxed spherical triangle (A,B,C).
In Fig. 18.3 arcs of great circles are schematically represented by straight
lines. As parameters of the coupler triangle the angles α5 , α6 and α7 are
chosen. They are equivalent to the parameters b1 , b2 and β of the coupler
triangle of the planar four-bar in Fig. 17.19. As coordinates of the coupler
point C its geographical longitude u and its geographical latitude v are
used (A0 and B0 lie in the equatorial plane; u = 0 at A0). The meridian
passing through C deﬁnes the point D on the equator.

18.3.1 Implicit Equation for Coupler Curves
To be determined is an implicit equation of the coupler curve in the form
f(u, v, α1, α3, α4, α5, α6, α7) = 0 . The following derivation is due to Dobro-
volski [1]. It is analogous to the development for the planar four-bar (see
Fig. 17.19 and Eqs.(17.78) – (17.84)). Temporarily, the auxiliary variables
α , ε and δ are used. Spherical cosine and sine laws applied to the triangle
(A,D,C) and the spherical cosine law applied to the triangle (A,D,A0) yield
the equations
cos α = cos δ −C5 cos v
S5 sin v
,
cos ε = S5
sin α
sin δ ,
cos ε = C1 −cos δ cos u
sin δ sin u
.
(18.14)
From the identity of the last two expressions it follows that
cos δ = C1 −S5 sin α sin u
cos u
.
(18.15)
Substitution of this expression into the ﬁrst Eq.(18.14) results in the following
equation which is linear with respect to both sin α and cos α :
S5(sin u sin α + cos u sin v cos α) = C1 −C5 cos u cos v .
(18.16)
The same equations are formulated for the triangles (B,D,C) and (B,D,B0).
They are obtained by replacing in the above equations
u , α1 , α5 , α by
α4 −u , α3 , α6 , α7 −α , respectively. To sin(α7 −α) and to cos(α7 −α)
addition theorems are applied. The equation equivalent to (18.16) then reads
S6
#
[S7 sin v cos(α4 −u) −C7 sin(α4 −u)] sin α + [C7 sin v cos(α4 −u)
+S7 sin(α4 −u)] cos α
$
= C3 −C6 cos(α4 −u) cos v .
(18.17)
These two equations are solved for sin α and cos α . Let Δ be the coeﬃcient
determinant. It is a simple expression if also sin(α4 −u) and cos(α4 −u)
are developed:
Δ = S5S6[S4C7 sin v −C4S7 + S7 cos2 v cos u(S4 sin u + C4 cos u)] . (18.18)
In the numerator determinants for sin α and for cos α the expressions
sin(α4 −u) and cos(α4 −u) are kept unchanged. The resulting expressions
are

.
(18.20)
Substitution into the constraint equation cos2 α + sin2 α = 1 eliminates the
auxiliary variable α . The resulting equation is the desired implicit equation
of the coupler curve:

(18.21)
When this is multiplied out, the function sin(α4 −u) disappears. Only the
term cos(α4 −u) = S4 sin u + C4 cos u is left. The ﬁnal form of the equation
reads
S2
6(C1 −C5 cos u cos v)2[1 −cos2 v(S4 sin u + C4 cos u)2]

The condition for the coupler curve to pass through the north pole (the
south pole) of the sphere is that the equation is satisﬁed with v = π/2 (with
v = −π/2 ). These conditions are

Equation (18.22) can be written in a simpler form when the transition is
made to cartesian coordinates in an x, y, z-system deﬁned as follows1. The
origin is the center 0 of the sphere, the z, x-plane is the equatorial plane, the

z-axis passes through A0 , and the y-axis passes through the north pole. The
point on the sphere with geographical coordinates u , v has the cartesian
coordinates
x = sin u cos v ,
y = sin v ,
z = cos u cos v .
(18.25)
Every expression in (18.22) is an algebraic function of x , y and z . The
variable x occurs only in the form p = S4x + C4z . With this abbreviation
the equation becomes

This fourth-order polynomial equation deﬁnes a surface. Curves of intersec-
tion with planes z = const are conic sections. The coupler curve is the inter-
section of the surface with the unit sphere
x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 .
(18.27)
Proposition: An arbitrary circle on the sphere intersects the coupler curve in
eight (not necessarily real) points. This can also be expressed in the follow-
ing form. Given three circles a , b , c on a sphere and a spherical triangle
(A,B,C), there exist eight (not necessarily real) positions of the triangle in
which A lies on a , B on b and C on c . In Chap.17.8.3 on triangles and
circles in a plane the number of positions was found to be six (see the text
following (17.86)).
Proof: Intersection points are located on the fourth-order surface, on the
second-order sphere and in the plane of intersection of the circle with the
sphere. Let y = ax + bz + c be the equation of the plane. Substitution into
(18.27) and (18.26) results in the equation of an ellipse and in a fourth-order
equation with circularity zero, respectively. These two equations have eight
solutions (x, z). End of proof. In Sect. 18.3.6 other forms of proof are given.
18.3.2 Symmetrical Coupler Curves
From the planar four-bar it is known that points on the coupler line, and only
these points, generate coupler curves which are symmetrical with respect
to the base line. In the case of the spherical four-bar, the equivalence to
symmetry with respect to the base line is symmetry with respect to the x, z-
plane (the base plane). This symmetry exists if in (18.26) the variable y either
disappears altogether or appears in quadratic form only. The latter happens
if S7 = 0 (α7 = 0 or π/2) . This is the case when the point generating the

18.3 Coupler Curves
647
coupler curve is located on the great circle of the coupler. This represents a
direct analogy to the planar four-bar.
The variable y disappears altogether if either
α4 = π or
α3 = α6 =
α7 = π/2 or α1 = α5 = α7 = π/2 . The case α4 = π is the geometrically
trivial case that the input axis n1 and the output axis n4 are directed along
one and the same diameter of the sphere. In (18.26) not only y , but also
x disappears. After division through
(1 −z2) a quadratic equation for z
is left. Its solutions deﬁne two planes z ≡z1 and z ≡z2 . These planes
intersect the unit sphere (18.27) in two circles which represent the coupler
curve. Equation (18.1) has the form cos(ϕ1 −ϕ4) = (C2 + C1C3)/(S1S3) =
const .
The case α3 = α6 = α7 = π/2 is not trivial. Equation (18.26) has the
form F(x, z) = 0 . It deﬁnes a cylinder the generators of which are parallel
to the y-axis. The coupler curve is the line of intersection of this cylinder
with the sphere. From the identity α6 = α7 = π/2 it follows that also the
length α2 of the coupler equals π/2 . Thus, the coupler triangle is isosceles
with two right angles. The case α1 = α5 = α7 = π/2 diﬀers from the case
α3 = α6 = α7 = π/2 only in that input link and output link change their
roles.
From the planar four-bar it is known that coupler curves are symmetrical
with respect to the midnormal of the base if the four-bar and the coupler
triangle satisfy the symmetry conditions r1 = r2 and b1 = b2 , respectively
(see Fig. 17.26). The equivalent statement for the spherical four-bar is the
following. If the four-bar and the coupler triangle satisfy the symmetry condi-
tions α3 = α1 and α6 = α5 , respectively, the coupler curve is symmetrical
with respect to the plane spanned by the y-axis and the bisector of the angle
α4 . With
C3 = C1 , S3 = S1 , C6 = C5 , S6 = S5 Eq.(18.26) takes, after
simple re-arrangements of terms, the form
2[C2

5[S4C7y −S7(C4 −zp)]2 .
(18.28)
The bisector of α4 is made the ¯z-axis of a new cartesian ¯x, y, ¯z-system. The
transformation equations are
x = ¯x cos α4
2 + ¯z sin α4
2 , z = −¯x sin α4
2 + ¯z cos α4
2 , p = ¯x sin α4
2 + ¯z cos α4
2 .
(18.29)
The only variable terms in (18.28) are y , z2 + p2 , zp and z + p . For the
latter ones the expressions are obtained:

648
18 Spherical Four-Bar Mechanism
z2 + p2 = (1 + C4)¯z2 + (1 −C4)¯x2 ,
2zp = (1 + C4)¯z2 −(1 −C4)¯x2 ,
z + p = 2¯z cos α4

(18.30)
When this is substituted into (18.28), ¯x occurs only in the forms ¯x2 and
¯x4 . This conﬁrms the symmetry. For ¯x2 the expression 1−y2 −¯z2 obtained
from the equation of the sphere is substituted. The resulting equation is the
functional equation of the projection of the coupler curve onto the plane of
symmetry. The equation is of fourth order in both y and ¯z .
18.3.3 Geometrical Locus of Double Points
The linear Eqs.(18.16) and (18.17) for sin α and cos α do not have a unique
solution when the determinant Δ in (18.18) equals zero:
S4C7 sin v −C4S7 + S7 cos2 v cos u(S4 sin u + C4 cos u) = 0 .
(18.31)
This equation deﬁnes a curve τ on the unit sphere. The determinant appears
also on the right-hand side of (18.26). Thus, the equation Δ = 0 has the
alternative form
S4C7y −C4S7 + S7z(S4x + C4z) = 0 .
(18.32)
This equation deﬁnes a surface in the x, y, z-system. The curve τ is the
intersection of the surface with the unit sphere.
Indeterminacy of sin α and cos α means that a position of the coupler
point C on τ is produced by (at least) two positions of the four-bar with
diﬀerent angles α . This means that a point C on τ is a multiple point of
the coupler curve. For comparison: In the case of the planar four-bar, the
condition Δ = 0 deﬁnes the circle of singular foci with Eq.(17.87). Figure
17.22 was used for proving that the inverse statement is true: If the coupler
point C is at one and the same point in two (or more) diﬀerent positions of
the four-bar, this multiple point lies on the circle. Following Dobrovolski [2]
the same Fig. 17.22 is now used for proving that this statement holds true
for spherical four-bars if the word circle is replaced by curve τ . The straight
lines in the ﬁgure are interpreted as arcs of great circles on the unit sphere
and the angle β in the coupler triangle has the new name α7 . Repeating
the old arguments it is shown that the angle ∢(A0CB0) equals the angle α7
of the coupler triangle. In other words this means: The curve τ described by
(18.31) and (18.32) is the geometric locus of all points on the sphere from
which the base A0B0 is seen under the angle α7 . In the plane this property
deﬁnes the circle of singular foci (17.87). Like this circle also the curve τ

18.3 Coupler Curves
649
is uniquely determined by the base length α4 and by the angle α7 in the
coupler triangle.
In what follows, more properties of the curve τ are revealed. Special points
located on τ are the base points A0 and B0 and the points diametrically
opposed to these two. This can be veriﬁed by substituting the coordinates
(u, v) of these points into (18.31). The coordinates are (u, v) = (0, 0) , (0, π) ,
(α4, 0) and (α4, π) , respectively. Another proof uses the geometric argument
that from each of the four points the base A0B0 is seen under an arbitrary
angle and, thus, under the angle α7 .
Symmetry properties of the curve τ are revealed when (18.32) is trans-
formed into the ¯x, y, ¯z-system by substituting for x and z the expressions
from (18.29). This produces the equation
S4C7y −C4S7 + 1
2S7[(1 + C4)¯z2 −(1 −C4)¯x2] = 0 .
(18.33)
It is the principal-axes equation of a hyperbolic paraboloid. The curve τ is
the intersection of the paraboloid with the sphere. The curve is symmetrical
with respect to the ¯x, y-plane and also to the y, ¯z-plane. The same symmetry
properties are revealed by (18.31). With a new variable w deﬁned through
the equation u = w+α4/2 the two planes of symmetry are the planes w = 0
and w = π/2 . In terms of w the last term in (18.31) is
cos u(S4 sin u + C4 cos u) = cos(w + α4/2) cos(w −α4/2)
= 1
2(C4 + cos 2w)
(18.34)
so that (18.31) becomes
S4C7 sin v −C4S7 + 1
2S7 cos2 v(C4 + cos 2w) = 0 .
(18.35)
Equation (18.33) and the equation of the sphere are now used for for-
mulating equations for the projections of τ onto the two planes of sym-
metry. The equations are obtained by making in (18.33) the substitutions
¯x2 = 1 −y2 −¯z2 and ¯z2 = 1 −y2 −¯x2 , respectively. The projections turn
out to be the ellipses

In Fig. 18.4 these ellipses are shown for the three sets of parameters (α4, α7) =
(60◦, 30◦) , (60◦, 60◦) and (60◦, 90◦) . The circles represent the projections of
the unit sphere. Only the elliptic sections inside the circles belong to curves
τ .

(α4, α7) = (60◦, 30◦) , (60◦, 60◦) and (60◦, 90◦) , respectively
From the properties of the curve τ it follows that two spherical four-bars
have one and the same curve τ only if they have the same base points A0
and B0 and the same angle α7 . From this it follows that for spherical four-
bars there is no theorem equivalent to the Roberts-Tschebyschev Theorem
17.2. This is the most signiﬁcant qualitative diﬀerence between planar and
spherical four-bars.
In both projections in Fig. 18.4 the ellipse belonging to the parameters
(60◦, 60◦) is passing through the north pole. Hence, also the curve τ is
passing through the north pole. The general condition for a curve τ to pass
through a pole is that (18.35) be satisﬁed by v = π/2 (north pole) or by
v = −π/2 (south pole). This is the case if the parameters α4 and α7 satisfy
the condition sin(α4−α7) = 0 (north pole) or sin(α4+α7) = 0 (south pole).
Under these conditions (18.35) has the special forms (upper sign for north
pole)
cos 2w = cos α4
1 ∓sin v
1 ± sin v
↔
sin v = ∓cos 2w −cos α4
cos 2w + cos α4
.
(18.37)
These equations display the following properties. The curve has a double
point at the respective pole. At the double point the curve is tangent to the
two great circles w = α4 and w = −α4 . The entire curve is located between
these two great circles. It intersects the equator at the points w = α4/2
and w = −α4/2 (these are the base points A0 and B0). At w = 0 the
curve reaches its extremal geographical latitude v = ∓sin−1[(1−cos α4)/(1+
cos α4)] . The curve τ is unicursal in the case | tan α7| < | tan α4| and it is
bicursal in the case | tan α7| > | tan α4| .

18.3.4 Stereographic Projection
From the previous section it is known that double points of coupler curves
are located on the curve τ if these points are associated with two diﬀerent
positions of the spherical four-bar2. For making statements about the number
of double points algebraic equations in terms of two variables are needed for
the coupler curve and for the curve τ . Such equations are obtained by a
suitable projection. Parallel projections are not suitable because they may
produce double points to which no double point on the sphere corresponds.
Following Primrose/Freudenstein [7] a stereographic projection from a central
point Q located on the sphere onto the plane tangent to the sphere at the
point opposite Q is used. As central point Q the point opposite the base
point A0 is chosen. In contrast to Primrose/Freudenstein, not (18.22) written
in terms of geographical coordinates is used, but (18.26) written in terms of
the cartesian coordinates x, y, z . In the x, y, z-system the central point Q
has the coordinates (0, 0, −1) , and the plane of projection has the equation
z = 1 . Let P be an arbitrary point on the sphere with coordinates (x, y, z) ,
and let P′ with coordinates (ξ, η, 1) be the stereographic projection of P .
Because of the collinearity of Q , P and P′
ξ
x = η
y =
2
z + 1 .
(18.38)
Also x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 . Resolution of these equations for ξ and η yields
ξ =
2x
z + 1 ,
η =
2y
z + 1 .
(18.39)
Conversely, resolution for x , y and z yields
x =
4ξ
ξ2 + η2 + 4 ,
y =
4η
ξ2 + η2 + 4 ,
z = 4 −ξ2 −η2
ξ2 + η2 + 4 .
(18.40)
These expressions are substituted into (18.26). After multiplication with the
common denominator (ξ2 + η2 + 4)4 the following equation is obtained for
the stereographic projection of the coupler curve:
2 The double point produced by a foldable spherical four-bar in the folding position belongs
to two diﬀerent branches of the coupler curve and to a single position of the four-bar.
Therefore, this double point may or may not be located on τ

In multiplying out the factor (ξ2 +η2) is encountered repeatedly. Separation
of terms of orders eight, seven, six, ﬁve and lower results in an equation of
the form
p1(ξ2 + η2)4 + (ξ2 + η2)3(p2ξ + p3η) + (ξ2 + η2)2(p4ξ2 + p5ξη + p6η2
+ p7ξ + p8η) + . . . (fourth- and lower-order terms) = 0 .
(18.42)
The constant coeﬃcients p1 , p2 , . . . are complicated functions of the system
parameters α1 , . . . , α7 . The simplest coeﬃcient is p1 = [S4S6(C1 + C5)]2 .
The curve is of order eight with circularity four.
Equation (18.42) provides the basis for another proof of the theorem that
a coupler curve intersects a circle on the unit sphere in eight points. First,
it is proved that the stereographic projection of an arbitrary circle on the
sphere is itself a circle. This is done as follows. A circle on the unit sphere is
deﬁned by a point ﬁxed on the sphere and by an angle α . If (x0, y0, z0) and
(x, y, z) denote the coordinates of the ﬁxed point and of a point on the circle,
respectively, the equation of the circle is xx0+yy0+zz0 = cos α . Substitution
of the expressions (18.40) yields the equation of the stereographic projection
of the circle:
(ξ2 + η2)(z0 + cos α) −4(x0ξ + y0η + cos α) = 0 .
(18.43)
This, is indeed, the equation of a circle. Let now ξ0, η0 be the coordinates of
the center of this circle, and let r be its radius. The circle has the parameter
representation ξ = ξ0 + r cos γ , η = η0 + r sin γ . This yields ξ2 + η2 =
r2 + ξ2
0 + η2
0 + 2r(ξ0 cos γ + η0 sin γ) . These expressions are substituted into
(18.42). The resulting equation is of fourth order in cos γ and sin γ . The
substitution z = tan γ/2 leads to an 8th-order polynomial equation for z .
This ends the proof.
The proof can also be formulated as follows. The stereographic projection
of the coupler curve results in an 8th-order equation independent of which
point on the sphere is chosen as central point of the projection. The central
point can be chosen such that the given circle to be intersected by the coupler

18.3 Coupler Curves
653
curve is projected into a straight line. This line intersects the 8th-order curve
at eight points.
Next, the curve τ is subjected to the stereographic projection. Let τ ′
be this projection. On τ ′ the right-hand side expression of (18.41) is zero.
This is the desired equation of τ ′ . It is necessary to distinguish between the
general case α7 ̸= π/2 and the special case α7 = π/2 . The two equations
describing τ ′ read:
α7 ̸= π
2 :
(ξ2 + η2)(η −λξ −μ) + 4(η + λξ) = 0
(λ = tan α7 , μ = 4λ cot α4) ,
(18.44)

2 :
η = ±

4ξ

−ξ2 .
(18.45)
Equation (18.44) deﬁnes a curve of third order with circularity one. It is of
the same type as Burmester’s center point curve (see (14.53)). The factor of
(ξ2 +η2) yields the equation for the asymptote of the curve: η = λξ +μ . The
existence of an asymptote is due to the fact that the curve τ on the sphere
passes through the central point Q of the stereographic projection. Both the
origin and the point of intersection of the asymptote with the line η +λξ = 0
lie on τ ′ . The line η+λξ = 0 is tangent to τ ′ at the origin. From Eqs.(18.36)
it is known under which conditions τ ′ is unicursal, bicursal and double-point
curve, respectively. Furthermore, it is known that a double point is either the
north pole or the south pole. The projections of these points are the points
ξ = 0 , η = 2 and ξ = 0 , η = −2 , respectively.
Equations (18.42) and (18.44) for the projections of the coupler curve and
of the curve τ , respectively, determine the number of double points of coupler
curves. The orders eight and three, respectively, and the circularities four
and one, respectively, tell that the two curves have a total of sixteen points
of intersection. Thus, there is a total of eight double points. Two double
points lie at inﬁnity on the imaginary lines ξ = ±iη . Proposition: Two more
double points are the imaginary points with the coordinates3 ξ = −2C4/S4 ,
η = ±2i /S4 . Proof: Substitution of these coordinates yields ξ2 + η2 = −4 .
Three terms appearing in (18.41) are individually zero. These are the terms

This shows that both sides of the equation are individually zero. Thus, the
points are located not only on the projection of the coupler curve, but also
on the curve τ ′ . End of proof.

This leaves, ﬁnally, a maximum number of four real double points. That
this number can actually occur in a unicursal coupler curve is demonstrated
by Fig. 18.5 . It shows in stereographic projection the coupler curve and the
curve τ for the set of parameters
α1 = 85◦,
α2 = 82◦,
α3 = 100◦,
α4 = 90◦, α5 = α6 = 50◦( α2 , α5 and α6 determine α7 ≈117.8◦). Note:
In this ﬁgure the central point of the stereographic projection is the north
pole (the point y = 1 ). This has the advantage that the projection of the
curve τ is symmetric4.

α5 = α6 = 50◦, α7 ≈117.8◦
18.3.5 Cusps
As is known from the planar four-bar double points may degenerate into
cusps. Conditions for the occurrence of cusps are developed as follows (com-
pare with the formulation of condition (17.94) for the planar four-bar and
with Fig. 17.24). The coupler point C is located in a cusp when the coupler
is momentarily rotating about the axis 0C . Then A0 , A and C lie on a
great circle, and B0 , B and C lie on another great circle. This can happen
in altogether four diﬀerent conﬁgurations. The common feature is that the
4 Equation (18.33) is the principal-axes equation of τ . The pertinent transformation equa-
tions are
¯x =
4ξ
ξ2+ζ2+4 ,
y = ξ2+ζ2−4
ξ2+ζ2+4 ,
¯z =
4ζ
ξ2+ζ2+4 .
This projection produces the principal-axes equation of the curve shown in Fig. 18.5:
(ξ2 + ζ2)2 sin(α4 −α7) −8(ξ2 −ζ2) sin α7 −16 sin(α4 + α7) = 0

18.3 Coupler Curves

great-circle arcs of lengths α1 , α5 and of α3 , α6 are pairwise co-tangent.
In any such conﬁguration the base A0B0 is seen from C either under the
angle α7 or under the angle π −α7 . This proves again that cusps lie on the
curve τ . The four conﬁgurations are shown by Fig. 17.24 if the straight lines
are interpreted as great-circle arcs and if the notations are changed according
to Fig. 18.3. The cosine law applied to the spherical triangles (A0,B0,C) and
(A,B,C) yields the equations
C4 = cos(α1 + α5) cos(α3 + α6) + sin(α1 + α5) sin(α3 + α6)C7 ,
C2 = C5C6 + S5S6C7 .
 
(18.47)
Elimination of C7 = cos α7 results in a condition for the existence of cusps.
With the help of addition theorems it can be given the form
C1S3S5(C5 −C2C6) + S1C3S6(C6 −C2C5)
+ S1S3(C2
5 + C2
6 −C2C5C6 −1) + S5S6(C4 −C1C2C3) = 0 .
(18.48)
With reference to Fig. 17.24 the combination (S1, S3) can be replaced by
any of the combinations (−S1, S3) , (S1, −S3) and (−S1, −S3) . In Prim-
rose/Freudenstein [7] the numerical example is given: α1 = α3 = α4 = 90◦,
α5 = α6 = 30◦, α2 = cos−1 2
3 . With these parameters both the four-bar
and the coupler triangle are symmetric. Condition (18.48) is satisﬁed with all
four combinations (S1, S3) , (−S1, S3) , (S1, −S3) and (−S1, −S3) . Equa-
tion (18.47) yields C7 = −1/3 . The coupler curve with these parameters is
bicursal with two cusps in each branch. It is shown in Fig. 18.6 together with
the curve τ in the same stereographic projection that was used in Fig. 18.5 .

The coupler triangle is deﬁned as usual by the parameters α5 , α6 , α7 . In
addition, angular parameters η , ζ of the coupler point C and the auxiliary
angle χ are introduced. The parameters η , ζ are equivalent to the parame-

The goal of the following analysis is to express the coordinates x, y, z of the

and the stereographic coordinates ξ , η determined by (18.39) become func-

as linear combinations of ex , ey , ez with variable coeﬃcients.
Step 1 : Scalar multiplications of the second Eq.(18.51) by n2 , n3 and n2×n3
result in the equations (see Fig. 18.7)

Using (18.50) alternative expressions in terms of α5 , α6 , α7 only or in terms
of α2 , η , ζ only can be obtained, for example
C5 −C2C6 = S6(C5S6 −S5C6C7) ,

Step 2 : Figure 18.7 shows that n2 has in the x, y, z-system the coordinates
(with the abbreviations ci = cos ϕi , si = sin ϕi ) [ −S1c1
−S1s1 C1 ] .
Similarly, in the x∗, y, z∗-system n3 has the coordinates [ S3c4 −S3s4 C3 ] .
The transformation (18.49) yields the coordinates in the x, y, z-system:
[ C3S4+S3C4c4
−S3s4
C3C4−S3S4c4 ] . The x, y, z-coordinates of n2 and

they determine the coordinates of n2 × n3 in column 3 .

18.4 Spherical Parallel Robot
The spherical linkage with center 0 shown in Fig. 18.8 is a parallel robot.
The position of its triangular platform (A,B,C) is controlled by the angles
of rotation αi about ﬁxed (not necessarily orthogonal) axes. The kinematics
has been investigated by Gosselin, Sefriou and Richard [3, 4]. The problem
Fig. 18.8 Spherical parallel robot
of direct kinematics is to determine all positions of the platform when the
angles αi (i = 1, 2, 3) are given. The solution to this problem is found in
Sects. 18.3.1 and 18.3.4 . When the angles are given, the points A0 , B0 and C0
are ﬁxed. Imagine that in this position the connection C between the binary
link C0C and the triangle (A,B,C) is opened. The binary link is then free to
lead its point C on a circle about C0 , and the spherical four-bar A0ABB0
is free to lead its coupler-ﬁxed point C along a coupler curve. Hence C is
a point of intersection of this circle and this coupler curve. The maximum
number of real points of intersection was shown to be eight. The calculation
of these points is based either on Eqs.(18.26) and (18.27) or on Eq.(18.42).
Gosselin and Gagne [5] investigated the special case when all angular sys-
tem parameters equal π/2 . In what follows, their analysis is presented in a
modiﬁed form. In Fig. 18.9 the mutually orthogonal rotation axes e1
1 , e1
2 ,
e1
3 are directed along the edges of the ﬁxed cube 1 . The platform-ﬁxed axes
0A , 0B , 0C are the axes e2
1 , e2
2 , e2
3 along the edges of another cube 2
representing the platform. Each pair of binary links connects an axis on cube

1 to an axis on cube 2 . The labeling of axes and of pairs of binary links is
as follows. The pair connected to the axis e1
i which is operated by the angle
αi is referred to as pair i . It connects e1
i to e2
i+1 via the internal axis ni−1
(i = 1, 2, 3 cyclic). The orthogonality of axes of binary links is expressed by
the equations
n1 · e1
2 = 0 ,
n2 · e1
3 = 0 ,
n3 · e1
1 = 0 ,
(18.57)
n1 · e2
3 = 0 ,
n2 · e2
1 = 0 ,
n3 · e2
2 = 0 .
(18.58)
Let the null position α1 = α2 = α3 = 0 be the one in which for i = 1, 2, 3 the
triple of vectors e1
i , e2
i and ni coalesces. With this deﬁnition, the vectors
n1 , n2 , n3 have in basis e1 the coordinates (with abbreviations
Ci =
cos αi , Si = sin αi )
n1 = [ C2
0
−S2 ]T ,
n2 = [ −S3
C3
0 ]T ,
n3 = [ 0
−S1
C1 ]T .
(18.59)
With these coordinates and with the direction cosine matrix A deﬁned by
the equation e1 = A e2 the orthogonality conditions (18.58) have the forms
−S3a11 + C3a21 = 0 ,
−S1a22 + C1a32 = 0 ,
C2a13 −S2a33 = 0 . (18.60)
The problem of direct kinematics is to solve these equations for the direction
cosines when the angles αi (i = 1, 2, 3) are given. It is known that with three
angular position variables critical cases occur. Here, a critical case occurs
when a single angle equals π/2 or −π/2 . Example: From Fig. 18.9 it is
seen that α1 = π/2 is possible only in combination with α3 = 0 and with
n1 = e1
2 = e2
3 . In this position the platform is free to rotate about n1 , and
α2 is arbitrary independent of this rotation. Hence the platform position is

660
18 Spherical Four-Bar Mechanism
not controllable if α1 = π/2 . With a cyclic change of indices the same is
true for α2 = π/2 and for α3 = π/2 . In order to avoid critical positions the
robot must be operated in the range −π/2 < αi < π/2 (i = 1, 2, 3).
Solving Eqs.(18.60) is diﬃcult because of second-order constraint equa-
tions for direction cosines. The solution is simpler when the matrix is ex-
pressed in terms of Bryan angles. Following [5] the sequence of rotations is
deﬁned as follows (this diﬀers from the sequence chosen in Sect. 1.4). The
ﬁrst rotation is the one with angle φ3 about the axis e1
3 . Then follows the
rotation with angle φ2 about the actual position of e2
2 and then the ro-
tation with angle φ1 about the actual position of e2
1 . With this sequence
of rotations the direction cosine matrix is (with abbreviations ci = cos φi ,
si = sin φi )
A =
⎡

With direction cosines expressed in this form Eqs.(18.60) become

c1(C2c3s2 −S2c2) +s1C2s3

(18.62)
The ﬁrst equation has the solutions
φ31 = α3 ,
φ32 = α3 + π
(18.63)
and the irrelevant solution c2 = 0 independent of α1 , α2 , α3 which marks
the critical case for Bryan angles.
The second and the third equation are homogeneous linear equations for
c1 and s1 . Nontrivial solutions exist if the determinant of the coeﬃcients is
zero. This condition is
c2[c2(C1S2 −S1C2s3c3) −s2(C1C2c3 + S1S2s3)] = 0 .
(18.64)
As before, the solution c2 = 0 is of no interest. The remaining term yields
tan φ2 = s2
c2
= C1S2 −S1C2s3c3
C1C2c3 + S1S2s3

(18.65)
The third Eq.(18.62) yields
tan φ1 = s1
c1
= S2c2 −C2c3s2
C2s3

(18.66)

18.4 Spherical Parallel Robot
661
For each of the two solutions φ3 (18.65) determines two solutions φ2 also
diﬀering by π , and for each of these two solutions (18.66) determines two
solutions φ1 also diﬀering by π . Hence there are altogether eight sets of
solutions φ1 , φ2 , φ3 . The associated sines and cosines are substituted into
the matrix (18.61). It turns out that the four matrices associated with φ32 are
identical with those associated with φ31 . Hence there are only four diﬀerent
platform positions.
Example: Given the angles α1 = 30◦, α2 = 45◦and α3 = 60◦. With
the solution φ3 = α3 = 60◦Eq.(18.65) yields tan φ2 = 3/4 . Consequently,
c2 = ±4/5 and s2 = ±3/5 . With the plus sign (18.66) yields tan φ1 =

1/3 ,
i.e., φ1 = 30◦and φ1 = 210◦. End of example.
In what follows, the direction cosine matrix A of Eq.(18.61) is expressed
not in terms of Bryan angles, but in the form (1.49) through the angle ϕ and
the direction of a single rotation. The coordinates of the unit vector along
the axis of rotation are denoted a1,2,3 since n1,2,3 have already been used.
With the abbreviations c = cos ϕ and s = sin ϕ the matrix is
A12 =
⎡
⎣

(18.67)
With these expressions for the direction cosines the orthogonality conditions
(18.60) are
Ci[ajak(1−c)+ais]−Si[a2
j(1−c)+c] = 0
(i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 cyclic) . (18.68)
The resolution for c , s and a1,2,3 in terms of given values of Ci , Si (i =
1, 2, 3) is diﬃcult. The only simple case is the special case of identical angles
αi ≡α (Ci ≡C , Si ≡S) . For reasons of symmetry it can be predicted
that a1 = a2 = a3 =

1/3 is a solution. With these simpliﬁcations the
three Eqs.(18.68) are identical. With the abbreviation T = tan α = S/C
they have the form
(1 + 2T) cos ϕ −

3 sin ϕ + T −1 = 0 .
(18.69)
This equation has the irrelevant root ϕ = 240◦independent of T and the
relevant root

2(1 + T + T 2) ,
sin ϕ =

(18.70)
Final remark: The realization of a spherical joint 0 of the platform by
means of six binary links and nine joints is complicated. It is unnecessarily
complicated if only two degrees of freedom are required as is the case when

662

a platform is used for pointing a light-beam or a camera. In such cases, it
suﬃces to mount the platform on a Hooke’s joint.

Dynamics of Mechanisms
For numerical investigations into the dynamics of mechanisms nonlinear dif-
ferential equations must be formulated. The formulation given in this chapter
allows writing a general-purpose software tool applicable to arbitrary mecha-
nisms. The change from one mechanism to another is accomplished by chang-
ing readily available input data. More information see in Wittenburg [4].
19.1 Conservative Single-Degree-of-Freedom
Mechanisms
Subject of this introductory section is the following rather special yet fre-
quently arising problem of dynamics. Imagine an arbitrary single-degree-of-
freedom mechanism with an input shaft and an output shaft. Both shafts are
rotating about frame-ﬁxed axes. Simple examples: Hooke’s joint, the planar
four-bar, the spherical four-bar and the Bennett mechanism. The transmis-
sion ratio of a single-degree-of-freedom mechanism is the ratio i =
˙ϕ1/ ˙ϕ2
(input angular velocity / output angular velocity). For the four illustrative ex-
amples the transmission ratio is known as function of the input angle ϕ1 . For
Hooke’s joint the function is (see (13.7)) i(ϕ1) = (1 −sin2 α cos2 ϕ1)/ cos α .
For the planar four-bar the function is given in (17.35), and for the Bennett
mechanism it is given in (6.16).
In what follows, only those mechanisms are considered which satisfy the
condition i(ϕ1) ̸= 0 . In words: If
˙ϕ2 ̸= 0 , then
˙ϕ1 ̸= 0 independent of
ϕ1 . Imagine that in a single-degree-of-freedom mechanism with a known
function i(ϕ1) ̸= 0 a rotor with moment of inertia J1 is mounted on the
input shaft and that another rotor with moment of inertia J2 is mounted
on the output shaft. Compared with these rotors the masses and moments
of inertia of both shafts and of the coupling mechanism are assumed to be
negligible. Furthermore, it is assumed that no external torques are applied to

the shafts and that no springs and dampers are present in the entire system.
Under these conditions the mechanism is idling with time-varying angular
velocities
˙ϕ1 and
˙ϕ2 . The law of conservation of kinetic energy requires
that
J1 ˙ϕ2
1 + J2 ˙ϕ2
2 ≡2T = const . The constant is given by the initial
condition on ˙ϕ1 . The solution for ˙ϕ1 is
˙ϕ1 =

2T/[J1 + J2/i2(ϕ1)] . With
the dimensionless parameter
λ2 = J2/J1
and with the constant angular
velocity ω0 deﬁned through the equation 2T = (J1 + J2)ω2
0 the solution is
˙ϕ1 = ω0

1 + λ2
1 + λ2/i2(ϕ1) .
(19.1)
The graph of this function in a ϕ1 , ˙ϕ1-diagram is called phase curve of the
motion. Except for the special case i(ϕ1) = const which is typical for gear
trains the angular velocity ˙ϕ1 is not constant.
19.2 The General Problem of Dynamics
Subject of investigation for the rest of this chapter are joint-connected spa-
tial mechanisms without dry friction in the joints. The system structure is
arbitrary (serial chain, tree structure, single-loop or multiloop systems). Holo-
nomic joints of arbitrary nature are taken into consideration. Most systems
are joint-connected to a frame which is ﬁxed in inertial space. In this chapter
the more general case is considered that the system is joint-connected to a
carrier body labeled body 0 which is moving relative to inertial space accord-
ing to prescribed functions of time. Since this motion is prescribed, neither the
center of mass nor the mass nor moments of inertia of body 0 are of concern.
The body is represented by a moving basis e0 . The prescribed functions of
time for body 0 are the position vector r0(t) , the velocity ˙r0(t) and the
acceleration ¨r0(t) of the origin of basis e0 relative to an inertial basis e ,
the direction cosine matrix A0(t) deﬁned by the equation e = A0e0 , the
angular velocity ω0(t) and the angular acceleration ˙ω0(t) relative to basis
e . Since the motion of e0 is prescribed, virtual displacements and virtual
changes of velocity are zero. In the special case that body 0 is at rest the
matrix A0(t) is the unit matrix and the other ﬁve vectorial quantities are
identically zero. This means that e0 permanently coincides with e .
The general system under consideration is subject to arbitrary external
forces and torques as well as to arbitrary internal forces and torques caused
by springs, dampers or actuators (active elements) connecting bodies of the
system. Let F ≥1 (arbitrary) be the total degree of freedom so that the
position of the system in basis e is speciﬁed by F independent variables
(generalized coordinates). Let
q = [q1 . . . qF ]T
be the column matrix of
suitably chosen variables. At this point it is unnecessary to specify whether

the variables are joint variables or variables specifying positions of bodies
relative to basis e . Large motions of the system are governed by F nonlinear
diﬀerential equations for the chosen variables q . The goal of this chapter is
to write these equations in the standard matrix form
A ¨q = B .
(19.2)
Because of the nonlinearity of the system the matrix A depends on the
variables q . It will be shown that A is symmetric and positive deﬁnite.
The column matrix B depends on q , on ˙q and, because of the prescribed
motion of body 0 , explicitly on time t . Explicit expressions for A and B
are derived from the principle of virtual power which is the subject of the
following section.
There are systems which are moving without kinematical constraints to
inertial space. Typical examples are freely falling systems and systems orbit-
ing Earth. The motion of the composite system center of mass C is governed
by Newton’s law
M¨rC = Fres
(total system mass M , resultant external
force Fres ). This vector equation – equivalent to three scalar equations –
can be used for reducing the F scalar Eqs.(19.2) to a smaller set of F −3
equations. How to do this is shown in Sect. 19.4.1 .
19.3 Principle of Virtual Power
The principle of virtual power is written in the Lagrangian form
n

i=1
3
mi
δ˙r · (¨r dm −dF) = 0 .
(19.3)
The integral is taken over the mass mi of body i , and the sum is taken over
all bodies i = 1, . . . , n . The vector r denotes the radius vector of a mass
element dm of body i in the inertial basis e , ¨r its absolute acceleration
and δ˙r a virtual change of its velocity. Body 0 does not contribute to the
sum because of δ˙r = 0 . The force dF is the total force applied to dm . It
may be the inﬁnitesimal weight g dm of dm . It may also be a ﬁnite force
applied to dm . Constraint forces caused by ideal kinematical constraints in
joints do not contribute to virtual power because for every pair of constraint
forces F1 = +F and F2 = −F (actio = reactio) the term δ˙r1 ·F1 +δ˙r2 ·F2
is equal to zero.
First, the contribution of a single rigid body i to the sum in (19.3) is
formulated. Let ri be the radius vector of the body center of mass Ci in
e and let, furthermore, ϱ be the body-ﬁxed vector from Ci to the mass
element dm (see Fig. 19.1). These deﬁnitions establish the three kinematics
equations below. The last equation expresses the fact that Ci is the body

The force Fi is the resultant applied force on body i . Its line of action passes
through the body center of mass Ci . The last integral is the resultant applied
torque Mi about the center of mass. The ﬁrst integral is
3

ϱ × ¨ϱ dm = d

ϱ × ˙ϱ dm .
(19.6)
The term ˙ϱ dm under the integral on the right-hand side is the momentum
of the mass element dm . The integral is the moment of momentum, also
called angular momentum of the entire body about the body center of mass.
The formula ˙ϱ = ωi × ϱ yields ϱ × ˙ϱ = ϱ × (ωi × ϱ) = (ϱ2I −ϱϱ) · ωi and
3

ϱ × ˙ϱ dm =

(19.7)
This equation deﬁnes the central inertia tensor Ji of the body:
Ji =
3
mi
(ϱ2I −ϱϱ) dm .
(19.8)

19.3 Principle of Virtual Power
667
The integral in (19.6) and (19.5) is the absolute time derivative of Ji · ωi .
This is (see (9.9)) Ji · ˙ωi + ωi × Ji · ωi . Thus, Eq.(19.3) for the entire system
ﬁnally becomes

i=1

δ˙ri · (mi¨ri −Fi) + δωi · (Ji · ˙ωi + ωi × Ji · ωi −Mi)

(19.9)
The quantities δ˙ri , δωi , ¨ri and
˙ωi appear in linear form. For this reason
the equation is written in the matrix form
δ˙rT · (m ¨r −F) + δωT · (J · ˙ω −M∗) = 0 .
(19.10)
Here, r , F , ω and M∗are column matrices of n vectors each, for exam-
ple, r = [r1 . . . rn]T . The column matrix M∗is introduced for abbreviation.
Its elements are the vectors
M∗
i = Mi −ωi × Ji · ωi
(i = 1, . . . , n) .
(19.11)
Finally, m and J are diagonal (n × n)-matrices with masses m1, . . . , mn
and inertia tensors J1, . . . , Jn , respectively, along the diagonal.
Following (19.2) the need for a special investigation into systems without
kinematical constraints to inertial space was pointed out. In this investigation
the composite system center of mass C plays an important role. Let rC be
the radius vector of C in the inertial basis e , and let Ri be the vector
pointing from the composite system center of mass C to the body i center
of mass. From these deﬁnitions it follows that
ri = rC+Ri ,
¨ri = ¨rC+ ¨Ri
(i = 1, . . . , n) ,
n

i=1
Rimi = 0 . (19.12)
The expressions for ri and ¨ri are substituted into (19.9). Multiplying out
and using the last Eq.(19.12) results in the equation ( M is the total system
mass M = m1 + . . . + mn )

The absence of constraints to inertial space has the consequence that δ˙rC is
independent. Hence the factor behind is zero. This is Newton’s law for the
composite system center of mass:

The rest of the equation is written in the matrix form

(19.15)
The formal diﬀerence between this equation and Eq.(19.10) for arbitrary
systems is that R replaces r . Between R and r exists a simple relationship.
By deﬁnition, the radius vector of the composite system center of mass is

(19.18)
Then the matrix form of all n Eqs.(19.17) is
R = μT r .
(19.19)
The matrix μ has remarkable properties. It satisﬁes the three equations
μT 1 = 0 ,
μ μ = μ ,
μ m = m μT = μ m μT .
(19.20)
The ﬁrst equation states that the sum of all rows is a row of zeros which means
that μ is singular. Hence (19.19) cannot be resolved for r . This is obvious
for physical reasons. The positions r of the body centers of mass in inertial
space cannot be determined if only the positions relative to the composite
system center of mass are known. For a proof of the other two equations it
must be shown that (μ μ)ij = μij and that (μ m μT )ij = (μ m)ij = μijmj .

19.4 Equations of Motion
The formulation of equations of motion is simplest for systems with tree
structure. This is the subject of Sect. 19.4.1 . In Sect. 19.4.3 the procedure
for systems with closed kinematic chains is explained.
19.4.1 Systems with Tree Structure
In Sect. 11.2.2 the kinematics analysis of tree-structured systems in terms of
joint variables resulted in Eqs.(11.20) and (11.21):
ω = ω0(t)1 + a1 ˙q ,
˙ω = ˙ω0(t)1 + a1¨q + b1 ,
˙r = ˙r0(t)1 −ω0(t) × T T (CT
0 + CT 1 ) + a2 ˙q ,
¨r = ¨r0(t)1 −˙ω0(t) × T T (CT

a1 = −T T pT ,
a2 = T T (CT × a1 −kT ) ,
b1 = −T T (w + f) ,
b2 = T T [ CT × b1 −(s + h)] .

(19.23)
For the deﬁnitions of the various matrices see the equations prior to (11.20).
For abbreviation the acceleration terms ˙ω and ¨r are written in the forms
˙ω = a1¨q + b∗

¨r = a2¨q + b∗

with

1 = b1+ ˙ω0(t)1 ,
b∗
2 = b2+¨r0(t)1−˙ω0(t)×T T (CT
0 +CT 1 ) . (19.25)
In Sect. 11.2.2 the vector ri was by deﬁnition the position vector of the
unspeciﬁed origin 0i of a basis ei ﬁxed on body i in some unspeciﬁed
common reference basis e . In the present section the origin 0i of ei is the
body i center of mass, and the common reference basis e is ﬁxed in inertial
space. With these deﬁnitions, ¨r and ˙ω are the quantities required for (19.10).
The virtual velocity changes are
δω = a1 δ ˙q ,
δ˙r = a2 δ˙q .

(19.26)
Substitution of (19.24) and (19.26) into (19.10) results in the equation

The elements of δ ˙q are independent. From this it follows that the factor
behind equals zero. This yields the desired equations of motion for joint
variables:
A ¨q = B ,
(19.28)
A = aT
2 ·m a2+aT
1 ·J·a1 ,
B = aT
2 ·(F−m b∗
2)+aT
1 ·(M∗−J·b∗
1) . (19.29)
As predicted, the inertia matrix A is symmetric. It is also positive deﬁnite.
The proof is given for a system in which body 0 is inertial space. Twice the
total kinetic energy T of such a system is
2T =
n

(mi˙r2

(19.30)
Thus, the matrix A is the coeﬃcient matrix of the total kinetic energy. Since
the kinetic energy is positive deﬁnite, also the matrix A is.
Next, tree-structured systems without kinematical constraints to inertial
space are considered. In this case, body 0 is inertial space. Equations of
motion are formulated from Eqs.(19.19) and (19.15). Equations (19.24) and
(19.26) yield
˙ω = a1¨q + b∗
1 ,
¨R = μT (a2¨q + b∗
2) ,
δω = a1 δ ˙q ,
δ ˙R = μT a2 δ˙q .

During numerical evaluations the matrices a1 , b∗
1 , a2 , b∗
2 are not calcu-
lated from (19.23) and (19.25), but directly from (19.24) in combination with
the recursive Eqs.(11.11). The formulation (19.23) is useful for nonnumeri-
cal investigations. The expressions for a2 and b2 show that in (19.29) and
(19.34) the products (C T)T
and (C T μ)T
play a prominent role. If all
joints of a system are spherical joints, the elements of these matrices can be

interpreted as body-ﬁxed vectors. In terms of these vectors certain problems
of analytical mechanics can be formulated very elegantly (see Wittenburg
[4]).
19.4.2 Constraint Forces and Torques in Joints
In a joint with kinematical constraints the coupled bodies are in contact either
at individual points or along certain lines or in a certain surface. Constraint
forces are, therefore, distributed forces. Since the bodies are assumed rigid,
it is impossible to determine the distribution of constraint forces. Only an
equivalent force system can be determined which consists of a single force
and a single torque. The torque depends upon the choice of the point at
which the single force is thought to be acting. It is natural to choose for each
joint i the articulation point located on body i . Let Xi and Yi be the
constraint force and the constraint torque, respectively, thus deﬁned for joint
i . More precisely, +Xi and +Yi are acting on body b(i) , and −Xi and
−Yi are acting on body i (see Fig. 11.2). In order to express whether a given
constraint force is applied to a given body with positive or with negative sign
or not at all numbers Sji are deﬁned as follows:
Sji =
⎧
⎨
⎩
−1
(j=i)
+1
(j=b(i))
0
(else)
(j, i = 1, . . . , n) .
(19.35)
The ﬁrst index refers to a body and the second to a joint. With this deﬁnition
the resultant of all constraint forces and the resultant of all constraint torques
applied to body j (arbitrary) are the sums (summation over all joints)

By assumption, there are no dry friction forces. If, as before, Fj and Mj
denote the external resultant force and the external resultant torque, respec-
tively, Newton’s and Euler’s equations for the isolated body j have the forms

The vector Sjicji is the vector Cji known from (11.17). With this abbre-
viation and with the (n × n)-matrix S with elements Sji the two sets of

672
19 Dynamics of Mechanisms
equations are written as follows:
m ¨r = F + S X ,
J · ˙ω = M∗+ C × X + S Y .
(19.38)
The various quantities in these equations are known from previous equations
(see (19.29)). Further progress relies on
Theorem 19.1. The matrix S is the inverse of T .
Proof: From the deﬁnition in (19.35) it follows that the product T S has the
elements
(T S)ji =
n

k=1
TjkSki = TjiSii+Tjb(i)Sb(i)i = −Tji+Tjb(i)
(j, i = 1, . . . , n) .
(19.39)
Two cases have to be distinguished. In the case j = i , (11.12) yields Tii = −1
and Tib(i) = 0 whence follows (T S)ii = 1 . In the case j ̸= i , joint j satisﬁes
one of the following two conditions. a) Joint j is on the direct path between
bodies 0 and i and also on the direct path between bodies 0 and b(i) . b)
Joint j is neither on the direct path between bodies 0 and i nor on the direct
path between bodies 0 and b(i) . If the former is true, then Tji = Tjb(i) = −1
and if the latter is true, then Tji = Tjb(i) = 0 . In either case, (T S)ji = 0 .
End of proof1.
With this theorem Eqs.(19.38) can be solved explicitly for the constraint
forces and constraint torques. Premultiplication by T yields
X = T(m ¨r −F) ,
Y = T(J · ˙ω −M∗−C × X) .
(19.40)
The expression for X is substituted into the equation for Y . The numerical
evaluation of these equations is done in parallel with the numerical integration
of the equations of motion.
19.4.3 Systems with Closed Kinematical Chains
From Chap. 4 it is known that the joint variables of a closed kinematical chain
are subject to kinematical constraints. As illustrative example the trihedral
Bricard mechanism shown in Fig. 4.6 is used. It is a simple closed chain with
six joints. For the kinematics analysis see Eqs.(4.12) – (4.25). The analysis
started with the removal of joint 6 thus creating a serial chain with ﬁve
1 In graph theory the matrices T and S are referred to as path matrix and incidence
matrix, respectively. The matrix C represents a weighted incidence matrix. Whereas the
path matrix is deﬁned for tree-structured systems only, the deﬁnition of incidence matrix
can be generalized to include multiloop systems. Details see in Wittenburg [3, 4]

19.4 Equations of Motion

joint variables ϕ1, . . . , ϕ5 . Closure of the removed sixth joint resulted in four
independent constraint Eqs.(4.20) and (4.22):
ϕ3 = ϕ1 ,
ϕ5 = ϕ1 ,
ϕ4 = ϕ2 ,
sin ϕ2 =
sin ϕ1
1 −sin ϕ1
.
(19.41)
The total degree of freedom is F = 1 . Hence the mechanism is governed by
a single diﬀerential equation for a single independent variable. Which of the
variables is chosen as independent, is a matter of taste. The equations suggest
to choose ϕ1 . A single diﬀerential equation for ϕ1 is developed as follows.
First, equations of motion are formulated for the system without joint 6 . This
system is a particularly simple tree-structured system with regularly labeled
bodies 0, . . . , 5 and joints i = 1, . . . , 5 . Equations of motion for the variables
q = [ϕ1 ϕ2 ϕ3 ϕ4 ϕ5]T have the form (19.28):
A ¨q = B ,
(19.42)
A = aT
2 ·m a2+aT
1 ·J·a1 ,
B = aT
2 ·(F−m b∗
2)+aT
1 ·(M∗−J·b∗
1) . (19.43)
In the present case, the equations are particularly simple since body 0 is at
rest and since all joints are revolute joints. For what follows, not Eq.(19.28),
but the preceding Eq.(19.27) is used:
δ ˙qT (A¨q −B) = 0 .
(19.44)
The constraint Eqs.(19.41) have the eﬀect that the elements of δ ˙q are not
independent. The elements of ¨q are not independent, either. The necessary
relationships are obtained by diﬀerentiating the constraint equations with
respect to time. The ﬁrst and the second time derivatives are known from
(4.24) and (4.25):

The expressions for δ ˙q and for ¨q are substituted into (19.44). This results
in the equation
δ ˙q1GT [A(G ¨q1 + H) −B] = 0 .
(19.49)
Since δ ˙q1 is independent, the factor behind is zero. This is the desired single
diﬀerential equation for the independent variable q1 :
(GT A G) ¨q1 = GT (B −A H) .
(19.50)
The matrices A and B depend explicitly on q1, . . . , q5 and ˙q1, . . . , ˙q5 . The
dependent quantities q2, . . . , q5 and ˙q2, . . . , ˙q5 are expressed in terms of q1
and ˙q1 with the help of (19.41) and (19.45).
The method just described for the trihedral Bricard mechanism is applica-
ble to arbitrary multiloop systems. A multiloop system is converted into a sys-
tem with tree structure by deleting suitably chosen joints. Optimal strategies
are described in M¨oller [1]. The resulting tree-structured system has a certain
degree of freedom F and an equal number of joint variables q = [q1 . . . qF ]T .
For this system Eq.(19.44) is established. Restoration of the deleted joints re-
sults in a set of constraint equations (loop-closure conditions) for the variables
q . Let ν be the total number of independent constraint equations. Then the
total degree of freedom of the multiloop system is F −ν . An equal number
of equations of motion has to be formulated. In general, constraint equations
are not available in explicit form like Eqs.(19.41), but in the implicit form
fi(q1, . . . , qF ) = 0
(i = 1, . . . , ν) .
(19.51)
Examples of such loop-closure conditions for a single loop are known from
Chap. 5 . F −ν of the variables are independent, and the remaining ν vari-
ables are dependent. Which of the variables are considered as independent is
a matter of choice. Often, this choice is dictated by the equations. As was the
case with the Bricard mechanism, the constraint equations are diﬀerentiated
twice with respect to time. This results in the equations

set of equations is solved for these ν quantities. Let q∗be the column matrix

combined with identities for the independent quantities result in equations
of the forms

δ ˙q ∗T GT [A(G ¨q ∗+ H) −B] = 0 .
(19.54)
By deﬁnition, the elements of δ ˙q ∗are independent. This yields the desired
F −ν equations of motion for the independent variables:
(GT A G) ¨q ∗= GT (B −A H) .
(19.55)
The (F −ν) × (F −ν)-coeﬃcient matrix is symmetric. The matrices G and
A depend explicitly on all F variables q1, . . . , qF . The matrices B and H
depend on q1, . . . , qF and, in addition, on ˙q1, . . . , ˙qF . For the dependent ve-
locities explicit expressions are available. Not so for the dependent variables.
This means that in the course of numerical integration for every evaluation of
the matrices the nonlinear constraint equations (19.51) must be solved for the
dependent variables. For two reasons this is not a very time-consuming task.
First, the Jacobian G is available so that a Newton-Raphson method can be
applied. Second, the previous solution for time t is a good approximation for
the actual solution at time t + Δt . It is more diﬃcult to determine initial
values satisfying the constraint equations.
