Introduction
W
hen you hear the words “Set ’em up, Joe,” you better
have at least a basic knowledge of over 200 of the most
called-for cocktails in your head. I say cocktails because a cock-
tail is, according to Webster, “any of various alcoholic drinks
made of a distilled liquor mixed with a wine, fruit juice, etc.,
and usually iced.”
In this book, I show you how to prepare and serve cocktails.
You’ll find all the recipes you need to mix cocktails for your
guests. I show you the correct equipment to use and help you
set up for parties. What’s more, I also provide an excellent
background on liquors, wine, and beer.
About This Book
This book is a reference that you can read now and refer to
many years from now. Don’t feel at all compelled to read the
thing from cover to cover. I would guess that you’ll mostly use
this book for recipes, and the best place to find them is the A
to Z recipe section (Chapter 17), which is by far the largest
section of the book. Drinks are also listed by their ingredients
in the index.
This book has a complete table of contents and another index
of topics. Feel free to use both to find whatever information
you need.
Foolish Assumptions
You don’t need any special knowledge of liquor or mixology to
understand this book. Having an interest in creating crowd-
pleasing cocktails is definitely a plus, and having the patience
to get recipes just right doesn’t hurt either. Good bartenders
are always trying new things in the interest of serving the
tastiest beverages.

A bartender cannot be made overnight, though, and a head
full of recipes and facts will get you only so far. You need expe-
rience, and you must respect and like people. If you aren’t a
people person, all the great information in this book won’t
make you a bartender.
As a bartender for over 20 years, I always enjoyed the atmos-
phere and people in bars and restaurants. They are there to
relax and have fun. My job was to serve and be a part of the
entertainment, to make the guests feel at home and relaxed,
never to be overbearing or intruding. So a good attitude and a
lot of experience are key. From here on in, I’m going to assume
that you have the former and are working on the latter. You’re
a good person, especially because you bought this book.
How This Book Is Organized
Like all For Dummies books, this book is organized into parts
and chapters. Each chapter is self-contained so that you don’t
have to read them in order. Feel free to skip around. Here’s
what’s in each of the book’s four parts:
Part I: The Basics
In this part, I describe the bartending tools and glasses you
need. I also cover some simple bartending techniques that
will help you look like a pro. I tell you what you need to buy to
prepare for a party, and I conclude this part with all kinds of
interesting alcohol- and bartending-related tables and charts.
Part II: Short Shots from American
Whiskey to Wine
I devote a chapter to each of the major kinds of liquor. I tell
you where they come from, how they’re made, and how to
store and serve them. If you wonder what gin is made of, see
Chapter 10. Why does Scotch whisky have that smoky flavor?
Check out Chapter 13.
Bartending For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
2

Part III: The Recipes
The first chapter in this part, Chapter 17, contains over a thou-
sand cocktail recipes listed in alphabetical order by name. This
chapter contains classic cocktails from years past plus the
hot cocktails of today and the future. Chapter 18 presents a
few dozen trendy and interesting “martinis,” and if that weren’t
enough, the remaining chapters in this part show you how to
make punches and nonalcoholic drinks.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book ends with lists of ten-plus items, and
this book is no exception. Chapter 21 contains roughly ten
cures for hiccups and hangovers. Chapter 22 lists many more
than ten bartending-related Web sites and other resources.
The Indexes
This book has two indexes: an index of cocktails by their main
ingredient and an index of topics. The cocktail index is simply
another way of finding a drink in this book if you don’t know
its name. The topics index can help you find information in
chapters other than the ones in Part III.
Icons Used in This Book
Scattered throughout the book are little pictures, which my
publisher calls icons, in the margins next to certain blocks of
text. Here’s what they mean:
This icon lets you know that I’m presenting a neat hint or trick
that can make your life easier.
This icon flags information that will keep you out of trouble.
This icon indicates that I’m about to tell a story or provide a
little interesting background information.
Introduction
3

I use this symbol in Part III to indicate classic drinks that
every bartender should know.
Where to Go from Here
Look up some recipes. Read about Irish whiskey. Check out
one of my hangover cures. This book was designed so that
you can jump around.
When it comes to the recipes, I do have this bit of advice: I rec-
ommend that you use only the best ingredients when making
cocktails. They represent your opinion of your guests, and you
want them to have the best. In some drinks, you can get by
with the cheap stuff, but in this day and age, people are drink-
ing less and demanding higher quality. You can’t go wrong
when you serve the good stuff, so why serve anything else?
That said, get reading and start pouring.

Part I
The Basics

In this part . . .
F
irst, I show you what tools and glassware you need to
be a successful bartender. I then cover some basic
bartending techniques. Next, I tell you what you need to
buy to prepare for a party, and I conclude this part with all
kinds of interesting alcohol- and bartending-related tables
and charts.

Chapter 1
Just for Openers: The Right
Tools and Glasses
In This Chapter
 All the bartending tools that you’ll ever need
 More glasses than you can shake a drink at
T
o bartend, you need a few essentials: You need to have
good people skills and to know about the products that
you’re pouring; cocktail recipes and proper equipment are
also necessary. This chapter covers equipment. (Part II can
help you with product knowledge, and Part III gives you the
recipes. As for people skills, you’re on your own.)
The Basic Tools
The most important assets for any profession are the right
tools. You need basic bar tools to mix, serve, and store your
drinks. Whether you’re stocking a home bar or working as a
professional, your basic tools are a wine opener, cocktail
shaker, measuring glass, and strainer.
Wine opener
The best wine opener is a waiter’s wine opener (shown in
Figure 1-1). It has a sharp blade, a corkscrew (also known as
a worm), and a bottle opener. This wine opener can be found
in most liquor stores or bar supply houses.

Another nifty wine opener is called a Rabbit. It’s also shown in
Figure 1-1.
Figure 1-1: A waiter’s wine opener and a Rabbit.
Cocktail shaker
Figure 1-2 shows two types of shakers. The Boston shaker is
the one that most professional bartenders use. It consists of a
mixing glass and a stainless steel core that overlaps the glass.
The Standard shaker usually consists of two or more stainless
steel or glass parts and can be found in department stores or
antiques stores. Many of these shakers come in different
shapes and designs.
Strainer
A couple of different types of strainers are available, but
the most popular is the Hawthorn, shown in Figure 1-3.
The Hawthorn is a flat, spoon-shaped utensil with a spring
coil around its head. You can use it on top of a steel shaker
or a bar glass to strain cocktails.

Other tools
Many of the following tools are shown in Figure 1-4:
 Bar spoon: A long spoon for stirring cocktails.
 Blender: Many types of commercial or home blenders
with various speeds are available. When making a drink,
always put liquid in the blender before switching it on.
This will save your blade. Some blenders (but not all) can
be used to make crushed ice. Check with the manufac-
turer or buy an ice crusher.
 Coasters or bar napkins: Coasters prevent rings from
developing on your bar and other tables. Napkins also
help your guests hold their drinks.
 Ice bucket: Pick one that’s large enough to hold at least
three trays of ice.
 Ice scoop or tongs: A must for every bar. Never use your
hands to scoop ice.
 Jigger or measuring glass: A small glass or metal meas-
uring container that usually has a 1⁄2 oz. measurer on one
side and a 2 oz. measurer on the other.
 Knife and cutting board: You need a small, sharp paring
knife to cut fruit.
 Large water pitcher: Someone always wants water.
 Muddler: A small wooden bat or pestle used to crush
fruit or herbs.
 Pourer: This device gives greater control to your pour-
ing. A variety of different types is available, including
some with a lidded spout, which prevents insects and
undesirables from entering the pourer.
 Stirrers and straws: Used for stirring and sipping drinks.
 Large cups or bowls: Used to hold garnishes, such as
cherries, olives, onions, and so on.

Glassware
People generally expect certain drinks to be served in certain
kinds of glasses. The problem is that there are more standard
bar glasses than most people (and many bars) care to pur-
chase. In any event, Figure 1-5 shows most of the glasses that
you’re ever likely to use to serve drinks.

Chapter 1: Just for Openers: The Right Tools and Glasses 11

I have a few things to say about some of the glasses shown in
Figure 1-5:
 Shot glass: You can also use the shot glass as a measur-
ing tool. It’s a must for every bar.
 Cocktail or martini glass: Perfect for martinis, Manhattans,
stingers, and many other classic drinks, this glass is avail-
able in 3 to 6 oz. sizes. 
 White wine glass: This glass is available in 5 to 10 oz.
sizes. I advise you to stick with the smaller wine glass.
 Red wine glass: This glass is also available in 5 to 10 oz.
sizes. Note that the bowl is wider than the bowl of a
white wine glass, allowing the wine to breathe.
 Champagne glass: The bowl is tapered to prevent bub-
bles from escaping.
 Rocks glass: Also known as an old-fashioned glass, sizes
vary from 5 to 10 oz. Use the 5 or 6 oz. variety and add
plenty of ice.
 Highball and Collins glasses: These glasses are the most
versatile. Sizes range from 8 to 12 oz.
 Cordial glass: In addition to cordials, you can also use
this glass to serve straight-up drinks.
 Brandy or cognac snifter: Available in a wide range of
sizes, the short stemmed, large bowl should be cupped
in hand to warm the brandy or cognac.
 Stemless glasses: These glasses have become popular in
recent years, probably because they look elegant even if
they aren’t as practical as the stemmed versions.
If you’re planning on creating a bar at home or serving cock-
tails at a party, keep your glass selection small. You can sim-
plify by using two types of glasses: a white wine glass and a
red wine glass. Both are shown in Figure 1-5. These two
glasses can be used for every type of cocktail (including
shots, even though I said that a shot glass is essential for
every bar) plus beer and wine. Also, if you use these two glass
shapes, cleaning and storing your glasses is less complicated.

M
aking good cocktails takes more effort than just pour-
ing ingredients into a glass. This chapter shows you
how to pull off some of the little touches that make both you
and your drinks look better, with the ultimate result of hap-
pier guests.
Cutting Fruit
Many drinks require fruit garnishes. Your guests expect the
garnish, so you can’t forgo it, and you have to do it well.
Presentation counts big time. You may mix the best drinks on
the planet, but if they don’t look good when you serve them,
no one’s going to want to drink them.
I’ve stepped away from the pulpit now. The next few diagrams
and steps show you how to cut the most common garnishes.
Lemon twists
Figure 2-1 illustrates the procedure for cutting lemon twists.
1. Cut off both ends of the lemon.

2. Insert a sharp knife or spoon between the rind and
meat of the lemon and carefully separate them.
3. Cut the rind into strips.
The outside of the lemon is where the flavor lies. When adding
a lemon twist to a drink, slowly rim the edge of the glass with
the outside of the lemon twist and then twist a drop into the
cocktail.
Figure 2-1: Cutting lemon twists.
Orange slices
The following steps for cutting orange slices are shown in
Figure 2-2.
1. With the ends of the orange removed, cut the orange
in half.
2. Cut each half in half again (lengthwise).
3. Cut the orange quarters into wedges.
Lime slices
The next few steps and Figure 2-3 show you how to cut lime
slices.
1. Cut off both ends of the lime.
2. Slice the lime in half.
3. Lay each half down and cut it into half-moon slices.

Lemon and lime wedges
Figure 2-4 illustrates the following steps for cutting wedges.
1. Slice the lemon or lime in half the long way.
2. Lay the cut halves down and halve them again.
3. Cut wedges from the lemon or lime quarters.

Don’t forget the Maraschino cherries
All kinds of drinks are garnished with Maraschino cherries, including the kid-
friendly Shirley Temple and the more adult Manhattan. You can find
Maraschino cherries in small jars at any food store, and the best thing about
them is that you don’t have to cut them before serving.

Pineapple wedges
Figure 2-5 and the following steps show you how to cut
pineapple wedges.
1. Cut off the top and bottom of the pineapple.
2. From top to bottom, cut the pineapple in half.
3. Lay the half pineapple down and cut it in half again.
4. Remove the core section of the pineapple quarters.
5. Cut wedges.

Shaking a Drink
The main reasons for shaking drinks are to chill a cocktail,
mix ingredients, or put a head on some cocktails.
As a general rule, you should shake all cloudy drinks (includ-
ing cream drinks and sours), and you should stir all clear
drinks. Never shake a cocktail that has carbonated water or
soda. For some drinks, such as the stinger or martini, ask
your guests whether they prefer them shaken or stirred.
To shake a cocktail in a Boston shaker, follow these steps:
1. Put some ice cubes (if called for in the recipe) in the
glass container.
2. Add the cocktail ingredients.
3. Place the metal container over the glass container.
4. Hold the metal and glass containers together with
both hands and shake with an up and down motion.
Make sure that you always point the shaker away from your
guests. This way you avoid spilling anything on them if the
shaker isn’t properly sealed.

Chapter 2: Methods to the Madness 19

The two pieces of the shaker may stick together after you
shake a drink. Never bang the shaker against the bar or any
other object; instead, gently tap it three or four times at the
point where the glass and metal containers come in contact.
When pouring or straining the cocktail, always pour from the
glass container.
Opening Wine and Champagne
Bottles
Opening bottles doesn’t take much skill, just a little practice.
It’s a no-brainer task, so if you don’t get it right, you’ll look like
a fool.
Wine bottles
To open a wine bottle, you want to use a waiter’s opener,
which I show you in Chapter 1. Then go through these num-
bered steps:
1. Using the blade on the opener, cut the lead foil or cap-
sule at the middle of the bulge near the bottle neck.
2. Remove the foil and wipe the bottle top with a cloth to
remove any mold or foreign particles.
3. Line up the screw or worm directly over the bottle,
and with gentle downward pressure, screw the worm
clockwise into the cork.
Don’t break the end of the cork, and screw in just
enough to extract the cork.
4. Attach the lever of the opener to the lip on top of the
bottle, and while holding the bottle firmly, slowly lift
the cork straight up.
5. Wipe the neck of the bottle.
6. Present the cork to your guest and pour one ounce of
wine into his or her glass.
Part I: The Basics 
20

If the wine is to your guest’s satisfaction, pour more. Keep
your towel handy to wipe the neck of the bottle as you pour
the wine for other guests.
Champagne and sparkling 
wine bottles
You don’t use a corkscrew when opening sparkling wine 
bottles.
1. Remove the wine hood and foil capsule.
2. Hold the bottle at an angle and point it away from you
and anyone else (and anything valuable).
3. While holding the cork in one hand, twist the bottle
with the other hand and gently remove the cork.
Remember, twist the bottle, not the cork.
4. Just before the cork is about to pop, place a bar towel
over the cork and bottle and loosen it the rest of the
way. (The towel will catch the cork and prevent the
cork from becoming a UFO.)
Keep another towel handy in case the bottle bubbles over
after you remove the cork. To avoid the bubbling, don’t shake
the bottle before opening.
Making Simple Syrup
Several cocktail recipes call for simple syrup. To make it, dis-
solve one part sugar in one part boiling water and reduce the
mixture over low heat, stirring frequently, until it thickens. It
shouldn’t take more than a couple minutes.

Chapter 3
Setting Up Your Home Bar
In This Chapter
 Aiming to please your guests
 Purchasing the right products
 Knowing when you have enough
W
hen doing any sort of entertaining, one of the biggest
hassles is trying to figure how to set up your bar and
how much liquor you need to buy. If you throw parties all the
time or if you’re trying to plan just one big party, this chapter
can help.
Some Logistical Advice
Before I get into what to buy and how much to buy, I’d like to
provide some tips on how to set up a bar.
Directing traffic flow
Keep the bar as far as possible from your food and snacks.
This prevents large groups of people from staying in one area.
If possible, base a wine and beer bar in one area and a cocktail
bar in another.
Keeping your bar in or near 
the kitchen
Cleaning up spills is much easier in your kitchen. What’s
more, you do less running around when you’re close to the
sink and refrigerator. If you have to set up your bar in another

location, put a small rug or cloth under and behind the bar to
protect the floor or carpet. And no matter where your bar is,
use a strong, steady table to avoid tipping or collapsing.
Serving smartly
Your party will run smoothly and your guests will be happy if
you take the following suggestions to heart:
 Use nothing larger than a shot glass for shots and don’t
serve doubles to your guests. You aren’t doing anyone
any favors by overserving. If a recipe calls for 11⁄2 oz. of
vodka, use just that amount. No mixed drink should
exceed 2 oz. of liquor.
 Use lower proof products if they’re available. (See
Chapter 5 for an explanation of proof.)
 Have punch available for those “light” drinkers.
 Have alcohol-free drinks available, including coffee and tea.
 Use only clean, fresh ice, and fresh fruit.
 If possible, chill glasses and don’t put them out until five
minutes before the party begins.
 When serving hot drinks, make sure that the cups or
glasses have handles.
 Use a scoop, tongs, or a large spoon to serve ice. Never
use your hands.
 If you don’t have bottle pourers, rub wax paper over the
tip of liquor bottles to prevent dripping.
 Close the bar one to one-and-a-half hours before the end
of the party.
 If possible, hire a professional bartender.
What You Need to Buy
When setting up your home bar, always use popular name
brands. These brands aren’t always the most expensive, but
they tend to be the most recognizable.
Part I: The Basics 
24

The basic setup
A basic bar setup for your home and for spur-of-the-moment
entertaining should consist of the following:
 One 750 ml bottle of the apéritif of your choice (Campari,
Dubonnet, Lillet, and so on)
 One 750 ml bottle of sparkling wine or champagne
 Four 750 ml bottles of white domestic wine
 Two 750 ml bottles of red domestic wine
 One 750 ml bottle of dry vermouth
 One 750 ml bottle of sweet vermouth
 One 750 ml bottle of flavored vodka (Stick to one of these
flavors: Orange, lemon, raspberry, or vanilla.)
 One 750 ml bottle of vodka (domestic or imported)
 One 750 ml bottle of gin (domestic or imported)
 One 750 ml bottle of rum
 One 750 ml bottle of Scotch
 One 750 ml bottle of single-malt Scotch
 One 750 ml bottle of whiskey (domestic or imported)
 One 750 ml bottle of bourbon
 One 750 ml bottle of tequila
 One 750 ml bottle of brandy or cognac
 Twelve 12 oz. bottles of beer (domestic or imported)
 Three 750 ml bottles of the cordials of your choice (such
as Irish cream, coffee liqueur or Kahlua, Grand Marnier,
triple sec, Cointreau, Sambuca, white or green crème de
menthe, Galliano, B&B, Frangelico, amaretto, peach
schnapps, and so on)
The approximate cost to set up this bar is between $200 and
$250 U.S. dollars using domestic and local brands. If you’re
going to use premium brands, add 20 to 30 percent.
I recommend that you use mostly premium brands. You don’t
want your guests thinking that you’d serve them anything but
the best.
Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Home Bar 25

A more complete bar
If you plan to serve more than the basics at your bar, add the
following items to the basic bar outlined in the previous sec-
tion, “The basic setup”:
 One 750 ml bottle of Russian or imported vodka

orange, vanilla, or berry)
 One 750 ml bottle of imported gin
 One 750 ml bottle of dark rum
 One 750 ml bottle of coconut-flavored rum
 One 750 ml or 1.5-liter bottle of 12-year-old Scotch
 One 750 ml or 1.5-liter bottle of single-malt Scotch
 One 750 ml bottle of Irish whiskey
 One 750 ml bottle of Canadian whisky
 One 750 ml bottle of Tennessee whiskey
 One 750 ml bottle of gold tequila
 One 750 ml or 1.5-liter bottle of V.S. or V.S.O.P. cognac

 Two 750 ml bottles of additional cordials
 Twelve 12 oz. bottles of imported beer
 Six 12 oz. bottles of light beer
 Six 12 oz. bottles of ale
The added cost of these items is about $300 to $400 U.S. 
dollars.
Part I: The Basics 
26

bar, add the following items:
 Three 750 ml bottles of flavored vodka (such as lemon,
orange, vanilla, or berry)
 One 750 ml bottle of imported or super-premium domestic
vodka
 One 750 ml bottle of 15-year-old single-malt Scotch

 Six 12 oz. bottles of assorted microbrews
 Six cans (sizes vary depending on brand) of an energy
drink (such as Red Bull or Rock Star)
The added cost of the ultimate bar is roughly $350 to $450 U.S.
dollars.

With the exception of beer, Table 3-1 is based on 13⁄4 oz. of
liquor per drink. Cost totals are in U.S. dollars.
The number of products you purchase varies depending on
the age of the crowd. If people between the ages of 21 and 35
dominate a crowd, increase the amount of vodka, rum,
tequila, and beer by one half.
The time of the year should also be a consideration. In the fall
and winter, serve less beer. In the spring and summer, serve
more beer, vodka, gin, and tequila.
Geographical location is also an important consideration
when it comes to selecting your liquor stock for your guests.
Consult a local bartender or liquor clerk to find out what the
most popular products are in your area.
How many supplies should you buy?
Your bar needs more than just liquor. Table 3-2 lists the other
supplies that you want to purchase. Again, the total costs (in
U.S. dollars) are listed in the bottom row.

Add a little color to your rim
A great way to add color and fun to any cocktail is to use colored rim salts
and sugars, such as the ones available from Stirrings. Stirrings offers 20 dif-
ferent flavored sugars to match just about any martini you may be mixing, and
the company offers a margarita rimmer made from mint, cilantro, lime, and
sea salt. Check out www.stirrings.com for more info.

times forget to watch what they drink. Alcohol is a form of
sugar, so it’s high in calories. If you’re counting calories or

Short Shots from
American Whiskey
to Wine

In this part . . .

give you some background for just about every kind of
liquor, including beer and wine. Each chapter tells you
where a speciﬁc product comes from, how it’s made, and
how to store and serve it.

Chapter 5
American and 
Canadian Whisk(e)y
In This Chapter
 Getting to know the grain
 Exploring the varieties
 Keeping your whiskey for a long time
T
his chapter deals with several kinds of whiskey: bourbon,
Tennessee whiskey, rye whiskey, blended whiskey,
Canadian whisky, and wheat and corn whiskies.
How Whiskey Is Made
Whiskey is distilled from grain. The type of grain or grains used
determines the type of whiskey. After the grain is harvested, it’s
inspected and stored. It’s then ground into a meal and cooked
to separate the starch; malt is added, changing the starch to
sugar. This mash is cooled and pumped into fermenters. Yeast
is added to the mash and allowed to ferment, resulting in a 
mixture of grain residue, water, yeast cells, and alcohol. This
mixture is then pumped into a still where heat vaporizes the
alcohol. The alcohol vapors are caught, cooled, condensed, and
drawn off. This new high-proof spirit is stored in large holding
tanks. Water is added to lower the proof, and the whiskey is
drawn into barrels. The barrels of whiskey are stored in a rack
house for aging. After aging, the barrels of whiskey are drained
into the tanks that feed the bottling line. In the case of blended
whiskey (including Canadian), different whiskies are mixed
together, and the grain spirits or other whiskies are added.

Bourbon
Bourbon is the best known and probably the most popular
whiskey produced in the United States. It has an amber color
and a slightly sweet flavor. By law, straight bourbon must be
made from at least 51 percent corn, and it must be aged in
brand new charred oak barrels for at least two years.
Although Tennessee whiskey doesn’t have to be made this
way, both Tennessee distilleries — George Dickel and Jack
Daniel’s — also follow these guidelines. After aging, only pure

Some alcohol-related jargon
When you read about the production of alcoholic beverages, you see terms
like proof and distillation thrown around. Here’s what they mean.
Proof is the strength of an alcoholic beverage. In the United States, the scale
is 200 degrees, with each degree equal to 0.5 percent alcohol by volume. So
a 100-proof spirit is 50 percent alcohol. A 200-proof spirit is after-shave or 100
percent alcohol.
Distillation is the process of converting a liquid by heating it into a gas or
vapor, which is then condensed back into a liquid form. In the case of liquor
production, the liquid is a blend of ingredients that have been fermented so
that it contains some alcohol. When you heat this liquid, the alcohol it con-
tains vaporizes first (because alcohol has a lower boiling point than, say,
water). So the vapor that’s trapped and later condensed back into a liquid has
a much higher alcohol content than the original liquid. Distillation is usually
performed by a still. There are two basic types:
 The pot still: A copper or copper-lined vessel with a large bottom and a
long, tapered neck connected by a copper pipe to a cooling spiral tube,
which is the condenser. As the liquid boils, it evaporates. The vapor rises
up to the condenser, cools, and returns back to a liquid state with alcohol.
Often this process is repeated to achieve the right alcohol level.
 The continuous still: Also known as a column still, patent still, and Coffey
still, the continuous still has tall copper columns that continually trickle
liquid down over many steam-producing plates. The vapor is drawn into
vents and condensed. A continuous still performs under the same princi-
ples as a pot still but can work with a constant flow of materials coming
in and going out, which is great for mass production.

water can be added to reduce the barrel proof strength to 
bottling (selling) proof. Scotch, Canadian whiskies, and Irish
whiskies can have added caramel coloring, but bourbon can’t.
A little history
Settlers on the east coast of North America began making
rye whiskey in the 1700s. They were mostly immigrants from
Scotland, England, and Northern Ireland and weren’t familiar
with corn. In the 1790s, when the U.S. government imposed a
tax on distilled spirits, the whiskey makers of Pennsylvania
revolted, culminating in the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794.
President Washington called out federal troops to put down
the rebellion, and many distillers fled west to Kentucky
where the law wasn’t imposed quite so strictly.
In Kentucky, early settlers had already begun making whiskey
from corn, and the newcomers quickly learned how to use this
American grain to make what would be known as bourbon. Its
name came about because it was shipped from Bourbon County
in Kentucky down to places such as St. Louis and New Orleans
where it soon became known as “whiskey from Bourbon,” and
eventually, bourbon whiskey.

Specialty bourbons
As you discover bourbon whiskey, you will come across sev-
eral different types within this category, including small batch
and single barrel.
Small batch
A small batch bourbon is produced and distilled in small
quantities of approximately 1,000 gallons or less. In other
words, it’s made in small batches, but you probably figured
that out. The following are small batch bourbons:
Part II: Short Shots from American Whiskey to Wine 
46

 Baker’s
 Old Rip Van Winkle
 Knob Creek
 Basil Hayden’s Small Batch
 Booker’s Small Batch
 Maker’s Mark Kentucky Homemade Bourbon
 Woodford Reserve Distiller’s Select
 Elijah Craig 12 Year Selected Barrel Bourbon
Single barrel
Single barrel bourbon also has a self-explanatory name. Each
bottle contains bourbon whiskey from just one barrel, with no
blending. Some single-barrel bourbons include
 Benchmark/XO Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Bourbon
 Blanton’s Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Bourbon
 Elijah Craig Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Bourbon
 Henry McKenna Single Barrel Kentucky Straight
Bourbon
 Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel
 Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit Single Barrel Kentucky
Straight Bourbon
 Evan Williams Single Barrel Vintage Kentucky Straight
Bourbon
A limited number of distilleries produce a whiskey bottled at
barrel proof, which sometimes exceeds the 125-proof legal
limit. Pretty potent stuff. Barrel proof whiskey enters the
barrel at 125 proof and gains strength during aging. Drink at
your own risk.
Tennessee Whiskey
Tennessee whiskey differs from bourbon in that it’s mellowed
(altered) through sugar-maple charcoal before it’s aged.
Although both whiskies are usually filtered before bottling, 
Chapter 5: American and Canadian Whisk(e)y 47

it’s the sugar-maple charcoal that adds a different flavor to
Tennessee whiskies.
The following are the only two producers of Tennessee whiskey:
 George Dickel Tennessee Whiskey: Old No 8. Brand: 80
proof. Old No. 12 Superior Brand: 90 proof. Barrel
Reserve: 10 years old and 86 proof.
 Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey: Black
Label: 86 proof. Green Label: 80 proof, available only in
the U.S. Gentleman Jack: 80 proof.
Rye Whiskey
Distilled at no more than 160 proof, rye whiskey is a fermented
mash or grain containing at least 51 percent rye. It’s matured
in new charred oak barrels for a minimum of two years. Rye
has a strong, distinctive flavor. Some popular brands of rye
whiskey are
 Old Overholt: 4 years old and 80 proof.
 Jim Beam Rye: 80 proof.
 Wild Turkey Rye: 80 proof.
 Rittenhouse: 80 and 100 proof.
Canadian Whisky
Canadian whisky (spelled without the e) is a blend of aged
grain whisky and heavier flavored blended whiskies that’s
aged in oak casks for a minimum of three years. There are no
limitations as to the grain, distilling proof, formula, or type of
barrels used. Each distiller is allowed to make its own type of
whisky. Most Canadian whisky is aged in white oak barrels.
Canadian whiskies sold to the United States are blends bot-
tled at a minimum of 80 proof and are generally three years
old or older. Popular brands include
 Black Velvet: 80 proof and 3 years old.
 Canadian Club: 80 proof and 6 years old.
Part II: Short Shots from American Whiskey to Wine 
48

 Canadian Mist: 80 proof and 3 years old.
 Crown Royal, Crown Royal Special Reserve, and Crown
Royal XR: All 80 proof.
 Seagram’s V.O.: 86 proof; aged 6 years (the V.O. means
“Very Own” or “Very Old”).
 Tangle Ridge: 100 percent rye whisky aged for 10 years
in oak barrels, blended with sherry and other natural 
flavors, and then recased before bottling.
Blended Whiskey
American blended whiskey is a mixture of at least 20 percent
bourbon, corn, or rye whiskies with neutral spirits or grain
whiskey. Sometimes, additional coloring and enhancers are
added. Blends are bottled at no less than 80 proof.
Those whiskies blended with neutral spirits have a label on
the back of the bottle that states percentages of straight and
neutral spirits. The most famous and biggest seller of blended
whiskey is Seagram 7 Crown. It, of course, is part of that famous
drink, the “14” — a seven and seven.
Other brands of blended whiskey include the following:
 Barton Reserve
 Carstairs
 Imperial
 Fleishmann’s
 Mattingly & Moore
Wheat and Corn Whiskey
Wheat whiskey must contain 51 percent of a single type
of grain, and must be aged a minimum of 2 years in a new
charred white oak barrel. As a commercial product, this type
of whiskey is relatively new. (For all I know, some wheat farm-
ers in the Midwest have been making this stuff for a couple of
centuries, but you couldn’t buy it at the local liquor store
until recently.) The only brand available at press time is
Chapter 5: American and Canadian Whisk(e)y 49

Bernheim Original Straight Wheat Whiskey (90 proof). More
brands are likely to follow.
Corn whiskey is similar to bourbon, except that it must be
made of a mash consisting of at least 81 percent corn. It’s still
called moonshine or white lightning in the southern United
States. Available brands include
 Georgia Moon
 Mellow Corn
 Dixie Dew
 J.W. Corn
Storing and Serving Suggestions
American whiskey and Canadian whisky can be served
straight, on ice, with water or seltzer, or mixed as a cocktail.
Store an unopened bottle in a cool, dry place. After opening, a
typical bottle should have a shelf life of at least two years.

Apéritifs, Cordials,
and Liqueurs
In This Chapter
 Some tasty before-dinner drinks
 A variety of cordials and liqueurs
 Serving suggestions
T
his chapter is a catch-all for a handful of different liquor
categories. Apéritifs were developed specifically as pre-
meal beverages. Cordials and liqueurs have a variety of pur-
poses. Some are great mixers, others are good after-dinner
drinks, and a few make good apéritifs as well. Go figure.
Apéritifs: Great Ways to Whet
Your Appetite
Apéritif comes from the Latin word aperire meaning to open.
An apéritif is usually any type of drink you would have before a
meal. Most apéritifs are usually low in alcohol and mild tasting.
You can drink many of the cordials and liqueurs listed later in
this chapter as apéritifs as well. I don’t have much more to
say about apéritifs other than to talk about the individual
products that are available, such as the following:
 Amer Picon (French): A blend of African oranges, gen-
tian root, quinine bark, and some alcohol. Usually served
with club soda or seltzer water with lemon.

 Campari (Italian): A unique combination of fruits, spices,
herbs, and roots.
 Cynar (Italian): A bittersweet apéritif that’s made from
artichokes. Best when served over ice with a twist of
lemon or orange.
 Dubonnet (American): Produced in California and avail-
able in blond and red. Serve chilled.
 Fernet Branca (Italian): A bitter, aromatic blend of
approximately 40 herbs and spices (including myrrh,
rhubarb, chamomile, cardamom, and saffron) in a base
of grape alcohol. Mint-flavored Fernet Branca is also
available. It’s called Branca Menta.
 Jagermeister (German): Composed of 56 botanicals,
including citrus peel, aniseed, licorice, poppy seeds, 
saffron, ginger, juniper berries, and ginseng.
 Lillet (French): Made in Bordeaux from a blend of 85 per-
cent fine Bordeaux wines and 15 percent fruit liqueurs.
Lillet Blanc is made from Sauvignon Blanc and Semillion
and has a golden color. Lillet Rouge is made from Merlot
and Cabernet Sauvignon and has a ruby red color.
 Pernod (French): Comes from the essence of Badiane
(anise star) and from a spirit made from natural herbs,
such as mint and balm.
 Punt e Mes (Italian): Vermouth with bitters and other
botanicals added.
 Ricard (French): Made from anise, fennel (green anise),
licorice, and other Provencal herbs.
 Suze (French): French bitters distilled from gentian root.
Gentian is grown in the Auvergne and Jura regions and is
a large, originally wild flower with golden petals.
Cordials and Liqueurs
Cordial comes from the Latin word cor meaning heart, and
liqueur is derived from the Latin meaning melt or dissolve.
Both words are interchangeable, although liqueurs are more
popular in Europe, and cordials are more popular in the
United States. From this point on, I’ll use the word cordial to
describe both.
Part II: Short Shots from American Whiskey to Wine 
52

Cordials are made by infusing the flavor of fruits, herbs, spices,
and other plants with a spirit, such as brandy or whiskey. As
you’ll discover from the list later in this chapter, cordials come
in many different varieties. Most are sweet. In fact, cordials sold
in the United States contain up to 35 percent sugar and must
contain a minimum of 25 percent sugar by weight.
Within the cordial category are crèmes and fruit-flavored
brandies. Crèmes have a high sugar content, which makes
them, well, creamy. Usually, the name of such a cordial indi-
cates what it tastes like. Crème de banana tastes like bananas,
and apricot brandy tastes like apricots.
There are more cordials in the world than any one person
can list. What I try to do here is describe the ones that you’re
likely to see in the recipes in this book. Someone somewhere
probably makes a soy-sauce-and-aloe-flavored cordial, and
maybe it tastes great, but nobody I know is ever going to ask
for it, so I’m not going to list it. Instead, I give you the following
common cordials:
 99 Bananas is a rich flavored, 99 proof banana cordial.
Also available are 99 Apples, 99 Oranges, and 99
Blackberries.
Chapter 6: Apéritifs, Cordials, and Liqueurs 53
What’s Angostura?
Angostura aromatic bitters are a blend of rare tropical herbs and spices that
are used to flavor and season a great variety of food dishes and certain alco-
holic and nonalcoholic drinks.
Dr. Johann Siegert, Surgeon-General in the army of the great liberator of South
America, Simon Bolivar, first compounded the formula in 1824. Dr. Siegert’s
headquarters were in the port of Angostura, Venezuela, a city now known as
Ciudad Bolivar. The doctor experimented for four years before finding the
exact formula that he was after. He wanted to use the bitters to improve the
appetites and well-being of his troops. Sailors pulling into the port discovered
the bitters and bought bottles to carry away with them. Soon the fame of
Angostura bitters spread around the world. Angostura bitters are used in many
cocktails, including the Manhattan, Old Fashioned, and Rob Roy.

 Absente is a product from France that’s similar in flavor
to Absinthe but without the bad reputation or toxic side
effects (see below).
 Absinthe is often called the Green Muse because of its
pale greenish color and the dreamy state it induces in
imbibers. Absinthe is 65 percent alcohol, or a whopping
130 proof. Because it contains wormwood (a plant that
many believe is a narcotic and also toxic, causing death
and/or madness), it’s outlawed in most of the world.
(No, I don’t know where you can buy it, in case you
were wondering.)
 Akvavit is a barley and potato distillate that’s clear, col-
orless, and potent. It’s a Scandinavian drink originally
made in Aalborg, Denmark.
 Alizé is a blend of passion fruit juices and cognac. It’s
available in several varieties.
 Amaretto is an almond-flavored cordial.
 Amarula Cream is made from the fruit of the Marula Tree
from Africa and added to the highest quality cream.
 Anisette gets its name from the aniseed, which imparts its
rich licorice-like flavor to this cordial. Practically every
Mediterranean country has a variation of the anise liqueur,
such as Sambuca in Italy, Ouzo in Greece, and so on.
 Applejack is distilled from the mash of apples and is the
best known and most typical fruit brandy in the United
States.
 Agavero Tequila Liqueur is a blend of blue Anejo and
Reposada tequilas with natural damiana flower.
 Barenjager Honey Liqueur is a honey liqueur made in
Germany.
 Baileys Irish Cream is made from fresh dairy cream,
Irish whiskey, and natural flavorings. The Irish whiskey
acts as a preservative for the cream, which is why Baileys
doesn’t need to be refrigerated. It also comes in caramel
and mint chocolate flavors.
 Benedictine contains more than 27 herbs and spices,
including cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, myrrh, and vanilla.
B&B, which stands for Benedictine and Brandy, is a blend
of Benedictine and cognac.

 Black Haus is made from blackberries.
 Blue Curacao is essentially the same as Orange Curacao
except that a deep blue color has been added, and it’s
slightly lower in proof. (See Chapter 5 for an explanation
of proof.)
 Bols produces a complete line of flavored brandies and
cordials.
 Bunratty Meade is a blend of honey, selected herbs, and
wine.
 Calvados is an applejack made in Normandy and aged
about four years.
 Carolans Irish Cream combines Irish spirits and whiskey
with rich double cream and subtle flavors, principally
honey.
 Celtic Crossing is created by combining Irish malt
whiskies and cognac with a hint of honey.
 Chambord is made with framboise (small black raspber-
ries) and other fruits and herbs combined with honey. It
has a dark purple color.
 Chartreuse comes in green and yellow varieties and is
made with more than 130 herbs and spices. It’s normally
sold at 4 years of age (aged in the bottle), but 12-year-old
labels are also produced.
 Chocoviac is a smooth, aged Cognac blended with dark
chocolate from Switzerland and a rich vanilla from
Madagascar.
 CocoRibe is a liqueur of wild island coconuts laced with
Virgin Island rum.
 Cointreau is a clear cordial made from a blend of sweet
and bitter oranges.
 Crème de Cacao is made from vanilla and cacao beans. It
comes in white and brown varieties.
 Crème de Framboise is a raspberry-flavored liqueur.
 Crème de Cassis is made from black currants imported
from France and other selected fruits and berries.
 Crème de Menthe is made from mint and spearmint. It
comes in green and white (clear) varieties.
Chapter 6: Apéritifs, Cordials, and Liqueurs 55

 Crème de Noyaux is made from a combination of sweet
and bitter almonds.
 Cuarenta Y Tres (Licor 43) is made from a secret formula

Blueberry, ButterShots, HotDamn, Key Largo, Old Tavern
Rootbeer, Peachtree, Peppermint, Sour Apple, Tropical,
Spearmint, and WilderBerry.
 Der Lachs Goldwasser is a mysterious blend of 25 herbs,
spices, and real 22-karat gold flakes.
 Drambuie is made with the finest highland malt whiskies,
no less than 15 years old, heather honey, and special
herbs that are prepared in secret.
 Echte Kroatzbeere is made with blackberries.
 Frangelico is made from wild hazelnuts blended with
berries and flowers.
 Galliano is a golden-colored liqueur made with lavender,
anise, yarrow musk, and juniper and blended with exotic

Storing and Serving Suggestions
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, you should serve apéri-
tifs before a meal. Most can be served either straight up or on
the rocks.
Most cordials are served after dinner or mixed as cocktails
and served over crushed ice as frappés.
Store an unopened apéritif, cordial, or liqueur bottle in a cool,
dry area that’s always out of direct light. After a bottle is
opened, it should have a shelf life of three years.

B
asically, beer is an alcoholic beverage that’s fermented 
and brewed from rice, barley, corn, hops, water, and yeast.
Beer has been brewed for thousands of years, beginning with
the Egyptians. Today, thousands of different varieties of beer are
enjoyed throughout the world. The United States has more than
900 microbrews (made by small independent brewers) alone.
Germany brags of having over 1,200 breweries.
Beer enjoys the distinction of coming to the Americas on 
the Mayflower and, in fact, seems to have played a part in 
the Pilgrims’ decision to land at Plymouth Rock instead of 
farther south, as intended. A journal written by one of the 
passengers — which is now in the U.S. Library of Congress —
states in an entry from 1620 that the Mayflower landed at
Plymouth because “we could not now take time for further
search or consideration, our victuals being much spent, espe-
cially our beer. . . .”
The first commercial brewery in America was founded in New
Amsterdam (New York City) in 1613. Many patriots owned their
own breweries, among them General Israel Putnam and William
Penn. Thomas Jefferson was also interested in brewing and
made beer at Monticello. George Washington even had his
own brew house on the grounds of Mount Vernon, and his
handwritten recipe for beer — dated 1757 and taken from
his diary — is still preserved.

How Beer Is Made
The beer brewing process begins with pure water, corn grits,
and malted barley. Malted barley is the basic ingredient and
is often referred to as the “soul of beer.” It contributes to the
color and characteristic flavor of beer. What does malted
mean? It means that the barley has been steeped or soaked
in water and allowed to germinate or grow. Brewing beer is a
step-by-step process:
1. The corn grits and malt are cooked and blended to
create mash.
2. A sugary liquid, called wort, is extracted from the
mash. (The remaining solid portion of the mash, the
brewer’s grain, is sold as feed.)
3. The wort is transferred to the brew kettles, where it’s
boiled and hops are added. Hops are responsible for
the rich aroma and the delicate bitterness in beer.
4. The wort then moves to the wort cooler.
5. Yeast, which converts sugar into alcohol and carbon
dioxide, and sterile air are added next, and the wort
moves to fermentation tanks for a carefully controlled
time period.
Two different types of yeast can be used: bottom and top.
 Bottom yeast settles to the bottom of the tank after con-
verting all the sugar, and the resulting beer is a lager.
 Top yeast rises to the top of the tank when it’s done with
the sugar, and the beer it produces is an ale.
Types of Beer
You’ve probably seen some of the following terms on beer
labels, or maybe you’ve heard them in beer commercials.
 Ale is top-fermented beer. It’s a little bitter, usually tastes
hoppy, and has a higher alcohol content.
Part II: Short Shots from American Whiskey to Wine 
62

 Bitter beer is a strong ale, usually English, with a higher
than normal alcohol content and, as the name implies, a
bittersweet taste.
 Bock beer is a dark, strong, slightly sweet lager beer
brewed from caramelized malt.
 Ice beer is brewed at colder than normal temperatures
and then chilled to below freezing, forming crystals. The
crystals are filtered out, leaving a smoother tasting beer
with a slightly higher alcohol content.
 Lager is a bottom-fermented beer stored at very low
(cold) temperatures for a long period of time (several
months). The word lager is German for to store.
 Lambic beer is brewed in Belgium. Ingredients such as
peaches, raspberries, cherries, and wheat are added
during the brewing process.
 Light beer has fewer calories and less alcohol.
 Malt liquor is fermented at a higher temperature than
other beers, which results in a higher alcohol content.
 Pilsner is a light, hoppy, dry lager.
 Sake is beer brewed and processed from rice. (Some 
consider sake a wine.) Sake is served warm or at room
temperature.
 Stout is an ale produced from heavily roasted barley. It’s
darker in color and has a slightly bitter flavor.
 Trappist beer is brewed in Belgium or the Netherlands by
Trappist monks. It contains high levels of alcohol and is
usually dark in color.
 Wheat beer is made, as you might expect, with wheat. It’s
usually garnished with a lemon and sometimes raspberry
syrup.
Storing and Serving Suggestions
In the United States, beer is served cold (40 degrees
Fahrenheit). Lower temperatures tend to dull the taste, so
consider 40 degrees the lower limit. Store beer away from 
sunlight, or you’ll have skunked beer, which is never pleasant.

Most beers now have labels that say when they were brewed
or when to remove them from the shelf.

randy is made in most countries that produce wine.
Brandy is derived from the Dutch term brandewijn,
meaning burnt wine. The term was known as branntwein or
weinbrand in Germany, brandevin in France, and brandywine
in England. Today, the word has been shortened to brandy.
What Is It?
Brandy is made by distilling wine or fruit and then aging it in
oak barrels. The difference in brandy varies from country to
country. Soil, climate, grapes, production methods, and blend-
ing give each brandy its own unique flavor and style.
When brandy is produced, it undergoes four basic processes:
fermentation of the grape, distillation to brandy, aging in oak
barrels, and blending by the master blender.
American Brandy
Brandy was introduced to California more than 200 years ago
by Spanish missionaries. Taking advantage of the healthy soil,
good climate, and water, American brandy production pri-
marily occurs in the San Joaquin Valley. California produces the

largest percentage of American brandy, and all California
brandy has to be aged a minimum of two years. Here are some
popular brands:
 Carneros Alambic: The first alambic (cognac-style)
brandy in California.
 Christian Brothers: This brandy is processed and aged in
Napa Valley.
 E&J Gallo: They produce E&J Brandy (Gold), E&J V.S.O.P.
Brandy, and E&J White Brandy.
 Germain-Robin: Another excellent alambic brandy from
California.
 Korbel: A California brandy from the Korbel Distillery.
Brandies from Around the World
Check out the following list to find the names of just a few
brands that are worth trying.
 Asbach Uralt (Germany): The top-selling brandy in
Germany.
 Aztec DeOro (Mexico): A 12-year-old brandy made using
the solera method. (See the sidebar, “The solera method,”
in this chapter.)
 Carlos I (Spain): Ranked among the finest in the world.
 Don Pedro (Mexico): Pot stilled and solera aged.
 Fellipe II (Spain): The number-one selling Spanish
brandy in the United States.
 Metaxa (Greece): The most famous Greek brandy.
 Presidente (Mexico): The largest-selling brandy in
Mexico and the world.
 Stock 84 (Italy): Produced by Stock Distillery of Trieste,
Italy.
Peru and Chile both produce a clear, unaged brandy called
pisco, which is made from muscat grapes.

Cognac and armagnac are two special types of French
brandies. They’re so special that I cover them in a separate
chapter — Chapter 9 to be exact.
Fruit Brandy
Fruit brandies are produced from all kinds of (guess what?)
fruits. The fruit is washed and ground into a mash. Water
and yeast are added and allowed to ferment. After the sugar
metabolizes, the mash is pressed and the liquid is then dis-
tilled. Some fruit brandies are aged in oak barrels. Some of the
major types are listed as follows:
 Applejack: An apple brandy produced in the United
States. 
 Calvados: An apple brandy made from a variety of apples
from northwestern France.
 Framboise: Made from raspberries.
 Kirsch: Made from cherries.
 Poire: Made from pears, usually from Switzerland and
France. (Poire William is a pear brandy that contains a
fully mature pear. While each pear is still on the branch,
it’s placed in the bottle. When the pear is mature, it’s
washed in the bottle, and the bottle is then filled with
pear brandy.)
 Slivovitz: Made from plums, usually from Germany or
Hungary.
Chapter 8: Brandy 67
What the heck does alambic mean?
Alambic, the French word for still, is the word approved for label use by the
U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF). It denotes brandy dis-
tilled on a batch-process pot still rather than on a continued-column still.
Cognac, armagnac, and high-quality fruit brandies are distilled on various
types of pot stills. The major American alambic brandy producers, Germain-
Robin and Carneros Alambic, use cognac stills. A cognac still entails two dis-
tillations, but small quantities have been made on single-distillation alsatian
fruit stills by distillers of American fruit brandies, such as St. George Spirits.

Fruit-Flavored Brandies
In the United States, fruit-flavored brandies are classified as
cordials and are bottled usually over 70 proof. Sugar, natural
coloring, fruit, and other flavorings are added. You can find
brandies flavored with such diverse ingredients as apricots,
bananas, coffee, and peaches.
Storing and Serving Suggestions
Brandy is traditionally served straight up in a snifter after
dinner, but it’s also mixed with water or soda and can be
found in some famous cocktails, including the delicious
Brandy Alexander. Store an unopened bottle out of sunlight.
After opening, a bottle of brandy can last up to three years.
Brandy doesn’t improve with age in the bottle, so it will taste
no better if you let it sit in the bottle in your basement for
ten years.
Part II: Short Shots from American Whiskey to Wine 
68
The solera method
The solera method of making brandy is comprised of three aging stages:
1. The wine spirits are blended and placed for some months in barrels.
2. Half of the brandy in each barrel is then blended in another barrel con-
taining older brandy.
3. Finally, half of that barrel is placed in yet another barrel containing even
older brandy.

 Deciphering the designations on labels
 What the well-known brands are
 Finishing a meal with a warm drink
F
rance produces two kinds of brandy: cognac and arma-
gnac. Both are named after the region in which they’re
made, and both are delicious.
Cognac
Cognac can be produced only in the legally defined region
of Cognac, France, located between the Atlantic and Massif
Central, specifically at the junction between the oceanic and
continental climate zones. The region also straddles the divid-
ing line between northern and southern climates. These four
influences create a multitude of microclimates. In addition to
the unique climate, the soil characteristics also foster a range
of wine and, consequently, the cognac of each region. In 1909,
the French government passed a law that only brandy produced
in the “delimited area” surrounding the town of Cognac can be
called cognac.
How it’s made
The arduous, time-honored distilling and aging process is
what makes cognac so special. The cognac you drink today

was produced using methods dating back to the 17th century.
The distillation of cognac is a two-stage process:
1. A first distillate, known as brouillis, is obtained, with
an alcoholic strength of 28 to 32 percent.
2. The brouillis is returned to the boiler for a second
heating, which produces a liquid known as la bonne
chauffe. In this second distillation, the beginning and
the end of distillation (the head and tail) are discarded,
leaving only the heart of the spirit, which becomes
cognac.
The cognac is then sent to rest in oak casks made from wood
from the Limousin and Troncais forests.
Maturing slowly over long years in cellars, the cognac acquires
a smoothness and flavor beyond compare. The wood and the
dark, saturated atmosphere of the cellars work together to
develop the aroma of the cognac to its full potential. All
cognac is aged a minimum of 30 months.
What are all those letters on
the label?
When you shop for cognac, you see all kinds of designations
on the labels of various brands — for example, Courvoisier
V.S., Martell V.S.O.P., and Remy Martin X.O. The letters and
phrases after the brand name are a general indication of the
age (and, in turn, expensiveness) of the cognac.
Every major brand produces cognacs of different ages. When
one of the following designations is used, it indicates the age
of the youngest cognac used in the blend that makes up
what’s in the bottle.
 V.S. (Very Superior) or Three Stars: The cognac is aged
less than 41⁄2 years.
 V.S.O.P. (Very Superior Old Pale): The cognac has aged
between 41⁄2 and 61⁄2 years. Sometimes called V.O. (Very
Old) or Reserve.
 X.O. (Extremely Old), Napoleon, Hors d’age, V.S.S.O.P.,
Cordon Bleu, Grand Reserve, and Royal: The cognac
has aged at least 51⁄2 years and up to 40 years.
Part II: Short Shots from American Whiskey to Wine 
70

Generally speaking, each cognac producer uses blends that
are much older than the minimum required. In the most pres-
tigious cognacs, some of the blends may have matured over
several decades.
You’re also going to see some of these names on the labels:
 Grand Fine Champagne or Grande Champagne: These
identify cognacs made exclusively from grapes grown in
the Grande Champagne region of Cognac.
 Petite Fine Champagne or Petite Champagne: These
names mean that the cognac is a blend made from grapes
grown in the Grande Champagne and Petite Champagne
sections of Cognac. At least 50 percent of the blend must
be from grapes grown in the Grande Champagne Region.
The terms fine cognac and grande fine, which may also appear
on cognac labels, have no legally defined meaning. The desig-
nations extra old (E.O.) and very old pale (V.O.P.) are not offi-
cially recognized by the Bureau du Cognac, which makes up
all the names and rules.
You won’t see vintage dates on cognac labels because in 1963,
the French passed a law prohibiting the placement of vintage
labels on cognac bottles. Go figure.
Popular brands
Even though all cognacs are produced in the same region, and
even though every brand seems to have the same jumble of age
designations on their labels, you may be surprised at the degree
of distinctiveness among the brands. Some brands have a strong,
room-filling aroma; some have a mild grape flavor; others have
Chapter 9: Cognac and Armagnac 71
The angels’ share
Aging cognac and armagnac is very expensive, not only because it ties up
capital, but because millions of bottles per year disappear into the air through
evaporation as the spirit sits in its oak casks. To make fine cognac and arma-
gnac, you can’t avoid this loss, and producers refer to it as the angels’ share.

hints of caramel and vanilla. If you’re a fan of cognac, my advice
is that you not only try several different brands, but that you
also try some of the variations within each brand.
If you’re curious to find out what an older cognac (X.O. or
better) tastes like, visit a decent bar and order a glass (and
be prepared to pay 10 to 20 U.S. dollars) before you decide to
invest in an expensive bottle of cognac.
In the following list, the available styles for each brand are
listed from the least expensive to the most expensive. All
cognacs are 80 proof.
 Alize produces V.S. and V.S.O.P.
 Courvoisier produces V.S., V.S.O.P. Fine Champagne,
V.S.O.P. Exclusif, Napoleon Fine Champagne, X.O.

 Remy Martin produces Grand Cru, V.S.O.P., 1783 Accord
Royal, X.O. Excellence, Extra, and Louis XIII de Remy
Martin.
Armagnac
Armagnac, though less well known than cognac, is France’s
oldest brandy and has been produced continuously since the
15th century (as early as 1422). It’s distilled from premium
white wine grown in the Armagnac region of southwest France.
Part II: Short Shots from American Whiskey to Wine 
72

How it’s made
Armagnac is a distillate produced from the continuous, or
single, distillation process. Neutral white wine registering
about 9 to 10 percent alcohol is heated in a traditional copper
alambic pot still at a relatively low temperature. The vapors
pass through the swan neck coils and produce a spirit of no
more than 63 percent alcohol. This combination of low tem-
perature and lower alcohol produces a spirit that retains more
flavor and aroma elements in the brandy. The clear brandy is
then put into casks traditional to the region, handcrafted 400
liter-barrels made from Armagnac or Limousin oak. The aging
process begins and can last from 1 to 50 years. The spirit
takes on flavors of the wood and other special nuances as it
matures, creating a brandy of complexity and distinction. It is
then up to the cellarmaster to blend the separate barrels into
a harmonious whole to create the full range of armagnacs.
How to read the label
The French government regulates armagnac labeling. The 
following designations are used:
 V.S. or Three Stars means that the youngest brandy in
the blend is at least 3 years old.
 V.O. (Very Old), V.S.O.P. (Very Special Old Pale), and
Reserve mean that the youngest brandy in the blend is at
least 41⁄2 years old.
 Extra, Napoleon, X.O., Vieille Reserve, and other similar
labels indicate that the youngest brandy is at least 51⁄2
years old.
Unlike cognac, armagnac products may carry a vintage date.
All nonvintage armagnacs contain much older brandies than
indicated on the labels. Vintage armagnacs are the unblended
product of a single year’s production.
Popular brands
 Sempe produces 6-year-old and 15-year-old varieties. Its
Xtra Grand Reserve is a blend of brandies aged from 35
to 50 years.
Chapter 9: Cognac and Armagnac 73

 Janneau produces V.S.O.P., Selection (aged 8 to 10 years),
and Reserve de la Maison. A 1966 vintage is also sold.
 Armagnac Lapostolle X.O. is matured for over 30 years.
Storing and Serving Suggestions
Cognac and armagnac are after-dinner drinks. Cognac is
seldom mixed, but people have been known to drink it with
soda or water. Both cognac and armagnac are excellent com-
panions to coffee, tea, and cigars. They should be served at
room temperature and in clear, crystal brandy snifters. Like all
fine brandies, cognac and armagnac should be gently swirled in
the glass and then sipped and savored. If stored in a cool, dry
place, an opened bottle of either brandy should last for two
years.

 Recognizing the different kinds of gin
 Avoiding cheap well gin
G
in is basically a distilled grain spirit flavored with 
extracts from different plants, mainly the juniper berry.
The Dutch were the first to make gin and have been doing so
since the late 1500s.
A Little History
Gin was invented by Franciscus de la Boe, also known as Dr.
Sylvius. Why? Who knows but Mrs. Sylvius? Dr. Sylvius was a
professor of medicine and physician at Holland’s University of
Leyden. He used a juniper berry elixir known as genievere —
French for juniper. He thought that juniper berries could assist
in the treatment of kidney and bladder ailments.
British soldiers sampled his elixir when returning from the
wars in the Netherlands and nicknamed it “Dutch courage.”
When they brought the recipe back to England, they changed
the name to gen and later to gin, which soon became the
national drink of England. At one time, London alone had
more than 7,000 gin places.
Types of Gin
Although gin has been produced and consumed for centuries,
the methods for making the quality gin that you drink today

have been around only since the turn of the 20th century. Gin
comes in many types — the most popular include the following:
 London dry gin (English) is distilled from a grain mixture
that contains more barley than corn. It’s distilled at a
high proof and then redistilled with juniper berries.
 Dutch gin or Holland gin contains barley, malt, corn,
and rye. It’s distilled at a lower proof and then redistilled
with juniper berries in another still at low proof. Dutch
gins are usually slightly sweet.
 Flavored gin is a new product. It’s basically gin to which
natural flavorings have been added (lime, lemon, orange,
and so on). The flavoring always appears on the bottle.
Popular Brands
The following are all London dry gins. Each brand has its own
distinctive flavor that comes from a carefully-guarded recipe.
 Beefeater: The only premium dry gin distillery in London.
 Beefeater WET: A lighter-tasting gin (70 proof) made
with natural pear flavors.
 Bombay: Made from a well-guarded recipe that dates
back to 1761.
 Bombay Sapphire: Conceived by Michel Roux, President
of Carillon Importers, Sapphire has more natural botanical
ingredients than any other gin.
 Broker’s: Made from 100 percent English grain, quadruple
distilled, and flavored with ten botanicals.
 Gordon’s: First distilled more than 225 years ago in
London by Alexander Gordon, who pioneered and per-
fected the making of an unsweetened gin with a smooth
character and aromatic flavors known as London Dry.
 Hendricks: A Scottish gin with juniper, coriander, rose
petal, citrus, and an infusion of cucumber.
 Magelian Gin: A French gin handcrafted in small batches
using natural exotic botanicals from around the globe.
Part II: Short Shots from American Whiskey to Wine 
76

 Plymouth: Legend has it that a surgeon in the Royal Navy
invented this gin to help the sailors make their Angostura
bitters more palatable (pink gin).
 Q: Imported from England and distilled five times, this 
80 proof gin includes lotus leaves, lavender, and other
botanicals.
 Seagram’s Extra Dry: A citrus-tasting golden gin.
 Tanqueray: Its unique green bottle is said to be inspired
by an English fire hydrant.
 Tanqueray 10: A super premium gin from Tanqueray
with a blend of fresh botanicals, including grapefruit and
camomile. It’s distilled four times.
Storing and Serving Suggestions
As you peruse the recipe section of this book (Chapter 17),
you’ll probably notice that gin appears in many cocktails, so
choosing the right gin (that is, your favorite) can really affect
your enjoyment of a given drink. Never, ever use cheap, non-
premium gin when making a drink. The results will be a disas-
ter. Cheap gin tastes like disinfectant. Good gin has an herby,
spicy, organic flavor, so stick to the premium brands such as
those I list in this chapter.

Eliza Doolittle makes this remark about someone’s drinking at a fashionable
horse race: “Gin was mother’s milk to her.”
Finally, a little poem:
I’m tired of gin
I’m tired of sin
And after last night
Oh boy, am I tired.
—Anonymous

When you’re at a bar, don’t order a gin ’n’ tonic because you’ll
end up with some cheap, awful bar (or “well”) gin. Order a
Tanqueray ’n’ tonic or a Sapphire ’n’ tonic, and you’ll get a
decent drink. The same goes for gin martinis: Always specify
what brand of gin you want or you’ll be sorry.
Store an unopened bottle of gin in a cool, dry place out of
direct light. After opening a bottle, it should last about two
years.

Irish Whiskey
In This Chapter
 Discovering where that distinctive flavor comes from
 Checking out some brands
 Preserving its flavor
T
he Irish have been distilling whiskey for at least 600 years,
if not longer. While it’s safe to say that Irish whiskey has a
distinct character, it’s also equally true to say that each brand
of Irish whiskey is a unique product.
What Makes Irish Whiskey 
Taste So Yummy
Irish whiskey is triple distilled from barley and other grains in
pot stills and aged between five and ten years. One major dif-
ference between Scotch and Irish whiskey is that when drying
the barley malt from which the whiskey is to be distilled, the
Irish use coal instead of peat, which prevents the smoky
flavor found in Scotch whisky.
What’s more, Irish whiskey also gains a great deal of flavor
from the casks in which it’s aged. Depending on the brand,
Irish whiskey is aged in casks that have held sherry, rum, or
bourbon.
For centuries the Irish produced an illegal distilled spirit
called potcheen (po-cheen), a colorless, unaged spirit that’s
high in alcohol content and similar to white lightning in the
southern United States. But as of March 17, 1997, it’s legal and
being produced and sold in Ireland and the rest of the world.

Popular Brands
You may be surprised at the variation of flavors among the
brands of Irish whiskey:
 Bushmills produces Bushmills Premium, Black Bush
Special, Bushmills Single Malt (10 years old), Bushmills
Rare Single Irish Malt (16 years old), and a 21-year-old
Single Malt Irish Whiskey.
 Connemara makes Pot Still Peated Single Malt Irish
Whiskey, a unique product, being the only peated single
malt on the market.
 Jameson Irish Whiskey is the world’s largest-selling Irish
whiskey. It’s aged for 12 years and made from pure Irish
water and a combination of malted and unmalted Irish
barley. Jameson Gold is a blend of rare Irish whiskeys,
which range in age from 8 to 20 years.
 Kilbeggan is Gaelic for little church. What is now an idyl-
lic village in the center of Ireland was for many years an
active religious community built around a monastery.
The first licensed whiskey distillery in the world was
established in Kilbeggan in 1757.
 Knappogue Castle Irish Single Malt Whiskey is pot
stilled using only malted barley and bottled on a vintage
basis. Knappogue also has a single malt whiskey.
 Michael Collins is double distilled in pot stills. The final
blend is aged from 4 to 12 years in oak casks.
 Midleton produces its Very Rare Irish whiskey. It’s a blend
of triple distilled whiskies, ranging from 12 to 21 years old.
It’s matured exclusively in special, individually selected
Bourbon-seasoned American oak casks. Midleton is a
credit to the olde sod.
 Paddy is named for Paddy Flaherty, a salesman for the
Cork Distilleries Company in the 1920s.
 Powers was the first to introduce bottling in Ireland.
 Tullamore Dew is famous for the slogan, “Give every
man his Dew.”

 The Tyrconnell Single Malt Irish Whiskey is made from
a mash of pure malted barley produced at a single distill-
ery. (In contrast, other whiskeys blend a variety of malt
and grain products from several distilleries.)
Storing and Serving Suggestions
The storage of Irish whiskey is very simple. An unopened
bottle will last indefinitely because Irish whiskey doesn’t
mature after it’s bottled. After a bottle is opened, it has a shelf
life of about two years.

R
um is a spirit distilled from sugar cane. It comes in light
and dark varieties and is an ingredient in hundreds of
cocktail recipes.
Rummaging through 
Rum History
Caribbean rum has been exported out of the islands for hun-
dreds of years, linked to the tropical and subtropical climates
where sugar cane thrives. It was Christopher Columbus him-
self who first brought sugar cane to the Caribbean from the
Azores. But the origins of rum are far more ancient, dating
back, most experts say, more than 2,000 years.
Sugar cane grew like a weed in parts of southern China and
India, and Alexander the Great, after conquering India,
brought with him to Egypt “the weed that gives honey without
the help of bees.” The Islamic people from the Middle Ages,
known as the Saracens, passed on their knowledge of distilling
sugar cane to the Moors who made arak, a cane-based proto-
rum and planted sugar cane in Europe sometime after 636 A.D.

Columbus brought sugar cane to Puerto Rico on his second
voyage in 1493. Later, Ponce de León, the first Spanish gover-
nor of the island, planted the first cane fields in Puerto Rico,
which were soon to become vital to the local economy and to
the world’s palate for fine spirits. Some historians speculate
that Ponce de León’s legendary search for a mythical fountain
of youth was, in fact, a much more practical search for a
source of pure water to use in his distillation of rum.
The first sugar mill, a precursor to the Puerto Rican rum
industry, was built in 1524, when the product of cane distilla-
tion was called brebaje, the word rum being a later addition
brought by crusading English seamen.
The popularity of rum continued to spread during the early
19th century. Distilleries prospered and grew in Puerto Rico.
In 1893, the first modern column still was introduced to
Puerto Rico. With this innovation, the foundation was laid for
the island to produce a more refined, smoother-tasting rum at
a dramatically increased pace. Distilleries relocated from vast,
outlying sugar plantations to more accessible sites and soon
became centrally organized and managed. The first Puerto
Rican rum for export to the continental U.S. was shipped in
1897 — some 18,000 gallons.
During the prohibition period of the U.S., most Puerto Rican
rum distillers stayed in business — not by being rumrunners,
but by producing industrial alcohol. When prohibition ended
in 1934, Puerto Rico refocused on the potential of the American
liquor market and slowly began to rebuild its shipments to
U.S. ports. It soon took steps to upgrade its rum production,
and through special government funding and research, cata-
pulted the island’s rum to the forefront of the world’s rum 
production.
With the onset of World War II, manufacturers of U.S. distilled
spirits were ordered to limit their production and manufac-
ture of industrial alcohol for the war effort. However, because
the territorial mandate didn’t apply to Puerto Rico, demand
for Puerto Rican rum increased. Sales were phenomenal
throughout the war years, with rum and Coke being the
national drink during World War II. In 1952, about 100 different
brands of Puerto Rican Rum were on the market. Today, there
are just 12.

84

Rums from Puerto Rico are the leaders in rum sales in the
continental United States. A staggering 77 percent of all rum
sold on the mainland comes from Puerto Rico.
How Rum Is Made
Rum is distilled from molasses, a sticky syrup that results
when sugar cane is boiled down. When first distilled, the
crude rum is between 130 and 180 proof. This rum is then
aged for two to ten years to mellow it out. This aging process
determines whether the rum is light or dark. Rum aged in
charred oak casks becomes dark (caramel and other agents
are added to affect its color). Rum aged in stainless steel
tanks remains colorless.
Most light rum comes from Puerto Rico. Most dark rum comes
from Jamaica, Haiti, and Martinique.
Popular Brands
Rum is produced throughout the Caribbean. Here are several
popular brands:
 Angostura (Trinidad)
 Appleton Estate (Jamaica)

Rum folklore
Legend has it that Paul Revere ordered a mug of rum before his famous ride
from Boston to Lexington. And a Benjamin Franklin invention, the Rum Flip,
made with rum and beer, was raised in 1773 in celebration after the Boston
Tea Party.
Rum may have been the first of all shaken cocktails in the world: At Increase
Arnold’s Tavern in Providence, Rhode Island, thirsty patrons called for “rum,
milk, sugar, cracked ice, shaken in a silver coffee pot until the frost is on the
pot,” topped with nutmeg and ginger.

Scotch Whisky
In This Chapter
 Regional variations
 Peat and barley: A match made in heaven
 How to savor your Scotch
S
cotch whisky (spelled without the e in whiskey) has a dis-
tinctive smoky flavor that’s the result of both the choice
of ingredients and the method of distillation.
Scotch whisky must be distilled in Scotland — but not neces-
sarily bottled in Scotland. Some Scotch whiskies are bottled in
other countries but distilled in Scotland.
Types of Scotch Whisky
Two kinds of Scotch whisky are distilled: malt whisky (from
barley) and grain whisky (from cereals). Malt whiskies are
divided into four groups according to the geographical loca-
tion of the distilleries in which they’re made. Figure 13-1
shows the four main areas of Scotch production.
 Lowland malt whiskies: Made south of an imaginary line
drawn from Dundee in the east to Greenock in the west.
 Highland malt whiskies: Made north of the aforemen-
tioned line.
 Speyside malt whiskies: Made in the valley of the River
Spey. Although these whiskies come from within the area
designated as Highland malt whiskies, the concentration

of distilleries and the specific climatic conditions in
Speyside produce whiskies of an identifiable character,
which enjoys a separate classification.
 Islay malt whiskies: Made on the island of Islay.
Figure 13-1: The four main Scotch-producing regions.
Highlands
Speyside
Lowlands
Islay
Part II: Short Shots from American Whiskey to Wine 
90

Each group has its own clearly defined characteristics, rang-
ing from the lighter-flavored gentle Lowland whiskies to those
distilled on Islay, which are generally regarded as the heaviest
malt whiskies.
Grain distilleries are mostly found in the central belt of Scotland
near the cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh. Single grain whiskies
display individual characteristics in the same way as malts,
although the geographical influence isn’t the same.
Married together, malt whiskies and grain whiskies create
blended Scotch whisky, which accounts for 95 percent of
world sales. As you may expect from the name, a single-malt
Scotch whisky is made from one type of malt, and it’s not
blended with other malts or grain whiskies.
How Scotch Is Made
Scotch whisky made from malts dates back to 1494 to Friar
John Cor and his fellow friars. Until the mid-1800s, nearly all
Scotches were single-malt. Then Andrew Usher came up with
the idea of mixing malt whisky and grain whisky to create
blended Scotch whisky. There can be many (up to 50) differ-
ent types of malt whiskies blended with grain whisky (from
cereals) to make a blended whisky.
1. The first stage of making Scotch whisky is the malting of
barley. The barley is soaked and dried for germination.
During this period, the starch in the barley converts to
fermentable sugar.
2. To stop the germination, the malted barley is smoked,
usually over peat fires in open malt kilns, giving Scotch
whisky its smoky taste.
3. Then the barley is mixed with water and yeast.
Fermentation takes place, and alcohol is the result.
This liquid is then usually pumped into stills and
double-distilled until the correct proof is attained.
4. After distillation, the whisky is placed in used American
oak wine or bourbon barrels and then aged by law for a
minimum of three years. Most Scotch whiskies usually
age from five to ten years, sometimes much longer. It’s
said that the longer a whisky ages, the smoother it
becomes.
Chapter 13: Scotch Whisky 91

Whisky doesn’t improve with age after it’s bottled.
After aging in the barrel, each distiller then completes its own
blending, filtering, and bottling. There are more than 100 dis-
tilleries and more than 2,000 different Scotch whiskies.
Remember, whisky can only be called Scotch whisky if it’s dis-
tilled and matured for at least three years in Scotland.
Popular Blended 
Scotch Whiskies
These are the brands that you’re most likely to find at your
local bar or liquor store:
 Ballantine
 Chivas Regal
 Cutty Sark
 Dewar’s and Dewar’s 12 year old

Single-Malt Scotch
Single-malt Scotch whisky is unblended malt whisky from a
single distillery. The water and malted barley, the raw materi-
als of Scotch whisky, differ from distillery to distillery and
region to region. In addition, the shape and size of the pot
Part II: Short Shots from American Whiskey to Wine 
92

stills, production methods, and variations in topography
and climate contribute to the uniqueness of each distillery’s
single malt.
There are more than 100 single-malt distilleries, so if you’re a
fan of single-malt Scotch whisky, it’s unlikely that you’ll run
out of whiskies to sample and enjoy. The following is a listing
of just a few brands worth trying:
 Aberlour
 Balvenie
 Bowmore
 Dalmore Single Highland Malt
 Glenfiddich
 Glenlivet
 Glenmorangie
 Glenrothes
 Laphroaig
 Lagaulin
 Macallan
 Oban
 Old Stillman’s Dram
 Pig Nose
 Sheep Dip
 Talisker
Storing and Serving Suggestions
Scotch can be served over ice, straight up, with water or club
soda, or in a variety of mixed drinks. Single malts and aged
Scotch whisky (over 12 years) can be served straight up or on
the rocks with a splash of water. After opening, store a bottle
of Scotch whisky in a cool, dry place out of direct light, and it
should have a shelf life of approximately two years.

Tequila and Mezcal

 Taking your pick of the popular brands
 Distilling mezcal from the agave plant, too
 Developing a taste for worms
T
equila and mezcal are both products of Mexico, and both
are made from the agave plant. Tequila is a much more
popular beverage, and mezcal is famous for the worm in the
bottle.
Tequila
Tequila can be traced back to A.D. 1000 and the Aztecs. It was
a milky drink from the agave plants known as pulque.
Since the 17th century and now by Mexican law, all tequila
comes from a certain area known as Tequila, within the state
of Jaliso. In this dry, volcanic soil of the foothills of the Sierra
Madre, you can find the home of Tequila’s largest producers.
Tequila is produced from the heart of one species of agave
plant, the Agave tequilana Weber, or the blue variety. This
heart is known as the pina (head), usually weighing between
80 and 150 pounds. The pina is steamed and shredded until
the aguamiel (juice) runs off. This juice is then mixed with
cane sugar and yeast and fermented for two to three days.
The fermented juice is double-distilled in traditional copper
pot stills to 90 proof or higher. Tequila must contain a mini-
mum of 51 percent distillate from the blue agave plant.

Types of tequila
Tequila comes in four categories:
 Tequila Blanco (white, silver, or platinum tequila):
This tequila comes fresh from the still and may be
brought to commercial proof (saleable proof or for sale
commercially) with the addition of demineralized water.
 Tequila Joven Abocado (gold tequila): This is silver
tequila with the addition of colorings and flavorings to
mellow the flavor.
 Tequila Reposado (reposed or rested tequila): This tequila
is aged for two months to one year in oak tanks or bar-
rels. Flavorings and coloring agents may be added, as
well as demineralized water to bring the tequila to com-
mercial proof.
 Añejo (aged tequila): This tequila is aged for at least one
year in government-sealed oak barrels. Flavorings and
coloring agents may be added, as well as demineralized
water to bring it to commercial proof. When tequilas of
different ages are blended, the youngest age is designated.
Popular tequila brands
You’re likely to find these brands at your local liquor store:
 Agavero: Named after the blue agave plant, this tequila
is a blend of selective 100 percent blue agave Añejo and
Reposado.

Reading a tequila label
The Mexican Government established NORMA (Norma Oficial Mexicana de
Calidad) on March 31, 1978, to set standards of quality for the production of
tequila. On every bottle, the following must appear: the letters NOM followed
by four numbers designating the distillery in which the tequila was produced.
Besides the brand name and NOM, the label must say whether the tequila is
100 percent agave tequila, the proof, and the category of tequila.

 Cabo Wabo: Sammy Hagar’s tequila. It was introduced to
the U.S. around 1996, without Van Halen.
 Chinaco: An ultra-premium tequila.
 Corazon de Agave: An ultra-premium tequila made in
Jalisco, Mexico.
 El Tesoro de Don Felipe: Estate grown and bottled with no
water added. They have an Añejo, Reposado, and Platinum.
 Gran Centenario: Handcrafted in Jalisco, Mexico, from
100 percent blue agave, this ultra-premium tequila is
available in three varieties: Plata (silver), Reposado
(rested), and Añejo (aged).

Generaciones (available in Añejo, Reposado, and Plata).
 Two Fingers: Available in gold, Limitado, and white.
Named after a rogue entrepreneur, tequila producer, and
occasional bandit from the Guadalajara area of Mexico
who had only two fingers on his right hand (the index
and thumb), but five on his left hand.
Chapter 14: Tequila and Mezcal 97

Messin’ with Mezcal
The process of making mezcal hasn’t changed much since the
Spanish arrived in Mexico in the early 1800s and brought with
them distillation technologies. The Aztecs near the mountaintop
settlement of Monte Alban in Oaxaca had cultivated a certain
species of agave plant for juice, which they fermented into
what they called pulque. The Spaniards, wanting something
much more potent, began to experiment with agave.
Mezcal, like tequila, is made from the agave plant, but the
process is different. What’s more, while tequila is made 
exclusively in the northwestern state of Jalisco, mezcal
is exclusive to Oaxaca.
Mezcal has a high potency and strong smoky flavor. Distillers
insist that the drink has medicinal and tonic qualities. In Mexico,
tribal women drink mezcal to withstand the pain of childbirth,
and laborers drink it for added strength.
The famous worm
Worms live in the agave plant and are hand-harvested during
the rainy summer season. They’re stored in mezcal, drained
and sorted, and placed in bottles near the end of the process.
The worm is what makes mezcal unique; it’s added as a
reminder that it comes from the plant from which the alcohol
is made.
Apocryphal legends note that the worm gives strength to
anyone brave enough to gulp it down. Some even believe
it acts as an aphrodisiac. Like the drink itself, the worm is
something of an acquired taste.
A few brands
The number of mezcal brands is much smaller than the
number of tequila brands. Here are a few:
 Gusano Rojo Mezcal
 Miguel de la Mezcal
 Monte Alban
Part II: Short Shots from American Whiskey to Wine 
98

Storing and Serving Suggestions
The traditional way to drink straight tequila requires a little
coordination and a steady hand. Place salt on the web of the
hand between your thumb and forefinger. Hold a wedge of
lime or lemon with the same two fingers and have a 1-ounce
shot glass filled with tequila in the other hand. In one quick
continuous motion, lick the salt, drink the tequila, and bite the
lime or lemon wedge.
Tequila also appears in many popular cocktails, including the
Margarita.
You drink mezcal straight, without the salt or citrus. Some
folks drink it with a dram of water, but not in Mexico.
An opened bottle of tequila or mezcal has a shelf life of many
years if kept in a cool, dry place.

odka, a clear, almost flavorless spirit, is usually thought
of as the national spirit of Russia and other Slavic coun-
tries. Both Russia and Poland claim the invention of vodka
and explain that the name is a diminutive of the word voda,
meaning little water. Slavic countries have been producing
vodka for more than 600 years.
How Vodka Is Made
Vodka was originally distilled only from potatoes, but today,
it’s also made from grain, mostly wheat, rye, and corn. But 
distillers don’t seem at all hindered by tradition — in Turkey,
they use beets! Vodkas are distilled at a very high proof (190
or higher), and most are filtered through activated charcoal.
Certain charcoals are so important to the making of vodka
that distillers patent them. High-end vodkas are triple- and
even quadruple-distilled, and some are filtered through fine
quartz sand.

Popular Brands
Vodka is now produced in almost every country in the world,
and each location tends to put its spin on the classic. You may
want to sample some of the following brands to see whether
you can find differences:
 Absolut: From Sweden.
 Belvedere: From Poland.
 Boru: Made in Ireland from grain and pure Irish water.
 Chopin: From Poland; made with potatoes.
 Ciroc: Made from snap-frost grapes in southwestern

How that Russian drink got going 
in the United States
American John Martin of Heublein & Co. is credited with encouraging
Americans to drink vodka. In the summer of 1946, he and his friend Jack Morgan,
the owner of the Cock ‘n Bull Restaurant in Los Angeles, were discussing his
Smirnoff Vodka when Jack remembered that he had an overstock of ginger beer.
Jack and John mixed the two, added a dash of lime juice, and thus created the
Moscow Mule. It spread rapidly, promoted by Heublein (“It leaves you breath-
less!”), who had it served in a copper mug. Smirnoff Vodka was in high demand
and is still the number-one-selling vodka in the United States.

Flavored Vodkas
Flavored vodkas, which have become quite popular, are made
with the addition of natural flavoring ingredients. More than
30 different flavored vodkas are available, from cranberry
to zubowka. (Once sold with a single blade of grass in each
bottle, zubowka is no longer available with grass in the
United States, as some believed the grass contained a toxic
compound, but you can still get it sans flora.) The following is
a list of some of the most popular flavored vodkas. Rest assured
that more will be available as time goes by and more fruit falls
off a tree.
 Absolut Apeach: A sophisticated taste of peach.
 Absolut Citron: A lemon theme with subtle hints of lime,
mandarin orange, and grapefruit.
.
 Absolut Mandrin: A fruity taste of orange and mandarins.
 Absolut Peppar: A jalapeño-pepper-and-paprika-flavored
vodka.
 Absolut Raspberri: A taste of ripened raspberries.
 Absolut Ruby Red: A pleasant taste of natural grapefruits.
 Absolut Vanilia: A rich vanilla-flavored vodka.

Storing and Serving Vodka
Store at least one bottle in the freezer or refrigerator. It won’t
freeze because of the high alcohol content. Vodka should be
served neat or straight-up in a small cordial glass, especially
with caviar, smoked fish, salmon, sardines, steak tartare, and
spicy foods.
Vodka is one of the most mixable and versatile of spirits and is
used in hundreds of cocktail recipes. When an opened bottle
is refrigerated or stored in a cool, dry place, it should last up
to three years.

W
ine, as most of you know, is made from fermented
grapes. It comes in red, white, or rosé (pink or blush)
varieties. Winemaking dates back to roughly 3000 B.C., and it’s
here to stay.
Wines from Around the World
Climate is a big factor in making good wine. To grow wine-
worthy grapes, summers can’t be too hot and autumns need
to be cool. Light rainfall is necessary in the winter and spring,
and the rain needs to taper off in the summer and fall. Harsh,
cold winters with hail, frost, and heavy winds are bad for
growing grapes.
The type of grape determines the type of wine, and only cer-
tain types of grapes grow in certain climates. To make matters
even more complicated, the soil of a particular region plays a
big role in how its grapes will turn out. So while the climate in
certain regions of California and France may be perfect for,
say, chardonnay grapes, the soil in those regions affects the
grapes to the point that the resulting wines from each region
are different.

Many wines receive their names from the grape from which
they’re produced. See the following list of some popular wines
named after grapes:
 Barbera (red): Italy
 Cabernet Sauvignon (red): France, United States
 Chardonnay (white): France, United States, Argentina,
Australia, South America
 Chenin Blanc (white): France, United States
 Camay (red): France, United States
 Gewurztraminer (white): Germany
 Grenache (rosé): France, United States
 Merlot (red): France, United States, South America
 Pinot Noir (red): France, United States
 Reisling (white): Germany, United States, France
 Sauvignon Blanc (white): France, United States
 Semillon (white): France, United States, Australia
 Zinfandel (red and white): United States
Some popular French wines are as follows. They’re named
after the region of France from which they originate.
 Alsace (white)
 Beaujolais (red) from Burgundy
 Bordeaux (red and white)
 Burgundy (red and white)
 Rhône (red)
 Sauterne (white) from Bordeaux
The following is a list of some German wines that are worth
noting (all are white):
 Gewurztraminer
 Johannisberg Riesling
 Spalleseen

Italy produces all kinds of regional wines:
 Barbera (red) from Piedmont
 Barbaresco (red) from Piedmont
 Bardolino (red) from Veneto
 Barolo (red) from Piedmont
 Chianti (red) from Tuscany
 Orvieto (white) from Umbria
 Pinot Grigio (white) from Trentino
 Riserva (red) from Tuscany
 Soave (white) from Veneto
 Valpolicella (red) from Veneto
Australia’s wines are growing in popularity. Here are the
names of just a few:
 Grange (red)
 Grenache (red)
 Semillon (white)
 Shiraz (red)
 Syrah (red)
Some South American wines include
 Chandonnay (white)
 Malbec (red) Argentina
 Merlot (red) Chile
 Torrontes (white) Argentina
In the United States, California produces 90 percent of all wine.
Most California wine comes from Napa or Sonoma Valley, and
they produce both red and white wines in varieties too numer-
ous to list.
Chapter 16: Wine 109

Port
Port is a sweet fortified wine to which brandy has been
added. It’s named for Oporto — a city in northern Portugal.
It’s made from grapes grown in some 72,000 acres of vineyards
in a designated area along the Douro River, known as the Alto
Douro.
Although many wines are sold as port throughout the world,
authentic port wine is the unique product of Portugal. By law,
it must be made only from approved grape varieties native
to the Alto Douro district and grown nowhere else in the 
country.
Fortification with brandy gives port extra strength and, more
importantly, preserves the fresh flavor of grapes that makes
port so delicious.
Port comes in three varieties:
 Ruby: Dark in color and fairly sweet.
 Tawny: Lighter in color and drier because it’s aged in
casks longer.
 Vintage port: Released only in certain exceptional years;
the fullest and sweetest of all ports.
The following are some popular brands:
 Cockburn’s
 Croft
 Royal Oporto
 Sandeman
Port is a great after-dinner drink. It also goes well with cheese
and cigars. An opened bottle of port has a shelf life of four to
six months.

Sherry
The English discovered the wines of Jerez, Spain, calling them
jerries, and the word later evolved into sherry. Sherry is a for-
tified wine to which grape brandy has been added. No longer
limited to production in Spain, sherry is now produced all
over the world.
There are five basic styles of sherry:
 Fino: Light and very dry, usually served chilled as an
apéritif.
 Manzanilla: Pale, dry, and light-bodied, also served
chilled as an apéritif.
 Amotillanda: Medium dry and full-bodied; perfect
between meals or with soup and cheese.
 Oloroso: Gold in color with a strong bouquet; more
hardy than Amotillanda.
 Cream: A smooth, sweet wine. Cream sherry is the result
when Oloroso is blended with a sweetening wine, such as
Moscatel. Cream is the largest-selling sherry. It can be
served at any time, chilled or over ice.
The following are popular sherry brands:
 Dry Sack
 Gonzalez Byass
 Harvey’s Bristol Cream
 Savory and James
Sparkling Wines
A monk whose name is now familiar — Dom Perignon —
developed the first sparkling wine in the 1600s in the
Champagne region of France. Without going into the details,
he developed a method of bottling wine so that carbon diox-
ide, a product of fermentation, remains in the bottle with the
wine, and the result is the presence of bubbles.
Chapter 16: Wine 111

Sparkling wine made in the Champagne region of France is
called, of course, champagne. It is made with a mix of different
grapes (including pinot noir, pinot meunier, and chardonnay)
through a process called méthod champenoise, which is quite
costly and time-consuming. Sparkling wines from other places
in the world are made in different ways with different grapes.
But you can find sparkling wines from places such as California
that are made using the méthod champenoise.
Champagne and other sparkling wines should be stored in a
cool, dark place away from heat, light, vibrations, and severe
temperature variations. Unlike the best wines from Bordeaux
or California, sparkling wines are ready for consumption when
they’re shipped to the market. However, some wine-lovers
also enjoy cellaring their champagnes for a few extra years.
Before serving, chill the wine well, but don’t freeze it.
Placing the bottle in a bucket filled with ice and water for
30 to 40 minutes is the best way to chill champagne. You can
also chill a bottle by refrigerating it for several hours, but
don’t keep bottles in the fridge for extended periods of time.
The excessive cold and the vibration of the motor will cause
the flavor to go a little flat.
Champagne is best served in tall flute or tulip glasses at a
temperature of 42 to 47 degrees Fahrenheit. Tiny bubbles
will rise in a continuous stream. When serving, pour a small
quantity of champagne into each glass and allow it to settle.
Then fill each glass two-thirds full.
For much more information on how to buy and serve cham-
pagne, check out Champagne For Dummies by Ed McCarthy
(Wiley).
Vermouth
Vermouth originated in the 18th century when wine growers in
the foothills of the French and Italian Alps developed a method
of enhancing the taste of sour or uncompromising wines with
the infusion of a variety of sweeteners, spices, herbs, roots,
seeds, flowers, and peels. Just a few of the herbs and spices
used to flavor and aromatize the wine include cloves, bitter
orange peel, nutmeg, gentian, camomile, and wormwood,
which in German is wermut, from which vermouth got its
Part II: Short Shots from American Whiskey to Wine 
112

name. Once flavored, the wine is clarified, pasteurized, and
finally fortified to an alcoholic content of about 18 percent,
close to that of sherry.
The standard classification of vermouth is white/dry and
red/sweet, but exceptions do exist, including a half-sweet 
variety known as rosé. And while most dry vermouths are
considered French and sweet vermouths considered Italian,
both types are produced in France and Italy as well as
throughout the world, including in the United States.
Vermouth is an ingredient in many cocktails, and just as 
carefully as you select other liquor to pour at the bar, so
you should take care and time in selecting a good vermouth.
Choose the brand of vermouth that tastes best to you — crisp
and light, not too heavy or burnt. Check out the following list
of popular brands:
 Boissiere
 Cinzano
 Martini and Rossi
 Noilly Prat
 Stock
You need to refrigerate a bottle of vermouth after opening.
The shelf life of an opened bottle, when refrigerated, is
approximately one year.
One Final Word on Wines
I haven’t said nearly as much about wine as I would like. The
fact is, people have written whole books on single types of
wine, so it’s sort of foolish for me to even pretend to give a
comprehensive overview in a single chapter. The focus of this
book, after all, is cocktail recipes.
A great introduction to buying, serving, and drinking wine is
Wine For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Ed McCarthy, Mary Ewing-
Mulligan, and Piero Antinori (Wiley). It’s full of useful and
interesting information, and it makes a great companion to
this book.

You probably bought this book just for this chapter, which

classic drinks that you’ve probably heard of; others are new
and trendy. Most are quite good; some are strange concoc-
tions that few people like.
This cute little icon to the right of the drink name indicates a

Why combine champagne and stout?
In 1861, mourning the death of Prince Albert, a steward at the Brookes’s Club in
London, England, decided that the champagne should also be in mourning, so
he mixed it with Guinness to create Black Velvet. This drink became very pop-
ular and was the favorite of Prince Otto Von Bismarck of Germany (1815–98).

Cuba Libre Lore
This drink is a political statement as well as a cocktail. It translates to Free Cuba,
a status that the country enjoyed in 1898 at the end of the Spanish-American
War. Cuban-American relations were friendly around the turn of the century,
when a U.S. Army lieutenant in Havana mixed some light native rum with a new-
fangled American soft drink called Coca-Cola and braced the libation with a
lime.

The origins of the French 75
If you request this drink, you might receive a mix of gin and champagne. In the
French trenches of World War I gin was scarce, but cognac and champagne
were not. American soldiers soon discovered that a combination of the two
produced an effect similar to getting zapped by an artillery piece known as
French 75.

What twisted genius created
Long Island Iced Tea?
This drink does hail from Long Island, specifically the Oak Beach Inn in
Hampton Bays. Spirits writer John Mariani credits bartender Robert (Rosebud)
Butt as the inventor, whose original recipe called for an ounce each of clear
liquors (vodka, gin, tequila, light rum), a half ounce of triple sec, some lemon
juice, and a splash of cola.
This drink comes in many forms and is still popular with young drinkers, though
not with those who have to get up early the next day.

Mai Tai: Out of this world
Vic Bergeron invented the Mai Tai in 1944 at his Polynesian-style Oakland bar.
He didn’t want fruit juices detracting from the two ounces of J. Wray Nephew
Jamaican rum he poured as the base for his creation. He merely added a half
ounce of French orgeat (an almond-flavored syrup), a half ounce of orange cura-
cao, a quarter ounce of rock candy syrup, and the juice of one lime. Customer
Carrie Wright of Tahiti, the first to taste the concoction, responded, “Mai tai . . .
roe ae!” (Tahitian for “Out of this world . . . the best!”)
The Mai Tai became famous, and conflicting stories about its origins aggra-
vated Bergeron so much that he elicited a sworn statement from Mrs. Wright
in 1970, testifying to his authorship of the cocktail.

Manhattan
The Manhattan recipe was created around 1874 at the Manhattan Club, New

quet in honor of the lawyer and politician Samuel J. Tilden at the time.
The Margarita: Behind every great
drink is . . .
Using her two favorite spirits, cointreau and tequila, Margarita Sames
invented this classic drink in 1948 in Acapulco, Mexico. Presenting his wife
with glassware etched with Margarita!, her husband gave the drink its name.

Martini mythology
You’re likely to hear several stories about the creation of the martini, such as
the few that follow: 
 A stranger on his way to Martinez, California, told bartender Jerry Thomas
of San Francisco, California, about this drink made with gin, vermouth, bit-
ters, and dash of maraschino.
 A bartender in Martinez, California, created it for a goldminer who struck
it rich: The miner ordered champagne for the house, but none was avail-
able. The bartender offered something better — a Martinez Special —
some sauterne and gin. The rich miner spread the word throughout
California about this Martinez Special.
 The drink is named after Martini & Rossi vermouth because it was first
used in the drink, Gin and It, which contains Gin and Martini & Rossi 
vermouth.
 The drink is named after the British army rifle, the Martini and Henry. The
rifle was known for its kick, like the first sip of Gin and It.
 At the Knickerbocker Hotel in the early 1900s, a bartender named Martini
di Arma Tiggia mixed a martini using only a dry gin and dry vermouth.

The ori-gins of Pink Gin
In 1824, Dr. Johan G. B. Siegert created Angostura bitters as a remedy for 
stomach complaints suffered by the Venezuelan army. He named this concoction
after the town on the Orinoco River where he had worked.
The British Navy added this product to its medicine chest but soon discovered
that it added a whole new dimension to Plymouth gin, and thus Pink Gin came
to be.

The lowdown on the White Lady
Harry MacElhone created the White Lady in 1919 at Ciro’s Club in London,
England. In 1923, he took over a bar in Rue Daunou, Paris, renaming it Harry’s
New York Bar. In 1929, using gin in place of white crème de menthe, he altered
the original White Lady recipe, and this concoction became a worldwide
favorite.

“Martini” Madness
In This Chapter
 Following the latest trend
 Mixing a few martinis
W
hat’s with all the martinis these days? I get new recipes
submitted to me all the time, and every day I hear
about these trendy new martinis that look like nothing more
than pink Kool-Aid in a dressed-up cocktail glass.
The truth of the matter is that a real martini is simply a couple
ounces of ice-cold gin (or vodka if gin isn’t your thing) with a
dash of vermouth. Some people like more or less vermouth
than others (or none at all), and some people prefer an olive
or a twist of lemon or even a pearl onion for a garnish. But
that’s really about it when it comes to martini variations as far
as I’m concerned.
Ultimately, the martinis in this chapter are just cocktails like
any other, but they’re called martinis because they’re served
in a martini glass. It’s trendy. In a few years, something else
will be trendy. At one time, people drank cocktails with raw
eggs in them because they were popular. Tab and Fresca used
to be popular. In five years, something else will be popular.
What are you gonna do?
So anyway, I tried to pick out around 30 interesting or trendy
“martinis” that actually taste good and are worth drinking.
Enjoy.

Punches
In This Chapter
 Getting a little background
 Sampling several recipes
P
unch may have come from the word puncheon, a cast
made to hold liquids, such as beer. The word may also
have come from the Hindu word pantsh, which means five.
What does five have to do with anything? British expatriates
in India in the 17th century made a beverage consisting of five
ingredients: tea, water, sugar, lemon juice, and a fermented
sap called arrack.
Regardless of the history or origin, punches of all kinds are
an expected beverage at many of today’s social gatherings.
Whether you’re an aspiring bartender or just someone
who wants to be a good host (and the life of the party),
you need to have at least a few of the following punches

The Part of Tens

C

and hangovers. Chapter 22 lists many more than
ten bartending-related Web sites and other resources.

Chapter 21
At Least Ten Cures 
and Lores
In This Chapter
 Getting rid of your hiccups
 What to do if you have a hangover
P
art of being a bartender is settling arguments, mending
broken hearts, and curing two primary medicinal prob-
lems: hiccups and hangovers.
Hiccups
The rapid closure of the vocal cords that follows the involun-
tary contraction of the diaphragm causes hiccups. (When you
put it this way, hiccups don’t seem nearly as embarrassing as
most people consider them.) See the list of cures that follows:
 Slice a lemon and remove the pits. Top the slices with
sugar and Angostura bitters and eat the whole thing.
This is the sure cure.
 Mix Angostura bitters and club soda and sip slowly.
 Drink a glass of water backwards. This can be a really
wet cure!
 Hold your nose and breathe through your mouth. Then
count to 10 or 20 or count to 100 to be certain.
 Blow into a paper bag.

Hangovers
Cause: Take a guess.
Cures: Only a few cures really work:
 A little prevention: Don’t overindulge or let yourself be
overserved. (Someone told me once that even in modera-
tion, I am excessive.)
 Sleep. Drink plenty of fluids (water-based, not alcohol-
based). Get some peace and quiet.
Consider a few more possible cures:
 Drink two ounces Fernet Branca or Fernet Branca Menta
(Italian digestives) on the rocks.
 Drink one small bottle of Underberg (a German digestive).
 From my friends in Puerto Rico (Gere and Linda), rub a
half of a lemon under each armpit!
 Drink a bottle of flat beer left out open overnight.
 Hair of the Dog: One shot of whatever you were drinking!
