Preface
The past decades have witnessed various applications of systems engineering
methodologies to urban planning, economic models, power systems, industrial pro-
cesses, transportation networks, and others. Due to economic factors and socio-
political constraints, a fundamental constituent of these applications is frequently
described by the following attributes: multidimensional, highly interacting, and
complex models. Several approaches have been developed [2–4, 6, 11, 14] to deal
with these models with the intention of reducing some measure of complexity in
the course of analysis and design. Concepts and key ideas from economics, man-
agement science, and operation research have been exploited successfully and gen-
eralized in a dynamic framework. These continuous efforts systematically establish
a body of theories pertaining to interconnected systems (ICS). The voluminous lit-
erature on theories and applications of large-scale systems (LSS), interconnected
systems (ICS) or complex dynamical systems (CDS) includes survey articles and
textbooks and monographs [1, 3, 5] and [7–13].
Throughout this book and in view of our technical experience, we will adopt
decentralized systems (DS) as the most convenient designation for LSS, ICS or CDS
since the common denominator in these systems is to deploy decentralization in the
analysis, control, ﬁltering and processing tasks. Equivalently stated, the effort of any
task is essentially distributed among various units who are cooperating to achieve
the desired objective.
It is often true that a book is developed through a long tour that consists of many
tiny steps and interactions with many people. While the major idea of writing a
book on decentralized systems has been in the back of my mind for quite long time,
the thrust behind this volume started in July 2009 when I met with Oliver Jackson
during the Systems and Control Conference in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It has been
a good opportunity to start a fruitful communication channel that ended with writing
the present book.
Over the past decades it was highly interesting and extensive activity to watch and
interact with the global scientiﬁc/engineering development of decentralized systems
leading to thousands of papers published and/or talks presented in journals and con-
ferences about various related aspects. This book is basically an outgrowth of my

Preface
academic research work and postgraduate teaching activities. It provides an in-depth
treatment to problems of interconnected systems which some requirements are im-
posed in the course of analysis and/or design.
In engineering and economic organizations, one can easily recognize the pres-
ence of several decision makers (DMs) that
1. generate decisions and control variables by acting on the same system,
2. have access to different information coming from the controlled system and
3. pursue different goals.
Such organizations are addressed in the wide research area called “game theory.”
For the purpose of uniformity, we will adopt the following deﬁnition of an in-
terconnected system throughout this book: a dynamical system which contains a
number of interdependent constituents which serve particular functions, share re-
sources, and are governed by a set of interrelated goals and constraints.
It is manifested that “complexity” is an essential and dominating problem in
systems theory and practice. It leads to severe difﬁculties that are encountered in
the tasks of analyzing, designing, and implementing appropriate control strategies
and algorithms. With focus on the control design goal, these difﬁculties arise mainly
from the underlying multi-modes of operation and gain perturbations, which from
now onwards we term them as design constraints. Given the advanced development
in robust control and time-delay theories, we treat uncertain time-delay systems as
basic module in our subsequent analysis.
From this perspective, the notion of DS introduced in the context of control engi-
neering problems arose when it became clear that there are real world control prob-
lems that cannot be solved by using conventional approaches. Such typical problems
arise in the control of interconnected power systems with strong interactions, water
systems which are widely distributed in space, trafﬁc systems with many external
signal, or large-space ﬂexible structures. These problems recall for new ideas for
dividing the analysis and synthesis of the overall system into independent or almost
independent subproblems, for dealing with the incomplete information about the
system, for coping with the uncertainties and for dealing with time-delays.
This book is written about recent advances in decentralized systems theories
and methods with design constraints. It aims at providing a rigorous framework
for studying analysis, stability and control problems of DS while addressing the
dominating sources of design constraints. The primary objective is to focus on ro-
bust decentralized methods based on linear matrix inequalities framework while
tacking into consideration possible design considerations and/or constraints. Such
constraints include the presence of quantizers, nonlinear/overﬂow elements, en-
coder/decoder and networks.
The main features of the book are:
(I) It provides key concepts of decentralized systems with their proofs followed
by efﬁcient computational method;
(II) It establishes decentralized control techniques under design constraints; and
(III) It gives some representative applications.

Acknowledgements
In my academic career, I have beneﬁted from listening, discussing, collaborating
with several colleagues across the globe. Therefore, the various topics discussed in
this book have constituted an integral part of my academic research investigations
over the past several years. In writing this volume, I took the approach of referring
within the text to papers and/or books from which I learned some concepts, ideas
and methods. I further complemented this by adding some remarks and notes within
and at the end of each chapter to shed some light on other related results. I apologize
in advance in case I committed injustice and assure all of the colleagues that any
mistake was deﬁnitely unintentional.
This book is intended for graduate students and researchers in control systems
design including robust, reliable and resilient methods with the hope to provide a
guided tour through decentralized systems (DS) results and a source of new research
problems. I had the privilege of teaching graduate courses on decentralized control,
large-scale systems and hierarchical systems at different institutions including Cairo
University (Egypt), University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology
(UK), Kuwait University (Kuwait), KFUPM (Saudi Arabia). The course notes, up-
dated and expanded over years, were instrumental in generating different chapters
of this book and valuable comments and suggestions as well as several detailed cri-
tiques made by graduate students were greatly helpful. For the development of the
book, I am immensely pleased for many stimulating discussions and interactions
with colleagues, students and friends world-wide which have deﬁnitely enriched
my knowledge and experience. Most of all however, I would like to express my
deepest gratitude to all members of my family and especially my wife Salwa for her
elegant style and compassion. Without their constant devotion, incredible amount of
patience and (mostly) generous support this volume would not have been ﬁnished.
I would appreciate any comments, questions, criticisms, or corrections that read-
ers may take the trouble of communicating to me at msmahmoud@kfupm.edu.sa or
magdim@yahoo.com.

Chapter 1
Introduction
The book covers some of the past and present results pertaining to the area of large-
scale, interconnected or complex systems. An emphasis is laid on decentralization,
decomposition, and robustness. These methodologies serve as effective tools to
overcome speciﬁc difﬁculties arising in large-scale complex systems such as high
dimensionality, information structure constraints, uncertainty, and delays. Several
prospective topics for future research are introduced in this contents. The subse-
quent chapters are focused on recent decomposition approaches in interconnected
dynamic systems due to their potential in providing the extension of decentralized
control into networked control systems.
1.1 Introduction
The past several decades have witnessed an increasing amount of attention paid to
the general subject area of large-scale systems. This comes quite naturally from
the relatively rapid growth of our societal needs which often result in multidimen-
sional, highly interacting, complex systems which are frequently stochastic in na-
ture. Though the existence of large-scale systems as objects for understanding and
management is repeatedly afﬁrmed, there has yet been proposed no precise deﬁni-
tion for largeness nor generally acceptable quantitative measures of scale. From the
viewpoint of developing analytical models, a system is large when its input-output
behavior cannot be understood without curtailing it, partitioning it into modules,
and/or aggregating its modularized subsystems. On the other hand, from a systems
viewpoint, a system is large if it exceeds the capacity of a single control struc-
ture. Thus one can enumerate several viewpoints regarding scale. The deﬁnition of
a large-scale system we will adopt here is a system which contains a number of in-
terdependent constituents which serve particular functions, share resources, and are
governed by a set of interrelated goals and constraints [9].
Motivated by the prominent structural aspects of an organization and some facets
from the area of automation and control of complex industrial systems and general

Introduction
man made communication problems, theoretical investigations were conducted at
the Systems Research Center of Case Western Reserve University starting about
1961. The overall goal was to develop a conceptual framework to the mathemati-
cal theory of complex multi goal decision making systems. Basically, the main idea
behind this approach is the recognition of the hierarchical order in living systems
as well as many existing physical systems. In fact, this approach takes the position
that for a mathematical theory to claim to be dealing with large-scale complex sys-
tems, the complexity of the real systems must be reﬂected in the structure of the
model [7].
Although there is no universal deﬁnition of a large-scale system, it is commonly
accepted that such systems possess the following characteristics [5]:
1. Large-scale systems are often controlled by more than one controller or decision
maker involving “decentralized” computations,
2. The controllers have different but correlated “information” available to them,
possibly at different times,
3. Large-scale systems can also be controlled by local controllers at one level whose
control actions are being coordinated at another level in a “hierarchical” (multi-
level) structure,
4. Large-scale systems are usually represented by imprecise “aggregate” models,
5. Controllers may operate in a group as a “team” or in a “conﬂicting” manner with
single- or multiple-objective or even conﬂicting-objective functions, and
6. Large-scale systems may be satisfactorily optimized by means of suboptimal or
near-optimum controls, sometimes termed a “satisfying” strategy.
1.2 Feedback Control
At ﬁrst sight, feedback control of large-scale systems poses the ‘classical’ control
problem: for a given process with control input u(t) and observed output y(t) ﬁnd
a controller that ensures closed-loop stability and asymptotic regulation and assigns
the loop a suitable input-output (I/O) behavior. This problem is usually solved in
two steps [6]:
1. The design phase: for a given model of the plant and expected classes of distur-
bances d(t) and command signals v(t) a control law
uc(t) = K(y(t) −v(t))
is chosen which satisﬁes the speciﬁcations given for the closed-loop system.
2. The execution phase: a controller with the control law uc(t) is applied to the pro-
cess, that is at every instant of time t the observed signal y(t) and the command
v(t) are combined according to the control law in order to determine the control
input uc(t).
This well-known control problem has been treated by classical and modern con-
trol theory under the crucial assumptions that there is a unique plant with a unique

1.2

controller and that all computations are based on the whole information about the
plant. This means that the design problem is solved for a model that describes the
process as a whole. In this case, the controller receives all sensor data available and
determines all input signals of the plant. In other words, there is unit thought of as
a centralized decision maker in charge of all information available for a single unit
that designs and applies the controller to the plant. Hence, multivariable control the-
ory deals with the centralized design of centralized controllers. Obviously, such an
assumption can hardly be satisﬁed if modern technological or societal systems have
to be controlled.
Practical control technologies rely on the cooperation of many different opera-
tional units or transportation systems and all their parts are linked by common re-
sources, by material ﬂows or through information networks. Consequently, neither
a complete model (a priori information) nor a complete set of measurement data
(a posteriori information) can be made available for a centralized decision maker.
For reliability considerations, the overall design problem has to be broken down
into different, albeit coupled, subproblems. As a result, the overall plant is no longer
controlled by a single controller but by several independent controllers, which are
called control stations and which all together represent a decentralized controller.
These control stations are no longer designed simultaneously on the basis of a com-
plete knowledge of the plant, but in different design steps by means of models that
describe only the relevant parts of the plant.
This fundamental difference between feedback control of ‘small’ and ‘large’
systems is usually described by the idea of information structure. The information
structure describes the way in which a priori and a posteriori information is trans-
ferred among decision-making units.
1.2.1 Information Structure
One of the major issues that manifests large-scale systems is the role governed by
the idea of information structure. Initially, in case of centralized systems, refer to
Fig. 1.2, the basic feedback problem is to ﬁnd control input vector u(·) on the ba-
sis of the a priori knowledge of the plant S described by its design model in the
presence of a class of disturbances v(·) and the control goal given in the form of
the design requirements {C} and the a posteriori information about the outputs y(·)
and the command signals r(·). Classical information structure corresponds to cen-
tralized control as illustrated by Fig. 1.1. It is important to note that the controller
receives all sensor data available and determines all input signals of the plant. In
other words, all information is assumed to be available for a single unit that designs
and applies the controller to the plant.
In present-day technologies where several
different units are coexist side by side, neither a complete model (a priori informa-
tion) nor a complete set of measurement data (a posteriori information) can be made
available for a centralized decision maker. Instead, the overall design problem has to
be broken down into different, albeit coupled, subproblems. As a result, the overall

plant is no longer controlled by a single controller but by several independent con-
trollers constituting a decentralized controller structure. Moreover, these controllers
are no longer designed simultaneously on the basis of a complete knowledge of the
plant, but in different design steps by means of models that describe only the rel-
evant parts of the plant. This amounts to non-classical information structure which
arises in decentralized design schemes as shown in Fig. 1.2.
1.2.2 System Representation
There are available two main structures of the models of large-scale systems dis-
tinguished by the degree to which they reﬂect the internal structure of the overall
dynamic system. These structures are called multi-channel systems entailing the
presence of multi-controllers and interconnected systems incorporating coordinated

controllers as illustrated in Figs. 1.3 and 1.4. In multi-channel systems, the associ-
ated input and output vectors are decomposed into subvectors constituting ns chan-
nels, while the system is considered as one whole. More on this type of systems will
be mentioned in later chapters.
1.2.3 Team Problems
In engineering and economic organizations, there may be several decision makers
(DMs) that
(A) generate decisions and control variables by acting on the same system;
(B) have access to different information coming from the controlled system; and
(C) pursue different goals.
Such organizations are addressed in the wide research area called “game theory”.
As to point (C), if all the decision makers cooperate on the accomplishment of a
common goal, the organization becomes a team and the related optimization prob-
lems are named team optimal control problems [4].

1.2.4 General Methodologies
Interconnected systems operate with interactions among subsystems. They are rep-
resented by signals through which subsystems interact among themselves. These
signal are internal signals of the overall system.
To cope with the aforementioned appearance of the complexity issues, several
general methodologies have been and are being elaborated. Most of them belong to
one of the following three groups [8]:
1. Model simpliﬁcation,
2. Decomposition,
3. Decentralization
The idea of model simpliﬁcation is to come up with a reasonable model that pre-
serves or inherits most of the main trends (features or dominant modes) of the orig-
inal large-scale/complex system, see [1–3, 5, 8] for further elaboration. The decom-
position (tearing) process amounts to generating a group of subsystems (smaller
in size) from the original large-scale/complex system. This could be achieved for
numerical purposes or along the boundaries of coupled units. In turns out that de-
composition is only a part of two-step procedure, the second of which is coordi-
nation (recomposing) which amounts to synthesizing the overall solution from the
generated solutions of the subsystems (subsolutions). There are two aspects of de-
centralization: the ﬁrst issue is concerned with the information structure inherent in
the solution of the given control problem and refers to the subdivision of the pro-
cess in terms of the model and the design goals. The other issue is associated with
on-line information about the state and the command to generate the decentralized
control law. The net result is that a completely independent implementation of the
controllers is made viable. There is a variety of different motivating reasons for the
decentralization of the design process such as weak coupling of subsystems, sub-
systems have contradictory goals, subsystems are assigned to different authorities,
or the high dimensionality of the overall system. Following [6], the principal ways
of decentralizing the design tasks belong to two groups: decentralized design for
strongly coupled subsystems and decentralized design for weakly coupled subsys-
tems.
The decentralized design for strongly coupled subsystems means that at least an
approximate model of all other subsystems must be considered for the design of any
subsystem under the current design, while the coupling can be neglected during the
design of individual control stations when considering the decentralized design for
weakly coupled subsystems.
1.2.5 Hierarchical Systems
One of the fundamental approaches in dealing with large-scale static systems was
the idea of decomposition treated theoretically in mathematical programming by

treating large linear programming problems possessing special structures. The ob-
jective was to gain computational efﬁciency and design simpliﬁcation. There are
two basic approaches for dealing with such problems:
1. The coupled approach where the problem’s structure kept intact while taking
advantage of the structure to perform efﬁcient computations [4], and
2. The decoupled approach which divides the original system into a number of
subsystems involving certain values of parameters. Each subsystem is solved
independently for a ﬁxed value of the so-called “decoupling” parameter, whose
value is subsequently adjusted by a coordinator in an appropriate fashion so that
the subsystems resolve their problems and the solution to the original system is
obtained.
1.3 Outline of the Book
During the past several decades, there have been real world system applications for
which the associated control design problems cannot be solved by using one-shot
approaches. Typical applications arise in the areas of interconnected power sys-
tems with strong coupling ties among network elements, water systems which are
widely distributed in space, trafﬁc systems with many external signal, or large-space
ﬂexible structures with interacting modes. Models of such systems are frequently
complex in nature, multidimensional and/or composed of highly interacting subsys-
tems. Several approaches to deal with these systems have been developed based on
key ideas from economics, management sciences and operations research. Over the
years, such approaches have been dynamically evolved into a body of “large-scale
systems (LSS) theories”.
This book is written about large-scale systems theories. It aims at providing a
rigorous framework for studying analysis, stability and control problems of LSS
while addressing the dominating sources of difﬁculties due to: dimensionality; infor-
mation structure constraints; parametric uncertainty and time-delays. The primary
objective is three-fold: to review past methods and results from a contemporary
perspective, to examine presents trends and approaches and to provide future pos-
sibilities, focusing on robust, reliable and/or resilient decentralized design methods
based on linear matrix inequalities framework.
The main features of the book are:
1. It provide an overall assessment of the large-scale systems theories over the past
several decades,
2. It addresses several issues like model-order reduction, parametric uncertainties,
time-delays, control/estimator gain perturbations,
3. It presents key concepts with their proofs followed by efﬁcient computational
method,
4. It establishes decentralized control techniques for time-delay and delay-free sys-
tems, and
5. It gives some representative applications.

Introduction
1.3.1 Methodology
Throughout the book, our methodology in each chapter/section is composed of ﬁve-
steps:
• Mathematical Modeling in which we discuss the main ingredients of the state-
space model under consideration.
• Deﬁnitions and/or Assumptions—here we state the deﬁnitions and/or constraints
on the model variables to pave the way for subsequent analysis.
• Analysis and Examples—this signiﬁes the core of the respective sections and sub-
sections which contains some solved examples for illustration.
• Results which are provided most of the time in the form of theorems, lemmas and
corollaries.
• Remarks which are given to shed some light of the relevance of the developed
results vis-a-vis published work.
In the sequel, theorems (lemmas, corollaries) are keyed to chapters and stated in
italic font with bold titles, for example, Theorem 3.4 means Theorem 4 in Chap. 3
and so on. For convenience, we have provided an appropriate list of references cited
at the end of each chapter. Relevant notes and research issues are offered at the end
of each chapter for the purpose of stimulating the reader.
We hope that this way of articulating the information will attract the attention of
a wide-spectrum of readership.
1.3.2 Book Organization
The book is primarily intended for researchers and engineers in the system and con-
trol community. It can also serve as complementary reading for large-scale system
theory at the post-graduate level. The book is divided into nine chapters.
Chapter 1 provides an overview of the concepts and techniques of large-scale
dynamic systems and introduces the system description and motivation of the study.
Then it sets forth formal deﬁnitions pertaining to the scope and objectives of the
book.
Chapter 2 treats the ﬁrst part of decentralized control methods for some classes
of nonlinear interconnected dynamical systems.
Chapter 3 deals with the second part of decentralized control methods for some
classes of nonlinear interconnected dynamical systems.
Chapter 4 examines stabilization and feedback control of decentralized systems
using multi-controller structures.
Chapter 5 focuses on decentralized control in the presence of quantizers within
continuous-time and discrete-time systems switched. Once again, the analytical de-
velopment starts with time-delay systems then generates the ordinary systems as
important special cases.

Chapter 6 examines large-scale trafﬁc systems and identiﬁes their features. Ap-
propriate models are derived using continuous and discrete formalisms. Flexible
routing policies are derived under different operating conditions.
Chapter 7 considers large-scale systems with Markovian jumping parameters.
The analytical development deals with ordinary systems as well as time-delay sys-
tems.
Chapter 8 deals with decentralized adaptive control strategies of interconnected
systems.
Chapter 9 contains some relevant mathematical lemmas, basic algebraic inequal-
ities and standard stability theorems.
Throughout the book and seeking computational convenience, all the developed
results are cast in the format of family of LMIs. In writing up the different top-
ics, emphasis is primarily placed on major developments attained thus far and then
reference is made to other related work.
In summary, this book covers decentralized control for interconnected systems
under alternative design considerations which is supplemented with rigorous proofs
of closed-loop stability properties and simulation studies. The material contained
in this book not only organized to focus on the new developments in the analysis
and control methods for LSS, but it also integrates the impact of the design con-
straints like delay-factor, information structures, interaction pattern, quantization
and overﬂow, switching among multi-controllers. After an introductory chapter, it
is intended to divide the book into self-contained chapters with each chapter being
equipped with illustrative examples, problems and questions. Each chapter of the
book will be supplemented by an extended bibliography, appropriate appendices
and indexes. It is planned while organizing the material that this book would be ap-
propriate for use either as graduate-level textbook in applied mathematics as well as
different engineering disciplines (electrical, mechanical, civil, chemical, systems),
a good volume for independent study or a suitable reference for graduate-students,
practicing engineers, interested readers and researchers from wide-spectrum of en-
gineering disciplines, science and mathematics.

Chapter 2
Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems I
In this chapter, we examine decentralized control techniques for classes of nonlinear
interconnected systems. We identify classes for the system structure along with the
underlying assumptions and emphasize the information and design constraints. The
subsequent sections focus on a class of large-scale interconnected minimum-phase
nonlinear systems with parameter uncertainty and nonlinear interconnections. The
uncertain parameters are allowed to be time-varying and enter the systems nonlin-
early. The interconnections are bounded by nonlinear functions of states. The prob-
lem we address is to design a decentralized robust controller such that the closed-
loop large-scale interconnected nonlinear system is globally asymptotically stable
for all admissible uncertain parameters and interconnections. It is shown that de-
centralized global robust stabilization of the system can be achieved using a control
law obtained by a recursive design method together with an appropriate Lyapunov
function.
The problem of decentralized output-feedback tracking with disturbance atten-
uation is addressed for a new class of large-scale and minimum-phase nonlin-
ear systems. Common assumptions like matching and growth conditions are not
required for the underlying decentralized system with a diagonal structure. An
observer-based decentralized controller design is presented. The proposed decen-
tralized output-feedback laws achieve asymptotic tracking and internal Lagrange
stability when the disturbance inputs disappear, and, guarantee external stability in
the presence of disturbance inputs. These external stability properties include Son-
tag’s ISS and iISS conditions and standard L2-gain property.
2.1 Classes of Nonlinear Interconnected Systems
In what follows, we summarize the classes of nonlinear interconnected systems
(NIS) that will be treated in the subsequent sections. We focus on the features of
each class before addressing the topics of stability analysis and decentralized output-
feedback control design.

Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems I
2.1.1 Class I
In recent years, modern control methods have found their way into decentralized
design of interconnected systems leading to a wide variety of new concepts and re-
sults. This includes, but not limited to, the framework of H∞/H2 design and linear
matrix inequalities (LMIs) [1] which has been shown [6, 44] to be very attractive
particularly when coping with high dimensional systems. Applications having so-
phisticated theoretical generalizations of the underlying concepts have been in con-
trol of multi-agent systems, such as platoons of vehicles on highways and in the air,
interconnected spatially-invariant systems, and large-scale power systems [5–7]. It
turns out that, the decentralized control designs imply, either explicitly or implicitly,
that the system, with local feedback loops closed around the subsystems, remains
stable despite changes in its interconnection topology [4, 60, 66, 67].
2.1.1.1 System Description
According to this class, a nonlinear interconnected system S is considered to be
composed of a ﬁnite number N of subsystems represented by
Sj:
˙xj = Ajxj + Bjuj + hj(t,x),
(2.1)
yj = Cjxj,
where xj ∈ℜnj ,uj ∈ℜmj and yj ∈ℜpj are the subsystem state, input and output
vectors, respectively, x = [xt
1,...,xt
N]t is the global state vector with N
i=1 nj = n
and hj(t,x): ℜn+1 →ℜnj are piecewise continuous vector functions in both argu-
ments, satisfying in their domains of continuity the following quadratic inequalities

where

y = [yt

h(t,x) = [h1(t,x)t,...,hN(t,x)t]t
are the global input, output and interconnection vectors, respectively, with

then, it is always possible to ﬁnd matrices H,Γ such that

(2.4)
where
H = diag[H1,...,HN],

Remark 2.1 The main feature of this class is its suitability to develop an LMI-based
method for designing dynamic output feedback for robust decentralized stabiliza-
tion of interconnected systems. This scheme is selected as a methodological basis
for several reasons [55]. First, the method applies to systems composed of linear
subsystems coupled by nonlinear interconnections. This type of model is attractive
since, in most practical situations, local subsystem models are known with sufﬁ-
cient precision to make the linearization successful, while the interconnections are
largely unknown: only their bounds are available for control design. Second, the
scheme allows for maximization of interconnection bounds, and third, the result-
ing closed-loop system is connectively stable. Elaborations of the basic scheme in
[55] presented in the literature have been related either to the state feedback [55], or
to output feedback schemes containing an observer of Luenberger type [9, 46–54,
56–65, 67–89].
As will be shown later on that by assuming decentralized dynamic linear out-
put feedback with a general structure, we apply the classical methodology of H∞
controller design [6, 11, 24] to the basic scheme from [55]. As a result, a new two-
step LMI-based design procedure is obtained, providing at the ﬁrst step the block-
diagonal Lyapunov matrix, together with the robustness degree vector, and at the
second step the decentralized controller parameters.

Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems I
2.1.2 Class II
Large-scale systems, frequently consisting of a set of small-interconnected subsys-
tems, can be found in many applications such as electric power systems, indus-
trial manipulators, computer networks, to name a few. On one hand, the central-
ized control of these systems is usually infeasible mainly due to the requirement
of a formidable amount of information exchange. In this regard, decentralized con-
trol is often preferable [60] whereby a control law based only on local informa-
tion is designed and implemented. In view of the interconnections among subsys-
tems, the design of a decentralized control is in general more difﬁcult than that
of a centralized control. On the other hand, due to their complexity, exact model-
ing of large-scale systems is usually impossible. Therefore, it is of practical sig-
niﬁcance that decentralized control must reﬂect such design constraints by taking
into account possible modeling uncertainties. Usually, the uncertainties for inter-
connected systems appear not only in local subsystems but also in interconnec-
tions.
From the literature, decentralized robust control for interconnected linear sys-
tems with uncertainties satisfying the so-called strict matching conditions was in-
vestigated in [3, 17, 56] and references cited therein. The interconnections among
subsystems treated in these works are mostly bounded by ﬁrst-order polynomials.
It was pointed out in [13, 18, 38, 56] that interconnected systems with a decentral-
ized control based on the ﬁrst-order bounded interconnections may become unsta-
ble when the interconnections are of higher order. Decentralized robust stabiliza-
tion was considered in [20] for systems with interconnections bounded by some
nonlinear functions and uncertainties satisfying the so-called matching conditions.
Decentralized adaptive control for a class of interconnected nonlinear systems was
proposed in [22, 25] based on exact linearization by following the development of
centralized control of nonlinear systems [23, 32, 39] and where the strict matching
condition was relaxed and higher-order interconnections among subsystems were
introduced.
2.1.2.1 System Description
The second class of systems considered in this chapter looks at a large-scale non-
linear system as comprised of N interconnected subsystems with time-varying un-
known parameters and/or disturbances entering nonlinearly into the state equation.
The jth subsystem is given as
˙zj = fi0(zj,xj1) + gj0(zj, ¯xj0,Zj,Yj;θ)xj1,
˙xj1 = xj2 + gj1(zj, ¯xj1,Zj,Yj;θ),
˙xj2 = xj3 + gj2(zj, ¯xj2,Zj,Yj;θ),
...

˙xj,rj−1 = xj,rj + φj,rj−1(zj, ¯xj,rj −1,Zj,Yj;θ),
˙xj,rj = vj + φj,rj (zj, ¯xj,rj ,Zj,Yj;θ),
yj = xj1,
where ¯xj,k = [xj1 xj2 ... xjk]t with ¯xj0 = xj1,xj = ¯xjrj ,(zj,xj) is the state vector
of the jth subsystem with

N]t,
Yj = [y1 y2 ... yj−1 yj+1 ... yN]t
and vj ∈ℜis the control input, yj ∈ℜis the output, θ is a vector of unknown,
time-varying piecewise continuous parameters and/or disturbances which belong to
a known compact set Ω, the vector ﬁelds fj0 and φjk are smooth with fj0(0,0) = 0
and gjk(0,0,0,0;θ) = 0, ∀θ ∈Ω, 1 ≤j ≤N, 0 ≤j ≤rj. Observe that the vector
(gjk), k = 0,1,2,...,rj, represents the interconnections of the ith subsystem with
the other subsystems.
Remark 2.2 In what follows, we consider the decentralized robust control prob-
lem for a wider class of interconnected systems with partially feedback linearizable
subsystems and nonlinear parameterization of time-varying parametric uncertainty.
Observe from (2.5) that the interconnections involve the zero-dynamics and out-
puts of other subsystems. This is in contrast to [25] where an adaptive stabilization
was considered for a class of interconnected nonlinear systems whose subsystems
are exactly feedback linearizable and with linear parameterization of parameter un-
certainty. Geometrical conditions on the isolated subsystems and interconnections
such that the interconnected nonlinear systems are transformable into the so-called
decentralized strict feedback form has been characterized in [25].
Remark 2.3 Similar to the centralized case discussed in [35, 40], the zero dynamics
of each subsystem in (2.5) are independent of the uncertain parameter vector θ.
In the sequel, we assume that nj = n,rj = r,1 ≤j ≤N. Then, by considering
yj = xj1, system (2.5) becomes
˙zj = fj0(zj,xj1) + gj0(zj, ¯xi0,Zj,Xj1;θ)xj1,
˙xj1 = xj2 + gj1(zj, ¯xj1,Zj,Xj1;θ),
˙xj2 = xj3 + gj2(zj, ¯xj2,Zj,Xj1;θ),
(2.6)
...
˙xj,r−1 = xj,r + gj,r−1(zj, ¯xj,r−1,Zj,Xj1;θ),
˙xj,r = vj + gj,r(zj, ¯xj,r,Zj,Xj1;θ),
where Xj1 = Yj = [x11 x21 ...xj−1,1 xj+1,1 ... xN1]t.
The following assumptions are made for system (2.6).

Remark 2.4 By the well-known converse Lyapunov theorem [29, 31], the zero
dynamics of each subsystem are globally asymptotically stable if and only if
there exists a positive deﬁnite and proper Lyapunov function Vj0 such that
(∂Vj0/∂zj)fj0(zj,0) < 0, ∀zj ̸= 0. Indeed, the requirement (2.7) is more restric-
tive than this. However, a globally exponentially minimum-phase nonlinear system
(that is, the zero-dynamics of the system are globally exponentially stable) always
satisﬁes condition (2.7).
Remark 2.5 The interconnections in Assumption 2.2 are very general, including
many types of interconnections considered in existing literature as special cases,
for example, interconnections bounded by linear (ﬁrst-order) polynomials [3], and
higher-order polynomials [56]. By contrast to the work in [3, 20, 27, 56], no match-
ing conditions are imposed for system (2.6).
Later on, we will deal with the decentralized global robust stabilization prob-
lem for system (2.6) satisfying Assumptions 2.1 and 2.2. More precisely, we are
concerned with the design of decentralized robust control laws vj = vj(zj,xj),
j = 1,...,N, such that the overall closed-loop interconnected system (2.6) with
the control laws is globally asymptotically stable for all admissible uncertainties
and interconnections.

Classes of Nonlinear Interconnected Systems

2.1.3 Class III
Recent years have seen steady progress in the ﬁeld of decentralized control of both
linear and nonlinear systems. Decentralized control issues naturally arise from con-
trolling large complex systems found in the power industry, aerospace and chemi-
cal engineering applications, and telecommunication networks, to name only a few.
Among the main characteristics of decentralized control are the dramatic reduc-
tion of computational complexity and the enhancement of robustness and reliability
against interacting operation failures. Many researchers have made signiﬁcant con-
tributions to the development of decentralized control theory for large-scale, or in-
terconnected, dynamic systems ([60] and a rather complete list of earlier references
cited therein).
In Class III of this chapter, we study a broad class of large-scale nonlinear sys-
tems with output measurements. This problem, usually referred to as decentralized
output-feedback control, is technically challenging because of the lack of a general
theory for nonlinear observer design and the nonlinear version of the well-known
“Separation Principle”.
2.1.3.1 System Description
According to this Class III, a large-scale nonlinear system is viewed as comprised
of N interconnected subsystems with time-varying unknown parameters and/or dis-
turbances entering nonlinearly into the state equation. The jth subsystem is given
as
˙xj = Fj(xj) + Gj(xj)uj + Πj1(y1,...,yN)xj + Πj2(y1,...,yN)wj,
(2.9)
yj = hj(xj),
(2.10)
where 1 ≤j ≤N, xj ∈ℜnj , uj ∈ℜand yj ∈ℜrepresent the state, the single
control input and the single output of the local jth subsystem, respectively, and
wj ∈ℜnwj is the disturbance input. Also, Fj,Gj,hj,Λj1 and Πj2 are sufﬁciently
smooth functions. In the absence of the interacting terms Πj1 and Πj2, the sys-
tem (2.9)–(2.10) collapses to an isolated single-input single-output SISO system
and has been extensively studied in the recent literature. Various constructive con-
trol algorithms have been developed for large classes of centralized nonlinear sys-
tems in special normal forms. Similar questions in the decentralized context should
be addressed, that is, in the presence of strong interactions among local systems
of the form (2.9)–(2.10). In the sequel, attention is focused on large-scale dynamic
systems of type (2.9)–(2.10) transformable to
˙zj = Qjzj + fj0(y1,...,yN) + pj0(y1,...,yN)wj,
˙xj1 = xi2 + fj1(y1,...,yN) + gj1(y1,...,yN)zj + pj1(y1,...,yN)wj,
...
(2.11)

Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems I
˙xjnj = uj + fjnj (y1,...,yN) + gjnj (y1,...,yN)zj + pjnj (y1,...,yN)wj,
yj = xj1,
where for each 1 ≤j ≤N, zj ∈ℜnzj and xj = (xi1,...,xinj ) ∈ℜnj are the states of
the ith transformed subsystem. For every j, Qj is a constant matrix with appropriate
dimension, fjk, gjk and pij are known and smooth functions.
In the sequel, the following minimum-phase condition is assumed.
Condition A For every 1 ≤j ≤N,Qj is a Hurwitz matrix.
The structure involved in (2.11) is commonly utilized in the past literature in both
centralized and decentralized control, the reader is referred to [20, 23, 26, 32, 40,
48, 56, 80]. In view of the existing results on geometric nonlinear control [23, 29,
32, 40], necessary and sufﬁcient geometric conditions can be easily derived under
which a nonlinear system (2.9), (2.10) is transformed into (2.11), yielding the so-
called “disturbed decentralized output-feedback form”.
Remark 2.6 It is worth noting that the nonlinearities in (2.9) depend only on the out-
put y = (y1,...,yN) and that the unmeasured states Xj[zj,xj2,...,xjnj ] in (2.11)
appear linearly. This feature is found appealing in recent studies in global output-
feedback control for both centralized and decentralized nonlinear systems, in the
framework of robust and/or adaptive control. As a matter of fact, simple counterex-
amples found in [43] reveal the fundamental limitation of global output-feedback
control for systems with strong nonlinearities due to unmeasured states. For ex-
ample, it has been shown in [43] that there is no continuous (static or dynamic)
output-feedback control law that can globally asymptotically stabilize a nonlinear
system ˙x1 = x2, ˙x2 = xn
2 + u with output y = x1 whenever n ≥3.
2.2 Dynamic Output Feedback: Class I
The objective of this section is to propose an approach to robust stabilization of sys-
tems which are composed of linear subsystems coupled by nonlinear time-varying
interconnections satisfying quadratic constraints. The proposed algorithms, which
are formulated within the convex optimization framework, employ linear dynamic
feedback structure involving local Luenberger-type observers. It is also shown how
the new methodology can produce improved results if interconnections have linear
parts that are known a priori. Examples of output stabilization of inverted pendu-
lums and decentralized control of a platoon of vehicles are used to illustrate the
applicability of the design method.
With the emergence of the powerful convex optimization toolboxes involving
linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), solving problems of controller design within the
convex optimization framework became very attractive, see [1, 6, 10, 11, 14, 21,

2.2
Dynamic Output Feedback: Class I
19
24, 61]. Of wide-spread interest have been the control problems of formulating suf-
ﬁcient conditions for computing output feedback control laws using convex opti-
mization methods due to the fact that the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions are
known to be non convex, in general. These problems become increasingly more dif-
ﬁcult to solve when decentralized information structure constraints are imposed in
the control design [2, 15, 16, 49, 59, 83, 85]. These information structures can be
found in important applications, such as power systems [86], control of formations
of unmanned vehicles [65] and control of large structures [34], to name few.
2.2.1 Observer-Based Control Design
In what follows, we propose novel sufﬁcient conditions for the design of decentral-
ized dynamic output controllers in the convex optimization context for stabilization
of interconnected systems with linear subsystems and nonlinear time-varying in-
terconnections. Controllers are designed to guarantee robust stability of the overall
system and, in addition, maximize the bounds of unknown interconnection terms,
starting from the methodology proposed in [55]. In what follows, we adopt here
the controller structure containing local observers of Luenberger type. Several al-
gorithms are proposed in the general case of full order observers, differing by com-
plexity and the degree of interdependence between the observer and the feedback
gains, where no additional constraints on the parameters of the system model are
imposed [46, 58]. It is also shown how the proposed scheme can be used to build
reduced-order observers. Particular attention is paid to the case when linear parts
of interconnections are known a priori, and an algorithm is proposed which takes
advantage of this knowledge to come up with improved results. To illustrate the ap-
plication of the proposed schemes we include two examples, the ﬁrst dealing with
interconnected pendulums, and the second with the problem of platoons of vehicles
in the case when the velocity and acceleration of the neighboring vehicles are not
accessible.
Reference is made to model of Class I as described by (2.1)–(2.4). To proceed
further, we consider that
1. The dynamic controller F for S is linear,
2. It obeys the decentralized information structure constraint requiring that each
subsystem is controlled using its own local output and
3. It is composed of an observer of Luenberger-type and a static observer state
feedback.
This motivates us to express controller F into the
F:
˙w = Aw + Bu + L(y −Cw),
u = Kw,
(2.12)
where w ∈ℜn is the observer state, with w = [wt
1,...,wt
N]t, wj ∈ℜnj and
K = diag{K1,...,KN},
L = diag{L1,...,LN}

represent the global controller parameter matrices while pairs (Kj,Lj) determine
the local dynamic controllers.
The resulting closed-loop system Sc = (S,F) can be expressed as
Sc:
˙z = Acz + hc(t,z),
y = Ccz,
(2.13)
where z is the state vector. Deﬁning
z = [zt
1,zt
2]t,
z1 = w, z2 = w −x
we obtain

Cc =

,
(2.14)
hc(t,z) =
0 ... −h(z1 −z2)t t.
In view of (2.4), we have now
hc(t,z)thc(t,z) ≤ztH t
cΓ −1Hcz,
(2.15)
where Hc = [H
... −H].
We now address the key feature of dynamic controller F, that is, it must ro-
bustly stabilizes S. According to the results of [55, 58], it is shown that S is ro-
bustly stabilized with vector degree α = [α1,...,αN]t if the equilibrium z = 0 of
the closed-loop system Sc = (S,F) is globally asymptotically stable for all hc(t,z)
satisfying (2.15) for some Hc and Γ .
It turns out that the controller stabilizes the linear part of S and, at the same time,
maximizes its tolerance to uncertain nonlinear interconnections and perturbations.
This is nicely expressed by the following LMI-based formulation:
System Sc = (S,F) is robustly stable with vector degree α if the following prob-
lem is feasible:

Xc > 0,

(2.16)
It must be observed that, by and large, observer-based feedback design cannot be
completed directly using (2.16). The main reason for this is that the second matrix
inequality is not an LMI in both Xc and the feedback parameter matrix.
Remark 2.7 At this stage we should recall some basic results from [1, 16]. In the
case of state-feedback the problem can be readily transformed into an LMI problem
by a simple change of variables (convexiﬁcation procedure). However, in the case
of dynamic output feedback the problem becomes far more complex. A decoupled
quadratic Lyapunov function with block-diagonal weighting matrix has been used in

2.2
Dynamic Output Feedback: Class I
21
[58] to determine the dynamic controller parameters. However, the proposed design
procedure imposes additional constraints on the system model characteristics.
In what follows we will provide some modiﬁcations of problem (2.16) obtained
by convexifying the constraints. Solutions to these problems will provide guaranteed
feasible solutions to (2.16) and the upper bound of the objective function TrΓ .

where S1 = AQ + QAt + BW + W tBt and S2 = PA + AtP −V C −CtV t.
We have the following result:
Theorem 2.1 System S is robustly stabilized by the controller F if Problem 2.1 is
feasible. The controller parameters are given by
K = WQ−1,
L = P −1V.
(2.19)
Proof In what follows it will be shown that there exists a real number λ > 0 such
that the matrix Xc = diag{λ−1Q−1,P} satisﬁes LMIs (2.16) for some Γ > 0, where

lem 2.1 and deﬁne
ν = λmin(Ξ−1
1 ),
a = λM(Ξ2Ξt

μ = λM(Ξ3(Γ0)).
It is easy to see that Ξ1 and Ξ3(Γ0) represent principal minors of the matrices
Ψ (S1,I,QH t,Γ0) < 0 and Ψ (S2,P,−H t,Γ0) < 0 and hence both eigenvalues μ
and ν are negative.
Selecting Γ = λ∗Γ0,λ∗> |θ|/|μ|,θ = −1 + aν and assuming that 0 < λ < λ∗,
it follows that
λM{Ξ3(Γλ)} = λM{Ξ3((λ∗/λ)Γ0)} ≤λM{Ξ3(Γ0)} = μ
bearing in mind that λ∗/λ > 1. For this selection of Γ and λ, (2.21) is implied by
μλ −θ < 0,
(2.22)
which holds true for |θ|/|μ| < λ < λ∗. Therefore, the desired λ exists and the proof
is completed.

guaranteed from Theorem 2.1 are generally conservative. More realistic values can
be obtained by plugging the controller parameters obtained by (2.19) into (2.16) and
by solving the corresponding minimization problem with variables Xc and Γ . This
will be demonstrated in the numerical examples presented later on.

Remark 2.9 It is interesting to note that Problem 2.1 implements the separation
principle. The constituent problems
Q > 0,
Ψ (S1,I,QH t,Γ 1) < 0,
P > 0,
Ψ (S2,P,−H t,Γ 2) < 0
can be readily solved independently, the ﬁrst providing K as in the state feedback
design and the second L, robustly stabilizing the observer, so that
Γ = diag{max(γ 1
1 ,γ 2
1 )Iℓ1,...,max(γ 1
N,γ 2
N)IℓN }.
Remark 2.10 An alternative procedure to simplify LMIs in (2.18) is as follows:
Problem 2.2
min TrΓ
subject to
Q > 0,
P > 0,
Ξ3(Γ ) < 0,
Ξ1 < 0
(2.23)
while the controller parameters are obtained by using (2.19).
Generally speaking, the achievable robustness degree is lower than the one
obtained by solving Problem 2.1. Speciﬁcally, it is possible to show using the
methodology of Theorem 2.1 that if Q0,W0 and Γ0 are obtained by solving Prob-
lem 2.2, then there exist ρ > 0 and β > 1 such that Ψ (ρ(AQ0 + Q0At + BW0 +
W t
0Bt),I,ρQ0H t,βΓ0) < 0.
By taking into consideration the interdependence between K and L in the LMIs
(2.16), we will attempt to exploit the structure of (2.20) to construct improved algo-
rithms with higher robustness degree.

Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems I
Theorem 2.2 System S is robustly stabilized by the controller F if Problem 2.3 is
feasible. Controller parameters are given by (2.19). The robustness degree bounds
are given by αj = 1/γjδj.
Proof It is readily seen that the second inequality in (2.25) is identical to inequal-
ity (2.16) for Xc = diag{Q−1,P}, with Γ replaced by Γ Δ and hence the desired
result.
□
Remark 2.11 It should be noted that Steps 1 and 2 have to be performed consecu-
tively and not simultaneously, like in Problems 2.1 and 2.2. Alternative algorithms
could be derived if one takes, for example,

and arrives at a problem similar to Problem 2.3, in which K is determined in the
ﬁrst step, and L in the second step.
2.2.1.2 Reduced Order Observer
The results of the foregoing section can be directly extended to the design of con-
trollers with decentralized reduced order observers. For this purpose, we assume
that Cj = [0(nj−pj)×nj
... IPi], pj ≤nj if xj is divided into
xj = [(xa
j )t,(xc
j)t]t,
xa
j ∈ℜnj−pj , xc
j ∈ℜpj
then yj = xc
j and the output wj ∈ℜnj −pj of the local reduced order observer is an
estimate of xa
j . Similar to [33], we assume that the local dynamic controllers Fj
have the form:
˙wj = A11
j wj + A12
j yj + B1
j uj + Lj[ ˙yj −A21
j wj −A22
j yj −B2

containing the ﬁrst nj −pj columns of Hj, having in mind that Hjx = Hjξ −¯Hjη.
The structure of the closed-loop model (2.28) shows that controller design can
be entirely based on the methodology developed earlier. Hence, Problem 2.1 and
Theorem 2.1 yield

¯V = diag{ ¯V1,..., ¯VN}.
The controller parameters are obtained by using (2.19).
2.2.1.3 Important Special Case
We now look at the special case where the interconnections between the subsys-
tems Sj in S is known, linear and can be represented by a full matrix As ∈ℜn×n
containing off diagonal interconnection blocks, so that A + As becomes the new
state matrix in the linear part of S in (2.2). The function h(t,x) still represents the
unknown part of interconnections.
The foregoing design methodology can be extended to this case while aiming to
exploit the additional a priori information constraint. A point of caution must be
entertained here. By replacing A by A + As in the observer equation for F in (2.12)
one violates the adopted information structure constraint, i.e. the dynamic controller
ceases to be decentralized. Inserting A + As only in the state model (2.3), we obtain
Ac =
⎡
⎣A + BK
...
−LC
−Aδ
...
A + As −LC
⎤
⎦.
This fact indicates that the design scheme could now be based on modifying the
problems described in Sects. 2.2.1.1 and 2.2.1.2 by inserting the new information
in the form of As at the corresponding places in the related LMIs. Robust stabi-
lization is achievable however, when the interconnections are sufﬁciently weak. For
example, Problem 2.1 turns to be:
Problem 2.4

Ψ (S1,I,QH t,Γ ) < 0,

(2.34)
where S2s = P(A + As) + (A + As)tP −V C −CtV t.
Theorem 2.3 The system S with known linear interconnections (modeled by adding
Aδ to A in (2.3)) is robustly stabilized by the decentralized dynamic controller F in
(2.12) if Problem 2.4 is feasible and

By similarity to Theorem 2.1, we let P = λ∗Γ0 for some λ∗> 0, where Γ0 is
the optimal value obtained by solving Problem 2.4. Assume that 0 < λ < λ∗. Then,
(2.37) is implied by
−2δνsλP λQλ2 + μλ −θs < 0,
(2.38)
bearing in mind that λM{Ξ3(Γλ)}λM{Ξ3(Γ0)} = μ. Observe that νs < 0 by as-
sumption, as a consequence of the feasibility of Problem 2.4. The existence of
λ > 0 satisfying (2.38) is guaranteed if (2.35) holds, since then we have D =
μ2 −8δθsνsλP λQ > 0. Consequently, we choose

It is required to compute a decentralized control law which would connectively
stabilize the system for all values of e(t,x) ∈[0,1].
A decentralized state-feedback is designed to provide α = 4.4950 with the local
controller gain matrix K = [−725.9085 −40.4346] and the corresponding closed-
loop poles {−20 ± j17.8093}.
Computer simulation shows that the system is not stabilizable by static output
feedback, since two coefﬁcients of the characteristic equation remain ﬁxed to zero
irrespective of the controller parameters.
Turning to dynamic output feedback obtained by the proposed algorithms, Ta-
ble 2.1 provides results on robustness degree α. In this table, Case A corresponds

priori knowledge, when H = I and As = 0, and the algorithms from Sect. 2.2.1.1
are applied.
The ensuing results lead to the conclusion that the best results are obtained
by solving Problem 2.3; the worst case corresponds to Problem 2.2. This is quite
expected. In view of the results of [55], we note that in Case C none of the
algorithms ensures connective stability. For Problem 2.2, connective stability is
achieved only in Case B, when the information about the interconnections is in-
cluded. This corresponds in Case B to have, in fact, e(t,x) = 0.5 + ea(t,x), where
ea(t,x) ∈[−0.5,0.5], so that any value of α > 0.5 is sufﬁcient for connective sta-
bility. All values of K and L and the corresponding modes are not presented be-
cause of the lack of space. For example, for Problem 2.1 and Case A we have
Kj = [−79.1666 −11.2883], Lt
j = [27.7711 15.7991], with local closed-loop
poles {−27.2275,−0.5435,−0.5441 ± j6.8052}.
2.2.3 Simulation Example 2.2
This example is concerned with the decentralized control of a platoon of vehicles.
A feedback-linearized state space model of a platoon of N automotive vehicles is
based, according to [65], on the following feedback linearized individual vehicle
model:
˙dj = vj−1 −vj,
˙vj = aj,
˙aj = −τ −1
j
aj + τ −1
j
uj,
(2.40)
where dj = xj−1 −xj is the distance between two consecutive vehicles, xj−1 and
xj being their positions, vj and aj are the velocity and acceleration of ith vehicle,
respectively, uj the input signal chosen to make the closed-loop system satisfy cer-

overall platoon state space model with the state

where dr,vr,ar are the reference values for inter-vehicle distance, velocity and ac-
celeration, respectively, and applying the state and input expansion by using conve-

obtained [65]:

This model is treated in [65] where it is shown that a decentralized dynamic

Sect. 2.2.1.2, supposing that only the subsystem states dj −dr, vj −vr and aj −ar
are exactly known in jth vehicle (subsystem), that is, vj−1 and aj−1 are not acces-
sible in ith vehicle. Applying the results of Sect. 2.2.1.2, the reduced-order Luen-

Obviously, it is also possible to apply the alternative design schemes from
Sect. 2.2.1.1. By using the expansion/contraction matrices as in [60] and [65], the
obtained controller has to be ﬁnally contracted to the original space for implemen-

2.2.5 Dynamic Control Design
Extending on the foregoing section, we now consider a general linear time-invariant
dynamic controller F for S which obeys the decentralized information structure con-
straint. This entails that each subsystem is controlled using only its own local output.
Therefore,
F:
˙w = Fcw + Lcy,
u = Kcw + Gcy,
(2.45)
where w ∈ℜs is the global observer state, and
w =
w1 ... wN
t ,
wj ∈ℜsj , s =


j=1
sj,
Fc = diag{Fc1,...,FcN},
Lc = diag{Lc1,...,LcN},
Kc = diag{Kc1,...,KcN},
Gc = diag{Gc1,...,GcN}.
For simplicity in exposition, we denote
Jj =
 Fcj
Lcj
Kcj
Gcj

∈ℜsj +mj×sj+pj
the local controller parameter matrices, and by J = diag{J1,...,JN} the global
controller parameter matrix.
By standard algebraic manipulations, the resulting closed-loop system Sc =
(S,F) can be represented by
Sc:
˙z = Acz + hc(t,z),
y = Ccz,
(2.46)
where
z =

Ac = diag{Ac1,...,AcN},
Cc = diag{Cc1,...,CcN},

In view of the structural constraint (2.4), we have

(2.47)

in which νj × nj matrices ¯H t

[ ¯H 1
j
... ...
... ¯H N
j ] while ˜H = diag{ ˜H1,..., ˜HN} with ˜Hj = [Hj
... 0].
Our immediate objective is to design the dynamic controller F which robustly
stabilizes S. Following the results of [9, 46–54, 56–58], it follows that
System S is robustly stabilized with vector degree
¯α =
 ¯α1 ... ¯αN
t =
1/√¯γ1 ... 1/√¯γN
t
if the equilibrium x = 0 of the closed-loop system Sf = (S,F) is globally asymp-
totically stable for all h(t,z) satisfying (2.4) for some given ¯H and ¯α, according to
the ﬁrst inequalities in (2.4) and (2.47).
It turns out that maximizing ¯α, the controller stabilizes the linear part of S and, at
the same time, maximizes its tolerance to uncertain nonlinear interconnections and
perturbations. In this regard, the nonlinear interconnections bound is represented by
a full matrix ¯H. Bearing in mind that the system model sparsity implied by (2.1)
and (2.3) and the developed controller structure in (2.45) designates the perfectly
decentralized control [52, 53], the corresponding controller subspace is not quadrat-
ically invariant. This entails that the related optimization problem is not convex.
In order to convexify the problem under consideration, we invoke further decom-
positions by applying the second (right hand side) inequalities in (2.4) and (2.47),
and formulate the following modiﬁed robust stabilization problem:
System Sf = (S,F) is robustly stable with vector degree α = (α1,...,αN)t =
(1/√γ1,...,1/√γN)t if the following problem is feasible:

where ˜X is the global Lyapunov matrix.

Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems I
It must be noted that the matrix ˜H is block-diagonal in accordance with the as-
sumed system sparsity, that is, with the subsystem dimensions. The second matrix
inequality in (2.48) however is still not an LMI in both ˜X and the controller param-
eter matrix.
In the next section, we show that the above general robust stabilization problem
can also be formulated as an LMI problem.
2.2.6 Robust Decentralized Design
Having in mind the availability of the system structure, together with the a priori
knowledge about the interconnection bounds, it is quite natural to consider global
Lyapunov matrices ˜X structurally adapted to S and F:
Assumption 2.3 Matrix ˜X in (2.48) possesses the block-diagonal structure, that
is, ˜X = diag{ ˜X1,..., ˜HN} where ˜Xj ∈ℜnj+sj×nj+sj , j = 1,...,N are the local
Lyapunov matrices.
It must be emphasized that this choice does not represent a signiﬁcant restriction,
giving the fact that the original problem has been already decomposed in (2.48) into
N independent robust dynamic output feedback design problems.
Proceeding further, we let
¯A = diag{ ¯A1,..., ¯AN},
¯B = diag{ ¯B1,..., ¯BN},
¯C = diag{ ¯C1,..., ¯CN},
¯Aj =
Aj
0

¯Bj =


,
¯Cj =

Cj


and then write 
A = ¯A + ¯BJ ¯C, where J is the global controller parameter matrix.
Consequently, the second inequality in (2.48) can be written as

R + 
BJ 
C + 
CtJ t 
Bt < 0,
(2.49)
where 
R = diag{ ˜R1,..., ˜RN}, 

It is interesting to note that the problem (2.49) resembles a compact formulation of
a set of N local classical H∞problems for virtual subsystems deﬁned as
˙xj = Ajxj + Bjuj + wj,
zj = Hjxj,
where the immediate objective is to compute local controllers that render the H∞-
norms of the transfer functions between wj and zj are less than γj.

2.2
Dynamic Output Feedback: Class I

An important observation arises here. The block matrix (2.48) contains the en-
tire Lyapunov matrix ˜X, and not of ˜X col[I,.,0] as it should be in the case of the
classical H∞problems [6, 10, 11].
The following lemma provides a pertinent result:
Lemma 2.1 Let Assumption 2.3 hold and let ˜X > 0. Then, (2.49) holds if and only
if


B⊥t < 0,

j = ˜B⊥

j , taking into
consideration that S−1

Proceeding further, we follow the approach of [6] and introduce the decomposi-
tions:

The following result is established:
1A⊥denotes a matrix with the properties N(A⊥) = R(A) and A⊥A⊥t > 0, where N (.),R(.)
denote the null space and the range space of an indicated matrix.

and deleting the unnecessary block-rows and block-columns, we arrive at the desired
result.
□
It is readily seen that the matrices Xj,Yj and X2j are constrained by (2.53).
This is in contrast to the standard H∞design [6, 10, 24]) where only the ﬁrst di-
agonal blocks of the global Lyapunov matrix and its inverse are constrained by the
corresponding LMIs.
Once Xj,Yj and X2j are determined, the next problem is to ﬁnd ˜Xj > 0 satisfy-
ing (2.52), j = 1,...,N.
Lemma 2.3 Assume that:
(1) sj = nj,
(2) X2j in (2.52) is nonsingular, and
(3) Qj =
 Xj I
I
Yj

> 0. Then,
X3j = Xt
2j(Xj −Y −1
1 )−1X2j
=⇒
˜Xj > 0,
j = 1,...,N. (2.54)
Proof From (2.52), we obtain Y t
2j = X−1
2j (I −XjYj), yielding directly (2.54). Obvi-
ously, ˜Xj > 0, since Xj > 0 and Xj −X2jX−1
2j (Xj −Y −1
j
)(Xt
2j)−1Xt
2j = Y −1
j
> 0,
which completes the proof.
□
By combining the foregoing results, we have the following theorem:
Theorem 2.4 Under Assumption 2.3, system S in (2.3) is robustly stabilized by the
dynamic controller F in (2.45) with sj = nj if the following problem is feasible:

in such a way that the dimension of
the identity matrix ensures compatibility of the product with ¯Vj (instead of Vj),
j = 1,...,N.

Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems I
Proof Notice that the inequality ¯Ec ¯V ¯Ect < 0 from the problem (2.55) follows im-
mediately from the ﬁrst inequality in (2.53) in Lemma 2.2 after applying the Schur’s
complement formula and replacing X2jXt
2j by Zj in view of the expression for ¯Vj.
Condition Z > 0 results from the requirement that the matrices X2j are nonsingular,
j = 1,...,N. The inequality EbWEbt < 0 is identical to the second inequality in
(2.55). This completes the proof.
□
Remark 2.12 Solving (2.55), one gets X > 0,Y > 0 and Z > 0. Nonsingular matri-
ces X2j can always be constructed from any given Zj > 0; one gets X3j from (2.54),
and, consequently, ˜Xj > 0 from (2.52), j = 1,...,N. Then, we come back to the
original inequality (2.49), which represents then a system of N independent LMIs
with unconstrained matrix variables Jj,j = 1,...,N. Any solution to these LMIs
gives the required block-diagonal parameter matrix J = diag{J1,...,JN}, that is, a
robustly stabilizing decentralized dynamic controller F for S.
The underlying assumptions in Lemma 2.3 are important for the formulation of
Theorem 2.1 in terms of LMIs. In general, in the case of reduced order observers
(when sj < nj), one is faced with the problem of the existence of solutions for
Y2j,Y3j and X3j satisfying (2.52); notice that in the case of H∞design we have
the rank condition in addition to the condition of the type Qj > 0 [6]. The obtained
estimates of the robustness degree α may appear to be too conservative. A better
insight into the real robustness can be obtained by calculating Af with the obtained
parameter matrix J , replacing it in (2.48), and solving (2.48) for ˜X and Γ . An even
more realistic and less conservative estimate can be obtained by using (2.48) with ˜H
being replaced by ¯H and Γ by ¯Γ , and by solving the corresponding LMI problem
for ˜X and ¯Γ . By limiting the norm of the gain matrices Jj via the procedure of [55,
58] some beneﬁts are anticipated.
Remark 2.13 In the case that the interconnection function in S is in the form
h(t,x) = hL(t,x)+hN(t,x), where hL(t,x) = Ahx is a known linear part in which
Ah is a constant N ×N block-matrix with blocks Ah
jk, j,k = 1,...,N, and hN(t,x)
is an unknown nonlinear part satisfying inequality (2.4). Taking A∗= A + Ah as a
new state matrix in (2.3), instead of (2.49) we have
˜R∗+ Δ ˜R + ˜BxJ ˜Ct + ˜CtJ t ˜Bxt < 0,
(2.56)

and ˜R∗is obtained from ˜R in (2.49) by replacing Aj by A∗
ii = Aj + Ah
ii. Bear-
ing in mind that ˜R∗+ Δ ˜R is not block-diagonal, Theorem 2.1 cannot be directly
applied to (2.56). However, (2.56) can have a solution satisfying Assumption 2.3;
it is reasonable to expect that the resulting controller provides better performance
than the one obtained in the absence of the assumed a priori knowledge about linear
interconnections.
2.2.7 Simulation Example 2.4
This examples uses the model of two inverted pendulums connected by a spring
treated in the simulation Example 2.1.
From [55], the decentralized robust linear static state feedback provides α∗=
α1 = α2 = 4.4950, with the local gain matrix K = [−725.909 −40.435] and the
local closed-loop poles {−20 ± j17.8093}. It easy to see that the system is not
stabilizable by any linear static output feedback.
The local dynamic output feedback controller parameters obtained on the basis
of Theorem 2.1, with Hj = I are
Fj = 104

with the local closed-loop poles
{−3.6543 × 104,−0.0390 × 104,−0.7455 ± j0.5605},
with α∗= 0.5670 < 1—that is, the desired property is not achieved.
Assuming now that e(t,x) = 0.5 + ´e(t,x), where ´e(t,x) ∈[−0.5,0.5] one ob-
tains the structure with known linear interconnections with
Ah =

and the local closed loop poles
{−2.6487 × 106,−1.7217 × 104,−84.866,−1.8834}.
A direct comparison with the results presented in relation with the same example
in [67] shows that a better performance is obtained by using an observer of Luen-
berger type, incorporating the state matrix of the system model and leaving a smaller
number of free parameters in the controller design procedure.
2.3 Robust Control Design: Class II
In this section, we investigate the problem of robust decentralized control for a
wider class of large-scale nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainty and non-
linear interconnections. This class of systems was labeled in Sect. 2.1.2 as Class II.
In this class, each subsystem of the interconnected system is assumed to be par-
tially feedback linearizable and minimum phase. The uncertain parameters and/or
disturbances are allowed to be time-varying and enter the system nonlinearly. The
nonlinear interconnections are bounded by general nonlinear functions of the zero-
dynamics and outputs of other subsystems. Inspired by the centralized nonlinear
control results [9, 23, 35, 39, 51], we show in the sequel that decentralized global
robust stabilization can be achieved for the uncertain interconnected systems by em-
ploying a Lyapunov-based recursive controller design method. Our result relies on
a proper construction of Lyapunov function for the interconnected systems.
2.3.1 Construction Procedure
In what follows, we ﬁrst present the following lemma which provides the ﬁrst step
of the induction in the construction of robust decentralized state feedback control
laws of system (2.6).
Lemma 2.4 Consider the ﬁrst two state equations of system (2.6):
˙zj = fj0(zj,xj1) + φj0(zj,xj1,Zj,Xj1;θ)xj1,
˙xj1 = xj2 + φj1(zj,xj1,Zj,Xj1,θ),
(2.57)
yj = xj1,
satisfying Assumptions 2.1 and 2.2. Then, there exists a smooth function x∗
i2(zj,xj1)
with x∗
j2(0,0) = 0 such that system (2.12) with the control xj2 = x∗
j2(zj,xj1) in the
coordinates
zj = zj,
˜xj1 = xj1

j1l(ζj1l(∥(zl,xl1)∥))2, (2.61)
with βj0l and βj1l being positive scaling constants.
Proof First, since fj0(zj,xj1) of (2.12) is a smooth vector with fj0(0,0) = 0, there
exists a smooth vector fj1(zj,xj1) such that
fj0(zj,xj1) = fj00(zj) + fj1(zj,xj1)xj1,
where fj00(zj) is as in (2.60). By virtue of Assumption 2.2 and along the state
trajectory of system (2.57), we have

(2.66)
where bj(·,·) is a smooth function to counteract the effect of the interconnections
and is to be determined. Then, (2.58) is obtained and the proof of Lemma 2.4 is now
completed.

Remark 2.14 For the case when r = 1, that is, xj2 = vj in (2.57) is the actual con-
trol input, it can be shown, refer to the proof of Theorem 2.5, that the design func-
tions bj(·,·) and Wj(·), j = 1,2,...,N can be chosen such that the decentralized
state feedback control vj = x∗
j2(zj,xj1) solves the robust decentralized stabilization
problem.
2.3.2 Recursive Design
Next, we proceed toward the systematic recursive design methodology for construct-
ing robust decentralized control laws for the system (2.6) when r ≥2. A preliminary
result is provided.
Lemma 2.5 Consider the ﬁrst ρ + 1 state equations of system (2.6):
˙zj = fj0(zj,xj1) + φj0(zj,xj1,Zj,Xj1;θ)xj1,
˙xj1 = xj2 + φj1(zj,xj1,Zj,Xj1;θ),
˙xj2 = xj3 + φj2(zj, ¯xj2,Zj,Xj1;θ),
...
˙xj,ρ−1 = xj,ρ + φj,ρ−1(zj, ¯xj,ρ−1,Zj,Xj1;θ),
˙xj,ρ = xj,ρ+1 + φj,ρ(zj, ¯xjρ,Zj,Xj1;θ),
(2.67)
satisfying Assumptions 2.1 and 2.2. Suppose that for any given index ρ = m (1 ≤
m ≤r −1), there exist smooth functions
x∗

x∗
i3(zj, ¯xj2),

x∗

dinates

trol law stabilizing the uncertain interconnected nonlinear systems (2.6) can be com-
pleted. This is demonstrated below.
Theorem 2.5 Consider the uncertain interconnected system (2.6) satisfying As-
sumptions 2.1 and 2.2. Then there exists a decentralized control law, vj =
vj(zj,xj), j = 1,2,...,N, such that the overall system with the decentralized con-
troller is globally asymptotically stable for all admissible uncertainties and inter-
connections. Indeed; a suitable decentralized controller is given by
vj := x∗
j,r+1(zj, ¯xj,r) = −Mjr −˜xj,r−1 −˜xjr,
(2.79)
where Mjr is given in (2.35) with m + 1 = r.
Proof By Lemma 2.4, it is not difﬁcult to show that the induction hypotheses of
Lemma 2.5 is satisﬁed. This motivates us to build a Lyapunov-based recursive de-
centralized control law by applying Lemma 2.5 repeatedly until the rth step. There-
fore, we can construct x∗
j2(zj,xj1),...,x∗
j,r+1(zj, ¯xjr) such that under the new co-
ordinates

Since Vj0(zj) in Assumption 2.1 is radially unbounded and positive deﬁnite, there
exists a K∞function κℓj such that

Therefore, due to the onto-relation between (zj,xj) and (zj, ˜xj), where ˜xj =
(˜xj1,..., ˜xir), the closed-loop interconnected system of (2.2) with the decentral-
ized controller (2.79) is globally asymptotically stable for all admissible uncertain-
ties and interconnections.
□
Remark 2.15 Observe from Theorem 2.5 that the functions bj(zj,xi1) and Wj(Vi0),
i = 1,2,...,N, can be chosen before we start the recursive design of the robust
decentralized stabilization controller.
Remark 2.16 Theorem 2.5 presents a decentralized global stabilization result for
uncertain interconnected minimum-phase nonlinear systems with parametric uncer-
tainty and interconnections bounded by general nonlinear functions. This result ex-
tends centralized results in [35, 39] to decentralized control of large-scale intercon-
nected systems.
2.3.3 Simulation Example 2.5
Consider the following large-scale system which is composed of two subsystems:
Subsystem 1:
˙z1 = −2z1 + z1x11,
˙x11 = x12 + x11z1 sinθ1 + x2
21z2 cosθ2
1 ,
˙x12 = u1 + x2
12(x11z1 + z2
1)sinθ1 + x21z2 cos(θ1z1);
(2.90)

2.3

51
Subsystem 2:
˙z2 = −z2 + x2
21,
˙x21 = x22 + (x2
11z1 + x2
21z2)sin(z2θ2),
˙x22 = u2 + x2
22(x11z2
1 + x21z2
2)sinθ2 + x2
22z3
2 cos(θ2
2 z2
2),
(2.91)
where θ1,θ2 ∈[−2,2].
It is easy to verify that the interconnections in the above interconnected system
satisfy Assumption 2.2. Choose βjkm = 1,j,k,m = 1,2. It follows from (2.83) and
(2.84) that
Δ11 = Δ12 = Δ21 = Δ22 = 0
D11 = 0,
D12 = 2x2
21z2
2 + z2
2,
D21 = 2x2
11z2
1 + z4
1,
D22 = 0.
1. Let V10 = 1
2z2
1 and V20 = 1
2z2
2. Then,
∂V10
∂z1
f10(z1,0) = −2z2
1;
∂V20
∂z2
f20(z2,0) = z2
2.
Obviously, Assumption 2.1 is satisﬁed with ν1 = 2 and ν2 = 1.
It also follows from (2.86) that
κ11(V10) = κ21(V10) = κ12(V20) = κ22(V20) = 0.
By choosing k1 = k2 = 3, according to (2.87) and (2.88), we have
dW1
dV10
= 4,
dW2
dV20
= 5
and
b1 = D11 + D21,
b2 = D12 + D22.
It follows from (2.18) and (2.20) that
α11 = x2
11 + 0 : 25,
α21 = x2
21
and
M11 = dW1
dV10
z2

11,
M21 = dW2
dV20
z2x21 + 0.5x21 + x21α21 + 0.25α2
21.
Hence, we can compute the virtual control
x∗
12 = −M11 −b1x11 −2x11,
x∗
22 = −M21 −b2x21 −2x21.

According to (2.74), we can choose
α12 = x2
12(z2
1 + 0.25),
α22 = x2
22z2
2.
Hence, it follows from (2.77) that
M12 = a12 + ˜x12(4(ψ1
12)2α2
11 + α2
12 + α12) + 0.5˜x12((ψ1
12)2 + (ψ2

M22 = a22 + ˜x22(4(ψ1
22)2α2
21 + α2
22 + α22) + 0.5˜x22((ψ1
22)2 + (ψ2
22)2x4
22).
The control law can be obtained from (2.78) as follows:
u1 = −x11 −M12 −˜x12,
(2.92)
u2 = −x21 −M22 −˜x22.
(2.93)
Systems (2.90)–(2.91) were simulated with the controller (2.92) and (2.93) to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the decentralized robust control design procedure.
The initial conditions are set to be
z1 = 1.0,
x11 = −1.0,
x12 = 1.5,
z2 = 1.0,
x21 = −1.0,
x22 = 1.5
and the uncertainties θ1 and θ2 are given by θ1 = 2sint and θ2 = 2cost2. Obviously,
the uncertainties are time-varying ones and belong to the set [−2,2]. The closed-
loop responses for the two subsystems are plotted in Figs. 2.1 and 2.2 from which
the stability is clearly seen.
2.4 Decentralized Tracking: Class III
In this section, we attend to the problem of class III that was presented in Sect. 2.1.3.
In the problem description there, attention was given to a class of large-scale nonlin-
ear systems which is comprised of N interconnected subsystems with time-varying

unknown parameters and/or disturbances entering nonlinearly into the state equation
as modeled by (2.9) and (2.10).
In what follows, we focus on studying the problem of decentralized output-
feedback tracking with disturbance attenuation. Thus, with reference to the model
(2.9) and (2.10), for every 1 ≤j ≤N and a given time-varying signal yir(t) whose
derivatives up to order nj are bounded over [0,∞), our objective hereafter is to
design a smooth, decentralized, dynamic, output-feedback controller of the form
˙xj = νj(xj,yj,t),
uj = μj(xj,yj,t),
xj ∈ℜ¯nj
(2.94)
such that the following properties hold for the resulting closed-loop large-scale non-
linear system (2.11), (2.94):

Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems I
1. When the signal wj ≡0 for all 1 ≤j ≤N, the tracking error signal yj −yir
goes to zero asymptotically and all other closed-loop signals remain bounded
over [0,∞).
2. When wj ̸= 0 for all 1 ≤j ≤N, the closed-loop system is bounded-input
bounded-state BIBS stable and, in appropriate coordinates, is integral-input-
to-state stable iISS with respect to the disturbance input w [63]. In particular,
there exists a class-K function γd (that is, γd is continuous, strictly increasing
and vanishes at the origin) such that, for any ρ > 0, the controller (2.94) can be
tuned to satisfy the inequality

where η0 is a nonnegative C0 function, and

N(0)]t,
x(0) = [xt
1(0),...,xt
N(0)]t,
x(0) = [xt
1(0),...,xt
N(0)]t.
Remark 2.17 Property (1) above means that decentralized asymptotic tracking is
achieved for each local jth subsystem (2.11) in the absence of disturbance in-
puts. Property (2) with (2.95) in implies that, in the presence of disturbances,
the decentralized output-feedback controller (2.94) has the ability to attenu-
ate the effect of the disturbances on the tracking error arbitrarily for a ﬁxed
class-K gain-function γd. As we shall see later, γd(s) = s2 + s4 + s8 in our
case.
In the sequel, sufﬁcient conditions are provided to yield the standard L2-
gain disturbance rejection property—that is, γd(s) = s2 in (2.95). It is inter-
esting to note that a similar problem has been studied in [41] in the frame-
work of centralized output-feedback tracking with almost disturbance decou-
pling.
The control problem formulated above will be solved in two steps demonstrated
in the following sections. We ﬁrst introduce a (partially) decentralized observer in
order to obtain an augmented decentralized system with partial-state information.
Then, we base the decentralized controller design on this enlarged dynamic sys-
tem.
2.4.1 Partially Decentralized Observer
Owing to the structure in every local system of (2.11), for each 1 ≤j ≤N, we
introduce the following state estimator for the (zj,xj)-subsystem:

2.4
Decentralized Tracking: Class III
55
˙ˆzj = Qj ˆzj + fj0(y1r,...,yNr),
˙ˆxj1 = ˆxj2 + Lj1(yj −xj1) + fj1(y1r,...,yNr)
+ gj1(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj,
...
ˆxjnj = uj + Ljnj (yj −ˆxj1) + fjnj (y1r,...,yNr)
+ gjnj (y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj,
(2.96)
Aj =
⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎣
−Lj1
−Lj2
Inj−1
...
−Ljnj
0...0
⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎦.
(2.97)
Notice that the eigenvalues of Aj can be assigned to any desired location in the open
left-half plane via the choice of appropriate constants {Ljm}nm
m=1, provided complex
conjugate eigenvalues appear in pair. In (2.97), Inj −1 is the unit matrix of order
nj −1.
Introducing the new variables
˜zj = zj −ˆzj,
˜xjk = xjk −ˆxjk,
1 ≤k ≤nj, 1 ≤j ≤N.
(2.98)
Then from (2.11) and (2.96), it follows that:
˙˜zj = Qj ˜zj + fj0(y1,...,yN) −fj0(y1r,...,yNr)
+ pj0(y1,...,yN)wj,
(2.99)
˙˜xj = Aj ˜xj + fj(y1,...,yN) −fj(y1r,...,yNr)
+ gj(y1,...,yN)zj −gj(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj
+ pj(y1,...,yN)wj,
(2.100)
where
˜xj = (˜xj1,..., ˜xjnj )t,
fj = (fj1,...,fjnj )t,
gj = (gi1,...,gjnj )t,
pj = (pj1,...,pjnj )t.
Since every fjk is a smooth function and every yjr is a bounded signal, there exist
a ﬁnite number of nonnegative smooth functions {ϕj0k}N
k=1,{ϕjk}N
k=1 such that
|fj0(y1,...,yN) −fj0(y1r,...,yNr)| ≤
N

k=1
|˜xk1|ϕj0k(˜xk1),
(2.101)
|fj(y1,...,yN) −fj(y1r,...,yNr)| ≤
N

k=1
|˜xk1|ϕjk(˜xk1).
(2.102)

56
2
Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems I
In a similar way, we can obtain a functional bound for gj(y1,...,yN)zj −
gj(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj. Indeed, we have
gj(y1,...,yN)zj −gj(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj
= gj(y1,...,yN)˜zj + (gj(y1,...,yN) −gj(y1r,...,yNr))ˆzj. (2.103)
Using the Mean-Value Theorem [29], there exist nonnegative smooth functions φik
(1 ≤k ≤N) such that
|gj(y1,...,yN)zj −gj(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj|
≤|gj(y1,...,yN)||˜zj| +
N

k=1
|˜xk1|φik(˜xk1)|ˆzj|.
(2.104)
It must be noted that, by means of these inequalities (2.101)–(2.104), it is easy to
show that, in the absence of disturbance inputs, the solutions (˜zj(t), ˜xj(t)) of the
cascade system (2.99)–(2.100) go to zero, if yj(t) −yir(t) →0 for all 1 ≤j ≤N.
The latter property will be guaranteed with the help of the decentralized controller
to be designed next.
Remark 2.18 It should be mentioned that the observer (2.96) is not asymptotic and
is totally decentralized only if the reference signals yjr = 0 for all 1 ≤j ≤N. Pro-
ceeding further, we select a partially decentralized observer so that; in appropriate
coordinates; the system (2.105) has an equilibrium point and therefore there is a
solution to decentralized asymptotic tracking. In general, when yjr(t) are general
time-varying signals, the system augmented with a totally decentralized observer
does not have a ﬁxed equilibrium. Thus, only practical tracking can be achieved by
means of high-gain feedback [60].
2.4.2 Design Procedure
From the forgoing development of partially decentralized observers, we derive the
following controller-observer combined system for the purpose of feedback design:
˙˜zj = Qj ˜zj + fj0(y1,...,yN) −fi0(y1r,...,yNr)
+ pj0(y1,...,yN)wj,
˙˜xj = Aj ˜xj + fj(y1,...,yN) −fj(y1r,...,yNr)
+ gj(y1,...,yN)zj −gj(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj
+ pj(y1,...,yN)wj,
˙yj = ˆxj2 + ˜xi2 + fj1(y1,...,yN) + gj1(y1,...,yN)zj
(2.105)

2.4
Decentralized Tracking: Class III
57
+ pi1(y1,...,yN)wj,
˙ˆxj2 = ˆxj3 + Li2(yj −ˆxi1) + fj2(y1r,...,yNr)
+ gj2(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj,
...
˙ˆxinj = uj + Ljnj (yj −ˆxi1) + fjnj (y1r,...,yNr)
+ gjnj (y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj.
Notice that the state variables (yj, ˆxj1, ˆxj2,..., ˆxjnj ), and then ˜xj1, are available
for feedback design. Also note that the states (˜zj, ˜xj) are unmeasured and that the
outputs yj, with j ̸= i, of other subsystems are unavailable for the design of the
regional input uj.
We now direct attention to the jth local system (2.105) with uj as the control
input. For the sake of clarity, the arguments of a function are often omitted in case
no possible confusion arises. For notational simplicity, denote
˜fj0 = fj0(y1,...,yN) −fj0(y1r,...,yNr),
(2.106)
˜fj = fj(y1,...,yN) −fj(y1r,...,yNr),
(2.107)
˜gj = gj(y1,...,yN)zj −gj(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj.
(2.108)
A step-by-step constructive controller design procedure is now developed, leading to
an improved solution to the decentralized problem under consideration with desired
tracking controllers.
Step J.1: Starting with the ﬁrst (˜zj, ˜xj,yj)-subsystem of (2.105). Introduce the new
variable ξj1 = yj −yjr (= ˜xj1) and consider the Lyapunov function
Vj1 = λj1˜zt
jPj1˜zj + λj2(˜zt
jPj1˜zj1)2 + ˜xt
jPj2 ˜xj + 1
2ξ2

(2.109)
where λj1,λj2 > 0 are design parameters, Pj1 = P t

i2 > 0 satisfy
Pi1Qj + Qt
jPi1 = −2Inzj ,
(2.110)
Pi2Aj + At
jPi2 = −2Inj .
(2.111)
This guarantees that Vj1 > 0. Then by evaluating the time derivative of Vi1 along
the solutions of (2.105), we obtain
˙Vj1 = (λj1 + 2λj2˜zt
jPj1˜zj)(−2|˜zj|2 + 2˜zt
jPj1( ˜fj0 + pj0wj))
−2|˜xj|2 + 2˜xt

+ pj1(y1,...,yN)wj −˙yir).
(2.112)

jPj1( ˜fj0 + pi0wj). Using (2.106) and (2.101), with
the help of Young’s inequality (see Chap. 9) and some algebraic manipulations, it
follows that:

The BIBS and iISS property (2) follows readily for the (transformed) closed-loop
system (2.11), (2.130) by either applying the technique in [64] or the Gronwall-
Bellman lemma [32] to (2.136). When wj = 0 for all 1 ≤j ≤N, the null solution
is uniformly globally asymptotically stable (UGAS), leading to the asymptotic con-
vergence of the tracking error y −yr because ξ1 = y −yr.
Now from (2.134), for any pair of instants 0 ≤t0 ≤t, we obtain

It must be noted that ρ can be made as small as possible by selecting sufﬁciently
large values of the constants kj1. In the present case, (2.95) is met with γd(s) =
s2 + s4 + s8. The proof of Theorem 2.6 is now completed.
□
Remark 2.19 It is of interest to observe that, in the absence of disturbance inputs
w, (2.136) yields that V converges to zero at an exponential rate and; therefore; the
tracking error y(t) −yr(t) goes to zero exponentially.
Remark 2.20 By similarity to the centralized output-feedback tracking with al-
most disturbance decoupling [41], Condition A can be weakened and the zj-system
in (2.11) can be broadened as follows:
˙zj = Γj(y1,...,yN)zj + fi0(y1,...,yN) + pi0(y1,...,yN)wj.
(2.138)
Assume that, for each 1 ≤j ≤N, there are a pair of constant matrices (0 < Pj =
P t
j ,0 < Mj = Mt
j) such that
Γ t
j (y1,...,yN)Pj + PjΓj(y1,...,yN) ≤−Mj.
(2.139)
Under this hypothesis, the ˆzj-system in the decentralized observer (2.96) is replaced
by
˙ˆzj = Γj(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj + fj0(y1r,...,yNr).
(2.140)
Using the same techniques as in Sect. 2.4.2, Theorem 2.6 can be extended to this
situation.
To proceed further, we examine the situation when the developed controller de-
sign procedure yields a decentralized output-feedback law guaranteeing the standard
L2-gain disturbance attenuation property (2.95) holds with γd(s) = s2. The follow-
ing additional sufﬁcient condition is recalled.
Condition B For all 1 ≤j ≤N and 1 ≤k ≤nk, the function pjk is bounded by a
constant. Furthermore, pj0 = 0 for each 1 ≤j ≤N.
The following lemma provides the desired result:
Lemma 2.6 Under Condition A and Condition B, the problem of decentralized
output-feedback tracking with L2-gain disturbance attenuation is solvable for the
class of minimum-phase large-scale systems (2.11).

Proof We initially note that the only place where |wj|4 and |wj|8 occur is Step J.1
during the controller development in Sect. 2.4.2. More precisely, they are brought up
in the inequalities (2.113) and (2.114). Under Condition B, the function Vj1 satisﬁes
the following inequality, instead of (2.121):

(2.142)
From (2.142), the standard L2-gain property from w to ξ1 = y −yr follows readily.
The proof of Lemma 2.6 is thus completed.
□
Remark 2.21 As an immediate corollary of Theorem 2.6, the standard L2-gain prop-
erty from w to ξ1 = y −yr can also be established when all functions fjk,gjk in
the decentralized system (2.11) are bounded by linear functions and the functions
pjk (1 ≤j ≤N,0 ≤k ≤nk) are bounded by some constants (in this case, pj0 ̸= 0).
The derived decentralized output-feedback controllers are linear.
Remark 2.22 The main features are four-fold:
(i) identifying a wide class of large-scale nonlinear systems in disturbed decen-
tralized output-feedback form;
(ii) proposing an effective systematic output-feedback controller design procedure
for decentralized systems in the presence of strong nonlinearities appearing in
the subsystems and interactions and
(iii) guaranteeing decentralized asymptotic tracking when the disturbance inputs
disappear and achieving desirable external stability properties when the distur-
bance inputs are present;
(iv) extending further the earlier results of [23, 29, 32, 40] to uncertain large com-
plex systems.
2.5 Decentralized Guaranteed Cost Control
In recent years, the problem of the decentralized robust control of large-scale sys-
tems with parameter uncertainties has been widely studied. Although there have

66
2
Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems I
been numerous studies on the decentralized robust control of large-scale uncertain
systems, much effort has been made toward ﬁnding a controller that guarantees ro-
bust stability. However, when controlling such systems, it is also desirable to design
control systems that guarantee not only robust stability but also an adequate level of
performance. One approach to this problem is the so-called guaranteed cost control
approach [47]. This approach has the advantage of providing an upper bound on a
given performance index.
Recent advances in the LMI theory have allowed a revisiting of the guaran-
teed cost control approach [82]. In [82], the guaranteed cost control technique
for interconnected systems by means of the LMI approach has been discussed.
In the literature, the guaranteed cost control for nonlinear uncertain large-scale
systems under gain perturbations has been considered. However, the time de-
lays have not been considered in those reports. If the system does not have de-
lays, the theoretical behavior would usually be more tractable. However, if de-
lays are present, they may result in instability or serious deterioration in the per-
formance of the resulting control systems. Therefore, the study of the control,
considering these time delays on the guaranteed cost stability, is very impor-
tant.
In what follows, the guaranteed cost control problem of the decentralized robust
control for uncertain nonlinear large-scale systems that have delay in both state and
control input is considered. It should be noted that although the robust control de-
sign method for parameter uncertain ordinary dynamic systems that have delay in
both state and control input has been considered, the guaranteed cost control for
nonlinear uncertain large-scale systems that have delay in both state and control
input has never been discussed. A sufﬁcient condition for the existence of the de-
centralized robust feedback controllers is derived in terms of the LMI. The main
result shows that the guaranteed cost controllers can be constructed by solving the
LMI. The crucial difference between the existing results [82] and that of the present
study is that the controller that guarantees the stability and the adequate level of
performance of the large-scale delay systems is given. Thus, the applicability of the
resulting controllers can be extended to more practical large-scale systems. More-
over, since the construction of the guaranteed cost controller consists of an LMI-
based control design, the proposed method is computationally attractive and use-
ful.

2.5.2 Including Input Delays
In what follows, we consider the problem of decentralized guaranteed cost control
via the state feedback to the class of nonlinear uncertain interconnected systems
with input delays. The class of system under consideration is described by
˙xj(t) = [Aj + ΔAj(t)]xj(t) + [Bj + ΔBj(t)]uj(t)
+ [Adj + ΔAdj(t)]xj(t −τj) + [Bdj + ΔBdj(t)]uj(t −hj)

(2.157)
xj(t) = φj(t),
t ∈[−dj,0],
dj = max{τj,hj},
j = 1,...,N,
(2.158)
where uj(t) ∈ℜmj are the control inputs of the jth subsystems. The parameter
uncertainties satisfy
[ΔAj(t) ΔBj(t) ΔAdj(t) ΔBdj(t)] = DjFj(t)[E1j E2j E1dj E2dj].
(2.159)

Decentralized Guaranteed Cost Control

Aj,Bj,E1j,E2j,Ed1j,Ed2j are constant matrices of appropriate dimensions. The
remaining constant real matrices and parameter uncertainties are the same as those
in system (2.143). Moreover, it is assumed that Assumptions (A1) and (A2) hold for
the unknown nonlinear vector functions gjk(xj,xk) ∈ℜℓj .
Associated with system (2.157) is the cost function

(2.160)
In view of the results of [47], the deﬁnition of the guaranteed cost control for the
class of uncertain interconnected systems (2.157) is now provided:
Deﬁnition 2.2 A decentralized control law uj(t) = Kjxj(t) is said to be a quadratic
guaranteed cost control related to the set of matrices 0 < Pj = P t
j for the uncertain
interconnected system (2.157) and cost function (2.160) if the closed-loop system is
quadratically stable and the closed-loop value of the cost function (2.160) satisﬁes
the bound J ≤J ∗for all admissible uncertainties, that is,

The objective now is to design a decentralized guaranteed cost controller
uj(t) = Kjxj(t),
j = 1,...,N,
for the uncertain large-scale interconnected delay system (2.157).
2.5.3 Decentralized Design Results
We now present the LMI design approach to the construction of a guaranteed cost
controller.

proved by using similar arguments for the proof of Theorem 2.7.
□
Remark 2.23 Since LMI (2.162) consists of a solution set of (μj,εjXj,Yj, ¯Sj,Zj),
various efﬁcient convex optimization algorithms can be applied. Moreover, its solu-
tions represent the set of guaranteed cost controllers. This parameterized represen-
tation can be exploited to design the guaranteed cost controllers, which minimizes
the value of the guaranteed cost for the closed-loop uncertain interconnected delay
systems.
Consequently, to determine the optimal cost bound we solve the following opti-
mization problem:

The main design result is summarized by the following theorem:
Theorem 2.9 If the foregoing optimization problem has the solution

then the control laws of the form (2.163) are the decentralized linear state feedback
control laws, which ensure the minimization of the guaranteed cost (2.164) for the
uncertain interconnected delay systems.
Proof By Theorem 2.8, the control laws (2.163) constructed from the feasible solu-
tions
μj,εj,Xj,Yj, ¯Sj,Zj,αj,Mj
are the guaranteed cost controllers of the uncertain interconnected delay systems
(2.157). Applying the Schur complement to the LMI (2.169) and using the following

(2.172)
Thus, the minimization of N

cost for the interconnected uncertain delay systems (2.157). The optimality of the
solution of the optimization problem follows from the convexity of the objective
function under the LMI constraints. This is the required result.
□
Remark 2.24 It must be noted that the original optimization problem for the guar-
anteed cost (2.168) can be appropriately decomposed into the following reduced
optimization problems (2.173) since each optimization problem (2.173) is indepen-
dent of each other. Hence, we only have to solve the optimization problems (2.173)
for each independent subsystem:

Remark 2.25 The constant parameter cj, which is included in the inequality (2.171),
needs to be optimized as the LMI constraints. In this case, it is hard to obtain the

78

optimum guaranteed cost, because the resulting problem is nonconvex optimization
problem. As an alternative, the above suboptimal guaranteed cost control is solved
instead of solving the non convex optimization problem. Consequently, the decen-
tralized robust suboptimal guaranteed cost controller, which minimizes the value of
the guaranteed cost for the closed-loop uncertain delay systems, can be easily solved
by using the LMI. The selected constant parameter cj needs to be as small as since
the matrix Xj is constrained by the inequality (2.169).
2.6 Global Robust Stabilization
2.6.1 Introduction
The decentralized control schemes, different from the classical centralized infor-
mation structures, have been considered with signiﬁcant interests for the control of
interconnected systems in recent years. The main objectives of decentralized con-
trol are to ﬁnd some feedback laws for adapting the interactions from the other
subsystems where no state information is transferred. The advantage of decentral-
ized control design is to reduce complexity and this therefore allows the control
implementation to be more feasible.
Unlike centralized control design, decentralized control cannot have access to
the entire state information. Therefore, interconnections between subsystems need
to be analyzed, so that their inﬂuence on the system performance can be properly
addressed by the control. As far as asymptotic stability of interconnected systems is
concerned, there are two main approaches for the treatment of the interconnections
in the literature. The ﬁrst is to assume that the interconnections satisfy the matching
conditions bounded by ﬁrst-order polynomials of states [3] or higher-order polyno-
mials [38, 56]. The second is to require that the interconnections meet a triangular
structure bounded by ﬁrst-order polynomials of states [79] or higher-order polyno-
mials [25]. The matching condition guarantees that Lyapunov redesign is applicable,
which begins with Lyapunov functions for nominal subsystems and then attempts
to use these Lyapunov functions to design decentralized feedback laws. Most of
the work in the literature falls into this category. On the other hand, the triangular
structure makes it possible to apply backstepping technique to design the decentral-
ized controllers. The backstepping design idea, which was initially introduced in
[28] for nonlinear adaptive control and in [8] for nonlinear robust control, was ap-
plied to construct decentralized robust controllers in [79] and used in decentralized
adaptive control by [25]. In the latter, we note that decentralized adaptive control
design is addressed for a class of large-scale interconnected nonlinear systems with
decentralized strict feedback form and single input subsystems. In the literature,
the interconnections are assumed to be bounded by higher order polynomials of the
states in the ﬁrst integrator of every subsystem, whose coefﬁcients admit a lower
triangular structure.

2.6
Global Robust Stabilization
79
One of the important problems in decentralized control is to relax restrictions
on the interconnections and uncertainties. There exist two kinds of restrictions,
such as matching conditions and strict feedback conditions in the literature. Many
physical systems, such as power systems in [62], do not satisfy these conditions,
so the study of relaxing these restrictions is of theoretical and practical impor-
tance.
Hereafter, the main objective is to investigate the problem of decentralized robust
stabilization for a class of large-scale nonlinear systems with parameter uncertain-
ties and nonlinear interconnections. Each system of the interconnected system is as-
sumed to be controlled by multiple inputs and to be in a nested structure, which was
ﬁrst introduced by [37]. The uncertain parameters and/or disturbances are allowed
to be time-varying and enter the system nonlinearly. The nonlinear interconnections
are bounded by higher-order polynomials in the decentralized strict feedback form.
Inspired by the recent work of centralized nonlinear control [36], it is proved that
the global decentralized robust asymptotic stabilization problem can be solved for
the uncertain interconnected nonlinear systems by applying a recursive design pro-
cedure.
2.6.2 Problem Formulation and Assumptions

with m inputs. The ith subsystem is given as

jd]t,
¯ξ N
j = [(¯ξ1
jrj )′,...,(¯ξN
jrj )t]t,
i = 1,...,N, j = 1,...,m, d = 1,...,rj.
The vector θ ∈ℜq is a time-varying uncertain parameters. All functions are smooth
and vanishing at the origin for any θ.
Remark 2.26 Every subsystem in (2.174) possesses a nested structure, that is, the
(xj, ¯ξj
1r1,..., ¯ξj
jrj )-blocks are nested in the ¯ξj
j+1,rj+1-block through feedback con-
nections between these blocks. Moreover, each block has a strict feedback structure
with unmatched interconnections. Such a structure can be easily seen from (5).
Our objective is to design decentralized robust controllers
uj
1 = uj
1(xj, ¯ξj
1r1),
...,
uj
m = uj
m(xj, ¯ξ j
1r1,...,ξj
mrm),
j = 1,...,N
such that the origin of the corresponding closed-loop system is globally asymptoti-
cally stable for any θ. The recursive design technique, that is, back stepping with the
aid of augmentation, developed in [36], will be applied to construct decentralized
robust controllers for the system (2.174).
To this end, we impose the following assumptions:
Assumption 2.4 There exist positive deﬁnite and proper smooth functions
V j(xj),
j = 1,...,N,
pjt
0 > 0
such that

Remark 2.27 It must be noted that Assumptions 2.5 and 2.6 imply that the intercon-
nections are bounded by polynomial-type nonlinearities with the decentralized strict
feedback form. In particular, the interconnections in the ith subsystem are bounded
by polynomial-type nonlinearities which are composed of two parts: higher-order
polynomials of its own states, i.e. the second and the third terms on the right-hand
side of (2.176) and the second terms on the right-hand side of (2.177); higher-order
polynomials of the states from other subsystems, that is. the ﬁrst terms on the right-
hand side of (2.176) and (2.177) which are comprised of all the zero-dynamic con-
sidered in [25], the last terms in (2.176) and (2.177) which are comprised of the ﬁrst
states of each subsystem.
Remark 2.28 Note also that the restrictions on the interconnections imposed in As-
sumptions 2.5 and 2.6 are very general which include many types of interconnec-
tions considered in the existing literature as special cases, for example, the intercon-
nections bounded by ﬁrst-order polynomials [3], higher-order polynomials [25, 38].
Compared with the work in [3, 56], no matching conditions are imposed in Assump-
tions 2.5 and 2.6. Furthermore, the kth subsystem’s state variables xk are allowed to
appear in the higher-order polynomials in Assumptions 2.5 and 2.6.
Remark 2.29 In the literature, the decentralized robust stabilization problem has
been addressed for a class of large-scale nonlinear systems of the form (2.178). In
what follows, we consider the same problem for a wider class of large-scale systems
with more than one input and less restrictions on interconnections.

2.6.3 Robust Control Design
We now look for designing decentralized robust controllers for the large-scale sys-
tem (2.174). The design will be carried out step by step.
1. Consider system (2.174) with m = 1, that is
˙xj = f j(xj,ξj
11) + Ψ i1
10(¯xN, ¯ξN
1 ,θ)ξ j
11,
ξ j
11 = ξj

1,r1−1(¯xN, ¯ξN
1 ,θ),
ξj
1r1 = uj
1 + Ψ j
1r1(¯xN, ¯ξ N
1 ,θ),
where Φi1
10 and Ψ j
1d satisfy the following conditions:
∥Φi1

t=1
Ψ ikt

11|t,
(2.180)
which follows from Assumptions 2.5 and 2.6. It is readily seen that system (2.178) is
quite general. Furthermore, conditions (2.179) and (2.180) are less restrictive due to
the presence of the higher polynomial terms |ξj
1s|t in (2.180) and the interconnection
terms ∥xk∥t in (2.179) and (2.180). With Assumption 2.4, (2.179) and (2.180), an
appropriate design procedure can be applied to system (2.178), the result can be
summarized by the following lemma:
Lemma 2.7 Consider system (2.178) with Assumption 2.4 and (2.179) and (2.180).
There exist a change of coordinates zj
1d = ξ j

(2.182)
along the solutions to system (2.178) with uj
1 = uj
1(xj, ¯ξj
1r1).
Remark 2.30 Note that Lemma 2.7 is an extension of the results given in the liter-
ature. The proof presented there can be modiﬁed to verify Lemma 2.7. However, a
major modiﬁcation should be made, that is, the terms like |ξ j
1s| should be expressed
in terms of xj and zj
1d for d = 1,...,s. Observe that αj
1,s−1 can be put into the form
αj
1,s−1 = ¯αj
1,s−1,0(xj)xj +
s−1

d=1
¯αj
1,s−1,d(xj,ξj
11,...,ξ1d)zj
1d
due to the smoothness of αj
1,s−1 and αj
1,s−1(0) = 0. It follows from
ξj
1s = zj
1s + αj
1,s−1(xj,ξj
11,...,ξj
1,s−1)
that
ξj
1s = zj

s−1

d=1
¯αj
1,s−1,d(xj,ξj

which implies, according to Lemma 2.8 in Sect. 2.6.5, that
|ξ j
1s|t ≤(s + 1)t−1[|zj

1,s−1,0(xj)∥t∥xj∥t]

From the foregoing analysis, we have the following result for system (2.174):

(2.174) can be globally asymptotically stabilized by decentralized robust control

For this purpose we choose V = 1
2p(x1)2, p > 0. Then, a simple calculation
shows that
∂V
∂x1 [−x1 −(x1)3] ≤−p(x1)2 −p
2 (x1)4
which implies that Assumption 2.4 is satisﬁed. In addition, it is not difﬁcult to prove
that Assumptions 2.5 and 2.6 are satisﬁed as well. Therefore, the design procedure
developed in Sect. 2.6.3 is applicable. Note that the approach in [81] cannot be used
to solve the problem for (2.190) because there exist interconnected terms, that is, the
last terms in the ﬁrst equation, the second equation, the fourth equation, the sixth
equation, and the eighth equation of system (2.190).
First, consider the following system:
˙x1 = −x1 −(x1)3 + ξ 1

Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems I
2.6.5 Proof of Lemma 2.8
Lemma 2.8
(a1 + ··· + an)t ≤nt−1(|a1|t + ··· + |an|t).
Proof It is obvious that
(a1 + ··· + an)t ≤(|a1| + ··· + |an|)t.
Set ¯a = (|a1| + ··· + |an|)/n and f (x) = xt for t ≥1 and x ≥0. Because f (x)
is c∞function, by Taylor expansion, there exists a real value ξ between x and ¯a,
satisfying
f (x) = f (¯a) + ˙f (¯a)(x −¯a) + 1
2
¨f (ξ)(x −¯a)2
which implies that
f (x) ≥f (¯a) + ˙f (¯a)(x −¯a)
because ¨f (ξ)(x −¯a)2 ≥0. Therefore
f (|an|) ≥f (¯a) + ˙f (¯a)(|a1| −¯a),
...
f (|an|) ≥f (¯a) + ˙f (¯a)(|an| −¯a).
Adding all these equations together gives
|a1|t + ··· + |an|t ≥nf (¯a) = n(¯a)t = (|a1| + ··· + |an|)t
nt−1
which implies that
(a1 + ··· + an)t ≤(|a1|t + ··· + |an|)t
≤nt−1(|a1| + ··· + |an|t).

2.7 Notes and References
This chapter provided a critical overview of decentralized control techniques for
classes of nonlinear interconnected continuous-time systems. The area of nonlinear
control is so wide to accommodate new and research directions along the productive
ideas [9, 19, 22, 23, 29, 40, 42, 43, 45, 46]. In particular, the topic of nonlinear
interconnected discrete-time systems has not been fully investigated in the literature.

In this chapter, we start our examination of the development of decentralized control
techniques for interconnected systems where we focus on the classes of nonlinear
continuous-time systems. We focus on interconnected minimum-phase nonlinear
systems with parameter uncertainty and bounded and/or strong nonlinear intercon-
nections. The objective is to design a robust decentralized controller such that the
closed-loop large-scale interconnected nonlinear system is globally asymptotically
stable for all admissible uncertain parameters and interconnections. The design is
recursive in nature. By employing H∞performance, the solution of the decentral-
ized control problem is attained via the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) inequalities.
Finally, a decentralized output-feedback tracking problem with disturbance atten-
uation is addressed for a new class of large-scale and minimum-phase nonlinear
systems. Application of decentralized stabilization and excitation controls of multi-
machine power systems are demonstrated.
3.1 Introduction
Large-scale systems consisting of a set of small-interconnected subsystems can be
found in many applications such as electric power systems, industrial manipulators,
computer networks, etc. The centralized control of large-scale systems is usually
infeasible due to the requirement of a formidable amount of information exchange.
Hence, decentralized control, a control law based only on local information, is often
preferable [46]. Certainly, because of the interconnections among subsystems the
design of a decentralized control is in general, more difﬁcult than that of a central-
ized control.
On the other hand, exact modeling is usually impossible for physical systems,
not to mention large-scale systems due to their complexity. Therefore, a decentral-
ized control design which takes into account possible modeling uncertainties is of
practical signiﬁcance. Usually, the uncertainties for large-scale interconnected sys-
tems appear not only in local subsystems but also in interconnections. Decentral-
ized robust control for interconnected linear systems with uncertainties satisfying

Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems II
the so-called strict matching conditions has been investigated in [6, 11, 12, 44,
45] and references cited therein. The interconnections among subsystems treated
in these papers are mostly bounded by ﬁrst-order polynomials. It was pointed out
in [44, 45] that interconnected systems with a decentralized control based on the
ﬁrst-order bounded interconnections may become unstable when the interconnec-
tions are of higher order. In [15], decentralized robust stabilization was considered
for large-scale systems with interconnections bounded by some nonlinear functions
and uncertainties satisfying the so-called matching conditions. Very recently, fol-
lowing the development of centralized control of nonlinear systems [17, 27, 32],
a decentralized adaptive control for a class of large-scale interconnected nonlinear
systems was proposed in [21] where the strict matching condition was relaxed and
higher-order interconnections among subsystems were introduced. Notice that the
system under consideration in [21] is assumed to be exactly linearizable and have a
linear parameterization of uncertain parameters and/or disturbances.
In this section, we investigate the problem of decentralized robust control for a
wider class of large-scale nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainty and non-
linear interconnections. Each subsystem of the interconnected system is assumed
to be partially feedback linearizable and minimum phase. The uncertain parameters
and/or disturbances are allowed to be time-varying and enter the system nonlinearly.
The nonlinear interconnections are bounded by general nonlinear functions of the
zero-dynamics and outputs of other subsystems. Inspired by the recent work of cen-
tralized nonlinear control [7, 17, 29, 32, 42], we show that decentralized global
robust stabilization can be achieved for the uncertain interconnected large-scale
systems by employing a recursive controller design method. Our result relies on
a proper construction of Lyapunov function for the interconnected systems. A nu-
merical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust
decentralized control technique.
3.1.1 System Description
Consider a large-scale nonlinear system comprised of N interconnected subsystems
with time-varying unknown parameters and/or disturbances entering nonlinearly
into the state equation. The ith subsystem is given as
˙zj = fj0(zj,xj1) + φj0(zj, ¯xj0,Zj,Yj;θ)xj1,
˙xj1 = xj2 + φj1(zj, ¯xj1,Zj,Yj;θ),
˙xj2 = xj3 + φj2(zj, ¯xj2,Zj,Yj;θ),
...
(3.1)
˙xj,rj −1 = xj,rj + φj,rj −1(zj, ¯xj,rj−1,Zj,Yj;θ),
˙xj,rj = vj + φj,rj (zj, ¯xj,rj ,Zj,Yj;θ),
yj = xj1,

3.1
Introduction

where
¯xj,k = [xj1 xj2 ... xjk]t,
¯xj0 = xj1,
xj = ¯xjrj ,
(zj,xj) is the state vector of the jth subsystem with
zj ∈ℜnj −rj ,
Zj = [zt
1 zt
2 ... zt
j−1 zt
j+1 ... zt
N]t,
Yj = [y1 y2 ... yj−1 yj+1 ... yN]t,
and vj ∈ℜis the control input, yj ∈ℜis the output, θ is a vector of unknown,
time-varying piecewise continuous parameters and/or disturbances which belong to
a known compact set Ω. The vector ﬁelds fj0 and φjk are smooth with fj0(0,0) = 0
and φjk(0,0,0,0;θ) = 0, ∀θ ∈Ω, 1 ≤j ≤N, 0 ≤k ≤rj. Observe that the vector
(φjk), k = 0,1,2,...,rj, represents the interconnections of the jth subsystem with
the other subsystems.
In what follows, we consider the decentralized robust control problem for a
wider class of interconnected systems with partially feedback linearizable subsys-
tems and nonlinear parameterization of time-varying parametric uncertainty. Ob-
serve from (3.1) that the interconnections involve the zero-dynamics and outputs of
other subsystems.
Remark 3.1 Similar to the centralized case discussed in [29, 34], the zero dynamics
of each subsystem in (3.1) are independent of the uncertain parameter vector θ. For
notional simplicity, in the sequel, we assume that nj = n, rj = r, 1 ≤j ≤N. Then,
by considering yj = xj1, system (3.1) becomes
˙zj = fj0(zj,xj1) + φj0(zj, ¯xi0,Zj,Xj1;θ)xj1,
˙xj1 = xj2 + φj1(zj, ¯xj1,Zj,Xj1;θ),
˙xj2 = xj3 + φj2(zj, ¯xj2,Zj,Xj1;θ),
...
˙xj,r−1 = xj,r + φj,r−1(zj, ¯xj,r−1,Zj,Xj1;θ),
˙xj,r = vj + φj,r(zj, ¯xj,r,Zj,Xj1;θ),
(3.2)
where Xj1 = Yj = [x11 x21 ... xj−1,1 xj+1,1 ... xN1]t.
We make the following assumptions for system (3.2).
Assumption 3.1 There exist some smooth real-valued functions
Vj0(zj),
j = 1,2,...,N
which are positive deﬁnite and proper (radially unbounded), such that
∂Vj0
∂zj
fj0(zj,0) ≤−νj∥zj∥2,
1 ≤j ≤N
(3.3)
for some positive real numbers νj > 0.

jkℓ(·), ℓ= 1,2,...,N, 0 ≤k ≤r, 1 ≤j ≤N
are nonnegative smooth functions with ζ 0
jkℓ(·) = ζ 1
jkℓ(·) ≡0.
Remark 3.2 Note that by the well-known converse Lyapunov theorem, the zero dy-
namics of each subsystem are globally asymptotically stable if and only if there
exists a positive deﬁnite and proper Lyapunov function Vj0 such that
(∂Vj0/∂zj)fj0(zj,0) < 0,
∀zj ̸= 0.
Indeed, the requirement (3.3) is more restrictive than this. However, a globally expo-
nentially minimum-phase nonlinear system (that is, the zero-dynamics of the system
are globally exponentially stable) always satisﬁes condition (3.3).
Remark 3.3 The interconnections in Assumption 3.2 are very general, including
many types of interconnections considered in existing literature as special cases, for
example, interconnections bounded by linear (ﬁrst-order) polynomials [6, 11] and
higher-order polynomials [45]. Furthermore, unlike the work in [6, 11, 15, 45], no
matching conditions are imposed for system (3.2).
In the sequel, we deal with the decentralized global robust stabilization prob-
lem for system (3.2) satisfying Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2. More precisely, we are
concerned with the design of decentralized robust control laws vj = vj(zj,xj),
j = 1,...,N, such that the overall closed-loop interconnected system (3.2) with
the control laws is globally asymptotically stable for all admissible uncertainties
and interconnections.
3.1.2 Robust Control Design
In this section, we shall show that the interconnected system of (3.2) is globally
asymptotically stabilizable by decentralized state feedback controllers. It is demon-
strated that the decentralized robust controllers can be constructed effectively by
employing a Lyapunov-based recursive design procedure.
To establish the main result, we shall ﬁrst present the following lemma which
provides the ﬁrst step of the induction in the construction of robust decentralized
state feedback control laws of system (3.2).

Lemma 3.1 Consider the ﬁrst two state equations of system (3.2):
˙zj = fj0(zj,xj1) + φj0(zj,xj1,Zj,Xj1;θ)xj1,
˙xj1 = xj2 + φj1(zj,xj1,Zj,Xj1,θ),
(3.5)
yj = xj1,
satisfying Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2. Then, there exists a smooth function x∗
j2(zj,xj1)
with x∗
j2(0,0) = 0 such that system (3.5) with the control xj2 = x∗

a smooth K∞-function and a smooth function to be chosen. Moreover,
fj00(zj) = fj0(zj,0),

with βj0ℓand βj1ℓbeing positive scaling constants.
Proof Since fj0(zj,xj1) of (3.5) is a smooth vector with fj0(0,0) = 0, there exists
a smooth vector fj1(zj,xj1) such that
fj0(zj,xj1) = fj00(zj) + fj1(zj,xj1)xj1,

where bj(.,.) is a smooth function to counteract the effect of the interconnections
and yet to be determined. Then, (3.7) is obtained and the proof of Lemma 3.1 is
completed.

Remark 3.4 Considering the case when r = 1, that is, xj2 = vj in (3.5) is the ac-
tual control input. Then it can be easily shown that the design functions bj(.,.)
and Wj(·),j = 1,2,...,N can be chosen such that the decentralized state feedback
control vj = x∗
j2(zj,xj1) solves the robust decentralized stabilization problem.

Next, we proceed to establish the systematic recursive design methodology for con-
structing robust decentralized control laws for the system (3.2) when r ≥2. We need
this technical result.

□
By applying Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2, the construction of robust decentralized control
law which stabilizes the uncertain interconnected nonlinear systems (3.2) can be
readily completed. This is seen by the following theorem:
Theorem 3.1 Consider the uncertain interconnected system (3.2) satisfying As-
sumptions 3.1 and 3.2. There exists a decentralized control law, vj = vj(zj,xj),
j = 1,2,...,N, such that the overall system under the decentralized controller is
globally asymptotically stable for all admissible uncertainties and interconnections.
A suitable decentralized controller is given by
vj = x∗
j,r+1(zj, ¯xj,r) = −Mjr −˜xj,r−1 −˜xjr,
(3.27)
where Mjr is given in (3.25) with m + 1 = r.
Proof Based on Lemma 3.1, it follows that Lemma 3.2 is satisﬁed. Extending on
this and applying Lemma 3.2 repeatedly until the rth step, we readily obtain a
Lyapunov-based recursive decentralized control law. Therefore, we can construct
x∗

Due to the onto-relation between (zj,xj) and (zj, ˜xj), where ˜xj = (˜xj1,..., ˜xjr),

can be selected a priori before the recursive design of the robust decentralized sta-
bilization controller. Moreover, Theorem 3.1 provides a decentralized global stabi-
lization result for uncertain interconnected minimum-phase nonlinear systems with
parametric uncertainty and interconnections bounded by general nonlinear func-
tions. This result essentially extends existing centralized results in [29, 32] to de-
centralized control of interconnected systems.
3.1.4 Simulation Example 3.1
Consider an interconnected system composed of two subsystems:
• subsystem 1:
˙z1 = −2z1 + z1x11,
˙x11 = x12 + x11z1 sinθ1 + x2
21z2 cosθ2
1 ,
˙x12 = u1 + x2
12(x11z1 + z2
1)sinθ1 + x21z2 cos(θ1z1),
• subsystem 2:
˙z2 = −z2 + x2
21,
˙x21 = x22 + (x2
11z1 + x2
21z2)sin(z2θ2),
˙x22 = u2 + x2
22(x11z2
1 + x21z2
2)sinθ2 + x2
22z3
2 cos(θ2
2 z2
2),
where θ1,θ2 ∈[−2,2].
It is easy to verify that the interconnections in the system under consideration
satisfy Assumption 3.2. Initially, set βjkm = 1,j,k,m = 1,2. It follows from (3.32)
and (3.33) that
Δ11 = Δ12 = Δ21 = Δ22 = 0,
D11 = 0,
D12 = 2x2
21z2
2 + z2
2,
D21 = 2x2
11z2
1 + z4
1,
D22 = 0.
Letting V10 = 1
2z2
1 and V20 = 1
2z2
2. Then,
∂V10
∂z1
f10(z1,0) = −2z2
1;
∂V20
∂z2
f20(z2,0) = z2
2.
It is readily evident that Assumption 3.1 is satisﬁed with ν1 = 2 and ν2 = 1.
From (3.35), it follows that
κ11(V10) = κ21(V10) = κ12(V20) = κ22(V20) = 0.

By selecting k1 = k2 = 3, then we have from (3.36) and (3.37):
dW1
dV10
= 4,
dW2
dV20
= 5,
b1 = D11 + D21,
b2 = D12 + D22.
It follows from (3.11) and (3.13) that
α11 = x2
11 + 0.25,
α21 = x2
21
and
M11 = dW1
dV10

11,
M21 = dW2
dV20
z2x21 + 0.5x21 + x21α21 + 0.25α2
21.
Using (3.10), the virtual control is now computed as
x∗
12 = −M11 −b1x11 −2x11,
x∗
22 = −M21 −b2x21 −2x21.
Next, letting ˜xj2 = xj2 −x∗
j2,j = 1,2, we obtain

a22 = −∂x∗

According to (3.22), we can select
α12 = x2
12(z2
1 + 0.25),
α22 = x2
22z2
2.
It then follows from (3.25) that
M12 = a12 + ˜x12(4(ψ1
12)2α2
11 + α2
12 + α12) + 0.5˜x12((ψ1
12)2 + (ψ2
12)2),
M22 = a22 + ˜x22(4(ψ1
22)2α2
21 + α2
22 + α22) + 0.5˜x22((ψ1
22)2 + (ψ2
22)2x4
22).
The decentralized control law can be obtained from (3.26) as follows:
u1 = −x11 −M12 −˜x12,
u2 = −x21 −M22 −˜x22.

Introduction
111
The interconnected system under consideration was simulated with the developed
decentralized controller in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the decentral-
ized robust control design procedure. The initial conditions were set to be
z1 = 1.0,
x11 = −1.0,
x12 = 1.5,
z2 = 1.0,
x21 = −1.0,
x22 = 1.5
and the uncertainties θ1 and θ2 are given by θ1 = 2sint and θ2 = 2cost2. It is quite
evident that the uncertainties are time-varying ones and belong to the set [−2,2].
The closed-loop responses for the two subsystems are plotted in Figs. 3.1 and 3.2
from which the stability is clearly assured.

3.2 Global Almost Disturbance Decoupling
We have learned before that the decentralized stabilization problem for intercon-
nected linear systems with uncertainties satisfying the so-called strict matching con-
ditions has been investigated in [6, 11, 45, 46], and references therein. It has been
customary to treat the interconnections among subsystems to be bounded by ﬁrst-
order polynomials of state. In [15], decentralized robust stabilization was considered
for interconnected systems bounded by some nonlinear functions with matching un-
certainties.
3.2.1 Introduction
The decentralized H∞control problem for linear systems has been considered in
[37] where it was shown that the design of each local H∞control law depends on
the solution of a higher-order algebraic Riccati equation associated with the overall
interconnected system. In [55] a design approach was provided for composite lin-
ear systems. In spite of signiﬁcant advance in centralized H∞control for nonlinear
systems [2, 19, 52] and references therein—few results on decentralized H∞con-
trol of interconnected nonlinear systems are available in the literature. Note that all
these results on H∞control of nonlinear systems require solution of the Hamilton-
Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) partial differential equations, which imposes an intricate dif-
ﬁculty and especially in practical applications. On the other hand, the problems
of global disturbance attenuation and almost disturbance decoupling for a class of
nonlinear systems with lower triangular structure [19, 33]. An interesting feature of
these results is that a solution of the HJI equations or inequalities is not required.
However, their basic limitation is that there was no penalty on control efforts which
in turn represents a serious drawback as it would result in a poor dynamic perfor-
mance and large control effort. This issue has been addressed in [20], where a global
L2-gain design methodology was developed for minimum-phase nonlinear systems
in the lower triangular form. In the light of the results in [30, 52], the relationship
between an L2-gain of a nonlinear system and that of its linearized system has be-
come quite transparent. Accordingly, if the H∞control problem for the linearized
system is solvable, one can ﬁnd a local solution to the H∞control problem of the
original nonlinear system. The pioneering results of [20] suggest that for lineariz-
able systems or minimum-phase nonlinear systems with triangular structure, the
solution to the problem of disturbance attenuation for the linearized system sufﬁces
to determine a feedback law that solves the global disturbance attenuation problem
with internal stability for the corresponding nonlinear system. Note that in [20],
a weighting function is ﬁxed a posteriori and only the problem of inverse global
L2-gain analysis is addressed, that is, determine a weighting function r(x) and a
globally stabilizing feedback law α(x) (constructed by starting from the solution of
a strict Riccati inequality) that solve the problem of global H∞disturbance attenu-
ation.

3.3
Decentralized H∞Control
113
In what follows, a global decentralized H∞control problem via state feedback
control for a class of interconnected nonlinear systems is investigated. First, we con-
sider a rather general interconnected nonlinear system with strong nonlinear inter-
connections. The global decentralized H∞control problem of the system is shown
to be converted into the centralized H∞control problems for a set of auxiliary non-
linear systems without interconnections. It is well known that solutions to the latter
problems are related to the HJI equations. This result extends the decentralized H∞
control problem for linear interconnected systems to the nonlinear case.
Bearing in mind the difﬁculty of solving HJI equations globally, a global decen-
tralized almost disturbance decoupling problem (DADDP) is considered for a class
of interconnected systems which are transformable to interconnected systems with
lower triangular structure. It is then shown that a solution to the DADDP can be
obtained via recursive design technique. We focus next on the H∞control prob-
lem. Speciﬁcally, a set of decentralized state feedback control laws as well as state-
dependent weights of the control inputs are sought such that the associated global
H∞control problem is solvable.
3.3 Decentralized H∞Control
Consider a large-scale nonlinear system composed of N interconnected subsystems
of the form
˙xj = Aj(xj) + Bj(xj)uj + pj(xj)ωj + hj(xj),
yj = Cj(xj),
(3.39)
zj = (yt
jyj + ut
jRj(xj)uj)
1
2 ,j = 1,2,...,N,
where xj ∈ℜnj is the state of jth subsystem, j = 1,2,...,N, x = [xt
1 ... xt
N]t
is the state of the overall interconnected system, uj ∈ℜmj , ωj ∈ℜqj and zj ∈ℜ
are the control input, the disturbance input and the penalty output, respectively. The
functions
Aj(xj),
Bj(xj),
Cj(xj),
pj(xj),
Rj(xj)
are smooth with appropriate dimensions and satisfy
Aj(0) = 0,
Cj(0) = 0,
hj(0) = 0,
ℜj(xj) ≥0,
∀xj ∈ℜnj .
Assumption 3.3 The nonlinear interconnections
hj(x) = [hj1(x) hj2(x) ... hjnj (x)]t
are bounded by
|hjk(x)| ≤ηjk(xj)
N

ℓ=1
ζjkℓ(xℓ),
(3.40)

Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems II
where ηjk(xj), ζjkℓ(xℓ), 1 ≤k ≤nj, 1 ≤j,ℓ≤N, are nonnegative continuous
functions with ζjkℓ(0) = 0.
Remark 3.6 It is interesting to note that the interconnections hj(xj), j = 1,2,...,N
in Assumption 3.3 are quite general and include, as special cases the interconnec-
tions bounded by linear ﬁrst-order polynomials [6, 11, 15] and higher-order poly-
nomials [15]. In addition, no matching conditions are imposed.
We direct attention to the global decentralized H∞control problem for the
system (3.39) satisfying Assumption 3.3. Formally, given scalars γj > 0, j =
1,2,...,N, we are interested in the design of local decentralized control laws,
uj = uj(xj), j = 1,2,...,N, at the subsystem level such that the overall closed-
loop interconnected system (3.39) is globally asymptotically stable and the L2-gain
from the disturbance ω = [ωt
1 ... ωt
N]t to the controlled output z = [zt
1 ... zt
N]t is
less than γ = [γ1 ... γN]t in the following sense

for all ωj ∈L2[0,∞), where δ(x0) is a real-valued function of the initial state x0 =
[xt
1(0) ... xt
N(0)]t satisfying δ(0) = 0.
Remark 3.7 In stating the foregoing problem, γj, j = 1,2,...,N, can be regarded
as the prespeciﬁed level of H∞disturbance attenuation for each sub-system. When
γj = γ0, ∀j, (3.41) becomes
∥z∥2
2 ≤γ 2
0 ∥ω∥2
2 + δ(x0)
(3.42)
for all ωj ∈L2[0,∞), where z = [z1 z2 ... zN]t and ω = [ωt
1 ... ωt
N]t.
In this case, a standard decentralized H∞control problem is recovered.
To pave the way toward a result on decentralized nonlinear H∞control, it is cru-
cial to recall the deﬁnition of global disturbance attenuation for nonlinear systems.
For this purpose, consider a nonlinear system of the form
˙x = A(x) + B(x)u + p(x)ω,
y = C(x),
(3.43)
z = (yty + utR(x)u)
1
2 ,
where ω ∈ℜq,u ∈ℜm and z ∈ℜare the disturbance input, the control input and the
penalty output, respectively, with A(0) = 0, C(0) = 0 and R(x) ≥0 for all x ∈ℜn
and pose the following

3.3

Deﬁnition 3.1 Given a real number γ > 0, system (3.43) is said to have global
H∞disturbance attenuation γ if there exists a feedback control laws u = α(x) with
α(0) = 0 such that, for some proper function V (x) > 0, the HJI matrix inequality

is satisﬁed for all nonzero x.
Remark 3.8 It is well known that if (3.44) holds, then the feedback law u = α(x)
globally asymptotically stabilizes the equilibrium x = 0 of the system (3.43) when
ω = 0, and render the L2-gain from ω to z less than or equal to γ [52].
Associated with the interconnected system (3.39), we introduce the following

It must be noted that Theorem 3.2 established that the decentralized H∞con-
trol problem for interconnected nonlinear systems can be cast into the associated
centralized H∞control problems whose solutions are related to the HJI equations.
This result naturally extends the decentralized H∞control of interconnected linear
systems [55] to the nonlinear case.
3.3.1 The Local Disturbance Problem
Next we will look at the local disturbance problem. In particular, we examine the
possibility that the local solution of the decentralized H∞control problem of the

system (3.39) can be obtained by solving the H∞control problem for the linearized
system of (3.39).
Toward our goal, consider the linear interconnected system given by
˙xj = Ajxj + Pjωj + Bjuj + Γj

ωj ∈ℜqj is the disturbance input, zj is the controlled output, with Rj > 0 and
the matrices
Aj,
Bj,
Cj,
Pj,
Γj,
ζjℓ
are constants with appropriate dimensions.
Following the earlier development, we associate with the system (3.49) an auxil-
iary linear systems of the form:
˙xj = Ajxj + [Pjβ

The following theorem provides a solution to the decentralized H∞control prob-

Theorem 3.3 Given some real numbers γj > 0 and matrices Rj > 0, i = 1,2,
...,N, consider the interconnected linear system (3.49). Suppose that, for each i,
there exist some constants βℓ, ℓ= 1,2,...,N, and a feedback control law uj =
Kjxj with Kj ∈ℜpj×nj , such that the resulting closed-loop system of (3.50) is
asymptotically stable and the L2-gain from ˜ωj to ˜zj is less than γj. Then, the decen-
tralized control laws uj = Kjxj, 1 ≤j ≤N, asymptotically stabilize the intercon-
nected linear system (3.49) and render its L2-gain from the disturbance input ω =
[ωt

the proof of Theorem 3.2, we reach the desired result.
□
Remark 3.9 It is a simple task to prove, based on the ﬁrst assumptions of Theo-
rem 3.3, that the solution to the decentralized H∞control problem of the linear
interconnected system (3.49), namely Vj = xt
jYjxj and uj = Kjxj, actually satis-
ﬁes the HJI inequality (3.46) for all x in a neighborhood of x = 0, see [30, 52]. In
turn, the solution of the H∞control problem for the linearized system of (3.39)
also yields a local solution of the H∞control problem for the non-linear sys-
tem (3.39).
3.3.2 Results for Non-minimum Phase Systems
Consider a class of interconnected nonlinear systems which are transformable to
interconnected nonlinear systems extended form [21]:
˙χj = fj0(χj,ξj1) + Pj0(χj,ξj1)ωj + φj0(χj,ξj1;Xj1),
˙ξj1 = ξj2 + pj1(χj,ξj1)ωj + φj1(χj,ξj1;Xj1),
˙ξij2 = ξj3 + pj2(χj, ¯ξj2)ωj + φj2(χj, ¯ξj2;Xj1),

(3.52)
˙ξj,τj −1 = ξj,τj + pj,τj −1(χj, ¯ξj,τj−1)ωj + φj,τj−1(χj, ¯ξj,τj −1;Xj1),
ξj,τj = uj + pj,τj (χj, ¯ξj,τj )ωj + φj,τj (χj, ¯ξj,τj ;Xj1),
yj = Cj(χj,ξj1),
where
χj ∈ℜnj−τj ,
¯ξjk = [ξj1 ξj2 ... ξjk]t,
i = 1,2,...,N, j = 1,2,...,τj,
Xj1 = [ξ11 ξ21 ... ξj−1,1 ξj+1,1 ... ξN1]t,

and Cj(χj,ξj1) are smooth with
φjk(0;0) = 0,
Cj(0,0) = 0,
k = 0,...,τj, j = 1,...,N.
The following assumptions about (3.52) are made [18, 49]:
Assumption 3.4 The χj-subsystem of the ith subsystem in (3.52) can be decom-
posed into two cascade-subsystems as follows:
˙χj1 = fj01(χj,ξj1) + pj01(χj,ξj1)ωj + φj01(χj,ξj1;Xj1),
(3.53)
˙χj2 = fj02(χj2,ξj1),
where χj = [χt
j1 χt
j2]t with χi1 ∈ℜnj1, χj2 ∈ℜnj2 and nj1 + nj2 = nj −τj.
Assumption 3.5 There exists a smooth real-valued positive deﬁnite and proper
function Vi01(χi1) such that
∂Vj01
∂χj1
{fj01(χj,ξj1) + φj01(χj,ξj1;0) + [pj01(χj,ξj1) β

≤−αj01∥χj1∥2 + γ 2
i0∥˜ωj∥2 + kj1(χj2,ξj1)
(3.54)
for some deﬁnite function kj1(χj2,ξj1), some positive real numbers αj01,β and
γj0 and ˜ωj ∈L2[0,∞), where Inj1 is the identity matrix of dimensions nj1 × nj1,
j = 1,2,...,N.
Assumption 3.6 There exist a smooth real-valued function νj02(χj2) with
νj02(0) = 0, and a smooth real-valued proper function νj02(χj2) > 0, such that
∂Vj02
∂χj2
fj02(χj2,νj02(χj2)) ≤−αj02(χj2),
(3.55)
αj02∥χj2∥2 ≤Vj02(χj2)
for some real numbers αj02 > 0 and αj03 > 0.
Assumption 3.7 The control output yj of the system (3.52) can be expressed in the
form
yj = Cj0(χj2,ξj1),
(3.56)
where Cj0(χj2,ξj1) is a smooth real function with Cj0(0,0) = 0.
Assumption 3.8 The nonlinear interconnections in (3.52) are bounded by strong
nonlinearities in Xj1
∥φj01(χj, ¯ξjk;xj1) −φj01(χj, ¯ξjk;0)∥≤

where ηjk(χ, ¯ξjk) and ζjkℓ(ξℓ1), 0 ≤k ≤τj, 1 ≤j,ℓ≤N, are smooth functions
with ζjkℓ(0) = 0.
Remark 3.10 It is noted that Assumption 3.5 amounts to the input-state stability
with respect to the disturbance input ωj and bounded-input bounded-state stability
with respect to χj2 and ξj1, whereas Assumption 3.6 implies that the subsystem χj2
is asymptotically stabilized by the feedback ξj1 = νj02(χj1). Interestingly enough,
these assumptions are similar to those in centralized H∞control [18].
In what follows, we proceed to deal with the global DADDP for the intercon-
nected nonlinear system (3.52) phrased as follows:
Given any real numbers γj > 0, j = 1,2,...,N, it is desired to ﬁnd decentralized
feedback laws uj = αj(xj), αj(0) = 0, such that the overall closed-loop system
is internally asymptotically stable with the L2-gain between the disturbance input

for all ωj ∈L2[0,∞) and all admissible nonlinear interconnections, where δ(x0) is
a function of the initial state x0 satisfying δ(0) = 0.
Taking into account Assumption 3.8 and noting that ζjkℓ(ξℓ1),j = 1,2,...,N,
k = 0,1,2,...,τj, ℓ= 1,2,...,N, are smooth with ζjkℓ(0) = 0, there exist smooth
functions ˜ζjkℓ(ξℓ1) such that
ζjkℓ(ξℓ1) = ˜ζjkℓ(ξℓ1)ξℓ1.
Now, turning to Theorem 3.2 and introducing an auxiliary systems associated
with (3.52) satisfying Assumptions 3.4–3.8 of the form:

In view of Theorem 3.2, the following theorem is easily established:
Theorem 3.4 Consider the interconnected system (3.52) satisfying Assump-
tions 3.4–3.8. Given any γj > 0, j = 1,2,...,N, suppose that, for some βj > 0, the
control law uj = uj(xj) with uj(0) = 0 solves the almost disturbance decoupling
problem for the system (3.59), that is, uj globally asymptotically stabilizes the sys-
tem (3.59) and render the L2-gain from the disturbance ˜ωj to the penalty output ˜yj

xj0 satisfying δ(0) = 0. Then given γ = [γ1 ...γN] with γj > 0, the same control
laws uj = uj(xj) will solve the global DADDP for the interconnected system (3.52).
Remark 3.11 It is quite evident from Theorem 3.4 that the global decentralized
almost disturbance decoupling for interconnected non-minimum phase nonlinear
system (3.52) is converted into the global almost disturbance decoupling problem

3.4
Global Inverse Control of Nonlinear Systems
123
for the system (3.59) without interconnections. The latter problem can be solved
by a recursive Lyapunov-based design approach [18, 49], which does not involve
solving HJI equations (inequalities). In this way, the developed design procedure is
systematic and applicable to wide class of interconnected systems.
3.4 Global Inverse Control of Nonlinear Systems
In Sect. 3.3, it has been shown in principle that a global solution to the problem
of decentralized H∞nonlinear control can be obtained from the global solutions
of the HJI inequalities (3.46). The HJI inequalities are generally difﬁcult to solve
and for technical reasons it is usually impossible to solve the HJI inequality of the
form (3.46) globally.
An alternative way is to study the problem of global inverse H∞control rather
than the regular global H∞control problem. In this way, the aim is to seek not
only a set of decentralized feedback control laws but also weighting functions for
control inputs such that the associated H∞problem is solvable globally for a class
of interconnected nonlinear systems.
To put the main issues in proper perspectives, we consider a class of intercon-
nected non-linear systems which are transformable to interconnected nonlinear sys-
tems of the form:
˙xj1 = xj2 + pj1(xj1)ωj + φj1(xj1;Xj1),
˙xj2 = xj3 + pj2(¯xj2)ωj + φj2(¯xj2;Xj1),
...
(3.60)
˙xj,nj−1 = xj,nj + pj,nj −1(¯xj,nj−1)ωj + φj,nj−1(¯xj,nj −1;Xj1),
˙xj,nj = uj + pj,nj (¯xj,nj )ωj + φj,nj (¯xj,nj ;Xj1),
yj = xj1,
where uj ∈ℜis the local control input,
¯xjk = [xj1 xj2 ... xjk]t,
j = 1,2,...,N, j = 1,2,...,nj,
Xj1 = [x11 x21 ... xj−1,1 xj+1,1 ... xN1]t,
Pi1(xi1),...,Pinj (¯xinj ) and φj1(xj1;Xj1),...,φjnj (¯xj,n1;Xj1) are smooth with
φjk(0;0) = 0, j = 1,...,N, k = 1,...,nj.
For simplicity in exposition, we consider nj = n, 1 ≤j ≤N, and express the
system in the following form:
˙xj = Ajxj + fj(xj) + pj(xj)ωj + Bjuj + hj(xj;Xj1),
(3.61)
yj = Cjxj,

The following assumption is made:
Assumption 3.9 The nonlinear interconnections hj(xj;Xj1), j = 1,2,...,N,
in (3.61) are bounded by nonlinearities in Xj1:
|φjk(¯xjk;Xj1) −φjk(¯xjk;0)| ≤
N

ℓ=1;ℓ̸=i
|ηjk(¯xjk)||ζjkℓ(xℓ1)|,
(3.62)
where ηjk(¯xjk) and ζjkℓ(xℓ1), 1 ≤k ≤n, 1 ≤j,ℓ≤N, are smooth functions with
ζjkℓ(0) = 0.
It must be emphasized that Assumption 3.9 represents a fairly general form of
interconnections which includes those in [6, 11, 45, 46] as special cases.
In the sequel, we shall focus on the global decentralized inverse control problem
of nonlinear systems, phrased as follows:
Given some real numbers γj > 0, j = 1,2,...,N, it is desired to ﬁnd decen-
tralized feedback laws uj = αj(xj),αj(0) = 0, and some continuous functions
0 ≤rj(xj) such that the overall closed-loop system is internally asymptotically

∀ωj ∈L2[0,∞) and all admissible nonlinear interconnections, where δ(x0) is a
function of the initial state x0 satisfying δ(0) = 0.
In view of Assumption 3.9 and observing that
ζjkℓ(xℓ1),
j = 1,2,...,N, k = 1,2,...,n, ℓ= 1,2,...,N, ζjkℓ(0) = 0,
are smooth, there exist smooth functions

A solution to the global decentralized inverse control problem for the intercon-
nected nonlinear system (3.61) is summarized in the following theorem:
Theorem 3.5 Consider the interconnected system (3.61) satisfying Assumption 3.9
and given ¯rj > 0, j = 1,2,...,N be constant weighting factors. Suppose that,
for each j, there exists a linear feedback law uj = Kjxj for (3.64) which in-
ternally stabilizes the system and render its L2-gain, between the disturbance in-
put ˜ωj and the penalty output ˜zj = ( ˜yt

ber γj > 0. There exist weighting factors rj(xj), continuously depending on xj
and satisfying rj(0) = ¯rj and 0 ≤rj(xj) ≤¯rj, and smooth decentralized feed-
back control laws αj(xj), i = 1,2,...,N, for (3.61) which globally stabilize the
interconnected system (3.61) and render its L2-gain, between the disturbance in-

Proof Using Theorem 3.2 and extending the result of [20, 60] backward and for-
ward to system (3.64) and (3.63) with lower triangular structures, Theorem 3.5 can
be readily established. Details are given in [20].
□
Remark 3.12 Theorem 3.5 presents a constructive solution to the global decentral-
ized inverse control problem based on an explicit use of the weighting factors, the
proper, positive deﬁnite Lyapunov functions and the decentralized control laws sat-
isfying the HJI inequalities (3.46). The key point lies in overcoming the strong non-
linear interconnections by casting the decentralized H∞control problem into an
associated centralized H∞control. The latter is then solved by extending the result
in [20].
Remark 3.13 It is signiﬁcant to assure that at the equilibrium point xj = 0, j =
1,2,...,N, the constructed Lyapunov functions, the decentralized nonlinear con-
trol laws and the control weighting factors reduce to those associated with the de-
centralized H∞control of the linearized interconnected system. Looked at in this

light, Theorem 3.5 provides an important link between the linear (local) decentral-
ized H∞control of linearized interconnected system (the interconnected nonlinear
system) and the global H∞control of the interconnected nonlinear system.
3.4.1 Disturbance Attenuating Trackers
In what follows, we continue our study to interconnected nonlinear systems with
output measurements. This problem, usually referred to as decentralized output-
feedback control, is technically challenging because of the lack of a general theory
for nonlinear observer design and the nonlinear version of the well-known Separa-
tion Principle. The central focus is three-fold:
(i) identifying a wide class of large-scale nonlinear systems in disturbed decen-
tralized output-feedback form;
(ii) proposing an improved systematic output-feedback controller design proce-
dure for decentralized systems in the presence of strong nonlinearities appear-
ing in the subsystems and interactions;
(iii) guaranteeing decentralized asymptotic tracking when the disturbance inputs
disappear and achieving desirable external stability properties when the distur-
bance inputs are present.
In this regard, we record that constructive control design methods for classes of
highly nonlinear systems were developed in [17, 24, 27, 34]). In a related work on
decentralized adaptive control, the work of [23] presents a systematic method for
a class of interconnected systems under matching conditions and weakly nonlinear
disturbances. The results of [23] have been generalized in various ways in [11, 15,
45, 59]). In most of the available results, the trend has been to restrict the location
of uncertainties [11, 15, 45] and impose growth conditions on the subsystem and
interacting nonlinearities [11, 13, 22, 43, 45, 59].
In this section, we proceed to extend recent developments in nonlinear L2-gain
feedback control [17, 23, 33, 35, 51] to the important problem of asymptotic track-
ing with disturbance attenuation property within the context of interconnected non-
linear systems with output measurements. In the sequel, we assume that the unmea-
sured states appear linearly. To reconstruct the unmeasured states, an effective full-
order decentralized observer is introduced. On the basis of an enlarged decentral-
ized system comprising the observer, an output-feedback decentralized controller is
designed via the recursive backstepping technique. In order to achieve the desired
control objective of asymptotic tracking with disturbance attenuation for the decen-
tralized system in question, a non quadratic Lyapunov function is used and turns out
to be necessary.

Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems II
3.4.2 System Description
Consider a large-scale nonlinear system comprised of N interconnected subsystems
with time-varying unknown parameters and/or disturbances entering nonlinearly
into the state equation. The ith subsystem is given as
˙Xj = Fj(Xj) + Gj(Xj)uj + Λj1(y1,...,yN)Xj + Λj2(y1,...,yN)wj,
(3.65)
yj = hj(Xj),
(3.66)
where 1 ≤j ≤N, Xj ∈ℜNj , uj ∈ℜand yj ∈ℜrepresent the state, the control in-
put and the output of the local ith subsystem, respectively, and wj ∈ℜnwj is the dis-
turbance input. The functions Fj, Gj, hj, Λj1, Λj2 are sufﬁciently smooth. In the
absence of the interacting terms Λj1 and Λi2, the system (3.65)–(3.66) reduces to
an isolated SISO system. From the literature, we found various constructive control
algorithms developed for wide classes of centralized nonlinear systems in special
normal forms. It is quite naturally to seek similar results in the decentralized con-
text, that is, in the presence of strong interactions among local systems of the form
(3.65)–(3.66). For the simplicity in exposition, we will examine the following class
of interconnected dynamic systems of the type (3.65)–(3.66) which is transformable
to
˙zj = Qjzj + fj0(y1,...,yN) + pj0(y1,...,yN)wj,
˙xj1 = xj2 + fj1(y1,...,yN) + gj1(y1,...,yN)zj + pj1(y1,...,yN)wj,
...
(3.67)
˙xjnj = uj + fjnj (y1,...,yN) + ginj (y1,...,yN)zj + pjnj (y1,...,yN)wj,
yj = xj1,
where for each 1 ≤j ≤N,zj ∈ℜnzj and xj = (xj1,...,xjnj ) ∈ℜnj are the states
of the jth transformed subsystem. For every j,Qj is a constant matrix with appro-
priate dimension, fjk,gjk and pjk are known and smooth functions. The following
minimum-phase condition is recalled.
Assumption 3.10 For every 1 ≤j ≤N,Qj is a Hurwitz matrix.
Remark 3.14 We assert that the structure of (3.67) is commonly seen in the literature
in both centralized and decentralized control [11, 15, 17, 22, 27, 34, 40, 45, 59]. Em-
ploying elements of geometric nonlinear control [17, 24, 27, 34], necessary and suf-
ﬁcient conditions were derived under which the nonlinear system (3.65)–(3.66) can
be transformed into (3.67), the so-called “disturbed decentralized output-feedback
form”. The nonlinearities in (3.65) depend only on the output y = (y1,...,yN) and
that the unmeasured states Xj or (zj,xj2,...,xjnj ) in (3.67) appear linearly. This
feature is quite standard in recent studies on global output-feedback control for both
centralized and decentralized nonlinear systems. Simple counterexamples in [36]

3.4
Global Inverse Control of Nonlinear Systems

revealed the fundamental limitation of global output-feedback control for systems
with strong nonlinearities due to unmeasured states.
We now address the following control problem:
For every 1 ≤j ≤N and a given time-varying signal yjr(t) whose derivatives up to
order nj are bounded over [0,∞), it is desired to design a smooth, decentralized,
dynamic, output-feedback controller of the form
˙xj = νj(xj,yj,t),
uj = μj(xj,yj,t),
xj ∈ℜ¯nj
(3.68)
such that the following properties hold for the closed-loop large-scale nonlinear
system (3.67)–(3.68):
1. When wj = 0 for all 1 ≤j ≤N, the tracking error yj −yir goes to zero asymp-
totically and all other closed-loop signals remain bounded over [0,∞).
2. When wj ̸= 0 for all 1 ≤j ≤N, the closed-loop system is bounded-input
bounded-state (BIBS) stable and, in appropriate coordinates, is integral-input-
to-state stable (iISS) with respect to the disturbance input w [47]. In particular,
there exists a class-K function γd (that is, γd is continuous, strictly increasing
and vanishes at the origin) such that, for any ρ > 0, the controller (3.68) can be
tuned to satisfy the inequality
 t
t0
|y(τ) −yr(t)|2 dτ ≤ρ
 t
0
γd(|w(τ)|)dτ + η0(z(0),x(0),x(0))
∀t ≥0,
(3.69)
where η0 is a nonnegative C0 function, and z(0) = (zt
1(0),...,zt
N(0))t,x(0) =
(xt
1(0),...,xt
N(0))t and x(0) = (xt
1(0),...,xt
N(0))t.
Property 1 means that decentralized asymptotic tracking is achieved for each
local jth subsystem (3.67) in the absence of disturbance inputs. Note in Property 2
that (3.69) implies, in the presence of disturbances, that the decentralized output-
feedback controller (3.68) has the ability to attenuate the effect of the disturbances
on the tracking error arbitrarily for a ﬁxed class-K gain-function γd, later on we
have γd(s) = s2 + s4 + s8.
3.4.3 Output Feedback Tracking
The control problem addressed before will be solved in the sequel in two steps.
We ﬁrst introduce a “partially” decentralized observer to produce an augmented
decentralized system with partial-state information. Then, we base the decentralized
controller design on this enlarged dynamic system.

Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems II
3.4.4 Partially Decentralized Observer
Owing to the structure in every local system of (3.67), for each 1 ≤j ≤N, we
introduce the following state estimator for the (zj,xj)-subsystem:
˙ˆzj = Qj ˆzj + fj0(y1r,...,yNr),
˙ˆxj1 = ˆxj2 + Lj1(yj −xj1) + fj1(y1r,...,yNr) + gj1(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj,
...
ˆxjnj = uj + Ljnj (yj −ˆxj1) + fjnj (y1r,...,yNr) + gjnj (y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj,
(3.70)
Aj =
⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎣
−Lj1
−Lj2
Inj −1
...
−Ljnj
0 ... 0
⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎦.
(3.71)
Notice that the eigenvalues of Aj can be assigned to any desired location in the open
left-half plane via the choice of appropriate constants {Ljk}
nj
k=1, provided complex
conjugate eigenvalues appear in pair. In (3.71), Inj −1 is the unit matrix of order
nj −1.
Introducing the new variables
˜zj = zj −ˆzj,
˜xijk = xjk −ˆxjk,
1 ≤k ≤nj, 1 ≤i ≤N.
(3.72)
From (3.67) and (3.70), it follows that:
˙˜zj = Qj ˜zj + fj0(y1,...,yN) −fj0(y1r,...,yNr) + pj0(y1,...,yN)wj, (3.73)
˙˜xj = Aj ˜xj + fj(y1,...,yN) −fj(y1r,...,yNr)
+ gj(y1,...,yN)zj −gj(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj + pj(y1,...,yN)wj,
(3.74)
where
˜xj = (˜xj1,..., ˜xjnj )t,
fj = (fj1,...,fjnj )t,
gj = (gj1,...,gjnj )t,
pj = (pi1,...,pjnj )t.
Since every fjk is a smooth function and every yjr is a bounded signal, there exist
a ﬁnite number of nonnegative smooth functions {ϕj0k}N
k=1, {ϕjk}N
k=1 such that
|fj0(y1,...,yN) −fj0(y1r,...,yNr)| ≤
N

k=1
|˜xk1|ϕj0k(˜xk1),
(3.75)
|fj(y1,...,yN) −fj(y1r,...,yNr)| ≤
N

k=1
|˜xk1|ϕjk(˜xk1).
(3.76)

3.4
Global Inverse Control of Nonlinear Systems
131
In a similar way, we can obtain a functional bound for
gj(y1,...,yN)zj −gj(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj.
Indeed, we have
gj(y1,...,yN)zj −gj(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj
= gj(y1,...,yN)˜zj + (gj(y1,...,yN) −gj(y1r,...,yNr))ˆzj.
(3.77)
By the Mean Value Theorem, there exist nonnegative smooth functions φjk (1 ≤
k ≤N) such that
|gj(y1,...,yN)zj −gj(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj|
≤|gj(y1,...,yN)||˜zj| +
N

k=1
|˜xk1|φjk(˜xk1)|ˆzj|.
(3.78)
Combining these inequalities (3.75), (3.76) and (3.78), it is easy to show, in the
absence of disturbance inputs, that the solutions (˜zj(t), ˜xj(t)) of the cascade sys-
tem (3.73)–(3.74) go to zero, if yj(t) −yjr(t) →0 for all 1 ≤j ≤N. The latter
property will be shown to be guaranteed with the help of the decentralized con-
troller to be designed shortly.
Remark 3.15 It must be emphasized that the observer (3.70) is not asymptotic and is
totally decentralized only if the reference signals yjr = 0 for all 1 ≤j ≤N. There-
fore, we select a partially decentralized observer so that; in appropriate coordinates;
system (3.79) has an equilibrium point and consequently, there is a solution to de-
centralized asymptotic tracking. When yjr(t) are general time-varying signals, the
augmented system with a totally decentralized observer does not have a ﬁxed equi-
librium. In effect, only practical tracking can be achieved by means of high-gain
feedback [46].
3.4.5 Controller Design Procedure
From the development of partially decentralized observers, we derive the following
controller-observer combined system for feedback design:
˙˜zj = Qj ˜zj + fj0(y1,...,yN) −fj0(y1r,...,yNr) + pj0(y1,...,yN)wj,
˙˜xj = Aj ˜xj + fj(y1,...,yN) −fj(y1r,...,yNr)
+ gj(y1,...,yN)zj −gj(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj + pj(y1,...,yN)wj,
˙yj = ˆxj2 + ˜xj2 + fj1(y1,...,yN) + gi1(y1,...,yN)zj
(3.79)
+ pj1(y1,...,yN)wj,

132
3
Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems II
˙ˆxj2 = ˆxj3 + Lj2(yj −ˆxj1) + fj2(y1r,...,yNr) + gj2(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj,
...
˙ˆxjnj = uj + Ljnj (yj −ˆxj1) + fjnj (y1r,...,yNr) + gjnj (y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj.
Notice that the state variables (yj, ˆxj1, ˆxi2,..., ˆxjnj ), and then ˜xj1, are available for
feedback design. The states (˜zj, ˜xj) are unmeasured and the outputs yj, with k ̸= j,
of other subsystems are unavailable for the design of the regional input uj.
We now direct attention to the jth local system (3.79) with uj being the control
input. For the simplicity in exposition, denote
˜fj0 = fj0(y1,...,yN) −fj0(y1r,...,yNr),
(3.80)
˜fj = fj(y1,...,yN) −fj(y1r,...,yNr),
(3.81)
˜gj = gj(y1,...,yN)zj −gj(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj.
(3.82)
In the sequel, we develop a step-by-step constructive controller design procedure,
leading to an effective solution to the desired decentralized problem and tracking
controllers.
Step j.1.
Start with the ﬁrst (˜zj, ˜xj,yj)-subsystem of (3.79). Introduce the new
variable ξj1 = yj −yjr (= ˜xj1) and consider the proper function
Vi1 = λj1˜zt
jPj1˜zj + λj2(˜zt
jPj1˜zj1)2 + ˜xt
jPj2 ˜xj + 1

satisfy the local Lyapunov equations
Pj1Qj + Qt
jPj1 = −2Inzj ,
(3.84)
Pj2Aj + At
jPj2 = −2Inj .
(3.85)
Evaluating the time derivative of Vj1 along the solutions of (3.79) it yields
˙Vj1 = (λj1 + 2λj2˜zt
jPj1˜zj)(−2|˜zj|2 + 2˜zt
jPj1( ˜fj0 + pj0wj))
−2|˜xj|2 + 2˜xt

+ fj1(y1,...,yN) + gj1(y1,...,yN)zj
+ pj1(y1,...,yN)wj −˙yjr.
(3.86)
Focusing on the term 2˜zt
jPj1( ˜fj0 + pj0wj) and using (3.80) and (3.75), with the
help of Young’s inequality (see Chap. 10) and after some tedious calculations, it

In a similar way, there exist positive constants κj1,cj4 and a smooth function

It must be noted that κj1 does not depend on λj1 and λj2 while cjk’s may depend
on λj1 and λj2. Proceeding further, using (3.76) and (3.78), we have

3.4.6 Control Design Results
By applying the foregoing design procedure to the uncertain interconnected sys-
tem (3.67), we establish the following result.

Theorem 3.6 The problem of decentralized output-feedback tracking with distur-
bance attenuation is solvable for the minimum-phase interconnected system (3.67)
subject to Assumption 3.10.

tem (3.67) with (3.104), it yields

λ = min{λa,λc,kjℓ},
1 ≤j ≤N, 1 ≤ℓ≤nj.
Applying the Gronwall Lemma [27] to (3.110), the BIBS condition and iISS
property 2 follow immediately for the transformed closed-loop system (3.67) with
(3.104). Moreover, when wj ≡0, ∀1 ≤j ≤N, the null solution is uniformly glob-
ally asymptotically stable, leading to the asymptotic convergence of the tracking
error y −yr because ξ1 = y −yr. It must be emphasized that same result could have
been attained by following parallel procedure to [48].
Finally from (3.108), for any pair of instants 0 ≤t0 ≤t, we obtain

min{kj1|1 ≤j ≤N}

and observe that ρ can be made as small as possible by selecting sufﬁciently large
values of the constants kj1. In the present case, (3.69) is met with γd(s) = s2 +
s4 + s8 which completes the proof of Theorem 3.6.
□
The following remarks stand out:
Remark 3.16 It is of interest to note that, in the absence of disturbance inputs w,
(3.110) eventually yields that V converges to zero at an exponential rate and; there-
fore; the tracking error y(t) −yr(t) goes to zero exponentially.
Remark 3.17 In centralized output-feedback tracking with almost disturbance de-
coupling [35], Assumption 3.10 can be weakened and the zj-system in (3.67) can
be broadened as follows:
˙zj = Γj(y1,...,yN)zj + fj0(y1,...,yN) + pj0(y1,...,yN)wj.
(3.112)
Considering that, for each 1 ≤j ≤N, there are a pair of constant, matrices (0 <
P t
j = Pj, 0 < Mt
j = Mj) such that
Γ t
j (y1,...,yN)Pj + PjΓj(y1,...,yN) ≤−Mj.
(3.113)
Under this condition, the ˆzj-system in the decentralized observer (3.70) is replaced
by
˙ˆzj = Γj(y1r,...,yNr)ˆzj + fj0(y1r,...,yNr).
(3.114)
By using the same techniques as in Sect. 3.4.5, Theorem 3.6 can be extended to this
situation.
3.4.7 L2-Gain Disturbance Attenuation
In what follows, we examine whether the controller design procedure yields a de-
centralized output-feedback law guaranteeing the standard L2-gain disturbance at-
tenuation property, that is, (3.69) holds with γd(s) = s2. In this case, the following
additional sufﬁcient condition is needed.
Assumption 3.11 For all 1 ≤j ≤N and 1 ≤k ≤nj, the function pjk is bounded
by a constant. Furthermore, pj0 = 0 for each 1 ≤j ≤N.

140

Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems II
Proposition 3.1 Under Assumptions 3.10 and 3.11, the problem of decentralized
output-feedback tracking with standard L2-gain disturbance attenuation is solvable
for the class of minimum-phase interconnected systems (3.67).
Proof It sufﬁces to note that the only place where |wj|4 and |wj|8 occur are Step j.1
during the controller development in Sect. 3.4.5. These terms are entered into the
inequalities (3.87) and (3.88). Under Assumption 3.11, the function Vj1 satisﬁes the
following inequality, in replace of (3.95):
˙Vj1 ≤−(λj1 + λj2˜zt

˙V ≤−λV +
N

j=1
[(nj + cj2 + cj4)|wj|2].
(3.116)
Finally, from (3.116), the standard L2-gain property from w to ξ1 = y −yr follows
readily. This concludes the proof of Proposition 3.1.
□
Remark 3.18 As a corollary of Theorem 3.6, the standard L2-gain property from w
to ξ1 = y −yr can similarly be proven when all functions fjk, gjk in decentral-
ized system (3.67) are bounded by linear functions and the functions pjk (1 ≤j ≤
N, 0 ≤k ≤nj, pi0 ̸= 0) are bounded by some constants. The resulting decentral-
ized output-feedback controllers would be linear.
3.5 Application to Power Systems
Power systems are increasingly called upon to operate transmission lines at high
transmission level due to economic considerations. In a lot of cases, transient stabil-
ity transfer limits are more constraining than steady-state limits under contingency.
On the other hand, operating conditions of modern large scale power systems are
always varying to satisfy different load demands. The control systems are therefore
required to have the ability to damp the system oscillations that might threaten the
system stability as load demands increase or after a major fault occurs, and maintain
the system stability under a diversity of operating conditions and different system
conﬁgurations.
In the design of conventional control systems, approximately linearized power
system models are employed. Normally, the system is simpliﬁed as single-machine

3.5
Application to Power Systems
141
to inﬁnite bus model and approximately linearized at one operating point. Then con-
ventional controllers are designed based on the simpliﬁed linear model. It is obvious
that when a major fault occurs, the behavior of the power system may change signif-
icantly. Conventional linear controllers do not guarantee the system stability under
such circumstances.
In recent years, a great deal of attention has been given to the control of power
systems using the recent developed nonlinear control theory, particularly to improve
system transient stability [1, 40, 47, 48]. Rather than using an approximately lin-
earized model as in the design of the usual power system stabilizer, nonlinear models
are used and nonlinear feedback linearization techniques are employed to linearize
the power system models, thereby alleviating the operating point dependent nature
of the linear designs. Using nonlinear controllers, power system transient stability
can be improved signiﬁcantly. However, nonlinear controllers are of more com-
plicated structure and harder to be implemented in practice compared with linear
controllers. In addition, feedback linearization schemes need exact plant parame-
ters to cancel the inherent system nonlinearities and make the stability analysis a
formidable task. The design of decentralized linear controllers to enhance the sta-
bility of interconnected nonlinear power systems within the whole operating region
is still a challenging task [41].
In this section, we will consider the linear controller design problem of an
N-machine nonlinear power system. Unlike the approximately linearized model
normally used, a nonlinear fourth order classical model, including the gover-
nor/turbine dynamics of multi-machine power systems, will be considered. Robust
control technique [53, 55, 56, 62, 63], will be employed to develop a linear control
scheme for power system transient stability enhancement. Nonlinear interconnec-
tions are treated similar to parametric uncertainties [57] and the control of each
generator is derived separately by solving an algebraic Riccati equation. Although
the proposed scheme is a decentralized linear controller, it can guarantee the stabil-
ity of the nonlinear power system model in the whole operating region. The design
of the controller only requires local measurements and can be easily implemented.

may be unknown and when a major fault occurs at the transmission line between ith
generator and jth generator, the parameter bij will change. Thus, the model contains
parameter uncertainties. Also the power system model contains nonlinearities and
interconnections gij(xj,xj). The problem addressed hereafter is phrased as follows:

Pcj (t) = −Kjxj(t),
j = 1,2,...,N −1,
for multimachine power system (3.117) such that the resulting closed-loop system is
transiently stable when a major fault occurs in the system.
3.5.2 Robust Stabilization
Consider the parameter uncertainties in multimachine power systems, the plant
model (3.117) can be generalized as follows:

+
N

m=1,m̸=1
{pjm[Gjm + ΔGjm(t)]gjm(xj,xj)},

where for the jth subsystem we have that: xj ∈ℜnj is the state, uj ∈ℜmj is the
input, the matrices Aj,Bj and Gjm are known real constant matrices of appropriate
dimensions that describe the nominal model, ΔAj(·), ΔBj(·), and ΔGjm(·) are real
time varying parameter uncertainties, and gjm(xj,xj) ∈ℜlj is unknown nonlinear
vector functions that represent nonlinearities in the ith subsystem and the interac-
tions with other subsystems.
The uncertain matrices ΔAj(t), ΔBj(t), and ΔGjm(t) are assumed to be of the
following structure:
[ΔAj(t)ΔBj(t)] = LjFj(t)[E1j ,E2j ],
(3.119)
ΔGjm(t) = LjmFjm(t)Ejm
(3.120)

functions with Lebesgue measurable elements and satisfying

(3.121)
where Lj,E1j ,E2j ,Ljm, and Ejm are known real constant matrices with appropri-
ate dimensions.

Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems II
Remark 3.19 The parameter uncertainty structure in (3.119) has been widely used
in the problem of robust stabilization of uncertain systems [25], and can represent
parameter uncertainties in many physical systems. The decomposition of parameter
uncertainties in the case of a three machine power system will be discussed later on.
The following assumptions concerning the unknown nonlinear vector functions
and the matrix E2j are made:
Assumption 3.12 There exist known constant matrices W j and Wjm such that for
all xj ∈ℜnj and xj ∈ℜnj
∥gjm(xj,xm)∥≤∥W jxj(t)∥+ ∥Wjmxm(t)∥
for all j,m and for all t ≥0.
Remark 3.20 If the nonlinear functions gjm(xj,xm) satisfy Assumption 3.12,
they are Lipschitz bounded nonlinearities. In the power system model (3.117),
gjm(xj,xm) satisfy Assumption 3.12. A three machine example system will be pre-
sented in Sect. 3.5.3 and the detailed analysis will be given.
Assumption 3.13 For all j = 1,2,...,N −1
Rj = Et
2j E2j ≥0.
Remark 3.21 Assumption 3.13 is made only for simpliﬁcation of presentation. If
Assumption 3.13 does not hold, the results of this section can be easily generalized
using the technique similar to that in [25].
The robust stabilization problem for interconnected system (3.118) is now stated
as follows:
Robust Stabilization Problem: Design decentralized linear time-invariant feedback
control laws uj(t) = −Kjxj(t),j = 1,2,...,N −1, for system (2.2) with uncer-
tainties (3.119)–(3.121) such that the resulting closed-loop system is globally uni-
formly asymptotically stable about the origin for all admissible uncertainties. In
this case, the system (3.118) is said to be robustly stabilizable via the decentralized
controllers Kj and the closed-loop system is said to be robustly stable.

A main result on the problem of decentralized robust stabilization is stated as
follows:
Theorem 3.7 Consider the multimachine power system (3.117) satisfying Assump-
tions 3.12 and 3.13. Then, this system is robustly stabilizable via decentralized
linear feedback control if there exist positive scaling parameters νj and λjm,
∀j,m ∈{1,2,...,N} such that for any j = 1,2,...,N −1:
1. λ2

jmEjm < I, ∀m ∈{1,2,...,N}; and
2. there exist positive deﬁnite solutions Pj to (3.122).

whenever x ̸= 0. Hence, V (x) is a Lyapunov function for system (3.125) and thus,
this system is globally uniformly asymptotically stable for all admissible uncertain-
ties. Therefore, the multimachine power system (3.117) is robustly stabilizable via
the decentralized controller (3.124) which concludes the desired result.
□
Remark 3.22 The result shown above can be easily extended to the case where
dynamic output feedback controls are used [58]. From the result obtained, it is
clear that the linear feedback controller (3.124) can ensure the stability of the mul-
timachine power system. The design procedure for the decentralized linear con-
troller (3.124) can be summarized as follows.
1. Formulate the system model (3.117) or (3.118). Find the respective matrices Aj,
ΔAj, Bj, ΔBj, Gj, and ΔGj.
2. Find the structure of the parametric uncertainties deﬁned in (3.119)–(3.121).
3. Construct algebraic Riccati equations as given in (3.122) for all j.
4. Select the scaling parameters νj > 0 and λj > 0 and ﬁnd positive deﬁnite solu-
tion Pj to (3.122). If there exist such kind of Pj, we declare that the algorithm
“succeeds” and a robust decentralized controller is found as given in (3.124).
5. If no positive deﬁnite solution Pj to (3.122) is found, go back to Step 2 and
reformulate the structure of the parametric uncertainties. Repeat Steps 3 and 4. If
no “success” is declared after several trials, we declare that the algorithm “fails”
and abandon the method.
Remark 3.23 The decentralized controller (3.124) is a linear controller. Compared
with nonlinear controllers, linear controllers are of simpler structure and easier to
be implemented.

Since generator #3 is an inﬁnite bus, we have E′

To simplify the analysis, we only consider the parametric perturbations in Gjm
and in TMi. The matrices Gij represent the interconnections and nonlinearities be-
tween generators i and j, and uncertainties in parameters TMj are used to emulate
the time constant uncertainties in the high-pressure (HP) and low-pressure (LP) sec-
tions. The power system model (3.117) can be rewritten as
˙x1(t) = (A1 + ΔA1)x1(t) + B1u1(t)

The structure of parametric uncertainties can be expressed as follows.

• For generator #2, the decomposition is similar. It is clear that robust decentralized

be found by using the design procedure described in Remark 3.20.

The fault we consider in the simulation is a symmetrical three-phase short circuit
fault which occurs on one of the transmission lines between generator #1 and gen-
erator #2 with λ being the fraction of the transmission line to the left of the fault.
If λ = 0, the fault is on the bus bar of generator #1, λ = 0.5 puts the fault in the
center point of the transmission line between generator #1 and generator #2, and so
on. The fault sequence is as follows.
1. The system is in pre-fault steady-state.
2. A fault occurs at t = 0.1 s.
3. The fault is removed by opening the breakers of the faulted line at t = 0.25 s.
4. The transmission lines are restored with the fault cleared at t = 1.0 s.
5. The system is in post fault-state.
Three different cases are considered in the simulation. In the ﬁrst two cases, the fault
location is λ = 0.05.
• Case 1. The operating points are
δ10 = 67.6°,
Pm10 = 1.2,
Vt1 = 1.0,
δ20 = 67.7°,
Pm20 = 1.1,
Vt2 = 1.0.
The power angles, the real power, and the terminal voltages of the generators #1
and #2 are shown in Figs. 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6, respectively.
• Case 2. The operating points are
δ10 = 24.6°,
Pm10 = 0.3,
Vt1 = 0.95,
δ20 = 48.6°,
Pm20 = 0.9,
Vt2 = 0.95.
The power angles of the generators #1 and #2 are shown in Fig. 3.7.

Pm20 = 1.1,
Vt2 = 1.0.
The power angles of the generators #1 and #2 are shown in Figs. 3.8 and 3.9,
respectively (λ = 0.01,0.5,0.99).
From the simulation results shown above, it can be seen that despite the inter-
connections between different generators, nonlinearities in the system, different op-
erating points and different fault locations, under all situations the proposed robust
decentralized controller can rapidly damp the oscillation of the system and greatly
enhance transient stability of the multimachine power system.

3.6 Decentralized Control with Guaranteed Performance
In what follows, the decentralized excitation control of multimachine power sys-
tems is considered. The power system can be modeled as a interconnected system
with parameter uncertainty and nonlinear interconnections. The main focus is on
the design of a robust decentralized state feedback controller that not only stabilizes
the power system but also achieves suboptimal guaranteed cost performance for all
admissible variations of generator parameters. Following the results of [38, 39] and
references therein, a robust performance analysis result is developed for intercon-
nected systems in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The decentral-
ized guaranteed cost control has been solved using an LMI approach. The results
shown in this section are given in terms of LMIs which can be solved efﬁciently
using the available LMI tool [9]. Furthermore, a procedure is given to minimize an
upper bound of the cost.
3.6.1 Introduction
Power systems are modeled as large-scale nonlinear systems composed of a set of
small interconnected subsystems. It is generally impossible to incorporate many
feedback loops into the controller design for large-scale interconnected systems and
is also too costly even if they can be implemented. These difﬁculties motivate the
development of decentralized control theory where each subsystem is controlled
independently on its locally available information.
On the other hand, the operating conditions of power systems are always varying
to satisfy different load demands. Control systems are therefore required to have the
ability to suppress potential instability and damp the system oscillations that might
threaten the system stability as the load demand increases. However, as power sys-
tems are large-scale nonlinear systems in nature, the applications of conventional

3.6
Decentralized Control with Guaranteed Performance
157
linear control approaches are limited because they can only deal with small dis-
turbances about an operating point and cannot guarantee the system stability when
faults or signiﬁcant changes of operating conditions occur. Since the introduction
of differential geometric tools to nonlinear control system design, various nonlin-
ear feedback controllers have been designed to enhance power system stability, see
e.g. [5, 57]. Naturally, the robustness issue arises in order to deal with uncertainties
which mainly come from the varying transmission line parameters and/or faults.
There are some results on decentralized robust control of multimachine power sys-
tems, e.g. [5–8, 10–24, 26–40, 42–52, 54]. In particular, in [5–8, 10–24, 26–40,
42–52, 54], the multimachine power system is ﬁrst compensated via a decentral-
ized nonlinear direct feedback linearization, then a robust decentralized control is
applied which guarantees the overall stability of the multimachine power system is
the whole working region. Note that the design approach in [54, 57] involves solv-
ing a set of parameterized Riccati equations, which is in general a difﬁcult task.
Furthermore, only a stabilization problem is addressed in [54, 57].
In any control design, a controller is sought not only to stabilize the system hut
also to ensure satisfactory performance of the system. When a quadratic cost is
considered for hear systems, the traditional linear quadratic (LQ) design offers an
optimal solution. Very recently, [25, 38–57, 59–61], was applied this performance
measure in for systems with parameter uncertainty and addressed the problem of
guaranteed cost control. The guaranteed cost control is concerned with the design
of a state feedback controller so that, for all admissible uncertainties, the closed-
loop system is asymptotically stable and an upper bound of the quadratic cost is
minimized. The result of the guaranteed cost control is given in terms of a parame-
terized game-type algebraic Riccati equation which may be difﬁcult to solve in [16,
60] the LQ design has been extended to the decentralized control of large-scale sys-
tems without uncertainties. On the other hand, where the subsystems arc treated as if
they were decoupled, and, under certain conditions placed on the interconnections,
the locally optimal LQ control is obtained and is suboptimal for the overall system.
Note that, when uncertainties arise in both the subsystems and interconnections,
this passive analysis may have difﬁculty in guaranteeing the closed-loop stability
and may be overly conservative.

and the parameters plij, and p2ij, are constants of either 1 or 0 (if they are 0, this
means that the jth subsystem has no connection with the ith subsystem).
Remark 3.24 In (3.139), the parametric uncertainties were considered in generator
parameters T ′
d0i,i = 1,2,...,N, because they vary with load change and changing
network topology.
Remark 3.25 Note that E′
qi, E′
qj, δij and Bij, will change when the network param-
eters and load are changed. For example, Bij will vary when a major fault occurs at
the transmission line between the ith and jth generators. Hence, nonlinear uncer-
tain interconnections exist in multimachine power systems. To estimate the bounds
of the uncertainties in the interconnections, note that the electrical power Pei of each
generator and the electrical power ﬂow through each transmission line are bounded,
and the excitation voltage Ef i may raise by up to 5 times of the Eqi when there is
no load in the system. Thus, by considering (3.134) and (3.131), the following may
be obtained:
|E′

It also follows that
r1ij ≤

|T ′
d0i|min
|Pei|max,
r2ij ≤|Pei|max.
It is obvious that the bounds of r1ij and r2ij only depend on generator parameters
|T ′
d0i|min and |Pei|max.
In this section, the authors are concerned with the design of a decentralized non-
linear feedback controller that will not only enhance the transient stability but also
ensure a certain level of performance of the power system in the presence of operat-
ing point variations, faults in different locations and changing network parameters.
Speciﬁcally, the authors will design a robust decentralized controller for the sys-
tem (3.139) so that, for all admissible uncertainties, the closed-loop interconnected
system is asymptotically stable and an upper bound of a speciﬁed quadratic cost is
minimized. This problem is referred to as a decentralized guaranteed cost control.
Remark 3.26 In [54, 77], a robust stabilization controller has been proposed for the
multimachine power system (3.129)–(3.138) and the result involves solving a set
of parameterized game-type Riccati equations, which imposes a major difﬁculty.
Furthermore, no performance has been taken into consideration for the controller
design.

In this section, the authors present an LMI approach to solve the decentralized guar-
anteed cost control problem for a class of interconnected nonlinear systems. Be-
fore proceeding to address the decentralized controller design, a robust performance
analysis, is ﬁrst presented.
3.6.4 Robust Performance Analysis
Consider the following interconnected large-scale system which consists of N sub-
systems:

(3.141)
where xi ∈ℜni is the state of the ith subsystem, Ai,G1ij, and G2ij are real constant
matrices of appropriate dimensions, ΔAi,ΔG1ij and ΔG2ij, are uncertain matrices,
g1ij(xi,xj) ∈ℜrij and g2ij(xi,xj) ∈ℜsij are unknown nonlinear vector functions
representing the interconnection between the ith subsystem and the jth subsystem,
and the parameters p1ij and p2ij are constants of either 1 or 0 (if they are 0, it means
that the jth subsystem has no connection with the ith subsystem).
In this section, the authors consider the following cost performance for the sys-
tem (3.141):

The authors will make the following assumptions on parameter uncertainties and
interconnections:
Assumption 3.14
ΔAi = H1iFjE1i,
where Fj ∈ℜhj ×ej is an unknown matrix function satisfying
F t

and H1i and E1i are known real constant matrices that structure the uncertainty.

1. Let
ΔG1ij = L1ijF1ijN1ij,
ΔG2ij = L2ijF2ijN2ij,
where F1ij ∈ℜα1ij ×β1ij and F2ij ∈ℜα2ij ×β2ij are unknown matrix functions sat-
isfying
F t
1ijF1ij ≤Iβ1ij ,
F t
2ijF1ij ≤Iβ2ij
and L1ij,L2ij,N1ij and N2ij are known real constant matrices with appropriate
dimensions.
2. There exist known real constant matrices W1i, W1ij, W2i, and W2ij, such that,
for all xi ∈ℜni, xj ∈ℜnj , i,j = 1,2,...,N:
∥g1ij(xi,xj)∥≤∥W1ixi∥+ ∥W1ijxj∥,
∥g2ij(xi,xj)∥≤∥W2ixi∥+ ∥W2ijxj∥.
Introduce the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.1 A set of positive deﬁnite real matrices Pi, i = 1,2,...,N, is said to
be a quadratic cost matrix set for the system (3.141) and the cost function (3.142),
if

The following result shows that the notion of quadratic cost matrix set deﬁnes an
upper bound on the cost function (see (3.142)).
Theorem 3.8 Consider the system (3.141) and the cost function (3.142). Suppose
that Pi > 0, i = 1,2,...,N, is a quadratic cost matrix set for the system. Then, the
uncertain system is quadratically stable and the cost function satisﬁes the bound

This completes the proof of the theorem.
□
Note that the bound obtained in Theorem 3.8 depends on the initial condition
xi(0). To remove this dependence on the initial condition, there are two approaches,
one is the deterministic method [39] and the other is the stochastic approach [38]. In
this section, we will adopt the deterministic approach. Suppose that the initial state
of the system (3.141) is arbitrary but belongs to the set Si ≤{xi(0) ∈ℜni : xi(0) =
Πi0νi,νt
i νi ≤1}. Then, it follows from (3.146) that
J ≤

Before proceeding to obtain the main results, the following key lemma will be
introduced.

symmetrical. Then
Y + HFE + EtF tH t < 0
for all F = diag{F1,F2,...,Fk} with Fj ∈ℜαj×βj satisfying F tF ≤I, if there exist
some positive scalars γj, j = 1,2,...,k, such that

where Γα = diag{γ1Iα1,γ2Iα2,γkIαk} and Γβ = diag{γ1Iβ1,γ2Iβ2,...,γkIβk}.
Proof Note that HFE = HΓ 1/2

The following result provides two sufﬁcient conditions for the existence of quadratic

□
Theorem 3.9 Consider the system (3.141) and the cost function (3.142). Suppose
that there exist a set of matrices Pi > 0, i = 1,2,...,N, such that

Remark 3.27 Theorem 3.9 provides a sufﬁcient condition for the existence of a set
of guaranteed quadratic cost matrices. It gives a suboptimal method for computing
the robust performance measure deﬁned in (3.148). In fact, it follows from Theo-
rem 3.9 that
J∗= inf


i=1
λmax(Πt
i0PiΠi0)|Pi > 0, εi > 0,
γ1ij > 0 and γ2ij > 0 satisfy (2.29)

.
Obviously, J ≤J ∗≤J∗. Hence, J∗provides a suboptimal upper bound for the sys-
tem (2.20) and the cost function (2.21). Note that (2.29) is linear in εi,γ1ij and
γ2ij, i,j = 1,2,...,N, and hence the problem of computing J∗is a standard LMI
problem [4].

where xi ∈ℜni is the state of the ith subsystem, ui ∈ℜmi is the control of the ith
subsystem, Ai, Bi, G1ij and G2ij are real constant matrices with appropriate di-
mensions, ΔAi, ΔBi, ΔG1ij and ΔG2ij are uncertain matrices, g1ij(xi,xj) ∈ℜnij
and g2ij(xi,xj) ∈ℜsij are unknown nonlinear vector functions representing the in-
terconnection between the ith subsystem and the jth subsystem, and the parameters
p1ij and p2ij are constants of either 1 or 0 (if they are 0, it means that the jth
subsystem has no connection with the ith subsystem). ΔG1ij, ΔG2ij , g1ij(xi,xj)
and g2ij(xi,xj) satisfy Assumption 3.15 and ΔAi and ΔBi, satisfy the following
assumption.
Assumption 3.16
[ΔAi ΔBi] = H1iFj[E1i E2i],
where Fj ∈ℜhj ×ej is an unknown matrix function satisfying
F t
jFj ≤Iej
and H1i,E1i and E2i are known real constant matrices with appropriate dimensions.
Remark 3.28 Obviously, the parameter uncertainties and interconnections in the
power system (3.139) satisfy Assumptions 3.15 and 3.16.

Remark 3.29 Note that (3.163) is linear in Xi,Yi,εi,γ1ij and γ2ij, and can be solved
efﬁciently using the LMI tool [12]. Also, it follows from Theorem 3.10 that, if

3.6

171
the LMI (3.163) holds, then the corresponding cost function (3.161) is bounded
by N
i=1 λM(Πt

Πi0). For some given constant λi > 0,λM(Πt

Πi0 > 0
which is equivalent to

(3.167)
Therefore, the problem of minimizing the bound N
i=1 λM(Πt
i0X−1
i
Πi0) becomes
the minimization of N
i=1 λi under the LMI constraints of (3.163) and (3.167). This
is a parametric LMI problem and can be solved effectively by employing the LMI
tool [9].
Remark 3.30 From Theorem 3.10 and the feedback linearized system (3.139), the
excitation control input uf i of the power system (3.129)–(3.131) can be obtained
by an inverse transform of (3.140):
uf i =
1
kciIqi
{νf i + Pmi0 −(xdi −x′
di)IqiIdi + T ′
d0iQciωi},
(3.168)
where νf i = Kixi with Ki = YiX−1
i
. Note that Iqi = 0 is not in the normal work-
ing region for a generator, so uf i is well deﬁned. On the other hand, in power sys-
tems, Pei,Qei and If i are readily measurable variables, thus it follows from (3.132),
(3.136) and (3.137) that Idi and Iqi can be calculated by using these available vari-
ables. As δi and ωi, i = 1,2,...,N, are also measurable variables, the excitation
control (3.168) is practically realizable by only using the local measurements.
3.6.6 Simulation Results
The decentralized guaranteed cost control design proposed in the preceding section
is now applied to a three-machine power system as shown in Fig. 3.10. Generator 3
is an inﬁnite bus bar used as the reference (E′
q3 = constant = 1∠0◦). The system
parameters used in the simulation are given in Table 3.1.
For the purpose of illustration, the authors consider the parametric perturbation
as ΔT ′
d0i = 0.1T ′
d0i, i = 1,2, and choose |Pe1|M = 1.4 and |Pe2|M = 1.5. Thus, the
DFL compensated power system model (2.18) can be rewritten as follows:
˙x1 = (A1 + ΔA1)x1 + (B1 + ΔB1)νf 1
+ ΔG112 sin(δ1 −δ2) + ΔG211ω1 + ΔG212ω2,
(3.169)
˙x2 = (A2 + ΔA2)x2 + (B2 + ΔB2)νf 2
+ ΔG121 sin(δ2 −δ1) + ΔG221ω1 + ΔG222ω2,

In the performance index (3.161), the authors set Q1 = Q2 = 0.05I, R1 = 0.002
and R2 = 0.001. In the light of Remark 3.29, by solving the corresponding LMIs

3.6
Decentralized Control with Guaranteed Performance

(see (3.163)), the decentralized guaranteed cost controller is obtained as
νf 1 = 46.6023(δ1 −δ10) + 48.7572ω1 −245.4968(Pe1 −Pm10), (3.171)
νf 2 = 59.6959(δ2 −δ20) + 65.0159ω2 −244.7198(Pe2 −Pm20)
(3.172)
and the minimal upper bound of the cost is 1.7676. Thus, the original excitation
control laws for the three-machine power system are as follows:
uf 1 = 1
Iq1
{νf 1 + Pm10 −(xd1 −x′
d1)Iq1Id1 + T ′
d01Qe1ω1},
(3.173)

(3.131) becomes

The excitation control input limitations are
−6 ≤Ef i = kciuf i ≤6,
i = 1,2.
This example shows the effectiveness of the proposed decentralized control un-
der different operating points, fault locations and transmission-line parameters. The
fault under consideration is a symmetrical three-phase short-circuit fault that occurs
on one of the transmission lines between generators 1 and 2. The fault location is
indexed by a constant λ, which is the fraction of the line to the left of the fault.
For example, λ = 0 means that the fault is on the bus bar of generator 1, whereas
λ = 0.5 indicates that the fault happens midway between generators 1 and 2. The
fault sequence under consideration is as follows:
1. The system is in pre-fault steady state;
2. A fault occurs at t0 = 0.1s;
3. The fault is removed by opening the circuit breakers of the faulted line at t1 =
0.25 s;

4. The transmission line is restored with the fault clear at t2 = 1.0 s;
5. The system is in post fault state.
The system dynamic responses can be tested under the following cases of different
operating points, fault locations and network parameters.
1. The operating points are
δ10 = 60.78°,
Pm10 = 1.1 p.u.,
Vt1 = 1.0 p.u.,
(3.178)
δ20 = 60.64°,
Pm20 = 1.0 p.u.,
Vt2 = 1.0 p.u.
(3.179)
The fault location is λ = 0.07. The corresponding closed loop system responses
of power angles, relative speeds, real powers and excitation control signals of
generators 1 and 2 are shown in Figs. 3.11–3.14.
In particular, the responses of power angles are given in Figs. 3.15 and 3.16
for comparison: in Fig. 3.15, where the fault location is A = 0.07, the open-
loop system without controller is unstable; in Fig. 3.16, where the fault location

is λ = 0.09. The open-loop system without controller is stable, but it exhibits
signiﬁcant oscillations. From Figs. 3.15 and 3.16, it is obvious that the proposed
controller can enhance the system transient stability and damp out the power
angle oscillations.
2. The operating points are
δ10 = 18.51°,
Pm10 = 0.3 p.u.,
Vt1 = 0.95 p.u.
(3.180)
δ20 = 23.68°,
Pm20 = 0.4 p.u.,
Vt2 = 0.95 p.u.
(3.181)
The fault locations is λ = 0.1. The corresponding closed loop system responses
of power angles and relative speeds of generators 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 3.17.
3. The operating points are the same as in Case 1. The corresponding closed-loop
system responses of power angles are compared with different fault locations
(λ = 0.07, 0.5, 0.95) in Fig. 3.18.
4. The transmission-line parameters are deﬁned by the following:
x12 = X13 = X23 = 0.7.

The operating points are as follows:
δ10 = 64.08°,
Pm10 = 0.95 p.u.,
Vt1 = 10 p.u.,
(3.183)
δ20 = 65.33°,
Pm20 = 0.95 p.u.,
Vt2 = 1.0 p.u.
(3.184)
The fault location is λ = 0.1. The corresponding closed loop system responses
of power angles and real powers of the generators 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 3.19.
The simulation results shown here clearly indicate that the proposed controller
can enhance the system transient stability and damp out the power angle oscillations
in the face of different conditions of operating points, fault locations and transmis-
sion parameters.

Decentralized Control of Nonlinear Systems II
3.7 Notes and References
In this chapter, a new robust decentralized controller has been proposed to enhance
multimachine power system transient stability. The proposed controller is a linear
controller that can guarantee system stability over the whole operating region. The
controller design procedure is derived. In the design of the controller, the fault loca-
tion and exact network parameters do not need to be available. The proposed con-
troller uses local measurements through a simple implementation. A three-machine
power system is considered as an application example of the theory developed in
this chapter. Simulation results show that despite the nonlinear interconnections be-
tween generators and signiﬁcant operating condition variations following the faults,
the proposed controller can rapidly damp the system oscillation and greatly enhance
the power system transient stability.
Moreover, an LMI-based robust decentralized guaranteed cost control approach
has been proposed for multimachine power systems. Our results are given in terms
of a set of LMIs which can be solved efﬁciently by using the available LMI tool.
A procedure has been given for the optimization of an upper bound of the per-
formance index. The proposed robust control scheme is demonstrated on a three-
machine example power system. Simulation results have shown that the transient
stability is greatly enhanced regardless of different operating points, faults in vari-
ous locations and changing network parameters.
There are several directions of extending the results reported in this chapter. Chief
among these is the class of interconnected discrete-time systems, for which there is
virtually no results available.

Chapter 4
Decentralized Systems with Multi-controllers
This chapter looks at particular classes of decentralized systems that incorporate
multiple controllers in their basic operation. Three distinct types of these systems
are identiﬁed: multi-channel time-delay systems, interconnected networked systems
and discrete-systems with saturating controllers. In the ﬁrst two types, the mathe-
matical analysis treats initially with interconnected time-delay systems to develop
general delay-dependent stability and stabilization results. Then, several interest-
ing cases are derived. The subsystems are subjected to convex-bounded parametric
uncertainties and/or additive feedback gain perturbations. The third type is con-
cerned with stabilization decentralized linear saturating plants. The basic tool is the
construction use of appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. We characterize
decentralized linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)-based conditions. Resilient decen-
tralized dynamic output-feedback stabilization schemes are designed such that the
family of closed-loop feedback subsystems enjoys the delay-dependent asymptotic
stability with a prescribed γ -level L2 gain for each subsystem.
4.1 Introduction
There are many real world systems consisting of coupled units or subsystems which
directly interact with each other in a simple and predictable fashion to serve a com-
mon pool of objectives. When viewed as a whole, the resulting overall system often
displays rich and complex behavior. Typical examples are found in electric power
systems with strong interactions, water networks which are widely distributed in
space, trafﬁc systems with many external signal or large-space ﬂexible structures,
to name a few, which are often termed large-scale or interconnected systems. It be-
comes increasingly evidently that the underlying notions of interconnected systems
manifest the complexity as an essential and dominating problem in systems theory
and practice and that several associated problems cannot be tackled using one-shot
approaches. Recent research investigations have revealed [3, 22] that the crucial
need for improved methodologies relies on:

(1) dividing the analysis and synthesis of the overall system into independent or
almost independent subproblems,
(2) searching for new ideas of coping with the incomplete information about the
system, and
(3) seeking appropriate methods of handling the uncertainties and for dealing with
delays.
System complexity frequently leads to severe difﬁculties that are encountered in
the tasks of analyzing, designing, and implementing appropriate control methods.
These difﬁculties arise mainly from the following well-known reasons: dimension-
ality; information structure constraints; uncertainty; delays. Pertinent results can
be found in [2, 25, 26, 41, 43, 49–51, 72].
4.2 Decentralized Stabilization of Multi-channel Systems
In this section, we direct attention to a type of decentralized systems described by a
class of linear multi-channel time-delay systems with norm-bounded uncertainties
and time-varying delays is examined. The objective is to design a class of decentral-
ized dynamic output-feedback controllers to render the closed-loop multi-channel
system delay-dependent asymptotically stable with a prescribed disturbance attenu-
ation level.
4.2.1 Introduction
The basic concepts of large scale or interconnected systems have been introduced
to deal with the real control problems that cannot be solved using one-shot (cen-
tralized) approaches [43, 56–61, 72]. Typical problems arise in the control of water
systems which are widely distributed in space, interconnected power systems with
strong interactions, trafﬁc systems with different external signals, or large-scale ﬂex-
ible structures. The structures of such systems have led to the development of new
ideas for dividing the analysis and synthesis of the overall system into indepen-
dent (or almost independent) subproblems and for dealing with limited information,
uncertainties and time-delays. Therefore in the past few decades, the analysis and
design problems of decentralized control for large scale or interconnected systems
have been intensively studied [27, 79]. In particular, the linear matrix inequalities
(LMIs) framework [8] has appeared to be very attractive to tackle the control and
ﬁltering problems of handling interconnected systems [3].
This section develops new results for the problems of decentralized analysis and
control synthesis for a class of linear interconnected multi-channel systems. This
class includes linear time-delay systems subject to input disturbance and several
control agents where the system matrices are allowed to undergo bounded para-
metric uncertainties. The design objective is to construct robust dynamic output-
feedback controllers and derive easily-computable formula for determining the

gains. Previous related results are reported in [10, 15, 80] where the main focus
has been on delay-free systems using state-feedback. It turns out that the results of
[10, 15, 80] are essentially a special case of the approach developed hereafter. We
employ a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) approach to developed the closed-
loop stabilization conditions and with the aid of a convex optimization framework,
LMI-based conditions are obtained.
4.2.2 Problem Statement
We consider a class of linear uncertain systems Σ with N channels and represented
by the state-space model:
˙x(t) = [A + ΔA]x(t) + [Ad + ΔAd]x(t −τ(t)) +
N

j=1
Bjuj(t) + Γ w(t), (4.1)
z(t) = Gx(t) + Gdx(t −τ(t)) + Φw(t),
(4.2)
yj(t) = [Cj + ΔCj]xj(t),
j ∈{1,...,N},
(4.3)
where x(t) ∈ℜn is the state vector, w(t) ∈ℜr is the disturbance input which belongs
to L2[0,∞), z(t) ∈ℜp is the controlled output, uj(t) ∈ℜmj and yj(t) ∈ℜqj are
the control input and the measurement output of channel j ∈{1,...,N} and τ is an
unknown time-delay factor satisfying
0 ≤τ(t) ≤ϱ,
˙τ(t) ≤μ,
(4.4)
where the bounds ϱ, μ are known constants in order to guarantee smooth growth of
the state trajectories. The matrices A ∈ℜn×n, Bj ∈ℜn×mj , G ∈ℜp×n, Gd ∈ℜp×n,
Ad ∈ℜn×n, Φ ∈ℜp×r, Γ ∈ℜn×r, Cj ∈ℜqj×nj are real and constants.
Without loss of generality, the following assumptions are made:
Assumption 4.1 There is no unstable ﬁxed modes with respect the triplet A,
Bj, Cj.
Assumption 4.2 For every j ∈{1,...,N}, the matrices Bj, Cj have full column
rank and full row rank, respectively.
The uncertain matrices ΔA, ΔAd, ΔCj are represented by
[ΔA ΔAd] = EΔ[M N],

Decentralized Systems with Multi-controllers
where E,F,M,N,H1,...,HN are known constant matrices with appropriate di-
mensions and Δ is an unknown matrix satisfying ΔtΔ ≤I. The class of systems
described by (4.1)–(4.3) subject to delay-pattern (4.4) is frequently encountered
in modeling several physical systems and engineering applications including large
space structures, multi-machine power systems, cold mills, transportation systems,
water pollution management, to name a few [48, 72].
In what follows, we consider the feasible set C as the set of all linear time-
invariant controllers with state-space realization of the form:
˙ˆxj(t) = ˆAj ˆxj(t) + ˆBjyj(t),
(4.6)
uj(t) = ˆCj ˆxj(t) + ˆDjyj(t),
j = 1,2,...,N
where ˆxj(t) ∈ℜsj is the state of the local controller with the order sj ≤n and the
matrices ˆAj ∈ℜsj×sj , ˆBj ∈ℜsj×qj , ˆCj ∈ℜmj×sj , ˆDj ∈ℜmj×qj and are the design
parameters. Connecting the controller (4.6) to the system (4.1)–(4.3), we obtain the
closed-loop system
˙x(t) =
	
A + ΔA +
N

j=1
Bj ˆDj[Cj + ΔCj]

x(t) + [Ad + ΔAd]x(t −τ(t))
+
N

j=1
Bj ˆCj ˆxj(t) + Γ w(t),
(4.7)
˙ˆxj(t) = ˆBj[Cj + ΔCj]x(t) + ˆAj ˆxj(t),
j ∈{1,...,N},
(4.8)
z(t) = Gx(t) + Gdx(t −τ(t)) + Φw(t).
(4.9)
For simplicity in exposition, we introduce the following notations
ˆx(t) = col
 ˆx1(t) ˆx2(t) ... ˆxN(t)
,
w(t) = col
w1(t) w2(t) ... wN(t)

along with the matrices

(4.11)
H = diag

This paves the way to express the closed-loop system (4.7)–(4.9) into the form
˙x(t) =

x(t) + [Ad + ΔAd]x(t −τ(t))

˙ˆx(t) = ˆB[C + ΔC]x(t) + ˆAˆx(t),

It must be observed in (4.17) that all the matrices are known except the controller
coefﬁcient matrix K.
The problem of interest in this section is to design the decentralized dynamic
output-feedback controller (4.6) such that the closed-loop system (4.17) is internally
asymptotically stable with w(t) ≡0 and under zero initial condition, the following
condition is satisﬁed
∥z(t)∥2 ≤γ ∥w(t)∥2,
∀w(t) ∈L2[0,∞).

4.2.3 Decentralized Stabilization
We adopt a Lyapunov-based approach to design the decentralized controller (4.6).
For this purpose, we introduce the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF):
V (t) = ξ t(t)Pξ(t) +
 t
t−ϱ
ξt(s)Sξ(s)ds +
 t
t−τ(t)
ξ t(s)Wξ(s)ds

 t
t+s
˙ξ t(α)R˙ξ(α)dα ds,
(4.21)
where 0 < P, 0 ≤W, 0 < R, 0 < S are matrices of appropriate dimensions. The
main decentralized stabilization result is established by the following theorem:
Theorem 4.1 The uncertain nonlinear system (4.17) is robust asymptotically stable
and satisfy (4.20), if there exist positive deﬁnite matrices ¯S, ¯R, ¯W, real matrices X,
Y, and real constants ε1 > 0, ε2 > 0, such that the following LMI holds.

4.3 Resilient Stabilization of Interconnected Networked Systems
Networked control systems (NCS) are feedback control systems with network chan-
nels in the feedback loop. Two main changes in the control system research direc-
tions are the explicit considerations of the interconnections and a renewed emphasis

4.3

on distributed control systems being closely related to decentralized control of com-
plex large scale systems. Though a variety of structures and models in this frame-
work have been analyzed, a gap remains between decentralized control and control
over networks. Decentralized NCS (DNCS) are the control systems with multiple
control stations while transmitting control signals through a network, i.e. date sig-
nals are transmitted to multiple controllers in the feedback loop. DNCS combine
the advantages of the centralized NCS and the decentralized control systems. Such
a combination enables to cut unnecessary wiring, reduces the complexity and the
overall system cost when designing and implementing control systems. Symmet-
ric composite systems arises in very different real world systems such as industrial
manipulators, parallel processes, ﬂexible structure, electric power systems, homo-
geneous interconnected systems such as seismic cables or in the design of reliable
control systems. In practice, controllers are implemented imprecisely because of
various reasons determined by digital controller properties or the need for addi-
tional tuning of parameters. The need to have a certain degree of freedom in the
choice of the controller parameters, i.e. the robustness of stability against perturba-
tions in controller parameters, leads to the requirement to include also uncertainties
of the controllers in the control design.
4.3.1 Introduction
Recently, the results dealing with the DNCS design methods are rare. Relevant prob-
lems are introduced in [4, 6, 7, 9, 36]. Decentralized stabilization of NCS using pe-
riodically time varying local controller is presented in [63], while the reference [73]
deals with the synchronization within the DNCS design. Stability of the DNCS is
analyzed in [35].
It has been customary to confront with several important issues when dealing
with the control of interconnected systems. The ﬁrst issue is concerned with the
practical limitations in the number and the structure of the feedback loops, which
motivates decentralized control schemes [72]. The second issue regards the presence
of uncertainties both in the subsystems and in the interconnections. The third issue
is the impact of time-delays among the subsystems and across the coupling links.
The fourth issue has to do with the reliability of the control systems against com-
ponent failures and/or perturbations in the feedback gain matrices. In this section,
we study the robust stability and feedback stabilization problems of a class of linear
interconnected continuous time-delay systems, which are frequently encountered to
describe propagation, transport phenomena and population dynamics in various en-
gineering and physical applications. Large-scale interconnected system appear in a
variety of engineering applications including power systems, large structures and
manufacturing systems and for those applications, decentralized control schemes
present a practical and effective means for designing control algorithms based on
the individual subsystems [72]. Relevant research results on decentralized control
of relevance to the present work can be found in [37, 63, 73].

Decentralized Systems with Multi-controllers
It appears from the existing results that general results pertaining to intercon-
nected time-delay systems are few and restricted, see [36, 46–48, 62] where most
of the efforts were centered on matching conditions and were virtually delay-
independent. A recent effort was reported recently in [20] where a class of uncertain
systems with interconnected and feedback delays has been considered. However,
the internal time-delay within the subsystems have not been considered and several
bounding inequalities have been included.
It has been recently reported in [3] that the theory of large-scale (interconnected)
systems is devoted to the problems due to dimensionality, information structure con-
straints, uncertainty and delays. Resilient (non-fragile) control methods [28] and
[52–55] have added new tools to the task of designing appropriate control algo-
rithms to cope with gain parameter perturbations and controller implementations
issues and it is interesting to view these tools as robust re-design algorithms [53].
It is crucial to realize that when dealing with several practical problems arising in
power systems, manufacturing systems and irrigation systems, the changes in con-
troller structure and settings might degrade the overall system performance. Thus
the important role of resilient (non-fragile) controllers with information structure
constraints is underlined when considering large-scale systems [3].
This section develops a resilient decentralized H∞observer-based setting using
the reduced-order control design when considering the delay-dependent approach
within the framework of the LMIs. An a technical outcome, we develop robust
decentralized delay-dependent stability and resilient feedback stabilization meth-
ods for a class of linear interconnected continuous-time systems. The subsystems
are subjected to convex-bounded parametric uncertainties while time-varying de-
lays occur within the local subsystems and across the interconnections and additive
feedback gain perturbations are allowed. In this way, our control design offers de-
centralized structure and possesses robustness with respect to both parametric un-
certainties and gain perturbations. For related results on resilient control, the reader
is referred to [53, 54] where it is shown to provide a framework of extended robust-
ness properties.
4.3.2 Problem Formulation
We consider a class of linear systems with unknown nonlinearities S of the form:
˙x(t) = AΔx(t) + Bou(t) + ΓΔw(t) + c(t,x)
= [Ao + ΔA]x(t) + Bou(t) + [Γo + ΔΓ ]w(t) + c(t,x(t)),
(4.35)
z(t) = [Go + ΔG]x(t) + [Φo + ΔΦ]w(t)
= GΔx(t) + ΦΔw(t),
y(t) = Cox(t),
(4.36)
where x(t) ∈ℜn is the state vector, u(t) ∈ℜm is the control input, y(t) ∈ℜp is
the measured output, w(t) ∈ℜq is the disturbance input which belongs to L2[0,∞)

4.3
Resilient Stabilization of Interconnected Networked Systems
195
and z(t) ∈ℜq is the performance output. The unknown nonlinearities c(t,x(t)) are
piecewise continuous functions to be speciﬁed at the subsystem level. In what fol-
lows, we view S as structurally composed of ns coupled subsystems Sj and modeled
by:
˙xj(t) = AjΔxj(t) + Bjouj(t) + ΓjΔwj(t) +
ns

k=1
FjkΔxk(t) + cj(t,x),
(4.37)
zj(t) = GjΔxj(t) + ΦjΔwj(t),
yj(t) = Cjoxj(t),

(4.38)
where the unknown nonlinearities cj(t,x(t)) are piecewise continuous functions
satisfying the global Lipschitz conditions for all cj(0,x(0)) as follows
∥cj(t,x1(t)) −cj(t,x2(t))∥≤∥Ej(x1(t) −x2(t))∥,
∀t ≥0,
(4.39)
where Ej is a prescribed constant. We further suppose that the structure of the non-
linearities cj(t,x(t)) is in the form
cj(t,x(t)) = e(t,xj)Exj(t),
e(t,xj) : ℜn+1 →[−1,1].

output, wj(t) ∈ℜqj is the disturbance input which belongs to L2[0,∞) and zj(t) ∈
ℜqj is the performance output.
The class of systems described by (4.45) is frequently encountered in modeling
several physical systems and engineering applications including large space struc-
tures, multi-machine power systems, cold mills, transportation systems, water pol-
lution management, to name a few [48, 72].
4.3.3 Resilient Observer-Based Control
In most of the cases, not all subsystem states are available for measurements, we
seek a decentralized dynamic output-feedback control using subsystem observers
within the network feedback. Consider that one controller-actuator node with a
buffer storing the latest sensor signal at the subsystem level. It is customary that new
sensor data are compared with the latest data. If a new signal reaches the controller-
actuator node, then it is used to compute the control signal, else it is discarded. This
yields in a networked resilient observer controller in the form
˙ˆxj(t) = Ajo ˆxj(t) + Bjouj(t) + LjΔ( ¯yj(tk) −Cjo ¯xj(tk)),
uj(t) = KjΔ ˆxj(t),
t ∈[tk,tk+1), k = 1,2,...,
(4.46)
LjΔ = Ljo + ΔLj,
KjΔ = Kjo + ΔKj,

4.3
Resilient Stabilization of Interconnected Networked Systems
197
where ˆxj(t) ∈ℜnj is the observer state of subsystem and the matrices Ljo, Kjo are
the nominal observer gain and the controller feedback gain matrices, respectively. In
addition ΔLj, ΔKj are additive observer and controller gain matrix uncertainties
given by
ΔLj = NjoΔtj(t)Mjo,
ΔKj = NjcΔzj(t)Mjc,
(4.47)
where for j = 1,...,ns, Njo, ..., Mjc are known real constant matrices and
Δtj, Δzj are unknown time-varying real matrices of appropriate dimensions with
Lebesgue measurable elements satisfying Δt
tjΔtj ≤I, Δt
zjΔzj ≤I.
We note in (4.46) that tk = kΔ, k > 0 denotes a sampling instant, Δ is the sam-
pling period and k is an integer. The sampler is equipped with a standard zero order
hold in the feedback. The sampled value yj(tk) of the output yj(t) is transmitted
through a network channel and the successfully transmitted value is registered in a
buffer with ¯yj(tk) being the output from the buffer and simultaneously represents
the input to the observer. Also, ¯xj(tk) is the observer state copying the whole set
of dropped packets appearing in the transmission of ¯yj(tk). Note that tk+1 ≥tk + 1,
k = 1,2,... which corresponds to data packet dropout registered by a buffer and
¯yj(tk) = yj(tk −τkΔ −τc) where τkΔ indicates the data packet dropout and τc
is the network-induced delay. This motivates deﬁning the new time-varying delay
θ(t) = t −tk −τkΔ −τc where 1 ≤τk ≤(tk−1 −τcj)/Δ. In the sequel, we consider
the number of data packet dropouts to be bounded so that, including the network-
induced delays for each subsystem, it satisﬁes the constraint
θm ≤θ(t) ≤θM,
(4.48)
where θm > 0, θM > 0 are given constants. Therefore, controller (4.46) can be
rewritten as
˙ˆxj(t) = Ajo ˆxj(t) + Bjouj(t) + LjΔ(yj(t −θ(t)) −Cjo ˆxj(t −θ(t))),
uj(t) = KjΔ ˆxj(t),
(4.49)
ˆxj(t) = 0,
t ∈[−θM,0],
while the overall decentralized observer-based controller can be expressed as
˙ˆx(t) = Ac ˆx(t) + Bou(t) + (Lo + ΔLo)(y(t −θ(t)) −Co ˆx(t −θ(t))),
u(t) = (Ko + ΔKo)ˆx(t),

Decentralized Systems with Multi-controllers
Remark 4.1 From the published results on networked-control systems, we note that
a single packet transmission is supposed in the feedback loop. It means that in each
transmission every control station receives only one packet through the network.
It can be understood as multiple data packets simultaneous transmission through
parallel network channels, where each channel generally corresponds with a local
feedback loop in the DNCS with individual time-varying delays. The availability
of Acknowledgement (ACK) about data losses to the sender as well as the commu-
nication logics considering dropouts in all local channels if the dropout appears in
any local channel. Then, only a single identical time-varying delay can be applied
for any channel. It can be considered as a single communication channel with data
packet dropouts and communication delays connected within a block diagonal struc-
ture of the gain matrix, that is, the sensor-actuator pair structure in the NCS. Such a
network feedback architecture enables essential simpliﬁcation of the DNCS design
for the considered class of composite systems. The information structure constraints
on only sensor-actuator pairs in the gain matrices is sufﬁciently justiﬁed for sym-
metric composite systems. Much higher reliability of subsystems than that of the
interconnections, an essential simpliﬁcation of the DNCS design using LMIs, and
the design requirement to keep the symmetry in the closed-loop system lead to the
preference of decentralized control.
4.3.4 Augmented Closed-Loop System
Deﬁne the subsystem error vector ej(t) = xj(t) −ˆxj(t) and the corresponding aug-
mented vector ξj(t) = [xt
j(t) et
j(t)]t. Using (4.37) and (4.46) with some manipula-

Our objective in this section is to study two main problems: the ﬁrst problem is the
decentralized delay-dependent asymptotic stability by deriving a feasibility testing
at the subsystem level so as to guarantee the overall system asymptotic stability. The
second problem deals with the resilient decentralized stabilization by developing
state-feedback controllers that takes into consideration additive gain perturbations
while ensuring that the overall closed-loop system is delay-dependent asymptoti-
cally stable.
4.3.5 Delay-Dependent Subsystem Stability
In what follows, we develop new criteria for LMI-based characterization of delay-
dependent asymptotic stability and L2 gain analysis which requires only subsystem
information thereby assuring decentralization. The criteria includes some parameter
matrices aims at expanding the range of applicability of the developed conditions.

Robust asymptotic stability requirement ˙Vj(t)|(4.52) ≤0 implies that ΨjΔ < 0 for all
admissible uncertainties satisfying (4.40) and (4.47). Next, considering the L2-gain
performance measure J = ns
j=1 Jj for any wj(t) ∈L2(0,∞) ̸= 0 with zero initial
condition xj(0) = 0 hence V (0) = 0, we have

This leads to ∥zj(t)∥2 < ns

mance. In terms of (4.58) and considering ˆΨjΔ while invoking bounding inequal-
ity A from Sect. 9.3.1 with some algebraic manipulations and Schur complements,
we obtain LMI (4.58) for some scalars σ1 > 0, ..., σ6 > 0 and hence the proof is
completed.

4.4 Control of Discrete-Time Systems with Input Saturation
We study decentralized stabilization of discrete time linear time invariant (LTI)
systems subject to actuator saturation, using LTI controllers. The requirement of
stabilization under both saturation constraints and decentralization impose obvious
necessary conditions on the open-loop plant, namely that its eigenvalues are in the
closed unit disk and further that the eigenvalues on the unit circle are not decen-
tralized ﬁxed modes. The key contribution of this work is to provide a broad suf-
ﬁcient condition for decentralized stabilization under saturation. Speciﬁcally, we
show through an iterative argument that stabilization is possible whenever: (1) the
open loop eigenvalues are in the closed unit disk, (2) the eigenvalues on the unit
circle are not decentralized ﬁxed modes, and (3) these eigenvalues on the unit circle
have algebraic multiplicity 1.
4.4.1 Introduction
The result presented here contributes to our ongoing study of the stabilization of de-
centralized systems subject to actuator saturation. The eventual goal of this study is
the design of controllers for saturating decentralized systems that achieve not only
stabilization but also high performance. As a ﬁrst step toward this design goal, we
are currently looking for tight conditions on a decentralized plant with input satura-
tion, for the existence of stabilizing controllers. Even this check for the existence of
stabilizing controllers turns out to be extremely intricate: we have yet to obtain nec-
essary and sufﬁcient conditions for stabilization, but have obtained a broad sufﬁcient
condition, see the results in [29–34, 38–40, 64–77]. This section further contributes
to the study of the existence of stabilizing controllers, by describing a analogous
sufﬁcient condition for discrete-time decentralized plants.
To motivate and introduce the main result in the section, let us brieﬂy review
foundational studies on both decentralized control and saturating control systems.
We recall that a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for stabilization of a decen-
tralized system using LTI state-space controllers is given in Wang and Davison’s
classical work [78]. They obtain that stabilization is possible if and only if all de-
centralized ﬁxed modes of a plant are in the open left half plane, and give spec-
iﬁcations of and methods for ﬁnding these decentralized ﬁxed modes. Numerous
further characterizations of decentralized stabilization (and ﬁxed modes) have been
given, see for instance the work of Corfmat and Morse [12]. In complement, for
centralized control systems subject to actuator saturation, not only conditions for

4.4
Control of Discrete-Time Systems with Input Saturation
209
stabilization but also practical designs have been obtained, using the low gain and
low-high-gain methodology. For a background on the results for centralized sys-
tems subject to input saturation we refer to two special issues [5, 69]. Of impor-
tance here, we recall that a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for semi global sta-
bilization of LTI plants with actuator saturation is that their open-loop poles are in
the closed left half plane. Combining this observation with Wang and Davison’s
result, one might postulate that stabilization of a saturating linear decentralized
control system is possible if and only of (1) the open-loop plant poles are in the
closed left half plane (respectively, closed unit disk, for discrete-time systems),
and (2) the poles on the imaginary axis (respectively, unit circle) are not decen-
tralized ﬁxed modes. The necessity of the two requirements is immediate, but we
have not yet been able to determine whether the requirements are also sufﬁcient. As
a ﬁrst step for continuous-time plants, we showed in [75] that decentralized stabi-
lization under saturation is possible when (1) the plant’s open-loop poles are in the
CLHP with imaginary axis poles non-repeated, and (2) the imaginary axis poles are
not decentralized ﬁxed modes. Here, we develop an analogous result for discrete-
time plants, in particular showing that decentralized stabilization under saturation
is possible if (1) the plant’s open-loop poles are in the closed unit disk with unit-
circle poles non-repeated, and (2) the unit circle poles are not decentralized ﬁxed
modes.
4.4.2 Problem Formulation
Consider the LTI discrete-time systems subject to actuator saturation,
Σ:

x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + ν
j=1 Bjsat(uj(k)),
yj(k) = Cjx(k),
j = 1,...,ν,
(4.80)
where x ∈ℜn is state, uj ∈ℜmj , j = 1,...,ν are control inputs, yj ∈ℜpj , j =
1,...,ν are measured outputs, and ‘sat’ denotes the standard saturation element.
Here we are looking for ν controllers of the form,
Σ:

zj(k + 1) = Kjzi(k) + Ljyi(k),
zj ∈ℜsi,
uj(k + 1) = Mjzj(k) + Njyj(k).
(4.81)
Let the system (4.80) be given. The semi-global stabilization problem via decen-
tralized control is said to be solvable if for all compact sets W and S1,...,Sν there
exists ν controllers of the form (4.81) such that the closed loop system is asymptot-
ically stable with the set
W × S1 × ··· × Sν
contained in the domain of attraction.

Decentralized Systems with Multi-controllers
The main objective is to develop necessary and sufﬁcient conditions such that the
semi-global stabilization problem via decentralized control is solvable. This objec-
tive has not yet been achieved. However, we obtain necessary conditions as well as
sufﬁcient conditions which are quite close.
4.4.3 Review Results
Before we tackle the problem introduced in Sect. 4.4.2, let us ﬁrst review the nec-
essary and sufﬁcient conditions for the decentralized stabilization of the linearized
model of the given system Σ,
¯Σ:

x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + ν
j=1 Biui(k),
yj(k) = Cjx(k),
j = 1,...,ν.
(4.82)
The decentralized stabilization problem for ¯Σ is to ﬁnd LTI dynamic controllers
Σj, j = 1,...,ν, of the form (4.81) such that the poles of the closed loop system
are in the desired locations in the open unit disc.
Given system ¯Σ and controllers Σi, deﬁned by (4.82) and (4.81) respectively, let
us ﬁrst deﬁne the following matrices in order to provide an easier bookkeeping:
B = [B1 ... Bν],
C = [C′
1 ... C′
ν]′,
K = diag[K1,...,Kν],
L = diag[L1,...,Lν],
M = diag[M1,...,Mν],
N = diag[N1,...,Nν].
Deﬁnition 4.1 Consider system ¯Σ, λ ∈C is called a decentralized ﬁxed mode if
for all block diagonal matrices H we have
det(λI −A −BHC) = 0.
We look at eigenvalues that can be moved by static decentralized controllers. How-
ever, it is known that if we cannot move an eigenvalue by static decentralized con-
trollers then we cannot move the eigenvalue by dynamic decentralized controllers
either.
Lemma 4.1 Necessary and sufﬁcient condition for the existence of a decentralized
feedback control law for the system ¯Σ such that the closed loop system is asymptot-
ically stable is that all the ﬁxed modes of the system be asymptotically stable (in the
unit disc).
Proof We ﬁrst establish necessity.
Assume local controllers Σi together stabilize ¯Σ then for any |λ| ≥1 there exists
a δ such that (λ+δ)I −K is invertible and the closed loop system replacing K with
K −δI is still asymptotically stable. This choice is possible because if λI −K

4.4
Control of Discrete-Time Systems with Input Saturation
211
is invertible obviously we can choose δ = 0. If λI −K is not invertible, by small
enough choice of δ we can make sure that (λ + δ)I −K is invertible and the closed
loop system replacing K with K −δI is still asymptotically stable. But the closed
loop system when K −δI is in the loop is asymptotically stable. In particular, it can
not have a pole in λ. So
det(λI −A −B[M(λI −(K −δI))−1L + N]C) ̸= 0.
Hence the block diagonal matrix
S = M(λI −(K −δI))−1L + N
has the property that
det(λI −A −BSC) ̸= 0
thus λ is not a ﬁxed mode. Since this argument is true for any λ on or outside the unit
disc, this implies that all the ﬁxed modes must be inside the unit disc. This proves
the necessity of the Lemma 4.1.
Next, we establish sufﬁciency. The papers [12, 78] showed that if the decentral-
ized ﬁxed modes of a strongly connected system are stable, we can ﬁnd a stabiliz-
ing controller for the system. However, these papers are based on continuous-time
results. For completeness we present the proof for discrete time which is a straight-
forward modiﬁcation of [78]. We ﬁrst claim that decentralized ﬁxed modes are in-
variant under preliminary output injection. But this is obvious from our necessity
proof since a trivial modiﬁcation shows that no dynamic controller can move a ﬁxed
mode. To prove that we can actually stabilize the system, we use a recursive argu-
ment. Assume the system has an unstable eigenvalue in μ. Since μ is not a ﬁxed
mode there exists Ni such that
A +
ν

j=1

no longer has an eigenvalue in μ. Let k be the smallest integer such that an unstable
eigenvalue of A is no longer an eigenvalue of
A +


j=1
BjNjCj
while Nj can be chosen small enough not to introduce additional unstable eigenval-
ues. Then for the system

an unstable eigenvalue is both observable and controllable. But this implies that
there exists a dynamic controller which moves this eigenvalue in the open unit

212

Decentralized Systems with Multi-controllers
disc without introducing new unstable eigenvalues. Through a recursion, we can
move all eigenvalues one-by-one in the open unit disc and in this way ﬁnd a de-
centralized controller which stabilizes the system. This proves the sufﬁciency of the
Lemma 4.1.
□
4.4.4 Main Results
Here, we present the main results of Sect. 4.4.
Theorem 4.4 Consider the system Σ. There exists nonnegative integers s1,...,sν
such that for any given collection of compact sets W ⊂ℜn and Si ⊂ℜsi,i =
1,...,ν, there exists ν controllers of the form (4.81) such that the origin of the
resulting closed loop system is asymptotically stable and the domain of attraction
includes W × S1 × ··· × Sν only if
• All ﬁxed modes are in the open unit disc.
• All eigenvalues of A are in the closed unit disc.
Proof There exists an open neighborhood containing the origin for the closed loop
system of Σ with the controllers Σi is identical to the closed loop system of ¯Γ
with the controllers Σi. Hence asymptotic stability of one closed loop system is
equivalent to asymptotic stability of the other closed loop system. But then it is
obvious from Lemma 4.1 that the ﬁrst item of Theorem 4.4 is necessary for the
existence of controllers of the form (4.81) for ¯Σ such that the origin of the resulting
closed loop system is asymptotically stable.
To prove the necessity of the second item of Theorem 4.4, assume that λ is an
eigenvalue of A outside the unit disc with associated left eigenvector p. We obtain:
px(k + 1) = λpx(k) + v(k),
where
v(k) :=
ν

j=1
pBi sat(uj(k)).
Because of the saturation elements, there exists an ˜M > 0 such that |v(k)| ≤˜M for
all k ≥0. But then we have
px(k) = λkpx(0) +
k−1

j=0
λk−1−jv(j) = λk(px(0) + Sk),
(4.83)
where Sk = k−1
j=0 v(j) v(j)
λi+1 . We ﬁnd that
|Sk| ≤˜M

and then from (4.83) we ﬁnd
|px(k)| > |λ|k

|px(0)| −
˜M
|λ| −1

∀k ≥1.
Hence |px(k)| does not converge to zero independent of our choice for a controller
if we choose the initial condition x(0) such that |px(0)| >
˜M
|λ|−1 because of the fact
that |λ| > 1. However, the system was semi-globally stabilizable and hence there
exists a controller which contains this initial condition in its domain of attraction
and hence |px(k)| →0 which yields a contradiction. This proves the second item
of Theorem 4.4.
We now proceed to the next theorem which gives a sufﬁcient condition for semi-
global stabilizability of (4.80) when the set of controllers given by (4.81) are uti-
lized.
□
Theorem 4.5 Consider the system Σ. There exists nonnegative integers s1,...,sν
such that for any given collection of compact sets W ⊂ℜn and Sj ⊂ℜsj ,j =
1,...,ν, there exists ν controllers of the form (4.81) such that the origin of the
resulting closed loop system is asymptotically stable and the domain of attraction
includes W × S1 × ··· × Sν if
• All ﬁxed modes are in the open unit disc.
• All eigenvalues of A are in the closed unit disc with those eigenvalues on the unit
circle having algebraic multiplicity equal to one.
To prove this theorem we will exploit the following lemma which follows directly
from classical results of eigenvalues and eigenvectors and the results of perturba-
tions of the matrix on those eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Lemma 4.2 Let Aδ ∈ℜn×n be a sequence of matrices parametrized by δ and a
matrix A ∈ℜn×n such that Aδ →A as δ →0. Let A be a matrix with all eigenvalues
in the closed unit disc and with p eigenvalues on the unit disc with all of them having
multiplicity 1. Also assume that Aδ has all its eigenvalues in the closed unit disc. Let
matrix P > 0 be such that A′PA −P ≤0 is satisﬁed. Then for small δ > 0 there
exists a family of matrices Pδ > 0 such that
A′
δPδAδ −Pδ ≤0
and Pδ →P as δ →0.
Proof We ﬁrst observe that there exists a matrix S such that
S−1
δ AδSδ =
A11

A22

,
where all eigenvalues of A11 are on the unit circle while the eigenvalues of A22 are
in the open unit disc. Since Aδ →A and the eigenvalues of A11 and A22 are distinct,

214

there exists a parametrized matrix Sδ such that for sufﬁciently small δ

where Sδ →S, A11,δ →A11 and A22,δ →A22 as δ →0.

This implies that A′
11 ¯P12A22 −¯P12 = 0 and since eigenvalues of A11 are on the unit
disc and eigenvalues of A22 are inside the unit disc, we ﬁnd that ¯P12 = 0 because
A′
11 ¯P12A22 = ¯P12 ⇒(A′
11)k ¯P12Ak
22 = ¯P12,
where k is an arbitrary positive integer. Note that (A′
11)k remains bounded while
Ak
22 →0 as k →∞. This means that for k →∞, ¯P12 →0 and because ¯P12 is
independent of k, we ﬁnd that ¯P12 = 0. Next, since A22 has all its eigenvalues in the
open unit disc, there exists a parametrized matrix Pδ,22 such that for δ small enough
A′
δ,22Pδ,22Aδ,22 −Pδ,22 = V ≤0

4.4

215
while Pδ,22 →P22 as δ →0.
Let A11 = WΛAW −1 with ΛA a diagonal matrix. Because the eigenvectors of
A11 are distinct and A11,δ →A11, the eigenvectors of A11,δ depend continuously
on δ for δ small enough and hence there exists a parametrized matrix Wδ such that
Wδ →W while A11,δ = WδΛAδW −1

with ΛAδ diagonal. The matrix ¯P11 satisﬁes
A′
11 ¯P11A11 −¯P11 = 0.
This implies that ΛP = W ∗¯P11W satisﬁes
Λ∗
AΛP ΛA −ΛP = 0.
The above equation then shows that ΛP is a diagonal matrix. We know that
Λ∗
Aδ →ΛA.
We know that ΛAδ is a diagonal matrix the diagonal elements of which have mag-
nitude less or equal to one while ΛP is a positive deﬁnite diagonal matrix.
Using this, it can be veriﬁed that we have
Λ∗
AδΛP ΛAδ −ΛP ≤0.
We choose ¯P11,δ as
¯P11,δ = (W ∗
δ )−1ΛP (Wδ)−1.
We can see that this choice of ¯P11,δ satisﬁes
A′
11,δ ¯P11,δA11,δ −¯P11,δ ≤0.
It is easy to see that ¯P11,δ →¯P11 as δ →0. Then

We now show a recursive algorithm that at each step moves at least one eigen-
value on the unit circle in a decentralized fashion while preserving the stability of
other modes in the open unit disc in a way that the magnitude of each decentralized
feedback control is assured never to exceed 1/n. The algorithm will consist of at
most n steps, and therefore the overall decentralized inputs will not saturate for an
appropriate choice of the initial state.

• Step 0: We initialize algorithm at this step. Let A0 := A,B0,ij := Bj,C0,i :=

we can rewrite ui as

Our objective here is to design the decentralized stabilizers in such a way that
they satisfy the following properties:
1. Matrix Aε
m has all its eigenvalues in the closed unit disc, and eigenvalues on
unit circle are distinct.
2. Aε
m has less eigenvalues on the unit circle than Aε

3. There exists a family of matrices P ε

Furthermore, there exists an ε∗such that for ε ∈(0,ε∗] and νm

mxm(k) ≤n −m + 1.
• Terminal Step: There exists a value for m, say l ≤n, such that Aε

eigenvalues in the open unit disc, and also property 3 above is satisﬁed, which
means that for ε small enough, ∥ui∥≤1 for all states with x′

centralized control laws Σl,ε
j , i = 1,...,l together construct our decentralized
feedback law for system Σ.

Finally, we show that for an appropriate choice of ε, this recursive algorithm
provides a set of decentralized feedbacks which satisfy the requirements of Theo-
rem 4.5. We will ﬁrst prove properties 1, 2 and 3 listed above by induction. It is easy
to see that the initialization step satisﬁes these properties. We assume that the design
in the step m can be done, and then we must show that the design in the step m + 1
can be done.
Now assume that we are in step m + 1. The closed loop system Σm,ε
cl
has prop-
erties (4.80), (4.81) and (4.82). Let λ be an eigenvalue on the unit disc of Aε
m. We
know that λ is not a ﬁxed mode of the closed loop system. Thus there exist ¯Ki such
that

plies that it is non-zero for almost all δ > 0. This means that for almost all δ > 0

Bm,i ¯KiCm,i
has λ as an eigenvalue and the same number of eigenvalues on the unit disc as Aε

for small enough δ. This implies that Aε,δ
m still has all its eigenvalues in the closed
unit disc.
Using Lemma 4.2, we know that there exists a ¯P ε,δ

such that

This means that

Since we might not be able to ﬁnd a stable observer for the state xm we actually
construct an observer for the observable part of the state V xm. Because our triplet
has a stabilizable and detectable eigenvalue on the unit disc, the observable part of
the state V xm must contain at least one eigenvalue on the unit circle that can be

It is easy to check that the above feedback laws satisfy the properties 1 and 2. What
remains is to show that they satisfy property 3. Also we need to show that the control
laws can be written in the form mentioned in step m for step m + 1.
For any ε there exists a ℜε
m > 0 with
(Aε
s + KCm,j+1V ′)′ℜε
m(Aε
s + KCm,j+1V ′) −ℜε
m < 0
such that ℜε
m →0 as ε →0. Because Fρ →0 as ρ →0, for each ε, for small
enough ρ we have
∥Fρe∥< 1
2n
∀e such that e′ℜε

2.
Note that ¯Aε
m +Bm,j+1FρV has at least one less eigenvalue on the unit disc than ¯Aε
m
and has all its eigenvalues in the close unit disc. Applying Lemma (4.2), for small ρ
we have
( ¯Aε

ρ( ¯Aε
m + Bm,j+1FρV ) −¯P ε
ρ ≤0
with ¯P ε
ρ →¯P ε
m as ρ →0.
Now note that Aε
m and Aε
s + KCm,j+1V ′ have disjoint eigenvalues we ﬁnd that
for small ρ, the matrices Aε
m + Bm,j+1FϱV and Aε
s + KCm,j+1V ′ have disjoint
eigenvalues since Fρ →0 as ρ →0. But then there exists a Wε,ρ such that
Bm,j+1Fρ + ( ¯Aε

s + KCm,j+1V ′) = 0
while Wε,ρ →0 as ρ →0. Now if we deﬁne ¯P ε,ρ

Now consider ¯xm+1 such that

Then with small enough choice of ρ we can have
¯x′

and
(p −V xm)′ℜε
m(p −V xm) ≤n −m + 1

Next for each ε we choose ρ = ρε such that the above holds and we have
∥FρV xm∥< 1
2n
∀xm such that x′
m ¯P ε
mxm ≤n −m + 1
2.
Next we must check the bounds on the inputs in step m + 1. For i = 1,...,j, we
have
∥ui∥= ∥F m

i xm∥≤m

2n ≤m + 1

For i = j + 1, we have:

= ∥F m
i,εxm + FρεV xm + Fρε(p −V xm)∥
≤m
n + 1
2n = m + 1
n
.
Finally, for i = j + 2,...,ν, we have:
∥ui∥= ∥F m
i,εxm∥≤m
n ≤m + 1
n
.
Now for i ̸= j + 1 we set ni,m+1 = ni,m and for i = j + 1 we set ni,m+1 = ni,m + s.
If ni,m > 0 we choose
pm+1
j

and if nj,m = 0 we choose pm+1
j

of xm+1. We introduce a basis transformation Tm+1 such that ¯xm+1 = Tm+1xm+1.
Next, we deﬁne

m+1 = T ′

Now for i = 1,...,ν depending on the value of ni,m+1 we can rewrite the control
laws in the desired form and subsequently the properties 1–3 are obtained.
We know that there exists a value of m, say l ≤n, such that Aε
l has all its eigenval-
ues in the open unit disc. We set νl
j = 0 for j = 1,2,3,...,l. Then the decentralized
control laws Σl,ε
j , i = 1,2,3,...,l together represent a decentralized semi global
feedback law for the system Σ. In other words, we claim that for any given compact
sets W ⊂ℜn and Si ⊂ℜnj,l for j = 1,2,3,...,l, there exists an ε∗. such that the
origin of the closed loop system is exponentially stable for any 0 < ε < ε∗. and the
compact set W × S1 × ··· × Sν is within the domain of attraction. Furthermore for
all initial conditions within W × S1 × ··· × Sν, the closed loop system behaves like
a linear system, that is the saturation is not activated.
We know that for ε small enough, the set
Ωε
1 := {xl ∈ℜnl|x′
lP ε
l xl ≤1}
is inside the domain of attraction of the equilibrium point of the closed loop
system comprising the given system Σ and the decentralized control laws Σl,ε
j ,
i = 1,2,3,...,l because for all initial conditions within Ωε
1, it is obvious that
∥ui∥≤1,i = 1,2,3,...,l which means that the closed loop system behaves like
a linear system, that is the saturation is not activated. Furthermore since all of
the eigenvalues of Aε
l are in the open unit disc, this linear system is asymptoti-
cally stable. In addition because of the fact that P ε
l →0 as ε →0, we ﬁnd that
W × S1 × ··· × Sν is inside Ωε
1 for ε sufﬁciently small. This concludes that the
decentralized control laws Σl,εi, i = 1,2,3,...,l are semi-globally stabilizing.
4.5 Notes and References
This chapter has investigated classes of decentralized systems that deploy incorpo-
rate multiple controllers in their basic operation. The systems include multi-channel
time-delay systems, interconnected networked systems and discrete-systems with
saturating controllers. In the ﬁrst two-types, decentralized delay-dependent stabil-
ity and stabilization methods were developed for a class of linear interconnection
of time-delay plants subjected to convex-bounded parametric uncertainties and cou-
pled with time-delay interconnections. The developed results provide initial step
toward further developments around the deployment of multi-controller structures
for resolving several issues for decentralized systems. Applications of the foregoing
concepts to practical systems can be pursued further following the ideas in [21, 23,
24, 42, 44, 45]. Extensions to time-delay systems offer possibilities along the ideas
of [11–19].

Chapter 5
Decentralized Quantized Control
In this chapter, we address the problem of designing decentralized H∞feedback
control for a class of linear interconnected systems with quantized signals in the
subsystem control channels. Both continuous- and discrete-time systems are teated.
The systems have unknown-but-bounded couplings and interval delays. A decentral-
ized static output-feedback controller is designed at the subsystem level to render the
closed-loop system delay-dependent asymptotically stable with guaranteed γ -level.
When the local output measurements are quantized, a local output-dependent proce-
dure is developed for updating the quantizer parameters to attain similar asymptotic
stability and guaranteed performance of the closed-loop quantized system.
Then, the interesting problem of decentralized feedback control design for a class
of linear interconnected discrete-time systems subject to overﬂow nonlinearities
and unknown-but-bounded couplings is subsequently addressed. A decentralized
state feedback quantized controller is designed at the subsystem level to render the
closed-loop system asymptotically stable. When the local output measurements are
available, a decentralized output-feedback quantized controller is developed attain
similar asymptotic stability and guaranteed performance of the closed-loop quan-
tized system.
Several special cases of interest are derived and simulation results are provided.
5.1 Decentralized Quantized Control I: Continuous Systems
In conventional feedback control theory, most of data and/or signals are directly
processed. In emerging control systems including networks, all signals are trans-
ferred through network which eventually gives rise to packet dropouts or data trans-
fer rate limitations [17]. Alternatively, signal processing and signal quantization al-
ways exist in computer-based control systems [22], in nanoscale servo control [16]
and therefore recent research studies have been reported on the analysis and de-
sign problems for control systems involving various quantization methods [5, 8,
19, 29]. In [5], a quantizer taking value in a ﬁnite set is deﬁned and then quantized

Decentralized Quantized Control
feedback stabilization for linear systems is considered. The problem of stabilizing
an unstable linear system by means of quantized state feedback, where the quan-
tizer takes value in a countable set, is addressed in [8]. It should be noted that the
approach in [5] relies on the possibility of making discrete online adjustments of
quantizer parameters which was extended in [21] for more general nonlinear sys-
tems with general types of quantizers involving the states of the system, the mea-
sured outputs, and the control inputs. Based on [21], stabilization of discrete-time
LTI systems with quantized measurement outputs is reported in [29]. Further related
results are reported in [33, 34]. In terms of control design, it turns out that the use of
output-feedback schemes [7] provides great ﬂexibility in accommodating systems
uncertainties. A decentralized H∞feedback control systems with two quantizers
was considered in [6].
On another research front, decentralized stability and feedback stabilization of
interconnected systems have been the topic of recurring interests and recent rel-
evant results have been reported in [2, 24–28, 31]. In this chapter, we study the
problem of decentralized H∞feedback control for a class of linear interconnected
continuous-time systems with quantized signals in the subsystem control channel.
The system has unknown-but-bounded couplings and interval time-delays. A de-
centralized static output-feedback controller is designed at the subsystem level us-
ing only local variables to render the overall closed-loop system is delay-dependent
asymptotically stable with guaranteed γ -level. When the local output measurements
are quantized before passing to the controller, we consider the local channel quan-
tizer in a generalized form with a zoom parameter that can be adjusted on-line. We
develop a local output-dependent procedure for updating the quantizer parameters
to retain the delay-dependent asymptotic stability and guaranteed performance of
the closed-loop quantized system.
5.1.1 Problem Statement
We consider a class of linear systems S structurally composed of ns coupled sub-
systems Sj and the model of the jth subsystem is described by the state-space rep-
resentation:
Sj:
˙xj(t) = Ajxj(t) + Adjxj(t −τj(t)) + Bjuj(t) + Γjwj(t)

(5.2)
yj(t) = Cjxj(t) + Cdjxj(t −τj(t)) + Λjwj(t),
(5.3)
where for j ∈{1,...,ns}, xj(t) ∈ℜnj is the state vector, uj(t) ∈ℜmj is the con-
trol input, yj(t) ∈ℜpj is the measured output, wj(t) ∈ℜqj is the disturbance in-
put which belongs to L2[0,∞), zj(t) ∈ℜqj is the performance output. The matri-
ces Aj ∈ℜnj×nj , Bj ∈ℜnj ×mj , Adj ∈ℜnj×nj , Φj ∈ℜqj×qj , Γj ∈ℜnj×qj , Cj ∈

ℜpj ×nj , Cdj ∈ℜpj×nj , Gj ∈ℜqj×nj , Gdj ∈ℜqj×nj , Λj ∈ℜpj ×qj , Fjk ∈ℜpj×qj
and Ejk ∈ℜpj×qj are real and constants. The initial condition κj ∈L2[−ϱj,0],
j ∈{1,...,ns}. The factors τj,ηjk, j,k ∈{1,...,ns} are unknown time-varying
delay factors satisfying
0 ≤τj(t) ≤ϱj,
˙τj(t) ≤μj,
(5.4)
0 ≤ηjk(t) ≤ϱjk,
˙ηjk(t) ≤μjk,
where the bounds ϱj, ϱjk, μj, μjk are known constants in order to guarantee smooth
growth of the state trajectories. Note in (5.3) that the delay within each subsystem
(local delay) and among the subsystems (coupling delay), respectively, are empha-
sized. The class of systems described by (5.1)–(5.3) subject to delay-pattern (5.4) is
frequently encountered in modeling several physical systems and engineering appli-
cations including large space structures, multi-machine power systems, cold mills,
transportation systems, water pollution management, to name a few [25, 30]. In
what follows, we study the problem of decentralized H∞feedback control for a
class of linear interconnected continuous-time systems with quantized signals in the
subsystem control channel.
5.1.2 Local Quantizer Description
A block-diagram representation of the subsystem model (5.3) under consideration
is depicted in Fig. 5.1. In the sequel, we adopt the deﬁnition of a local (subsystem)
quantizer with general form as introduced in [21]. Let fj ∈ℜs, j = 1,...,ns be
the variable being quantized. A local quantizer is deﬁned as a piecewise constant
function Qj : ℜs →Dj, where Dj is a ﬁnite subset of ℜs. This leads to a partition
of ℜs into a ﬁnite number of quantization regions of the form {fj ∈ℜs : Q(fj) =
dj,dj ∈Dj}. These quantization regions are not assumed to have any particular
shape. We assume that there exist positive real numbers Mj and Δj such that the
following conditions hold:
Fig. 5.1 Subsystem model
with quantizer

Decentralized Quantized Control
1.
If |fj| ≤Mj
then |Qj(fj) −fj| ≤Δj.
(5.5)
2.
If |fj| > Mj
then |Qj(fj)| > Mj −Δj.
(5.6)
We note that condition (5.5) provides a bound on the quantization error when the
quantizer does not saturate. Condition (5.6) gives a way to detect the possibility of
saturation. In the sequel, Mj and Δj will be referred to as the range of Qj and
the quantization error, respectively. Henceforth, we assume that Q(x) = 0 for x
in some neighborhood of the origin. The foregoing requirements are met by the
quantizer with rectangular quantization regions [5, 19].
In the control strategy to be developed below, we will use local quantized mea-
surements of the form
Qμj (fj) = μjQj
 fj
μj

,
(5.7)
where μj > 0 is the subsystem parameter. Observe, at the subsystem level, the ex-
treme case μj = 0 is regarded as setting the output of the local quantizer as zero.
This local quantizer has the range Mjμj and the quantization error Δjμj. We can
view μj as a local zoom variable: increasing μj corresponds to zooming out and es-
sentially generating a new local quantizer with larger range and larger quantization
error, whilst decreasing μj implies zooming in and obtaining a local quantizer with
smaller range and smaller quantization error. We will update μj later on depending
on the subsystem state (or the subsystem output). In some sense, it can regarded as
additional state of the resultant closed-loop subsystem.
5.1.3 Static Output-Feedback Design
In this section, we develop new criteria for LMI-based characterization of decen-
tralized stabilization by local static output-feedback. Initially without quantization
(meaning that the switch in Fig. 5.1 is closed), we let the local decentralized static
output-feedback has the form
uj(t) = Kojyj(t),
j = 1,...,ns,
(5.8)
where the gain matrices Koj, j = 1,...,N have been selected to guarantee the
closed-loop system, composed of (5.1), (5.3) and (5.8), given by

Decentralized Quantized Control
Remark 5.1 We note that the case of decentralized state feedback control uj(t) =
Kjxj(t), j = 1,...,ns can be readily from Theorem 5.1 by setting Cj ≡Ij,
Cdj ≡0, Edj ≡0, Λj ≡0 so that the resulting closed-loop system is asymptoti-
cally stable with guaranteed H∞performance.
5.1.4 Quantized Output-Feedback Design
Focusing on the availability of quantized local output information (meaning that the
switch in Fig. 5.1 is open), we modify the static output feedback (5.8) using the
quantized information of yj as
uj(t) = μjKojQj
yj(t)
μj

,
j = 1,...,ns.
(5.28)
For any ﬁxed scalar μj > 0, the closed-loop system, composed of (5.1), (5.3) and
(5.28) is given by
˙xj(t) = Ajxj(t) + Adjxj(t −τj(t)) + cj(t) + Ωjwj(t) + Hj(μj,yj),
zj(t) = Gjxj(t) + Gdjxj(t −τj(t)) + Φjwj(t),
Aj = Aj + BjKojCj,
Adj = Adj + BjKojCdj,

Ωj = Γj + BjKojΨj,
Hj(μj,yj) = μjBjKoj

Qj
yj(t)

−yj(t)
μj

.
Next, we move to examine the stability and desired disturbance attenuation level of
the closed-loop system (5.29) in the presence of the quantization error. We employ
the LKF (5.11) and consider that the gains Koj are obtained from application of
Theorem 5.1. The following theorem establishes the main design result for subsys-
tem Sj.
Theorem 5.3 Given the bounds ϱj > 0, μj > 0, ϱjk > 0, μjk > 0 and tuning pa-
rameters βj, σj, j,k = 1,...,ns. If the local quantizer Mj is selected large enough
with respect to Δj while adjusting the local scalar αj so as to satisfy the inequality
Mj > 4Δj
∥PjBjKoj∥
λm(Λj)
∥Cj + αjCdj∥.
(5.30)
Then, the family of subsystems {Sj} where {Sj} is described by (5.1)–(5.3) is delay-
dependent asymptotically stabilizable with L2-performance bound γj by decentral-
ized quantized output-feedback controller (5.28).

letting ∥xj(t −τj)∥≤αj∥xj(t)∥, αj > 0 and manipulating to get

It follows from (5.30), we can always ﬁnd a scalar βj ∈(0,1) such that

(5.36)
At the extreme case |yj| = 0, we set μj = 0 so that the output of the local quantizer
is considered zero and therefore (5.36) holds true. This, in turn, implies that we can
always select μj so that (5.36) is satisﬁed, (5.33) holds and hence

where ˆΠj is given by (5.26) for some vector χj(t,s). The rest of the proof follows
from Theorem 5.1.

Decentralized Quantized Control
Remark 5.2 For the case of decentralized state feedback control uj(t) = Kjxj(t),
j = 1,...,ns, then Theorem 5.3 specializes to the following corollary.
Corollary 5.1 Given the bounds ϱj > 0, μj > 0. If the local quantizer Mj is se-
lected large enough with respect to Δj while adjusting the local scalar αj so as to
satisfy the inequality
Mj > 4Δj

(5.38)
Then, the family of subsystems {Sj} where Sj is described by (5.1)–(5.3) is delay-
dependent asymptotically stabilizable with L2-performance bound γj by decentral-
ized quantized state-feedback controller
uj(t) = μjKjQj
xj(t)

,
j = 1,...,ns.
Remark 5.3 By the mean-value theorem and following [14], it can be shown that
λm(Pj)∥xj∥2 ≤Vj ≤ϑj∥κj∥2 where
ϑj =

λM(Pj) + ϱj[λM(Zj) + λM(Wj)] + 3ϱ2
j[λM(At
jAj) + (λM(At
djAdj)]

.
Based on the results of [21], we deﬁne the local ellipsoids
Boj(μj) := {xj : xt
jPjxj ≤λm(PjM2
jμ2
j},
Bsj(μj) := {xj : xt
jPjxj ≤λM(PjD2
jΔ2
j(1 + σj)2μ2
j},
Dj := 2∥PjBjKoj∥
λm(Λj)
∥Cj + αjCdj∥.
In the “zooming-in” stage, it can be inferred that Bsj(μj) ⊂Boj(μj) are invariant
regions for system (5.29) given σj > 0. Moreover, all solutions of (5.29) that start
in Boj(μj) enter Bsj(μj) in ﬁnite time.
Remark 5.4 The introduction of the local scalar αj stems from stability considera-
tion of system (5.29) in the light of Razumikhin theory [26]. It is crucial to recognize
that it plays a basic role in steering the trajectories of (5.29) towards the ﬁnal ellip-
soid Bsj(μj). This is a distinct feature of quantized time-delay systems.
Remark 5.5 We note in Theorem 5.3 and Corollary 5.1 there are several degrees of
freedom to achieve the desired stability with guaranteed performance, particularly
since both the off-line gain computation and the on-line quantized feedback are
decentralized. This is a salient feature of the developed results of this chapter, which
is not shared by several published results [2, 28, 30, 31].

Remark 5.6 It is signiﬁcant to note that Theorem 5.5 provides an improved nominal
result over [6] and gives an explicit expression for the quantized output feedback
gain. In addition, the result is valid for arbitrary number of subsystems and not
restricted to ns = 2 as in [6].
5.2 Decentralized Quantized Control II: Continuous Systems
Quantization in control systems has been an active research topic in recent years,
see [11, 13]. Control problems under different types of quantizations in both, linear

Decentralized Quantized Control
and nonlinear cases have been examined. The need for quantization arises when dig-
ital networks are part of the feedback loop and this eventually gives rise to packet
dropouts or data transfer rate limitations [17]. On the other hand, signal process-
ing and signal quantization always exist in computer-based control systems [22]
and therefore recent research studies have been reported on the analysis and design
problems for control systems involving various quantization methods, see [5, 8, 19,
21, 33, 34] and the references cited therein.
In [5], a quantizer taking value in a ﬁnite set is deﬁned and then quantized feed-
back stabilization for linear systems is considered. In [8], the problem of stabilizing
an unstable linear system by means of quantized state feedback, where the quan-
tizer takes value in a countable set is addressed. It should be noted that the approach
in [5] relies on the possibility of making discrete on line adjustments of quantizer
parameters which was extended in [21] for more general nonlinear systems with
general types of quantizers involving the states of the system, the measured out-
puts, and the control inputs. Recently in [11], a study of quantized and delayed
state-feedback control systems under constant bounds on the quantization error
and the time-varying delay was reported. Based on [21], stabilization of discrete-
time LTI systems with quantized measurement outputs is reported in [29]. Further
related results are reported in [33, 34]. On another research front, decentralized
stability and feedback stabilization of interconnected systems have been the topic
of recurring interests and recent relevant results have been reported in [2, 24–28,
31].
In this section, we develop an approach to the problem of quantized feedback
stabilization from a generalized setting by designing a decentralized H∞feedback
control for a class of linear interconnected continuous-time systems with unknown-
but-bounded couplings and interval delays and where the quantizer has arbitrary
form that satisﬁes a quadratic inequality constraint. An LMI-based method using
a decentralized quantized output-feedback controller is designed at the subsystem
level to render the closed-loop system delay-dependent asymptotically stable with
guaranteed γ -level. It is established that this setting encompasses several special
cases of interest including interconnected delay-free systems, single time-delay sys-
tems and single systems.
5.2.1 Problem Statement
We consider a class of linear systems S structurally composed of ns coupled sub-
systems Sj and the model of the jth subsystem is described by the state-space rep-
resentation:
Sj:
˙xj(t) = Ajxj(t) + Adjxj(t −τj(t)) + Bjuj(t) + cj(t) + Γjwj(t), (5.49)
zj(t) = Gjxj(t) + Gdjxj(t −τj(t)) + Φjwj(t),
(5.50)
yj(t) = Cjxj(t) + Cdjxj(t −τj(t)) + Ψjwj(t),

where for j ∈{1,...,ns}, xj(t) ∈ℜnj is the state vector, uj(t) ∈ℜmj is the con-
trol input, yj(t) ∈ℜpj is the measured output, wj(t) ∈ℜqj is the disturbance in-
put which belongs to L2[0,∞), zj(t) ∈ℜqj is the performance output. The ma-
trices Aj ∈ℜnj×nj , Bj ∈ℜnj ×mj , Adj ∈ℜnj ×nj , Φj ∈ℜqj×qj , Γj ∈ℜnj×qj ,
Cj ∈ℜpj ×nj , Cdj ∈ℜpj×nj , Gj ∈ℜqj×nj , Gdj ∈ℜqj×nj , Ψj ∈ℜpj×qj are real
and constants. The initial condition κj ∈L2[−ϱj,0], j ∈{1,...,ns}. In the sequel,
we treat the interaction term cj(t) as a piecewise-continuous vector function in its
arguments and satisﬁes the quadratic inequality
ct
j(t)cj(t) ≤φjxt
j(t)Et
jEjxj(t) + ψjxt
j(t −τj(t))Et
djEdjxj(t −τj(t)),
(5.51)
where φj > 0, ψj > 0 are adjustable bounding parameters. The factors τj, j,k ∈
{1,...,ns} are unknown time-delay factors satisfying
0 < ϕj ≤τj(t) ≤ϱj,
˙τj(t) ≤ηj,
(5.52)
where the bounds τ−
j , τ +
j , ηj are known constants in order to guarantee smooth
growth of the state trajectories. Note in (5.50) and (5.51) that the delay within each
subsystem (local delay) and among the subsystems (coupling delay), respectively,
are emphasized. A block-diagram representation of the subsystem model (5.50) is
depicted in Fig. 5.2.
The class of systems described by (5.49)–(5.50) subject to delay-pattern (5.52) is
frequently encountered in modeling several physical systems and engineering appli-
cations including large space structures, multi-machine power systems, cold mills,
transportation systems, water pollution management, to name a few [25]. In the
course of feedback control design, it is often considered that the process output
is passed directly to the controller. A control input signal is generated and in turn
passes it directly back to the process. In many applications, it turns out that the in-
terface between the controller and the process features some additional information-
processing devices. Of interest in this chapter is the issue of signal quantization.
Our objective in this section is to address a generalized approach to examine
the problem of quantized feedback stabilization for a class of linear interconnected
continuous-time systems. In this approach, we think of a quantizer as a device that
converts a real-valued signal into a piecewise constant one taking on a ﬁnite set of
values and wherein it is possible to vary some parameters of the quantizer in real
time, on the basis of collected data. We seek to design a decentralized H∞feedback
control for a class of linear interconnected continuous-time systems with unknown-
but-bounded couplings and interval delays
Remark 5.7 In general, the vector c(t) = ns
j cj(t) represents the interaction pat-
tern among the subsystems wherein the component vector cj(t) depends on the
current and delayed states of the form cj(t) = ns
ℓ̸=j Ajℓxℓ(t) + Adjℓxℓ(t −τℓ(t)).

it has been a common practice [24] to rearrange the terms in a convenient way
so as to reﬂect within the jth-subsystem the appropriate components leading to
the bounding inequality (5.51) with adjustable bounding parameters φj, ψj. Note
in (5.49) and (5.51) that the subsystem delay with local and coupling patterns are
emphasized and in numerical simulations, all the subsystems have to be treated si-
multaneously. An overall feasible solution of system S is only guaranteed if the
feasible solutions of subsystems Sj are attained. Thus the rationale behind inequal-
ity (5.51) is to help in inducing decentralized computations.
The quantizer can be thought of as a coder that generates an encoded signal
taking values in a given ﬁnite set. By changing the size and relative position of
the quantization regions, that is, by modifying the coding mechanism we can learn
more about the behavior of the system, without violating the restriction on the type
of information that can be communicated to the controller.
5.2.2 A Class of Local Quantizers
In the sequel, we treat a quantizer as a device in the control loop that converts
a real-valued signal into a piecewise constant one. We adopt the deﬁnition of a
local (subsystem) quantizer with general form as introduced in [21]. Let fj ∈ℜs,
j = 1,...,ns be the variable being quantized. A local quantizer is deﬁned as a
piecewise constant function Qj : ℜs →Dj, where Dj is a ﬁnite subset of ℜs. This
leads to a partition of ℜs into a ﬁnite number of quantization regions of the form
{fj ∈ℜs : Q(fj) = dj, dj ∈Dj}. These quantization regions are not assumed to
have any particular shape.
In the quantized control strategy to be developed below, we will use the local
quantization error Δj(y) = Qj(yj) −yj (see Fig. 5.5) based on output measure-
ments such that the following quadratic bounding relation is satisﬁed:
Δt
j(.)Δj(.) ≤αjxt
j(t)F t
jFjxj(t) + βjxt
j(t −τj(t))F t
djFdjxj(t −τj(t)), (5.53)
where αj > 0, βj > 0 are adjustable subsystem parameters and the matrices Ej, Fj
are arbitrary but constants.
Remark 5.8 It is crucial to recognize that the quadratic bounding relation (5.53) is
independent of the structure of the quantizer employed. In fact, it is satisﬁed by wide
class of practically-used quantizers. For example, in case of uniform quantizer [5,
21] for delay-free systems τj ≡0, we assume that given positive integer Mj (satu-
ration value) and nonnegative real number Σj (sensitivity), the quantizer Q(fj) is

Typical simulation would certainly shows that the uniform quantizer satisﬁes the
quadratic bounding relation (5.53) with fj(t) = Cjxj(t). Alternatively, in the case
of static logarithmic quantizer [13] for delay-free systems, we assume that given
real numbers εj,ϱj ∈(0,1), the quantizer Q(εj) is deﬁned by:

where ϱj represents the quantization density at subsystem j and δj = (1 −ϱj)/
(1 + ϱj). Observe that a small ϱj corresponds to large δj and this implies coarse
quantization. Alternatively, a large ϱj means small δj which leads to coarse quanti-
zation. From consideration of the behavior of the static logarithmic quantizer, we
reach the conclusion that it satisﬁes a quadratic bounding relation with εj(t) =
Cjxj(t). Since extension to time-delay systems is quite straightforward hence, we
will employ the bounding inequality (5.53) in the subsequent analysis.
5.2.3 Quantized Output-Feedback Design
We develop in this section new criteria for LMI-based characterization of decentral-
ized stabilization by local quantized feedback of the form
uj(t) = KojQj(yj),
j = 1,...,ns,
(5.54)

where the gain matrices Koj,j = 1,...,N will be selected to guarantee that the
closed-loop system, composed of (5.49)–(5.50), (5.53) and (5.54), given by
˙xj(t) = Ajxj(t) + Adjxj(t −τj(t)) + cj(t) + BjKojΔj(yj) + Ωjwj(t),
zj(t) = Gjxj(t) + Gdjxj(t −τj(t)) + Φjwj(t),
(5.55)
Aj = Aj + BjKojCj,
Adj = Adj + BjKojCdj,
Ωj = Γj + BjKojΨj
is asymptotically stable with disturbance attenuation level γj. To facilitate fur-
ther development, we consider the case where the set of output matrices Cj,
j = 1,...,ns are assumed to be of full row rank and C†
j represents the right-inverse.
Introduce the local Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF):
Vj(t) = Vjo(t) + Vja(t) + Vjc(t) + Vje(t) + Vjm(t) + Vjn(t),

j are weighting matrices of appropriate dimensions. The main design
result is established by the following theorem.

where Ξj corresponds to "

Πj < 0 so is Ξj < 0, leading to ˙Vj(t) ≤−ωj∥ξj∥2.

5.2.4 Special Cases
In the sequel, some special cases are derived to emphasize the generality of our
approach. These include nominal delay-free systems, single time-delay systems and
single dynamical systems.
5.2.4.1 Delay-Free Systems
First, we consider the class of nominally-linear systems S structurally composed of
ns coupled subsystems Sj and the model of the jth subsystem is described by the
state-space representation:

5.2

Sj:
˙xj(t) = Ajxj(t) + Bjuj(t) + cj(t) + Γjwj(t),
(5.66)
zj(t) = Gjxj(t) + Φjwj(t),
yj(t) = Cjxj(t) + Ψjwj(t),
(5.67)
where for j ∈{1,...,ns}, the coupling vector cj(k) is a piecewise-continuous vec-
tor function in its arguments and satisﬁes the quadratic inequality
ct
j(k,.,.)cj(k,.,.) ≤φjxt
j(k)Et
jEjxj(k),
(5.68)
where φj > 0 are adjustable bounding parameters and Mj ∈ℜnj×nj are constant
matrices. We will use local quantized output measurements such that the following
quadratic bounding relation is satisﬁed:
Δt
j(.)Δj(.) ≤αjxt
j(k)F t
jFjxj(k),
(5.69)
where αj > 0 are adjustable subsystem parameters. The following corollary stands
out:

bound γ if there exist weighting matrices 0 < Xj, Yj, Λmj; m = 1,2, and scalars

(5.72)
zj(t) = Gx(t) + Gdx(t −τ(t)) + Φw(t),

Decentralized Quantized Control
where 0 < ϕ ≤τ(t) ≤ϱ, ˙τ(t) ≤η. Like before, we will use quantized output mea-
surements such that the following quadratic bounding relation is satisﬁed:

dFdx(k −τ(t)),

where α > 0, β > 0 are adjustable parameters. The following corollary establishes
the corresponding design result:

Typical simulation results are shown in Figs. 5.6 and 5.7 for the open-loop response
and closed-loop response of both subsystems. Next, by considering the class of in-
terconnected linear systems S given by (5.66)–(5.67) and implementing the LMI
(5.75), the feasible solution is found to yield the gains

The ensuing closed-loop response is plotted in Fig. 5.10. From the ensuing results,
it is quite evident that the quantized feedback control system is asymptotically sta-
ble for the class of quantizers satisfying the quadratic inequality. This holds true for
interconnected time-delay and delay-free systems, single time-delay systems and
single systems. The crucial point to record is that the type of quantizer is irrelevant
so long as its structure complies with a quadratic inequality. We have observed that
the presence of bounding inequalities (5.51) and (5.53) helps in curbing the magni-
tude of the feedback gains.

5.3 Decentralized Quantized Control I: Discrete Systems
In what follows, we build upon [5, 21] and extend them further to the class of lin-
ear interconnected discrete-time systems with unknown-but-bounded couplings and
interval time-delays. Speciﬁcally, we study the problem of decentralized H∞feed-
back control for this class of systems where quantized signals exist in the subsystem
control channel.
5.3.1 Introduction
It is well known that most of data and/or signals in conventional feedback con-
trol theory are processed in a direct manner. In emerging control systems including
networks, all signals are transferred through network and this eventually gives rise
to packet dropouts or data transfer rate limitations [17]. On the other hand, sig-
nal processing and signal quantization always exist in computer-based control sys-
tems [22] and therefore recent research studies have been reported on the analysis
and design problems for control systems involving various quantization methods
[5, 8, 11, 21, 29]. In [5], a quantizer taking value in a ﬁnite set is deﬁned and then
quantized feedback stabilization for linear systems is considered. The problem of
stabilizing an unstable linear system by means of quantized state feedback, where
the quantizer takes value in a countable set, is addressed in [8]. It should be noted
that the approach in [5] relies on the possibility of making discrete on line adjust-
ments of quantizer parameters which was extended in [21] for more general nonlin-
ear systems with general types of quantizers involving the states of the system, the
measured outputs, and the control inputs. In [11], study of quantized and delayed
state-feedback control systems under constant bounds on the quantization error and
the time-varying delay was reported. Based on [20], stabilization of discrete-time
LTI systems with quantized measurement outputs is reported in [29]. Further re-
lated results are reported in [33, 34].
On another research front, decentralized stability and feedback stabilization of
interconnected systems have been the topic of recurring interests and recent relevant
results have been reported in [2, 24–28, 31].
A block-diagram representation of the subsystem model is depicted in Fig. 5.11.
In this regard, an LMI-based decentralized static output-feedback controller
(when the switch in Fig. 5.1 is closed) is designed at the subsystem level using
only local variables to render the overall closed-loop system is delay-dependent
asymptotically stable with guaranteed γ -level and this results provides an important
contribution for interconnected discrete systems [2]. When the local output mea-
surements are quantized before passing to the controller (corresponding to open-
ing the switch in Fig. 5.1), we consider the local channel quantizer in a gener-
alized form with a zoom parameter that can be adjusted on-line. We develop a
local output-dependent procedure for updating the quantizer parameters to retain

loop quantized system. Several special cases of interest are derived and are shown
to provide improved results over the existing literature.
5.3.2 Problem Description
We consider a class of linear systems S structurally composed of ns coupled sub-
systems Sj and the model of the jth subsystem is described by the state-space rep-
resentation:
xj(k + 1) = Ajxj(k) + Djxj(k −dj(k)) + Bjuj(k) + cj(k) + Γjwj(k), (5.82)
zj(k) = Gjxj(k) + Ljxj(k −dj(k)) + Φjwj(k),
yj(k) = Cjxj(k) + Ejxj(k −dj(k)) + Ψjwj(k),
(5.83)
where for j ∈{1,...,ns}, xj(k) ∈ℜnj is the state vector, uj(k) ∈ℜmj is the control
input, yj(k) ∈ℜpj is the control output, wj(k) ∈ℜqj is the disturbance input which
belongs to ℓ2[0,∞), zj(k) ∈ℜqj is the performance output and cj(k) ∈ℜnj is the
coupling vector. The matrices Aj ∈ℜnj×nj , Bj ∈ℜnj ×mj , Dj ∈ℜqj×nj , Φj ∈
ℜqj ×qj , Ψj ∈ℜpj×qj , Γj ∈ℜnj×qj , Lj ∈ℜqj ×nj , Gj ∈ℜqj×nj , Cj ∈ℜpj×nj ,
Ej ∈ℜpj ×nj are real and constants. The initial condition κj ∈L2[−ϱj,0], j ∈
{1,...,ns}. In the sequel, we treat cj(k) as a piecewise-continuous vector function
in its arguments and satisﬁes the quadratic inequality
ct
j(k,.,.)cj(k,.,.)
≤φjxt
j(k)Mt
jMjxj(k) + ψjxt
j(k −dj(k))Nt
jNjxj(k −dj(k)),
(5.84)
where φj > 0, ψj > 0 are adjustable bounding parameters and Mj ∈ℜnj×nj , Nj ∈
ℜnj ×nj are constant matrices. The factors dj(k), j ∈{1,...,ns} are unknown time-
delay factors satisfying
0 < d−
j ≤dj(k) ≤d+
j ,
(5.85)
where the bounds d−
j ,d+
j are known constants in order to guarantee smooth growth
of the state trajectories. Note in (5.82) and (5.84) that the delay within each subsys-
tem (local delay) and among the subsystems (coupling delay) are emphasized.

5.3
Decentralized Quantized Control I: Discrete Systems
261
Assumption 5.1 For all θ ∈[−d+
j ,0], there exists a scalar αj > 0 such that
∥xj(k −dj(k))∥≤αj∥xj(k)∥.
(5.86)
It should be emphasized [23] that (5.86) is not restrictive since we treat αj as an
adjustable parameter at the disposal of the designer who will have the freedom to
change it to produce satisfactory system performance.
The class of systems described by (5.82)–(5.83) subject to delay-pattern (5.85) is
frequently encountered in modeling several physical systems and engineering appli-
cations including large space structures, multi-machine power systems, cold mills,
transportation systems, water pollution management, to name a few [25, 27, 28, 30].
5.3.3 Local Quantizers
In the sequel, we adopt the deﬁnition of a local (subsystem) quantizer with general
form as introduced in [21]. Let fj ∈ℜs, j = 1,...,ns be the variable being quan-
tized. A local quantizer is deﬁned as a piecewise constant function Qj : ℜs →Dj,
where Dj is a ﬁnite subset of ℜs. This leads to a partition of ℜs into a ﬁnite number
of quantization regions of the form {fj ∈ℜs : Q(fj) = dj, dj ∈Dj}. These quan-
tization regions are not assumed to have any particular shape. We assume that there
exist positive real numbers Mj and Δj such that the following conditions hold:
1.
If |fj| ≤Mj
then |Qj(fj) −fj| ≤Δj.
(5.87)
2.
If |fj| > Mj
then |Qj(fj)| > Mj −Δj.
(5.88)
We note that condition (5.87) provides a bound on the quantization error when the
quantizer does not saturate. Condition (5.88) gives a way to detect the possibility
of saturation. In the sequel, Mj and Δj will be referred to as the range of Qj and
the quantization error, respectively. Henceforth, we assume that Q(x) = 0 for x
in some neighborhood of the origin. The foregoing requirements are met by the
quantizer with rectangular quantization regions [5, 19].
In the control strategy to be developed below, we will use local quantized mea-
surements of the form
Qμj (fj) = μjQj
 fj
μj

,
(5.89)
where μj > 0 is an adjustable subsystem parameter.
Remark 5.9 Observe that, at the subsystem level, the extreme case μj = 0 is re-
garded as setting the output of the local quantizer as zero. This local quantizer has
the range Mjμj and the quantization error Δjμj. Thus, we can view μj as a local
zoom variable: increasing μj corresponds to zooming out and essentially generating
a new local quantizer with larger range and larger quantization error, whilst decreas-
ing μj implies zooming in and obtaining a local quantizer with smaller range and

262
5
Decentralized Quantized Control
smaller quantization error. We will update μj later on depending on the subsystem
state (or the subsystem output). In some sense, it can regarded as additional state of
the resultant closed-loop subsystem.
Next, we examine the output-feedback control design.
5.3.4 Static Output-Feedback Design
In this section, we develop new criteria for LMI-based characterization of decen-
tralized stabilization by local static output-feedback. Initially, without quantization,
we let the local decentralized static output-feedback has the form
uj(k) = Kojyj(k),
j = 1,...,ns,
(5.90)
where the gain matrices Koj, j = 1,...,N have been selected to guarantee the
closed-loop system, composed of (5.82)–(5.84) and (5.90), given by
xj(k + 1) = Ajxj(k) + Djxj(k −dj(k)) + cj(k) + Ωjwj(k),
(5.91)
zj(k) = Gjxj(k) + Ljxj(k −dj(k)) + Φjwj(k),
yj(k) = Cjxj(k) + Ejxj(k −dj(k)) + Ψjwj(k),
(5.92)
Aj = Aj + BjKojCj,
Dj = Dj + BjKojEj,
Ωj = Γj + BjKojΨj
(5.93)
is asymptotically stable with disturbance attenuation level γj. To facilitate fur-
ther development, we consider the case where the set of output matrices Cj,j =
1,...,ns are assumed to be of full row rank and C†
j represents the right-inverse.
Introduce the local Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF):
Vj(k) = xt

m=k−dj(k)

(5.94)
where 0 < Pj,0 < Qj are weighting matrices of appropriate dimensions.
The following theorem establishes the main design result, without quantization,
for subsystem Sj.
Theorem 5.7 Given the bounds d−
j > 0, d+
j > 0, j = 1,...,ns, then the family of
subsystems {Sj} where Sj is described by (5.82)–(5.83) is delay-dependent asymp-
totically stabilizable by decentralized static output-feedback controller uj(t) =
Kojyj(t) with L2-performance bound γj if there exist matrices

we combine (5.97)–(5.99) with algebraic manipulations using inequalities (5.84)

It is known that the sufﬁcient condition of subsystem internal stability is ΔVj(k) < 0

for arbitrary j ∈[0,∞), which implies for any ωj(k) ∈ℓ2(0,∞) ̸= 0 that Jj < 0.
Applying the congruent transformation

□
Remark 5.10 It should be emphasized that the LMI variables Πcj, Πsj , Πvj are
independent since the matrices Ej, Ψj might be singular and thus a unique value
of Koj will be produced.
Remark 5.11 We note that the case of decentralized state feedback control uj(t) =
Kjxj(t), j = 1,...,ns can be readily obtained from Theorem 5.7 by setting
Cj ≡Ij, Ej ≡0, Ψj ≡0 so that the resulting closed-loop system is asymptotically
stable with guaranteed H∞performance.
5.3.5 Quantized Output-Feedback Design
Focusing on the availability of quantized local output information, we modify the
static output feedback (5.90) using the quantized information of yj as
uj(k) = μjKojQj
yj(k)

,
j = 1,...,ns.
(5.104)
For any ﬁxed scalar μj > 0, the closed-loop system, composed of (5.82), (5.84) and
(5.104) is given by

(5.107)
where Aj, Dj, Ωj are given by (5.93). Next, we move to examine the stability
and desired disturbance attenuation level of the closed-loop system (5.105) in the
presence of the quantization error. We employ the LKF (5.94) and consider that the
gains Koj are obtained from application of Theorem 5.7. The following theorem
establishes the main design result for subsystem Sj.
Theorem 5.8 Given the bounds d−
j > 0, d+
j > 0, j = 1,...,ns. If the local quan-
tizer Mj is selected large enough with respect to Δj while adjusting the local scalar
αj so as to satisfy the inequality
Mj > Δj
∥(Pj + Ij)BjKoj∥
λm(Λj)
∥Cj + αjEj∥.
(5.108)
Then, the family of subsystems {Sj} where Sj is described by (5.105)–(5.107) is
delay-dependent asymptotically stabilizable with L2-performance bound γj by de-
centralized quantized output-feedback controller (5.104).
Proof Since
yj(k)
μj
= Cjxj(k) + Ejxj(k −dj(k))
μj
is quantized before being passed to the feedback channel, we obtain by using the
properties of local quantizer (5.87) and (5.88) that whenever |yj(k)| ≤Mjμj, the
inequality

(5.116)
At the extreme case |yj| = 0, we set μj = 0 so that the output of the local quantizer
is considered zero and therefore (5.116) holds true. This, in turn, implies that we
can always select μj so that (5.116) is satisﬁed, (5.113) holds and hence

Remark 5.12 For the case of decentralized state feedback control uj(t) = Kjxj(t),
j = 1,...,ns, then Theorem 5.8 specializes to the following corollary:
Corollary 5.5 Given the bounds d−

j > 0, j = 1,...,ns. If the local quan-
tizer Mj is selected large enough with respect to Δj while adjusting the local

(5.118)
Then, the family of subsystems {Sj} where Sj is described by (5.82)–(5.84) is delay-
dependent asymptotically stabilizable with L2-performance bound γj by decentral-
ized quantized state-feedback controller

j = 1,...,ns.
Remark 5.13 By the mean-value theorem and following [15], it can be shown that
λm(Pj)∥xj∥2 ≤Vj ≤ϑj∥κj∥2, where
ϑj =

λM(Pj) + d+

Based on the results of [21], we deﬁne the local ellipsoids
Boj(μj) := {xj : xt

Bsj(μj) := {xj : xt

Dj := ∥(Pj + Ij)BjKoj∥

∥Cj + αjEj∥.
In the “zooming-in” stage, it can be inferred that Bsj(μj) ⊂Boj(μj) are invariant
regions for system (5.107) given σj > 0. Moreover, all solutions of (5.107) that start
in Boj(μj) enter Bsj(μj) in ﬁnite time.

Remark 5.14 It is crucial to recognize that the local scalar αj plays a basic role in
steering the trajectories of (5.107) toward the ﬁnal ellipsoid Bsj(μj). This is a dis-
tinct feature of quantized time-delay systems. It should be noted that the parameters
βj, j = 1,...,ns are introduced in (5.112) to reach the desired estimates and to
handle the interdependence between Hj and (xj,xj(k −dj),cj,ωj). In addition,
the parameters βj, j = 1,...,ns can be adjusted to help satisfying (5.108).
Remark 5.15 We note in Theorem 5.8 and Corollary 5.5 there are several degrees of
freedom to achieve the desired stability with guaranteed performance, particularly
since both the off-line gain computation and the on-line quantized feedback are
decentralized. This is a salient feature of the developed results of this chapter, which
is not shared by several published results [2, 28, 30, 31].
5.3.6 Special Cases
In the sequel, some special cases are derived to emphasize the generality of our
approach. First, we consider the single nominally-linear time-delay system
x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Dx(k −d(k)) + Bu(k) + Γ w(k),
(5.119)
z(k) = Gxj(k) + Lx(k −d(k)) + Φw(k),
y(k) = Cxj(k) + Ex(k −d(k)) + Ψ w(k).
(5.120)
The factor d(k) is an unknown time-delay satisfying 0 < d−≤d(k) ≤d+ where
the bounds d−,d+ are known constants in order to guarantee smooth growth of the
state trajectories. It will be assumed that for all θ ∈[−d+,0], there exists a scalar
α > 0 such that ∥x(k −d(k))∥≤α∥x(k)∥. The following corollary establishes the
corresponding design result:
Corollary 5.6 Given the bounds d−> 0, d+ > 0. Suppose that there exist matrices
X > 0, G, Πc, Πs, Πw and scalar γj > 0 satisfying the following LMI

then system (5.119)–(5.120) is delay-dependent asymptotically stabilizable by quan-
tized output-feedback controller
u(k) = μKoQ

with L2-performance bound γj.
Next, we consider a class of nominally-linear systems S structurally composed
of ns coupled subsystems Sj and the model of the jth subsystem is described by
the state-space representation:
xj(k + 1) = Ajxj(k) + Bjuj(k) + cj(k) + Γjwj(k),
(5.123)
zj(k) = Gjxj(k) + Φjwj(k),
yj(k) = Cjxj(k) + Ψjwj(k).
(5.124)
Similarly, we treat cj(k) as a piecewise-continuous vector function in its arguments
and satisﬁes the quadratic inequality

j(k)Mt
jMjxj(k),
(5.125)
where φj > 0 are adjustable bounding parameters and Mj ∈ℜnj×nj are constant
matrices. The factors dj(k), j ∈{1,...,ns} are unknown time-delay factors satisfy-
ing (5.85). The following corollary stands out:

then the family of subsystems {Sj} where Sj is described by (5.123)–(5.124)
is asymptotically stabilizable by decentralized static output-feedback controller
uj(t) = Kojyj(t) with L2-performance bound γj.
Finally, we consider the single nominally-linear system
x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k) + Γ w(k),
(5.128)
z(k) = Gx(k) + Φw(k),
y(k) = Cx(k) + Ψ w(k).

then system (5.128)–(5.129) is asymptotically stabilizable by quantized output-

Remark 5.16 It is signiﬁcant to note that the results of Corollaries 5.6 through 5.8
establish new designs for quantized output-feedback control. It provides efﬁcient
LMI-based results in comparison with [5, 11, 21, 29].

(5.126) the feasible solution is found to yield the gains

K2 = −1.0915.
The simulation of the closed-loop response of both subsystems are depicted in

Finally, the feasible solution of LMI (5.130) for subsystem 1 without delay terms is

From the ensuing results, it is quite evident that the quantized feedback control
system is asymptotically stable for the class of quantizers satisfying the quadratic

inequality. This is equally true for interconnected time-delay and delay-free systems,
single time-delay systems and single systems. The crucial point to record is that the
type of quantizer so long as it is satisﬁes its structure complies with a quadratic
inequality. We have observed that the presence of bounding inequalities (5.84) and
(5.89) helps in curbing the magnitude of the feedback gains.

5.4 Decentralized Quantized Control II: Discrete Systems
In conventional feedback control theory, most of data and/or signals are processed in
a direct manner. With the emerging control systems including networks, all signals
are transferred through network and this eventually gives rise to packet dropouts or
data transfer rate limitations [17]. On the other hand, signal processing and signal
quantization always exist in computer-based control systems [22] and therefore re-
cent research studies have been reported on the analysis and design problems for
control systems involving various quantization methods, see [5, 8, 11, 21, 29] and
the references cited therein. In [5], a quantizer taking value in a ﬁnite set is deﬁned
and then quantized feedback stabilization for linear systems is considered. In [8],
the problem of stabilizing an unstable linear system by means of quantized state
feedback, where the quantizer takes value in a countable set is addressed. It should

276
5
Decentralized Quantized Control
Fig. 5.16 Closed-loop response of decoupled subsystem 1 (left), decoupled subsystem 2 (right)
be noted that the approach in [5] relies on the possibility of making discrete on
line adjustments of quantizer parameters which was extended in [21] for more gen-
eral nonlinear systems with general types of quantizers involving the states of the
system, the measured outputs, and the control inputs. Recently in [11], a study of
quantized and delayed state-feedback control systems under constant bounds on the
quantization error and the time-varying delay was reported. Based on [21], stabiliza-
tion of discrete-time LTI systems with quantized measurement outputs is reported
in [29]. Further related results are reported in [33, 34]. On another research front,
decentralized stability and feedback stabilization of interconnected systems have
been the topic of recurring interests and recent relevant results have been reported
in [2, 24–28, 31].
5.4.1 Introduction
In this section, we investigate a generalized approach to quantized feedback con-
trol in linear discrete-time system. We cast the problem under consideration as the
problem of designing a decentralized H∞feedback control for a class of linear
interconnected discrete-time systems with quantized signals in the subsystem con-
trol channel. The system has unknown-but-bounded couplings and interval time-
delays. Within our formulation, we take the quantizer of arbitrary form that satisﬁes
a quadratic inequality constraint in the state and the delayed state. We illustrated
the generality of this quantizer structure. Based on quantized output measurements,
a decentralized quantized output-feedback controller is designed at the subsystem
level to render the overall closed-loop system delay-dependent asymptotically sta-
ble with guaranteed γ -level. To further illustrate the generality of the developed
approach, it is established that several classes of quantized feedback control sys-
tems of interest are readily derived as special cases. These include the classes of
interconnected time-delay and delay-free systems, single time-delay systems and
single systems.

5.4.2 Problem Statement
We consider a class of nominally-linear time-delay systems S structurally composed
of ns coupled subsystems Sj and the model of the jth subsystem is described by
the state-space representation:
xj(k + 1) = Ajxj(k) + Djxj(k −dj(k)) + Bjuj(k) + cj(k) + Γjwj(k), (5.132)
zj(k) = Gjxj(k) + Ljxj(k −dj(k)) + Φjwj(k),
yj(k) = Cjxj(k) + Hjxj(k −dj(k)),
(5.133)
where for j ∈{1,...,ns}, xj(k) ∈ℜnj is the state vector, uj(k) ∈ℜmj is the control
input, yj(k) ∈ℜpj is the control output, wj(k) ∈ℜqj is the disturbance input which
belongs to ℓ2[0,∞), zj(k) ∈ℜqj is the performance output and cj(k) ∈ℜnj is
the coupling vector. The matrices Aj ∈ℜnj×nj , Bj ∈ℜnj×mj , Dj ∈ℜqj×nj , Φj ∈
ℜqj ×qj , Γj ∈ℜnj ×qj , Lj ∈ℜqj ×nj , Gj ∈ℜqj ×nj , Cj ∈ℜpj×nj , Ej ∈ℜpj×nj are
real and constants. The initial condition κj ∈L2[−ϱj,0], j ∈{1,...,ns}. In the se-
quel, we treat cj(k) as a piecewise-continuous vector function in its arguments and
satisﬁes the quadratic inequality
ct
j(k,.,.)cj(k,.,.)
≤φjxt
j(k)Mt
jMjxj(k) + ψjxt
j(k −dj(k))Nt
jNjxj(k −dj(k)),
(5.134)
where φj > 0, ψj > 0 are adjustable bounding parameters and Mj ∈ℜnj×nj , Nj ∈
ℜnj ×nj are constant matrices. The factors dj(k), j ∈{1,...,ns} are unknown time-
delay factors satisfying
0 < d−
j ≤dj(k) ≤d+
j ,
(5.135)
where the bounds d−
j , d+
j are known constants in order to guarantee smooth growth
of the state trajectories. Note in (5.132) and (5.134) that the subsystem delay with
local and coupling patterns are emphasized. The class of systems described by
(5.132)–(5.133) subject to delay-pattern (5.135) is frequently encountered in mod-
eling several physical systems and engineering applications including large space
structures, multi-machine power systems, cold mills, transportation systems, water
pollution management, to name a few [25, 30].
5.4.3 A Class of Local Quantizers
In the sequel, we treat a quantizer as a device in the control loop that converts
a real-valued signal into a piecewise constant one. We adopt the deﬁnition of a
local (subsystem) quantizer with general form as introduced in [21]. Let fj ∈ℜs,
j = 1,...,ns be the variable being quantized. A local quantizer is deﬁned as a
piecewise constant function Qj : ℜs →Dj, where Dj is a ﬁnite subset of ℜs. This
leads to a partition of ℜs into a ﬁnite number of quantization regions of the form

278
5
Decentralized Quantized Control
Fig. 5.17 A description of
quantized subsystem model
{fj ∈ℜs : Q(fj) = dj, dj ∈Dj}. These quantization regions are not assumed to
have any particular shape.
In the quantized control strategy to be developed below, we will use the local
quantization error Δj(y) = Qj(yj) −yj (see Fig. 5.17) based on output measure-
ments such that the following quadratic bounding relation is satisﬁed:
Δt
j(.)Δj(.) ≤αjxt
j(k)Et
jEjxj(k)
+ βjxt
j(k −dj(k))F t
jFjxj(k −dj(k)),
(5.136)
where αj > 0, βj > 0 are adjustable subsystem parameters and the matrices Ej,Fj
are arbitrary but constants.
It is crucial to recognize that the quadratic bounding relation (5.136) is indepen-
dent of the structure of the quantizer employed. In fact, it is satisﬁed by wide class
of practically-used quantizers, see Remark 5.8 for further details.
In what follows we seek to design quantized feedback controllers which guaran-
tee the asymptotic stability of the family of subsystems Sj subject to the structural
constraints (5.134)–(5.136).
5.4.4 Quantized Feedback Design
In this section, we develop new criteria for LMI-based characterization of decen-
tralized stabilization by local quantized feedback of the form
uj(k) = KojQj(yj),
j = 1,...,ns,
(5.137)
where the gain matrices Koj,j = 1,...,N will be selected to guarantee that the
closed-loop system, composed of (5.132)–(5.134), (5.136) and (5.137), given by
xj(k + 1) = Ajxj(k) + Djxj(k −dj(k)) + cj(k) + BjKojΔj(yj) + Γjwj(k),
Aj = Aj + BjKojCj,
Dj = Dj + BjKojHj,
(5.138)
zj(k) = Gjxj(k) + Ljxj(k −dj(k)) + Φjwj(k)
(5.139)
is asymptotically stable with disturbance attenuation level γj. To facilitate fur-
ther development, we consider the case where the set of output matrices Cj, j =

ΔVj(k) = [Ajxj(k) + Djxj(k −dj(k)) + cj(k) + BjKojΔj(yj)]tPj

we combine (5.143)–(5.145) with algebraic manipulations using inequalities (5.134)

5.4.5 Special Cases
In the sequel, some special cases are derived to emphasize the generality of our
approach. First, we consider the single nominally-linear time-delay system
x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Dx(k −d(k)) + Bu(k) + Γ w(k),
(5.150)
z(k) = Gxj(k) + Lx(k −d(k)) + Φw(k),
y(k) = Cxj(k) + Ex(k −d(k)),
(5.151)
where 0 < d−≤d(k) ≤d+. Let d∗= d+ −d−+ 1. We will use local quantized
output measurements such that the following quadratic bounding relation is satis-
ﬁed:
Δt(.)Δ(.) ≤αxt(k)EtEx(k) + βxt(k −d(k))F tFx(k −d(k)),
(5.152)
where α > 0, β > 0 are adjustable subsystem parameters. The following corollary
establishes the corresponding design result:

Moreover, the local gain matrix is given by Ko = GX −1C†.
Next, we consider a class of nominally-linear systems S structurally composed
of ns coupled subsystems Sj and the model of the jth subsystem is described by
the state-space representation:
xj(k + 1) = Ajxj(k) + Bjuj(k) + cj(k) + Γjwj(k),
(5.155)
zj(k) = Gjxj(k) + Φjwj(k),
yj(k) = Cjxj(k),
(5.156)
where for j ∈{1,...,ns}, the coupling vector cj(k) is a piecewise-continuous vec-
tor function in its arguments and satisﬁes the quadratic inequality

It is found that the feasible solution of LMI (5.141) is attained at

Typical simulation results are shown in Figs. 5.18, 5.19, 5.20 and 5.21 for the open-
loop response and closed-loop response of both subsystems. Next, by dropping the
time-delay factors (within the subsystems and across the couplings) and considering
LMI (5.141) the feasible solution is found to yield the gains
K1 = −0.6653,
K2 = −1.0915.
The simulation of the closed-loop response of both subsystems are depicted in
Figs. 5.22 and 5.23. On implementing the LMI (5.153) for subsystem 2, the feasible
solution is given by
d−= 20,
d+

K2 = −1.3391.
The ensuing closed-loop response is plotted in Fig. 5.24. Finally, the feasible solu-
tion of LMI (5.153) for subsystem 1 without delay terms is K1 = −0.3039 and the
corresponding closed-loop response is plotted in Fig. 5.25.
From the ensuing re-

sults, it is quite evident that the quantized feedback control system is asymptotically
stable for the class of quantizers satisfying the quadratic inequality. This is equally
true for interconnected time-delay and delay-free systems, single time-delay sys-
tems and single systems. The crucial point to record is that the type of quantizer
so long as it is satisﬁes its structure complies with a quadratic inequality. We have
observed that the presence of bounding inequalities (5.134) and (5.136) helps in
curbing the magnitude of the feedback gains.

Nonlinearities
In this section, we build upon [3, 10, 18] and extend them further to the class of
linear interconnected discrete-time systems with unknown-but-bounded couplings
and overﬂow nonlinearities.
5.5.1 Introduction
In the implementation of discrete-time systems using computer or special-purpose
hardware with ﬁxed-point arithmetic, one frequently encounters several kinds of

response of decoupled

overﬂow nonlinearities [1, 3]. On the other hand, quantization effects are present in
most control systems, as they heavily rely on digital components, and research on
quantized feedback control where a quantizer is regarded as an information coder.
The fundamental question of interest is how much information needs to be commu-
nicated by the quantizer in order to achieve a certain control objective [5, 8, 9, 11,
12, 32].
When a digital network is present in a feedback system, quantization levels deter-
mine the data rate for the transmission of control-related signals and hence the cost
for communication [18, 21]. In effect, such overﬂow nonlinearities and/or quanti-
zation may lead to instability in the realized system. An important objective in the
design of a discrete-time system is, therefore, to ﬁnd the values of the system param-

eters in the parameter space so that the designed system is globally asymptotically
stable. Robust stability analysis of discrete-time systems that include nonlinearities
and parameter uncertainties in their physical models is an important problem. So
far, very little attention has been paid for the investigation of this problem [3, 10].
On another research front, decentralized stability and feedback stabilization of
interconnected systems have been the topic of recurring interests and recent relevant
results have been reported in [2, 22, 31].
In what follows, LMI-based decentralized feedback controller is designed at the
subsystem level using only local state variables to render the overall closed-loop
system asymptotically stable. When the local output measurements are processed to
the controller, we develop a set of local observer-based output-feedback controller to

Decentralized Quantized Control
guarantee the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop quantized system. Numerical
simulations are performed to illustrate the theoretical developments.
5.5.2 Problem Statement
We consider a class of discrete-time systems S described by:
x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k),
(5.166)
where x(k) ∈ℜn is the overall state vector, u(k) ∈ℜm is the control input,
A ∈ℜn×n, B ∈ℜn×m are real and constant matrices and the initial condition
ϕ ∈ℓ2[−dM,0]. In what follows, we consider S to be structurally composed of
ns coupled subsystems Sj with the jth subsystem being described by:
xj(k + 1) = Ajxj(k) + Bjuj(k) + cj(k),
(5.167)
where for j ∈{1,...,ns}, xj(k) ∈ℜnj is the local state vector, uj(k) ∈ℜmj
is the local control input and cj(k) ∈ℜnj is the coupling vector. The matrices
Aj ∈ℜnj ×nj , Bj ∈ℜnj×mj are real and constants such that
A = blockdiag[A1, A2, ..., Ans],
B = blockdiag[B1, B2, ..., Bns].
In the sequel, we treat cj(k) as a piecewise-continuous vector function in its argu-
ments and satisﬁes the quadratic inequality
ct
j(k,.,.)cj(k,.,.) ≤
ns

m=1,m̸=j
xt
j(k)Emjxj(k),
(5.168)
where the matrices Emj ∈ℜnj×nj are constants. The rationale behind the quadratic
inequality (5.168) is to preserve the decentralized information structure constraints
and it has global nature as the right-hand side depends on all local states.
The class of systems described by (5.166) subject to delay-pattern is frequently
encountered in modeling several physical systems and engineering applications in-
cluding large space structures, multi-machine power systems, cold mills, transporta-
tion systems, water pollution management, to name a few [22, 30]. Our objective in
this work is to design appropriate control signals at the subsystem level to stabilize
the overall system (5.166).
5.5.3 Local Static Control Function
In order to cope with the effects of quantization and/or overﬂow nonlinearities, we
consider that the controller generates the signal
uj(k) = Kjfj(xj(k)),
(5.169)

5.5.4 Closed-Loop Stabilization
The closed loop subsystem of (5.167) and (5.169) is given by
xj(k + 1) = [Aj + BjKj]xj(k) + BjKjej(k) + cj(k)

5.5.5 Local Dynamic Control Function
An alternative method to handle the effects of quantization and/or overﬂow nonlin-
earities, we consider a class of discrete-time systems S described by:
x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k),
y(k) = Cx(k),
(5.186)
where y(k) = col[y1(k),...,yns(k)] ∈ℜn is the overall output vector and C =
blockdiag[C1, C2, ..., Cns]. The jth subsystem Sj is described by:
xj(k + 1) = Ajxj(k) + Bjuj(k) + cj(k),
yj(k) = Cjxj(k).
(5.187)
Let the jth controller generates the signal using the observer-based scheme
xcj(k + 1) = Ajxcj(k) + Lj[yj(k) −Cjxcj(k)],
uj(k) = Kjfj(xcj(k)),
(5.188)
where Lj, Kj are the controller gain matrices and fj(xj(k)) is the controller func-
tion at time k such that the deviation from the nominal case
gj(xcj(k)) = fj(xcj(k)) −xcj(k)
is assumed to satisfy the bounding inequality
σoxt
cj(k)xcj(k) ≤gt
j(xcj(k))gj(xcj(k)) ≤σqxt
cj(k)xcj(k).
(5.189)
Deﬁne the signal ˆxj = xj −xcj, then from (5.187) and (5.188), we obtain
zj(k + 1) = Zjzj(k) + Bjgj(zj(k)) + Cj(k),

Invoking the separation principle paves the way to determine the unknown gain

the controller gain Kj by applying Theorem 5.10. During the second stage, we
proceed to determine the observer gain Lj by selecting the quadratic Lyapunov

The coupling matrices Emj ∈ℜnj×nj , m = 1,...,3 are generated randomly and

1. The elements of Emj have values in the range [0.01, 0.7) corresponding to weak

2. The elements of Emj have values in the range [0.7, 1.9) corresponding to strong

5.6 Notes and References
This chapter has fully examined the problem of designing decentralized H∞feed-
back control for a class of linear interconnected continuous-time and discrete-time
systems with quantized signals in the subsystem control channels. The system under
consideration has unknown-but-bounded couplings with adjustable local parameters
and interval time-delays. Complete design of a decentralized output-feedback con-
troller using local information (either continuous or quantized) is attained to render
the closed-loop system is delay-dependent asymptotically stable with guaranteed
γ -level.
Next, a general approach to quantized decentralized H∞feedback control of
linear continuous-time or discrete-time systems where the quantizer has arbitrary
form that satisﬁes a quadratic inequality constraint is developed and an LMI-based
method is designed at the subsystem level to render the closed-loop system delay-
dependent asymptotically stable with guaranteed γ -level.

Decentralized Quantized Control
Finally, for a class of linear interconnected discrete-time systems with quantized
signals in the subsystem control channels, the problem of designing decentralized
feedback control with overﬂow nonlinearities is treated. The system under consid-
eration has unknown-but-bounded couplings with adjustable local parameters.
There are ample of extensions to the results of this chapter. This includes, but
limited to, quantized ﬁltering and quantized dynamic output-feedback within the
decentralized framework. Indeed, dealing with nonlinear interconnected systems is
an attractive area that calls for serious work. Promising results can be derived along
the methods of Chaps. 2 and 3.

be modeled as graphs in which a set of nodes (with storing capacities) are connected
through a set of links (where trafﬁc delays and transport costs may be incurred) that
cannot be loaded above their trafﬁc capacities. Trafﬁc ﬂows may vary over time.
Then the nodes, that is, the decision makers acting at the nodes) may be requested
to modify the trafﬁc ﬂows to be sent to their neighboring nodes.
6.1 Introduction
Trafﬁc networks are engineering systems characterized by advanced technological
importance. The following are typical applications:
• computer networks extending over large geographical areas;
• store-and-forward packet switching communication networks;
• large-scale freeway systems;
• reservoir networks in multi reservoir systems;
• queuing networks in manufacturing systems.
A fundamental challenge to communication networking has been the increased
complexity to meet the explosive demand of applications, which brings about more
technical issues to be solved. By increasing the number of nodes in a network, they
may in general have fewer links to communicate to each other, directly. Therefore
the routing problem, which deals with determining a route for packets from source
nodes to destination nodes through other nodes emerges as one of the main challeng-
ing problems. This problem becomes more compounded with the presence of other
issues such as delays patterns, packet losses, and bandwidth limitations that are cru-
cial in selecting the intermediate nodes for routing. Early routing algorithms, such as
those implemented in ARPANET, were based on ﬁnding the shortest path from the

source node to the destination node [1–7]. When the network becomes crowded, link
congestion arises thereby leading to poor performance of these algorithms. This in
turn alleviates the issue of link congestion for routing decisions, that is the message
ﬂow rate on a link is related to the capacity of that link and optimal routing can be
achieved by minimizing the total delay [7, 35]. The relevance of optimal networks
for a class of mobile networks was reported in [9, 10]. In [3], a dynamic model of
the network was proposed and a centralized routing controller was developed based
on minimization of the total queuing delay. The queuing delay is a primary source
of delay in routing and is deﬁned as the total time that messages have to spend in the
queue. This delay is obtained by integration of the queue length during the routing
period. In [1], robust centralized as well as decentralized routing control strategies
were introduced for networks with a ﬁxed topology based on the minimization of
the worst-case queuing length, which is related to the queuing delays. In deriving
the queuing dynamics, the ﬂuid ﬂow conservation principle is frequently employed,
wherein each state of the subsystem (node) represents a queue corresponding to a
given destination node.
Maximizing the utility is another issue in routing. In [29], the shortest path rout-
ing algorithm for TCP/AQM networks was investigated which also maximizes the
link utility. The problem of delay-constrained routing was addressed in recent years
in [17] where a routing-based admission control mechanism considering an end-to-
end delay for IP trafﬁc ﬂows was introduced.
By increasing size of networks makes the number of different possible paths
from one node to another increase signiﬁcantly. Therefore, it is virtually impossible
to implement a centralized controller. Centralized controllers are also vulnerable to
failures in the network and introduce a large communication overhead on the net-
work. Specially, when the nodes are distributed in a large area, the communication
between each node and the centralized controller enforces a costly communication
overhead with noticeable delays. Thus, decentralized controllers which can be im-
plemented locally at individual nodes are desirable for reasons of practical imple-
mentation. In [15], other types of delays, namely transmission delay, propagation
delay, and processing delay were also considered in dynamic model of the network
ﬂow and a decentralized controller was proposed that guarantees the boundedness
of the queue length and the delays.
Extending on the results of [1, 5], the objective of this chapter is to develop
improved routing strategies based on minimization of the worst-case queuing length
which is also minimizes the congestion and packet loss [15].
Based on continuous-time version of the queuing model presented in [5], we
adopt the H∞performance criterion to form an optimal control scheme so as to
maintain the robust performance of the routing strategy in the presence of multiple
unknown time-varying delays. The resulting optimization problem is then reformu-
lated as a linear objective minimization problem involving Linear Matrix Inequality
(LMI) constraints. In the present work, both centralized and decentralized solution
strategies are developed. In the centralized case, a reﬁned LMI speciﬁcations facili-
tated the inclusion of several physical constraints imposed on the queuing model.

6.2 A Model of Communication Networks
In what follows, we consider a communication network (CN) as a directed graph
(N, L), consisting of N, a set of n nodes and L, a set of ℓoriented links. Each node re-
ceives messages from both from outside the network and the upstream nodes within
the network. Each message has a destination node d ∈N which is absorbed as soon
as it arrives at that node. Messages can arrive to a node as their ﬁnal destination.
Alternatively, arrive as transition in which case, are put into a queue to be sent out
to a downstream node. It is assumed that the network is “connected”, that is, each
node of the network must be reachable from all other nodes. When all the nodes are
source as well as destination, at each node j ∈N there will be n−1 queues in which
messages are stored for all destinations, 1,2,j −1,j + 1,...,n. Based on the ﬂuid
ﬂow conservation principle, The dynamics of CN can be expressed by the following
model:
˙qd
j (t) =

k∈Σu(j),k̸=d
f d
kj(t −τ d
kj(t)) + rd
j (t) −

k∈Σd(j)
f d
jk(t),
(6.1)
where
qd
j :
message queue length at node j destined to node d
Σu(j): set of upstream neighbors of node j
Σd(j): set of downstream neighbors of node j
f d
kj(t): input trafﬁc ﬂow routed from node k ∈Σu(j) to node j destined to node d
f d
jm(t): output trafﬁc ﬂow routed from node j to node m ∈Σd(j) destined to
node d
rd
j (t):
external input ﬂow entering node j destined to node d
τ d
kj(t):
total unknown time-varying and bounded delay in transmitting, propagat-
ing, and processing of messages (including identifying the destination, in-
serting in the queue and routing computation) with destination d routed
from node k to node j.
It must be emphasized that the delays deﬁned in (6.1) are assumed to be unknown
and time-varying and this is clearly more realistic for trafﬁc network applications.
When dealing the routing problem, some physical characteristics impose constraints
on a trafﬁc network model. A typical set of constraints can be given as
f d
jk ≥0,
(6.2)
0 ≤qd
j (t) < qd
maxj ,
(6.3)

d∈Nj
≤cjk,
j ∈N, k ∈Σd(j),
(6.4)
where Nj = N \ {j}. The ﬁrst two constraints (6.2) and (6.3 are frequently termed
non-negativity constraints based on physical reasons. Constraint (6.3) implies that

306
6
Decentralized Control of Trafﬁc Networks
the queuing length cannot exceed the buffer size qd
max. Finally, the capacity con-
straint (6.4) states that the total ﬂow in each link cannot exceed the capacity of that
link denoted by cjk.
6.3 Problem Formulation
Routing problem in CN is concerned with adjusting the output ﬂow of each queue,
f d
jk(t), according to the network trafﬁc information, such that certain objective func-
tions are minimized. To formulate the routing problem, we introduce
x(t) = col{qd
j (t)} ∈ℜn(n−1),
w(t) = col{rd
j (t)} ∈ℜn(n−1),
(6.5)
u(t) = col{f d
j (t)} ∈ℜn(n−1),
j,d = 1,2,...,n.
Since the input ﬂows for these queue are due to its upstream neighbors, they are
in turn the output ﬂows of these nodes after some delays. The time-varying delay
functions associated with these nodes are not known a priori and are different from
one another due to differences in the trafﬁc load in each link and other network
uncertainties. Deﬁne
u(t −τ(t)) = col{f d
kj(t −τ d
kj(t))} ∈ℜℓ(n−1),
(6.6)
τ(t) = col{τ d
kj(t)|},
k,j,d = 1,2,...,n.
Thus (6.1) can be rewritten compactly as
˙x(t) = Bu(t) + Du(t −τ(t)) + Γ w(t),
(6.7)
z(t) = Cx(t),
(6.8)
where z(t) is the regulated output, C is a weight matrix that can be deﬁned accord-
ing to the queues priorities, B ∈ℜn(n−1)×ℓ(n−1) and D ∈ℜn(n−1)×ℓ(n−1) represent
the network connectivity (downstream and upstream nodes, respectively). Actually,
{Bjk (Djk)} is equal to −1 (1), if the ﬂow uj is a downstream (upstream) ﬂow of
node j and is zero otherwise. Moreover, Γ = In(n−1)×n(n−1). For several techni-
cal reasons, we consider that the delay τ(t) is an unknown differentiable function
satisfying
0 ≤τ(t) ≤ϱ,
0 < ˙τ ≤μ,
∀t ≥0.
(6.9)
Inequality (6.9) ensures smooth ﬂow across the trafﬁc network.

6.3.1 A Network Example
For the purpose of illustration, we consider the network shown in Fig. 6.1 which
consists of 4 nodes. All messages are routed to one destination, namely node 4,
thereby leading to one queue at each node. In terms of
u(t) =

Remark 6.1 It should be emphasized that the time-delays are indeed a major source
of instability for the entire network. Classical control theory have failed to sufﬁ-
ciently address stability and performance issues of time-delayed systems. Compli-
cations do arise in practical situations when there is no a priori knowledge about
transmitting, propagating, and processing delays. Furthermore, the time delay func-
tions vary according to the trafﬁc ﬂow and other stimuli and disturbances in the net-
work. Based on a given trafﬁc ﬂow characteristics the amount of delay may increase
substantially, Stabilizing a time delayed system having multiple fast time-varying
delay functions is still an open area of research.
In what follows, we adopt the H∞criterion in addressing the H∞routing algo-
rithm based on state feedback controller of the form u(t) = Kx(t), that simultane-
ously guarantees stability of the network model (6.7) in presence of time-varying
delays and minimizes the worst-case queuing length due to the external inputs.

Decentralized Control of Trafﬁc Networks
Speciﬁcally, the routing problem can be cast into the following optimization prob-
lem
min
γ >0 J(w) =
	 ∞
0
(zt(s)z(s) −γ 2wt(s)w(s))ds < 0.
(6.10)
Using the objective function (6.10), the messages are routed such that the network
is simultaneously stabilized subject to unknown transmitting, propagating, and pro-
cessing delays τ(t), and the queuing length, x, is minimized subject to presence of
the external input w. Note that by minimizing the worst case queuing length one can
actually accomplish a measure of minimum queuing delay.
6.4 Centralized Routing Controller
In what follows, we seek to design a centralized H∞state feedback controller for
the network model (6.7)–(6.8) subject to the constraints (6.2)–(6.4). We adopt a
Lyapunov-based approach to establish the stability conditions of the time-delayed
closed-loop network without physical constraints and with prescribed performance
criteria. The resulting conditions will be cast into the framework of LMIs. Then we
impose the physical constraints (6.2)–(6.4) to reﬁne the LMI feasibility conditions.
6.4.1 Delay-Dependent H∞Unconstrained Control Design
Since the trafﬁc network routing model (6.7)–(6.8) represents a time-delayed sys-
tem with unknown time-varying parameters (delays), we proceed to construct an
appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) to derive delay-dependent sta-
bility and stabilization conditions. It must be noted that despite the fact that the total
delay of messages are not known in advance, nevertheless without loss of generality
the delays can be assumed to satisfy the bounding inequalities (6.9). Under the state
feedback u = Kx, the closed-loop trafﬁc model becomes
˙x(t) = BKx(t) + DKx(t −τ) + Γ w(t),
(6.11)
z(t) = Cx(t).
The following theorem establishes a basis for an H∞state feedback design in the
unconstrained case.
Theorem 6.1 Consider the trafﬁc network model (6.7)–(6.8) with the delay pat-
tern (6.9) and w ∈L2[0,∞). Given the bounds ϱ, μ, γ , there exists a central-
ized state-feedback controller of the form u = Kx, such that the closed-loop sys-
tem (6.11) is asymptotically stable with L2-gain less than γ , if there exist matrices

Π2 = Ψ1 + Ψ2,
Π3 = 2Ψ1 + (1 −μ)Ψ2.
The state feedback gain is given by K = YX−1.
The proof is provided in Sect. 6.7.
Remark 6.2 The success of the centralized routing controller hinges upon the valid-
ity that the external input ﬂows to nodes w ∈L2. In principle, one can employ an
appropriate shaping ﬁlter, decoding or interpolation techniques to ensure the satis-
faction of this condition without removing some information from the input signal.
By this way, the queuing length is guaranteed to remain in L2 thereby assuring
that the boundedness of the queuing length of the proposed routing methodology is
supported for a bounded input ﬂow w.
Remark 6.3 It must be noted that Theorem 6.1 yields delay-dependent stability con-
dition that is less-conservative and has wider operational range than the one devel-
oped in [1]. The main reason for this is the controller gain requires the feasibility of
a single strict LMI (6.12) as opposed to three non-strict LMIs in [1]. Moreover, the
number of LMI variables are fewer thereby reducing the computational burden.
6.4.2 Delay-Dependent H∞Design
In what follows, we impose the physical constraints of the network and recast the
solution of the routing problem as LMI feasibility conditions. By including the con-
straints, we proceed for determining a complete solution to the robust dynamic rout-
ing problem. For this purpose, we invoke the following result established in [13]:
Lemma 6.1 The linear time-delay system
˙x(t) = Ax(t) + Dx(t −τ(t)),
A ∈ℜn×n, D ∈ℜn×n
is non-negative if and only if the off-diagonal elements of A are non-negative and
all of the elements of D are non-negative.

(6.15)
The proof is provided in Sect. 6.7.
Next, we generalize our results to the case of large-scale trafﬁc networks.
6.5 Decentralized Trafﬁc Routing Control
An appealing methodology for dealing with large-scale systems including trafﬁc
networks is the decentralized control approach [19], whereby all the analysis and
design tasks are performed at the subsystem level. In the sequel, we appropriately
modify the robust centralized routing control strategy and develop it in the form of
a decentralized control scheme. Speciﬁcally, the trafﬁc routing problem is reformu-
lated such that each node in the network is treated as a subsystem requiring only its
own local information to route the received messages while ensuring that a global
performance index is optimized and desired speciﬁcations are satisﬁed.
In this regard, robust control of large scale time-delay systems has witnessed an
intense research activity in the past few years to develop decentralized stabilizing
controllers for constant time-delay systems. Stabilization of a class of time-varying
large-scale systems subject to time-varying delays was investigated in [20, 22, 23].
In this section the dynamic model of the trafﬁc ﬂow is modiﬁed for design and
implementation of an improved robust decentralized routing control strategy for un-
known and fast time-varying delays. The properties of the developed decentralized
robust control scheme and a brief discussion on its complexity and scalability are
also provided.
6.5.1 Decentralized Dynamic Model
As mentioned previously, in routing problem, each node of the trafﬁc network is
considered as a subsystem that includes all its queues corresponding to different
destinations. Consequently, the decentralized dynamic model of the trafﬁc ﬂow at
each node, or subsystem is given by
˙x(t) = Bjuj(t) +

m∈Σ(j)
Ddjmum(t −τjm(t)) + Γjwj(t),
(6.16)
where

6.5
Decentralized Trafﬁc Routing Control
311
• xj = col{qd
j (t)} ∈ℜn for d = 1,...,n denotes the queue length in node j for
different destinations,
• uj(t) = col{f d
jm(t)} ∈ℜℓ, denotes the ﬂows sent from node j,
• τjm(t) denotes the unknown but bounded time-varying total-delay in transmis-
sion, propagation, and processing,
• wj(t) ∈ℜn denotes the external input ﬂow for node j.
The matrices Bj, Ddjm and Γj are deﬁned for the node j similar to that in Sect. 6.5.
Assumption 6.1 The delays τjm(t) are unknown differentiable functions that for
all t ≥0 satisfy
0 ≤ϕjm ≤max{τjm(t)} ≤ϱjm,
(6.17)
max{|˙τjm(t)|} ≤μjm,
μjm > 0.
For simplicity, we consider that the delay between two nodes in both directions are
the same, that is τmj = τjm.
At each node (subsystem) the trafﬁc routing problem is to determine an H∞state
feedback controller uj = Kjxj such that the following global objective function is
minimized:
J(w) =
	 ∞
0
[zt(j)z(t) −γ 2wt(t)w(t)]ds < 0,
γ > 0,
(6.18)
where the vectors z and w are deﬁned previously.
6.5.2 Decentralized Robust Routing Controller: Unconstrained

Under the state feedback controller uj = Kjxj, the closed-loop node model be-
comes:

m∈Σ(j)

(6.19)
zj(t) = Cjxj(t)
with the delay pattern (6.17). Toward our goal, we select the following Lyapunov-

where 0 < Pj, S1jm, S21jm, Ejm, R1jm, R2jm are weighting matrices with appro-
priate dimensions. The following theorem establishes LMI-based delay-dependent
sufﬁcient stability conditions for the decentralized time-delay system (6.19) and
provides control design conditions for constructing an H∞state feedback routing
controller.

The details of the proof are given in Sect. 6.7.
Remark 6.4 It must be emphasized that Theorem 6.3 provides new results in the
context of decentralized control of large-scale systems with time-varying delays in
comparison to the available literature. In part, it builds upon the parametrization
technique developed in [24]. Considering the case aj ≡0, the results reduce to de-
centralized asymptotic stabilization which out performs the results reported in [8,
15, 22, 23].
6.5.3 Decentralized Robust Routing Controller: Constrained Case
Extending on the centralized case, we can similarly deal with the physical con-
straints imposed at each node to arrive at the constrained decentralized routing
problem. The additional LMI conditions are now derived by parallel development
to (6.38) through (6.51). The main result is summarized by the following theorem:

Remark 6.5 It must be noticed that by increasing the number of nodes in a trafﬁc
network, the number of possible paths from a given source node to a given desti-
nation will signiﬁcantly increase. It is therefore expected that a centralized routing
controller algorithm will be vulnerable to failures and introduces a huge communi-
cation overhead on the network. On the other hand, decentralized controllers that
can be constructed locally at individual nodes are highly desirable for practical pur-
poses and implementation.

Given n is the number of nodes, k is the number of destination nodes, and ℓis the
number of links, the developed routing method requires ﬁve (n−1)k ×(n−1)k and
(l −1)k × (n −1)k unknown matrices should be determined for the feasibility of
LMI conditions in (6.12). Alternatively, the developed decentralized routing method
for each node there are nine unknown matrices to be determined so as to satisfy the
LMI conditions in (6.21). Therefore, there would be a total 8(n−k) unknown matri-
ces with dimension k × k, 8k unknown matrices with dimension (k −1) × (k −1),
n −k unknown matrices with dimension mik × k, and k unknown matrices with
dimension mi(k −1) × (k −1) are required. Even though the number of the un-
known matrices in the decentralized control scheme is higher than the centralized
controller method, given that the dimensions of matrices are lower than the cen-
tralized case, the LMI technique can attain a solution to the decentralized scheme
much faster and more efﬁciently. Moreover, the implementation of our decentral-
ized controller is computationally less expensive when compared to our centralized
method. In effect, for non crowded networks, the centralized method is more desir-
able due to their optimality (vis-à-vis use of the full information set) and accuracy.
However, by increasing the number of nodes in the network it becomes difﬁcult and
sometimes even impossible (due to ill-conditioning and curse of dimensionality)
to design and implement the centralized controller. Consequently, the decentralized
method is more suitable and appropriate for these large-scale trafﬁc networks.
6.6 Simulation Results
To evaluate the performance of our proposed trafﬁc network routing control strate-
gies, simulations are conducted in this section on two examples, The results obtained
by applying our proposed decentralized routing strategy is compared with that of the
centralized scheme as well as another conventional optimal control scheme, namely
Model Predictive Control (MPC) method. All simulations are done on a MATLAB
Simulink 7.0 platform.
6.6.1 Simulation Example 6.1
Consider the network shown in Fig. 6.2. The capacity of each link is also indicated
in the ﬁgure, the unit of which is kbit/sec. All the nodes are assumed to be sources as
well as destinations. From Fig. 6.2 it follows that there are 6 queues (the states of the
system) and 8 output ﬂows for these queues (the input signals). The initial values of
all the states are set to 0. The external input is considered to be the following pulse
function:
w(t) =

1 kbit/sec,
0 < t < 50,
0,
otherwise
and the delay is assumed to be 5 sec for each input ﬂow.

The results obtained by using our proposed decentralized and centralized H∞
controllers for the queue lengths are shown in Fig. 6.3 (where xd
i denotes the queue
length of node i destined to node d) and for the ﬂow links in Fig. 6.4, respectively.
These ﬁgures clearly demonstrate the smooth behavior of the H∞controller, where
no a priori knowledge about the delays, except their upper bound, was assumed. It
can be stated that overall the decentralized control performance is comparable with
that of the centralized method, However, since there are only few (3) nodes in the
network, the difference is not quite signiﬁcant.
We are also interested in investigating the effects of jitter on the performance of
our proposed centralized and decentralized routing strategies. Therefore, the follow-

show their corresponding ﬂow link, for the centralized and decentralized methods,
respectively. By considering the results obtained in Fig. 6.5, it can be concluded that
the effects of the jitter do not deteriorate the stability of our routing strategies and
the additional disturbances are attenuated after a short transient time.

6.6.2 Simulation Example 6.2
Consider the network that is shown in Fig. 6.6 which is adopted from [18]. The
capacity of each link, with unit of k bit/sec, is also depicted in the ﬁgure. The desti-
nation nodes are 7 and 10 and overall there are 17 queues (the states of the system)
and 35 output ﬂows for these queues (the input signals). The initial values of all the
states are set to 0. The external input is considered as a poison distribution with the
ﬂow rate λ for 70 sec. For each input ﬂow the delay is taken as a fast time-varying
function 3 + 5|sin(100t)| sec which is considered to be unknown to the controllers.
Each simulation is run for 100 sec. For λ = 0.2, the results obtained by using
our proposed decentralized and centralized H∞controllers for the queue lengths
of nodes 1–3 are shown in Fig. 6.7. As can be seen from this ﬁgure our proposed

control schemes satisfy the physical constraints and the closed-loop system behaves
robustly in presence of fast time-varying delays. Similar results are also obtained
for nodes 4–9, but these results are omitted due to space limitations. Note that the
time derivative upper bound of the delay is taken as d = 200 and the upper bound
of the delay is h = 8. Table 6.1 shows the resulting queuing delays for different in-
put ﬂow rates. It should be noted that our proposed routing algorithms can provide
acceptable performance for higher values of the transmission, propagation and pro-
cessing delays. By invoking the stability results obtained in Theorems 4.1 and 5.1,
the maximum delay upper bound for which the routing controller can maintain its
acceptable performance is found to be h = 10 for the decentralized controller, and
is found to be h = 8 for the centralized controller.
When the network trafﬁc is heavy, congestion occurs and packets are dropped in
the network, which can cause a decrease in the throughput performance. Figure 6.8
depicts the performance of our proposed algorithms under different trafﬁc loads.
Indeed, by increasing λ to 0.3 the decentralized method loses 3% of its packets
while for λ = 0.4 this loss increased to 11%.
Generally, it can be concluded that the decentralized control strategy could fairly
compete with the performance of the centralized method. However, as the number
of nodes increases, one may not be able to easily solve the corresponding high di-
mensional LMI conditions associated with the centralized control strategy due to
ill-conditioning and/or reductions in the size of the feasibility regions. On the other

hand, the decentralized strategy is scalable and would provide an acceptable perfor-
mance even in crowded networks.

turn guarantees the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system (6.11). Thus, we
conclude that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable with L2-gain less than
γ and this completes the proof.

6.7.2 Proof of Theorem 6.2
Proof Considering the capacity constraint (6.4), it can be readily expressed in view
of (6.5) as
Gku < ck,
k = 1,2,...,ℓ
(6.38)
which depends on the control input u for some weighting matrix Gk. By considering
the following ellipsoid for a selected ω > 0
Ξ = {x(t)|xt(t)X−1x(t) ≤ω, X = Xt > 0}.
(6.39)
When the LMI (6.21) is feasible, it follows from V (t) of (6.29) that
xt(t)X−1xj(t) ≤V (t).
By integrating J in (6.30) over the period 0 →t with V (0) = 0 subject to Theo-
rem 6.1, it is not difﬁcult to show that J < 0 corresponds to
V (t) ≤−

wt(t)w(t)dt := γ W,
(6.40)
where W is the upper bound energy of the external input w(t). This shows that x(t)
belongs to an invariant set Ξ for all t > 0, if
γ W < ω.
(6.41)
By using the controller gain K = YX−1, we write the state-feedback controller
u = YX−1x, which leads to express (6.38) as
GkYX−1x < ck.
(6.42)
Equivalently
xt(GkYX−1)t(GkYX−1)x < c2
k.
(6.43)
Combining (6.39) and (6.43), we have
(GkYX−1)t(ω/c2
k)(GkYX−1) < X−1.
(6.44)
By applying the Schur complement, the capacity constraints can be cast into the
following LMI conditions
I1 := γ < ω/W,
(6.45)
I2k :=

Following parallel development, the constraint on the queue buffer size in (6.3) can
be written as
Qdjx < xmaxdj ,
(6.47)
where xmaxdj = qd
maxj . Using (6.39) and (6.47), we have
Qt
dj(ω/x2
maxdj )Qdj < X−1
(6.48)
which is equivalent by the Schur complements to the LMI
I3 :=

(6.49)
It remains to look at the non-negativity constraint (6.2). Applying Lemma 6.1 to
the closed-loop system (6.11) requires that the off-diagonal entries of BK and all
entries of DK to be non-negative. For simplicity in exposition, we take 0 < X in
Theorem 6.1 to be diagonal. Considering K = YX−1, this requirement is translated
to
I4 := (BY)jm ≥0,
j ̸= m,
(6.50)
I5 := (DY)jm ≥0,
j,m = 1,...,n.
Observe that meeting the non-negativity condition x ≥0 implies that the second
non-negativity condition u ≥0 can be easily satisﬁed by imposing Kjm > 0. Conse-
quently, by using K = YX−1 with 0 < X being diagonal matrix, the constraint (6.2)
is satisﬁed if the following LMI condition holds
I6 := Yjm > 0,
j,m = 1,...,ℓ(n −1).
(6.51)
The result of Theorem 6.1 in light of inequalities (6.45), (6.46) and (6.49)–(6.51)
leads to the desired result.

Decentralized Control of Trafﬁc Networks
6.8 Discrete-Time Dynamic Routing
In this section, we direct attention to the presentation of decentralized controller
for dynamic routing in multi-destination large-scale data communication networks
using discrete-time format. Although this section is the discrete counterpart of the
previous one, the analysis and topics are treated in a distinct way.
An important problem in the operation of data communication networks is the
routing of messages. Typically, a data communication network consists of many
nodes which are connected through a number of links. The routing problem is to
direct messages from one node to another, through such links. until they reach their
desired destination.
Generally speaking, the amount of messages entering a network at various nodes
may vary from time to time, a dynamic routing strategy, which can adopt to such
variations, is required. In addition, it is often the case that the number of nodes in a
network is large; in this case the vast number of different possible paths from one
node to another, makes it virtually impossible to implement a centralized controller.
As we noted before, centralized controllers are vulnerable to failures in the network
and introduce a large communication overhead on the network. Decentralized con-
trollers, which can be implemented locally at individual nodes, and which require a
minimum amount of information from the other nodes, are desirable to implement
in practice.
Early routing algorithms, such as those implemented in the ARPANET [25] and
TYMNET [34], were based on ﬁnding the shortest path from the initial node to the
destination node [7, 16]. In these algorithms, the length of a path is usually taken
to be proportional to the message ﬂow rate on that path. Most of these algorithms
could be implemented in a decentralized way in the sense that the computations can
be done locally; however, for dynamic routing, they require excessive information
transfer inside the network (all the nodes must be informed about the changing link
lengths). Other algorithms have been proposed to improve the network performance
by minimizing a cost function related to the link congestion (message ﬂow rate on a
link relative to the capacity of that link) [11, 26, 35]. For dynamic routing, however,
these algorithms also require excessive information exchange.
6.8.1 Routing Algorithms
A routing algorithm which uses distributed computation has been introduced in [12];
this algorithm considers an optimal routing problem to minimize a generic measure
of link ﬂows (that is, a more general deﬁnition of link congestion which is also
related to the total delay, is minimized) and produces a solution which converges
to the optimal solution under certain assumptions. Various computational and prac-
tical aspects of similar algorithms have also been extensively discussed [6]. A key
assumption of these algorithms is the so-called quasi-static assumption which states
that the external trafﬁc arrival rates for each origin-destination pair is stationary over

6.8
Discrete-Time Dynamic Routing
329
time. Therefore, although these algorithms may be successful when the external traf-
ﬁc arrival rates remain approximately constant over time, they may fail to produce
satisfactory results when the rates change appreciably within a relatively short time.
Furthermore, in general,this class of algorithms (i.e. the shortest path algorithms
and the algorithms based on link congestion minimization) are suitable only when
the total trafﬁc arrival rate into a network is small compared to its total capacity;
i.e. such algorithms usually require separate ﬂow control algorithms to deal with
situations where congestion occur [33].
The problem of determining a routing controller which minimizes a measure of
the total queue length of the network was studied by [27]; it may be argued that
such a measure reﬂects the overall performance better than a measure based on link
congestion. Furthermore, algorithms based on minimizing such measures can also
work well under congestion. A conceptual algorithm is presented in [27] to com-
pute the optimal control for minimizing a measure of the queue length of a network;
however, it was stated that the implementation of such an algorithm may not be
possible to achieve in the most general case due to the computational complexity
required and a number of other problems. A number of decentralized routing al-
gorithms based on minimizing a measure of the queue length were reported by a
number of researchers for certain special cases. In [30] a decentralized routing al-
gorithm is presented based on minimizing a measure of the queue length and the
total travel time (transportation networks rather than communication networks were
considered). The algorithm, however, is valid only for single destination networks.
Multi-destination networks were considered within the same context by [30]; how-
ever, in this case it was assumed that the total ﬂow rate entering a node is constant.
A decentralized controller for the general case was proposed by [4, 14]; the structure
of this controller was motivated by the structure of an optimal controller which min-
imizes a measure of the total queue length. Although this controller may not produce
optimal performance in general. it is easy to design and simple to implement.
A different approach for designing a routing controller was later undertaken
in [14]; an off-line optimization approach was proposed to determine a decentral-
ized controller for a network whose dynamics can be modeled as a continuous-time
system. In the present book, this approach is extended to the discrete-time case. This
case is important from a practical point of view, since the implementation of rout-
ing control strategies is done generally in discrete-time. The dynamic model used
in this book (which is a discrete-time version of the model developed by [14, 15])
can incorporate processing delays. The basic aim of the introduced approach is to
maximize the magnitude of each external message arrival rate which may occur in
the system, without violating any constraints on the system. It is shown that this
problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem, and can be solved
off-line. The proposed controller is decentralized in the sense that all the on-line
computations are done locally at the nodes without any information transfer from
the other nodes. This controller guarantees stability and clears the queues of the
network in the absence of external message arrivals. It also keeps the queue lengths
bounded in the presence of external message arrival rates, which do not exceed
a certain maximum rate. The controller also avoids looping of messages. Further-

more, it can cope with congestion, that is, no separate ﬂow control algorithms are
needed.
6.8.2 Network Dynamics and Assumptions
Consider a data communication network consisting of N nodes. The nodes are con-
nected through directed links on which messages can be transmitted. Each node
receives messages from both upstream nodes inside the network and from outside
the network. The node on which a message enters the network is said to be the
source node of this message. Each message also has another node, called the desti-
nation node, associated with it. Messages are absorbed as soon as they arrive at their
destination. Messages arriving at a node other than their destination are put into a
queue (or buffer) and eventually are sent out to a down-stream node.
Assumption 6.2 For simplicity in exposition, it is assumed that
1. The rate of messages being sent out from one node to another (the control sig-
nals) are updated at discrete periodic instants, which is the usual case in practice.
Without loss of generality this period is taken to be unity.
2. A processing delay occurs at each node before an arriving message can be put
into a queue and then sent out. Such a delay necessarily occurs in practical sys-
tems. This delay is the total time needed for tasks such as receiving a message
from an upstream node or from outside the network, identifying its destination,
placing it into the appropriate queue, and performing necessary calculations for
routing. Some of these tasks may eventually be handled in parallel. Note that
each type of message, associated with a particular origin-destination pair at the
node. may have a different processing delay.
3. For technical ease, initially the processing delay times are considered ﬁxed; how-
ever, it will be later shown that the main results remain valid even if these delay
times are time-varying, but bounded. It is to be noted that the delay due to wait-
ing at the input to a transmission link (that is, the queuing delay) is separately
considered in the model. In the following formulation, the processing delay for a
particular message is the time it spends in the pℓk
i
queue, and the queuing delay
is the time it spends in the mlki queue.
4. The propagation delay along a link (that is, the transport time of a signal on
any link) may be included in the processing delay of the node at the receiving
end. The transmission delay (that is, the time between starting and ending the
transmission of an individual message), on the other hand, is taken care of in two
different ways in our model. If the message can be sent out from the present node
immediately after it is processed, then this delay is included in the processing
delay of the transmitting node. If, on the other hand, the message (or at least
a part of it) has to wait in the mℓkj queue (possibly due to congestion in the
out-going links) then at least a part of the transmission delay is included in the
queuing delay. The transmission delay is, of course, dependent on the message
length; but it is bounded as long as the message lengths are bounded.

5. The control signals are updated synchronously throughout the network.
In view of the forgoing assumptions, the queue dynamics at node j for messages
with source ℓand destination k can be described as follows:

j (t) is the volume of processed messages with source i and destination k,
waiting at node j at time t, j ∈¯Nk, ℓ∈¯Nk, where ¯N ≤{1,2,...,N}, ¯Nk ≤
¯N\{k} (the queuing delay is the time a message spends in this queue).
• qℓk
j (t) ≤pℓk
j (t) + mℓk

tination k, either being processed or waiting at node j at time t, j ∈¯Nk, ℓ∈¯Nk,

• f k
j (t) is the arrival rate of messages with destination k, entering the network at
node i at time t, j ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N.
• uℓk
jm(t) is the ﬂow rate of messages with source ℓand destination k, sent out from
node j to the downstream node m along the link i to j at time t, j ∈D(i), i ∈¯Nk,
l ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N.
• rℓk
j
is the processing delay at node j for messages with source ℓand destination
k, j ∈¯Nk, ℓ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N.
• V(j) and D(j) are respectively the sets of adjacent upstream and downstream
nodes of node j, j ∈¯N; that is,
Vj := {m | there exists a link from m to j},
Dj := {m | there exists a link from j to m}
and

if j = l,
0
if i ̸= l.
Instead of either (6.68) or (6.69), we could also use:

• pℓk
j (t) is the volume of messages with source ℓand destination k, being processed
at node j at time t, j ∈¯Nk, ℓ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N (the processing delay is the time a
message spends in this queue).
In the sequel, we let q ≤{qℓk
j } be the N(Nℓ)2 dimensional vector of total vol-
ume of messages, m ≤{mℓk
j } be the N(N −ℓ)2 dimensional vector of volume of
processed messages, p ≤{pℓk
j } be the N(Nℓ)2 dimensional vector of volume of
messages presently being processed, where m,p, and q have the same index struc-
ture. Let f ≤{f k
j } be the N(Nℓ) dimensional vector of external message arrival
rates, u ≤{uℓk
jm} be the L(Nℓ)2 dimensional vector of message ﬂow rates along the
links, where L is the total number of links of the network, and let
˜f (t) ≤{ ˜f ℓk
j } ≤Ff (t) + Gju(t)
(6.71)
be an N(N −ℓ)2 dimensional vector which has the same index structure as q, where
F is a matrix consisting of a 1 corresponding to ˜f ℓk
j
on the column corresponding
to f k
j (j ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N), and 0’s elsewhere, and Gj, is a matrix consisting of 1’s
corresponding to uℓk
mj’s with m ∈U(j) on the row corresponding to ˜f ℓk
j
(j ∈¯Nk,
l ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N), and 0’s elsewhere. Then model (6.68)–(6.70) can be compactly
written as:

m(t + 1) = m(t) +

(6.74)
where Go is a matrix consisting of 1’s corresponding to uℓk

the row corresponding to mℓk

(j ∈¯Nk, ℓ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N), and 0’s elsewhere, G ≤

matrices containing a l at the diagonal position corresponding to mℓk
j if rℓk
j = r and
containing a 0 otherwise (j ∈¯Nk, ℓ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N).
The objective of the routing control is to determine a suitable controller for u
(that is to control the ﬂow rates along the links) to regulate the queue lengths q and
m in the presence of f . To reﬂect practical issues, certain routing control constraints
must be recalled:
1. The message arrival rates into the network must be non-negative:
f k
j (t) ≥0,
∀t ≥t0, ∀k ∈¯N.
2. The queue length of messages being processed at a node cannot be negative:
pℓk
j (t) ≥0,
∀t ≥t0, ∀j ∈¯Nk, ∀ℓ∈¯Nk, ∀k ∈¯N.

6.8
Discrete-Time Dynamic Routing
333
3. The queue length of processed messages cannot be negative:
mℓk
j (t) ≥0,
∀t ≥t0, ∀j ∈¯Nk, ∀ℓ∈¯Nk, ∀k ∈¯N.
4. The message ﬂow rates cannot be negative:
uℓk
jm(t) ≥0
∀m ∈D(j), ∀t ≥t0, ∀j ∈¯Nk, ∀ℓ∈¯Nk, ∀k ∈¯N.
5. The total message ﬂow rate along a link cannot exceed the capacity cjm > 0 of
that link:

k∈¯N

ℓ∈¯Nk
uℓk
jm(t) ≤cjm,
∀t ≥t0, ∀m ∈D(j), ∀i ∈¯N,
where t0 denotes the initial time.
Remark 6.6 It is interesting to note that forgoing constraint 1 is satisﬁed naturally
since no one can insert a negative amount of message volume into the network. Con-
straint 2 is also automatically satisﬁed as long as constraints 1 and 4 are satisﬁed,
since
pℓk
j (t) =
t−1

τ=t−rℓk
j
˜f ℓk
j (τ).
(6.75)
Note that constraints 2 and 3 imply qℓk
j ≥0, ∀t > t0, ∀j ∈¯Nk, ∀ℓ∈¯Nk, ∀k ∈¯N.
A control strategy must therefore be chosen such that constraints 3–5 are satisﬁed
at all times.
Remark 6.7 It must be noted that, in a practical situation, there may also be con-
straints imposed on the volume of messages that can be processed or buffered, that
is, upper constraints on pℓk
j
and mℓk
j . We assume that such limits are sufﬁciently
high so that such constraints are not violated. This assumption is justiﬁed, since
in view of the available computing power, storage restrictions, that is, constraints
on pℓk
j
and mℓk
j
in our case are usually less important than transmission capacity
constraints, that is, constraints on uℓk
jm in our case.
By dropping out that processing delays, the queue dynamics can be described as:
q(t + 1) = q(t) + Ff (t) + Gu(t),
(6.76)
m(t) = q(t),
(6.77)
p(t) = 0.
(6.78)
Deﬁnition 6.1 A network with N nodes is said to be connected if ∀k ∈¯N and
∀ℓ∈¯Nk, there exists a set {j1,j2,...,jm} ⊂¯Nk such that j1 = 1, j2 ∈D(j1), j3 ∈
D(j2), ..., jm ∈D(jm).

Decentralized Control of Trafﬁc Networks
6.8.3 Routing Control Algorithm
First we consider a decentralized controller of the form:
u(t) = ˆu(t),
t ≥t0,
(6.79)
where
ˆu(t) = Θ

m(t) +
rmax

r=1
Dr ˜f (t −r)

,
t ≥t0
(6.80)
and Θ is an L(N −1)2 × N(N −1)2 dimensional matrix which has the following
properties:
1. All elements of Θ are non-negative;
2. GoΘ = I where I denotes the identity matrix;
3. For any N(N −ℓ)2 × N(Nℓ)2 dimensional diagonal matrix ˆD, all eigenvalues
of GjΘ ˆD are contained in the interior of the disk centered at the origin with a
radius equal to the maximum singular value of ˆD;
4. Θ is a decentralized feedback matrix in the sense that u = Θq implies uℓk
jm =
hℓk
jmqℓk
j
(where hℓk
jm ≥0 indicates the appropriate element of Θ) ∀m ∈D(j),
∀j ∈¯Nk, ∀ℓ∈¯Nk, ∀k ∈¯N.
Remark 6.8 We observe that property 1 is needed to ensure that the calculated link
ﬂows are non-negative. Property 2 is required to ensure that all the messages re-
ceived at a node (except those whose destination is the present node) are eventually
sent to at down-stream node and that the calculated downstream link ﬂows are not
larger than the volume of the processed messages present at that node. Property 3
is a sufﬁcient condition to guarantee system stability; and property 4 is required to
achieve decentralization.
Necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the existence of a matrix Θ satisfying the
above properties are given by the following lemma:
Lemma 6.2 Consider a network described by (6.72)–(6.74); then there exists a
matrix Θ satisfying properties 1–4 if and only if the network is connected.
Proof To prove the if part, we will construct a speciﬁc Θ and show that it satisﬁes
properties 1–4. Assuming that the network is connected and deﬁne a non-cyclic path
j = j0, j1, j2, ..., jm = k
(6.81)
from each node j to each other node k in the network. These paths are deﬁned such
that there exists a link with positive capacity from each node jm to the next node

6.8
Discrete-Time Dynamic Routing
335
jm+1 on the path, and such that if the path from j to k is deﬁned as above, then the
path from jm to k for any jm on the above path is
jm, jm+1, jm+2, ..., jmm = k.
Introduce
hℓk
jm ≤

⎪⎩
1
if m is the ﬁrst node on the path from j to k,
∀m ∈D(j), ∀j ∈¯Nk, ∀ℓ∈¯Nk, ∀k ∈¯N,

otherwise
and let hℓk
jm be the element of Θ which relates qℓk
j
to uℓk
jm in the equation u = Θq
(m ∈D(j), j ∈¯Nk, ℓ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N); let all other elements of Θ be zero.
Clearly Θ satisﬁes the foregoing properties 1 and 4. To show that Θ satisﬁes
property 2, consider the relation ˆq = Gou, where ˆq has the same index structure as
q, and let u = Θq. Then, for each j ∈¯Nk, ℓ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N, we obtain:
ˆqℓk
j =

m∈D(j)
ulk
jm =

m∈D(j)
hℓk
jmqlk
j = qℓk
j
since for each triple (j,ℓ,k), there exists exactly m ∈D(j) such that hℓk
jm = 1 and
hℓk
jm = 0 for all other m ∈D(j). The above relation therefore implies that GoΘ = I.
Next to show that Θ satisﬁes property 3, consider the equations ˆq = Gju,
u = Θ ¯q, ¯q = ˆDq, where ˆD is a diagonal matrix and ˆq and ¯q have the same index
structure as q. Then, for each j ∈¯Nk, ℓ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N, we obtain:
¯qℓk
j =

m∈V(j)
uℓk
mj = V(j)hℓk
mjdℓk
m qℓk
m ,
where dℓk
j
the diagonal element of ˆD corresponding to qℓk
i
in ¯q = ˆDq (j ∈¯Nk,ℓ∈
¯Nk,k ∈¯N). Observe that j /∈U(i); it follows from the above equation that GjΘ ˆD
consists of 0’s on the diagonal. Furthermore, if the following condition (called con-
dition A): k ∈D(j) and hℓk
jk = 1, for some (j,ℓ,k) holds, then all non-diagonal el-
ements on the column of GjΘ ˆD which corresponds to qℓk
j
are zero; if condition A
does not hold, there exists exactly one m ∈D(j), (m ̸= k) for which hℓk
jm = 1, and
in this case the sum of the absolute values of the non-diagonal elements on the col-
umn of GjΘ ˆD which corresponds to qℓk
j is equal to |dℓk
j | (j ∈¯Nk,ℓ∈¯Nk,k ∈¯N).
Therefore, by Gershgorin’s theorem, the eigenvalues of GjΘ ˆD are contained in a
closed disk of radius equal to the maximum singular value of ˆD, centered at the
origin on the complex plane. To complete the proof, it needs to show that the eigen-
values of GjΘ ˆD cannot be on the boundary of this disk. We do this by contradiction.
Without loss of generality assume that the maximum singular value of ˆD is one, and
that GjΘ ˆD has an eigenvalue at exp(jθ) for some θ ∈[0,2π), where j =
√
−1.

Then this implies that there must exist scalars alk
i (i ∈¯Nk,ℓ∈¯Nk,k ∈¯N) at least
one being non-zero, such that

k∈¯N

ℓ∈¯Nk

j∈¯Nk
aℓk
j βℓk
j = 0,
where βℓk
j denotes the row of exp(mθ)I−GjΘ ˆD which corresponds to ˆqℓk
j (j ∈¯Nk,
ℓ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N). Note that βℓk
j
contains exp(mθ) at the position corresponding to
qℓk
j . If k ∈D(j) and hℓk
jm = 1, then all the other rows contain a zero at the same
position and hence we must have aℓk
j = 0. If k /∈D(j) or hℓk
jk = 0, then there exists
a path
j = j0, j1, j2, ..., jm−1, jm = k
from j to k, as constructed in (6.80), such that βℓk
jm+1 contains dℓk
j
at the position
corresponding to qℓk
jm; at this position βℓk
jm contains exp(mθ), and all other βℓk
j ’s
contain a zero at this same position, which gives
aℓk
jm = aℓk
jm+1dℓk
j exp(−mθ).
Since, by the above argument, aℓk
jm−1 = 0, by extending the above procedure, we
conclude that
aℓk
j ≤aℓk
j0 = aℓk
j1 = aℓk
j2 = ··· = aℓk
jm−1 = 0.
On repeating the above argument for all j,ℓ,k, we conclude that aℓk
j = 0,∀j ∈
¯Nk,∀ℓ∈¯Nk,∀k ∈¯N, which is a contradiction. Hence, the eigenvalues of GjΘ ˆD
are contained in the interior of the above considered disk, which completes the
proof.
To prove the only if part, we will show that if the given network is not connected
then it is not possible to satisfy both properties 2 and 3 at the same time. If the given
network is not connected, then there exists at least one pair (s,r) for which there
exists no path from s to r. Let ˆq = {ˆqlk
i } be such that
ˆqlk
i =

1
if ℓ= s and k = r and s ∼j,
0
otherwise,
where s ∼j means that either j = s or there exists a path from r to j or from j to s.
Note that ˆqsr
s = 1 and hence ˆq ̸= 0. On noting that the equation u = Gtq gives
ˆuℓk
jm =

qℓk
m −qℓk
j
if m ̸= k,
−qℓk
j
if m = k
it is seen that Gtq = 0. Therefore, rank(G) < N(Nℓ)2, which means that I + GΘ
must have at least one eigenvalue at one for any Θ. Assuming that Θ satisﬁes prop-
erty 2, this implies that GjΘ must have at least one eigenvalue at one, which implies

6.8
Discrete-Time Dynamic Routing
337
that property 3 is not satisﬁed for ˆD = I. Therefore, if the given network is not con-
nected, there can exist no Θ which will satisfy properties 2 and 3 which concludes
the proof.
□
Remark 6.9 It is important to note that the quantity inside the square brackets
in (7) is the vector of total message volume which can be sent out at time t; i.e.
the messages are sent out as they become available. Therefore, a knowledge of
the processing delays rlk
i
is not needed for the actual implementation of the con-
troller. Furthermore, since the only information required to compute the control
ulk
ij (j ∈D,l ∈¯N,k ∈¯Ni) is related to the queue lengths at node i (i ∈¯N), the
controller can be implemented in a decentralized way at each node, that is, no infor-
mation transfer between the nodes is needed and the calculations can be carried out
at individual nodes.
In order to calculate the controls and to direct messages accordingly, the con-
troller at a particular node needs to know the destination and the source of each
message that is present at that node. Therefore, as a message enters the network,
two marks, one indicating its source and the other indicating its destination, must be
added to this message.
Deﬁnition 6.2 Given a connected network with N nodes described by (6.72)–(6.74),

wr(t) = ˜f (t −r),
r = 1,2,...,rmax,
x =

where N∗≤(rmax + 1)N(N −1)2, and assume that f (t) = 0 for all t ≥t0, and that
a feedback controller (possibly nonlinear, time-varying) is applied. Then the closed
loop system is said to be globally asymptotically stable if for all t0 ∈Z and for all
x(t0) ∈ℜN∗
+ ,
lim
t→∞x(t) = 0,
where Z denotes the set of integers and ℜn
+ denotes the set of n-dimensional real
vectors with non-negative entries.
The following two theorems present some important properties of the con-
troller (6.79). The ﬁrst result shows that routing control constraints (b), (c), and (d)
are always satisﬁed for any external message arrival rates into the network, and that
the queue length m of the processed messages is driven immediately to zero using
controller (6.79).
Theorem 6.5 Consider a connected network with N nodes described by (6.72)–
(6.74). Assume that the controller described by (6.79) is applied where the matrix Θ

Proof To prove this theorem, we will use the system (6.72)–(6.74), the controller
(6.79) and (6.80) and the properties 1–4 of the controller. Substituting (6.79) and
(6.80) into (6.72) and using property 2, gives m(t + l) = 0, which implies that
m(t) = 0, ∀t ≥t0 + 1. Hence, given m(t0) ≥0, this implies that (i) holds.

Therefore, since Θ satisﬁes (P1) and x(t0) ∈ℜN∗

w1(t0 + 1) = ˜f (t0) ∈ℜN(N−1)2

. On noting now that
wr(t + 1) = wr−1(t),
r = 2,3,...,rmax,
it follows that x(t0 + l) ∈ℜN∗

holds.
Given that ˜f (t0 −r) = wr(t0) ∈ℜN(N−1)2
+
(r = 1,2,...,rmax, f (t) ∈ℜN(N−1)

∀t ≥t0), and that (iii) holds, (ii) now directly follows from property 4.
□
The following result shows that the system (6.72)–(6.74) controlled by controller
(6.79) is stable, that the queue length m of messages is immediately driven to zero,
and that the queue lengths p and q asymptotically become equal to a constant for
the case when the external message arrival rates are constant.

where R is a diagonal matrix containing rlk

Proof To prove part (a), we will show that the eigenvalues of the (linear time in-
variant) closed-loop system (6.72) and (6.74) under the controller (6.79) and (6.80)
are contained in the interior of the unit disk. The closed-loop system under the con-
troller (6.79) and (6.80) is described as
x(t + 1) = Fx(t) + Gf (t),
where

where

then, by (P3), the eigenvalues of BiΘ ˆDλ are contained in the interior of the disk
with a radius |λ|rmax−1. However, since |λ|rmax ≥|λ|rmax−1 for |λ| ≥1 this comes in
contradiction to the foregoing analysis. It is therefore concluded that the eigenvalues
of F are contained in the interior of the unit disk, which proves global asymptotic
stability.
To prove part (b), we will use part (i) if Theorem 6.5 above, and the system
dynamics and the controller. Recall that from the proof of Theorem 6.5 that
m(t) = 0
∀t ≥t0 + 1,
from which the desired result for m(∞) also follows.
Since the closed-loop system is globally asymptotically stable and f (t) is con-
stant,
wrmax(∞) = wrmax−1(∞) = ··· = w2(∞) = w1(∞)

Hence,

where the invertibility of BΘ = BiΘ −I is guaranteed by property 3. Therefore, we

□
To summarize, the controller given by (6.79) guarantees the non-negativity con-
straints (routing control constraints (b)–(d)), and stabilizes the network dynamics
assuming that the link capacity constraints (routing control constraint (e)) are not
violated. In particular, it drives the queue length m of the processed messages im-
mediately to zero. It will not guarantee, in general, that the routing control constraint
(e) is satisﬁed. In order to satisfy this constraint, we modify the controller as follows:
u(t) = ˜Γ (t)ˆu(t),
t ≥t0,
(6.84)
where ˆu(t) is deﬁned as in (6.80), and ˜Γ (t) is a diagonal matrix with the diagonal
entry

corresponding to ulk
ij (j ∈D(i), i ∈¯Nk, l ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N).
Remark 6.10 It is important to stress that controller (6.84) will guarantee both the
link capacity and the non-negativity constraints hold. Furthermore, a knowledge
of processing delays rlk
i
will not be needed for the actual implementation of the
controller. In addition, the controller (6.84) can be implemented in a decentralized
way at each node, and it will be shown in the sequel, that it will also recover the
steady-state properties achieved by the previous controller (6.79), if the external
message arrival rates are sufﬁciently small. The maximum magnitude of the external
message arrival rates for which the steady-state properties of controller (6.79) can
generally be recovered.
6.8.4 Selection of the Feedback Matrix
In what follows, we consider the problem of choosing an appropriate feedback ma-
trix Θ for controller (6.84), so that it can recover the steady-state properties of con-
troller (6.79), for as large as possible external message arrival rates. To achieve this.
let us consider the condensed system corresponding to
z(t + 1) = z(t) + f (t) + ˆBv(t),
(6.85)
where f is deﬁned in the paragraph following equation (6.68), z = {zk
i } is the
N(N −l) dimensional vector of condensed system states which has the same in-
dex structure as f , v = {vk
ij} is the L(N −l) dimensional condensed control input
vector, ˆB is a matrix consisting of 1’s corresponding to vk
ji elements with j ∈U(i),
−1’s corresponding to vk
ij elements with j ∈D(i) on the row corresponding to zk
i
(i ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N), and zeros elsewhere. Also consider the following constraints

k∈¯Ni
vk
ij ≤cij,
∀j ∈D(i), ∀i ∈¯N
which can be written compactly as
Mv ≤c,
where c ≤{cij} is the L dimensional vector of link capacities and M is an L ×
L(N −1) dimensional matrix consisting of 1’s corresponding to the vk
ij elements
on the row corresponding to cij (j ∈D(i), i ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N), and zeros elsewhere.
Here, and in the sequel, ‘≤’ (respectively ‘≥’) means that each component of the
vector on the left is less than or equal to (respectively greater than or equal to) the
corresponding component of the vector on the right.
A search for an L(N −l) × N(N −l) dimensional matrix H is needed, such that
the steady-state ﬂow
¯v = H ˆf
(6.86)

342
6
Decentralized Control of Trafﬁc Networks
will satisfy the non-negativity and link-capacity constraints, and such that the mag-
nitude of the external message arrival rate is maximized for any
ˆf ∈{ ˆfik| ˆfik = (0,...,0, ˜f k
i ,0,...,0)t, i ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N}.
(6.87)
Observe that, in case of multiple solutions to the above problem, we select one of
the solutions which minimizes the total rate of link ﬂows inside the network.
This problem can be stated in two stages as follows.
(a) Initial stage: Find ¯vik ∈ℜL(N−1)
+
to maximize ˜f k
i > 0 subject to:
ˆfik + ˆB¯vik = 0
(6.88)
and
M¯vik ≤c
(6.89)
for i ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N.
(b) Final stage: If multiple solutions exists to the primary stage, choose the solution
which minimizes ∥¯vik∥1, where ∥(·)∥1 denotes the one-norm of (·), deﬁned as
the sum of the absolute values of all the elements of (·).
Then the column of H which corresponds to ˜f k
i in (6.86) is given by:
1
( ˜f k
i )max
¯vik,
where ( ˜f k
i )max is the maximum value of ˜f k
i .
Remark 6.11 Note that the above optimization problem must be repeated for all
origin-destination pairs i–k. The primary stage effectively minimizes a global cost
function by maximizing the magnitude of maximum possible external trafﬁc arrival
rates. In the ease of multiple solutions to the primary stage, the secondary stage,
on the other hand, minimizes a user cost function by routing messages through a
minimum number of nodes, and in doing so this also avoids any looping problems
(see Lemma 6.3 below). The second stage may also have multiple solutions; in this
case any one of these solutions can be chosen without effecting either the global
objective (that is, maximizing the maximum possible external arrival rates) or the
user objective (that is, minimizing the number of nodes a message passes through).
The above two-stage optimization problem can be formulated as a single-stage
linear programming (LP) problem as follows:
Let ˆbik denote the row of ˆB which corresponds to zk
i in (6.85), let ˆB∗
ik denote the
matrix ˆB with ˆbik removed, and let ϵ be a positive scalar. Then the LP problem can
be stated as follows:
max
y
Jik(y),

y ∈ℜL(N−1)
+
,
(6.90)
ˆB∗
iky = 0
(6.91)
and
My ≤c.
(6.92)
The following result shows that a solution to the original two-stage optimization
problem may be obtained by solving the above one-stage LP problem.
Lemma 6.3 Let ϵ∗≤1/Lik
M, where Lik
M is the maximum number of links in any non-
cyclic path from node i to node k. Then, if ϵ < ϵ∗, any solution y∗to the above LP
problem is also a solution to the primary stage of the optimization problem. Further-
more, if ϵ < ϵ∗, if y is any other solution to the primary stage of the optimization
problem, then ∥y∗∥1 ≤∥y∥1; i.e. y∗is also a solution the secondary stage of the
optimization problem.
Proof In what follows and for simplicity in exposition, we will use a different no-
tation to denote the links; we will number the links as 1,2,...,L and refer to them
by their number (i.e. we will use vk
l instead of vk
ij, where l is the number of the link
from node i to node j). We will also denote the objective function of the primary
stage of the original optimization problem by J 0
ik. Note that, by using the notation
of the LP problem, Jik(y) = −ˆbiky.
Next note that any solution to the original optimization problem and any solution
to the LP problem has the property that yκ
l = 0, ∀l, ∀κ ̸= k and the property that
yk
l = 0 unless link l is on a non-cyclic path from node i to node k. Let p1,p2,...,pm
be all possible paths from node i to node k. Let lj (j = 1,2,...,m) be a link on path
pj, but not on any other path p1,...,pj−1,pj+1,...,pm (if the original network
does not allow this, one can always replace a single link i −−j with a number of
parallel links such that each link belongs to a different path). Then, by using con-
straints (16b) the objective function of the primary stage of the original optimization
problem can be written as:
J 0
ik =
m

j−1
yk
lj
and the objective function of the LP problem can be written as
Jik(y) =
m

j=0
(1 −ϵLik
j )yk
lj ,

344
6
Decentralized Control of Trafﬁc Networks
where Lik
j denotes the number of links on path pj, where only active constraints are
(6.90) and (6.92). Therefore, if ϵ < 1/max(Lik
M), then any y which maximizes Jik
also maximizes J 0
ik. Furthermore, since the weight in Jil of a path which involves
more links is greater than the weight of a path which involves less links, the LP
problem will also minimize ∥y∥1 among all solutions to the primary stage of the
original problem.
□
It is quite clear that Lik
M ≤L, the number of links of the network. Therefore, we
can solve the above LP problem for any ϵ ∈(0,1/L) (or for any ϵ ∈(0,1/Lik
M), if
Lik
M is known) to ﬁnd a solution to the original two-stage optimization problem.
Now denote the optimal solution to this LP problem by y∗
ik and the optimal value
of Jik(y) by J ∗
ik. Then the column H which corresponds ˜f k
i (i ∈¯N,k ∈¯N) in (6.86)
is given by:
1
J ∗
ik
y∗
ik
and
( ˜f k
i )max = J ∗
ik.
Lemma 6.4 Consider a network with N nodes described by (6.72)–(6.74) which
has the associated equation (6.85). Then:
1. There exists a matrix H such that
(a) All elements of H are non-negative, and
(b) I + ˆBH = 0, where ˆB is given in (6.72)–(6.74),
if and only if the given network is connected.
2. If all link capacities cij, j ∈D(i), i ∈¯N, then all elements of H and ( ˜f k
i )max,
i ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N, are bounded.
Remark 6.12 The forgoing lemma, whose proof is straightforward, ensures that:
(a) there exists a solution to the above optimization problem (and thus to the LP
problem) if and only if the given network is connected, and (b) the solution is
bounded if the link capacities are ﬁnite.
Given that matrix H is constructed as above, we obtain a feedback matrix Θ as
follows:
Algorithm 1 Let ¯hlk
ij be the element of H which relates f k
l to vk
ij in v = Hf (j ∈
D(i), i ∈¯Nk, l ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N), and let

where ¯slk

j∈D(i) ¯hlk
ij and ¯ni is the number of elements of D(i). To construct Θ,
let hlk
ij be the element of Θ which relates qlk
i
to ulk
ij in u = Θq (j ∈D(i), i ∈¯Nk,
l ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N), and let all other elements of Θ be zero.
Observe that, any feedback matrix Θ must satisfy properties 1–4 in order to ob-
tain a valid controller. To show that Θ as constructed above satisﬁes these properties,
we have the following
Lemma 6.5 Given a connected network with N nodes described by (6.72)–(6.74),
let Θ be constructed by Algorithm 1. Then Θ satisﬁes properties 1–4.
Proof The fact that Θ satisﬁes properties 1 and 4 is readily obvious from the con-
struction of Θ. Now to show that Θ satisﬁes property 2, consider ˆq = Bou, u = Θq
which gives:
ˆqlk

since 
j∈D(i) hlk
ij = 1, ∀i ∈¯Nk, ∀l ∈¯Nk, ∀k ∈¯N by construction.
Next to show that Θ satisﬁes property 3, we ﬁrst establish that for each l ∈¯N,
Θ deﬁnes a path
i = i0, ii, i2, ..., im−1, im = k
from each i ∈¯N to each k ∈¯N\{i,l}, in the sense that ij+1 ∈D(ij) and hlk
ijij+1 >
0 for each successive pair ij,ij+1 on the path. Note that in order to satisfy the
constraint (6.88) of the optimization problem, H must deﬁne at least one such path
from each l ∈¯N to each k ∈¯Nl. Thus, for each l ∈¯N, Θ deﬁnes at least one path
from l to each k ∈¯Nl. If i /∈{l,k} is on such a path, then Θ also deﬁnes a path
from i to k for l; if i is not on such a path, then hlk
ij = 1/¯ni > 0, ∀j ∈D(i). Thus
if k ∈D(i) or if there exists a j ∈D(i) which is on a path from l to k, then a path
is established from i to k for l; if neither of these two conditions are satisﬁed, then
hlk
j1j2 = l/¯nj1 > 0, ∀j2 ∈D(j1), ∀j1 ∈D(i). On continuing this procedure (since
the network is connected and has a ﬁnite number of nodes), we eventually reach
either node k, or a node which is on a path from l to k, and hence the desired
result is established. The rest of the proof is now directly obtained by the foregoing
lemmas.
□
6.8.5 Some Properties
Now consider the controller described by (6.88), where the feedback matrix Θ
is given by Algorithm 1. Given that routing control constraint (a) is satisﬁed,
the following theorem shows that this controller satisﬁes routing control con-
straints (b)–(e):

346

Decentralized Control of Trafﬁc Networks
Theorem 6.7 Consider a connected network with N nodes described by (6.72)–
(6.74). Assume that the controller described by (6.79) is applied where the matrix
Θ is constructed by Algorithm 1. Then for all t0 ∈Z, for all x(t0) ∈ℜN∗
+ , and for
all f (t) ∈ℜN(N−1)
+
,
1. Non-negativity constraints (routing control constraints (b), (c), and (d)) are sat-
isﬁed for all t ≥t0,
2. Link capacity constraints (routing control constraint (e)) are satisﬁed for all
t ≥t0.
Proof 1. Given x(t0) ∈ℜN∗
+
and that Θ satisﬁes property 1, (6.80) implies that
ˆu(t0) ≥0. By (6.84) then implies that 0 ≤u(t0) ≤ˆu(t0). Using this result in (6.73)
we obtain m(t0 + 1) ≥0. Since we also have f (t0) ≥0, we also obtain x(t0 +
1) ≥0. By repeating this argument, we obtain m(t) ≥0 and u(t) ≥0 for all t ≥t0.
Routing control constraints (e) and (d) are thus satisﬁed. Given that x(t) ≥0, ∀t ≥t0
(as established above), the desired result for routing control constraint (b) follows
from (6.83).
2. Immediately follows from (6.84).
□
Before proceeding further, we need to introduce the following deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 6.3 Consider a connected network with N nodes described by (6.72)–
(6.74) and assume that a controller is applied to this network. We say that the mes-
sages are directed around a loop if for some k ∈¯N, and for some set of nodes
{i1,i2,...,im} ⊂¯Nk such that ij+1 ∈D(ij), j = l,2,...,m −1, i1 ∈D(im), and
ij ̸= il, for j ̸= l, we have:
ulk
i1i2(t1) > 0,
ulk
i2i3 > 0,
...,
ulk
im−1im(tm−1) > 0
(6.93)
for some l ∈¯Nk, t1 ≥t0, t2 ≥t0, ..., and tm−1 ≥t0, and:
ulk
imi1(t) > 0
(6.94)
for some t ≥t0. If the above condition never happens, then we say that the messages
are not directed around a loop.
Remark 6.13 Note that the above deﬁnition is more general than the usual message
looping criteria, which considers looping of individual messages alone. According
to the above deﬁnition, a loop is formed when messages belonging to a particular
origin-destination pair are transmitted around a loop (whether they are the same
messages or not). Therefore, avoiding the above deﬁned looping is stronger than
avoiding individual message looping.
That the proposed controller (6.84) does not direct messages around a loop, is
shown by the following theorem:

6.8
Discrete-Time Dynamic Routing
347
Theorem 6.8 Consider a connected network with N nodes described by (6.72)–
(6.74). Assume that the controller described by (6.84) is applied where the matrix Θ
is constructed by Algorithm 1. Furthermore, assume that x(t0) = 0, and that f (t) ∈
ℜN(N−1)
+
, ∀t ≥t0, for some t0 ∈Z. Then the messages are not directed around a
loop.
Proof We will use contradiction to prove this theorem. Given (6.93), assume that
(6.94) also holds. This, however. can happen only if
hlk
i1i2 > 0,
hlk
i2i3 > 0,
...,
hlk
imi1 > 0,
(6.95)
hlk
imi1 > 0,
(6.96)
where hlk
ij denotes appropriate element of Θ.
If hlk
ij ij+1 > 0, for any j ∈1,2,...,m −1, then either ¯hlk
ijij+1 > 0 or ¯slk
ij = 0,
where ¯hlk
ij and ¯slk
i
are deﬁned in Algorithm 1. Similarly, at hlk
imi1 > 0, then ei-
ther ¯hlk
imi1 > 0 or ¯slk
ij = 0. If ¯slk
ij = 0, for any j ∈{1,2,...,m}, then no messages
with source l and destination k can reach node ij under controller (6.84); thus
ulk
ij s = 0, ∀s ∈D(i), which contradicts (6.95)–(6.96). On the other hand, if ¯hlk
i1i2 > 0,
¯hlk
i2i3 > 0,..., ¯hlk
im−1im > 0, and ¯hlk
imi1 > 0 results from a solution of the initial stage of
the optimization problem, then there must exist another solution of the same stage,
where all the elements of H remains the same, except that ¯hlk
i1i2, ¯hlk
i2i3,..., ¯hlk
im−1im,
and ¯hlk
imi1 are reduced by min(minj(¯hlk
ijij+1), ¯hlk
imi1), in which ¯hlk
ijij+1 becomes zero
for at least one j ∈{1,2,...,m −1} or ¯hlk
imi1 becomes zero. By the ﬁnal stage, we
then choose the latter solution over the former one; hence situation (6.95)–(6.96)
will never arise.
□
Remark 6.14 It is evident from the above proof that, if x(t0) ̸= 0, x(t0) ∈ℜN∗
+ , then
only messages which are present at a node, which is not on a path deﬁned by the
matrix H from their source node to their destination node at time t0 may be routed
around a loop. In particular, since the source node is always on a path deﬁned by
the matrix H, messages which enter the network at time t ≥t0, are never directed
around a loop.
That the controller (6.84) can recover the steady-state properties of the controller
described by (6.79) is established by the following theorem provided that the mes-
sage arrival rates do not exceed the maximum rates given by the optimization prob-
lem.
Theorem 6.9 Consider a connected network with N nodes described by (6.72)–
(6.74). Assume that the controller described by (6.84) is applied where the matrix Θ
is constructed by Algorithm 1. Then

for some i ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N; then for all constant f k
i ∈[0,( ˜f k
i )max],
m(t) = 0,
∀t ≥t0
and p(t), q(t), and u(t) remain bounded for all t ≥t0.
3. Assume that x(t0) = 0 for some t0 ∈Z and that f (t) is given by (6.97); then
p(∞) = q(∞) = −R(BΘ)−1Ef∞
(6.98)
and
u(∞) = −Θ(BΘ)−1Ef∞
(6.99)
for all constant f k
i ∈[0,( ¯f k
i )max].
Proof To prove part 1, we need to establish that, under the hypothesis, 
i,l,k |qlk
i |
cannot increase, where 
i,l,k(·) ≤
k∈¯N

l∈¯Nk

i∈¯Nk(·). Then we will show that
the desired result holds if q(t) converges to zero. Finally, we will use contradiction
to show that under the hypothesis, q(t) must indeed converge to zero.
Now assume that f (t) = 0, ∀t ≥t0; then from (6.68) we have:

i∈¯Nk
qlk
i (t + 1) =

i∈¯Nk

i∈¯Nk

i (t) −

i∈Uk
ulk
ik(t),
∀l ∈¯Nk,∀k ∈¯N.
This means that

i,l,k
qlk
i (t + 1) =

i,l,k

i (t) −

l∈¯N

k∈D(i)\l

ik(t).
Taking into account that the controller (6.84) satisﬁes the non-negativity constraints,
this implies that 
i,l,k qlk
i
(or equivalently 
i,l,k |qlk
i |) not increase. Assume now
that q(t) converges to zero. Then, since 0 ≤m(t) ≤q(t),m(t) also converges
to zero. Furthermore, since wr(t) ∈ℜN(N−1)
+
∀t ≥t0 (follows from the fact that
x(t) ≥0, ∀t ≥t0, which was shown earlier) and q(t) = m(t) + p(t), where p(t) is

6.8
Discrete-Time Dynamic Routing
349
given by (6.68), this implies that wr(t) (t = l,2,...,rmax) also converge to zero.
Therefore, we obtain that limt→∞x(t) = 0, which is the desired result.
Assume now that q(t) does not converge to zero. Then there exists k ∈¯N,
ℓ∈¯Nk, and a set S ⊂¯Nk such that
lim
t→∞

i∈S
qlk
i (t) > 0,
lim
t→∞

i∈S

j∈D(i)\S
ulk
ij = 0.
This, however, can only be true if there exists i ∈S such that there exists no path
from i to k for l which is a contradiction. It was established in before that Θ deﬁnes
a path from each i ∈¯Nk to each k ∈¯N for each ℓ∈¯Nk. Thus, the desired result is
attained.
To prove part 2, we will refer to (6.68)–(6.69). Assume that x(t0) = 0, and
f (t) = (0,...,0,f k
l ,0,...,0)t,
∀t ≥t0
where f k
l ∈[0,( ˜f k
l )max].
An immediate result of Theorem 6.8 is that ulk
il (t) = 0,∀t ≥t0,∀i ∈U(l), which
implies that
qlk
l (t + 1) = qlk
l + f k
l (t) −

j∈D(i)
ulk
ij (t).
Now since x(t0) = 0, and ulk
il (t) = 0, ∀t ≥t0, ∀i ∈U(l), this implies that
ulk
lj (t) = hlk
lj f (t −rlk
l ) =
hlk
lj f k

∀t ≥t0 + rlk
l ,
0,
∀t ∈[t0,t0 + rlk
l )
(6.100)
provided that 
s,r usr
lj (t) ≤clj, ∀j ∈D(l). However, since f r
s (t) = 0, ∀(s,r) ̸=
(l,k), usr
lj = 0, ∀(s,r) ̸= (l,k) and since f k
l ≤( ˜f k
l )max, ulk
lj ≤clj, this implies that
mlk
l (t) = 0,
∀t ≥t0, ∀t ≥t0
(6.101)
and
qlk
l (t + 1) =
qlk
l (t),
∀t ≥t0 + rlk
l ,
qlk
l (t) + f k
l ,
∀t ∈[t0,t0 + rlk
l ).
(6.102)
Now consider a node i, i ̸= k, which is on a path from l to k for l. Then
qlk
i (t + 1) = qlk
i (t) +

that

ji does not
depend on qlk

l ≤( ˜f l

ij (t),j ∈D(i)
is structured such that
0 ≤

from which we obtain
qlk

where λ ∈[0,1]. Therefore, the overall system is described by a set of ﬁrst order
linear time-invariant systems, with non-negative real eigenvalues none of which ex-
ceed one, cascaded together. This implies that no overshoot in the system’s response
occurs, that is
ulk
ij (t) ≤ulk
ij (∞) ≤cij,
∀j ∈D(i).
It is concluded therefore that:

(6.105)
Combining equations (6.100)–(6.102) with (6.103)–(6.105), and on noting that:
qsi
i (t) = 0,
∀t ≥t0,∀i ∈¯Nr,∀(s,r) ̸= (l,k),
(6.106)
msr
i (t) = 0,

and

∀t ≥t0, ∀j ∈D(i), ∀i ∈¯Nr, ∀(s,r) ̸= (l,k)
(6.108)
we conclude that
m(t) = 0,
∀t ≥t0
and that q(t),p(t)(≤q(t) −m(t)),u(t) remain bounded.
To prove part 3, we extend on the proof of part 2 and the assumption that rlk
i
is
constant for all i ∈¯Nk, l ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N. From (6.100)–(6.102), we obtain
qlk
l (∞) = rlk

(6.111)
Combining (6.100)–(6.111) and on noting that p(t) = q(t) −m(t), we obtain
(6.100)–(6.102), which is the desired result.

Remark 6.15 If f k
i > ( ˜f k
i )max, then there exists no controller which can keep the
queue lengths bounded.
Remark 6.16 So far we have assumed that the control signals are updated syn-
chronously throughout the network and that the processing delay times remain ﬁxed.
However, note that the proofs of Theorems 6.7–6.9 remain valid whether not the
control Signals are updated synchronously at different nodes. In fact, the control
signals may be updated using different periods at different nodes. Furthermore, the
proofs of Theorems 6.7–6.8 and the proof of part 1 of Theorem 6.9 remain valid
as long as the processing delay times are non-negative and bounded (not neces-
sarily ﬁxed). For part 2 of Theorem 6.9, if the processing delay decreases from
one sampling instant to the next, then the queue of length of processed messages
may become positive, The rest of this part (that m(t), p(t), q(t), and u(t) remain
bounded), however, also remains valid for the case of time varying but non-negative
and bounded processing delay times.
The following result is obtained, which summarizes the results obtained for the
more general case of asynchronous operation with possibly time varying processing
delay times.
Corollary 6.1 Consider a connected network with N nodes whose dynamics at
each node is described by (1a) and (1b), where the time-scale for each node may
be different, that is, the unit of t (the sampling period in the actual time scale) in
(6.68) and (6.69) may be different from each node. The processing delay times may
be time-varying, but are assumed to be bounded, i.e. we assume that there exists
(rlk
i )max ≥0, such that 0 ≤(rlk
i )max, ∀t ≥t0, ∀i ∈¯Nk, ∀ℓ∈¯Nk, ∀k ∈¯N. Assume
that the following controller is applied at each node:
ulk = γij(t)ˆulk,
∀t ≥t0,
(6.112)
where γij(t) is given following (6.84) and
ˆulk
ij (t) = hlk
ij glk
i (t),
∀t ≥t0,
(6.113)
where glk
i (t) is the of total volume of messages with source l and destination k which
can be sent out from node i at time t and hlk
ij is the appropriate element of Θ, where
the matrix Θ is constructed by Algorithm 1. Moreover, assume that x(t0) ∈ℜN∗
+ and
that f (t) ∈ℜN(N−1)
+
, ∀t ≥t0, for some t0 ∈Z. Then

Decentralized Control of Trafﬁc Networks
1. Routing control constraints (a)–(e) are satisﬁed.
2. Assume that x(t0); then the messages are not directed around a loop. If x(t0) ̸= 0,
then only messages which are present at a node, which is not on a path deﬁned
by the matrix H from their source node to their destination node at time t0 may
be routed around a loop. In particular, messages which enter the network at time
t ≥t0 are never directed around a loop.
3. The closed-loop system is globally asymptotically stable.
4. Assume that x(t0) = 0 and that f (t) is given by (6.97), then for all constant
f k
i ∈[0,( ˜f k
i )max], m(t), p(t), q(t), and u(t) remain bounded for all t ≥t0.
5. Assume that x(t0) = 0, that f (t) is given by (6.97), and that rlk
i
is constant,
∀t ≥t0, ∀i ∈¯Nk, ∀ℓ∈¯Nk, ∀k ∈¯N; then m(t) = 0, ∀t ≥t0 + 1, and p(t), q(t)
and u(t) converge to the steady state values given in (6.98)–(6.99).
Remark 6.17 If the control signals are updated synchronously throughout the net-
work, then controller (6.112)–(6.113) is equivalent to controller (6.84). However,
controller (6.112)–(6.113) can also be used in the case of asynchronous operation.
Furthermore, (6.112)–(6.113) are more suitable from an implementation point of
view, since the implementation of the proposed controller will be done locally at
individual nodes.
Remark 6.18 Assume that f (t) belongs to the class used for the optimization;
then Θ, constructed by Algorithm 1, allows the maximum possible magnitudes on
each individual component of f (t) to occur, such that all of the above properties
(given by Theorems 6.7–6.9) hold.
The actual external message arrival rates into a network may, of course, not
belong to the class (14) used for the optimization; they may in fact be time-
varying. In addition, the initial conditions may be non-zero. For a constant vector
ˆf = { ˆf k
i } ∈ℜN(N−1)
+
and for a scalar φ > 0, let us deﬁne:
Ω
ˆf
φ = {f (t) = {f k
i (t)} ∈ℜN(N−1)
+
| 0 ≤f k
i (t) ≤φ ˆf k
i , ∀t ≥t0,∀i ∈¯Nk,∀k ∈¯N}.
The following corollary, stated without proof, ensures that the proposed controller
(6.112)–(6.113) can keep the queue lengths bounded. without violating the con-
straints (b)–(e), for all non-negative initial conditions and for all (possibly time-
varying) non-negative external message arrival rates, provided only that the magni-
tude of these rates is not too large. This property is true whether or not these arrival
rates belong to the class used for the optimization.
Corollary 6.2 Consider a connected network with N nodes whose dynamics at
each node is described by (6.68)–(6.69), where the time-scale for each node may be
different. The processing delay times may be time-varying, but are assumed to be
bounded. Assume that the controller described by (6.112)–(6.113) is applied where
the matrix Θ is constructed by Algorithm 1. Then for all constant ˆf ∈ℜN(N−1)
+
, for

6.8
Discrete-Time Dynamic Routing
353
all t0 ∈Z and for all constant x0 ∈ℜN∗
+ , there exists a scalar φ > 0, such that for
all f (t) ∈Ω
ˆf
φ , m(t), p(t), q(t), and u(t) remain bounded ∀t ≥t0.
It can also be shown that if, in addition to the external message arrival rates,
the magnitude of the initial conditions is also sufﬁciently small, then the controller
(6.112)–(6.113) also drives the queue length m of the processed messages immedi-
ately to zero.
Corollary 6.3 Consider a connected network with N nodes whose dynamics at each
node is described by (6.68)–(6.69), where the time-scale for each node may be
different. The processing delay times may be time-varying, but are assumed to be
bounded. Assume that the controller described by (6.112)–(6.113) is applied where
the matrix Θ is constructed by Algorithm 1. Then for all constant ¯f ∈ℜN(N−1)
+
, for
all constant ˆx0 ∈ℜN∗
+ , and for all t0 ∈Z, there exist scalars φx > 0 and φf > 0,
such that for all initial conditions x(t0) ≤φx ˆx0, x(t0) ≥0 and for all f (t) ∈Ω
ˆf
φf ,
mlk
i (t0 + 1) = 0, ∀i ∈¯Nk, ∀l ∈¯Nk, ∀k ∈¯N, and m(t), p(t), q(t), and u(t) re-
main bounded for all t ≥t0. Furthermore, if processing delay time rlk
i
is constant,
∀t ≥t0, ∀i ∈¯Nk, ∀l ∈¯Nk, ∀k ∈¯N, then m(t) = 0, ∀t ≥t0 + 1, and p(t),q(t) and
u(t) converge to the steady-state values given in (6.98)–(6.99).
Remark 6.19 In the foregoing analysis, the following assumptions were made:
(i) the rate of messages being sent out from one node to another (the control sig-
nals) are updated at discrete periodic instants;
(ii) processing delay times are ﬁxed;
(iii) the control signals are updated synchronously throughout the network;
(iv) upper constraints on the volume of messages that can be processed or buffered
are not violated.
It was shown that (iii) can be removed; in fact control signals may be updated
with different periods at different nodes. We have also shown that (ii) is not a nec-
essary assumption, as long as processing delay times remain bounded. This latter
assumption can be justiﬁed as long as the arrival rate of messages remain bounded
since any message can be processed in a ﬁnite time. Assumption (i) represents
the usual case in a practical implementation [14, 15] for the case when the con-
trol signals are updated continuously. Finally, (iv) can be justiﬁed, since for today‘s
computers, storage restrictions are usually less important than transmission capacity
constraints.
6.8.6 Simulation Examples
In this section we consider the network shown in Fig. 6.9. The capacity of each link
is indicated by a number associated with each link in the ﬁgure. The processing
delays are assumed to be rlk
i = 5 (i ∈¯Nk, ℓ∈¯Nk, k ∈¯N, N = 3).

( ˜f 1

( ˜f 2

are shown in Fig. 6.12. The capacities of the links l-to-2 and 2-to-3 are saturated. In
fact, in this case, there is no solution to the routing problem which keeps the queue

Certain components of m and q build-up during the ﬁrst 50 sampling periods. How-
ever, they start decreasing immediately after the external message arrivals are shut-
off, as shown in Figs. 6.13 and 6.14.
All the queues are cleared within 76 sampling periods after shut-off. The total

case m(t) remains at zero ∀t ≥0; and q(t) converges to a constant steady state value
as shown in Fig. 6.18. The individual message ﬂow rates are shown in Fig. 6.19.
Note that the steady-state values of u32

32 are equal to the link capacities cl2
and c32 respectively.

i (t) = 0, ∀(i,k) ̸= (3,2), ∀t ≥0, x(0) = 0. In
this case, m and q are unbounded as shown in Figs. 6.20 and 6.21, and the link ca-
pacities of the links l-to-2, 3-to-1, and 3-to-2 are saturated, as shown in Fig. 6.22. In
this example, since f 2
3 (t) = 10 > (˜(f )2

6.9 Notes and References
The main contribution of this chapter lies is the methodology of solving the cen-
tralized and decentralized routing problems by incorporating queuing dynamics and
physical constraints that exist in the trafﬁc network. The transmitting, propagating,
and processing delays considered in the dynamics of the network were assumed to
be unknown and fast time-varying. By employing the H∞robust control strategy,
the developed routing schemes will guarantee the desired routing performance in
the presence of unknown fast time-varying delays and other network uncertainties
through the minimization of the worst-case queuing length. It is worth noting that
since the proposed decentralized routing controller can be implemented locally at
each individual node, it is therefore scalable to large and crowded trafﬁc networks.
For routing in multi-destination data communication networks, a decentralized
controller were presented where the dynamic model developed to describe the net-
work dynamics incorporates processing delays. The controller design involves an
optimization problem, which can be conveniently solved off-line. The developed
controller has the property that it allows the maximum possible magnitude on each
external message arrival rate of the system to occur, without violating any con-
straints on the system. Further interesting results and applications can been devel-
oped by applying the ideas of [16, 28, 31, 32, 36].

Chapter 7
Decentralized Control of Markovian Jump
Systems
This chapter deals with systems having Markovian jump parameters. There are ba-
sically two types of models. The ﬁrst type describes interconnected systems with
Markovian jump parameters for which the problems of stochastic stability and sta-
bilization are examined and a set of feedback controls is conveniently developed. In
the second type, we deal with systems with Markov chains exhibiting slow-fast sep-
aration. An appropriate averaging and aggregation technique is developed for this
purpose. Under state feedback policies, the H∞control design for large scale jump
linear systems where the form process admits strong and weak interactions. Through
an analysis that covers both ﬁnite and inﬁnite horizon cases and using averaging and
aggregation techniques, an aggregate jump linear system of considerably smaller or-
der has been obtained, along with a corresponding (compatible) cost function. This
reduced-order (aggregate) problem is another piecewise-deterministic H∞control
problem, and based on the solution of this problem, we obtain the asymptotic limit
of the optimal performance level for the full-order system, as well as an approxi-
mate controller that can asymptotically achieve any desired performance level for
the full-order system.
7.1 Control for Markovian Jump Systems
In this section, we examine the problems of stochastic stability and stabilization for a
class of interconnected systems with Markovian jump parameters. The jumping pa-
rameters are treated as continuous-time, discrete-state Markov process. The purpose
is to design decentralized state feedback controller such that stochastic quadratic
stability and a prescribed H∞-performance are guaranteed. Next, the robust H∞-
control problem for linear interconnected systems with Markovian jump parameters
and parametric uncertainties is studied. The parametric uncertainties are assumed to
be real, time-varying and norm-bounded that appear in the state matrix. Both cases
of ﬁnite-horizon and inﬁnite-horizon are analyzed. We establish that the decentral-
ized control problem for interconnected Markovian jump systems with and without

uncertain parameters can be essentially solved in terms of the solutions of a ﬁnite set
of coupled differential (or algebraic) Riccati equations. Extension of the developed
results to the case of uncertain jumping rates is provided. Further interesting results
and applications can been developed by applying the ideas of [26, 29–31, 60].
7.1.1 Introduction
Dynamical systems subject to frequent unpredictable structural changes can be con-
veniently modeled as piecewise deterministic systems, where the underlying dy-
namics are represented by different forms depending on the value of an associated
Markov chain process. An important class of such systems is the jump linear sys-
tems. Research into class of systems and their applications span several decades. For
some representative prior work on this general topic, we refer the reader to [1–4,
6–12, 14–21, 32–48] and the references therein.
When the plant modeling uncertainty or external disturbance uncertainty is of
major concern in control systems, robust control theory provides tractable design
tools using the time domain and the frequency domain; see [9] and the references
cited therein.
On the other hand, problems of decentralized control and stabilization of inter-
connected systems are receiving considerable interests [11–18] where most of the
effort are focused on dealing with the interaction patterns and performing the control
analysis and design on the subsystem level.
The purpose of this section is to develop criteria of stochastic stability and sta-
bilization of a class of linear interconnected systems with Markovian jump pa-
rameters. The jumping parameters are treated as continuous-time, discrete-state
Markov process. First, the notion of stochastic decentralized stability is introduced
and an appropriate LMI-based criterion is developed. Based thereon, the purpose
is to design decentralized state feedback controller such that stochastic quadratic
stability and a prescribed H∞-performance are guaranteed. Next, the robust H∞-
control problem for linear interconnected systems with Markovian jump parame-
ters and parametric uncertainties is studied. The parametric uncertainties are as-
sumed to be real, time-varying and norm-bounded that appear in the state ma-
trix. Both cases of ﬁnite-horizon and inﬁnite-horizon are analyzed. We establish
that the decentralized control problem for interconnected Markovian jump sys-
tems with and without uncertain parameters can be essentially solved in terms
of the solutions of a ﬁnite set of coupled differential (or algebraic) Riccati equa-
tions.
7.1.2 Problem Statement
Given a probability space (Ω,F,P) where Ω is the sample space, F is the algebra
of events and P is the probability measure deﬁned on F. We consider a class of

uncertain systems with Markovian jump parameters described by:
˙x(t) = A(t,ηt)x(t) + B(t,ηt)u(t) + Γ (t,ηt)w(t),
xo = φ,
ηo = i,
t ∈[0,T ],
(7.1)
z(t) = G(t,ηt)x(t) + F(t,ηt)u(t)
(7.2)
which we will recognize in the sequel as an interconnection of ns coupled uncertain
subsystems and modeled in state-space form by:
˙xj(t) = Aj(t,ηt)xj(t) + Bj(t,ηt)uj(t) + Γj(t,ηt)wj(t) + gj(t),

(7.6)
where for (7.1)–(7.2) x,u,w satisfy
x = (xt

ns)t,
u = (ut
1,...,ut
ns)t,
w = (wt
1,...,wt
ns)t,
z = (zt
1,...,zt
ns)t.
For (7.3)–(7.6) with j ∈{1,...,ns}, xj(t) ∈ℜnj is the state vector; uj(t) ∈ℜmj is
the control input, wj(t) ∈ℜqj is the disturbance input which belongs to L2[0,T ];
yj(t) ∈ℜpj is the measured output and zj(t) ∈ℜrj is the controlled output which
belongs to L2[(Ω,F,P),[0,T ]]. From now onwards, the notations Lss and Css
refer, respectively, to the original large-scale system (7.1)–(7.2) and composite sub-
system representation (7.3)–(7.6). An important identity that links both representa-
tions is expressed as [22]:

The main difference in the underlying treatment of both representations is the ex-
plicit modeling of interconnections among subsystems as represented by the vector
gj(t) ∈ℜnj which in effect designates an interaction input to the jth subsystem.
For various technical and operational factors, it is considered convenient to deal
with Css instead of Lss and hence, in the remaining part of this work, we will base
the analysis and design on the subsystem level. This implies that we will closely
examine the role of interactions on the system behavior.
With reference to either Css or Lss, the random form process {ηt,t ∈[0,T ]} is a
homogeneous, ﬁnite-state Markovian process with right continuous trajectories and
taking values in a ﬁnite set S = {1,2,...,s} with transition probability from mode i

modes of system (7.3)–(7.6) and for each possible value ηt = i, i ∈S, we will
denote the matrices of subsystem j associated with mode i by Aj(t,ηt) := Aj(t,i),

Fj(t,i) are known, real, time-varying, piecewise-continuous between each jump,
bounded matrices of appropriate dimensions describing the nominal system.

Remark 7.1 In [18], it has been established that, for subsystem (7.10) with j = 1,
the terms “stochastically stable”, “exponentially mean-square stable”, and “asymp-
totically mean-square stable”, are equivalent, and any of them can imply “almost
surely asymptotically stable”. Extending on these results, we have introduced Def-
inition 7.1 to suit Lss and Css representations. In the sequel, we will use for sub-
system (7.10) with j ∈{1,...,ns}, the equivalent terms “stochastically decentrally
stable”, “exponentially mean-square decentrally stable”, and “asymptotically mean-
square decentrally stable”, interchangeably.

Deﬁnition 7.2 The nominal jump subsystem (7.11) is said to be stochastically de-
centrally stabilizable if for all ﬁnite initial state φ ∈ℜn, for all interaction inputs
gj(t) ∈ℜn, j ∈{1,...,ns} and initial mode ηo ∈S there exists a linear constant
feedback gain K∗
j (t,ηt), j ∈{1,...,ns}, such that the decentralized control law
uj(t) = −K∗
j (t,ηt)xj(t),
j ∈{1,...,ns}, ∥K∗
j (t,ηt)∥< ∞
(7.21)
ensures that the resulting closed-loop subsystem is stochastically decentrally stable.
By similarity to Lemma 7.1, we have the following result for the stochastic de-
centralized stabilizability of subsystem (7.11).
Lemma 7.2 Consider the nominal jump subsystem (7.11). For any matrix Qj(i) =
Qt
j(i)t > 0, i ∈S, if there exist matrices Pj(i) = P t
j (i)t > 0, i ∈S, j ∈{1,...,ns},
satisfying

∀i ∈S, (7.22)
where
¯Aj(i) = Aj(i) −Bj(i)K∗
j (i)
(7.23)
then the subsystem (7.11) is stochastically decentrally stabilizable.
Remark 7.2 Both Lemma 7.1 and Lemma 7.2 show that the stochastic stabilizabil-
ity of the nominal jump subsystem is related to the existence of positive-deﬁnite
solutions to a set of s coupled algebraic Riccati equations. Equivalently stated, the
stochastic stabilizability of the interconnected nominal jump system amounts to the
existence of positive-deﬁnite solutions to a coupled set of ns × s algebraic Riccati
equations.
In the sequel, associated with Css (7.3)–(7.6) such that j ∈{1,...,ns}, we con-
sider the stabilization problem of Lss (7.1)–(7.2) with H∞performance using de-
centralized state-feedback controllers of the type (7.21) under the assumption of
perfect state information. The objective is to design a decentralized feedback con-
troller Gj(t,ηt) such that, for all nonzero w(t) ∈L2

where γ > 0 is a prescribed level of disturbance attenuation. When system (7.3)–
(7.6) under the action of the controller Gj(t,ηt) satisﬁes condition (2.23), the in-
terconnected controlled system is said to have H∞-performance over the horizon
[0,T ].
Two distinct cases arise:
(1) The ﬁnite-horizon case in which the system (7.3)–(7.6) with j ∈{1,...,ns}
under the decentralized feedback controller Gj(t,ηt) has performance (7.24)
over a given horizon [0,T ];
(2) The inﬁnite-horizon case in which the system (7.3)–(7.6) with j ∈{1,...,ns}
under the decentralized feedback controller Gj(t,ηt) is stochastically decen-
trally stable and has performance (7.24) over a given horizon [0,∞].
Under perfect state-information, we consider the following system description
for ηt = i, i ∈S

(7.28)
and make the following assumptions:
Assumption 7.1 For all i ∈S on [0,T ] and for all j ∈{1,...,ns},
F t
j(t,i)Fj(t,i) = R(t,i),
Rj(t,i) = Rt(t,i) > 0.
Assumption 7.2 For all i ∈S and for all j ∈{1,...,ns},
(1) {Aj(i),Bj(i)} is stochastically decentrally stabilizable,
(2) {Cj(i),Aj(i)} is decentrally observable.
Remark 7.3 Assumption 7.1 ensures that the H∞-control problem for system
(7.25)–(7.28) is nonsingular and corresponds to the standard assumption in H∞-
control theory fr linear systems without jump parameters. Assumption 7.2 guaran-
tees the existence of a decentralized stabilizing controller for system (7.25)–(7.28)
subject to (7.8)–(7.9). The term “decentrally” is used to emphasize that the underly-
ing condition is satisﬁed on the subsystem level.

7.1.3 H∞-State Feedback Controller
In this section, we consider the design of a decentralized H∞-state feedback con-
troller for system (7.25)–(7.28) subject to (7.8)–(7.9). First we treat the design prob-
lem on a ﬁnite horizon.
Theorem 7.1 Consider the system (7.25)–(7.28) subject to (7.8)–(7.9) and j ∈
{1,...,ns}. Then, for a given γ > 0, there exists a decentralized state-feedback
controller uj(t) of the type (7.21) such that
∥zj(t)∥E2 < γ ∥wj(t)∥2
for all nonzero w(t) ∈L2[0,T ], if the following set of ns × s coupled differential
Riccati equations:

controller is given by:
uj(t) = −K∗
j (t,ηt)xj(t),
K∗(t,ηt) = R−1
j (t,ηt)[Bt

i ∈S, j ∈{1,...,ns} are decentrally observable, the stochastic stability of the
interconnected closed-loop systems follows from the results of [31]. The H∞-
performance ∥zj(t)∥E2 < γ ∥wj(t)∥2 for all nonzero wj(t) ∈L2[0,∞], can be
readily obtained in the manner of Theorem 7.1.

Remark 7.4 Theorem 7.1 and Theorem 7.2 establish sufﬁcient solvability condi-
tions for the H∞-control problem of the interconnected system (2.1)–(2.3) over

are expressed in terms ns × s coupled differential and algebraic Riccati equations,
respectively. It should be noted that when ηt = 1 and Ajk ≡0, Theorem 7.1 and
Theorem 7.2 recover the standard results of H∞-control problems of single linear
systems.
7.1.4 Robust H∞-Control Results
In this section, we consider the design of a decentralized robust H∞feedback con-
troller for the interconnected system (7.3)–(7.6) with uncertain parameters. In this
case, the state-space model is given by:
Sj:

zj(t) = Gj(t,ηt)xj(t) + Fj(t,ηt)uj(t),
(7.43)
where for j ∈{1,...,ns}, xj(t), uj(t), wj(t), yj(t), zj(t) and Aj(t,ηt), Bj(t,ηt),
Γj(t,ηt), Gj(t,ηt), Fj(t,ηt) are the same as in (7.3)–(7.6) and ΔAj(t,ηt) is a real,
time-varying matrix function representing the norm-bounded parameter uncertainty.
The admissible parameter uncertainties are assumed to be modeled in the form:
ΔAj(t,ηt) = Mj(t,ηt)Δj(t,ηt)Nj(t,ηt),
(7.44)
where for ηt = i and j ∈{1,...,ns}, Mj(t,ηt) ∈ℜnj ×βj and Nj(t,ηt) ∈ℜβj ×nj
are known real, time-varying, piecewise-continuous matrices between each jump,
which designates the way the uncertain parameters in Δj(t,ηt) affects the nominal
matrix Aj(t,ηt) with Δj(t,ηt), ηt = i ∈S being an unknown, time-varying matrix
function satisfying
∥Δj(t,ηt)∥2 ≤1,
ηt = i ∈S,
(7.45)
where the elements of Δj(t,ηt) are Lebesgue measurable for any ηt = i ∈S. In
the inﬁnite-horizon case, t →∞, the matrices Mj(t,ηt), Δj(t,ηt), Nj(t,ηt) are
constants with ηt = i ∈S and will be denoted by Mj(i), Δj(i), Nj(i), respec-
tively.
In the sequel, we consider the problem of robust state-feedback control of the
uncertain, interconnected Markovian jumping system (7.41)–(7.43). Our purpose is
to design a decentralized feedback controller Gj(t,ηt)
uj(t) = −Kj(t,ηt)xj(t),
j ∈{1,...,ns},
(7.46)

dition (7.47), the interconnected controlled system is said to have H∞-performance

Extending on Deﬁnition 7.3, we introduce the following
Deﬁnition 7.4 The nominal jump subsystem (7.49) is said to be stochastically de-
centrally stabilizable if for all ﬁnite initial state φ ∈ℜn, initial mode ηo ∈S, and
for all admissible uncertainties satisfying (4.4)–(4.5) there exists a linear feedback

(7.53)
where ∥Kj(t,ηt)∥< ∞, ensure that the resulting closed-loop subsystem is robustly
stochastically decentrally stable.
By similarity to Lemma 7.3, we have the following result for the stochastic de-
centralized stabilizability of subsystem (7.49).

We now focus attention on the controller design. More speciﬁcally, the objective
is to design a robust decentralized state-feedback controller Gj(t,ηt) such that:
(1) In the ﬁnite-horizon case , the system (7.41)–(7.45) with j ∈{1,...,ns} under
the decentralized feedback controller Gj(t,ηt) has performance (7.47) over a
given horizon [0,T ]; or
(2) In the inﬁnite-horizon case in which the system (7.41)–(7.45) with j ∈
{1,...,ns} under the decentralized feedback controller Gj(t,ηt) is stochasti-
cally decentrally stable and has performance (7.47) over a given horizon [0,∞].
The main results are established by the following theorems for the cases of ﬁnite-
horizon and inﬁnite-horizon cases, respectively.

and hence we conclude that if we solve the H∞-control problem for system (7.61)–
(7.63) with (7.4)–(7.6), then we can also solve the robust H∞-control problem for
system (7.41)–(7.43) with (7.4)–(7.6) using the same controller.
Remark 7.7 Extension of the developed robustness results to the case where the
jumping rates are subject to uncertainties. Speciﬁcally, we consider the transition
probability from mode i at time t to mode j at time t + δ, i,j ∈S to be:

(αij + Δαij)δ + o(δ),

Decentralized Control of Markovian Jump Systems
7.2 Mode-Dependent Decentralized Stability and Stabilization
7.2.1 Introduction
Problems of decentralized stability and stabilization of interconnected systems are
receiving considerable interests [13, 24, 26, 27, 52], where most of the effort are
focused on dealing with the interaction patterns. When the interconnected system
involves delays, related studies are reported in [23, 49–51]. In [23], the stability
and stabilization of interconnected systems are considered where uncertainties are
assumed to satisfy the matching conditions.
In this section, we consider a wide class of continuous-time, interconnected
jumping time-delay systems with mode-dependent interval delays. This class of sys-
tems has not been fully investigated in the literature. The importance of these sys-
tems stems from the fact it encompasses other numerous classes of interests [31].
In particular, we consider hereafter uncertain interconnected systems in which full
state-measurements are not available and the delays occur both within the subsys-
tems and in the interaction patterns. In the present work, the objective is to de-
sign decentralized linear feedback controllers based on state and dynamic-output
schemes to guarantee the robust stabilization and robust H∞performance. Since
Lyapunov theory is the main vehicle in stability analysis, the resulting conditions
are only sufﬁcient. In our work, we construct an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii
functional and introduce some parameters as manipulative factors to reduce the de-
gree of conservativeness. The main contributions of this chapter are the constructive
use of linear matrix inequalities as a vehicle to solve both the mode-dependent de-
centralized stochastic stability and stabilization problems with H∞performance.
7.2.2 Problem Statement
Given a probability space (Ω,F,P) where Ω is the sample space, F is the alge-
bra of events and P is the probability measure deﬁned on F. Let the random form
process {ηt,t ∈[0,T ]} be a homogeneous, ﬁnite-state Markovian process with right
continuous trajectories and taking values in a ﬁnite set S = {1,2,...,s} with gen-
erator ℑ=

Mode-Dependent Decentralized Stability and Stabilization

We consider a class S of nonlinear time-delay systems with Markovian jump
parameters and bounded-uncertainties composed of ns coupled subsystems Sj de-
scribed over the space (Ω,F,P) by:
Sj:

xj(t) = κj(t),
t ∈[τMj,0],
(7.74)
where j ∈{1,...,ns}, xj(t) ∈ℜnj is the state vector uj(t) ∈ℜmj is the con-
trol input wj(t) ∈ℜqj is the disturbance input yj(t) ∈ℜpj is the measured out-
put zj(t) ∈ℜrj is the controlled output and τj(ηt) are unknown mode-dependent
time-delays within known ranges in order to guarantee smooth growth of the
state trajectories. The time-varying delay τj(ηt) is unknown mode-dependent and
satisﬁes τmj ≤τj(ηt) ≤τMj with the bounds τmj, τMj being known for every
j ∈{1,...,ns}. The initial condition is κj(.) ∈L2[−τMj,0], j ∈{1,...,ns}. The
function gj : Z+ ×ℜn ×ℜn →ℜnj is a piecewise-continuous mode-dependent vec-
tor function in its arguments and represents the interaction of other subsystems to
subsystem j. In this chapter, it is assumed that gj satisﬁes the quadratic inequality

7.2.3 Local Subsystem Stability
In the sequel, we introduce
τaj = 1
2(τMj + τmj),
δj = 1
2(τMj −τmj) = τMj −τaj = τaj −τmj.
Remark 7.8 It is readily evident that the case δj = 0 leads to τMj = τmj which
corresponds to constant delay. The case τmj = 0 yields δj = τaj = 1
2τMj.
Theorem 7.7 Given the delay bounds τmj, τMj. If there exist positive-deﬁnite matri-
ces Pj(i),Qj(i), Rj, Zj, Wj, Xj and scalars γj > 0, εj(i) > 0, λj(i) > 0, i ∈S
satisfying

7.2.4 H∞State-Feedback Synthesis
The problem of H∞state-feedback control could be phrased as follows: Given sub-
system (7.78), determine a local state-feedback control law
uj(t) = Kj(ηt)xj(t),
ηt = i ∈S
(7.96)
which guarantees that H∞performance measure is bounded by γj for all w(t) ∈
L2[0,∞].
Applying the controller (7.96) to system (7.72), we obtain the closed-loop sub-
system
Sn
j :
˙xj(t) = Asj(i)xj(t) + Eoj(i)xj(t −τj(i)) + Γj(i)wj(t) + gj(i),
zj(t) = Goj(i)xj(t) + Loj(i)xj(t −τj(i)) + Ψj(i)wj(t).
(7.97)
Asj(i) = Aj + Boj(i)Kj(i).
Extending on Theorem 7.7, the main design result is summarized by the following
theorem.
Theorem 7.8 Given the delay bounds τmj, τMj. If there exist positive-deﬁnite ma-
trices Yj(i), Gj(i), Λ1j(i), Λ2j(i), Λ3j(i), Λ4j(i), Λ5j(i) and scalars γj > 0,

7.3 H∞Control by Averaging and Aggregation
In this section, we follow a different route to provide a complete study of the H∞
optimal control problem for linear interconnected systems with Markovian jump
parameters. We consider that the form process admits strong and weak interactions.
Under perfect state measurements, for both ﬁnite and inﬁnite horizon cases, we pro-
ceed to construct an aggregate jump linear system from the original jump linear sys-
tem, which has a considerably smaller state space for the Markov chain process and

404
7
Decentralized Control of Markovian Jump Systems
eventually is independent of the singular perturbation parameter ε > 0. Taking into
account the nature of this smaller order aggregate jump linear system, a threshold
level ¯γ will be deﬁned, which is shown to constitute an upper bound for the optimal
performance level of the overall system, γ ∗(ε), as the parameter ε approaches 0.
In particular, this bound is shown to be exact in the inﬁnite horizon case. In both
cases, an approximate controller is constructed from the solution to the aggregate
problem that can achieve any desired level of performance for the full-order system
for sufﬁciently small values of ε.
7.3.1 Introduction
In control theory, systems subject to frequent unpredictable structural changes can
be adequately modeled as piecewise deterministic systems, where the system dy-
namics take on different forms depending on the value of an associated Markov
chain process, which is known as form or indicant process associated with the con-
trolled system. In the linear case, these systems are also known as jump linear sys-
tems. Such a system model is useful particularly since it allows the decision maker
to cope adequately with the discrete events that disrupt and/or change signiﬁcantly
the normal operation of a system by using the knowledge of their occurrence and
the statistical information on the rate at which these events take place. Research into
this class of systems and their applications into manufacturing management span
several decades, with some representative books and papers in this area being [1, 6,
10–12, 14, 18, 20, 21, 55–58].
Research into the control of piecewise-deterministic systems in the presence of
unknown (continuous) disturbances has been initiated, in [53] and [8] for jump lin-
ear systems, and in [4] for nonlinear systems. This is the paradigm of H∞opti-
mal control [2, 9, 60], where there is an additional (discrete) element, which is
the stochastic (piecewise constant) Markov process disturbance, that causes struc-
tural changes. A complete set of solutions for this class of problems, under perfect
state and imperfect state measurements, and in both ﬁnite and inﬁnite horizon cases
has been presented in [53] based on properties of zero-sum differential games with
piecewise deterministic dynamics [3]. This hybrid H∞control formulation, like its
deterministic counterpart, leads to design of a robust controller which, by the small
gain theorem, stabilizes a class of systems centered around the nominal system. It
is particularly useful for systems whose parameters are either difﬁcult to identify, or
even simply time-varying within a signiﬁcant bounded set. Compared with a single
robust controller design intended to stabilize the overall jump linear system, this
approach removes unnecessary conservatism by utilizing the statistical information
about the disrupting discrete events. It is noted that a limited version of this problem
was studied in the perfect state measurements case in [8].
In real applications, a formulation of the foregoing type eventually leads to a very
high dimensional state for the Markov chain, which makes it computationally infea-
sible or extremely sensitive to small inaccuracies. One way of coping with (and alle-
viating) this difﬁculty, would be to group different Markov chain states into several

7.3
H∞Control by Averaging and Aggregation
405
separate sets, based on some temporal decomposition, and deﬁne a new (approxi-
mate) problem on these individual sets. More precisely, we consider the situation
where the form process exhibits a two-time-scale behavior, thus admitting strong
and weak interactions among its states, with the separation quantiﬁed in terms of a
(small) singular perturbation parameter, ε > 0. Modeling of such Markov chain pro-
cesses as well as their optimal control was conducted earlier by [7, 54], upon which
the material of this section is built around. The derivation hereafter is based on aver-
aging and essentially leads to an aggregate jump linear system. In effect, this system
has a considerably smaller state space for its form process and is also independent
of ε > 0. Using this smaller-order aggregate jump linear system, a threshold level is
deﬁned which asymptotically upper bounds the achievable performance level of the
overall system as the parameter ε decreases to 0.
7.3.2 Problem Formulation
The class of jump linear systems under consideration is described by:
˙x = A(θ(t))x + B(θ(t))u + D(θ(t))w;
x(0) = x0,
(7.112)
where x ∈ℜn is the system state vector; u ∈ℜp is the control input; w ∈ℜq is the
disturbance input; θ(t) is a ﬁnite-state Markov process deﬁned on the state space
S = {1,...,σ} with the inﬁnitesimal generator matrix
Λ = (λij)σ×σ
and an initial distribution π: = [π01,...,π0σ]. The underlying probability space is
the triple (Ω,F,P). The initial condition x0 is available to the controller, but it is
not ﬁxed a priori and is determined as part of the disturbance policy. In what follows,
θ(t) deﬁnes the so-called form or indicant process, which determines the form of
the system at time t. The system state x, inputs u and w, each belong to appropriate
L2-Hilbert spaces Hx,Hu and Hw respectively, deﬁned on the time interval [0,∞].
Let E denote the expectation with respect to the underlying probability space.
When the form process is large-scale, it is quite natural to think of the large num-
ber of states to be grouped into different collections of states, based on whether
the interaction between any two states is weak or strong. Occurrence of such a
phenomenon is expressed mathematically by taking the probability transition rate
matrix Λ in an appropriate singularly perturbed form [7, 54]:
Λ = Λs + (1/ε)Λf ,
(7.113)
where Λs := (λ(s)
ij )σ×σ , and Λf := (λ(f )
ij )σ×σ are probability transition rate matri-
ces corresponding to, respectively, weak interactions and strong interactions within
the form process. The scalar ε is a small positive number, whose inverse provides
a measure of the order separation between the weak and strong interactions. The

406

states of the form process can always be properly arranged so that the generator
matrix Λf takes the following structure:
Λf =

From now onwards, each recurrent set and their associated form systems will be

and measurable in θ, further satisfying the given causality condition. Let us denote
the class of all admissible controllers by M.

where δ0 : S →ℜn, and ν : Hx × Ω →Hw is piecewise continuous in t and Lip-
schitz continuous in x and measurable in θ, further satisfying the given causality
condition. Let us denote the class of all admissible disturbance policies δ by D.
Following [3], we focus on the upper value of an associated zero-sum game,
where the disturbance is allowed to act after the controller policy has been selected,
the disturbance policy can in fact be restricted (without any loss of generality) to
one that only depends on state history of the form process, θ[0,t], but not on the state
trajectory of the continuous system, x[0,t]. Observe that the causal dependence of the
disturbance on the form process is a crucial assumption, which cannot be dispensed
with.
We adopt for this system the inﬁnite-horizon quadratic performance index:

Q(·) ≥0,
(7.119)
in which context the H∞optimal control problem is to ﬁnd the inﬁmum over all
admissible controllers (belonging to M) of the following “squared” worst-case L2
gain:
J(μ,δ) := sup
δ∈D
L(μ,δ)
E{
 ∞
0 |w(t)|2dt + |x0|2
Q0(θ(0))}.
Let us denote the optimal performance level by γ ∗(ε), that is:

(E{

(7.120)
The objective of the controller design is then to ﬁnd control policies that guarantee
a performance level within a given neighborhood of the optimal one.
This H∞optimal control problem is known to be closely related to a class of
zero-sum differential games for the jump linear system (7.112), with the following
γ -parametrized cost function:
Jγ (μ,δ) = L(μ,δ) −γ 2E

where the control μ is the minimizer and the disturbance δ is the maximizer [53].
The threshold γ ∗(ε) is then the “smallest” value of γ > 0 such that the above game
admits a ﬁnite upper value, which is necessarily zero.
Remark 7.9 It is signiﬁcant to note that for each ﬁxed ε > 0, the complete solu-
tion to the above stochastic H∞control problem has been obtained in [53], the
computation of the quantity γ ∗(ε) and that of a corresponding H∞-optimal or sub-
optimal controller for small values of ε presents serious difﬁculties due to numerical
ill-conditioning and high dimensionality. To remedy this, an averaging and aggre-
gation technique is proposed, following the results of [7, 54], which leads to an

408

Decentralized Control of Markovian Jump Systems
aggregated jump linear system that is independent of ε > 0. The solution to the H ∞
control problem for the aggregated jump linear system will then be used to construct
near-optimal solutions to the original stochastic H ∞control problem.
To proceed with the study, three basic assumptions are recalled and are quite
natural in the present context.
Assumption 7.3 Matrix functions Q0(i) are positive deﬁnite for all i ∈S.
Assumption 7.4 The initial probability distribution of the form process satisﬁes
πoi > 0 for all i ∈S.
Assumption 7.5 The pairs (A(i),Q(i)) are observable for each i ∈S.
Remark 7.10 Assumption 7.3 guarantees a strictly concave cost term for the initial
state of the form system, which is to be selected by the disturbance. Assumption 7.4
then says that any state of the form process has a positive probability of being visited
at any time t ∈[0,∞). Depending on whether the form process is recurrent or not,
the probability of visiting some states may diminish to zero as t →∞.
Remark 7.11 Looking at the solution to the full-order problem in the inﬁnite-
horizon case, for a ﬁxed ε > 0, we let the pair (A(θ),B(θ)) be stochastically sta-
bilizable and Assumptions 7.3–7.5 hold. In view of the results of [53], the opti-
mal performance level γ ∗(ε) for the full-order problem is ﬁnite. For every γ larger
than this quantity, the associated zero-sum differential game has a zero upper value.
A control policy that guarantees this zero upper value, which is then a control policy
that guarantees an H ∞performance level of γ , is given by
μ∗
γ (x(t),θ(t)) = −B′(θ(t)) ¯Z(θ(t);ε)x(t),
(7.122)
where Z(i;ε), i = 1,...,σ are positive-deﬁnite solutions to the following set of
coupled generalized algebraic Riccati inequalities (GARI’s):
A′(i) ¯Z(i) + ¯Z(i)A(i) −¯Z(i)(B(i)B′(i)(1/γ 2)D(i)D′(i)) ¯Z(i) + Q(i)
+
σ

j=1
λij ¯Z(j) ≤0;
i = 1,...,σ.
(7.123)
Furthermore, these solutions satisfy the spectral radius condition:
¯Z(i;ε) < γ 2Q0(i);
i = 1,...,σ.
(7.124)
On the other hand, for any γ less than the threshold γ ∗(ε), either the set of coupled
GARI’s (7.123) does not admit any nonnegative deﬁnite solutions, and in particular,
the following set of coupled generalized algebraic Riccati equations (GARE’s) does

7.3

409
not admit any nonnegative deﬁnite solutions:
A′(i)Z(i) + Z(i)A(i) −Z(i)(B(i)B′(i) −(1/γ 2)D(i)D′(i))Z(i) + Q(i)

λijZ(j) ≤0;
i = 1,...,σ,
(7.125)
or the solution to the above sets of coupled GARI’s and GARE’s do not satisfy the
spectral radius condition (7.124). Hence, for these values of γ , the upper value of
the associated zero-sum differential game is inﬁnity.
Now turning attention to the ﬁnite-horizon time-varying problem, we take the
time interval of interest to be [0,tf ], and the system matrices A, B, D, Q, Λs,
Λf to be possibly time dependent, in addition to them being dependent on the form
process θ(t). The cost function associated with this system, (7.119), is then replaced
by the following ﬁnite-horizon quadratic function:
L(μ,δ) = E
 tf
0
(|x(t)|2
Q(t,θ(t)) + |u(t)|2)dt + |x(tf )|2
Qf (θ(tf ))

,
Q(.,.) ≥0,
Qf (·) ≥0.
(7.126)
The H∞optimal control problem is again the minimization of the worst-case L2
gain, for which the optimal performance level is again denoted by γ ∗(ε) as deﬁned
in (7.120), with L replaced by its expression given by (7.126) above.
By similarity to the inﬁnite-horizon case, this ﬁnite-horizon H∞control prob-
lem is closely related to a class of zero-sum differential game problems indexed by
γ > 0, with the game kernel deﬁned as in (7.121), where the function L(μ,δ) is
as deﬁned in (7.126), and with the norm on w now deﬁned on [0,tf ]. The optimal
performance level γ ∗(ε) is again the “smallest” value of γ such that the associ-
ated zero-sum differential game admits a ﬁnite upper value, which is necessarily
zero.
In this case, in addition to Assumptions 7.3 and 7.4, we need the following
one:
Assumption 7.6 The matrices A(t,i), B(t,i), D(t,i), Q(t,i) are piecewise con-
tinuous in t, and the generator matrices Λs(t), Λf (t) are piecewise continuously
differentiable in t, for each i ∈S.
It follows from [53], under Assumptions 7.3, 7.4 and 7.6, for each ﬁxed ε > 0
and γ > γ ∗(ε), there exists a controller that guarantees the H∞performance level
γ for the full-order problem. The controller is then given by
μ∗
γ (t,x(t),θ(t)) = −B′(t,θ(t))Z(t,θ(t);ε)x(t),
(7.127)
where Z(t,i;ε), i = 1,...,σ are nonnegative deﬁnite solutions to the following set
of coupled generalized Riccati differential equations (GRDE’s):

σ

j=1
λijZ(t,j) = 0,
(7.128)
Z(tf ,i) = Qf (i),
i = 1,...,σ.
These solutions satisfy a spectral radius condition at time 0:
Z(0,i;ε) < γ 2Q0(i);
i = 1,...,σ.
(7.129)
For any γ less than the threshold γ ∗(ε), however, either the set of coupled GRDE’s
(7.128) has a conjugate point on the interval [0,tf ], or the spectral radius condition
(7.129) is violated. In either case, the upper value of the associated differential game
is unbounded.
For both the ﬁnite and inﬁnite horizon cases, we seek to use averaging and aggre-
gation techniques to obtain an ε-independent aggregate jump linear system, so as to
obtain ε-independent suboptimal controllers that guarantee any achievable perfor-
mance level for the full-order problem for sufﬁciently small values of ε.
7.3.3 Results in the Inﬁnite-Horizon Case
In this section, we study the problem formulated in the previous section in the
inﬁnite-horizon case, under the working Assumptions 7.3–7.5. The aggregation of
the form process with the transition rate matrix given as (7.113) has already been
studied extensively in [7, 54]. The aggregated Markov chain process, θA(t), of the
form process, θ(t), constitutes the form process of the aggregate jump linear system
and can be constructed as follows:
Let π(f i) be a σi-dimensional probability row vector that constitutes the in-
variant distribution corresponding to the probability transition rate matrix Λ(f i),
i = 1,..., ¯σ, that is,
π(f i)Λ(f i) = 01×σi;
π(f i)1σi×1 = 1;
i = 1,..., ¯σ.
Deﬁne a (¯σ
i=1 σi)-dimensional row vector π(f ) by lining up all the π(f i)’s:
π(f ) :=

π(f 1) ... π(f ¯σ)
where the jth element of π(f ) is denoted by π(f )
j

matrix PT :

(7.130)
where each element P (T )
ij
is the conditional probability of ending up in the jth
recurrent set given that the process has started in ith state of the transient set. Thus,

7.3

the aggregated process θA takes values in the aggregate set:
SA := {1,..., ¯σ}.
The inﬁnitesimal generator for θA is given by
ΛA = (λ(A)
ij )¯σ×¯σ :=
⎡
⎢⎣
π(f 1)Λ(s11)1σ1×1

⎥⎦PT ,
(7.131)
where the ijth element of the ﬁrst matrix is the transition rate from ith recurrent set
to jth recurrent set directly, i ̸= j; and the ijth element of the second matrix is the
transition rate from ith recurrent set to jth recurrent set via the transient set, i ̸= j.
The initial distribution for the aggregated process θA is
πA0 =

l∈S1
π0l ...

l∈S¯σ
π0l

+ [π0σ−σt+1 ... π0σ ]PT ,
(7.132)
where the ith element of the ﬁrst vector is the probability of the process θ starting
in the ith recurrent set; and the ith element of the second vector is the probability
of the process θ to start in the transient set and land in the ith recurrent set the ﬁrst
instant θ leaves the transient set.
The underlying probability space for this aggregate Markov chain is denoted by
the triple (ΩA,FA,PA), and the expectation under this probability space by EA.
To arrive at the form systems associated with each state of the aggregated Markov
chain, we now make the following observation. As ε approaches zero, jumps of the
form process within any recurrent set occur at much higher frequency than any of
the time constants of any individual form system. Thus, within a short time interval
of length O(√ε), the form process may visit every state within a recurrent set many
times while the state of the form system moves a very short distance. The average
time spent in the states among a recurrent group is proportional with the corre-
sponding elements of the invariant distribution π(f ). Thus, it should be intuitively
expected that the value function for the zero-sum differential game, if it exists, is
asymptotically identical on every recurrent set as ε →0. By formally setting ε = 0,
the solution to the set of coupled GARI’s (2.18) are such that
Z(j1) = Z(j2);
for all j1,j2 ∈Si, i = 1,..., ¯σ.
We will prove shortly that this is indeed the case as ε →0. Given this structure of the
solution to the GARI’s (7.123), the corresponding control policy and the worst-case
disturbance input will be of the form
M(θ(t))Z(θ(t))x(t),

412
7
Decentralized Control of Markovian Jump Systems
where M(·) is a matrix function of appropriate dimensions that is generally different
for each value of the form process.
The above observation leads to the following form of the aggregated system:
˙xA = AA(θA(t))xA + BA(θA(t))uA + DA(θA(t))wA;
xA(0) = x0,
(7.133)
where
AA(i) :=

DA(i) :=

l∈Si
π(f )
l
D(l)D′(l)
!−1/2
;
i = 1,..., ¯σ.
(7.136)
The form of averaging for the matrices BA and DA is also intuitive from the fact
that the control and the disturbance policies are generally switching policies whose
second moments are penalized in the cost function. A direct consequence of this
formulation is that the inputs into the aggregate system do not in general correspond
to those for the original system. The control input and the disturbance input are
generated by the following causal mappings:
uA(t) = μA(t,xA[0,t],θA[0,t]),
(7.137)
(x0,wA(t)) = (δA0(θA(0)),νA(t,xA[0,t],θA[0,t])).
(7.138)
The general cost function associated with this system is deﬁned to be:
JAγ (μA,δA)

(x′

AuA −γ 2w′

H∞Control by Averaging and Aggregation
413
Remark 7.12 The aggregate problem above provides a fairly good approximation
to the original full-order problem for t > 0. At the initial time t = 0, however, there
is an information loss for the disturbance through the aggregation process since
the disturbance can choose the initial state x0 depending only on θA(0), and not
on θ(0). Thus, the spectral radius condition associated with the aggregate problem
is not directly relevant to the solution of the original problem except in some special
cases, as it will be shown in the sequel.
For this reduced, average H∞control problem, we introduce two regularity con-
ditions:
Assumption 7.7 The pair (AA(θA),BA(θA)) is stochastically stabilizable.
Assumption 7.8 The pair (AA(i),QA(i)) are observable for each i ∈SA.
A related set of coupled GARE’s is also introduced:
A′
A(i)ZA(i) + ZA(i)AA(i) −ZA(i)(BA(i)B′
A(i) −(1/γ 2)DA(i)D′
A(i))ZA(i)

j=1
λ(A)
ij ZA(j) = 0;
i = 1,..., ¯σ.
(7.142)
By the results of [53], the optimal performance level for the aggregate H∞control
problem is given by the following inﬁmum:
γ ∗
A := inf{γ > 0 : There exists a set of nonnegative deﬁnite solutions ZA(i),
i ∈SA, to the set of coupled GARE’s (7.142), such that
ZA(i) < γ 2QA0(i) for all i ∈SA}.
This threshold level is ﬁnite under the working Assumption 7.7.
Next we introduce a set of spectral radius conditions:
ZA(i) < γ 2Q0(j);
∀j ∈Si, i = 1,..., ¯σ,
(7.143)
¯σ

i=1
P (T )

ZA(i) < γ 2Q0(l);
∀l ∈St, ˜l = l −σ + σt.

Deﬁne the quantity ¯γ > 0:
¯γ := inf{γ > 0 : There exists a set of nonnegative deﬁnite solutions ZA(i),
i ∈SA, to the set of coupled GARE’s (7.142) that further satisﬁes
the set of spectral radius conditions (7.143)–(7.144)}.
(7.145)
This quantity will be shown to be the asymptotic limit of γ ∗(ε) as ε →0. Under
Assumption 7.7, ¯γ is ﬁnite.

414

In this special case, the optimal performance level for the aggregate problem is the
asymptotic limit of the optimal performance level for the full-order system as ε →0.
For every γ > ¯γ , under Assumptions 7.7 and 7.8, it can be shown, by following
lines of reasoning similar to that of [53], that there exists a set of positive deﬁnite
solutions ¯ZA(i), i ∈SA to the following set of coupled GARI’s:
A′
A(i) ¯ZA(i) + ¯ZA(i)AA(i) −¯ZA(i)(BA(i)B′

which also satisfy the spectral radius conditions (2.37). Furthermore, the following
jump linear system is mean-square stable:
˙x = (AA(θA) −(BA(θA)B′
A(θA) −(1/γ 2)DA(θA)D′
A(θA)) ¯ZA(θA))x
=: AFA(θA)x.
(7.147)
Let us deﬁne ΔA(i) to be the residue to the set of coupled GARI’s (7.146):
ΔA(i) := −A′

In terms of the matrices ¯ZA(i), i ∈SA, the following approximate control policy is
introduced for the full-order system:
μ∗
a(t,x(t),θ(t)) =

−B′(i) ¯ZA(j)x(t);
θ(t) = i ∈Sj,
K(i)x(t);
θ(t) = i ∈St,
(7.148)
where the p-by-n dimensional matrix function K(·) can be ﬁxed arbitrarily, and
its speciﬁc choice does not affect the overall performance of the full-order prob-
lem.
Now in order to relate the solution of the set of coupled GARI’s (7.123) for
the full-order problem to the solution of (7.146) for the aggregate problem, let us

Obviously, the matrices ¯Za(i) correspond to the quadratic kernel for the average
value function for the ith recurrent group; the matrices ¯Zd(l), l ∈Si for some i ∈SA,
then correspond to the quadratic kernel for the O(ε) deviation between the value
function associated with the form process state l and the average value function of
the recurrent group where the state l lies in. For any state l within the transient set
St, the quadratic kernel of the value function at ε = 0 will be shown shortly to be

i=1 P (T )
˜li
¯Za(i). Thus, the matrix ¯Zd(l) corresponds to the quadratic kernel for the
O(ε) deviation from this asymptotic value.
An independent parametrization can be formed by using a subset of the above

Proof It is well known that the matrix Λ has one and only one zero eigenvalue, and
its remaining eigenvalues are in the open left half of the complex plane. Deﬁne a

It is easy to verify that

where ∗denotes some constant matrix. This implies that the eigenvalues of ¯Λ are
precisely the eigenvalues of Λ except the zero eigenvalue. Hence, the lemma is
proven.

Using the solution to the aggregate GARI’s (7.146), we now attempt to solve the
full-order GARI’s (7.123) in the following special case:

where the terms ηa’s and ηd’s are bounded and analytic functions of the parametriza-
tion (7.152). The ﬁrst set above, that is (7.157), is obtained by taking the weighted
average of each recurrent group of GARE’s (7.155)–(7.156) with respect to the
invariant distribution for that recurrent group. The second and third sets, (7.158)
and (7.159), are obtained by direct substitution of relationships (7.150), (7.151) and
(7.153) into the corresponding equations of (7.155)–(7.156).
The following theorem establishes that ¯γ as the asymptotic limit of γ ∗(ε) and
the suboptimality of the control policy μ∗
a, given by (7.148).
Theorem 7.10 Consider the inﬁnite-horizon H ∞control problem for jump lin-
ear system (7.112), (7.121) formulated in Sect. 7.3.2. Let Assumptions 7.3–7.5, 7.7
and 7.8 hold. Then,
1. The optimal performance level γ ∗(ε) asymptotically converges to ¯γ as ε →0+,
that is,
lim
ε→0+ γ ∗(ε) = ¯γ ,
where the quantity ¯γ deﬁned by (7.145) is ﬁnite.
2. For each γ > ¯γ , there exists an εγ > 0 such that the set of coupled GARI’s
(2.18) admits a set of positive deﬁnite solutions for ε ∈(0,εγ ], which can further
be approximated by
¯Z(l;ε) = ¯ZA(i) + O(ε);
l ∈Si, i = 1,..., ¯σ,

l ∈St, ˜l = l −σ + σb,
(7.161)
where ¯ZA(i), i = 1,..., ¯σ are solutions to the set of coupled GARI’s (7.146).
3. For each γ > ¯γ , there exists an ˜εγ > 0 such that the approximate controller, μ∗
a,
achieves the performance level γ for the full-order system, for ε ∈(0, ˜εγ ].
Proof Under the working Assumptions 7.7 and 7.8, the quantity ¯γ is ﬁnite by results
of [53]. Now ﬁx any γ > ¯γ . At ε = 0, the set of coupled GARE’s (7.157)–(7.158)

admit a triangular structure such that a set of solutions can be obtained as follows.
First, the matrices Za(i),i ∈SA can be solved from the set of coupled GARE’s
(7.157) independently of the rest of the equations as
¯Za(i) = ¯ZA(i);
i = 1,..., ¯σ.
(7.162)
Then, the matrices ¯Zd(l), l ∈Si{i
j=1 σj}, i ∈SA, can be solved from the set of
coupled GARE’s (7.158) by the fact that the matrices ¯Λ(f i), i ∈SA are Hurwitz.
Let us denote these solutions by
¯Zd(l) = ¯Zd0(l);
l ∈Si

(7.163)
Last, the matrices ¯Zd(l), l ∈St, can be solved from the set of coupled GARE’s
(7.159) by the fact that the matrix Λ(f t) is Hurwitz. Let us denote the solutions here
by
¯Zd(l) = ¯Zd0(l);
l ∈St.
(7.164)
For any symmetric matrix M, let vec(M) denote the vector whose elements are
the lower triangular elements of M. In simple mathematical terms:
vec(M) :=

In terms of this notation, we can view the set of coupled GARE’s (7.157)–(7.159)
as a multidimensional nonlinear algebraic equation:
χ(ε,ξ) = 0,
where

This equation admits a solution at ε = 0, which is denoted by ξ0.
It is easy to see that the Jacobian of χ with respect to ξ at (0,ξ0) is:

,
where the operator ⊗denotes the Kronecker product, ∗denotes any constant
matrix term not of any relevance to the analysis to follow, and the matrix
F(AAF (1),...,AAF(¯σ),ΛA) is the Jacobian matrix of the left-hand-side (LHS)
of (7.146) with respect to

vec( ¯Za(1))′ ... vec( ¯Za(¯σ))′′,
evaluated at ¯Za(i) = ¯ZA(i), i ∈Si. By the mean-square stability of the sys-
tem (7.147), this matrix is Hurwitz (see Lemma 7.5 of [53]). Hence, the Jacobian
matrix ∂χ
∂ξ (0,ξ) is Hurwitz.
This establishes the conditions for the application of a standard Implicit Function
Theorem, which then implies that the set of coupled GARE’s (7.157) admits a set
of solutions for sufﬁciently small ε > 0, which can be approximated by
¯Za(i) = ¯ZA(i) + O(ε);
i = 1,..., ¯σ,

i ∈SA,

Furthermore, we conclude that the set of coupled GARI’s (7.123) admits a set of
positive deﬁnite solutions, which can be approximated as (7.160). These matrices
satisfy the spectral radius condition (7.124) for sufﬁciently small ε > 0, since the
matrices ¯ZA(i), i ∈SA, satisfy the spectral radius condition (7.143)–(7.144). This
then establishes statement 2 of the theorem.
For statement 3, we ﬁrst substitute the control policy μ∗
a into the full-order sys-
tem (7.112), as well as the cost function (7.121), which results in a single-person
maximization problem with respect to the disturbance δ. For any ﬁxed γ > ¯γ , the

maximum value is zero if the following set of coupled GARE’s admits positive def-
inite solutions that further satisfy the spectral radius condition (7.124):

ℓ∈St.
Following a line of reasoning that is similar to that used in proving statement 2,
we can again apply the Implicit Function Theorem to show that the above holds
for ε ∈(0, ˜ε], for some ˜ε > 0. This then establishes statement 3 of the theorem.
Statements 2 and 3 together imply that ¯γ is no smaller than the limsup of the optimal
performance level γ ∗(ε) as ε →0+. In order to show statement 1, it is then sufﬁcient
to prove that the upper value of differential game with kernel Jγ , as deﬁned in
(7.121), is strictly larger than 0 for any γ < ¯γ . This proof is much easier to carry
out by utilizing the counterpart of this theorem in the ﬁnite horizon case; hence,
we relegate this part of the proof to Sect. 7.3.6. This completes the proof of this
theorem.
□
A byproduct of Theorem 7.10 and its proof, which would also be of independent
interest, is the result given in the following corollary to Theorem 7.10.
Corollary 7.1 The full-order jump linear system (7.112) is stochastically stabi-
lizable for sufﬁciently small ε > 0, if the aggregate jump linear system (7.133) is
stochastically stabilizable.
7.3.4 Results in the Finite Horizon Case
In what follows, we present the counterpart of the results in the previous section in
the ﬁnite horizon case. First, we deﬁne the aggregate Markov chain process θA(t)
with state space SA, whose probability transition rate matrix ΛA(t) is exactly as de-
ﬁned in (7.131), but is now time varying, where the probability vectors π(f i), i ∈SA
and the matrix PT are time dependent as well. The aggregate jump linear system is
then the same as (7.133), with the system matrices AA, BA and DA being possibly

time-dependent. The control input, initial state and the disturbance input are again
generated by the causal mapping (7.137)–(7.138). Motivated by the solution struc-
ture to the inﬁnite horizon case, we make the following assumption on the terminal
cost function:
Assumption 7.9 The terminal weighting matrices Qf (i), i ∈S are of the following
structure:
Qf (i) = QAf (j) + εQf d(i);
∀i ∈Sj, j = 1,..., ¯σ,
Qf (i) =
σ

j=1
P (T )
˜ij (tf )QAf (j);
∀i ∈St, ˜i = i −σ + σt,
where QAf (·) ≥0, and Qf d(·) are symmetric.
The ﬁnite-horizon cost function associated with this aggregate system is:



(7.167)
where QA and QA0 are as deﬁned in (7.140)–(7.141).
For this ﬁnite-horizon aggregate H ∞control problem, we introduce the set of
coupled GRDE’s:
˙ZA(t,i) + A′
A(t,i)ZA(t,i) + ZA(i)AA(t,i) −ZA(t,i)(BA(t,i)B′A(t,i)

The counterpart of the spectral radius condition (7.143)–(7.144) is:
ZA(0,i) < γ 2Q0(j);

∀l ∈St, ˜l = l −σ + σt.
(7.170)
The counterpart of (7.145), which we again denote by ¯γ , is deﬁned as:
¯γ := inf{γ > 0 : There exists a set of nonnegative deﬁnite solutions ZA(t,i),
i ∈SA, on the interval [0,tf ] to the set of coupled GRDE’s (7.168) that
further satisﬁes the set of spectral radius conditions (7.169)–(7.170)}.

Decentralized Control of Markovian Jump Systems
This quantity is different in general from the optimal performance level for the ag-
gregate problem. But, in the special case delineated in Remark 7.13, it is exactly the
H∞performance level of the aggregate problem.
For a ﬁxed γ > ¯γ , we introduce the approximate control policy for the full-order
system, which is the counterpart of (7.148)
μ∗
a(t,x(t),θ(t)) =

−B′(t,i)ZA(t,j)x(t);
θ(t) = i ∈Sj,
K(t,i)x(t);
θ(t) = i ∈St,
(7.172)
where the p-by-n dimensional matrix function K(.,.) can be ﬁxed arbitrarily, and its
speciﬁc selection does not affect the overall performance of the full-order problem.
By similarity to the inﬁnite horizon case, let us consider the following indepen-
dent reparametrization of the set of coupled GRDE’s (7.128):
Za(t,i) :=

limsup

where the quantity ¯γ deﬁned by (7.171) is ﬁnite.
2. For each γ > ¯γ , there exists an εγ > 0 such that set of coupled GRDE’s
(7.128) admits a set of nonnegative deﬁnite solutions on the interval [0,tf ] for
ε ∈(0,εγ ], which can be approximated by
Z(t,l;ε) = ZA(t,i) + O(ε);

where ZA(t,i), i = 1,..., ¯σ are solutions to the set of coupled GRDE’s (7.168).
Furthermore, these matrices satisfy the spectral radius condition (7.129).
3. For each γ > ¯γ , there exists an ˜ε > 0 such that the approximate controller, μ∗
a,
deﬁned by (7.172), achieves the performance level γ for the full-order system,
for ε ∈(0, ˜εγ ].
Proof The quantity γ is ﬁnite since at γ = ∞, the solution to GRDE’s (7.128) is
always bounded on any ﬁnite interval. Now ﬁx any γ > ¯γ , and set ε = 0. The set of
coupled GRDE’s (7.176)–(7.178) again admits a triangular structure such that a set
of solutions can be obtained as described below. First, the matrix functions Za(t,i),

Then, the matrix functions Zd(t,l), l ∈Si{i
j=1 σj} and i ∈SA can be solved from
the set of coupled GARE’s (7.176)–(7.178) by the fact that the matrices ¯Λ(f i)(t),i ∈
SA, are Hurwitz for each ﬁxed t ∈[0,tf ]. Last, the matrix functions Zd(t,l), l ∈St,
can be solved from the set of coupled GARE’s (7.176)–(7.178) by the fact that the
matrix Λ(f t)(t) is Hurwitz for each ﬁxed t ∈[0,tf ].
The Jacobian matrix of the LHS of (7.176)–(7.178) with respect to ξ(f ) evaluated

Obviously, this Jacobian matrix is Hurwitz for any t ∈[0,tf ]. This sets up the con-
ditions for the application of the Implicit Function Theorem [19], which then im-
plies that the set of coupled GRDE’s (7.176)–(7.178) admits a set of solutions on
[0,tf ] for sufﬁciently small ε > 0. Furthermore, we conclude that the set of coupled
GRDE’s (7.128) admits a set of nonnegative deﬁnite solutions on [0,tf ], which can
be approximated as (7.183)–(7.184). These matrices satisfy the spectral radius con-
dition (7.129) for sufﬁciently small ε > 0, since the matrices ZA(0,i), i ∈SA, sat-
isfy the spectral radius condition (7.169)–(7.170). This then establishes statement 2
of the theorem.
For statement 3, we ﬁrst substitute the control policy μ∗
a into the full-order sys-
tem (7.112), as well as the cost function (7.121), which results in a single-person
maximization problem with respect to the disturbance δ. A similar application of
the Implicit Function Theorem then establishes the result. Statements 2 and 3 to-
gether imply statement 1. This completes the proof of the theorem.

The inﬁnitesimal generator of the Markov chain is of the standard singularly per-
turbed form:
Λ = λs + (1/ε)λf ,
where

Thus the state space S of the form process can be decomposed into two recurrent
sets: S1 := {1,2} and S2 := {3,4}, and a transient set: St := {5}.
Using a particular search algorithm, we can compute the optimal performance
level γ ∗(ε) for different values of ε > 0, which are listed in Table 7.1. As ε →0+,
we observe that the complexity of the computation increases from 14 million ﬂops
in the case of ε = 0.1 to 744 million ﬂops in the case of ε = 0.001. The aggregate
form process takes values in the set SA := {1,2}. The parameter matrices of the

Again using a particular search algorithm, we can compute the threshold level ¯γ to
be
¯γ = 3.630,
where the computational complexity is 0.893 million ﬂops. For this problem, the
speciﬁcation of the initial cost term falls into the special case described in Re-
mark 7.13. Hence, the quantity ¯γ is actually equal to the H ∞optimal performance
level for the aggregate problem. Subsequently, we conclude that the optimal perfor-
mance γ ∗(ε) for the full-order system converges to the optimal performance for the
aggregate problem as ε →0+, which corroborates the results of Theorem 7.10 and
the observation made in Remark 7.13.
Selecting a desired performance level γ = 3.65, we can compute the positive-
deﬁnite solutions to the set of coupled GARI’s for the aggregate problem, which are
given as
Z1 =
16.71
6.627
6.627
3.996

;
Z1 =
4.719
3.162

.
The approximate controller that asymptotically guarantees the performance level
3.65 is given by
μ∗
a(x(t),θ(t)) =
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
[−6.627 −3.996]x(t);
θ(t) = 1,
[−10.08 −2.632]x(t);
θ(t) = 2,

θ(t) = 3,
[−4.719 −3.162]x(t);
θ(t) = 4,
0;
θ(t) = 5.
The performance levels achieved by this controller, when applied to the full-order
system with different values of ε, are listed in Table 7.2. We see that as ε decreases
to zero, this approximate controller achieves the desired performance level 3.65 for
the overall system.
This example clearly illustrates the effectiveness of the aggregation and aver-
aging design procedure. For the ε = 0.001case, this procedure effectively reduces

ity.
7.3.6 Appendix
In this appendix, we continue with the proof of Theorem 7.10, and complete the
veriﬁcation of the fact that ¯γ is asymptotically less than or equal to the optimal
performance of the full-order system. Let us ﬁx a γ < ¯γ . Then, either (a) the set
of coupled GARE’s (2.36) does not admit any nonnegative deﬁnite solutions; or (b)
the set of coupled GARE’s (2.36) admits a set of minimal positive deﬁnite solutions
ZA(i), i ∈SA, but the set of spectral radius conditions (7.143)–(7.144) is violated.
In either of these two cases, we can ﬁnd a t1 > 0 such that the following set of
coupled GRDE’s:
˙ZA(t,i;t1) + A′
A(i)ZA(t,i;t1) + ZA(t,i;t1)AA(i) −ZA(t,i;t1)(BA(i)B′A(i)


j=1
λ(A)
ij (t)ZA(t,j;t1) = 0;
ZA(t1,i;t1) = 0n×n,
i = 1,..., ¯σ
admits a set of nonnegative deﬁnite solutions ZA(t,i;t1), i ∈SA, on [0,t1] and the
spectral radius condition (7.169)–(7.170) is violated. Since γ is strictly less than
¯γ , we can choose t1 such that, either a matrix γ 2Q0(j0) −ZA(0,i0;t1), for some
j0 ∈Si0 and some i0 ∈SA; or a matrix γ 2Q0(j0) −¯σ
i=1 P (T )
˜j0i (0)ZA(0,i;t1), for
some j0 ∈St and ˜j0 = j0 −σ + σt, has at least one negative eigenvalue. Then, by
an application of the Implicit Function Theorem, as in the proof of Theorem 2.2, it
can be shown that the following set of coupled GRDE’s admits a set of nonnegative
deﬁnite solutions on [0,t1] for sufﬁciently small ε > 0:
˙Z(t,i;t1) + A′(i)Z(t,i;t1) + Z(t,i;t1)A(i) −Z(t,i;t1)(B(i)B′(i)

λijZ(t,j;t1) = 0;
Z(t1,i;t1) = 0n×n,
i = 1,..., ¯σ.
Furthermore, there exists an i0 ∈S such that the matrix γ 2Q0(i0) −Z(0,i0;t1)
has at least one negative eigenvalue for sufﬁciently small values of ε. Let ¯x0 be

7.4

the nonzero vector associated with this negative eigenvalue. Introduce a particular
disturbance policy ¯δ = (¯δ0, ¯ν) given by
x0 = ¯δ(θ(0)) =

0n×1;
θ(0) ∈S{i0},
¯x0;
θ(0) = i0,

0n×1;
t ∈(t1,∞),
−B′(θ(t))Z(t,θ(t);t1)x(t);
t ∈[0,t1].
Finally, note the following series of inequalities:

γ 2Q0(i0)−Z(0,i0;t1) > 0.
This implies that the upper value of the game is strictly positive. Hence, γ < γ ∗(ε)
for sufﬁciently small values of ε. This completes the proof of Theorem 7.10.
7.4 Notes and References
In this chapter, we have investigated the problems of mode-dependent decentralized
stochastic stability and stabilization with H∞performance for a class of continuous-
time interconnected jumping time-delay systems. The jumping parameters are gov-
erned by a ﬁnite state Markov process and the delays are unknown time-varying
and mode-dependent within interval. The interactions among subsystems satisfy
quadratic bounding constraints. We have established mode-dependent local stability
behavior by employing an improved Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional at the sub-
system level and express the stability conditions in terms of linear matrix inequal-
ities (LMIs). We have developed a class of local decentralized state-feedback and
a class of dynamic observer-based controllers to render the closed-loop intercon-
nected jumping system stochastically stable.
Next we looked at deterministic systems with slow-fast Mark chains and devel-
oped decentralized polices based on averaging and aggregation. Results presented
here could be extended in several directions. The ﬁrst, conceptually simple exten-
sion would be to go from a single singular perturbation parameter (as in this chap-
ter) to multiple parameters, representing multiple temporal decompositions. Though
conceptually easy, this extension requires cumbersome notation for a precise de-
scription of the underlying decomposition, which we have therefore refrained from

doing in this chapter. Another parallel study would be the investigation of time-
scale decomposition for jump linear systems whose form systems (and not the form
process) exhibit a two-time-scale behavior. A more challenging problem would be
the one where both the form process and the form systems are singularly perturbed.
This is a topic that is currently under study.

Decentralized Adaptive Control
Decentralized adaptive control design for a class of large-scale interconnected non-
linear systems with unknown interconnections is considered in the sequel. The mo-
tivation behind this work is to develop decentralized control for a class of large-
scale systems which do not satisfy the matching condition requirement. To this
end, large-scale nonlinear systems transformable to the decentralized strict feedback
form are considered. Coordinate-free geometric conditions under which any gen-
eral interconnected nonlinear system can be transformed to this form are obtained.
The interconnections are assumed to be bounded by polynomial-type nonlineari-
ties. However, the magnitudes of the nonlinearities are unknown. Global stability
and asymptotic regulation are established using classical Lyapunov techniques. The
controller is shown to maintain robustness for a wide class of systems obtained
by perturbations in the dynamics of the original system. Furthermore, appending
additional subsystems does not require controller redesign for the original sub-
systems. Finally, the scheme is extended to the model reference tracking problem
where global uniform boundedness of the tracking error to a compact set is estab-
lished.
A digital redesign of the analogue model-reference-based decentralized adap-
tive tracker is proposed for the sampled-data large scale system consisting of N
interconnected linear subsystems, so that the system output will follow any tra-
jectory speciﬁed at sampling instants. This may not be presented by the analytic
reference initially. It will be shown in the sequel that the proposed decentralized
controller induces a good robustness on the decoupling of the closed loop con-
trolled system. The adaptation of the analogue controller gain is derived by us-
ing the model-reference adaptive control theory based on Lyapunov’s method. In
this chapter, it is shown that using the sampled-data decentralized adaptive con-
trol system it is theoretically possible to asymptotically track the desired output
with a desired performance. It is assumed that all the controllers share their prior
information and the principal result is derived when they cooperate implicitly.
Based on the prediction-based digital redesign methodology, the optimal digital
redesigned tracker for the sampled-data decentralized adaptive control systems is
proposed.

Decentralized Adaptive Control
8.1 Introduction
The decentralized control schemes, different from the classic centralized informa-
tion structure, have been considered with signiﬁcant interests for the control of inter-
connected systems in recent years. The main objectives of decentralized control are
to ﬁnd some feedback laws for adapting the intersections from the other subsystems
where no state information is transferred. The advantage of decentralized control
design is to reduce the complexity and therefore allows the control implementation
to be more feasible.
In the last two decades, the decentralized stabilization of large-scale intercon-
nected systems has received considerable attention [5, 22]. But in the above-
mentioned studies the interconnected patterns are free of time delays. As we know,
time delays are frequently encountered in various engineerings and can be a cause of
instability [20]. There are instances where delays in the interconnections for many
physical systems must be included in the model to account for transmission or infor-
mation delays. However, few results on the decentralized stabilization of large-scale
interconnected systems with delays in the interconnection patterns have been re-
ported in the literature. In [23], the control problem of interconnected time-delay
systems is considered and the controller is designed based on the knowledge of
the uncertainties bounds. Further elaboration and extensions are found in [23, 24,
26]. The problem of decentralized adaptive control for nonlinear interconnected un-
certain systems with time-delays is important and challenging in both theory and
practice.
In this section, we will consider a class of time-varying nonlinear large-scale sys-
tems subject to multiple time-varying delays in the interconnections. The intercon-
nections satisfy the so-called matching condition, and the uncertainties are bounded
by nonlinear functions that are partly known. Adaptive state feedback control strat-
egy is proposed and controllers obtained are independent of time delays. Based on
Lyapunov stability theorem, it has been shown that the proposed controllers can
render the closed-loop system globally uniformly ultimately bounded stable. The
result is also applied to stabilize a class of interconnected time delay systems whose
nominal systems are linear. Finally, several examples are included to illustrate the
theoretic results developed in the sequel.
8.2 System Formulation
Consider the nonlinear time-varying composite system S with multiple delays in
interconnections deﬁned by N interconnected subsystems Si, i = 1,2,...,N:
Si:
˙xi = fi(xi,t) + gi(xi,t)ui
+
N

j=1
Hij(xi,xj,xi[t −dij(t)],xj[t −dij(t)],t),
(8.1)

8.2
System Formulation
435
where xi ∈ℜni and ui ∈ℜmi represent the state and control vectors, respectively,
of the subsystem Si, fi(xi,t) and gi(xi,t) are assumed to be known functions with
appropriate dimensions, Hij(xi,xj,xi[t −dij(t)],xj[t −dij(t)],t) is an uncertain
nonlinear interconnection, which indicates the interconnections among the current
states and the delayed states of system Si and Sj, while dij(t) is the bounded time-
varying delay and differentiable satisfying
0 ≤dij(t) ≤¯dij ≤∞,
˙dij(t) ≤d∗
ij < 1,
where ¯dij, d∗
ij are positive scalars, and the initial condition is given as follows
xi(t) = Ωi(t),
t ∈[t0 −¯dij,t0], i = 1,2,...,N,
(8.2)
where Ωi(t) is a continuous initial function. The following assumptions are imposed
on system (8.1).
Assumption 8.1 Interconnection Hij(xi,xj,xi[t −dij(t)],xj[t −dij(t)],t) satis-
ﬁes the so-called matching condition, that is,
Hij(xi,xj,xi[t −dij(t)],xj[t −dij(t)],t)
= gi(xi,t) ˜Hij(xi,xj,xi[t −dij(t)],xj[t −dij(t)],t),
where uncertain part ˜Hij(xi,xj,xi[t −dij(t)],xj[t −dij(t)],t) is bounded by

in which functions Uijs(·) and Wijl(·) are known, pij and qij are proper known
scalars, αijs and βijl are unknown scalars, and
αij = (αij1,αij2,...,αijpij )t,
Uij(·) = [Uij1(·),Uij2(·),...,Uijpij (·)]t,
(8.4)
βij = (βij1,βij2,...,βijqij )t,
Wij(·) = [Wij1(·),Wij2(·),...,Wijqij (·)]t.
Remark 8.1 The scalars pij,qij and functions Uijs(·),Wijl(·) are chosen according
to the structure of functions ˜Hij. In the existing literature investigating the decentral-
ized control problem of an interconnected system, matching conditions were often
assumed and many practical systems satisfy Assumption 8.1. In the matching parts
condition (8.3) is imposed, in which the interconnections Uij(·) and Wij(·) can be
nonlinear functions. In the existing papers investigating the time delay intercon-
nected systems, the interconnections are often assumed to be bounded by a known
or unknown ﬁrst-order polynomial. Therefore our assumption on the interconnec-
tions is less conservative.

Decentralized Adaptive Control
Assumption 8.2 There exist continuous function ki(xi), positive function Vi(xi,t)
and functions γi1, γi2, and γi3 of class κ (zero at zero, positive, and increasing) such
that for all xi and t, the following inequalities hold
(1)
γi1(∥xi∥) ≤Vi(xi,t)γi2(∥xi∥),
(2)
∂Vi(xi,t)
∂t
+ ∂Vi(xi,t)
∂xi
[fi(xi,t) −gi(xi,t)ki(xi)] ≤−γi3(∥xi∥).
(8.5)
Remark 8.2 Assumption 8.2 guarantees that the nominal subsystems of system (8.1)
are stabilizable using state feedback. If the nominal subsystems are exponentially
stabilizable using state feedback, Assumption 8.2 is also satisﬁed.
For the purpose of illustration, we introduce an example of system (8.1) as fol-
lows
˙x1 = −x1 + x3
1e4|x1| + u1 + δ11x2
1 + δ12x1 + δ13x1x2 + δ14x2x1e|x1|,
˙x2 = −x2 + u2 + δ21x2
1 + δ22x2(t −2) + δ23x1x2 + δ24x2x1(t −0.5),
where δ1j and δ2j (j = 1,2,3,4) are bounded parameters that may be time varying,
and the bounds are not known. We will show how to obtain pij, qij and Uijs, Wijl.
For this system the interconnections satisfy the matching condition, and

1 + α113x2
1e2|x1| + α121x2
2,
where α111, α112, α113 and α121 are unknown positive scalars. From Assumption 8.4
we can see p11 = 3, p12 = 1, q11 = q12 = 0, and select
U11(·) = [|x1| x2
1 x2
1e2|x1|],
U12(·) = x2
2,
W11(·) = 0,
W12(·) = 0.
In the same way the following bounds can also be obtained as
U21(·) = x2
1,
U22(·) = x2
2,
W21(·) = x2
1(t −0.5),
W22(·) = |x2(t −2)|.
We see that the example satisﬁes Assumption 8.1. Assumption 8.2 also holds since
the two nominal subsystems are completely controllable and can be easily stabilized
with Lyapunov function V1 = x2
1 and V2 = x2
2. In what follows a decentralized adap-
tive feedback controller will be constructed to stabilize this class of interconnected
systems.

Decentralized Adaptive Control
From (8.10), we know that ˜θi is bounded, so the closed-loop system is uniformly
ultimately bounded stable based on Lyapunov stability theory.
□
Remark 8.3 From (8.13), we know that one can obtain the upper bound on the
steady state as small as desired by decreasing the value of ηi. So the system de-
signers can turn the size of the residual set by adjusting properly parameter ηi. To
obtain good transient performance, we should choose the function ki(xi) properly.
In practical systems, the function ki(xi) should be selected to render function γi3(xi)
positive enough, so that function γ (∥x∥) is sufﬁciently positive. The good transient
performance will be obtained based on (8.13).
Remark 8.4 In Theorem 8.1, the key problem is how to get positive function
Vi(xi,t) and ki(xi) to obtain −γi3(xi) satisfying inequality (8.6). We should con-
ﬁrm the class of −γi3(xi) according to the given functions Uij(·) and Wij(·) ﬁrst,
then select proper Vi(xi,t) and ki(x) to satisfy inequality (8.5). Particularly, if
Uij(xj) = Uj(xj) and Wij(xj) = Wj(xj) for all i ∈[1,N], we can select ϵj = ϵij,
νj = νij, then if the following inequality
−γi3(∥xi∥) + Nϵi∥Ui(xi)∥2 + Nνi∥Wi(xi)∥2 < 0
is satisﬁed, inequality (8.6) will hold.

feedback controllers for system (8.14) to render the closed-loop system stable in the
sense of uniform ultimate boundedness.
Now, we introduce the following standard assumption:

It is known that if (8.20) holds there always exists scalar ai satisfying λmin(Pi) > ai
and λmin(Qi) > ai, which means Assumption 8.3 is satisﬁed. The proof is quite
similar to that of Corollary 8.1.
Remark 8.5 In the existing literature, system (8.14) were considered based on Ric-
cati inequalities and linear matrix inequalities with the interconnections known or
bounded by a known linear function. However, in the present set-up, the intercon-
nections may be bounded by high-order polynomial. Furthermore, we adopt adap-
tive method, and do not have to know the bounds.
In what follows, we will present two examples to demonstrate the validity of the
foregoing results.

where δij (i = 1, 2; j = 1, 2, 3) are bounded unknown parameters. The intercon-

θ2(0) = 1,
x1(t) = [3 2]t,
x2(t) = [1 −1]t,
t ∈[t0 −2,t0].
The simulations are done via the Simulink toolbox in MATLAB 6.5. We use the
ﬁxed step size 0.01 and ode4 (Runge Kutta). When the unknown parameters δij = 1
(i = 1, 2; j = 1, 2, 3), the simulation result is shown in Fig. 8.1.
From the ﬁgure, we can see that the adaptive controllers render the closed-loop
system uniformly ultimately bounded stable. Based on Theorem 2.1, the controllers
are obtained without the knowledge of the bounds of the interconnections, which
means that the bounds of interconnections can be arbitrary. Further, let us make
simulations when the controller and initial conditions are the same, but δij = 5 and
δij = 10. The state response trajectories are shown in Figs. 8.2 and 8.3, respectively.
From the ﬁgures we can see the controllers render the corresponding system stable,
which further shows that the proposed controllers are valid and the conclusions are
feasible.

8.4 Adaptive Techniques for Interconnected Nonlinear Systems
Many physical systems are composed of interconnections of lower-dimensional sub-
systems. Furthermore, information transfer among the subsystems may have a high
cost associated with it, if it is not at all impossible. Much effort has been focused
on the application of decentralized control for large-scale interconnected systems.
A decentralized control structure naturally alleviates the computational burden asso-
ciated with a centralized control scheme. Furthermore, the extension problem (i.e.,
inclusion of additional subsystems to the system) is more easily handled through
decentralization. Earlier works on decentralized control were focused on control of
large-scale linear systems. However, most physical systems are inherently nonlin-
ear. For most practical applications, the linear control design is nicely applicable to
linearized models of interconnected systems. However, this only guarantees stabil-
ity in a region about the operating point and possibly degradation in performance
and instability over a large domain of operation.
Most of the literature on decentralized and adaptive control of interconnected
nonlinear systems [10, 15–19, 25, 27, 43] is focused on systems with ﬁrst-order
bounded interconnections. These results cannot guarantee stability when the inter-
connections between the subsystems are of higher orders [38]. In [6], decentral-
ized adaptive controllers for robotic manipulators are designed under the assump-
tion that the nonlinear interconnection terms due to Coriolis and centrifugal effects
are slowly time varying. This assumption fails to hold, however, for high-speed tra-
jectory tracking and could possibly result in instability. The ﬁrst result on global de-
centralized stabilization of large-scale systems with higher-order interconnections
is by Shi and Singh [38, 39]. The interconnections are assumed to be bounded by a
pth order polynomial in states. Adaptation of control gains is utilized to relax the
requirement of explicit knowledge of the polynomial.

8.4
Adaptive Techniques for Interconnected Nonlinear Systems
449
A major structural restriction imposed on the system in all these schemes is that
the uncertainties and interconnections are in the range space of the input matrix,
which is basically the strict matching condition. Global stabilization for systems
with mismatched uncertainties is not possible using these schemes. Recent advances
in the area of centralized adaptive nonlinear control have resulted in the recursive
design of control laws for systems which do not satisfy the strict matching require-
ment [20, 21]. Motivated by these advancements in the area of centralized nonlinear
control, we seek to investigate the possible extension of the class of large-scale non-
linear systems for which decentralized control laws can be developed.
In this section, we extend the strict matching requirement to a class of large-
scale nonlinear systems with parametric and nonparametric uncertainties. These
are termed as systems of the decentralized strict feedback form. In Sect. 8.4.2, we
characterize this class of large-scale systems. Geometric conditions are stated under
which any interconnected large scale nonlinear system can be transformed into this
form via a parameter independent decentralized diffeomorphism. The interconnec-
tions are assumed to be bounded by an unknown pth-order polynomial in states.
In Sect. 8.4.3, an adaptive decentralized control is developed using a stepwise de-
sign procedure. The design is motivated by the decentralized design in [38, 39] and
integrator backstepping along with the tuning function design for centralized con-
trol [20, 21]. The scheme is proven to guarantee global stabilization and regulation
properties. The developed control is robust to perturbations in the system dynam-
ics. Furthermore, no redesign is required for controllers of the original subsystems
if additional subsystems are appended to the system. In Sect. 8.4.4, the scheme is
extended to a model reference tracking problem, where uniform boundedness of the
tracking error is guaranteed.
8.4.1 A Class of Interconnected Nonlinear Systems
We consider a large-scale nonlinear system comprised of N interconnected sub-
systems with the interconnections being linear in the unknown parameters. The ith
subsystem is given as
˙ζi = fi0(ζi) +
pi

j=1
θijfij(ζ) + gi0(ζi)ui,
1 ≤i ≤N
(8.24)
where ζi ∈ℜni is the state vector for the ith subsystem, ζ ∈ℜn1+···+nN is the state
vector for the overall system, ui(t) ∈ℜis the control input, and θi = [θi1,...,θipi]t
is a vector of unknown constant parameters for the ith subsystem. The vector ﬁelds
fi0, fij, and gi0 are assumed to be smooth with fi0(0) = 0, fij(0) = 0 and gi0 ̸= 0.
We make the following assumption for the isolated subsystems.
Assumption 8.4 Assume that the isolated subsystems
˙ζi = fi0(ζi) + gi0(ζi)ui
(8.25)

450
8
Decentralized Adaptive Control
are globally input-to-state linearizable. Equivalently, there exists an output function
hi(ζi) such that the isolated subsystem has a relative degree ni with respect to hi.
Sufﬁcient conditions under which this assumption is satisﬁed are stated in [11].
In what follows, we deﬁne the notion of the degree of mismatch for intercon-
nected systems.
Deﬁnition 8.1 Assume that the isolated subsystems are exactly externally feedback
linearizable. Let κi denote the smallest integer such that:
1. Lk
fij hi(ζi) ≡0, 1 ≤k ≤κi −1, ∀j ∈[1..pi];
2. Lki
fij hi(ζi) ̸= 0, for at least one j ∈[1..pi], where fij(ζ) are the vector ﬁelds
in (8.24) for the ith subsystem corresponding to the interconnections. Then, the
degree of mismatch (ρi) for the ith subsystem is deﬁned as ρi = ni −κi.
The decentralized scheme proposed in the sequel is applicable to interconnected
nonlinear systems which are transformable using a global parameter independent,
decentralized transformation wi = [wi1,...,wi,ni]t = φi(ζi) to the following de-
centralized strict feedback form:
˙wi1 = wi2,
...
˙wi,κi−1 = wi,κi,
˙wi,κi = wi,κi+1 + θt
i γi0(wj1,...,wj,κj |1 ≤j ≤N),
˙wi,κi+1 = wi,κi+2 + θt
i γi1(wj1,...,wj,κj ,wi,κi+1|1 ≤j ≤N),
(8.26)
...
˙wi,ni−1 = wi,ni + θt
i γi,ni−κi−1(wj1,...,wj,κj ,wi,κi+1,...,wi,ni−1|1 ≤j ≤N),
˙wi,ni = vi(wi) + θt
i γi,ni−κi(wj1,...,wj,κj ,wi,κi+1,...,wi,ni|1 ≤j ≤N)
+ δi(wi)ui,
1 ≤i ≤N
with vi(0) = 0; γij(0) = 0, δi(wi) ̸= 0 ∀wi ∈ℜni, 1 ≤i ≤N, 0 ≤j ≤ni −κi.
Remark 8.6 A primary objective is decentralized control, it is desirable for the trans-
formation for each subsystem to utilize the states local to that subsystem. Assuming
that all the states of a subsystem are available for feedback to the controller cor-
responding to that subsystem, a decentralized control designed in the transformed
coordinates still maintains its decentralized structure in the original coordinates.
Thus, the terminology decentralized transformation is justiﬁed. The degree of mis-
match deﬁnes the separation of the interconnections from the control. The mismatch
between the interconnections (and hence uncertainties) and the control is larger for
larger ρi, resulting in increased complexity in the control design.

8.4
Adaptive Techniques for Interconnected Nonlinear Systems
451
Remark 8.7 The class of systems (8.26) illustrates a tradeoff between the degree of
mismatch and the complexity of the interconnections. The larger the degree of mis-
match ρi for the jth subsystem, the fewer are the number of states of that subsystem
appearing in the interconnections.
Given that the isolated subsystem (8.25) is input-state linearizable, the degree
of mismatch ρi of each subsystem stays the same irrespective of the choice of the
feedback linearizing coordinate transformation for the isolated subsystem. This is
made precise in the following theorem, the proof of which is relegated to Sect. 8.5.
Theorem 8.2 The degree of mismatch for each subsystem of a large-scale intercon-
nected system given by (8.24) is invariant with respect to the choice of the input-state
linearizing transformation for the isolated system.
To proceed further, the following distributions and codistributions for the i sub-
system:
gik = span{gi0,adfi0gi0,...,adk
fi0gi0},
1 ≤i ≤N, 0 ≤k ≤ni −1,
(8.27)
Ωij = span{dLni−1
fi0 hi,...,dLni−j
fi0
hi},
1 ≤j ≤ni,
(8.28)
W ij = {v ∈ℜni:⟨wi,v⟩= 0, ∀wi ∈Ωij},
(8.29)
where hi(ζi)is the output function for which (8.25) has relative degree ni.
The necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the existence of a decentralized dif-
feomorphism transforming (8.24) into (8.26) are now stated in the following propo-
sition.
Proposition 8.1 Under Assumption 8.4, a global decentralized diffeomorphism
wi = φi(ζi); 1 ≤i ≤N, transforming (8.24) into (8.26), exists if and only if the
following two conditions hold globally.
1. [X, fil] ∈gij, ∀X ∈gij , 1 ≤l ≤pi, 0 ≤j ≤ρi, where ρi is the degree of mis-
match for the ith subsystem.
2. [Y, fiρi] ∈giρi, ∀Y ∈W kρk, 1 ≤l ≤pi, 1 ≤i, k ≤N.
A proof of this proposition is given in Sect. 8.5.
8.4.2 Decentralized Adaptive Design
In what follows, the decentralized control is designed for system (8.26), which ob-
tained from (8.24) through a decentralized transformation. For notational simplic-
ity, we assume uniform degree of mismatch (n −κ) and same number of states (n)
for each subsystem. Denoting the ﬁrst κ = n −ρ states of the ith subsystem by
yi,1 ≤i ≤N and the remaining ρ states by xi, the transformed system is rewritten
in terms of (yt

A further assumption is needed for the unstructured uncertainties in the intercon-
nections γij in (8.30) and (8.31).
Assumption 8.5 The nonlinear interconnection terms in γij in (8.30) and (8.31) are
bounded by polynomial-type nonlinearities in yl, 1 ≤l ≤N, that is,

can be lumped with the unknown coefﬁcients ζ k

Remark 8.8 When the subsystems have an unequal number of states and a degree
of mismatch is notationally more cumbersome than insightful and can be handled,
as shown in the sequel. Moreover, in several practical situations, including power
systems, the system is generally comprised of dynamically similar interconnected
subsystems.
Motivated by the decentralized design in [39] and integrator backstepping along
with the tuning function design for centralized control [20, 21] a systematic design
procedure is developed. Consider initially the problem of regulating the states to a
desired set-point. The extension to the state tracking problem is considered subse-
quently.

Step 0: Deﬁne

(8.33)
and consider the ith subsystem given above. Start with the zeroth sub-subsystem,
given by (8.30), with xi1 as the virtual control input. Since (Ai,Bi) is a controllable
pair, there exists a solution 0 < P t
i = Pi to the algebraic Riccati equation (ARE)
At
iPi + PiAi −2αiPiBiBt
i Pi + Qi = 0
(8.34)
with αi > 0 and 0 < Qi = Qi. Now, choose appropriate Qi and αi to solve
(8.34) for Pi. Following [39], the decentralized control law xi1 for the zeroth sub-
subsystem of the ith subsystem is given by
xi1 = −αiBt
i Piyi −ˆβiBt
i Piyi{1 + (yt
i yi)p−1} = ri1(yi, ˆβi),
(8.35)
where p is given by (8.33) and ˆβi is a time-varying adaptation gain. Since xi1 is not
the control, we deﬁne
zi1 = xi1 −ri1(yi, ˆβi)
and consequently
˙yi = Aiyi + Bi{zi1 + ri1(yi, ˆβi) + θt
i γi0(y1,...,yN)},
1 ≤i ≤N. (8.36)
Let β∗
i be the desired value of the control gain ˆβi to counteract the effect of the
interconnections.
Now introduce the following composite Lyapunov function for the zeroth sub-
subsystems of the overall system:

Step 1: Consider xi2 as the virtual control for the (yi,zi1) subsystem. Let ˆθi be the
estimate of θi. Since ς∗is a function of the bounds on the interconnections, and
hence unknown, it needs to be estimated. Likewise, deﬁne ˆςi as an estimate for ς∗.
Consider the following composite Lyapunov function:

γiι(y1,...,yN,xi1,...,xiι)

The stability properties of the above designed decentralized adaptive control are
stated in the following theorem.
Theorem 8.3 Suppose that (8.24), with ni = n and uniform degree of mismatch
for each subsystem, satisﬁes the conditions of Proposition 8.1. The control input
(8.83) along with the adaptation laws (8.45), (8.84), and (8.85), obtained from the
above systematic design procedure, results in the global uniform stability of the
equilibrium
zi = 0,
ˆθi = θi,
ˆβi = β∗
i ,
ˆςi = ς∗,
1 ≤i ≤N.
Furthermore, regulation of the state ζ(t) is achieved,
lim
t↔∞ζ(t) = 0
for all initial conditions in Ω = ℜn1+···+nN .
Proof Applying (8.83) with adaptation laws (8.84) and (8.85), (8.82) becomes

We need to establish the existence of the gain β∗
i as a function of the interconnection
measure ς∗, such that ˙Vρ is negative. The ﬁrst two terms of ˙Vρ can be made negative
by an appropriate choice of β∗. This can be seen as follows. The coefﬁcients of terms
∥yi∥2(k−1) for k = 2,4,6,... ≤p are negative and are given by
−2kβ∗

Thus, the solutions yi, zi1,...,zi,ρ, ˆβi, ˆςi, ˆθi, ∀1 ≤i ≤N are bounded for all initial
conditions and for all t. Thus, ˙yi, ˙zij are bounded, ∀0 ≤j ≤ρ;≤i ≤N, implying
uniform continuity of yi and zij . Moreover, since Vρ(t) is a positive, monotonically
decreasing function, its limit Vρ(∞) is well deﬁned and

Thus, yi,zij ∈L2. Invoking Barbalat’s lemma [35], we have
lim
t→∞yi(t) = 0,
lim
t→∞zij(t) = 0;
0 ≤j ≤ρ, 1 ≤i ≤N.
Furthermore ˙yi, ˙zij, ˙ˆθi, ˙ˆς
i and ˙ˆβi are uniformly continuous. Also
lim

 t

˙(.)(τ)dτ < ∞,
where (.) ∈{yi,zij, ˆθi, ˆςi, ˆβi}. Therefore

lim

lim
t→∞
˙ˆς
i(t) = 0,
lim

˙ˆβi = 0,
∀0 ≤j ≤ρ, 1 ≤i ≤N.
Since xi1,...,xiρ can be expressed as smooth functions of yi, zi1,...,zi,ρ, ˆθi,
ˆςi, ˆβi, using (8.68), and from the uniqueness of 0 as an equilibrium of (8.30),
and (8.31), we obtain
lim
t→∞yi(t) = 0,
lim
t→∞˙xij(t) = 0,
∀0 ≤j ≤ρ; 1 ≤i ≤N.
It now follows from (8.30) and (8.31) that limt→∞xij(t) = 0. Finally, since
(yt
i ,xt
i )t = φi(ςi),
i = 1,...,N
is a diffeomorphism with φi(0) = 0, regulation is achieved in the original coordi-
nates, that is,
lim
t→∞ςi(t) = 0,
i ∈{1,...,N}.
□
The above design procedure proceeds independently for each subsystem after
Step 0, where the virtual control xi1 for the yi subsystem is obtained. Therefore, as
alluded to in Remark 8.8, the degree of mismatch and the number of states for each
subsystem need not be the same. Thus, the results of the above theorem are true for
the general case of different degrees of mismatch and number of states among the
subsystems. Furthermore, for each subsystem, three parameters ( ˆβi, ˆθi, ˆςi) need to
be adapted. However, if γij(0,...,0,xi1,...,xij) = 0, ∀1 ≤j ≤ρ, only the param-
eters ˆβi and ˆςi need to be updated for the ith subsystem. These points are illustrated
in the example below.

Decentralized Adaptive Control
Remark 8.9 The class of large-scale nonlinear systems can be further extended to
systems transformable to the following decentralized pure feedback form:
˙wi1 = wi2,
...
˙wi,κi−1 = wi,κi,
˙wi,κi = wi,κi+1 + θt
i γi0(wj1,...,wj,κj ,wi,κi+1|1 ≤j ≤N),
˙wi,κi+1 = wi,κi+2 + θt
i γi1(wj1,...,wj,κj ,wi,κi+1,wi,κi+2|1 ≤j ≤N),
...
˙wi,ni−1 = win + θt
i γi,ni−κi−1(wj1,...,wj,κj ,wi,κi+1,...,wi,ni|1 ≤j ≤N)
+ {δi0(wi) + θt
i δi(wj1,...,wj,κj ,wi,κi+1,...,wi,ni|1 ≤j ≤N)}ui,
1 ≤i ≤N.
(8.90)
The decentralized design can be carried out in similar steps as above. However, as
discussed in [20], the region of attraction in this case is not global, but asymptotic
regulation and tracking are guaranteed in regions for which a priori estimates are
given.
8.4.3 Simulation Example 8.3
We consider a system comprised of two subsystems with degrees of mismatch ρi =
1, i = 1,2.
Subsystem 1:
˙y11 = y12,
˙y12 = x11 + θ1(ζ11y11y12 + ζ12y2
21),
(8.91)
˙x11 = u1 + θ1x11y2
21.
Subsystem 2:
˙y21 = x21 + θ2(ζ21y2
11 + ζ22y12y21),
(8.92)
˙x21 = u2 + θ2x21y2
11.
The system is already in the decentralized strict feedback form and hence satisﬁes
the conditions of Theorem 8.3. Identifying with (8.30) and (8.31)
γ10 = ζ11y11y21 + ζ12y2
21,
γ11 = x11y2
21,
γ20 = ζ21y2
11 + ζ22y12y21,
γ21 = x21y2
11.
We design a decentralized adaptive control law for the above system following the
steps outlined earlier.

Step 0: Since the interconnections are bounded by quadratic polynomials in the
states, from (8.33) we have p = 2.
We choose

Deﬁne zi1 = xi1 −ri1. The terms νi1(yi,zi1, ˆβi) and ϕι

by

Since γi1(0,0,xi1) = 0, i = 1, 2, the unknown parameter θi can be lumped with
the coefﬁcients of the polynomial interconnections, which are also unknown. Thus,
only adaptation in ˆςi is required.
Step 1: From the bounds in (8.50), we obtain
ϖ10 = ϖ20 = 2,
ϖ11 = x2
11,
ϖ21 = x2

The closed-loop system was simulated for the following initial conditions:

responses for the two subsystems are plotted in Figs. 8.7 and 8.8, respectively.

Remark 8.10 It is interesting to note that (8.94) and (8.95) maintain a robust per-
formance to a wide class of perturbations in the system dynamics, as long as the
interconnections are bounded by a quadratic polynomial in yi. In this sense, the
controller guarantees robustness to inaccurately modeled dynamics.
8.4.4 Simulation Example 8.4
Consider the when the system of (8.91) and (8.92) is modiﬁed to the following:
Subsystem 1:
˙y11 = y12,
˙y12 = x11 + θ1[(ζ11y11y12 + ζ12y2
21 + ζ13y12y21)
(8.99)
+ ζ14y12 + ζ15y11 sin(y21)],
˙x11 = u1 + θ1x11(y2
21 + y21y11).

Decentralized Adaptive Control
Fig. 8.10 Adaptation of ˆζ1
and ˆζ2
Subsystem 2:
˙y21 = x21 + θ2[ζ21y2
11 + ζ22y12y21 + ζ23y11y12
+ ζ24y2
12 + ζ25 cos(y11)sin(y12)],
(8.100)
˙x21 = u2 + θ2x21(y2
11 + y2
12).
It is a straightforward task to show that the controller developed above will still
maintain a robust performance. The adaptation parameters self-adjust to new (pos-
sibly higher) values to incorporate the additional perturbations.
Remark 8.11 An important issue in decentralized control design is redesigning de-
centralized controllers for the original subsystems if more subsystems are appended
to the large-scale system. The design methodology proposed here obviates any need
for controller redesign for the original subsystems if the order of the nonlinearities
in the interconnections, due to the appended subsystem, is less than or equal to that
of original system. This is generally true for most practical applications, where the
interconnected subsystems are dynamically similar. In any case, deﬁning p in (8.33)
as the maximum possible order of all current and future interconnections will ensure
that the same decentralized controller works for the modiﬁed subsystems.
8.4.5 Simulation Example 8.5
For the simulation examples considered above, we append a third subsystem to the
original system given by (8.91) and (8.92). The new system is given by
Subsystem 1:
˙y11 = y12,
˙y12 = x11 + θ1(ζ11y11y21 + ζ12y2
21 + ζ13y2
31 + ζ14y21y31), (8.101)
˙x11 = u1 + θ1x11(y2
21 + y2
31).

Subsystem 2:
˙y21 = x21 + θ2(ζ21y2

(8.102)
˙x21 = u2 + θ2x21(y2
11 + y11y31).
Subsystem 3:
˙y31 = x31 + θ3(ζ31y2
11 + ζ32y21y31),
(8.103)
˙x31 = u3 + θ3x31y2
21.
The decentralized control laws for the ﬁrst and second subsystems are given by
(8.94), (8.95) with adaptation laws (8.93) and (8.96). For the third subsystem
r31 = −y31{10 + ˆβ3(1 + y2
31)}.
Deﬁning z31 = x31 −r31, the control law for u3 is given by
u3 = −z31

the fact that the same control laws maintain a robust performance even when more
subsystems are appended to the original system.

8.4.6 Tracking Behavior
The objective of the decentralized state tracking problem is to track a given reference
model. To avoid notational complexity, we consider the case of uniform degrees of
mismatch and number of states among the subsystems. Since the isolated subsys-
tems are in the Brunovsky form, we choose a similar model for each subsystem of
the interconnected system given by (8.30) and (8.31), that is,
˙ymi = Aiymi + Bixmi1,
˙xmi1 = xmi2,
...
(8.106)
˙xmi,n−κ−1 = xmi,n−κ,
˙xmi,n−κ = Ki[yt

where ri is an external (reference) input to the ith subsystem model. We ﬁrst deﬁne
the state tracking errors ˜yi = yi −ymi and ˜xi = xi −˜xmi. The design procedure in
the previous section is applied to tracking error system
˙˜yi = Ai ˜yi + Bi ˜xi1 + Biθt
i γi0(y1,...,yN),
˙˜xi1 = ˜xi2 + θt
i γi1(y1,...,yN,xi1),

with certain distinctions which are outlined below.
Step 0: View ˜xi1 as the virtual control for the ˜yi subsystem in (8.108). Therefore,
we have
˜xi1 = −αiBt
i Pi ˜yi −ˆβiBt
i Pi ˜yi{1 + ( ˜yt
i ˜yi)(p−1)}
= ri1( ˜yi, ˆβi)
(8.108)

(8.109)
where σi1 > 0 incorporates the “σ-modiﬁcation” to avoid parameter drift as orig-
inally proposed in [14]. The properties of the virtual control law (8.108) can be
analyzed using the following Lyapunov function:

˙V0 is now obtained following manipulations parallel to Step 0 in the regulation case
with an additional term due to ζ ι
max.
Since, ˜xi1 is only the virtual control, deﬁne the error ˜zi1 = ˜xi1 −˜ri1( ˜yi, ˆβi). In
Step 1, the dynamics for the error term ˜zi1 are formulated, and the virtual control
for ˜xi2 is obtained. In this case, due to the additional ﬁrst term in (8.112), we also
need
max
ι∈{1...n−κ}(Nζ ι
maxym)2 = ζmax.
We denote this estimate by ˆζmax.

(8.113)
with Γik > 0, k = 2, 3, 4. At each step m (2 ≤m ≤n −κ −1) of the design proce-
dure, virtual control laws for ˜xi,m+1 are designed, and the error ˜zi,m+1 is deﬁned as
the difference between ˜xi,m+1 and the virtual control. The Lyapunov function at the
mth step is given by Vm = Vm−1 + N
i=1 ˜z2

are designed at each step to avoid overparameterization in designing the adaptation
law for ˆζmax. The tuning functions at step m (2 ≤m ≤n −κ) are given by

ters.
The following theorem states the stability and tracking properties of the proposed
decentralized tracking control, the proof of which is left as an exercise.
Theorem 8.4 The control input (8.121) along with the adaptation laws (8.109)
and (8.122)–(8.124) results in the global uniform boundedness of the error system
[ ˜yi, ˜xi, ˆβi, ˆθi, ˆςi, ˆζmax], 1 ≤i ≤N, with respect to a compact set around the ori-
gin. Furthermore, the error ˜yi can be made arbitrarily small by choosing the design
parameters appropriately.
Remark 8.12 The control effort at each step (k) is a function of 1/σk and cik. Thus,
the choice of σk, cik illustrates a tradeoff between the magnitude of the tracking error
and the control effort applied. It holds that the conclusions of the above theorem are
true for the case of nonuniform degrees of mismatch and number of states among
the subsystems. In the sequel, this will be apparent.

8.4.7 Simulation Example 8.6
We consider the example system given by (8.91) and (8.92). The parameters of the
reference model (8.106) are given as
K1 = [−27 −27 −9],
K2 = [−9 −6],
bm1 = [0 0 20]t,
bm2 = [0 20]t.
The reference signals to be tracked are r1(t) = r2(t) = sin(3t).
Step 0: Using the same αi,Pi, and Qi as in simulation example 8.3, the virtual
controls in this step are designed using (8.108) as
r11 = −( ˜y11 + 1.0954 ˜y12){10 + ˆβ1(1 + ˜y2
11 + ˜y2
12)},
(8.125)
r21 = −˜y21{10 + ˆβ2(1 + ˜y2
21)}.
For adaptation, we choose the adaptation gains Γij = 2, σij = 0.5. The adaptation
for ˆβi given by (8.109), i.e.,
˙ˆβ1 = 2( ˜y11 + 1.0954 ˜y12)2(1 + ˜y2
11 + ˜y2
12)
× {1 + 2(10.9545 ˜y2
11 + 1.0954 ˜y2
12 + ˜2y11 ˜y12)} −ˆβ1
= τ10( ˜y11, ˜y12),
(8.126)
˙ˆβ2 = 2 ˜y2
21(1 + ˜y2
21)(1 + 2 ˜y2
21) −ˆβ2
= τ20( ˜y21).
Step 1: Deﬁne ˜zi1 = ˜xi1 −ri1; νi1, ϕι
i1, and ϖiι are the same as in (8.91) and (8.92)
with yi and zi replaced by ˜yi and ˜zi, respectively. Since the degree of mismatch
is one, the control input for each subsystem appears in this step and is obtained
from (8.121) (using ρj = 1.0), i.e.,
u2 = −˜z11
2 −( ˜y11 + 1.0954 ˜y12)

bounded.
The adaptation of parameters ˆβi, ˆςi, and ζ i

Remark 8.13 As before, it can be shown that the decentralized tracking control law
maintains robustness to perturbations in the system dynamics as long as the order
of the interconnections remains the same. Also, the same control law can be used if
additional subsystems are appended to the original system.

8.5.1 Proof of Theorem 2.1
Proof Let ϕi(ζi) and ψi(ζi) be two outputs for which the isolated subsystem has
relative degree ni. Let the degrees of mismatch with respect to the coordinate trans-
formation corresponding to these two outputs be different. More precisely, ∃κi,μi
(without loss of generality κi < μi, so that the degrees of mismatch as deﬁned in
Deﬁnition 8.1 are different, i.e., ni −κi > ni −μi) such that
Lj
filϕi ≡0,
0 ≤j ≤κi −1,
∀ℓ∈[1..pi],
Lκi
filϕi ̸= 0,
for at least one ℓ∈[1..pi],
(8.130)
Lj
fimψi ≡0,
j ∈{0,...,κi,...,μi −1},
∀m ∈[1..pi],
Lμi
fimψi ̸= 0,
for at least one m ∈[1..pi].
(8.131)
By construction, ϕi(ζi) and ψi(ζi) are obtained such that the codistributions gener-
ated by their gradients are annihilators of the following distribution:

span{gi0,adfi0,gi0,...,adni−2
fi0
gi0}.
By virtue of feedback linearizability of the isolated subsystem, the above distribu-
tion is involutive and has dimension ni −1. Correspondingly, its annihilating codis-
tribution is of dimension one. Thus ∃πi(ζi) ̸= 0 such that
dψi + πi(ζi)dϕi = 0.
(8.132)
Let ⟨.,.⟩denote the inner product. Consider Lκi
filψi + πi(ζi)Lκi
filϕi, where l is the
index for all the vector ﬁelds for which (8.130) is satisﬁed. Then

The last term in (8.133) is zero, since Lκi−j
Fil
ϕi = 0, 1 ≤j ≤κi −1. Also from
(8.132), the ﬁrst term is zero. Therefore
Lκi
filψi + πi(ζi)Lκi
Filϕi = 0.
(8.134)
But, Lκi
filψi = 0, and since πi(ζi) ̸= 0, (8.134) implies that Lκi
filϕi = 0, which con-
tradicts (8.130). Thus, necessarily
κi = μi
⇐⇒
ni −κi = ni −μi.
Equivalently, the degree of mismatch is the same for both transformations.

8.5.2 Proof of Proposition 8.1
Proof Sufﬁciency. From Assumption 8.4, there exists a global diffeomorphism wi =
φi(ζi),φi(0) = 0, transforming the ith isolated subsystem (8.25) into
˙wij = wi,j+1,

(8.135)
with vi(0) = 0, δi(wi) ̸= 0 ∀wi ∈ℜni. For the ith subsystem, the representation of
fi0,gi0, and gik in the transformed coordinates is

Furthermore, in the transformed coordinates

1 ≤j ≤ni.
Therefore, in transformed coordinates

(8.139)
which is the same as given in (8.26). This completes the proof of sufﬁciency.
Necessity. Given a diffeomorphism wi = φi(ζi) that transforms the original sys-
tem (8.24)–(8.26), it is easy to verify that the coordinate-free conditions (i) and (ii)
are satisﬁed for (8.26) and hence for (8.24).

Decentralized Adaptive Control
8.6 Decentralized Adaptive Tracker
8.6.1 Introduction
In recent years, the decentralized control of interconnected systems has been a pop-
ular research topic in control theory. Large-scale systems, such as transportation
systems, power systems, communications systems, to name a few, are the essential
features of our modern life. One of the early decentralized adaptive control methods
was proposed in [17], which focused on the vital role of interconnections. It showed
that interconnections, even if they are weak, can make a decentralized adaptive con-
troller unstable. Decentralized adaptive controllers were essentially developed to
guarantee boundedness and exponential convergence of the tracking and parame-
ter errors to bounded residual sets. Several decentralized adaptive techniques have
been developed in [2–4, 7, 12, 13, 38] and [30–41]. Mos of these works are conﬁned
to strictly decentralized adaptive control systems where no explicit communication
exists between subsystems.
A particular class of these techniques is the model reference adaptive control
(MRAC), where the objective of the theory is to give the performance speciﬁca-
tions in terms of a model. The model represents the ideal response of the process
to a command signal. MRAC has been extensively developed for continuous time
systems [17] and discrete-time systems [8].
One of the main disadvantages of the known model reference decentralized adap-
tive control laws is that the convergence of local tracking errors only to a bounded
residual set. Besides, the bounds of this set are unknown a priori and the size de-
pends upon the bound for the strength of the unmodelled interconnections, so such
adaptive schemes may be unsuitable for some applications. The need to develop new
methods which would allow one to avoid this basic disadvantage is therefore appar-
ent. In this regard, a modiﬁed local adaptive control scheme was proposed in [28]
which improves the transient performance by utilizing an appropriate time-delay ac-
tion in the centralized adaptive control. A further improvement was reported in [45]
based on backstepping adaptive tracking. A more general class of interconnected
systems with unmodelled dynamics was considered in [42, 44].
With the rapid advances in digital technology and computers, more and more
control engineers would like to replace analogue controllers with digital controllers
for the purpose of better reliability, lower cost, and more ﬂexibility [9]. In the sequel,
we focus attention on the digital redesign approach [1, 9] to construct the digital
tracker for the sampled-data system. Based on the ideas contained in [28, 31] and
the digital redesign method, a novel sampled-data decentralized adaptive approach
is provided to the solution of the decentralized adaptive tracking problem in this
article, so that the system output will follow any trajectory speciﬁed at sampling
instant which may not be presented by the analytic reference model initially.
Based on the given plant, a well-designed reference model is proposed to ﬁt
the desired trajectory at discrete-time sampling instant ﬁrst. Then, by invoking
the digital redesign technique, we develop an acceptable digital tracker for the
sampled-data decentralized adaptive system which closely matches the response of

the continuous-time well-designed system with the same inputs and initial condi-
tions, rather than designing a new controller using the digital control theory.
8.6.2 The Decentralized Adaptive Control Design
The decentralized adaptive control for linear time-invariant system has been stud-
ied since the 1980s. In [31], the author introduced a new and numerically efﬁcient
approach to the design of the decentralized adaptive controller for linear large-scale
systems. The digital model-reference-based decentralized adaptive controller for the
decentralized adaptive control system proposed in this chapter is mainly derived
from the analogue adaptive controller proposed for the analogue system in [28, 31].
8.6.3 The Decentralized Adaptive Problem
Most available techniques focus on the design of centralized controllers, in which
every input affects all controller outputs. The design method has received a great
deal of attention in the control literature. We used the decentralized controller to re-
alize the complicated centralized controller for the desired performance. The struc-
ture of the decentralized control system is shown in Fig. 8.22. Although this con-
straint on the controller structure may lead to performance deterioration when com-
pared to a system with a single centralized controller, the decentralized control is
used in most industrial control system designs. The advantages of decentralized
control are summarized below:
Fig. 8.22 The structure of decentralized control system

1. Control hardware simplicity: the cost of implementation of a decentralized con-
trol system is clearly less than that of a centralized controller.
2. Control design and tuning simplicity: the decentralized controllers include far
fewer parameters to result in great reduction in the time and cost of tuning.
Consider a linear time-invariant system Σp consisting of N interconnected subsys-
tems Σp1,Σp2,Σp3,...,ΣpN, which is described by [31] as follows:
Σpi:
˙xpi(t) = Apixpi(t) + bpi

upi(t) +
N

j=1,j̸=1
l∗t
ij xpj(t)

,
(8.140)
ypi(t) = cpixpi(t),
(8.141)
where i = 1,2,...,N, upi(t) ∈ℜis the input, ypi(t) ∈ℜis the output, xpj(t) ∈
ℜnj ×1 is the state vector of the jth subsystem and xpi ∈ℜni×1 is the state vector of
the ith subsystem at time t. The matrices Api ∈ℜni×ni, and the vectors bpi ∈ℜni×1,
cpi ∈ℜ1×ni are assumed to be known. Assume that all subsystems in (8.140) are
completely controllable and the overall system is decentrally stabilized.
The corresponding N designed inner-loop reference models Σmi, not arbitrary
assigned, are described as
Σmi:
˙xmi(t) = Amixmi(t)bmiumi(t),
(8.142)
ymi(t) = cmixmi(t),
(8.143)
where i = 1,2,...,N, umi(t) ∈ℜis the bounded control input, ymi(t) ∈ℜis the
bounded output, and xmi(t) ∈ℜni×1, which is the tracking target of the state xpi(t)
of the subsystem Σpi, is the corresponding state of the ith model Σmi at time t. The
matrices Ami ∈ℜni×ni are asymptotically stable constant matrices of appropriate
dimensions, and the constant vectors bmi ∈ℜni×1, cmi ∈ℜ1×ni are identical to bpi,
cpi in Σpi and Σmi, respectively, i.e. bmi = bpi and cmi = cpi.
The terms l∗t
ij xpj(t) (j ̸= i), as shown in (8.140), corresponding to the perturba-
tions on the subsystem Σpi due to subsystems Σpj,j̸=i, j = 1,2,...,N. To com-
pensate for all the interconnections for achieving the decoupling close-loop system,
eliminating l∗t
ij xpj(t) is the ﬁrst control objective, and the second control objective is
to estimate the parameters lpi(t) in (8.140), so that xpi(t) can asymptotically track
xmi(t) with zero error.
As long as the given (Api,bpi) pairs are controllable, one can have the inner-loop
feedback gain Kmi in (8.144)
Ami = Api −bpiKmi,
(8.144)
based on the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) design, without any restriction, to
form the desired Ami shown in (8.142). The optimal state-feedback control law is to
minimize the following performance index:
Ji =
 ∞
0
{xt
mi(t)Qixmi(t)ut
mi(t)Riumi(t)}dt,
(8.145)

8.6

489
with Qi ≥0 and Ri > 0 for the plant subsystem Σpi. This inner-loop optimal con-
trol is given by
umi(t) = −Kmixmi(t),
(8.146)
where Kmi = R−1
i
bt
piOi [31], and Oi is the positive deﬁnite and symmetric solution
of the following Riccati equation:
At
piOi + OiApi −OibpiR−1
i
bt
piOi + Qi = 0.
Then, the resulting system (8.142) becomes
˙xmi(t) = (Api −bpiKmi)xmi(t) + bpiumi(t),
(8.147)
where the outer-loop control input umi(t) is to be further designed in Sect. 8.7.1 so
that ymi(t) will track the reference input ri(t) well.
For N subsystems Σpi and N reference submodels Σmi, there exists N con-
trollers Σci to compensate Σpi. At every instant t, the controller Σci accesses only
the state xpi(t) of the subsystem 
pi and the complete knowledge of the desired
states xmi(t) of all the reference models Σmi. It is desired to determine controllers
Σci to generate bounded inputs upi(t) such that xpi(t) are bounded, and
lim
t→∞∥eci(t)∥= lim
t→∞∥xpi(t) −xmi(t)∥= 0.
Remark 8.14 The structure of the interconnections shown in (8.140) is identical to
that of [7]. The structure assures the existence of a bounded control input upi(t)
which can compensate for all the interconnections, provided the vectors lij and the
states xpj(t) are known to controller Σci. It is assumed that each controller Σci is
aware only of the input upi(t) and the states xpj(t) of the subsystem Σpi at every
time instant t. It can also be restated that the adaptive control has to be carried out
using only inputs and outputs (rather than the state vectors) of the subsystems, and
the interconnections between them assume special forms [29].
8.6.3.1 A Model-Reference Adaptive Controller
The digital decentralized adaptive controller for the sampled-data large-scale in-
terconnected system proposed in this chapter is mainly derived from the analogue
decentralized adaptive controller proposed for the analogue system in [31]. Here,
we brieﬂy introduce the derivation of analogue decentralized adaptive controller in
this section, and the complete proof is given in [31].
Consider the model-reference-based decentralized adaptive control (MRDAC)
problem, as shown in Fig. 8.23, where all controllers access only to the input upc(t)
and the state xpc(t) of the subsystem. The linear controllable continue-time sys-
tem and the reference model, described by (8.140)–(8.143), are restated globally,
respectively, as

The decentralized adaptive control problem is that while the controller Σci is
aware of the form of the interconnections (that is, l∗t
ij xpj(t)), it has no knowledge
of either l∗t
ij or xpj(t). As stated previously, the desired state xmj(t), in place of the
state xpj(t), of the other subsystem Σpj is used as a part of its control input by the
controller Σci [31].
Proceeding further, we let the control input upi(t) of the subsystem Σpi be

where the second term is introduced to match the reference model, the third term
attempts to help stabilize the overall system and the last term is used to cancel
the effect of perturbations due to the other subsystems Σpj and γci is the extra
compensating gain. The state-feedback gain (lpi(t),lij(t)) are adjusted using the
following adaptive laws from [31] as follows:

and some ¯γci exists such that whenever γci ≥¯γci, ˙V is negative-semi deﬁnite, thus
V is a Lyapunov function for all systems. Choosing such a γci for each subsystem,
it is followed that eci(t), ˜lpi(t) and ˜lij(t) are bounded for all i, which implies that
˙eci(t) is bounded and limt→∞ec(t) = 0.
8.7 The Digital Redesign of the Decentralized Adaptive Control
System
The digital redesign is desired to ﬁnd the digital controller from the available ana-
logue controller Σci, so that the digitally redesigned sampled-data states are able
to closely match those of the original analogously controlled system. The afore-
mentioned prediction based digital redesign method [9], developed for the digital
redesign of a state-feedback system, is utilized to ﬁnd the state-matching digital
controller for the analogue control system. The detailed derivation and properties of
the prediction based digital controller ud(kT ) can be found in [9].
Here, the digital redesign approach is introduced which leads to the novel dig-
itally redesigned model reference- based adaptive controller for the sampled data

8.7.1 The Digital Redesign Methodology
For ymi(t) to track the reference input ri(t) well, consider the linear controllable
continuous-time
reference model described previously in (8.142) and (8.143), as
shown in Fig. 8.24, the tracker design of linear continuous-time reference model is
given by
umc(t) = −Kcxmc(t) + Ecr(t),
(8.167)

where Kc ∈ℜN×n is the state-feedback gain, Ec ∈ℜN×N is the feed-forward gain,
and r(t) = [r1(t) r2(t) ... rN(t)]t ∈ℜN is the piecewise-constant reference input
vector r(t) = r(kT ) for kT ≤t ≤(k + 1)T . The controlled closed-loop reference
model becomes
˙xmc(t) = (Am −BmKc)xmc(t) + BmEcr(t).
(8.168)
By linear quadratic optimal tracker algorithm [1], let the performance index be

(8.170)
The prediction-based digital redesign method is utilized to realize a digitally re-
designed controller. Thus, the digitally redesigned sampled-data state in Fig. 8.25 is
able to closely match that of the original analogously controlled system in Fig. 8.24.
The digitally redesigned controller umd(kT ) achieved from the analogue controller
umc(t) in (8.167) can be described as
umd(kT ) = −Kdxmd(kT ) + Edr∗(kT ),
(8.171)
where Kd ∈ℜm×n is the digital state feedback gain, Ed ∈ℜm×m is the digital feed-
forward gain and T > 0 is the sampling period. The discrete-time state xmd(kT ) can
be decided from the discrete-time model of the analogue model (8.150) as
xmd(kT + T ) = Gmxmd(kT ) + Hmumd(kT ),
(8.172)
where

(8.174)
Ed = (Im + KcHm)−1Ec,
(8.175)
and r∗(kT ) in (8.171), the alternative form of the original reference input r(t) at
time step t = kT with one-step ahead amplitude r(kT + T ) for tracking purpose is
set to be
r∗(kT ) = r(kT + T ).
A zero-order holder (Z.O.H.) is utilized here.
8.7.2 An Improved Redesign Adaptive Controller
Consider the linear controllable continuous-time system, shown in Fig. 8.23 and
described in (8.148) and (8.149), controlled adaptively by the continuous-time state-
feedback controller which is described as
upc = Fcumc(t) −Lt
pcxpc(t) −γcet
cPBp −Lt
c(t)xmc(t)
= Fcumc(t) −Lt
pc(t)xpc(t) −γcBt
p(t)Pec(t) −Lt
c(t)xmc(t),
(8.176)
where the second term is introduced to match the reference model, the third term
attempts to help stabilize the overall system and the last term is used to cancel the
effect of the interconnections.
The state feed-forward gain Fc ∈ℜN×N is set to be unity and (Lpc(t),Lc(t)) is
the state feedback gain, the extra compensating gain γc can be optimized by EP
(evolution programming) or GA (genetic algorithm) method under performance
consideration, umc(t) = umc(kT ) for kT ≤t < (k + 1)t is the piecewise-constant
reference input vector, and the controlled closed-loop system thus becomes
˙xpc(t) = Apc(t)xpc(t) −Bpγcet
c(t)PBp −BpLt
c(t)xmc(t) + BpFcumc(t), (8.177)
where Apc(t) = Ap −BpLt
pc(t).
The extra compensating input signal gains (Fc,γc) are compounded as
γc = blockdiag[γc1 γc2 ... γcN],
Fc = blockdiag[fc1 fc2 ... fcN],
where the components of upc(t) in (8.154) and (8.155) are adjusted adaptively by
(8.157) and (8.158), respectively.

Decentralized Adaptive Control
Let the corresponding hybrid system be described by the state equation
˙xpd(t) = Apxpd(t)Bpupd(t),
(8.178)
where upd(t) ∈ℜN×1 is the piecewise-constant input vector, satisfying
upd(t) = upd(kT )
for kT ≤t ≤(k + 1)t
(8.179)
and the sampling period T > 0. The discrete-time state feedback controller shown
in Fig. 8.26 is assumed to be
upd(kT ) = Fd(kT )umd(kT ) −Lt
pd(kT )xpd(kT )
−γd(kT )et
d(kT )PBp −Lt
d(kT )xmd(kT ),
(8.180)
where Fd(kT ) ∈ℜN×N is the digital state feed-forward gain, Lpd(kT ),Lmd(kT ) ∈
ℜN×n are the digital state feedback gains, and u∗
md(kT ) ∈ℜN×1 is the piecewise
constant reference input vector which is determined in terms of umd(t) for tracking
purpose. The digitally controlled closed-loop system is then
˙xpd(t) = Apxpd(t) + Bp[Fd(kT )umd(kT ) −Lt
pd(kT )xpd(kT )
−γd(kT )et
d(kT )PBp −Lt
md(kT )xmd(kT )]
for kT ≤t ≤(k + 1)T.
(8.181)
Notice that the notation A in Fig. 8.26 is deﬁned as A ≡diag[Ap1 Ap2 ... ApN].
The digital redesign is desired to ﬁnd the digital gains (Fd(kT ), Lpd(kT ),
Lmd(kT )) in (8.180) from the analogue gains (Fc,Lpc(t),Lc(t)) in (8.176), with
the zero-order-hold device utilized for (8.176), so that the digital closed-loop state
in (8.181) is able to closely match the analogue one in (8.177) at all the sampling
instants, for the given umc(t) = umc(kT ) for kT ≤t ≤(k + 1)t.
The continuous-time state stated in (8.148), at t = tv = kT + vT for 0 ≤v ≤1
where v is the tuning parameter, is obtained as
xpc(tv) = eAp(tv−kT )xpc(kT ) +

p xpc(kT ) + H (v)
p upc(tv),
(8.182)
where upc(tv) is assumed to be the piecewise-continuous input, and
G(v)
p = eAp(tv−kT ) = eApvT = (eApT )v = Gv

It must be noted that (G(v)
p −In)A−1
p is a short-hand notation, which is well deﬁned
and can be veriﬁed by the cancellation of A−1
p
in the series expansion of the term
(G(v)
p −In). Therefore, the invertibility of matrix Ap is no longer required.
Likewise, the discrete-time state stated in (8.178), at t = tv = kT + vT for 0 ≤
v ≤1, is found to be
xpd(tv) = eAp(tv−kT )xpd(kT ) +
 kT +vT

p upd(kT ).
(8.183)
Thus, under the assumption of xpc(kT ) = xpd(kT ), it results from (8.182) and
(8.183) that to obtain the state xpc(tv) = xpd(tv), it is necessary to have upc(tv) =
upd(KT ) which leads to the digital prediction-based controller
upd(kT ) = upc(tv)
= Fcumc(tv) −Lt
pc(tv)xpc(tv) −γcet
c(tv)PBp −Lt
c(tv)xmc(tv)
= Fcumc(tv) −Lt

(8.184)
where the future state xpd(tv), with the substitution described in (8.177), needs to
be predicted by basing on the available causal signals, xpd(kT ) and upd(kT ). For
practical applications, v can be considered as a tuning parameter for the desired
closeness between the predicted digital and analogue states. If v = 1, then the pre-
requisite xpc(kT + T ) = xpd(kT + T ) is ensured. Thus, for k = 0,1,2,..., solving
for upd(kT ) from (8.178), the desired prediction based digital controller results in
upd(kT ) = Fdumd(kT ) −Lpd(kT )xpd(kT ) −Ld(kT )xmd(kT )

8.7.3 Incorporating Optimal Tracker
As shown in Fig. 8.26, combining the interconnected system in Fig. 8.22 and the
reference model with optimal tracker in Fig. 8.23 results in the MRDAC with opti-
mal tracker, where the MRDAC ensures that the state of the system exactly tracks
the one of reference model, while the latter is regulated by the tracker to follow the
reference input as close as possible.
The main advantage of this structure is that the design procedure of overall con-
trol can be separated into two parts, therefore, the controller design of the two parts
can be considered individually so that the complexity of the overall controller design
is simpliﬁed considerably. Here, we would like to point out the proposed methodol-
ogy can be easily extended from SISO subsystem to the MIMO subsystems.
The overall control methodology is summarized in the sequence of analogue and
digital control block diagrams as Figs. 8.27 and 8.28.

(xm1(t),xm2(t)).

close as possible to the original continuous-time state trajectories. The trajectories
of the controller inputs with signal responses and states are shown in Figs. 8.29–
8.38. To show the robustness of the proposed, let the tracker have good performance
in the beginning, but the ﬁrst subsystem input is artiﬁcially reduced to 5 of the deter-
mined input by external factor in 13 sec. Figs. 8.39 and 8.40 show that the proposed
decentralized controller induces a good robustness on the decoupling of the closed-
loop controlled system. When the inputs of parts of the system are broken, the others

8.8 Notes and References
In this chapter we considered the control problem for a class of time varying nonlin-
ear large-scale systems with time delays in the interconnections, and the intercon-
nections can be nonlinear. An adaptive state feedback controller is proposed that is
independent of time delays, and render the closed-loop system uniformly ultimately
bounded stable. The result is also applied to control a class of interconnected sys-
tems whose nominal system is linear, and the corresponding state feedback con-
troller and adaptive laws are obtained. Finally, numerical examples are given to

demonstrate the validity of the results developed in this chapter. It is shown from
the example that the results obtained are effective and feasible. Therefore our re-
sults can be expected to have some applications to practical control problems of
uncertain dynamic interconnected systems with time delay.
This chapter further extends the class of large-scale nonlinear systems for which
decentralized controllers can be designed. This class is identiﬁed by systems trans-
formable to a decentralized strict feedback form for which the matching condition is
not satisﬁed. Geometric conditions for the existence of a parameter independent, de-
centralized diffeomorphism are presented. Higher order interconnections bounded
by unknown pth order polynomials are considered. A constructive, stepwise pro-
cedure for decentralized control design is presented. Adaptation laws are obtained
to update the control gains to counter uncertainties in the interconnections. Global
regulation is proved, and its effectiveness is shown using a simulation example. Ro-
bustness of the developed control laws to perturbations in the system dynamics is

established through simulations. Furthermore, it is shown that no redesign of de-
centralized controllers is required for the original subsystems if new subsystems are
appended to the system. Finally, an adaptive model reference decentralized tracking
control design is outlined for the same class of large-scale systems. Global uniform
boundedness of the tracking error to a compact set is obtained in this case.
Finally, it is shown that the exact tracking of individual subsystem outputs is
theoretically possible by the strictly decentralized control, where the controller of
each subsystem has no knowledge of the inputs or states of the other subsystems. To
achieve the exact tracking, the desired states or outputs of the other subsystems Σmj
must be accessible to each controller Σci of subsystem #pi and be used in place of
the corresponding inaccessible states or outputs to compensate for the perturbation
signals from them.
The awareness of the desired states of the other subsystems implies that there
is implicit cooperation among the subsystems, and communication between subsys-

tems becomes necessary when some of the subsystems change their desired trajecto-
ries. From a theoretical point of view, the problem reduces to that of demonstrating
overall system stability. By using the high gain controller, the individual subsystems
are made sufﬁciently stable so that the overall stability is assured in spite of inter-
connections. This is accomplished by using appropriate feedback and proving the
existence of a Lyapunov function for the overall system.
With the utilization of the reference model representing the desired states, the
design procedure of the controller is separated into two parts, one ensures that the
state of the reference model is exactly tracked by the one of the systems and the
other makes the reference model follow the reference input as closely as possible.
Thus, the controller design of the two parts can be considered individually so that
the complexity of the overall controller design is considerably simpliﬁed. Since the
perfect model following is possible in the ideal case, it is believable intuitively that
the bounds on the errors obtained will also be smaller.
The control methodology is further applied to a class of large-scale sampled-
data systems with interconnected strengths. It is shown that in the sampled data
decentralized adaptive control, it is theoretically possible to asymptotically track
desired outputs with a desired performance and shows that the proposed decen-
tralized controller induces a good robustness on the decoupling of the closed-loop
controlled system. The prediction-based digital redesign methodology is utilized to
ﬁnd the new digital controllers for effective digital control of the analogue plant. An
illustrative example of interconnected linear system is presented to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed design methodology.

9.1 Finite Dimensional Spaces
In what follows, we will introduce some of the fundamental notions in linear alge-
bra. The treatment is essentially meant to be as assembly of analytical tools with
references given at the end of the chapter. We provide few proofs so as to encourage
the reader to gain practice with the machinery and results.
9.1.1 Vector Spaces
The structure introduced hereafter is the corner-stone of system theory, that of a vec-
tor space, also called a linear space. Let xj,yj ∈ℜ(or C), j = 1,2,...,n. Then the
n-dimensional vectors x, y are deﬁned by x = [x1 x2 ... xn]t, y = [y1 y2 ... yn]t
∈ℜn, respectively, where ℜn = ℜ×···×ℜ. A nonempty set X of elements x,y,...
is called the real (or complex) vector space (or real (complex) linear space) by
deﬁning two algebraic operations, vector additions, and scalar multiplication, in
x = [x1 x2 ... xn]t.
Given two vector spaces X1 and X2 with the same associated scalar ﬁeld, we use
X1 × X2 to denote the vector space formed by their Cartesian product. Thus every
element of X1 × X2 is of the form
(x1,x2)
where x1 ∈X1 and x2 ∈X2.
A nonempty subset G ⊂ℜn is called a linear subspace of ℜn if x +y and αx are in G
whenever x and y are in G for any scalar α. A set of elements X = {x1, x2, ..., xn}
is said to be a spanning set for a linear subspace G of ℜn if every elements g ∈G
can be written as a linear combination of the {xj}. That is, we have
G = {g ∈ℜ: g = α1x1 + α2x2 + ··· + αnxn for some scalars α1,α2, ..., αn}.

Sometimes the shorthand notation
span{x1,x2,...,xn}
is used. A spanning set X is said to be a basis for G if no element xj of the span-
ning set X of G can written as a linear combination of the remaining elements
x1,x2,...,xj−1,xj+1,...,xn, that is, xj, 1 ≤j ≤n form a linearly independent
set. It is frequent to use xj = [0 0 ... 0 1 0 ... 0]t the jth unit vector. The geomet-
ric ideas of linear vector spaces had led to the concepts of “spanning a space” and
a “basis for a space”.
The n-dimensional Euclidean space, denoted throughout this book by ℜn, is a
linear vector space equipped by the inner product
⟨x,y⟩= xty =
n

j=1
xjyj.
Let X be a linear space over the ﬁeld F (typically F is the ﬁeld of real numbers ℜ
or complex numbers C). Then a function
∥.∥: X →ℜ
that maps X into the real numbers ℜis a norm on X iff
1. ∥x∥≥0, ∀x ∈X (non-negativity)
2. ∥x∥= 0 ⇔x = 0 (positive deﬁniteness)
3. ∥αx∥= |α|∥x∥∀x ∈X (homogeneity with respect to |α|)
4. ∥x + y∥≤∥x∥+ ∥y∥, ∀x,y ∈X (triangle inequality)
Given a linear space X , there are many possible norms on it. For a given norm
∥.∥on X , the pair (X , ∥.∥) is used to indicate X endowed with the norm ∥.∥.
9.1.2 Norms of Vectors
The class of Lp-norms is deﬁned by
∥x∥p =
 n

j=1
|xj|p
1/p
,
for 1 ≤p < ∞,
∥x∥∞= max
1≤j≤n|xj|.
The three most commonly used norms are ∥x∥1, ∥x∥2 and ∥x∥∞. All p-norms
are equivalent in the sense that if ∥x∥p1 and ∥x∥p2 are two different p-norms, then
there exist positive constants c1 and cs such that
c1∥x∥p1 ≤∥x∥p2c2 ∥x∥p1,
∀x ∈ℜn.

Induced norms of matrices
For a matrix A ∈ℜn×n, the induced p-norm of A is
deﬁned by
∥A∥p ≜sup
x̸=0
∥Ax∥p
∥x∥p
=
sup
∥x∥p=1
∥Ax∥p.
Obviously, for matrices A ∈ℜm×n and B ∈ℜn×r, we have the triangle inequality
∥A + B∥p ≤∥A∥|p + ∥B∥p.
It is easy to show that the induced norms are also equivalent in the same sense as
for the vector norms, and satisfying
∥AB∥p ≤∥Ax∥p∥B∥p,
∀A ∈ℜn×m,∀B ∈ℜm×r
which is known as the submultiplicative property. For p = 1,2,∞, we have the
corresponding induced norms as follows

9.1.3 Some Basic Topology
We start by deﬁning the notion of neighborhood of a point in the vector space V.
To do this, we ﬁrst deﬁne the unit ball with respect to a basis. Suppose that
{u1,u2,...,un} is a basis for the vector space V. The open unit ball B in this basis
is deﬁned by
B(u1,...,un) = {α1u1 + ··· + αnun ∈V : αj ∈ℜ,α2
1 + ··· + α2
n < 1}.
This set contains all the points that can be expressed, in the basis, with the vector of
coefﬁcients α inside the unit sphere of ℜn and clearly it is basis-dependent.
Next we deﬁne the notion of neighborhood of a point, which intuitively means
any set that totally surrounds the given point in the vector space.
A subset N(0) of the vector space V is a neighborhood of the zero element if there
exists a basis u1,u2,...,un for V such that
B(u1,...,un) ⊂N(0).
Further, a subset N(w) ⊂V is a neighborhood of the point w ∈V if the set
N = {v ∈V : v + wN(w)}
is a neighborhood of the zero element. Alternatively, this implies that a set is a
neighborhood of zero provided that one of its subsets is the unit ball in some basis
element.

9.1.4 Convex Sets
A set M ⊂ℜn is said to be open if every vector x ∈M, there is an ε-neighborhood
of x
N(x,ε) = {z ∈ℜn| ∥z −x∥< ε}
such that N(x,ε) ⊂M.
A set is closed iff its complement in ℜn is open; bounded if there r > 0 such
that ∥x∥< r, ∀x ∈S; and compact if it is closed and bounded; convex if for every
x,y ∈S, and every real number α, 0 < α < 1, the point α x + (1 −α) x ∈S.
Let us now deﬁne the line segment that joins two points in V. Suppose that
v1,v2 ∈V, then we deﬁne the line segment L(v1,v2) between them as the set of
points
L(v1,v2) = {v ∈V : v = μv1 + (1 −μ)v2, for some μ ∈[0,1]}.
Clearly the end points of the line segment are v1 and v2, which occur in the
parametrization when μ = 1 and μ = 0, respectively. We can now turn to the idea
of convexity. Suppose that K is a nonempty subset of the vector space V. Then K is
deﬁned to be convex set if for any v1,v2 ∈K, the line segment L(v1,v2) is a subset
of K, see Fig. 9.1. This simply means that given two points in a convex set, the line
segment between them is also in the set. Note in particular that subspaces and linear
varieties (a linear variety is a translation of linear subspaces) are convex. Also the
empty set is considered convex. Clearly any vector space is convex, as is any subset
{ν} of a vector space containing only a single element. Consider the expression
v = μ1v1 + ··· + μnvn,
μ1 + ··· + μn = 1
which provides a clear generalization to an average of n points v1,...,vn. Extending
this further, the generalization of the line segment between two points to n points
yields a point inside the perimeter deﬁned by the points v1,...,vn. This is illustrated
in Fig. 9.2.
Building on this intuition from ℜ2, we extend the idea to an arbitrary
vector space V. Given v1,...,vn we deﬁne the convex hull of these points by
con({v1,...,vn}) =

v ∈V : v =
n

k=1
μkvk, μk ∈[0,1],
n

k=1
μk = 1

.
With reference to Fig. 9.2 this set is made of the points inside the perimeter, that is,
the convex hull of the points v1,...,vn is simply the set composed of all weighted
averages of these points. In particular, we have that for two points
L(v1,v2) = con({v1,vn}).

nonconvex (right) sets

Fig. 9.2 Convex hull of ﬁnite
number of points in ℜ2
Fig. 9.3 Convex hull of a
set R
It is not difﬁcult to show that if R is convex, then it necessarily contains any convex
hull formed from a collection of its points. Generalizing this to an arbitrary set.
Given a set R, we deﬁne its convex hull con(R) by
con(R) = {v ∈V : there exist n and {v1,...,vn} ∈R
such that v ∈con({v1,...,vn})}.
In brief, the convex hull of R is the collection of all possible weighted averages of
points in R.
The following facts provide important properties for convex sets and convex
hull.
1. Let Cj, j = 1,...,m be a family of m convex sets in ℜn. Then the intersection
C1 ∩C2 ∩··· ∩Cm is convex.
2. Let C be a convex set in ℜn and x0 ∈ℜn. Then the set {x0 + x : x ∈C} is convex.
3. A set K ⊂ℜn is said to be convex cone with vertex x0 if K is convex and x ∈K
implies that x0 + λx ∈K for any λ ≥0.
4. The subset condition R ⊂con(R) is satisﬁed.
5. The convex hull con(R) is convex.
6. The relationship con(R) = con(con(R)) holds.
7. A set R is convex if and only if con(R) = R is satisﬁed, see Fig. 9.3.
An important class of convex cones is the one deﬁned by the positive semideﬁnite
ordering of matrices, that is, A1 ≥A2 ≥A3. Let P ∈ℜn×n be a positive semideﬁnite
matrix. The set of matrices X ∈ℜn×n such that X ≥P is a convex cone in ℜn×n.

9.1.5 Continuous Functions
A function f : ℜn →ℜm is said to be continuous at a point x if f (x + δx) →f (x)
whenever δx →0. Equivalently, f is continuous at x if, given ε > 0, there is δ > 0
such that
∥x −y∥< ε
⇒
∥f () −f (y)∥< ε.
A function f is continuous on a set of S if it is a continuous at every point of S,
and it is uniformly continuous on S if given ε > 0, there is δ(ε) > 0 (dependent only
on ε), such that the inequality holds for all x,y ∈S
A function f : ℜ→ℜis said to be differentiable at a point x if the limit
˙f (x) = lim
δx→0
f (x + δx) −f (x)
δx
exists. A function f : ℜn →ℜm is continuously differentiable at a point x (a set S)
if the partial derivatives ∂fj/∂xs exist and continuous at x (at every point of S) for
1 ≤j ≤m, 1 ≤s ≤n and the Jacobian matrix is deﬁned as

9.1.6 Function Norms
Let f (t) : ℜ+ →ℜbe a continuous function or piecewise continuous function. The
p-norm of f is deﬁned by
∥f ∥p =
 ∞
0
|f (t)|pdt
1/p
,
for p ∈[1,∞),
∥f ∥∞=
sup
t∈[0,∞)
|f (t)|,
for p = ∞.
By letting p = 1,2,∞, the corresponding normed spaces are called L1, L2, L∞,
respectively. More precisely, let f (t) be a function on [0,∞) of the signal spaces,
they are deﬁned as
L1 ≜

f (t) : ℜ+ −→ℜ

From a signal point of view, the 1-norm, ∥x∥1 of the signal x(t) is the integral
of its absolute value, the square ∥x∥2
2 of the 2-norm is often called the energy of

the signal x(t), and the ∞-norm is its absolute maximum amplitude or peak value.
It must be emphasized that the deﬁnitions of the norms for vector functions are not
unique.
In the case of f (t) : ℜ+ →ℜn, f (t) = [f1(t) f2(t) ... fn(t)]t which denote
a continuous function or piecewise continuous vector function, the corresponding
p-norm spaces are deﬁned as

9.1.7 Mean Value Theorem
Assume that f : ℜn →ℜis continuously differentiable at each point x of an open
set S ⊂ℜn. Let x and y be two points of S such that
L(x,y) = {z | z = θx + (1 −θ)y,0 < θ < 1} ⊂S,
where L(x,y) is a line segment connecting x and y. Then there exists a point z of
L(x,y) such that
f (y) −f (x) = ∂f
∂x

x=z
(y −x).
9.1.8 Implicit Function Theorem
Assume that f : ℜn × ℜm →ℜn is continuously differentiable at each point (x,y)
of an open set S ⊂ℜn × ℜm. Let (x0,y0) be a point in S for which f (x0,y0) = 0
and for which the Jacobian matrix [∂f/∂x](x0,y0) is nonsingular. Then there exist
neighborhoods U ⊂ℜn of x0 and V ⊂ℜm of y0 such that for each y ∈V the equa-
tion f (x,y) = 0 has a unique solution x ∈U. Moreover, this solution can be given
as x = g(y), where g is continuously differentiable at y = y0.
For a detailed account of the foregoing two theorems, the reader is referred to [1].
9.2 Matrix Theory
In this section, we focus on matrix theory and solicit some basic facts and useful
relations from linear algebra and calculus of matrices. The material are stated along
with some hints whenever needed but without proofs unless we see the beneﬁt of
providing a proof. We start by introducing the concept of a linear mapping between

518

vector spaces. The mapping M : V →W is linear if
M(αv1 + βv2) = αMv1 + βMv2
for all v1,v2 ∈V and all scalars α and β. Here V and W are vector spaces with the
same associated ﬁled F. The space V is called the domain of the mapping, and W
its codomain.
Given bases {v1,v2,...,vn} and {w1,w2,...,wn} for V and W, respectively, we
associate scalars mjk with the mapping M, deﬁning them such that they satisfy
Mvk = m1kw1 + m2kw2 + ··· + mmkwm
for each 1 ≤k ≤n. Namely, given any basis vector vk, the coefﬁcients are the coor-
dinates of Mvk in the selected basis of W. It turns out that these mn numbers mjk
completely specify the linear mapping M. To see this is true, consider any vector
v ∈V, and let w = Mv. We can express both vectors in their respective bases as
v = α1v1 + α2v2 + ··· + αnvn,
w = β1w1 + β2w2 + ··· + βmwm.
Now we have
w = Mv = M(α1v1 + α2v2 + ··· + αnvn)
= α1Mv1 + α2Mv2 + ··· + αnMvn

and therefore by uniqueness of the coordinates we must have

j = 1,...,m.
To express this relationship in a more convenient form, can write the set of numbers
mjk as the m × n matrix
[M] =
⎡
⎢⎣
m11
...
m1n
...
...
...
mm1
...
mmn
⎤
⎥⎦.
Then via the standard matrix product, we have
⎡
⎢⎣

m1n

⎢⎣

⎥⎦.
In summary any linear mapping M between vector spaces can be regarded as a ma-
trix M mapping ℜn to ℜm via matrix multiplication. It should be noted that the

9.2

519
numbers mjk depend intimately on the bases {v1,v2,...,vn} and {w1,w2,...,wn}.
Frequently we use only one basis for V and one for W and thus there is need to
distinguish between the map M and the basis dependent matrix [A]. We will hence-
forth write M to denote either the map or the matrix, making which is meant context
dependent.
When reference is made to matrix function M(t), we have the form:
M(t) =
⎡

m11(t)

m1n(t)

mm1(t)

9.2.1 Fundamental Subspaces
Building upon the foregoing section, the idea now is to introduce four important
subspaces which are useful. The entire linear vector space of a speciﬁc problem can
be decomposed into the sum of these subspaces.
The column space of a matrix A ∈ℜn×m is the space spanned by the columns of
A, is also called the range space of A, denoted by R[A]. Similarly, the row space
of A is the space spanned by the rows of A. Since the column rank of a matrix is the
dimension of the space spanned by the columns and the row rank is the dimension
of the space spanned by the rows, it is clear that the spaces R[A] and R[At] have
the same dimension r = rank(A).
The right null space of A ∈ℜn×m is the space spanned by all vectors x that
satisfy Ax = 0, and is denoted N[A]. The right null space of A is also called the
kernel of A. The left null space of A is the space spanned by all vectors y that satisfy
ytA = 0. This space is denoted N[At], since it is also characterized by all vectors y
such that Aty = 0.
The dimensions of the four spaces R[A], R[At], N[A] and N[At] are to be
determined in the sequel. Since A ∈ℜn×m, we have the following
r ≜rank(A) = dimension of column space R[A],
dimN[A] ≜dimension of right null space N[A],
n ≜total number of columns of A.
Hence the dimension of the null space dimN[A] = n −r. Using the fact that
rank(A) = rank(At), we have
r ≜rank(At) = dimension of row space R[At],
dimN[At] ≜dimension of left null space N[At],
m ≜total number of rows of A.

Hence the dimension of the null space dimN[At] = m −r. These facts are sum-
marized below
R[At] ≜row space of A: dimension r,
N[A] ≜right null space of A: dimension n −r,
R[A] ≜column space of A: dimension r,
N[At] ≜left null space of A: dimension n −r.
Note from these facts that the entire n-dimensional space can be decomposed
into the sum of the two subspaces R[At] and N[A]. Alternatively, the entire
m-dimensional space can be decomposed into the sum of the two subspaces R[A]
and N[At].
An important property is that N[A] and R[At] are orthogonal subspaces, that
is, R[At]⊥= N[A]. This has the meaning that every vector in N[A] is orthogonal
to every vector in R[At]. In the same manner, R[A] and N[At] are orthogonal
subspaces, that is, R[A]⊥= N[At]. The construction of the fundamental subspaces
is appropriately attained by the singular value decomposition.
9.2.2 Change of Basis and Invariance
Suppose that {v1,v2,...,vn} is chosen as a basis for V. Then any vector x ∈V,
there are unique scalars xv = {α1,α2,...,αn} ∈ℜn such that x = α1v1 + α2v2 +
··· + αnvn. In turn, this raises the question: how can we effectively move between
this basis and another basis {u1,u2,...,un} for V? That is, given x ∈V, how are the
coordinate vectors xv,xu ∈ℜn related? To answer this question, suppose that each
vector uk is expressed by
uk = t1kv1 + t2kv2 + ··· + tmkvm
in the basis {v1,v2,...,vn}. Then the coefﬁcients tjk deﬁne the matrix
T =
⎡
⎢⎣
t11
...
t1n
...
...
...
tn1
...
tnn
⎤
⎥⎦
which is obviously nonsingular since it represents the identity mapping IV in the
bases {v1,v2,...,vn} and {u1,u2,...,un}. Then the relationship between the two
coordinate vectors is
T xu = xv.
Now suppose that M : V →V and that Mv : ℜn →ℜn is the representation of
M on the basis {v1,v2,...,vn} and Mu is the representation of M on the basis
{u1,u2,...,un}. How is Mu related to Mv?

9.2
Matrix Theory
521
To examine this, take any x ∈V and let xv, xu be its coordinates in the respective
bases, and zv, zu be the coordinates of Ax. Then we have
zu = T −1zv = T −1Avxv = T −1AvT xu.
Since the above identity and
zu = Auxu
both hold for every xu, we conclude that
Au = T −1AvT
which is frequently called a similarity transformation.
Now the notion of invariance of a subspace to a mapping is presented. We say
that a subspace S ⊂V is M-invariant if M : V →V and
MS ⊂S.
It is readily seen that every map has at least two invariant subspaces, the zero sub-
space and entire domain V. For subspaces S of intermediate dimension, the invari-
ance property is expressed most clearly by saying the associate matrix has the form
[M] =
M1
M2
0
M4
	
,
where we assumed that our basis for V is obtained by extending a basis for S.
9.2.3 Calculus of Vector-Matrix Functions of a Scalar
The differentiation and integration of time functions involving vectors and matrices
arises in solving state equations, optimal control and so on. This section summa-
rizes the basic deﬁnitions of differentiation and integration on vectors and matrices.
A number of formulas for the derivative of vector-matrix products are also included.
The derivative of a matrix function M(t) of a scalar is the matrix of the deriva-
tives of each element in the matrix

The scalar derivative of the product of two matrix time-functions is
d(A(t)B(t))
dt
= A(t)
dt B(t) + A(t)B(t)
dt .
This result is analogous to the derivative of a product of two scalar functions of a
scalar, except caution must be used in reserving the order of the product. An impor-
tant special case follows:
The scalar derivative of the inverse of a matrix time-function is
dA−1(t)
dt
= −A−1 A(t)
dt A(t).
9.2.4 Derivatives of Vector-Matrix Products

A vector function of a vector is given by
v(u) =
⎡
⎢⎣
v1(u)

where vj(u) is a function of the vector u. The derivative of a vector function of a

9.2.5 Positive Deﬁnite and Positive Semideﬁnite Matrices
A matrix P is positive deﬁnite if P is real, symmetric and xtPx > 0, ∀x ̸= 0. Equiv-
alently, if all the eigenvalues of P have positive real parts. A matrix S is positive
semideﬁnite if S is real, symmetric and xtPx ≥0, ∀x ̸= 0.
Since the deﬁniteness of the scalar xtPx is a property only of the matrix P , we
need a test for determining deﬁniteness of a constant matrix P . Deﬁne a principal

submatrix of a square matrix P as any square submatrix sharing some diagonal ele-
ments of P . Thus the constant, real, symmetric matrix P ∈ℜn×n is positive deﬁnite
(P > 0) if either of these equivalent conditions holds:
• All eigenvalues of P are positive
• The determinant of P is positive
• All successive principal submatrices of P (minors of successively increasing size)
have positive determinants
9.2.6 Matrix Ellipsoid

.
This set is called a matrix ellipsoid. Some of the relevant properties are
• The matrix ellipsoid can be written as
(K −Ko)Z(K −Ko)t ≤R,
where R is the radius and Ko = −YZ−1 is the center of the ellipsoid.
• A matrix ellipsoid is nonempty if and only if the radius R = YZ−1Y t −X ≥0.
• If X = YZ−1Y t the matrix ellipsoid is a singleton.
• A matrix ellipsoid is a compact convex set.
9.2.7 Power of a Square Matrix
For positive m, Am for a square matrix A is deﬁned as AA···A, with m terms in the
product. For negative m, let m = −n, where n is positive; Am = (A1−)n. It follows
that ApAq = Ap+q, for any integers p and q, positive or negative, and likewise that
(Ap)q = Apq.
A polynomial in A is a matrix p(A) = m
j=1 αjAj, where the αj are scalars.
Any two polynomials is the same matrix commute—that is,
p(A)q(A) = q(A)p(A),
where p and q are polynomials. It follows that
p(A)q−1(A) = q−1(A)p(A)
and that such rational functions of A also commute.

9.2.8 Exponential of a Square Matrix
Let A be a square matrix. Then it can shown that the series
I + A + 1
2!A2 + 1
3!A3 + ···
converges, in the sense that the (j −k)th entry of the partial sums of the series
converges for all j and k. The sum is deﬁned as eA. It follows that
eAt = I + At + 1
2!A2t2 + 1
3!A3t3 + ···.
Moreover,
p(A)eAt = eAtp(A)
for any polynomial A, and e−At = [eAt]−1.
9.2.9 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of a Square Matrix
Let A be an n × n matrix. The polynomial det[sI −A] is termed the characteristic
polynomial of A and the zeros of this polynomial are the eigenvalues of matrix A.
If λj is an eigenvalue of A, there always exists a least one vector x satisfying
Ax = λjx.
The vector x is termed an eigenvector of matrix A. If λj is not a repeated eigenvalue-
that is, if it is a simple zero of the characteristic polynomial, to within a scalar
multiple x is unique. If not, there may be more than one eigenvector associated
with λj. If λj is real, the entries of x are real, whereas if λj is complex, the entries
of x are complex.
If A has zero entries everywhere off the main diagonal—that is, if ajk for all
j, k, j ̸= k, the A is termed diagonal. It follows trivially from the deﬁnition of an
eigenvalue that the diagonal entries of the diagonal A are precisely the eigenvalues
of A.
It is also true that for a general matrix A,
det(A) =
n

j=1
λj.
If A is singular, A possesses at least one zero eigenvalue.
The eigenvalues of a rational function r(A) of A are the numbers r(λj), where
λj are the eigenvalues of A. For example, the eigenvalues of eAt are eλjt.

9.2.10 The Cayley-Hamiltonian Theorem
A formal deﬁnition of the Cayley-Hamiltonian theorem is that Every square matrix
satisﬁes its own characteristic equation. Let A be a square matrix, and let
det[sI −A] = sn + α1sn−1 + ··· + αn
then
An + α1An−1 + ··· + αnI = 0.
From the Cayley-Hamiltonian theorem, it follows that any analytic function f (A)
of A are expressible as a linear combination of {I,A,An−1}—that is, Am for any
m ≥n and eA.
9.2.11 Trace Properties
The trace of a square matrix P , trace(P), equals the sum of its diagonal elements
or equivalently the sum of its eigenvalues. A basic property of the trace is invariant
under cyclic perturbations, that is,
trace(AB) = trace(BA),
where AB is square. Successive applications of the above results yield
trace(ABC) = trace(BCA) = trace(CAB),
where ABC is square. In general,
trace(AB) = trace(BtAt).
Another result is that
trace(AtBA) =

and written C = A ⊗B is termed the Kronecker product of matrices A and B. In
case A and B are square, the set of eigenvalues of C is given by λj(A)λk(B), ∀j,k.
The Kronecker product is associative-that is,
(A ⊗B)(C ⊗D) = AC ⊗BD,
(A ⊗B)t = At ⊗Bt.
Let A ∈ℜm×n. The column mn-vector, obtained by stacking column 2 of A after
column 1, column 3 of A after column 2, and so forth, is termed vecA.
If M,N are matrices for which the product MN can be formed, then
vec(MN) = [I ⊗M]vecN
= [Nt ⊗I]vecM.
9.2.13 Partitioned Matrices

M =

D
	
where A, B, C and D are of compatible dimensions. Then:
(1) if A−1 exists, a Schur complement of M is deﬁned as D −CA−1B, and
(2) if D−1 exists, a Schur complement of M is deﬁned as A −BD−1C.
When A, B, C and D are all n × n matrices, then:

det(Im −AB) = det(In −BA).
In case that A is invertible, then det(A−1) = det(A)−1.

For a square matrix Y, the matrices Y and (I +Y)−1 commute, that is, given that

Y(I + Y)−1 = (I + Y)−1Y.
Two additional inversion formulas are given below
Y(I + XY)−1 = (I + YX)−1Y,
(I + YX)−1 = I −YX(I + YX)−1.

9.2.16 The Singular Value Decomposition
The singular value decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization that has found a
number of applications to engineering problems. The SVD of a matrix M ∈ℜn×m
is
M = USV † =
p

j=1
σjUjV †
j ,
where U ∈ℜα×α and V ∈ℜβ×β are unitary matrices (U†U = UU † = I and
V †V = V V †I); S ∈ℜα×β is a real, diagonal (but not necessarily square); and
p = min(α,β). The singular values {σ1,σ2,...,σβ} of M are deﬁned as the posi-
tive square roots of the diagonal elements of StS, and are ordered from largest to
smallest.
To proceed further, we recall a result on unitary matrices. If U is a unitary matrix
(U †U = I), then the transformation U preserves length, that is:
∥Ux∥=

(Ux)†(Ux) =

x†U†Ux,
=

x†x = ∥x∥.
As a consequence, we have
∥Mx∥=

x†M†Mx =

x†V StU†USV †x,
=

x†V StSV †x.
To evaluate the maximum gain of matrix M, we calculate the maximum norm of the
above equation to yield
max
∥x∥=1∥Mx∥= max
∥x∥=1

x†V StSV †x = max
∥˜x∥=1

˜x†V StS ˜x.

Some Bounding Inequalities

Note that maximization over ˜x = V x is equivalent to maximizing over x since
V is invertible and preserves the norm (equals 1 in this case). Expanding the norm
yield

∥˜x∥=1

The foregoing expression is maximized, given the constraint ∥˜x∥= 1, when ˜x is
concentrated at the largest singular value; that is |˜x| = [1 0 ... 0]t. The maximum
gain is then
max
∥x∥=1∥Mx∥=

σ 2

9.3 Some Bounding Inequalities
In the sequel, all mathematical inequalities are proved for completeness. They are
termed facts afterwards due to their high frequency of usage in the analytical devel-
opments.

For any real vectors β, ρ and any matrix Qt = Q > 0 with appropriate dimensions,
it follows that
−2ρtβ ≤ρtQρ + βtQ−1β.

For any quantities u and v of equal dimensions and for all ηt = i ∈S, it follows that
the following inequality holds
∥u + v∥2 ≤[1 + β−1]∥u∥2 + [1 + β]∥v∥2
(9.1)
for any scalar β > 0, i ∈S.
Proof Since
[u + v]t[u + v] = utu + vtv + 2utv,
(9.2)
it follows by taking norm of both sides of (9.2) for all i ∈S that
∥u + v∥2 ≤∥u∥2 + ∥v∥2 + 2∥utv∥.
(9.3)
We know from the triangle inequality that
2∥utv∥≤β−1∥u∥2 + β∥v∥2.

2 as follows
Ω =

We have the following results:
(A) Ω ≥0 if and only if either

Ω2 ≥0,
Π = Υ Ω2,
Ω1 −Υ Ω2Υ t ≥0
(9.5)
or

Ω1 ≥0,
Π = Ω1Λ,
Ω2 −ΛtΩ1Λ ≥0

hold where Λ, Υ are some matrices of compatible dimensions.
(B) Ω > 0 if and only if either

Ω2 > 0,
Ω1 −Ω3Ω−1
2 Ωt
3 > 0
or

Ω1 ≥0,
Ω2 −Ωt
3Ω−1
1 Ω3 > 0
hold where Λ, Υ are some matrices of compatible dimensions.
In this regard, matrix Ω1 −Ω3Ω−1
2 Ωt
3 (Ω2 −Ωt
3Ω−1
1 Ω3) is often called the
Schur complement of Ω2 (of Ω1) in Ω.
Proof (A) To prove (9.5), we ﬁrst note that Ω2 ≥0 is necessary. Let zt = [zt
1 zt
2] be
a vector partitioned in accordance with Ω. Thus we have
ztΩz = zt
1Ω1z1 + 2zt
1Ω3z2 + zt
2Ω2z2.
(9.7)
Select z2 such that Ω2z2 = 0. If Ω3z2 ̸= 0, let z1 = −πΩ3z2, π > 0. Then it follows
that
ztΩz = π2zt
2Ωt
3Ω1Ω3z2 −2πzt
2Ωt

which is negative for a sufﬁciently small π > 0. We thus conclude Ω1z2 = 0 which
then leads to Ω3z2 = 0, ∀z2 and consequently
Ω3 = Υ Ω2
(9.8)
for some Υ .
Since Ω ≥0, the quadratic term ztΩz possesses a minimum over z2 for any z1.
By differentiating ztΩz from (9.7) wrt zt
2, we get
∂(ztΩz)
∂zt
2
= 2Ωt
3z1 + 2Ω2z2 = 2Ω2Υ tz1 + 2Ω2z2.
Setting the derivative to zero yields
Ω2Υ z1 = −Ω2z2
(9.9)
Using (9.8) and (9.9) in (9.7), it follows that the minimum of ztΩz over z2 for any
z1 is given by
min
z2 ztΩz = zt
1[Ω1 −Υ Ω2Υ t]z1
which proves the necessity of Ω1 −Υ Ω2Υ t ≥0.
On the other hand, we note that the conditions (9.5) are necessary for Ω ≥0 and
since together they imply that the minimum of ztΩz over z2 for any z1 is nonnega-
tive, they are also sufﬁcient.
Using similar argument, conditions (9.6) can be derived as those of (9.5) by start-
ing with Ω1.
The proof of (B) follows as direct corollary of (A).

9.7 Stability Theorems
9.7.1 Lyapunov-Razumikhin Theorem
Here the idea is based on the following argument: because the future states of the
system depend on the current and past states’ values the Lyapunov function should
become functional—more details in Lyapunov Krasovskii method—which may
complicate the condition formulation and the analysis. To avoid using functional;
Razumakhin made his theorem which is based on formulating Lyapunov functions
not functionals. First one should build a Lyapunov function V (x(t)) which is zero
when x(t) = 0 and positive otherwise, then the theorem does not require ˙V < 0 al-
ways but only when the V (x(t)) for the current state becomes equals to ¯V which is
given by
¯V =
max
θ∈[−τ,0]V (x(t + θ))
(9.21)
the theorem statement is given by ([4]):
Lyapunov-Razumikhin Theorem Suppose f is a functional that takes time t and
initial values xt and gives a vector of n states ˙x and u,v,w are class K functions
u(s) and v(s) are positive for s > 0 and u(0) = v(0) = 0, v is strictly increasing. If
there exists a continuously differentiable function V : ℜ× ℜn →ℜsuch that
u(∥x∥) ≤V (t,x) ≤v(∥x∥)
(9.22)
and the time derivative of V along the solution x(t) satisﬁes ˙V (t,x) ≤−w(∥x∥)
whenever V (t + θ,x(t + θ)) ≤V (t,x(t))θ ∈[−τ,0], then the system is uniformly
stable.
If in addition w(s) > 0 for s > 0 and there exists a continuous non-decreasing
function p(s) > s for s > 0 such that ˙V (t,x) ≤−w(∥x∥) whenever V (t + θ,x(t +
θ)) ≤p(V (t,x(t))) for θ ∈[−τ,0], then the system is uniformly asymptotically
stable. If in addition limu(s)s→∞= ∞then the system is globally asymptotically
stable.

9.7
Stability Theorems
541
The argument behind the theorem is like this: ¯V is serving as a measure for the
V in the interval t −τ to t then if V (x(t)) is less than ¯V then it’s not necessary that
˙V < 0, but if V (x(t)) becomes equals to ¯V then ˙V should be < 0 such that V will
not grow.
The procedure can be explained more by the following discussion: consider sys-
tem and a selected Lyapunov function V (x) which is positive semi-deﬁnite. By
taking the time derivative of this Lyapunov function we get ˙V . According to Razu-
mikhin theorem this term does not always need to be negative, but if we added the
following term a(V (x) −V (xt)), a > 0 to ˙V then the term
˙V + a(V (x) −V (xt))
(9.23)
should always be negative. Then by looking at this term we ﬁnd that this condi-
tion is satisﬁed if ˙V < 0 and V (x) ≤V (xt) meaning that the system states are not
growing in magnitude and it is approaching the origin (stable system). Or whenever
a(V (x) < V (xt)) and ˙V > 0 but ˙V < |a(V (x)−V (xt))| then although ˙V is positive
and states are increasing but the Lyapunov function is limited by an upper bound and
it will not grow without limit. The third case is that both of them are negative and
it’s clear that it is stable. This condition insures uniformly stability meaning that the
states may not reach the origin but it is contained is a domain say ε which obey the
primary deﬁnition of the stability. To extends this theorem for asymptotic stability
we can consider adding the term p(V (x(t))) −V (xt) where p(.) is a function that
has the following characteristics
p(s) > s
and then the condition becomes
˙V + a(p(V (x(t))) −V (xt)) < 0,
a > 0.
(9.24)
By this when the system reaches some value which make p(V (x(t))) = V (xt) re-
quires ˙V to be negative but at this instant V (x(t) < V (xt) then in the coming τ
interval the V (x) will never reaches V (xt) and the maximum value in this interval
is the new V (xt) which is less than the previous value and with the time the function
keeps decreasing until the states reach the origin.
9.7.2 Lyapunov-Krasovskii Theorem
The Razumikhin theorem attempts to construct Lyapunov function while Lyapunov-
Krasovskii uses functionals because V which can be considered as an indicator for
the internal power in the system is function of xt , then it’s logically to consider V
which is a function of function and hence a functional. The terms of V (xt) should
contains terms for the x in the interval (t −τ) to t and ˙V should be < 0 to ensure
asymptotic stability. This method will be covered in more detail in a next section.
In many cases, Lyapunov-Razumikhin can be found as a special case of
Lyapunov-Krasovskii which make the former more conservative. Lyapunov-Kra-
sovskii method tries to build a Lyapunov functional which is function in xt and

542
9
Mathematical Tools
the time derivative of this Lyapunov function should be negative for the system
to be stable. Previously there were criticism on Lyapunov-Krasovskii that it can
be used for system with the third category of delay mentioned in Sect. 2.2.2 only
when ˙τ ≤μ ≤1, but the recent results resolve this problem as we see next chapter.
Another criticism is that the Krasovskii methods can not deal with delay in the sec-
ond category but also the recent results in this method succeed to include this case
[3]. The remaining advantage of the Razumikhin method is its simplicity, but the
Krasovskii method proved to give less conservative results, the thing that gives it the
interest of most of the researchers in the recent years. Before going to the theorem
we have to deﬁne the following notations
φ = xt,
(9.25)
∥φ∥c =
max
θ∈[−τ,0]x(t + θ).
Lyapunov-Krasovskii Theorem ([4]) Suppose f is a functional that takes time t
and initial values xt and gives a vector of n states ˙x and u,v,w are class K functions
u(s) and v(s) are positive for s > 0 and u(0) = v(0) = 0, v is strictly increasing. If
there exists a continuously differentiable function V : ℜ× ℜn →ℜsuch that
u(∥φ∥) ≤V (t,x) ≤v(∥φ∥c)
(9.26)
and the time derivative of V along the solution x(t) satisﬁes
˙V (t,x) ≤−w(∥φ∥)
for θ ∈[−τ,0]
then the system is uniformly stable. If in addition w(s) > 0 for s > 0 then the system
is uniformly asymptotically stable. If in addition lim u(s)s→∞= ∞then the system
is globally asymptotically stable.
It’s clear that V is a functional and ˙V should always be negative.

time invariant system with multiple discrete time delay which is given by [4]
˙x(t) = Aox(t) +
m

j=1
Ajx(t −hj),

This theorem were found by trying to imitate the situation of delay free systems by
ﬁnding the state transition matrix and then use it to ﬁnd P that make
x′(t)(PA + A′P)x(t) = −Q,
Q > 0, P > 0.
This Lyapunov functional gives a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for the sys-
tem stability; but ﬁnding the U for this equation is very difﬁcult “and involves solv-
ing algebraic ordinary and partial differential equations with appropriate boundary
conditions which is obviously unpromising” [4]. And even if we can ﬁnd this U;
the resulting functional leads to a complicated system of partial differential equa-
tions yielding inﬁnite dimension LMI. That is why many authors considered special
forms of it and thus derived simpler but more conservative, sufﬁcient conditions
which can be represented by appropriate set of LMIs.
This is the case for LTI system with ﬁxed time delay then considering time vary-
ing delay or generally nonlinear system make it more difﬁcult. But looking at these
terms one can have idea about the possible terms which can be used in the simpliﬁed
functional.
9.7.3 Halany Theorem
The following fundamental result plays an important role in the stability analysis of
time-delay systems. Suppose that constant scalars k1 and k2 satisfy k1 > k2 > 0 and
y(t) is a non-negative continuous function on [to −τ,to] satisfying
dy(t)
dt
≤−k1y(t) + k2 ¯y(t)
(9.30)
for t ≥t0, where τ ≥0 and
¯y(t) =
sup
t−τ≤s≤t
{y(s)}.
Then, for t ≥t0, we have
y(t) ≤¯y(t0)exp(−σ(t −t0)),
where σ > 0 is the unique solution of the following equation
σ = k1 −k2 exp(στ).
It must be emphasized that Lyapunov-Krasovskii theorem, Lyapunov-Razumi-
khin theorem and Halanay theorem can be effectively used to derive stability con-
ditions when the time-delay is time-varying, continuous but not necessarily differ-
entiable. Experience and the available literature show that the Lyapunov-Krasovskii
theorem is more usable particularly for obtaining delay-dependent stability and sta-
bilization conditions.

are weighting matrices of appropriate dimensions. Consider now a class of discrete-
time systems with interval-like time-delays can be described by:
x(k + 1) = Aσx(k) + Dσx(k −dk) + Γσ ω(k),
(9.39)
z(k) = Cσx(k) + Gσ x(k −dk) + Σσω(k),
where x(k) ∈ℜn is the state, z(k) ∈ℜq is the controlled output and ω(k) ∈ℜp is
the external disturbance which is assumed to belong to ℓ2[0,∞). In the sequel, it is
assumed that dk is time-varying and satisfying
dm ≤dk ≤dM,
(9.40)
where the bounds dm > 0 and dM > 0 are constant scalars. The system matrices
containing uncertainties which belong to a real convex bounded polytopic model of

Deﬁne the vertex set N = {1,...,N}. We use {A,...,Σ} to imply generic system
matrices and {Aj,...,Σj, j ∈N} to represent the respective values at the vertices.
In what follows, we provide a deﬁnition of exponential stability of system (9.39):
A straightforward computation gives the ﬁrst-difference of ΔV (k) = V (k + 1)−
V (k) along the solutions of (9.39) with ω(k) ≡0 as:
