ﬂicking through the old YCs and Your Commodores that I was
connected with. Did you know that since we changed our name and
style, we've given you (including this issue) 2 free demos, 1 free utility,
and 27 free games. And did you know that we've reviewed 147 games
(on average 18.375 games per issue), and all this is on the C64 only,
you get the best service here.
But enough twiddle twaddle and onto some real JUICY subjects.
Now that everybody has gotten over the World Cup, what better thing
to talk about but the new football season! Here are my predictions for
the honours for the season 1990-91. Division One Champions:
Liverpool. FA Cup Winners: Liverpool. League Cup Winners: Liverpool.
Eurovision Song Contest Winners: Liverpool. They'll do the lot matey,
they'll do the lot.
And we've only got a couple of months until the end of the year
and I still haven't got a calender for this one yet, hurrn... I'll have to do
my shopping pretty fast. The YC Wobbly Awards for 1990 will be run
in January's copy, you can then vote for your favourite games.
Not an awful lot left to say apart from a couple of staff changes.
Ashley Cotter-Cairns is now my second in command, which still
means he makes the tea, and we welcome back an old face in the
form of Mark Newton, our old designer at Argus. His transfer fee has
only just gone through and he'll be doing his old thang on the
magazine in the future, probably.
I'm off for now, but keep your ears to the ground, a few big things
are happening and you're gonna want to be here when they happen.

Commodore has
joined the rest of
the computer world in
announcing a brand
spanking new console,
and this one is based
on our very own C64,
coo.
For those of us with
C64s this means very
little, apart from the
fact that companies will
now be producing
games on cartridge too,
at a pretty high price I
should imagine. The
console itself, you see,
has exactly the same
speciﬁcations as our
favourite machine but
without a keyboard,
just a dirty great slot in
the top to stick your
games.
For the outlay of
£99.99 you get the
machine itself, a
'games controller' (a
joystick to me and you),
and a four-game
cartridge containing
Klax, Fiendish Freddy's
Big Top OTun, Flimbo's
Quest and the old fave
International Soccer.
Another 100 new
cartridges are expected
before Christmas, and
these will slot in the
back of your C64 or
C128, if you could be
bothered.
So what does the
future hold? An Amiga
console? The eventual
phasing out of our
Corn my 64? A cartridge
stuck to the front of
YC? Who knows!
STUMP
COLLECTING t
Challenge
Software, most
famous for YC
Fun One's Treble
Champions and Cricket
Master, has now
announced yet another
cricket game, but this
time with the
sponsorship of that
world famous England
and Hampshire batsman,
Robin Smith, who?
Erm... Well, he's got
a beard and he played
rather well against the
West Indies in 1988, and
apparently he's got a
wonderful sense of
humour and is
respected in cricket
circles, er... yes!
And in order to
capture the market at
just about the right time,
Challenge is releasing
the game around...
Christmas, just when
the cricket season is in
full ﬂight? Yep, we're as
bafﬂed as everybody
else! It'll be a stonker of
a game though, if it's
any bit as good as all
the rest of Challenge's
games.

MAN YOO, MAN
YOO, ERM... MAN
YOO!
On Saturday
August 18th, our
own Rik and
Peter CaIver from
Audiogenic Software
took Alex Mead from
Brixham, South Devon
and his mother to the
Charity Shield at
Wembley. Why?
Because Alex had won
the Emlyn Hughes
compo that we ran in
the June edition of
your favourite
magazine.
Luckily Alex was a
Manchester United fan
and they all had a slap-
up meal and then sat in
ever-so-expensive
seats in order to watch
the team draw 1-1 with
Rik's team, Liverpool!
Great fun was had by
all apart from the fact
that they were in the
Manchester end, so
when Liverpool scored
Rik had to celebrate in
silence. A good result
on a brilliant day.

ARTY FARTY
So who's this
INGONEU geezer
then? What does
he do? Well, if you take
a look at some of the
artwork on this page I
think you'll get the idea.
Yes, that's it! He's an
artist.
But not an ordinary
artist, no siree.
INGONEU performs his
art on the Amiga ('aint
dat one of dem
expensive computers)
and prints it out using
an inkjet printer, and I
think you'll agree with
me that it is very
effective. It sort of gives
it a Cyberpunk effect.
He's recently had
exhibitions in West
Germany and Austria,
and some of his
paintings have been
sold for loads of cash
by an Austrian museum!
What we want to know
is, when is it going to
come here so we can
buy some with our YC
expenses? Erm... HOW
much?
IT'S THOSE DOMS
AGAIN
Who the blinking
ﬂip are these
two? Oh no, not
the Doms again? Oh
yes! And isn't that a
Lotus Esprit they're
standing in? Coo, things
are certainly looking
up in the world, so
much so that they
have even had to
take they're shoes off to
stand in the car, pooey!
All this malarky is in
order to promote the
latest bond game to
come from Dornark, The
Spy Who Loved Me, as
revealed in YC August
1990. Further news is
that the game will be
released in September
sometime and will cost
E9.99 on tape, and
E14.99 on disk.
Another September
release for Domark is
TNT, a compilation of
ﬁve Tengen titles. Hard
Drivin' (never released
on the C64), Toobin'
(Erm... Not too hot),
APB (pretty cool),
Dragon Spirit (Okay),
and Xybots (pretty hot
poopie stuff), are all on
it, and it must be worth
it to see why Hard
Drivin' was never
released alone. It'll be
E14.99 on tape, £19.99
disk.

BREEDING KIDS
Activision has
had a few, how
do we put this in
order to sound positive,
a few probs recently,
but not being ones to
lie down and winge the
company has two new
mega games coming
our way.
Dragon Breed is a
conversion of the
wicked !rem arcade
machine where you get
to ride a big, wobbly
dragon who is made up
of 13 segments to give
it an even more wobbly
effect. It is a sideways
scrolling cutesy game,

 Do you spend all
your dinner
money in the
local arcade? Do you
hang around the neon
houses looking for
cheap thrills? Do you
hassle your parents to
subsidise your
addiction? Well, here's
urther chance to do so
in the shape of a new
arcade.
Electrocoin, arcade
supremos and software
house, has opened a
new arcade on
Tottenham Court Road
NEW... ER...
OLD
DESIGNER
VC gets itself a
new designer in
the form of its old
designer Mark "I'm
NOT in a panic"
Newton. What
does this mean?
The team are
BACK in force!!!
And you'd better
believe it!
with a deﬁnite
Japanese feel, and if it
is any bit as good as
the coin-op we'll be
shouting yipee until the
cows come home!
Another big arcade
hit was Atomic
Robokid, and this too is
coming our way. There
are 21 levels of, also,
Japanese ﬂavoured fun
where you ﬂy, walk and
blast loads of meanies.
And you'll be able to
read the review of the
game in next issue!
Both will be
available in November
at the prices of E9.99
for tape, and E14.99 for
disk.
entitled the 'Casino
Leisure Centre'. The
company promises that
it will house the latest in
games, and the new
Neo Geo system, it will
even have some games
that'll take months to
appear anywhere else.
If you're in the West
End, pop along and
spend all of your cash,
it is indeed the only way
to preview games that'll
soon appear on your
Commy anyway.
It is based at 69
Tottenham Court Road,
right next door to
Goodge Street tube
station.

So what does the NIC review team like to eat in the
mornings, before they crawl out of the house...
Rik "Red Baron" Henderson
Rik likes Coco Pops because "they even turn the milk
brown", that and a can of coke, two packets of Monster
Munch, and couple of Tracker bars. When he was asked
why he was so slim he replied "Oh, I don't eat them, I rub it
on my chest to see if any hairs grow!"
Ashley "Tom Cruise" Cotter-Cairns
Ashley is a much more healthy breakfast man, liking Honey
Nut Loops, Kellog*s Raisin Splitz, Shreddies, Shredded
Wheat, Honey Puffs, and several other types of breakfast,
all in the SAME bucket!!!
Beverly "Snoopy" Gardner
Beverly is a more conservative breakfaster. She likes a
hand full of Refreshers and a can of caffeine-free coke.
Occasionally we see her munching on some bran ﬂakes,
but you're likely to catch her with a chocolate croissant in
her gob!
THE SKOREBOX
Each game is given different ratings in the form of a wonderful froody
skorebox (notice the change of letter from 'c to 6
even more fashionable).
Graphics (out of 10) - This is what we think the games appeal is
p r e s e n t a t i o n wis eandgraphically.
Sonic s (out of 10) • Does the music grate? Do the sound FX
c o m e acrossas realistic?
Fix Factor (out of 10)- This is what we think the instant appeal
of a game is like. Does it grab your attention straight away? Or is
it too hard to get into?
p4
Overall (out of 100) - This s the personal rating given by the reviewer
of how good they think the game is.
00-25 T h i s  game 15
would ever want to see it is for novelty value.
26-50 I n c r e d i b l y  dull, and not interesting in the slightest. Watch
'Hitman and Her and you'll get the general idea of what I'm talking
about.
51-75 N o t  too awful, and probably somebody's cup of tea,
although we'd rather stick to ginger beer.
76-84 
A
 good game with more going for it than most_ It'd be best
to check these ones out in the shop before you buy them.
85-99 G o  out and buy Immediately, these games are hot So hot
in fact that you'd be done for taking them into a no-smoking area. Any
game getting this score are announced as YO Fun Ones (the VC seal
of recommendation).
100
No game has
ever got this
rating, and any
game to ever get
this would be
the best that
anybody could
ever do on the
commy 64.
You'll know
when a game
this good comes
around because
all the games
players in the
world would
wander around
and bump into
lamposts and
things.

U.N.
SQUADRON
The Middle
East is not the
— m o s t  friendly of
places at the moment, and
according to U.N. Squadron
the World demands an end
to the bloodshed. Who do
they send? Well we don't
know, but we sent Rik!
US GOLD -
E9.99 Tape,
E14.99 Disk
T
Saddam Hussein munching
around the Middle East
provoking all kinds of hostilities and
US Gee decides to release a Middle
Eastern battle shoot-ern-up. But I
suppose it's not really their fault, I
mean it is an arcade conversion after
all and anyway there's not a single
mad dictator in sight, no British
hostages in hotels, or refugees
ﬂeeing to other countries. This time
there's a more evil force behind this
(if that is indeed possible).
The arms dealers (the guys who
make large and munchy weaponry
out of old cereal packets and
washing up liquid bottles, not people
who deal in sweaty limbs) have taken
over. This is because there looked
like an end to the civil war and
conﬂict that has been taking place in
the Middle East for many years (I
think it's a little worse now, don't
you?) and they can't have that,
nobody would buy their latest
megadeath machinery. So they've
built loads of big tanks and other
assorted nasty whatsits and they
plan to take over the entire world so
that people will have to buy their
assortment of weaponry from them
alone. O000... you can't trust
anybody these days, can you?
This is where the three bravest
men in the world come in. Not Larry,
Mo and Curly, but three pilots who
are willing to risk their bacon against
such evilness. There's Mickey Simon
in his F-14 Tomcat (a speedy little
number with big blasty guns), Shin
Kazama in the F-20 Tigershark (a
speedy little number with big blasty
guns), and Greg Gate in his A-10
Thunderbolt (a speedy little number
with big blasty guns), and they have
to ﬂy into the battle zone, kill just
about everything and ﬂy out again
without, hopefully, a scratch
(otherwise they'll probably have to
pay the geezers that they're ﬁghting
for new equipment).
How do they do this? With great
difﬁculty probably! But try they must
and try they most certainly will do. Or
at least you will, because surprise
surprise it's Cilia 'ere, you get to
New arms sir? How about some rather dashing legs too? A real
bargain, dare I say it a feat of human technology. No? Look, I've
gone out on a limb to get holds of these! I've stuck my neck out,
the least you could do is give me a hand! How about a ﬁsh ﬁnger?
Brakka,
brakka,
eat lead
raisens!

There's No Arm In It
Arms are not often found in second-hand shops, they
are normally kept in an armory, which is no mean feat.
Running around with your arms extended, and
whistling the tune to The Dam busters will not only
make you dizzy but will probably end up with you
locked in an institution, so it's probably not a very
good idea.

At the beginning of the game you
see three guys grinning cheesily
(they haven't seen what's coming up)
and you must choose one of them.
The plane rolls out onto the runway
and you ﬁnd yourself shoved out into
the action with a pea-shooter to fend
off the enemy. And it is here that you
realise that this is really a stock
shoot-em-up in theory. There are
waves of meanies that come towards
you, ground meanies that ﬁre
missiles up at you, icons to be
collected in order to later swap it for
better weaponry, and end-of-level
buggers that are several times bigger
than yourself, and essentially that is
about it.
But what makes a good shooty is

the gameplay, and U.N. Squadron
has oodles of that. The attack waves
are fast with a capital 'fas', and the
levels get very demanding indeed.
The extra weaponry, which you buy
in a shop at the end of each level,
allows you to do some really funky
ﬁghting, and there is the added
bonus of being able to have
simultaneous two player action (a bit
like Silkworm) with each player (with
his hands ﬁrmly grasped around his
joystick) taking the role of different
characters.
And the graphics are not half bad
either, with smooth scrolling and
speedy sprites, and the main end-of-
level guardians are very well drawn
indeedy. Sound is fair, and the entire
game, although offering very little
that is new, is a very good blasty.
Now run along and buy it you arcade
freaks you!!!

Got itchy ﬁngers? Bored
with genteel games and
ﬂight sims? Worry not
ortruit. The 64 had it's fair
share of classics over the
years and here with a
helping hand and a ready
trigger ﬁnger is Sean Kelly's
guide to some of the best
blastin ever released for
your mean machine.
W
That is a question that has
vexed many a philosopher
over the centuries. Well, this is a lie.
It's a bit a of stupid question really
cause the answers obvious. It's
anything that involves bugger all
brain power and crateloads of
joystick mashing. Oh, and killing
things too. There's got be lots of
things dying, exploding, bleeding,
having limbs ripped off or being
forcefully sufﬂed off their mortal coil
in some other equally violent but
entertaining manner. And a bit more
carnage on top of that for good
measure, otherwise it's no use. You
can be ﬂying along, walking or even
ﬂoating, but as long as everyone
around you is being blasted to bits,
it's a shoot em up.
So what makes a good Shoot 'Ern
Up?
Lots of killing, loud noises, big
aliens, massive levels, tons to do and
er t h a t ' s  about it.
So how can you tell it it's good?
Simple. Check out this guide. There
are several factors that contribute to
a good shoot *ern up, ﬁve of which
we will mark the games featured
here on.
GRAPHICS
Do the aliens look
menacing , or do they
look like they could be
given a good kicking by
the Accrington and
District over Seventies
Rambling Society and
Croquet Club before
they'd eaten their
Weetabix? It the answers
yes, then bin it.
GAB LAST
Uridium - One of the best shoot-em-ups in the world, probably!
SOUND
Do they sound like a bad
recording of someone
farting down a dodgy
telephone line, or is it a
case of 'Whoops there go
by eardrums. I don't
expect I'll ever see them
again matey' whenever
you blast one away. If it's
the latter, then the game's
passed it's aural exams.
SCROLLING
Although it doesn't
appear in every shoot'
em up ever, in those
where it does it's
mega important. What
we want here is
something smoother than
a Nat King Cole record,
as opposed to something
with more jerks hen the
Kylie Minogue fan club.
ENEMIES
There's nothing more
boring in a shoot 'em up
than aliens that are easy
peasy lemon squeezy to
beat cause they always
follow the same ﬂight
pattern, or cause you
only get two on a screen
at any one time. What we
want is seventy two
thousand aliens, all
heading for your ship,
C,—
and all ﬁring homing
missiles at you. That way,
when you clear a screen
of them, your mates fall
worshipping at your feet
rather than saying "Only
level six? I got to level
four hundred and seventy
two on my ﬁrst go.You're
crap!"
FIX FACTOR
Does your hand become
moulded to the joystick?
Do you come out of your
bedroom so rarely that
your pet dog starts to
attack you 'cause he
thinks you're a burglar?
Do you set your alarm
clock to wake you up
during the night so that
you can have one more
go? Is the only way to get
you away from your
computer to prise your
ﬁngers from the joystick
and take a hammer to the
power pack? If the answer
to any of these questions
is yes, then the game has
a high ﬁx factor. If,
however, the game results
in the mere thought of
going within ten yards of
your computer bringing
you out in a cold sweat,
then the ﬁx factor is round
about nil.

what they used to be
0  yes they are, except they're not as
old. In the shoot 'em up stakes
though, it's a fact. Some of the best
shooties around are a bit past their
sell be date. This is no bad thing
though, cause this means that some
of the best adrenalin pumpers are to
be had for less than three quid.
THREE QUID!!! That's the price of
two pints and bag o'nuts at my local,
so there's bargains to be had and no
mistake missus. So, without further
ado, let's get straight into the blastin'
blitz.
SALAMANDER
The Hit Squad E2.99
This one, for those not in the know,
started life as a pretty hot Konami
Coin Op a few years ago. It's a no
messing, ﬂy to the end of the level
before encountering the big nasty
type game with absolutely
crateloads of action. Destroying a
wave of enemies will leave a bonus
weapon, most of which are useful,
and some of which are a absolutely
essential. In addition to the usual
left to right scroll, it's even got some
sections which are vertical scrollers.
Salamander's got just about
everything you'll need to keep you
blasting for ages. If you haven't got
it, then it's absolutely unmissable at
three quid, and if you have it
already,dig it out again and you'll be
surprised at how totally fab it still is.
Salamander - Now on budget!!!
L e '
1 7
1 They won't stun the world,
but are perfectly suitable for
the game.
8
The tunes okay, and the in-
game effects are ﬁne.
8
It scrolls just ﬁne.
9
Some unusual and
imaginative bad guys and
hazards to negotiate.
9
It's fab. A totally spot on
conversion of a good arcade
game that's a massive
bargain at just three
quiddies.
TURFMAN
Rainbow Arts E9-99
This one is epic. It's enormous. You
needn't bother with the scenario, but
checking out the instructions is a
must, cause this one needs so many
hands on so many buttons even an
octopus would have trouble. That's
normally a bad sign with a shoot 'em
up, but this one's different, cause
after a while getting the right weapon
for the job is intuitive. In Turrican,
the aim is to work your way though
the world of Turrican for some reason
or other, negotiating the literally
hundreds of hazards and enemies as
you go. You'll ﬁnd yourself leaping
over mountains, piling caves,
jumping over waterfalls all within
about ﬁve minutes of loading up.
There's hidden bonuses all over
the show, and a quick swing of your
laser beam should be exercised at
every possible instance in order to
reveal them. This one really is state
of the art and no messing. It
combines rapid shooting and
hacking, and Marioesque hidden
bonuses. An absolute 'must buy
even if I have to sell my hamster into
slavery'.
CYBERNOID
The Hit Squad E2.99
Another bargain, this time an aging
classic courtesy of Raf Cecco and
Hewson. This one differs somewhat
from the standard, in that instead of
scrolling along and hacking your way
though wave upon wave of baddies,
you negotiate a number of rooms. It
also deviates from the norm because
instead of starting off with one basic
weapon and collecting others as you
go, you start off with ﬁve different
weapons, including homing missiles,
mines and bouncing bombs. As you
work your way though the rooms,
you'll need to ﬁgure out exactly
which weapons are best for which
particular room, and how best to use
them all economically.
Its got some brilliant graphics,
meaty sound effects and a brilliant
tune. If you like to use a little-but not
too much-brain power along with
your shoot 'em ups, then Cybernoid
is the one to go for. A  classic. What
more could you want?
9
Tons of colour, tons of
variety and tons of
excellence.
9
Pretty excellent on this
count too.
9
Smoother than Rik after a
couple of pints.
9
Tons of 'em, and all after
killing you.
9
You'll be playing it from now
until Christmas.
8
Nothing stunning by today's
standards, but some brilliant
effects all the same.
8
A tab tune, and some good
solid chunky explosions.
It doesn't N o t  even in the
slightest.
7
Not particularly clever, but
the sheer numbers and
limited space make the
going tough.
9
If you allow yourself to get
addicted to this one, kiss
your social life goodbye.

ROBOCOP
Ocean E9.99
This one's a bit old for a full price
game, but was round about the top
of the charts for ages, and justiﬁably
so. The controls are a bit awkward
at ﬁrst, and take some getting used
to, but once you've ﬁgured them out
the game's a lot more
straightforward. It's an out and out
shooter, in which you, as Robocop,
strolls along a sideways scrolling
street, blasting the baddies who
hang out of the window and
approach from either side of the
screen. At the end of the levels you'll
have to blast a huge ED209, no easy
feat, believe me. After each main
level, there's also a couple of mini
games thrown in for good measure.
The tunes are pretty excellent on
this one, and there's even quick
sampled 'Robocop' thrown in for
good measure, although it's not
exactly stunningly clear. The
graphics aren't exactly crystal clear
either but there's tons of colour, and
the animation on the ED209 and the
Robocop character is pretty
impressive. An all time classic.
8
Fairly dull, but the mark's
bumped up by some
excellent animation.
8
A good tune, and some good
blasty effects.
8
Nothing special, but good
enough for the job in hand.
7
Not exactly the most difﬁcult
opponents to kill, but the
sheer numbers keep you
blasting.
9
Although not scoring
massively in any particular
department, the whole lot
goes together to make an
excellent game.
DELTA
Thalamus
This one is another blast from the
past, but one of those games, like
Undium, that was completely
revolutionary for it's time, and wiped
the ﬂoor with all the competition at the
time. And, unlike it's sequel Sanxion,
this one really has aged well.
It's a left to right scroller, where
blasting a few complete waves of
aliens will access a number of power
ups, the number dependent upon
how many you blast. One neat touch
is that all the power ups that you
can't access still appear on the
screen, but you must avoid bumping
into them otherwise your're dead.
The graphics look fairly uninspired
now, and a bit boring, and the sound
effects don't exactly enthral, but the
tunes are good, and it's still fairly
teeming with heaps of playability.
Still a surprising good game, and it's
available on a Thalamus compilation
along with ﬁve other classics
including Armalyte and Sanxion.
Another no self respecting Commie
owner should be without' game.
URIDIUM
Hewson
This is another of those games that was
absolutely revolutionary for it's time. It
followed the usual Hewson formula of
having each level of the main game
7
Some good touches, but
tame for the most part.
8
Average sound effects but
good tunes.
9
When it needs to. it shifts
the pixels at a massive
speed.
9
Tons of different ones, and
some unusual hazards to
negotiate.
9
Yet another corker.
alternating with a short sub game. The
sub game is nothing to write home about,
but the main game will blow your socks
off. It's f left to right sailer. with you in
command like an aircraft carrier. The aim
is to survive for as long as possible
blasting the waves of aliens that attack
you, before being given the command to
land, at which point it's a race to get the
ship docked before the whole lot
explodes.
The game is megatast, and has some
brilliantly smooth scrolling and ultra high
quality graphics. This game provided the
Commie 64 with one of it's ﬁnest hours.
SILKWORM
Virgin Mastertronic
This one is apparently an arcade
conversion, although I must admit to
never seeing the arcade original. If it was
half as good as the 64 version though, it
must've made tons of money.
The aim, as usual is to guide your
ship, in this case a helicopter, along
scrolling scenery blasting everything in
sight. Some of the bad guys in Silkworm
take some real beating, and this one really
requires an ultra fast trigger ﬁnger_ The
helicoptety theme works surprisingly well,
and the graphics are excellent. This one
has the advantage of a two player mode
where the second player gets to drive a
jeep along the bottom, and decent team
work can make a real difference in how far
you can get in the game. Simply brilliant.
9
High resolution and brilliantly
done.
8
Some high quality noises
complement the game
10
The best
9
They are mega fast, if a little
samey after a few hours
9
Another one that will keep
you glued to your commie.
9
A good theme well done
8
Lots of shootey kerblammey
explodey noises, and all the
usual stuff.
8
Not stunningly fast, but it
doesn't need to be anyhow.
9
Some really devious enemies
keep you on your toes
9
Not the most brilliant of the
bunch, but the two player
mode adds a lot to the
game.

An ancient game of strategy and cunning wit, Ash wouldn't be able to play it
then!!!
While sitting in the comfort of your home you can have a game of dominoes with Max and Joe at one of the two
levels available in this excellent domino game.
The game uses a double six set of dominoes and takes out all the drudgery of shufﬂing and starling the game as
the computer checks who holds the highest double, or the highest value, if no doubles are held by any of the three
players. Player three is the human contestant of course.
To make the game as realistic as possible redeﬁned characters are used to display the dots of the dominoes
including colours.
As the screen area available is limited certain changes to the game layout had to be made but these were
carefully considered so as not to detract from the pleasure of the game. Only the last domino played at either end of
the line is displayed, however, as a domino is played the value of the domino is added to the appropriate column on
the right of the screen. This allows a check to be kept of all dominoes that have been played helping you to decide
on your move.
The block at the left of the screen with a number in it indicates the number of dominoes left in the pool which
can be drawn if necessary.

Back in the early days of the 64,
adventures had a large following. The
big problem with writing adventures
however, was the large amounts of
memory required for the text. All sorts
of techniques were employed to
overcome this. One day, a software
house called Gilsoft produced an
excellent program called THE QUILL.
Suddenly, the world opened up to all
sorts of adventures. Unfortunately, like
SEUCK system, people did not really
E v e s  ( t h e  E d  o f  C D U )
use it to its full potential. LIBERTE is
one of my offerings. Please remember,
this program was originally written
way back in 1985
Liberte employs the usual verb,
noun input but you can use extended
commands for effect. For example,
you can say either "Take gun" or "Take
the large machine gun".
The scene is a prisoner of war
camp in France. Your job is to use
cunning and stealth to break out of the
1
camp. Once safely outside however,
your task is not over because to
succeed in your escape, you are M O I
required to join up with the Resistancdn ac
and help them destroy the local s t a n

Hey, what's
this? Have I
gone back in
time, to 1985, or is this just
another lukewarm ﬁlm tie-
in?
O
ﬁlms of the summer come
big name releases. Back to
the Future II is just one of these great
licences. Will the name sell the game
or is it going to fail, just like Michael
J. Fox's looks?
Well oddly enough the ﬁlm wasn't
the phenomenal sucess that
everyone expected it to be. This is
due in part to the fact that BITE ill
was released about six months after
part II, causing confusion and a
seeming lack of interest. The game
comes right at the end of the whole
commotion that the ﬁlm caused so
perhaps it's a little late to make the
most of the interest generated.
Whether it is or not, I suspect that
after past ﬁlm tie-ins people in the
street (that's you) will wait for
reviews to appear before buying the
games. I hope so at least, or else you
may fall into the trap set by games
like this one.
After B rI T I the wierd professor,
Doc. comes back to the present to
tell Marty that his future children
need his help! But in going back
Jennifer (Marty's future wife) gets
into the house and comes close to
meeting herself. This could be really
serious so you're going to have to
save the situation.
The game comes in ﬁve levels,
which seem to be very thinly
connected indeed. The ﬁrst screen is
okay, a scrolling skateboard section.
You have to get Marty to the house,
avoiding the various hazards. Other
boarders try to kill you but these can
be punched out. You can jump over
BACK TO THEE
One strike and you're outta here! Marty in no teeth shock!!!
Fax
Sticky Moments
A cassette that has had the tabs removed can be
written over by sticking bits of sellotape over the
holes. This may come in handy if you've already
bought this game.
Mirrorsoft in crap game horror! Back To
The Future 2 wasn't that bad as a ﬁlm
but it doesn't quite cut it as a game.
Mind you we can't have everything can we? I mean, we've already got Bloodwych and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!

FUTURE
the hazards either forwards or
backwards, and items turn up which
can be collected for bonus points.
The problem with the level is that
almost everything - including
kerbstones, bits of mud and drains -
drain your energy. The game area
isn't really big enough to avoid the
obstacles so you'll end up dying
more often than not. It's a very
frustrating level of the game. It's also
repeated later as level ﬁve, only
harder!
Many 'average' games players
won't even have the patience to get
past the ﬁrst level. However if you do
you are rewarded by a logic puzzle.
In this level you have to get Jennifer
out of the house. This is done by
guiding her through one of a choice
of doors and by watching what the
rest of the family do as a result. After
such an arcade-based sequence this
doesn't come easy, as it requires
brain work.
It can be very frustrating to have
battled all through the ﬁrst level only
to fail the logic puzzle and have to
restart. With a bit of thinking you will
probably spot the pattern and get
through. Now it's back to the
arcades for a bit of ninja-style
ﬁghting. This section is a little like
Dragon Ninja and similar games. You
have to ﬁght through Biff's
henchmen.
The screen scrolls from right to
left, and soon you'll be punching
your way into various cronies. The
level is quite fun at ﬁrst but it soon
gets dull as there is no variety to the
action. Once you've beaten up a few
hundred very similar-looking bad
guys you have to complete another
logic puzzle.

sliding puzzles that were very
popular with kids at one time. Marty
has to play his guitar (there's the
connection with the ﬁlm, don't blink
or you might miss it) and to let him
do this you have to complete a
sliding puzzle. Obvious isn't it? No,
didn't think so either.

game is. Apart from the skateboard
sequences, which could be said to
bear relevance to the ﬁlm, the game
is a bunch of rehashed game ideas
loosely (at best) tied in with the
theme of the ﬁlm. If you manage to
get to the end of level ﬁve there is
apparently another sixth level.
Somehow I doubt that anyone will
bother.
If you're a fan of Back to the
Future you'll be very disappointed. If
you're not you!!l be very
disappointed too. And if you
appreciate value for money then
you'll feel ripped off by the whole
thing. Avoid.

E12.99 Tape,
10 games in
one collection?
How on earth
could Rik
emerge from this software
overdose? He ﬁnally came
out with a smile on his face!
C
company known for its
variety in games software,
tending to dedicate its range
towards games that require a little
more cerebral matter. Blue Ribbon,
the company's budget label, on the
other hand had many such games
and just about all of them are
collected on one compilation along
with the best game ever (in my
opinion).
Wizard's Lair is a game much in
the mould of the old Speccy classic
Attic Attack, and if you've never
heard of it before then you have
certainly missed something. It is a
white and biological too, but then
again it's not THAT good.
Seen from a top-down view, the
action is mightily fast and furious,
and the scrolling matches up to the
speed. You control the closest man
to the ball, but sometimes this
control falters slightly, and you can
jump, slide tackle or kick (if you have
the ball at your feet). And that is
about it for the controls on the ﬁeld,
although this will take some
mastering as, unlike most games of
this ilk, the ball is not stuck to your
foot like you'd just trodden in a
remarkably stretchy piece of bubble
gum.
You can also have your players
chopped down like trees in the
Amazon that stand in the way of fast
food houses, or indeed you can
perform the fouling yourself. You can
even have players sent off, although
at times it seems as if your players
have miraculously reappeared on the
pitch in an effort to prevent you from
losing 53-0.
There are loads of options, and
several types of competition you can
top-down view, very fast arcade
adventure with tonnes of things to
kill, and not a lot else to do. The
graphics are very Spectrum like, but
the game's not half bad.
Hi-0 Quiz is very, very similar to
Trivial Pursuit, so if you like that sort
of game then you'll be well away.
The Ice Temple is one of the
weakest games of the pack, and is
an arcade adventure that I could do
without. It is like many budget games
before and beyond it.
Then there's Steve Davis
Snooker, a game that's been
knocking around for quite some time,

of which have varying effects on the

which effects the wind (try taking a
and until recently it has been the
best snooker simulation to appear. It
is still a milestone though and is a
great addition to anybody's classic
game collection, and to this
compilation too.
Pinball, which has previously
appeared under the name Macadam
Bumper, is a simulator of that
ﬂashing light machine that resides in
most biker's clubs up and down the
country. Not only that but there is a
construction kit too to allow you to
design your own bumpers (I would
say ooer at this point if I were so
inclined).
Wizardry
Brian Clough is the manager of Notts Forest football
team and although he has a lair, he is yet to prove
himself as a wizard.
Steve Davis has about as much charisma as the Ice
Temple.

essentially these
don't seem to alter
the game much at

though is my liking for them. They

Bar Billiards

is an accurate
version of that

once a popular
pastime in
pubs when real

a cross
between pool and skittles, and apart
from the graphics this is pretty good
fun.

moon. The sound FX too have very
little to offer.
This is not the best football game,
but it's certainly worthy of being on
the pitch. I think I'll wait for Kick Off 3
until I get my kicks (wah, wah. wah

Ooer!!!
Kick Off sounds surprisingly like a very well known
swearing phrase that we cannot abhore in this

If you kick somebody in the shins very hard you
may very well hear this phrase repeated many times.
so it's probably best left well alone.
But although I'm not the greatest
fan of text adventures (apart from
Infocom ones) Castle Blackstar
seems to be reasonable, but I didn't
get far so I can't really say much.
Wult pack is a wargame based
around the second world war and
submarine warfare in the Atlantic in
that era. It's not bad, and is pretty
playable with lots of different kinds
of gameplay to be encountered.
And now to my most favourite
game ever... Brian Clough's Football
Fortunes is superb. It is everything
one could ever want in a computer
game. For those without knowledge
of it, it is a board game whereby all
of the 'chance' cards and match
results are controlled by the
computer. Superb stuff even if you
hate football.
So a compilation of ten games for
the price of what Football Fortunes is
worth. This is possibly the best value
for money you'll ever get outside of
VC, so I'd give up reading this review
and...

here again. Yup,
the time of the
month when slime gets
dished out at breakfast,
dinner and tea is back, and
I'm frankly disappointed
with your response. Not
only did I get barely a
dozen letters but not all of
you used the full address
that I gave you, and so the
few letters I got took that
much longer to reach me.
Well, perhaps I should
withdraw my offer...
No, don't panic. SCUM

stay. Well done to those of
you who got printed last
ish, and for anyone who

In fact, I may as well put
Adam's right here. Adam
says that his middle name
is "Mega-Tipster". Adam,
I'd shoot my parents if I
were you! First on his little
list is System 3's
Vendetta. Adam reckons
that the best weapons are
guns but you should keep
an eye on ammo levels as
they are quickly depleted.
Grenades should be
avoided because of the
delay in their
effectiveness and the
large area of destruction
they cause. Adam sounds
a bit violent because he
says that in order to get
onto the next level, press
your hands onto the
middle of the keyboard
including the space bar
until the screen goes
black. The next level then
loads in with all of the
current level's items
collected! On the driving
section, pressing a reset
button then restore will
give you another chance
at it.
Now onto Ocean's
Operation Thunderbolt.
Adam lets us know the
wonderful multiloading
cheat. Get past level one
with a couple of credits
left. When level 2 loads,
abort by pressing ﬂ and
Run/Stop, but
ignore the rewind
message and leave
the tape running.
Level 3 will now
load in and this
works on higher
levels too!
Obviously this
won't work if you
have a disk
version...

Well wicked! No need to
elaborate any further is
there. Now onto Double
Dragon II. which on the
whole wasn't my favourite
game of all time! However,
with an autoﬁre joystick
you can have lots of fun at
the expense of the
baddies. Just activate your
autoﬁre and keep the
joystick forward. Asad
says that you shouldn't
lose any energy until levels
3,4 or 5!
On level 2 of Licence to
Kill, shoot at the jeep a
couple of times then jump
onto it by pressing forward
ﬁre and jump. Now you
can sit back and watch the
landscape because the
baddies can't kill you.

don't mention how to put
'em in but I reck that
they're cartridge pokes.

Poor David can't get anywhere in Head Over Heels!
God, what a wimp. He says that he can't make Head

ACROPOLIS
Hello matey peeps. Or Postie, my couz from Brit, he on his summa
holz innit. So is me, Post Acropolis wot's doing the lettaz this munt
Wotta lotta tripe! Never read anythin like it, know wot I mean?
Anyway, is cool. Gettem lettaz inta me at this postbox wotsit:-
POST ACROPOLIS, YC MAGAZINE, 20 POTTERS LANE, KILN FARM,
MILTON KEYNES MK*11 311F.
YC (YOUR COBAL)...
It's good to see the return of YC64
(wotzat? I think that we woz VC! Is
another mag he read? - PA) to the
newsstands after a (prolonged) gap.
Magazines for the 8-bit machines are
increasingly few and far between.
However...
What puts me (and presumably
other 'older' readers) off buying
computer magazines these days is
the fact that the tone of YC (and
other mags) seems to be aimed at
people with a mental age of about
twelve (that old? - PA).
Lose the silly cartoons, tone up
the editorial content and provide
wider coverage of other issues
(programming, comms, technical,
music etc.) and you will have a
magazine which would appeal to a
far wider audience (remember that
increased circulation pays wages!).
Not all of us out here use our 64's
for playing games exclusively...
B. Northover, Walthamstow.
innit).
But seriouzly, if you don like YC
coz is not seriouz enough then get
CDU. Maybe you ain't gotta disk
drive, but most seriouz userz have.
Fact is, most seriouz userz don't
bovva wiv the 64 coz is old hat.
They all got Amigaz now innit? I
agree wiv you, I don use my 64 for
just playing gamez. Sometimes I
like to use it azza doorstop, dig?
Yawn. Gotta go type inna listing...
PA: Oh lordy God. Hotta nuvva
serious reader. If we had stayed
put azza serious mag then the
prob of 8-bit magz being scarce
would be one more mag worse -
us! '(up, the mental age is about
twelve, and seeing as our readerz
are mostly eight, they must have
brainz! Next you'll want articles on
Cobal, C and the state of Greek
databasez (and they ain't good
LETO OF THE
WHOZE HE TALKING TO?
WORLD CLAZZ
This is about the tenth letter I have
written to different computer mags over
the last twelve months. So far none of
the others have bothered to reply to me
(YC refreshez the partz owa magz
cannot reach! - PA).
I know just by reading your mag
that you are different. Computer mags
in my area don't come into newsagents
on a regular basis, your mag YC I can
Now listen Rik (Whoze Rik? - PA), If the best team in the world Manchester
United (Nopel Galapigos F.C. is betta innitt - PA) were as rubbish as you
say they are they wouldn't have the England skipper Bryan Robson, also
known as Captain MARVEL and Scotland's no.1 keeper playing for them
(Jim Leighton). And take note they have a museum full of their trophies and
they also have been in 11 cup ﬁnals (But how many did they win? - PA).
By the way, Man. Utd. beat Arsenal 4-1 at the start of the season and
then Arsenal were the Champions. And the day that Liverpool or Arsenal
become better then Man. Utd. will NEVER come.
Alex Mead, Brixham.
P.S. Please please please send me a Man. United 64 computer game on tape.
PA: Now listen innit. Captain Marvel? Captain Git is more like. He's
only wiv Man. U. coz no-one else wantz him! And the bestest keeper
in Scot is easy coz none of them noze how to catch ballz. Their
museum of trophiez is probbly nicked and Liverpool have won 18
league Champs! Ha!
As for winning Arsenal 4-1, is easy. They a buncha loserz too,
just like Man. U. An how come Man. U. almost got relegated if they
so cool? I think that you should make like 007 and never say never
again. Cool.

As for Frankienstien I don
only get from one newsagent in the
centre of Sydney. I am still trying to
persuade my wife to let me order an
annual subscription but until then I
guess I just have to get it when I can.
I thought that I would add a few
comments. A lot of products that
appear in your mag are not available on
the Aussie market, eq. data recorder
with adjustable tracking or the reset
cartridges, and many others.
To be honest the reason that I am
writing is a cry for help. I need help with
a simple old game that I bought three
years ago called Frankenstien. With
most adventures I have no problem but
in this one I cannot even get past the
bear. If you know the game can you
please send a few hints as its driving
me crazy.
_ast of all I would like to say that
you put out a great mag - the best we
get in Australia for 64 users.
T. Creed, Kingswood, NSW Australia
PA: Therez proof that we can
crorz the globe wiv our brilliance!
We Britz (well, you Britz anyway
coz I'm Greek) get Neighbourz
and the Aussiez get VC. Anyone
want to make a soap opera out of
us?
think I've evva heard of it.
Can any peeps help?
Getting a subscription
izza good idea if you can
afford it coz you'll get the
mag quicker, dig? Is cool.
WHATZ SYS?
I have just bought YC
August edition and I think it
is a super mag. The price is
just right for us kids. I'm not
sure that I like the new
format of mag but it still is a
great mag.
I've just come across the
Poke section and found that
all the pokes given didn't
have a SYS number to
restart the game, so they
are not a bit good. Please
could you print SYS
numbers in future issues.
Dave, Dagenham.
PA: Dave, getya head
screwed on right. Is a
cartridge poke if therez no SYS
numba on the poke, innit? You
gotta getta cart to plug In the
back of your 64. Then it restartz
the game for you. Sorry but thatz
all there is to it.
Thanx for your commentz. The
new look mag is coz the YC gone
on Desk Top Publishing syst on
Apple Macs. Looks clean innit?
Lika hospital ward, dig? Mag
comes fromma hospital ward too,
so we wanted you to get the feel
of the surroundingz. Hope ya
continue to like us in fute coz
we're gonna get betta.
WHY DON YOU...
I have been buying your mag ever
since you started your new look and
I think it's brill. You've improved the
meg even more with your new look,
with the fax on each review and the
interesting odd-beds feature and my
mouth waters at the idea of a regular
place for Flame Head (don't he evva
breave? - PA).
Unfortunately I have a few
groans:-
1) Please, please, please could you
include more colour in your mag,
which is the only ﬂaw to your C64
counterpart.
2) Please could you put some better
games on the tape, I agree you
have some good games like
Pipeline II, Microdot and Blastball
but the rest is really a load of
crap, eg. Frogs in Space. I think
that you should include a demo
on each tape and then one or two
good games instead of the trash
that you normally have that has
the playability and addictiveness
of Pro Mountain Bike Simulator.
3) You could enlarge the mag, as
around 70 pages is just not value
for money. You should include a
regular preview section, a larger
tips section and have a few more
reviews.
Please could you also tell me
where I can get a book or tape about
machine code.
M.C. Wicked, Basildon.
PA: Well. Wotta lotta thingz you
don't like. Is good that you can air
your viewz but I don think that
you have looked at the mag from
the other point of view. Maybe a
life in Galapigos Islands haz made
me bit strange but I thought that
if you put in more pagez, more
colour and better gamez on the
tape it costz loadza dosh?
The new look will help coz it
costz less to do magz on an
Apple. Thingz will improve, with
loadza mega demoz and gamez in
the runup to Crimble. But to do
what you want overnight would
mean putting up the cost of the
mag and nobody wantz that. Be
patient wiv us. The Scum of the
Earth will be getting bigga every
munf as more peeps jump on the
bandwaggon. Send us some tipz
and who noze? You might even
get in the bestest 64 mag again!
Is cool?
MULTILOADERZ...
I am a new buyer of VC, I've only had
my 64 a few Months. I've always
liked arcade games although I am 30
years old (Lordy God! Thatz old! -
PA).

Your review of Hammerﬁst was very
good, but the black and white
photos didn't do it justice. I got the
game and I thought that it's very
good. The skore I would give it would
be 10 all round especially the music.
Maybe you can tell me how to get
past the monster at the end of part
one (under the sea), the one that
throws shuttlecocks at you.
Why do games companies make
games like Ghostbusters II with
multi-loaders? You have to keep
reloading when you die. Its very
frustrating when you pay good
money...(Itz really boring from now
on innit, justa loada moaning about
not having enough dosh to buy a
disk drive - PA).
It has put me off buying any more
Activision games now. Keep up the
good work, also the poke for Space
Harrier II doesn't work for me.
G. Holland, St. Helens.
PA: Funny, I ﬁnk that Activision
did Hammerﬁst and Ghostbusterz
II? Well, I wish that you would
make up ya mind. I'm confused

Irma. Gamez wiv multiloaderz are
coz they can't ﬁt all of the game
into the 64 ﬁrst time. It meanz
that the gamez get bigga wivout
the 64 getting fatta.
If ya think Ham merﬁst was good
then look out for Time Machine. Is
even better, dig? Is cool!
LIARZ NEVER WIN...
I buy YC each month. It's a fun read
after all of the other boring Commie
titles and I don't want an Amiga

Ancient ﬂight sims often get
repackaged, but never two on one
budget cassette. This is hot poopie
stuff, because to my knowledge Ace
and Ace 2 were both considered
pretty cool games.
They were programmed by a
company called Cascade, who seems
to have disappeared without a trace,

it allows you to perform many

Um_  I remember this... I wish I
hadn't though, it wasn't particularly
good then and it's not particularly
good now, in fact I'd go as far as to
say that it's crud (not like certain
other magazines that would rather
not upset anybody).
In theory it should be very good
indeed. Programmed by Jon Ritman
of Head Over Heels fame, and
featuring many exciting new
doofers, should have made it the
deﬁnitive footy game, but alas it
was not to be. Why? Because it was
so slow you could go down the
shops, buy a jar of coffee, some
milk, and some sugar, go home,
wait for the kettle to boil, make
yourself a cup of coffee and the

not a game of football like we'd all
expect.
On the plus side, it has no plus

and the only reason somebody
might want to buy it for the sum of

011i and Lissa are back in another
Speccy-like arcade adventure,
and quite jolly good fun it is too.
This time 011i woke up one day
to ﬁnd that some rascal had
dismantled his banger (his
car stoopid) and had
scattered it around a
spooky old castle inhabited
by big beasties and Ashley
lookalikes. When he had ﬁnished sobbing (the big
pansy) he found himself a candle and decided to
brave the dark...
Cartoon Time
E2.99
011i can traipse around the castle and pick up
objects that are bound to help him. He needs a
magnifying glass to ﬁnd a piece of car, and a spanner to
build it again. Other objects also lie around that will help
him in some way, although he can only carry one at a
time, and there is some food that helps to restore his
sapped energy.
Telephones are also liberally placed in order to help
him in his quest. But there's no sign of
Lissa, the skiver.
This is a little similar to the Trap Door
games, and is quite a good laugh
because of it. The entire game will
certainly need mapping before you can
really get anywhere though.

Now if this isn't a silly title I don't
know what is! And unfortunately for
the Codies it's also a silly game. Not a
bit bad, but rather silly.
For a start, if you go by the
graphics on the back of the cassette
inlay you'll see rather spifﬁng Amstrad
screen shots, and although the
Commy graphics aren't THAT bad,
they're like a Speccy in comparison.

Imagine. There you are, down the
mines digging a living and wearing a
liquorice face-pack, everybody is
sick and tired of villagers yelling at
them to do Al Jolson impressions,
Arthur Scargill sitting in the Pit Cafe
shouting his head off 'cause he
wants more pay to buy another
Jaguar - and someone's shovel goes
right through the bottom of the pit
and opens up a hole that appears to
lead into a gigantic cave of some
sort.
"Eh, Frank, wots this 'ere?"
"Oh you know what that this
don't ya?", says Frank with an air of
someone who always pretends he
knows everything about anything -
even when he doesn't,
"Er ..." said Ed Bullock.
Conscious of not showing his
ignorance, even though he was.
"Well," continued Frank, "what
you've got there is yer secret vault
SSINS GOLD -
that has laid undiscovered for
thousands of years, like. Probably
contains untold riches and lots'n lots
of very vicious monsters'n things."
"Never!"
"I'm tellin' ya! See them all the
time in the papers. Orcs and Dragons
and all that stuff. Common
knowledge isn't it? Stands to reason
that we should have one. Remember
the hell hounds at Upper Thrigforth?"
"Oh, aye."
"Well, if they can have an ancient
evil - so can we."
At which point a rather nasty
Margoyle appeared out of the hole
and speared both Ed and Frank with
its very long and very sharp body
spikes. New Verdigris were in a spot
of bother, it seemed. What they
needed was a few (fool) hardy
adventurers to sort out the mess.
This is where you step in
Secret of the Silver Blades is the
third in the Forgotten Realms series.
Besides the ﬂoppy disks you get a
rule book (which includes an
explanation of the game menus and
characters creation routines) and an
Adventurer's Journal (that lists the
game world characters - good and
bad - off line paragraphs, that the
game will instruct you to read for
extra info and quite a few reference
tables that list weapons, spells,
levels and so on.)
As far as actually playing the
game, well if you have played any of
the other ADM) RPGs such as Pool
of Radiance or Curse of the Azure
Bonds you'll know what to expect.
The main window onto the game-
world is stuck in one corner and your
character stats are squeezed into
another window. Running along the
bottom is a text window that tells
you things like - "Oh my God! Look
at the size of that muvval You haven't
got a hope in hell's chance of
scratching that, never mind killing it!"
Well - okay - it doesn 't actually say
that. Alright, yes, I made it up. Look,
I'm trying my best, alright? What
d'you think I am? Willie, sodden,
Shakespeare or summat? Hmm? The
game? Oh, right, yes, you'll also see
a few special full size graphic
screens for when you do something,
well, special I suppose.

You've read VC. You just can't
wait for the next gaspwodhy
issue. So what do you read in
the meantime? Well, there
just happens to be quite a
few nifty adventure mags
produced by small teams of
dedicated adenture
enthusiasts that any self-
respecting adventurer would
do well to track down. Here's
the ﬁrst.
Mandy Rodrigues is a foxy
lady. There's no doubting it.
This Welsh stunner, the focus
of every eligible bachelor in
Llandudno, produces the
longest running dedicated
adventure magazine the world
has ever seen. Called
Adventure Probe, the A5 size
magazine is packed with
reviews, previews, the odd
I
addition of a couple of extra
character levels and a few monsters,
there is absolutely no difference
between this game and the last
Forgotten Realms release (apart from
the plot, of course).
Why? Why is it the same? Why
haven't we seen an improvement in
the combat and magic? Why isn't
there more animation? Why is this
game such a kop-out?
Maybe SSI are a bunch of lazy
buggers who can't be bothered to
make an effort with their new
releases. Maybe they think that the
gaming public (ie. you) will be so
grateful to see an ADM) game that
you won't notice that there has been
next to no improvement in the game
system. Then again, maybe TSR
said to SSI:-
-
million AD&D RPGs every year or we
won't give you heaps you cash
anymore, alright?"
So SSI have no choice but to
honour the contract and churn out
the goods.
It doesn't really matter what the
reason is, actually. What is important
is that, while everybody else - like
Origin for instance - are busting a gut
to give you, the loyal Commie C64
owner, the best RPG they can
produce, SSI - erm a re n 't. Should
you support such a company, by
handing over your hard earned dosh,
probably so they can rip you off
again next time? Well, I wouldn't.
It really gets my back up when I
see a company like SSI get so
complacent and so bloody smug that
they can't be bothered to make an
effort.
My advice is to leave Secret of
the Silver Blades on the shelves and
save up for Ultima VI, which is
currently being created by those nice
people at Origin.

computing life on the ZX
Spectrum may remember the
Granddaddy of this game. The
original Chaos was one of the ﬁrst
ever games to utilize most of the 48K
memory when the ﬁrst 48K Spectrum
appeared. Unfortunately, despite its
brilliant gameplay and eight-player
option, the game didn't do very well
due to poor marketing and its
eventual withdraw' from the
marketplace. Original copies can be
regarded as collector's items.
However, Lords of Chaos picks
up where the original left off. Some
six years later, the game is vastly

improved, looks very reminiscent of
games like Laser Squad, and is
superb.
The game has been increased in
size and complexity. The original
featured a single screen which
played host to all eight wizards. The
idea was to cast spells which
created creatures. These creatures
then did combat, and the wizard that
was the last to die won. Lords of
Chaos is very similar. Your wizard
has to strive to be the last survivor in
a battle of magical forces.
At the start of each game you
Itto
to
l,CISSOCCIL
have to select your options. You
have a certain amount of
development points which may be
spent on your character or your
spells. Your characteristics include
spell points, strength, movement
points and combat skills. Upgrading
these costs various amounts of
development points and will effect
your ability to cast spells, move
around the complex, and success in
battle too.
Instead of being given a random
list of spells like the original, you
have to choose your own in Lords.
Many spells at your command. Paul
Daniels would give his right goolie to
grab hold of this enormous collection
(probably)!
Selecting a spell costs a certain
amount of points, and selecting
multiple spells of the same type
costs extra points. The spells come
in various types. There are the
damage spells, that effect enemy
wizards or creatures, the beneﬁcial
spells that have a good effect on
your wizard, and creature spells that
(hopefully) create a creature for you

starts. You appear in a room of a
complex. Any objects in the room are
described in 3D graphics_ Control is
similar to games like Laser Squad.
You select an icon to give a
command, for example move, or pick
up object. Then you select the
location by positioning the cursor
over the place you want to effect.
With practise this becomes easy
and quick. Then the fun really starts.
You can cast creatures up to form an
army and start moving around
looking for other wizards to kill.
When two opposing creatures battle
their respective power and skills are
compared and the outcome is
decided_
The game becomes a frantic
struggle for power and survival. With
multiple Human players there can be
loads of scheming, alliances formed
and broken, and general mayhem.
The computer wizards can be a little
predictable at times but the game is
still fun to play alone_
I was a fan of the original and I
am a fan of this too. Fantasy freaks
or strategy fans should give it a look.
You won't be disappointed.

could see a speck coming towards them so he sent out his
private to the nearest ridge to see if he could get a better look
at him. He told him to size him up to see how far away he was
and to see if he was an injun.
The private rode to the nearest ridge, sized him up and rode
back to the fort.
"Well?" said the sergeant.
"He's about an inch tall, and I can't make out if he's an injun or
not!" said the private.
"Oh, that's okay," said the sergeant, "He's about ﬁve days away.
Tomorrow you'll do the same!"
The next day came and the private once more rode to the ridge,
sized him up, and rode back.
'Well'?" said the sergeant.
"He's about four inches tall, but I still can't make out if he's an
injun or not!" said the private.
'That's okay," said the sergeant. "He's about four days away.
Tomorrow you'll do the same"
When the morning came the private was once again sent to the
nearest ridge, sized him up, and rode back.
'Well?" said the sergeant
"He's about 16 inches tall, riding sidesaddle and he's naked.

EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT
THE TEENAGE MUTANT NUM TURTLES BUT WERE TOO
EMBARRASSED TO GO INTO THE COMIC SHOP TO ASK!
40 Stunning Turtle facts
care of Dave "Half Shell"
Hughes!
W
day, a friend once remarked
that "if it doesn't have a
shell and a shuriken, I'm not
interested!" Less than a year later,
Hollywood has much the same
attitude. And why not? The
TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES
movie is already the most successful
independent movie of all time, with
merchandising all over the world
reaching even Bat-proportions.
Wherever you go, whether they're
'heroes' or 'ninjas*, turtles are
everywhere. And unlike the short-
lived (but nauseating) Batmania,
Turtle-mania looks set to stay.
They're hip, sassy heroes in a half-
shell. They live in sewers. They eat
pizza like a terrible shortage might
be only hours away. They like girls.
They shout "Cowabunga!"
mercilessly and without provocation.
Does any of this sound like Batman
to you, dudes?
When the TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA
TURTLES movie hits your town
towards Christmas, you may need
the relevant turtle trivia at your
ﬁngertips. So here, especially
prepared for YC readers, is the
comprehensive guide to all things
teenage or turtle...
1) T h e re  are four turtles in the
gang. Each wears a different
colour headband to identity him.
2) PARTNERS IN KRYME's
international number one hit
They're teen, they're green and
they're quite obscene!
TURTLE POWER gives Raphael
as the leader of the Turtles, but
the comics favour Leonardo.
3) Mich a e la n g e lo is the team's
party dude, and occasional
cook.
4) Ra p h a e l is the ﬁghter, and can
sometimes be hotheaded.
5) Do n a t e ilo is a paciﬁst, and also
likes anything mechanical.
6) T h e  Turtles were mutated by a
secret chemical called Mutagen,
which was poured into their
sewer homes by a company
called T.C.R.I.
7) T h e  team's human pal, April
O'Neil, is a news reporter,
although she was once
portrayed by one of the TMNT
comics as a computer hacker.
8) T h e  Turtles were trained in the
Ninja arts by a rat ‘sensel'
named Splinter.
9) T h e re  are currently around 75
million TMNT ads of all
descriptions around the world.
10) The Turtles began as a doodle
on Kevin Eastman's ofﬁce
notebook in 1983.
11) I t  took a $1,200 tax rebate to
launch the ﬁrst TEENAGE
MUTANT NINJA TURTLES comic
book series.
12) The movie took 100,000 times
that amount in just over a month.
13) In 1988 TMNT toys were
launched. $25 million worth were
sold that year.
14) Surge licensing, which handles
TMNT, receives on average 30
requests for new licenses every
day. "Everything from folding
musical pens to underwear that
turns into shoes!"

15) 9 9 % of license applications are
rejected.
16) Surge currently sanctions 250
licensed products, and
estimates that 100 times that
number of products are available
without an ofﬁcial license.
17) STING's 1986 album THE
DREAM OF THE BLUE TURTLES
is unlikely to be a tribute, since
the Teenage Turtles are green.
18) Both DC and Marvel Comics
rejected Kevin Eastman and
partner Peter Laird's idea for the
TMNI  comic. Almost every
major studio in Hollywood did
the same ﬁve years later in
connection with the movie_
19) There are three regular TMNT
comics, published by Mirage,
Archie Comics and Fleetway.
Mirage also publish TALES OF
TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA
TURTLES in black and white.
20) The 1987 movie TURTLE DIARY
is about nature conservation,
and not a dramatisation of
Leonardo's memoirs.
21) The BBC decided to change the
Ninja Turtles to 'Hero' Turtles to
avoid confusion for British kids_
Confusion has reigned ever
since.
22) Ofﬁcial TMNT merchandising
sales stood at $568 million
before the movie opened in the
U.S.
23) Eclipse Books' TMNT tribute,
ADOLESCENT RADIOACTIVE
BLACK-BELT HAMSTERS,
completely failed to become a •
cult hit.
24) A  turtle dove is a kind of bird
noted for soft cooing and
affection. It is therefore unlikely
to be related to the Teenage
Turtles.
25) The TMNT movie was made by
an independent Hong Kong
studio, Golden Harvest.
26) Th e  movie cost $12 million to
make. It broke even in 48 hours,
taking $25.4 million in its
opening weekend.
27) The movie holds the record for
the biggest ever non-holiday
opening in motion picture
history. It is the ninth biggest
opening of any kind.
28) Mo ck turtle (a kind of soup made
of calf's head) is an ill-advised
pastime these days, since Ninja-
trained Turtles take less than
kindly to being mocked (or made
into soup).
29) The Turtles usual enemies are
Shredder, Krang and Baxter.
30) Shredder's real name is Oroku
Nagi.
31) Krang is from Dimension X. He
lives in the Technodrome.
32) Baxter was originally portrayed
as black, but is now Caucasian.
33) The TMNT movie hit the S100
million mark after 24 days.
34) Mo vie  industry analyst Michael
Mahern described the movie's
enormous take as "the most
amazing gross in history,
especially as a large part of it is
reduced price (children's)
When they met
it was
COWABLINGA!
The Teenage
Mutant Ninja
(Hero?) Turtles,
every
merchandiser's
delight!!!
admissions."
35) Financier New Line's normally-
accurate tracking system
predicted that the TMNT movie
would take $8 million in its
opening weekend (about the
same amount that DAYS OF
THUNDER took). The highest
prediction in the New Line
ofﬁces was $14 million - still
about S il million shy of the
actual two-day take.
36) The movie's special effects were
handled by the late Jim
Henson's Creature Workshop in
London. Their work accounted
for more than half of the movie's
actual budget.
37) A  turtle-necked garment is one
with a high-ﬁtting collar, not one
that is green and rubbery with a
suspicious ﬁshy smell.
38) The TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA
TURTLES roleplaying game is
published by Palladium Books.
In it, players can become almost
any kind of mutated animal they
can think of.
39) Arcade and computer games
starring the Turtles are now very
common. It has been announced
that a 'Turtle-pack', similar to
last year's 'Bat-pack' will be
released at the same time as the
movie.
40) The TMNT movie opens in the
U.K. on November 9, a mere nine
months after its Stateside
opening. The sequel is already in
pre-production.
(With thanks to Splinter, Leonardo
and Jon Musselwhite)

O
There's more to life than the Commy 64! But what? Well there's Des O'Conner records,
Refresher chews, and Stars in Their Eyes on TV! Erm... Here's a few other things that are
currently around too!!!
M U S I C
SOUP DRAGONS
Town and Country
Club
August 1990
I don't know. Just ﬁnd a funky
drumbeat, a wah-wah pedal, an old
Stones track (that's Rolling, not Roses!)
and a reggae toaster (no - I don't mean the pop-up sort, I
mean the ones with the dreadlocks, yknow) and you too
could turn a dodgy indie band into a dance sensation!
Whoops... Er... They were dancey all along, right?
Still, they proved at the T+C that they can certainly
bash out a good tune (or ten) and pull off this indie-dance
business with no probs. In fact, there wasn't a dry armpit
in the house (bleurgh!) after Sean Dickson and the boys
had motored through such corkers as Love god (much
ﬂashing of lights and pointing of ﬁngers during the
chorus) and Mother Universe, a track at least as lazy as
I'm Free. So laid back, in fact, that it was almost
horizontal.
This was not the case for the crowd, who - whether
they'd seen Sean Dickson on the telly looking gormless
or whether they were hardcore fans who'd been with the
band all along - insisted upon bouncing up and down
and around into each other, into photographers (crunch,
oi!) and others, to the strains of the bouncy new-style
Soupies' songs.
Everything slotted together with I'm Free. The crowd
lapped up the encore (slurp, lick) and just adored their
singalong part which they roared while Dickson rattled
his tambourine and the band played their erstwhile indie
hearts out.
So it's deﬁnitely a good thing that the Soup Dragons
were 'free to do what they want any old time' and
experimented with dancey stuff, or we never would have
been treated to such a great gig and that would have
been even worse than bandwagon-jumping. (Joke, boys?
Er... put down that crowbar! Thud...)

TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES
'12'
And here they are again, but this
time in the ﬂesh! And what
amazingly agile ﬂesh it really is, or
at least the guys in the suits must
be.
You all know what the turtles
are, but no matter what hype
you'll have been dealt
nothing can prepare you
for the coolness,
funkiness, and
downright
dudeness
(?) of the heroes in a half-shell. They
are so today, Ninjitsu whilst on
skateboards, pizza slotted down
the drains into their sewer home.
And this is why the ﬁlm is so good.
Unfortunately it has many bad
points too. The effects aren't THAT
good, and the action sequences are
obviously marred by the immense
weight of the turtles costumes,
but who gives a ﬂying frag!
The movie is funny, fast
and furious, these are
heroes we can
relate to. They
do not have
any
emotional problems, they
don't have to dress
up as bats or any
other such
creature,
the only
problem
they have is
that they are
green, bald, and
whiff a bit.
The Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles movie has
taken its time to get here but it
was well worth waiting for!!!

COMICS
JUDGE DREDD
ANNUAL 1991
Fleetway
E4.95
Is it me or are annuals shrinking in
page size and
increasing in
price? Ho
hum!
Mind
you, this
is the ﬁrst \
Judge Dredd
annual to
deliver the
goods, in my
opinion.
There is the usual reprinted story
inside, and as usual two of the
pages are reprinted in the wrong
order, causing confusion. There is
one totally original Dredd story that
features the big man in about two
frames. The rest of the book
contains many text articles and
stories based around Mega City
One, and there is an enormous Colin
MacNeil artworked strip in glorious
colour that makes this book rather
more special than any before.
Why? Because not only is Dredd
a main character, but Johnny Alpha
and Wulf Sternhammer, the
Strontium Dogs, appear in a sort of
Back To The Future style tale that
allows Alpha fans to grasp a little of
the 'Thrill Power' that they're sure to
miss now that the mutie has passed
away in mother title 2000AD.
Not only do we get this, but there
is a wicked Jamie Hewlett cover.
Roll on Judge Dredd the megazine.
Rik Henderson
2000AD ANNUAL
1991
Fleetway
E4.95
In comparison to
its JD counterpart,
this is possibly
the weakest
2000AD
annual to
appear for
some time. It
is a mish mash
of strips based on
the comic heroes that
are currently popular,
articles, stories and listings
and a reprinted Cam Kennedy
drawn Rogue Trooper from
days long gone, which is
unfortunately the
highlight of a rather drab
affair.
The original strips,
based on Strontium
Dog, Judge Dredd,
Ground Zero, and
Moonrunners, are
pretty poorly
written, and
uninspiring to say the
least. And articles based
around the artists' favourite
covers of the last year's 2000AD are
now stale.
As one who has collected every
2000AD annual that has been
released since 1978, hopefully this is
not a mark to judge others by. I
should imagine this is because of the
sudden inﬂux of new Fleetway titles,
and the distribution amongst them of
the better artists, robbing the
mainstay title of its talent.

'MAZING MAN
SPECIAL #3
DC
$2.00
The incredible
'Mazing Man is back
in the third
collection of new
adventures since
his own title was
discontinued in 1988.
Incredible
may not be the
right word
though, to
describe the 3 foot,
childlike hero, with
baggy boxer shorts,
and a friend that looks
like a dog, but the title is certainly
amazing.
And the strangest thing is I don't
know why! The comic looks essentially
like a kids one, such as Muppet Babies
or the Reetway version of Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles, but it is in the
plotting that the real mastery is
performed. It is really an amusing look
at the more damp and dingy subjects in
life, like adultery and home eviction, and
you are left with a grin on your face, but
with ideas wizzing around in your head
that life can be just like this.
Not a good comic, a great one, the
only problem with it being the fact that it
is no longer regular due to most comic
fans completely missing the point.

nobody would pay el 9.99 for that

simulation of tennis, and to be
honest it's not that spectacular. In
theory it should be the best you're
likely to get. The controls are fairly
easy to fathom out, and there are
many, many options (like most
Accolade games) and different kinds
of shot that can be performed
without much skill involved. But
that's the problem, although you can
play it at three difﬁculty levels, the
skill factor is more a question of
timing, not a response or reactions
one.
Also the graphics are seen from a
side-on view, which is not very
practical. And when stood up against
International 3D Tennis, this is very
pale in comparison.
TKO has a similar problem,
although it is far more fun to play.
Whether or not this is because it
allows you to pummel somebody's
face and actually make it bruise and
bleed (the graphics do show this) is
neither here nor there, I enjoy it
because it is just about the most
accurate sim of the sport of boxing.
Another unique feature that
distinguishes this from the rest of the
boxing games around is the fact that
not only is the action shown in 3D
(from ﬁrst person), but it is split
screen so both players, if indeed two
players are playing, can have a face-
on view of their opponent. But
unfortunately, although there are
many many options before the ﬁght,
there are not so many during and the
play can get a tad monotonous. Ho
well.
Rack'Em is about one of my
favourite pastimes though, and is
easily the best version that has ever
appeared on the commy. Yep, its
about pool, snooker, and many other
slate table sports. And this is worth
the price of the compilation on its
own.
It is seen from a sort-of top-down
view, and it is the way the balls roll
that puts this in the highest grade.
Also it has a rather special way of
selecting the power and accuracy for
each shot by a pictorial thrusting of
the cue. And there is even an option

Title
TKO stands for Technical Knock Out, but it could also
stand for Two Killed Otters, Tasty King Orange or a
multitude of things.
Steel Thunder is what you get if you fart in the bath.
Serve or Volley is not a game about a stupid
German waiter.
Rack'Em was also very popular with the Spanish
Inquisition.

Who's the bald git poking his
gleaming cranium over that placard. If
I was cruel I'd say that looks just like
my old French Teacher, and I am so I
will!
Two men ﬁghting over a rather stupid

for beginners that allows those new
to the game to aim where they want
the ball to go, and this in turn
determines where they'll hit the cue
ball. A great game, although I've not
ﬁgured how to have only one player,
so I think you're stuck with having to
get a friend to play too.
And these three are capped with
Steel Thunder, a game reviewed not
too long ago, and it is a sort-of F-16
Combat Pilot in a tank. There are
tons of missions to be completed by
yourself and the crew which you
command, and allows you four
different tanks to take control of.
Simulations don't normally come our
way that are this good, and to ﬁnd
this one on the same compilation as
Rack'Em is a positive bonus. One
thing though, the instructions aren't
very clear and the keyboard overlay
given with the game on its solo
release is spookingly missing.
All Time Classics aren't. But they
are great games all packaged
together, and disk drive owners have
certainly got a treat on their hands
here.

hope that you have) and now

Murphy (he of the very silly name) is
back in the action adventure game
that dreams are made of. Well, if
your dreams are made of this then
I'd go and see a psychologist.
As the infamous Tex Murphy, you
are a private detective extraordinaire.
With your name it was either that or

car is your ofﬁce. I've heard of
people being in love with their
vehicles before but this is taking
things just a tad too far.
Anyway, your car can drive
(oddly enough), and it can also ﬂy
(now that really is odd). It also has
an in-car fax so you can lay claim to
being the world's ﬁrst Yuppie
detective. Using your car/ofﬁce you
have to solve the mystery of the
dead professor Linsky. Linsky's
slinky daughter Sylvia (try saying
that with your mouth full of razor
blades) has come to you with a very
odd case. Her dad the prof has
apparently topped himself but she
reckons that he was murdered. As
Tex the Private Eye you have to get
to the bottom of the whole mystery.
You can ﬂy to various locations
around the area. This is done by
inputting co-ordinates into your
navigation computer. This sets your
navigation equipment for you but
you have to ﬂy the beast yourself.
As with any ﬂight section of a game
this is more difﬁcult then it sounds.
Luckily for the thinkers-without-
reﬂexes amongst you there is the
option of autopilot. This takes you
to the scene much faster and
without the usual fatal accidents.

there will be a building of some

be searched stringently for hints.
Apartments are the homes to
suspects and witnesses and they
need to be questioned.
Warehouses are the hangouts
for the criminal elements of society.
They will shoot at you with machine
guns but you can retaliate with a
handgun. It's a tough arcade
sequence to beat but you'll have to
get through to complete the game.
And that's about all there is to it.
Flying around, searching for clues,
getting new locations, examining
objects and questioning suspects.
The clues are quite well hidden and
the mystery will not be easily
solved. However real die-hard
thinkers will ﬁnd it too arcadey for
their tastes. You need to be a
multiple game fan to really get the
most from it.
Graphically nice, sonically a little
dull, but a big game that you will
either love or hate. Me? I'm sitting
on the fence with this one. Try
before you buy.

Nope, your mother
wouldn't like what it

you'll like the band, nay

he was whisked off to

them and do lots of
silly things after their
ﬁnest gig to date.
E
serious stuff on stage and the
YC team are unwinding on the
dance ﬂoor, when the enigmatic Linda
(manager of the band) comes chillin'
over and informs us that the lads are
ready for the verbal onslaught I've
prepared. After a short while we all
decide that not only is their dressing
room small, damp and incredibly
noisy, but the heat is completely
searing and even in his baggy shorts
and T-shirt Deny, keyboards and
spokesman for the band, is burning
up. We all truck outside and sit on a
wall in front of the venue.
Soon after, it becomes apparent
that these lads, these seven radical
ravers are absolutely off their trolly,
so much so that they even
understood what the heck I was on
about, wow! Apart from this wicked
gig they've also played the Town and

going to be in this band?', because
he was in a previous band, and he
said 'yeh, I'll do it!'. And then we got
Mark (Drums), and Milf (DJ and
Mixer) was the last one."
Like I said, out of their tree, and
Ian wasn't the only person to end up
in the lake. When EMI wanted to sign

course, and not snogging girlies or
nothing, or at least that what Mill will
be doing, "I'll be playing arcade
games, can't go without it." This is
the stuff we like to hear, What's Milt's
favourite game? "All the martial arts
ones!"
And they even use a computer for
midi purposes. This is Ian's cue, who
was in the act of "snogging girlies"
(Milt's words) when asked, "Atari
1040ST". but that's not what we re
interested in. Things can
miraculously change though, "Atari
520 is it? Is that the one for the
Derry) and the reason why they
signed also had wet connections, "It
was 'cause Nick, their A&R guy, he
come down and we tested out all
games? What? The Commodore 64
is that what you said? That's the one
we use!" Hurm, dodgy!
But what every kid who's ever
picked up a guitar or drumstick
would want to know is how they
could get into the pop biz (apart from
getting thrown in a lake!). Ian again,
"I dunno, just do it, go for it! Stick to
your dreams!!!" That and writing
brilliant songs, of course, like EME
And their favourite joke? "Why
didn't seven want to stand next to
six? Because seven eight nine!"
What a way to go out! It was one
o'clock in the morning and we said
our goodbyes, but I should imagine
we'll be seeing a lot of the band very
soon.

DOMARK -
E14.99 Tape,
E19.99 Disk
Bevy babes
dolls on her
peroxide wig
and puts in her gruff mode
voice box. Will she ﬁnd the
ultimate hero or was Bonnie
Tyler calling out for a wimp?
C
wot? Bond, Barbarian,
Schwarzenegger and
Skywalker all at my very own
ﬁngertips. And why not? They're all
beefy dudes, always around when
the going gets tough, they always
get the pretty young dudettes, nifty
with their weapons (oo-er!), go to
body building evening classes and
obviously eat 3 Sheredded Wheat for
Breakfast. Yes, they're deﬁnite
heroes and more importantly all meet
up in Domark's lastest chillin'
complilation.
Remember Sanchez the drug
smuggling villain, this is your ﬁrst
test as a hero in Licence to Kill, from
the masters of Bond licences, the
Doms. This action-packed, three-
part adventure has more gun shots,
explosions and high-ﬂying stunts
than the ﬁlm itself. Your skills will be
tested to all heights in the ﬁrst part
as you take control of the helicopter
chasing Sanchez and try to gun
down that geek's jeep. Then its down
to ground for the commando style
action as you duck and shoot your
way to the helicopter with your 15-
shot Beretta. Your joystick agility will
come to play ﬁnally as you lower
Bond out of the helicopter onto
Sanchez plane (a lot harder for the
stuntman!). You'll need more than
100 metre doggie paddle for the
second part as you battle
underwater armed only with a knife
against dodgey divers. If you're lucky
enough to Harpoon the seaplane's
pontoons you could hitch yourself a
high speed water-ski lift to safety.
Back to land but not safety in the
third and ﬁnal chase sequence as
you destroy every tanker in sight
until that Sanchez brat is found and
killed.
What better hero than
Schwarzenegger (I'm talking muscles
not acting ability) would you pick to
get through the toughest game-show
on earth, a game show with a
difference - where the ultimate prize
is not a cuddly toy or a fridge freezer
but life! The Running Man the
computer game from that good old
software house in the sky,
Grandslam, closely follows the ﬁlm of
the same name in a smash-their-
face-in kinda way as you manoeuvre
hero Ben Richards through the 4
Fantasy frolicks with bouncing Maria
and her well endowed chum!
Arnie ﬂexes his very blocky muscles, or at least he would if he didn't seem as if
he were made of Lego!!!
game zones defeating all the
stalkers, guards and baddies. And
cor are there some wacky beddies,
hows about a geezer with a razor-
sharp hockey stick called Subzero or
Buzzsaw armed with a tri-tefﬂon
chainsaw, Dynamo a human
christmas tree or Fireball a red hot
ﬂame thrower. It's not baddies or
quiz show gemeplay but computer
gameplay that this one lacks.
From muscles to Sci-Fi as
Skywalker comes into play in Star
Wars, the famous Atari Coin-Op and

golden oldie from Donnark. I say oldie
as it features those endearing Vector
Graphics we all grew to love or hate.
This one player interactive game has
you steering your X-Fighter space
ship from one attack wave to
another, with the ultimate aim of
eliminating the Death Star, scoring
shoot-em-up points for various
targets depending on difﬁculty. You
start out with a number of shield
points, each hit by the enemy or
collision on your part will be one
point closer to an exploding space
ship. If this is your type of blast then
May the Force be with You! Always.
Otherwise steer the X-Fighter onto
the ﬁnal game in the quadrilogy.
Barbarian, the Palace creation is
by far the most successful hero to
emerge onto a computer screen and
Barbarian II certainly caused more
publicity by using Maria Whittaker
clothed in a golden bikini bottom and
two mini dustbin lids on a string as a

top than the Sun did using her
topless! However, I bet more time
was spent playing this masterpiece
than time spent drooling over the
box copy cos it's superb. The
graphics and animation are mind-
bogglingly awesome and as smooth
as Michael J Fox getting out the
toughest of scrapes. Ignorant and
unlucky gamesters read on.
Barbarian II is an arcade adventure
with hack-n-slay qualities. You may

Mean Pie
Three of the games are based on ﬁlms. Barbarian II is
not a movie, although it sounds much like one.
Other famous heroes include the bloke in the
corner shop for saving some refreshers for me, and
my mum who cooks a mean shepherd's pie.

be Barbarian or Princess Mariana

four levels of horriﬁc monsters,
blood, gore and sweat. There are
numerous magical objects to collect

the monster chop off your head!
As compilations go this one is
pretty damn heroic as none of the
above are available on budget, so if
you haven't already got Barbarian II
or Licence to Kill under your roof
then it's a bargain as the other two
are not that bad either. I'd award it a
Victoria Cross!
