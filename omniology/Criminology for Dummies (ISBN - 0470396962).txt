About the Author
Steven Briggs has spent most of his legal career as a criminal prosecutor, 
working at the local, state, and federal levels. He has handled cases from 
petty theft to organized crime and capital murder. Several of his cases have 
been broadcast on national TV and have become the subjects of true crime 
books. Mr. Briggs also oversaw his state’s criminal division, where he man­
aged the organized crime, financial crime, and criminal intelligence units, as 
well as the state anti-terrorism and crime victim’s programs. In addition, Mr. 
Briggs managed his state’s district attorney assistance prosecution unit and 
special agents unit, which targeted complex crime, including Internet preda­
tors, social security fraud, and narcotics traffickers. An accomplished trainer, 
Mr. Briggs has regularly instructed state, national, and international audiences 
on a variety of criminal justice topics. A graduate of Dartmouth College and 
the University of Oregon School of Law, Mr. Briggs was a college football 
coach before pursuing his legal career.

Author’s Acknowledgments
I would like to give a big thanks to my agent, Barbara Doyen, as well as 
Development Editor Joan Friedman for their excellent work and guidance in 
preparing this book. Technical Editor Ken Rueben was, as always, a great 
resource and friend. Internationally recognized juvenile justice expert David 
Koch was very gracious with his time, as was Cynthia Stinson, the most 
knowledgeable person I know on the topic of crime victim services. Copy 
Editor Amanda Gillum and Project Editor Natalie Faye Harris worked very 
hard on improving this book’s readability. I must also acknowledge the 
lingering influence of Blinker Black and all his fraters. Finally, I would like to 
thank the men and women of the criminal division, who were not only the 
source of many great examples in this book, but whose sacrifice of personal 
interest in the pursuit of justice has been a constant inspiration to me.

Introduction
C

rime is fascinating. How else can you explain why, as I’m writing this 
book, six of the top ten TV shows focus on criminal investigations (and 
right in the heart of the American Idol and Dancing with the Stars seasons, 
too!)? But the study of crime is not only fascinating, it’s also terribly impor­
tant. The U.S. government (and, in turn, every U.S. taxpayer) spends hun­
dreds of billions of dollars every year combating crime. Are the government’s 
efforts smart? Are they enough?
I’ve spent most of my career fighting crime at the local, state, and federal levels. 
I’ve worked with just about every category of law enforcement professional 
there is, from detectives to probation officers to terrorism experts to judges. 
And of the thousands of people I’ve known, I can count on one hand the number 
of people who weren’t committed to something larger than themselves — to 
serving their fellow human beings. If you’re considering joining these men 
and women in their fight against crime, you’ve picked up the right book.
In this book, I explore both the world of crime and society’s response to 
it. Both topics are fascinating, exciting, and extremely vast. From the gang 
banger who sells eight balls of crack on the street corner to the cop who’s 
just trying to get home to his wife, I try to explain what people do and why 
they do it.
About This Book
Criminology For Dummies isn’t a textbook (although, if you’re a student, it may 
help you actually understand your criminology textbook). It’s meant to give 
you an insider’s look into the world of crime and criminal justice. Throughout 
the book, I try to make the concepts and principles of criminology come alive 
because nothing is more real than personally experiencing crime.
I try very hard to avoid the use of complex terms in this book. As a pros­
ecutor who has stood in front of numerous juries, I know that the secret to 
communicating is using straightforward language. Some of the ideas in crimi­
nology are complex, but their explanations don’t have to be.
If you’re considering a career in criminal justice, you should know that I don’t 
pull any punches in this book. If I think a job is tough, I tell you so and give 

2
Criminology For Dummies 
you the reasons why. But I also try to explain the job objectively so that you 
can decide for yourself whether it’s the right move for you.
If you picked up this book simply because you’re fascinated by crime, you 
may want to set this book on the nightstand next to your collection of works 
by Ann Rule, Sue Grafton, Patricia Cornwell, James Patterson, or the hun­
dreds of other writers who make crime — at least the fictional kind — fun.
Conventions Used in This Book
Whenever I introduce a word or phrase that may not be familiar to you, I put 
that word in italics. You can rest assured that a definition or explanation is 
nearby.
On occasion, I include URLs for Web sites that I think may interest you. Those 
Web addresses appear in monofont, which helps them stand out from the 
rest of the text.
And speaking of Web addresses: When this book was printed, some Web 
addresses had to break across two lines of text. When that happened, rest 
assured that I didn’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate 
the break. So, when you’re using one of these Web addresses, just type in 
exactly what you see in this book, pretending that the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
Given the amount of work that goes into writing a book, it may seem strange 
that I’m now suggesting that you don’t have to read the whole thing! But 
my goal is to make sure you use the book to your full advantage, which 
may mean skipping over text that isn’t crucial to your understanding of 
the subject at hand. In this book, you find two types of text that fall into this 
category:
 
✓ Paragraphs accompanied by the Technical Stuff icon: As I explain in a 
moment, this icon highlights text that goes into details that you may find 
unnecessary.
 
✓ Sidebars: These gray boxes contain anecdotes or explanations that I 
think you may find interesting but that aren’t essential to your 
criminology education.

 Introduction
Foolish Assumptions
This book covers such a wide array of information that I truly can’t assume I 
know why you’re reading it. Here are some wild guesses:
 
✓ You’re a college student taking an introductory course in criminology, 
and you picked up this book to help you interpret some of the jargon in 
your 600-page textbook.
 
✓ You’ve always thought about becoming a police officer or other law 
enforcement professional and are trying to gauge what the job entails 
and where it fits into the big picture of criminal justice.
 
✓ You’re thinking about going to law school to become a prosecutor or 
public defender, and you want to know what you’d be in for.
 
✓ You have a friend or relative entangled in the criminal justice system, 
and you want to be able to talk the talk so you can distinguish an 
arraignment from an appeal.
 
✓ You’re addicted to CSI: Crime Scene Investigation or any number of other 
criminal investigation shows.
Whatever your motivation, I hope you find what you’re looking for in this 
book. And I hope you’re inspired to find out even more about the specific 
area of criminology that interests you because there’s much more to explore 
than I could possibly fit in these pages.
How This Book Is Organized
I’ve grouped the chapters in this book into six parts, each one focusing on a 
particular aspect of criminology. I’ve written the book so you can dive into 
any chapter without getting lost — just pick the topic that interests you most 
and start reading!
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime
Chapter 1 offers a broad overview of the book’s contents so you can gain a 
better sense of what’s covered and where to find it.
Starting with Chapter 2, I delve into some tough questions. The first ques­
tion is: What is crime? When you think about it, someone has to define crime, 

4
Criminology For Dummies 
right? Actually, it’s most often defined by a group of someones whom folks 
like you and me elect to state and federal offices. The decisions these elected 
officials make about criminal law have far-reaching effects; they influence 
what actions are prosecuted and punished and, perhaps, how long punish­
ments can last.
Another tough question I address in this part is: How much crime is there? 
Measuring crime can be a bit like measuring water with a sieve. In Chapter 3, 
I explain why.
No matter how you measure crime, almost every crime has one thing in 
common — a victim. In Chapter 4, I describe the various ways crime affects 
victims, and I explore recent efforts to secure victims’ rights throughout the 
criminal justice process.
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime
The crimes that get the most attention on TV are violent in nature, so I start 
this part by defining and explaining the different types of violent crime in 
Chapter 5. But far more people are victims of property crime than violent 
crime; thus, I devote Chapter 6 to that topic.
Chapter 7 focuses on the unique nature of white-collar crime, and Chapter 8 
explores the fascinating and frightening world of organized crime (including 
gangs).
I round out this part by devoting a chapter each to two topics that make 
front-page news all too frequently these days: the drug trade and terrorism.
Part III: Figuring Out Who 
Commits Crimes and Why
The heart of criminology is trying to figure out why people commit crime. 
After all, if you can answer that fundamental question, you may have a 
chance of reducing crime.
Obviously, no one claims to have a single answer. In this part, I explore sev­
eral theories that seem to offer insights, from the rational choice theory 
(which holds that criminals make rational decisions based on the costs and 
benefits of their actions) to the theory of labeling (which holds that people 
labeled as criminals early in life have limited opportunities and, therefore, 
can’t break free from lives of crime).

 Introduction
Part IV: Fighting Crime
TV producers sure love this stage of the criminal justice process — the stage 
that involves chasing and apprehending the bad guys. The chase may involve 
either local law enforcement officials or federal agencies, so I devote a chap­
ter to explaining each. I then explore the processes that law enforcement offi­
cers use to try to solve crimes.
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime
Although the chase and apprehension of a suspect are exciting, what hap­
pens next can be equally riveting (hence the appeal of Law & Order). After all, 
when someone is arrested, that person’s experience with the criminal justice 
system is just beginning.
In this part, I introduce the people who carry a criminal case through the 
courtroom phase. I explain what accepting a plea bargain means and what 
happens when a case goes to trial (which relatively few cases do).
When the prosecution is done and the accused person is sentenced, that 
person enters the punishment phase of the criminal justice system. In 
Chapter 21, I explore theories of why society punishes people and explain 
how punishment typically occurs in the United States.
I round out this part with a chapter that focuses on juvenile offenders, whose 
crimes may be similar to those of adults but whose experience with the crimi­
nal justice system is likely to be very different.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book contains this part, which features short chapters of 
easily digestible material. You get two chapters in this part: one on ten jobs 
to consider in the criminal justice field and one on ten notorious, unsolved 
crimes.
Icons Used in This Book
In the margins of this book, you find the following icons — mini graphics that 
point out paragraphs containing certain types of information:

Criminology For Dummies 
	
This icon points out hints to help you better understand the concepts I cover 
in this book.
	
This icon sits next to paragraphs that contain real-life examples and anecdotes — 
most often from my years of experience in the criminal justice field.
	
This icon points out material that’s important enough to put into your mental 
filing cabinet.
	
When you see this icon, you know the information in the accompanying para­
graph encourages a note of caution.
	
On a few occasions, I include information that I consider worth knowing but 
that you may not. If you’re looking for strictly big-picture information, feel free 
to skip these paragraphs.
Where to Go from Here
The beauty of this book is that you can start anywhere and understand it. If 
you’re the type of person who likes to eat your dinner one food at a time, 
perhaps you want to start with Chapter 1 and read straight through. But if 
you’re most interested in the theories about why people commit crime, skip 
straight to Part III and sink your teeth in. If you’re most interested in how the 
criminal justice system treats juveniles, head to Chapter 22. Where you go 
next is your call!

Part I
Defining and 
Measuring Crime

In this part . . .
W

hat exactly is crime? When you think about it, you 
realize it’s not such an easy question to answer. 
After all, someone has to decide that a specific action is 
criminal and, therefore, worth prosecuting and punishing. 
To complicate matters, the actions that the law labels 
criminal change as time goes by — new laws are added 
and old ones are revised.
Here’s another tough question: How much crime is there? 
No one knows the exact amount. The methods for measuring 
crime are imperfect, partly because police reporting is 
imperfect and partly because crime stats depend on a 
victim’s willingness to come forward.
In this part, I offer my best answers to these two questions 
and explain some of the nuances that color those answers. 
I also describe how crime impacts victims and explore a 
few recent movements to try to support and empower 
them.

E

ntering the world of crime — and I mean really entering it — seriously 
affects a person. Working in a world of violence and deceit is a hard and 
trying business. Nonetheless, criminologists and criminal justice profession­
als devote their lives to studying crime and criminals with the ultimate goal 
of keeping people safe. In this chapter, you get a brief overview of the crimi­
nal world — from what causes crime to what society can do about it.
Defining the Terms: What Crime 
Is and How You Measure It
Technically, a crime is what your legislature says it is. If legislators want to 
outlaw riding a horse over 10 mph, they can. (It’s against the law to do so in 
Indianapolis, for example.)
	
But just outlawing an activity doesn’t make it a crime. For example, running a 
red light is illegal, but it isn’t a crime. A crime is something you can get locked 
up for.
Taking away a person’s liberty is what separates criminal conduct from ille­
gal conduct. And when the possibility of going to jail is involved, you have a 

10
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
number of constitutional rights that you don’t have when you’re caught for a 
traffic violation, including the following:
 
✓ The right to an attorney
 
✓ The right to a jury, which can convict you only if the evidence is beyond 
a reasonable doubt
 
✓ The right to remain silent and not have your silence used against you
Identifying elements of criminal behavior
Crime isn’t as simple as it seems at first blush. If I signed my credit card receipt 
in a store and accidentally walked away with the pen, did I commit theft? Of 
course not. I didn’t intend to steal the pen. To be guilty of a crime, I must 
have some mental culpability, such as criminal intent. Taking a pen is a crime 
only if a prosecutor can prove that I intended to deprive the owner of his pen.
In addition, committing a crime requires a physical act. It’s not illegal just 
to think about committing a crime; you must physically do something. (Of 
course, a few exceptions exist. For example, not paying your taxes can con­
stitute a crime.) I explore the elements of a criminal law (which is a law that 
defines a crime) in greater detail in Chapter 2.
Not all crimes are equal. The law breaks down crimes into two categories, 
according to seriousness:
 
✓ Misdemeanor: This type of crime includes the least serious offenses. 
Historically, misdemeanor crimes were crimes that couldn’t be punished 
by more than a year in jail. Today, however, because overcrowding in 
jails is a serious problem, people convicted of misdemeanors, especially 
first-time offenders, aren’t likely to get much jail time at all.
 
✓ Felony: This type of crime is usually more serious and is punishable by 
more than a year in custody. Serious violent crimes like murder, rape, 
kidnapping, and robbery are felonies that can result in lengthy prison 
sentences.
Gathering crime statistics
You may think that determining the amount of crime in a given city, state, or 
country is a pretty simple task. But, in reality, it’s very challenging. For example, 
how do you gather statistics about illegal drug sales? Neither the seller nor the 
buyer is going to report a heroin deal. And wives who are beaten by their hus­
bands don’t usually call the cops. In fact, less than 50 percent of violent crimes 
and less than 40 percent of property crimes are ever reported to the police.

11
 Chapter 1: Entering the World of Crime
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has developed a system called 
the Uniform Crime Report for gathering basic statistics about nine serious 
felonies, known in the crime business as Part 1 crimes. Whenever one of the 
roughly 17,000 police agencies in the United States gets a report that one of 
these crimes has been committed, that agency passes the information on to 
the FBI. If the agency ends up making an arrest, it passes that information on, 
as well. The FBI incorporates this information in its annual crime report.
Recognizing the limits of crime reports and arrest statistics in measuring 
crime, the federal government created the National Crime Victimization 
Survey, which canvasses 76,000 households every year to ask whether mem­
bers of those households have been victimized by crime. The idea is that 
this survey can gather information about crimes that aren’t reported to the 
police. This survey paints a pretty good picture of national crime trends, but 
the sampling just isn’t large enough to allow for an accurate assessment of 
crime trends at the state or local level. In Chapter 3, I get into the crime sta­
tistics business in much greater detail.
Recognizing the Various Costs of Crime
While criminologists try to gather accurate statistics about the amount of 
crime, economists focus on the financial costs of crime. And, of course, no 
one can forget the life-changing impact crime has on victims.
Noting the financial impact
The most obvious cost of crime to society is the money it takes to run the 
criminal justice system, including the following big-ticket items:
 
✓ Police
 
✓ Jails, prisons, and the staff to run them
 
✓ Prosecutors
 
✓ Judges and court staff
 
✓ Defense attorneys to represent charged defendants at trial and on 
appeal
 
✓ Probation officers
 
✓ Juvenile justice counselors
Plus, in the United States, each of the three levels of government — local, 
state, and federal — may run its own justice system, which may include some 
or all of the preceding expenses.

12
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
In addition to governmental costs, society bears many other financial impacts 
of crime. For example, think of the lost productivity and lost tax revenue that 
occurs when a person decides to sell drugs rather than earn wages lawfully. 
Or think of the costs of providing medical care to victims of violence or the 
costs of developing cybersecurity for a corporation to protect its computer 
systems. The financial impact of crime is quite startling when you dive into it. 
In Chapter 3, I provide more details on the true cost of crime to all of society.
Respecting the price a victim pays
Crime doesn’t just carry an economic cost, however. Every day, thousands 
of lives are turned upside down by criminal violence and theft. Think of the 
impact on a senior citizen who’s defrauded out of her life savings or on a bat­
tered spouse who’s isolated from her friends and family and lives in constant 
fear of upsetting her husband. There’s simply no way to quantify the human 
toll of crime.
Until about 30 years ago, crime victims were pretty much left to fend for 
themselves. But in the early 1980s, a movement that brought help to victims 
began. Today, in every state, a victim of violent crime can get financial help 
with medical bills, grief counseling, lost wages, and other economic losses. 
Victims can also get help understanding the criminal justice system.
Significantly, within the last ten years, a movement to grant rights to victims 
has gathered tremendous momentum. In most states today, victims have at 
least the following rights:
 
✓ The right to be notified of all important hearings
 
✓ The right to speak at release hearings where criminal defendants seek to 
be released from jail
 
✓ The right to obtain a “no contact” order, which prohibits the defendant 
from contacting the victim
 
✓ The right to prevent the defendant from getting the victim’s address
 
✓ The right to demand a blood test of the defendant if there’s a possibility 
that a disease, such as HIV or hepatitis, was transferred to the victim 
during the crime
 
✓ The right to receive restitution for financial impact from a crime
 
✓ The right to give a statement to the judge explaining the impact of the 
crime on the victim at the time of sentencing the defendant
For much more information about what the criminal justice system does to 
protect victims, see Chapter 4.

13
 Chapter 1: Entering the World of Crime
Considering Categories of Crime
Law enforcement professionals often group crimes into the following two 
categories:
 
✓ Violent crimes (also called person crimes)
 
✓ Property crimes
But a careful study of crime reveals that organized crime, in which groups engage 
in a business of crime, is a whole different animal worthy of separate analysis.
Studying individual crimes
When police respond to a 9-1-1 call, they’re almost always responding to 
an individual crime. Someone was assaulted or burglarized, for example. 
Typically, police treat violent crimes much more seriously than they do prop­
erty crimes. For example, although a murder investigation may have ten or 
more cops assigned to it, police may not even respond in person to investi­
gate a burglary at a home. Obviously, this discrepancy occurs because pro­
tecting personal safety is the number one job of people in law enforcement; 
plus, police resources are finite.
Here are the crimes you most likely think of when you consider individual crimes:
Violent Crimes
Property Crimes
Murder and manslaughter
Theft (including shoplifting, 
embezzlement, Internet fraud, 
identity theft, and car theft)
Assault and battery (including 
domestic abuse, child abuse, and 
vehicular assault)
Burglary
Sexual crimes (rape, sodomy, 
and child molestation)
Arson
Robbery
Obviously, the punishment for violent crime is much more severe than it is 
for property crime. A person who shoplifts from a convenience store (a prop­
erty crime) will get a much lighter sentence than someone who sticks a gun 
in the store clerk’s face and demands cash (the violent crime of robbery).

14
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
Among different violent offenses, the punishment can vary depending on 
whether a weapon was used, how much harm was caused, and whether 
the bad guy intended to cause harm. For example, a drunk driver who 
crashes and kills his passenger will receive a much shorter prison sentence 
than a woman who knowingly poisons her mother-in-law. The drunk driver 
didn’t intend to kill anyone, but the evil daughter-in-law surely did. (For 
more info, check out Chapter 5 on violent crimes and Chapter 6 on property 
crimes.)
Focusing on organized crime
Despite what you see on TV, organized crime is much more than the Italian 
mob. In fact, the mafia is really only a very small part of the organized crime 
threat in the United States today. Organized crime refers to the groups of indi­
viduals who organize themselves in a hierarchical structure, usually for the 
purpose of engaging in the business of crime. These groups are set up in such 
a way that even when police arrest one or two members, the organization 
continues to operate. This structure is what makes fighting organized crime 
so difficult.
Organized crime groups are traditionally set up along ethnic lines, in large 
part, because members of the same ethnic group are more likely to know and 
trust one another. (However, a group called the United Nations gang, known 
for its ethnic diversity, was taken down in May 2009 for a large-scale drug-
smuggling operation between Canada and the United States.)
Some common organized crime groups include
 
✓ Motorcycle gangs
 
✓ Drug-smuggling operations
 
✓ Prison gangs
 
✓ Street gangs
 
✓ White-supremacist organizations
These groups usually gravitate toward the types of criminal activities that 
provide the most income. Obviously, much of this activity includes illegal 
drugs. But it also includes tobacco smuggling, trafficking in counterfeit 
goods, and Internet fraud. Plus, you can’t forget the more traditional, local­
ized organized crime activities, such as extortion, loan sharking, and robbery. 
And some groups, like white-supremacist criminal organizations, aren’t as 
interested in making money; they’re actually closer to being terrorist organi­
zations. In Chapter 8, I go into much greater detail about the organized crime 
threat and how law enforcement is dealing with it.

15
 Chapter 1: Entering the World of Crime
Spotlighting terrorism
Throughout the world, and here in the United States, organized groups are 
using violence and the threat of violence to achieve political and social goals. 
These groups are called terrorists, and, today, criminal justice profession­
als are on the front lines in the fight against terrorism. Most known terrorist 
plots in the United States have been first identified or foiled by local police. 
As a result, it’s standard practice for cops throughout the country to be 
trained in identifying signs of terrorist activity.
Terrorism experts generally categorize the terrorist threat into two groups: 
international terrorist organizations and domestic organizations. But, in 
reality, hundreds of international groups have many different agendas, and 
numerous domestic terrorist groups tout principles ranging from animal 
rights to white supremacy.
While law enforcement tends to investigate terrorists using the same methods 
used to attack organized crime, a significant threat continues to be the “lone wolf” 
actor, who goes at it alone (or perhaps works with a buddy). Timothy McVeigh and 
Terry Nichols, who killed 168 people by bombing the federal building in Oklahoma 
City, are prime examples. Such lone wolf attacks are very challenging to detect 
because the attackers don’t communicate their plans to accomplices.
In Chapter 10, I discuss the major international and domestic terrorist threats 
that the United States faces today.
Figuring Out What Makes Someone 
Commit a Crime
One significant branch of criminology focuses on determining the causes of 
crime. Why do some people become life-long criminals while others become pro­
ductive members of society? If criminologists — or anyone for that matter — can 
answer this question, maybe they can figure out some ways to prevent crime.
The following sections just skim the surface of the major theories criminolo­
gists have developed for why people commit crime. For a much more detailed 
discussion of the various causes of crime, check out Chapters 12 through 15.
Making a rational decision
Underlying society’s current response to crime is the rational choice theory, 
which says that people generally make rational decisions about choices in 

16
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
their lives, including decisions to commit crime. This theory holds that when 
deciding whether to commit an illegal act, a person assesses the potential 
rewards and risks and then acts accordingly. If society provides enough pun­
ishment, a rational actor will decide not to commit crime. Thus, the threat of 
punishment acts as a deterrent to committing crime.
Of course, not everyone acts rationally. Human beings are prone to doing 
stupid things, even when they know they’re stupid. And then, of course, you 
can’t forget the impact of drugs and mental illness. A person high on metham­
phetamine probably won’t do a very good job of analyzing potential risks and 
rewards.
Pointing the finger at society
Sometimes people make rational choices to engage in crime because their 
values are significantly different from those of normal society. For example, 
a gang banger may rationally choose to commit assault to gain status within 
his gang. How does a person develop such antisocial values?
Criminologists have developed a number of theories to explain society’s role 
in crime. Social disorganization theory, for example, asserts that the structure 
of a neighborhood is strongly correlated to the amount of crime in that neigh­
borhood. Where social structures are in decay, more crime is likely to occur. 
Poor schools, high unemployment, and a mix of commercial and residential 
property are some of the indicators of social disorganization.
Strain theory contends that everyone in society has generally the same goals and 
ambitions. But some people aren’t able to achieve those goals because they lack 
opportunity, attend poor schools, or have few positive role models, for example. 
In response, they resort to crime to achieve their goals. In other words, the frus­
tration, or strain, of not achieving their goals leads them to commit crime. A vari­
ety of strain theories focus on different causes of frustration.
Yet another theory, called the social learning theory, contends that criminals 
learn the skills, attitudes, and behaviors that lead to crime from the people 
they hang out with. Under this theory, a person’s peer group and family are 
instrumental in shaping the values that lead them to criminal or law-abiding 
behavior.
Other explanations for crime come from a collection of theories known as 
social control theories. Generally, these theories argue that crime is exciting 
and fun and provides immediate gratification, so most people would become 
criminals if not for a variety of “controls” that restrain the urge to commit 
crime. These controls may be external, such as family, schools, church, and 
the social bonds related to these organizations. Or, they may be internal, 
such as self-discipline and strong self-esteem. In neighborhoods where insti­
tutional controls are weak, more crime occurs.

 Chapter 1: Entering the World of Crime
Blaming mental and physical defects
It’s increasingly clear that genetics, diet, brain chemistry, and even the envi­
ronment can play a role in causing a person to commit crime.
Adoption studies have confirmed a genetic link between criminal parents and 
criminal conduct by their offspring. But these same studies also show that 
the environment created by the parents raising the children has an impact on 
the children’s criminal conduct. Thus, criminologists recognize that genetics 
are just part of the picture.
Other studies have shown that a poor diet can lead to learning disabilities, 
attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and depression, all of which are 
linked to greater potential for criminal behavior.
And, of course, personality disorders and mental illnesses may create a greater 
likelihood of criminal behavior. For example, a large percentage of people in 
prison have an antisocial personality disorder, which generally means they’ve 
engaged in a pattern of behavior that violates the rights of others.
Waging a War against Crime
Society fights crime with three levels of police: Local, state, and federal. Each 
level has different responsibilities, but they all join forces when it comes to 
fighting organized crime.
Policing the streets
Of the 17,000 police agencies in the United States, most of them are local 
agencies, which means they’re city police or county sheriffs. These agen­
cies handle most of the emergency calls for police services. In addition to 
responding to 9-1-1 calls, however, local police patrol the streets and enforce 
traffic laws. In fact, the only interaction most people have with a cop is get­
ting pulled over for a traffic violation.
Although local agencies can range in size from one officer to thousands, most 
departments have the following categories of cops:
 
✓ Patrol officers: Respond to 9-1-1 calls and drive the streets to try to dis­
courage crime with their presence.
 
✓ Sergeants: Typically supervise five to ten officers.
 
✓ Detectives: Conduct criminal investigations. Rather than just responding 
to a 9-1-1 call and writing a report, a detective typically is assigned more 

18
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
complex cases that require longer-term investigations. A smaller police 
department may have just a general detective unit, while a larger depart­
ment may have detectives who specialize in specific types of crime, such 
as homicide.
 
✓ Management: Includes lieutenants, captains, and the chief of police or 
sheriff.
In Chapter 16, I discuss the functions of all these cops in detail.
Getting the feds involved
Although the federal government has over 65 different federal agencies with 
law enforcement personnel, the vast majority of federal officers work for 
agencies I’m sure you’ve heard of, including the following:
 
✓ Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
 
✓ Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
 
✓ Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF)
 
✓ Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which used to be the INS 
and the Customs Service
 
✓ Secret Service
 
✓ U.S. Marshal’s Service
 
✓ Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
These agencies enforce federal criminal laws, which are criminal laws passed 
by the U.S. Congress. (Local police agencies typically enforce local or state 
laws.) Each of these agencies focuses on its area of specialty, with the FBI 
having broader authority to get into more types of crime. An officer with a 
federal agency is usually called a special agent and conducts complex, long-
term investigations. Special agents don’t respond to 9-1-1 calls or enforce traf­
fic laws. If you’re intrigued by life as a fed, look at Chapter 17 where I give you 
a brief overview of the major federal law enforcement agencies.
Working together in task forces
Because organized crime frequently crosses the territorial boundary of one 
police agency, local, state, and federal cops often come together to form task 
forces, which fight a specific type of crime. Most commonly, officers from 
different agencies work together on drug or gang task forces. For example, 

19
 Chapter 1: Entering the World of Crime
when a drug mule carries dope from one city into another, the task force has 
authority in each town to conduct surveillance and make arrests.
One of the greatest benefits of task forces is that they encourage information 
sharing between different agencies. When agencies combine their informa­
tion about a particular organized crime group, they often create a much 
better picture of the threat and are then able to devise a strategy to investi­
gate and eliminate that threat. Because so many different police agencies are 
working toward the same goal of public safety, cooperation among them is 
crucial, and task forces help to foster that cooperation.
Bringing Criminals to Justice
When police catch a criminal, that person enters a large, complex system 
that is set up to make sure that individual’s constitutional rights are pro­
tected at the same time that society as a whole is protected.
Prosecuting crime
After police make an arrest, a prosecutor must determine whether or not to file 
criminal charges. (At the local level, a prosecutor is usually known as an assistant 
district attorney or county prosecutor. At the federal level, prosecutors are called 
assistant U.S. attorneys.) After reading a police officer’s report, if a prosecutor 
decides to file charges, he drafts a charging document, sometimes called an infor­
mation or an indictment, which lists all the criminal charges against the defendant.
At the arraignment, the defendant hears the charges against him and has the 
chance to apply for a court-appointed attorney. (Most defendants can’t afford 
to hire their own lawyers.) Thereafter, the prosecutor and the defense attorney 
engage in plea negotiations. The vast majority of criminal cases are resolved by 
negotiations and don’t go to trial. But if the lawyers can’t agree, they do go to 
trial, where a jury decides whether or not the defendant is guilty. (A defendant 
can choose to waive his right to a jury and let a judge decide the case.) I discuss 
the responsibilities of prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges in Chapter 19, 
and I walk you through all the steps of a typical criminal trial in Chapter 20.
Determining punishment
If a defendant is convicted, the judge decides what punishment to impose, 
although many states have taken away most of a judge’s discretion by passing 

20
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
laws that provide for mandatory sentences for certain serious crimes. Low-
level offenses often don’t result in any jail time. Rather, a defendant may just 
receive a fine, some community service, and probation. But serious offenses 
can result in lengthy sentences.
A person sentenced to do time can go to either a local jail, usually run by a 
county sheriff, or a prison, run by a state or the federal government. Jail is 
usually reserved for shorter sentences, and prison often involves sentences 
of a year or more.
After serving their time, convicted persons are often placed on probation or 
parole, which means they have to comply with certain conditions imposed by 
the judge or else be sent back to jail or prison. Here are some typical proba­
tion conditions:
 
✓ Pay all court costs and fines
 
✓ Complete community service
 
✓ Attend all ordered treatment, such as drug treatment, anger manage­
ment, or sex offender treatment
 
✓ Obey all laws (of course!)
In Chapter 21, I talk about the U.S. corrections system, which is made up of the 
jails, prisons, and probation services that house convicted defendants and 
attempt to get them back on a law-abiding track.
Giving juveniles special attention
What do you do with a kid who commits a crime? In the United States, the 
system for dealing with juvenile offenders is different from the one dealing 
with adults. The primary reason for having a separate system is that society 
recognizes that because kids aren’t yet mature, society shouldn’t hold them 
fully responsible for their misconduct. Recent science supports the idea that 
until children’s brains are fully developed (at around the age of 25), they’re 
more likely to be impulsive and exercise poor judgment. Thus, it’s no wonder 
that roughly half of all crimes are committed by people under the age of 25.
When a juvenile is arrested, he’s assigned a juvenile counselor who works 
closely with him to get him back on the law-abiding track, which means iden­
tifying problems at home, drug use, or other environmental factors that are 
causing difficulty.
Most juveniles are given the chance to avoid formal trials and, thus, avoid 
creating permanent records by handling their cases informally. In other 

21
 Chapter 1: Entering the World of Crime
words, they admit their conduct to the juvenile counselor and are given some 
form of light punishment, such as community service.
For more serious offenses, or for chronic offenders, the system may treat the 
juvenile formally. This means he has the right to an attorney and a trial before 
a judge. If he’s found responsible (kids aren’t found “guilty”), the judge can 
sentence him to do some time in a local juvenile facility or even a state-run 
youth correctional facility — the equivalent of an adult state prison. However, 
recognizing that incarcerating kids is often counterproductive, there’s a 
strong bias against ordering kids to do time. Usually judges don’t incarcerate 
kids unless they repeatedly violate their probation.
For very serious offenses, such as murder or rape, all states have laws that 
allow judges to waive the kid into adult court. In other words, the kid is tried 
like an adult and, if found guilty, sentenced like an adult. So in most states, a 
16-year-old murderer can be sentenced to life in prison. If you’re interested in 
more details about the juvenile justice system, turn to Chapter 22.

n Oregon, threatening to kill someone in the future is legal, but preventing 
a pregnant pig from lying down is illegal. Seriously.
The good news is that if you choose to make a pregnant pig unhappy in 
Oregon, you’re breaking the law but not committing a crime. What’s the dif­
ference? Well, criminal activities carry the possibility of jail time with them, 
but not all illegal activities are criminal. (For example, messing with a preg­
nant pig may be punished only with a fine — what a relief!)
In this chapter, I explain how laws are created and why they change over 
time. I also show you the essential elements of a criminal law, which are 
important to know because the way in which criminal laws are written largely 
determines whether they achieve their goals in the long run.
Understanding the Two Categories 
of Criminal Activity
At the simplest level, you can break criminal activity into two categories:
 
✓ Acts that are inherently bad
 
✓ Acts that aren’t bad but need to be regulated
Check out the following sections for more details on these categories.

24
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
Violating natural laws: Acts 
that are inherently bad
When you think of criminal activity, you likely think first of violent acts, such 
as murder, rape, kidnapping, theft, and assault. Crimes like these are known as 
mala in se, which is Latin for “wrong by itself.” (A few lawyers, myself included, 
still like to throw around Latin phrases — it makes us sound smart, right?)
Mala in se crimes are bad acts that people instinctively know are crimes. A 
general consensus in society says that these acts should be illegal because 
they’re immoral. This consensus didn’t just spring up overnight — it has been 
developing as part of English and U.S. common law over the last 600 years.
	
The term common law refers to laws created by court decisions rather than by 
legislative bodies.
Today, legislatures in most states have passed laws making mala in se 
acts criminal, which means that the justice system no longer relies on the 
common law to convict someone of this type of crime. (However, common 
law continues to play an important role in appellate decisions — court deci­
sions made during appeals after people are convicted of crimes. See Chapter 
19 for a detailed discussion of appellate courts.)
How the common law developed
In England prior to the 1600s, private citizens or 
government officials brought cases before 
judges, who would then decide whether certain 
acts were illegal. The judges wrote opinions that 
contained the reasoning behind their decisions. 
Over time, judges came to rely on the consensus 
that emerged from these opinions. The collec­
tion of these written opinions came to be known 
as the common law. By the 1600s, the judges — 
not the English Parliament — had defined crimes 
such as murder, theft, rape, and assault.
Of course, clever citizens repeatedly found new 
ways to commit immoral acts, so society con­
tinued to call on judges to refine the common 
law by defining new crimes. For example, in the 
1700s, judges concluded that inciting rebellion 
against the government should be criminalized; 
thus, they created the crime of sedition.
Sometimes judges didn’t criminalize certain con­
duct, such as incest, and, as a result, the English 
Parliament stepped in to pass a law (known as a 
statute) that made familial sex a crime.
Today, common law plays a less important role 
than it did centuries ago. In the United States, 
people are prosecuted when they violate stat­
utes — laws enacted by legislatures — rather 
than when they violate the common law. But, 
like in England centuries ago, human beings still 
find new ways to commit immoral acts, so legis­
latures must constantly refine and add to their 
criminal statutes.

25
 Chapter 2: What Is Crime?
Violating manmade laws: Acts 
that aren’t inherently bad
Although some acts are clearly wrong, many others aren’t naturally evil, but, 
nonetheless, they need to be regulated. These acts are known as malum in 
prohibitum, meaning “wrong because prohibited.” Preventing a pregnant pig 
from lying down, for instance, clearly falls within this category. In fact, a large 
percentage of criminal laws today are malum in prohibitum. Following are 
some other examples of malum in prohibitum crimes:
 
✓ Driving under the influence of intoxicants
 
✓ Driving without a license
 
✓ Hunting without a license
 
✓ Carrying a concealed weapon
 
✓ Selling a drugged horse (in Oregon)
 
✓ Catching fish with your bare hands (in Indiana)
 
✓ Throwing snow “missiles” (in certain parts of Missouri)
	
The line between mala in se and malum in prohibitum crimes isn’t always 
crystal clear. For example, some malum in prohibitum crimes involve con­
duct that’s arguably immoral. I wouldn’t argue that driving without a license 
is immoral. However, the law against selling a drugged horse exists because 
unscrupulous horse traders used to sedate horses to make them more attrac­
tive to purchasers. The courts decided to regulate this conduct because soci­
ety considers cheating the buyer an immoral act.
As you can see, laws can punish acts that are moral or immoral. But keep in 
mind that not all immoral acts are punished by laws. Legislatures don’t want 
to try to control every facet of human life through regulation. For example, 
most people agree that sleeping with your best friend’s spouse is immoral, 
yet doing so is completely legal.
Identifying Elements of a Criminal Law
The U.S. justice system includes many types of law, such as property law, 
contract law, tort law, and administrative law. These examples all fall under 
the broad heading of civil law. Civil law generally governs the affairs between 
private parties. For example, civil law decides the fault in a car accident and 
interprets the terms of a contract in a dispute. For a law to be considered 
criminal, on the other hand, it must contain certain elements and characteris­
tics, which I explain in this section.

26
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
Distinguishing civil from criminal law
Most civil and criminal laws alike are created to redress wrongs or to compel 
good behavior. However, civil law and criminal law have unique characteris­
tics that distinguish them from each other. For example,
 
✓ A civil lawsuit is almost always between private parties, but only the 
government can bring a criminal proceeding.
 
✓ Only in criminal law can a person lose his freedom and be sent to jail or 
prison. When a plaintiff (the person bringing the case) wins a civil lawsuit, 
he typically gets an award of money, but he can’t put the other party in jail.
 
✓ In criminal law, the defendant has certain constitutional rights that a defen­
dant in a civil lawsuit doesn’t have. The following rights are some of the 
more important constitutional rights a defendant has in a criminal case:
 
• The right to have a jury decide guilt
 
• The right to confront witnesses and cross-examine them
 
• The right to have a lawyer represent the defendant
 
• The right to “remain silent” without that silence being used against 
the defendant in court (In other words, no one can force the defen­
dant to take the witness stand.)
 
• The right to have a speedy trial
 
• The right to be found guilty only by a standard of “beyond a rea­
sonable doubt”
Criminal versus civil law in the O. J. Simpson case
A memorable example of how criminal and civil 
laws work in the real world is the O. J. Simpson 
murder case. Simpson was tried in a crimi­
nal case for the murders of his ex-wife Nicole 
Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. When the 
jury found Simpson not guilty, the families of Ron 
Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson filed a civil 
suit against Simpson for causing the deaths. As a 
result of that civil suit, a jury found Simpson liable 
(not guilty) for causing the deaths of Ron Goldman 
and Nicole Brown Simpson. Because the verdict 
came from a civil suit, Simpson couldn’t be put in 
prison. Rather, the jury ordered him to pay over 
$30 million to the family of Ron Goldman and to 
Nicole Brown Simpson’s two children.
In the civil trial (unlike in the criminal trial), Ron 
Goldman’s family (the plaintiffs) forced Simpson 
to testify, and they didn’t have to prove “beyond 
a reasonable doubt” that Simpson committed 
the murders. Rather, the plaintiffs had to prove 
only that “more likely than not” (in other words, 
that there was at least a 51 percent chance) 
Simpson committed the murders.

27
 Chapter 2: What Is Crime?
Defining felonies and misdemeanors
	
To be considered criminal, an act has to carry the possibility of a jail sentence 
as punishment. Criminal laws are categorized according to the punishments 
they impose. Generally, a criminal law may be either a felony or a misde­
meanor. The difference between the two is as follows:
 
✓ A misdemeanor is a minor offense, and its maximum sentence usually 
can’t exceed one year. However, if someone is convicted of three mis­
demeanors, he can conceivably serve up to three years in jail. Petty lar­
ceny, such as shoplifting some cigarettes from a local convenience store, 
is usually a misdemeanor, and the punishment may be very light.
 
✓ A felony is the more serious offense, and someone who commits a felony 
can be punished with more than a year in jail or prison. Theft of an 
expensive item, such as a 52-inch plasma HDTV, can rise to the level of a 
felony and be subject to serious punishment.
	
You can look at your state’s criminal statutes to find out exactly which crimes 
your state considers misdemeanors and which ones it considers felonies. 
After all, an act that’s a misdemeanor in New York may be a felony in Alaska 
and vice versa.
I describe the main elements or requirements of a criminal law in the follow­
ing sections. If an act doesn’t include these elements (and doesn’t include the 
possibility of jail time as punishment), it probably isn’t considered a crime. 
(But there are always exceptions, which is why people have to hire lawyers.)
Requiring a physical act
	
A criminal law almost always requires a physical act. Simply thinking bad 
thoughts can’t be the basis for a violation of criminal law. Also, the act must 
be voluntary. In other words, the person committing the crime must have 
acted of his own free will. You can best understand this requirement by look­
ing at acts that the courts don’t deem voluntary, such as
 
✓ Reflexive motions, such as a sneeze that accidentally causes a person to 
discharge a gun
 
✓ Acts that occur during sleep, such as sleepwalking
 
✓ Acts that occur under the effects of hypnosis
 
✓ Acts committed under orders and at gunpoint
In most cases, the failure to act can’t constitute a crime. For example, refusing 
to jump into a river and save a drowning child doesn’t constitute homicide.

28
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
However, in some limited circumstances, when a legal duty to act is involved, 
the failure to act can constitute a crime. A great example is the legal duty of 
all citizens to pay their taxes. Failure to act — to write a check to the govern­
ment, for example — can result in a criminal prosecution. Similarly, parents 
have an obligation to care for their children. The failure to feed or care for 
kids may constitute the crime of child neglect.
Having a guilty mind
Along with requiring a physical act, a crime also requires a culpable mental 
state. This phrase is law-school talk that means the act wasn’t an accident 
and the offender had some moral responsibility. For example, a person can 
be considered morally culpable if he planned or intended to commit the 
criminal act. Aside from intent, however, most states recognize three other 
mental states, which I describe in the following list, that can result in criminal 
responsibility.
You can find detailed descriptions of these culpable mental states in the 
Model Penal Code, which the American Law Institute drafted in the 1960s as a 
model for states as they reformed their antiquated criminal laws. Many states 
adopted the Model Penal Code’s definitions of the four mental states required 
to prove criminal responsibility, which I paraphrase in the following list. In 
almost every criminal case, the jurors have to find that the defendant com­
mitted the crime in one of these four ways:
 
✓ Intentionally (or purposely): A person acts intentionally when he has 
the conscious objective of engaging in criminal conduct.
 
✓ Knowingly: A person acts knowingly when he’s aware that his conduct 
is of a certain nature that is an element of the crime. (For example, a 
thief acts knowingly when he steals a TV, knowing that it belongs to 
someone else.)
 
✓ Recklessly: A person acts recklessly when he consciously disregards a 
substantial and unjustifiable risk that a particular result will occur. The 
risk must be of such a nature and degree that disregard of the risk is a 
gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding citizen 
would observe.
 
✓ Negligently: A person acts negligently when he should be aware of a 
substantial and unjustifiable risk that a particular result will occur. The 
risk must be of such a nature and degree that his failure to perceive it is 
a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person 
would observe.
I list these mental states in order of responsibility, so a person who acts 
intentionally is usually held more accountable and, thus, punished more 
severely than a person who acts negligently.

29
 Chapter 2: What Is Crime?
Using homicide as an example (although this principle applies to many 
crimes), an intentional killing is murder and can result in a life sentence in 
prison or even a death sentence. A reckless killing may be considered murder 
in the second degree or manslaughter and results in a lesser sentence of 10 
to 20 years. A negligent killing, such as when a drunk driver kills his own pas­
senger in a crash, can result in five years or less in prison.
In rare circumstances, a jury can hold a person liable for a crime without 
proof of any of these culpable mental states, a situation called strict liability. A 
great example of strict liability has to do with the crime of driving under the 
influence of intoxicants. When it comes to driving under the influence, most 
states don’t require any proof that the offender acted intentionally, know­
ingly, recklessly, or negligently. The prosecutor just has to prove that the 
defendant drove while he was intoxicated. Although strict liability is some­
what common in civil law, it’s almost unheard of in criminal law, except for 
the crime of driving while intoxicated because society doesn’t want to lock 
people up unless they have some moral responsibility for what they did.
Linking Criminal Behavior 
to Cultural Mores
In a democratic society, in which laws are passed by elected representatives 
(or even directly by citizens through public votes called initiatives), criminal 
laws generally reflect the values of society. In this section, I explain the influ­
ence that society has on the development and implementation of criminal laws.
Understanding that crimes 
change over time
As society’s values change over time, the passage of new criminal laws and 
the repeal of old criminal laws reflect these changes. For example, until the 
early 1900s, you could legally possess and use both cocaine and marijuana 
in the United States. In 1914, Utah became the first state to criminalize mari­
juana. That same year, the federal government passed the Harrison Act, 
which treated cocaine like other illegal drugs, such as morphine and heroin.
Consider a more recent change: In 1994, the federal government began requiring 
that convicted sex offenders register their addresses with their state government 
after their release from prison. As a result, the failure to register constituted 
a crime. Thereafter, states began to enact laws requiring that the addresses 
of these sex offenders be made available to the public. These various state 
laws are known collectively as Megan’s Law, named after a 7-year-old girl who 

30
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
was raped and killed by a sex offender who lived across the street from her. 
Megan’s parents never even knew the sex offender was there.
	
Sometimes laws change not because of a legislature, but because of a court 
system. For example, in 1972, many states had laws that made performing 
an abortion a crime. But, in 1973, in the famous case of Roe v. Wade, the U.S. 
Supreme Court held that a woman has a constitutional right to an abortion. This 
ruling effectively repealed laws criminalizing the performance of an abortion.
Here’s another example of how the courts affect criminal law: In 2003, the U.S. 
Supreme Court in Lawrence v. Texas ruled that laws in Texas criminalizing 
sexual acts between persons of the same sex were unconstitutional, effec­
tively repealing those laws. Just 17 years earlier, in 1986, the Supreme Court 
had ruled in Bowers v. Hardwick that Georgia could have criminal laws pro­
hibiting sexual acts between members of the same sex. So, you can see how 
laws can change with the times.
Recognizing the impact of location
The Lawrence v. Texas and Bowers v. Hardwick cases demonstrate how differ­
ent cultural values across the United States manifest themselves in criminal 
laws. For instance, Texas and Georgia criminalized sodomy between consent­
ing males even though such conduct was legal in many other states. On this 
topic, at least, you can reasonably conclude that the cultural values of Texas 
and Georgia probably differ from those of Massachusetts or Vermont.
Each state has its own electoral process and its own court system, so each 
state may develop laws (including criminal laws) that reflect the will and 
values of its people.
Outside of the United States, criminal laws are even more diverse, which reflects 
the fact that dramatic cultural differences exist among different countries. For 
example, some Islamic countries, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, follow a code 
of laws based on their religion, known as sharia law. Based on this law, these 
countries allow the death penalty for homosexual acts in some circumstances. 
Also under sharia law, someone guilty of a crime such as theft may be punished 
by imprisonment and by amputation of hands — if the person has a very serious 
criminal history. Clearly, the cultures — as well as some of the laws — of these 
countries differ greatly from those of the United States.
In some provinces of Russia, where alcohol consumption has been a cul­
tural norm, driving under the influence of alcohol isn’t a crime unless the 
driver crashes and causes an injury. This leniency contrasts sharply with the 
United States, where the permissible blood alcohol content (BAC) for adults 
dropped from 0.10 percent in some states to 0.08 percent in all 50 states in 
2005. (In other words, driving with a BAC of more than 0.08 percent now con­
stitutes a crime in the United States.)

31
 Chapter 2: What Is Crime?
Realizing that politics play a role
Theoretically, laws in the United States reflect the will of the people, as car­
ried out by their elected representatives in the legislature. But the passage 
of laws doesn’t always play out so neatly. Criminologists fall into at least two 
different camps on the issue of what influences the passage of laws in the 
United States:
 
✓ One group believes that, generally speaking, criminal laws reflect a con­
sensus of the values of the citizens.
 
✓ Another group contends that the legislative process isn’t so clean and 
that the passage of criminal laws actually reflects conflicts between dif­
ferent interest groups.
Criminologists in the second group point to the scarcity of laws regulating 
large businesses or the wealthy because those interest groups wield a lot 
of political power. These criminologists see conflict, rather than consensus, 
as the method by which criminal laws are passed. They argue that the more 
powerful and wealthy a group of people is, the less likely that group is to be 
regulated.
How various states define theft
To show the diversity of laws among the 50 U.S. 
states, I present three states’ efforts to define 
the crime of theft:
California Penal Code Section 484 — Theft
Every person who shall feloniously steal, take, 
carry, lead, or drive away the personal property 
of another, or who shall fraudulently appropri­
ate property which has been entrusted to him or 
her, or who shall knowingly and designedly, by 
any false or fraudulent representation or pre­
tense, defraud any other person of money, labor 
or real or personal property, or who causes or 
procures others to report falsely of his or her 
wealth or mercantile character and by thus 
imposing upon any person, obtains credit and 
thereby fraudulently gets or obtains possession 
of money or property or obtains the labor or ser­
vice of another, is guilty of theft.
New York Penal Law Section 155.05 — 
Larceny
A person steals property and commits larceny 
when, with intent to deprive another of prop­
erty or to appropriate the same to himself or 
to a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains 
or withholds such property from an owner 
thereof.
Louisiana Code Title 14 Section 67 — Theft
Theft is the misappropriation or taking of any­
thing of value which belongs to another, either 
without the consent of the other to the misap­
propriation or taking, or by means of fraudulent 
conduct, practices, or representations. An 
intent to deprive the other permanently of what­
ever may be the subject of the misappropriation 
or taking is essential.

Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
Having witnessed the passage of criminal laws firsthand, I argue that both 
views are partially right. With mala in se crimes — the crimes that most of 
us agree are evil (such as murder and rape) — the political process usually 
reflects the will of the people. However, in terms of malum in prohibitum acts 
(the ones that aren’t necessarily evil but do need to be regulated), powerful 
and wealthy interest groups can sometimes sway legislators who are debat­
ing those acts.
Consider gun-control laws as an example: The National Rifle Association 
(NRA) devotes a good deal of time and money to influencing these laws. 
Depending on your personal views, you may see this fact as either good or 
bad. If you’re an NRA member, you may argue that the organization tries to 
ensure that individuals maintain their Second Amendment rights to own 
guns, hunt, and protect personal property. If you’re not an NRA member, you 
may consider the NRA an aggressive political advocacy group that prevents 
the reasonable regulation of firearms.
Almost every industry commits significant resources to protecting its corpo­
rate interests by lobbying (or influencing) legislators. And lobbying can some­
times mean trying to prevent the passage of criminal laws that may punish 
industry misconduct.
Nonetheless, U.S. society is far more regulated through criminal laws today 
than it was just 50 years ago. In a society that continues to grow more and 
more complex, new laws are often necessary to protect food and drug 
sources, the environment, civil rights, and personal safety.

ocumenting how much crime occurs in the United States and calculat­
ing its impact on society is an incredibly difficult — some would say 
impossible — task. Yet, understanding how crime statistics are gathered and 
how reliable those statistics are is essential because politicians and other 
policymakers rely heavily on crime stats to make decisions that impact the 
rest of society.
Should money be diverted from social services to build more prisons? Should 
inmates be released early from prison to free up money to solve a state 
budget crisis? Should schools develop Internet safety programs to protect 
kids from sexual predators? Crime stats, even imperfect ones, help people 
answer tough questions like these.
People who rely on statistics without really understanding them can make 
serious policy mistakes that waste money and may even risk lives. Reading 
this chapter is a great first step toward truly understanding where crime stats 
come from and what their flaws may be.
Gathering Crime Stats: How 
Much Crime Is There?
Knowing about every crime that occurs is impossible because many crimes 
go unreported. For example, a typical cocaine sale involves two willing par­
ties, and neither party is likely to share news of the exchange with the police.

34
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
Even with a violent crime, the victim doesn’t always report it. For example, 
rival gang members involved in a fight aren’t likely to call the police, and vic­
tims of domestic violence often don’t report their abuse. (See Chapter 5 for 
more info about why domestic violence victims often keep quiet.) Similarly, 
rape victims may not want to endure the emotional trauma of making a 
report to police.
Fraud and property crimes present other challenges. For instance, you prob­
ably don’t call the police every time you receive a fraudulent e-mail that asks 
you to cash a large check for a “Nigerian official.” (See Chapter 6 for a discus­
sion of the infamous Nigerian scams.) And you may not even call the police 
when someone steals your wallet or purse. After all, many people believe that, 
at least for property crimes, filing a police report simply doesn’t do any good.
Even though many crimes don’t get reported to the police, crime reports are 
still one of the most important sources for gathering crime stats.
Relying on crime reports
More than 17,000 police agencies operate in the United States, and about 
93 percent of those agencies participate in a voluntary program that reports 
statistics to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The compiled statistics are 
published annually in the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). You can access the most 
recent UCR report at the FBI’s Web site: http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm.
The UCR contains information about only certain types of serious crimes, 
known as Part 1 crimes:
 
✓ Murder
 
✓ Manslaughter
 
✓ Forcible rape
 
✓ Robbery
 
✓ Aggravated assault
 
✓ Burglary
 
✓ Larceny-theft
 
✓ Motor vehicle theft
 
✓ Arson
Because Part I crimes are so serious in nature, experts believe that they’re 
reported more reliably than less-serious crimes. The UCR purposely excludes 

35
 Chapter 3: How Crime Is Measured and Why It Matters
crimes that people aren’t likely to report, such as drug offenses or embezzle­
ment, as well as crimes that occur infrequently, such as kidnapping.
	
But even for crimes that you think a victim would report, the actual report 
rate is quite low. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, fewer than 
half of violent crimes and property crimes are ever reported to police (see 
Figure 3-1).

Besides not receiving reports for every crime, another significant problem 
with the UCR is that a police agency must pick only the most serious crime 
from a criminal incident to report to the FBI. In other words, the police can’t 
report multiple crimes that occurred during a single incident. So, if a man 
steals a car and then later sets the car ablaze to conceal his first crime, the 
investigating police agency reports only the arson, not the motor vehicle theft.
	
But, despite its problems, the UCR provides a solid, nationwide picture of long-
term crime trends and allows for year-to-year comparisons among each of the 
Part 1 crimes because its problems are generally consistent from year to year.
The following list compares the overall violent crime rates over the past 
two decades (provided by the UCR). The numbers reflect how many violent 
crimes occurred per 100,000 people in the United States.
1988: 641
1989: 667
1990: 730
1991: 758
1992: 758
1993: 747

36
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
Figure 3-2 illustrates the overall reduction in violent crime since 1991.
Keep in mind that an effort to improve the UCR is in the works and has 
been partially implemented. This effort, called the National Incident-Based 
Reporting System (NIBRS), is designed to more efficiently and accurately 
gather more information on more crimes from police agencies’ computer­
ized record management systems. An improved reporting system like the 
NIBRS can resolve some of the problems with the UCR; however, building 
the necessary electronic systems costs money for police departments. As a 
result, progress has been slow, and NIBRS is still far from reaching its even­
tual potential. For more information on NIBRS, you can check out the U.S. 
Department of Justice’s Web site: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/
nibrs.htm.
Tallying the number of arrests
In addition to the number of crime reports, the UCR also collects information 
on the number of arrests. For these statistics, the UCR looks at not only the 
Part 1 crimes I mention in the preceding section, but also 21 other crimes, 
including simple assault and driving under the influence of intoxicants.
	
Obviously, arrest statistics don’t give a full picture of crime. (Arrest doesn’t 
necessarily mean guilt, and no nationwide statistics show the percentage of 
arrested persons who are found guilty in state court.) Even so, arrest statistics 
do help evaluate police effectiveness by showing clearance rates — the per­
centage of reported crimes that end in arrests. Obviously, the higher the clear­
ance rate, the more effective the police are at catching the bad guys.
Table 3-1 shows the 2007 national clearance rates for various crimes.

You can see that police are much more likely to solve violent crimes than they 
are to solve property crimes, which is largely a result of the greater resources 
that police commit to solving violent crimes. Another important factor that 
leads to the increased clearance rate for violent crime is the fact that violent 
crimes often leave eyewitnesses who can help identify the perpetrators. In 
contrast, property crimes often happen in the absence of witnesses.
Arrest statistics provide another tool for evaluating crime rates: Tracking the 
number of arrests helps track certain crime trends for crimes that people 
usually don’t report, such as driving under the influence of intoxicants. Yet, 
tracking the number of arrests has its shortcomings. For instance, a decrease 
in the number of arrests for a certain crime may have several explanations, 
including the following:
 
✓ Fewer people are committing the crime.
 
✓ Police are putting fewer resources into investigating the crime.
 
✓ Criminals have figured out ways to commit the crime without being caught.
	
A decrease in a certain crime can have some other explanations, too, so you 
can’t draw many conclusions from these arrest statistics alone. For example, 
from 2003 to 2007, arrest statistics for the crime of fraud decreased by more 
than 19 percent. I highly doubt that the incidences of fraud actually decreased 
that much in those four years. More likely, fraudsters have moved to the 
Internet, where investigation and arrest are much more difficult. (See Chapter 
6 for a discussion of Internet fraud.)

39
 Chapter 3: How Crime Is Measured and Why It Matters
Spotlighting unreported crime: 
Victimization surveys
How do researchers get around the problem that so many crimes go unre­
ported? The best answer is the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). 
Each year, the U.S. Bureau of the Census, in cooperation with the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics (a part of the U.S. Department of Justice), conducts a survey 
of 76,000 households and asks people 12 and older questions about crimes 
they experienced in the previous year. Based on this sampling, the Bureau 
of Justice Statistics then estimates rates for a variety of crimes. (The survey 
excludes uncommon crimes, such as kidnapping, because the sampling isn’t 
large enough.) The questionnaire is quite detailed with about 27 pages of 
questions. To see the 2006 version of the survey, you can visit the following 
Web site: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/ncvs104.pdf.
	
As expected, the NCVS shows that many crimes aren’t reported to the police. 
For example, the number of rapes reported to census workers for the NCVS 
is more than twice the number of rapes reported to police. (Women often 
don’t report rape for a variety of reasons, such as shame, embarrassment, 
fear of a process that can seem degrading, and a concern that the report 
won’t do any good. See Chapter 5 for more information about violent crimes, 
including rape.)
Like the other forms of measuring crime, victimization surveys have their 
shortcomings, too. Primarily, they’re very expensive. Because of their high 
cost, the NCVS sampling of 76,000 households is just not large enough to 
draw meaningful conclusions at the state and local levels. For instance, a 
criminologist in Pueblo, New Mexico, can’t draw any conclusions about rape 
trends in his home state or town from this national survey. Thus, the NCVS 
data isn’t very helpful in planning to provide resources to local domestic vio­
lence and rape shelters.
Separate from the NCVS, local and state governments, nonprofit agencies, 
and universities sometimes conduct their own localized surveys. Such sur­
veys aren’t just limited to victims, however. Researchers rely heavily on sur­
veys of youth alcohol and drug use to identify new and dangerous trends, for 
example. Since about 2006, local surveys have helped researchers identify an 
emerging trend among kids for using and abusing prescription drugs.
Accepting the shortcomings 
of crime statistics
As I explained previously, none of the three primary methods of gathering crime 
stats — crime reports, number of arrests, or victimization surveys — is perfect.

40
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
	
But despite the shortcomings of each approach, together (and combined 
with other observations) they provide a decent picture of crime in the United 
States, in general. And, in the future, if more police agencies move to the 
National Incident-Based Reporting System (which I describe in the “Relying on 
crime reports” section), this system will automatically take statistical reports 
from police agencies’ computer systems — as a result, crime report stats will 
become even more valuable.
Putting Crime Stats to Use
Analyzing crime stats isn’t just an intellectual exercise. Criminologists don’t 
stand around sipping glasses of Chateau Margaux with their pinky fingers 
extended, saying (in their best British accents), “Reginald, tell us your theory 
about why child homicides have risen.” Analyzing crime stats is too impor­
tant to be a parlor game.
Rather, U.S. citizens ask — and deserve informed answers to — questions 
such as how can we do a better job protecting ourselves and our neighbors, 
how can we improve services for victims, and how can we prevent kids from 
choosing a life of crime? Crime stats help law enforcement agencies deal with 
these questions by helping them correct mistaken approaches and point the 
way to improvement.
The U.S. Congress, along with every state legislature, faces the challenge of 
not having enough resources to fight crime. As a result, congressmen and 
congresswomen must look for information to help them decide how best to 
spend tax dollars — often they turn to statistics for help. If statistics show 
that a particular program is successful, a legislature is more likely to fund 
that program in the future. Conversely, a lack of evidence to support a par­
ticular program’s success more or less dooms it to termination.
	
Unfortunately, policymakers often use statistics without sufficiently under­
standing their limitations. Like guns, statistics in the hands of untrained 
users can be dangerous. All too frequently, statistics can be subject to 
enough differing interpretations that they end up being of little value. I’ve 
seen policymakers spend more time arguing over the value of a set of statis­
tics than the actual merits of the program they’re trying to justify.
The wisest course for policymakers to follow is to take advantage of all 
relevant sources of information, including crime stats, arrest stats, and sur­
veys. I recently attended a meeting to discuss drug trends in my home state. 
Although some people wanted to rely just on arrest stats, the group eventu­
ally agreed to gather information from each of the following sources:

41
 Chapter 3: How Crime Is Measured and Why It Matters
 
✓ Arrest stats
 
✓ A youth drug and alcohol survey
 
✓ Amounts of drugs seized by police drug task forces
 
✓ Studies of drug residue amounts in a city’s sewage system (which is an 
increasingly valuable tool for measuring drug use)
 
✓ A survey of drug cops
Through careful analysis of the information from these five sources, policymak­
ers may be able to establish an accurate picture of illegal drug use. However, 
this approach takes a lot more work than just relying on arrest stats.
Considering the Costs of Crime
In the United States, the government devotes billions of dollars to public safety. 
From arrest to prosecution to jail to probation, the costs mount up fast. But 
crime has other costs, as well, including a plethora of economic costs, insur­
ance costs, and, of course, the personal losses that millions of crime victims 
and their families face. Knowing how much crime occurs and how much it 
costs can help policymakers make smarter decisions in fighting crime.
Controversy over crime reduction
One of the larger criminology controversies 
arose in the late 1990s. Crime rates through the 
1970s and 1980s had risen to all-time highs, but 
in the late 1990s, as states began to implement 
much tougher sentencing laws, crime rates 
began to plunge. As Figure 3-2 shows, violent 
crime began to decrease dramatically in 1992 
and was almost cut in half by 2003.
Proponents of tougher sentencing laws pointed 
out the dramatic coincidence of crime dropping 
at the same time that sentences were lengthen­
ing. But others saw different potential causes. 
For example, Steven Levitt and John Donohue 
concluded that the drop in crime that began in 
the mid-1990s was, to a large extent, the result 
of the legalization of abortion, which occurred in 
1973. Their theory was that unwanted children 
from unplanned pregnancies, who are more 
likely than children of planned pregnancies to 
be involved in crime when they become adults, 
were aborted and, thus, never lived to commit 
crimes. A potential criminal who was aborted in 
1973 would’ve become an adult in 1991 if she’d 
lived. Other criminologists have challenged the 
methodology of Levitt and Donohue’s analysis, 
questioning the assumption that unwanted chil­
dren are more likely to commit violent crime.
This controversy shows that, with the inherent 
weaknesses in the ways criminologists cur­
rently gather statistics, the value of crime sta­
tistics in helping guide policy choices continues 
to be somewhat limited.

42
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
Funding the justice system
The most obvious costs of crime are the ones incurred through the govern­
ment’s efforts to control it. And, of course, the largest cost of these efforts 
comes from compensating the law enforcement personnel who fight crime 
and incarcerate criminals. As I explain in Chapter 19 in more detail, the 
number of people necessary to resolve one criminal case is astonishing. Here 
are just some of the steps — and the people — involved:
	
1.	 Police officers make an arrest.
	
2.	 A jail staff member books the suspect (in other words, he fingerprints 
and documents who the suspect is).
	
3.	 Another jail staff member moves the suspect into jail.
	
4.	 A police officer writes a report of the crime and sends it to the district 
attorney.
	
5.	 The district attorney decides whether to file charges against the 
suspect.
	
6.	 A secretary drafts an indictment, which is the charging document that 
lists the crimes.
	
7.	 A grand jury decides whether to indict the suspect.
	
8.	 The district attorney files an indictment with court staff.
	
9.	 Jail staff bring the defendant to a judge for arraignment (an initial 
appearance where the defendant is informed of the charges).
	
10.	 The judge appoints a defense attorney.
	
11.	 If the defendant wants a trial, the case is given to another judge.
	
12.	 The district attorney and the defense attorney select a jury.
	
13.	 The judge conducts the trial.
	
14.	 The defense attorney and district attorney bring their witnesses to 
court.
	
15.	 If the jury convicts the defendant, the defendant may go to jail or prison.
	
16.	 Corrections officers transport the defendant to jail or prison, move the 
defendant into a cell, and provide ongoing security.
	
17.	 A probation officer later oversees the defendant’s release from jail or 
prison.

43
 Chapter 3: How Crime Is Measured and Why It Matters
Generally, you can break the functions that I describe in the preceding list 
into three categories:
 
✓ Police (including detectives, patrol officers, and other police staff)
 
✓ Judicial (including district attorneys and defense attorneys)
 
✓ Corrections (including jail, prison, and probation personnel)
Figure 3-3 shows an estimate of criminal justice costs in the United States, 
broken down by these three categories (using data from the U.S. Bureau of 
Justice Statistics).

This figure shows a clear trend upward, even as the overall rate of violent 
crime in the United States has decreased significantly since the early 1990s.
	
Keep in mind that each of the three primary units of government — local, 
state, and federal — has separate criminal justice responsibilities. A local gov­
ernment, such as a city or county, has a police force, a court system, and a jail. 
A state government may also have its own police, courts, and prison system. 
And, of course, the feds have their own completely separate system of crimi­
nal justice. Figure 3-4 shows how costs are spread among these three levels of 
government.

As you can see, state and local governments bear the lion’s share of the costs 
of fighting crime.
Measuring the costs to society and victims
In addition to the direct costs of administering a criminal justice system, you 
have to keep in mind numerous other, less obvious costs. Quantifying these 
costs is an ongoing challenge for economists and criminologists alike.
For example, the cost of preventing crime throughout society can be quite 
large. Many retail stores have loss-prevention units. Many businesses and 
homes have security cameras and systems, and some also employ private 
security patrols. Some economists even include costs such as security 
lighting and locks in their estimates of how much crime costs society. They 
reason that these costs are ones that a crime-free society wouldn’t have to 
pay. And, of course, in addition to physical security, every business must 
have high-quality computer security to protect against Internet hackers and 
criminals.
After a crime occurs, all kinds of additional costs come into play. For exam­
ple, a woman who had $100 stolen is obviously out $100. (Some economists 
argue that this loss isn’t a net loss to society because it’s just a transfer of 
wealth from a victim to a criminal.) But the woman may also lose wages or 
vacation time if she calls the police and ultimately has to go to court.

45
 Chapter 3: How Crime Is Measured and Why It Matters
Property crimes (such as vandalism) and drug manufacturing can dramati­
cally impact the value of a home or even a neighborhood. During the meth­
amphetamine manufacturing epidemic in recent years, meth labs sprang 
up seemingly everywhere in the West and Midwest. The chemical residue 
from a meth lab is so toxic that any house with a lab has to be completely 
scrubbed — the cleanup costs alone can sometimes reach up to $100,000.
Assessing the costs of violent crimes can be even more complex. A victim 
of a violent crime may incur costs for medical treatment and mental health 
counseling. Often victims themselves don’t bear the full cost of medical 
treatment; taxpayers, insurance companies, or hospitals pick up a significant 
portion.
	
A study by Philip Cook, Ted Miller, and Bruce Lawrence examined the medical 
cost of the 138,000 gun-shot injuries that occurred in the United States in 1994. 
The medical cost was more than $2.3 billion (or about $17,000 per injury), and 
the taxpayer picked up 49 percent of that cost. The U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention estimated that the 2003 medical and mental health 
costs stemming only from domestic violence crimes totaled $4.1 billion.
A victim’s emotional trauma may be so extensive that it impacts his ability 
to earn a wage, resulting in a lower-paying job. Economists conclude that 
the emotional damage from rape and sexual assaults has the greatest eco­
nomic impact of any crime (next to murder, of course). Another part of the 
economic impact of crime is the reduction in the quality of life that a victim 
endures from the injury itself. Some economists have used “pain and suffer­
ing” judgments from civil lawsuits to estimate the financial impact of a similar 
injury on the victim of a crime.
Economists may also consider the productivity loss to society when a person 
becomes a criminal rather than a positive, contributing member of society. 
The failure of a criminal to earn a wage and pay taxes is a net loss to society. 
Drug crime helps demonstrate this fact. After all, a drug dealer doesn’t pay 
taxes, and he sells a product that makes other people less productive in their 
legitimate jobs. Drugs also lead to social welfare costs because drug abusers 
often can’t care for their children or themselves and usually require several 
rounds of drug abuse treatment.
When you combine all these factors, you see how complex the cost analysis 
is, and you see how far-reaching and expensive the impact of crime is. At the 
high end, one study concluded that the annual economic cost of crime in 
the United States exceeds $1.5 trillion. A 1996 study placed the annual cost 
at a more conservative $450 billion, or $1,800 for every person in the United 
States (in 1996 dollars).

entire U.S. court system was originally set up to protect a defendant’s rights, 
historically, victims have received no institutionalized assistance at all. 
They’ve been left to fend for themselves, sometimes with no way to pay medi­
cal bills or even to get someone to explain how the justice system works. 
But thanks to some forward-thinking folks in the 1970s and 1980s, a victims’ 
rights movement has swept across the United States. Today, victims are front 
and center in the minds of politicians and policymakers.
In this chapter, I discuss the historical treatment of victims in the criminal 
justice system. I discuss victimization, starting with the different types of 
harm that a victim can suffer. I also help you get a better idea of who is more 
likely to become a victim of crime. Then I address how far U.S. society has 
come and describe the types of services that are available to victims today.
Looking at the Historical 
Treatment of Victims
Prior to the 1970s, if you were the victim of a crime, you were essentially just 
another witness for the government. Sure, people were sympathetic to you, 
but sympathy only goes so far. No one helped you get medical care, let alone 
reimbursed you for that medical care. A victim of domestic violence didn’t 

48
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
have a shelter she could take her family to. A rape victim had no one to pro­
vide counseling services. No one explained how the criminal justice system 
worked or provided any of the myriad of victim services that exist today.
In the 1970s, this situation slowly started to change as individual communi­
ties began to take action. District attorney offices in Philadelphia, Brooklyn, 
and Milwaukee got the ball rolling with some rudimentary victim assistance 
programs. Soon thereafter, private advocacy groups sprang up to advocate 
for victims in Congress and in state legislatures. For example, Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving (MADD) formed in 1980 to advocate against drunk 
driving and to support its victims.
	
In 1982, President Ronald Reagan commissioned a task force to look at victims’ 
rights. The task force came up with 68 recommendations for how to provide 
better service to victims of crime. The next year, Reagan created the Office 
for Victims of Crime within the U.S. Department of Justice to implement these 
recommendations. And in 1984, Congress passed the Victims of Crime Act 
(VOCA), which called for the money from fines and assessments levied against 
federally convicted criminals to be used to provide services to victims of 
crime all across the country. Together, these actions became the springboard 
for dramatic improvements in how society and the court system treat victims 
of crime. Today, society goes to much greater efforts — both inside and outside 
the courtroom — to help victims deal with the many painful effects of crime.
Identifying the Impact 
of Crime on Victims
Being the victim of a crime can leave painful, permanent scars. These scars 
can be physical, emotional, and financial.
Physical scars
According to the National Crime Victimization Survey (a survey administered 
annually by the Bureau of Justice Statistics as a way to measure crime), approxi­
mately 6.3 million violent crimes occurred in the United States in 2005. That’s 
21 victims for every 1,000 citizens over the age of 12, which makes for a lot 
of crime victims suffering physical injury. (For more on the National Crime 
Victimization Survey, check out Chapter 3.)
Many of the injuries resulting from crime — which range from bruises to 
death — require medical care. The physical pain can last for months, years, 
or even a lifetime. For example, you’ve no doubt seen news reports of gang 
members or armed robbers firing their weapons at particular people (like 
rival gang members) and hitting innocent bystanders. Such victims may 

49
 Chapter 4: Helping Those in the Wake of Crime: Victims
suffer life-long debilitating injuries. But sometimes physical injuries are just a 
small part of the total story.
Emotional effects
Crime creates ongoing fear in people who are victimized. Out of fear, victims 
often alter their lifestyles dramatically, and a life lived in fear isn’t a full life. 
Imagine a rape victim who becomes so afraid of another attack that she won’t 
leave her home at night or go anywhere without a companion.
Beyond fear, victims may suffer very serious psychological effects, including 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Someone suffering from PTSD may 
endure bouts of depression, severe anxiety, and difficulty with relationships.
Kids and spouses who are victimized by people they love are particularly 
susceptible to this psychological pain, often because of their dependence on 
the abuser. The psychological effects of abuse over a long period of time can 
sometimes exceed those of a one-time assault by a stranger.
In addition to the fear and psychological pain that many victims of violence 
feel, I must also mention the grief that victims’ family members endure as 
their loved ones suffer serious injury or death. I personally have shed tears 
with families of murder victims who miss their loved ones and struggle to 
make sense of the tragedies. They face a torrent of emotions from anger to 
despondency, and sometimes there’s no way to console them.
	
Another mental stressor comes from entering the criminal justice system as a 
victim. The vast governmental bureaucracy can seem cold and impersonal to 
someone who has already suffered a great deal. Take a rape victim, for exam­
ple. Police may ask her to submit to a rape exam to look for DNA evidence, 
including semen, blood, and pubic hair. They may also ask her to describe the 
assault in detail. The defense attorney may even assert a defense of consent in 
which he argues that she was a willing participant in sex and not the victim of 
a violent crime.
Although I’ve known some exceptional victim advocates, they can only do 
so much to help a victim deal with the lengthy, harsh reality of the criminal 
justice system (see the “Support of victim advocates” section later in this 
chapter for more info). Some of the greatest acts of courage I’ve seen have 
come from crime victims who were willing to endure the long process so that 
others wouldn’t be victimized like they were.
Economic loss
In the United States, the cost of crime tops $450 billion annually, which comes 
out to be about $1,800 per citizen. Some criminologists refer to this cost as a 

50
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
“crime tax” because of its negative effect on the economy. This $450 billion 
figure includes lost wages and productivity, property loss, medical bills, an 
estimate of the cost of pain and suffering, and long-term disability costs.
If the cost of crime in the aggregate is too overwhelming, consider the cost 
to an individual such as a victim in a convenience store robbery who takes a 
bullet in the chest. He may not have health insurance to cover the hundreds 
of thousands of dollars in medical bills. He probably doesn’t have disability 
insurance to keep providing an income while he’s in the hospital, either. If his 
wife has a job, she may have to take time off to care for him, which means 
they’ll lose some, if not all, of her income, too. Thanks to crime, a family can 
quickly suffer economic disaster through no fault of their own.
Pinpointing Who Is Likely 
to Be Victimized
Not surprisingly, who you are, where you live, and what kinds of activities 
you engage in play a huge part in whether you’re likely to become a crime 
victim. For instance, the following personal characteristics have been linked 
to victimization in some way or another:
 
✓ Age: Your age is a significant factor primarily because so many crimes 
are committed by young men (see Chapter 11 for more on the link 
between age and criminality). Thus, people who hang out in the same 
places that young men do are much more likely to be victimized. 
Someone between the ages of 20 and 24 is more than four times as likely 
to be the victim of a violent crime as a person between the ages of 50 
and 64. Generally speaking, the older you get, the safer you are.
	
	However, as people become elderly, they do become more susceptible 
to property crimes, such as fraud and theft. Scam artists throughout 
the world focus their energy on identifying older folks whom they can 
easily confuse and defraud. (For a more detailed discussion of property 
crimes, turn to Chapter 6.)
 
✓ Race: Here are some facts about the link between race and victimization:
 
• For all crimes, African Americans are more likely to be victimized 
than whites.
 
• Native Americans are far more likely than anyone else to experi­
ence violence.
 
• In terms of property crimes, Hispanics are the most likely to be 
victimized.
 
• Asians are the least likely to be victimized.

51
 Chapter 4: Helping Those in the Wake of Crime: Victims
	
	Most criminologists agree that these stats reflect a number of compli­
cated factors. For example, each community where certain racial or ethnic 
groups are more likely to live has its own characteristics. And each racial 
and ethnic group experiences its own cultural trends regarding two-parent 
homes, income disparities, identification with gangs, and so on.
	
	In Chapter 13, I discuss societal factors that can lead to greater crime.
 
✓ Gender: Although the crime victim movement often emphasizes crimes 
that mostly affect women, such as rape and domestic violence, the truth 
is that except for sex crimes, men are much more likely to become crime 
victims than women. Also, men are more likely to be victimized by strang­
ers, while women are more likely to be victimized by people they know.
 
✓ Income: As you may expect, the lower your household income, the 
greater your chances of being the victim of a crime. Again, this link 
between income and victimization is likely a reflection of the community 
you live in. As I discuss in Chapter 13, the poorer the neighborhood, the 
higher the crime rate generally is.
 
✓ Lifestyle choices: Perhaps even more than your age, skin color, gender, 
or income, the way you live your life impacts your vulnerability to crime. 
Hanging out with street gangs, drug dealers, or even heavy-drinking 
sorority sisters creates a greater risk of victimization.
Expanding Victim Services 
in the 21st Century
Today most communities provide a variety of services to victims of crime, 
including some or all of the ones I discuss in this section. Note that although 
far more people are victims of property crime than violent crime, the major­
ity of crime victim services are set up primarily to provide help to the victims 
of violent crime.
Crime victim compensation
After a convenience store clerk is shot during a robbery, how does he pay his 
medical bills? Today every state has a crime victim compensation program that 
helps victims pay their bills and cope with the aftermath of the crime. Typically, 
victim compensation programs are payers of last resort, meaning that a victim 
must exhaust his own personal health insurance first. Here are just a few of the 
expenses victim compensation programs can reimburse victims for:
 
✓ Medical care
 
✓ Lost wages

52
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
 
✓ Grief counseling
 
✓ Funeral expenses
 
✓ Injury rehabilitation
 
✓ Counseling for kids who witness crime
To be eligible for compensation, a person must be an innocent victim, mean­
ing that he didn’t contribute to the criminal activity in any way. Also, he must 
fully cooperate with law enforcement. Victim service providers employ com-
pensation officers to make sure victims’ claims are valid. (You may not be sur­
prised to learn that people try to defraud the victim compensation system — 
which is about as low as stealing from an offering plate.)
Because the amount of funds in these programs is limited, so, too, is the 
amount of compensation a victim can get. Typically, reimbursement for medi­
cal costs is limited to $20,000 or $25,000. Reimbursement for counseling ser­
vices, funeral costs, and rehabilitation is also limited.
Money to support compensation programs comes from a variety of sources. 
One of those sources is the criminals themselves — federal and state govern­
ments collect fines and fees from all criminal defendants when they’re found 
guilty. In addition, if a defendant causes a victim’s injury and that injury 
receives some compensation from the state’s victim compensation program, 
the judge can make the defendant pay back the costs to the program.
For example, when the robber who shoots the convenience store clerk is 
found guilty, the judge can order him to repay the compensation program 
for any money forwarded to the clerk for his medical costs. In addition, the 
clerk has the legal right to file a civil lawsuit against the robber for the full 
amount of his medical costs and for all his pain and suffering. As a practical 
matter, however, most robbers don’t have any money to pay large judgments; 
plus, they usually end up in prison for awhile, where they don’t earn enough 
to repay the costs. Nonetheless, some states employ collection officers to go 
after criminals and collect these funds if they’re available.
Support of victim advocates
In the immediate aftermath of a violent crime, a victim may be traumatized and 
unable to make even the most basic decisions. To provide help to victims of vio­
lence, many police departments employ victim advocates, who offer the victims 
the support and resources they need to take the first steps of their recoveries.
Imagine a woman who was beaten up by her boyfriend. After the police haul 
him away, what will she do about her injury? Who will take care of her kids 
while she’s in the hospital? What if her boyfriend gets out of jail because of 

53
 Chapter 4: Helping Those in the Wake of Crime: Victims
overcrowding (a common occurrence) and comes back? An advocate can 
help the abused woman answer these tough questions. For example, the 
advocate may help her think of family members who can take care of her 
children. Or the advocate may recommend a domestic violence shelter where 
she and her children can live temporarily to protect themselves against the 
abuser in case he comes back home.
If a police department doesn’t employ advocates, often police officers are in 
the position of trying to help victims cope with these challenges. The depart­
ment may also call on trained volunteers.
Prosecutor offices usually employ victim advocates, as well. Like advocates 
in police departments, these advocates may help victims get emergency ser­
vices. In addition, they help explain the court process to victims, often sitting 
with them through hearings. After all, sitting in a courtroom with the man 
who raped you can be very intimidating. Having an advocate hold your hand 
can make a big difference. Another important service an advocate in the prose­
cutor’s office provides is explaining to the victim what rights she has. (I discuss 
these rights in the “Observing the Laws That Protect Victims’ Rights” section.)
Another type of victim advocate helps victims after the court case is done. 
For instance, this person may notify the victim when the criminal is set to be 
released from jail or prison. Some states have a statewide automated victim 
notification system that allows a victim to call a phone number and find out 
if and when a criminal is scheduled to be released. Victims, however, often 
don’t know about this system or don’t know how to use it, so advocates help 
them. Advocates also may help victims deal with unwanted contact from 
criminals while they’re on probation or parole.
Because each state is different, all these services may be performed by a vari­
ety of people in different agencies, or perhaps by just one overworked person 
in a small police department. These government advocate positions often 
rely heavily on private organizations and volunteers for the bulk of services.
Direct help from private, nonprofit groups
Although government-run victim programs are the conduit for providing 
services to victims, nonprofit organizations provide the day-in and day-out 
crucial help that victims need.
For instance, private organizations almost always run the domestic violence 
shelters that government-employed victim advocates send abused woman to. 
These private, nonprofit organizations are made up of citizens who care pas­
sionately about victims of crime. They fund their efforts with private dona­
tions, public and private grants, and contracts with the government.

54
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
	
Without these private services, a victim advocate often would have nowhere 
to refer a victim. Note, however, that nonprofit care providers (and govern­
ment-run victim assistance offices) have little money and rely heavily on vol­
unteers to provide services such as the following:
 
✓ Answering phone hotlines (such as rape, domestic violence, or suicide 
lines)
 
✓ Providing crisis response — immediate, in-the-field care to victims
 
✓ Helping with victim compensation
 
✓ Accompanying a victim to court
 
✓ Accompanying police or other officials when notifying a family member 
of a death
 
✓ Helping to run the service provider’s office
 
✓ Securing address confidentiality for the victim to make sure a criminal 
doesn’t learn the victim’s new address
Observing the Laws That 
Protect Victims’ Rights
All the victim services I discuss in the previous section are offered, for the 
most part, outside of the court system. In recent years, however, a movement 
has developed to help ensure that a victim’s interests are considered inside 
the courtroom, too. Every state has passed laws that create victims’ rights, 
and 29 states have even made such laws part of their state constitutions.
Invoking victims’ rights
The victims’ rights movement that has recently swept across the United 
States seeks to give the victim a voice in the criminal justice process. For 
instance, most states have enacted laws that require the court system or the 
prosecutor to notify victims of all release hearings related to their attackers 
and to give the victims the right to be heard at those hearings.
Imagine that your ex-boyfriend (or ex-girlfriend) has been stalking you and 
recently set your car on fire. He was arrested, but what happens next? Will he 
get out? Will he come back to hurt you? Thanks to the victims’ rights move­
ment, if your ex-boyfriend requests a release hearing, you have the right not 
only to be present but also to tell the judge why your ex shouldn’t be released.

55
 Chapter 4: Helping Those in the Wake of Crime: Victims
Here are some of the victims’ rights that most states have enacted:
 
✓ Notification of all hearings: A victim has the right to know what’s going 
on at every step of a case she’s involved in. This notification applies to 
appeal hearings, too.
 
✓ Opportunity to speak at a release hearing: If the victim wants to com­
ment, the judge must listen to the victim’s concerns before deciding 
whether to release a defendant pretrial. Victims can speak in person or 
just write out a statement and give it to the prosecutor to read to the 
court.
 
✓ Option to obtain a “no contact” order: If the victim wants the defen­
dant to stay away from her, the judge has the power to issue a “no con­
tact” order, which prohibits the defendant from contacting the victim. 
Violation of the order can mean the defendant is arrested and placed 
back in jail.
 
✓ Address confidentiality: A defendant has the right to all police reports 
involving his case. However, the prosecutor must black out all refer­
ences to where the victim is living if the victim requests such an action.
 
✓ HIV and disease testing: If the crime involved the exchange of bodily 
fluids, the victim can have the defendant tested to see whether he has a 
disease.
 
✓ Consultation about plea offers: The victim can request that the pros­
ecutor confer with her about any deals the state plans to offer the defen­
dant. This right doesn’t mean the prosecutor has to do what the victim 
wants, however.
	
	It’s important to note that prosecutors are not the victims’ lawyers (they 
represent the state). Sometimes victims don’t want the defendant to 
be prosecuted (a situation that frequently occurs in domestic violence 
cases). But the prosecutor can go ahead with the case anyway.
 
✓ Option to refuse to be interviewed by the defense attorney or investi­
gator: Although anyone can refuse to be interviewed, victims can make 
this declaration early in the process and, theoretically, not be bothered 
at all by the defendant’s representatives.
 
✓ Opportunity to give a statement at sentencing: One of the most impor­
tant victims’ rights is known as the victim impact statement, which means 
that, at the time of sentencing, the victim gets to tell the judge how the 
crime impacted her. The victim can address the court directly or have 
the prosecutor read a statement.
 
✓ Restitution: If a victim suffered financial loss, she has a right to a court 
order that requires the defendant to pay the money back. Typically, the 
defendant makes monthly payments to the court, which then distributes 
the money back to the victim.

56
Part I: Defining and Measuring Crime 
Enforcing victims’ rights
What happens when someone in the justice system violates one of these 
rights? In many states, the answer is nothing. Victims’ rights often don’t have 
any teeth. However, a number of states have begun to enact laws to give vic­
tims some recourse in the event that they believe their rights have been vio­
lated. Even so, protecting victims’ rights can quickly become complicated.
Picture this scenario: A victim is notified that the defendant who attacked her 
is about to be arraigned. She doesn’t attend the hearing because the victim 
advocate told her that nothing significant usually happens at an arraignment. 
But at the arraignment, the defendant receives the plea offer and decides to 
take the deal and be sentenced. The victim clearly hasn’t been notified of the 
sentencing proceeding.
Should the judge go forward with the case? Or should the judge slow down 
the whole system and schedule a new hearing so that the victim can be noti­
fied and given the right to be present? The judge faces a choice between 
achieving greater efficiency and notifying the victim. In an overburdened 
system, the temptation to quickly resolve the case is great. If the judge 
decides to go forward with the case, the victim doesn’t have much recourse.
A few states, however, have created mechanisms through which victims can 
file complaints about violations of rights. For example, for certain serious 
crimes in Colorado, if a victim feels her rights were violated, she can file a 
complaint with a committee responsible for enforcing victims’ rights. The 
committee may conduct a hearing to assess the facts. If it determines that a 
violation occurred, it may issue recommendations to resolve the complaint. 
For instance, if a prosecutor failed to notify a victim of an important hearing, 
the prosecutor’s office may be required to create a formal policy for victim 
notification and to train its staff on how to notify victims. Although these 
kinds of repercussions may not do an individual victim much good, they do 
help to improve the overall system.
Although just about everyone in the criminal justice system is in favor of pro­
tecting victims, in reality, the system sometimes sees victims as complicating 
factors. After all, they can slow down the process and create extra political 
pressure on judges and prosecutors. However, given the fact that victims 
were ignored for so long, the fact that they now have some power in the 
courtroom is a great step forward. After all, an innocent victim who is forced 
into the criminal justice system against her will is entitled to have the system 
slow down a little to make sure she receives justice.

ot all crimes are the same, of course. Some involve 
physical attacks on people, and some involve 
damage or misuse of people’s property. Some crimes are 
committed by people acting alone, and some require a

crimes these days involve drugs, and others are designed 
to evoke terror. In this part, I describe all these types of 
crimes and more.

E

ver since Cain snuck up behind his brother Abel, violence has been a 
part of the human condition. This fact isn’t exactly a source of pride, but 
you can’t deny it — any more than you can deny the fact that, as humans, 
you and I experience anger, jealousy, acne, and bad breath.
No human character trait has caused more misery and grief than mankind’s 
propensity for violence. In this chapter, I show you how violence manifests 
itself in criminal activity, and I walk you through the most common causes of 
that violence.
Identifying Types of Violent Crimes
When one person physically harms another, that person’s violent conduct is 
generally (but not always) punishable as a crime. Through laws enacted by 
state legislatures and Congress, society uses the following criteria to rank the 
seriousness of violent crimes:
 
✓ The type of violence
 
✓ The severity of the violence
 
✓ The harm the violence caused
 
✓ Whether the offender intended to cause harm
In the following sections, I offer an overview of various types of violent 
crimes, including what each crime entails, who’s most likely to commit each 
crime, and how severe the punishment for each crime is.

60
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Defining Homicide
The most serious type of violent crime is homicide, which is the killing of 
one human being by another. But not all homicides are equal. There’s a big 
difference, for example, between capital murder and assisted suicide. Here, I 
explain the labels that the law uses to characterize homicides, and I note the 
circumstances in which each label is applied.
	
Homicide tends to be a young man’s crime. Over the last 30 years, persons 
between the ages of 18 and 24 have been much more likely to commit homi­
cide than any other age group, and men are about ten times more likely than 
women to commit homicide.
Murder
Murder is a type of homicide that most states once defined as the killing 
of another human being with “malice aforethought.” Because that’s such 
a tough phrase to crack, many states have nixed it from their laws. Hence, 
murder is now more commonly defined as the intentional killing of another 
human being.
Some states require proof of premeditation or deliberation to convict some­
one of murder. Premeditation means that the killer not only intended to kill 
the victim, but also made a cool-headed, thoughtful decision to do so. A typi­
cal sentence for murder may be anywhere from 20 years to life in prison.
Although the word murder is more specific than homicide, it often isn’t spe­
cific enough for today’s criminal justice system. Thus, you hear terms like 
first-degree murder and capital murder. Keep reading to find out how the law 
distinguishes between the different types of murder.
First- and second-degree murder
Instead of just using the word murder, some states refer to an intentional kill­
ing as first-degree murder. Those states use the term second-degree murder to 
describe a murder in which the killer didn’t intend the death but nonethe­
less exhibited behavior that demonstrated “extreme indifference to human 
life” or “wanton disregard” for the life of the victim. For example, a gang 
member who drove by the home of a rival gang member and fired a shot into 
the home that killed someone may be convicted of second-degree murder 
because he manifested extreme indifference to human life.
In the states that have laws ascribing degrees to the different types of murder, 
first-degree murder is the most serious and receives the most serious sentence. 

61
 Chapter 5: Getting Violent: Crimes of Force
Generally, a person who commits first-degree murder receives 25 years to life 
in prison. Second-degree murder (also called manslaughter in some states) 
can net a prison sentence of 10 to 25 years.
Felony murder
In many states, if a death occurs during the commission of a serious felony 
(such as a robbery or a kidnapping), all participants in that felony can be 
charged with murder, hence the term felony murder.
For example, a gang decides to rob a bank. During the course of the robbery, 
one of the robbers shoots and kills a bank guard. Under a felony murder statute, 
the driver of the getaway car — who never even set foot inside the bank — 
can also be charged with felony murder.
The sentence for a felony murder conviction is usually similar to the sen­
tence for regular murder — anywhere from 20 years to life in prison.
Capital murder
The most serious type of murder is that which can be punished by a death 
sentence. Because the death sentence is also known as capital punishment, 
this type of murder is sometimes called capital murder. Although most indus­
trialized nations have abolished capital punishment, the United States has 
not — 36 states still allow for some form of capital punishment.
The U.S. Supreme Court has significantly limited the cases in which someone 
can be sentenced to death. Most importantly, there must be “aggravating cir­
cumstances” above and beyond the murder itself. In other words, there must 
be additional factors that make the murder worse than just an intentional kill­
ing. Some common aggravating circumstances include the following:
 
✓ More than one person was murdered.
 
✓ The person murdered was a child.
 
✓ The murder took place during the course of another serious felony being 
committed. (Unlike felony murder, only the killer who personally com­
mitted the murder can be charged with capital murder.)
 
✓ The victim was tortured before the murder.
 
✓ The person murdered was a government official, a police officer, or a 
witness in a criminal or civil trial.
In addition to requiring aggravating circumstances, many states also require 
the prosecutor to show deliberation by the defendant — meaning that he thought 
about his actions before committing them. Many states also require the prosecu­
tor to prove there’s a likelihood that the killer will commit future acts of violence.

62
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
U.S. Supreme Court rulings have required that during a capital murder trial, the 
defendant be given the chance to present evidence to persuade the jury that 
he should not be sentenced to death. Such evidence can include the following:
 
✓ Proof that he was raised by negligent parents
 
✓ Proof that he has no previous history of violence
 
✓ Proof of the positive contributions he has made to society
	
Adults who are legally insane (see Chapter 20 for more on this term) or men­
tally retarded aren’t eligible for a death sentence. People under the age of 18 
can’t receive the death sentence, either. For a detailed discussion of the death 
penalty, turn to Chapter 21.
Manslaughter
Manslaughter refers to the non-intentional killing of another person, but the 
killer still has some moral responsibility for the death. For example, a severely 
intoxicated driver who runs a red light while talking on his cellphone probably 
doesn’t intend to crash his car and kill his passenger. But the state can still call 
his conduct reckless, which justifies a manslaughter charge. (See Chapter 2 for 
an explanation of the difference between intentional and reckless conduct.)
Often in a homicide in which the intent to kill is difficult to prove, prosecu­
tors choose to negotiate a guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter. A sentence 
for manslaughter typically ranges from 1 to 15 years.
As you may have guessed, manslaughter appears very similar to second-
degree murder. In fact, they’re essentially the same. Some states have first- 
and second-degree murder, and some states have murder and manslaughter.
Negligent homicide
In criminal law, a person who engages in negligent conduct is considered less 
responsible than someone who is reckless. (In case you ever want to go to 
law school, know that conduct is negligent if the actor should’ve been aware 
of a substantial risk of doing harm. Conduct is reckless if the actor was aware 
of the substantial risk of doing harm but chose to engage in the activity 
anyway.) However, in some states, even negligently causing someone’s death 
can result in a charge of negligent homicide. For example, an intoxicated driver 
who is not talking on his cellphone and who does not run a red light can still be 
charged with negligent homicide if he crashes his car and kills his passenger.
A sentence for negligent homicide may range from probation to five years in 
prison.

63
 Chapter 5: Getting Violent: Crimes of Force
Assisting a suicide
Technically, suicide isn’t a homicide because it doesn’t involve the killing of 
another human being. However, in many countries (such as India), attempted 
suicide is a crime. (I’m not aware of any states in the United States that 
punish attempted suicide.)
In the United States, helping another person commit suicide — an act known 
as euthanasia — can be punished as homicide. Most famously, Dr. Jack 
Kevorkian, who claimed to have assisted 130 people in committing suicide, 
was convicted of second-degree murder in Michigan and served eight years 
in prison before being paroled in 2007.
	
As of this writing, Oregon and Washington are the only states that have 
legalized physician-assisted suicide. Washington passed its law in 2009. And 
Oregon’s Death with Dignity Act, which took effect in 1997, allows Oregon citi­
zens with terminal medical conditions to get prescriptions from their doctors 
for self-administered, lethal doses of “medication.”
Attacking or Threatening Someone: 
Assault and Battery
Although the words assault and battery are often used interchangeably, in 
many states, they mean two different things:
	
✓ Battery: This crime requires actual physical contact that is offensive in 
some way.
 
✓ Assault: This crime typically refers to just a threat of battery, or an 
attempted battery, without actual physical contact. However, in states 
that don’t use the word “battery,” an assault may mean actual physical 
contact that’s offensive or causes injury. In other words, in those states, 
assault is the same thing as battery.
For example, if you pull out a gun and tell someone you’re going to shoot him, 
you’re committing an assault (among other offenses). If you actually shoot 
the person without killing him, you’re committing a battery.
	
The seriousness of these types of crimes and the sentences they warrant in 
court generally depend on whether a weapon is used and on how severe the 
harm caused is. Here are two key distinctions:
 
✓ Simple assault or battery refers to conduct that results in low-level phys­
ical injury, not serious injury. It’s typically punished as a misdemeanor 
with only a little jail time.

64
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
 
✓ Aggravated assault or battery refers to serious felony conduct that 
involves the use of a dangerous or deadly weapon or that results in 
serious injury. Aggravated assault or battery may result in a lengthy 
prison sentence of one to ten years (or even more, depending on the 
circumstances).
The types of conduct that can result in a criminal charge of battery (or 
assault) are almost limitless, but here are just a few examples:
 
✓ Punching or slapping
 
✓ Stabbing
 
✓ Shooting
 
✓ Using any object as a weapon to cause an injury
 
✓ Crashing a vehicle
I once prosecuted someone who repeatedly kicked another person using 
steel-toed boots. I charged the defendant with battery with a “dangerous 
weapon,” a charge that resulted in a longer sentence than the defendant 
would’ve received with a simple battery charge.
In the following sections, I discuss the major crimes involving assault and 
battery.
Vehicular assault
Car crashes are the most common means of violent death or serious physical 
injury in the United States. Groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving 
(MADD) have helped elevate society’s awareness of the damage that can be 
done by a speeding, three-ton pile of metal. As a consequence, many states 
have created offenses, such as vehicular assault, that criminalize dangerous 
driving that results in injury. However, just crashing a car and injuring some­
one isn’t enough to constitute a crime. In most states, the driver must have 
driven recklessly to warrant a charge.
Although reckless driving can involve a number of behaviors, such as speed­
ing or running a red light, intoxication is by far the primary factor prosecu­
tors use in proving vehicular assault, in part because intoxication is involved 
in so many crashes. If a driver wasn’t intoxicated during a crash, to win a 
conviction of vehicular assault, a prosecutor has to prove very bad driving 
judgment (such as drag racing on a busy street).
Sentences for vehicular assault often depend on the severity of the victim’s 
injury. A sentence can range from probation with no jail to eight or more 
years in prison.

 Chapter 5: Getting Violent: Crimes of Force
Spousal assault
Also known as domestic assault or intimate partner violence, spousal assault 
usually involves violence between domestic partners and is most often com­
mitted by men toward women. More than 21 percent of all nonfatal violence 
against women is inflicted by an intimate partner. (In contrast, only 3.6 per­
cent of nonfatal violence against men is inflicted by an intimate partner.)
Female victims of such violence are usually emotionally attached and finan­
cially dependent on their abusers, which may lead them to go through what’s 
known as the cycle of domestic violence (see Figure 5-1).
	
Figure 5-1: 
The cycle 
of domestic 
violence.
	
A violent incident occurs
The abuser apologizes and
promises to do better
The victim forgives the abuser
The abuser exercises more control
over the victim, often limiting access
to friends, family, and finances
The relationship is better for a while
In the past 15 years, domestic violence victim services have become much 
more commonplace. These services include short-term shelters for women 
and children fleeing from violence, along with counseling and employment 
services to help victims break the cycle. Perhaps not coincidentally, victim­
ization survey results show that incidents of domestic violence in the United 
States have been steadily declining since 1993. (Check out Chapter 3 for more 
on victimization surveys and Chapter 4 for more on victim services.)
	
Keep in mind, though, that gathering a true statistical picture of the scope of 
intimate partner violence is difficult. By nature, this violence occurs within the 
home — away from witnesses — which makes arrest and prosecution difficult.

66
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
In cases of spousal assault, conflicts sometimes occur between law enforce­
ment officers and victim service providers. Law enforcement officers are gen­
erally concerned with obtaining evidence to punish the violent offender. On 
the other hand, victim service providers want to protect the victim. In doing 
so, they may take actions that inhibit an investigation, such as refusing to dis­
close the victim’s location to police.
Fortunately, as victims’ rights have become a more significant part of the 
criminal justice system, such conflicts are becoming less common (see 
Chapter 4 for more on victims’ rights). Nonetheless, finding a female domes­
tic violence victim who is willing to cooperate with the prosecution against 
an offender is still unusual. Most often, the victim refuses to cooperate.
Because most domestic violence doesn’t involve severe injuries, a typical 
sentence for a spousal assault charge involves probation and some jail time, 
along with requirements to complete anger management training and per­
haps drug or alcohol treatment. Sometimes, however, spousal abuse does 
result in serious injury to the victim. When that occurs, the offenders may 
receive prison sentences of one to ten years or more.
Child abuse
	
Child abuse is a great concern to policymakers and the public. Today the term 
child abuse means more than just physical violence against children; it also 
includes neglect and mistreatment.
Traditionally, courts have shown great deference to parents with regard to 
child-rearing strategies, but criminal child abuse or child neglect is generally 
far beyond anything that can be considered “parenting.” For example, in the 
homes of parents who are drug addicts, it’s common to find pet and human 
feces throughout the house, garbage piled up so that the floor isn’t even vis­
ible, and drug paraphernalia strewn about. Children may regularly watch 
their parents do drugs, and they may go without proper food or medical care 
for extended periods of time.
In addition to narcotics abuse, which is an issue in roughly 70 percent of all 
child abuse cases, parents may also abuse children because they learned the 
behavior from their own parents. If parents were abused as children, they 
may not know other skills for dealing with children and may resort to vio­
lence when they’re angry or frustrated. Such violence can include physically 
beating a child, hitting a child with a belt or bat, burning a child’s skin with a 
cigarette, and shaking a baby. (Because an infant’s brain is so vulnerable, just 
one or two violent shakes can result in serious injury or even death — a situ­
ation called shaken baby syndrome.)
There are roughly 900,000 reported cases of child abuse in the United States 
each year, which means 12 out of every 1,000 children. However, this crime 

67
 Chapter 5: Getting Violent: Crimes of Force
often goes unreported, so the actual number of abuse cases has been esti­
mated as high as 2.7 million. The majority of this abuse takes the form of 
neglect rather than physical or sexual violence.
Sentences for child abuse can range from probation to lengthy prison sen­
tences. Judges prefer to keep families intact — if doing so won’t put the child 
in danger — so probationary sentences that require the defendant to undergo 
parenting education and drug or alcohol treatment are fairly common.
Forcing Sexual Contact: Rape, Sodomy, 
and Child Molestation
Sexual violence can take many forms, from improper sexual touching to 
sodomy and rape, and most states have numerous laws that punish each and 
every one. For example, a state may have several degrees of rape, sodomy, 
and sexual abuse that vary based on the age and mental capacity of the 
victim and on the offender’s use of force.
In this section, I take a closer look at what constitutes rape, sodomy, and 
child molestation, as well as what sentences these crimes carry with them.
Rape and sodomy
The crime of rape traditionally requires proof that someone (usually a man) 
forcibly compelled someone else (usually a woman) to have sexual intercourse. 
However, rape can also involve consensual sexual intercourse between an 
adult and a partner under the age of 18 (a crime called statutory rape) or inter­
course with someone whom the law deems incapable of consent because of a 
mental handicap. The word sodomy refers to forced anal or oral sex or to those 
same acts when they’re done consensually between an adult and a juvenile.
Society once believed that rape and sodomy were offenses committed by 
men unable to control their sexual desires. But in the past 30 years or so, 
society has come to see crimes such as rape and sodomy as violent acts com­
mitted by both men and women that result in lasting physical and emotional 
damage to the victim.
	
Today the most common type of rape is rape committed by a person the 
victim knows. In fact, according to the 2006 National Crime Victimization 
Survey, more than 70 percent of rape victims knew their offenders.
For example, date rape, a kind of rape that appears most often in campus 
settings, is when someone you know forces you to have sexual intercourse, 

68
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
usually at the end of a date or other social outing. One reason why date rape 
appears in campus settings is because a large percentage of all rapes are 
committed by men under the age of 25. Higher levels of alcohol and drug 
abuse, which are also common on campuses, likely play a role, too.
The media has paid a lot of attention to date-rape drugs, such as gamma-
hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), that are put in a victim’s drink to render that 
person more susceptible. Keep in mind, however, that alcohol consumption 
plays a much more significant role in making women vulnerable to sexual 
offenses.
The heavy consumption of alcohol or drugs by a victim not only makes the 
victim more susceptible to abuse but also makes prosecuting the offender 
more difficult. This is because the victim may have a poor memory of the 
events and may have engaged in conduct that the defendant will offer as evi­
dence that the victim consented to the act.
Victims of rape experience a wide range of lasting physical and emotional 
effects. For example, for purposes of prosecution, women are encouraged to 
be examined by a doctor to obtain forensic evidence of rape (such as semen, 
pubic hairs, and blood). This experience can be frightening and embarrass­
ing. Rape victims may also contract venereal diseases, become pregnant, 
suffer economic loss, and struggle with the significant emotional impacts. 
Fortunately, within the last 15 to 20 years, police and victim services workers 
have become much better at recognizing these challenges and helping vic­
tims through their ordeals.
Although each state is different, forcible rape and sodomy are usually pun­
ished by severe sentences, somewhere between 5 and 20 years, depending 
on the circumstances. Statutory rape, involving consensual sex between 
an adult and a minor, results in much shorter punishment and typically no 
prison time.
Child molestation
Few crimes provoke more public anger than child molestation, a sexual offense 
against a prepubescent child. And, yet, this type of crime occurs with alarming 
frequency. Statistics on the exact number of child molestation cases are dif­
ficult to come by. (One reason for this lack of stats is that the National Crime 
Victimization Survey, one of the most reliable measures of crime, reaches 
out only to people older than 12.) But you can get an idea of how many child 
molestation crimes occur by looking at a survey released in 1994 that tracked 
the actions of more than 9,600 convicted sex offenders after they were released 
from prison. The purpose of this survey was to measure how often convicted 
sex offenders committed more sex offenses after their release.

69
 Chapter 5: Getting Violent: Crimes of Force
The results were alarming: The survey concluded that sex offenders were 
four times more likely than other violent offenders to be rearrested for sex 
crimes. But the most disconcerting number that came out of this survey is 
this: Almost 4,300 of the 9,600+ sex offenders involved in this study, or almost 
half, were child molesters.
Looking at who commits child molestation
Frequently, child molestation involves someone in the child’s household. 
But other molesters may hold jobs or volunteer positions that place them in 
close proximity to children; they may be youth counselors or coaches, for 
example. Whoever the child molester is, he often “grooms” a child for the 
crime by trying to convince him or her that sex with an adult is okay.
I once prosecuted a case that provides a classic example of grooming. A man 
spent lots of time at a community swimming pool during the summer. Of all the 
kids who came swimming every day, he identified two susceptible 8-year-old 
boys and quickly befriended them, talking about video games, skateboards, 
and so on. He eventually persuaded one of the boys to engage in multiple acts 
of sodomy. (This man was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison.)
Molesters also separately groom adult parents and community members, 
seeking to gain their trust so they can have greater access to their children. 
They go to great lengths to persuade parents that they’re trustworthy and 
reliable. Although offenders are almost always male, the child victims may be 
male or female.
Quite often, sentences for sexual molestation of a child are similar to sentences 
for forcible rape on adults (see the “Rape and sodomy” section for more details).
Considering the reasons why and the effects on victims
Why would someone molest a child? That’s the million-dollar question. 
Clearly, some people have sex drives directed toward children — psycholo­
gists and psychiatrists call this condition pedophilia. But how this sex drive 
ultimately leads a person to actually violate a child is difficult to say.
Criminologists can certainly speculate that the increased use of the Internet 
has had a profound effect on the crime of child molestation. Just a few 
decades ago, a person with some sexual drive toward children would’ve had 
a tough time obtaining child pornography or finding like-minded people to 
associate with. Today, child molesters can use chat rooms to communicate 
with one another, discuss strategies, and generally encourage one another 
that their behaviors are okay. And, of course, child pornography flows across 
the Internet virtually unabated. The combination of chat-room support from 
like-minded people and stimulation from child pornography may lead some 
people down a path where they ultimately molest a child.

70
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
	
Perhaps even more significant is the fact that children who are sexually abused 
are much more likely to become abusers themselves. A 2001 study by Gene 
Abel, MD, and Nora Harlow found that more than 47 percent of child molesters 
admitted being similarly abused as children. Of children who were abused more 
than 50 times, 82 percent became pedophiles when they matured.
Along with the greater risk of becoming molesters themselves, victims of 
molestation can suffer dramatic, life-altering emotional damage and possibly 
even destroyed familial relationships. For example, if the molester is a family 
member or the boyfriend of the mother, the prosecution process may pit 
the child against his or her own relatives. For this reason, many children are 
reluctant or unwilling to cooperate with police. Detectives and prosecutors 
with specialized expertise often work with child sex victims to help conduct 
interviews and get the full story.
Taking Property under the Threat 
of Violence: Robbery
Robbery is essentially theft by force. Stealing a woman’s purse from her 
closet is theft. Knocking her down and taking her purse directly off her shoul­
der is robbery. Unlike theft and burglary, which are both considered property 
crimes, robbery is considered a violent crime and is usually punished more 
severely because it involves a risk to the personal safety of the victim (see 
Chapter 6 for more on theft, burglary, and other property crimes).
The amount of punishment doled out for robbery generally depends on 
whether a weapon is used and, if so, the type of weapon used. Here are the 
basic distinctions among weapons:
 
✓ Deadly weapons: In most states, using a firearm during the commission 
of a robbery results in the most severe sentences. Using other weapons 
capable of causing death (called deadly weapons) may also result in 
severe punishment.
	
	Armed robbery, for example, may result in a sentence of one to ten years 
in state prison. Although most violent crimes are handled in state court, 
bank robbery is commonly prosecuted in the federal system where sen­
tences can reach 20 years in prison if the robber was armed.
 
✓ Dangerous weapons: This category of weapons includes those that can 
cause significant injury, such as clubs, fists, and stun guns. Using a dan­
gerous weapon during a robbery may result in a more severe sentence 
than a robbery without a weapon.
 
✓ Pretend weapons: Of course, I can’t neglect to mention the robber with 
his hand in his pocket, pretending to have a gun. In many states, even 
pretending to possess a weapon may result in an enhanced sentence.

71
 Chapter 5: Getting Violent: Crimes of Force
By far, most robberies happen to people in vehicles. For instance, carjack­
ing is when a robber forces a person out of his car and then takes the car. In 
2007, 20 robberies of people in vehicles were committed for every one bank 
robbery. Also, far more common than bank robberies are robberies of conve­
nience stores and homes.
	
Unlike most other violent crimes, which peak during summer months, more 
robberies occur during the colder months. Some criminologists theorize that 
the reason behind this trend is the increased darkness in the colder months, 
which helps to conceal the crime. Also, wearing a mask and hat to cover your 
appearance without raising suspicions is much easier to do in the winter.
Robberies of drug dealers are extremely common, too, but few of these cases 
show up in statistics compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). 
Obviously, drug dealers aren’t likely to report being victimized, which is pre­
cisely what makes them such appealing targets to robbers.
Kidnapping
When you hear the word kidnapping, you likely think of the taking and hold­
ing of a person against her will for ransom purposes. Early in the 20th cen­
tury, kidnappings of public or wealthy citizens happened regularly. The most 
famous case may have been the kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh’s infant son 
from his bedroom.
Other well-known cases include the kidnappings of the granddaughter 
of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst in California and of the 
9-year-old son of lumberman J. P. Weyerhaeuser from Tacoma, Washington.
These days, however, kidnapping for ransom is relatively rare in the United 
States. Much more common than kidnapping for ransom is kidnapping in con­
junction with another crime. For example, in a rape case, if a person is trans­
ported or confined against her will, a prosecutor may charge the offender 
with both rape and kidnapping.
Recently, the United States is seeing cases where Mexican kidnappers snatch 
family members of other Mexicans who are in the country illegally and hold 
them for ransom. Kidnappers view this action as a low-risk crime because the 
victims aren’t likely to contact police for fear of being deported.
Because kidnapping is relatively rare in the United States, the FBI doesn’t 
gather statistics on the number of kidnappings that occur.
Sentences for kidnapping are often similar to those for other violent crimes, 
such as robbery, rape, or aggravated assault.

Pinpointing Causes of Violence
Why does a man strangle his spouse? Why does a woman shake her infant 
son until he dies? Why does a street gang member unload a clip into the 
home of a rival gang member?
Although the specific reasons why people commit crimes of violence vary 
from case to case, criminologists study potential underlying causes with the 
hope that they may be able to reduce the amount of violence in society. Keep 
in mind that these studies aren’t just academic exercises; policymakers base 
significant policy decisions on the conclusions that criminologists make from 
their studies. For example, does lengthening prison sentences deter some 
violent offenders from committing crimes? The answer to that question can 
lead to changes in the way judges hand down sentences. And do early family-
intervention programs for juvenile delinquents help turn juveniles away from 
violent crime? The answer to that question can influence how much govern­
ment money is or isn’t funneled into such prevention programs.
U.S. violent crime rates in recent decades
Here’s a sampling of violent crime rates in the 
United States:
 ✓ Homicide: According to Uniform Crime 
Report statistics from the FBI, the homicide 
rate in the United States rose steadily from 
1965 to 1980, when it peaked at more than 
ten homicides per 100,000 persons. The 
rate remained relatively high until it began 
to decline in 1993. In 1999, the homicide rate 
again stabilized, and it has since remained 
at roughly 5.6 homicides for every 100,000 
persons.
 ✓ Assault and battery: According to the 
National Crime Victimization Study, 
the number of assaults and batteries in the 
United States peaked at about 12 aggra­
vated assaults and 30 simple assaults for 
every 1,000 persons around 1993 and has 
been dropping ever since. In 2005, the U.S. 
assault rate was around 1,700 assaults for 
every 100,000 persons.
 ✓ Rape and other sexual assault: According to 
the 2006 National Crime Victimization Survey, 
there were 192,320 rapes or attempted 
rapes that year in the United States and 
a total of 260,940 sexual assaults — 
roughly 90 incidents per 100,000 persons. 
From 1999 to 2006, there was a marked trend 
toward fewer rapes and sexual assaults; 
but, in 2006, an uptick in the number of 
rapes and sexual assaults occurred.
 ✓ Robbery: According to FBI statistics, the 
number of robberies has been declining in 
the United States since 1991, when more 
than 687,000 robberies were committed. In 
2007, the number was down to 445,125.

73
 Chapter 5: Getting Violent: Crimes of Force
There are at least five key factors that may play a part in someone’s decision 
to engage in violence. I discuss these five factors in this section:
 
✓ Drugs and alcohol
 
✓ Family troubles
 
✓ Mental illness
 
✓ Society
 
✓ Personal choices
Struggling with drugs and alcohol
Are you ready for a shocking statistic? More than half of all persons arrested 
have illegal drugs in their systems.
Not surprisingly, studies have shown a strong correlation between drug and 
alcohol use and increased violence. For example, more than 25 percent of 
defendants facing domestic violence charges have substance abuse prob­
lems. Other studies have shown that kids who had used drugs in the previous 
year were more than twice as likely to engage in violence when compared 
with non–drug users. And the more drugs used, the greater the likelihood of 
violence. Of kids who had used more than three drugs in the previous year, 
more than 61 percent had engaged in violence. In contrast, only 26 percent of 
kids who hadn’t used drugs had engaged in violence.
Drugs aren’t the only mind-altering substances associated with increased 
criminal violence. A 1996 study revealed that almost 40 percent of violent 
acts involved the use of alcohol, 40 percent of fatal motor vehicle crashes 
involved alcohol, and 66 percent of domestic violence victims reported that 
alcohol was a factor in their assaults.
	
When substance abuse directly leads to violent conduct, criminologists refer to 
the connection as a psychopharmacological relationship. A clear-cut example of 
this kind of relationship can be found in a condition known as methamphetamine 
psychosis. This condition occurs in methamphetamine abusers and can result in 
extreme paranoia, delusions, panic, and a great propensity for violence. When a 
person suffering from methamphetamine psychosis commits an assault, there’s 
a psychopharmacological relationship between the drug and the crime.
As I explore in detail in Chapter 9, even more violence results from the busi­
ness of illegal narcotics. Drug traffickers commonly protect territory and 
trafficking routes by using murder, assaults, and kidnapping. For example, 
in 2008 and 2009, the Mexican side of the U.S. border experienced extreme 
violence. As the Mexican government cracked down on international drug 

74
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
traffickers, and as those same traffickers fought for control over the lucra­
tive border region, more than 71 people were murdered in Tijuana, Mexico, in 
just a nine-day period in the fall of 2008. In the first five months of 2009, there 
were 671 murders in the city of Ciudad Juarez.
The drug business within the United States also commonly results in violence 
as dealers compete for markets and customers. Increasingly, violent offend­
ers commit armed robberies (known as rips) on drug dealers, seeking to 
obtain drugs or cash. Drug dealers are particularly susceptible to violence 
because they’re not likely to seek protection from law enforcement.
Feeling the lasting effects 
of family troubles
Proving that a particular family problem led to a particular act of violence 
is probably impossible. Nonetheless, some common issues within a family 
are associated with juvenile delinquency and future violence. For example, 
violence between parents (or between a parent and his or her partner) has 
been linked to future violence by children. For this reason, many state laws 
provide more severe punishment for domestic violence when it’s committed 
in the presence of a child.
Similarly, physical and sexual abuse by adults on children may play a big 
part in leading those children to commit the same acts when they grow up. 
Kids who are constantly exposed to violence can come to view violence as an 
appropriate way to solve conflict. For example, a boy who regularly sees his 
mom’s boyfriend physically and emotionally abuse his mom may copy the 
abusive behavior when he grows up because he never learned other skills for 
resolving arguments with others, especially women.
Organized drug rips
In 2008, eight people from an organized gang were 
indicted in New York for a five-year crime spree 
in which the defendants allegedly impersonated 
police to take drugs and cash off of large-scale 
cocaine dealers. The crimes occurred across 
five states and netted more than $20 million 
worth of cocaine and $4 million in cash. More 
than 100 cocaine dealers were victimized.
According to court papers, the robbers some­
times conducted police-style traffic stops of 
cocaine dealers who were transporting drugs 
or money. In other cases, the robbers invaded 
cocaine dealers’ homes and bound family mem­
bers with duct tape and handcuffs, sometimes 
holding them hostage for days. One victim 
recounted how the robbers applied pliers to his 
testicles and threatened to squeeze if he didn’t 
reveal the location of large caches of cocaine. 
Other victims reported being tortured, including 
having their heads held under water to force 
them to talk. After the cocaine was located, the 
gang sold the drugs on the streets of New York.

75
 Chapter 5: Getting Violent: Crimes of Force
At the opposite end of the spectrum from physical abuse, some parents may 
not discipline their kids at all. If a child is never reigned in after misbehaving, 
he may be less likely to learn proper boundaries or decision-making skills. 
Later in life, that kid may be less able to conform to society’s rules, including 
laws against violence.
Suffering from mental problems
Studies of groups of murderers have revealed that murderers are likely to 
have lower IQs than the average citizen. You might say that they have mental 
deficiencies.
Note that a mental deficiency is much different from a mental disease, which 
is a mental illness as defined by psychiatrists and psychologists. In court, a 
mental disease can be the basis of an insanity defense. A mental deficiency 
such as a decreased IQ, on the other hand, can’t be part of an insanity 
defense; it simply helps explain, in part, why someone may have committed 
an act of violence.
One mental disease that prosecutors often encounter in criminal cases is 
paranoid schizophrenia. For example, a person who suffers from paranoid 
schizophrenia may experience a delusion in which he believes his television 
is telling him to kill his neighbor’s dog. If he actually kills the dog, he’ll likely 
be excused from criminal responsibility thanks to an insanity defense. (For a 
more detailed discussion of the insanity defense, see Chapter 20.)
A personality disorder is yet another mental problem that can be a cause of 
violence. Like a mental disease, a personality disorder is diagnosed by a psy­
chologist or psychiatrist. But it’s not considered as severe a disability as a 
mental disease and, therefore, can’t be used for an insanity defense. Two of 
the best-known personality disorders in the criminal justice system are
 
✓ Narcissistic personality disorder: Someone with this disorder generally 
sees herself as very important, needs others to see her as important, 
and lacks the ability to experience empathy with others.
 
✓ Antisocial personality disorder: Someone with this disorder has a pat­
tern of disregarding the rights of others that starts when she’s a juvenile 
and progresses into adulthood.
Similar to antisocial personality disorder is a characteristic known as psychopa­
thy. A psychopath is a predator who uses charm, manipulation, and violence 
to control others and achieve her own selfish needs without experiencing 
any guilt or remorse. Studies of psychopaths within prisons reveal that psy­
chopaths are generally untreatable and may even become more cunning and 
manipulative after being subjected to treatment. Psychopaths are also consid­
ered much more likely to engage in future acts of violence than other inmates.

76
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
See Chapter 14 for a more detailed discussion of how a psychological or per­
sonality disorder can lead to criminal behavior.
Being influenced by society
Some criminologists look to cultural values within a society as a potential 
cause for violence. For example, the murder rate in Japan has been measured 
at less than 10 percent of that in the United States. For this reason, some 
people have theorized that the United States, which highly values indepen­
dence and self-reliance, may have more violence, in part, because of these 
values. In contrast, Japan is a more socially organized country that places 
less value on independently resolving conflict and, thus, has less violence.
Today’s society also offers people constant access to violent messages. Some 
people believe that relentless exposure to violence (through TV programs, 
movies, music, video games, and so on) may desensitize children, making 
them more likely to resort to violence to resolve conflicts. One analysis con­
cluded that by the time the average child in the United States reaches the age 
of 8, she has seen 8,000 murders on TV, and by the time she reaches 18, she’s 
seen more than 200,000 acts of violence on TV.
I devote Chapter 13 to exploring theories of how society may influence some­
one to become a criminal.
Making a personal choice
Drugs, mental health, and pop culture all may play a role in influencing some­
one to commit a violent crime, as I discuss earlier in the chapter. But another 
possibility is that criminal violence is, in part, a conscious, rational choice 
based on how an individual weighs the risks of committing a crime versus its 
potential rewards.
How else can you explain why two brothers raised in the same family environ­
ment and culture take radically different paths in life? Why does one become 
a drug dealer who commits capital murder while the other becomes a produc­
tive member of society? (I explore this theory in detail in Chapter 12.)

N

o other crime affects more people than property crime. Odds are that 
you haven’t been the victim of a serious violent felony, but I bet you’ve 
been the victim of at least one property crime. After all, three-fourths of all 
crime is property crime. The term property crime refers to all the types of 
crime that impact your property, including theft, fraud, burglary, arson, van­
dalism, Internet scams, car break-ins, and auto theft.
I’ve actually been the victim of property crime on more than one occasion. 
For instance, I had a pickup truck that thieves repeatedly broke into when I 
lived in San Francisco. Eventually, I decided to leave it unlocked so that the 
thieves could get inside without breaking the windows.
The amount of property crime in the United States dropped significantly 
between 1974 and 2003 and then began to rise again slightly. In 1974, more 
than 55 property crimes for every 100 households occurred annually in the 
United States! By 2003, the number had dropped to about 16 property crimes 
per 100 households.
In this chapter, I discuss various types of property crime, and I attempt to 
explain why people commit them.

Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Categorizing Types of Theft
You may be wondering, what exactly is theft? Well, legal definitions of the 
crime can be quite complicated (see Chapter 7 if you want proof), but every­
one knows what theft is in its most basic sense: intentionally taking the prop­
erty of another person without having that person’s permission to do so.
I don’t have enough space in this book to list all the ways you can commit 
theft, but I cover the most common ones in this section.
Shoplifting
Shoplifting occurs when a person enters a retail outlet during business hours 
and intentionally takes something without paying for it. According to the 
National Association for Shoplifting Prevention (NASP), a nonprofit organiza­
tion that aims to raise awareness of the negative effects of shoplifting on the 
community, shoplifters steal approximately $35 million worth of goods from 
retailers every day (for more info on this association, check out its Web site 
at www.shopliftingprevention.org).
	
In my profession, I’ve prosecuted people for stealing cigarettes, beer, gum, 
meat, clothes, jewelry, yarn, razor blades, and even cat food. Usually, people 
don’t steal because they actually need the items. More commonly, they want 
something but either don’t want to or can’t afford to pay for it.
Two of the most common defenses against theft charges are the following:
 
✓ “It was an accident.” As in, “My daughter must have put those candy 
bars in my coat pocket before we left the store.”
 
✓ “The item is really mine.” As in, “I didn’t take these sunglasses from the 
store. I bought them two years ago.”
	
The impact of shoplifting is great — the cost of theft passes on to the law-
abiding consumer, and some estimates indicate that shoplifting raises the 
retail cost of goods by 10 to 15 percent.
Although the vast majority of shoplifters aren’t career criminals, a small per­
centage actually derives significant income from shoplifting. These people 
systematically identify and target high-value items that they can resell. 
Typically, shoplifters target small items that they can easily conceal, such 
as CDs, DVDs, and small electronics like MP3 players. But they also target 
expensive items, such as baby formula, perfume, and razor blades, which 
they can resell in flea markets or ship in volume overseas.

 Chapter 6: Hitting You in the Pocketbook: Property Crimes
In the last ten years, the practice of moving through a region, stealing from numer­
ous stores along the way, and sending the stolen goods to Mexico or another 
country has become increasingly more common among organized groups of 
thieves. The aggregate value of items stolen may be great, but each individual 
theft is small. As a result, when only one member of the gang is arrested, local 
authorities likely don’t hold her in jail, and she can then rejoin her partners in the 
next town (where she continues to steal), never returning to court.
Most large retailers employ some antitheft security, including loss-prevention 
officers (store employees who look for thieves), surveillance cameras, and 
electro-magnetic devices that sound an alarm when a thief crosses the store’s 
threshold with stolen merchandise. Sometimes retailers also lock high-value 
items in glass cases that only sales associates can open.
If a loss-prevention officer spies someone hiding an item for a possible theft, 
she follows the person outside (making sure the person doesn’t pay for the 
item) and confronts him or her. The loss-prevention officer usually asks the 
thief to go back inside to wait for the police to arrive. The loss-prevention 
officer has no more authority than a private citizen, but, in most jurisdictions, 
private citizens are allowed to detain someone — making a citizen’s arrest — 
and even use some minimum force if the person has committed a crime.
Increasingly, however, stores are discouraging their loss-prevention officers 
from making citizen’s arrests out of fear of lawsuits by people wrongfully 
detained or injured in the process.
Scamming people out of their money
Enterprising criminals often come up with creative ways to separate people 
from their money. Have you ever had someone come to your home and try 
Letting the fear of lawsuits run amok
Once at a training conference, I was sitting 
outside a grocery store eating a sandwich 
with an off-duty police officer friend. We saw 
three separate teenagers enter the store, steal 
some beer, and leave without paying. (The offi­
cer didn’t interfere because he was out of his 
jurisdiction.) We finally went inside and told 
the manager. The manager said he knew what 
was happening but that his corporate office told 
him to allow the thefts because the corporate 
office was afraid that if loss-protection officers 
chased the kids, one of them may get hit by a 
car in the parking lot and sue the store.

to sell you magazine subscriptions or frozen meat? Once a guy stopped me 
in my yard and said that he had some extra asphalt from another job and 
wanted to repave my driveway for next to nothing. Now, this offer for practi­
cally free asphalt or offers for magazines or frozen meat may be legitimate 
offers, but they can just as easily be scams — attempts to cheat you by selling 
you an inferior product or no product at all.
Although some people have little sympathy for people who get scammed, 
saying caveat emptor (“buyer beware”), scammers often pick on the most vul­
nerable people, including the elderly, who can least afford a loss.
Some of the most common scams are pyramid and ponzi schemes, which I 
distinguish here:
 
✓ Pyramid schemes take many forms, but, generally, they involve a promise 
of large profits to people who recruit others to join a program that sells 
a product. So, an initial investor may recruit five people, who, in turn, all 
recruit five more people, who take orders for the sale of a product from 
still other people. The money goes to the people higher up in the pyra­
mid. Usually there’s no product, or, at least, not enough product to fulfill 
all the orders, and the customers lose their money.
 
✓ Ponzi schemes are very similar but generally don’t involve the sale of a 
product; they’re investment scams. The initial “investor” recruits other 
investors, who all pay money to buy into the scheme. Each round of new 
investors pays previous investors until the scheme collapses and the 
people at the bottom of the pyramid lose their investments.
Both pyramid and ponzi scams have become much more common with the 
rise of the Internet.
Another common scam, with many variations, is the Nigerian or 419 scam. 
An e-mail from a “Nigerian official” offers you the opportunity to share in mil­
lions of dollars if you help place the millions in bank accounts overseas. But, 
first, you have to front several thousand dollars because the Nigerian official 
can’t yet access the millions. The label 419 scam refers to section 419 of the 
Nigerian legal code, which addresses criminal fraud.
	
Scam artists often use Internet auction sites as hosts for scams and fraud 
because of their huge popularity. Typically, a person purchases an item and 
makes payment but never receives the goods. Some common indicators of a 
possible fraudulent transaction include the seller’s request for you to send 
payment overseas or a request for you to wire money directly to the seller. 
Wire transaction payments are almost impossible to recover.
Internet sites are also hosts for selling stolen merchandise. For instance, burglars 
and organized theft rings often use Internet auction sites to sell stolen goods.

Taking personal and credit card 
information: Identity theft
The Internet has revolutionized many activities, including fraud. One of the 
most common types of Internet crime involves trying to obtain other people’s 
personal information, such as credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, 
and bank account information. This type of crime is called identity theft.
A Nigerian scam
Following is one of a series of e-mails that a 
victim of a Nigerian scam received. The e-mail 
appears as it was actually written, with all the 
original errors and crazy syntax (my editor didn’t 
want you to think she was lazy). The goal of the 
e-mail is to convince the victim to keep making 
payments to the fraudsters with the promise 
that the victim will ultimately claim a $12 million 
inheritance. The victim in this case wired more 
than $100,000 to Nigeria.

Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
If you have an e-mail account, I’m confident you’ve seen examples of phishing: 
phony e-mails that attempt to get you to divulge confidential information. In 
effect, the sender is “fishing” for your information. Often, the sender accom­
plishes this task by spoofing: sending you forged e-mails that purport to come 
from entities you do business with, such as banks or credit card companies. 
In reality, the “entity” sending the e-mails is some guy in Kerblakistan who, 
after he gets your credit card number, uses it to make purchases at will until 
he reaches your credit limit. Because so much Internet fraud originates over­
seas, you can’t do much after you’ve been fooled.
	
The Internet isn’t the only place where you find credit card theft. Some thieves 
who work in retail stores or restaurants use credit card readers to accumulate 
numbers and then charge items using those numbers, or they sell the numbers 
to other thieves via the Internet. I once prosecuted a man who was a barista in 
a high-end coffee shop. He retained a customer’s credit card number so that he 
could purchase an airplane ticket to Mexico after he murdered his family.
Thieves can also get your credit card information through muggings or mail 
theft. Although this method is less common than it was five years ago, law 
enforcement still deals with organized groups that steal mail from mailboxes, 
looking for credit cards or credit card applications to exploit. Often, ring lead­
ers pay the street-level thieves with drugs and use the credit card informa­
tion to buy goods for themselves.
Most states have laws that specifically punish identity theft. These laws often 
carry greater punishment than other theft laws — including prison time.
Overcoming identity theft
If you’re the victim of identity theft, you should 
follow these steps:
	 1.	 Place a fraud alert on your credit report. 
This alert warns other creditors to check 
your identity before opening any new credit 
accounts in your name.
	 2.	 Review your credit report. You have the 
right to a free review of your credit report 
from the following three agencies that track 
credit: Equifax (www.equifax.com), 
Experian (www.experian.com), and 
TransUnion (www.transunion.com). 
Even if your identity hasn’t been stolen, fol­
lowing this step is a good way to stay on top 
of your credit history and to correct errors 
when they occur.
	
	 Know that you’re liable for only up to $50 
of any credit card fraud if you review your 
credit card statement in a timely fashion 
and notify the credit provider of any errors.
	 3.	 Request that the three companies that main­
tain credit reports remove any records of 
fraudulent transactions from your report.

tion to check out is http://www.ftc.gov/

 Chapter 6: Hitting You in the Pocketbook: Property Crimes
Identity theft is one of the most widespread crimes in the world. A 2005 
survey by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported that in one year, 
8.3 million American adults were victims of identity theft. The most common 
complaints to the FTC in 2005 were the following:
 
✓ Foreign money offers (such as the Nigerian scam)
 
✓ Prizes, sweepstakes, and lotteries
 
✓ Internet auctions
 
✓ Shop-at-home/catalog sales
 
✓ Telephone services
 
✓ Work-at-home offers
Stealing autos
Since the U.S. government started keeping auto theft statistics in 1973, 
they’ve never been lower than they are today, at about 8 thefts per 1,000 
households each year. (See Figure 6-1, which shows data from the U.S. Bureau 
of Justice Statistics.)
Despite this downtrend, however, the stats still represent about 1.2 million 
stolen cars each year, with a total value of about $8 billion.
People steal autos for a variety of reasons, including the following:
 
✓ To go for a joy ride
 
✓ To sell the auto in another country (often Mexico)
 
✓ To strip the vehicle for parts, which the thief then sells domestically or 
overseas
 
✓ To use the auto in the commission of another crime, such as a bank rob­
bery or a drive-by shooting
Many people have an interest in car theft rates, given that a car is the second 
most expensive item most people own (the first being a home). For one thing, 
the higher the frequency of car theft in your neighborhood, the higher your 
auto insurance rate is going to be.
Today ever-improving technology means that fewer cars are being stolen and 
more stolen cars are being recovered than ever before. For example, many 
cars (including most rental cars) are equipped with global positioning system 
(GPS) devices that track the exact locations of the vehicles.

 Chapter 6: Hitting You in the Pocketbook: Property Crimes
Breaking and entering: Burglary
Burglary is the unlawful entering of a home or building to commit a crime 
therein. An unlawful entry means the person doesn’t have permission or 
authority to enter — similar to the crime of trespassing. But what distinguishes 
a trespass from a burglary is that burglary includes the intent to commit 
another crime in the building. Normally people think of this secondary crime 
as theft: A person breaks into a home to steal jewelry, for example. However, a 
person who breaks into a house to commit a rape is also committing burglary.
In most states, the severity of punishment for burglary depends on several 
factors:
 
✓ Was the building a home (as opposed to an office building, for example)?
 
✓ If the building was a home, did the burglary happen at night (when resi­
dents may have been home)?
 
✓ Was anyone present at the time of the burglary?
 
✓ Did the burglar forcibly enter the building?
 
✓ Did the burglar have a weapon when he entered the building?
A burglary that includes all these factors — armed burglary that involves kick­
ing in the door of an occupied dwelling at night — is the most serious type 
of burglary because it’s most likely to result in violent harm to the victims. In 
most states, burglary with these elements results in a lengthy prison sentence.
The number of burglaries in the United States has been decreasing since 
1974, although the decrease did level out in about 2001. Figure 6-2 demon­
strates this decrease, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics.

Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Professional criminals are much more likely to engage in burglary (and per­
haps Internet fraud) than any other crimes. (By professional, I don’t mean 
that the burglars wear coats and ties. Rather, they develop special burglary 
skills and commit repeated crimes, almost as if burglary is their job.) But 
more commonly, burglars are juveniles or people in their 20s who are seeking 
thrills or looking for money to buy their next drug or alcohol fix. Nonetheless, 
burglary can be a more challenging crime than shoplifting because it requires 
planning the entry in advance, targeting specific locations, and finding a 
market in which to sell the stolen goods.
	
You may assume that most burglars focus on homes, but, these days, bur­
glars increasingly target retail establishments because they can lawfully 
visit the stores during the day, identify the locations of high-value items, and 
then return at night. Pharmacies, in particular, have become popular targets 
because burglars can easily sell (or use) prescription drugs. Burglars more 
commonly commit retail or office burglaries at night when the business is 
closed, but they more commonly commit residential burglaries during the day 
when residents are at work.
How does a burglar dispose of his ill-gotten gains? Historically, middlemen 
operated fencing operations. A fence would buy stolen items for a huge dis­
count and then resell those items. Today, fences still exist, but burglars now 
have new ways to sell their goods. Internet sites, such as eBay and craigslist, 
are chock full of stolen items. Burglars also sell items to friends, family mem­
bers, or pawn shops; some even exchange stolen items directly for drugs.
A burglar skilled in his trade may commit a hundred acts before being caught. 
And because the punishment for property crimes is typically mild, a person may 
spend several years as a burglar before he does any significant time behind bars.
Committing outdoor property theft
Commodity and metal theft has become a significant problem across the 
United States. Drug users, for instance, steal metal items, such as copper 
piping from buildings, and then sell them for scrap to get drug money. And 
highways in Hawaii are often in the dark because thieves repeatedly steal 
the wiring for the street lights. The cost to replace the wiring may be tens of 
thousands of dollars for the community. Ironically, the thief sells the wiring 
for $100 or less to buy drugs.
Construction materials and tools are frequent targets, too, because they’re 
often left outside without any security. Some states have responded by pass­
ing laws requiring scrap metal dealers to record identify information from the 
people who sell them the metal.

87
 Chapter 6: Hitting You in the Pocketbook: Property Crimes
Defining Property Damage
Property crime includes more than just theft; it also includes property 
damage. Two of the more common crimes involving property damage are 
arson and vandalism.
Committing arson
Arson typically refers to the intentional burning of a home, building, vehicle, 
aircraft, or personal property of another. In 2007, police agencies reported 
64,332 arsons to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The average dollar 
loss per arson event was $17,289.
People commit arson for many reasons, including the following:
 
✓ To collect insurance money
 
✓ To strike back at employers, ex-spouses, or business competitors
 
✓ To get perverse pleasure from burning things (which is a reason why 
emotionally disturbed juveniles or adults start fires)
 
✓ To cover up evidence of additional crimes
In the western United States, wildfires are a significant problem every 
summer, requiring thousands of firefighters and millions of dollars to put 
them out. Mounting evidence suggests that significant numbers of these fires 
are started intentionally by people — some of whom seek work fighting the 
very fires they start. (Of course, lightning strikes and careless humans start 
many wildfires, too.)
Police face daunting challenges in proving the crime of arson. After all, the 
fire destroys most of the evidence. Nonetheless, arson investigators, many 
of whom work for fire departments, are skilled at identifying the causes of 
fires. Arson investigators talk to the firemen who first arrived at the scene to 
find out whether they detected any clues about where the fire started, how it 
progressed, or what color the smoke was. Investigators can often detect the 
location where a fire originated because of evidence of the use of accelerants, 
such as gasoline-soaked rags or lighter fluid. Similarly, investigators look for 
signs of forced entry by the arsonist or even tampering with fire suppression 
systems. And, of course, the presence of a motive, such as burning a business 
that’s failing, can be an important clue that eventually leads police to the 
arsonist who started the fire.

88
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Vandalizing property
Some people don’t choose to use violence to get back at someone else. 
Instead, they decide to damage the other person’s property, a crime called 
vandalism. Perhaps the most common form of vandalism is graffiti (also 
known as tagging when committed by a street gang to mark its territory).
But vandalism also includes other damaging actions, such as breaking the 
windows of businesses or homes. For example, I once prosecuted a man for 
breaking the windshield of his girlfriend’s car because he thought she was 
seeing another man. (In case you’re curious, she wasn’t.)
How vandalism is punished usually depends on the dollar value of the damage 
that was committed. If you throw a rock through your ex-girlfriend’s window, 
you’ll probably just be charged with a misdemeanor. But if you key someone’s 
Maserati (meaning you used your key to significantly scratch the car’s expen­
sive paint job), you may be prosecuted for a more serious felony crime.
Looking at the Causes of Property Crime
You may be wondering, why do people steal or commit burglaries? Well, there 
are many reasons, but here I address some of the most common ones.
Wrestling with drug addiction
	
I can’t emphasize enough that drugs (including alcohol) are the primary moti­
vation behind all crime, including property crime. People who develop addic­
tions have trouble holding jobs. As a result, they’re frequently unemployed or 
underemployed. But they still need money to feed their drug habits, as well as 
to pay for food and shelter — many of them resort to financial property crime 
to do so.
The criminal justice system is full of property crime offenders with substance 
abuse problems. These offenders frequently cycle through the system in a 
pattern similar to the following:
	
1.	 A person begins using drugs (or alcohol) and develops an addiction.
	
2.	 The person buys drugs, perhaps sells drugs, and commits property 
crimes to pay for drugs.
	
3.	 Eventually, the person is arrested for a drug or property crime.

89
 Chapter 6: Hitting You in the Pocketbook: Property Crimes
	
4.	 The person may do a little jail time, or none at all, depending on the 
crime.
	
5.	 If the court becomes aware that the crime was related to drugs (which 
doesn’t always happen with property crimes), the court may order the 
offender to go through a drug treatment program as a condition of 
probation.
	
6.	 After getting out of jail (if the court included jail time in the sentence), 
the person again begins using drugs (because the person is an addict).
	
7.	 The person commits more property crimes to pay for drugs, and the 
cycle continues.
Breaking this cycle has become a significant challenge for policymakers, but 
they usually rely on two major approaches: focusing on drug treatment and 
locking up repeat offenders. Both approaches have some major drawbacks.
Focusing on drug treatment
Drug treatment programs are significantly underfunded in most parts of the 
country. And no single drug treatment plan works for all drugs. For example, 
treating marijuana addiction is significantly different from treating metham­
phetamine addiction.
In addition, oversight and evaluation of treatment programs is lax, which 
means that ineffective court-ordered treatment programs can continue to 
operate for years, doing little good and draining already-sparse funds. Of 
course, oversight costs money, and the truth is that it’s very difficult to 
know what makes a good treatment program. Perhaps the most significant 
challenge to drug treatment, however, is that you can’t treat someone who 
doesn’t want to be treated. Frequently, drug users enjoy the partying lifestyle, 
and they’re not willing to commit to overcoming their addictions until they 
have cycled through the justice system many times.
Politicians who philosophically oppose punishment often adopt a “treatment” 
mantra without committing resources to identifying good programs, evaluating 
existing programs, or developing strategies for treating people who are unwill­
ing to be treated. Fortunately, some states are committing resources to identi­
fying effective treatment programs, and, as the science of addiction develops, 
you’re likely to see much improvement in the coming years.
Locking up offenders
A movement to put property criminals in prison when they repeatedly commit 
crimes has swept across the country. But putting a person in prison costs a 
lot of money. According to a study by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the 
cost of housing an inmate in a state prison in 2001 averaged $22,650 a year, or 

90
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
$62 a day. This amount doesn’t include the societal loss of a person who isn’t 
being productive in a job or paying taxes (assuming the person can be effec­
tively treated for drug addiction and can hold a steady job).
Also, criminals serving time in prison are surrounded by a criminal culture 
that may teach them how to be more effective criminals in the future. This 
fact places them at high risk for recidivism — being sent back to prison after 
they’re released.
One reason why some policymakers push to lock property criminals up is to 
make sure they can’t commit more crimes while they serve their sentences. 
(For a discussion of the different theories of incarceration, see Chapter 21.) 
However, studies have shown that the dollar cost to society of reoffending 
property criminals is much less than the cost of reoffending violent criminals. 
In fact, some people argue that locking up property criminals costs more 
than what society saves by preventing their future crimes.
The treatment versus prison debate is one of the most significant public 
safety policy debates in every state. Most states settle on some combination 
of the two when dealing with property criminals.
Making a career choice
When your second-grade teacher asked you what you wanted to be when you 
grew up, I bet you didn’t say, “I want to be a professional burglar.” As a matter 
of fact, very few people who commit crimes end up as career criminals.
Property criminals are typically juveniles or people in their 20s who don’t 
really view themselves as criminals. They may occasionally shoplift, forge 
a check, or tag a fence (in other words, spray paint graffiti), but generally 
they get along in society without causing serious harm. As they get older and 
punishment grows more severe for each subsequent offense, most low-level 
property offenders set aside their antisocial ways (often with the help of drug 
treatment) and conform to the law.
However, a very small subset of people continues committing crimes through­
out their entire lives. I’ve seen criminals with more than 60 arrests — men 
in their fifties who don’t know any other way to live. When they’re hungry 
and don’t have money, they shoplift food. They think nothing of burglarizing 
a house when they want something they can’t afford. Often, these offenders 
have serious drug or alcohol problems, as well.
Beyond these low-level career criminals is an extremely small group of pro­
fessional criminals, who are glorified in movies such as To Catch a Thief and

 Chapter 6: Hitting You in the Pocketbook: Property Crimes
The Thomas Crown Affair. These professional burglars may develop special 
skills for identifying good targets, entering buildings, and selling stolen 
goods, but rarely do they look like Cary Grant or end up with Grace Kelly.
Being drawn to bright and shiny objects
In today’s commercialized society, where advertisements constantly badger 
people to buy the newest toy or gadget, the temptation to have these shiny, 
new objects becomes too great for many people. They may not be able to 
afford the most decked-out iPods or the latest fashionable purses, but they 
want them so badly that they succumb to their impulsive feelings and steal 
them. These offenders don’t typically view themselves as criminals, and they 
rationalize their conduct to themselves in a variety of ways. For example, a 
shoplifter may think stealing jewelry from a particular store is okay because 
the store makes a lot of money; plus, she has paid for many other items 
there. This kind of thievery may continue until these offenders are caught, 
but then they typically reform their ways and stay out of the criminal justice 
system in the future.
Battling kleptomania
A few people suffer from a mental disorder, known as kleptomania, which 
means they can’t control the temptation to steal. They get great satisfaction 
and pleasure from the act of stealing, regardless of what they steal. This dis­
order explains why some very wealthy people get caught shoplifting. Being 
caught or even doing jail time doesn’t dissuade people with kleptomania from 
stealing again, so treatment by a mental health professional is the only real 
solution.

hat does a person’s shirt color have to do with crime? In the 1930s, 
highly regarded criminologist Edwin Sutherland coined the term 
white-collar crime to refer to crime committed by someone of “respectability 
and high social status in the course of his occupation.” (Of course, blue-collar 
is a shorthand way of referring to people whose jobs involve physical labor.)
Criminologists devote significant effort to studying white-collar crime 
because doing so highlights the distinction in the criminal justice system 
between the haves and the have-nots. In this chapter, I explain what white-
collar crime is, touch on the challenges of investigating and prosecuting this 
type of crime, and explore some of the controversy surrounding the punish­
ment phase of white-collar trials.
Identifying Types of White-Collar Crime
White-collar crime has changed somewhat since the 1930s. And while crimi­
nologists and others debated a precise definition, the National White Collar 
Crime Center (NW3C) — a nonprofit corporation that Congress set up to help 
police departments investigate such crimes — came up with a pretty good 
one. According to the NW3C, white-collar crimes are
Illegal or unethical acts that violate fiduciary responsibility or public trust for 
personal or organizational gain

94
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
This definition is broad, but it basically means that people in business or gov­
ernment who violate a trust for their own gain or for their business’s gain are 
white-collar criminals.
How much white-collar crime is committed? Because the types of white-collar 
crime are so varied, I can’t quote any good statistics to help you gauge how 
widespread the problem is. But because white-collar crime frequently results 
in the loss of millions of dollars, you need only a few cases to see that white-
collar crime is a big problem. And you need only to scan the news to see 
frequent examples of misconduct by corporations, politicians, and wealthy 
people in society. In the sections that follow, I discuss some of the more 
common examples of white-collar crime.
Stealing from the boss: Embezzlement
In a nutshell, embezzlement is the act of stealing from your employer. Some 
people may debate whether embezzlement can really be considered a white-
collar crime because it occurs so widely across the socioeconomic spectrum. 
Most commonly, embezzlement occurs when retail employees steal cash or 
merchandise. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that 75 percent of 
all employees have stolen from an employer at least once. And the National 
Retail Federation estimates that, in 2006, the amount of employee theft 
exceeded $19 billion — just among retail businesses!
But classic embezzlement goes far beyond just dipping into the till. 
Employees with special access to money, and in a position of trust, can sys­
tematically steal from their employers for years without being caught. For 
instance, a city finance director may divert a small amount of money every 
week into an innocuous-looking account, thus escaping the auditor’s notice. 
But after five years, that director has embezzled over $1 million! Examples 
like this one are common in both the government and the private sector. In 
private companies, however, employers often don’t report these crimes to 
police because they fear that disclosure may spook clients or customers and 
be a source of embarrassment.
Why do people violate the trust of their employers in this way? Sometimes 
they steal simply because they want to buy more stuff than they can afford 
with their legitimate salaries. But frequently, embezzlement follows this pattern:
	
✓ An employee has a significant financial problem.
 
✓ Intending to pay the money back, the employee takes the money as 
a loan.
 
✓ The loan quickly grows too big, and the embezzler can’t repay it.

95
 Chapter 7: Dressing Sharp and Stealing Big: White-Collar Crimes
The legalization of gambling over the last 30 years — and the gambling addic­
tions that have resulted — may have led to an increase in embezzlements. 
Also, as advertisers put greater pressure on people to have the latest and 
greatest products, more people succumb to this pressure, become shopahol­
ics, run up their credit card debts, and then steal from their employers to bail 
themselves out.
In the 20th century, some criminologists identified middle-aged men as the 
most likely embezzlers. But today, in the 21st century, a significant number 
of embezzlement cases reported to the police involve middle-aged women. 
Perhaps this change reflects the greater role that women play in the modern 
workforce.
Evading taxes
You just can’t avoid taxes — at least not lawfully. Everyone in the United 
States pays income taxes, sales taxes, estate taxes, employment taxes, 
tobacco taxes, alcohol taxes . . . and the list goes on. All levels of government 
collect taxes: local, state, and federal. So the opportunity for individuals and 
corporations to cheat on taxes is great.
In 2007, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) found 37,566,699 federal tax viola­
tions and issued over $29 billion in civil penalties. But that same year, the IRS 
initiated only 4,211 criminal investigations, mainly because the vast majority 
of tax-cheating violations are handled through civil fines and not through 
criminal investigations. Why? Well, for one, the IRS has only 2,800 special 
agents who at the most could only investigate a fraction of all those viola­
tions in a year. (Tax investigations are usually very complex.) Also, criminal 
investigations aren’t a cost-effective way to collect money. Finding an error 
in a tax form and simply issuing a fine is much easier than having a special 
agent try to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person intentionally cheated 
on her taxes. (For a more complete discussion of the difference between the civil 
justice system and the criminal justice system, see Chapter 2.)
Intentionally evading or defeating a tax is a federal felony. So, technically, 
each time a waiter purposely chooses not to report her tips as income, she’s 
committing a federal felony. But the IRS usually saves criminal investigation 
and prosecution for the most egregious acts — the ones involving large dollar 
figures or blatant and repeated flaunting of the law.
	
If there was no possibility of a serious sanction, including prison time, many 
people would just ignore their tax obligations. The occasional high-profile 
prosecution serves as a deterrent, persuading people to pay their taxes rather 
than risk being arrested.

Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Selling phony investments: 
Securities fraud
In a capitalist system, the financial investment business provides a great 
opportunity for criminal exploitation, namely in the form of securities fraud, 
which, in its most simplistic sense, is the act of lying to get someone to make 
an investment. The list of potential fraud scams is limitless. However, some 
scams are more common than others. Selling stock in a phony company, for 
example, is one form of securities fraud.
	
I once investigated a man who bilked numerous investors by telling them he 
had created a sports nutrition bar. Investors gave him a total of over $1 mil­
lion, which he used to travel around the country, visiting professional athletic 
events as part of a “marketing tour.” He never manufactured any sports bars, 
and, as a result, he eventually went to prison.
Lying about the value of a business can also constitute securities fraud if 
the guilty party does so to induce people to invest in that business. At the 
individual level, this crime can involve a restaurant entrepreneur who lies 
to investors by telling them that her new chef is a highly regarded graduate 
of the Cordon Bleu school in France when he’s never even been to France. 
On a larger scale, a corporation may manipulate the market by overstating 
earnings, which, in turn, may lead investors to believe the company is worth 
more than it really is.
Insider trading is another form of securities fraud. People with inside informa­
tion about a company (stuff the public doesn’t know about) aren’t allowed to 
benefit from that information before the rest of the public can do so.
Most famously, Martha Stewart went to prison after she sold $230,000 worth 
of ImClone stock after ImClone executives leaked secret inside information to 
a few people that one of its experimental drugs was disapproved by the Food 
and Drug Administration. Stewart’s conviction stemmed from obstructing 
justice and lying about her stock sale. The ImClone founder was convicted of 
securities fraud.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigates significant 
corporate securities fraud and has the ability to allege civil violations and 
settle them with monetary penalties and other civil sanctions. Often these 
settlements include no admission of wrongdoing by the offender. For exam­
ple, the former CEO of United Health Group, Inc., was accused of backdating 
documents that set stock option dates to coincide with low prices. Although 
he didn’t admit wrongdoing, he paid a $7 million penalty and agreed not to 
serve as a corporate officer or director for ten years.
The enforcement division of the SEC has about 1,200 employees and brought 671 
enforcement actions in 2008. Given the hundreds of thousands of corporations 

97
 Chapter 7: Dressing Sharp and Stealing Big: White-Collar Crimes
that exist in the United States, you can see that corporate misconduct and 
securities violations have relatively little government oversight compared 
to other crimes, although it’s worth noting that individual states often have 
their own agencies to investigate local securities fraud.
Dumping waste and endangering 
employees: Environmental crime
Almost every manufacturer creates some form of waste, and the temptation 
is great to cut corners and costs by illegally disposing of it. At the local level, 
thousands of different businesses must dispose of toxic chemicals.
For example, auto body shops have large amounts of chemical waste that are 
quite expensive to dispose of properly. And fish-processing plants produce 
millions of gallons of water containing fish guts when they clean their equip­
ment; if these plants pump this water back into estuaries without filtering it, 
it can create algae blooms, deplete oxygen, and kill the streams’ inhabitants.
The regulation of toxic materials and waste is extremely complex. At the fed­
eral level, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by Richard 
Nixon in 1970, has the authority to punish polluters. Most states have simi­
lar agencies to help protect the environment. At both the federal and state 
levels, most enforcement action takes place with civil fines and injunctions 
(court orders demanding that the illegal activity be stopped).
In 2008, the EPA Criminal Investigations Division opened 319 new cases. The EPA 
doesn’t report the number of convictions in a given year, but it did report that, 
for all convictions for federal environmental crimes in 2008, the total number of 
years in prison was 57. This number seems extremely low for the entire United 
States, but keep in mind that EPA special agents sometimes participate in task 
forces with local and state law enforcement to try to maximize their resources. 
As a result, prosecutions for environmental crimes may occur in state courts 
rather than federal courts. Even so, in many states, the criminal enforcement of 
environmental laws lags far behind the enforcement of other crimes.
Other environmental misconduct occurs when companies fail to take pre­
cautions to protect employees from unsafe conditions, including exposure 
to chemicals. Companies may choose not to take these safety precautions 
because taking them can be expensive and can hurt the bottom line. Safety 
violations aren’t usually treated as crimes but, instead, are regulated by a 
federal agency known as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) and by similar state agencies. OSHA typically issues fines and injunc­
tions for safety violations and doesn’t pursue criminal punishment.
For example, if an employee of a commercial landscaper believes that he’s 
being overexposed to pesticides, he can make a complaint to his state OSHA, 

98
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
which may respond with an inspection or investigation. Unfortunately, how­
ever, employees aren’t always aware of the dangers they face on the job, so 
the misconduct goes unreported. For example, a car painter may use an old, 
ineffective respirator from his employer. That employee may never realize 
that his health is being put at risk to save his company a little bit of money.
Cheating business and service clients
The part of the economy that involves business services for clients is so 
large that the fact that it’s an area ripe for exploitation by white-collar crimi­
nals is no surprise. For example, doctors and dentists may systematically 
overcharge patients or bilk Medicaid, Medicare, or other insurance providers 
to make some extra money for themselves.
	
I’ve seen professional tax preparers take advantage of immigrant communities 
by creating phony tax credits and then having the money from the tax returns 
deposited with the preparer. I also know of a lawyer who once billed clients for 
more than 24 hours in a single day. (Yes, a dishonest lawyer — shocking!)
But despite being widespread, client fraud is difficult to prosecute. For one 
thing, clients often don’t know they’re being cheated. And if they do catch the 
fraud and confront the perpetrator, they may get their money back and chalk 
the whole thing up to a mistake, not knowing about all the other people who 
were also cheated.
When people do report such fraud, police are often hesitant to get involved. 
Proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a client was intentionally cheated — 
and not just the victim of a mistake — is very difficult. Police and prosecu­
tors often explain why they refuse to begin such investigations by saying, “It’s 
a civil dispute.”
Cheating consumers: False advertising 
and price fixing
In the competitive business world, people sometimes resort to false adver­
tising or other deceptive practices that defraud thousands of consumers to 
make a quick buck.
	
For example, you may have seen TV ads depicting a character known as 
“Smilin’ Bob.” Bob’s constant smile implied that he had achieved some level 
of male enhancement by taking a supplement known as Enzyte, which, in 
fact, didn’t provide any male enhancement. In 2008, federal prosecutors 
in Cincinnati, Ohio, convicted corporate officials from Berkeley Premium 

99
 Chapter 7: Dressing Sharp and Stealing Big: White-Collar Crimes
Nutraceuticals, the company that produced and advertised Enzyte, of mail 
fraud and money laundering. The founder of the company was sentenced to 25 
years in prison, and the company was ordered to forfeit $500 million.
The government frequently deals with false advertising matters through 
civil suits under a set of laws known as the Unfair Trade Practice Act. But 
Smilin’ Bob had such a ubiquitous presence on TV that federal prosecutors 
made Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals a criminal case — and a high-profile 
example.
Another criminal corporate practice is price fixing, which occurs when dif­
ferent corporations selling a product secretly agree to sell the product for 
an inflated price. Federal and state governments often deal with price fixing 
through civil antitrust lawsuits. But sometimes corporations are prosecuted 
criminally. Antitrust laws are meant to keep a corporation or a group of cor­
porations from having a monopoly over a certain product.
In 2008, for example, the U.S. Department of Justice convicted Sharp Corp., 
LG Display Company, and some other businesses of conspiring to fix the 
prices of LCD panels. These companies secretly agreed among themselves to 
keep prices artificially high on LCD televisions and other electronic products, 
cheating consumers in the process. LG Display Company had to pay a crimi­
nal fine of $400 million, and Sharp Corp. had to pay $120 million. In total, this 
case produced the second-largest criminal antitrust fine ever obtained by 
the U.S. Department of Justice. A vice president of LG was also sentenced to 
seven months in jail.
Mixing politics and crime
A governor accused of selling a senate seat. A mayor accused of accepting 
bribes in exchange for steering a city’s business to friends. The headlines 
these days are full of allegations of government corruption. And high-profile 
elected officials aren’t the only ones committing crime. Even lower-level gov­
ernment employees get wrapped up in criminal activity.
	
Here’s just one recent example: The attorney general of Florida convicted cor­
porate officials from Stone Cold Chemicals, Inc., a cleaning supply business, of 
criminal racketeering (a law originally designed to attack organized crime) for 
developing a business plan that targeted low-level government employees and 
encouraged them to purchase the company’s cleaning products. In exchange 
for buying the cleaning products at inflated prices, the low-level government 
employees received pro-sports merchandise and restaurant gift certificates. 
The scam reached across the nation and resulted in charges of bribe receiving 
against jailers, janitors, transportation workers, and other low-level govern­
ment employees.

100
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Ideally, a government official accused of crime is treated like any other citi­
zen and is investigated by the local police. Frequently, however, the potential 
impact of media and politics means that high-profile cases receive different 
treatment.
For example, a city police department probably wouldn’t investigate the 
city’s mayor (because she exercises authority over the department budget 
and could retaliate, among other reasons). So the chief of police would ask an 
outside law enforcement agency from another county, from the state govern­
ment, or even from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to conduct the 
investigation. And with intense media scrutiny, investigators must be sure to 
track down every lead, no matter how improbable, because some reporter is 
likely waiting to criticize the investigation when it’s complete.
The Challenges of Investigating 
White-Collar Crime
The vast majority of police are equipped to deal with traditional crime, such 
as violent acts and property crime. They respond to 9-1-1 calls and enforce 
traffic laws. But police often lack the primary tools that are necessary to 
tackle white-collar crime — time and expertise.
Committing white-collar crime: Why do it?
Criminologists have come up with several 
theories for why respectable businesspeople 
resort to crime. As I mention in this chapter, 
some people get themselves in personal finan­
cial binds and “borrow” from their employers 
until their borrowing reaches such levels that 
they can never repay their debts. Compulsive 
gamblers and shoppers, as well as people with 
overly expensive lifestyles, may fit this category.
A second theory holds that the competitive 
nature of corporate life itself turns some people 
into criminals. The corporate need to maximize 
profits and the intense pressure to move up the 
company ladder can lead some employees to 
cut corners or otherwise commit crimes. Doing 
so allows the perpetrators to receive social 
rewards, including bonuses and promotions. 
Ironically, negative conduct is rewarded.
A third theory holds that white-collar criminals 
are just like street criminals, only in a different 
environment. Some criminologists believe that 
what drives many criminals is laziness com­
bined with a desire for finer things. White-collar 
criminals want to achieve greater social status 
and higher salaries from business success, but 
they don’t want to work hard for these results. 
So they follow the easy road and cheat.
I think each of these theories — or a combina­
tion of them — provides a legitimate explana­
tion for why otherwise respectable people turn 
into white-collar criminals.

101
 Chapter 7: Dressing Sharp and Stealing Big: White-Collar Crimes
Measuring the costs (in time and money)
White-collar crime is expensive to investigate. Consider this example: 
Investigating a robbery may involve interviewing a few witnesses and writ-
ing a police report, nothing too time-consuming. On the other hand, investi­
gating even a simple embezzlement from a small business can involve a 
lot more work and, thus, a lot more time. Like with a robbery, the detective 
must interview the business’s owner and all witnesses, of course. But he 
must also obtain copies of all relevant financial records and do a thorough 
analysis of those records. This process is slow, and, in law enforcement, 
time is money.
	
A police chief has only a finite number of detectives to handle all significant 
cases, so he’s necessarily hesitant to devote one detective to a long-term 
financial case. Unfortunately, what often happens is that the detective simply 
declines to take the case, using the most common cop-out in law enforcement: 
“It sounds like a civil matter.” Police use this phrase when the victim may have 
a chance at a remedy through a civil lawsuit and when the case seems too 
time-consuming and difficult to investigate and prosecute in a criminal court.
Facing a dearth of financial investigators
	
Probably the greatest impediment to attacking white-collar crime is the lack 
of cops qualified to conduct financial investigations. If an officer doesn’t know 
how to manage a spreadsheet or doesn’t know how to put basic accounting 
principles to use, trying to figure out a financial crime is next to impossible. 
Without any financial experience, an officer could spend six months staring at 
a box of financial records and never prove the case.
Why saying “It’s a civil matter” 
isn’t necessarily a cop-out
Although almost every crime could also be the 
basis for a civil suit — a victim of a criminal 
assault can also choose to sue the perpetra­
tor, for example — sometimes a cop’s decision 
to decline to investigate a matter as a crime 
because “it’s a civil matter” makes sense. What 
the cop’s really doing, although he may not 
know it, is conducting a cost/benefit analysis — 
weighing the likely success of an investigation 
along with the likely punishment to be achieved 
against the hours and expenses of conducting 
the investigation. Police agencies conduct this 
type of analysis all the time.

102
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
For this reason, as I explain in Chapter 17, many police departments greatly 
value IRS special agents. The special agents are trained in conducting finan­
cial investigations, which are often essential in proving white-collar crimes. 
However, the IRS has only 2,800 special agents for the whole United States, 
and their primary mission is tax enforcement.
The FBI has made white-collar crime its seventh priority (see Chapter 17 for 
the FBI’s other priorities) and devotes considerable resources to the fight, 
but the bureau can take on only the most significant cases. Some large police 
departments or state agencies may have a couple of trained financial detec­
tives, and a few other courageous detectives take on financial cases and try 
to figure them out as they go, despite not having any financial expertise. But 
all too often, law enforcement agencies and departments just can’t investi­
gate mid- to low-level white-collar crimes because they lack human resources.
Prosecuting and Punishing 
White-Collar Crime
If investigating white-collar crimes is tough, prosecuting the offenders is no walk 
in the park, either. Criminal cases involving white-collar crimes are often more 
complicated, more expensive, and more difficult to win than criminal cases 
involving violent crimes. In this section, I explain why. I also discuss why white-
collar convictions often carry lighter sentences than other types of crime.
Equating good suits with good verdicts
Most criminal defendants can’t afford to hire their own lawyers, so they 
receive court-appointed public defenders. I’ve known some very good public 
defenders, but, generally, you get what you pay for.
White-collar defendants, on the other hand, can usually afford to hire expen­
sive lawyers with their own money. These defendants hire not only good law­
yers but also private investigators and experts to testify on their behalf. So 
what may start out as a relatively simple prosecution can quickly turn into a 
battle against a large (and talented) defense team.
	
If a corporation or multiple defendants are involved, the complexity of the 
trial can grow quickly. For example, I once investigated a corporation for tax 
fraud and theft, among other crimes. The corporation quickly hired the state’s 
best criminal defense lawyers to represent six different corporate employees, 

103
 Chapter 7: Dressing Sharp and Stealing Big: White-Collar Crimes
each of whom immediately asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-
incrimination. Although ultimately I could prove misconduct by the corpora­
tion itself, I couldn’t hold any individual employees accountable because none 
of them would talk.
Testing the limits of corporate liability
Although individuals commit crimes, corporations can often be prosecuted in 
criminal cases. A corporation is a legal fiction — something created by law — 
but, in most jurisdictions, it can be prosecuted as a criminal defendant.
For a corporation to be held liable for a criminal action, a prosecutor usually 
has to prove criminal conduct by a corporate officer or a high-level manager. 
Take a case of toxic waste dumping. A dump site may have a barrel with 
“Acme, Inc.” written on it, but unless the police can prove that a manager at 
Acme, Inc., ordered the waste dumping — in other words, that he intended 
to commit the crime — proving corporate criminal liability (at least in state 
court) can be difficult. (For a more thorough discussion of the need to prove 
intent in a criminal case, see Chapter 2.)
Proving a criminal case against a corporation can be challenging and expen­
sive. For this reason, most corporate misconduct is regulated by civil or 
administrative law rather than criminal law.
Regulating businesses
Because of the difficulty of proving criminal 
cases against businesses or corporations, gov­
ernments tend to rely on other means of regula­
tion. For example, to regulate Wall Street and 
the securities business, the government has 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
The SEC doesn’t have criminal authority — 
which means it can’t arrest someone for a 
crime — but it can investigate and file civil suits 
against corporations for misconduct.
As you may know, in a criminal case, a pros­
ecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt 
that the defendant committed the crime; on the 
other hand, in a civil suit, the plaintiff must only 
prove by a preponderance of the evidence (in 
other words, that it’s more likely than not) that 
the defendant engaged in misconduct. Because 
the SEC files only civil suits, the SEC can more 
easily prove misconduct by corporations in civil 
suits and force settlements that bring financial 
punishment along with corrective action.
Corporate interests are powerful, however. Big 
businesses lobby hard to protect their interests, 
sometimes by controlling or reducing the bud­
gets and resources of the very agencies that 
have regulatory authority.

104
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Making punishments fit the crimes
In 2006, former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling was convicted of securities fraud 
and conspiracy, among other charges, and was sentenced to over 24 years 
in prison. (You didn’t think I could talk about white-collar crime without 
mentioning Enron, did you?) For many people in the corporate world, this 
case was a signal event, marking a change in historic sentencing practices for 
white-collar criminals.
	
Previously, most people probably believed that the more common treatment 
of white-collar criminals resembled what Martha Stewart received for her 
convictions in 2004: five months in a federal “country club” and five months of 
home detention.
This common viewpoint is important because one significant reason why 
society imprisons criminals is to deter other people from committing simi­
lar crimes. (For a more detailed discussion of theories of punishment, see 
Chapter 21.) If the risk of serious punishment isn’t real, people may be more 
likely to run the risk of conviction, especially when the payoff is millions of 
dollars in profit.
But there are legitimate reasons why white-collar criminals have received 
relatively light sentences in the past. Perhaps most importantly, such cases 
are often very difficult to prove. Sometimes law enforcement agencies make 
plea agreements to resolve cases instead of committing massive resources 
to lengthy and costly trials that may have uncertain outcomes. In addition, 
white-collar crimes often involve significant financial harm to victims, so 
prosecutors may be willing to negotiate away jail time in exchange for making 
the defendant pay money back to victims.
	
Sometimes the prosecutor doesn’t agree to a short jail sentence, but the judge 
imposes the sentence on her own. One significant theory of punishment holds 
that jail or prison should be reserved only for people too dangerous to remain 
in society. The argument goes that, because white-collar criminals usually 
commit financial crimes, society shouldn’t spend a lot of money incarcerat­
ing them. Instead, jails should house people who are violent risks to society. 
Judges who subscribe to this theory may also believe that the damage to the 
professional reputation of a white-collar criminal is sufficient punishment in 
itself, without sentencing the criminal to a lengthy prison sentence.

any people are fascinated by pop-culture depictions of organized

how it truly impacts the world today. In this chapter, I discuss the various 
types of organized crime — including the mafia, street gangs, motorcycle 
gangs, and prison gangs — and I show you what they do. I also explain law 
enforcement’s efforts to combat this significant challenge.
Grasping the Basics of Organized Crime
Organized crime doesn’t refer to a group of criminal neat freaks who are 
so fastidious they segregate their socks by color. (In fact, organized crime 
figures are often very messy.) The phrase organized crime refers to groups 
of people who conspire together, generally, to make a business out of crime 
(although the attainment of power and companionship also plays a role).
	
Organized crime groups are usually hierarchical — in other words, they have 
leaders as well as low-level operatives — which means that when you arrest 
one member of the organization, the organization can replace that person and 
continue its “business” of crime. This structure is what makes organized crime 
so difficult to defeat.

106
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Another important feature of organized crime groups is how they resolve 
conflict. Many groups use violence or the threat of violence as their primary 
mechanism for resolving disputes. Think about it: If two lawful businesses 
have a dispute, one can sue the other in court. But if both businesses are ille­
gal, they can’t call attention to themselves with a legal battle.
Note: In defining organized crime, some criminologists require a formalized 
hierarchical structure with leaders, lieutenants, and soldiers. I believe this 
requirement is too limiting, restricting the label “organized crime” to the 
mafia model and excluding significant criminal businesses that may use inde­
pendent contractors or looser affiliations to commit crime.
Obsessing over the Italian Mafia
When you first read the title of this chapter, I bet you thought of some big 
Italian guys in suits — thanks to Hollywood’s obsession with the mafia. From 
Godfather Vito Corleone to Tony Soprano to “Fat Tony” from The Simpsons, 
the predominant media image of organized crime is the Italian Mafia.
In this section, I explore the birth of the original Mafia and the extent of its 
U.S. operations today.
Tracing the growth and decline 
of the Sicilian mob
In the 21st century, following decades of consistent law enforcement atten­
tion, the Mafia is in decline. Frankly, it’s a very small component of the 
overall organized crime problem in the United States today. Nonetheless, it 
continues to play a role in a few cities in the Northeast, Midwest, and South.
Historically, Italy was frequently the subject of invasions by outsiders. Secret 
societies formed among Italians to defend families and communities against 
the outsiders. These societies eventually became known as the Mafia. They 
turned into major organized crime entities in the early 20th century. Around 
the same time, a massive number of Italians, including mafiosa, immigrated 
to the United States. For more on the history of the mafia, you may want 
to check out Conspiracy Theories and Secret Societies For Dummies by 
Christopher Hodapp and Alice Von Kannon (Wiley).
At least four separate crime organizations with origins in Italy continue to be 
major criminal forces in Italy today. However, the Sicilian Mafia is the primary 
group that expanded into the United States, where it’s known as La Cosa 
Nostra (which translates “our thing”).

107
 Chapter 8: A Group Effort: Organized Crime and Gangs
La Cosa Nostra is organized in the United States by family groups. In the 
1940s, Charles “Lucky” Luciano (head of a major crime family in New York) 
helped end feuding between seven different families and organized them 
under a ruling body called the Commission, which ran La Cosa Nostra 
activities in the United States. At the Commission’s height, these activities 
included the following:
 
✓ Narcotics trafficking
 
✓ Gambling
 
✓ Cigarette smuggling
 
✓ Extortion
 
✓ Infiltration of legitimate businesses
 
✓ Violence to enforce each of these money-making operations
The FBI estimates that roughly 3,000 members of La Cosa Nostra still live 
and work in the United States today, predominantly in New Jersey, New York, 
Chicago, Detroit, New England, and eastern Pennsylvania.
La Cosa Nostra continues to be heavily involved in narcotics trafficking, 
extortion, and other money-making operations. However, its influence is 
decreasing. Most of the old-school family leaders have been put in prison or 
are now dead. Younger members don’t follow the strict code of silence that 
once forbade members from informing on others. Furthermore, the ethnic 
makeup of neighborhoods previously dominated by the Mafia has changed so 
that other ethnic organized crime groups exert more influence today.
Recognizing the Mafia’s 
impact on public policy
The rise of La Cosa Nostra led to the development of some significant crime-
fighting tools in the United States, such as the RICO laws. (RICO stands 
for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations.) These laws allow law 
enforcement to target an entire organization by making its members punish­
able for offenses committed to further the organization’s criminal activity.
For example, one guy is a lookout for street-corner drug deals for an organiza­
tion. Another guy commits several assaults to collect drug debts for the same 
organization. A third guy uses some of these illegal proceeds to buy stolen 
cars and then sells the parts overseas. All three men can be prosecuted for 
the crime of racketeering because their crimes are furthering the criminal 
interests of the organization. The crime of racketeering can carry a much 
stiffer sentence than the simple crimes of aiding in the sale of drugs, assault, 
money laundering, or auto theft.

108
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Congress passed the first RICO law in 1970, and many states enacted their 
own RICO laws thereafter. The goal was to respond aggressively to the chal­
lenges posed by the Mafia. Before these laws were passed, when an organized 
crime figure was arrested, another person simply took his place, and the 
organization continued on without missing a beat. Now, with much greater 
RICO sentences, the entire infrastructure of an organization can be locked up, 
which leaves no one to recruit replacements. I must note, however, that many 
in law enforcement are hesitant to pursue RICO investigations because the 
laws are complicated, and a good investigation can take a year or more.
Identifying Other Ethnic-Based 
Organized Crime Groups
Many organized crime groups in the United States are organized along ethnic 
or racial lines for reasons of community, trust, and security. For example, 
infiltrating a Vietnamese gang can be almost impossible for law enforce­
ment because few police speak Vietnamese and because members of the 
Vietnamese community tend to know everyone in their neighborhood.
Here are some of the ethnic organized crime groups that are most common in 
the United States:
 
✓ Russian organized crime: Calling this group Eurasian organized crime may 
be more accurate because it includes crime groups from Ukraine, Armenia, 
and other parts of the former Soviet Union. These groups are a dominant 
criminal presence in their home countries and, because of the Internet and 
the internationalization of commerce, now play a significant role in the 
United States. For example, these groups regularly use U.S. financial institu­
tions to launder criminal proceeds from their home countries.
Fighting a narrow view of organized crime
The popular image of the mafia as the orga­
nized crime threat in the United States has had 
a negative impact on law enforcement’s ability 
to attack other types of organized crime. As the 
former head of my state government’s organized 
crime unit, I repeatedly heard declarations like, 
“We don’t have organized crime in our state.” 
What these people (including public leaders) 
were actually saying was that they didn’t have 
the mafia, which was true.
But, like every other state, my state does have 
major drug traffickers, fraud rings, gangs, ille­
gal gambling, tobacco smuggling, extortion, 
and kidnapping — all perpetrated by non-Italian 
groups of organized criminals.

109
 Chapter 8: A Group Effort: Organized Crime and Gangs
	
	Russian organized crime is present on U.S. soil, but it’s not very involved in 
traditional organized crime, such as drugs and gambling. Instead, it’s involved 
in a broader array of crimes, such as credit card fraud, stock scams, auto 
theft, and healthcare fraud. Extortion among fellow Eurasians also occurs.
 
✓ Chinese Triad groups: These secret societies of Chinese had a signifi­
cant presence in Hong Kong in the 1960s and 1970s. They’re still active 
in China and a few major international cities, including San Francisco, 
Los Angeles, and New York in the United States. They’re involved in 
human smuggling, the manufacture and sale of counterfeit goods, soft­
ware piracy, narcotics trafficking, extortion, and tobacco smuggling.
 
✓ Chinese Tongs: These groups are fraternal organizations of Chinese in 
the United States, formed by Chinese immigrants after arriving. Some 
Tongs engage in criminal conduct, such as drug trafficking, prostitution, 
and illegal gambling, although many are more interested in the social-
organization aspect of being a Tong. Tongs involved in crime may use 
street gangs as enforcers.
 
✓ Other Asian organized crime: This category includes Vietnamese and 
Korean groups in the United States that often start as street gangs. Such 
groups are often willing to work with or use criminals from other ethnic 
groups. (In contrast, Russian organized crime groups and the Italian 
Mafia are less likely to work with other ethnicities.) These organized 
crime groups are involved in drugs, extortion, human smuggling, the 
sale of counterfeit products, and all kinds of fraud. Some groups branch 
out into legitimate businesses, in part at least, to launder their money.
 
✓ Mexican organized crime: The Mexican Mafia, or La Eme, started as a 
California prison gang in the 1950s and today is one of the largest orga­
nized crime operations on the West Coast. A rival organization split off 
and is known as La Nuestra Familia or “our family.” Leaders in these 
organizations are some serious, hardcore criminals. The Mexican Mafia 
has cultivated street gangs known as Surenos, which means “southern­
ers” (these gangs are primarily from southern California). Meanwhile, 
La Nuestra Familia has built up street gangs known as Nortenos, which 
means “northerners” (not surprisingly, these gangs are mostly from 
northern California). Surenos and Nortenos engage in battles across the 
western United States for territory to distribute drugs and engage in 
other criminal acts. Proceeds then make their way to leadership within 
the Mexican Mafia or La Nuestra Familia.
Looking at What Organized 
Crime Groups Do
In this section, I discuss some of the most common organized crime activi­
ties for making money. Of course, criminals can be ingenious when it comes 

110
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
to figuring out ways to make money illegally. And leaders of organized crime 
groups tend to be some of the smartest criminals, so this list isn’t compre­
hensive. But it does give you a good picture of what’s going on.
Selling narcotics
There’s so much money to be made in drug trafficking that it has been the 
primary organized crime business for the last 60 years. Because this type of 
crime is such a significant challenge for law enforcement and has such a pro­
found impact on society, I devote Chapter 9 to a discussion of narcotics and 
touch only briefly on the subject here.
Selling drugs usually requires the support of an organization. Most illegal drugs 
are trafficked into the United States from other countries. At a bare minimum, 
the illegal drug business requires someone in an organization to do the following:
 
✓ Produce the drugs
 
✓ Transport the drugs
 
✓ Sell the drugs
 
✓ Move the money back to the organization’s leaders
In other words, unless you’re stealing Mom’s prescription pills from the 
medicine cabinet and selling them to your friends (a growing problem in the 
United States, by the way), you probably require the help of a much larger 
organization to be part of the narcotics trade.
Marketing counterfeit 
and pirated products
In the last 20 years, counterfeit and pirated products have become huge busi­
ness drivers for organized crime. But before I describe the nuts and bolts of 
this business, I need to explain what counterfeit and pirated products are:
 
✓ Counterfeit goods: Counterfeit goods are imitation products that 
infringe on someone’s rights, such as patent or trademark rights. For 
example, a purse that bears the Gucci symbol but sells for $29.99 is 
probably counterfeit. (In case you aren’t a purse aficionado, Gucci 
purses regularly go for $2,000 or more.)
 
✓ Pirated goods: Pirated goods are goods that have been illegally copied. 
The sale of pirated goods violates someone’s copyright because the 
person pirating the goods doesn’t have the legal right to make copies. 
For example, if you photocopied this book and then sold it, I could (and 
probably would) track you down and have you arrested.

111
 Chapter 8: A Group Effort: Organized Crime and Gangs
The sale of counterfeit and pirated products is a multi-billion-dollar busi­
ness, which explains why organized crime groups are involved. Today, almost 
anything can be counterfeited or pirated, from music and movies to clothing, 
golf clubs, cigarettes, car parts, and pharmaceuticals. In a very conservative 
estimate by the international Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development, the annual cost of counterfeit goods is $176 billion or 2 percent 
of the world economy.
	
More sophisticated criminal organizations counterfeit products to try to fool 
the consumer. Try shopping for golf clubs on e-Bay, for example. Do you know 
which clubs are the real deal? More dangerous than knock-off golf clubs are 
the counterfeit after-market car parts and pharmaceuticals that criminal orga­
nizations commonly sell to unsuspecting consumers. For example, counterfeit 
brake pads probably aren’t made to the same standard as those made by the 
true manufacturer. When you jam on your brakes at an intersection, you don’t 
want to discover that you bought a counterfeit, defective product.
In some parts of the United States, such as California, counterfeit cigarettes 
are very common. You may think you’re buying Marlboros with North 
Carolinian tobacco, but you’re really smoking tobacco grown in Southeast 
Asia. Making and marketing counterfeit cigarettes is a big business for orga­
nized crime groups because it allows them to avoid the federal and state 
tobacco taxes, which can add up to millions in profit from just one truckload.
Southeast Asia and China produce the vast majority of counterfeit and pirated 
products. The Chinese government has tacitly acquiesced in the activity 
because counterfeiting and piracy bring a huge influx of money to the country.
International organized crime groups may move counterfeit and pirated 
goods via the same international transportation routes they use to traffic 
drugs, or they may simply import goods via container ships by mislabeling 
ship manifests. (See Chapter 9 for more on the international drug trade.) For 
example, a container may be listed as possessing toys, but it’s really filled 
with counterfeit DVDs.
After the goods arrive in the United States, distributors move the goods 
to flea market sellers, stores that mix counterfeit goods in with legitimate 
goods, and even normally honest citizens who hold house parties where they 
sell counterfeit goods.
Counterfeiting and piracy are attractive to organized crime groups not only 
because of their significant profit potential but also because the punishments 
for such crimes aren’t great. For example, if you make counterfeit Calloway 
golf clubs in China, chances are the Chinese government won’t do anything 
to you. Even in the United States, the punishment for selling $1 million of 
pirated DVDs is much less than it is for selling drugs. Plus, very few police 
have the time to work piracy or counterfeit cases, so the chances of getting 
caught aren’t great.

112
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Committing fraud
With the dramatic technological advances in recent years, fraud (the process 
of tricking people out of what’s rightfully theirs) has become a relatively 
easy and cost-effective way to commit crime. I discuss fraud crimes in detail 
in Chapter 6. Here, I briefly touch on how organized crime groups engage in 
fraud.
Of course, not all fraud today is technologically based. Some organized crime 
groups still count on the old-fashioned kind of fraud to make a quick buck. 
For example, a motorcycle gang member reports his motorcycle stolen. He 
gets his insurance money, rebuilds his bike with a few new parts, and regis­
ters it as a newly built vehicle. Insurance fraud like this example is a con-
stant challenge, which is why insurance companies have their own fraud 
investigators.
On the other hand, some organized crime groups have switched to a more 
sophisticated type of fraud. For example, in 1991, 13 members of a Russian 
organized crime group were arrested in California after stealing more than 
$1 billion through a false medical billing scheme. The ringleader was sentenced 
to 21 years in prison and had to pay back $41 million in restitution to the 
victims.
Internet fraud is becoming more and more common among organized crime 
groups because it’s such an easy way to make money. A massive e-mail cam­
paign can almost instantaneously solicit millions of people to be victimized. 
For a more detailed discussion of Internet fraud, see Chapter 6.
Credit card fraud has become a big business for organized crime groups, 
too. They exploit the fact that stores and banks would rather have fast 
credit transactions than confirm that fraudsters are who they say they are. 
Basically, organized crime groups commit credit fraud by stealing your credit 
information and then using it for their own purposes. Although the possible 
ways to commit credit fraud are innumerable, a real-life example may help 
explain how it can work.
	
I know of a criminal organization that worked a clever credit fraud operation: 
The organization included a person who worked in a hotel in Las Vegas. When 
a guest checked in to the hotel, that person swiped the guest’s credit card in 
his own personal credit card reader as well as the hotel’s reader. After he stole 
the guest’s credit card number, he sent it to another member of the organiza­
tion in another state. That person attached the number to a blank credit card 
and then quickly maxed out the card by buying Home Depot gift cards at a gro­
cery store. A third person used the gift cards to purchase expensive items at 
Home Depot in the self-checkout line. A fourth person then returned the items 
to Home Depot for cash.

113
 Chapter 8: A Group Effort: Organized Crime and Gangs
Loan sharking
Loan sharking, in a nutshell, is the act of illegally loaning money at extremely 
high interest rates. In some states, weak usury laws allow legitimate businesses 
to lawfully make such loans. These legitimate businesses are often known as 
“check-cashing” businesses. Although they cash your check for a fee, they make 
most of their money by charging you high interest in exchange for loaning you 
money, perhaps in advance of your paycheck or with your car as collateral.
In states where such practices are illegal, criminals known as loan sharks or shy­
locks, who work for organized crime groups, often step in and bankroll desper­
ate people who are looking for cash. (The term shylock is a reference to one of 
the main characters in Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice.) The interest rate 
that loan sharks charge can range from 5 percent a week to 20 percent or more, 
depending on the client. As practiced by the Mafia, if the people who borrow the 
money can’t pay back the money, they must at least pay the interest . . . or else.
Old-fashioned loan sharking still exists today, particularly in bad neighbor­
hoods where desperate people and drug addicts are willing to take on signifi­
cant risks for immediate cash.
Extorting money
In essence, extortion is the process of getting something (usually money) 
from someone by using violence or threats. Organized crime groups have his­
torically relied on the ol’ shakedown tactic to extort money from others (and 
to avoid getting caught in the process). Essentially, this tactic involves threat­
ening violence unless a person pays money.
Here are a few examples of common extortion tactics that organized crime 
groups still use today:
 
✓ A gang tells a store owner she needs to pay “protection money” to the 
gang to make sure nothing bad happens to her store.
 
✓ An organization sets up a politician in a compromising situation and then 
extorts political favors in exchange for not revealing the information.
 
✓ A Mexican citizen pays a coyote (a human smuggler) to smuggle her into 
the United States. After she arrives, the coyote holds her hostage until 
the Mexican citizen’s family pays more money for her to be released.
Extortion is a difficult crime to prove because the victim is usually vulner­
able and unwilling to report the crime out of fear of what the organized crime 
group may do in retaliation. So the risk of getting caught is low.

114
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Committing violence to 
support the “business”
The threat of violence runs behind much of organized crime. Because crimi­
nals can’t sue each other in court, they often settle disputes with violence. 
Organized crime groups also use violence to eliminate competition and grab 
market share. They may even use the threat of violence as part of their busi­
ness plans to make money or collect money (see the preceding section).
For some organizations, such as street gangs, violence is even part of their rite 
of initiation. In some gangs, for example, a new member must be “jumped” in, 
which means other gang members join in a group assault on the new member.
Laundering money
Having a lot of money derived from crime is a double-edged sword. On one 
hand, it’s the reason why people get into the business of crime in the first place. 
But, on the other hand, the existence of a lot of money creates suspicion, which 
can lead to criminal investigations. For example, when you see a young man 
who doesn’t have a job driving a Mercedes and wearing a lot of bling around his 
neck, you probably assume he’s either a trust-fund kid or a drug dealer.
Plus, everyone in the United States must pay taxes on their income, whether 
that income is legitimate or not. Failure to pay taxes — not bootlegging — is 
what landed Al Capone in prison.
To avoid creating suspicion and to avoid being prosecuted for tax crimes, orga­
nized crime groups try to launder their money — in other words, they try to 
make their income look legitimate. (A third reason to launder money is to pre­
vent law enforcement from taking the money away through forfeiture, which I 
discuss in the “Taking back the money: Forfeiture” section later in this chapter.)
Common ways to launder money include the following:
 
✓ Running legitimate businesses: Sophisticated organized crime groups 
may own legitimate businesses that deal mostly in cash, such as car 
washes, night clubs, and restaurants. Because cash transactions have no 
records that can be traced, organized crime groups can declare their prof­
its from criminal activities to be income from their legitimate businesses.
 
✓ Sending money overseas: Some organized crime groups send money 
overseas. Some criminals may then bring the money back to the United 
States in the form of a foreign currency or small amounts of U.S. cur­
rency. Others just keep the money in the foreign countries.

115
 Chapter 8: A Group Effort: Organized Crime and Gangs
As I discuss later in this chapter, law enforcement sometimes tries to defeat 
organized crime by taking away the profits, but laundering schemes have 
become so sophisticated that seizing cash is often more a matter of luck than 
skill.
Fighting Organized Crime
Attacking organized crime is more difficult than dealing with ordinary crime. 
When you arrest a burglar, you take him off the street and, thus, stop his 
criminal activity (theoretically, at least). In contrast, when you arrest one 
person in an organized crime group, you don’t stop the criminal activity — 
the organization recruits another person and continues on without missing a 
beat. Success in attacking organized crime means not only arresting and con­
victing individual suspects but also disabling entire criminal organizations so 
that the criminal activity ends. In this section, I outline a few of the ways law 
enforcement attempts to do just that.
Using criminal intelligence
Criminal intelligence is information that police keep about suspects or orga­
nizations as they work investigations. Intelligence is the primary tool police 
use to identify the members of an organization, as well as their roles in the 
organization. (Check out Chapter 16 for more details about intelligence-led 
policing.)
Imagine that you’re a narcotics detective and an informant tells you that 
marijuana and cocaine are being sold at the house at 123 Easy Street. You 
set up surveillance at the house one afternoon and get the license plate 
numbers of about 20 cars that stop in front of the house. You approach one 
of the drivers and ask him whether you can search him for drugs. When you 
find a small baggy of marijuana, he admits that he bought it in the house and 
gives you the name of the dealer. Hoping to avoid arrest, he says the dealer 
gets a new delivery of marijuana every Sunday morning. You decide you want 
to go after the dealer’s dealer, so you arrange for surveillance on the house 
next Sunday.
All the information you gathered in the preceding example is considered 
criminal intelligence. It tells you who’s involved in the drug organization 
and what each person’s role is. This information is absolutely essential 
to your investigation. By gathering intelligence about the drug organization 
at 123 Easy Street, you can devise a strategy for arresting two levels of 
dealers.

116
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Overcoming jurisdictional boundaries: 
Task forces
Criminals don’t necessarily stay within their own towns. They may travel 
across city, county, and state lines to commit crimes because they know that 
police often don’t share information with officers in other jurisdictions. One 
way police combat this limitation is by forming task forces of officers from mul­
tiple agencies. Although I discuss task forces in detail in Chapter 16, it’s impor­
tant to note that task forces play a crucial role in attacking organized crime.
A task force is a group of police officers from different agencies who join 
together to target a particular type of crime. Usually, task forces target orga­
nized crime in the form of gangs or drug organizations. One advantage of cre­
ating a task force is that each participating officer shares intelligence with the 
other officers from different agencies. Also, the task force’s members develop 
specialized investigative skills and knowledge for the type of crime they’re 
focusing on. For example, a multijurisdictional gang task force develops rela­
tionships with informants who know about a gang’s activity. With the help of 
these informants, the task force can learn the identities of the gang members 
and figure out what criminal activity the gang is involved in.
The criminal intelligence that the task force acquires is crucial to developing 
a strategy for taking out the organization. For example, if your city’s police 
department doesn’t have a gang task force (or isn’t part of one), it will have 
trouble gaining the intelligence or expertise it needs to fight the gang’s crimi­
nal conduct. As a result, patrol officers just respond to 9-1-1 calls of crime; 
they don’t proactively attempt to eliminate the gang behind the crimes.
Proving conspiracy
An important concept in attacking organized crime is conspiracy. A conspir­
acy is an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime. In crimi­
nal law, conspiracy to commit a crime is a crime itself. Here’s an example of 
conspiracy in action:
 
✓ Bob and Chuck discuss killing Ken.
 
✓ Bob obtains a gun and gives it to Chuck.
 
✓ Chuck agrees to use the gun to kill Ken.
In this example, Bob and Chuck commit the crime of conspiracy to commit 
murder. Often, using the crime of conspiracy is the best way for law enforce­
ment to attack organized crime groups.

117
 Chapter 8: A Group Effort: Organized Crime and Gangs
In essence, organized crime is one large, ongoing conspiracy. Each member 
of an organization agrees to do a particular job so that the organization can 
make money. One of the best ways to prove the existence of a criminal con­
spiracy is by listening to the criminals talk to each other, which is where wire­
taps come in.
Setting up wiretaps
The U.S. Constitution prohibits searches without probable cause. In other 
words, law enforcement has to reasonably believe you’re committing a crime 
before they can search your person, home, or other personal effects.
A wiretap is the tapping of a telephone or other device to get information 
secretly; it’s considered the most intrusive type of search. After all, the police 
aren’t just rummaging through your sock drawer; they’re listening to every­
thing you say. For this reason, extra strict rules apply to the use of wiretaps, 
and some states don’t allow wiretaps at all. But for a cop, there’s nothing like 
listening to two guys discuss their plans to commit a crime — and there’s no 
better tool for defeating organized crime. So, if the case is important enough, 
police may be willing to jump through all the extra procedural hoops to wire­
tap a suspect.
To obtain a wiretap, a police officer has to write an affidavit (a sworn written 
statement) for a judge that shows that the police have met the requirements 
set out here:
 
✓ The police have probable cause to believe that the suspect is commit­
ting a crime.
 
✓ The crime being investigated is one for which a wiretap is permitted. 
(This varies from state to state, but, generally, you can’t obtain a wiretap 
for most crimes. You can, however, obtain one for violent crimes, drug 
crimes, and a few others.)
 
✓ The police have exhausted every other investigative avenue for gather­
ing enough information to arrest the suspects. In other words, police 
must show that they’ve tried and failed at techniques such as
 
• Using informants
 
• Using undercover officers
 
• Tailing the suspect
 
• Conducting aerial surveillance of the suspect
 
• Searching the suspect’s garbage

118
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
	
After acquiring a judge’s permission to use a wiretap, the police must stop 
listening to any conversation when they determine the suspect isn’t talking 
about crime but maybe is talking about dinner plans instead, for example. 
This technique is called minimizing, but doing so can be tricky because it may 
sound like the bad guy is just talking about what to have for dinner when he’s 
really talking in code about how many drugs to order up.
Police can use different types of wiretaps. For instance, they may directly 
listen to phone calls, or they may install microphones in a suspect’s home or 
vehicle. Police usually also have to obtain a wiretap order from a judge to tap 
into a suspect’s text messages or Internet communications.
Wiretap investigations are extremely expensive to conduct. If police are 
tapping phone lines, they must pay the phone company for its time and 
expenses. If the suspects speak a foreign language, they must hire interpret­
ers. Most organized crime is committed after hours, so officers usually have 
to work a lot of overtime during wiretap investigations, which means depart­
ments have to pay overtime. Because of these costs, police use wiretaps 
much less frequently than most people think.
Relying on informants
Before you can obtain a wiretap, you must try to use an informant. And 
because of the costs and difficulties of doing wiretaps, which I discuss in the 
preceding section, informants are one of the preferred tools for most orga­
nized crime investigators.
Talking in crime code
Here’s an example of a coded conversation 
between two drug dealers that police may 
intercept using a wiretap:
	
	 Rick: Dude, what do you got?
	
	 Manuel: I got a kitchen of nine.
	
	 Rick: How much?
	
	 Manuel: Eight.
	
	 Rick: That’s too much.
	
	 Manuel: Alright. Let me call around.
What are they talking about? Out of concern 
that someone may be listening, criminals often 
talk in code. Here, Rick is checking to see what 
Manuel has to sell. Rick is a low-level dealer, 
and Manuel is Rick’s source. Manuel has a 
“kitchen of nine,” which is a corner of a brick 
of cocaine, or 9 ounces. Manuel is selling each 
ounce for $800, and Rick says that’s too expen­
sive. So Manuel offers to call around and see if 
he can buy some cocaine from someone else at 
a cheaper price. In effect, Manuel is acting as 
Rick’s cocaine broker.

119
 Chapter 8: A Group Effort: Organized Crime and Gangs
An informant is someone who gives information to police about criminal con­
duct. For example, a citizen who calls the police about his neighbor selling 
drugs is an informant. But, more commonly, informants are people who exist 
in the criminal world. They become informants because the police caught 
them and they want to work off charges or because they need some money.
In a simple narcotics investigation, for example, an officer may give an infor­
mant $50 and ask him to go to a drug dealer and buy drugs. The informant 
gives the drugs he buys to the officer, and the officer uses those drugs as evi­
dence to write a search warrant for the drug dealer’s home.
Informants may also work within an organization and decide to help the gov­
ernment. Usually, informants do this not because they’re good citizens but 
because they may face criminal charges themselves and agree to work for the 
government in exchange for a reduced sentence. A good example is Sammy 
“The Bull” Gravano, a mafia underboss who turned state’s evidence against 
Mafia kingpin John Gotti, Sr.
Although informants can be extremely helpful in organized crime investiga­
tions, the world of informants is often very murky and complicated. A member 
of one drug organization may become an informant for police against a rival 
drug-trafficking organization, trying to improve his own organization’s market 
share. Some informants treat informing as a profession, moving around the 
country, trying to infiltrate criminal organizations in exchange for cash from 
the police. Not surprisingly, some informants are less than reliable, which can 
cause problems in an investigation. For instance, if an officer learns that an 
informant has lied in the past, she generally can’t use information from that 
informant in her affidavit for a search warrant or a wiretap.
Going undercover
Another tactic for investigating organized crime is going undercover. To go 
undercover, a police officer pretends to be a criminal and seeks to obtain 
evidence from the organization without the organization knowing it’s being 
investigated. This tactic may be as simple as doing a one-time drug buy or as 
difficult as going deep undercover and trying to infiltrate the organization. 
You can find an interesting depiction of life deep undercover in Under and 
Alone (Random House). Former ATF Special Agent William Queen wrote this 
book about his infiltration of the Mongols motorcycle gang.
Undercover work can be dangerous. Criminal organizations conduct counter­
surveillance, which means they look out for police who may be watching them. 
Outlaw motorcycle gangs, such as the Mongols and the Hells Angels, conduct 
extensive background investigations on anyone trying to join their gangs. 
Obviously, the purpose of these investigations is to weed out undercover cops.

Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Taking back the money: Forfeiture
The federal government and most states have laws that allow law enforce­
ment to conduct forfeiture (or seize criminal assets). Generally, the govern­
ment can do so in the following two circumstances:
 
✓ When the assets are proceeds of criminal conduct: For example, law 
enforcement can seize cash made from a drug deal or a car purchased 
with cash from a drug deal.
 
✓ When the assets are an instrumentality of a crime: In other words, the 
assets are an instrument used during the commission of the crime. For 
example, when a gun trafficker transports guns in a hidden compart­
ment in an SUV, the police consider the SUV to be a tool used in the com­
mission of a crime and can seize it.
As I discuss in the “Laundering money” section, criminals try to hide the 
money they make; they do so, in large part, to prevent the police from seiz­
ing it. Usually, the government conducts forfeiture by bringing a civil lawsuit 
against the owner of the asset. For example, after seizing an SUV that con­
tained illegal firearms, the government files a suit against the owner of the 
SUV, alleging that the vehicle was an instrumentality of criminal conduct. 
The owner can choose to respond to the lawsuit, but, often, as part of a plea 
agreement in the criminal case against the owner, the owner gives up the 
right to the vehicle.
After the government obtains ownership of the SUV, it sells the vehicle. In 
most jurisdictions, it then distributes the money back to the police agencies 
that made the arrests. These agencies can use that money to help pay for the 
organized crime task force that made the arrest in the first place.
Getting an Inside Scoop 
on Criminal Gangs
People don’t always think about gangs as being part of organized crime. And, 
sometimes, gangs — particularly street gangs — aren’t really into organized 
crime as much as they’re into basic delinquent behavior over turf, girls, and 
establishing a place in their neighborhood’s social hierarchy. But then again, 
some gangs associate with and participate in organized crime. In this section, 
I briefly touch on the three types of criminal gangs: street gangs, motorcycle 
gangs, and prison gangs.

121
 Chapter 8: A Group Effort: Organized Crime and Gangs
Youth and street gangs
A gang doesn’t have to be criminal. Youths may join together, come up with a 
name for their group, and even engage in some level of delinquent behavior. 
Many youth gangs (also called street gangs) aren’t much more than associa­
tions of friends who share tastes in music, drugs, and an antiauthoritarian 
view. Gangs may be a way for kids to make some income (through selling 
drugs, for example) or to establish some self-esteem and respect in their 
neighborhoods. For a discussion of what causes kids to join gangs or turn to 
lives of crime, turn to Chapters 12, 13, and 14.
In contrast, many street gangs are significantly involved in crime and pose a 
serious risk for cities all across the country. I discuss this risk in the following 
sections.
Some sizeable U.S. street gangs
Here are some larger street gangs in the United 
States, most of which have many smaller neigh­
borhood cliques or sets associated with them:
 ✓ 18th Street: Originally formed in Los 
Angeles, this gang is believed to have 
between 30,000 and 50,000 members in 20 
states.
 ✓ Fresno Bulldogs: This gang is one of the 
few California Hispanic gangs not to claim 
allegiance to the Surenos or Nortenos.
 ✓ Latin Kings: This Chicago-based group con­
sists of more than 160 cliques in 30 states 
and has as many as 35,000 members.
 ✓ Mara Salvatrucha (or M.S. 13): This vio­
lent Hispanic organization has origins in El 
Salvador. It has roughly 8,000 members in 
the United States and another 20,000 out­
side the United States.
 ✓ Bloods: With its roots in Los Angeles, this 
African American street gang exists in 123 
cities and 33 states.
 ✓ Crips: Also founded in Los Angeles, this 
African American gang exists in 40 states 
and has 30,000 to 35,000 members.
 ✓ Gangster Disciples: This Chicago-based 
African American gang is active in at 
least 31 states and has more than 25,000 
members.
 ✓ Vice Lord Nation: This Chicago-based 
African American gang has around 30,000 
members in 28 states.
 ✓ Asian Boyz: One of the largest Asian street 
gangs, it has as many as 2,000 members in 14 
states. Members are primarily Vietnamese 
or Cambodian.
Each of these large gangs is involved in street-
level narcotics trafficking along with other 
crimes, such as assault, murder, fraud, identity 
theft, burglary, and money laundering.

122
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Connecting with organized crime
In assessing a street gang’s threat to society, knowing whether it’s affiliated 
with other gangs or serious organized crime is important. For example, a 
street gang may go by the name “Tiny Locos.” If the Tiny Locos aren’t affili­
ated with other groups, they may not be much of a threat to society because 
they probably don’t have access to large quantities of drugs or weapons. 
However, if they’re associated with another larger gang, they may be part of a 
drug distribution network or other large-scale organized crime activities.
Like other organized crime groups, street gangs tend to form along racial 
lines, so the first step in assessing a street gang is looking at the ethnicity of 
the gang. For example, some gang cops may describe the affiliations of the 
Tiny Locos organization in the following ways:
 
✓ The Tiny Locos are mostly Mexican.
 
✓ They claim to be affiliated with the Surenos (a southern California gang). 
(Gang cops may say the Tiny Locos are a clique or set of the Surenos, 
which just means they’re a smaller gang affiliated with a larger one.)
 
✓ The Surenos are affiliated with the organized crime group known as the 
Mexican Mafia, a serious organized crime prison gang.
Knowing these connections, a police chief may be concerned that the Tiny 
Locos are carving out territory in town to serve as part of a drug-distribution 
network for the Surenos and the Mexican Mafia. As a result, the police chief 
may try to form a specialized gang unit to fight this particular street gang.
Carving up territory
Another trait of gangs that can pose a threat to society is their tendency to 
carve out territory for themselves. Sometimes gangs claim territory for busi­
ness purposes, such as to control the drug and prostitution markets in a partic­
ular area. For other gangs, asserting authority over territory is less a business 
move and more a way to establish hierarchy in relation to other gangs.
A street gang may establish its territory through tagging, which means spray 
painting gang graffiti. It may also do so by using violence.
Using violence
Gang violence can have a dramatic impact on neighborhoods and even entire 
cities. Periodic heavy violence may erupt as rival gangs exchange attacks, 
placing all city residents in fear. Street gangs use violence for a variety of rea­
sons, such as the following:
 
✓ To protect territory.
 
✓ To enforce the collection of debts.

123
 Chapter 8: A Group Effort: Organized Crime and Gangs
 
✓ To extort something, most likely money. (See the “Extorting money” sec­
tion for more info on this common gang activity.)
 
✓ To respond to a perceived slight to a gang member or the entire gang.
 
✓ To protect the honor of a gang member’s family or girlfriend.
 
✓ To prove a gang member’s toughness and establish a prominent position 
in a gang.
	
	In fact, many gangs require an act of violence to gain membership. 
Skinheads, for example, may require a prospective member to assault 
someone before being allowed to join. Skinheads typically are white-
supremacist youth (although some skinheads are nonracist) who are 
less involved in crime for profit and more interested in intimidation of 
minorities and gays.
Getting females involved
Lest you think gangs are just for males, female gangs have become an increas­
ing problem in the past decade, although they’re still nowhere close to the 
scope and size of male gangs.
	
An intelligence analyst I know recently helped solve a gang shooting in which 
female gang members called the victim on his cellphone and tricked him into 
coming outside so that a male gang member could shoot him.
Motorcycle gangs
Outlaw motorcycle gangs, or OMGs as they’re known in law enforcement, are 
generally more organized than street gangs, with bylaws, officers, and strict 
hierarchies. Motorcycles are often ancillary to their criminal activity, but the 
love of bikes is one of the things that binds members of OMGs together.
The U.S. Department of Justice reports that there are more than 300 OMGs 
in the country but that the three most heavily involved in international drug 
smuggling are the Hells Angels, the Bandidos, and the Outlaws. Larger OMGs 
often affiliate with smaller ones and even use the smaller ones for recruiting 
purposes.
Aside from trafficking drugs, OMGs are involved in a variety of other crimes. 
They may engage in motorcycle thefts, extortion, prostitution, insurance 
fraud, weapons trafficking, assault, and murder.
As with street gangs, intense rivalries often exist among OMGs. For example, 
the Hells Angels and the Mongols are bitter rivals. In fact, the Mongols have 
created alliances with other OMGs, such as the Bandidos, the Outlaws, and 
the Pagans, against the Hells Angels.

124
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
	
Recently, a Mongol showed up at a chapel in Las Vegas to marry his girlfriend. 
How sweet, right? Unfortunately, the wedding turned ugly when a knife fight 
broke out after the groom discovered the person getting married in front of 
him was a member of the Hells Angels.
Recognizing an OMG member
Obviously, not everyone who rides a motorcycle and wears a leather jacket 
is involved in criminal activity. Several things distinguish OMGs from other 
groups that like to ride bikes.
First of all, to my knowledge, all OMGs in the United States require a member 
to ride an American-made motorcycle — either a Harley Davidson or an 
Indian. And most telling, OMGs wear distinctive patches, which consist of 
a rocker over the top, a symbol in the middle, and a rocker on the bottom, 
when they ride. (A rocker is a patch in the shape of the bottom part of a rock­
ing chair.) This three-part patch is known as a biker’s colors.
You may see a biker without the bottom rocker. This person may be a pros­
pect, also known as a prospective member who hasn’t yet earned full-patch 
membership.
	
OMG members take pride in being “1%ers,” a term that supposedly refers to a 
quote from a former president of the American Motorcycle Association, who, in 
1947, claimed that 99 percent of motorcyclists are law-abiding citizens. As a 
matter of fact, OMG members usually have a “1%” patch on their leather jackets.
	
In October of 2008, after a lengthy undercover investigation, the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco, Explosives and Firearms (ATF) arrested 61 members of the 
Mongols motorcycle gang across six states on a federal racketeering indict­
ment. In a novel approach, the federal government has sought to take away 
the trademark rights for the Mongols name, which is displayed on their patch. 
(Yes, the Mongols trademarked their patch.) The idea is that if a police officer 
sees a Mongol wearing the group’s patch, the police can seize it.
Living the biker life
OMGs have strict rules. Members must pay dues and attend regular meet­
ings, which some clubs call “church.” If a member fails to abide by the rules, 
he’s punished with a fine, a beating, or forfeiture of property, such as his 
bike. Members may even be killed by other members for serious violations of 
rules, such as becoming informants for the police.
Most OMGs have strong racist, sexist, and homophobic views. They usually 
prohibit nonwhites, gays, and women from joining. (Hispanics are generally 
accepted, except in the Hells Angels.) Despite this exclusivity, OMGs have 
associates and hangers-on, or people who like to participate in the biker 
lifestyle but who aren’t full-patched members. These associates may even 

125
 Chapter 8: A Group Effort: Organized Crime and Gangs
help in the commission of crimes. For example, associates often carry mem­
bers’ weapons so that if police stop the members, the police won’t find the 
weapons.
Despite not being allowed to join, women often associate with and participate 
in the OMG lifestyle. I know of a biker named Butch whose girlfriend proudly 
wore a jacket with a patch that read “Butch’s Bitch.”
Prison gangs
Prison is a tough place. To survive, inmates often band into groups, called 
prison gangs, usually according to ethnicity. When a gang member is 
assaulted, other members of his gang retaliate. Thus, prison gangs help pro­
vide protection for their members through deterrence.
Prison officials often refer to prison gangs as security threat groups because 
they stand in the way of the officials’ job, which is to control violence within 
prisons.
A number of prison gangs have expanded beyond their original bases of 
operation to become interstate criminal enterprises that reach well outside 
of prison walls. They often have strict hierarchies, bylaws, and rules, and 
they enforce these rules through violence. Here are some of the larger prison 
gangs in the United States:
 
✓ Mexican Mafia: A group mostly made up of Hispanics from southern 
California
 
✓ La Nuestra Familia: A group mostly made up of Hispanics from northern 
California
 
✓ Aryan Brotherhood: A white-supremacist group
 
✓ Nazi Lowriders: A white-supremacist group
 
✓ Public Enemy Number One (PEN1): A white-supremacist group
 
✓ Texas Syndicate: A group mostly made up of Mexican Americans that 
operates both in Mexico and the United States
 
✓ Barrio Azteca: A group mostly made up of Mexican Americans that 
started in Texas and the Southwest
 
✓ Mexicanemi: A group that’s also called the Texas Mexican Mafia
 
✓ Neta: A group made up of Puerto Ricans that started in Puerto Rico and 
is now prominent in the Northeast
 
✓ Black Guerilla Family: A group made up of African Americans that 
started in California and is now also in Maryland

126
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
How do these groups spread beyond their home prisons? Frequently, inmates 
are transferred to other states’ prisons to keep them safe. For example, a Nazi 
Lowrider who has been targeted by the Mexican Mafia in a California prison 
may be moved to a Colorado prison. While in Colorado, that prisoner may 
start up a new Nazi Lowrider chapter.
Although these groups may have started for protection, they have grown 
into criminal enterprises that commit crimes inside and outside prison walls. 
Inside, members may engage in a variety of crime. For example, they may 
assault rival gang members or extort money from other prisoners who want 
to avoid being beaten — or worse. The smuggling of contraband, such as 
cigarettes and drugs, is very lucrative in prison, and prison gangs can be very 
adept at bringing contraband inside the walls.
But as dangerous as prison gangs can be inside prison walls, their expansion 
into vast drug-trafficking operations is an even bigger concern. Of particular 
concern are groups near the southwest border of the United States, where so 
much of the nation’s illegal narcotics come from. Where drugs are, so, too, is 
violence as the gangs protect distribution routes and territory.
However, when they leave prison, many prison gang members step away from 
the formal criminal operations of their prison gangs. They may go back to 
their old street gang, or they may even leave the criminal lifestyle altogether.

rugs and the consequences of drug use and addiction are easily the 
largest criminal problems in the United States. Organized crime makes 
billions of dollars off of selling drugs, and drugs and the drug business ruin 
hundreds of lives every day (see Chapter 8 for more on organized crime).
When policymakers discuss how to tackle the drug problem, they use the 
analogy of a three-legged stool. The three legs of the stool are enforcement, 
treatment, and prevention. The argument is that unless all three legs receive 
proper funding, the antidrug effort will fail.
In this chapter, I discuss the challenges that law enforcement faces in tack­
ling this global criminal business. I also discuss efforts to provide help to 
people who are addicted to drugs, as well as efforts to prevent kids from 
using drugs in the first place.
The Global Workings of Dealing Drugs
I bet you know someone who smokes an occasional joint of marijuana or 
even does a little cocaine. Maybe you knew the local dealers in your high 
school. All these people probably say, “What’s the big deal?” Well, these 
low-level users — and even the public at large — generally don’t honestly 
know what the drugs really are, why they’re illegal, and where they come 
from. I explain all these details in this section.

128
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Making drugs illegal
Just because a substance makes you high doesn’t mean it’s illegal. Kids may 
sniff glue to make themselves dizzy, and, although doing so is stupid, it isn’t 
illegal. For a drug to be illegal, the U.S. Congress or your state legislature 
must pass a law that makes possession or sale of that particular substance 
illegal.
	
Congress passed the primary law governing drugs in the United States in 1970; 
it’s known as the Controlled Substances Act. The act created five categories or 
schedules of drugs, based in part on their level of addictiveness and whether 
they’re currently accepted for any medical uses. Here’s a brief description of 
each schedule:
 
✓ Schedule I: Drugs in this category carry a high potential for abuse and 
have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in any circumstances. 
These drugs include heroin, ecstasy, marijuana, and psilocybin mush­
rooms. Possession of these drugs is illegal.
 
✓ Schedule II: These drugs carry a high potential for abuse, but each one 
is currently accepted as medical treatment in certain circumstances. 
These drugs are available legally only by prescription. Some commonly 
known drugs in this category are cocaine, opium, methadone (used for 
treating heroin addicts), morphine, amphetamines, and oxycodone.
 
✓ Schedule III: These drugs carry an abuse potential that’s less than drugs 
in Schedules I or II and currently have accepted medical uses in treatment, 
but they’re also legally obtainable only by prescription. Some Schedule 
III drugs include marinol (which contains the active ingredient in mari­
juana and helps control nausea and weight loss) and anabolic steroids.
 
✓ Schedule IV: These drugs carry a low potential for abuse relative to 
drugs in Schedules I through III. They have medically accepted uses 
and involve limited risk of physical or psychological dependence. 
Generally, these drugs also require a prescription. One Schedule IV 
drug is phenobarbital.
 
✓ Schedule V: These drugs carry a low potential for abuse and little 
chance of creating psychological or physical dependence. This category 
includes drugs like cough suppressants, which don’t always need a 
prescription.
Outside of the Controlled Substances Act, some states have criminalized 
other drugs. For example, some states have made pseudoephedrine — a cold 
medicine — a substance for which a person must get a prescription because 
pseudo is a primary ingredient in methamphetamine (often referred to as meth). 
People used to buy cases of this cold medicine to make methamphetamine in 
their kitchens.

129
 Chapter 9: Tackling a Worldwide Problem: The Narcotics Trade
	
When I talk about illegal drugs in this chapter, I’m talking about Schedule I and 
II drugs — specifically heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, marijuana, and 
ecstasy. Many other illegal substances also ruin lives, but these five drugs are 
trafficked the most heavily in the western world.
Growing plants for the drug trade
Just as the Cabernet Sauvignon grape reaches its greatest glory in the 
Bordeaux region of France, the plants that yield three of the most trafficked 
drugs in the world have their ideal climates, as well. Here I briefly discuss 
the three drugs that have an organic base; that is, they’re grown just like any 
other agricultural crop. I note where they’re grown and how they make their 
way to the United States.
Cocaine
Cocaine is made from the coca plant. Coca leaves are grown, converted into 
a paste, and put through complex chemical treatments before they become 
cocaine. The coca plant is indigenous to the Andes Mountains of South 
America and grows best between elevations of 1,500 and 5,000 feet. Thus, 
the vast majority of cocaine comes from this region, specifically from Peru, 
Bolivia, and Colombia. Production in Peru and Bolivia has been decreasing 
over the past few years, but it has been increasing in Colombia.
Today’s generation of Colombian drug traffickers have become much more 
sophisticated than previous generations of drug cartel leaders, who directly 
confronted their nation’s government. In the 1980s, drug cartel leaders 
regularly killed judges and political figures. Today, however, Colombian 
cartels reduce their risk by not antagonizing their own government and by 
stepping back from the retail distribution in the United States, which, they 
hope, saves them from the wrath of Washington, D.C.
To reduce their risk, Colombian cartels employ sophisticated technology as 
part of their drug trade, including the use of submarines. They move drugs 
from Colombia to Mexico, and, from there, Mexican cartels traffic the drugs 
into the United States.
	
For an interesting look at the lengths the U.S. government was willing to go to 
in order to track down the old-school Colombian cartel leader Pablo Escobar, 
check out Killing Pablo: The Hunt for the World’s Greatest Outlaw by Mark 
Bowden (Atlantic Monthly Press).
Mexican cartels that control border crossings and distribution routes into the 
United States move the cocaine, along with other drugs, through the south­
west land border region. They also move drugs into the Gulf states through 
water routes. Figure 9-1 shows a map of preferred drug routes from South 
America, including the percentage of drugs that follow each path.

 Chapter 9: Tackling a Worldwide Problem: The Narcotics Trade
Heroin
Heroin is synthesized from a specific type of poppy plant. Heroin is produced 
by slicing the poppy seed pod, gathering the resin that seeps out, and using 
various chemical processes.
The countries most responsible for producing heroin are Myanmar (in 
Southeast Asia), Afghanistan, Mexico, and Colombia. The majority of Afghan 
and Asian heroin moves to markets in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. 
Increasingly, however, East Africa is becoming a transfer zone (a place where 
drugs are repackaged for shipping to their final destination) for heroin — as 
well as other drugs, such as marijuana and cocaine. Drugs that move from 
East Africa to the eastern United States generally do so in smaller quantities 
through human couriers on commercial flights.
For the most part, Mexican heroin supplies the western half of the United 
States, and Colombian heroin supplies the eastern United States. However, 
because heroin use is more prevalent in the eastern United States, Mexican 
groups are expanding their distribution to the East Coast. Transporting 
heroin from Mexico often involves human couriers, go-fast boats (high-
performance boats that were originally designed for offshore racing), and 
concealment in vehicles or luggage.
Marijuana
The marijuana plant grows best in temperate, rainy climates, such as the 
Pacific Northwest and certain regions of Hawaii. Nonetheless, marijuana is 
grown worldwide because it can also be grown indoors under grow lights — 
an increasingly popular means of propagation.
	
Indoor grows can produce four crops per year of high-quality marijuana that 
sells for between $2,500 and $6,000 a pound. A small, 40-plant basement grow 
can gross almost $1 million in a year.
Like cocaine and heroin, marijuana is smuggled into the United States in large 
quantities by Mexican drug cartels along the same routes and with the same 
methods. The only difference is that marijuana is much bulkier. As a result, 
it’s harder to get marijuana through border crossings. Traffickers may use 
airplanes and larger commercial vehicles to move significant quantities.
Interestingly, however, in recent years, Mexican organizations have started 
growing marijuana in the United States in forests and on land run by the U.S. 
Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which eliminates the main smuggling 
part of the drug-trafficking equation. In 2007, law enforcement found and 
cut down 4,791,838 marijuana plants in California alone. Undoubtedly, many 
more millions of plants weren’t found and were harvested and sold. Usually, 
Mexican nationals living unlawfully in the United States tend these so-called 
gardens.

132
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Law enforcement in several states, including California, Washington, and 
Oregon, sometimes become overwhelmed in summer months with locating 
and eradicating marijuana gardens. Imagine you’re the sheriff of a five-person 
department in Washington, and you discover 10,000 marijuana plants growing 
on BLM land in your county. Some of these plants grow 8 feet tall or higher. 
As a sheriff, you can’t just leave all that dope in the forest; you have to 
remove it. However, while you’re addressing this problem, your office may be 
unable to handle other calls for service.
Marijuana is also trafficked into the United States from Canada, where 
Vietnamese organized crime groups and the Hells Angels (a criminal 
motorcycle gang) are heavily involved in cultivation and distribution (see 
Chapter 8 for more information on organized crime).
	
Incidentally, through genetic modifications and improvements in cultivation, 
the potency of marijuana, as measured by its THC content (the level of its 
main psychoactive substance), has been rising. In other words, marijuana 
carries a more powerful punch today than it did for the flower-power 
generation in the 1960s and 1970s (see Figure 9-2).

 Chapter 9: Tackling a Worldwide Problem: The Narcotics Trade
Mixing chemicals for the drug trade
Here I discuss the two primary illegal substances that are made through 
mixing chemicals: methamphetamine and ecstasy.
Methamphetamine
Unlike cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, most methamphetamine isn’t based on 
an organic plant but rather on a mix of various chemicals, which are known 
as precursor chemicals. One of the key ingredients is pseudoephedrine, which 
is a popular cold remedy.
In the late 20th century and early 21st century, people all across the western, 
midwestern, and southern United States were creating methamphetamine 
in their houses, apartments, and motel rooms. The chemicals used to make 
meth are extremely toxic, so these meth labs had to be cleaned up like toxic 
waste sites. (Interestingly, meth still hasn’t caught on along the East Coast 
like it has elsewhere in the United States.)
Through the recent passage of federal and state laws that control the 
availability of pseudoephedrine, the number of meth labs in the United States 
has decreased dramatically. But because a large market for meth still exists, 
someone was bound to step in and fill the void. You guessed it: Mexican drug 
organizations have begun manufacturing large quantities of methamphetamine 
and trafficking it into the United States. Recently, the Mexican government 
passed a law ceasing all legal imports of pseudoephedrine into Mexico. This 
law has somewhat eased meth production in Mexico.
However, not to be deterred by importation limits on pseudoephedrine, Mexican 
drug organizations have begun to illegally import pseudoephedrine as well as 
the precursor chemicals for pseudoephedrine. In effect, Mexican drug cartels 
import chemicals to make chemicals to make methamphetamine. Mexican 
drug-trafficking organizations then move the meth into the United States using 
the same methods and routes they use for heroin, cocaine, and marijuana.
But meth isn’t just made in Mexico. It’s produced throughout the world, 
including in Southeast Asia in “super labs” that produce large quantities of 
the drug. While a kitchen lab in the United States may produce 200 doses in a 
single production cycle, a super lab can produce as many as 1 million doses 
in just one cycle.
From Southeast Asia, international drug-trafficking organizations move 
the methamphetamine along routes that they also use for heroin and other 
drugs. The drugs may move through several countries and be repackaged 
in a variety of disguises for smuggling. For example, a drug-trafficking 
organization in Hawaii hollowed out a piece of hydraulic equipment and used 
it repeatedly to smuggle meth and cash.

Ecstasy
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (say that three times fast), also known 
as MDMA or ecstasy, is a source of significant drug abuse within the United 
States. It isn’t based on a particular plant; rather, like meth, it’s a mix of 
precursor chemicals. The final product is packaged in single-dose pill form. 
Unlike meth, however, ecstasy is primarily produced in Canada by Asian 
organized crime groups. (With its heavy emphasis on chemical production, 
China is one of the leading producers of the various precursor chemicals 
needed to make heroin, meth, cocaine, and ecstasy.) The ecstasy 
manufacturers in Canada import the precursor chemicals (legally and 
illegally) and then move the final product throughout the world.
Traffickers smuggle ecstasy into the United States from Canada every which 
way. Of course, most commonly, they use the standard smuggling tactics, 
such as hiding drugs in cars and commercial vehicles, flying it in airplanes, 
and mailing it.
Between 2003 and 2007, the amount of ecstasy seized at the Canadian border 
increased 900 percent. This fact reflects the greater production levels in 
Canada and the increased demand in the United States.
	
In a recent trend, ecstasy is being adulterated with more highly addictive 
chemicals, such as methamphetamine, which is cheaper to produce than 
MDMA. For instance, in a 2007 seizure of 135 kilos (2.2 pounds equals 
1 kilo) of ecstasy in the state of Washington, half of the drugs had 
methamphetamine but no MDMA in them, and the other half had MDMA 
mixed with methamphetamine.
Moving dope to your neighborhood
From the poppy, marijuana, or coca fields (or the meth labs) to your 
neighborhood, drugs may pass through 20 different sets of hands. Drugs 
move from growers or manufacturers to distributors, who specialize in 
crossing the U.S. border, to organizations with distribution routes already 
set up within the United States. Finally, they reach the street-level dealers, 
who sell the drugs to individual drug users.
Trying to explain all the variables of drug distribution in the United States 
is nearly impossible, but, in general, the overall process of drug distribution 
is segmented, with different people handling each level of the distribution 
chain. With this setup, when police catch one person, other affiliates — 
including the main leaders — are insulated from arrest. This structure makes 
stopping the flow of drugs very difficult.

135
 Chapter 9: Tackling a Worldwide Problem: The Narcotics Trade
To better understand the drug distribution process, consider how it works 
with cocaine from Mexico.
From the field (or lab) to the U.S. border
Coca growers in Colombia harvest their leaves and turn them over to a 
Colombian cocaine cartel that processes the leaves into cocaine. The cartel 
transports the drugs in bulk by ship to the state of Michoacan in Mexico, 
just north of Acapulco. In Michoacan, the Columbian cartel sells the drugs 
to a Mexican cartel, which then drives a load of cocaine north on Mexican 
Interstate 15 close to the U.S. border. The cartel then offloads the drugs and 
places them into vehicles with hidden compartments called traps for driving 
across the border. Using their own sophisticated intelligence, Mexican cartels 
seek to minimize the risk of being caught by doing the following:
 
✓ Crossing when border patrol staffing is low to minimize the chance of 
inspection.
 
✓ Crossing when corrupt border patrol staff members, who agree not to 
inspect load cars, are working.
 
✓ Making crossings at unapproved crossing areas, such as in the desert 
where no border patrols are set up.
 
✓ Concealing drug loads inside large commercial loads of legal goods.
 
✓ Building underground tunnels that cross into the United States.
 
✓ Flying small private aircraft into the United States and landing at small 
airfields. (Thousands of little-used airfields are available in the United 
States, including 549 in Arizona alone.)
After the cocaine crosses the border in Arizona, other members of the cartel 
may ship it to a stash house in Tucson, where the drugs are offloaded. Here 
yet other members of the organization may load the drugs into another 
vehicle with hidden compartments. (Or, at this point the cartel may sell the 
drugs to another organized crime group that specializes in distribution.) 
This vehicle then moves the drugs along a specific route, perhaps dropping 
drugs off with wholesale dealers in Phoenix, Albuquerque, and Denver. These 
wholesale dealers may be part of the Mexican cartel, part of other organized 
crime groups, or just independent dealers.
Because most dealers handle multiple drugs, any combination of marijuana, 
heroin, cocaine, or methamphetamine may be added to the dealer’s drug 
load at any stage of transport. (Remember, though, that most ecstasy moves 
to the United States via Canada, so dealers from the Southwest probably 
wouldn’t have any ecstasy with them.)

136
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
From the U.S. border to your city
At this point, the wholesale dealer may have his own organization, which per­
forms the following functions:
 
✓ Offloads and stores the drugs.
 
✓ Recruits buyers. (These buyers may be lower-level wholesalers, who 
buy 9 ounces of cocaine and 12 ounces of meth, for example, and then 
sell off 1-ounce blocks to street-level dealers, who sell user amounts.)
 
✓ Transports smaller loads to buyers. (A person who transports drugs is 
called a runner.)
 
✓ Performs security and countersurveillance duties (in other words, looks 
for cops).
In some cases, the wholesale dealer not only distributes to smaller independent 
dealers but also oversees the entire organization, right down to controlling a 
street gang that handles the street-level sale of the drugs.
From your city to your street corner
Eventually, the drugs are resold in smaller and smaller amounts. People who 
start selling drugs in fractions of ounces are often heavy users themselves, 
selling drugs as a means of raising money to feed their own addictions.
For example, a fraction of a gram of methamphetamine is enough to get a 
person high. So a low-level dealer may buy a half-ounce of meth, sell most of 
it to fund his next purchase, and keep the rest of the dope for his own use.
Common nicknames for drugs
I could probably fill this book with street names 
for different illegal drugs, but here are a few 
of the more common ones. Keep in mind that 
names are often regional and change with the 
times. And, of course, know that people in law 
enforcement often refer to any drug as dope.
Marijuana: Grass, weed, pot, reefer, chronic, 
cheeba, ganja, bud, leaf, Aunt Mary, gangsta, 
skunk, tobacco, nuggets, hooch
Cocaine: Coke, Charlie, snow, flake, blow, stash, 
stardust, Aunt Nora
Crack cocaine (a cheap, heavily addictive 
product that results from continued processing 
of powder cocaine): Black rock, purple caps, 
blotter, yam, base, bopper
Heroin: Smack, junk, horse, H, Aunt Hazel, 
ballot, Big Harry, black pearl, blanco, reindeer 
dust
Methamphetamine: Meth, crank, crystal, 
Cristina, Chris, ice, redneck coke, garbage, 
speed

 Chapter 9: Tackling a Worldwide Problem: The Narcotics Trade
Treating Drug Users
The drug problem is almost too big to comprehend. The economic impact of 
drug abuse is an estimated $181 billion annually. This cost includes the following:
 
✓ Healthcare, such as emergency room visits and treatment
 
✓ Investigation, prosecution, and incarceration of users and dealers
 
✓ Lost productivity for employers
 
✓ Welfare and unemployment payments
 
✓ Child services and foster care for children of drug users
But aside from the economic impact, alcohol and substance abuse problems 
are currently turning the lives of more than 23 million people in the United 
States upside down. (And their substance abuse problems affect the lives of 
their families, friends, and co-workers, as well.) That number — 23 million — 
is roughly 10 percent of the U.S. population over 12 years of age. Most of 
these people aren’t yet full-fledged addicts, but their abuse still affects their 
relationships, employment, and health, and many of them have real potential 
to become addicted.
As a matter of fact, the numbers are so high that chances are you know 
someone who has suffered greatly from drug or alcohol abuse. (Note: The 
National Institute on Drug Abuse, which compiles these statistics, includes 
alcohol as a large part of the nation’s substance abuse problem. In fact, 
treatment admissions for alcohol account for 22 percent of all substance 
abuse treatment, followed by marijuana at 16 percent. Because alcohol use is 
legal, here I focus only on illegal drug abuse and treatment.)
So what can society do? Well, out of the 23 million abusers who could benefit 
from treatment, only about 10 percent receive treatment in a given year. One 
major obstacle to receiving drug treatment is that many people have a hard 
time recognizing that they have a problem in the first place. But another 
important barrier to treatment is the fact that the treatment capacity in the 
United States is well below the need for it.
In most states, policymakers debate whether prison funding should be 
diverted to treatment and whether drug abusers should be required to 
complete treatment rather than serve prison sentences. In reality, though, 
drug users (as distinguished from drug dealers) don’t go to prison unless 
they commit other serious crimes, such as robbery or assault. Nonetheless, 
prison budgets are often seen as a potential source for funding to increase 
drug treatment programs. In Chapter 21, I explain the incarceration versus 
treatment debate in more detail.

138
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Considering the medical marijuana movement
As of this writing, 14 states have passed laws 
legalizing the use of marijuana for medical 
purposes: Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, 
Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, 
New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, 
and Washington. These states passed 
medical marijuana laws that allow marijuana 
use by people in chronic pain or by people 
suffering from certain diseases, such as 
glaucoma, that can be treated by marijuana. As 
a result, in most of these states, a person who 
gets a note from a physician saying that she 
benefits medically from the use of marijuana 
can’t be convicted of crimes associated with 
possessing and using marijuana, as long as she 
follows the rules.
Interestingly, marijuana continues to be a 
Schedule I controlled substance and, as such, 
is still illegal to possess under federal law. Thus, 
law enforcement officials in these 14 states have 
the challenge and confusion of enforcing both 
state laws that legalize medical marijuana and 
federal laws that prohibit marijuana possession. 
(In the hierarchy of laws, federal law trumps 
state law, so, theoretically, a person who lawfully 
grows medical marijuana under Maine law 
could still be arrested by a federal special agent 
and prosecuted in federal court for marijuana 
possession. To date, however, the federal 
government hasn’t aggressively enforced 
federal marijuana laws on medicinal users.)
Opponents to medical marijuana laws argue 
that patients can easily use marinol, a 
prescription pill that contains the active ingredient 
in marijuana (THC), to provide the necessary 
treatment. However, proponents of medical 
marijuana laws contend that marinol doesn’t 
have the same effect as regular marijuana and 
that smoking the drug is a much better delivery 
mechanism than swallowing a pill.
In Oregon, medical marijuana has become 
a significant problem for law enforcement 
and people opposed to marijuana use, which 
includes most people in the business of treating 
drug addiction. (More people are admitted for 
drug treatment because of marijuana abuse 
than any other illegal drug.)
In 1998, Oregon voters approved of the law on 
the understanding that physicians would limit 
access to the drug to people in severe pain 
or people with other medical needs, such as 
people going through chemotherapy or suffering 
from glaucoma. But the law hasn’t worked 
out that way. Today, roughly 1 out of every 185 
people in Oregon has a medical marijuana card. 
Why? Because a few physicians in the state 
decided to grant a marijuana card to almost 
anyone who asked for it, and there’s currently 
no oversight of these physicians.
Another kink in the law is the amount of dope 
a person can legally possess for medical use. 
In Oregon, a person can possess 6 full-grown 
marijuana plants and 18 juvenile plants. Many 
plants grow to be 6 feet or higher, and because 
a full-grown plant can easily produce a pound 
of dope, a person can lawfully possess way 
more marijuana than she can smoke in a year. 
Guess what happens to the extra marijuana? It 
often gets sold to others, which is illegal.
I strongly believe that medical marijuana 
laws — at least in their current forms — 
pose a serious threat to local communities by 
making marijuana much more available and 
lessening the social stigma attached to drug 
use, in general.

139
 Chapter 9: Tackling a Worldwide Problem: The Narcotics Trade
Examining types of treatment
Of the people who do receive drug treatment, most of them end up in drug-
treatment facilities because they get arrested and a judge orders them to go. 
However, some people are confronted by friends and co-workers in “inter­
ventions” designed to make the drug abusers recognize their problems. 
Increasingly, doctors and hospitals are asking patients questions about drug 
use as a screening tool to see whether patients have any abuse problems.
Drug treatment occurs in the following two forms:
 
✓ Inpatient treatment: Inpatient treatment is generally for people who 
have developed serious addictions and who would easily relapse if they 
were allowed to leave the premises. The patient stays overnight in the 
treatment facility for a significant period of time, often six months or 
more. The treatment focus is on resocializing patients so they can 
reenter society without using drugs or committing crimes.
 
✓ Outpatient treatment: People in less severe circumstances, who need 
individual or group counseling about drug abuse, often take part in 
outpatient treatment. Increasingly, outpatient treatment attempts to 
address all aspects of a person’s life, including family life. Family therapy 
can be particularly effective in helping families correct the behaviors 
that can increase the risk that a member, particularly a kid, will abuse 
drugs. For example, simply having a parent home after school decreases 
the likelihood that a child will be tempted to use drugs.
As the science of treatment progresses, professionals are learning that 
treatment must be tailored to individual circumstances because the factors 
that lead to drug abuse are so complex. Today, effective treatment may go 
well beyond just trying to stop drug use. It may also include a plan for 
providing a variety of services to treatment patients, such as the following:
 
✓ Skill instruction, such as instruction on parenting or conflict-resolution 
skills
 
✓ Help with daycare while the patient looks for a job
 
✓ Instruction on how to stay away from other drug users
 
✓ Mental health treatment (because drug abuse frequently goes along with 
mental illness)
	
In the last decade, science has begun to explore the physiological effects 
of drug use, and the evidence shows that drug abuse can significantly alter 
brain structure. For example, methamphetamine results in the release of large 
amounts of pleasure-causing chemicals, such as dopamine, in the brain, which 
explains why people get hooked so easily. Over time, an abuser needs more 
and more meth to experience the same pleasure. When a user is off the drug, 
normal events in life that used to give pleasure become meaningless.

140
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
One of my state’s leading treatment providers told me how sad it was to 
watch a recovering meth addict mother experience no pleasure while playing 
with her infant. Another mother, who hasn’t abused drugs, experiences great 
joy because of the small amount of dopamine released in her brain while she 
plays with her child.
Some of the physiological changes to the brain may reverse themselves after two 
years of abstinence from the drug, but other brain changes may never reverse.
Treatment of drug abuse often includes the use of medication, especially 
during the management of the initial stages of withdrawal from addiction. 
For example, heroin and morphine addicts are often prescribed methadone, 
which suppresses withdrawal symptoms. Medication may also help with 
mental illnesses, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and 
schizophrenia, which sometimes accompany abuse or addiction.
Using drug courts
Many jurisdictions are setting up special courts for people arrested on drug 
offenses. Usually, these courts see low-level users or dealers — not high-profile 
drug traffickers. The idea behind these drug courts is that after an offender 
undergoes regular drug testing and completes a course of treatment, that 
person’s crime is wiped off the books.
Drug courts can have significant success when they impose immediate sanctions 
for violations. For example, when someone’s urine tests positive for drugs and 
she is immediately punished with a day in jail, she’s much more likely to 
complete treatment eventually and remain drug free in the future. Drug courts 
that take a lenient approach to violations don’t see as much success.
Like so many things in the justice system (and in life), a disciplined, well-run 
program is the key to success.
Shifting treatment goals
Historically, society didn’t consider anything short of total abstinence to be 
a treatment success for a drug addict. Realistically, however, this expectation 
sets up recovering drug abusers for failure.
Today treatment providers are redefining successful treatment with more 
plausible goals. For instance, if a crack cocaine addict stops using but starts 
drinking six beers a night, is that situation a success? In the past, people may 
have viewed it as trading one addiction for another and, thus, as a failure. 

141
 Chapter 9: Tackling a Worldwide Problem: The Narcotics Trade
But today, because the person can better function in society and hold a job 
(despite the daily six-pack), many treatment providers consider this situation 
to be a qualified success.
Working in the criminal justice system, I can honestly say it’s easy to have a 
jaded view of court-ordered drug treatment. I regularly saw courts order drug 
treatment for people who didn’t believe they had drug problems, and, as a 
result, they did the treatment only because the judge ordered it. They were 
often rearrested for more drug offenses.
	
My office recently investigated a gentleman who was selling cocaine while he 
was in an inpatient treatment center. At the same time, however, I’ve talked to 
an addict who said the only way he ever got clean was by getting sent back to 
treatment again and again. Eventually, he realized how he was wasting his life, 
so he worked hard to get clean. Remembering that drug users and addicts are 
human beings and not giving up on them is a significant challenge for most 
people in the criminal justice system.
Preventing Drug Use
How do you prevent kids from starting to use illegal drugs in the first place? 
The challenge is daunting. In 2005, one out of every five people between 
the ages of 18 and 25 admitted to using an illegal drug in the previous 30 
days. These same statistics offer a sampling of marijuana use by high school 
seniors over the past 30 years:
 
✓ 1980: 33.7 percent
 
✓ 1990: 14.0 percent
 
✓ 1995: 21.2 percent
 
✓ 2000: 21.6 percent
 
✓ 2003: 21.2 percent
 
✓ 2004: 19.9 percent
 
✓ 2005: 19.8 percent
 
✓ 2006: 18.3 percent
Because marijuana is usually the first illegal drug that people use, it’s a good 
measure of general drug use. These stats demonstrate that drug use by 
young people is quite variable. But what explains the dramatic decrease in 
marijuana use between 1980 and 1990? Why did marijuana use rise during the 
1990s and then start to slowly drop in 2003? I take a look at a few possible 
answers to these questions next.

142
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Educating the public
The primary tool in preventing drug use has always been education. Front 
and center in the education effort are dramatic TV ads. If you’re old enough, 
you may remember an ad that first ran in 1987 in which a guy said, “This is 
your brain on drugs,” while he showed the audience a picture of eggs frying 
in a pan. Today the federal government spends about $100 million on the 
National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign and obtains close to $3 billion 
worth of free air time from broadcasters for radio and TV messages that 
speak to the negative impacts of illegal drug use.
In recent years, these ads have focused on reducing the use of the most 
common first drugs of abuse: marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco. The idea is 
that if you can prevent or delay kids’ experimentation with drugs until they’re 
a little older, they’re less likely to develop severe drug abuse problems down 
the road.
	
Recently, this type of advertisement has come under some criticism. 
Academic researchers have identified a curious result from these ads. Such 
ads can increase curiosity among some kids, which, in turn, can have the 
counterintuitive effect of actually encouraging some kids to try marijuana. Dr. 
Carson Wagner of the University of Texas concluded that edgy, impactful ads 
keep kids thinking about drugs, which can make them more likely to experiment. 
As an alternative ad campaign, Wagner suggests using ads that don’t emphasize 
the negative effects of drug use itself but instead emphasize the positive 
effects of activities that don’t involve drugs, such as sports, music, or even 
skateboarding.
However, other researchers strongly believe that impactful ads can decrease 
drug use. Hence, you can imagine the rigorous debate that continues to 
take place today about the effectiveness of different media campaigns to 
discourage drug use.
Aside from TV and radio, nonprofit organizations have expended significant 
efforts toward reaching kids in school, particularly in middle school and 
high school. These organizations sponsor antidrug efforts in schools, which 
include training parents, teachers, and community leaders in how to give 
an effective antidrug message. These organizations often lobby government 
agencies for resources to fight drug use.
Testing for drugs
Recently, the federal government has been encouraging random drug testing 
in schools as a means of preventing drug abuse. Usually, the testing is done 
through urine samples. The government and schools alike hope that if a 
student knows that he may be tested, he’ll have a reason to say “no” to his 

143
 Chapter 9: Tackling a Worldwide Problem: The Narcotics Trade
friends who put peer pressure on him to try drugs. In addition, if the testing 
shows that a student has just started using drugs, the school can refer him to 
services to help prevent drug dependency.
Schools that do random drug testing usually do so for athletic participants 
or kids participating in other competitive extracurricular activities. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has upheld random drug testing of student athletes under the 
theory that athletes engage in dangerous activities that may make them more 
susceptible to injury if they’re under the influence of drugs.
Does testing work? Consider this example: The U.S. military started manda­
tory drug testing after the Vietnam War, and a survey in 1981 showed that 
about 28 percent of military personnel had used an illegal drug in the previ­
ous 30 days. Since that time, the military has imposed a rigorous drug-testing 
program, and the results have been impressive. Today, less than 2 percent of 
military personnel test positive for recent drug use.
Aside from schools and the military, employers have a strong interest 
in keeping their employees off drugs. Drug and alcohol abuse decrease 
employee productivity and increase injuries and absenteeism. Workplaces 
that conduct drug testing can improve safety and performance. One study 
of construction companies that conducted drug testing showed that injury 
rates dropped 51 percent within the first two years after the companies 
began the testing programs.
Not surprisingly, some people object to drug testing. The National 
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) believes that drug 
testing in schools not only fails to deter drug use but also encourages binge 
drinking, undermines trust between students and educators, and is too 
expensive. Its Web site provides information about how to defeat such test­
ing. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) contends that drug-testing 
programs are ineffective and inaccurate. Some communities, such as San 
Francisco and Berkeley, have passed laws that prohibit workplace drug test­
ing except for safety reasons.

In This Chapter
▶ Taking a look at the organization of terrorism
▶ Assessing the international terrorist threat
▶ Recognizing antigovernment groups within U.S. borders
▶ Using domestic terror to pursue political causes
▶ Combating terrorism crimes in the United States
T

wenty years ago, you may not have thought of terrorism as a criminal 
justice issue. But since the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma 
City in 1995 and the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 
September 11, 2001, law enforcement has been front and center in the battle 
against terrorism.
Terrorism is a crime that is intended to have a disproportionately large impact 
on a society through the creation of terror. Although hundreds of definitions 
of terrorism exist, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI’s) definition is 
commonly used in law enforcement:
The unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to 
intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population or any segment 
thereof in furtherance of political or social objectives
In other words, a crime becomes terrorism when it involves violence with the 
intent to achieve a political or social goal. Someone who burns down a build­
ing to get insurance money commits arson. But someone who burns down a 
meat-processing plant to stop cruelty to animals commits a crime of terrorism.
In this chapter, I look at both international terrorism and the home-grown 
kind. I then discuss how law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and 
federal levels are working to combat terrorist crimes.

146
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Recognizing Types of Terrorist Threats
Terrorists may attack as part of an organizational effort or as lone actors. 
And their choice of weapons is no longer limited to conventional tools, 
such as guns and bombs. In this section, I take a look at the different types of 
terrorism, in terms of both the players and their weapons.
Striking as an organization
Most people think of terrorists as working within organizations to commit 
attacks. The international group Al Qaeda, for example, planned the 9/11 
attack for years, breaking into groups (or cells) of four or five, obtaining 
flight lessons, and mapping out an intricate strategy to carry out multiple 
simultaneous hijackings. In fact, this type of simultaneous attack is almost a 
hallmark of an Al Qaeda operation. (See the “Facing International Terrorist 
Threats” section for more details about Al Qaeda.)
Domestic terrorists often follow the same strategy of forming cells (if not 
conducting simultaneous attacks). A cell may consist of various terrorists, 
each with a special responsibility. For example, in an attack on an animal 
research business, one cell member may get a job inside. Another may 
procure weapons and have expertise in building a bomb. A third may be 
responsible for conducting surveillance to determine facility security, and a 
fourth may have access to donors who can fund the costs, including lodging, 
food, travel, and tools to commit the act.
After the terrorist group strikes, the temporary organizational structure is 
broken and the cell disbands. In this way, terrorists try to take advantage of 
the benefits of organization while minimizing the risks — namely, infiltration 
and discovery by law enforcement.
Acting alone
Some individuals, perhaps inspired by the ideology of a particular terrorist 
organization, may choose to strike out on their own. In 2006, for example, 
Naveed Afzal Haq entered a Jewish social service organization in Seattle and 
opened fire with two pistols, killing one person and wounding five others. 
His apparent motivation was his anger toward Israel. Similar strikes have 
occurred in every region of the country.

147
 Chapter 10: Front-Page News: Terrorism
Following the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building, law enforcement 
in the United States stepped up efforts to identify people who may perpe­
trate similar acts. But identifying potential “lone wolf” terrorists, as they’re 
called, has proved extremely difficult. (See the “Dealing with Domestic 
Antigovernment Groups” section for more info on the Oklahoma City bombing.)
Many terrorist organizations, including Islamic extremist groups, actively 
encourage individuals to strike out alone. Thus, a terrorist incident may not 
be committed by Al Qaeda, but it may be inspired by Al Qaeda.
Choosing a weapon
Keep in mind that the purpose of terrorism is to effect social or political 
change through terror. So to a terrorist, the choice of weapon is very 
important. Of course, for many, especially domestic terrorists, simplicity and 
ease of use are the most important considerations. For example, a gallon jug 
filled with gasoline may be sufficient to set a Hummer on fire — the ecoterrorist 
hopes that this act will dissuade others from buying gas-guzzling SUVs. 
Another increasingly common terrorist choice is putting white powder in an 
envelope, meant to simulate anthrax and scare the recipient.
But in the 21st century, scientific advances have taken weapons technology 
to a whole new level, exponentially increasing the potential damage from an 
attack. Until recently, terrorists weren’t in a position to obtain the four most 
dreaded weapons, known in shorthand as CBRN:
 
✓ Chemical: Weapons made from nonliving toxic substances, such as ricin 
and mustard gas
 
✓ Biological: Weapons made from living pathogens, such as viruses and 
bacteria
 
✓ Radiological: Weapons formed from dangerous radioactive material
 
✓ Nuclear: Weapons made using nuclear energy (which is released during 
nuclear reactions), such as the atomic bomb
	
Today weapons made of these components are more easily obtained. For 
example, many countries, including some that consider the West their enemy, 
stockpile chemical and biological weapons. Radiological material is much 
more prevalent today (it can even be found in hospitals) and can be used 
in the creation of dirty bombs in which radioactive material is spread across 
populated areas by conventional explosions. And as countries that sponsor 
terrorism, such as North Korea and Iran, develop nuclear capabilities, the risk 
of a devastating nuclear strike grows.

Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Facing International Terrorist Threats
In nations throughout the world, thousands of terrorist groups pursue 
numerous causes. To achieve a designation by the U.S. government as a 
foreign terrorist organization, a group must meet these criteria:
 
✓ It must be a foreign organization.
 
✓ It must engage in terrorist activity.
 
✓ Its activity must threaten the security of U.S. nationals or the United 
States itself.
Based on their current level of exposure in the U.S. media, you may believe 
that the numbers of such groups are expanding and that their success is 
increasing. Believe it or not, however, the number of terrorist acts worldwide 
has dropped significantly since the 1980s. One reason for this drop is the 
breakup of the Soviet Union, which was infamous for sponsoring terrorism 
in its struggle against the West. Also, more countries are joining in the fight 
against terrorism.
	
But despite the decrease in numbers of terrorist acts, the terrorist threat as a 
whole has actually grown significantly in recent years as weapons of mass 
destruction have become more available to terrorists.
As of mid-2008, the U.S. Department of State had developed a list of 44 
designated foreign terrorist organizations. You can review the latest 
information on this list at http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/other/
des/123085.htm.
The majority of these groups fall into the following three categories:
 
✓ Islamic extremist groups
 
✓ Communist groups, such as the Communist Party of the Philippines
 
✓ Separatist groups interested in rebelling against their national 
government, such as the Real Irish Republican Army
	
Providing material support to any of these 44 organizations is a federal crime.
On the international scene, the United States is primarily concerned with 
Islamic extremist groups that have the capability and intent to attack U.S. 
interests. In this section, I focus on some of the most significant threats that 
confront criminal justice professionals in the Western world today.

149
 Chapter 10: Front-Page News: Terrorism
Al Qaeda
Islam is essentially divided into two groups of believers: Sunni and Shiite. 
To find out about the differences between the two, take a look at Islam For 
Dummies by Malcolm Clark (Wiley). Al Qaeda is an extremist terrorist group 
of the Sunni branch of Islam.
	
Although Al Qaeda burst into the public consciousness on 9/11, it has existed 
since 1988, growing out of the Afghanistan resistance movement opposing the 
Soviet invasion in the 1980s. Al Qaeda is an international terrorist group that 
seeks to rid Muslim countries, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia, of Western 
influences and to replace their governments with fundamentalist Islamic ones. 
Its long-term goal is to replace all governments worldwide with Islamic leaders 
who impose Islamic law, and it plans to do so by waging a holy war or jihad. 
Since its creation, Al Qaeda has been led by Osama Bin Laden.
After the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. military effectively eliminated Al Qaeda from 
its base of control in Afghanistan. Although Al Qaeda has operatives all over 
the world, today it appears that some of its leaders (including Bin Laden) 
have relocated to the mountainous region along the Pakistan-Afghanistan 
border, where they have regained some of their earlier operational capabilities.
Although Al Qaeda is best known for the 9/11 attacks, it has been linked to 
many others, including the following:
 
✓ The 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, which 
killed more than 220 people.
 
✓ The 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, which killed 17 U.S. sailors.
 
✓ The 2002 explosion near a synagogue in Tunisia, which killed 21 people.
 
✓ The 2003 car bomb attacks on buildings in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which 
killed 35 people.
 
✓ The 2004 bombings of trains in Madrid, Spain, which killed more than 
190 people. (More than 300 Islamic extremists have been arrested in 
Spain since that attack.)
 
✓ The 2005 bombing of London’s public transport system, which killed 
more than 50 people.
 
✓ The 2006 suicide bombing of the world’s largest petroleum processing 
plant in Saudi Arabia. The plot was partially thwarted but nonetheless 
killed three Saudi security officers.

150
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Because the U.S. military has repeatedly been successful at killing or capturing 
key Al Qaeda leaders, the organization has evolved accordingly. It now 
operates under a model that has become increasingly common for terrorist 
groups, in general, including U.S. domestic terrorists. Instead of a structured, 
centralized organization, Al Qaeda now appears to be a looser affiliation of 
individuals throughout the world who are connected by ideology. These 
individuals may come together for a specific action, but they also may take 
less direction from the organizational leaders. Nonetheless, formal Al Qaeda–
directed plots, such as those carried out on 9/11, continue to be a source of 
worry for counterterrorism professionals.
Autonomous terrorist cells are often made up of individuals who have 
distinct skills that contribute to terrorist acts. Some valuable terrorist skills 
include
 
✓ Acquiring weapons
 
✓ Making bombs
 
✓ Conducting surveillance or obtaining jobs at target facilities
 
✓ Obtaining false identifications
 
✓ Learning different languages
 
✓ Raising funds and/or laundering money
	
As I note earlier in the chapter, even though the frequency of terrorist attacks 
has lessened in recent years, the prevalence of weapons of mass destruction 
makes the potential impact of a terrorist strike exponentially greater than it 
was 20 years ago, when conventional weapons were the primary threat. In 
an interview in 1999, when asked about using nuclear or chemical weapons, 
Osama Bin Laden answered that it was his “religious duty” to obtain such 
weapons.
Hezbollah
Hezbollah, which means the “party of God,” is a terrorist group of the Shiite 
branch of Islam. It was formed in 1982 in response to the Israeli invasion 
of Lebanon. Hezbollah is closely allied with Iran and receives most of its 
support from that nation. The Syrian government (which is much more 
secular than Iran) also supports and encourages Hezbollah, mostly because 
Hezbollah serves its political interests, including the destabilization of Israel.
Much of the Islamic world views Hezbollah as a legitimate resistance 
operation. But aside from the 9/11 attacks by Al Qaeda, Hezbollah is 
responsible for more American deaths than any other terrorist group. If 
you’re old enough, you may remember the Hezbollah-sponsored bombing 
attacks on Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983 and on the U.S. Embassy there 

151
 Chapter 10: Front-Page News: Terrorism
in 1983 and 1984. Numerous kidnappings and murders of U.S. citizens also 
occurred in Lebanon during the 1980s.
	
Hezbollah has terrorist cells throughout the world, including in the United 
States. Given that Iran has developed intercontinental ballistic missile 
capability, and given the increasing possibility that Iran may develop nuclear 
weapon capability, these terrorist cells have the potential to become active 
should the United States or Israel make a preemptive strike against Iran.
Hamas
Hamas was formed in 1987 as part of the Palestinian uprising against Israel 
known as the Intifada. It has political and military wings and is primarily 
concerned with representing extreme Palestinian interests in attacking and 
defeating Israel. A thorough description of Hamas activity could fill volumes, 
but this group has not made a point of directly targeting U.S. interests. 
However, it launches frequent suicide and rocket attacks on Israel without 
much concern for the presence of foreigners.
The impact of Hamas in the United States comes mostly from fundraising 
efforts, ostensibly for humanitarian needs, such as to take care of orphans. 
Most people don’t realize that such donations are often promised to 
“martyrs” (suicide bombers, for example) to take care of their families after 
the bombers die. So a charitable contribution to take care of an orphan may 
do so, but the orphan may be the child of a suicide bomber. Hamas and 
other terrorist organizations use this money to induce young Palestinians to 
commit terrorist acts with the promise that their families will be provided for.
Dealing with Domestic Antigovernment 
Groups
When law enforcement officials refer to “antigovernment extremists,” they 
generally aren’t talking about Islamic extremists who are also U.S. citizens 
(who are an ongoing threat). Instead, they’re typically referring to non-
Islamic groups, such as militias and sovereign citizen movements, that reject 
the authority of the federal government or state and local governments. 
Antigovernment groups give action to their beliefs primarily in two ways — 
through violent crimes and through paper crimes. I discuss these crimes in 
more detail in the following sections.
	
Keep in mind that the United States has a long history of antigovernment 
movements. After all, the country was founded through a violent revolution 
against an oppressive British government.

152
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Identifying violent threats
Any discussion of antigovernment domestic terrorism must begin with the 
April 19, 1995, truck bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City that 
killed 168 people. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols bombed the building to 
protest U.S. government intervention with right-wing groups at Ruby Ridge, 
Idaho, and Waco, Texas. Prior to 9/11, the Oklahoma City bombing was the 
deadliest terrorist act committed within the United States.
Some other antigovernment causes that lead people to violence include the 
fear that gun rights may be taken away and — believe it or not — the fear 
that the United Nations will take over the United States. (One county in my 
home state actually passed a law declaring itself a “UN-free zone.”)
At least two types of antigovernment organizations pose significant threats 
for committing violent criminal acts:
 
✓ Sovereign citizen organizations: These groups often apply convoluted 
interpretations of the Constitution to deny federal and state governments 
any authority over individuals. They may create their own driver’s 
licenses and license plates, and even their own passports. They may 
also resist the authority of law enforcement, refuse to pay taxes, and 
threaten public officials.
 
✓ Militia organizations: These groups pass themselves off as quasi-
military or law enforcement. They may stockpile weapons, participate in 
“weapons training” in rural areas, wear uniforms, and claim to patrol the 
forest or even the U.S. border.
In addition to threatening the lives of U.S. citizens, such groups can cause 
significant damage in pursuit of their goals. For example, some antigovernment 
groups hoped that as the nation’s computer system rolled over from the year 
1999 to 2000, the governmental infrastructure would collapse. Some of these 
folks took direct action to help the process along by damaging phone lines 
and electrical infrastructure.
Although there seems to have been a decrease in antigovernment terrorist 
strikes since 2001, the FBI reports that of the 14 terrorist strikes prevented 
between 2002 and 2005, 8 were planned by right-wing antigovernment 
types — not by Islamic extremists.
Using paper crimes
By all definitions, terrorism requires an act of violence. Nonetheless, 
nonviolent crimes committed in preparation for terrorist strikes are still 
considered terrorism. For example, an antigovernment group that creates 
false IDs may be attempting to gain access to a secure facility like an airport 

153
 Chapter 10: Front-Page News: Terrorism
or power station to commit a violent act, and, thus, the act of creating false 
IDs is considered a precursor crime to terrorism. Police are taught to look for 
precursor crimes so they can prevent the ultimate terrorist acts.
In addition, members of antigovernment groups may attempt to harass 
public figures (sheriffs or legislators, for example) by filing false liens or 
claims in which they assert that the public figure owes them money. Another 
common trick is for antigovernment types to file false documents with the 
IRS, asserting that the public figure received a multi-million-dollar income. 
(This last trick can wreak havoc on the public figure’s tax situation.)
Starting around 1999, a movement called redemption swept across the 
country. This scheme is almost impossible to understand, but essentially, it 
asserts that you can create a second you, known as a fictional STRAW MAN 
(there’s some kind of significance in using all capital letters), and the 
government is responsible for all the debts of your straw man. Some 
unscrupulous characters have made a lot of money pushing this scam, 
which is why it greatly appeals to antigovernment extremists. It continues to 
be very common today.
Focusing on Single-Issue Terrorists
Some domestic terrorist groups aren’t necessarily considered antigovernment. 
Instead, they’re consumed with a single cause, such as protecting animal 
rights, saving the environment, or preventing the murder of unborn children. 
These single-issue terrorists sometimes turn to violence in the hopes of 
achieving their social or political goals.
Committing crimes to save animals
Many groups advocate against cruelty to animals, but some people on the 
fringes of these groups resort to violence in the name of protecting animals. 
For example, the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) has taken credit for firebombs 
on facilities such as meat-packing plants and on federal wild-horse corrals. 
ALF, like other single-interest groups, is more of a movement than a real 
organization. It consists of loosely affiliated individuals who come together 
in cells to commit terrorist acts and then disband — a situation that makes 
observation and infiltration by law enforcement difficult.
Animal rights’ terrorists often target mink farms, releasing minks and 
destroying breeding records. (They may also attempt to release other 
animals, such as rats and monkeys.) Ironically, massive mink releases 
usually result in the deaths of those minks because they’re domesticated 
and can’t survive in the wild.

154
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Increasingly, animal rights’ terrorists focus attention on businesses and 
schools that use animals for testing pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, pesticides, 
and the like. In 2008, for example, animal researchers in California had their 
homes’ windows broken, cars scratched, and paint thrown on their houses 
and, in one case, a car and house were firebombed. In one incident, six 
masked intruders even attempted to invade an animal researcher’s home 
during her daughter’s birthday party. At one university, shotgun shells were 
repeatedly rammed into the mufflers of numerous school vans.
Some animal rights’ terrorists focus attention on a corporation called 
Huntington Life Sciences, which provides a vast array of research and test­
ing services that often involve animals. A group known as Stop Huntington 
Animal Cruelty (SHAC) frequently targets other corporations that do busi­
ness with Huntington Life Sciences. The acts may be small, such as forcing a 
business to pay return postage on an empty letter, but they may also include 
firebombs and threats of physical violence.
Fighting for the environment
Ecoterrorists, like animal rights’ terrorists, are less likely to participate in 
structured organizations and more likely to come together to form tempo­
rary cells for specific terrorist acts. The Earth Liberation Front (ELF) is one 
of the more prominent umbrella groups that take credit for terrorist acts in 
the name of the environment. For example, ecoterrorists may leave a sign at 
the scene by spray-painting the letters ELF. Or they may issue a statement 
through an environmental group sympathetic to ELF.
In the late 1990s, ELF firebombs across the western United States resulted 
in millions of dollars of damage to U.S. Forest Service buildings, lumber 
industry buildings, genetically engineered forest products, car dealerships, 
resorts, and housing developments. In operation “Backfire,” one of the most 
successful anti–domestic terrorist investigations in U.S. history, the FBI and 
local law enforcement agencies identified the members of the cell responsible 
for many of these acts and, after many years of investigation, brought them 
to justice. Nonetheless, ELF and other environmental terrorists continue to 
strike. Some common tactics include:
 
✓ Tree spiking: Ecoterrorists drive railroad spikes into trees targeted for 
logging. If a chainsaw bites into a spike, a logger can be killed.
 
✓ Monkey wrenching: Ecoterrorists vandalize heavy equipment left at 
logging or construction sites.
 
✓ Firebombing: Ecoterrorists fill containers with fuel and then set them 
on fire with a delayed fuse.
 
✓ Vandalizing SUVs: Ecoterrorists target SUVs because they aren’t 
fuel-efficient.

155
 Chapter 10: Front-Page News: Terrorism
 
✓ Targeting homes and property: The primary targets are corporate 
officials deemed unfriendly to the environment, such as people who lead 
power and logging companies and the bankers who do business with 
them.
Since 2000, more than 140 ecoterrorist acts have occurred in the United 
States. One of the more severe attacks occurred in 2003 in San Diego. A five-
story apartment building under construction was destroyed by a fire, resulting 
in damages of $50 million. A banner nearby declared, “If you build it, we will 
burn it, the ELFs are mad.”
	
There may be significant crossover between ecoterrorists and animal rights’ 
terrorists because they’re frequently sympathetic to each other’s causes. 
Training events in direct actions — a phrase terrorists use for specific acts — 
often involve people from both camps.
Targeting abortion
Since 2000, there have been approximately 26 attacks on abortion clinics 
in the United States. These attacks have involved explosive devices, gun 
shots into clinics, letters containing white powder (initially assumed to be 
anthrax), arson, and even car crashes into clinics.
Unlike animal rights’ terrorists or ecoterrorists, antiabortion terrorists often 
act alone, seeking to shut down a clinic or make its operation unprofitable. 
Such terrorists may justify their actions by arguing that shutting down a 
clinic even temporarily prevents abortions, and every abortion prevented is 
a life saved.
It appears that the number of attacks on abortion clinics has diminished 
since 9/11. However, in 2009, a Kansas physician who performed late-term 
abortions (a particularly controversial procedure) was shot to death on a 
Sunday morning while attending his church.
One of the most notorious antiabortion terrorists is Eric Rudolph. He’s 
perhaps best known for setting off a bomb at the 1996 Summer Olympics 
in Atlanta, Georgia, which killed two people. But he also bombed several 
abortion clinics across the South, killing one other person. His bombs were 
made of dynamite with numerous nails attached as shrapnel. Rudolph 
remained at large for over five years before a North Carolina police officer 
apprehended him in 2003 while Rudolph was rummaging through a garbage 
can. Rudolph pled guilty to all charged crimes and was sentenced to life in 
federal prison.

156
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Acting out of hate
Hating someone isn’t a crime. Nor does it constitute terrorism. But individuals 
and groups that harbor racist, antireligious, or homophobic views sometimes 
give action to their hate by committing violence against others, which is 
where hate crimes come in.
	
A hate crime is a crime committed because of the race, religion, or sexual 
orientation of the victim. Most states today have created separate crimes that 
punish violence more severely when it’s motivated by hate.
Many hate crimes don’t fit the strict definition of terrorism that I give you at 
the beginning of this chapter — for one, racist attacks often aren’t driven by a 
desire to change governmental or social policy. A drunk white kid who strikes 
out at an African American woman in a convenience store, for example, is 
more likely just filled with hate. But some groups do advocate racist violence, 
and because they are attempting to achieve a social objective, they can fairly 
be considered terrorist organizations.
The FBI documented 7,624 hate crime incidents in the United States in 2007. 
About 64 percent of victims were targeted because of their race, ethnicity, or 
national origin. Seventeen percent were targeted because of their religious 
belief and 16 percent because of their sexual orientation.
Numerous groups in the United States espouse various views about one 
person’s superiority over another person. The Southern Poverty Law 
Center (SPLC), a nonprofit organization devoted to fighting hate groups, 
has documented 888 active hate groups in the United States. Keep in mind, 
though, that the SPLC takes an expansive view of the term “hate group,” 
including organizations opposed to illegal immigration, among others. Thus, 
inclusion on the SPLC list doesn’t mean a group is a terrorist organization. 
But prominent in the list are numerous neo-Nazi organizations, various 
groups claiming affiliation with the Ku Klux Klan, and racist Skinhead groups. 
Some of these groups advocate for violent action against groups of people 
they hate.
	
These groups are becoming more sophisticated in their recruitment of 
members. They may use social networking sites on the Internet to reach out 
to like-minded youngsters. I’ve seen white-supremacist Web sites that contain 
video games in which a player can kill blacks or Jews. Clearly, these sites 
are designed to appeal to kids. In addition, there’s a relatively large white-
supremacist music industry. Bands that celebrate white-supremacist views 
may play at organizational rallies to draw recruits. Some hate groups even fill 
Easter eggs with racist propaganda and distribute the eggs on school yards.

157
 Chapter 10: Front-Page News: Terrorism
Fighting Back against Terrorism
From a criminological perspective, it’s worth noting that terrorism combines 
two elements:
 
✓ Motivation: A desire to strike out in violence to achieve a terrorist goal
 
✓ Operational capability: The people and the tools necessary to commit a 
terrorist act
To successfully fight against terrorism, you have to eliminate at least one of 
these two elements. In the following sections, I take a closer look at these 
elements and how the U.S. government is trying to combat them.
Eliminating terrorist motivation
All kinds of people desire significant change in governmental or social policy. 
But what leads them to use terrorism, and how can the U.S. government 
combat such extreme motivation? If I knew the answers, I’d have the formula 
for world peace. But even though no perfect answers have been discovered, 
society can gain some insight by looking at the last 30 years in the Islamic 
world.
Since about 1980 (coinciding with the creation of groups like Al Qaeda 
in Afghanistan and the rise of the Ayatollah in Iran), Islamic extremists 
have been pouring money and resources into reshaping the minds of Arab 
Muslims. For example, rich benefactors, such as Osama Bin Laden, have 
funded the creation of thousands of Wahabi schools — which teach Al 
Qaeda’s fundamentalist view of Sunni Islam — with the goal of spreading 
Islamic law and dominance throughout the world. In addition, Islamic 
extremists have worked hard to build resentment throughout the Islamic 
world against the West, against Israel, and against moderate Islamic regimes 
that are supported by the West, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
The result of these schools and this resentment has been thousands of 
people willing to carry suicide bombs and die to achieve their goal. (One of 
the tools used to motivate suicide bombers is the promise of 70 virgins in 
heaven for a shahid, or martyr of the faith.) Fighting this motivation is a 
challenge in the extreme, but, in the long run, success in the war on terror 
will depend on reducing the resentment and anger toward the West by using 
tools such as education and economic development.

158
Part II: Identifying Types of Crime 
Eliminating operational capability: 
Law enforcement’s role
In the short run, the U.S. military and local, state, and federal law enforcement 
officials carry the burden of preventing terrorism. The 9/11 Commission (a 
group created by Congress to study the failure to stop the 9/11 attacks) 
identified some serious lapses in the fight against terror, but none is more 
important than the need for everyone involved in the fight to share information. 
Before September 11, 2001, not only did the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
not talk to the FBI, but different branches within one agency didn’t talk to 
each other. And federal communication with local law enforcement on the 
issue of terrorism was minimal at best.
As a result of 9/11, the federal government has significantly changed its 
strategy. Mechanisms for sharing foreign intelligence with federal law 
enforcement are now in place. Federal agencies communicate with each 
other much more. And significant inroads have been made in developing 
communication between local law enforcement agencies and their federal 
counterparts.
	
In particular, the development of Fusion Centers — state-based operations 
that “fuse” together personnel from many different agencies — is having a 
big impact on the fight against terrorism. In essence, Fusion Centers bring 
together intelligence personnel to share information among different agencies 
within a state. The goal is to break down the walls of communication between 
local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies so that the next 9/11 can be 
identified before it occurs. Today, if a patrol officer stops a suspicious person 
with a bag of ammonium nitrate (fertilizer that’s also used in making bombs), 
the officer can call his Fusion Center to find out whether that person is a 
terrorist suspect.
While Fusion Centers help gather and analyze information, the FBI has taken 
the lead in conducting actual investigations. The FBI has made terrorism its 
number one priority and has put significant resources into its Joint Terrorism 
Task Force program (JTTF). This program, replicated throughout the country, 
combines police from numerous agencies into a single task force to investigate 
terrorist activities. These task forces are the primary investigative tool 
against terrorism within U.S. borders, and since 9/11, they’ve been very 
successful.
Despite the significant improvement in cooperation among law enforcement 
agencies, many challenges still exist. Trust, information sharing, and 
cooperation don’t come easily in the world of law enforcement. Much 
depends on personal relationships, and given the fact that cops spend a 
lot of time with liars and crooks, building trust is a full-time, never-ending 
challenge.

Part III
Figuring Out Who 
Commits Crimes 
and Why

In this part . . .
O

ne of the central concerns of criminology is figuring 
out why people commit crimes. Over the years, 
many people have developed theories to try to answer 
this question. In fact, the number of theories of why 
people commit crimes sometimes seems to equal the 
number of criminologists. In this part, I discuss the major 
criminological theories and their applications in the real 
world.
Do most criminals act rationally after weighing the costs 
of crime versus the benefits? Is society ever to blame for 
driving an individual to commit a crime? Do mental diseases 
or even genetics factor into a person’s attraction to a life 
of crime? I explore these questions and much more in the 
chapters that follow.

Chapter 11
What Factors Lead to Crime?
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying personal traits that increase criminality
▶ Looking at whether pop culture and the economy affect crime
▶ Keeping an eye on the thermometer and evaluating the weather’s effect on crime
C

riminal justice students and crime-show fans alike are fascinated with 
the reasons why people commit crime. This may help explain why 
authors like John Grisham and Dean Koontz and TV shows like CSI: Crime 
Scene Investigation and Law & Order are so popular.
There are many factors that influence the likelihood that someone will 
become involved in crime. In this chapter, I discuss some of the more 
interesting ones, including age, race, neighborhood, pop culture, genetics, 
and even weather.
Noting Personal Characteristics That 
Many Criminals Share
Here’s what cops know from experience: Certain people in certain circumstances 
are more likely than others to get involved in criminal conduct.
One day a police officer and I were walking down the street when we saw a 
young man skateboard past us. The cop told me that when he sees a man in 
his mid-20s riding a skateboard, he can almost guarantee the man has drugs 
on him. From what he’d observed in his profession, the cop was making 
some additional, unstated assumptions about the skateboarder’s personal 
characteristics:

162
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
 
✓ He probably doesn’t have a car.
 
✓ He probably doesn’t have a good job, or even any job.
 
✓ He probably doesn’t have a wife and kids.
 
✓ He probably doesn’t have a college degree.
 
✓ He probably participates in street culture, which is heavily associated 
with drug use.
Of course, police have to back up these kinds of generalizations (called 
profiling by people in the know) with evidence before they can bring any 
charges against someone. And police must be very careful to appropriately 
evaluate all available information before they compromise someone’s rights 
with a generalization.
Unfortunately, profiling has become something of a dirty word in law 
enforcement because of its association with an unconstitutional practice 
known as racial profiling. Racial profiling is making assumptions about 
someone’s likelihood to commit crime based solely on the person’s race. 
See the “Race: Does skin color influence criminality, or is racism to blame?” 
section for more details about racial profiling.)
Despite this negative connotation, however, profiling is a crucial tool in the 
fight against crime because, as I explain in this section, certain personal 
characteristics do indicate that someone may be more likely to get involved 
in criminal activity.
Age: Seeing crime as a 
young person’s game
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI’s) arrest statistics, 
in 2007, 16 percent of arrests for violent crime and 26 percent of arrests 
for property crime involved people 18 years old or younger. As Figure 11-1 
shows, the age at which someone is most likely to be arrested for any type 
of crime is 18 or 19. And as I point out in Chapter 3, arrest statistics may not 
paint a completely accurate picture, so juvenile crime is likely even higher 
than what this figure shows. One reason for the discrepancy is that juveniles 
who commit offenses are often returned to their parents without being for­
mally arrested.

Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
So, why exactly are young people more likely to commit crime than older 
people? Well, a few factors are at play here, including the following:
 
✓ As any old person (such as me) can tell you, the younger you are, the 
more energy you have. So, as people get older, they simply don’t have 
the energy they once did to commit crimes.
 
✓ To be blunt, the younger you are, the stupider you are. Sometimes young 
people do dumb things that older, wiser people don’t do. In particular, 
young people generally find delaying gratification or resisting tempta­
tion difficult to do. As a result, they’re more likely to seek a quick 
thrill — perhaps by committing a crime — without weighing the risks or 
consequences.
	
	Young people often make poor choices because they are assuming more 
responsibility and freedom even as their brains are still undergoing sig­
nificant development. Recent studies have shown that an adolescent’s 
brain doesn’t fully mature until the person is between 22 and 25 (check 
out Chapter 14 for more on brain development and Chapter 22 for more 
on dealing with juvenile crime).
 
✓ As people get older, they’re more likely to have families, which demand 
more stable lifestyles. Having a spouse and children means spending 
less time skateboarding with friends on the street and more time making 
a living and providing for your family.
Gender: Men take first place in crime
Which gender commits more crime is no mystery. In 2007, 75 percent of 
all arrests involved men. Men accounted for 82 percent of all violent crime 
arrests and 67 percent of property crime arrests.
When a woman goes to commit a crime, chances are high that she’ll commit a 
property crime. In 2007, women committed slightly more embezzlement than 
men and were arrested for 44 percent of all fraud, 40 percent of all theft, and 
38 percent of forgeries.
According to recent trends, women appear to be increasing their presence in 
the criminal community: Between 1998 and 2007, the overall crime rate for 
men dropped 6 percent, but the crime rate for women increased almost 
7 percent.
	
As crime rates for men drop and rates for women rise, it seems very likely that 
sociological factors are at play. For example, as women gain more prominent 
professional positions, they have greater opportunity to commit embezzlement, 
which explains why the percent of women arrested for embezzlement 
increased by 30 percent between 1998 and 2007.

165
 Chapter 11: What Factors Lead to Crime?
Nonetheless, men still take the prize for committing the most crime mostly 
because, quite simply, men are different from women. To a significant degree, 
the differences between male and female traits are the results of hormonal 
differences. For instance, men are generally physically bigger and more 
aggressive than women, and they often lack certain female-attributed traits, 
such as compassion, empathy, and the need to nurture — all traits that don’t 
easily correlate with violating someone else’s rights through crime.
Hormones aside, criminologists hotly debate why women commit fewer 
crimes than men. Some criminologists, including those who subscribe to 
feminist criminological theory, contend that the difference can be explained 
by how boys and girls are raised (see Chapter 15 for more on this theory). 
These criminologists argue that boys are trained to be physical, dominant, 
and more aggressive, while girls are rewarded for exhibiting stereotypically 
feminine virtues. (All I know is that, contrary to my best efforts, my daughter 
showed much greater interest in dolls and ballet than she did in football.)
Income: Does less money in your 
pocket lead to more crime?
The FBI compiles the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) after receiving crime-related 
statistics from police agencies across the United States. (Check out Chapter 3 
for more on the UCR.) Unfortunately, the UCR doesn’t contain information 
about the income of criminal offenders. However, it does track information 
about the location of crimes. And in doing so, it shows that typically lower-
income regions, such as inner cities, have higher crime rates than more 
affluent areas, such as suburbs.
To explain the difference in crime rates between lower- and higher-income 
areas, criminologists have developed various theories, including the following:
 
✓ Police often spend more time in poorer areas. Therefore, they’re 
more likely to arrest criminals in poorer neighborhoods than affluent 
businessmen in big, shiny offices.
 
✓ Lower-income areas often experience higher rates of drug use than more 
affluent areas, and drug use correlates to higher crime rates.
 
✓ The quality of schools is often lower where incomes are lower, and 
lower-quality education often leads to higher crime rates. (See the 
“Education: Higher degrees equal lower crime rates” section for more 
details.)
 
✓ In lower-income areas, people are often unable to land well-paying jobs, 
and people who don’t spend their days working and earning money are 
more likely to commit crime.

166
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
 
✓ People who struggle with impulse control are more likely to live in 
poorer neighborhoods because they have a tougher time holding on to 
well-paying jobs. These same people are more likely to commit crime, 
too, because poor impulse control increases the chances that someone 
will commit crime.
I discuss these criminological theories in greater detail in Chapters 12 
through 15.
	
In 1978, Charles Tittle, Wayne Villemez, and Douglas Smith conducted a 
significant study that looked at self-reporting of crimes by people in different 
social classes. (Self-reporting means the person who committed the crime 
reports on himself to the criminologist doing the study — not the cops!) 
The study concluded that there’s little evidence that a person’s social class 
influences crime statistics. However, other criminologists disagree, arguing 
that the study placed too great an emphasis on low-level offenses. They argue 
that although rich kids may be just as likely as poor kids to be caught drinking, 
shoplifting, and using drugs, lower-class neighborhoods have higher crime 
rates for serious felonies than upper-class neighborhoods.
The bottom line is that criminologists haven’t been able to draw any 
definitive conclusions about income as a crime-causing factor; however, 
living in a low-income area does seem to correlate with higher crime rates.
Instead of looking at income levels, some studies have shifted the focus to 
parental control and discipline and have concluded that these factors are 
much more predictive of criminality than either income or social class. In 
other words, these studies point out that kids whose parents or other 
guardians watch them more closely and actively discipline them are less 
likely to grow up to commit serious crime, regardless of the neighborhood 
they live in. I discuss this theory of crime control in detail in Chapter 13.
	
Related to income, the section “A bad economy: Does recession lead to 
crime?” looks at the effects of the economy on criminality.
Race: Does skin color influence criminality, 
or is racism to blame?
In 2007, 28 percent of all people arrested were African American. The overall U.S. 
population is about 12 percent African American. The question of whether 
the disproportionate arrest rate for African Americans is the result of racial 
bias is an extremely sensitive one for communities, law enforcement, and 
criminologists. In fact, few issues in criminology have been the subject of 
more statistical studies than racism in law enforcement.

167
 Chapter 11: What Factors Lead to Crime?
Consider the fact that African Americans had an even higher arrest rate — 
39 percent — for all serious violent offenses in 2007. Is it possible that insti­
tutionalized racism means that blacks get arrested for serious violent crime 
much more often than whites? Many criminologists doubt that police under-
investigate serious offenses, such as robberies, rapes, and murders, perpe­
trated by white criminals. These criminologists contend that racial bias in 
the criminal justice system is no longer highly prevalent and that the higher 
arrest rate just reflects a higher offense rate by African Americans.
In contrast, other criminologists attribute the disproportionate arrest rate 
to discriminatory processes that are ingrained in the U.S. justice system. 
These criminologists suggest that racism isn’t overt today like it was decades 
ago. Instead, racism is institutionalized so that African Americans are more 
likely to be stopped and questioned, more likely to be arrested, less likely to 
receive bail, and more likely to receive longer sentences than similarly situ­
ated white people.
	
Minority communities often point out situations when police officers pull 
over African American or Hispanic people for minor driving infractions that 
seem unwarranted. Minority and civil rights’ activists accuse police of pulling 
people over for “driving while black” or “driving while Hispanic.” They assert 
that the police are racially profiling — assuming that an African American or 
Hispanic person is more likely to be engaged in criminal conduct than a white 
person.
Taking a closer look at racial profiling
Profiling can certainly be a useful technique in law enforcement because it 
helps police understand what kind of suspect to look for in connection with 
certain crimes. Some large agencies, including the FBI, even have profil­
ing experts who look for personal characteristics that are common among 
people who commit a certain crime. For example, psychopathic murderers 
often have a history of juvenile delinquency, animal abuse, and fire setting.
Racial profiling, on the other hand, takes place when a police officer draws con­
clusions about someone based solely on race or ethnicity. Clearly, practicing 
racial profiling is illegal. Civil rights’ organizations have filed numerous lawsuits 
over the last 40 years, alleging that police officers engage in such practices. 
For example, in 2008, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Maryland 
entered a settlement with the Maryland State Police over allegations that state 
police pulled over men on the freeway because of their race. The state police 
department paid a cash settlement and agreed to hire an independent consul­
tant to make sure the agency didn’t engage in racial profiling.
Such lawsuits often end in consent decrees. A consent decree is an order from 
a federal court demanding that a police agency take a specific action. For 
example, an agency may be forced to monitor all its traffic stops to look for 
evidence of racial profiling.

168
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
These days, I’m not aware of any police agency that engages in racial profiling 
by policy. However, civil rights’ organizations still fear that individual cops 
engage in the practice or that an unofficial culture within a police agency may 
encourage it. I know of at least one city that has responded to these fears 
by requiring its officers to hand out business cards after each traffic stop. 
Doing so makes filing a complaint against the officer easier for the citizen to 
do if she feels like the officer violated her rights. Many police agencies gather 
racial statistics from every traffic stop to look for signs or patterns of mis­
treatment of minorities.
Fear of civil rights’ lawsuits has significantly changed police practices in 
many parts of the country. In one medium-sized town with an anti-law-
enforcement reputation and a very small minority community, some police 
report that they’re very reluctant to pull over someone from a minority 
community for fear of being sued. Although this situation is likely an over­
reaction, most cops do resent the assertion that they’re racist. As a result, 
many communities have tension between their minority citizens, who believe 
they’re being mistreated, and the police, who assert that they’re just trying to 
do their jobs.
Examining cultural challenges
If institutionalized racism within the justice system can’t explain all the dis­
parity in arrest statistics, what can? Well, some criminologists believe that 
the amount of crime committed within any group of people reflects certain 
cultural challenges. For example, roughly 68 percent of African American chil­
dren in 2005 were born to single mothers. This statistic reflects a significant, 
steady increase from the mid-1960s when the rate was only about 25 percent. 
(For comparison’s sake, 25 percent of white children were born out of wed­
lock in 2005.)
The absence of a second parent in a home likely has an impact on income, 
educational opportunities, and the oversight and discipline of children. 
Single-parent families are more likely than two-parent families to be poor and 
live in higher crime areas, and, as a result, children in these families are at 
greater risk of joining youth with similar backgrounds in delinquent behavior. 
I discuss the negative impacts of poor neighborhoods, bad peer groups, and 
dysfunctional families on criminality in Chapter 13.
It’s interesting to note that Asian Americans accounted for just under 1 per­
cent of all arrests in 2007, although they represent about 5 percent of the U.S. 
population. Some criminologists explain this disparity using the social disor­
ganization theory, which I discuss in more detail in Chapter 13. In essence, 
this theory holds that people living in a disorganized society (one with dys­
functional schools and high rates of vandalism and unemployment) are more 
likely to be involved in criminal conduct. According to this theory, Asian 
Americans don’t commit as many crimes because Asian culture is highly 
structured and goal oriented.

169
 Chapter 11: What Factors Lead to Crime?
Education: Higher degrees 
equal lower crime rates
The more education a person has, the less likely she is to commit a crime. But 
the education itself doesn’t lead a person away from a life of crime. Rather, many 
crucial elements often accompany a good education, including the following:
 
✓ Better jobs
 
✓ The chance to live in better neighborhoods with better schools
 
✓ Perhaps less exposure to delinquents
Another important benefit of school is that it offers a great opportunity for 
juveniles to develop social bonds. Social activities, such as playing sports, 
playing in a band, or acting with a theater group, all build relationships that 
correlate with lower crime rates. Kids who drop out of school, on the other 
hand, are less likely to develop social bonds, at least in a noncriminal context.
Dropouts still look for social relationships, of course, but they’re more likely 
to develop them with other kids who are marginalized from school. Thus, 
joining a gang, or just “hanging out” after school (when most crimes are 
committed), becomes an attractive alternative. Chapter 13 dives into this 
topic in greater detail.
Religious affiliation: The benefits 
of practicing a faith
The hellfire hypothesis suggests that religion decreases crime because 
believers fear being damned for misbehaving. I’m not sure how valuable 
this theory is, but studies have shown a correlation between attendance at 
religious services and a reduced likelihood of committing crime. People who 
make the effort to attend religious services are more likely to take seriously 
the teachings of their religions. And few religions advocate for the commission 
of crime. These studies may also reflect the value of an additional layer of 
social bonds that churchgoers develop.
Criminologists have also done studies on the differences in crime rates 
among religions. In general, Jews had the lowest crime rate, followed by 
Protestants. Catholics had the highest rate among religious affiliations. 
However, these distinctions have been criticized because, generally speaking, 
each of these groups consists of slightly different social classes. For example, 
Catholics have a higher percentage of new immigrants to the United States, 
as well as lower-income minorities. With these social differences in mind, 
some criminologists have concluded that social class is more meaningful in 
predicting criminality than which type of church a person attends.

170
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
Looking at the Impact of Societal 
Conditions on Crime
In this section, I discuss a couple of frequently cited causes of crime: pop 
culture (including movies, TV, music, and video games) and a bad economy. 
I also look at differences between city and country areas in terms of the 
number of crimes committed.
Pop culture: Inspiring violence 
through entertainment
In 2003, 24-year-old Ronell Wilson of New York City shot two undercover 
detectives in the backs of their heads, killing them. When police arrested him, 
they found in his pants pocket the following rap lyrics: “Leave a 45 slugs in da 
back of ya head. Cause I’m getting dat bread, ain’t goin stop to I’m dead.” In 
2006, a jury convicted Wilson of various counts of murder and sentenced him 
to death. Was the fantasy life of gangsta rap a motivation for Wilson to kill the 
two detectives?
Ever since Elvis Presley first started gyrating his hips, people have complained 
about the impact of pop culture on youth. But medical science didn’t begin 
to study whether pop culture makes kids more violent until the mid-1970s. 
Recent studies have estimated that the average child will see more than 
18,000 murders and 250,000 acts of violence on TV and at the movies before 
he or she graduates from high school. And this statistic doesn’t even touch 
the influence of violent video games and song lyrics.
What’s the effect of being exposed to violence in pop culture? Numerous 
studies have shown that children, who are still developing their value sys­
tems and learning how to solve problems, may become desensitized to 
violence after so much exposure. They may also come to see violence as an 
appropriate way to resolve conflict, and, perhaps as Ronell Wilson did, they 
may come to identify with fictional violent characters. Certain conduct, such 
as shooting cops in the back of the head, may come across as cool.
I have to point out, though, that most kids who watch violent TV shows and 
movies, play aggressive video games, and listen to misogynistic music don’t 
engage in criminal violence. But a growing body of research seems to indicate 
that some kids are at greater risk for turning to crime when they’re exposed 
repeatedly to such media.

171
 Chapter 11: What Factors Lead to Crime?
A bad economy: Does recession 
lead to crime?
When the United States goes into a recession and people lose their jobs in 
large numbers, does the crime rate rise? It seems logical that unemployed 
people would be more likely to steal or commit other crimes just to survive. 
However, the evidence doesn’t support this assertion. The truth is that crimi­
nologists don’t know exactly what the economy’s impact on crime really is.
	
While the U.S. economy prospered in the 1960s, the nation’s homicide rate 
rose 43 percent. Yet, in the mid-1990s when the U.S. economy was again 
prospering, the nation’s crime rate began to fall.
When looking at what causes crime, criminologists have so many variables 
to consider that they simply can’t isolate the economy as a cause. Figure 11-2 
shows the complete lack of correlation. The fact that the national economy 
changes nationally may be one explanation of this lack of correlation. For 
example, a recession, more or less, hits all 50 states. Crime trends, on the 
other hand, tend to occur locally. Murder rates in St. Louis may be near 
record-high levels at the same time that they’re dropping in Atlanta.
Here are two opposing but fairly logical theories that attempt to explain the 
relationship between the economy and crime rates (note that neither theory 
has a lot of statistical support):
 
✓ Unemployed people, especially young men, have more free time, which 
can lead to mischief, criminality, or even illegal jobs, such as selling 
drugs.
 
✓ Severe economic downturns, like the Great Depression, bring families 
together, which results in a decrease in crime.
Another possible connection is that higher crime rates may actually lead to 
higher unemployment. For example, a 19-year-old man convicted of burglary 
will find it very difficult to get a job when he finishes his sentence. The higher 
the crime rate in a certain area (and the more 19-year-olds convicted of crime 
in that area), the more unemployed people there are. So, in a way, high rates 
of school dropouts, broken families, and other causes of crime may actually 
hurt the economy.
One conclusion that criminologists have been able to make about economy 
and crime is that, generally (but not always), for every 1 percent increase in 
the unemployment rate, the rate of burglaries goes up 2 percent. But given all 
the discussion among politicians and media pundits about the relationship 
between the economy and crime, it’s interesting to see that the rhetoric isn’t 
based on much evidence.

 Chapter 11: What Factors Lead to Crime?
Your zip code: Identifying regional 
differences in crime rates
Crime rates vary depending on where you live within the United States. 
Contrary to what you see on TV about the “mean streets” of northeastern 
cities, the Northeast is the safest place to live, followed by the West and then 
the Midwest. The South has more crime per capita than any other region. 
Figure 11-3 shows you what I mean.
The South has consistently had higher crime rates than any other part of the 
country (although in 2007, the West actually had the highest violent crime 
rate). The regional differences in crime rates across the United States, which 
have been fairly consistent over time, have led some criminologists to con­
clude that regional culture must play a role in the commission of crime.
Beyond just regional differences, crime rates also differ depending on 
whether you live in the city or the country. Generally, as the population 
density increases, so does the crime rate, a fact that’s particularly true for 
violent crime.
	
But it’s not just the crime rate that differs from rural to urban areas. The 
cultural values that impact law enforcement differ, too. In my experience in 
my own state, folks who live in the country seem to value independence and 
self-reliance very highly. Thus, rural police may be more likely than city police 
to believe that someone used a gun in self-defense. (I’ve heard the following 
statement about a homicide victim in a rural county: “He was a guy who 
needed killin’.”)
These cultural and value differences may be slowly disappearing, however. 
As cable and satellite TV access has expanded in the past 20 years, pop 
culture has become thoroughly available in rural communities as well as 
in the city. And as drug traffickers become more sophisticated, many rural 
communities have been fully exposed to the negative effects of narcotics, 
too. In fact, because rural areas often lack even basic drug treatment and law 
enforcement resources, the impact of drug crime in rural areas may even be 
greater than it is in big cities.

 Chapter 11: What Factors Lead to Crime?
Gun control as crime control?
A heated criminological controversy deals with 
whether gun ownership can or does reduce 
crime. On the one hand, criminologists who 
favor gun control — laws regulating or restrict­
ing the possession of firearms — point to the 
fact that guns are involved in a high percentage 
of crimes. For example, in 2005, 71 percent of all 
homicides involved firearms. These criminolo­
gists contend that by making guns more difficult 
to obtain, society can reduce their availability 
and, thus, reduce their use in crime. An exam­
ple of gun control in action is the Brady Law, 
which requires a five-day waiting period before 
a person may purchase a handgun.
On the other hand, some criminologists con­
tend that gun ownership prevents crime. They 
point out that no study has shown a correlation 
between gun control and lower violent crime 
rates and that a person in possession of a fire­
arm can actually prevent a crime simply by 
flashing the weapon. For example, in 2002 at the 
Appalachian School of Law in Virginia, a former 
student killed three people and wounded three 
others. Sounds like a good reason for gun con­
trol, right? Not exactly. Often not reported about 
the tragedy is the fact that two students ran to 
their vehicles, retrieved their personal guns, 
and confronted the killer, who then surrendered. 
Roughly 40 states have laws permitting citizens 
to carry concealed handguns if they have per­
mits from a local law enforcement agency, and 
the violent crime rates in those states are no 
greater than the rates in states that don’t permit 
the carrying of guns.
An eye-opening 1994 national survey con­
ducted by Florida State University professors 
Marc Gertz and Gary Kleck found that people 
in the United States used a gun defensively 
as often as 2.5 million times in one year. The 
National Institute for Justice sponsored a fol­
low-up survey published in 1997 that found the 
estimated number of defensive uses of guns to 
be somewhere between 1.5 million and 3.1 mil­
lion a year.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court declared 
that the 30-year-old law banning handguns 
in Washington, D.C., violated the Second 
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Proponents 
of gun rights point to the fact that while hand­
guns were banned in Washington, D.C., its 
murder rate actually rose at the same time that 
the murder rate in the rest of the United States 
dropped. Strongly believing that gun possession 
deters crime, the town of Kennesaw, Georgia, 
went so far as to pass a city law requiring every 
household to own a firearm.

Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
Studying the Impact of Atmospheric 
Changes
If “the moon is in the seventh house and Jupiter is aligned with Mars,” are 
you more likely to rob a bank? Although the alignment of the stars may be of 
questionable value in studying crime patterns, it’s clear that the date, time, 
and even weather play important roles.
Crime stats show that more crime occurs during the summer than in other 
times of the year. Here are some reasons why:
 
✓ Kids are out of school and have more free time. And you know what they 
say about idle hands — the whole devil’s workshop thing.
 
✓ More people are outside interacting with each other (rather than sitting 
on their couches watching TV), which produces greater opportunities 
for conflict.
 
✓ People generally take vacations in the summer, leaving their homes for 
a week or two — and leaving them vulnerable to burglary. (If you were 
a burglar, would you rather be out on a nice July night, prowling around 
houses looking for an easy entry, or would you prefer to be out on a 
rainy, windy, 40-degree December night when every house is likely to be 
occupied?)
 
✓ Hot weather may lead to an increase in domestic violence as tempers 
turn short.
	
	Interestingly, extremely hot weather may decrease crime somewhat. For 
example, when it’s too hot, the number of sexual offenses, such as rape, 
generally decreases.
Robberies are an exception to the summer-weather rule. More robberies 
occur in the winter, perhaps because winter offers more darkness to conceal 
criminal acts. Plus, the cold weather justifies wearing more clothes (which 
lets robbers conceal their appearances without raising suspicions).

Regarding Crime as a Rational 
Decision: Rational Choice Theory
In This Chapter
▶ Taking a look at the theory that preceded rational choice theory
▶ Weighing the risks and rewards of crime
▶ Figuring out appropriate — and effective — deterrents
▶ Poking some holes in the theory
O

ne of the core theories of criminology holds that, for the most part, 
criminals engage in a rational decision-making process when choosing 
to commit crime. This theory, called the rational choice theory, is at the heart 
of society’s primary response to crime — which is putting criminals behind 
bars. Many people believe that when you punish crime sufficiently (through 
jail or prison), a rational person will choose not to commit crime.
In this chapter, I discuss the ramifications of the rational choice theory after 
taking a brief look at its forbearer, classical theory. I finish with a discussion 
on the limits of the theory.
Taking a Quick Tour through 
Classical Theory
In the late 18th century in many European countries, criminal justice systems 
were little more than collections of arbitrary laws unknown to the populace. 
Confessions by torture were common, and you could’ve been arrested for 
doing something you didn’t even realize was a crime. Punishment was often 
arbitrary, excessive to the crime, and not based on any written law. Judges 
may even have had financial interests in the outcomes of criminal cases, 
which as you can imagine, made the punishments even more subjective.

An Italian man named Cesare Beccaria came to the rescue in 1764 when he 
published the world-changing essay known as On Crimes and Punishments. In 
this essay, Beccaria rebelled against the arbitrary nature of punishment and 
laid the foundation for the classical theory of criminology. Beccaria’s utilitarian 
philosophy (and a key element of classical theory) is summed up in the 
following excerpt:
In order for punishment not to be, in every instance, an act of violence of 
one or many against a private citizen, it must be essentially public, prompt, 
necessary, the least possible in the given circumstances, proportionate to 
the crime and dictated by the laws.
— Cesare Beccaria
Beccaria sought to bring reason to punishment. He and other like-minded 
individuals succeeded magnificently, igniting a revolution in Western law. 
That revolution included doing away with torture, writing down the criminal 
laws and making them known to the populace, and adding the Eighth 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits cruel and unusual 
punishment. In the United States, the principles that Beccaria and others 
(he can’t have all the credit) promoted were ingrained in the Bill of Rights in 
1791, just 27 years after they were first brought forward.
	
Although the call for proportionate punishment was a crucial part of classical 
theory, the theory also included another important element: the belief that 
individuals act purposefully to maximize their pleasure in life. The theory held 
that people will commit crimes unless they believe that the potential pun­
ishments outweigh the pleasures or benefits they gain from committing the 
crimes.
Calculating the Benefits and 
Drawbacks of Crime
Over time, classical theory evolved into its modern version called rational 
choice theory, which holds that criminals think about their actions, weighing 
the pros and cons (including the risks of punishment) and making decisions 
based on their calculations.
Analyzing risks and rewards
When you need to make an important decision like changing jobs or deciding 
where to go to college, you may sit down and write out the pros and cons on 
a piece of paper. You attempt to reason through each option to make the best 
decision. Most criminals don’t engage in this level of rational thought before 

179
 Chapter 12: Regarding Crime as a Rational Decision: Rational Choice Theory
committing crime, but rational choice theorists contend that even though a 
criminal may not write out the pros and cons of a decision to commit a crime, 
he does go through a rational decision-making process. That is, he engages in 
a risk/reward or cost/benefit analysis by asking himself, “What are the risks 
and rewards of my actions?”
	
By saying that a decision to commit a crime is rational, rational choice theo­
rists are not saying the decision is smart. In reality, rational decisions to 
commit crimes are likely based on faulty values and bad judgments, but they 
are, nonetheless, decisions made after weighing risks and rewards. For exam­
ple, a person who steals an iPod clearly undervalues the property rights of 
others, but his decision may still be rational because he believes committing 
the crime will end not in punishment but in iPod possession.
What are some of the benefits that a person may get from committing a 
crime? Of course, the answer depends on the type of crime, but here are a 
few possibilities:
 
✓ Money or property
 
✓ Thrills and excitement
 
✓ Status among peers
 
✓ Revenge
 
✓ Dominance over others
 
✓ A bond with other criminals
Think about a teenage dropout who sees a super smart kid he knew in geom­
etry class before he dropped out. The dropout decides to beat up the smart 
kid. At first glance, this choice seems irrational. What good can come from 
this action? Indeed, the dropout probably isn’t consciously following a logi­
cal progression in his decision making; rather, his decision is partly subcon­
scious. But when you break it down, here’s what the dropout may be thinking 
right before he beats up the smart kid:
 
✓ I never liked that kid.
 
✓ He thought he was so smart.
 
✓ I felt dumb around him.
 
✓ I’m bigger and tougher than him.
 
✓ Now that we’re out of the classroom, I want him to know what I felt like.
 
✓ I’m going to kick his butt.
The reward for committing this crime of assault is primarily a feeling of 
superiority and dominance over the smart kid. Of course, in making a ratio­
nal decision, the dropout must also consider the costs or risks involved. For 
instance, if he’s caught, he may be arrested for assault.

180
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
But what if there were no costs? Imagine a society without criminal laws. 
Everyone would have to fend for himself, and the only law would be survival 
of the fittest. The dropout’s only fear would be that the smart kid may use his 
geometry prowess to get even.
In modern society, however, the existence of criminal laws provides the most 
likely risk or cost to the dropout. So before he decides to beat up the smart 
kid, he probably looks around for a teacher or other adult who could turn 
him in. Seeing no one, he assesses the risk as minimal and proceeds with the 
beating. He may also know that because he’s under 18, the justice system 
can’t treat him as an adult, so not much can happen to him even if he is 
caught. In essence, the dropout gets to feel dominant over the smart kid 
without much risk of negative consequences — at least in the short run.
Although the dropout’s rational thought process is partly subconscious, 
rational choice theorists believe that a lot of crime involves the actual 
conscious weighing of risks and rewards.
Choosing the type and place of crime
Part of choosing to engage in crime is rationally choosing the type of crime 
to commit. For example, wanting to assert dominance over the smart kid, the 
dropout from the previous example doesn’t just randomly start committing 
crime against anyone. He doesn’t choose to burglarize the smart kid’s house 
or steal his skateboard. Instead, he consciously chooses to commit assault.
Deciding where and when to commit a crime requires a lot of thought, too — 
perhaps more thought than deciding whether to commit the crime in the first 
place. After all, if you’re going to commit a crime, you want to be successful. 
So burglars choose vulnerable homes or stores. Street-level drug dealers pick 
locations where customers are readily available and police are visible from 
a distance (so they can run before the cops get to them). Car thieves choose 
cars that are easy to take and can be sold (either whole or in parts) for the 
highest profit.
Choosing the time and place of a crime may be based on improving the 
reward of the crime or reducing the risk of being caught. For example, a 
robber usually chooses a location near his own home because he knows 
all the escape routes and, therefore, can reduce his risk of being caught. At 
the same time, however, the robber also wants the crime to be fairly easy to 
commit. It’s a well-known secret that most criminals are extremely lazy and 
unwilling to make extra efforts, even when those efforts may mean increased 
rewards.

181
 Chapter 12: Regarding Crime as a Rational Decision: Rational Choice Theory
Factoring in personality and skills
Obviously, the personal characteristics of a criminal are tremendously 
important in influencing the decision to commit crime. For example, the 
ability to delay gratification often divides criminals from law-abiding citizens. 
Two people may equally desire an LCD television. One may choose to work 
for six months and save money to buy the TV. The other person, who can’t 
stand to delay gratification so long, may decide to run the risk of being 
caught and steal the TV now.
	
Some people not only have personality traits that influence their criminal 
decisions but also develop skills that make criminal choices easier. For 
example, a significant problem with putting a bunch of criminals in prison is 
that they learn new criminal skills from each other, which they can use when 
they’re released. A serial car thief may spend two years in prison, sharing a 
cell with a drug trafficker. During those two years, the car thief may learn how 
to conceal drugs in vehicles. When he’s released, the car thief may decide to 
start trafficking heroin and cocaine.
Meeting the offender’s needs
Basically, the benefit the criminal hopes to receive from a particular crime 
determines which type of crime he chooses to commit and how he decides 
to commit it. People who want goods or money generally commit property 
crime. For instance, if I simply want an iPod, I can steal it from my friend’s 
backpack. But if I want an iPod and I want to show my friends that I’m fearless, 
I may go into an electronics store, grab one, and run out. In contrast, people 
who want to feel dominance over others are more likely to commit violent 
crimes. Someone who wants status in a street gang may look for an opportunity 
to use his gun against a rival gang, for example.
	
Generally, people who commit property crime don’t cross over and commit 
violent crime because the punishment for violent crime is usually much 
higher. So property criminals, making rational calculations, choose to commit 
offenses that are less likely to cost them significant prison sentences. For 
example, a property criminal can choose to commit armed robbery (theft 
by force) of a jewelry store, or he can choose to break into the store at night 
and commit burglary. Because robbery is considered a violent crime with a 
much greater punishment, the property offender is likely to opt for burglary. 
Robbers, on the other hand, often want more than just property — they want 
the thrill, excitement, and danger of sticking a gun in someone’s face.

182
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
Creating Rational Deterrents to Crime
Supporters of rational choice theory believe that if the risk of being caught is 
high enough — and the punishment is severe enough — most crime will be 
deterred. Before I jump into that discussion, however, I need to point out a 
few other deterrents to crime, including
 
✓ The disapproval of family and peers
 
✓ Moral or religious objections
 
✓ Recognition that, in the long run, the criminal life isn’t rewarding
Society can benefit greatly from encouraging these deterrents; I discuss the 
impact of family and society in discouraging crime in Chapter 13. But the 
reality today is that society spends most of its resources for deterring crime 
on the threat of arrest and punishment in the justice system.
In this section, I take a look at the different ways society tries to deter people 
from committing crime through punishment.
Running the risk of being 
caught (and punished)
For the threat of arrest and punishment to be an effective deterrent to crime, 
potential criminals have to believe their chances of being caught and punished 
are high. So, how high is the risk of being arrested for a crime? Not very. As I 
discuss in Chapter 3, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) keeps statistics on 
the number of arrests for certain serious crimes and calculates the national 
rate — called the clearance rate — at which reported crimes are cleared by 
arrests of suspects. Unfortunately, most serious crime doesn’t end in arrest. 
Figure 12-1 shows the 2007 U.S. clearance rates for a variety of offenses.
Note: These statistics don’t include minor crimes, such as shoplifting, which 
aren’t even reported to the police unless the suspects are caught. So the total 
clearance rate for all crime is actually much lower than it appears to be in 
Figure 12-1.
As you can see, serious violent crimes are solved at a much higher rate than 
serious property crimes, which means violent criminals face a greater risk than 
property criminals. Why the difference? For one, law enforcement agencies put 
a higher priority on solving violent crime, devoting significantly more resources 
to investigating rapes and murders than thefts and burglaries. In fact, in many 
communities, a police officer doesn’t even visit your home to take a report when 
your home is burglarized. In addition, violent crimes, such as rape, assault, and 
robbery, often involve victims who are eyewitnesses (which means they can 

183
 Chapter 12: Regarding Crime as a Rational Decision: Rational Choice Theory
often describe or identify the criminal), while property crimes usually don’t 
involve eyewitnesses.

Based on the risk component of the rational choice theory, if state governments 
(and federal agencies) hired enough police officers (and other law enforcing 
agents), they’d be able to significantly increase the risk of being caught and, 
thereby, deter much more crime. So why doesn’t the government do so?
	
The truth is, it has. Between 1992 and 2004, the total number of state and local 
police agency employees in the United States grew from about 841,000 to 1.1 
million — an increase of 23 percent. During that time period, the national crime 
rate decreased significantly. For example, the violent crime rate dropped by 
more than half between 1992 and 2004. Of course, criminologists debate about 
the actual cause of this dramatic decrease in crime, and deterrence from greater 
police presence is just one of many theories. (See the next section for another 
potential reason: an increase in the length of prison sentences.)
Adding even more law enforcement personnel would cost U.S. taxpayers a 
lot of money, and society currently has many other ills calling for tax dollars. 
In addition, U.S. citizens highly value individual freedom and tend to distrust 
any government presence that’s too dominant — the kind that would result 
from having a police officer on every street corner.

Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
Increasing the severity of punishment
The fear of being embarrassed by an arrest is enough to deter many people 
from committing crime. (Just think of the mug shots that show up on TV 
when the latest celebrity is arrested and booked. Imagine having your friends 
and co-workers see you like that.) But in addition to embarrassment, the 
type and amount of punishment for a particular crime is very important in a 
criminal’s risk/reward calculations.
	
Beginning in the mid-1990s, a movement spread across the United States to 
significantly increase the punishment for serious violent offenders. Prior to 
this movement, murderers were commonly released from prison after ten 
years — sometimes even less. As a result of this movement, a typical sentence 
for a murderer today is life in prison. I discuss incarceration theories in detail 
in Chapter 21, but for now here’s what you need to know: One major goal of 
the movement toward more severe sentencing was to deter violent crime. And 
some criminologists cite increased punishment as a reason for the dramatic 
decrease in violent crime since the 1990s.
An unintended result of this movement toward increased punishment has 
been the filling up of jails and prisons, which results in a lack of space for 
low-level offenders. Thus, serious offenders get longer sentences, but 
shoplifters, drunk drivers, or even wife beaters may not get any jail time at 
all. Judges try imposing other creative punishments, such as community 
service or fines, on low-level offenders, but if a criminal isn’t deterred by the 
fear of arrest, this minimal punishment isn’t likely to have much of an effect, 
either.
What about the ultimate punishment — death? I discuss this topic in detail in 
Chapter 21, but suffice it to say, criminologists, politicians, and citizens alike 
engage in a vigorous debate about whether the death penalty deters crime.
Aiming for speedy punishment
Some people believe that a long delay between the arrest and the imposition 
of a sentence negates the deterrent effect of punishment. Most defendants, 
for instance, aren’t held in jail while they wait for their trials (or while they 
wait to plea bargain), so they’re free to commit additional crimes before they 
experience any punishment. Criminals can rack up quite a few crimes before 
they ever see the inside of a jail cell.
In addition, most people — including criminals — rationalize their miscon­
duct, and as more time passes after their arrest, they can persuade them­
selves that they weren’t all that responsible for their crime. By the time 

185
 Chapter 12: Regarding Crime as a Rational Decision: Rational Choice Theory
sentencing rolls around a year later, many criminals have completely disasso­
ciated the punishment from their criminal conduct. Therefore, they feel that 
the punishment is unwarranted and, thus, resent their treatment.
	
Deterrence requires people to associate punishment with the crimes they 
commit. If criminals don’t make that association, they’re more likely to commit 
more crime in the future.
One of the criticisms of the death penalty is that long delays of 10 to 20 years 
from sentencing to execution mean that people don’t fear being executed if 
they commit murder. (In Chapter 21, I discuss the death penalty in detail.)
Punishments throughout U.S. history
Today the primary means of criminal punishment 
is jail or prison. U.S. courts require certain 
minimum standards for inmates, including 
access to daylight and fresh air, exercise, 
protection from the elements, and quality meals. 
In the past, however, particularly before the 
passage of the Bill of Rights, society imposed 
some very different forms of punishment. Here 
are just a few that used to be popular:
 ✓ Stocks and pillories: Punishments involving 
stocks and pillories were slightly different 
from one another, but generally, stocks and 
pillories were wooden frames that held 
criminals in place so that other citizens 
could insult them and throw rotten food at 
them.
 ✓ Public humiliation: When criminals 
received this punishment, they had to wear 
clothes with big letters sewn on them, 
representing the crimes they’d committed. 
For example, a T stood for theft.
 ✓ Whipping: This punishment involved lashing 
someone on the back with a whip. The number 
of lashes depended on the seriousness 
of the crime.
 ✓ Tarring and feathering: This punishment 
involved hot tar being applied to the 
criminal’s skin and then feathers being 
stuck on top of it. Criminals who received 
this punishment were then paraded 
around town. Tarring and feathering was 
more often a vigilante punishment than 
something imposed by a judge.
 ✓ Burning at the stake: A common punishment 
throughout history, burning at the stake was 
outlawed in England in 1790. (Contrary to 
popular myth, the Salem witch trials of the 
1690s didn’t end in the burning of witches, 
but rather in hangings — except one poor 
soul who was executed by having a pile of 
stones placed on top of him.)
 ✓ Hanging, drawing, and quartering: This 
punishment was used primarily in England 
for men who committed treason, but it was 
also used in Canada and may have once 
been used in New York (before the United 
States became a nation). The criminals 
were dragged to a location where they 
were hanged for a short period of time. 
They were then disemboweled and made 
to watch while their innards were burned. 
The criminals were then cut into four parts 
and beheaded. The body parts were placed 
around the country as a deterrent to other 
criminals.

186
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
Preventing the rewards
According to the rational choice theory, when you reduce the rewards for 
crime, or make the commission of the crime more difficult, reasonable adults 
are less likely to commit crime.
Society can employ many strategies to reduce the benefit of crime to criminals, 
particularly for property crime. Among private corporations, these strategies 
are known collectively as crime prevention or loss prevention. For example:
 
✓ Many retailers lock up items that thieves highly value, such as electronics 
and even baby formula. In addition, most retailers also have theft-
prevention devices — which they attach to high-priced items — that set 
off an alarm when someone leaves the store without paying for an item.
 
✓ Most banks place a pack of dye next to their tellers, who put the pack in 
the middle of some cash when they’re being robbed. The dye explodes 
some time later, turning the cash (and perhaps the robber) red.
 
✓ And, of course, the security industry makes billions each year by 
hardening targets: making buildings and businesses less vulnerable to 
crime through alarm and camera systems.
Examining the Limits of 
Rational Choice Theory
Understanding rational choice theory is tremendously important to 
understanding why someone may commit crime. But it fails to account for a 
number of circumstances that, as a budding criminologist, you simply can’t 
ignore. I cover some of those circumstances in the following sections.
Considering humans who 
behave irrationally
When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned 
like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.
— 1 Corinthians 13:11
This famous biblical saying is meant to inspire people to act wisely, but the 
truth is, adults often act unwisely, like children — or worse.

187
 Chapter 12: Regarding Crime as a Rational Decision: Rational Choice Theory
Sometimes people look at situations and say to themselves, “Screw it,” and 
then dive right into criminal conduct. Humans often throw reason out the 
window. Imagine a cop responding to a 9-1-1 call of a man threatening his 
family with a knife. (Disturbingly, such conduct is common.) Trying to change 
the man’s cost/benefit analysis by telling him he’s going to prison probably 
isn’t a good strategy. The man is acting irrationally, and the reason behind his 
conduct is likely one of the following:
 
✓ Drugs
 
✓ Alcohol
 
✓ Mental illness
 
✓ Extreme emotional distress
As I discuss in Chapter 5, some drugs, such as methamphetamine, can cause 
a psychosis in which a person acts completely irrationally and violently. 
Aside from such a physical reaction to drugs, addiction itself often drives 
people to commit completely irrational acts, such as running great risks for 
another quick fix.
Similarly, a person who’s drunk usually exercises very poor judgment (you’ve 
probably seen this at some point). In 2007, 12,998 intoxicated drivers crashed 
their cars and killed someone. I bet that if asked today, every one of those 
drivers would say that their decision to drive drunk was dumb. By far, alcohol 
and drugs are responsible for more crime than any other factor, in large part, 
because drugs and alcohol cause people to act irrationally.
Mental illness also poses a significant challenge for cops on the street — 
and for policymakers, in general. It seems like society has more mentally 
ill people than ever before. Mental health facilities are overflowing, forcing 
many people with mental illnesses out on the street, where their irrational 
conduct can often lead to crime.
In 2005, for instance, more than 24 million adults (11 percent of the U.S. 
population) suffered from serious psychological distress, according to the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. One reason for 
this high percentage may be the dramatic increase in drug use in the last 40 
years. More and more medical evidence shows that mothers who use drugs 
or alcohol are more likely to have mentally handicapped children. And the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse reported in 2007 that six out of ten drug 
abusers also suffer from a mental illness. (In some cases, the drug abuse 
causes the mental illness.)
Of course, numerous other factors contribute to the development of mental 
illnesses. I discuss mental illness in more detail in Chapter 14, but suffice it to 
say that the mentally ill often act irrationally when they commit crime.

188
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
Seeing how crime often pays
Folks in law enforcement often joke about how they could make a financial 
killing by becoming criminals. If crime really does pay, a rational (if immoral) 
person may very well choose a life of crime.
As I discuss in Chapter 8, a lot of people make a lot of money committing 
crime (namely, in organized crime organizations). Every day, drug traffickers in 
the United States send millions of illegally earned dollars south of the border.
Society can try to affect a criminal’s risk/reward analysis by decreasing the 
profits of crime or by increasing penalties. It can also try to address the 
moral shortcomings of its citizens who believe selling drugs is okay if they 
can get away with it. But as long as crime pays, even for just a handful of 
criminals, some people are going to choose to take the risk.
Dealing with the values gap
I know of a young man who wants to go to prison so he can move up in the 
hierarchy of his street gang. According to the rational choice theory, his 
conduct is perfectly explainable because he has something that he deems 
important to gain from committing crime. However, that rational explanation 
doesn’t do society much good.
How did this young man come to place such a high value on his street gang 
status that he would be willing to give up several years of his life and go to 
prison for it? If society can begin to understand how a man comes to develop 
such values, perhaps it can prevent others from going down the same path. 
But that’s an awfully big if.
	
Besides rational choice theory, criminologists have developed numerous 
other theories to try to explain why people engage in crime. I discuss these 
theories in the next three chapters.

Chapter 13
Looking at Society’s Role in Crime
In This Chapter
▶ Connecting crime to decaying neighborhood structures
▶ Feeling the strain of not fulfilling society’s expectations
▶ Observing how to become a criminal
▶ Keeping criminal impulses in check
A

s I explain in Chapter 12, rational choice theory is a prominent theory 
in the study of causes of crime. However, this theory fails to account 
for people’s irrational decisions, and it doesn’t explain how people develop 
values that lead them to make rational choices to commit crime.
In this chapter, I look at some prominent theories that focus more on society’s 
role — and less on individual choice — in explaining why people commit 
crime. Keep in mind that most crime is committed by young people. The 
theories I discuss in this chapter attempt to explain how someone gets into 
crime in the first place, which almost invariably happens during the teen 
years.
Alone, none of these theories adequately explains why one person becomes 
a criminal and another doesn’t. But, by understanding each theory, you can 
gain some great insight into what motivates human conduct. Perhaps you’ll 
also develop an appreciation for just how difficult dealing with crime really is.
Introducing Social Disorganization 
Theory
The Chicago School, a school of criminological thought that developed in the 
1920s, argues that a person’s physical and social environments are primarily 
responsible for the behavioral choices that person makes.

190
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
	
A significant component of the Chicago School is social disorganization theory, 
a theory that sociologists Clifford Shaw and Henry McKay developed after 
tracking crime within different neighborhoods in Chicago in the 1920s and 
1930s. Social disorganization theory emphasizes the connection between 
crime and the neighborhood structure. The theory argues that more crime 
occurs in neighborhoods that have fraying social structures, such as
 
✓ Poor schools
 
✓ Vacant and vandalized buildings
 
✓ A mix of commercial and residential property
 
✓ Changing ethnicity
 
✓ High unemployment
As social structures decay, families that can move out of the neighborhood 
do so, which further destroys the social ties that can help reduce crime. 
Conversely, in neighborhoods with good schools, little vandalism, low 
vacancy rates, and a stable population, social bonds are stronger and, as a 
result, crime rates are lower.
Shaw and McKay found that the areas of Chicago with the most crime were 
inner-city zones with large populations of new immigrants. During Shaw and 
McKay’s studies, the immigrant populations of crime-ridden neighborhoods 
changed from mostly German and Irish immigrants to Italian immigrants.
Their social disorganization theory continues to play a significant role in 
U.S. social policy today as governments grapple with the same dynamics 
of inner-city crime and new immigrant populations. For example, efforts to 
encourage businesses to establish operations in poor neighborhoods and 
tax breaks for people who buy older, broken-down homes are attempts to 
revitalize neighborhoods and help them improve social bonds and community 
strength.
Studying Strain Theory
In general, a group of theories, called strain theory, contends that most 
people in society share the same goals of achieving wealth and success. But 
some people in lower classes don’t have the same opportunities that their 
wealthier counterparts do, and, as a result, they get angry when they can’t 
achieve their goals. This frustration, or strain, leads to crime. I take a look at 
the different variations of strain theory in the following sections.

191
 Chapter 13: Looking at Society’s Role in Crime
Anomie theory
Anomie is another word for strain — it refers to the difference between 
what a person aspires to do and what he can actually achieve. When Robert 
Merton developed the anomie theory in 1938, he focused on the interplay 
between the following two concepts:
 
✓ Society imposes expectations or goals on its people — to make money 
and to be successful.
 
✓ Society approves only of certain ways to achieve these goals — go to 
school, work hard, and delay gratification, for example.
	
Merton contended that poorer classes lack real opportunities for making 
money and being successful according to society’s standards, which leads 
to anomie, or strain, or frustration (take your pick). People who live in poor 
neighborhoods with bad schools and few positive role models are significantly 
disadvantaged compared to folks who live in better neighborhoods. At some 
point, people who are disadvantaged recognize that they can’t achieve society’s 
goals in the approved way, so they resort to crime to achieve success.
In modern times, Merton may argue that bling — in other words, the gaudy 
jewelry that people who are perceived to be wealthy in inner-city neighborhoods 
display and the Mercedes and BMWs that wealthy people from richer 
neighborhoods drive — demonstrates how strong and influential the social 
forces are that drive people to seek material success. The fact that drug 
dealers like to wear bling and drive nice cars shows that their concept of 
success is a significant motivator for their criminality.
Merton’s theory has been very influential in criminological circles. But one 
criticism of the anomie theory and other similar theories is that most people 
raised in lower-class neighborhoods don’t commit crime, and some people 
in higher classes do commit crime. So, lower-class frustration in failing to 
achieve goals may be an explanation for some crimes, but it certainly doesn’t 
explain them all.
General strain theory
In 1992, Robert Agnew developed a variation of anomie theory, known as 
general strain theory (GST). GST focuses on the strain (or anomie) that people 
in all classes can feel — not just the lower classes. He contended that strain 
isn’t just frustration over failing to achieve the goals that society imposes, 
but that strain includes many other issues, as well. For example, all classes 
(rich or poor) feel some of the following strains:

192
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
 
✓ The failure to keep up with the Joneses — to achieve what your 
neighbor has achieved
 
✓ The failure to live up to your own expectations
 
✓ The loss of positive influences, such as separating from your parents or 
moving to a new community where you have no friends
 
✓ The introduction of negative influences, such as delinquent friends, 
alcoholic parents, and child or spousal abuse
Because people who live in good and bad neighborhoods may experience 
each of these types of strain singly or in combination, GST seems to be an 
improvement on Merton’s theory of anomie, which attributed strain mostly 
to the lower classes. However, GST still isn’t an all-encompassing theory of 
criminality because it doesn’t fully explain why many people who feel 
significant strain don’t commit crime.
Institutional anomie theory
Institutional anomie theory contends that certain institutions play an important 
role in keeping people from fixating on material success, and, as a result, 
these institutions help reduce strain. Families and churches, for example, 
temper the desire for material wealth. They emphasize nonmaterial success, 
such as a good home life, close friends, and spiritual strength. These institutions 
also help people find ways to deal with strain without resorting to crime.
Unfortunately, fewer people are attending church these days, and families are 
much more fractured, thanks to high divorce rates and the increasing number 
of births out of wedlock. According to the institutional anomie theory, the 
lessening impact of these institutions is leading people to place more 
emphasis on material success. It also reduces their ability to deal with strain. 
As a result, more people turn to crime.
	
As positive institutions weaken, negative institutions may grow. For example, 
street gangs and drug-trafficking organizations may flourish. As these criminal 
groups become institutions in some neighborhoods, they pass on negative — 
not positive — values from generation to generation.
Subculture theories
A number of similar theories generally contend that subcultures that 
encourage values different from mainstream society frequently develop in 
lower-class neighborhoods ( I discuss a few of these theories in this section). 

193
 Chapter 13: Looking at Society’s Role in Crime
Although hard work, education, and delayed gratification are society’s 
preferred means for achieving success, failure to achieve middle-class 
success leads to strain in poorer areas. The subcultures that develop in 
these poorer neighborhoods promote different values, such as
 
✓ Instant gratification
 
✓ Violence
 
✓ Excitement
 
✓ Toughness
 
✓ Risk taking
Lower-class reaction theory
In 1955, Albert Cohen developed a subculture theory called lower-class 
reaction theory, which holds that as kids in lower classes fail to live up to 
society’s expectations, they reject middle-class values and develop their own 
value systems. Doing so allows them to maintain their self-esteem.
For example, poor kids who develop status frustration because they don’t 
do well in school may try to obtain status elsewhere, most likely among their 
delinquent, lower-class peers by drinking alcohol and using drugs, joining 
gangs, committing theft, or engaging in violence.
The lower-class reaction theory includes a strong dose of anomie because 
Cohen believed that the lower classes are frustrated at not being able to meet 
society’s expectations.
Differential opportunity theory
In 1960, Richard Cloward and Lloyd Ohlin developed another subculture 
theory called differential opportunity theory. This theory is similar to Cohen’s 
lower-class reaction theory because it, too, argues that lower-class juveniles 
who fail to live up to societal expectations often rebel and seek to participate 
in subcultures with distinct values.
However, Cloward and Ohlin also included a dose of social disorganization 
theory. They contended that kids in stable lower-class neighborhoods are more 
likely to find criminal role models who help them achieve some level of criminal 
success by apprenticing the kids into a variety of criminal enterprises.
But, in socially disorganized neighborhoods, where the population is constantly 
moving in and out and little stability exists, even role models for criminals 
are hard to come by. As a result, not even criminal organizations thrive, and 
kids fail to find any “successful” criminal group to join. Such kids may then 
turn to groups of thugs who primarily fight with other groups.

194
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
	
According to differential opportunity theory, delinquents in stable, lower-class 
neighborhoods develop values according to their possibility of achieving 
criminal success. In contrast, delinquents in disorganized neighborhoods 
develop values and maintain their self-images not through criminal business 
but by winning conflict battles with others.
Considering Social Learning Theories
Some criminologists contend that who you are and what you do is a 
product of your social interactions and that, essentially, you learn how 
to be a criminal — which is where social learning theories come in.
Differential association theory
In 1934, Edwin Sutherland developed differential association theory, one of 
criminology’s most influential theories. He contended that crime isn’t just 
a function of lower classes and that both the rich and the poor can become 
criminals, depending on whom they hang out with and what values and 
beliefs they learn. Sutherland believed that your families and close friends 
have the greatest impact on your behavior and that you’re likely to learn 
your values from them. For example, if your dad grows marijuana in his 
basement and your mom sells the dope out the back door, you’ll likely grow 
up to view selling drugs as an acceptable behavior.
The differential association theory contends that you not only learn the 
basics of committing crime but also all the rationalizations, excuses, and 
motivations that explain and validate crime. For example, a child raised in a 
family that grows marijuana may learn how to fertilize crops and harvest the 
highest-quality buds, but that child may also come to believe that
 
✓ Marijuana has medicinal properties that help people.
 
✓ Marijuana isn’t a dangerous drug because it just helps people relax and 
have fun.
 
✓ Selling marijuana is one way to fulfill the American capitalist dream.
 
✓ Police and government officials are authoritarian jerks who strip people 
of their freedoms.
 
✓ You don’t have to pay taxes for selling drugs because those taxes just go 
to the government to take away your liberty.

195
 Chapter 13: Looking at Society’s Role in Crime
How close your association with criminals is makes a big difference, too. For 
example, a juvenile who spends a little time with some casual drug-using 
friends may experiment with drugs herself. But, because other friends and 
her family frown on drug use, she’ll probably reject drug use at some point. 
On the other hand, if her mom and sister are prostitutes who also use and 
deal drugs, she’s more likely to engage in enduring criminal behaviors.
Differential association theory isn’t based on class difference. Thus, it helps 
explain crime committed by middle- and upper-class people, not just the 
poor. After all, many poor people adopt society’s positive values — including 
hard work, thrift, and delayed gratification — and have happy, successful 
lives. In the same way, many wealthy people lie, cheat, and abuse drugs and 
alcohol — all behaviors that negatively impact their peers and family members.
In a nutshell, this theory contends that people become criminals if, from 
association with their family and peers, they learn behaviors that violate the 
law. The duration, frequency, and intensity of that contact influences just how 
much they learn.
Techniques of neutralization theory
Developed in 1957 by David Matza and Gresham Sykes, neutralization theory 
points out that people who commit crime actually fluctuate back and forth 
between criminal conduct and law-abiding conduct. They may buy groceries, 
pay for their gas, go to school, and otherwise engage in behavior that is 
acceptable in society. In fact, many criminals view themselves as normal 
members of society by rationalizing their criminal conduct. In other words, 
criminals neutralize society’s anticrime values with their own excuses.
Matza and Sykes contended that a person may employ the following five 
basic techniques of neutralization after committing a crime:
 
✓ Denying responsibility: For example, a person who just abused 
someone may say, “It was an accident” or “It’s not really my fault — 
my dad abused me my whole life.”
 
✓ Denying harm: For example, a person who just bought or stole drugs 
may say, “Buying drugs doesn’t harm anyone” or “I was just borrowing 
them — I planned to return them.”
 
✓ Denying a victim: For example, a person who just stole someone else’s 
car may say, “He had it coming” or “She can afford it.”
 
✓ Condemning people in authority: For example, criminals often call 
authority figures hypocrites or corrupt jerks.

196
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
 
✓ Appealing to a higher authority: For example, a gang member may 
justify a gang shooting by saying that it was the only way to defend his 
fellow gang brothers.
According to neutralization theory, criminals may follow society’s rules most 
of the time, but when they occasionally violate society’s rules, they know 
how to justify their conduct (at least in their own minds).
Delving into Social Control Theories
Why doesn’t everyone commit crime? It can be exciting because it often 
provides thrills and immediate gratification. Social control theorists believe 
that most people would commit crime if society didn’t impose certain controls 
that keep them in line. These controls can be either internal (the ones you 
impose on yourself) or external (the ones that come from families and 
school, for example).
Containment theory
First proposed by Walter Reckless (what a great name for a criminologist!) 
and achieving prominence in the 1950s and 1960s, containment theory 
contends that social pressures and individual characteristics work positively 
and negatively to affect a person’s behavior. Some pressures make a person 
want to commit a crime, while other pressures, called containments, make 
him want to obey the law. The following examples show you some external 
and internal pressures that often lead to crime and some containments that 
encourage law-abiding behaviors:
 
✓ External pressures toward crime:
 
• Bad neighborhood
 
• Little opportunity for education, employment, or success
 
• Delinquent friends
 
• Negative subculture, such as gangs
 
• Negative media influences
 
✓ Internal pressures toward crime:
 
• Lack of self-esteem
 
• Personality traits such as being easily angered or predisposed to 
addiction

197
 Chapter 13: Looking at Society’s Role in Crime
 
✓ External containments:
 
• Strong family support
 
• Church involvement
 
• Positive role models
 
• Nondelinquent friends
 
✓ Internal containments:
 
• Strong self-esteem
 
• Ability to resist temptation and show self-control
Because these forces are constantly at work on all people (rich or poor), this 
theory can help explain why some kids in bad neighborhoods turn out as 
law-abiding citizens and why some kids in good neighborhoods turn out as 
criminals.
Social bond theory
Proposed by Travis Hirschi in 1969, social bond theory contends that social 
bonds — bonds to family, friends, and others — are what keep people 
from breaking the law. For example, my friends may reject me if I act on my 
impulses and steal a few cans of soda from the convenience store. If I didn’t 
have any close friends, I may feel freer to steal the drinks.
As part of his social bond theory, Hirschi broke down these social bonds into 
four parts:
 
✓ Attachment: This refers to the bonds you have with other people 
(friends and parents, for example) and institutions (schools and 
churches). Someone with strong attachment to positive role models and 
institutions is less likely to engage in crime than someone who lacks 
such strong bonds.
 
✓ Commitment: This refers to the investment you have in mainstream 
society. For example, a person with a college degree has a greater 
commitment to society and more to lose by becoming a criminal than a 
high school dropout does.
 
✓ Involvement: This refers to the amount of time you spend on community 
activities, such as sports, drama, or volunteer work. Significant 
participation in societal activities helps build bonds with others and 
leaves less time for criminality.

198
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
 
✓ Belief: As its name implies, this refers to the extent to which you believe 
in the values society offers. Believing in the positive values of main­
stream society reduces your likelihood to commit crime.
A person who strongly holds each of these four components is unlikely to 
engage in crime because they’re much more likely to have strong social 
bonds. But, as each of these elements weakens, a person’s social bonds 
weaken, too, and it becomes easier to engage in criminal acts.

Chapter 14
Can Your Mind or Body Make 
You a Criminal?
In This Chapter
▶ Trying to define a criminal appearance
▶ Considering the genetic link to crime
▶ Connecting the brain to criminal behavior
▶ Touching on mental illness and personality disorders
G

enetics, early development, neighborhood quality, socialization, diet, 
brain chemistry, education, income, intelligence, social institutions, 
good and bad friends, and free will — in other words, societal and biological 
factors — all work together to make you a law-abiding or law-breaking citizen. 
In this chapter, I explore how criminologists have attempted to use biology, in 
combination with societal factors, to explain criminal behavior.
	
When you look through this chapter, keep in mind that the one clear thing 
about criminological theories is that nothing is clear. Crime has a myriad of 
potential causes that all work in conjunction with one another in varying ways 
and to varying degrees.
Biological Positivism: Trying to 
Link Appearance to Crime
An important approach to criminological theory involves the use of positivism, 
which is a fancy word that simply refers to the attempt to bring the scientific 
method to criminology. Positivists believe in objectively measuring cause and 
effect. Here I focus on biological positivism, which concentrates on the physical 
characteristics that may influence a person to commit crime.

200
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
The search for biological traits associated with criminality may have begun 
in the late 1880s with an Italian prison doctor named Cesare Lombroso. 
Lombroso developed a theory based on his own research that certain 
physical characteristics were associated with being a criminal. In other 
words, criminals often had a similar look. Lombroso’s research was an early 
form of profiling, which in its modern form is a technique that police sometimes 
use to identify people more likely to commit crimes. I discuss modern 
profiling in greater detail in Chapter 11.
According to Lombroso, some signs of criminality included
 
✓ Big jaw and cheekbones
 
✓ Strangely shaped nose and ears
 
✓ Big lips
 
✓ Sloped forehead
Basically, all you have to do is picture an ugly mug from a 1930s gangster 
movie.
	
Lombroso’s work was extremely influential during his time, but it turned out 
to be mostly wrong. Although a few people have called him the “father of 
criminology,” many modern criminologists bristle at the suggestion. In fact, 
many criminologists believe that because Lombroso’s work was so well 
received (but poorly done), he set back the field of criminology many years. 
(Because science — even social science — builds on the work of previous 
generations, I think criticism of Lombroso’s honest efforts are somewhat 
unfair.)
Wrestling with the Influence of Genetics
Is there a criminal gene that gets passed from generation to generation? As I 
explain in Chapters 11, 12, and 13, analyzing why someone commits a crime 
is incredibly complicated. So many variables come into play that isolating 
one particular cause, including genetics, is extremely difficult.
Even if genetics play a role in crime, that role clearly doesn’t involve just 
one crime gene. Rather, a person may be genetically predisposed in varying 
degrees to certain activities or emotions, such as anxiety, aggressiveness, 
or even learning impairments, all of which can play a part in a person’s 
decision to commit crime. (I discuss how poor education can indirectly lead 
to a greater likelihood of criminal behavior in Chapter 11.)
In this section, I touch on some of the work that scientists have done to try to 
determine whether genetics play a role in criminality.

201
 Chapter 14: Can Your Mind or Body Make You a Criminal?
Figuring out how parents influence 
criminal behavior
Many studies have shown that parents who are criminals are more likely to 
have children who engage in criminal conduct. However, this trend doesn’t 
necessarily mean that criminality is genetic. Criminal kids may come from 
criminal parents for a variety of reasons, including the following:
 
✓ Kids learn criminal behavior from their parents.
 
✓ Criminal parents are poor parents who don’t raise their kids well. For 
example, the parents may fail to teach appropriate ways to deal with 
anger.
 
✓ Criminal parents are less likely to emphasize the importance of 
education.
 
✓ Criminal parents may be more likely to allow kids to hang out with other 
delinquents, which reinforces criminal values.
To try to determine whether a genetic component to crime exists, criminologists 
have done a variety of studies involving adopted children. One such study by 
W. F. Gabrielli Jr., S. A. Mednick, and B. Hutchings in 1984 drew the following 
conclusions from a set of historical adoption data:
 
✓ 13.5 percent of adopted sons engage in criminal conduct when neither 
biological parents nor adoptive parents are criminals.
 
✓ 14.7 percent of adopted sons engage in crime when the adoptive parents 
are criminals but the biological parents are not.
 
✓ 20 percent of adopted sons engage in crime when the biological parents 
are criminals but the adoptive parents are not.
 
✓ 24 percent of adopted sons engage in crime when both the biological 
and adoptive parents are criminals.
	
Studies like this one seem to indicate that biological parents impact the 
criminal conduct of their children by the genes they pass down and that 
parental figures who raise children also impact criminal conduct through 
social learning and the environments they create.
Other studies have focused on the behavior of twins. Identical twins share 
the exact same genes, but fraternal twins share only half of the same genes. 
So if genetics play a role in creating criminals, you expect a greater correlation 
in criminal behavior between identical twins than between fraternal twins. 
Some studies have shown that identical twins are more likely than fraternal 
twins to share traits, such as suicidal tendencies, impulsiveness, and criminal 
antisocial behavior.

202
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
However, I must point out some valid criticisms of studies involving adopted 
children and twins. For one thing, samples are often small, which means a 
small error can have a significant impact on the results. Also, records such 
as whether a twin is truly an identical twin are often based not on blood tests 
but on less reliable assessments. Furthermore, keep in mind that twins are 
almost always raised in the same environment, so you can also explain the 
similarity in criminal behavior partly by the fact that the twins are raised by 
the same parents with the same social influences.
Nonetheless, evidence that genetics play an important part in determining 
whether a child is more likely to engage in criminal conduct seems to be 
mounting.
Creating criminals through evolution
Some people theorize that the most aggressive males in society are more 
likely to mate and, thus, to have more offspring than other males. Over time, 
through the process of evolution, the human population features more 
men with genetic predispositions to aggression — and, theoretically, 
predispositions to violent crime.
	
The scientific study of criminological evolution is very difficult. However, 
the interest in studying such theories — including the mating patterns of 
criminals, which may have long-term societal impacts — is growing. For 
instance, one argument in favor of longer prison sentences for violent criminals 
(at least among cops who deal with violent people on the street) is that a 
criminal can’t procreate in prison. Because most violent crime is committed 
between the ages of 17 and 35, the same ages as peak sexual activity, longer 
sentences may reduce the number of offspring of violent offenders (and 
increase the chances of a shy criminologist getting a date).
Blaming the Brain
Many other factors besides genetics affect your brain function. In this 
section, I briefly introduce a few of these factors that may impact criminality.
Eating a poor diet
Yes, nutrition can impact crime, albeit indirectly. Human beings need all sorts 
of nutrients, including minerals and vitamins, for optimum health. Nutritional 
deficiencies can have many negative impacts on physical well-being and 
brain functioning. For example, if you have a nutritional deficiency, you may 
experience

203
 Chapter 14: Can Your Mind or Body Make You a Criminal?
 
✓ Difficulty learning
 
✓ The onset of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD)
 
✓ Depression
As I discuss in Chapter 13, poor performance in school and impaired social 
relationships may be closely related to delinquency in youth. Similarly, AD/
HD and depression also are linked to higher incidents of antisocial and 
delinquent conduct.
Several studies of children and prison inmates have shown that using dietary 
supplements, including omega-3 fatty acids (which are found in fish oil), not 
only produces general health benefits and improved performance in school 
but also can significantly reduce violent or antisocial behavior. Other studies 
show that low blood sugar, known as hypoglycemia, leads some people to 
more violent conduct.
The myth of the Twinkie defense
In 1978, a former cop, fireman, and city supervi­
sor named Dan White murdered San Francisco 
Mayor George Mosconi and another city super­
visor, Harvey Milk. Despite confessing, White 
was convicted of only voluntary manslaughter 
after his attorneys asserted a defense of dimin­
ished capacity. Essentially, they claimed that 
White was debilitated by mental illness and 
wasn’t fully responsible for the crime. Under the 
weak sentencing laws of the 1970s, White was 
sentenced to fewer than eight years in prison 
and ended up serving only about five. (After the 
sentence was pronounced, the gay community 
of San Francisco erupted in protest because 
Harvey Milk was one of the nation’s first promi­
nent gay politicians.)
White’s lawyers asserted that he was suffer­
ing from severe depression and that his life had 
begun to unravel before he killed Mosconi and 
Milk. A very small piece of testimony focused 
on how, as part of his depression, White 
stopped eating healthily and began eating junk 
food, such as Twinkies, HoHos, and Ding Dongs. 
The defense offered this evidence to show 
that White was depressed, and a psychiatrist 
testified that what a person ingests can impact 
his actions. But the focus of the defense was on 
how White’s depression impaired his ability to 
deliberate, a requirement for a murder convic­
tion in California.
A columnist for a San Francisco newspaper 
first mentioned the “Twinkie insanity defense” 
in passing. Shortly thereafter, other media 
picked up on the phrase. Within a few months, 
there was a nationwide outcry over the fact that 
someone could get off for a murder by claiming 
he ate too many Twinkies. Politicians joined in 
the misplaced outcry (no surprise) and eventu­
ally removed the diminished capacity law from 
the books in California.
The truth is White didn’t avoid a murder con­
viction by asserting a Twinkie defense. He was 
convicted of a lesser charge because his law­
yers persuaded the jury that his depression 
meant he shouldn’t be held fully responsible 
for his crime. His eating of junk food, including 
Twinkies, was just a symptom of his depression. 
After his release from prison, Dan White com­
mitted suicide in 1985.

204
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
Grappling with the wrong brain chemistry
Obviously, the brain is an incredibly complex organ, dependent on numerous 
chemicals in the right amounts to function properly. Deficiencies in these 
chemicals can lead to all types of behavioral and emotional problems, 
including anger, aggressiveness, impulsiveness, depression, and difficulty 
dealing with stress.
Some people, whose tendency toward violence is difficult to control, may be 
prescribed certain drugs that help balance out essential brain chemicals. One 
such antipsychotic drug is haloperidol (brand name Haldol), which doctors 
also give to schizophrenics who suffer from delusions and hallucinations. 
Controlling criminal impulses in individuals with strong tendencies toward 
violence largely depends on getting them to regularly take their medications.
Having a low IQ
Early criminological theories found a link between intelligence and crime. 
However, this analysis fell out of favor until a 1977 study by Michael 
Hindelang and Travis Hirschi found that delinquents tended to have lower 
IQs than nondelinquents. This study also found that a lower IQ meant a 
person was more likely to be a recidivist (a criminal who commits another 
felony within three years of being released).
Since this 1977 study, many criminologists have argued that the link between 
IQ and criminal conduct is indirect. Lower IQ leads to poor school performance, 
which weakens ties to positive institutions and to society, which, in turn, 
leads to criminality. Kids with higher IQs are more likely to succeed in school 
and have more opportunities for jobs and income in mainstream society, 
which often leads them to commit less crime.
	
People also point out that IQ tests can be culturally biased, resulting in lower 
scores for lower classes or certain racial and ethnic groups. Such bias means 
that a person’s class or race is a part of the IQ score, thus invalidating the link 
between IQ and crime.
Struggling with Mental Illness
In some cases, mental illness is a significant cause of criminal conduct. 
A few categories of mental illness actually excuse a person from criminal 
responsibility. (See Chapter 20 for a discussion of the insanity defense.) More 
commonly, however, people suffer from other impairments that may affect 
criminality but not excuse it.

205
 Chapter 14: Can Your Mind or Body Make You a Criminal?
The American Psychiatric Association has attempted to categorize most 
types of mental illnesses in its book called the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, known as the DSM-IV (currently in its fourth 
edition). The experts who drafted the latest edition of the book break down 
mental impairments into five categories, or axes. Axis I includes the most 
serious mental illnesses that can form the basis for an insanity defense and 
excuse criminal conduct.
A serious discussion of the impact of mental illness is beyond the scope of 
this book. But the evidence is clear that people who suffer from illnesses 
such as paranoid schizophrenia or bipolar disorder can have a difficult time 
getting by in society.
Schizophrenia, for example, can be accompanied by delusions and 
hallucinations that lead people to commit crimes. If I have a hallucination 
that a TV newswoman is telling me the postman is trying to kill me, I may 
decide to kill the postman before he tries to kill me. For such a crime, the 
judge or jury would likely find me guilty but insane because I acted based 
on the hallucination. For more information about schizophrenia, check out 
Schizophrenia For Dummies by Jerome and Irene Levine (Wiley).
Dealing with a Personality Disorder
	
Psychiatrists and psychologists often distinguish serious mental illnesses 
like schizophrenia from personality disorders, which are rigid patterns of 
behavior and belief that differ markedly from society’s expectations. Having 
a personality disorder doesn’t provide a legal excuse for committing a crime. 
In other words, you can’t claim the insanity defense just because you’re 
diagnosed with a personality disorder.
A person may develop a personality disorder based on combinations of the 
factors I discuss throughout Part III of this book, including family influences, 
environment, diet, lack of attachment to institutions such as schools or 
churches, delinquent friends, brain chemistry, genetics, and drug and alcohol 
abuse.
The DSM-IV includes ten personality disorders, which are designated as 
Axis II conditions (as opposed to Axis I mental illnesses). Some personality 
disorders are associated with criminal conduct, including the following:
 
✓ Antisocial personality disorder: I discuss this disorder in detail in the 
next section.
 
✓ Narcissistic personality disorder: Obviously, this label describes a 
person who is narcissistic, but someone with this disorder may also lack 
empathy, be arrogant, and have a sense of entitlement.

206
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
 
✓ Borderline personality disorder: This disorder is characterized by 
extreme black-and-white thinking, mood swings, and difficulty functioning 
within societal norms. It’s also associated with higher suicide rates.
 
✓ Histrionic personality disorder: Excessive emotionality and attention 
seeking are characteristics of this disorder.
 
✓ Paranoid personality disorder: A person who is paranoid, distrustful of 
others, hypersensitive, and quick to react angrily may have this disorder. 
(Don’t confuse this disorder with paranoid schizophrenia, which is a 
very different condition that often involves delusions and hallucinations.)
Focusing on antisocial personality disorder
Antisocial tendencies are strongly linked to criminal behavior. However, a 
person who is diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder may never 
commit a crime, and many criminals don’t have antisocial personality disorder.
According to the DSM-IV, a person with antisocial personality disorder gener­
ally demonstrates a “pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the 
rights of others.” In the United States, approximately 3 percent of the male 
population and 1 percent of the female population suffer from this disorder.
Distinguishing psychopaths
Many people use the term psychopathy interchangeably with the diagnosis of 
antisocial personality disorder, but doing so is a mistake because most people 
with antisocial personality disorder aren’t psychopaths.
A psychopath, as defined by leading expert Dr. Robert Hare, “is a remorseless 
predator who uses charm, intimidation, and, if necessary, impulsive and cold-
blooded violence to achieve his ends.”
The distinction between psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder is 
important because psychopathy has been shown to be a strong predictor of 
recidivism (the tendency to commit serious crime after being released from 
custody). A psychopath is three or four times more likely to reoffend after 
release from prison than someone else. However, criminologists haven’t 
found any strong link between recidivism and antisocial personality disorder.
Furthermore, psychopaths are resistant to treatment regimens; in fact, they 
often become more dangerous after treatment as they learn how to manipu­
late the system. Studies have also shown that people diagnosed with antiso­
cial personality disorder may grow out of their antisocial conduct and, after 
age 35, are less likely to engage in crime. Psychopaths, however, don’t seem 
to age out of crime, at least not until their mid-40s.

207
 Chapter 14: Can Your Mind or Body Make You a Criminal?
What causes psychopathy? A 2008 study by Donald Lynam, Rolf Loeber, and 
Magda Stouthamer-Loeber followed 271 13-year-old boys from Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania, until they turned 24. The researchers found that
 
✓ Boys who scored low in psychopathy at age 13 were more likely to score 
high at age 24 if they were exposed to a lot of antisocial friends and if 
they experienced higher levels of physical punishment.
 
✓ Boys who scored high in psychopathy at age 13 remained high at the age 
of 24 regardless of the caliber of their friends and whether or not they 
were physically punished.
	
In other words, good friends and a good home life don’t seem to moderate 
psychopathy in a kid. But bad friends and a bad home life can make 
psychopathy worse.
Other studies have shown that traits consistent with adult psychopathy are 
visible in children as young as 3 years old. This finding suggests that being a 
psychopath is more dependent on early development and genetics than on 
socialization as a teenager or adult.
Defining antisocial
Because the word antisocial is so prevalent in 
criminology, understanding how psychiatrists 
define it is useful. The Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-
IV), includes the following criteria for antisocial 
personality disorder:
 ✓ Displaying a pervasive pattern of disregard­
ing and violating the rights of others since 
the age of 15
 ✓ Experiencing conduct disorder (essentially 
violating the rights of others) before the age

ritical criminology — a fairly vague categorization that applies to a 
broad array of unconventional criminological theories — developed in 
the 1960s as a challenge to conventional criminology, which encompasses 
the theories I discuss in Chapters 12 through 14. In essence, conventional 
criminological theories all accept (to some extent) the normal societal power 
structures. Critical criminology, on the other hand, challenges these generally 
accepted power structures.
Many of the writings of early critical criminologists were based on Marxist 
philosophy. Marxist criminologists argued that government creates criminal 
laws to benefit the people who own the means of economic production — 
who happen to be the same people who exercise tremendous influence over 
the government. Because conventional criminology is often dependent on 
government funding for its studies, some critical criminologists think of 
mainstream colleagues who take government money for their studies as 
sellouts to “the man.”
Today, a critical criminologist may subscribe to any of a number of different 
critical theories, but almost all of them focus on power structures and the 
conflict between the haves and the have-nots. These theories tend to argue 
that people in power use the economic and justice systems to control poor 
people, minorities, and women. In this chapter, I introduce several of the 

210
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
more prominent critical theories, including a couple that deal more with 
solving the crime problem than figuring out why it exists in the first place. 
Understanding these more radical theories is essential to having a complete 
grasp of the wide world of criminological theory.
Labeling Someone a Criminal
Labeling theory, which achieved prominence in the 1960s, essentially consists 
of the following two concepts:
 
✓ The people in power decide what conduct is deviant or criminal as a 
way to control others, including minorities, women, and the poor.
 
✓ The act of labeling someone a criminal makes that person a criminal — 
not the person’s conduct itself.
In other words, the people in power decide which acts are crimes, and then 
they label anyone who commits those acts a criminal. For example, politicians 
may make the act of accepting political contributions from lobbyists legal 
for themselves but make accepting money for favors a crime (known as 
bribery) for low-level bureaucrats. In this section, I take a closer look at 
labeling theory and its weaknesses.
Changing someone’s self-image
	
A significant component of labeling theory holds that labeling someone a 
criminal negatively affects her self-image and increases her chances of 
committing more criminal acts. In other words, how society reacts to a 
person’s committing a crime can actually cause her to commit more crimes.
Criminologist Edwin Lemert developed the following two stages of labeling:
 
✓ Primary deviance: The first crime that someone commits
 
✓ Secondary deviance: The crimes someone chooses to commit after 
(and often because) society labels that person a criminal
People who have been labeled criminals may start to reject societal values 
and look for support from others who have also been labeled criminals or 
deviants. For example, kids who have been caught up in the criminal justice 
system may begin to associate with one another, form a gang, and engage in 
joint, antisocial activities because they share the criminal label.

211
 Chapter 15: Critical Theory: Theories off the Beaten Path
Why all the fuss because of a label? Try this little experiment: Think back 
to something stupid or illegal you did in your youth that you got away with 
(underage drinking, for example, or smoking marijuana or shoplifting). What 
if you had been caught? How would your life be different today?
Because you weren’t caught, you were spared the label of being a criminal 
and, along with that label, the stigma and potential downward spiral of 
secondary deviance. Had you been caught, you may have been kicked out 
of your high school band or sports team and suspended from school. In that 
situation, instead of helping you decide on a college, your high school 
counselor may have recommended that you consider a less-skilled profession. 
(Ditch digging, anyone?) With decreased educational and professional 
opportunities, you may have been less compelled to hold tight to society’s 
values, and, as a result, your path in life may have taken a very different 
route.
	
I once worked with a deputy district attorney — an excellent and very skilled 
prosecutor — who was hired only after the elected district attorney determined 
that something he did as a teenager (breaking a storefront window) didn’t 
result in any criminal charges. Had he been labeled as a criminal in his youth, 
he may never have become a successful and effective prosecutor.
Erasing the criminal label
Clearly, attaching a stigma to someone who commits a crime is a big part of 
criminal enforcement. The act of labeling someone a criminal is one of the 
most significant punishments that society can deliver. For this reason, you 
can be sure that society won’t stop labeling criminals anytime soon.
For most people, though, being caught once is enough to discourage a 
criminal lifestyle. (They don’t move on to the secondary deviance stage.) In 
these cases, does forcing someone to carry the stigma of a conviction around 
for the rest of her life seem fair? For many low-level crimes, such as damaging 
property, driving with a suspended license, or getting in a bar fight, most 
people probably say no.
Because lawmakers understand to some extent the impact that labeling 
someone a criminal can have on that person, many states allow for expungement: 
a process that wipes a criminal conviction off someone’s record after a few 
years have passed. For example, in my home state, if a person is convicted 
of a misdemeanor, completes probation, and then avoids trouble for three 
years, she can ask a judge to remove the conviction and arrest from her 
record. Thereafter, when applying for a job, she can honestly answer that she 
has “never been convicted.”

212
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
	
Another way the law acknowledges the impact of labeling is through diversion 
programs. Diversion programs often give people who have been charged with 
nonviolent crimes a chance to avoid conviction if they comply with conditions 
set by a judge. In a diversion program, for example, a woman charged with 
possession of cocaine can pay her court costs and perhaps complete some 
drug treatment, and, as a result, the judge doesn’t enter a conviction against 
her. Thus, she doesn’t have to bear the stigma of having been convicted.
Diversion programs are the law’s attempt to prevent labeling people and 
unnecessarily harming their futures, as well as a way to avoid causing 
secondary deviance. These programs have been an excellent development 
in criminal law — when they’re run correctly. (Incidentally, they also save 
courts and jails millions of dollars.)
Finding the theory’s weakness
The first component of labeling theory — that people in power use crime 
labels to control the poor, minorities, and women — seems more difficult 
to support than the idea that the label can create the criminal. The vast 
majority of crimes are crimes that almost everyone agrees should be punished: 
theft, assault, driving while intoxicated, burglary, sex crimes, robbery, identity 
theft, and so on.
Passing laws to make these activities crimes and, thus, creating labels isn’t an 
example of the ruling class sticking it to the poor. Instead, these laws serve as 
an example of society’s attempts to control antisocial behavior, regardless of 
the skin color, gender, or income of the person committing the act.
A criminologist who subscribes to some other critical theory may respond 
to this argument by saying that the ruling class applies its criminal laws in 
a discriminatory manner. Hence, in the next sections, I move on to some of 
the theories that suggest discriminatory treatment of women, the poor, and 
minorities.
Exploring Feminist Theory
Critical feminist theory is actually a large group of theories linked by their 
focus on the power struggles between men and women. Generally, feminist 
theory holds that the following ideas are true:
 
✓ A significant cause of crime is the unequal power in society between 
men and women. Because men have most of the power, they can exploit 
women. This fact is particularly evident in crimes such as rape and 
domestic assault.

213
 Chapter 15: Critical Theory: Theories off the Beaten Path
 
✓ In today’s society, men are rewarded for their work outside the home, 
while women are encouraged to do unpaid housework or other 
undervalued jobs. Therefore, society’s version of capitalism allows 
men to control the power and exploit women — a system known as 
patriarchy.
 
✓ Some men victimize women as a means of control. But as women 
assume greater prominence in society and in the workforce, their power 
increases, and, as a result, they’re victimized less.
In support of this last point, feminist theorists refer to the fact that women 
in developed countries who have access to education and equal treatment in 
the workplace are less likely to be victims of assault, rape, or other gender-
based crimes than women in developing countries are.
Another arm of feminist theory attempts to explain why women commit 
fewer crimes than men. As I explain in Chapter 11, men are arrested three 
times as often as women. According to feminist theory, the reasons for this 
difference include the following:
 
✓ Under the patriarchal system, women are more likely to be isolated in 
homes and taking care of a family. As a result, they lack the opportunity 
to commit crimes that powerful men enjoy.
 
✓ Men and women are socialized differently as kids. Society teaches girls 
certain values that help to keep them in powerless, submissive roles. 
As a result, they’re less likely than men to engage in aggressive criminal 
conduct.
	
In the 1970s, some feminist criminologists predicted that as women took 
a more prominent role in the workforce, their percentage of crime would 
increase. And, as I explain in Chapter 11, while the crime rate for men has 
been dropping since 1998, the crime rate for women has been slowly rising.
Examining Leftist Realism: A Response 
to Law and Order
Some criminologists, known as left realists, reject what they perceive as the 
right-wing tilt of anticrime efforts in the last 30 years, including longer prison 
sentences for offenders and reduced funding for social programs. However, 
they also recognize that crime is a problem that society must take seriously. 
Violent criminals aren’t just victims abused by society, as old-school Marxist 
criminologists may have argued. They’re frequently dangerous people who 
must be locked up.

214
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
But, although left realists do recognize that society has an interest in holding 
criminals accountable for their crimes, they also see oppression in society, 
mainly in the struggles between the rich and the poor. Specifically, they 
believe the following:
 
✓ The poor are oppressed by capitalist forces.
 
✓ The poor are victimized by having to live in neighborhoods with high 
levels of crime.
Left realists attempt to identify realistic plans for dealing with crime that 
take into account social justice — a vague phrase that generally refers to the 
goal of taking a more holistic approach to dealing with crime. In other words, 
social justice involves fixing the problems in society that cause crime in the 
first place, such as improving neighborhood environments and reducing 
social class frustration.
Unlike some other critical criminologists, left realists don’t view members of 
the law enforcement community as tools of capitalist oppression but rather 
as necessary servants of the public. Nonetheless, society must guard against 
potential discriminatory abuses by law enforcement.
	
Recently, one significant focus of the left realist movement has been on 
opening up police forces to citizen involvement and control. For example, 
some cities are appointing civilian oversight boards to handle citizen 
complaints of police misconduct.
By implementing civilian oversight boards and ideas such as community 
policing, which encourage police to work proactively with neighborhood 
groups, left realists hope to encourage police to use means other than 
violence to maintain social order. (I discuss the practice of community 
policing in Chapter 16.)
Marxism
Marxism had a strong influence on the devel­
opment of critical criminology in the 1960s. 
Developed by Karl Marx, a 19th-century German 
economist, Marxism holds that society evolves 
through class struggle. Marxists believe that 
society will eventually evolve from capitalism to 
socialism as the working class rises up against 
the class that owns the means of production — 
essentially the people who own factories and 
industry. Marx and his cohort, Friedrich Engels, 
believed that the working class would inevitably 
revolt and overthrow the rich class in a revo­
lution that would ultimately end in a classless 
society in which the state would own all prop­
erty (in other words, the class revolt would end 
in communism).

215
 Chapter 15: Critical Theory: Theories off the Beaten Path
Making Peace
Borrowing from religious themes, peacemaking theory asserts that punishment 
and violence can’t end crime. Only through peace — that is, compassion, 
love, and forgiveness — can society overcome crime. (Interestingly, one 
of the leading proponents of peacemaking theory, Richard Quinney, was a 
former Marxist criminologist in the 1970s.)
Peacemaking theory isn’t so much a theory of what causes crime as a 
quasi-spiritual solution. It contends, like some religious faiths, that retribution 
and vengeance are improper motivations for punishment. By locking people 
up, society engages in the same acts as the criminal. Instead of looking for 
vengeance when punishing people for their crimes, society needs to build 
connections among people through concepts such as restorative justice 
(which I discuss in the next section) to overcome the crime problem.
The challenges of having civilians 
oversee police internal affairs
Many cities across the United States are hiring 
civilians to oversee citizen complaints of police 
misconduct. Other cities are appointing boards 
of volunteers to do the job. In part, this action 
is a response to the fact that police agencies 
investigate their own people through internal 
affairs departments. Civilians wonder whether 
coverups are taking place amidst these 
investigations. How do civilians know that the 
police sufficiently value the outsider’s point of 
view in such investigations?
Police often resent this interference by civilians, 
arguing that a civilian can’t fully understand 
what dealing with society’s worst criminals 
day after day is like. (I know an officer whose 
superior verbally reprimanded him for prolific 
cursing around bystanders while ordering an 
armed robber to drop his gun. Fifteen years 
later, this officer still resents the discipline.)
In one city (that shall remain nameless to 
protect the people involved), a situation arose 
that highlights the challenges of bringing 
civilians in to oversee police. Police arrested 
a drug dealer after they received a tip from an 
informant. The drug dealer accused the arresting 
officer of stealing some cash and lying about 
the information from the informant. The civilian 
hired to oversee police misconduct investiga­
tions in that city demanded the name of the 
informant to determine whether the officer was 
lying. The identity of an informant is closely 
guarded by police in any circumstance. In this 
case, the informant actually worked for an 
officer in another police department. The police 
speculated that this drug dealer cleverly made 
the allegation of police misconduct to try to 
identify the informant so that he could violently 
retaliate against that informant later.
What’s the proper course of action in this case? 
Should the overseer drop her investigation or 
pursue it? Should the police refuse to identify 
the informant? You can see some gray areas 
here, and the relationship between civilian 
overseers and police can get tense.

216
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
In reality, society would have a hard time turning the other cheek when faced 
with a rapist or child molester. I don’t know of any country that doesn’t 
punish acts, such as assault, theft, rape, and murder, which are all universally 
recognized as crimes.
But, at the individual level, acts of peacemaking can be inspiring. In many 
criminal cases, a victim or his family members are given the opportunity to 
address the court. In news reports, you may have heard some family member 
scream at the defendant, “I hope you rot in hell!” But, in other cases, you may 
have heard the media report that a family member announced to the judge 
that he forgives the murderer and hopes that the murderer can forgive 
himself. You can become very close to the victim’s family when you’re trying 
a murder case. I’ve stood in a courtroom and watched this type of compassion 
on display, and I’ve been amazed.
Seeking Healing through 
Restorative Justice
Instead of locking someone up and throwing away the key, restorative justice 
seeks to make victims whole, hold criminals accountable, and bring healing 
to the community. You’re probably thinking that this theory is a pretty 
ambitious one. Well, like peacemaking, restorative justice is less an explanation 
for why people commit crime and more an attempt to shift society from 
warehousing criminals to permanently solving the problem of crime.
Encouraging justice within a community
Many communities have implemented some form of restoration programs, 
particularly in dealing with juvenile delinquents. For example, some schools 
deal with delinquency by using a “court of peers.” Peer programs like this 
one try to bring the victims and the offenders together in a community-based 
setting rather than in a real courtroom. The offender must take responsibility 
for harming the victim, the victim has the chance to repair the damaged 
relationship, and community members can participate as encouragers.
	
Although courts of peers may work in schools, the sheer volume of crime in 
today’s society makes these kinds of time and labor-intensive programs difficult 
to implement on a broad scale. If society lived in small tribes, it could likely 
manage misconduct through community intervention; however, most people 
don’t live in a true community. Often your neighbors are strangers, and the 
people you do know are spread all over town and even across the country.

217
 Chapter 15: Critical Theory: Theories off the Beaten Path
I suppose you can argue that the constitutional right to a trial by jury began 
as a form of community involvement in the justice process. But, over time, 
the legal system has placed more and more procedural restrictions on 
criminal trials so that the opportunity for restorative justice by the jury has 
been eliminated. Today, jurors mostly determine guilt or innocence. They 
have no involvement with a victim, and they aren’t allowed even to speak to a 
defendant.
But, as critics of restorative justice point out, society has put these procedural 
restrictions in place to protect defendants against governmental abuse, as 
well as mob rule. Before such procedural safeguards existed, rough justice 
through mobs or even excessive governmental enforcement was more 
common.
Nonetheless, many (perhaps most) state court systems have attempted some 
initiatives in the spirit of restorative justice. For example, diversion programs, 
which I discuss in the “Labeling Someone a Criminal” section in this chapter, 
are part of states’ attempt to simultaneously make victims whole while not 
incarcerating or labeling defendants as criminals.
Such models of restorative justice can have an impact when an offender 
experiences remorse and feels an obligation to make things right for the 
victim and the community. But even the most ardent supporters of restorative 
justice acknowledge that some criminals are so dangerous and without 
remorse that society has to lock them up. Thus, thinking that imprisonment 
will someday go away is unrealistic.
One of the most ardent and effective supporters of restorative justice is 
Chuck Colson, a former aide to President Richard Nixon. Colson converted 
to Christianity around the time that he was convicted for his role in the 
Watergate scandal. After serving a prison sentence, he founded Prison 
Fellowship Ministries, a nonprofit organization that ministers the Christian 
faith to inmates, and has strongly advocated for community solutions rather 
than prison (except for violent offenders) for more than 30 years. From his 
personal experience, he contends that prison is dehumanizing and makes 
criminals worse citizens after they’re released. Given that roughly two out of 
three inmates reoffend within three years of their release from prison, Colson 
clearly has a point.
Debating treatment versus incarceration
Although I find restorative justice admirable and think efforts to increase its 
use in appropriate circumstances are worthwhile, I have seen policymakers 
clamor for one kind of treatment or another instead of imprisonment, 

218
Part III: Figuring Out Who Commits Crimes and Why 
ostensibly in the name of restorative justice. These policymakers frequently 
do so without much evidence that a particular treatment works. “Treatment” 
becomes an anti-incarceration mantra, irrespective of its effectiveness. (Call 
me cynical, but because treatment is cheaper than incarceration, I think 
some policymakers just want to save money for their own pet projects.)
In my opinion, the widespread employment of restorative justice for many 
crimes depends on whether or not treatment providers can develop effective 
treatments for offenders and then prove their effectiveness through legitimate 
studies. And, as Colson may assert, it may also depend on more than a little 
divine help.

Part IV
Fighting Crime

In this part . . .
A

s long as some people choose to commit crimes, 
other people will work to prevent those crimes and 
to arrest the bad guys. In this part, I introduce you to the 
people who fight crime at both the local and federal levels. 
Then I share some insight into the processes that law 
enforcement officers use to try to solve crimes.

Chapter 16
Battling Crime at the Local Level
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out how local law enforcement works
▶ Getting help from task forces and citizen cops
▶ Introducing theories about how to police effectively
A

bout 17,000 police agencies operate in the United States, and the vast 
majority of them are city and county agencies that answer to local 
public officials and citizens. Yet, local agencies certainly aren’t alone in the 
fight against crime: They’re joined by federal agencies (which I discuss in 
Chapter 17), state police, university police, and airport police.
In this chapter, I keep the focus squarely on local law enforcement. So the 
next time you see a police officer or two patrolling your neighborhood, you’ll 
have a better idea of what they’re doing to keep your hometown safe.
Keeping the Streets Clean: The 
Players at the Local Level
Unless you actually work for a police department or a sheriff’s office, the 
structures and jurisdictions may seem a bit murky. What’s the difference 
between a police chief and a sheriff? How about a sergeant and a detective? If 
you can’t answer with confidence, don’t stress; I’m here to guide you through 
the specifics.
Distinguishing sheriffs from police chiefs
Most people don’t know the difference between a sheriff’s office and a police 
department. Here’s how the jobs of a sheriff and a police chief differ:

222
Part IV: Fighting Crime 
 
✓ Sheriff: A sheriff is responsible for providing police services for an 
entire county. A sheriff is also often in charge of running the county jail, 
which is usually the primary local jail (although some police depart­
ments may have small holding facilities where they hold people before 
transporting them to the county jail).
	
	Sheriffs are elected by the public. Some sheriffs may be outstanding 
cops, and others may just be good politicians. I knew someone who was 
a typewriter repairman before being elected as the sheriff of a small 
county.
	
	The officers that work for a sheriff are called deputy sheriffs.
 
✓ Police chief: A police chief is the head of a police department, which 
typically is the law enforcement agency for a town or city. Frequently — 
and especially in small police departments — a person works his way 
up within the agency to be rewarded (or punished) with the position of 
chief.
	
	In large cities, police departments often do nationwide searches for their 
chiefs. For example, Bill Bratton was superintendent of the Boston Police 
Department and commissioner of the New York Police Department 
before becoming chief of the Los Angeles Police Department in 2002.
	
	Chiefs can also have names like superintendent, commissioner, and direc­
tor of public safety. Officers that work for a police chief are called police 
officers.
	
Both cities and counties are referred to as jurisdictions. A jurisdiction is the 
region in which an agency has authority. In a typical state,
 
✓ Police chiefs have jurisdiction over their cities or towns.
 
✓ Sheriffs have jurisdiction over their counties.
 
✓ Chiefs of state police have jurisdiction over the entire state.
	
Contrary to what you may have learned from the legendary TV series Hawaii 
Five-0 and its hero Steve McGarrett, Hawaii is the only state without a state 
police agency. Because more than one-fourth of the entire population of 
Hawaii live in Honolulu, the Honolulu Police Department is easily the largest 
law enforcement presence in the state.
Because cities are within counties, sometimes jurisdictional conflicts arise 
between police departments and sheriffs’ offices. But, for the most part, sher­
iff patrols stay away from the city unless they’re asked to help. As a result, 
sheriff’s offices generally patrol the parts of a county outside the city limits.
Both police chiefs and sheriffs are responsible for all the administrative tasks 
of running a police agency: hiring and disciplining staff, controlling budgets, 
reporting to city and county officials, and taking the heat from the press and 
the public when things go wrong. Being a police chief or sheriff is a very 
demanding job.

223
 Chapter 16: Battling Crime at the Local Level
Driving the streets: Patrol officers
	
The heart of any police department or sheriff’s office is its cadre of patrol 
officers. For simplicity’s sake, I refer just to police or patrol officers for the 
rest of this chapter. Unless I indicate otherwise, that reference also includes 
deputy sheriffs.
The vast majority of police in the United States patrol the streets in police 
vehicles. Their primary responsibilities are to
 
✓ Reduce the commission of crime with their preventive presence
 
✓ Respond to emergency 9-1-1 calls
 
✓ Identify and arrest criminals
 
✓ Enforce traffic laws and keep traffic moving safely
Roughly 80 percent of police departments in the United States require only a 
high school diploma to qualify to become an officer. (This number is some­
what deceiving, though, because larger agencies, which employ more offi­
cers, often require some level of college education.) In addition to education 
requirements, applicants usually must pass written and oral tests, receive an 
evaluation by a psychologist, and graduate from a police training academy.
	
A full-fledged police officer has to be sworn (meaning that he has to swear an 
oath to uphold the Constitution and the laws of his jurisdiction) before he can 
perform certain tasks. For example, a sworn police officer can legally carry a 
firearm, arrest someone, and write search warrant affidavits.
Many other people who work as government investigators aren’t sworn and, 
therefore, can’t perform these tasks. For example, a state health licensing 
agency may have a civil investigator who makes sure that beauty salons are 
properly licensed and follow all health codes. However, that investigator 
can’t arrest someone or conduct a search (although he may be able to issue a 
citation or a fine).
In the old days, most patrol officers walked a beat — in other words, they 
focused on a specific neighborhood. Today only a few officers have that 
type of job (see the following section on community officers). Instead, most 
officers ride in cars and have a much wider area to patrol. As a result, more 
officers are available to respond to any given situation, and they can do so 
faster.
For example, when a report comes in of a convenience store robbery in prog­
ress, the closest patrol officer arrives first, but three more cars may quickly 
follow. This additional support can help in an arrest, a pursuit, or a search of 
the surrounding area for the suspect. (As gas prices rose to historic levels in 
2008, some police departments actually ordered their patrol officers to park 
their cars rather than drive around.)

224
Part IV: Fighting Crime 
For every arrest or investigation, police officers must write a police report. 
This report details what an officer did during the investigation and identifies 
whom the officer interviewed. If an arrest is made, the police report is the 
primary means for the officer to communicate to the district attorney what 
the crime was and what evidence will help prove the crime. District attorneys 
rely heavily on police reports when deciding whether to file criminal charges.
Most police departments provide 24-hour police services, which means 
that officers work different shifts. An officer may work the same shift for six 
months and then switch to another. After all, retaining officers would be dif­
ficult if they had to work the night shift throughout their whole careers.
Focusing on neighborhoods: 
Community officers
Community officers are police officers assigned to specific areas within a juris­
diction to develop relationships with citizens in the area. These officers may 
walk a beat or ride a bicycle in their particular areas of patrol. They’re usu­
ally assigned as part of a community policing effort, which I discuss in detail 
in the “Policing at the community level” section later in this chapter.
	
Having community officers requires a tradeoff. On the one hand, community 
officers may help develop neighborhood watch programs and hold com­
munity meetings to identify public safety issues, which, in turn, allows the 
community to address those issues before they become big problems. On 
the other hand, diverting some officers to community patrols means having 
fewer patrol officers in vehicles able to respond quickly to crimes that 
happen across town.
Community policing efforts over the last 30 years have been very successful 
at decreasing citizens’ fear of crime.
Supervising patrol officers: Sergeants
In most police departments, a sergeant is the direct supervisor of patrol offi­
cers. He or she typically oversees five to ten officers and is promoted from 
being one of the troops. Not only does the sergeant supervise the officers 
and hand out assignments, but he also typically reviews and approves every 
police report his officers write. This task can be a challenge because busy 
officers write a lot of reports.
	
If you ever get the chance to ride along with a police officer on patrol (such 
an experience is cleverly called a ride-along by those in the know), ask to ride 
with the night-shift sergeant. The sergeant typically goes to wherever the 
action is — and most of the action is at night — so you’ll see a lot of activity.

225
 Chapter 16: Battling Crime at the Local Level
Investigating crimes: Detectives
When you watch a cop show on TV, odds are that the show depicts detectives 
(very unrealistically, I might add). In a nutshell, detectives are responsible for 
conducting investigations.
Although patrol officers respond to crime scenes, they usually don’t conduct 
long-term investigations to solve crimes. The exception is in small police 
departments that don’t have any detectives; in those departments, patrol 
officers must do everything, including conduct investigations.
Detectives — usually not in uniform — try to solve serious felony crimes. A 
detective responds to a crime scene and reviews physical evidence, such as 
fingerprints, blood spatter, and injuries. (Remember that the patrol officer is 
usually the first to arrive at a crime scene.) The detective also identifies 
witnesses and interviews them.
A shorthand way of referring to a detective, still used by old-timers, is dick. 
No kidding. Often, dicks specialize in certain types of crime and work in one 
of the following detective units:
 
✓ Robbery and homicide
 
✓ Drugs and vice (which primarily refers to prostitution)
 
✓ Property and financial crimes
 
✓ Gangs
In many departments, patrol officers rotate to the detective unit and then 
back to patrol. The idea is that rotation gives more officers the chance to 
learn how to conduct investigations, which leads to better officers throughout 
the department. In other agencies, detectives who display particular talent 
for investigations may stay detectives for their whole careers.
Drug and vice detectives are usually considered the “cowboys” of a police 
department. They often work undercover and use informants (citizens who 
have information about the conduct of criminals) to buy drugs, and they’re 
involved in high-risk police actions, such as executing search warrants. For 
example, they may have to enter a home quickly before bad guys flush drugs 
and other evidence down the toilet.
Homicide is the most serious crime, of course, so many detectives view this 
assignment to be the most important among all detectives. But I’ve known 
both good and bad homicide detectives, as well as good and bad narcs (the 
nickname given to drug detectives).
Like patrol officers, detectives report to a sergeant (known, creatively 
enough, as a detective sergeant).

Part IV: Fighting Crime 
To become a detective, a patrol officer must seek a promotion. Often this 
process involves a written test and then oral boards, during which senior 
detectives ask questions of the candidate. Detectives usually earn higher 
salaries than patrol officers.
The skills that departments look for in selecting new detectives include the 
following:
 
✓ Good communication skills: One of the hallmarks of a good detective is 
the ability to interview suspects and get them to confess.
 
✓ Attention to detail: Proving a criminal case often hinges on just one key 
fact, which a good detective can identify.
 
✓ Self-motivation: Detectives are on their own a lot, so a good one isn’t 
lazy.
Giving police officers special assignments
Police officers can be assigned many specialized duties within a department. 
Some assignments are considered plum jobs, while others (such as internal 
affairs) are less attractive. Some special assignments include
 
✓ Accident reconstruction: When someone dies in a car crash, a police 
department often assigns one or more specially trained officers to 
determine how the crash occurred and whether someone was criminally 
responsible.
 
✓ Internal affairs: The officers who work in internal affairs are essentially 
the police’s police. When a police officer violates policy or even commits 
a crime, most medium-sized or large police agencies have officers who 
investigate such internal misconduct.
 
✓ Computer forensics: Specially trained officers with this assignment 
know how to retrieve evidence from computers and phones without 
altering that evidence.
 
✓ Training coordination: Police must undergo constant training on the 
law, firearms use, use of other physical force, driving, and many other 
topics. Most agencies have at least one person assigned to arrange for 
appropriate and necessary training. Large agencies may have an entire 
unit assigned to training.
 
✓ Jail operation: Sheriffs’ offices are usually responsible for operating 
county jails, which means they need many people to perform the 
required jail tasks, such as controlling inmates and providing security. 
For more information about jail operations, turn to Chapter 21.

227
 Chapter 16: Battling Crime at the Local Level
 
✓ Bomb squad: In 2007, law enforcement agencies reported 2,772 
explosive incidents to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
Explosives (ATF). That number includes both actual bombs and hoaxes. 
Specially trained police officers must respond to each incident with 
great care and neutralize the suspected bomb. (Although many incidents 
do turn out to be hoaxes, you can’t underestimate the seriousness of 
this assignment. In 2008, a friend of mine, who served on a bomb squad, 
died while attempting to disarm a bomb in a bank.)
 
✓ Gang enforcement officer: Gang enforcement officers work in the 
world of street gangs. Their main duties are to prevent gang crime 
and to investigate it when it does occur. Gang officers do their job by 
developing expertise in gang culture and building relationships with 
gang members and informants.
Counting on civilian employees
Every police department depends heavily on civilian employees, or employees 
who aren’t sworn officers. If you’re interested in finding out more about a 
particular civilian job with a police or sheriff’s department, check out 
Chapter 23. Here are some key positions that civilians fill in most departments:
 
✓ Evidence technician: This person receives evidence from a police 
officer, identifies it, records it in a log, and places it in a secure evidence 
room. This job is crucial because a sloppy evidence locker results in 
evidence being lost or mishandled, which, in turn, leads to criminal 
cases being dismissed.
 
✓ Forensic specialist: Many larger departments have their own forensic 
scientists who respond to crime scenes to retrieve evidence and then 
process that evidence in a lab. For example, a forensic specialist may 
receive a semen sample from a rape victim and conduct a DNA test to 
see whether the semen matches the suspect.
 
✓ Secretary: Patrol officers and especially detectives need someone to 
transcribe taped interviews, proofread police reports, arrange for travel, 
and do all the little things that help an organization work smoothly.
 
✓ Parking enforcer: A larger agency usually doesn’t want its officers spending 
time writing parking tickets. But tickets are a good source of revenue, so 
some departments employ civilians to do this dirty job for them.
 
✓ Crime analyst: Analysts can identify crime trends from statistics, help 
detectives organize complex cases, manage wiretaps and phone record 
data, and much more. See the section “Adopting intelligence-led policing” 
for more information about the duties of an analyst. I highly value good 
analysts and believe this position is crucial to good detective work in 
the 21st century.

228
Part IV: Fighting Crime 
Greater than the sum of 
their parts: Task forces
Frequently, officers from different agencies band together in task forces to 
combat a particular type of crime.
In law enforcement, a task force is made up of officers from different agencies 
who focus on a certain type of crime, usually some type of organized crime. 
For example, because drug dealers work across jurisdictional boundaries, 
officers from different jurisdictions can be more effective by working 
together. Gang task forces are also common because gangs cross jurisdictional 
boundaries, too. Such task forces often include local, state, and federal officers.
A smaller agency may participate in a major crime task force. Unlike drug and 
gang task forces, members of a major crime task force usually don’t work 
out of the same office. But when a murder or other violent felony occurs, 
the major crime team comes together to conduct the investigation because 
small departments often don’t have enough qualified detectives to do a major 
crime investigation. By pooling resources, they can get the job done. (For 
instance, when a person commits a murder in Mayberry, Sheriff Andy Taylor 
isn’t left only with Barney; he can also rely on the hot shots from Mount Pilot 
to help.)
Bringing in citizen cops: Reserves
Most police agencies rely on a cadre of citizen volunteers to handle many 
police functions. These citizens are known as reserve officers or reserves. 
Reserves may provide the following types of police services:
 
✓ Traffic and pedestrian control at parades
 
✓ Security at sporting events
 
✓ Desk duties, such as answering phones and taking complaints
 
✓ Transportation of prisoners
All reserves go through some level of training which varies from department 
to department. If they’re properly trained, some reserves may also perform 
full law enforcement duties, including patrols and arrests. Reserves who can 
perform these duties usually have to work under the supervision of a full-
time, paid officer.
Chances are good that the next time you go to a county fair or parade, the 
officer directing traffic will be a reserve. Say hi and thank him because he’s 
probably standing out in the hot sun for free.

229
 Chapter 16: Battling Crime at the Local Level
Thinking about Theories of Policing
A small branch of criminology studies complex theories of how police function 
in various societies, including Western, Islamic, European, Asian, and totalitarian 
countries. These criminologists may also study the sociolegal implications of 
how and why police exercise the force they do. Don’t worry; I don’t get into 
that type of discussion here.
In this section, I focus on three practical approaches to improving police 
work that police departments throughout the United States have adopted in 
varying degrees.
Policing at the community level
Over the last three decades, community policing has become a buzz phrase 
within law enforcement — kind of a generalized concept that many street 
cops don’t fully understand, even as they participate in it. To help you better 
understand community policing, I want to take a quick look at how policing 
evolved in the 20th century.
Earlier in U.S. history, police were integrated into the fabric of society. They 
walked a beat, getting to know shopkeepers and families in a particular 
community. Police were responsive to the needs of the community and, in a 
democratic society, worked for the community. The police officer gathered 
information from the citizens and helped provide protection and all kinds 
of services. At least, this is the romantic, nostalgic view many people today 
have of how policing used to work.
On the down side, these police were highly susceptible to corruption and 
influence. By today’s standards, they were relatively untrained and often 
resorted to street justice instead of enforcing laws by the books. As a result, a 
movement developed in U.S. policing away from this community-based model 
to a more efficient and professional crime-fighting model.
Eventually, this change led police to become more centralized with fewer 
precincts. Instead of trying to flag down the neighborhood cop for help, 
citizens were supposed to call the local precinct, which would then quickly 
dispatch a patrol car to the scene.
Over time, this change had several effects: Corruption decreased and police 
were quicker to respond to crime, but, at the same time, communities 
became more disconnected from police. Without a neighborhood officer in 
sight, the fear of crime grew. And amid the political tumult of the 1960s, many 
people grew concerned that officers were abusing their authority, and, thus, 
they became more distrustful of police.

230
Part IV: Fighting Crime 
Making way for community policing
In response, beginning in the late 1970s, police agencies and the politicians 
they reported to sought a new way of protecting communities. What arose 
was the concept of community policing, which is something of a compromise 
between the two historical approaches. Community policing is meant to 
reconnect police with the community, reducing fear and distrust, while also 
maintaining professionalism, integrity, and quick response to incidents.
Here are some ways that community policing plays out:
 
✓ Police departments create more precincts, or substations, so that people 
are aware of a police presence in their neighborhoods.
 
✓ In some urban areas, police departments reinstitute foot patrols. 
(Obviously, such patrols aren’t practical in most parts of suburban and 
rural America.)
 
✓ Police hold regular community meetings with citizens to build 
relationships to help identify problems early on.
 
✓ Many police departments train their community officers in special 
problem-solving skills to remedy smaller issues without resorting to 
arrest.
Other public safety professionals have also adopted a community approach. 
For example, community prosecutors may handle some cases in a neighborhood 
courtroom and work with citizens to attack a specific crime problem through 
enforcement, prosecution, legislation, or other nontraditional approaches.
Understanding the challenges
	
The community policing model does have its problems, however. For one, it’s 
a rather vague philosophy that can be tough for police and communities to 
understand. It places significant responsibilities on community officers to be 
involved in nontraditional police duties, such as community problem solving. 
Given that the vast majority of police agencies require only a high school 
diploma for their officers — and given that solving other people’s problems 
is one of the most difficult tasks out there — the expectations for community 
officers can sometimes be too great.
Another challenge with community policing is getting the community 
involved. In surveys of community policing efforts, the citizens’ knowledge 
of the program has been crucial in reducing levels of community fear. The 
citizens who are most likely to be fearful of crime — the elderly — are 
consistently the least likely to know about community policing efforts.
Yet another challenge stems from the fact that police are typically rewarded 
with promotions and status for good arrests, not for effective problem solving. 
Thus, altering police reward structures to somehow account for good 
community policing has posed problems, too.

231
 Chapter 16: Battling Crime at the Local Level
Keeping in mind the positives
Community policing has been around since the late 1970s, so criminologists 
should be able to say whether it works or not, right? Not quite. As I explain in 
Chapter 3, reliable statistics about crime and crime fighting are very difficult 
to find. Generally, studies comparing departments that use community 
policing with departments that don’t use it haven’t shown a significant 
difference in the amount of crime in each community.
However, some studies have shown greater satisfaction among citizens with 
the police department’s performance and decreased citizen fear of crime in 
neighborhoods where community policing is used. Another positive outcome 
is that community officers who have been specially trained in problem 
solving tend to report slightly greater job satisfaction over time than officers 
in more traditional police roles.
Fixing broken windows
In the mid-1970s, New Jersey embarked on a significant community policing 
effort to get officers to walk beats in 28 different cities. A review after five 
years concluded that crime rates hadn’t dropped at all but that citizens in 
those cities believed crime rates had dropped and believed they were safer.
In a landmark article written by George L. Kelling and James Q. Wilson that 
appeared in the March 1982 issue of The Atlantic, the authors argued that 
people in New Jersey felt safer, in part, because the presence of police helped 
maintain public order. Cops walking a beat moved drunks, beggars, and drug 
addicts out of the communities. Likewise, those same cops closely monitored 
strangers and quieted disruptive teenagers. In general, the heightened police 
presence led to greater public order, which, however, wasn’t reflected in 
crime statistics.
	
From this article developed the theory of policing known as the broken win­
dows theory. This theory argues that a building with a broken window that 
isn’t repaired will soon have a second broken window, and then a third, and so 
on. If vandals perceive that no one cares about the building, they’ll attack it. 
But if the first broken window is immediately repaired, vandals are less likely 
to break another one. Lack of attention to minor issues like broken windows 
leads a community to spiral downward into greater issues. After all the win­
dows are broken, vandals may be more likely to conclude that no one cares 
about the neighborhood, and, as a result, they’ll attack the next building on 
the block. Ultimately, lack of attention to fixing problems leads to the destruc­
tion of neighborhoods. People feel less safe on the street, families move out, 
and, eventually, serious crime increases.

232
Part IV: Fighting Crime 
	
The New York City Transit Police put the broken windows theory into practice 
in 1990 by cracking down on people who weren’t paying subway fares. New 
York police later expanded the program citywide and called it zero tolerance. 
They focused on low-level crime, such as public drinking, public urinating, and 
squeegee extortioners — people who dirty windshields and then ask for money 
to clean them. Rates of both low-level and serious crime fell significantly in 
New York throughout the 1990s, and many in the police department and the 
media hailed the zero-tolerance policy as the reason behind the drop.
As I note in Chapter 3, criminologists argue about why crime dropped so 
much in the 1990s. Critics of the broken windows theory point out that crime 
dropped nationwide during the 1990s, including in many cities that hadn’t 
adopted any new theory of policing. Other studies have found little correla­
tion between the implementation of a zero-tolerance policy and a reduction 
in serious crime. But the criticism has focused more on claims that policies 
such as zero tolerance reduce serious crime and less on the idea that atten­
tion to small problems (like quickly fixing a broken window) deters other low-
level crimes and improves social order in a neighborhood.
Adopting intelligence-led policing
A third modern theory of policing is intelligence-led policing. This theory 
involves using information to direct police efforts and make police more 
effective. Since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the intelligence-led policing 
model has received wide endorsement and encouragement from police 
organizations such as the International Association of Chiefs of Police. 
Nevertheless, most police agencies haven’t adopted intelligence-led policing.
Noticing how intelligence can help
What is intelligence in terms of this particular theory? At the most basic level, 
it’s sensitive information that may not be useable as evidence in a trial but 
that still points to criminal activity. For example, a woman tells an officer that 
her neighbor is up all night and has a lot of vehicle traffic at his house. She 
also says she overheard a visitor say something about buying cocaine. This 
information is criminal intelligence that helps a detective decide to open an 
investigation.
Intelligence can come from many sources, but the following are some of the 
most common:
 
✓ Tips and information from concerned citizens
 
✓ Information from informants, who are sometimes paid by police to get 
inside criminal organizations
 
✓ Intercepted jail communications, such as pieces of mail, notes passed 
between inmates, and recorded phone calls

233
 Chapter 16: Battling Crime at the Local Level
 
✓ Surveillance of suspected criminals
 
✓ Undercover police operations
 
✓ A suspect’s garbage
The components of effective intelligence-led policing are deceptively simple:
 
✓ A department establishes a method for collecting and storing information.
 
✓ An analyst compiles the collected information and makes sense of it.
 
✓ Police leadership uses the analyst’s product to design crime suppression 
strategies.
 
✓ Police officers implement the strategies.
For example, citizens in a community complain to their city council about 
a gang problem. Police begin to collect information about gang members in 
their daily activities. One officer is called to a gang fight in a park. She 
identifies the gang members, documents how she knows they belong to a 
gang, and writes a police report about everyone involved in the incident. 
Over the course of several months, the police department sends every police 
report about gang activity to an analyst, who documents the gang membership 
and leadership, their territory, the crimes they commit, and the most 
dangerous members. The analyst then gives this information to leadership 
in the police department, which devises a strategy to conduct surveillance 
on three identified gang leaders whom the analyst deemed the most violent. 
Meanwhile, a group of social workers start a gang intervention program in 
the gang’s neighborhood to target the nonviolent members to try to separate 
them from the gang lifestyle.
Aside from police reports, police also record valuable case intelligence in 
one of six regional intelligence databases, which are all connected via the 
nationwide Regional Information Sharing System (RISS). RISS is a federally 
funded program that provides secure, online databases in which police from 
different agencies and even different states can share their suspect intelligence. 
RISS is one of the best uses of federal dollars in law enforcement because it 
greatly improves the efficiency of investigations.
Taking a look at the challenges
Unfortunately, intelligence programs have a bit of a black eye in the law 
enforcement community. In the late 20th century, many police agencies tried 
to develop intelligence programs. But often these programs consisted of a 
unit of detectives who received information from other officers and did 
nothing with it. Intel units, as these units were called, developed a nationwide 
reputation as “black holes.” Information went in, but nothing came out. As a 
result, other officers stopped feeding information into these units. Today, as 
some advocate this newer model for using intelligence, many people in police 
leadership remember the less-than-successful intel initiatives of the past and 
are resistant.

234
Part IV: Fighting Crime 
Here are some of the other challenges to the intelligence-led policing model:
 
✓ Most police agencies don’t have analysts. Very few analyst training 
programs exist, and, as a result, the pool of qualified analysts is small.
 
✓ Most police agencies don’t have a strategy for collecting information or 
compiling the information they have. Cops write reports of their activities, 
but the reports’ purpose is just to document arrests and other incidents. 
These reports may go to the district attorney for filing charges, but the 
information isn’t used for any other purpose. Also, most police departments 
don’t train their officers to gather intelligence for later use by an analyst.
 
✓ Politicians who oversee police efforts fear the word intelligence because 
it conjures images of CIA operatives digging into citizens’ private lives.
Despite these challenges, as police agencies improve their ability to gather 
information through the use of electronic databases and technology, I believe 
intelligence-led policing will be the most effective way to attack serious 
organized crime threats, such as gangs, drugs, property crimes, and terrorism.

Federal Level
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying the federal agencies that fight crime
▶ Recognizing each agency’s specific role
▶ Connecting federal and local crime-fighting efforts
M

ost people who work in the criminal justice system work for a local 
government (see Chapter 16 for more on local crime-fighting efforts). 
But federal officers (or feds, as many people call them) play a very significant 
role in the criminal justice process. Roughly 106,000 federal officers working 
for over 65 different federal agencies have the authority to make arrests and 
carry firearms anywhere in the United States. (Of course, not every federal 
officer can make an arrest for every crime. After all, you probably don’t 
want the Bureau of Engraving and Printing Police doing major narcotics 
investigations!)
In this chapter, I focus on introducing you to some of the biggies in the 
federal fight against crime. I also explain how federal and local law 
enforcement work together to beat the bad guys.
Sorting through the Alphabet 
Soup of Federal Agencies
Perhaps no other profession is more filled with acronyms than law enforcement. 
With only two exceptions, every major federal law enforcement agency is 
referred to by a series of letters. (You get bonus points if you can guess the 
two exceptions before you read any farther.)

236
Part IV: Fighting Crime 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
In 1908, under President Theodore Roosevelt, the U.S. Attorney General 
appointed 34 men as “special agents” for the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Although it had no formal name at this point, these special agents became 
known as the Bureau of Investigation. Their appointment was a controversial 
action because states believed that most governmental responsibilities 
should rest in the states’ hands. Besides, very few crimes were considered 
federal at the time.
In 1910, Congress passed the Mann Act (technically called the White-Slave 
Traffic Act), which made transporting women over state lines for immoral 
purposes a federal crime. This act led to a quick expansion of the Bureau of 
Investigation. By 1917, the bureau employed more than 300 special agents.
In 1935, the agency’s name was formally changed to the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI). Today, the FBI employs roughly 13,000 special agents and 
30,000 people total.
The FBI is part of the U.S. Department of Justice, but the FBI director is 
specially appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by 
the Senate. The director serves for a period of ten years. This ten-year term 
is supposed to remove the director somewhat from the political process 
(because the position doesn’t change with each new president). The limit 
on each director’s service is a direct result of the fact that J. Edgar Hoover 
became the veritable king of the FBI, serving as director from 1924 to 1972, 
when he died.
Every major U.S. city has an FBI field office, which is simply an office of FBI 
agents located outside the headquarters in Washington, D.C. Each field office 
of the FBI is run by a special agent in charge, known as a SAC (pronounced 
“sack”).
The FBI’s responsibilities
The FBI’s role has changed dramatically through the years. For example, in 
the 1980s, the FBI was responsible for counterespionage, or tracking spies 
from other countries in the United States. At the same time, it was heavily 
involved in fighting organized crime, including the Italian Mafia in the United 
States. As the international drug trade exploded on U.S. soil in the 1980s, 
the FBI also took responsibility for part of the mission to fight the drug war. 
Plus, it played a large role in combating white-collar crime. As violent crime 
exploded in the late 1980s, the FBI added violent crime to its list of priorities. 
And, with the rise of the Internet in the 21st century, the FBI has taken on a 
significant role in combating computer crime.

237
 Chapter 17: Tackling Crime at the Federal Level
	
But on September 11, 2001, the FBI’s mission changed significantly. Today its 
primary mission is to protect the United States against terrorist threats. 
However, the bureau continues to be involved in other areas of crime, as well.
As of this writing, here are the FBI’s top eight priorities, in order:
 
✓ Protect the United States from terrorist attacks.
 
✓ Protect the United States against foreign intelligence operations and 
espionage.
 
✓ Protect the United States against cyber-based attacks and high-technology 
crimes.
 
✓ Combat public corruption at all levels.
 
✓ Protect civil rights.
 
✓ Combat transnational/national criminal organizations and enterprises.
 
✓ Combat major white-collar crimes.
 
✓ Combat significant violent crimes.
A special agent’s job
An FBI special agent has a much different role in fighting crime than most 
local patrol officers do. For instance, special agents don’t enforce traffic laws, 
and they don’t respond to 9-1-1 calls. And because the number of FBI special 
agents is so small compared to the overall crime threat in the United States, 
they typically don’t become involved in an investigation unless it’s very 
serious. Usually, they take part in longer-term investigations and gather 
evidence by interviewing witnesses, conducting surveillance, issuing 
subpoenas for records, going undercover, and managing informants (which 
means using citizens, and often criminals, to get inside a criminal organization 
to find out what’s happening).
Many special agents participate in task forces that involve local police and 
other federal agents. For example, the FBI has set up Joint Terrorism Task 
Forces (JTTFs) throughout the United States, which are made up of local, 
state, and other federal agency officers, along with FBI special agents. The 
JTTFs investigate activities of terrorists. (See Chapter 10 for a detailed 
discussion of terrorism.)
The FBI also has jurisdiction over bank robberies, and these cases are 
another example where local police and the FBI attempt to work closely 
together.

238
Part IV: Fighting Crime 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms 
and Explosives (ATF)
Can you guess which types of crimes this bureau investigates? Formerly part 
of the U.S. Treasury Department, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms 
and Explosives (ATF) became part of the U.S. Department of Justice in 2002 
(after the 9/11 attacks), and the word Explosives became part of its title. 
Because the bureau was known as the ATF for so many years, that acronym 
stuck.
The ATF got its start in 1920 during the era of prohibition; hence, it was called 
the Bureau of Prohibition. This agency employed Elliot Ness and his crew of 
agents nicknamed “the Untouchables,” who took down gangster Al Capone 
in Chicago. After the government legalized alcohol in 1933, its agents became 
known as revenuers because they were responsible for enforcing alcohol tax 
laws and protecting tax revenue. In the 1950s and 1960s, the agency took on 
responsibility for regulating tobacco and gun crimes, as well.
Roughly 2,400 special agents and about 2,600 other employees work for the 
ATF today. The agency has several programs, each with its own responsibilities, 
including the following:
 
✓ Firearms regulation: Some agency employees are responsible for 
enforcing all gun regulatory laws, such as complying with the requirements 
of the federal firearms licenses. Employees in this program inspect gun 
sellers to make sure they’re in compliance with such laws.
 
✓ Arsons, explosives, and firearms investigations: ATF special agents have 
the broad authority to enforce any federal criminal law. But their primary 
responsibility is to investigate federal crimes committed with explosives 
or firearms. To be clear, the ATF doesn’t take over every criminal investi­
gation that involves a gun. In fact, local law enforcement investigates the 
vast majority of violent crimes committed with firearms. However, the 
ATF often takes a lead role in investigations involving large-scale weapons 
trafficking (sometimes involving motorcycle gangs) as well as significant 
bomb cases. (See Chapter 8 for more on motorcycle gangs.)
	
	For example, the ATF played a prominent role in tracking the vehicle 
used in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which ultimately led to 
the arrest of the perpetrators.
	
	In 2006, the ATF investigated 3,445 explosive incidents that resulted in 
135 injuries and 14 deaths. Of these incidents, the agency referred 745 
cases for prosecution.
 
✓ Alcohol and tobacco tax revenue: Other ATF agents are responsible for 
investigating crimes that involve tobacco and alcohol diversion (which 
means smuggling to avoid taxes or other laws). Avoiding the tax on 
these products can lead to big money, and organized crime groups are 
frequently involved in diversion crimes.

239
 Chapter 17: Tackling Crime at the Federal Level
	
	For instance, criminals often try to sell cigarettes on the black market 
to avoid paying taxes and to make greater profits. The 2009 federal 
cigarette tax is $1.01 per pack, and some state taxes are much higher. 
For example, the cigarette tax in New York City totals $5.26 per pack. A 
criminal can sell a semitrailer full of cigarettes on the black market in 
New York for more than $3 million. (Don’t try this scheme at home — 
selling cigarettes without paying taxes is illegal and can be dangerous to 
your health.)
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is a part of the U.S. Department 
of Justice. DEA special agents enforce federal laws that deal with controlled 
substances. Although their responsibilities include regulating the pharmaceu­
tical industry, they’re primarily known as the federal drug cops, who take on 
large-scale narcotics-trafficking organizations. Richard Nixon created the DEA 
in 1973 in reaction to the growing national drug problem at the time. Today, 
the agency employs about 5,200 special agents. Most of these agents work in 
the United States, but some work in 63 other countries around the world.
	
As I discuss in Chapter 9, illegal drugs are the primary driver of organized 
crime in the world, so the DEA’s mission is terribly important. However, like 
other federal agencies, the DEA has suffered significant funding cutbacks 
during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan because so many U.S. tax dollars have 
been spent fighting wars overseas.
Because the drug problem in the United States is so large, and because the 
number of DEA special agents is relatively low, the DEA routinely partners 
up with local law enforcement via task forces. This allows local officers to 
receive temporary federal authority which gives them the ability to subpoena 
phone and Internet records under federal law. These and other benefits of 
federal authority can help local officers identify important evidence.
DEA special agents also work closely with federal prosecutors in U.S. attorney 
offices to try to dismantle big-time drug-trafficking organizations (known 
in the business as DTOs). This work often involves using mobile tracking 
devices, surveillance cameras, satellite and aeronautical imagery, and wire­
taps. As I write this chapter, the DEA is working with state prosecutors in my 
office on two separate wiretaps to bring down heroin and cocaine organiza­
tions on the West Coast.
One of the most significant contributions the DEA makes to the U.S. drug 
enforcement effort is its worldwide access to intelligence about international 
drug-trafficking activities. A local police agency would never have access to 
this type of information.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
(ICE)
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) wins the award for best 
acronym. ICE is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and was 
formed in 2003 in response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11. The Immigration 
and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Customs Service, and the U.S. Federal 
Protective Service merged to create ICE.
ICE’s mission is not only to enforce immigration laws but also to target 
criminal networks and terrorist organizations that seek to exploit vulnerabilities 
in the U.S. immigration system, in the U.S. financial networks, along U.S. 
borders, and at federal facilities. ICE has over 17,000 employees.
Feds on the big screen
The storylines aren’t always true to life, but 
seeing how various federal agencies are 
depicted in the movies can still be fun. Here are 
a few movies that portray federal agencies in 
all their glory:
The FBI:
 ✓ Silence of the Lambs: Jodie Foster plays 
a young FBI agent up against cannibal 
Hannibal Lecter. It features the grossest 
meal description ever — a victim’s liver 
with fava beans and a nice Chianti.
 ✓ Point Break: Keanu Reeves stars as a new 
FBI special agent and former college quar­
terback who goes undercover as a surfer to 
catch Zen-like bank robbers — probably not 
a fair and honest picture of life in the FBI.
The Secret Service:
 ✓ To Live and Die in LA: William Peterson 
stars as a Secret Service agent who tracks 
counterfeiters and protects the president.
 ✓ In the Line of Fire: Clint Eastwood stars as a 
Secret Service agent who tries to make up 
for not saving President Kennedy.
U.S. Marshal:
 ✓ The Fugitive: Tommy Lee Jones plays a 
deputy U.S. marshal who tries to track 
down a fugitive, played by Harrison Ford.
The DEA:
 ✓ Traffic: DEA agents pursue a drug lord’s 
wife, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, who 
has taken over her husband’s business.
Border Patrol:
 ✓ The Border: Jack Nicholson plays a dirty 
Border Patrol agent who tries to clean up 
his act.

241
 Chapter 17: Tackling Crime at the Federal Level
	
Because of ICE’s broad authority, an ICE special agent can be involved in a 
variety of criminal investigations, including human smuggling and trafficking, 
narcotics, immigration crimes, child pornography, gangs, financial crimes, 
weapons smuggling, and terrorism. In addition, the U.S. Federal Protective 
Service, which is part of ICE, is responsible for protecting federal agencies and 
buildings. The U.S. Federal Protective Service alone employs more than 2,000 
federal law enforcement officers and has 15,000 contract security guards.
Because of the significant presence of foreign organized crime in the United 
States, the law enforcement community highly values ICE special agents. 
Frequently, the government can most easily deal with a foreign criminal 
offender by using a federal conviction for illegal reentry (which means an 
illegal second entry into the country). Illegal reentry is often much easier 
to prove than other more complex crimes that require more laborious state 
prosecutions — prosecutions that may not end with any significant punishment. 
(People prosecuted for illegal reentry almost always have a significant 
criminal record in addition to their immigration crimes.)
Secret Service
What, no acronym? The U.S. Secret Service is another part of the U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security. It was created in 1865 to fight counterfeit 
currency. (If you’re of a certain age, you may remember that James West 
of the TV series The Wild, Wild West was a Secret Service agent.) Although 
the Secret Service was originally a part of the U.S. Treasury Department, it 
moved to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security after 9/11. The Secret 
Service has two missions:
 
✓ To protect visiting foreign officials and U.S. officials (most notably the 
president).
 
✓ To conduct criminal investigations to maintain the integrity of the 
nation’s financial infrastructure. This responsibility goes well beyond 
investigating counterfeiting and includes almost every conceivable type 
of financial fraud and systematic identity theft.
There are 3,200 special agents with the Secret Service who conduct criminal 
investigations regarding threats to dignitaries, as well as significant financial 
crimes. There are another 1,300 Secret Service officers who wear uniforms 
and provide security for the White House, the vice president’s residence, and 
foreign missions and embassies in Washington, D.C.

242
Part IV: Fighting Crime 
U.S. Marshals Service
For my money, there’s no better job title anywhere than being a U.S. Marshal. 
Notice that marshal has just one L, a fact that everyone in the Marshals 
Service is quick to point out. In existence since 1789, the U.S. Marshals 
Service is the oldest federal law enforcement agency. It’s a part of the U.S. 
Department of Justice. One U.S. marshal is appointed for each of 94 separate 
districts in the United States, and each marshal has deputies who work under 
him or her. More than 3,200 deputy marshals and criminal investigators work 
in this agency.
One of the most significant responsibilities of the Marshals Service is tracking 
down and arresting fugitives. In 2007, the service arrested more than 36,000 
fugitives. (A fugitive is a person who is wanted for a crime and who has a 
federal warrant out for his arrest.)
Because the Marshals Service generally goes after the most dangerous felons, 
being a deputy marshal is a very challenging job. The Marshals Service also 
protects federal judges, transports federal prisoners, and runs the government’s 
witness security program.
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is part of the U.S. Treasury Department 
and employs more than 2,800 special agents. Obviously, IRS special agents 
focus on tax cheaters. But other police agencies often seek out IRS agents to 
be partners in complex financial investigations, too. Most cops don’t enjoy 
digging through bank statements and tax records to find evidence of crime. 
Yet, some of the best evidence often comes from these financial documents, 
and IRS special agents are good at uncovering this valuable evidence.
Finding money that criminals have carefully hidden is important for one 
because doing so prevents criminals from benefitting from their crimes, 
but it’s also important because law enforcement can often seize proceeds 
through a process called forfeiture. For example, a drug dealer may use his 
illegally gained profits to buy a Cadillac Escalade. If police can prove that 
the vehicle was bought with drug proceeds or that the vehicle was used to 
transport drugs, they can seize the vehicle, sell it, and use the money to pay 
for law enforcement costs.
For this reason, good financial investigators, including IRS special agents, can 
be worth their weight in silver (if not gold).

243
 Chapter 17: Tackling Crime at the Federal Level
Other federal law enforcement agencies
As I mention in this chapter’s introduction, over 65 federal agencies employ 
law enforcement officers. Each agency has enforcement authority related 
to its own area of expertise. For example, the Bureau of Land Management 
(which is part of the U.S. Department of the Interior) and the U.S. Forest 
Service (which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture) employ special 
agents who provide law enforcement services on federal land. Other significant 
federal law enforcement agencies include the Border Patrol, the U.S. Postal 
Inspection Service, the U.S. Capitol Police, and the U.S. Park Service. The U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice have, 
by far, the most federal law enforcement jobs.
Many federal agencies include offices of inspector general, which are 
responsible for catching misconduct by employees within their agencies. 
These offices often employ special agents who have full law enforcement 
authority and who can arrest agency personnel and others involved in crime.
Job hunting at the federal level
In this chapter, I focus largely on the responsi­
bilities of special agents — are you interested 
in becoming one of these special agents? The 
minimum requirements for special agent posi­
tions differ widely, depending on the agency. 
For example, in most cases, the FBI requires 
a law degree or a four-year college degree 
in accounting, computer science, or electri­
cal engineering. Other agencies prefer to hire 
people who have prior police experience. 
Physical restrictions often influence hiring, as 
well. For example, the Secret Service doesn’t 
hire anyone older than 37 or anyone with 
eyesight worse than 20/60.
Most agencies require applicants to pass 
physical, written, and oral examinations, lie 
detector tests, drug-screening tests, and back­
ground investigations. After this initial screen­
ing process, accepted applicants normally 
must graduate from a basic training program. 
In the FBI, for example, each new special agent 
must go through a 17-week training course at 
the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia. Other 
agencies send their newbies to the Federal Law 
Enforcement Training Center, known as FLETC, 
in Glynco, Georgia.
If you’re not into becoming a special agent, 
you can consider lots of other positions in fed­
eral law enforcement. Agencies need forensic 
scientists, legal assistants, and intelligence 
analysts, for example. Intelligence analysts, 
who are growing in importance, assist police 
by taking large volumes of complex informa­
tion and making it understandable. They’re 
often central to organized crime investigations 
because they provide the outline and structure 
of the organization while also managing wiretap 
and phone call records.
If you’re interested in a career in federal law 
enforcement, visit the Web site of any agency 
that interests you to see the specific job duties 
and minimum requirements. A great place to 
look for actual job openings is the official job 
Web site of the U.S. government: http://

Part IV: Fighting Crime 
Coordinating Federal and Local Efforts
The feds make up just a fraction of the total law enforcement presence in the 
United States. So, for feds to be effective, they often must work closely with 
local and state police organizations.
Working with local law enforcement
As I explain earlier in this chapter, most federal law enforcement agencies 
tend to work on the more significant cases. For example, an FBI white-collar 
crime unit won’t even touch a case unless the amount of fraud is six — or 
more likely seven — figures.
Often, federal cases start as investigations by city or county detectives, who 
eventually realize that they’re into something big and that they’re going to 
need extra help. If local detectives have good relations with federal special 
agents in their areas, they may ask for federal help or even turn the case over 
to the feds. So, for practical reasons, good relationships between federal 
special agents and local law enforcers are crucial from both perspectives.
But the animosity between feds and locals that TV shows often depict has a 
basis in fact. This resentment can arise from several factors, including the 
following:
 
✓ Many federal law enforcement agencies move their employees around 
frequently. For example, a DEA special agent may live in four or five 
cities during her career. As a result, she can’t develop special ties or 
commitments to the community in which she lives at any given time. For 
many special agents, building friendships and relationships with other 
police may not be a priority.
 
✓ Local officers can easily develop some resentment against feds, who take 
on only the most significant cases. Even a good, self-effacing federal special 
agent has to work very hard to avoid ruffling feathers and appearing 
arrogant.
 
✓ Many local officers don’t perceive federal special agents as having much 
experience “working the street.” That is, many federal agents don’t start 
out as regular street cops, so they don’t deal face to face with all the 
difficult and crazy issues that can help build street smarts — the ability 
to work in the seamy world of crime and still effectively gather evidence. 
So when a fed takes over a significant local case, local officers may not 
believe she earned it.
 
✓ Cops, in general, are some of the most sensitive people I know — and I 
don’t mean that they cry during chick-flicks. Rather, they’re extremely 
quick to perceive slights, and they often respond in-kind. As a result, 
feds and locals sometimes have a hard time getting along.

245
 Chapter 17: Tackling Crime at the Federal Level
But to do their jobs effectively, feds need locals and locals need feds. 
Fortunately, the importance of the mission usually wins out over personal 
animosities.
Federal funding: Tapping federal 
resources to maximize effect
Local governments pay for the lion’s share of the nation’s law enforcement 
efforts (see Chapter 3 for more on the costs). But the federal government 
provides critical funding to extra law enforcement initiatives that can make a 
big difference.
For example, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), an agency 
run by the national drug czar (who reports directly to the president of the 
United States), heads up one of the government’s most effective federal 
funding programs. This program is known as the High Intensity Drug 
Trafficking Area program (HIDTA), and it provides funds to local and state 
agencies to attack major drug-trafficking organizations. What makes HIDTA so 
effective is that ONDCP turns over the money to an executive committee of 
local and federal law enforcement officials who, working together, decide how 
to spend the money — instead of letting some Washington, D.C., bureaucrat 
(or worse, a politician) decide what to do with it.
Numerous other federal grant programs help local and state law enforcement. 
Some significant ones include funding from the U.S. Department of Homeland 
Security to fight terrorism and Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) 
grants from the U.S. Department of Justice to fund community policing efforts 
(which I discuss in Chapter 16.) Other grants provide funding for bulletproof 
vests, overtime for intoxicated-driver-saturation patrols or drug investiga­
tions, gang interdiction programs, and just about any other worthy cause you 
can think of.
	
Most law enforcement initiatives beyond everyday police services depend, 
at least in part, on federal funding. As a result, most police chiefs and sheriffs 
know that they have to try their best to stay on good terms with their U.S. 
senators.

ou’ve probably seen a number of different portrayals of criminal in
vestigations on TV. Some seem realistic, but others just seem silly. Well, 
now it’s time to find out what really happens during police investigations.
In this chapter, I focus on what police do after a crime is committed: how they 
conduct an investigation and how they use special scientific techniques to 
collect and analyze evidence.
Responding to a Crime Scene
Police become involved in crime in at least three different ways:
 
✓ In response to calls for service, such as 9-1-1 calls
 
✓ Through police observation, such as when an officer on patrol sees a 
mugging going down
 
✓ During police investigations, in which detectives build cases involv­
ing ongoing crime, such as identifying the members of a street gang 
involved in the sale of narcotics
The majority of crimes that local police deal with are reported through 
9-1-1 calls — you can probably imagine the wide variety of calls that 9-1-1 
dispatchers receive. Here’s just a small sample of some common crimes that 
a patrol officer may be called to respond to:

248
Part IV: Fighting Crime 
 
✓ A traffic accident caused by a drunk driver
 
✓ A shoplifting incident at a grocery store
 
✓ A robbery at a local convenience store
 
✓ A domestic assault in an apartment complex
 
✓ A fight at a bar
 
✓ A burglary at someone’s home
 
✓ A purse stolen from a gym locker room
 
✓ A naked mentally ill man walking down the middle of a highway (an 
incident I had to deal with as a new prosecutor)
The truth is police officers never know what they’re going to face when they 
go to work. In this section, I describe the process police follow when they 
respond to a crime scene, from talking to witnesses to collecting evidence to 
writing reports.
Interviewing witnesses
Upon arriving at a crime scene (of domestic violence, for example), the first 
thing an officer has to do is check on the status of any victims to see whether 
they need medical attention. To ensure everyone’s safety, the officer has to 
separate all parties involved and make sure no other violence occurs. Then 
the officer needs to figure out what’s going on. The best way to do so is by 
talking to the witnesses.
Here are some things good interviewers do:
 
✓ Make sure that everyone who may have seen something sticks 
around. You definitely don’t want to have a key witness walk away 
without being interviewed.
 
✓ Write down the witnesses’ names and addresses. You may need to 
contact them later with more questions. Plus, you have to put this 
information in your police report so that the prosecutor can subpoena 
them as witnesses.
 
✓ Separate witnesses before you interview them. People are susceptible 
to suggestion. A witness may overhear what another witness says and 
subconsciously (or purposely) change her own statement.
	
	For example, a witness who actually only heard yelling from next door 
may start to believe that she saw the assault after listening to a few 
other witnesses give their accounts.
	
	I’ve seen witnesses who thought they saw something change their story 
later under cross-examination, so it’s important for officers to separate 
witnesses while conducting interviews.

249
 Chapter 18: Solving Crimes: The Process
 
✓ Don’t ask leading questions. A leading question strongly suggests the 
answer you’re looking for. You want to allow the witness to tell her story, 
not yours.
	
	For example, don’t ask, “You saw the large man hit the victim with his 
fist, didn’t you?” Instead, ask, “What did you see?”
	
	To be honest though, sometimes asking a leading question is the only 
way to get information.
Interviewing witnesses seems relatively simple, but it can be very challenging. 
For example, what if a witness doesn’t speak English? You may have to rely 
on someone present at the scene to translate for you, but you can’t be sure 
of the accuracy of the translation. Another challenge is determining whether 
the witness is telling the truth. Does the witness have some bias that leads 
him to lie to you? Officers must assess situations very quickly and then just 
do the best they can.
Interrogating suspects
Now this is the stuff of great drama — it’s no wonder why cop shows on TV 
frequently show suspect interrogations. On TV, interrogations usually occur 
in rooms with one-way mirrors while other cops watch. But in real life, 
interrogations are more likely to occur at crime scenes or in police cars.
Interrogation skills are extremely valuable to cops, and a good interviewer 
is valuable property in a detective unit. Although some people are better 
interviewers than others, most police officers spend a lot of time in training 
to learn interrogation skills. These skills are important for the following two 
reasons:
 
✓ A confession, which you often get in an interrogation, is just about the 
best evidence you can have.
 
✓ A suspect’s provable lie, which you also get from an interrogation, is 
the next best type of evidence (because a person who lies is hiding 
something — probably guilt).
	
Because confessions can be so valuable as evidence, governments throughout 
history have sought confessions aggressively — sometimes too aggressively. 
For example, the “rubber hose” treatment is the old practice of beating a 
suspect with a rubber hose until he confesses. The U.S. Constitution contains 
protections against such coercive government practices. For instance, it says 
that a confession must be voluntary — not extracted by torture or coercion — 
to be admissible.

250
Part IV: Fighting Crime 
Gathering physical evidence
Although statements from witnesses and suspects can be great evidence, 
physical evidence can also make a case. I talk about some specific types of 
physical evidence in the “Using Special Crime-Fighting Tools and Techniques” 
section, but here I want to focus on how police go about gathering evidence.
For serious offenses, it’s often important to photograph the entire crime 
scene. Police officers should try not to move anything until they’ve taken 
these preliminary photos. (I talk specifically about crime scene investigations in 
the next section.) While searching for evidence, if an officer finds something, 
she places it into a special evidence bag in a way that preserves any trace 
evidence, such as blood or fingerprints, that exists on it (see the “Looking for 
fingerprints” section later in this chapter for more details). The officer who 
seizes each piece of evidence marks the bag she puts it in and then seals it. 
The officer then stores the bag of evidence in a secured room, known as an 
evidence room, at the police department. Every police department has an 
evidence room where police store physical evidence while waiting for trial.
If the evidence needs to be checked for fingerprints, the keeper of the evidence 
room, sometimes known as the evidence technician, checks out the bag (and 
makes a note of this action in an evidence log). She then sends it to the crime 
Miranda rights
Today when a suspect is in custody (which 
means the person reasonably doesn’t feel free 
to leave the scene), if the police don’t read the 
suspect certain rights (called Miranda rights), 
the suspect’s statements aren’t admissible 
in court. The U.S. Supreme Court came up 
with these rights in the 1966 case Miranda v. 
Arizona. If you watch TV at all, you probably 
already know these rights. The exact language 
can vary somewhat, but here are the basics:
 ✓ You have the right to remain silent.
 ✓ Anything you say can and will be used 
against you in a court of law.
 ✓ You have the right to speak with an attorney 
and to have that attorney with you during 
questioning.
 ✓ If you can’t afford an attorney, the court will 
appoint one for you.
If a suspect says he understands his rights and 
still chooses to make a statement, the court 
presumes that statement is voluntary, and, 
thus, deems it admissible at trial. Some states 
require that a suspect in custody be Mirandized 
(meaning have his Miranda rights read to him) 
and that his statement be recorded for it to be 
admissible in court.
You may be wondering why anyone would ever 
agree to talk to the police. Well, imagine that 
you were wrongly arrested. You’d try to per­
suade the officer of her mistake, wouldn’t you? 
Similarly, guilty people often try to fool officers 
by trying to act innocent. In other words, they 
try to talk their way out of the situation.

251
 Chapter 18: Solving Crimes: The Process
lab. When the crime lab scientist breaks the seal on the bag, he makes a 
notation on the bag that he did so. After he tests the evidence, he places it 
back in the bag, seals it up, and sends it back to the evidence technician.
On the day of trial, the officer who originally seized the evidence comes to 
the evidence room and retrieves the bag. She takes the bag to court and gives 
it to the prosecutor.
	
Why do officers have to follow this process so carefully? Some evidence 
requires proof of a chain of custody, or proof that the evidence was in police 
custody the entire time from the moment police took it from the crime scene 
to the moment it appears in court as evidence.
For example, if a prosecutor who’s trying a murder case wants to offer into 
evidence fingerprints found on a knife that police retrieved from the murder 
scene, he first has to prove that
 
✓ The knife that was tested in the crime lab for fingerprints was the same 
one that was found next to the murder victim.
 
✓ The knife wasn’t touched by anyone from the time it was found until the 
time it was tested by the scientist in the crime lab.
To prove this chain of custody, the prosecutor has to call as witnesses the 
officer who seized the knife and the scientist who tested the knife.
Unlike the knife in the preceding example, some evidence doesn’t require a 
chain of custody. For example, if an officer takes a photo of an assault victim’s 
face, the prosecutor doesn’t need to prove that the photo was kept secure in 
an evidence locker. The officer who took the photo just needs to testify that 
the photo “fairly and accurately” depicts the scene she photographed. In fact, 
the officer doesn’t even have to testify if the victim can testify that the photo 
is accurate.
Writing a report
	
Every piece of information a police officer uncovers about an incident must be 
conveyed to the prosecutor, who ultimately decides whether criminal charges 
should be filed. (I discuss the prosecutor’s role in more detail in Chapter 19.) 
The officer conveys that information by writing a police report.
Every police department has a standard form that allows the officer to input 
the following pieces of information:
 
✓ The type of crime under investigation
 
✓ The names and addresses of witnesses

252
Part IV: Fighting Crime 
 
✓ Witness statements and officer observations
 
✓ Suspect information, including descriptions of identifiers like height, 
weight, hair color, and tattoos
In addition, reports have spaces for recording other statistical information 
about the crime, such as
 
✓ Whether the crime was gang related
 
✓ Whether it was a hate crime (motivated by racial bias, for example)
 
✓ Whether a weapon was used
 
✓ Whether the suspect was under the influence of an intoxicant
 
✓ How much loss, if any, occurred
Writing a good report is a crucial skill that can have a big impact on whether 
prosecutors make good decisions about charging suspects. Reports that 
leave out crucial information, are confusing, or are poorly written can lead to 
problems or mistakes in the criminal justice system.
Officers write their police reports at the police station after they’ve arrested 
the suspects or issued citations. (Increasingly, officers don’t arrest suspects 
but, instead, issue them citations — like traffic tickets — to appear in court 
at a later date.) While the officer is actually at the crime scene, she may use a 
tape recorder or (more likely) a notebook to record observations and witness 
statements. If the officer concludes that no crime was committed and doesn’t 
arrest anyone or issue any citations, she probably won’t write a report. But 
she will hang on to her notes in case they become important and perhaps 
document her actions in a department activity log.
When an officer is conducting an ongoing investigation, she probably doesn’t 
write her report until after she develops enough evidence to make an arrest.
Using Special Crime-Fighting 
Tools and Techniques
Once upon a time — not that long ago, actually — fingerprints were considered 
cutting-edge technology. (I must confess that I’ve never found fingerprints 
to be that helpful. In my entire career, I’ve used fingerprint evidence only 
a couple of times.) But as science continues to march on, a slew of crime-
fighting techniques have become available. These techniques can solve 
thousands of crimes. Unfortunately though, they don’t always do so because 
police often don’t have enough resources to take advantage of them. The 
truth is crime labs across the country are often dramatically underfunded.

253
 Chapter 18: Solving Crimes: The Process
In this section, I explain a variety of crime-fighting techniques, from low-tech 
to high-tech, including good ole fingerprints.
The CSI effect
Is it possible to flick through your TV chan­
nels without seeing a show about crime scene 
investigations? If you haven’t seen the original 
CSI, you may have seen CSI: Miami, CSI: New 
York, or a variety of other similar shows. But 
how accurate are these shows? And has their 
popularity had any impact on what happens in 
real-life courtrooms?
The answer to the first question is that these 
shows are highly inaccurate, just like most 
other TV dramas. Here’s how:
 ✓ Murders aren’t solved in an hour, and 
sometimes they aren’t solved at all.
 ✓ Crime scene investigators don’t interview 
suspects.
 ✓ Often, crime scene investigators are trained 
scientists, not police officers.
 ✓ Crime scene investigators don’t shoot 
bad guys.
 ✓ DNA testing takes weeks or months, not 15 
minutes, to process.
 ✓ Fingerprint evidence rarely is helpful.
 ✓ Forensic scientists rarely have model-like 
good looks.
 ✓ Crime labs are often dramatically under­
funded, so most of the techniques you see on 
TV are used only in the most serious cases.
The answer to the second question is yes — 
these TV shows have impacted real-life court­
rooms, and they’ve done so by raising jurors’ 
expectations about forensic evidence. In 2006, 
the Yale Law Review reported that a poll of 
prosecutors in Phoenix revealed that 38 percent 
of prosecutors failed to convict in at least one 
case because jurors had unreasonably high 
expectations for scientific evidence.
For example, one Phoenix prosecutor referred 
to a case in which a cop saw a drug dealer 
throw away a baggie of drugs. After the trial, 
jurors told the prosecutor that they were 
concerned that the baggie wasn’t fingerprinted, 
even though the officer saw the defendant 
throw it away. In other words, fingerprint evi­
dence wasn’t necessary in this case. The jury 
didn’t know that there was a six-month back­
log in the crime lab for checking for fingerprint 
evidence. (And if every baggie of dope was 
tested, the backlog would probably be six 
years.)
Today, because of CSI and shows like it, jurors 
expect forensic evidence, such as DNA, 
fingerprints, and microfiber analysis, for all 
crimes, even minor ones. When they don’t get 
it, they question the thoroughness of police and 
prosecutors.

254
Part IV: Fighting Crime 
Conducting crime scene investigations
Whether or not investigators carefully scrutinize a crime scene for evidence 
depends on the seriousness of the crime. In fact, some crime scenes aren’t 
examined at all. For example, in many jurisdictions, police don’t even 
respond to burglary scenes because they don’t have enough officers or 
forensic scientists. In such cases, an officer just takes the report over the 
phone. In reality, police agencies reserve crime scene investigations for the 
most serious of crimes.
Crime scenes can contain all kinds of evidence. Some of it is obvious, such 
as a murder weapon or a kilo of cocaine. But even a kilo of cocaine must be 
tested by a scientist in a crime lab to prove that, in fact, it is cocaine and not 
some harmless substance like sugar. Evidence that’s obtained specifically for 
court is called forensic evidence. So the cocaine itself isn’t forensic evidence, 
but the test results that prove it’s cocaine are. If you’re fascinated by forensic 
science, check out Forensics For Dummies by Douglas Lyle (Wiley).
So how does an officer treat a crime scene to secure the best forensic 
evidence? The first officers to arrive at a crime scene search the location 
to make sure no bad guys are lurking in the bushes and to verify that any 
injured victims are being cared for. After securing the scene, the next step is 
to lock it down so that no one can alter any evidence, hence the yellow tape 
you see encircling crime scenes.
Unless a jurisdiction has a very small police force, detectives are called to 
the scene, and one detective is put in charge of the investigation. Here’s what 
happens in the initial stages of an investigation:
 
✓ An officer or a crime scene investigator photographs the scene. The 
photographic evidence is crucial for both the prosecution and the 
defense because it allows everyone to see the crime scene, even after it 
has been cleaned up.
 
✓ Someone is put in charge of logging in the evidence (called the evidence 
custodian). Cops who find evidence photograph it where they find it 
and then bring it to the evidence custodian, who records the item and 
secures it for storage in the evidence locker. Much of this evidence 
doesn’t need to be analyzed by forensic scientists. (For example, I had a 
case where old grocery receipts in a garbage can showed the purchase 
date of duct tape used in a murder. I didn’t need a forensic scientist to 
tell me this info.)
	
	Initially, it’s very hard to know what evidence is relevant to the case. The 
basic rule is: When in doubt, bag it and tag it.

255
 Chapter 18: Solving Crimes: The Process
 
✓ Forensic scientists or investigators are called to the scene to look for 
scientific evidence. At a murder scene, for example, they want to try to 
determine the cause of death, how it was done, and, ultimately, who did 
it. Here are just a few examples of what a forensic scientist may look for:
 
• Angles of bullets: The angle of a bullet entering a wall can reveal 
the trajectory of the shot and, thus, the location where the shooter 
was standing.
 
• Blood patterns: The pattern of blood spatter can reveal where the 
victim was standing when struck, whether the blood came from a 
hard blow, and even whether the victim was alive during that blow. 
(Check out the “Studying blood stain patterns” section for more 
details.)
 
• Duct tape: Duct tape placed over a victim’s mouth can be matched 
up with the end of the roll of duct tape found in the suspect’s truck 
to see whether there’s a match. (This is done through microfiber 
analysis.)
 
• Shell casings: The location and number of shell casings can reveal 
where the shooter was standing, how many shots were fired, and 
perhaps whether the shooter was acting in self-defense. Testing 
the shell casings can help identify the murder weapon, too.
Applying for search warrants
Except in rare emergencies, police cannot just come into your house and 
search it. The U.S. Constitution requires police to have probable cause 
(meaning that it’s more likely than not that they will find evidence of a 
crime) before they can search your home. They also have to obtain a judge’s 
approval for a search warrant. Sometimes this means waking up a judge in 
the middle of the night so that he can sign a search warrant. Of course, a 
person can consent to a search of his or her house, which means a warrant 
isn’t needed.
Police can obtain a warrant to search a house, car, or any private property. 
Such searches are often treated like crime scenes, with an assigned evidence 
custodian and other officers assigned to conduct the search. However, for 
most search warrants, forensic scientists aren’t called to the location.
	
The scope of an officer’s search of someone’s private property is limited by 
what the officer is looking for. In other words, police can search only for 
evidence of the crime they’re investigating. For example, if an officer is looking 
for evidence of a stolen car, he can certainly look in the suspect’s garage, but 
he probably can’t look in a drawer in the suspect’s clothes dresser.

256
Part IV: Fighting Crime 
The most common type of search warrant permits officers to look for evidence 
of drug crimes. Drug units regularly obtain warrants to search houses for 
drugs, cash, packaging materials, or records of drug activity. Needless to say, 
executing such search warrants can be very dangerous. Police never know 
what’s waiting for them when they break into a criminal’s house.
To listen to suspects’ conversations (called a wiretap), police have to obtain 
a special type of search warrant order from a judge. Because of the significant 
privacy intrusion involved, a wiretap order is much tougher to get approval for 
than a regular search warrant. I discuss wiretaps in more detail in Chapter 8.
Analyzing computers, cellphones, 
and other electronic evidence
Today evidence is commonly found on high-tech devices. Anything that 
can store electronic data may contain evidence of a crime. In most 
circumstances, however, police need a warrant to search items such as 
computers, cellphones, and flash drives.
Even after a cop has a warrant, however, he doesn’t just open a computer 
with a screwdriver and look for evidence (although I do know officers who 
have found drugs hidden inside computer consoles). And a cop can’t just 
turn on a computer and start looking around at files. Everything he does 
alters the data. For example, when he opens a document, the computer 
records the specific time he opened it, so a jury can’t know when that 
document was previously opened. (The jury may also question whether the 
document was altered.) If police searched computer evidence in this way, it 
likely wouldn’t be admissible in court.
Therefore, it takes a specially trained forensic computer expert to retrieve 
electronic evidence. Typically, after the officer seizes the computer, the 
expert makes an exact copy of the hard drive. Then, using special software, 
she searches the copy without altering any of the original data.
Because cellphones are so common, and because everyone seems to be 
text messaging and taking photographs through cellphones, they can be 
treasure troves of evidence. But searching a cellphone is a challenging task. 
Each phone requires different search technology, and phone companies keep 
changing the designs. As a result, very few police experts can keep up on 
cellphone technology, so most small police departments have trouble taking 
advantage of this type of evidence.

 Chapter 18: Solving Crimes: The Process
Administering lie detector tests
Also known as a polygraph, a lie detector is a machine that measures certain 
biological responses in a person while she’s being asked a series of questions. 
The machine measures the following:
 
✓ Heart rate
 
✓ Body temperature
 
✓ Blood pressure
 
✓ Skin conductivity
 
✓ Breathing rate
While connected to the machine, a subject has to answer a series of questions. 
The subject receives the questions in advance so she isn’t surprised. Some 
of the questions are controls, meaning that they aren’t the focus of the 
interrogation. A control question may be, “Is your name Barack Obama?” The 
officer conducting the test then compares the physiological responses during 
the control questions to the physiological responses during the important 
questions. If the subject’s heart rate, body temperature, and other responses 
change during the important questions, the officer may conclude that the 
person is being deceptive.
	
Results from lie detector tests aren’t admissible in court because there’s great 
debate about their reliability — not to mention you can find numerous Web 
sites that claim to teach you how to defeat a lie detector test.
Defense attorneys sometimes use polygraph tests to try to persuade 
prosecutors that their clients are innocent. But their most important use in 
law enforcement is as an interrogation technique. A person under suspicion 
of a crime may be asked to take a polygraph test (he can’t be forced to). A 
guilty person may do so because he wants to appear innocent. An innocent 
person may do so because he wants to be cleared. The test is an opportunity 
for the polygraph examiner to ask pointed questions about the crime and to 
use the test results to try to persuade the subject to “come clean.” This is 
important because, although the test results aren’t admissible in court, the 
statements of the subject taking the test can be admissible.
Ultimately, the test relies on the skill and experience of the polygraph 
examiner to interpret the meaning of changes in a person’s physiological 
reactions. Thus, interpreting results is a subjective process, which may be 
another reason why polygraph results aren’t admissible in court.

Part IV: Fighting Crime 
Looking for fingerprints
Look closely at the tips of your fingers. You see friction ridges, which help you 
hold on to things. The pattern of ridges is unique to you and makes up your 
fingerprint. If you pick up a glass right now, sweat and oil on your fingertips 
may leave a latent fingerprint on the glass. Fingerprints can be left behind at 
crime scenes or on evidence, and they can be powerful proof that a particular 
suspect touched a particular item.
Most fingerprints aren’t visible to the human eye (hence the word latent), so 
police use various methods to locate prints. For example, at a crime scene, 
police may apply a special powder to various surfaces, which helps make 
prints visible. Or they may take an item from a scene back to the crime lab 
and use more sophisticated techniques to locate prints. One highly regarded 
technique is known as vacuum metal deposition, in which fine layers of gold 
and zinc are applied to the item; the metal attaches to minute fat molecules 
left in prints.
If a print is identified on an item of evidence, the scientist must have another 
print to compare it to. So, if police have a suspect, they take fingerprints from 
him and compare his prints to the ones from the crime scene.
Fortunately, there’s also a nationwide electronic system that contains 
fingerprints of just about everyone who has ever been arrested. The system 
contains more than 47 million prints. This system, run by the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), is called the Integrated Automated Fingerprint 
Identification System, or IAFIS for short.
When a person is arrested, his prints are taken and entered into IAFIS. Then, 
using computers, police can check prints from a crime scene against prints 
in the database. If a potential match is found, a trained fingerprint examiner 
does a comparison, looking for identical features in each set of prints.
	
Of course, using fingerprints as evidence does pose a few problems. For 
instance:
 
✓ Finding a perfect print is rare. For example, when you pick up a glass, 
your fingers rub against that glass. Instead of leaving a perfect print, 
you may leave a smudge or just a partial print, which is much harder to 
match than a full print.
 
✓ Most surfaces aren’t perfectly smooth like glass, so they may not retain 
identifiable fingerprints.
 
✓ The comparison print may be less than perfect. After all, when someone 
is arrested, a local jail official likely takes his prints by applying ink to 
the arrestee’s hands and rubbing those hands on a fingerprint card. 
Imperfect prints are common.

259
 Chapter 18: Solving Crimes: The Process
The bottom line is that retrieving good prints from an item of evidence and 
then comparing those prints with a faulty comparator can be a challenging 
science.
As I discuss next, advances in DNA analysis may make fingerprint evidence 
less and less important.
Testing DNA
DNA testing has become the mother of all forensic evidence. Expectations of 
DNA testing have progressed quickly: In the late 1990s, defendants regularly 
challenged its accuracy, but jurors today expect DNA to solve almost every 
crime.
DNA is short for deoxyribonucleic acid. It contains the genetic instructions 
for the development of every living thing — including you — and is present 
in almost every cell in your body. Its importance in criminal forensics comes 
from the fact that no two people have the same DNA (except identical twins, 
which could make for an interesting soap opera storyline). So if a criminal 
leaves behind some organic matter at a crime scene, DNA evidence can play a 
role in solving the crime.
Here are some of the most common sources of DNA evidence:
 
✓ Blood
 
✓ Semen
 
✓ Saliva
 
✓ Skin
 
✓ Teeth
 
✓ Hair
 
✓ Urine
 
✓ Perspiration
 
✓ Fingernails
Note that DNA evidence isn’t always visible. For example, the handle of a 
baseball bat used in an assault may contain invisible perspiration. Cigarette 
butts may have saliva. Bed sheets may contain dried semen stains. A murder 
victim’s fingernails may contain skin cells from the murderer.
	
Your DNA and mine are 99.9 percent identical. However, certain known regions 
of the DNA string do vary from individual to individual, and these sections are 
the ones forensic scientists compare.

260
Part IV: Fighting Crime 
Using DNA as evidence
	
Police, victim advocates, and medical professionals have systematized a lot 
of DNA evidence gathering. For example, a rape victim is usually asked to 
undergo a medical examination to look for evidence of blood, semen, or pubic 
hair, which may help capture the rapist. After police and medical professionals 
have collected items that may contain DNA, they store them in certain types 
of containers to preserve the evidence for later testing. In fact, following strict 
protocols and maintaining a chain of custody are crucial to accurate DNA 
testing. If the evidence becomes contaminated in any way, it loses all value. 
(Check out the “Gathering physical evidence” section for more on gathering 
evidence and maintaining a chain of custody.)
How is DNA used as evidence? Obviously, it can identify a suspect, as in a 
rape case. But DNA evidence can also place a suspect in a location where he 
claims not to have been. It can establish that a suspect held a weapon, and 
it can help police eliminate potential suspects. DNA has even been used in 
some cases to obtain the release of persons wrongly convicted.
DNA evidence is collected mostly in “person” crimes, such as serious 
assaults, rapes, and murders. Most policymakers consider the costs too 
high to do DNA analysis for common property crimes, such as burglary. 
However, a 2008 study by the National Institute for Justice found that 
gathering and using DNA evidence in property crimes doubled the arrest 
and conviction rates and helped identify the most serious of property 
offenders. Significantly, the study found that DNA evidence was twice as 
effective as fingerprint evidence in identifying suspects.
But DNA evidence isn’t a cure-all. Even when police find DNA evidence and 
follow proper procedures for collecting it, they can still encounter challenges. 
For example, DNA samples can be mixed, meaning that DNA from at least 
two different people is found together. This situation is common during 
investigations of violent encounters, as you can imagine. After all, blood, 
saliva, and other body tissues can easily be intermingled. As another example, 
a hotel bedspread can contain DNA from a number of different people. 
(Trust me, you don’t want me to elaborate on this point.)
DNA evidence can survive for 20 years or more. Many states are contemplating 
laws that require police to keep DNA evidence even after a suspect has been 
convicted. The argument is that as science progresses, that evidence may 
later help exonerate persons wrongly convicted. The long-term storage of 
biological evidence is certainly a headache for police agencies, however. It 
not only takes up space, but bloody evidence may contain diseases, such as 
hepatitis, which pose serious health risks for everybody concerned.

261
 Chapter 18: Solving Crimes: The Process
Compiling DNA samples
As with fingerprints, a forensic scientist working with DNA evidence must 
have a sample (an exemplar, as people in the know call it) with which to 
compare the DNA evidence from a crime scene. Obviously, if police have a 
suspect, they can require the person to give them a sample. You may recall 
federal officials taking a saliva swab from former President Bill Clinton to do a 
comparison with the stain found on Monica Lewinsky’s infamous blue dress. 
But what happens when police don’t have a suspect?
Most states maintain databases containing the DNA of convicted criminals. 
Individual states have laws that determine whose DNA profile must be stored 
in those databases — people convicted of certain crimes, for example, or 
even people who are just arrested but not yet convicted. After police take — 
and scientists analyze — the biological sample from the convict or suspect, 
they put that person’s DNA profile in their state’s database. The state data­
bases are all connected nationally by an FBI system known as the National 
DNA Index System, or NDIS. Similarly, if DNA evidence is retrieved from an 
unsolved crime, that unidentified DNA profile may also be stored in the state 
database.
	
Once a week, a program known as the Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS 
for short, compares DNA profiles from unsolved crimes against the DNA 
profiles from convicted offenders. If there’s a match, called a hit, the FBI 
notifies the state crime lab that submitted the DNA profile.
As of 2009, CODIS contained the DNA profiles of more than 6.7 million 
criminal offenders and more than 250,000 DNA samples from unsolved 
crimes. Since the program started in 1990, it has produced more than 85,000 
hits. That’s a lot of serious crimes solved.
But CODIS isn’t problem free. DNA profiles take a lot of time to process, and 
most state and local crime labs don’t have enough scientists to analyze all 
the biological samples and submit the DNA profiles into the database. As a 
result, many states have giant backlogs of biological evidence from convicted 
offenders and from unsolved crimes that haven’t even been analyzed yet. 
In fact, a 2003 study found that 169,000 biological samples from rapes and 
52,000 samples from homicides hadn’t been processed or entered into the 
database.
	
If you want more information about DNA testing and evidence, the federal 
government maintains a great Web site at www.dna.gov.

Part IV: Fighting Crime 
Comparing handwriting
In criminal cases involving handwriting, such as forged checks or even phony 
suicide notes, police may ask an expert in handwriting comparison to look 
at the evidence. As with fingerprints and DNA, the examiner must have the 
evidentiary writing, known as the questioned document, and something to 
compare it with. Often police require a suspect to give a handwriting sample, 
known as a handwriting exemplar.
Also, like fingerprints and DNA evidence, the science of handwriting 
comparison has many challenges. Here are just a few:
 
✓ An intentional simulation can be hard to identify.
 
✓ Suspects asked to give handwriting exemplars may purposefully alter 
their style of writing to make the comparison more difficult.
 
✓ Drugs, alcohol, or even caffeine can alter how a person writes in a given 
circumstance.
Most importantly, however, handwriting examination is ultimately subjective. 
It depends on the experience and skill of the examiner, and these obviously 
vary from examiner to examiner. At least in my little world, requests for 
handwriting comparisons have always ended with the following words: 
“results inconclusive.”
Studying blood stain patterns
Blood stain patterns can provide valuable evidence. Whole books are written 
on this topic, but, basically, you can tell an awful lot from a blood stain.
Blood stain experts essentially define three types of blood stains:
 
✓ Contact transfers: When a bloody knife transfers blood onto a surface, 
such as a kitchen counter, for example
 
✓ Passive blood stains: When blood drips or pools on a surface
 
✓ Projected stains or blood spatter: When blood is flung or sprayed onto 
a surface
Blood spatter is further broken down into low-, medium-, and high-velocity 
blood spatter. These terms refer to the speed of the item that caused the 
injury, not the speed at which the blood flew from the body. For example, 
something traveling at greater than 100 feet per second (like a bullet) causes 
high-velocity blood spatter, characterized by tiny droplets of blood. Low-
velocity spatter results in larger droplets.

263
 Chapter 18: Solving Crimes: The Process
A good blood stain expert can tell you a lot about a bloody crime scene, 
including the following information:
 
✓ What type of impact caused the blood to flow
 
✓ Where the victim was when the blood flowed
 
✓ Where the suspect may have gone after committing the crime (based on 
drops of blood from a knife, for example)
Consider the low-velocity stain in Figure 18-1. This illustration reveals a 
castoff stain from a knife, moving from left to right in a curve. You can tell 
the direction by the elongated shape of the drops as you move farther to the 
right.
	
Figure 18-1: 
The castoff 
stain from a 
knife.
	
Next, look at Figure 18-2, which shows a drip stain. Notice how the stain 
is round with scalloping all around the edge, indicating that it fell straight 
down.

Collecting cell tower evidence
Records of cellphone signals can be very valuable in placing a suspect in 
the vicinity of a crime scene. For instance, when you make a call with your 
cellphone, that phone generally sends a signal to the closest cell tower. For 
billing purposes, your cellphone company keeps records of which towers 
received which signals. (Of course, they want to be able to hit you with 
roaming charges whenever they can.) Police or prosecutors can obtain cell 
tower information through a subpoena or a court order and then use that 
information to prove that a suspect was near a particular location at a 
particular time.
I once prosecuted a man for child molestation. He claimed to have been in 
Florida, but records of his cellphone calls placed him in the Northwest during 
the week of the crimes. Of course, I still had to prove that he was the person 
making the calls.
Reconstructing an accident
One of the most valuable forms of forensic analysis involves the reconstruction 
of automobile accidents. Accident reconstruction is an extremely complex 
area, but basically, it involves examining all the evidence from a car crash 
to determine what happened. When a death occurs, for example, accident 
reconstruction allows law enforcement officials to determine whether 
someone should be charged with murder, manslaughter, or negligent homicide.
Here are just a few examples of how reconstruction experts can piece 
together what happened:
 
✓ Tire skid marks can show when brakes were applied, how fast a car was 
going, and whether the car was turning at the time of the accident.
 
✓ The location of a shoulder harness injury can show who was driving.
 
✓ Headlight examination can reveal whether the lights were on or not.
 
✓ The amount and type of vehicle damage can explain what happened to 
the car.
 
✓ Evidence of food in the car or a cellphone that’s turned on can show that 
a driver may have been distracted.
The main drawbacks of accident reconstruction work is that it’s time-
consuming and expensive. Although it’s often used in civil suits involving 
car crashes, in the criminal arena, it’s usually reserved for traffic fatalities.

U

nderstanding the U.S. justice system requires understanding the duties 
and responsibilities of the key players in that system. In this chapter, I 
discuss the roles of prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges.
Prosecutors: Guardians of Safety
Prosecutors are government attorneys who seek to convict criminals. (I’m 
always surprised by how many people don’t know that.) Like all attorneys, 
prosecutors must graduate from a law school and pass a state bar exam. A 
bar exam is a test that each state administers to ensure that every attorney 
knows enough to practice law competently.
The vast majority of prosecutors in the United States work at the local level. 
Prosecutors are usually organized in the following way: A local office has 
one prosecutor in charge, who is elected by the citizens or appointed by a 
politician such as a governor. That person may be known as the district 
attorney or the county prosecutor. Depending on the population of the 
jurisdiction, the district attorney may have any number of prosecutors 
working for her. For example, in 2009, Los Angeles County District Attorney 
Steve Cooley had 1,017 deputy district attorneys working for him. In contrast, 
the county prosecutor for Barry County in Missouri, Johnnie Cox, had just 
one assistant prosecutor.

268
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
As of this writing, 2,344 local prosecutor offices in the United States employ 
roughly 25,000 assistant prosecutors. Confusingly, although these offices are 
usually organized by county, they’re considered to be part of their state 
criminal justice systems because they enforce state laws passed by their 
state legislatures.
At the federal level, U.S. attorneys — appointed by the president of the 
United States — play the role that the district attorneys play at the local 
level. At the time of this writing, there are 93 U.S. attorneys, and each one has 
an office with assistant U.S. attorneys who prosecute federal crimes. Many 
towns also have small municipal courts that handle low-level violations and 
crimes. City attorneys may prosecute these offenses. (See Chapter 20 for 
more information about municipal courts and the differences between the 
federal court system and the state court system.)
Charging crimes
	
So what do prosecutors do? One of their most important responsibilities is 
deciding whom to charge with a crime, and what crimes to charge. When 
you think about this responsibility, you realize just how serious it is. In all of 
U.S. society, only the prosecutor has the authority to start the process that 
ultimately can take away a person’s liberty. Such authority can’t be exercised 
lightly.
Typically, police make an arrest, write a report that explains the crimes 
committed and the evidence of those crimes, and then forward that report 
to the local prosecutor’s office. The prosecutor reads the report and decides 
whether or not to file charges.
	
A police officer needs only probable cause to make an arrest. (Probable cause 
means that it’s more likely than not that the person committed the crime.) But 
ultimately, a prosecutor has to prove that the person committed the crime by 
a much higher standard — beyond a reasonable doubt. (Check out Chapter 20 
for the common legal definition of this standard.) So although the officer may 
have been justified in making the arrest, the prosecutor can conclude that 
the evidence isn’t strong enough to obtain a conviction. In that case, the 
prosecutor declines to file charges.
Sometimes the prosecutor sends a note to the arresting officer asking for 
more investigation. For example, as a prosecutor, I may decline to file charges 
on an assault because I need evidence of an injury to prove the case, and the 
officer’s report may not have said anything about an injury. I may choose 
to send a note to the officer offering to reconsider the charging decision if 
he can bring me a photograph of an injury or a statement from the victim 
explaining the injury.

269
 Chapter 19: Seeking Justice: The Players and Their Roles
When prosecutors do decide to file charges, they can do so in three ways:
 
✓ For misdemeanors (low-level offenses punishable by no more than a 
year in jail), the prosecutor usually drafts an information (a charging 
document that describes the alleged crime) and files it with the court. 
The defendant eventually receives this document so that he can see the 
crimes being charged against him.
 
✓ In most states, for felonies (serious offenses punishable by more than a 
year in prison), the prosecutor presents evidence to a grand jury that 
decides whether there’s enough evidence to file charges. (The grand 
jury can also be used for misdemeanor crimes, but it rarely is.)
	
	What’s a grand jury? It’s a group of citizens who receive a summons from 
the local court just like regular jurors. But unlike regular jurors, they 
don’t decide guilt. Rather, in a secret proceeding, prosecutors bring 
evidence before the grand jury, which then decides whether or not to 
file criminal charges. The only people allowed in such a proceeding are 
the grand jurors, the prosecutor, and the witnesses relevant to the case. 
There’s no judge present. If the grand jury decides that there’s enough 
evidence to file charges, it does so through an indictment. An indictment 
is pretty much the same thing as an information — a charging document 
that describes the alleged crime — except that the citizens of the grand 
jury (not the prosecutor) issue it.
	
	Why does the U.S. justice system have grand juries? Few other countries 
do. In the United States, the grand jury system is considered a check on 
prosecutorial discretion. The idea is that citizens won’t allow prosecutors 
to abuse their authority and wrongfully indict people. But a well-known 
joke among defense attorneys says that a grand jury would indict a ham 
sandwich if the prosecutor asked it to. The joke reflects the fact that the 
prosecutor has a lot of influence over the members of the grand jury 
because the proceedings occur in secret. No attorney is present to argue 
on behalf of the defendant.
 
✓ Some jurisdictions don’t use grand juries. Instead, prosecutors draft 
an information for felonies like they do for misdemeanors. Then, at a 
preliminary hearing, a judge determines whether there’s enough evidence 
to continue the case. This hearing is different from a grand jury because 
a judge, the defendant, and his attorney are present, and the defense 
attorney gets to cross-examine witnesses. In the preliminary hearing, 
the judge fulfills the same function as the grand jury, making sure the 
prosecution has sufficient evidence to go forward with the case.
	
	Still other jurisdictions let prosecutors choose whether they use a grand 
jury or a preliminary hearing.
In Chapter 20, I outline the course of a criminal trial from plea negotiations, 
to motions to suppress, right up to the trial.

270
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
Helping with investigations
In addition to making charging decisions on standard criminal cases, more 
senior prosecutors may be directly involved with cops in ongoing investigations.
For example, most homicide investigations heavily involve a prosecutor 
because, ultimately, the prosecutor has to prove the case. Thus, the 
prosecutor helps make decisions like the following:
 
✓ Do the police have probable cause to obtain a search warrant?
 
✓ Are witness statements admissible or should the witness be reinterviewed?
 
✓ Is it worth the cost to send a detective to another state to interview a 
witness?
In addition to serious violent crimes, prosecutors are often directly involved 
in ongoing organized crime investigations with drug and gang task forces. In 
these investigations, the prosecutors help choose targets for the investigation, 
approve search warrants before they’re given to the judge, and decide when 
to make an arrest after enough evidence has been found to convict the suspect.
Generally, however, handling the constant flow of new cases is too much work 
to allow most prosecutors to be seriously involved in ongoing investigations. 
So, usually, cops are left to investigate by themselves. Turn to Chapter 18 for 
a discussion about police investigations.
Weighing ethical responsibilities
Prosecutors don’t represent individual clients. They don’t even represent the 
victims in their cases, although they may be very sympathetic and helpful to 
victims. Prosecutors represent the government. This statement sounds kind 
of cold to a jury, so as a prosecutor, I liked to say, “I represent the people.” 
(The United States is a democracy after all.)
Among all lawyers, prosecutors have a unique obligation to do the right 
thing. Most attorneys have an ethical obligation to zealously represent their 
clients’ interests, even when doing so means helping a guilty person achieve 
an acquittal. But in representing the people of the United States, prosecutors 
are bound by ethical rules to seek justice, not just convictions. Practicing 
according to this ethical code means that
 
✓ Prosecutors can’t hide evidence.
 
✓ If prosecutors come to believe a defendant is innocent, they must 
dismiss the case.
 
✓ Judges hold prosecutors to a much higher standard than they do other 
lawyers.

271
 Chapter 19: Seeking Justice: The Players and Their Roles
And this is the way it should be.
Fulfilling additional duties
Although the trial process takes up most of a prosecutor’s time, a prosecutor’s 
office usually has a number of other responsibilities, as well. Here are some 
of the more common ones in no particular order (keep in mind that not all 
prosecutors’ offices have all these duties):
 
✓ Representing the state in delinquency proceedings against juveniles who 
engage in criminal conduct. (In Chapter 22, I discuss juvenile cases in detail.)
 
✓ Representing children’s interests in family court. For example, this duty 
may include proceedings to terminate parental rights when parents 
appear to be unfit to carry out their parental responsibilities.
 
✓ Pursuing someone’s commitment to a mental hospital if that person’s 
mental faculties are so impaired that she’s dangerous to society or she 
can’t care for herself.
 
✓ Ensuring that victims’ rights are protected from the moment charges are 
filed until sentencing, and even after that. (I discuss victims’ rights in 
detail in Chapter 4.)
 
✓ Enforcing civil restraining orders against people who violate them. A 
restraining order is an order by a court for one person to stay away from 
another person. Often, people request this order after their romantic 
relationships break up. If a person violates a restraining order, a judge 
can find the violator in contempt of court and fine the person, or even 
put her in jail.
 
✓ Overseeing multidisciplinary teams that investigate issues like child 
abuse or elder abuse. A multidisciplinary team may include social 
service workers, police, medical professionals, and judges. The goal 
of these teams is to bring a holistic approach to problem solving. 
Frequently, prosecutors lead these teams.
 
✓ Enforcing child-support orders against parents who fail to pay child 
support.
 
✓ Reviewing all suspicious deaths in the jurisdiction.
 
✓ Providing legal training to law enforcement agencies.
 
✓ Representing the state at probation-violation hearings, which occur 
when a probation officer alleges a person violated a condition of 
probation and brings the person before a judge for hearing.
As you can see, a prosecutor may have a number of different responsibilities. 
This wide range of duties can lead to a friendly dispute between elected 
prosecutors and elected sheriffs about who is the chief law enforcement 
officer in the county.

272
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
Defense Attorneys: Guardians of Liberty
Given humankind’s penchant for tyranny and abuse of individual rights, the 
role of the criminal defense attorney is one of the most important guarantees 
of freedom in the U.S. justice system.
You hear frequently about the importance of the right to free speech, the 
right to bear arms, and other constitutional guarantees. But every day the 
institution of the defense attorney guards against the almost-inevitable abuse 
of governmental power. And this job is no piece of cake. Criminal defendants 
are often an unsavory lot. Spending most of the work day with accused burglars, 
thieves, and rapists is a difficult job.
In addition to representing adult criminal defendants, defense attorneys often 
perform the following duties:
 
✓ Represent juveniles charged with crimes.
 
✓ Represent people accused of probation violations.
 
✓ Represent parents in family-law matters, such as the termination of 
parental rights.
 
✓ Serve on justice improvement committees, which are committees focused 
on improving the criminal justice system. For example, a judge, prosecutor, 
probation officer, and defense attorney may meet to figure out a way to 
create a drug court that efficiently deals with low-level drug offenders by 
providing them treatment.
 
✓ Represent criminal defendants when they appeal convictions to a higher 
court.
Often people can’t afford to hire lawyers to perform these services, which is 
where the constitutional right to counsel kicks in.
Hiring a public or private defender
The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution entitles a criminal defendant 
to counsel after judicial proceedings have begun against him. Generally, this 
right means that when a defendant is arraigned (informed of the criminal 
charges that have been filed against him), he becomes entitled to an attorney. 
At the arraignment, if the defendant wants a court-appointed attorney, he 
fills out paperwork setting forth his financial situation. The vast majority of 
defendants are indigent, meaning they can’t afford to hire their own lawyers, 
and, therefore, qualify for court-appointed lawyers.

273
 Chapter 19: Seeking Justice: The Players and Their Roles
In many jurisdictions, a government agency employs attorneys to represent 
defendants. These attorneys are often called public defenders. Frequently, 
however, the local government may contract with private attorneys to represent 
indigent defendants. Either way, the government is paying for an attorney 
to represent a criminal defendant’s interest. If the defendant is ultimately 
convicted, as part of the sentence, most states require a defendant to pay 
back some or all of the cost of his counsel.
	
The amount the government pays these attorneys is often well below the 
market rate for attorneys. In other words, representing indigent criminal 
defendants isn’t lucrative. As a consequence, many public defenders are new 
attorneys with little experience. The attorneys who make public defender 
work a career are often attorneys with strong personal convictions about the 
need to stand up and defend individuals against the potential for governmental 
abuse.
Some crimes are more likely to be committed by people who can afford 
to hire their own attorneys. For example, people all across the economic 
spectrum commit the crime of driving under the influence of an intoxicant. 
High-priced private attorneys can demand a $20,000 retainer to handle such 
cases, and many wealthy people pay this price. Similarly, people who commit 
white-collar crimes, such as fraud or embezzlement, often can afford their 
own expensive attorneys.
So, is there a difference in the quality of lawyering between low-paid public 
defenders and high-priced private attorneys? Would O. J. Simpson have been 
acquitted if he hadn’t paid for his “dream team” of lawyers: Robert Shapiro, 
Johnnie Cochran, F. Lee Bailey, and Alan Dershowitz? Well, I’ve known some 
very talented public defenders, but, in general, like everything else in life, you 
get what you pay for.
The public lawyer’s salary
Young lawyers often graduate from law school 
with over $100,000 in debt. Servicing that debt 
takes enough income to pay for the normal costs 
of living plus the debt payments. Unfortunately, 
for too many public attorneys, government 
salaries are just too low to cover all these costs. 
In Florida, about 19 percent of prosecutors and 
22 percent of public defenders quit every year, 
primarily because the government salary is far 
beneath the salaries of private attorneys.
In Missouri, for example, a new public defender 
makes $37,296, and a seasoned vet can make a 
maximum of $76,285. In contrast, according to 
the Association for Legal Career Professionals, 
the median starting salary for first-year private 
attorneys was $113,000 in 2007. Of course, this 
statistic includes mega-firms that pay very high 
salaries. But even for small private law firms of 
between 2 and 25 attorneys, the median first-
year salary was $67,000.
The moral is: If you want to make money, don’t 
work for the government.

274
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
Like prosecutors, public defenders carry very heavy caseloads. As a 
result, they have the same pressure to resolve cases efficiently through 
plea negotiations. High-priced private attorneys, however, have the luxury 
of smaller caseloads that allow them more time to investigate possible 
defenses and prepare for trial. So, generally, a privately hired attorney will 
provide better legal services because he has more time to prepare, has more 
experience, and may (or may not) be a better attorney.
Facing ethical dilemmas
Because of the nature of their work, defense attorneys regularly face a 
number of sticky ethical issues. Every state has different ethical rules, but 
for the most part, they’re similar. For example, ethical rules, in general, allow 
most attorneys to refuse to offer evidence that they reasonably believe is 
false. However, a criminal defense attorney can’t refuse to offer the testimony 
of his client unless he knows for a fact that the testimony is false.
Here’s just one example of a sticky ethical issue that defense attorneys 
across the country face on a daily basis (what would you do if you were in 
this situation?): Say you’re a defense attorney in the middle of trial. Your 
client is charged with assaulting his wife, and he says he wants to testify in 
his own defense. He plans to testify that his wife fell in the bathtub and that 
she ended up with a broken nose because of that fall. You don’t believe your 
client, but you don’t know for a fact that he’s lying.
In this example, because you don’t know for sure that your client is lying, in 
many states, you would have an ethical obligation to put him on the witness 
stand — even though you don’t personally believe him. So you can see the 
difficult decisions defense attorneys have to make every day.
Trial Judges: Overseeing 
the Justice Process
A judge is an attorney who has been appointed or elected to public office. 
Federal judges are appointed for life, but the term of office for state or local 
judges depends on local law. If elected, a judge typically has to run for 
reelection after four or six years.
Judges oversee all kinds of legal proceedings from tax court to bankruptcy 
law. In this section, I explain a judge’s responsibilities in the criminal justice 
system.

275
 Chapter 19: Seeking Justice: The Players and Their Roles
Authorizing cops to search
Even before criminal charges are filed, a judge may become involved in a 
criminal investigation. For example, police usually need to obtain a warrant 
from a judge before they can conduct a search of a private location. (I discuss 
search warrants in Chapter 18.) Officers visit a judge in her chambers or 
even at her home in the middle of the night to obtain search warrants. They 
present an affidavit (a statement under oath) that sets out why the officers 
believe the location contains evidence of a crime. If the judge finds that 
there’s probable cause to believe the place contains evidence of a crime, she 
signs a warrant authorizing the police to search there.
	
As you see again and again throughout the criminal justice process, the 
search-warrant requirement is a check on the potential for abusing government 
power. The U.S. Constitution requires an independent judge to authorize 
police to invade someone’s private place in most circumstances.
If a judge approves a search warrant, she usually doesn’t participate as the 
judge in the subsequent case (if charges are filed). In part, this is because the 
application for the warrant may contain information that won’t be offered 
into evidence during the trial. In effect, the judge who approved the search 
warrant would know more than she should if she presided over the criminal 
case.
Judges also approve other law enforcement activities, including the following 
types of searches:
 
✓ Wiretapping someone’s phone, house, or car
 
✓ Attaching mobile trackers to someone’s vehicle
 
✓ Requesting information about a person’s Internet activity
 
✓ Requesting cellphone records to show a person’s location when making 
a phone call
Keeping cases moving
When a defendant is charged with a crime, a judge presides over every hearing 
in the criminal justice process (but it’s not always the same judge). At the 
end of each step, the judge schedules the next step to make sure cases stay 
on track to get resolved. These pretrial hearings — not actual trials — take 
up most of a judge’s time. Here are the steps that a judge presides over:

276
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
 
✓ Arraignment: This step occurs when the defendant hears the charges 
against him and is given the chance to apply for a court-appointed 
counsel. The judge’s role in the arraignment is to make sure the 
defendant knows all his rights and to assign an appointed counsel if the 
defendant can’t afford his own.
 
✓ Release hearing: If a defendant is being held in jail, his lawyer may ask 
the judge to set bail or reduce bail. Bail is the amount of money a 
defendant pays as a guarantee that he’ll show up for the proceedings. If 
the judge finds that the defendant is a flight risk or a danger to society, 
she may set bail very high (such as $500,000) or even deny bail.
 
✓ Settlement conference: After the prosecutor gives the defense attorney a 
plea offer (if he decides to do so), both the prosecution and the defense 
attend a hearing at which the defendant can accept the offer, plead 
guilty, and be sentenced. If the defense rejects the plea offer, the judge 
schedules the case for trial.
 
✓ Omnibus hearing: A defense attorney requests an omnibus hearing 
when she believes that some of the prosecution’s evidence may be 
inadmissible (check out Chapter 20 for more info on this hearing). The 
defense attorney files a motion to suppress the evidence (usually to 
suppress the fruits of an illegal search or the inadmissible statements 
of the defendant), and, at the hearing, the prosecutor calls witnesses 
to prove that the evidence should be ruled admissible. The judge 
ultimately makes the decision about whether the evidence in question 
is admissible at trial.
 
✓ Trial: If the case isn’t settled during the settlement conference (or 
during last-minute plea negotiations), it goes to trial. During the trial, the 
judge acts somewhat like a referee, ruling on objections by the lawyers 
and keeping the proceedings moving. (See the next section for more 
details on the trial.)
 
✓ Sentencing hearing: If a defendant is found guilty at the trial or by 
pleading guilty, the judge presides over a sentencing hearing at which 
the defense attorney and prosecutors advocate for the sentence that 
they believe is appropriate.
	
	For example, the prosecutor points out any previous convictions of the 
defendant, the value of any property damage or medical costs to victims, 
and any other facts that may be helpful to the judge in imposing the 
sentence. The defense attorney explains any facts that may persuade 
the judge to lessen the sentence, such as: The defendant has started a 
new job, he’s sorry for what he did, or the crime resulted from his drug 
addiction and if he could just get some treatment, he’d stop committing 
crimes.
	
	The judge then imposes the sentence. Many states have determinate 
sentences for serious offenses, which means the judge has little 
discretion and must impose a specific jail or prison sentence based on 
the type of crime committed and the number of prior convictions.

277
 Chapter 19: Seeking Justice: The Players and Their Roles
Presiding over a trial
One of the most significant issues up for discussion before a trial starts 
is whether the defendant wants a jury. The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution guarantees a defendant’s right to a jury trial, but the defendant 
can choose to waive that right. If the defendant chooses to do so, the judge 
acts as the trier of fact, meaning that the judge decides whether the defendant 
is guilty. Having the judge determine guilt simplifies the trial process quite a 
bit. For instance, the prosecutor and the defense attorney don’t have to pick 
a jury, a process that can take a lot of time. And the judge doesn’t have to 
give instructions to the jury at the close of the case.
Besides saving time, having the judge act as the trier of fact also saves the 
trial participants some extra work. When a jury is involved, everyone has to 
be careful not to somehow prejudice the defendant. For example, in many 
states, a defendant has the right to change out of his jail clothes and into 
street clothes for a jury trial. The idea is that a jury may be more likely to 
think the defendant is guilty when he’s wearing an orange jumpsuit. If the 
defendant waives the jury trial, the trial participants don’t have to take such 
precautions. After all, the judge already knows whether the defendant is 
being kept in jail.
	
The bottom line is that a defendant’s decision to waive the right to a jury 
greatly speeds up a case. For example, early in my career, I tried an entire 
shoplifting case to a judge in a half hour. If the case had involved a jury, the 
case would’ve taken all day.
Regardless of whether the judge serves as the trier of fact, she must preside 
over proceedings and rule on numerous issues that pop up during the trial. 
Here are some of the more common issues the judge has to address:
 
✓ Should a potential juror be excused because she says she can’t be 
fair? Sometimes potential jurors have strong beliefs or life experiences 
that make them think they can’t be fair to the defendant or the prosecutor. 
For example, a potential juror whose husband was killed by a drunk 
driver may not think she can be fair to a defendant charged with drunk 
driving.
 
✓ Should witnesses be excluded from the courtroom? Usually, the parties 
(the prosecution and the defense) don’t want witnesses to hear what 
other witnesses testify about. The fear is that a witness may change her 
story after hearing other witnesses’ accounts. Many states do, however, 
give a victim the right to remain in the courtroom.
 
✓ Should certain evidence be admitted? Although most judges like to 
resolve questions about the admissibility of evidence before a trial 
begins, more issues about the admissibility of evidence inevitably arise 
during the course of the trial, and the judge must decide them.

278
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
 
✓ Should objections be sustained or overruled? Lawyers object to 
opposing counsels’ questions or procedures all the time, and the judge 
must apply a complicated set of rules, known as the rules of evidence, to 
decide whether to sustain an objection or to overrule the objection and 
let a witness answer a question. These rules govern the procedure of a 
trial. For example, the rules of evidence usually (but not always) prohibit 
the admission of hearsay evidence. So an attorney may object to a 
question that attempts to elicit an answer based on hearsay. (Giving a 
hearsay answer is simply testifying about what someone else said.)
 
✓ When should breaks or lunch be taken? Judges often have other 
business to take care of and, thus, have to take breaks to resolve it. 
Everyone else needs a break now and then, too. For example, a juror who 
smokes can get pretty irritable if she isn’t allowed to smoke a cigarette or 
two during the day. And everybody needs to go to the bathroom.
 
✓ After the lawyers are done presenting evidence, what instructions 
should the judge give to the jury about how to deliberate? The jury 
must be instructed on how to select a presiding juror (also called 
foreperson), how to decide the precise charges, and what facts they 
must find to conclude the defendant is guilty.
 
✓ Should the judge order dinner for the jury and make them deliberate 
into the night or have them come back the following day to continue 
deliberating? After a jury begins deliberation, the judge is responsible 
for the care and feeding of that jury.
Sentencing the defendant
If the judge or jury finds a defendant guilty, the next step is sentencing. 
Usually, the judge imposes the sentence. One significant exception involves 
the imposition of the death penalty sentence, which the jury imposes. I 
discuss the death penalty in detail in Chapter 21.
For misdemeanors and low-level crimes, judges usually have a lot of discretion 
about what sentence to impose (a sentencing system called indeterminate 
sentencing). With indeterminate sentencing, the sentence can include a 
combination of the following:
 
✓ Fines
 
✓ Jail time
 
✓ Community service
 
✓ An order to have no contact with a victim
 
✓ An order to complete treatment, such as drug treatment or anger 
management
 
✓ An order to pay restitution to the victim

279
 Chapter 19: Seeking Justice: The Players and Their Roles
For these sentences, the judge usually puts the defendant on probation, and 
a probation officer makes sure the defendant complies with the orders.
	
If the crime is a serious felony, such as rape, kidnapping, or murder, many 
states take away the judge’s sentencing discretion through laws that force 
the judge to impose mandatory sentences. This kind of sentencing system is 
called determinate sentencing because the sentence is already determined. 
For example, in Delaware, the offense of rape in the second degree carries a 
mandatory sentence of ten years in prison. The judge can’t do much about 
that sentence.
The prosecutor may allege additional facts in the indictment that ask the trier 
of fact (the jury, or the judge if the jury is waived) to find additional facts 
that can lengthen the sentence. For example, in Missouri, a rape conviction 
carries a mandatory minimum five-year sentence. However, if the prosecutor 
alleges in the indictment that a deadly weapon was used in the rape, and the 
jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that a gun was used in the rape, the 
minimum sentence becomes ten years in prison.
Mandatory minimum sentencing laws may have exceptions that allow the 
judge to impose lesser sentences, but these exceptions are often very limited. 
Minimum sentencing laws came into being, in part, as a check on perceived 
soft sentences by judges during the 1980s and 1990s when violent crime rates 
were very high. For example, in Oregon in the 1980s, a murderer could serve 
as few as 10 years in prison. In 2009, the minimum sentence for murder is 25 
years.
Appellate Judges: Setting 
Legal Precedents
When a defendant is found guilty, he doesn’t necessarily go quietly to jail 
and stay there. A defendant has the right to appeal his conviction. (The 
U.S. Constitution doesn’t guarantee the right to appeal, but every state has 
passed laws that give criminal defendants that right.)
Each state has at least one appellate court, but most states actually have two 
levels of appellate courts:
 
✓ The first level must hear all appeals.
 
✓ The second level, known as the supreme court in most states and in the 
federal system, hears second appeals from cases already decided by the 
lower appellate courts. Supreme courts have the discretion to decide 
which appeals they want to hear.

280
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
State appellate judges are either appointed or elected. In the federal system, 
appellate judges are appointed by the president of the United States and 
serve for life. The job of an appellate judge is quite a bit different from the job 
of a trial judge.
Looking for procedural errors
I want to be clear that the state (in other words, the prosecutor) has very 
limited appeal rights. The state can appeal only pretrial rulings of a trial 
judge, such as a judge’s decision to suppress evidence. After a trial starts, 
the state can no longer appeal any issue, which means that if a defendant 
is found not guilty, the case is over for good. The state can’t appeal the not 
guilty verdict. The defendant, however, has much greater appeal rights. For 
example, if he is found guilty, he can still appeal.
	
Appellate judges don’t hear evidence, and appellate courts don’t have juries. 
Rather, the whole process is much more cerebral. (In fact, trial lawyers often 
complain about appellate judges working in their “ivory towers,” not really 
knowing what life is like in the trenches.) Appellate lawyers write out their 
arguments, called appellate briefs, and give them to the appellate court. If the 
case is significant enough, the court may ask the lawyers to give oral arguments 
on the legal issues raised in the appellate briefs.
Appellate judges usually decide cases in groups. For example, three judges 
may decide an appeal. The three judges take a vote, and a judge on the 
majority side writes the appellate decision, called an opinion. State supreme 
courts usually have more than three judges that decide a case. And the U.S. 
Supreme Court has nine justices (another name for judges).
What exactly do appellate judges decide? Well, they don’t decide whether a 
defendant is guilty or not guilty. Rather, they give great deference to the 
factual findings of a jury (or the judge if a jury was waived). For the most 
part, appellate judges decide whether the trial judge made any procedural 
errors.
For example, assume that a jury found a defendant guilty of stealing a six-pack 
of beer from a Quickie Mart. The defendant can’t appeal the guilty finding, 
but he can appeal an evidentiary ruling of the trial judge.
For instance, if the trial judge admitted a confession by the defendant — 
ruling that the defendant wasn’t in custody when he confessed to the crime 
so the police didn’t need to read him his Miranda rights — on appeal, the 
appellate judges can conclude that the defendant was in custody because he 
was in a police car. Therefore, the trial judge made a mistake and shouldn’t 
have admitted the confession into evidence.

281
 Chapter 19: Seeking Justice: The Players and Their Roles
One of the appellate judges then writes the appellate opinion stating that 
the defendant’s confession should be suppressed because the police didn’t 
read him his Miranda rights. The opinion ends by remanding the case, which 
means the appellate court sends the case back to the trial court for a new 
trial. At the new trial, the defendant’s confession isn’t admissible.
	
The written opinion of the appellate court is very important to the U.S. judicial 
system because the opinion serves as a legal precedent, which guides trial 
courts and lawyers about what the law means. Following up on the previous 
example, future trial courts will rely on the appellate court’s decision and 
conclude that when a defendant is in a police car, he’s probably in custody, 
which means that for his confession to be admissible in court, the police must 
first read him his Miranda rights.
Each state has hundreds of volumes of books containing appellate court 
opinions on thousands of different topics. Attorneys spend a lot of time 
reading these opinions to figure out what the law really is.
Wading through the final layers of appeal
Okay, so a jury decides the case, and then an appellate court upholds the 
guilty verdict, ruling that the trial court made no errors. Next, the state 
supreme court upholds the trial court. You may think the process is finally 
over. Not necessarily.
If a defendant believes his federal or constitutional rights have been violated, 
he can next appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. This step is called filing a writ 
of certiorari. The U.S. Supreme Court accepts very, very few of these writs 
(although the famous Miranda v. Arizona decision was decided in the U.S. 
Supreme Court).
Even after the U.S. Supreme Court is done with a case, however, the case isn’t 
necessarily over. A defendant who is still in prison can collaterally attack his 
conviction by filing a lawsuit that challenges the lawfulness of his imprisonment. 
For example, an inmate may seek a writ of habeas corpus, which is an order 
from a court ruling that an individual is unlawfully imprisoned.
The vast majority of lawsuits filed by inmates seeking a writ of habeas corpus 
claim that the inmates’ defense attorneys provided ineffective assistance of 
counsel. In other words, the defendants’ attorneys did such bad jobs in the 
courtroom that the defendants were probably wrongfully convicted. Inmates 
can file an infinite number of these lawsuits. Some inmates go overboard and 
file a lot, which clogs up courts.
But have you ever heard a lawyer complain that there are too many lawsuits?

Finding the Truth: Pleading 
Guilty or Going to Trial
In This Chapter
▶ Looking for justice at the local, state, and federal levels
▶ Working toward a plea agreement
▶ Figuring out which evidence is admissible
▶ Following a case through trial
T

he U.S. criminal justice system includes local, state, and federal courts. 
The primary function of each court is to determine whether a defendant 
is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In this chapter, I briefly discuss each 
level of the court system and then walk you through a typical criminal case, 
from plea negotiations through trial.
Keeping It Local: Municipal Courts
Many towns and cities in the United States have their own laws and their own 
court systems. For example, a city council may pass laws against violations 
such as speeding and running a red light or even against some misdemeanor 
crimes like driving under the influence of intoxicants. At the local level, the 
police officer turns in her report to the city attorney, who acts as the prosecutor 
and decides whether to file charges. Someone who doesn’t want to plead 
guilty can have a trial in front of a municipal court judge or justice of the 
peace (who’s usually a local attorney working part-time as a judge).
Most of the crimes punished in municipal court are also crimes that can be 
punished in state court. So why do cities set up separate court systems? 
Because they get to keep the money they collect from fines. A municipal 
court can be a cash cow for a small town.

284
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
	
Keep in mind that you can’t be prosecuted in municipal court for a crime and 
then prosecuted in state court for the same crime. Being prosecuted for the 
same crime twice constitutes double jeopardy, which the Fifth Amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution prohibits. So, if you’re found not guilty of a crime, you 
can’t face the same charges again even if the government finds some really 
good new evidence.
	
One large exception to double jeopardy exists. The federal government and 
state governments are considered different entities. So technically, you can be 
acquitted of a crime in state court but still be prosecuted for that same crime 
in federal court, or vice versa. This situation is known as the dual sovereignty 
doctrine. But as a practical matter, being tried for the same crime in both state 
and federal court almost never happens.
Movin’ On Up: State Court Systems
In all states, the state court system does the heavy lifting. The vast majority 
of criminal charges in the United States are brought into state courts of 
general jurisdiction, which means they’re trial courts that have the authority 
to hear a broad variety of matters — not just criminal cases. These courts go 
by different names depending on the state:
 
✓ District courts
 
✓ Circuit courts
 
✓ Superior courts
 
✓ Courts of common pleas
And just to keep things interesting, the trial court in New York is called the 
Supreme Court.
Every state court system is different, but, generally, they follow this pattern:
	
1.	 Charges are filed by the local prosecutor (usually a district attorney), 
and hearings are held in front of a trial court judge. Charges are brought 
based on violations of state law, passed by the state legislature.
	
	 Of course, state courts have jurisdiction only over crimes committed 
in their states. Maryland state courts, for example, have no jurisdiction 
over crimes committed in, say, Virginia.
	
2.	 If a defendant is convicted, he can appeal his verdict to an appeals 
court. Each state has an appellate court, which decides whether errors 
were made in the trial court.
	
3.	 Many states now have two levels of appeals courts, so even if you lose 
your first appeal, you can appeal to an even higher court: the highest 
state appellate court.

285
 Chapter 20: Finding the Truth: Pleading Guilty or Going to Trial
	
4.	 After a defendant has exhausted his state court appeals, he may be 
able to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court if he asserts that one of his 
U.S. Constitutional rights was violated. The case Miranda v. Arizona, 
which I discuss in more detail in Chapter 18, was a state court decision 
ultimately appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court; there it resulted in the 
Miranda rights we hear every night in cop shows on TV.
Affecting the Whole Nation: 
The Federal Court System
Federal courts deal with violations of federal laws — laws passed by the U.S. 
Congress. Typically, Congress passes laws that deal with only certain types 
of serious offenses that impact the nation as a whole. For example, there’s no 
federal law against driving under the influence of intoxicants. So you can never 
be charged with a DUI in federal court. Also, most violent crimes and property 
crimes are taken care of in state court. So what exactly do the feds do?
Generally, the feds handle the types of crimes that federal law enforcement 
agencies investigate. (See Chapter 17 for a discussion of federal law 
enforcement.) These crimes include
 
✓ Acts of terrorism
 
✓ Serious drug trafficking (usually involving very large quantities of dope)
 
✓ White-collar crimes involving millions of dollars
 
✓ Serious computer crimes
 
✓ Weapons trafficking
 
✓ Immigration crimes
 
✓ Serious felonies on U.S. Indian reservations
At the federal level, the United States is divided into 94 districts. Each district 
has a U.S. attorney, who’s appointed by the president; the U.S. attorney is the 
prosecutor at the federal level and brings charges against defendants. Each 
U.S. attorney, in turn, has assistant U.S. attorneys who, in reality, do most of 
the trial work and who file charges.
Each of the nation’s 94 districts has its own U.S. district court, and each 
district court consists of a number of judges and courtrooms. The U.S. 
attorney in a district files charges in the district court, and a U.S. district 
court judge presides over a case just like a state court judge does.
U.S. district court judges are also appointed by the president, but the U.S. 
Constitution says that these judges are appointed for life (unlike the U.S. 
attorneys, who usually stay in office only as long as the president does).

286
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
Like in state court, defendants in the federal court system can appeal their 
guilty verdicts. They appeal to a U.S. circuit court, also known as a U.S. Court 
of Appeals. (The United States has 13 circuit courts, set up regionally.) Each 
circuit court has a number of judges who are appointed for life. When a 
defendant doesn’t like the result after his first appeal, he can appeal again to 
the highest court in the land, the U.S. Supreme Court.
The U.S. Supreme Court consists of nine justices, each one appointed for life. 
The Supreme Court Justice is a very powerful position — I’m sure you’ve 
seen the intense political fights that surround the U.S. Congress’s confirmation 
of presidential justice nominees.
	
Although the U.S. Court of Appeals has an obligation to take every appeal, the 
U.S. Supreme Court does not. In fact, it refuses to hear the vast majority of 
cases brought to it.
Negotiating a Plea Agreement
Note: Because the vast majority of criminal cases are processed in state 
courts, I use the language of state courts in the rest of this chapter. The 
procedures are fundamentally the same for federal and municipal courts.
In Chapter 19, I discuss the prosecutor’s role in filing charges. But what 
happens after charges are filed? First, a defendant is arraigned in court, 
which means he’s informed of the charges against him and given a copy of 
the charging document. This document is usually called an information or an 
indictment. (An information means the prosecutor is asserting the charges; 
an indictment means a grand jury instituted the charges. See Chapter 19 for a 
more detailed discussion.) Along with informing the defendant of the charges, 
the purpose of the arraignment is to provide him a court-appointed lawyer (if 
he can’t afford his own). Most defendants request a court-appointed lawyer.
	
After a lawyer is assigned to the defendant, the key question at hand is 
whether the defendant will take a plea offer. In the vast majority of cases, the 
defendant does negotiate a deal with the prosecutor. A 2005 survey of state 
court felony prosecutions found that only 3 percent of felony cases were 
closed by jury trial. Of course, a defendant can also waive a jury and let a 
judge hear the case, but it’s safe to say that more than 90 percent of criminal 
cases are resolved by plea agreement.
Typically, the prosecutor writes out a plea offer and gives it to the defendant’s 
lawyer. The offer may have a deadline attached. On behalf of their clients, 
defense attorneys can accept offers, make counter offers, or do nothing.
Often, a defendant’s lawyer will wait until the actual trial date approaches 
before answering a plea offer to see if the state’s case gets weaker. Sometimes 
prosecution witnesses move away or just don’t show up for trial. Other times 

287
 Chapter 20: Finding the Truth: Pleading Guilty or Going to Trial
the arresting officer is on vacation and can’t make the trial date. So there’s a 
constant tension between prosecutors and defense attorneys about whether 
plea offers will be accepted, countered, or rejected.
During negotiation, the prosecutor and defendant consider several different 
factors, which I discuss in the following sections.
	
Keep in mind that from the prosecutor’s side, she should make reasonable plea 
offers — offers that are reasonably fair and that defendants are likely to accept. 
If prosecutors and defense attorneys couldn’t agree on plea deals, the whole 
criminal justice system would break down. I don’t know of any jurisdiction that 
has enough judges, lawyers, and courtrooms for every case to go to trial.
Determining the strength of the evidence
From the defendant’s side, the most important consideration is how strong 
the evidence in the case is. The weakest cases (from the prosecutor’s view­
point) are the ones that go to trial. If a case is weak, the defendant has a good 
shot at being acquitted. If the defendant is clearly guilty, he’s usually better 
off taking a deal.
The only time it makes sense for a defendant to go to trial when the state 
has a good case is when the defendant has nothing to lose. For example, if a 
defendant is facing a long mandatory sentence in prison even under the plea 
offer, he may roll the dice to see whether he can get lucky at trial.
Figuring out time in custody
Aside from the strength of the evidence, the next most important consideration 
is how much time in custody the plea offer contemplates. Obviously, defendants 
want to stay out of jail, so the two sides may negotiate over the amount of 
time in the plea agreement.
Negotiations over time in custody can get difficult when the crime calls for a 
mandatory sentence. A mandatory sentence means that if a defendant is 
convicted, whether he pleads guilty or is found guilty at trial, he must serve 
the entire sentence.
The presence of additional charges can make negotiations easier. For example, 
if a defendant is charged with attempted murder for shooting a gun into a 
house several times, the prosecutor may add additional charges, such as 
attempted assault or unlawful use of a deadly weapon. In the plea offer, the 
prosecutor can agree to dismiss these charges, which theoretically could 
carry additional prison time. By accepting this offer, the defendant at least 
gets some charges dismissed and reduces the risk of a lengthier sentence by 
pleading guilty to the attempted murder charge.

288
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
Considering victim compensation
As I discuss in Chapter 4, most states require that defendants compensate 
the victims for the losses the victims suffered. Prosecutors usually consider 
this compensation a high priority and don’t negotiate it away. Sometimes, 
such as in theft scams of multiple victims, a prosecutor may reduce the 
number of charges if the defendant can come up with a bunch of money to 
help the victims recover from the crime. If the defendant doesn’t bring the 
money up front, however, all the prosecutor can get is a court order for the 
defendant to pay money in the future, but, frequently, such orders aren’t 
vigorously enforced.
Frankly, in such cases, I’d rather see a retiree get 70 percent of her life savings 
back than see a defendant spend an extra year in prison. And sometimes 
these are the tough choices that prosecutors must make in plea negotiations.
Working out probation conditions
If a defendant isn’t sentenced to prison (and most defendants aren’t), 
chances are he’ll be put on probation. Probation means that for a certain 
period of time, a bunch of restrictions can be placed on him. If the defendant 
violates probation, he can be punished further. Prosecutors and defendants 
may work out probation options during the negotiations, but usually there 
are standard probation conditions that apply in most crimes. Some common 
probation conditions require that the defendant
 
✓ Perform community service
 
✓ Pay a fine
 
✓ Complete drug or alcohol treatment (if either one was involved in the 
crime)
 
✓ Complete anger management treatment (if anger was involved in the 
crime)
 
✓ Have no contact with the victim
 
✓ Pay back court costs
 
✓ Obey all laws
To avoid jail time, defense attorneys frequently offer that the defendant do 
community service. In many jurisdictions with limited jail space, community 
service is the primary sanction for misdemeanors.

289
 Chapter 20: Finding the Truth: Pleading Guilty or Going to Trial
Suppressing Evidence (Or Not): 
The Pretrial Hearing
As part of a plea agreement, the prosecutor often requires the defendant to 
give up his right to argue that evidence should be suppressed. Alternatively, 
if a defense attorney believes she has a good argument that some evidence is 
inadmissible, she may encourage her client to reject the plea offer and litigate 
the issue, which is where the pretrial hearing comes in.
The admissibility of evidence is determined in a pretrial hearing by a judge 
(no jury is involved). This hearing is sometimes called a suppression hearing 
or an omnibus hearing. In criminal law, two primary issues dominate omnibus 
hearings:
 
✓ Whether a search was lawful
 
✓ Whether the defendant’s statements were voluntary
Of course, other issues are also litigated during omnibus hearings. If you’re 
really interested in finding out what they are, maybe you’re a good candidate 
for law school.
Determining whether a search was legal
Although the issue of police searches and seizures of property can be very 
complex (some people still struggle with it even after spending three years in 
law school), the U.S. Constitution basically prohibits police from searching a 
person or place except in these circumstances:
 
✓ The officer has probable cause to believe the location has evidence of 
a crime (meaning that the chance that evidence will be found there is 
greater than 50 percent) and
 
✓ The officer has a search warrant authorized by a judge (in which the 
judge agrees that the officer has probable cause) or
 
✓ There’s a recognized exception to the warrant requirement.
	
	Many exceptions to the warrant requirement exist. Here’s just one 
example: The search is incident to an arrest, meaning an officer who 
arrests a person can search that person for evidence of the crime or for 
weapons without getting a warrant from a judge (check out Chapter 18 
for more on search warrants).

290
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
When a defense attorney believes a search may have been unlawful, she 
files a motion to suppress the evidence that was obtained from the search. A 
motion is simply a written argument filed with the court.
At the omnibus hearing, the prosecutor calls the police officer as a witness 
to testify about the actions he took. The defendant’s attorney has a right to 
cross-examine the witness. If a judge agrees that the search was unlawful, he 
rules that the evidence obtained during the search must be suppressed, which 
means it isn’t admissible at the later trial. The suppression of evidence often 
means the prosecutor can’t prove his case and must dismiss it.
Taking a look at the confessions 
of a defendant
The other major area of criminal law that gets litigated in suppression or 
omnibus hearings involves defendant statements. Like search and seizure 
law, the constitutional right of a defendant not to incriminate herself can get 
very complicated. Here are a few of the more common scenarios that a judge 
may have to rule on:
 
✓ If a defendant was in custody, an officer must have read her the Miranda 
rights (right to remain silent, right to an attorney, and all that stuff) 
before the officer questioned her. (If she wasn’t in custody, he need not 
have read the Miranda rights to her.) So the judge has to determine 
whether the defendant was in custody. Generally, being in custody 
means that a reasonable person wouldn’t feel free to leave the scene.
 
✓ If the defendant was in custody and an officer read her the Miranda 
rights, the judge has to determine whether the defendant understood 
her rights and voluntarily waived them by agreeing to talk without a 
lawyer present.
 
✓ If the defendant was in custody, the judge has to determine whether the 
officer engaged in questioning or whether the defendant just voluntarily 
made statements without being asked any questions.
Each issue heavily depends on the facts in a particular circumstance. So 
testimony by police and perhaps the defendant are crucial to resolving these 
issues.

291
 Chapter 20: Finding the Truth: Pleading Guilty or Going to Trial
Facing a Jury (Or a Judge): The Process
After a defendant has rejected a plea offer and litigated all the issues about 
admissibility of evidence, the next step in the process is trial. Every case 
is presided over by a judge, but the defendant has the right to have a jury 
decide whether or not he’s guilty. The defendant can also choose to waive 
the right to a jury and ask the judge to decide his guilt.
Choosing trial by jury or by judge
The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that every defendant 
has “the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury.” The framers 
of the Constitution considered the jury trial an important protection against 
governmental abuse.
But sometimes defendants waive their right to a jury trial and have a judge 
decide their case instead. A defendant’s decision to have a judge decide his 
case depends on several factors. For one, judges are just like everyone else — 
some are tough, some are soft, some are good for a defendant, and some 
are bad for a defendant. Most defense attorneys know the judges in their 
courthouse, so they know which judges may help their defendant’s case.
If a defendant draws a favorable judge, he may waive the right to a jury. Or, if 
the facts are particularly inflammatory, such as when a defendant is accused 
of molesting a child (an offense that can make jurors’ blood boil), the defendant 
may waive the jury, hoping that a judge will do a better job of setting aside 
any passion or prejudice.
Selecting a jury
If the defendant chooses to have a jury trial, the next step is to select a jury. 
Each state determines who’s eligible to be a juror. Typically, to sit on a 
criminal case, you must be a U.S. citizen, you must be 18 years of age or 
older, and you must not have ever been convicted of a felony. A large pool 
of potential jurors receives a jury summons in the mail, and these potential 
jurors are required to show up at the local courthouse. They sit in a waiting 
room, waiting to see whether a trial is going to happen. (Often, cases set for 
trial end in plea agreements at the last minute.)

292
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
If a case actually goes to trial, a judge’s assistant comes to the waiting room 
and takes a large group of potential jurors back to the courtroom. At this 
point, the judge puts all the potential jurors under oath (meaning they swear 
to tell the truth). Then the judge, the defense attorney, and the prosecutor 
take turns asking questions of the potential jurors to see whether they can be 
fair and impartial. In truth, the defense attorney and the prosecutor are also 
looking for jurors who are more likely to be favorable to their side.
For example, a prosecutor may ask, “Has anyone ever had a bad experience 
with a police officer?” The prosecutor’s purpose is to identify someone who 
may be less likely to believe a cop as a witness.
	
At the request of either attorney, a judge can excuse a potential juror who 
asserts that he or she can’t be fair. In addition, the defense attorney and the 
prosecutor each have the right to remove a certain number of potential jurors. 
This process of removing potential jurors is officially known as exercising a 
peremptory challenge. For a 12-person jury, many states allow each side to 
challenge six potential jurors. The only restriction is that a prosecutor can’t 
challenge a potential juror on the basis of the juror’s race or membership in 
some other group, such as a group defined by gender or ethnicity.
Making opening statements
After the jury is selected, the next step in the trial is the opening statement, 
which is when each lawyer tells the jury what evidence he or she will offer 
during the trial. The prosecutor goes first, and the defense attorney follows. 
The opening statements aren’t considered evidence.
At this point, the lawyers aren’t permitted to try to argue or persuade the 
jury that they’re right and the other side is wrong. Nonetheless, an effective 
opening statement can persuasively lay out the facts in such a way that a jury 
may start to believe one lawyer more than the other.
Personally, I believe the opening statement is the most important part of a 
jury trial. If I can get the jury to believe me during the opening statement, the 
jurors may almost be rooting for me as I lay out my evidence during the trial.
Proving the state’s case
When the opening statements are finished, it’s time to actually offer evidence. 
The state offers its evidence first because it has the burden of proof.

293
 Chapter 20: Finding the Truth: Pleading Guilty or Going to Trial
You’ve undoubtedly heard the statement, “The defendant is presumed 
innocent.” In essence, this statement means that if neither the prosecutor nor 
the defense attorney offered any evidence, the jury would have to vote not 
guilty. That’s because the prosecutor, on behalf of the state, has the burden 
of proof, and if he doesn’t offer any evidence, he fails to meet that burden.
In law, there are generally three different levels (or standards) of the burden 
of proof:
 
✓ A preponderance of the evidence: This standard is used in civil lawsuits 
in which the plaintiff (the person who brings the lawsuit) has the burden 
of proof. Essentially, this standard means that the plaintiff wins the 
lawsuit if the jury finds that there’s at least a 51 percent chance that the 
plaintiff is right.
 
✓ Clear and convincing evidence: This standard, which is slightly higher 
than “a preponderance of the evidence,” is used in some types of legal 
proceedings, such as civil forfeiture of property (which I discuss in 
Chapter 8).
 
✓ Beyond a reasonable doubt: This standard, the highest burden of proof 
in law, is used in criminal cases. Here’s a common definition of reasonable 
doubt that a jury may be given:
	
	The defendant is innocent unless and until the defendant is proven 
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The burden is on the state to prove 
the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. Reasonable doubt 
is doubt based on common sense and reason and means an honest 
uncertainty as to the guilt of the defendant. Reasonable doubt exists 
when, after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence, you 
are not convinced that the defendant is guilty to a moral certainty.
Conducting direct examinations
The state begins its case by calling a witness. The witness is placed under 
oath and asked questions by the prosecutor. This process is called direct 
examination. Except in simple cases, the prosecutor usually has to call a 
number of witnesses.
Direct examination isn’t very difficult. Essentially, it’s the art of getting the 
witness to tell a story about what she knows. Sometimes witnesses are 
scared or intimidated by court, and the direct examiner has to work a little 
harder. But to show how simple the process can be, here are a few of the 
most common direct-examination questions:

294
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
 
✓ What happened next?
 
✓ And then what did you do?
 
✓ Why did you do that?
Displaying physical exhibits
Sometimes jurors need to see physical objects (called exhibits) to help them 
make their decision. For example, photographs of a victim’s face may help 
the jury decide whether the victim was assaulted by her husband. Other 
times a jury just expects to see an item like a murder weapon, whether it’s 
crucial to the decision or not.
To allow a jury to see an exhibit, the lawyer must do the following:
 
✓ Lay a foundation: Laying a foundation means proving that the item is 
what the lawyer claims it is. For example, a lawyer may have to prove 
that the bullet he’s offering into evidence was retrieved from the murder 
victim. To lay this foundation, the prosecutor would call as a witness the 
person who retrieved the bullet during the victim’s autopsy.
 
✓ Establish that the item is relevant: The lawyer has to show that the 
exhibit is relevant to the case at hand. It wouldn’t make sense to offer a 
gun into evidence in a drunk-driving case, for example.
The lawyer calls one or more witnesses and asks them questions to lay the 
foundation and to establish the exhibit’s relevance. The lawyer then offers 
the exhibit into evidence. If the judge admits the exhibit into evidence, the 
jurors get to see it, and they get to take it with them into the jury room when 
they deliberate at the end of the trial.
Cross-examining witnesses
After the prosecutor has finished his direct examination of a witness, the 
defense attorney gets to cross-examine that witness. Unlike direct examination 
in which the lawyer asks open-ended questions, in cross-examination, the 
lawyer gets to ask leading questions. A leading question is one that contains 
the answer, so the witness just needs to answer yes or no.
Here are a couple of examples of direct-examination questions as compared 
to leading questions:

295
 Chapter 20: Finding the Truth: Pleading Guilty or Going to Trial
 
✓ Where do you live? (Direct)
 
✓ You live in Manhattan, don’t you? (Leading)
 
✓ What happened next? (Direct)
 
✓ You then banged my client’s head as you forced him into your police car, 
correct? (Leading)
	
Cross-examination is an extremely important right for the defendant. When 
done properly, it’s the best defense against someone who lies or makes a 
mistake during direct examination. After all, placing someone under oath 
doesn’t really prevent her from lying. But the fear of cross-examination does 
reduce lying, and if a person chooses to lie, cross-examination is the best way 
to expose it.
Putting on a defense
After the prosecutor has called all his witnesses and presented all his evidence, 
he stands up and tells the judge, “The state rests.” At this point, it’s the 
defendant’s turn. But remember, the defendant doesn’t have any burden 
of proof. This means the defendant doesn’t have to offer any evidence. 
Frequently, at this point in a trial, the defense attorney will stand and say, 
“The defense rests also, your honor.” This statement means the case is over.
Why would the defense attorney choose not to offer any evidence? Well, for 
one, she may think the prosecution’s case was weak and that the prosecutor 
didn’t prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Or, she may 
not have any evidence to offer. Ultimately, the decision isn’t up to the defense 
attorney but to the defendant.
When a defendant decides to call witnesses, the lawyers’ roles are reversed. 
The defense attorney conducts direct examination of the witnesses, and the 
prosecutor gets to cross-examine them.
Deciding whether the defendant should testify
One of the most important decisions a defendant and his attorney have to 
make is whether or not the defendant should testify. From the lawyer’s 
perspective, it’s often a mistake to have a defendant testify.
Cross-examination of a defendant often reveals weaknesses in the defendant’s 
story and harms his credibility. But even though defense attorneys may try 
to persuade their clients not to testify, many defendants insist on doing so. 
Some defendants have extensive experience at fooling people and believe 
they can con a jury. Again, the decision ultimately belongs to the defendant.

296
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
Recognizing common defenses
When a defense attorney does call witnesses, she usually does so because 
she has a theory that explains the defendant’s innocence. For example, her 
theory may be that the defendant was mistakenly identified, known as the 
“some other dude did it” defense. Or she may theorize that the police officer 
did a poor investigation and failed to look hard enough to find the evidence 
to clear her client.
Some defense theories are formally recognized by law. If a defendant asserts 
a formal theory after the prosecution has proved its case, the defendant 
actually has a legal burden to prove his defense. The following sections 
describe a few common legal defenses.
Self-defense or defense of another
It’s a firmly rooted legal principle that a person is entitled to defend himself 
against a physical attack by another. Imagine, for example, that you shot and 
killed someone because that person was attacking you with a knife. Should 
charges be brought against you? Of course not — you were acting in self-defense. 
Similarly, you’re entitled to defend an innocent third person against an 
imminent physical attack by another.
Every state has laws that recognize a person’s right to defend himself or a 
third person. But there are limits. For example, if a person threatens to punch 
you, you can’t shoot him. Or if a person says, “Tomorrow, I’m going to kill 
you,” you’re not entitled to shoot that person today.
The use of force in self-defense must be reasonable. You can use only the 
amount of force necessary to repel the attack, and the physical attack or 
threat of an attack must be imminent. Some states have laws that require a 
person under attack to escape, if he can. This is known as the retreat rule. 
Other state laws say you’re entitled to stand your ground and don’t have to 
retreat.
Smart prosecutors don’t file charges when self-defense is a clear justification. 
However, if two guys are involved in a fist fight in a bar, and one pulls a knife 
and stabs the other, charges can be filed. The issues at trial would be the 
following:
 
✓ Did the defendant have an obligation to retreat under his state’s law?
 
✓ Was it reasonable to use a knife to repel the attack?
Choice of evils
In some states, if you had no choice but to commit a crime, you may have 
a legal defense. Here’s an example of when the choice of evils defense may 
apply. Your driver’s license is suspended, so it’s illegal for you to drive. 

297
 Chapter 20: Finding the Truth: Pleading Guilty or Going to Trial
But your husband cuts off his hand with a table saw, and you drive him to 
the hospital. A police officer can arrest you for the crime of driving while 
suspended. But because you were forced to choose between letting your 
husband bleed to death and committing a minor traffic crime, a jury would 
probably acquit you. In fact, charges probably wouldn’t be brought against 
you in the first place. This defense is very rare.
Alibi
With the alibi defense, the defendant asserts that he was somewhere else at 
the time the crime was committed. But it’s not very persuasive for just the 
defendant to say so. He usually needs to bring in another witness — his alibi 
witness — to testify that the defendant was with him.
Many states require the defense to give advance notice to the prosecution of 
the use of an alibi witness so that the prosecutor isn’t ambushed at trial and 
has time to investigate the alibi.
Entrapment
When the government induces a person to commit a crime, he has been 
entrapped and can assert this defense. Generally, this defense applies to 
undercover police work.
For example, some cops work undercover on the Internet to catch child 
molesters. If an officer pretends to be a 13-year-old girl and actively solicits 
an older man for sex, that older man can probably assert a defense of 
entrapment.
Insanity
Along with self-defense, insanity may be the most common legal defense. The 
theory behind it is that only people who understand what they’re doing and 
who can control their behavior should be held responsible for their criminal 
conduct. States have different rules about what constitutes an insanity 
defense, but generally the rules require proof of one of the following:
 
✓ By reason of mental defect, the defendant was unable to distinguish 
right from wrong.
 
✓ By reason of mental defect, the defendant was unable to conform his 
conduct to the requirements of the law.
	
By mental defect, I don’t mean a personality disorder. Many people who 
commit crimes have serious personality defects or even mental illnesses, but 
these defects don’t excuse their conduct. The vast majority of people, despite 
their mental deficiencies, understand the difference between right and wrong. 
In Chapter 14, I discuss the distinction between personality disorders and 
mental illnesses in greater detail.

298
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
To constitute a legitimate insanity defense, the mental illness must be very 
severe. Paranoid schizophrenia is one of the mental illnesses most diagnosed 
in people asserting an insanity defense, because this disorder is usually 
accompanied by hallucinations or delusions. For example, if a person has a 
delusion that his neighbor is trying to kill him, his subsequent attack on that 
neighbor may be excused through an insanity defense.
Typically, a defendant must give advance notice that he’s asserting an 
insanity defense. He does so only after his own psychologist or psychiatrist 
has evaluated him and concluded he was insane at the time of the crime. 
The state then has the right to subject the defendant to an evaluation by a 
psychologist or psychiatrist of its choice. Whether the defendant is found 
insane usually depends on the testimony of those mental health professionals. 
A person found insane isn’t typically sent to prison but, if found dangerous, 
can be sent to a mental hospital.
In Chapter 14, I discuss brain function and mental illness as potential causes 
of criminality.
Hearing closing arguments
When both the state and the defendant have rested their cases, it’s time for 
the closing arguments (also called the summation). The prosecutor goes first, 
followed by the defense attorney. In many states, the prosecutor then gets to 
give a rebuttal closing argument.
The point of the closing argument is to allow each side to make its best case 
for why the jury should convict or acquit. Unlike an opening statement, 
which is limited to describing what the evidence will show, during closing 
arguments the lawyers are much freer to comment on the credibility of 
witnesses and to argue the meaning of the law. However, the following 
restrictions limit what the lawyers can argue:
 
✓ The prosecutor can’t comment on the defendant’s refusal to testify. 
(Remember that defendants have the right to remain silent, and juries 
aren’t supposed to draw any inference of guilt when a defendant 
exercises that right.)
 
✓ The prosecutor can’t inflame prejudice or passion in the jury. For 
example, calling a defendant “an animal” has been ruled impermissible.
 
✓ Neither attorney can misstate the law or the evidence.
 
✓ Neither attorney can offer personal beliefs or personally vouch for the 
credibility of a witness. There’s a fine distinction between commenting on 
the credibility of witnesses and offering personal beliefs. For instance, 
a lawyer can say that a witness lied, but she can’t say, “I personally 
believe the witness is a liar.”

299
 Chapter 20: Finding the Truth: Pleading Guilty or Going to Trial
	
Any of these missteps can result in an objection from the other party and 
possibly even a mistrial. A mistrial occurs when the judge believes that an 
error of such consequence has occurred that the jury can’t ignore it and 
render a fair verdict.
Reaching a verdict
After the lawyers finish closing arguments, they’re done. The judge now gives 
instructions to the jury about the rules they must follow and what they have 
to vote on. The instructions can be simple in a case with just one charge, but 
if the defendant is charged with multiple counts, the judge’s instructions can 
be very complicated. The jury receives the elements for each crime and is 
reminded that they must find each element beyond a reasonable doubt.
Deliberating in private
After the jury is instructed, the jurors leave the courtroom and go into the 
deliberation room. The jurors are instructed not to talk to anyone about the 
case and not to read newspaper stories or listen to news reports about the 
case until they’re done deliberating. In extremely high-profile cases, jurors 
may be sequestered, which means they’re put up in a hotel and kept from 
having contact with anyone else until they’re done deliberating.
The jury’s first duty is to select a foreperson, who is also called the presiding 
juror. His or her job is to preside over the deliberations, take the final verdict, 
and deliver it to the court.
There’s no set procedure for how a jury deliberates. Jurors are free to handle 
deliberations any way they want. I’ve seen juries conduct a preliminary vote 
and, if they’re all in agreement, return a verdict within ten minutes. Generally, 
though, the more serious the charge, the longer the jury takes to deliberate.
Reaching a deadlock
In almost every state, the jury must reach a unanimous verdict. This means 
all 12 jurors must agree on a vote of guilty or not guilty. Sometimes, not all 
jurors can agree. This situation is called a deadlock. The foreperson may send 
a note to the judge explaining that they can’t agree. Invariably, the judge tells 
them to keep deliberating.
Ultimately, if the jury can’t reach unanimity, the judge finds that he has a 
hung jury (another word for deadlock) and declares a mistrial. Essentially, 
declaring a mistrial here is the equivalent of yelling, “Do over!”
Sometimes, a hung jury forces both sides to negotiate a settlement. Other 
times, if the vote looked bad for the prosecutor (such as 11–1 in favor of a 
not-guilty verdict), the prosecutor may just dismiss the case. But often, the 

300
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
court schedules another trial date, and everyone has to do it all over again. 
No one wants a mistrial, which is why the judge forces the jury to keep 
deliberating even after they first declare that they’re deadlocked.
Asking jury questions
Frequently, juries come up with questions while they’re deliberating. When they 
do, they pass their question to the judge via a note. The judge calls the lawyers 
into her chambers, and they all discuss how to respond to the question.
	
Personally, the best question I ever heard as a prosecutor was on a murder 
case. The jury asked, “Since we’ve found the defendant guilty of murder, do we 
need to consider the other charges?”
There’s no typical question, however. Sometimes jurors don’t understand 
their instructions and want a better explanation. Sometimes they want to 
hear a witness’s testimony replayed. Sometimes they’re hungry and want to 
order dinner.
Reaching the moment of truth
When the jury reaches unanimity on all the counts, they pass a note to the 
judge that says they’ve reached a verdict. The judge’s clerk calls both lawyers 
and tells them to reconvene in the courtroom. The jury is brought into the 
room. The defendant is asked to stand. The foreperson either reads the 
verdict herself or hands it to the judge who reads it. Needless to say, it’s a 
very anxious moment in the courtroom.
Not guilty doesn’t mean “innocent”
Almost invariably, the media reports a not guilty 
verdict as “innocent” (such as in the headline, 
“Jury Finds O. J. Innocent”). Seeing headlines 
like this one is a pet peeve of mine because it’s 
factually wrong. A criminal jury doesn’t ever find 
innocence. What the jury finds is that either
 ✓ The defendant was guilty beyond a 
reasonable doubt or
 ✓ There wasn’t enough evidence to find guilt 
beyond reasonable doubt so the defendant 
isn’t guilty.
In other words, all you can conclude from a 
not guilty verdict is that there wasn’t enough 
evidence to vote guilty. You may remember from 
the O. J. case that a later civil jury found that 
there was enough evidence to conclude that by 
the lesser standard of “preponderance of the 
evidence,” O. J. did commit the murders. To me, 
the word innocence means that, conclusively, 
the person didn’t commit the crime, and that’s 
not what a jury finds.

and How Society Does It

A

s of June 2008, the number of people living in state and federal prisons 
and local jails in the United States was 2,310,984, or roughly 1 out of 
every 200 people. This rate is the highest in the world, followed first by 
Russia and then by a few countries in the Caribbean.
The U.S. incarceration rate has been growing steadily since the 1980s. Since 
2000, it has been growing at an annual rate of 2.7 percent. The ramifications 
of a high incarceration rate are significant. The more people you lock up, the 
more tax dollars you need, the more hardships families of inmates experience, 
and perhaps the more hardened criminals you create. Thus, criminologists 
often decry the high rate of incarceration.
However, as the rate of incarceration has climbed, the overall crime rate has 
dropped. So the last 15 years seem to show that a greater incarceration rate 
may help lead to a reduction in crime, which means fewer victims and fewer 
societal costs associated with crime.
In this chapter, I explore different theories for why society locks people up, 
describe where society locks them up, and point out some of the challenges 
of running a prison system. I also wade into the debate about the death 
penalty.

302
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
Understanding Theories of Punishment 
and Incarceration
Since humans started committing crime, people have grappled with the 
question of what to do about it. Society’s primary method for dealing with 
crime is restraint on liberty via imprisonment, or incarceration, although it 
also imposes fines and makes people perform labor (such as “community 
service”). Legislatures across the nation constantly debate the various 
theories of why and how society punishes criminals. In this section, I 
introduce the primary theories of punishment.
Seeking retribution, not personal revenge
Likely the oldest theory of incarceration, retribution holds that a person 
who commits a crime should pay some price, generally in proportion to the 
offense committed. This approach seems to fit society’s sense of fairness: 
When you do something wrong, you pay a price equal to what you did.
Part of this theory is that punishment is necessary to maintain respect for 
the laws. If I received no punishment for stealing from the local grocery store, 
why wouldn’t I do so? After all, everybody needs a free meal sometimes, 
right?
Also underlying the concept of retribution is the notion that, in a civil society, 
individuals shouldn’t take revenge or seek personal retribution. Rather, 
the government is in a better position to consistently mete out the correct 
amount of punishment. In other words, society doesn’t want victims to 
retaliate with violence, so it’s in society’s best interest for the government 
to take “revenge” on behalf of the individual.
Deterring future crimes
Deterrence is more of a utilitarian theory than is retribution. This theory 
holds that the existence of punishment prevents people from committing 
crime. For instance, knowing that I’ll go to jail for 14 days for committing 
theft from the grocery store, I decide to pay for my six-pack of beer rather 
than steal it.
	
Obviously, this theory hinges on the belief that people change their conduct 
based on the threat of punishment. But as I discuss in Chapters 12 through 
15, not all crime can be explained as being based on rational thinking. In other 
words, people may commit crime in the face of all reason, regardless of the 
punishment. And for people involved in organized crime, sometimes the 
punishment is just “the cost of doing business.”

303
 Chapter 21: Punishing the Guilty: Why and How Society Does It
So why does the threat of punishment deter people from committing crime? 
Answering this question isn’t just an intellectual exercise. Over the last 
20 years, policymakers have dramatically increased sentence length for a 
number of offenses. So, is a long sentence more likely to deter crime? Or 
(as more and more people are arguing) is the certainty and swiftness of 
punishment more important than severity in deterring crime?
Some recent successful programs seem to suggest that immediate consequences 
may be more effective than delayed ones. For example, in Hawaii, a drug 
court program that immediately holds people accountable for failing urine 
tests has effectively deterred more violations than threats of longer but 
delayed sentences have done elsewhere.
Protecting society: Incapacitation
The incapacitation theory is based on the idea that when you lock someone 
up, you essentially keep that person from committing other crimes in the 
“outside” world. (Keep in mind, though, that the person can still commit 
more crimes in jail or prison.) So, by locking up a burglar, you prevent him 
from committing many more burglaries — thus, you protect society from the 
harm that comes from further theft by that person. (After all, burglars often 
don’t stop at just one attempt.)
Generally, studies have shown that locking up violent offenders prevents 
the most harm to society. For example, sexual offenders are likely to commit 
numerous acts, and their acts have great costs to victims and society, so 
locking them up prevents them from continually harming new victims. 
Property criminals are also likely to reoffend, but their crimes carry much 
less cost to society.
Aiming for rehabilitation and restoration
The idea at the heart of the rehabilitation theory is that society provides 
treatment to criminals so they can be rehabilitated and released back into 
society — without committing future crimes. Strictly speaking, this theory 
isn’t a theory of punishment. Rather, it’s a kind of antipunishment that rests 
on the following assumptions:
 
✓ People can change.
 
✓ Society can identify the personal traits that lead a person to commit 
crime.
 
✓ Society can develop effective programs to change those traits in criminals.
 
✓ Criminals want to change (or society can make them change).

304
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
During the 1970s and 1980s, rehabilitation was a very popular theory. But the 
lack of widespread success in rehabilitating criminals led to greater emphasis 
on the other theories of punishment. Nonetheless, most prisons continue to 
operate significant treatment programs today. And as researchers increasingly 
use the scientific method to measure treatment success, the hope is that 
they’ll make significant breakthroughs in effective treatment. I discuss treatment 
in more detail in the “Implementing treatment and education programs” 
section later in this chapter.
Combining the theories
In reality, nobody clings solely to one of these theories as the only reason for 
punishment. When deciding on how and why to punish criminal offenders, 
policymakers consider and adopt components of all these theories. For 
example:
 
✓ Society should provide effective treatment when it can.
 
✓ Society should keep dangerous offenders off the street.
 
✓ Society should provide a just punishment that fits the crime so 
vigilantes don’t take justice into their own hands.
 
✓ Society should try to deter other people from choosing lives of crime.
Placing Defendants in Custody
After someone is convicted of a crime and sentenced, what happens to him? 
Jail? Prison? Something else? Well, it depends on the crime.
	
Before moving on, I want to make an important distinction. Very few people 
understand the difference between jail and prison. A jail is usually a county 
facility for incarcerating people who committed lower-level offenses for fairly 
short periods of time. A prison is usually run by a state (or by the feds) and is 
for housing inmates who committed more serious offenses for longer periods 
of time. Generally, a person convicted of a misdemeanor can go to jail but 
not to prison. And, generally, a person convicted of a serious felony goes to 
prison, not to jail.
Going to a local jail
Different categories of jails exist. The primary local detention facility is 
usually the county jail, operated by the elected sheriff for a county. The 
county jail is often the primary detention facility in the county. However, 

305
 Chapter 21: Punishing the Guilty: Why and How Society Does It
some police departments may have small jails, too, which are often referred 
to as holding cells. (Remember, sheriffs and deputy sheriffs usually work for 
the county; police work for the city.)
When a police officer arrests someone, he may take the arrestee to his own 
department and place her in the holding cell while he fingerprints and books 
her. Then, the officer may drive the offender to the local jail for an overnight 
stay. In many jurisdictions, however, the entire booking process takes place 
at the county jail.
Some police departments actually have larger jails, so they can detain 
inmates overnight.
Holding people before trial
What happens when a police officer arrives at the county jail with an arrestee? 
Today many (perhaps most) jails experience overcrowding, meaning that they 
don’t have nearly enough jail cells to house all the criminals. So when a new 
arrestee arrives at a jail, a jail official, who may be known as a corrections 
officer, a deputy sheriff, or a release officer, must first decide whether to lodge 
or release the arrestee. Here are the two most important questions to consider 
when deciding whether to release an arrestee:
 
✓ Is the person a danger to society?
 
✓ Is the person likely to show up for his hearings?
For example, a person arrested for murder is considered both a danger to 
society and a flight risk, so, despite overcrowding, the jail official will find a 
bed for him. However, a person arrested for forgery isn’t considered a danger 
to society (at least not for violent conduct). Such a criminal is much more 
likely to be released until arraignment. But if, for example, the forger has 
failed to appear for 15 previous cases, he may be considered a flight risk and, 
therefore, be lodged overnight.
When an arrestee is released, he’s required to sign a release agreement, 
which has a number of conditions attached to it. Those conditions may 
require the arrestee to do the following:
 
✓ Post some bail. If bail is required, the arrestee is usually allowed to post 
10 percent of the full amount. But if the arrestee flees, he may forfeit the 
full amount. For low-level offenses, bail usually isn’t required.
 
✓ Have no contact with the victim (if there is one).
 
✓ Appear at the next scheduled hearing.
 
✓ Acknowledge that failure to appear at a court hearing can result in an 
arrest for the crime of “failure to appear.”

306
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
	
What happens if a jail is completely full on Friday, for example, but Friday 
night, two gang members are arrested for murder? Jail officials can’t release 
two persons arrested for murder. So they usually release less dangerous 
people who are already lodged in the jail. Most jails have developed complex 
formulas to help them decide whom to release when overcrowding becomes a 
problem. Where jail overcrowding is a serious problem, dangerous people are 
regularly released while awaiting their trial.
According to a U.S. Department of Justice study, in June 2008, there were 
785,556 inmates in local jails, which were at 95 percent of capacity — meaning 
that many jails were filled to the rafters.
When a person is lodged in jail, his attorney may ask a judge for a bail hearing, 
during which the attorney asks that bail be set (if none was set previously) or 
lowered (if it was previously set too high for the defendant to post).
Punishing the guilty in jail
Although many people incarcerated in local jails are awaiting trial, jails are 
also used as destinations for convicted people. Usually, a person sentenced 
to jail is there for a misdemeanor or low-level felony.
A typical sentence in jail may be anything from a weekend to a year, but 
overcrowding can affect the length of time actually served. For example, 
someone who has served half his sentence for forgery may be released to 
make room for a person arrested for murder.
Heading to state prison
People aren’t usually held in state prisons while waiting for their trials. 
Instead, people usually go to state prisons only after they’ve been convicted 
of serious crimes. In June 2008, 1,409,442 people were housed in U.S. state 
prisons, and 93 percent of them were men. About half of these people were 
in prison for violent offenses, 20 percent of them were in for serious property 
offenses, and another 20 percent were doing time for serious drug crimes. (A 
person doesn’t go to prison for low-level drug offenses, typically.)
It’s important to note, however, that today some states are paying county 
jails to house inmates who previously would’ve been sent to state prison. 
The reason is that jails are usually cheaper to operate because they provide 
fewer services to inmates, so states save money. (I describe the services 
typically provided in prison in the next section.)
State prisons are usually run by an agency called the state Department of 
Corrections. Most states have a number of prisons, and each prison may 
have different categories of inmates based on considerations like dangerousness 
and escape risk. The types of state prisons include

307
 Chapter 21: Punishing the Guilty: Why and How Society Does It
 
✓ Maximum security
 
✓ Medium security
 
✓ Minimum security
 
✓ Women’s prison
 
✓ Work or boot camps (military-like programs that can reduce an inmate’s 
overall sentence)
 
✓ Honor camps
 
✓ Youth correction facilities (technically not considered “prisons” because 
they house juveniles)
Obviously, a maximum-security prison holds the most dangerous offenders. 
It’s built with many security features to prevent escape and to keep staff and 
other inmates as safe as possible. In contrast, a minimum-security prison or 
honor camp may have much less security. Inmates in such prisons typically 
aren’t violent offenders and may be serving shorter sentences. A person 
with a short sentence is less likely to try to escape than a “lifer” (someone 
fulfilling a life sentence in prison) who has nothing to lose. In an honor camp, 
the inmate may be trusted to work outside the prison walls on his own and 
return back at the end of the day.
You may have heard people joke about “country club” prisons where people 
like Martha Stewart go. I can assure you that these minimum-security prisons 
are nothing like country clubs. But they do have less security for a good 
reason — maximum-security prisons are expensive to run. So a state can 
save a lot of money by placing nonviolent property crime offenders in 
less-expensive facilities.
General services in state prisons
	
Prison officials typically speak of the prison environment as a “city within a 
city.” By that phrase, they mean that a prison has most of the services and 
activities of regular society. Here are just a few examples of the activities a 
prison must enable prisoners to do:
 
✓ Eat meals (on clean dishes)
 
✓ Take showers
 
✓ Have clean laundry
 
✓ Get haircuts
 
✓ Receive and send mail
 
✓ Go to church
 
✓ Work at jobs
 
✓ Go to school

308
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
 
✓ Exercise
 
✓ Take books out of a library
 
✓ Access healthcare
Most of these services, such as cooking, laundry, and running the library, are 
performed by inmates. But who else works in a prison? Obviously, corrections 
officers (or prison guards, as they were once called) are an important 
requirement. They’re responsible for maintaining order and keeping things 
running smoothly in a prison. And, of course, you have prison administrative 
officials who manage operations. But a prison also needs just about every 
other type of service. For example, a prison must provide healthcare, so it 
needs doctors, nurses, and other medical technicians. So you see, a prison 
truly is a little city within a city.
Additional punishments within state prisons
When prison inmates violate rules, they’re subject to punishment. Prisons 
typically have disciplinary segregation units, which are considered the “jails” 
of the prison. So when an inmate violates a rule or gets into a fight, he may be 
removed from his regular cell and placed in a segregation unit as punishment, 
where he loses the privileges that a well-behaved inmate enjoys.
When an inmate commits a serious violation, such as throwing feces on a 
corrections officer, he may be put in the prison’s “prison,” often known as 
an intensive management unit. Typically, an inmate loses all privileges and is 
isolated and confined to a cell. If you ever visit a prison, you’ll notice that this 
unit is one of the bleakest places in the whole facility. People in this unit can 
be very dangerous — so much so that when they’re moved to and from this 
unit, they usually have their hands and feet chained and are accompanied 
by at least two corrections officers. Inmates often refer to the intensive 
management unit as “the hole.”
In addition to segregated disciplinary units, prisons also have special units 
for people in need of intensive psychiatric care or those who are at risk in the 
general prison population. These units are sometimes called administrative 
segregation units because inmates are segregated for administrative purposes 
and not for disciplinary reasons.
For example, corrections officers may decide to put an African American 
inmate in an administrative segregation unit for protection after learning that 
members of the Aryan Brotherhood, a white-supremacist prison group, have 
targeted him for killing. State prisons also have agreements with other states 
to exchange inmates for reasons of security. So the targeted inmate may even 
be moved out of state.

309
 Chapter 21: Punishing the Guilty: Why and How Society Does It
The majority of U.S. states allow the death penalty, which means that most 
state prisons also have a separate unit called death row. Death row units 
differ from state to state, but, generally, death row inmates are kept separate 
from inmates in the general population. As a result, their access to services 
is frequently quite limited. Death rows vary quite a bit, from California, where 
roughly 670 people sit on death row, to New Hampshire, where one person 
sits on death row (as of 2008).
Facing federal prison
The Bureau of Federal Prisons runs all the prisons in the United States for 
inmates convicted of federal crimes. There are no federal jails, so if you’re 
convicted in federal court and sentenced to do time, you’ll usually be sent to 
a federal prison. As of 2009, there were 115 federal institutions that housed 
about 165,000 inmates. (Another 40,000 federal inmates were housed in a 
variety of other settings, including private prisons, which I discuss in the 
next section.)
The federal prison system has a lot more money than most state prison 
systems. As a result, federal prisons experience less overcrowding and can 
hire more corrections officers. Even the food is usually better! The types 
of inmates in federal prisons may also be different from the state prison 
populations because state courts typically handle most violent crimes while 
federal courts more often handle serious drug-trafficking cases, immigration 
crimes, and major fraud.
Keep in mind, though, that federal prisons may also house inmates convicted 
in military court. And sometimes extremely violent offenders are convicted 
federally. For example, Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 people by bombing 
the federal building in Oklahoma City, was convicted in federal court and 
lodged in federal prison until he was executed in 2001.
	
Like state prison systems, the federal system includes institutions with 
different levels of security, from a high-security prison in Victorville, California, 
to a minimum-security prison camp in Otisville, New York. What matters in 
prison life isn’t so much the distinction between state and federal but rather 
the distinction between minimum-security and maximum-security facilities.

310
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
Serving time in Private Prison, Inc.
Since the 1980s, states and the federal government have looked to private 
corporations to help them house inmates. In 1984, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service became the first government agency to lodge inmates 
with a private company, the Corrections Corporation of America, which now 
operates 60 different institutions and houses more than 75,000 inmates. This 
company claims to be the fourth-largest corrections system in America, 
behind the federal government and two large states.
Other large private companies in the corrections business include
 
✓ GEO Group, Inc.
 
✓ Cornell Companies, Inc.
 
✓ Community Education Centers, Inc.
 
✓ Management and Training Corporation
These companies may design, build, and manage entire prisons, or they may 
contract certain services, such as inmate transportation or education and 
treatment services. In June 2008, 126,249 inmates from state and federal 
systems were incarcerated in private prisons. This number was up from 
90,542 in 2000. The southern states have by far the most inmates housed in 
private facilities.
Why privatize? Well, the primary argument is that private companies are 
more efficient and can run quality prisons for less than governmental 
bureaucracies. Keep in mind that the modern movement started during the 
Reagan era with its emphasis on privatization. A 2001 study by Montague and 
Erik based on a Federal Bureau of Prison survey in New Mexico found that 
private prisons were rated higher than government prisons in most categories.
However, some people, including criminologists and corrections officer 
unions, criticize the privatization of prisons for a variety of reasons. Here are 
just a few of the criticisms:
 
✓ Because a business’s goal is to make money, these prisons have a strong 
incentive to cut corners, which means reducing inmate services. Doing 
so can place inmates and employees at risk.
 
✓ The close relationship between government and private corporations 
can lead to corruption. (Believe it or not, some politicians have been 
known to accept large contributions from private corporations.)
 
✓ Making a profit from imprisoning human beings doesn’t seem morally 
right.

311
 Chapter 21: Punishing the Guilty: Why and How Society Does It
One of the key measures of the success of prison programs is the recidivism 
rate: the likelihood that an inmate will commit another crime and return 
to prison after being released. A 2003 study by the Florida Department of 
Corrections and the Criminology Department at Florida State University 
found no significant difference in recidivism for inmates in publicly operated 
prisons versus those in privately operated prisons.
Facing Challenges in the Prison System
Prisons are incredibly complex enterprises. Not only must management 
provide all the services I mention in the “Heading to state prison” section, 
but they must do so for people convicted of crimes.
Many prison inmates are physically dangerous, conniving, manipulating, and/
or mentally ill. In other words, the normal level of trust that exists in open 
society can’t exist in a jail or prison. In this section, I discuss just a handful of 
the many challenges of running a prison.
Controlling contraband
Anything that an inmate isn’t allowed to possess is considered contraband. In 
most states, it’s a crime for an inmate to possess certain types of contraband. 
As a practical matter, however, prisons rarely refer these cases to prosecutors 
because they would further clog the court system. Plus, prison management 
doesn’t want to deal with the headache of transporting inmates out of the 
prison to local courts.
Here are some of the most common types of contraband:
 
✓ Drugs
 
✓ Cigarettes
 
✓ Chewing tobacco
 
✓ Cellphones
 
✓ Lighters
 
✓ Knives
Contraband is regularly used as barter within prison, or someone may 
extort another inmate for drugs or tobacco. One of the newer trends is using 
cellphones within prisons. Because normal prison phone calls are recorded, 
inmates try to use smuggled-in cellphones to conduct criminal activity 
outside of the prison walls.

312
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
So, if contraband is illegal, how does it get into prisons in the first place? 
Thousands of ways. After all, inmates are extremely creative people. Here are 
just a few:
 
✓ Visitors often aren’t searched and are allowed to have physical contact 
(such as hugs) with inmates.
 
✓ Many volunteers work in prisons and bring in items such as books. A 
volunteer may not know that in the spine of a book is a small package of 
heroin.
 
✓ Friends who aren’t in prison can throw items over prison fences into the 
yard, later to be found by inmates.
 
✓ Prison staff members are sometimes compromised and smuggle 
contraband into the prison for inmates.
	
	Staff corruption is a particularly challenging issue for prison management. 
In many prisons, new corrections officers make very little money, and 
some of them can be paid off. Other staff members may become
romantically involved with inmates, while still others are extorted.
	
In 2008, nine Federal Bureau of Prison workers were indicted for smuggling 
cellphones, heroin, tobacco, and a knife into prison. In that particular prison, a 
cellphone sold for $2,000 and a pack of cigarettes for over $100.
Contrary to what many people think, inmates do have access to money. The 
prison keeps an account for each inmate, into which relatives and friends can 
contribute money. Inmates can then use their accounts to purchase items 
from the prison commissary. But inmates generally don’t get to carry cash, 
at least not lawfully, anyway. So inmates can pay for contraband in a variety 
of ways, including bartering or having relatives and friends on the outside 
exchange money.
Dealing with inmate violence
When a person is sentenced to prison, but before he’s assigned a specific 
prison, he goes through an intake process in which he’s evaluated to determine 
a variety of things, including the likelihood that he’ll engage in violence. 
This process helps determine whether the inmate needs to be placed in a 
maximum-security prison or in a facility with less security. Considerations for 
which prison he should be placed in include
 
✓ The crime the inmate committed
 
✓ The inmate’s criminal history
 
✓ The inmate’s known membership in gangs or organized crime

313
 Chapter 21: Punishing the Guilty: Why and How Society Does It
 
✓ The presence of personality disorders or mental illness in the inmate
 
✓ Other characteristics that may lead to victimization in prison (such as 
being a child molester — because child molesters are often targeted for 
violence in prisons)
Identifying causes of violence
Although this intake process clearly does help reduce conflict and violence, 
prisons can still be dangerous places. Here are some of the most common 
causes of prison violence:
 
✓ Conflict between individual inmates
 
✓ Conflict between groups
 
✓ Race
 
✓ Status within a group
 
✓ Extortion of inmates
 
✓ Trade in contraband, including the collection of debts
 
✓ Resentment of authority and perceived abuse by authority
 
✓ Stress and oppression that may result from overcrowding or coercive 
actions
Racial bias and hatred are among the leading causes of violence in prisons. 
For example, tension between white-supremacist groups, black street gangs, 
and other groups like them — all of which are usually recognized in prison as 
security-threat groups — is behind much of the threat of violence in prisons. 
In fact, security-threat groups often grant higher status to members based 
on making one’s “bones,” which means assaulting a corrections officer or a 
member of a rival organization.
Getting creative with prison violence
As with smuggling contraband, inmates can be very creative in fashioning 
weapons. An inmate can rub a toothbrush handle against concrete to make 
a pointed stabbing weapon known as a shiv. Shivs are one of the preferred 
weapons because they’re so easy to make. Inmates may even smear feces on 
such weapons to help create infections in the stabbing victims.
Smuggled metal with tape as a handle can also make an effective stabbing 
weapon or a set of metal knuckles. A heavy object in a sock, such as a bar of 
soap, can be dangerous when swung. And then there’s the throwing of urine, 
human waste, or semen, which is particularly common when the violence is 
directed toward corrections officers.

314
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
Controlling the violence
Controlling prison violence is extremely difficult. Of course, super maximum-
security prisons that lock inmates down for 23 hours a day can reduce 
violence. Although sometimes necessary, such an approach is extremely 
expensive, not to mention dehumanizing and harsh. (I’ve toured an institution 
in California that uses that approach, and it’s depressing, to say the least.) 
Because most inmates eventually will be released, prison officials can’t just 
isolate them while they’re in prison and then expect them to successfully 
reenter society. Thus, this level of severe lockdown is reserved for the most 
dangerous criminals.
So how else can you control violence? Because prisons can’t afford to have 
corrections officers everywhere, they tend to rely on a complex system 
of rewards and social controls. For instance, when an inmate behaves 
appropriately, he gains access to certain rewards, such as
 
✓ The choice of cells in a better cellblock
 
✓ The ability to lock his own cell
 
✓ A TV in his cell
 
✓ A better prison job
 
✓ Extended access to recreational facilities
 
✓ The ability to choose a cellmate
In addition, prison officials informally rely on a hierarchy in the prison that 
has a vested interest in reducing conflict. For example, I visited one prison 
where the “lifer’s club” exerted a large amount of influence. Because these 
particular inmates were in for life, they generally wanted to maximize the 
benefits in prison, which meant coming down on individuals or groups who 
caused problems that may have reduced their privileges. In addition, people 
running successful businesses, such as smuggling contraband, don’t want to 
upset the social order and risk their businesses.
Lastly, prisons have had success in dramatically reducing murder rates 
by placing stricter controls on gang leaders, who often direct violence in 
the interests of the gang. If the gang leader is isolated in administrative 
segregation, it’s harder for him to order a “hit.”
Implementing treatment 
and education programs
As I discuss earlier in the chapter, one of the core theories of punishment 
calls for society to help rehabilitate inmates. For the most part, rehabilitation 
occurs through treatment programs and education. Here are some common 
focuses of treatment and education:

315
 Chapter 21: Punishing the Guilty: Why and How Society Does It
 
✓ Alcohol and drug abuse
 
✓ Anger management
 
✓ Other mental health programs
 
✓ Job readiness
 
✓ Life skills
 
✓ Work skills
 
✓ Sex offender treatment
Thousands of treatment and education programs take place in prisons across 
the country. In fact, I can’t even begin to discuss the scope and breadth of 
these efforts. But even with so many programs, it’s important to note that 
one of the most significant issues surrounding treatment is figuring out how 
successful it really is.
	
According to one of the most important measures — recidivism rates — 
rehabilitation programs haven’t been very successful at all. The most recent 
national study of recidivism rates found that, in 1994, two-thirds of released 
prison inmates were rearrested for felonies (not counting misdemeanors!) 
within three years.
For this reason and others, some politicians and law enforcement officials 
look at inmate treatment and education as a waste of money. After all, it’s 
easy to say that an inmate committed a crime and, thus, deserves a hard, 
tough life in prison. But a California study concluded that nine out of ten of 
its prison inmates are eventually released back into society. In 2003, the state 
of Illinois found that an inmate’s average prison stay lasted just 1.3 years. 
When these people get out of prison, society expects them to be successful, 
get jobs, and live crime-free lives, right? Well, education programs that help 
inmates earn GEDs or high school degrees or learn particular skills can help 
them transition to the real world and, ideally, reduce recidivism.
Sometimes, however, prison systems lack the funds for services that help 
people being released from prison during the transition period. For example, 
newly released inmates benefit greatly from getting help with paying security 
deposits (first and last months’ rents), finding jobs, and making friends who 
aren’t criminals. Unfortunately, when states face budget crises, corrections 
budgets are often the first place legislators look to cut back. Sometimes there 
are no government-sponsored transition programs at all and the only available 
services are those provided by underfunded, private, nonprofit organizations 
or groups of volunteers to help operate halfway houses or help with job 
placements or transitional counseling.
Critics of treatment and education programs rightly point out that evidence 
of their success is often questionable or nonexistent. Although some programs 
work, others don’t, and prison officials often don’t have enough evidence to 
decide which programs to keep. Plus, it’s not just the programs that matter; 

316
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
the quality and commitment of the corrections staff doing all the work play a 
big role in the effectiveness of treatment programs, too. In the coming years, 
my hope is that governments will spend sufficient tax dollars to identify 
successful programs through sound, scientific studies. In the long run, 
such efforts may reduce overall expenditures and lead to more successful 
rehabilitation efforts.
	
It’s important for the criminal justice community to remember that inmates 
are human beings, entitled to certain minimum standards of decency and 
respect. Gandhi once said, “You can judge a society by how it treats its animals.” 
But I believe how people treat their fellow humans, even those who violate 
criminal laws, is an even better barometer. Even from a purely utilitarian point 
of view, helping inmates successfully transition back to society makes the rest 
of society safer and saves money.
Covering the cost of imprisonment
In 2008, the United States spent approximately $50 billion on incarceration 
costs. This number is up from $38 billion in 2001 (not accounting for inflation). 
The most recent federal study of prison costs was done in 2001 by the U.S. 
Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics. According to this study, 
total expenditures for corrections rose 145 percent between 1986 and 2001. 
(This stat does account for inflation.)
Although some states are more efficient than others, in 2001, the average 
annual cost for incarcerating one inmate was $22,650. Maine spent the most 
per inmate at $44,379 per year. (Maine also has one of the lowest incarceration 
rates in the country.) Alabama spent the least at $8,128 per inmate. Labor 
costs account for a lot of the differences in expenditures. Not surprisingly, 
prisons with high inmate-to-officer ratios are cheaper to run than prisons 
that employ many more corrections officers.
About three-fourths of all incarceration costs go toward running prisons; 
the remaining amounts go toward running juvenile incarceration programs 
(see Chapter 22 for more info on these programs) and probation and parole 
programs, which I discuss in the next section.
Placing Defendants on Probation
When a defendant is sentenced for a misdemeanor or a lower-level felony, the 
judge usually places that defendant on probation for a period of time.

317
 Chapter 21: Punishing the Guilty: Why and How Society Does It
Putting a defendant on probation allows a judge to create certain conditions 
that the defendant must comply with (or risk being punished more severely). 
Usually a defendant is assigned to a probation officer who makes sure the 
defendant complies with all the conditions the judge set forth. Here are some 
common probation conditions (though not all of them are always imposed):
 
✓ Complete a short jail sentence
 
✓ Successfully complete drug or alcohol treatment
 
✓ Pay all fines, court costs, and restitution to the victim
 
✓ Complete a certain amount of community service
 
✓ Finish anger management treatment or other mental health treatment
 
✓ Stay away from the victim
 
✓ Obey all laws
The probation officer’s role
A probation officer (usually called a P.O.) must make sure the defendant 
(called the probationer or parolee) is complying with all the conditions of 
probation. Often, doing so means helping the probationer figure out how to 
comply. For example, a probationer who has lost his driving privileges may 
not be able to get to an alcohol treatment location, so the P.O. may help 
the probationer figure out how to take the bus there. P.O.’s also have the 
authority to conduct searches if they believe probationers are violating 
probation conditions. For example, if a P.O. believes that a probationer 
convicted of selling drugs is back in business, the P.O. can search the 
probationer’s house without getting a warrant from a judge.
The difference between parole and probation
In most states, probation applies to lower-level 
offenses, such as misdemeanors. On the other 
hand, a person is likely to be placed on parole 
when he’s released from prison. Essentially, 
parole is the same as probation. The parolee 
must comply with certain conditions or run the 
risk of being sent back to prison. Even so, he has 
the same right to a hearing as a probationer.
In some states, parole is called post-prison 
supervision. The parole officer performs the 
same role as the probation officer. In fact, in 
many states, a parole officer may simultane­
ously be a probation officer.

318
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
P.O.’s work for probation departments, which can be part of a county public 
safety agency, a sheriff’s office, or even a state Department of Corrections. 
Each state is different. P.O.’s typically carry very heavy caseloads, which limit 
their ability to monitor their probationers. They may see each probationer 
once a month or less.
	
P.O.’s are the unheralded workhorses of the criminal justice system. You 
don’t see a lot of TV shows about them, but a good, diligent P.O. can make a 
big difference in helping a probationer get out of the criminal lifestyle.
Probation violations and their effects
If a probationer gets caught violating a condition of probation, the P.O. or a 
cop can rearrest the probationer and bring him before a judge for a hearing 
on the probation violation. For example, a man convicted of burglary has 
a probation condition that requires him to obey all laws. So if the man gets 
arrested for driving while intoxicated, he’ll face not only a DUI charge but 
also a probation violation on the burglary conviction.
Although probationers have the right to a hearing before a judge (as well as a 
right to a lawyer), as a practical matter, they usually work the matter out with 
their P.O.’s — at least for minor violations. In the DUI example, the P.O. may 
just recommend no sanction and that probation be continued, knowing that 
the probationer will separately be punished for the DUI charge.
Sometimes, however, the violation is more serious and can result in additional 
jail time. If the P.O. and the probationer can’t work out a sanction, there has 
to be a hearing before a judge. A prosecutor calls witnesses to prove the 
probation violation, and the probationer’s attorney has the right to cross-
examine witnesses. This hearing usually follows a much less formal process 
than a real trial. (There’s no jury, for example, and the judge determines 
whether the probationer violated the probation conditions.)
Debating the Death Penalty
No issue in criminal law is more contentious than capital punishment, otherwise 
known as the death penalty, which is why I devote an entire section to the 
subject.
Capital punishment is lawful in 35 states, which means in these states, the 
government can lawfully kill a person who has been convicted of certain 
types of murder. The federal government and the U.S. military also have laws 
for the imposition of the death penalty. As of 2009, the following 15 states 
(plus the District of Columbia) do not allow for the execution of a person as 
punishment for any crime:

319
 Chapter 21: Punishing the Guilty: Why and How Society Does It
 
✓ Alaska
 
✓ Hawaii
 
✓ Iowa
 
✓ Maine
 
✓ Massachusetts
 
✓ Michigan
 
✓ Minnesota
 
✓ New Jersey
 
✓ New Mexico
 
✓ New York
 
✓ North Dakota
 
✓ Rhode Island
 
✓ Vermont
 
✓ West Virginia
 
✓ Wisconsin
Only about 60 countries in the world still retain the death penalty and use it. 
(Some countries still have it on the books but haven’t put it to use in many 
years.) Admission to the European Union (EU) depends in part on whether a 
country has outlawed the death penalty. Consequently, the only country in 
Europe that still allows the death penalty is Belarus. Other prominent countries 
that have abolished the death penalty include:
 
✓ Mexico
 
✓ Canada
 
✓ Australia
 
✓ New Zealand
 
✓ Brazil
 
✓ Israel
Still using the death penalty are most Middle Eastern countries, along with 
Japan, China, Cuba, India, and South Korea.
The crimes you can die for
Over time, the types of crimes that can be punished by death have changed. 
The first formal execution in the American colonies was in 1607 as punishment 
for mutiny. The second was in 1622 for theft. The vast majority of executions 
in the United States, however, have been for the crime of murder. Even so, in 
U.S. history, well over 400 people have been executed for the crime of rape.
	
Today the U.S. Supreme Court has essentially prohibited executions for 
any crimes except murder. In 2008, it ruled that a child rapist can’t be 
executed because doing so would violate the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishments. Essentially, 
the reason given was that the punishment would be disproportionate to the 
crime. Perhaps the only remaining crime on the books besides murder that 
can receive the death penalty is treason.

320
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
The rules of a capital case
The U.S. Supreme Court has set out some specific rules that a state must 
follow to impose a sentence of death. First, the murder trial must take place 
in two parts. In other words, there must be a trial to determine guilt for the 
crime and then a second penalty phase to make a separate determination of 
whether the defendant deserves to be put to death.
Penalty phase
During the penalty phase, a jury, not a judge, must decide whether additional 
aggravating factors that justify a death sentence are present in the case. These 
factors must be beyond just the crime of murder. Each state may identify its 
own aggravating factors, but it must do so in law, to avoid giving prosecutors 
or juries too much discretion.
Here are some common aggravating factors found in the criminal codes of 
many states:
 
✓ The defendant is a continuing threat to society.
 
✓ The murder was deliberate.
 
✓ The defendant killed two or more people.
 
✓ The murder was committed as part of an escape.
 
✓ The murder was of a witness, police officer, corrections officer, 
or judicial officer.
 
✓ The murder was of a child.
 
✓ The murder was accompanied by torture.
 
✓ The murder was for hire.
 
✓ The murder was committed in the course of committing another serious 
felony.
Mitigating evidence
In addition to deciding the existence of aggravating factors, a jury must also 
consider all mitigating evidence — evidence that argues against executing 
the defendant. Although aggravating factors must be set out in state law, 
mitigating factors are any factors that may persuade a jury to impose a 
sentence less than death.
Here are some common types of mitigating evidence:
 
✓ The defendant was under the influence of an intoxicant.
 
✓ The defendant suffered from a mental disorder at the time of the murder.
 
✓ The defendant is very young (or very old).

321
 Chapter 21: Punishing the Guilty: Why and How Society Does It
 
✓ The defendant was raised in a bad environment.
 
✓ The defendant was abused as a child.
 
✓ The defendant suffers from an organic brain disorder.
Essentially, the U.S. Supreme Court has said that anything is admissible as 
mitigating evidence if it may persuade a juror to spare the defendant’s life.
Ineligibility categories
Certain categories of persons are ineligible for the death penalty, regardless of 
how bad their murder was:
 
✓ The legally insane
 
✓ Minors
 
✓ The mentally retarded
The Supreme Court has said that a person must be fully responsible for his crime 
to receive the death penalty, and because defendants in these three categories 
are somewhat less responsible, they’re excluded from the death sentence. As a 
practical matter, however, whether someone is legally insane or whether some­
one is mentally retarded is often subject to vigorous challenge. If retardation or 
insanity isn’t clear, a jury will be asked to make that determination.
	
After the defendant has been found guilty, and after the parties have conducted 
the second phase of the trial (the penalty phase), the jury is asked, “Should 
the defendant receive a death sentence?” The verdict must be unanimous for 
a person to be sentenced to death. If only one juror votes against death, the 
defendant won’t be executed.
Appeals
After a jury has voted for a death sentence, the matter isn’t over. Obviously, 
the defendant has the right to appeal any errors in the trial. Even when 
his appeals are done, he may collaterally attack his conviction, usually by 
claiming his lawyer was incompetent. (See Chapter 19 in which I discuss the 
appellate and habeas corpus processes.) Depending on the state, there can 
be more than ten levels of appeal over 20 years or more before a sentence is 
finally carried out.
The execution process
When an inmate’s appeals and habeas corpus petitions have been denied, the 
process toward execution begins. Although each state is unique, generally, a 
final execution date is set. This step in the process often sets off another round 
of appeals and requests for clemency. For example, at this stage, a state’s 
governor can commute (or change) a sentence from death to life imprisonment.

322
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
	
In 2003, Illinois Governor George Ryan granted clemency to all 167 people on 
Illinois’s death row, reducing their sentences to “life in prison.” He did so 
because he claimed the system was fraught with errors that had led to some 
wrongly convicted defendants. A firestorm erupted as families of many victims 
complained about the wholesale granting of clemency. (In 2006, Ryan was 
convicted of unrelated federal corruption charges.) This example of clemency 
was a rare exception, however. Usually governors don’t commute sentences 
absent some unique political or compelling humanitarian reason.
As the execution day approaches, the inmate’s attorneys may file additional 
paperwork with a court, sometimes asserting newly discovered evidence, to 
delay the execution.
Just before execution, in some states, the inmate is transferred from his cell 
on death row to another cell near the execution room. The inmate gets to 
choose a last meal and is entitled to meet with a prison chaplain or other 
clergy member.
All of the 35 states that allow the death penalty use lethal injections. At 
the appointed time, the inmate is strapped to a table. Witnesses, including 
relatives of the defendant, the victim’s family, and a few chosen members 
of the media, are often allowed to attend. The inmate is allowed to make a 
last statement, and then IVs are inserted into his arms. An executioner in 
a nearby room starts the IV drip of several drugs, including a sedative, a 
muscle relaxant, and a drug to stop the heart. The inmate loses consciousness 
quickly, usually in about ten seconds, but a pronouncement of death may 
take five or more minutes.
Arguments for or against 
the death penalty
As of 2007, roughly 64 percent of the U.S. population favored the death 
penalty, while 30 percent opposed it. Only 6 percent were undecided. Where 
you stand on this issue will likely shape how you read this section.
Arguments about the death penalty can roughly be categorized into two 
camps: philosophical arguments and utilitarian arguments.
Philosophical arguments
Opponents of the death penalty argue on philosophical grounds that the 
death penalty
 
✓ Is cruel and inhuman
 
✓ Desensitizes the population to violence
 
✓ Eliminates the chance for the murderer to be rehabilitated

323
 Chapter 21: Punishing the Guilty: Why and How Society Does It
 
✓ Creates secondary victims — the family members and friends of the 
murderer
 
✓ Discriminates on the basis of race (because 41 percent of the inmates 
on death row are black, while only 12 percent of the U.S. population is 
black)
Proponents of the death penalty counter that the death penalty
 
✓ Satisfies society’s need for retribution because a life for a life is a just 
sentence
 
✓ Helps a victim’s family achieve closure
 
✓ Follows the will of the majority, which is essential for the legitimacy of 
any government
Utilitarian arguments
Utilitarian arguments relate to whether the death penalty actually serves 
some purpose or not.
Proponents of the death penalty argue that by executing a murderer, society 
prevents that person from committing future crimes, including murder. When 
a person isn’t sentenced to death row, he becomes part of the prison’s general 
population, where there’s much greater opportunity for murdering someone 
else. Thus, the argument goes, by placing a person on death row, and by 
eventually executing him, the death penalty helps protect other inmates from 
him. It also eliminates the chance that the inmate may escape and commit 
other crimes.
I’m not aware of any study that has attempted to determine whether placing 
a person on death row helps save the lives of other inmates. It’s interesting 
to note, however, that murderers historically have had a very low recidivism 
rate when compared to other violent criminals. Back in the 1970s and 1980s 
when murderers received less than life sentences, many were eventually 
released and didn’t commit more crimes. Of course, capital murders are 
generally much more heinous than other murders, so it’s quite likely that 
such murderers would be more dangerous than regular murderers.
Many studies have focused on the deterrence effect of the death penalty. The 
argument used by many proponents of the death penalty goes that if a person 
is actually executed, other citizens, fearful of being executed themselves, decide 
not to commit murder. A 2003 study by Professors Hashem Dezhbakhsh, Paul 
Rubin, and Joanna Shepherd of Emory University concluded that the arrest, 
conviction, and execution of one murderer can deter between 8 and 28 future 
murders. Other studies have concluded that executions do deter future 
murders but that they do so at a lower rate of 3 to 6 murders per execution. 
These studies have shown that pardons or commutations actually lead to 
more murders and that the deterrent effect may be reduced by delays in 
executions.

324
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
It’s important to point out that other people hotly contest the methodology 
in these studies. In fact, opponents of the death penalty point to studies that 
show that in locations where the death penalty is imposed, there actually 
may be more murders. The argument is that by sanctioning killing (via the 
death penalty), the government creates a brutalizing effect or culture of 
violence among its citizens.
Another prominent argument against the death penalty contends that the 
death penalty is much more expensive than a life sentence. The additional 
costs include the extra security for housing a person on death row and 
paying lawyers, investigators, and court staff for all the additional appeals. 
Proponents of the death penalty counter that the lengthy appeals process 
can be shortened, reducing the costs.
Yet another argument against the death penalty is that innocent people can 
and have been put to death. This situation can occur because a jury may rely 
on faulty evidence or even because the defendant’s court-appointed lawyer is 
incompetent.
Proponents of the death penalty respond by saying that defendants who 
receive a death sentence get more appeals than people who get life sentences. 
Thus, the chances of wrongly convicted people being exonerated are greater 
for the defendants who received death sentences. Further, modern science 
with its sophisticated techniques, such as DNA testing, has all but eliminated 
false convictions. (Check out Chapter 18 to find out how and when DNA 
testing comes into play in solving crimes.)
I offer no opinions, and I bet your opinion didn’t change after reading this 
section, either, did it?

n 2007, more than 15 percent of all arrests reported to the FBI involved 
juveniles, or people under the age of 18. What should society do about 
kids who commit crimes (otherwise known as juvenile delinquents)?
In this chapter, I briefly discuss how juveniles have been treated in the 
criminal justice system historically. Then I move on to how the system deals 
with juvenile delinquents today and what the future may hold.
Taking a Look Back: The Historical 
Treatment of Juveniles
In the 1800s and before, juveniles above the age of 14 who committed crimes 
were generally treated as adults. Courts punished juveniles as adults, lodged 
them in prisons, and even executed a few of them. But in 1899, the officials of 
Cook County, Illinois, created the first juvenile court in the United States. The 
idea quickly caught on, and, within 26 years, 46 states had their own juvenile 
courts.
Why the sudden move to juvenile courts? Toward the end of the 1800s, more 
and more people started believing that children were less responsible for 
their conduct than adults and that they shouldn’t be treated as adults.

326
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
	
The first juvenile courts were much less formal than adult courts in that they 
allowed judges broader latitude to gather information about the children from 
a variety of sources and to be more creative in sentencing. In effect, these 
juvenile courts acted according to the principle of parens patriae (meaning 
“parent of the people”), which is a doctrine that allows the government to 
care for the people who are incapable of caring for themselves. This principle 
continues to underlie juvenile courts to this day.
In the 1960s, political pressure from the left developed to provide juveniles 
with greater procedural protections — similar to what adults receive in 
criminal court. From the right side of politics came greater pressure to show 
that the perceived lenient treatment that juveniles received in juvenile court 
was actually working. As a result, the juvenile justice systems nationwide 
became much more formalized.
The U.S. Supreme Court decision in In re Gault (1967) held that juveniles had 
the constitutional right to certain protections, including the following:
 
✓ Notification of the charges against them
 
✓ Right to confront witnesses
 
✓ Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate themselves
 
✓ Notice of, and the right to, court-appointed counsel
Later court decisions granted additional rights to juveniles, including the 
following:
 
✓ To be convicted, juveniles must be found responsible (juvenile courts 
don’t use the word guilty) beyond a reasonable doubt.
 
✓ Juveniles can’t be tried twice for the same offense (under the double-
jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution).
Within the last ten years — in part spurred by research into juvenile brain 
development — there has been a resurgence of interest in moving kids away 
from formalized, courtlike proceedings and into informal resolutions. I get 
into more on this debate in the next section.
Why Juveniles Are Treated Differently
How many stupid things did you do as a teenager? If you were a normal 
teenager, your answer is probably “a lot.” As scientists continue to make 
advances in brain imaging, they see more and more that the brains of 
adolescents are far from mature. Teenagers often exercise poor judgment 
because physiological changes are still taking place in their brains.

327
 Chapter 22: Examining the Juvenile Justice System
Dopamine is a chemical produced in the brain that helps create the sensation 
of pleasure. A 10-year-old boy’s brain produces dopamine when he skateboards, 
so he wants to skateboard more often. (Some illegal drugs dramatically 
increase the brain’s release of dopamine, creating a high.)
As kids grow older, their brains may produce less dopamine for certain 
activities, which means they may have to engage in more risky behaviors to 
get the same pleasure they got from acts they enjoyed in preadolescence. 
So as a boy nears the age of 16, he may have to do riskier tricks with his 
skateboard to get the same dopamine release he got from simply riding his 
skateboard when he was 10. So he goes to the park and slides his board 
dangerously down the hand railing on some steep, concrete steps.
In addition to the changing dopamine levels, the prefrontal cortex, which is in 
charge of reasoning and impulse control, continues to develop throughout 
adolescence. In fact, it’s the last part of the brain to mature. Often, it doesn’t 
finish developing until a person is about 25 (which probably explains why 
few 45-year-olds appeared in the Jackass movies).
About 45 percent of violent crime arrests and 60 percent of property crime 
arrests are of people under the age of 25. Clearly, these numbers are the 
result of young people’s faulty reasoning and lack of impulse control. Another 
factor that explains the extremely high rates of crime among juveniles is that, 
simply put, young people have more energy. Combine high energy with bad 
decisions and you get high crime rates.
Because of poor reasoning skills and a lack of impulse control, people under 
the age of 25 are also more likely to engage in drug and alcohol abuse, which, 
in turn, can negatively and permanently impact proper brain functioning, 
which can then lead to more crime in a vicious circle.
All this science confirms what most people knew all along: Kids don’t 
exercise judgment the same way that adults do. And, thus, the criminal 
justice system shouldn’t treat kids as being quite as responsible for their 
criminal conduct as adults.
	
Another significant reason why U.S. juvenile justice systems treat kids differently 
than adults is that they may be more treatable than adults because their brains 
aren’t fully developed yet. Not only does society hope that a 16-year-old burglar 
will mature out of his crimes, but it also hopes that education and treatment will 
work better on the teenager than it does on a 35-year-old burglar.
In fact, a series of studies from the 1990s showed that the best intervention 
programs reduced recidivism (the rate of crimes committed after people are 
released from custody) among the most serious delinquents by an average 
of 12 percent. Such programs include providing employment and behavior 
modification counseling. This reduction may not sound like much, but given 
that it refers to the most difficult kids to reach, it’s pretty significant.

For less serious delinquents, the most effective programs were the ones that 
were directly tailored to the individual juvenile and that focused on specific 
interpersonal skills and behaviors. For example, one-on-one counseling was 
successful for both serious and less serious delinquents. These studies 
support the idea that intervention and treatment can make a big difference 
with juveniles, which hasn’t necessarily been the case with adults.
Walking through the Juvenile 
Justice Process
The juvenile justice system is essentially divided into the following two parts:
 
✓ One side deals with the kids who commit crime (juvenile delinquents).
 
✓ The second side, called the juvenile dependency system, deals with bad 
parents.
Not surprisingly, you often see a lot of overlap between the two parts 
because delinquents frequently come from bad home environments.
The juvenile dependency system tries to help parents get their acts together, 
providing training and education in parenting skills, as well as drug treatment. 
Usually a child welfare agency provides the dependency services to families. 
If the situation gets bad enough, this agency may ask a court to take kids 
away from parents, temporarily or even permanently.
Here I focus on the first part of the juvenile justice system: the delinquency 
process. In many ways, this system is similar to the adult criminal justice 
system. However, it uses different language to sound less scary and to reflect 
that the justice system treats kids differently than it treats adults. Also, the 
outcomes and the punishment of a juvenile can be quite different from what 
an adult receives. In this section, I walk you through the steps of processing a 
juvenile delinquent.
Speaking the language of the 
juvenile justice system
Typically, juveniles aren’t convicted of crimes. In fact, they’re not convicted 
at all. Although different states may use slightly different language, generally 
they follow the terminology I set forth here. (For comparison, I include the 
corresponding language for adult criminal court.)

So instead of filing an indictment, the prosecutor files a petition against a 
juvenile. The juvenile isn’t charged with a crime; rather, in some states, the 
petition alleges that the “the petitioner committed acts which, if he were an 
adult, would constitute a crime.”
The juvenile doesn’t plead guilty but admits or denies the offense. If he denies 
the offense, the matter proceeds to an adjudication rather than a trial.
The juvenile isn’t found guilty. Rather, the judge finds that the petition is true 
or that the juvenile is responsible. (There’s no jury in juvenile court, so the 
judge makes all the decisions.) If the petition is found true, the juvenile is 
said to be within the jurisdiction of the court.
Finally, the juvenile isn’t sentenced. Rather, the judge proceeds to disposition, 
where the judge decides whether to punish the juvenile, order counseling, 
order other treatment, or prescribe some combination of these options.
Introducing the key players
More people and programs are involved in the juvenile justice system than in 
the adult system, so before I get into specifics about how the system works, I 
need to identify the following key roles:
 
✓ Juvenile department: The juvenile department employs juvenile 
counselors (also known as juvenile probation officers), who work closely 
with kids to get them back on a law-abiding track. These counselors are 
directly involved with the juveniles almost from the moment of their 
arrests. So, right from the beginning, you can see a significant difference 
from the adult system, where probation officers don’t get involved 
unless and until the defendant is convicted.

330
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
 
✓ Prosecutor: If a case is handled formally, a prosecutor usually files the 
petition and is responsible for proving the case in court (see the “Filing 
a petition — Or not” section for details on the difference between formal 
and informal cases). Prosecutors also plea bargain with the juveniles’ 
lawyers and make recommendations to the court at the time of disposition.
 
✓ Judge: In many jurisdictions, the juvenile judge oversees the operation 
of the juvenile department and its counselors — quite different from 
what a judge does in the adult system.
	
	Because juvenile law is such a specialized area, it makes sense to have 
judges focus on juvenile delinquency and dependency to the exclusion 
of any other cases, whether adult criminal or civil. Thus, juvenile judges 
are often in their own world. In fact, in many larger communities, juvenile 
courts aren’t even located in the county courthouse; instead, they’re 
part of separate juvenile justice facilities.
	
	Because juvenile judges can specialize, they can also play a much more 
significant role in the lives of juvenile offenders than judges in criminal 
court do for adults. Juvenile judges have a lot of discretion in fashioning 
individualized sentences for kids. They also have much more authority 
over juveniles and can bring them back to court frequently to check on 
their progress.
 
✓ Juvenile detention facility: Typically, a juvenile detention facility (sort 
of like a juvenile jail) houses kids as they wait to go to trial. Sometimes 
the local juvenile department runs this facility, and sometimes the 
state runs it. Juvenile detention workers are more than just corrections 
officers; they’re often responsible for assisting in treatment and even 
teaching basic lessons in life skills.
	
	If, at the adjudication, a juvenile is found responsible for a delinquent 
act, the judge may require him to spend some time in the local detention 
facility, in the same way an adult can be sentenced to a local jail.
 
✓ Private, nonprofit service providers: Nongovernmental operations 
run by private, nonprofit groups may also provide treatment services, 
intervention programs, or temporary shelters for kids who have 
nowhere to go. For example, a kid may have an addiction to marijuana. 
In turn, the local juvenile department may contract with a drug 
rehabilitation program to provide treatment services for the kid.
	
	Another important service of nonprofits is operating shelter programs. 
A shelter is a place to house juveniles who temporarily can’t go home. 
For example, a kid arrested for a minor offense may have just one parent 
who happens to be a heroin addict and who has gone to inpatient 
treatment. The kid has to go somewhere, so he may be temporarily 
placed in a dormlike shelter.
	
	Although these nonprofits are private, they usually contract with the 
juvenile department and are paid with government money.

331
 Chapter 22: Examining the Juvenile Justice System
 
✓ Child welfare agencies: Child welfare agencies deal with bad parents 
and try to protect kids from bad environments. Frequently, child welfare 
workers work very closely with juvenile counselors. After all, it doesn’t 
do much good to help a kid, only to send him back to his heroin-using 
mom. So, ideally, child welfare and juvenile departments work together 
to develop programs to help entire families. I discuss this subject more 
in the “Facing probation” section.
 
✓ Youth correctional facilities: If a judge finds that the juvenile committed 
a serious act, he may send the juvenile to a state-operated correctional 
facility, which is the equivalent of an adult prison. However, the focus 
of youth correctional facilities is on providing the juveniles with an 
education, as well as various programs to help them reenter society. (In 
contrast, the focus of an adult prison is often just keeping the criminals 
off the streets while they do time for their crime.)
Arresting and detaining a juvenile
Unlike adults, kids can be taken into custody for status offenses, as well as 
for crimes. A status offense isn’t a crime, but it’s still considered misconduct 
when committed by a juvenile. The two most common examples of status 
offenses are curfew violations and truancy. In most states, police generally 
return kids who commit status offenses to their parents instead of holding 
them in a juvenile detention facility. Of course, if the parents are on drugs or 
have gone AWOL, the police have to do something with the kids. Typically, 
the police, a juvenile counselor, or a judge places the kids in short-term 
arrangements with foster parents or in a juvenile shelter.
If a juvenile is arrested for a serious-enough crime (such as a crime of 
violence), he may be held in the juvenile detention facility. Within 48 hours, 
he must be brought before a judge for a detention hearing. The judge decides 
whether the police have enough evidence to continue to hold the juvenile 
and whether it’s in everyone’s interest to do so.
	
In deciding whether holding the juvenile is the best option, the judge 
considers the child’s history, whether there’s a place to send the child, the 
seriousness of the offense, and the risk to the victim, among other factors. 
The judge also applies one of the most important principles in the juvenile 
justice system — the least restrictive means analysis — to the case. There’s 
a very strong bias against holding kids in custody because it can be such a 
negative experience. (It’s important to note that after being caught once, most 
kids never reenter the juvenile justice system. So it makes sense to spare them 
from the negative impact of incarceration). Therefore the judge looks for the 
least restrictive way to make sure the juvenile doesn’t reoffend while waiting 
for his case to be resolved.
In most instances, when police arrest juveniles, they return them to their fam­
ilies rather than place them in detention. However, they’re not off the hook.

332
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
Filing a petition — Or not
Regardless of whether a juvenile is detained for a crime or returned to his 
family, the next step in the system is to determine whether his case should 
be resolved formally or informally. Formally means that the prosecutor files 
a petition alleging the criminal acts and the case ends up before a judge. 
Informally means the case doesn’t go to a judge. Instead, the kid’s juvenile 
counselor tries to resolve the matter without making it a big deal. Most 
first-time offenses and lower-level offenses are handled informally.
As an example of how the process works, consider this situation: A 16-year-old 
boy is walking down the middle of a country road, causing cars to swerve 
around him. A deputy sheriff sees this behavior, arrests the kid for the crime 
of disorderly conduct, and takes him to his parents’ house.
A juvenile counselor is assigned to the case and reviews the kid’s history. 
The counselor sees that the kid has never been arrested. Because it’s not a 
serious offense, she offers the kid the chance to treat the matter informally 
without going to a judge. If the boy admits that he did something wrong and 
agrees to perform some community service, the county juvenile department 
will wipe out any record of his acts.
But what if the deputy sheriff arrested the kid because he didn’t like the kid’s 
attitude, and the kid feels like he has been wrongly arrested? If he refuses to 
admit that he did anything wrong, the matter proceeds to formal adjudication. 
A prosecutor files a petition charging him with disorderly conduct, and the 
matter goes to a judge for an adjudication.
At the outset of a case, who makes the decision to treat a case formally or 
informally? It depends on the jurisdiction, but, generally, the best practice 
is a cooperative decision by both the prosecutor and the juvenile counselor. 
Often they have formal agreements that spell out how certain crimes are 
treated. For example, they may agree that violent felonies are always treated 
formally or that first-offense property crimes are always treated informally. 
Of course, if the kid isn’t willing to admit some responsibility, the matter will 
end in formal adjudication, regardless.
In some states, even after a petition is filed, the case may not be formally 
adjudicated. The court may offer a diversion program or some type of contract 
between the kid and the juvenile department. In this situation, if the child 
admits his conduct and complies with some court orders, such as doing 
community service and completing treatment, the court may dismiss the 
case. In addition, the prosecutor and the juvenile’s attorney may plea bargain 
and agree to an informal disposition.

333
 Chapter 22: Examining the Juvenile Justice System
Adjudicating a case
If a case is treated formally and the juvenile denies the petition, the case 
proceeds to an adjudication. This proceeding is pretty similar to an adult 
trial, except that the juvenile doesn’t have the right to have a jury decide 
his case. He is, however, entitled to a court-appointed lawyer, who gets to 
cross-examine the prosecutor’s witnesses and call witnesses on behalf of 
the juvenile. The prosecutor still has to prove the case beyond a reasonable 
doubt.
Just like in adult cases, juveniles may face allegations of numerous offenses, 
so the judge can find only part of a petition true. For example, a judge can 
find two allegations true (that a juvenile burglarized two homes) and, at 
the same time, find a third allegation untrue (that he sexually abused his 
6-year-old sister).
The juvenile can also appeal his case to an appellate court if he or his lawyer 
believes errors were made during the adjudication. (See Chapter 19 for a 
discussion of the appellate process.)
	
In the juvenile system, however, what really matters is whether any allegation 
is found true. If the judge finds an allegation true, the juvenile is subject to 
the jurisdiction of the court. In other words, the judge has authority over the 
juvenile; he can do almost anything he thinks is appropriate to help correct 
the juvenile’s delinquency. The hearing in which the judge decides what to do 
with the juvenile is called a disposition.
Proceeding to disposition
Juveniles aren’t sentenced. Rather, the judge decides how to deal with the 
juvenile at the disposition hearing. Judges rely heavily on the juvenile 
counselor at this stage to provide information on the juvenile’s education, 
family situation, prior delinquent acts, and impact of the offense on any 
victims. If the child welfare department is involved because of bad parenting, a 
social worker in charge of the case may also provide information to the judge. 
Of course, the prosecutor and the juvenile’s own attorney weigh in, too.
Here are some probation options that judges can order:
 
✓ Place the juvenile in custody in the local detention facility or the state 
youth correctional facility. This order usually isn’t a first option. Only 
after a kid has failed several times on probation is the judge likely to 
send him to a correctional facility.

334
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
 
✓ Obtain a mental health evaluation. This option may result in mental 
health treatment, a prescription for drugs, therapy for the juvenile, or 
even therapy for his entire family.
 
✓ Conduct a substance abuse evaluation. This order may result in 
mandatory drug testing, outpatient treatment, or inpatient treatment.
 
✓ Conduct a sex offender evaluation. Following this order, the judge may 
order treatment as appropriate.
 
✓ Conduct an education evaluation. Following this evaluation, a judge 
may order tutoring, placement in an alternative education school (which 
is a type of school for kids who struggle in a normal school environment), 
or special programs for learning disabilities.
 
✓ Place the juvenile in foster care, a shelter, or an orphanage. This 
option is possible when a bad family environment is a significant 
concern and the judge has jurisdiction over the parents as the result 
of a juvenile dependency case.
Facing probation
After disposition is completed, the hard work begins. The juvenile counselor 
works closely with the juvenile to carry out the judge’s probation order at 
disposition. The judge will likely bring the juvenile back for regular status 
checks. If the juvenile is failing probation, such as committing more crimes or 
not showing up for treatment, the judge will modify the plan.
Frequently, juvenile counselors face challenges in coordinating a kid’s probation 
with other governmental services that the kid or his family may be receiving.
For example, imagine that a 14-year-old boy who is persistently caught 
shoplifting and skipping school gets caught trying to set his neighbor’s house 
on fire. His dad and the dad’s live-in girlfriend are on disability and both sell 
methamphetamine for a living. The dad is on probation for a sex crime. The 
local prosecutor has brought an action to terminate the dad’s parental rights. 
The boy’s mom is in inpatient drug treatment. The boy’s 16-year-old brother 
has also been caught in numerous offenses.
In a complicated case like this one, several government officials have an 
interest in the family.
	
One of the recent trends in juvenile justice is finding ways to develop greater 
coordination among all the different government agencies to make sure services 
don’t overlap or conflict. The idea is to develop programs that engage entire 
families in reducing dysfunction and crime. As I’ve said before, providing a kid 
with a good intervention program and then returning him to a terrible home 
environment doesn’t do much good for anyone.

335
 Chapter 22: Examining the Juvenile Justice System
Treating a Juvenile like an Adult
As violent crime by juveniles skyrocketed through the 1980s and 1990s, 
states passed laws allowing adult treatment for juveniles who committed 
certain serious offenses. Adult treatment means that the juvenile is tried in 
adult court with a jury, and, if found guilty, the juvenile receives the same 
sentence of incarceration as an adult. Often for these serious offenses, the 
sentences are long periods of mandatory incarceration.
All 50 states have some provision for this situation. In many states, the 
juvenile court has the discretion to decide which juveniles should be treated 
as adults. In other states, though, the court has no discretion; if a juvenile 
commits a certain offense, he must be treated as an adult. To be waived to 
adult court, the juvenile must be of a minimum age, usually 14 (although 
some states allow a waiver at a younger age). Some offenses that can receive 
adult treatment are
 
✓ Murder
 
✓ Attempted murder
 
✓ Manslaughter
 
✓ Rape
 
✓ Serious assault
 
✓ Armed robbery
 
✓ Arson
 
✓ Kidnapping
If a juvenile is convicted as an adult, he isn’t ordinarily housed with other 
adults in prison. Rather, he is kept in a youth correctional facility until he 
reaches adulthood. Then, depending on the amount of time left on his 
sentence, he may be transferred to an adult prison.
I once tried a 17-year-old boy as an adult because he stabbed the boy he was 
babysitting 86 times and then set off down the street to find a girl to rape and 
murder. He was sentenced to life in prison after serving a period in a youth 
correctional facility.
There is one adult sentence that juveniles can’t receive: a death sentence. See 
Chapter 21 for a discussion of the death penalty.
Eyeing Modern Trends in Juvenile Justice
Treating whole families by coordinating various government services has 
become a point of emphasis for juvenile courts across the country. However, 
such efforts depend on strong judges. After all, only judges have the 
authority to bring together various probation officers, welfare workers, and 
others to work in a coordinated fashion. Some jurisdictions have systematized 
this coordination by creating family involvement teams that bring a variety of 
services to dysfunctional families.

336
Part V: Prosecuting and Punishing Crime 
With the significant advances in brain development research, many people in 
the juvenile justice business are also questioning mandatory adult sentences 
for juveniles since their brains aren’t fully developed until their mid-20s. 
One solution involves creating a second-look program, in which, after being 
convicted, a juvenile can be brought back to the judge for a sentence reduction 
if the juvenile is doing well on her education and treatment programs in 
custody.
Another significant issue facing juvenile justice systems across the country 
involves the use of detention space. The big question is, after arrest, which 
juveniles should be detained and which ones should be returned home or 
placed in shelters? Some facilities don’t have enough space and, thus, are 
forced to release juveniles who may be dangerous to society.
For other facilities, the decision whether or not to release a juvenile involves 
an assessment of the risk that the kid will reoffend. Juvenile officers and 
judges weigh this risk against the knowledge that the effects of incarceration 
on kids are bad. Increasingly, courts are using a scientific process (rather 
than intuition and instinct) to assess the risk and decide whether to detain a 
juvenile or return her to her home.

re you thinking about working in the field of criminal justice? Well, 
if you are, you’ve come to the right place! You can find all kinds of 
different jobs in this field. In this chapter, I give you the inside scoop on ten 
of the more important and interesting jobs to help you consider whether one 
of them is right for you.
Police Officer
Police officer is often the first job people think of when they’re considering 
careers in criminal justice. But this job definitely isn’t for everyone. And, if 
you think you know what the job is all about from watching TV cop shows, 
prepare to be disappointed.
To become a police officer, you must pass physical and psychological 
examinations. Many of the larger police departments also require at least a 
two-year degree from college. All departments require at least a high school 
diploma. After getting hired, but before starting on the job, most officers 
must go through a police academy that lasts an average length of 19 weeks. 
Police academies cover a variety of topics, including criminal law, police 
procedure, defensive tactics, firearms training, and EVOC training (emergency 
vehicle operator course). Then new trainees spend additional time on the 
street with training officers.

340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Where an officer works defines his job. For example, a deputy sheriff in a 
rural county may patrol hundreds of miles of remote highway. He may spend 
his time removing animal carcasses from the road and traveling several 
hours just to respond to a burglary call. In contrast, an officer in a large 
city may have daily contact with gang members and drug dealers. He may 
investigate shoplifting crimes from a department store and deal with mentally 
ill vagrants camped out in front of a nightclub.
The career path within a police department is quite broad. Some officers are 
happy to stay in patrol, enforcing traffic laws and responding to 9-1-1 calls, 
their whole careers. Others want to move up the ladder to become detectives 
or even chiefs of police. Lateral transfers by officers between departments 
are becoming more common. A department that hires a new recruit invests 
significant money in the training. (After all, the department pays an officer’s 
salary while he goes to the police academy.) As a result, larger departments 
may try to hire experienced officers from smaller departments because the 
training has already been paid for.
Generally, the larger the department, the better the potential salary. A 2003 
salary survey by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found that the average 
starting salary for the smallest police departments was $23,400, and the 
starting salary for larger departments averaged $37,700. Remember that a 
significant part of an officer’s income can come from working overtime. For 
instance, officers frequently get overtime from testifying in court. The more 
arrests or traffic tickets officers write, the more likely they are to be subpoenaed 
to court. For the best pay, a career with a federal agency can net you a salary 
over $100,000 near the end of your career. Numerous federal agencies have 
criminal special agents; see Chapter 17 for some of the more prominent ones.
Local officers who are beneath the rank of sergeant are usually part of a labor 
union that negotiates on their behalf. Toward the end of their careers, many 
cops enjoy a significant benefit: Most departments allow officers to retire at 
the age of 50 if they have 25 years of service. As a result, a good officer has 
plenty of time to start a second career, sometimes with a different police 
agency. I know of many older cops who are double dipping, so to speak. They 
draw pensions from their first jobs while earning salaries from their second 
jobs.
But before you sign up for these benefits, remember that being a cop is an 
increasingly difficult job. For one, it places tremendous strain on family life. 
To stay safe, cops are trained to always control the situation, which means 
assuming a commanding role with potential criminals. For some officers, 
turning off this attitude at home is difficult. Not surprisingly, a high percentage 
of cops I know have had at least one divorce. Officers also frequently have to 
work different shifts, which means they work nights for awhile, then switch to 
swing shift, and finally switch to day shift. This type of schedule can be very 
difficult on family life.

341
 Chapter 23: Ten Jobs to Consider in Criminal Justice
	
Cops are increasingly under intense scrutiny from the media and civil rights 
groups. Life-or-death, split-second decisions are subject to endless second-
guessing. Many departments hire civilian auditors who investigate allegations 
of misconduct in the public eye. If you have ever dealt with false allegations, 
you know how difficult they can be. Now imagine the investigation appearing 
in the local newspaper. With the expansion of the concept of community 
policing, the public increasingly calls on officers to be community dispute 
resolvers, a skill that few people — cops included — have in abundance.
It’s not surprising that police departments across the country can’t fill vacant 
positions. After all, the job has become more difficult, but the pay hasn’t 
increased along with the duties. If you think I’m trying to talk you out of 
applying to be a police officer, well, you may be right. It can be a great job 
for the right person, but you need to think long and hard about the sacrifices 
you’ll have to make.
Corrections Officer
A corrections officer works in a correction facility, typically a jail or a prison. 
Long ago, these officers were known as guards. But don’t call a corrections 
officer a guard today — the least you’ll get is a dirty look — because corrections 
officers may view it as demeaning.
Many (but not all) jurisdictions require corrections officers to attend some 
form of training academy. This training is much shorter and less burdensome 
than a police academy. In fact, many police officers start their criminal justice 
careers as corrections officers and then transfer after a few years.
Corrections officers can have a wide variety of duties, but, generally, they 
maintain order in a jail or prison. Corrections officers keep inmates on task, 
facilitate treatment and inmate work, and respond to security needs. The 
Florida Department of Corrections Web site (http://fldocjobs.com/
index.html) offers detailed descriptions of the different duties of a 
corrections officer. Check it out for more information.
Corrections officers usually are members of unions, but their pay is generally 
lower than that of police officers. They may also be less likely than police 
to get overtime because they work regular shifts and rarely have to attend 
court.
	
Being a corrections officer holds many challenges. For one, you work in an 
environment with convicted criminals. Frequently, corrections officers aren’t 
armed when they move among inmates because the inmates easily outnumber 
the officer and could take the weapon away. Consequently, corrections officers 
are at risk of attacks from inmates, which occur somewhat regularly, depending 

342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
on the dangerousness level of the facility. Maximum- and medium-security 
facilities are more likely to have violent, assaultive inmates compared to 
minimum-security facilities. Physical attacks, stabbings, and human waste 
bombs (feces or urine thrown at someone) aren’t uncommon. When a fight 
among inmates breaks out, corrections officers are on the front lines, as well, 
which can be quite dangerous, as you can probably imagine.
Working as a corrections officer in a prison or jail can be a hard job, but it 
can be a rewarding experience for the right person. Being a corrections 
officer is an excellent opportunity for a person with a high school degree to 
earn a decent wage and develop skills and a career.
Forensic Scientist
So you like to watch CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, and you think you have 
the model good looks it takes to solve murders in an hour. In truth, forensic 
scientists have a fascinating and very important job, but it’s nothing like what 
you see on TV.
	
The word forensic means “developed for court,” so a forensic scientist develops 
scientific evidence for court. Here are some of the key pieces of evidence a 
forensic scientist deals with on a daily basis:
 
✓ Toxicology: Identifying poisons and toxic substances at the crime scene 
can help scientists figure out what happened.
 
✓ Controlled substances: Scientists can use blood and urine analyses to 
find out whether defendants or victims were under the influence of any 
controlled substances.
 
✓ Trace evidence: Scientists analyze microscopic evidence for a variety of 
evidentiary reasons.
 
✓ DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which is contained in almost every 
cell in the human body, is unique for each human being (except identical 
twins) and has become a tremendous crime-solving tool.
 
✓ Fingerprints: Each person (except for identical twins again) has a 
unique pattern on the end of his fingers that can leave behind prints at 
crime scenes; fingerprints can help scientists identify the perpetrator.
 
✓ Firearms and ballistic analysis: Determining whether or not a bullet 
came from a specific gun can help scientists find a shooter.
 
✓ Blood pattern analysis: Scientists can draw conclusions about what 
happened at a crime scene based on how blood stains look.

343
 Chapter 23: Ten Jobs to Consider in Criminal Justice
Applying forensics expertise to investigating a crime scene can be quite 
interesting; see Chapter 18 for a more thorough discussion.
Positions in forensic science usually require a bachelor’s degree in a scientific 
field, such as microbiology or biochemistry. Some schools that have criminal 
justice programs also offer degrees in forensic science. People with these 
skills are in high demand, so the pay tends to be pretty good — $40,000 or 
more for a new graduate. But, contrary to what you see on TV, as a crime 
scene investigator, you probably can’t carry a gun (unless you’re also a 
certified police officer). Rather, job announcements usually say the physical 
requirements include “standing for prolonged periods.”
Check out the American Academy of Forensic Sciences Web site for more 
information about the profession, including a list of available employment: 
www.aafs.org.
Computer Forensic Specialist
Usually a police officer who has received specialized training in retrieving 
evidence from computers, cellphones, and other electronic gadgets without 
altering the data holds the position of computer forensic specialist. However, 
some agencies are moving toward using non-sworn personnel (which just 
means people who aren’t police officers). To become a computer forensic 
specialist, you must first receive certification from one of a few recog­
nized training programs, such as the two-week course developed by the 
International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists — known in 
the business as IACIS. After you receive your certification, you must continue 
to stay up on current computer evidence trends, which means frequent 
training. Thus, you may have to be just a little geeky to enjoy this work.
	
Keep in mind that with the proliferation in child pornography, computer 
forensic specialists have to look at some particularly disturbing evidence, 
including numerous images of children being sexually molested.
People with computer forensic skills are in high demand both within the 
criminal justice system and elsewhere. Civil law firms and corporate security 
companies are increasingly using people with these skills to gather evidence 
for lawsuits or to discipline or terminate employees who misuse their computers 
at work.
A degree in computer technology, or at least some computer course work 
combined with a criminal justice degree, may help pave the way for employment 
in this field. Salaries of computer forensic specialists are typically the same 
as for detectives in police departments.

Crime and Intelligence Analysts
Crime and intelligence analysts are becoming crucial to the fight against 
organized crime and terrorism. But before you can understand how important 
these analysts are, you have to understand the difference between the two:
 
✓ Crime analysts usually do statistical analysis of community crime problems. 
For example, they may map crime locations to find hot spots for a city, 
which allows police chiefs to redirect officers to high-crime areas. (I’ve 
also seen police departments use their crime analysts for not much 
more than basic statistical gathering.)
 
✓ Intelligence analysts take intelligence, which is basically raw information, 
and put it in a usable form for cops. For example, a gang unit may ask an 
intelligence analyst to find out what’s going on with a particular gang. 
The analyst may collect all the police reports that refer to that gang and 
try to identify all the members and their roles within the gang. Using 
that information, the intelligence analyst may create a link chart showing 
the relationship among all the gang members. This can help the police 
decide which gang members their investigation should focus on. This 
kind of work is the basis for the intelligence-led policing model I discuss 
in Chapter 16.
An analyst works closely with cops during ongoing investigations, suggesting 
whose phone records to subpoena or whom to conduct surveillance on. An 
analyst is absolutely crucial to any wiretap investigation.
Analysts are extremely important to the fight against terrorism, so the feds 
have recently been snapping up analysts across the country. Hence, today 
there appears to be a real shortage of qualified analysts. Because there are 
different levels of analysts, and because an analyst can work for a local, state, 
or federal government, the potential salary varies greatly. But a seasoned 
federal analyst can make over $100,000.
How do you become an analyst? Only a couple of schools in the United 
States offer programs in crime or intelligence analysis. If you don’t plan to 
seek a degree in criminal intelligence, you should speak to a detective in 
your state to find out which agencies employ analysts. Often, a few agencies 
employ most of a state’s analysts. After you identify those agencies, you can 
approach them specifically to find out about their hiring requirements.
The School of Criminal Justice at Michigan State University has an intel­
ligence program and a useful Web site that includes an excellent policy 
paper on the intelligence process by Professor David L. Carter. Check out 
https://intellprogram.msu.edu/Index.php for more info.

 Chapter 23: Ten Jobs to Consider in Criminal Justice
Probation Officer
A probation officer is a criminal justice professional with some law enforcement 
authority whose primary job is supervising convicted criminals (called 
probationers) whom a judge puts on probation. As I discuss in Chapter 21, a 
probation officer makes sure a probationer is complying with all the conditions 
that the judge imposed, such as
 
✓ Going to drug treatment
 
✓ Obeying all laws
 
✓ Staying away from victims
 
✓ Completing community service
A probation officer, usually called a P.O., also serves as a counselor for the 
convicted person, giving guidance on living a crime-free life. If a P.O. believes 
her client is doing something wrong, she can submit an allegation of a 
probation violation to the judge. The P.O. then has to testify about the 
violation. P.O.’s have a lot of direct contact with convicted people, which 
often means they have to deal with antisocial and mentally ill folks. Even 
so, the job can be a rewarding one because, as a P.O., you can have a lot of 
influence over your probationer.
In the way of career progression, you won’t find much — other than 
managing other probation officers. Usually, probation officers work for a 
local government, but federal courts and some state agencies also employ 
P.O.’s. A federal P.O. position usually requires a bachelor’s degree and two 
years of experience, but the salary is good, ranging from about $40,000 to 
$75,000. (In contrast, at the state level in Indiana, for example, a local P.O. 
starts at about $27,000 and tops out at around $51,000.)
Juvenile Counselor
In most jurisdictions, a juvenile counselor is basically a hybrid of a corrections 
officer, a probation officer, and a treatment counselor — except that he only 
works with kids. Juveniles, like adults, commit crimes and sometimes need 
to be locked up. (By juveniles, I mean kids ages 13 to 18, typically.) But the 
justice system treats kids who commit crimes a lot differently than it treats 
adults. Although juvenile counselors are responsible for the safety and 
security of kids who are locked up in juvenile detention centers, they also 
have a much greater responsibility for providing treatment and teaching 
behaviors that hopefully will help the kids get along in society.

346
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
In terms of security, juvenile counselors have to search kids for contraband 
and impose discipline when a kid violates rules. Counselors also may develop 
and supervise work and study programs, as well as recreational activities. 
They work directly with kids to correct antisocial behavior and teach skills 
that help kids get by in society. Often this part of the job includes teaching 
basic life skills like hygiene and housekeeping. Counselors may have to lead 
group counseling sessions in which a bunch of kids talk about their issues 
on a specific topic. In addition, juvenile counselors frequently must deal with 
kids who suffer from mental illness or severe personality disorders.
This job is extremely challenging, but it also carries the potential for chang­
ing lives. To do this job well, you must have a thick skin and a compassionate 
heart. (This descriptor seems to apply to most of the jobs I present in this 
chapter.) Some of the people I admire most work in juvenile corrections.
Qualifications for this job depend on the jurisdiction. In many states, you 
need a bachelor’s degree in a field such as social work, psychology, or 
criminal justice. But other jurisdictions provide entry-level jobs in which you 
can get a start with an associate’s degree.
Regarding career development, a juvenile counselor can move up within an 
administration and supervise other counselors and even oversee an entire 
facility.
Crime Victim Advocate
As I discuss in Chapter 4, a crime victim advocate has to have a real heart for 
people who have been victimized by crime. Most victim advocates tend to 
be women because most crime victims who need services are also women. 
A victim advocate may help a woman who has been beaten by her husband 
obtain counseling or temporary shelter for her family in a safe place. The 
victim advocate may help someone get funds to help pay for medical costs or 
lost wages that resulted from a crime. The job requires not only compassion 
but also a thick skin to continue to provide empathy, as well as valuable 
services, over the long haul.
An associate’s degree or bachelor’s degree in social services or a related field 
can be a big help in landing a job in this field. However, you can gain valuable 
experience as a volunteer or as a lower-paid employee of a nonprofit agency 
that provides services, such as a domestic violence shelter, to victims. 
Developing skills in dealing with victims of domestic violence, rape, child 
abuse, or other violent crimes can help you get a better-paying advocate job 
without getting a college degree.

347
 Chapter 23: Ten Jobs to Consider in Criminal Justice
Legal or Law Enforcement Secretary
Defense attorneys, judges, prosecutors, and detectives all need skilled 
clerical staff to prepare documents, keep calendars, and do the thousands 
of daily tasks that help keep any office running. These clerical workers are 
called legal secretaries, and they can make up to $80,000 a year in a large civil 
law firm. In government service, however, the pay is much less.
I’ve seen secretaries in private law firms who come very close to practicing 
law because the lawyers they work for rely on them so heavily. Judges need 
secretaries for the same reasons as regular lawyers. And detectives need 
people to type up police reports and do other necessary tasks, such as 
organize evidence, manage schedules and travel arrangements, and otherwise 
keep the detectives out of trouble.
Numerous technical colleges across the United States specialize in legal 
secretary work. Another way to get into the field is by taking a lower-paying 
word-processing job in a law enforcement agency. Because there’s always 
a demand for quality legal secretaries, if you distinguish yourself, you can 
quickly move up to a legal secretary position.
Sometimes good legal secretaries develop such an interest in the law that 
they move into the job of paralegal, which is a position that can pay more 
and that has more responsibility for quasi-legal work.
Court Reporter
Traditionally, a court reporter sat in a courtroom and typed out the statements 
of all the parties via a stenotype machine. But many courtrooms today use 
digital recording to record statements. In these circumstances, court 
reporters often operate the equipment, monitor the recordings, and take 
notes to help identify the speakers. And, frequently, the court reporter has 
to create a transcript of the event. For example, after a case is concluded, 
an appeal typically follows, and the appellate lawyers and judges need a 
transcribed written document to reflect the testimony in the case.
Court reporters also play important roles in civil cases for depositions 
(out-of-court hearings in which lawyers question witnesses). Thus, court 
reporters typically work for one of two types of employers: a local, state, or 
federal court or a private court-reporting business.

348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
A number of schools provide training in the use of stenotype machines and 
other skills related to court reporting, and some states may actually require 
you to become certified to perform court-reporting duties. The following 
organizations provide certification:
 
✓ The National Court Reporters Association
 
✓ The United States Court Reporters Association
 
✓ The American Association of Electronic Reporters and Transcribers
The salaries of court reporters are often consistent with those of good 
private-firm legal secretaries. For example, the median salary in 2006 was 
around $45,000.

▶ Investigating some infamous murders
▶ Trying to unmask a few mysterious serial killers
▶ Searching for a couple of famous missing persons
C

hances are you’ve heard of all, or at least most, of the cases I talk 
about in this chapter. Be honest: Just about everyone is fascinated by 
unsolved crimes like these famous ones. I bet more than a few detectives out 
there think they know who the bad guys are, but, to date, no one can say with 
complete certainty who dunnit.
The JonBenet Ramsey Murder
In 1996, the murder of child beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey developed into 
a national media obsession. On the day after Christmas in Boulder, Colorado, 
Patsy Ramsey discovered that her 6-year-old daughter was missing. The 
Ramsey family found a ransom note demanding $118,000 for JonBenet’s 
return on their staircase. The dollar figure was the exact amount that 
JonBenet’s father had received as a bonus the year before. The note said 
not to call anyone, but Patsy Ramsey didn’t listen; she called family, friends, 
and the Boulder Police Department. John Ramsey, JonBenet’s father, made 
arrangements to pay the ransom, but during a search of his basement, police 
and John Ramsey found JonBenet’s body, covered with a white blanket, in the 
wine cellar.
An autopsy revealed that JonBenet’s skull suffered severe blunt trauma and 
that she was also strangled. A tweed cord and the broken handle of a paint 
brush were used in the strangulation. Part of the paint brush was later found 
in Patsy Ramsey’s art supplies.
According to the autopsy, JonBenet had eaten pineapple just hours before 
her death, and a photograph taken the day of her disappearance showed 
a pineapple in the kitchen with a spoon in it. However, neither parent 
remembered feeding pineapple to JonBenet.

350
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Police found no sign of forced entry in the Ramsey house, but a broken 
basement window was unsecured. A blood sample found on JonBenet’s 
underwear proved to be a mixed sample — from at least two different people. 
A DNA test done in 2003 revealed that some of the blood came from an 
unknown male.
In 2006, a 41-year-old man from Alabama, who was being held on child 
pornography charges in California, confessed to murdering JonBenet. 
However, when his DNA didn’t match the sample found in the blood on 
JonBenet’s underwear, police decided not to charge him. After all, no 
evidence placed him in Boulder at the time of the murder.
In 2008, the local district attorney announced that new DNA testing had 
established that the blood found didn’t match any of JonBenet’s family 
members.
Patsy Ramsey died of cancer in 2006 and was buried next to her daughter in 
Georgia.
To this day, no one knows who murdered JonBenet Ramsey.
The Sam Sheppard Case
Supposedly the inspiration for the 1993 movie The Fugitive (although the 
movie’s creators denied any connection), the Sam Sheppard case was the 
1954 equivalent of the O. J. Simpson murder trial in terms of national media 
attention. Dr. Sam Sheppard was accused of murdering his wife in the early 
morning of July 4, 1954. Sheppard claimed that a bushy-haired man knocked 
him unconscious and killed his wife. The murder, which occurred in a suburb 
of Cleveland, Ohio, came to trial in the fall of 1954.
During the trial, prosecutors revealed that Sheppard had had a three-year 
affair with a nurse, a fact that the prosecution asserted was his motive for 
killing his wife. Sheppard testified in his own defense, saying that he was 
sleeping downstairs when he awoke to his wife’s screams. He ran upstairs, 
where a bushy-haired man attacked him and knocked him out. Evidence 
presented at the trial showed that Sheppard had broken teeth and cuts on 
his neck, which, according to the defense, proved he was assaulted. 
Sheppard said he woke up and chased the bushy-haired man outside, only 
to be knocked out again. Witnesses testified that they saw a bushy-haired 
man in the vicinity of the Sheppard house on the day of the murder.

351
 Chapter 24: Ten Notorious, Unsolved Crimes
Sheppard was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in 
prison. Shortly thereafter, his mother committed suicide and his father died 
of cancer. After Sheppard spent ten years in prison, the U.S. Supreme Court 
ordered a new trial, noting that the original trial took place in a “carnival 
atmosphere” and that the judge had failed to sequester the jury and instruct 
them not to watch TV or read newspaper stories about the case.
Three days after his release from prison, Sheppard married a woman he had 
been corresponding with from prison.
Sheppard was retried in 1966 and was represented by famed defense lawyer 
F. Lee Bailey (who was later part of O. J. Simpson’s “dream team”). Sheppard 
didn’t testify at his second trial, and the jury acquitted him.
Sheppard later wrote a book called Endure and Conquer, returned briefly to 
the practice of medicine, and even did a stint as a professional wrestler under 
the name of “the killer.” Sheppard died in 1970 of liver failure. Just six months 
before his death, he married his wrestling partner’s 20-year-old daughter. His 
first wife’s murderer was never found.
The Zodiac Killer
A serial killer known as “the Zodiac” terrorized northern California in 1968 
and 1969 but was never identified. The killer gave himself this name in letters 
he wrote to the media. In his letters, the Zodiac killer claimed to have killed 
more than 37 people, but, to date, only 7 victims have been identified as 
being his (and 2 of them survived to tell their stories).
After murdering two people in December 1968 and then murdering another 
and injuring a fourth in July 1969, the Zodiac killer called the Vallejo Police 
Department and took credit for both attacks. After that call, three newspapers 
received letters in which the Zodiac killer took credit for the murders. Each 
letter contained one-third of a 408-symbol code that supposedly revealed his 
identity. The killer demanded that each letter be printed in the newspapers 
or else he would drive around and kill other people. The newspapers eventually 
published the letters. The killer sent a fourth letter, in which he identified 
himself as “the Zodiac” for the first time, to the San Francisco Examiner in 
August 1969. The next day, a husband and wife team cracked the 408-symbol 
code (apparently for fun), but, unfortunately, it didn’t reveal the killer’s name.

352
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
In September 1969, the Zodiac killer approached a couple who was picnicking 
at Lake Berryessa. He wore a black executioner-style hood and a white bib 
that depicted a circle with a cross in the middle. After tying up both victims, 
he attacked them with a knife. The killer left after writing the circle and cross 
symbol, as well as the dates of the prior murders, on the couple’s car. (See 
Figure 24-1)
	
Figure 24-1: 
The 
symbol of 
the Zodiac 
killer.
	
Twenty-seven miles from the scene, the Zodiac killer called the Napa sheriff’s 
office from a pay phone to report the murders. He left the phone off the hook, 
and when police arrived at the scene, they found both victims still alive, 
although one eventually lapsed into a coma and died. The police were able 
to lift a palm print, but, unfortunately, the print never helped prove anything. 
One of the victims was able to give a detailed description of what happened, 
but that description didn’t get the police anywhere, either.
In October 1969, the Zodiac killer killed a cab driver in San Francisco. In 
November, he mailed a 340-character code to the media. To date, this code 
still hasn’t been cracked. Another attack, consisting of a kidnapping and 
eventual escape by the victim, may have occurred in Modesto in 1970, but 
the victim’s inconsistent story led many people to question its truthfulness.
The Zodiac killer (or crackpots pretending to be the Zodiac killer) continued 
to send letters to the media through 1974, taking credit for previously 
committed murders in Southern California. Even after 1974, some letters 
continued to come, bearing resemblances to the Zodiac killer’s handwriting, 
but police couldn’t confirm the authorship. To date, the identity of the Zodiac 
killer has never been discovered, although every few years, someone claims 
to have finally determined the Zodiac’s identity.

The Murder of Robert Blake’s Wife
Robert Blake was a child actor in some of the Our Gang short movies from 
1939 to 1944; he also starred as a murderer in the 1967 movie In Cold Blood 
and won an Emmy for his TV series Baretta. In 2000, Blake married his second 
wife, 44-year-old Bonnie Bakley, who had been dating Christian Brando, the 
son of Marlon Brando, at the same time. When she became pregnant, she told 
both Blake and Brando that they were the father. Blake eventually married 
Bakley after DNA tests confirmed that he was, indeed, the father. Her marriage 
to Blake was Bakley’s tenth marriage.
On May 4, 2001, Blake took Bakley to an Italian restaurant in Southern 
California. After dinner, while she was sitting in their car parked on a side 
street, she was shot in the back of the head and died. Blake told police that, 
at the time of the shooting, he was returning to the restaurant to retrieve 
his gun, which he had left there. No restaurant employees recall seeing him 
return.
Blake was arrested a year later when two stuntmen came forward and said 
that Blake had tried to hire them to kill his wife. In 2005, a jury acquitted 
Blake of murder. The district attorney reportedly called the jurors “incredibly 
stupid.”
In a civil suit filed by Bakley’s children, Blake was later found liable for 
Bakley’s death and was ultimately ordered to pay $15 million. Blake declared 
bankruptcy.
The Murder of Seattle Prosecutor 
Tom Wales
On October 11, 2001, in the fashionable Queen Anne Hill District of Seattle, 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom Wales was gunned down in his home. An 
18-year veteran prosecutor of white-collar crimes, Wales was also active in a 
Washington gun-control organization known as Washington CeaseFire. He had 
actively supported a state law to require trigger locks on guns, although the 
law ultimately went down in defeat.

354
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
At about 10 p.m., Wales was working on his computer and checking e-mails — 
his nightly habit — when a shooter fired at least three shots through Wales’s 
basement window. An elderly woman next door heard the shots and called 
9-1-1. A neighbor saw a lone gunman walk quickly away from the scene and 
get into a car parked underneath a tree. At the time of the murder, Wales’s 
ex-wife and son were in Europe.
An investigator associated with the case said that Wales’s murder was close 
to being the perfect murder. The shell casings and the bullets were the only 
physical evidence police recovered at the scene. From this evidence, the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was able to determine that the killer 
used a .380 Makarov pistol with an after-market barrel. More than 2,000 of 
those barrels had been sold, and the FBI attempted to track down the owner 
of each one.
Originally, the FBI focused on possible gun-rights activists. However, over 
time, the focus shifted to a man whom Wales had prosecuted previously. 
Wales had indicted a commercial airline pilot accused of falsifying documents 
related to a helicopter business. Wales ultimately had to dismiss charges 
when the government’s expert witness changed his testimony. The pilot filed 
a suit seeking over $100,000 in attorney costs, but the suit was dismissed. 
The pilot wasn’t known to own a Makarov pistol, but he had been known to 
fire a handgun into the ground at his home. On the night of the murder, the 
pilot attended a movie with a friend near Wales’s home and then made a 
phone call from his own home 20 minutes after the murder. Investigators 
concluded that the timeline would’ve been fairly tight to commit the murder 
but that the pilot could’ve left the theater, gone to Wales’s home, fired the 
shots, and returned to his home to make his phone call.
In 2006, when the story had begun to lose public interest, someone sent a 
letter to the Seattle Times. The letter was from an unemployed man who 
claimed to have been hired by a woman to kill Wales. The letter recounted a 
number of accurate facts, but each one centered around information that 
had already been released to the public about the murder. An investigator 
associated with the case said he didn’t think the letter was authentic.
The FBI continues to offer a $1 million reward for information that leads to an 
arrest and conviction of the person responsible.
The D. B. Cooper Hijacking
The day before Thanksgiving in 1971, a man going by the name of Dan Cooper 
and wearing a dark suit and tie got on a Northwest Orient flight going from 
Portland, Oregon, to Seattle, Washington.

355
 Chapter 24: Ten Notorious, Unsolved Crimes
After the flight had taken off, Cooper slipped a note to a stewardess (they 
called flight attendants stewardesses in those days). She thought he was 
giving her his phone number, so she slipped the note into her pocket. Cooper 
leaned over and told her that she should look at the note because he had a 
bomb. The note demanded $200,000 in unmarked $20 bills and four parachutes 
when they landed in Seattle.
The plane circled over Puget Sound while the FBI gathered together the 
money and parachutes that Cooper had requested. While waiting, Cooper 
drank bourbon and soda.
Eventually, the FBI notified the flight crew that the money was ready, and the 
plane landed in Seattle. Most of the bills given to Cooper were printed in 1969 
and began with the serial letter L. The FBI recorded all the serial numbers. 
After the money and parachutes were delivered to the plane in a remote 
location on the tarmac, Cooper released the 36 passengers and one of the 
flight attendants, keeping the pilot and three other crew members onboard.
After the plane was refueled, it took off again and Cooper ordered the crew 
to fly to Mexico City at a very low altitude of 10,000 feet with the landing gear 
down. Cooper and the crew discussed the destination, and, after concluding 
that they couldn’t get to Mexico, they decided on Reno, Nevada, instead. 
Cooper ordered the pilot to keep the plane unpressurized. After the entire 
crew was in the cockpit, Cooper opened a door and jumped — that was the 
last time he was ever seen.
At the time Cooper jumped, the plane was flying through a heavy rainstorm 
over southwest Washington. As a result, the U.S. Air Force jet that was following 
the hijacked airliner couldn’t see Cooper when he jumped. Searches of the 
projected landing area by hundreds of police and U.S. Army troops revealed 
no evidence of Cooper.
Soon thereafter, the FBI interviewed a man in Portland named D. B. Cooper. A 
media miscommunication led to the name D. B. Cooper becoming the name 
the hijacker was known by.
In 1973, the Oregon Journal newspaper began publishing the serial numbers 
of all the $20 bills, offering a reward of $1,000 to the first person who brought 
forth a bill. The goal was to try to trace the money back to the hijacker. 
Despite intense national interest, no bill was found until 1980. An 8-year-old boy 
found $5,880 in $20 bills near the Columbia River on the Oregon-Washington 
border. The money proved to be part of the ransom given to Cooper. The boy 
was allowed to keep half the money.

356
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The FBI ultimately concluded that Cooper probably didn’t survive his jump, 
reasoning that he certainly wouldn’t have left behind that much money. In 
2007, the FBI revealed that it had accidentally given Cooper a “dummy” chute 
that was inoperable, along with the two operable chutes. That chute wasn’t 
left behind on the plane and may have been the one he strapped to his back 
and jumped with.
Nonetheless, a number of suspects sprang up in later years, including a 
copycat hijacker who hijacked a plane and asked for $500,000. This man, 
Richard McCoy, Jr., was arrested and convicted, escaped from prison, and 
then died in a shootout with police.
The Black Dahlia Murder
In 1947, a young woman from Massachusetts named Elizabeth Short, who 
had lived a rather ordinary life, was murdered in Los Angeles in a gruesome 
attack in which her body was cut in half and drained of blood. Each cheek 
was slashed from mouth to ear, and she was left with her hands over her 
head. The media most likely nicknamed Short the “Black Dahlia” after her 
murder because she wasn’t known by that name during her lifetime.
Hundreds of police participated in the largest investigation Los Angeles 
had seen in 20 years. Police treated everyone who knew Short as a possible 
suspect. Because of the intense media coverage, more than 50 people 
confessed to the murder.
Some people believed that the murder was related to other gruesome killings 
around the country, including some in Cleveland and Chicago. Despite the 
intense interest, however, no serious suspect was ever identified.
The Jack the Ripper Killings
In 1888, in a poor region of London, England, a serial killer brought terror to 
the city over the course of at least three years. He not only killed prostitutes, 
but also gruesomely mutilated their bodies and cut out their organs.
Hundreds of letters from the purported killer were sent to police and 
newspapers, including one that came with a human kidney. Police considered 
most of the letters to be fraudulent. However, police treated one letter that 
contained a promise to “clip the lady’s ears off” more seriously when, three 
days after they received it, a murder victim was found with her ear partially 
cut off. This note identified the killer as Jack the Ripper. Police published the 
letter, hoping someone would recognize the handwriting, but no one ever did.

357
 Chapter 24: Ten Notorious, Unsolved Crimes
In response to the police’s failure to capture the murderer, a vigilante group 
known as the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee formed. It patrolled the 
streets looking for the killer and petitioned the government to raise the 
reward.
After two brutal murders, a bloodstained piece of clothing belonging to one 
of the victims was found in a tenement stairwell. Near the clothing was a 
chalk writing that read, “The Jewes are the men that will not be blamed for 
nothing.”
Religious tensions were very high at the time, and some people believed this 
note was an attempt by Jack the Ripper to create greater tension and start a 
riot. Others theorized that the chalk writing had no relation to the bloodstained 
clothes and that their proximity was just an accident. A third theory is that 
Jack the Ripper himself was sending an anti-Semitic message.
Although he wasn’t the first serial killer in London, Jack the Ripper was the 
first one to kill after newspapers became widely read throughout the country. 
As a result, Jack the Ripper caused terror throughout England.
The Disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa
On July 30, 1975, Jimmy Hoffa, the former president of the International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters, a large labor union known to have ties to organized 
crime, disappeared — never to be seen again.
Hoffa became president of the Teamsters in 1957. In 1964, he was convicted 
of attempting to bribe a grand juror and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. 
In 1971, President Nixon commuted his sentence with the agreement that 
Hoffa would stay out of unions for ten years. When he disappeared, Hoffa 
was planning a lawsuit that may have put him in position to reassume his 
authority of the Teamsters. He was last seen in the parking lot of a restaurant 
in a Detroit suburb.
In 2004, the public learned that a man had previously claimed to have killed 
Hoffa while serving as a hit man for the mafia. The man identified a house 
in Detroit where he supposedly drove Hoffa and killed him. However, DNA 
testing of male blood found in the house showed that the blood wasn’t 
Hoffa’s.
When I was in college, my school’s football team played a game in Giants 
Stadium in New Jersey, where many people believed that Hoffa had been 
buried in cement in one endzone. However, during an episode of the TV show 
MythBusters, testing with underground sonic technology disproved this belief 
(to my disappointment).

358
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
In the last ten years, numerous people have claimed to know something 
about the disappearance of Hoffa, whom many believed was deeply associated 
with Italian organized crime. However, to date, his body has never been 
recovered, and the circumstances of his death have never been confirmed.
His son is now president of the Teamsters.
The Murders of Tupac Shakur and 
Notorious B.I.G.
Gangsta rap is closely associated with violence, at least in its lyrics and 
themes. But its true nature came to life on March 9, 1997, when Notorious 
B.I.G., also known as Biggie Smalls — and by his mother as Christopher 
George Latore Wallace — was gunned down in a drive-by shooting in Los 
Angeles.
Wallace was born in New York and grew up among drug dealers. His debut 
rap album, Ready to Die, placed him in the center of the East Coast hip hop 
scene, which, at the time, was in the midst of a feud with West Coast rappers.
Wallace had been in a dispute with famed West Coast rapper Tupac Shakur. 
Shakur, a former rapping associate of Wallace, accused Wallace of being 
involved in a 1994 robbery during which Shakur was shot several times.
In 1995, Shakur joined Death Row Records — a West Coast–based production 
company that was a direct competitor of East Coast rappers.
In 1996, Shakur released a song called “Hit ’em up” in which he claimed 
to have had sex with Wallace’s wife. Thereafter, an intense rivalry ensued 
between Shakur and Wallace. On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot 
multiple times in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas. He died six days later. 
Wallace denied involvement and claimed to be in New York at the time.
Six months later, while Wallace was stopped at a red light, a Chevy Impala 
pulled up, and an African American male dressed in a blue suit with a bow 
tie pulled out a 9mm handgun and filled the rapper’s car with bullets. The 
shooter hit Wallace four times, and he died almost immediately. A double 
album was released 15 days after his death, and it became number one on the 
album charts.
To date, neither murder has been solved.
