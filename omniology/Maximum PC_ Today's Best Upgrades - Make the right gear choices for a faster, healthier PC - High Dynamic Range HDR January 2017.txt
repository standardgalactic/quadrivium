editorial
a thing or two about a thing or two
It’s the new year, and there’s no better 
way to celebrate than to upgrade your 
PC—at least, that’s how tradition runs in 
my house. With the holiday season over, 
a lot of online retailers tend to put out 
some good deals, since sales are slower, 
and the market is ripe for bargains.
Of course, there’s the option of buying 
a completely new system, but if you have 
a decent rig already, an upgrade or two 
might transform your old 2016 pedaler 
into a modern 2017 model. There are 
several ways to pump some new life into 
an aging system. A year in the tech world 
is a long time—things go by quickly!
For me, it’s time to ditch my spinning 
disks for a solid-state system. This 
means getting rid of all hard drives and 
replacing them with much faster SSDs. 
You do lose some capacity, but terabyte 
SSDs are coming down in price. If you can 
store all your data on a 1TB or 2TB SSD, 
it’s worth eating ramen for a while.
In 2016, 16GB of memory seemed like 
the de facto standard. But I feel 16GB is a 
bit cramped; 32GB is the sweet spot in my 
opinion. If you’re still hanging on to 16GB, 
now’s the time to get a new kit. But here’s 
a pro tip: Just adding additional DIMMs 
isn’t the best way to go. Instead, it’s 
better to remove the old sticks and buy 
a completely new kit in the capacity that 
you want. This is because manufacturers 
bin kits, meaning individual sticks are 
selected for a match, and sold as a kit. 
Buying another kit later on, even if it’s 
from the same model set and  same 
manufacturer, may end up causing 
issues. It’s rare, but it does happen.
Depending on what you’re upgrading, 
things can go smoothly, or they can go 
horribly wrong. If they do go wrong, you’ll 
want to be prepared with a Windows 
recovery disc. Moving to a completely 
different motherboard and CPU can 
lead to driver hell, and in some cases, 
prevent you from booting. This happens 
often when you decide to transplant your 
primary boot drive into a new system 
altogether. Granted, Windows is getting 
better at detecting new hardware, but it’s 
always better to be safe than sorry!
With internal upgrades, the best way to 
see an immediate positive change is with 
an SSD. But on the outside, upgrading 
your display will yield an improvement 
you will appreciate for a long time.
I predict that 2017 will be the year of 
HDR (high dynamic range) displays. HDR 
screens display a greater range of colors, 
as well as brightness levels, enabling you 
to see more detail in an image that would 
otherwise appear blown or washed out. 
At the time of writing, HDR has only 
made it into high-end HDTVs, but display 
manufacturers are gearing up for full 
HDR displays. I know it’s coming, as 
my GTX 1080 fully supports HDR. The 
difference in image quality is substantial, 
and I can’t wait for a 4K HDR display.
I can still remember my 13-inch 
monochrome CRT display back in the 
day. Damn—I feel old.
It’s time to Bring 
in the new year 
and the upgrades!

Microsoft reveals its next Windows 10 update, cheap 
VR, and the super-sexy Surface Studio
Surface Studio  
Launched
the pen, you can draw on it like 
a proper old-school artist. It’s 
smart enough to let you rest 
you arm or palm on the screen 
without 
getting 
confused. 
There’s also a neat radial 
controller: the Surface Dial. You 
can drop this anywhere on to 
the screen, and use it to change 
settings without changing the 
primary focus, picking a brush 
type, for example. The Surface 
Studio is due to arrive early 
2017, and prices range from 
$2,999 to $4,199. It does look 
pretty good, and gives Apple’s 
iMac something to ponder on.
A new Surface Book has also 
arrived—the core components 
have been given a boost in 
raw  power, and now sport a 
Skylake Core i7 and Nvidia 
GTX 965M. Prices start at a not 
inconsiderable $2,399.
The event also gave us more 
details for the next Windows 
10 update, which is due spring 
2017. It has been dubbed the 
Creators Update, and is all 
about 
mixed 
media—there 
was a lot of  talk about the 
integration of 3D. Capture 3D 
enables you to use a camera to 
scan an object and build a 3D 
model, which you can drop into 
Paint 3D to edit, share on a new 
community site, or even drop 
into Office, if you really must.
PC and Xbox One gaming 
are brought closer together 
with game streaming built in, 
and an expansion of Xbox Live’s 
Arena. For those unable to keep 
anything to themselves, we get 
My People, which puts your top 
contacts in a sidebar, ready to 
have things dropped directly 
on to them. There is a host of 
other small changes as well, 
some most welcome, such as 
the ability to select your own 
accent color.
Finally, we come to VR, 
support for which is included 
in the Windows update. The 
exact hardware details are 
a little sparse, but we have 
been promised headsets from 
HP, Lenovo, Asus, Acer, and 
Dell next spring, with prices 
starting from as little as $300. 
Microsoft claims that these 
are the only headsets with 
six degrees of freedom in the 
headset, so they don’t require 
external help to track your 
head position, which helps 
to keep the cost down. There 
was also a demonstration of 
the augmented reality headset 
HoloLens, which is still not 
ready for general consumption, 
yet still looking promising.
All in all, it was a good 
day to be a Microsoft PR 
representative. The company is 
starting to look cool again. –CL
Every year, Microsoft holds an 
“event” in New York, and talks 
up the hardware and software 
you’ll be seeing soon. The star 
of this year’s show was the 
luscious Surface Studio, a high-
end desktop all-in-one, aimed 
at artists.
The 
Surface 
Studio 
is 
powered by a Skylake Core i5 or 
i7, coupled with an Nvidia GT965 
or GT980. All the workings 
are neatly tucked into a slim 
base unit, making the screen 
wonderfully thin, at just half an 
inch thick. The hinged support 
enables the screen to go from 
vertical to almost horizontal 
(but, annoyingly, not quite—
it still slopes at 20 degrees). 
There’s just one screen size at 
launch—a 28-inch PixelSense, 
boasting a resolution of 4500x 
3000 pixels (that’s 192 dpi), with 
10-bit color. Microsoft showed 
the Studio flipping between 
sRGB and DCI-P3 color profiles 
on the fly, something the target 
audience will appreciate.
Where the Studio really 
scores, though, is touch. Using 
The Surface Studio looks 
good, and gives Apple’s iMac 
something to ponder on
Microsoft’s idea of a hipster using its new Surface Studio. Microsoft 
and hipster don’t usually go together.

On September 21, there was a huge 
Distributed Denial of Service attack aimed 
at the DNS servers of Dyn. The servers 
received 40–50 times the usual levels of 
requests, causing significant outages and 
slowdowns in three waves during the day. 
The culprit was a piece of open-source 
malware called Mirai, and responsibility 
was claimed by the groups Anonymous  
and New World Hackers, although this is 
difficult to verify. It was the largest DDoS 
attack so far.
Mirai targets Linux systems, primarily 
those embedded into small devices, such as 
routers, and turns them into bots, sending 
out streams of spurious IP requests. What 
makes this attack worrying was the sheer 
number of devices involved: estimated at 
over 100,000.
The advent of the Internet of Things means 
there are a lot of small devices connected to 
the big bad Internet world, which have little 
thought to security. Mirai was able to be so 
successful because of the number of devices 
running on factory-default usernames 
and passwords. As the Internet becomes 
integral to modern life, we may have to be 
a little more careful about what we connect 
and how—a huge number of devices using 
the factory-default password is just asking 
for trouble.
One defense is to fight fire with fire, by 
using a so-called nematode, an anti-worm. 
It’s only been speculated so far, but the idea 
is to use a stack overflow buffer vulnerability 
within Mirai to neutralize it. It can’t clean 
an infected device, but it can stop it from 
spewing out its debilitating IP requests. It’s a 
drastic solution, however, as it still involves 
hacking devices without permission, so is 
not exactly legal, either. –CL 
Twitter has 317 million active users, but 
the curve is flattening out, and it’s looking 
increasingly troubled. Revenue is falling, and 
it’s to lose 350 jobs, 9 percent of the workforce. 
It’s also shutting its Vine video-sharing service. 
The company aims to be profitable by next year, 
but still has a $100-plus million gap to bridge.
After months of rumors, it looks as if Twitter is for sale. Google is a potential 
bidder, especially given the failure of Google+ to fly. Disney has been tipped, 
leading to a share rally, but it looks an odd fit. Salesforce is also said to be 
sniffing around, as is Microsoft. Facebook is one big player that isn’t involved. 
Twitter has had a tough year, losing 14 key executives, and failing to attract 
enough new users. Maintaining momentum on social media is tough; massive 
success is almost inevitably followed by stagnation. The fate of MySpace shows 
what a fickle lot we can be. Expect new management shortly. –CL
Twitter for sale?
Growth slows, and staff 
shrinks—interested?
The Internet of Things 
has a problem
kernel bug emerges
Dirty Copy-on-Write (aka Dirty Cow) is a vulnerability in Linux that has been lurking 
under the surface since 2007, but has only recently been exploited. And it is a massive 
vulnerability—it even gets its own logo. The vulnerability is in a part of the Linux kernel, 
so is present in virtually every Linux distribution, thus it affects a lot of Android phones as 
well. A malicious application can tamper with a read-only root-owned executable mapped 
into memory. The trick is to slip between the read and write parts of a copy, and redirect the 
operation. If that happens, it is potentially game over. 
Apparently, Linus Torvalds tried to fix the problem 11 years ago, and failed, but thought it 
too difficult to exploit, so quietly walked away. Since then, changes in the kernel design have 
made it easier to exploit. Patches are out now, and everyone affected needs to apply the 
updates and reboot—and that includes Android phones. Of more concern is its exploitation 
in embedded Linux devices, many of which rarely get patched. –CL

What to Expect From 
Intel’s Kaby Lake
With Kaby Lake, Intel is moving away from tick-
tock, and embracing a new philosophy: process-
architecture-optimization. The first two correspond 
to tick-tock, but that third “optimization” stage is 
new, and Kaby Lake will be our first look at how it 
plays out. “Optimization” means Intel is tweaking the 
architecture and refining the process technology.
On the architecture front, the major update is 
an enhanced video decoder block that will handle 
4K HEVC encoding/decoding. The block is a fixed 
function implementation that supports the Main10 
profile, which is increasingly important for things 
such as 4K VP9 YouTube videos. Using a fixed function 
design sacrifices flexibility for improved speed and 
efficiency, and Intel claims Kaby Lake laptops will be 
able to provide up to 9.5 hours of 4K video playback. 
Intel also states that encoding a one-hour video into 
4K HEVC can be done in 12 minutes. Kaby Lake will 
also feature improvements to the Speed Shift tech, 
introduced with Skylake, allowing the CPU to more 
quickly enter and exit higher clock speed states. It’s 
the old “hurry up and go slow” mentality, letting the 
CPU complete a task as quickly as possible, so it can 
then return to a low-power idle state.
Outside these architectural changes, Kaby Lake 
appears to be largely the same as Skylake, with one 
qualification: Intel is tweaking the 14nm process, 
with a refined fin profile (the FinFET part of the 
process) it’s calling 14nm+. Intel says 14nm+ will be 
less transistor-dense than 14nm, with a larger fin 
For the past decade, Intel has been creating new CPUs based on 
its “tick-tock” model, where each tick represents a whole new process 
technology (starting with 65nm, back in 2006), and each tock involves a 
new architecture built on an existing process. 
pitch and reduced channel strain. 
So, at roughly the same power 
requirements, Intel should be able 
to tack on a few extra hundred 
MHz in clock speed. For standard 
workloads, Intel claims Kaby Lake 
ultraportable 
and 
two-in-one 
laptops will be up to 19 percent 
faster than Skylake equivalents.
If you’re reading between the 
lines, many of the above changes 
obviously mean a lot for laptops. 
Like the past several CPU releases, 
Kaby Lake isn’t designed as a 
desktop-first architecture. It should 
already be available in laptops by 
the time you read this, but desktops 
are slated to launch in early 2017, 
probably coinciding with the annual 
Consumer Electronics Show. And, 
Jarred Walton has been a  
PC and gaming enthusiast  
for over 30 years.
recently, we were able to find out 
some of the names and core specs 
for the upcoming desktop parts.
The Core i7-7700K will sit at the 
top of the stack, with a base clock 
of 4.2GHz—200MHz higher than the 
6700K—and the maximum turbo will 
probably be 4.4–4.6GHz. Hopefully, 
it will be able to hit 5GHz with 
overclocking, but we’ll need actual 
hardware to test. The Core i5-7600K 
will be the usual quad-core minus 
Hyper-Threading, with a base clock 
of 3.8GHz. That’s the highest base 
clock for a Core i5 Intel has ever 
released, and I expect it will be 
the first time Core i5 has officially 
broken the 4.0GHz barrier—not 
that we haven’t been doing that and 
much more with overclocking for 
years. Also apparently breaking the 
4.0GHz barrier will be the Core i3-
7300, clocked at an even 4.0GHz.
Along with the desktop CPUs 
come new chipsets: the Z270, H270, 
B250, Q270, and Q250. It’s too early 
to say what exactly these new 
chipsets will introduce, although 
we do know they’ll use the same 
LGA1151 sockets. These new boards 
should work with Skylake, and 
current Z170 motherboards should 
work with Kaby Lake after a BIOS 
update too.

However, if you find this place less scary, or as 
simply a challenging puzzle—because, let’s face 
it, you’re probably in that TTY screen because you 
broke something—you’ll be in good company at a 
Linux or open-source convention or event.
Events and conventions are great places to learn 
about what’s happening in the field. I was lucky 
enough to be able to attend RSA in San Francisco in 
2016. While there’s a lot of interesting gear to see, 
and lots of booths advertising things, you can learn 
a lot by attending keynotes or sessions. And there’s 
a good chance you’ll find yourself in the same room 
as someone who makes decisions about a piece of 
software that will affect users.
I’ve compiled a list of a few of the bigger events 
that are happening this year around the country. It’s 
by no means complete, but I thought it would offer up 
a small sample of what’s out there.

March 2-5 
Pasadena, CA
The Southern California Linux Expo (ScaLE) is 
based in LA, and has sessions and events to cater to 
all your geeky needs. From a PGP key signing party 
to a ham radio examination, ScaLE 
has plenty to offer Angelinos and 
those who can make it to southern 
California. The price of registration 
for a full pass was $75 in 2016.
LibrePlanet

March 25-26  
Greater Boston Area, MA
LibrePlanet is about “free,” as 
in “freedom” in “free software.” 
Hosted by the Free Software 
Foundation, this is the place to go if 
you want to increase your chances 
of bumping into Stallman himself. If 
you’re a student or a member of the 
FSF, you get in gratis. Regular Joes 
will have to pony up $90.
LinuxFest Northwest

May 6-7  
Bellingham, WA
One of the biggest Linux events in 
the country, and attendance is free. 
(You’ll still need to pay for food and

http://defcon.org
July 27-30 
Las Vegas, NV
While it’s not strictly for FOSS, 
Def Con is known as the hacker 
event to go to. If LinuxFest is a nice 
camping trip, Def Con is Wasteland 
Weekend. Like industrial music 
and all-nighters? This is the 
place for you. Just make sure all 
your devices have their wireless 
capabilities disabled. Cost is $240, 
plus a room in Vegas for three days, 
and a hefty caffeine budget.
There are plenty more events that 
are to be determined this year, so if 
none of these fit your travel plans, 
don’t worry. While the big events get 
a lot of attention, there are plenty 
of smaller hackathons and events 
to attend nationwide. And if there 
are none near you, you could be 
the prestigious founder of your own 
local annual FOSS event.

Without the mouse, our computing experiences would be very different. There’s a model 
for everyone, and a style for every shape of hand. However, the industry is under a lot of 
scrutiny. We spoke to Carl Silbersky, CEO at Mionix, and Christoffer Suess, VP of marketing, 
to understand how they go about the design process, what prompted them to add a GSR 
and heart rate sensor to the latest Naos, and where they think the industry is heading.
Mionix Lays the 
Peripheral Industry Bare 
Carl Silbersky and Chris Suess give their insights
Maximum PC: Can you tell 
us what exactly prompted you 
to integrate a heart rate sensor 
into a mouse?
Carl Silbersky: If I take a 
step back there for a moment, 
I would say that I didn’t come 
from the hardware industry—
that’s the first thing. And my 
observation, when I first came 
to Mionix, which was two and 
a half years ago, was that I just 
laughed at the whole hardware 
industry. Like, Jesus, what’s 
happening here, you know? 
Where’s the innovation? What’s 
been happening in the last 10 
years with gaming hardware? I 
mean nothing, basically nothing. 
I mean, what we’ve [peripheral 
manufacturers] done is we’ve 
put bears, and snakes, and 
things like that on the mice, 
and we call them gaming 
peripherals. And then, suddenly, 
we tried to shove—well, they’ve 
been trying; I mean, Chris 
here has been very successful, 
when he was at Razer—a 
snake down into a 14-year-old’s 
throat. I mean, you did this very 
successfully, Chris, I have to give 
it to you. 
Anyway, it was seen as 
obscure people who used to 
game—that’s how it used to be 
viewed. And from my vision, 
when I came, I was like, gaming 
is completely exploding, and 
it’s what we are all going to do. I 
mean, when you look at Steam, it 
was going through the roof—it’s 
going to be a natural thing, what 
we’re all going to do, gaming in 
one way or another. And when 
I looked at the peripherals at 
hand, the basic peripherals, 
which we’re trying to fix here 
at Mionix—the mouse, the 
keyboard, the headset—I was 
like, OK, what has happened? 
Nothing. So we started with 
that: OK, nothing has been 
happening, so let’s at least try 
to get the basics in there. The 
basics for us, you call innovative; 
for us, it’s like, of course there 
should be a heart rate sensor 
in there. And the thing is, I think 
what I missed, and what we’re 
completely open with, was that, 
OK, so I’m watching somebody 
gaming, which we all love, when 
we get together at Mionix. We 
looked at Twitch, and were like, 
wow, this is going to really take 
off. It’s entertaining, it’s more 
fun than a lot of the sports 
displayed in the world, and you 
can interact with the gamer 
etc, etc. But why can’t I see the 
actual reaction of the person 
when they’re playing Dead by 
Daylight, or whatever? So that 
was one reason. 
The second reason was 
actually that we did hack at it 
in the office, when we looked 
at, y’know, what can we add 
to these mice, and what came 
out of it was that we had this 
idea like, let’s add a layer, so I 
can actually see someone, and 
see what their reaction is when 
Mionix’s CEO and 
investor, Carl 
Silbersky, gives 
us his take on 
the peripheral 
industry.

they’re gaming, and that’s when 
we started to integrate sensors 
into the mice. And one thing 
lead to another thing, and we 
said, you know, we should have 
a GSR sensor in there as well, 
so you can overlay, and see their 
reaction in gaming. But I think 
what you’re going to see from 
us is that there’s so much more 
to be done, there’s so much still 
missing for us. For me, this is 
basic, this is what we needed, 
this should have been done—
why hasn’t anybody else, with a 
budget that’s probably 10 times 
the size of ours, like Logitech, 
which is 20 times bigger than us, 
done it? Where have they been 
for the last 10 years?
MPC: With all that in mind, 
then, who is the Naos QG mouse 
aimed at? Is it solely the Twitch 
streamers? The YouTubers?
Carl: This is the way we look 
at it: they’re streamers—but, 
actually, they’re creative people. 
The streamers we like are 
entertainers, you know? Like 
Pewdiepie—he’s an entertainer, 
isn’t he? Is he a gamer? No—
he’s not a fantastic gamer. But 
I want to see, when I watch 
somebody stream, someone 
who entertains me. I want to 
see a reaction from them, and 
this is a great layer for someone 
to display their reaction on. 
So, it’s for the creators; it’s for 
the streamers to start with, I 
would say. 
Secondly, it’s for the group 
of people, like esports people, 
who want to get super-hardcore 
data, and crunch data when 
they’re gaming. Or even poker 
players, who we’re getting a lot 
of interest from. 
So, first, it’s the creators, 
the streamers, who want to 
display what they’re doing, 
and want to show off and 
create entertainment value, 
and make people understand. 
Then, the second market is the 
poker players, the gamers, the 
esports people, who just want to 
understand—the more serious 
data-crunching people. 
MPC: Speaking of the heart 
rate sensor in particular, is that 
something that’s proprietary to 
Mionix, or will you be opening 
that up to other peripheral 
manufacturers?
Carl: Let me say it like this: 
We’ve started some discussions, 
and people have reached out 
to us—a very interesting group 
has reached out to us, in fact—
and we might be considering 
something. If you’re asking 
whether we will go deeper into 
other areas, and collaborate, 
then, yeah, maybe. We’ll see 
where this leads us. But the 
more interesting part is that 
we have a set of open APIs, so 
developers can actually use 
them, and integrate them any 
way they want, in any gameplay, 
or whatever they want to do with 
them—they can make use of 
those open APIs. I can say this: 
Several universities came to 
us, and asked us to do research 
things with them. We thought 
that was super-interesting, 
and that lead to another thing, 
which lead to another thing, and 
now we’re having some pretty 
interesting discussions.
Chris Suess: What we can 
say is that we were actually 
approached by one of the other 
peripheral manufacturers, right, 
but we have not decided how 
to handle that. Interest is there 
from other parties, but without 
going too much into detail, it’s an 
open discussion.
Carl: Chris, I’ve said too 
much, but we have the other 
manufacturers, as we’ve said, 
we have the universities, which 
is for research, we have game 
developers, and we have open 
APIs. So, for us, it’s open as to 
where we’re going with this. 
MPC: So, it sounds as though 
you’re looking to innovate not 
only at Mionix, but also across 
the entire industry?
Carl: To be honest, I don’t even 
know what Mionix is. Are we a 
hardware company? Yeah, today 
we’re a hardware company. 
What are we tomorrow? Well, 
you know, we might not just stay 
true to hardware.
MPC: OK….
Carl: So now you’re going 
to get even more confused, 
because, er, yeah… But it’s true, 
what we’re doing is not just, “Oh, 
let’s just bring out another piece 
of hardware.” I think the world 
has a lot of pieces of hardware, 
so let’s see where we can go 
with this, and where that leads 
us—that’s our interest. We’re 
weird, I know we’re weird, I 
know you’re going to perceive us 
as weird.
MPC: Not at all! But, pushing 
the Naos QG aside for a moment, 
how do you go about mouse 
design in general? Where do you 
start with that?
Carl: It starts with an idea and 
a shape for purpose. We want 
to create mice that, regardless 
of grip, can serve people while 
resting the fingers—usually 
right-handed mice. That’s the 
idea we had from the starting 
point, and from there on, it’s 
a process. The whole design 
goes into process, and we’ve 
been famous over the years for 
creating great ergonomic mice. 
It’s almost a shame that, with 
the size of the company when 
we took it over, and given the 
products Mionix produces, up 
until then it only had the Naos 
and the Avior. It was a shame, 
because I thought they were 
fantastic pieces of hardware. 
They had not been recognized 
for their ergonomics. So, when 
we created the Castor, we went 
after a specific ID for a specific 
kind of mouse. Then it starts 
to go into an iterative process 
of shaping and reshaping, 
again and again, and it’s 
actually physical work, like 
craftsmanship. You sit down 
with a block, and then you iterate 
that one over, and over, and 
over, and then you have people 
coming in and feeling it, and 
understanding. And saying, “No, 
I want this, and this, and this.” 
The Mionix Castor made 
waves with its fantastic 
ergonomic design.
The basics for us, you call innovative; 
for us, of course there should be a 
heart rate sensor in there

Upgrade All-In-One?
Hello Doc, I know that all-in-
ones are difficult to modify, 
because of their size, thermal, 
and power constraints. But 
do you think it would be 
possible to upgrade my HP 
Envy 23 d038c, dropping in a 
new GPU, and maybe SSD? I 
want to play Battlefield 4 and 
1 at 60fps on at least Medium 
quality. I discovered that the 
motherboard has two second-
gen PCI Express mini-card 
slots, and a PCI Express MXM 
slot that supports a 16-lane 
graphics card. So, would it 
be possible for me to fit in a 
low-profile $100-250 GPU and 
an SSD, without needing to buy 
a new case/board? I should 
expect to need a new PSU 
though, right?
–Charlie
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
Unfortunately, without knowing 
your current specs, it’s hard 
to say how much you’d gain 
from an upgrade. Then again, 
the H61-based motherboard 
HP uses is fairly flexible. For 
instance, there are 13 different 
host processors approved for 
use on it, including third-gen 
(Ivy Bridge) Core i7 CPUs 
rated for up to 65W. If you’re 
currently using a dual-core 
or older Sandy Bridge-based 
chip, that’s one possible avenue 
for extra performance. Two 
memory slots pave the way 
for up to 16GB of DDR-1600 
memory—but only if you drop 
in one of those third-gen Core 
CPUs. The generation prior 
only supported 4GB SO-DIMMs, 
capping you at 8GB total.
Now here’s the bad news. 
Although the Envy 23 does 
have an MXM 3.0 Type A slot, 
HP specifies that whatever you 
drop in has to be under 35W. 
It’s difficult enough to find MXM 
cards for sale (these aren’t just 
low-profile graphics cards, 
but rather laptop-oriented 
modules). But a 35W ceiling 
is virtually unheard of. And 
anything you do find won’t be 
fast enough for Battlefield.
An SSD is certainly more 
plausible. From the factory, 
two available SATA 2.0 ports 
connect to one hard disk, 
and the Envy’s SuperMulti 
Blu-ray player. You could 
replace the mechanical 
drive with solid-state 
storage for quicker response 
times, though that old SATA 
interface will bottleneck peak 
throughput to under 300MB/s.
In the end, HP’s older all-
in-one is great for productivity 
and convenience. It’s not a 
gaming platform, though. And 
while you have some upgrade 
options, that money would be 
better spent on hardware for a 
real Battlefield-worthy PC.
Tracking Down a TPM
Hello, Doctor. The release 
of Microsoft’s Windows 10 
Anniversary Update includes 
the mandatory requirement 
of a TPM 2.0 module to enable 
new security features. I have 
an Asus Maximus VIII Hero 
motherboard (running BIOS 
version 1902), with a 14-1-pin 
TPM connector. When I search 
Asus’s website, I find other 
people asking this same 
question: Where can I find the 
14-1-pin module compatible 
with Asus’s Maximus VIII Hero? 
Moreover, can you describe 
what new Windows 10 security 
features desktop users are 
getting? Finally, if my system 
doesn’t have the required TPM 
2.0 module, will the Anniversary 
Update still install?

–Phil Carlson
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: The 
Doc found listings for Asus’s 
14-1-pin TPM module on 
Amazon, eBay, B&H, and even 
Walmart’s website. They may 
have been hard to come by 
earlier in 2016, but availability 
appears plentiful as the year 
comes to a close.
As for the role TPM 2.0 plays 
in Win 10 Anniversary Update, 
it’s all about security. BitLocker 
(full disk encryption), Measured 
Boot (a log for verifying the 
integrity of a client system’s 
boot state), Credential Guard 
(a feature related to Virtual 
Security Mode for managing 
credentials), and Virtual 
Smart Cards leverage Trusted 
Platform Module capabilities to 
keep sensitive data isolated.
Windows Hello adds facial 
and fingerprint recognition to 
sidestep the vulnerabilities 
commonly associated with 
compromised passwords. And 
while a TPM isn’t required to 
A 750W PSU is  
more than ample for 
most high-end PCs with 
efficient CPUs and GPUs.

use Hello, your authentication 
information is best protected 
by hardware. Just be aware 
that Hello works with biometric 
sensors attached to your 
PC, which may require some 
additional investment.
You should have no trouble 
installing the Anniversary 
Update, even without the TPM.
Will It Play Nice?
I’m not sure if these parts are 
compatible. Will they play nicely 
together at the playground? My 
shopping cart includes an Intel 
Core i7-6700K, MSI’s Z170A 
Mpower Gaming Titanium, a 
DDR4-3466 Corsair Dominator 
Platinum kit in four 16GB 
modules, an Asus GeForce GTX 
980 Ti Strix graphics card, two 
512GB Samsung 950 Pro SSDs, 
and Be Quiet!’s Dark Rock Pro 
CPU cooler.

–James Dodson, Psy.D.
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: Are 
all of those parts compatible 
from a technology standpoint? 
Yes. Does the Doc think they 
represent the best balance for 
your money? Not necessarily. 
Will you probably run into 
clearance trouble with those 
memory modules and that 
cooler? It sure looks like it.
MSI’s Z170A Mpower Gaming 
Titanium is one of the pricier 
LGA 1151-equipped mobos, so 
the Doc assumes you chose 
it for its exotic looks, which 
you’ll show off prominently in 
a windowed case. Fair enough. 
Intel’s Core i7-6700K is a solid 
pick at the top of its Skylake-
based stack, so no argument 
there. And the Dark Rock Pro 3 
is an attractive air cooler with 
serious performance chops.
Unfortunately, Corsair’s 
Dominator Platinum modules 
are incredibly tall. Coupled 
with Be Quiet!’s heatsink, the 
Doc would worry about a height 
incompatibility. Even if the 
pieces did fit together, you’ll see 
little benefit from a $500-plus 
DDR4-3466 kit. Spend under 
$200 on a lower-profile 32GB 
kit, and pocket the difference.
You can also do better than 
that Asus GeForce GTX 980 
Ti. For $50 less, any number 
of GeForce GTX 1080 8GB 
cards deliver double-digit 
performance gains. Or snag a 
GeForce GTX 1070 serving up 
similar frame rates as the 980 
Ti for closer to $400.
As for storage, nobody will 
argue against the potency 
of two 512GB 950 Pros. But 
consider a big mechanical 
disk in some sort of redundant 
array for your movies, music, 
and photos, too. Alternatively, 
networked or cloud-based 
storage would work. 
Just make sure those 
important memories 
and media files are 
protected against failure.
Stop the PSU Madness
Doc, I’ve noticed a trend of 
people believing they need 
larger power supplies than 
they do, then recommending 
the same to others. In the 
November edition of Maximum 
PC, you answered a reader’s 
question regarding his power 
supply. You stated a PC pulling 
500W with a PSU rated for 
1,000W would pull 555W from 
the wall, whereas a PSU rated 
for 725W would pull 625W. But 
you compared an 80 PLUS Gold 
1,000W PSU to an 80 PLUS (not 
Gold, or Silver, or even Bronze) 
725W PSU, which isn’t fair. An 
80 PLUS Gold PSU should be 
90 percent efficient or better at 
50 percent load, and 87 percent 
efficient or better at 100 percent 
load. An 80 PLUS Gold 725W 
PSU will be at about 70 percent 
of rated load, so probably 88 
percent efficient. So an 80 PLUS 
Gold 725W PSU will be drawing 
568W, not 625W.
I see similar comments 
when people ask about 
upgrading video cards. The 
answers they receive suggest at 
least a 750W PSU to drive one 
GeForce GTX 970 and a Core 
i7-3770K, when a 450W PSU is 
more than enough. This trend 
makes folks believe they don’t 
have the headroom to upgrade, 
even though they do. For 
example, your mid-range build 
calls for a 650W PSU, when the 
components only pull 327W.
When considering power 
supplies, I usually estimate how 
much power my components 
will use, then add 20 percent 
for margin. That keeps my 
PSU within its limits, and my 
components on budget. A good 
PSU can operate up to its limit 
for a long time with no issues.
Leaving room for future 
expansion is fine; encouraging 
people to overbuy their PSU (or 
not upgrade hardware because 
of it) is not. Waste heat and 
losses due to inefficiencies 
are negligible in good power 
supplies. Please help stop 
the madness.
–AJ Starling
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: What 
makes the comparison unfair? 
Both PSUs in the Doc’s example 
are purely hypothetical, and the 
math works out. A 1kW 80 PLUS 
Gold PSU feeding a PC 500W 
is about 90 percent efficient at 
this 50 percent load, pulling 
555W from the wall. The 750W 
80 PLUS example feeding the 
same 500W is about 80 percent 
efficient at 67 percent load, 
pulling 625W from the wall.
Obviously, changing the 80 
PLUS efficiency rating affects 
what’s lost to heat. Give both 
made-up PSUs a sexy 80 PLUS 
Titanium rating, jack up their 
prices by $100, and suddenly 
the 1kW PSU only pulls 532W 
from the wall, while the 750W 
model is closer to 545W.
Not to take away from the 
point we both were trying to 
make: It’s important to strike 
a balance. Weigh the needs of 
your components, add some 
headroom to avoid running at 
100 percent load (leaving room 
for future expansion at the 
same time), and decide how 
much extra you’re willing to pay 
for high efficiency.
Xeon vs. Core i7
Dear Doctor, We’ve been reading 
Maximum PC for almost a year, 
and have learned a lot, but we 
still have questions. We need a 
powerful computer for working 
in Avid Pro Tools 11 and Avid 
Media Composer 8. We want to 
build a powerful PC, but don’t 
know the difference between 
Intel’s Xeon and Core i7 families.
For the Core i7 build, we’d 
pick between a 5960X or 6950X, 
a 512GB Samsung 950 Pro 
for the OS, a 500GB 850 EVO 
for the sound library, two WD 
Black 6TB drives for data, and 
a GeForce GTX 1080 Founder’s 
Edition. If we went with a Xeon, 
we’d choose an eight-core E5 
with 25MB of L3 cache. Can we 
still use an X99 motherboard 
and regular DDR4 RAM? If not, 
what do we need? Would this be 
better than a Core i7?

–Anthony & Julia Shepard
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: In truth, 
Core i7s and uniprocessor 
Xeons (like the latest E5-1600 
v4 line-up) are architecturally 
identical. The Core i7s support 
overclocking through unlocked 
multipliers, though, while 
the Xeons accommodate ECC 
memory, enable vPro, and 
allow you to install more than 
1.5TB of RAM. Many X99-based 
motherboards do support Xeon 
E5-1600 CPUs, but if you need 
tons of memory, you’ll want to 
find a platform with Intel’s C612 
chipset on it instead. 
 
All-in-ones 
are great for 
convenience, 
but their 
form factor 
makes 
upgrades 
tricky.

The concept of the upgrade path 
is at the very core of the hardware 
enthusiast’s philosophy. The notion 
that you can take a five-year-old 
system, throw out a few parts, install 
a few new ones, and have a rig up and 
running—which almost competes with 
a brand new build—in less time than 
it takes for Obama to drop the mic is 
certainly appealing. But how far does it 
go in practice? What makes the biggest 
difference? 
And 
what 
should 
you 
upgrade first?
This month, we decided to find out. 
We took two case studies, two rigs 
gathering dust in the corners of our 
office: one a gaming system, the other 
a workstation. And then we chose two 
very different upgrade paths for them 
both, just to see what makes the biggest 
difference to overall performance in 
their respective fields. 
The first system was an ageing 
workstation. Featuring a mighty Core 
i7-970, this bad boy was Intel’s second 
venture into six-core processors—and 
coming in at 3.2GHz and $885, it was 
no slouch. Coupled with a thwomping 
6GB of DDR3 1600, a singular 2TB SATA 
II HDD, and a powerful ATI HIS HD 5870 
graphics card, it was a monster in its 
heyday. Six years on, however, its hard 
drive is sluggish, the processor on 
a par with a modern Core i5, and its 
motherboard support simply laughable. 
In the other corner is our gaming rig. Far 
younger than its sibling workstation, 
this one had fared a bit better over the 
years. Featuring an Intel Core i5-4670, 
the Haswell monster still had plenty of 
computational power to muster—with 
8GB of RAM, a 256GB OCZ Vertex 4 SSD, 
and a reference GTX 670 pumping those 
frames, you could still game at 1080p, 
albeit far below the minimum 30fps in 
most cases.
So, if you’re curious about what you 
should upgrade next, and whether it’s 
worth it, or you just want to take a look 
at what we did to bring these mature 
machines back to life, read on.

Upgrading your CPU isn’t about buying the 
most expensive chip out there.
There are plenty of reasons why 
we upgrade. They can range from the 
essential to the vain, from the aspirational 
to the vital. An upgrade may allow you to hit 
better frame rates in your favorite games, 
or give your system enough raw grunt to 
tackle a title that it couldn’t before. If you 
use your machine for more serious work, 
an upgrade may allow you to get more done 
in a shorter space of time, or even do things 
that you wouldn’t have been able to do with 
your current system. 
A reasonable rule of thumb is: If you 
find yourself waiting for your machine 
to finish a task, then it could probably 
do with an upgrade. Whether that’s 
rendering a video, applying an effect to 
an image, booting, loading an application 
or website—anything at all, really. Your 
time is precious, so don’t squander it 
waiting for a machine to complete a task, 
when technology is there to help. And it 
doesn’t have to be a hardware upgrade 
that you need; turning to better software, 
or tweaking the software you’re already 
running, could also be an option—but we’ll 
come on to that shortly.
Of course, there tends to be something 
holding most of us back when it comes 
to pulling the trigger on constantly 
upgrading, and that’s the cost. Weighing 
up the benefits against the price tag is 
just as important as working out what 
those hardware updates should be. If 
your budget can extend to getting the 
very best component in each category, 
then all power to you, but most of us can’t 
afford to maintain such an aggressive 
upgrade regime. If you know that you’re 
going to have to change out several vital 
components, then planning your upgrade 
makes sense—buying a graphics card that 
Practical advice 
for upgrading
will still be relevant when you change up 
your processor and motherboard later.
Knowing what you want from an upgrade 
is key, because without that knowledge, 
you’re just chasing the next biggest and 
brightest thing, without taking stock of 
whether it actually makes sense. Working 
out what you want to do also enables you to 
focus on the component or subsystem that 
will have the greatest impact. Quite often, 
only you can really know what that area is. 
For instance, we wouldn’t normally 
recommend that you spend your time and 
money upgrading your memory, because 
for the vast majority of uses, 8GB is 
enough (or even 4GB, if you’re dealing 
with a much older machine). However, if 
you’re multitasking a lot, editing multiple 
4K images, and messing around with UHD 
video, then doubling up to 16GB or even 
32GB could reap real benefits. 
Processors
Your CPU is at the heart of pretty 
much everything you do, so 
there’s a certain logic in coveting 
the very latest processor 
architecture, and seeing that as 
the magical panacea to all your 
computing woes. The problem 
with this train of thought is that 
more recent CPU upgrades have 
been fairly subtle in real terms. 
In fact, the last few generations 
have seen raw performance 
increase by just 10 percent. So, 
if you miss a generation, there’s 
not too much to get upset about. 
Miss a few generations, though, 
and those figures add up (such 
increases are cumulative). 
We haven’t seen any major 
shift in core counts 
for mainstream 
processors, and 
the frequencies 
have been creeping up 
reasonably slowly as well. 
So, even if your CPU is a few 
generations out of date, that’s no 
guarantee that a CPU upgrade 
will transform your PC. Indeed, 
as we found in one of our case 
studies over the page, a decent 
CPU from quite a few years ago 
can still stand its ground against 
newer chips in practical terms. 
There is a fairly major 
caveat here, though, which is 
that newer processors support 
newer technologies, aka the 
chipsets, and in terms of the 
bigger picture, this could make a 
CPU and motherboard upgrade 
a far more attractive option. M.2 
NVMe drives, for instance, can 
hit transfer rates of 3.5GB/s, as 
opposed to a lowly SATA SSD, 
which sits at a meager 550MB/s. 
Aim for a platform, 
and reap the benefits 
of the latest tech.

today’s best upgrades

Graphics cards 
aren’t just for 
playing games.
Graphics cards
If gaming is something that 
interests you, you need a 
graphics card. If you want to 
play the latest games, you 
need an up-to-date graphics 
card. That’s pretty much 
the long and short of it. If 
gaming is lower down on 
your list, you probably don’t 
need to upgrade—in fact, 
you might be able to get away 
with the integrated graphics 
capabilities of your CPU. As we 
say, knowing what you want to 
use your machine for is key.
As ever with graphics cards, 
you need to keep your target 
display in mind when looking 
at upgrades. There’s not a lot 
of point dropping $800 on a 
GeForce GTX 1080 if you’re 
happy with your standard HD 
Storage
While processors and 
graphics cards get the most 
love in any upgrade decision, 
they’re not the only areas of 
your system that you should 
be considering. In fact, we 
would suggest that another 
component should be the focus 
of your passions nowadays, 
display, and don’t intend to 
upgrade it any time soon. Buy 
a graphics card that can drive 
your display(s), it’s that simple. 
We run plenty of graphics card 
group tests to help you make 
the decision on what graphics 
card is right for you, but just 
as with the processor market 
at the moment, there’s a good 
correlation between price 
and performance—if you’re 
serious about gaming, then it’s 
and here we’re talking about 
storage. If you’re looking to 
make just one upgrade in your 
machine, then upgrading to a 
modern, speedy SSD will make 
a tangible difference to pretty 
much everything you do. 
Yes, we know that it isn’t 
traditionally the sexiest bit of 
wise to spend as much as you 
can to get the performance 
you need for today’s and 
tomorrow’s titles.
Again, there’s a proviso, 
which is to do with using a 
graphics card for more serious 
work. Some applications 
can take advantage of the 
processing power of a graphics 
card using CUDA or OpenCL 
to improve performance 
significantly—we’re talking 
computing, but the difference 
storage can make to how you 
use your machine can be as 
obvious as the difference 
between night and day. This is 
particularly relevant if you’re 
rocking a spinning hard drive 
as your main boot device, but 
also true if you’re going from 
about the likes of Blender, 
Maya, and Sony Vegas, among 
others. The problem is 
knowing which applications 
you use actually take 
advantage of which cards, 
using which API, and ultimately 
to what benefit. Check out the 
software developer’s website 
for the application you’re 
utilizing, to see if there’s any 
advantage to using a specific 
graphics card.
a first- or second-generation 
SSD up to a modern NVMe M.2 
drive. This in turn may require 
an upgrade to your system’s 
motherboard, which could 
lead to a new processor, new 
memory, and more, so as ever, 
it comes back to what you 
actually use your machine for. 
Do yourself a 
favor—upgrade 
to a modern SSD.
There’s still a place 
for spinning storage 
in modern PCs.

So here she is, our upgraded 
gaming machine. From the get go, 
she came packed with a quad-core 
processor, 8GB of DDR3, a slightly 
ageing OCZ 256GB SSD, a 1TB hard 
drive, and the powerhouse that was 
the GTX 670. Boy, those were the 
days, huh? Not too old, we know. 
This machine was pieced together 
back in 2013, making it, relatively 
speaking, still fairly new. And it 
shows—the motherboard at the 
rig’s heart is still sound. There’s 
an M.2 slot offering up to 10Gb/s 
transfers, plenty of PCIe slots for 
additional cards, support for up to 
64GB of DDR3, and even onboard 
power buttons.
Aim of the Upgrade
So, the story behind this system 
was fairly simple: We assumed 
that the gamer in question was on 
a tight budget, they didn’t have a lot 
of cash to throw around, and had 
only managed to save up for the 
occasional lump of hardware here 
and there since it had been originally 
built. The last and biggest bundle 
being the motherboard, processor, 
and GPU combo. 
The case was old, probably taken 
from an office PC from years ago, 
or a tower the grandparents had 
used for a while. The power supply 
was also old, and the storage was 
somewhat wanting. So, ultimately, 
we kept it simple and just upgraded 
the memory capacity and the GPU. 
Upgrading from Nvidia’s GeForce 
GTX 670 to the GTX 1060 would 
not only reduce the power draw 
overhead from the GPU, but also 
improve frame rates by well over 
100 percent. 
The Intel Core i5-4670K is by 
no means the bottleneck in this 
system—certainly not yet, anyway—
but we decided to throw out the 
old  memory in favor of something 
a little more impactful. So, we 
Double or 
nothing? Two 
GPUs can 
yield benefits, 
but they also 
increase your 
power draw.
grabbed two sticks of 8GB DDR3 
to ensure that we could both game 
and run programs from the desktop 
without worry.
Free Upgrades?
There’s a variety of things you can 
do to eke out extra performance 
here and there in a gaming build like 
this. Keeping your drivers up to date 
is essential if you want to improve 
performance. An unoptimized game 
can benefit by as much as 20–30 
percent, purely from a driver pass. 
Couple that with a gentle GPU 
overclock, and you can easily crank 
those frames back up when you 
begin to experience problems.
Another cheap fix is to increase 
the number of fans in your build. GPU 
Boost 2.0 automatically increases 
the core clock of your graphics 
card, dependent on the overall 
temperature, so throwing a couple 
of extra fans in the front of a chassis, 
or even on a ventilated side panel, 
should help keep your card cooler, 
and let it overclock higher.
However, if you’re concerned 
that your processor may be holding 
back your GPU, you can throw the 
multiplier up a fraction to see if that 
can alleviate the problem. If you’re 
running a stock cooler, as we are 
here, we suggest leaving the voltage 
alone entirely, and adjusting the 
multiplier by two or three at most. 
CrossFire Conundrum 
An alternative to purchasing a new 
GPU is to opt for a second older 
card instead, usually within one to 
two years of purchasing the first, if 
you can find one. This can be a good 
solution to save a few dollars, but 
it’s not without its setbacks. Firstly, 
SLI and CrossFire profiles aren’t 
always perfect. Generally speaking, 
on game launch, most titles simply 
don’t have support for any multi-GPU 
configurations. Which means your 
second card immediately becomes a 
paperweight. On top of that, it’s likely 
that you’ll end up with trouble in the 
power supply department as well, 
if you’re not careful, because you 
can easily add an additional 200W 
of power draw simply by adding 
the additional card. On the other 
hand, getting a more powerful card 
the first time around, or a newer 
generation of GPU, will lead you to 
guaranteed better performance, and 
better power savings in the long run.

1  
CPU   Ultimately, we 
decided to forego upgrading 
the processor. The Intel Core 
i5-4670K inside this machine holds 
more than enough potential to 
handle any game or program we 
can throw at it. And if we really 
need to, we can swap out the cooler 
for something chunkier, and crank 
those hertz up.
2 GPU   Swapping from a GTX 
670 to a GTX 1060 made a 
whole world of difference. We 
opted to go for the 6GB reference 
variant in the end for this build, but 
the frame rate difference between 
that and the 3GB version really 
isn’t catastrophic. We saw an 
overall increase of almost double 
in every game.
3 Memory   Upgrading 
from 8GB to 16GB of DDR3 
for this build was purely a quality-
of-life procedure. Having access 
to more memory gives us the 
opportunity to run VOIP clients, 
Google Chrome, and recording 
software, all while running some 
of the more demanding AAA titles 
out there. 
4 Hard Drives  All things 
considered, the storage 
situation was pretty sound from 
the start. A 256GB OCZ Vertex4 is 
still quite a competitive drive, and 
backed up by that 1TB drive, it 
covers all your bases. We would 
have loved to have changed to a 
PCIe drive, but for a gaming 
system, it’s not entirely necessary.

The Result
Well, it was always going to be 
a sure-fire victory for the GPU. 
The Intel Core i5-4670K is still an 
extremely competitive core. In fact, 
unless you’re running anything pre-
Sandy Bridge, you’re unlikely to 
reach any bottlenecks with regard to 
gaming and graphical limitations. If 
this system was going to be sitting in 
the office for much longer, we would 
definitely take a look at swapping 
to a more modern chassis, and 
potentially go for a newer power 
supply and better cooling, too—just 
to reduce noise and for peace of 
mind. That said, this is a system 
more than capable of gaming at 
1080p and beyond. Not bad for an 
outlay of just under $400.

This is by far the more interesting 
build. In fact, its ancient and 
decaying spec sheet was still far 
more intriguing than the updates 
that followed. With one of the world’s 
first six-core consumer processors, 
6GB of DDR3, and a prestigious 
Intel motherboard (yep, it still made 
them), this system managed to crank 
out some serious numbers even 
today, six years on. The hard drive 
situation was far less desirable—
with two SATA II HDDs, it was mostly 
used a web server, before finally 
being retired two years ago. Last 
week, it was a shelving unit. So, what 
did we manage to salvage?
Aim of the Upgrade
This was the biggy. We knew we 
wanted to upgrade to a more modern 
chipset. But a more modern chipset 
requires a brand new motherboard, 
and a new mobo requires a new 
processor, which requires new RAM. 
Like a cascade effect, upgrading 
one part meant that pretty much 
everything had to change. We opted 
to grab an Intel Core i7-5820K 
to replace the ageing Gulftown 
processor—it’s cheap, packed with 
additional PCIe lanes for future 
upgrades, and supports the latest 
X99 motherboards. Then we had to 
decide on the memory, upgrading 
from a tri-channel 6GB kit of DDR3 
all the way up to a 32GB kit of quad-
channel Crucial Ballistix Elite. 
Motherboard-wise, we decided 
to go for the EVGA X99 Micro 2. It 
looks crisp and clean, it performs 
well, and it fits into our shiny new 
case well, too. On top of that, it gives 
us plenty of expandability going 
forward, enabling us to install two 
add-in cards if needed. We also fitted 
a 240GB Kingston HyperX Predator 
M.2 PCIe SSD—not the fastest of the 
Ensure your

more power 
than your 
system draws.
PCIe SSDs, but it’s cost effective, and 
easily knocks the old SATA II drives 
out of the park.
Free Upgrades?
There are a couple of free options 
on a setup like this. We took the old 
2TB SATA II drives, and configured 
them to operate in RAID 0 to boost 
sequential read and write speeds. To 
do this, go into your motherboard’s 
BIOS settings, find your SATA 
configuration panel, and change the 
storage type from AHCI to RAID. 
Upon restarting, hold Ctrl, and press 
I repeatedly to get into the RAID 
menu. Select the drives you want, 
choose the RAID setup you’d like, 
and create away. If you’re using RAID 
0, it should double your potential 
sequentials; and if you’re using RAID 
1, it mirrors the data on to the second 
drive, so if one drive fails, you always 
have an accessible backup.
Then there’s overclocking. Far 
more useful for rendering tasks on 
workstations than on gaming PCs, 
bumping the Core i7-5820K up to 
4.2GHz is relatively easy, and shaves 
off a significant amount of time from 
your render cycles.
Pump Up the PSU
For this build, we opted not to swap 
out the graphics card. As it’s not 
gaming PC, but a content creation 
workstation, it was unnecessary to 
move away from a high-end card 
like the 5870 to something more 
modern, at least until we start using 
CUDA for rendering. That said, we 
had to consider that our operating 
requirements were going to change 
dramatically in contrast to the 
old Gulftown rig.
Using 
Pcpartpicker.com, 
we 
specced up the requirements for 
our new upgraded system (including 
older GPUs and hard drives), which 
provided us with a good estimate 
of what our overall power usage 
was going to be (471W at peak). 
You should always look for a power 
supply that provides somewhere in 
the region of 20–25 percent more 
rated power than your system draws 
from the wall. That way, you’ll never 
run it at max capacity, and PSUs are 
generally most efficient when they 
run at 80–90 percent capacity.

1  
CPU   The CPU was the 
second-biggest change we 
made to this system. Jumping 
forward by five generations of 
processor technology has helped 
to push performance up by almost 
35 percent in contrast to the Intel 
Core i7-970 that was originally 
found in this machine. A very 
worthwhile upgrade.
2 Motherboard  And now 
the biggest change we made: 
the motherboard. Not only did we 
opt to go with an X99 board this 
time around, but we also swapped 
over to microATX in the process. 
This means we can choose a 
smaller, more versatile chassis, 
yet still retain all of the power of 
the X99 socket.
3 Hard Drives   Another 
massive change for our 
workstation is the upgrade from 
the ageing SATA II hard drive to 
the modern powerhouse of a 
PCIe SSD. Although it’s not the 
fastest SSD drive out there, the 
HyperX positively warps space 
when you compare it to its 
spinning predecessor.  
4 GPU  Simply put, this 
isn’t a system for the 
gamers—it’s a system for the 
designers, the CAD developers, the 
artists, the videographers, and the 
photographers. An expensive GPU 
simply isn’t necessary. Could it be 
used for gaming in the future? Of 
course, but for the time being, it’s 
far from essential.

All benchmarks are run three times for consistency, and an average is taken. CrystalDiskMark scores are actually correct.
The Result
As you can see from the benchmarks, 
the biggest performance increase 
stemmed from the hard drive swap. 
Going from SATA II drives to a PCIe 
SSD, and using the SATA drives as 
backup storage is nothing short of 
incredible. Interestingly, after five 
years of processor development, 
Intel’s 
six-core 
enthusiast 
chip 
only beats the Intel Core i7-970 by 
35 percent. What’s important to note 
is that the price has plummeted. 
Other than that, this upgrade 
came together nicely. The HD5870 
was still more than enough for all the 
editing we wanted to do. In the long 
term, however, it might have been 
nice to change out to a GTX 1060 or 
RX 480 instead.

Other Tweaks 
and Tricks
Cases
You could say a case is nothing 
more than six panels of metal 
holding the components of a 
system together. In reality, it’s 
much more than that. Cases 
are an essential part of PC 
building. Whether you build 
your own, pinch one from 
an age gone by, or go all-out 
and purchase a $400 affair, 
it’s something that every PC 
user has. But how much of 
an impact does it make in the 
world of upgrades? Is it worth 
upgrading at all? That depends 
on what you have. There are a 
few examples where swapping 
Cooling
Speaking of cooling, it’s 
always a good idea to evaluate 
your situation. Ambient 
temperatures are always going 
to have a dramatic effect on 
overall internal temperatures. 
For instance, if you’re stuck 
in Phoenix without aircon, 
your rig may very easily run 
at a full 10 degrees higher 
than, say, someone sitting in 
Chicago. With that being the 
case, you’re going to need more 
efficient forms of cooling than 
a reference stock cooler to 
avoid thermals throttling your 
hardware. You can check a lot 
of this by running a few simple 
benchmarks, such as Prime95 
and Unity’s Heaven, alongside 
HW Monitor, to register just 
what temperatures your 
hardware is running at.
There are multiple ways 
you can help alleviate the 
throttling situation. Swapping 
out to a newer chassis provides 
you with more performance.
Graphics cards from AMD 
and Nvidia come with a new 
form of technology known as 
GPU Boost. This is an auto-
overclocking feature that 
increases or decreases the 
core clock speed, dependent 
on the card’s temperature. 
Depending on the size of your 
case, and the amount airflow, 
you can affect the temperature 
of hardware inside. It’s why 
blower fans and dual and 
triple dissipation card designs 
exist. Blowers can draw in vast 
out a reference CPU cooler 
for something more efficient, 
such as Cooler Master’s Hyper 
212 Evo, will help ensure your 
processor doesn’t overheat far 
better than any stock cooler, 
and for $30, that’s not a bad 
deal. We also suggest you run 
at least two intake fans in your 
chassis to provide sufficient 
airflow internally, to keep all 
your components well fed. 
If you’re thinking about 
overclocking to boost those 
Low RPM fans with high airflow improve temps and reduce noise.
quantities of air from a single 
vent hole, while the dissipation 
variety spreads the hot air 
around the chassis. If you’re 
not providing enough cool air 
inside a chassis, you’ll likely 
cripple your graphics card’s 
overall performance.
On top of that, there’s the 
ease of access of newer cases, 
with multiple 2.5-inch drives, 
better cable management, 
improved airflow, and support 
for a wider variety of cooling, 
motherboards, form factors, 
and more. So, upgrading your 
chassis can be very satisfying. 
performance figures some 
more, we would suggest you 
take a look at watercooling, 
especially when it comes to 
Intel’s latest chips. You don’t 
necessarily need something 
like a custom loop, but a 
single 120mm AIO liquid 
cooler, such as the NZXT 
Kraken X42 or Corsair Hydro 
H60i, will provide you with 
ample capacity to overclock 
any processor, outside of the 
extreme edition CPUs.
Memory
As DDR4 replaced DDR3 with 
the introduction of the X99 
and Z170 chipsets, it failed 
to impress many hardware 
reviewers, purely because it 
added little to performance 
figures. Indeed, memory 
speeds seem inconsequential 
for the vast majority of users. 
Improved capacities and 
lower power draw, though, 
mean we’re seeing overall 
wattage requirements 
plummet. And if you want 
to upgrade your memory, 
we recommend you choose 
capacity over speed, and get 
the capacity you need: 8-16GB 
for gaming and everyday 
tasks; 16-64GB for 
video rendering 
and 3D 
modeling. 
Speed 
isn’t a 
necessity. 
Chassis 
are slowly 
turning into 
works of art.
DDR4 performance increases are negligible, 
but with increased capacity, it’s a no-brainer.

today’s best upgrades

Monitors
If you’re not into gaming, 
upgrading your screen is a 
relatively painless affair. For 
professionals and graphic 
designers, the obvious route is 
to grab yourself one of those 
swanky IPS panels. Providing 
far better color reproduction, 
IPS and PLS are exceptionally 
useful for those looking for 
color accuracy from screen to 
printer. On top of that, there’s 
the argument of resolution and 
screen real estate. Bumping 
up the size of your screen in 
conjunction with resolution, 
to maintain your pixel per inch 
ratio while also increasing 
screen real estate, makes it 
far easier to work on multiple 
programs at the same time. 
Going from a 24-inch 1080p 
screen to a 27-inch 1440p 
screen is a joy, and well worth 
the time of day.
That said, on the other side 
of the fence, for gaming it’s 
a little more complex. Your 
screen choice is inherently 
symbiotically joined at the 
knee with your GPU. Choosing 
the right screen is dependent 
on what graphics card you 
have, what games you play, 
Motherboards
Motherboards are by far one 
of the most underappreciated 
components in any given 
system. And it’s not 
hard to understand why, 
either. Marketing gurus 
throughout the industry 
have been promoting these 
“performance-enhancing 
pillars of computing” for 
quite some time. If it’s not 
Killer Networking touting a 
whole 200ns faster speeds 
than its Intel rivals, it’s 
efficient capacitors, gaming 
technologies, and whatever 
else the whizz-kids want to 
slap on to each box to bump up 
the price tag. 
That said, once you’ve 
waded through the mire of 
marketing sludge, and got to 
the grunt of what makes Intel’s 
constant chipset updates 
more interesting than most, 
the whole concept is actually 
and what resolution you want 
to achieve. Working backward, 
if you’re looking at gaming 
at 1080p, the RX 480 or GTX 
1060 is a fine combination; at 
1440p, the GTX 1070 or Fury 
more intriguing than you would 
first think.
It’s the enhanced 
connectivity that really sells it. 
Take a look at Z170, compared 
to last generation’s Z97 
chipset, and you’ll see what 
we mean. Each generation 
sees improved support for 
a wide variety of connection 
standards. M.2 SSDs, which 
were so rare two years ago, 
are now commonplace, 
providing read and write 
speeds up to six times faster 
than any SATA SSD, and Intel 
accommodated for that. 
Marketing spiel aside, 
higher priced motherboards 
generally tend to feature 
improved onboard audio, 
alongside more efficient VRMs, 
meaning you can operate 
higher overclocks and low 
undervolts on your system 
with ease. 
X is a perfect solution; for 4K, 
you can almost get away with 
a GTX 1080 with some lower 
AA settings. For high refresh 
rates at 1440p, the GTX 1080 
is the king. 
If you’re gaming, remember to match 
your screen to your GPU.

Windows repair disc

O
ne of the most stomach-
churning moments in any PC 
user’s life is when you switch 
on your computer to do some work 
or let off some steam, only to find 
Windows won’t boot. You may get 
lucky—Windows 10 is smarter 
than previous versions, and can 
resolve certain issues on its own, 
but in many cases, you’re left in 
an endless reboot loop. Assuming 
Windows even gets that far.
If Windows can’t fix itself, what 
next? Do you have a recent backup 
of your data? What about Windows 
itself? Of course, it’s perfectly 
possible to reinstall Windows from 
scratch, but that’s the best part of 
a day lost to restoring your PC. And 
did we mention your data?
The solution lies in creating a 
bootable recovery disc—one that 
gives you the tools to repair most 
Windows woes, remove malware, 
and lets you pull data off the drive in 
case you’re forced to bite the bullet 
and reinstall. In an ideal world, you’d 
be able to build a single rescue disc 
to cover all your needs. Linux users 
can smirk at this point, and bring 
out their Live CDs, giving them full-
blown access to the OS they know 
and love. Wouldn’t it be great if you 
could do the same in Windows?
The answer is: you can. In this 
feature, we’ll show you how to 
create all the recovery media you’ll 
ever need. The first disc will give you 
access to basic Windows recovery 
options, plus allow you to reinstall 
Windows if all else fails. The second 
offers more quick fixes to resolve 
common boot and loading problems, 
plus 
provides 
opportunities 
to 
recover files and back up or restore 
disk images. The final disc gives you 
the closest thing to a Linux Live CD: 
a fully functioning Windows-like 
environment to work in, with tools 
to help you troubleshoot problems, 
get online, and even add your own 
custom apps to beat malware and 
perform other tasks.
The time to create this media 
is right now, while your PC is still 
working, so turn the page, 
and  protect 
y o u r s e l f 
a g a i n s t 
disaster.

ur first recovery disc is—as 
it’s always been—the humble 
Windows installation disc. Can’t boot 
into  Windows? Boot from this instead, 
choosing the “Repair your computer” option 
when prompted. From here, you can attempt 
to fix startup problems automatically, 
launch System Restore to try rolling back 
to a previously working installation, or 
even restore Windows from a disk image. 
Advanced users can dig deeper, with access 
to the command prompt, too.
These days, most of us don’t bother 
with DVDs, so it’s unlikely that you’ve got 
any installation media to hand. Let’s begin, 
then, by rectifying that situation. Start by 
typing “recovery” into the Cortana search 
box, then choose “Create a recovery drive.” 
You’re prompted to back up system files to 
it, which effectively creates a full-blown 
reinstall disc—you need an 8GB flash drive 
if you go down this route. Alternatively, 
uncheck the “Back up system files to the 
recovery drive” box, and make do with the 
basic repair options—in which case, all you 
need is a 512MB USB flash drive, although 
you won’t be able to reinstall Windows if you 
go down this route.
(Note: If you want to create a bootable 
DVD, you need the Media Creation Tool—
download the latest version from www.
microsoft.com/software-download/
windows10, and choose the ISO option when 
creating media for another PC, then right-
click this file, and choose “Burn disc image” 
to burn your disc.)
From here, if Windows fails to boot, 
pop in your installation disc or drive, and 
either make it your first bootable device in 
the BIOS, or look for an option to choose 
the boot device at startup, choosing the 
rescue media when prompted—note, if 
you’re shown two options (typically “UEFI” 
and “USB”), choose “UEFI.” From here, you 
can follow the prompts to hopefully bring 
your PC back to life, or—if all other avenues 
fail—reinstall Windows from scratch.
Beyond 
the  
basics
The Windows repair 
tool is all well and 
good, but there are 
times when it can’t 
help. It can’t disinfect your malware-
infested drive, for example, and neither can 
you easily copy files from a badly mangled 
Windows installation, before formatting the 
drive, and starting again. If you want to 
protect yourself against either of these two 
possibilities, you need to augment it with 
something else. 
Most antimalware vendors offer a 
recovery disc solution that specializes in 
rooting out malware—see the box opposite 
for details about creating a fourth recovery 
O
disc if you decide against the full-blown 
Live CD option later on in this feature. In the 
meantime, our second recovery disc takes 
things one step further than the Windows 
install disc. Lazesoft Recovery Suite Home 
Edition is free (for non-commercial use), so 
start by downloading and installing it from 
www.lazesoft.com/lazesoft-recovery-
suite-free.html.
Lazesoft Recovery Suite contains four 
key components, all of which can be run 
directly from Windows (even in Safe mode). 
Of course, we’re interested in building 
recovery boot media, so after launch, click 
the “Burn CD/USB Disk” link. You’re asked 
to specify the target version of Windows—
leave the default “DO NOT specify” setting 
applied for Windows 10 support, then click 
“Next.” Choose your target media: CD/DVD, 
USB, or ISO file, then click “Start.” Once 
created, check out the box over the page to 
find out what sort of problems Lazesoft can 
attempt to fix.
Onward 
and  
upward
Lazesoft 
Recovery 
Suite is well worth 
using in case it can fix 
your problem with 
just a few clicks, but what if it can’t? In an 
ideal world, you’d be able to boot into a more 
complete Windows-like environment—one 
that employs the familiar point-and-click 
interface, while giving you access to a wider 
range of tools, full Internet access (being 
able to research error messages online 
could be a crucial step toward solving your 
problem), and more besides.

possible—Microsoft produces a specialized

version of Windows called Windows PE, 
with “PE” standing for “Pre-installation 
Environment.” It’s designed to be run 
directly from removable media, and has 
been adapted over the years by various 
individuals to provide recovery discs 
that  can give you the best of all worlds—
think Bart PE (based on Windows XP) and 
AOMEI PE Builder (Windows 7 or 8, but 
not 8.1 or 10).
One of the most successful PE-building 
tools is WinBuilder, and one user-friendly 
variant for Windows 10 comes in the form of 
Win10PESE. It’s a flexible custom recovery 
tool builder that enables you to incorporate 
additional apps and tools if you need them, 
and can be burned to DVD or USB flash 
drive (1GB or larger).

(the <date> corresponds to the latest build

to follow.
One of those steps involves giving the

doesn’t count. Instead, click the “Microsoft

Malware recovery discs
One of malware’s nastiest 
tricks is to cripple your PC 
so it’s virtually impossible 
to clean. The malware 
typically suppresses 
known security tools from 
running, plus locks down 
your system in various 
ways, such as restricting 
which websites you can 
visit, barring access to 
Registry Editor, and even 
crippling Safe mode, inside 
which most antimalware 
tools can at least attempt 
to clean up the mess. To be 
fair, Windows 10 makes it 
hard enough to access Safe 
mode these days, so we’re 
not sure why malware 
bothers, but we digress.
The solution here lies 
in visiting your security 
vendor’s site to locate 
recovery media that 
includes a special version 
of your antimalware 
product that has network 
access to update itself, 
then focuses on detecting 
and cleaning malware. 
Depending on the tool 
and the infection, you 
should find any collateral 
damage has also been 
repaired, although tools 
such as Windows Repair 
(www.tweaking.com) and 
Complete Internet Repair 
(www.rizonesoft.com) can 
be used in Windows proper 
after the malware has been 
scrubbed if this doesn’t 
prove to be the case.
These tools are 
completely free to use, 
so you don’t need to be 
a paying purchaser of a 
particular package to use 
it. Just download the ISO 
file to the hard drive of a 
clean, working PC, then 
right-click it, and choose 
“Burn disc image” to burn 
a DVD from it, or use a tool 
such as Rufus (https://
rufus.akeo.ie) to create a 
bootable USB flash drive 
from the ISO’s contents, 
if the vendor in question 
doesn’t provide a live CD/
USB creation tool.
Major antimalware 
vendors offering bootable 
recovery discs include 
Kaspersky (https://
support.kaspersky.
co.uk/4162), Norton 
(https://security.symantec.
com/nbrt/nbrt.aspx), 
ESET (www.eset.com/int/
support/sysrescue), and 
AVG (www.avg.com/ww-
en/download.prd-arl). Just 
Google your antimalware 
vendor and the words 
“recovery disc” or “rescue 
disc” to see if it’s covered.

Fix Windows boot problems
Lazesoft Recovery Suite 
offers a number of handy 
tools for fixing problems 
with Windows, plus it can 
help you recover data, 
too. Once created, reboot 
your PC from the Lazesoft 
rescue media. You’ll 
eventually find yourself 
at the main Lazesoft 
Recovery Suite, with four 
recovery-based options: 
“Windows Recovery,” 
“Data Recovery,” “Disk 
Image & Clone,” and 
“Password Recovery.”
All four options are 
largely self-explanatory. 
Before running any 
recovery tools, we 
recommend taking a drive 
image of your current 
setup, which ensures you 
can always roll things 
back should the cure prove 
worse than the malady. 
Select “Disk Image & 
Clone,” and choose “Drive 
to Image” to back up to a 
suitable external drive. 
Second, “Data Recovery” 
contains the full range 
of data recovery options, 
including simply pulling 
off regular files, as well 
as searching for lost and 
deleted files and partitions. 
“Windows Recovery” 
attempts to fix your boot 
problems, offering a wide 
range of options across a 
series of tabs. There’s also 
a one-click solution if you’d 
prefer the software to try 
to diagnose and repair on 
its own, with an “Undo” 
button that promises to 
reverse any changes made 
if the problem isn’t fixed or 
gets worse. 
If this fails, try the other 
options: “BootCrash,” 
“LoadingCrash,” and 
“RandomCrash.” Each 
one steps you through a 
series of potential fixes 
to try, from repairing 
the MBR and restoring 
missing or corrupted 
files, such as Ntosknl.exe 
(“BootCrash”), to running 
memory diagnostics, and 
recovering the Registry 
(“RandomCrash”).
The final tool—
”Password Recovery”—
promises to reset your 
Windows password if 
you’ve forgotten it, plus 
can reveal your Windows 
and Office product keys, 
should you need them. The 
former option only works 
with local passwords—in 
other words, if you sign 
in to Windows using 
your Microsoft Account, 
you need to visit https://
account.live.com/
password/reset to try to  
fix the problem.
the time to expand the “WriteMedia” 
section. If your PC has a 64-bit UEFI (check 
with the manufacturer), select the “Copy 
to USB-Device” box; if not, select “Copy to 
USB-Device BCD Bootloader” instead, and 
check “Add Grub2-EFI (x64 UEFI only)” 
to ensure it boots. Click the folder button 
under “Please select the root directory 
of your USB-Device,” to select the correct 
drive letter if necessary, then click “Copy to 
USB” to build your recovery drive from the 
ISO you just created.
Beyond the basics
Take it 
for a test 
drive
You can now test the 
recovery 
drive 
by 
booting from it in the 
same way you’d boot 
from the previous two recovery options. A 
menu appears—select “Win10PESE” to 
boot into your recovery environment. When 
the desktop environment pops up, you’re 
prompted 
to 
choose 
your 
network 
connection type, if one is detected—the 
default DHCP is automatically selected 
after a five-second pause.
You then find yourself at a close 
approximation of the Windows 10 desktop, 
albeit one employing a more “classic” 
Windows 
look 
and 
feel. 
You’ll 
see 
convenient shortcuts to File Explorer, the 
Command Prompt, and PENetwork on both 
the Taskbar and desktop—there’s also a 
shortcut to Firefox, giving you access to 
the web. PENetwork merely launches the 
network manager, which should already be 
running and accessible from the Taskbar 
Notification area, alongside other controls, 
including one that enables you to set a 
different desktop resolution if you wish 
(note this feature doesn’t work very well on 
UEFI systems—you’re likely to find only the 
1920x1080 and 1024x768 options work).
Click the “Start” button, and select “All 
Programs” to see what tools and utilities 
are included with the vanilla Win10PESE 
disc—shortcuts to critical Control Panel 
and system management applets are 
included, as are a handful of file-related 
tools 
(including 
7-Zip), 
BootICE 
(for 
managing the boot manager), a PDF viewer, 
and some handy system tools, including 
Remote Regedit (for manipulating your 
Registry in case your boot problems stem 
from there), as well as access to the System 
Recovery options found in Windows itself.
These tools are all welcome and helpful, 
but you may be hankering after different 
tools and utilities—you may even simply 
want to be able to run a particular app, such 
as a word processor, while you try to fix your 
boot problem. The good news is that your 
Win10PESE environment can support third-
party applications and programs, too. 
We say “some” because, while certain 
program installers work, on the whole 
you’re limited to portable apps, namely 
those that run directly from a folder. You 
can download these from the Internet (look 
under X:\Users\Default for the Downloads 
folder), but be sure to copy portable apps 
and key files to another drive if you want 
to keep them for another session—the “X” 
drive resides only in memory, which means 
it’s wiped the moment you reboot.
Lazesoft provides a wide range of data 
recovery tools.

Add apps to your drive
Why plug in another USB 
drive, or download tools 
from the net, when you 
can embed any portable 
tool directly into your 
recovery drive? Once 
embedded, the tools can be 
directly accessed through 
Win10PESE’s Start menu, 
or via an icon in the Taskbar 
Notification area.
To add apps to your 
drive, first expand the 
“Apps > Portable” section 
in Win10PESE’s left-hand 
pane, then check “PStart 
and Papps.” Next, click 
the “Open Source Folder” 
button to open the folder 
where your portable apps 
need to be collected, 
each one inside its own 
folder. Once you’ve copied 
them into here, return to 
Win10PESE, and carefully 
enter the folder name of 
each app under “Directory 
of Apps,” plus the name of 
the program’s executable 
file under “Name of exe.” 
To add a shortcut to the 
Start menu, check “Start 
menu,” and then specify 
the folder (get this from 
Projects\Win10PESE\
Apps), and shortcut name; 
you can add a desktop 
shortcut, too, by checking 
the appropriate box. 
Finally, if you’re burning a 
DVD, rather than creating 
a USB recovery drive, 
be sure to select “Run 
from RAM” to allow any 
antimalware tools to 
download and process 
updates. Then create the 
disc in the usual way.
What sort of portable 
apps should you be looking 
to add to your toolkit? 
Two recommended 
antimalware tools are 
Emsisoft Emergency Kit 
(www.emsisoft.com/en/
software/eek), which 
utilizes two antimalware 
engines, and Malwarebytes 
Junkware Removal Tool 
(www.malwarebytes.com/
junkwareremovaltool) 
for PUPs.
Piriform (www.piriform.
com) provides portable 
versions of CCleaner 
(cleanup tool), Recuva 
(data recovery), and Speccy 
(system information). 
Another data recovery tool 
worth adding is DMDE Free 
(https://dmde.com), while 
a wide array of tools, from 
alternative browsers, to 
disk encryption, to drive 
health monitoring utilities, 
can be found at www.
portableapps.com.
Finally, if there’s a 
specific utility you want, 
check with the vendor’s 
website—often, you 
can find portable builds 
buried away in the 
downloads section.
Bring  
Your  
Own
Luckily, you have a 
number of options 
should you wish to 
build 
up 
a 
more 
permanent collection of tools and utilities. 
Portable apps can be stored on another 
drive—a USB flash drive, say, or shared 
network folder. Access them via the 
Windows PE environment when needed.
A more elegant solution, and one that 
incorporates your applications directly into 
your recovery drive (with shortcuts through 
the Start menu), is to follow the “Add apps 
to your drive” box on the right. Also take 
the time to explore some of the other 
options that Win10PESE provides. Explore 
the various sections of the disk-creation 
tool; expand “Shell,” for example, and you 
can change the packaged Start menu, 
plus configure its appearance. Expand 
“Components,” and you can choose which 
Windows tools and accessories to include—
add the .NET Framework to support a wider 
range of applications, for example.
If you have a virtual Windows machine to 
hand using a tool such as VirtualBox (www.
virtualbox.org), use it to test your recovery 
disc—open 
“VirtualTest,” 
and 
select 
“VirtualBox Emulation” to set up a dedicated 
virtual machine to test the ISO file with. It’s 
a great way to check to see what effect your 
tweaks have, without having to recreate a 
USB flash drive or boot from your PC each 
time. But do remember to test the final disc 
or drive on your actual PC when you’ve got it 
working to your satisfaction, to make sure.
Trouble-
shoot 
your PC
Your recovery discs 
have been created, 
waiting for the time 
they’ll be needed. 
Now your PC is refusing to boot, and you’ve 
whisked out your recovery discs. What to 
do? First, we recommend taking a drive 
image of the system partitions before you 
start attempting to fix things. Use Lazesoft 
for this task, unless you have an emergency 
boot disc coupled to your existing system 
imaging tool (such as Macrium Reflect 
Free), in which case use that.
With the drive image in place, you can 
start to attempt a fix for your problem. 
Begin with your Windows installation disc, 
to see if its Automatic Repair tool can get 
Windows up and running again. Make 
a careful note of any error messages if 
the problem persists, then move on to 
Lazesoft’s Windows Recovery component 
(see the box on the previous page). If 
Lazesoft’s fix-it tools fail to fix your loading 
problems, bring out the Win10PESE disc. 
Boot from this, then use the tools onboard 
—such as Remote Regedit—to try to fix 
known problems. Don’t forget your Internet 
connection—use Firefox to browse for 
possible solutions to error messages, 
plus download additional software you 
might need, but didn’t include on the disc. 
This is particularly handy if you’re battling 
malware infections—you can track down 
specific removal tools, or locate your 
vendor’s portable scanning toolkit, should 
our other suggestions fail to yield results. 
Win10PESE enables you to run portable 
apps from other drives.

There’s an art to system building. 
It starts with a thought, a concept, an 
idea. A conscious spark permeates the 
air as you home in on what, exactly, it 
is you want to construct. That first 
thought is often intrinsically connected 
to the next two decisions in any given 
system: What processor should you 
use, and which form factor? ATX, ITX? 
Micro? XL? Then, how many add-in 
cards will you be using? And among 
the myriad flexible, rotating questions, 
you arrive at one of the more important 
decisions: Which chassis?
Surprisingly, many people forsake 
this decision, because it adds little, 
if any, obvious performance. It is, 
however, the backbone of any good 
rig—as crucial as the motherboard, 
as artistic as in-game graphical frame 
rates, and as vital to cooling as any 
liquid-chilled all-in-one.
It’s that art of design that Corsair 
has perfected here. The Crystal 570X 
is a masterpiece of folded metal and 
tempered glass, glinting in the sunshine 
as the componentry lies inside, primed 
and ready for the computational 
challenge of the day. This is the top of 
the top, the masterstroke of Corsair’s 
Genius. It’s a joy to build in, and a beauty 
to behold. –ZAK STOREY

It’s complicated
Forget 
curved 
panels, 
frame 
synching, 4K, and high refresh rates. 
There’s a new technology that might 
just blow them all away for sheer 
visual pop. It’s all about searing 
brightness and even deeper blacks. 
It’s about dramatically increasing 
the numbers of colors a monitor can 
display. And it’s coming soon to a PC 
near you. Get ready for HDR, people.
The basic concept of HDR (high 
dynamic range) is simple. It means 
stretching out the extremes of display 
capability—delivering more, even 
when that means less. But it’s hard 
to point at any one feature and say, 
“This is HDR.” Nor is it easy to define 
in terms of numbers. There is no one 
metric that definitively determines 
what an HDR display is. Instead, 
there’s a number of standards that 
are competing to become the de facto 
definition of HDR.
This is going to cause confusion. 
Some monitor makers are likely to 
play a little fast and loose with how 
screens are marketed. Distinguishing 
between what you might call a full-
HDR feature set and its constituent 
parts, such as wider color gamuts, 
is going to be a challenge both for 
marketeers and consumers. It’s even 
tricky to define in terms of where 
it lies in the display chain. Game 
developers have talked about HDR 
rendering for years. But no games 
have output HDR visuals, and there 
were no displays to support that.
Nevertheless, 
HDR 
technology 
is rapidly becoming the norm in the 
HDTV market, and it’s coming to the 
PC. So here’s all you need to know.

What, exactly, constitutes an HDR display? 
Or should that be an HDR-10 display? Or 
maybe UHD Premium? Hang on, what about 
Rec. 2020? And BT.2100, SMPTE 2084, 12-
bit color, and wide gamuts?
From the get go, HDR display technology 
presents a problem. It’s difficult to define. 
Already, armies of competing standards are 
attempting to occupy HDR’s high ground. 
Perhaps the best place to start, therefore, 
is to understand what HDR attempts to 
achieve. The aim is to simulate reality. Or, 
more specifically, to converge with the 
acuity or abilities of the human eye.
That’s because the human eye has 
limitations beyond which it is futile to 
aspire. There are things in the real world 
that humans can’t perceive, whether that’s 
brightness, or colors, or granular detail. So, 
there’s little point in trying to replicate them 
on a display. However, for the most part, 
what we can perceive still exceeds what 
displays are capable of. HDR, like several 
other technologies, aims to close that gap.
A handy example is Apple’s Retina 
displays. Pack the pixels in a display close 
enough together, and the photo receptor 
cells in the retina—more specifically, the 
fovea, the most densely populated area of 
the retina—can no longer 
distinguish them individually. 
You’ve matched that aspect of 
the eye’s capability. Adding 
more pixels will not improve 
image quality as perceived 
by humans. Of course, in this 
context, much depends on the 
distance between the eye and 
the screen. The further away the viewing 
point, the more densely packed the pixels 
appear. Apple isn’t even consistent about 
what a Retina display is, and even the most 
detailed Retina display probably only has 
around one third the pixel density required 
to truly match the capability of the human 
eye. But the ambition to close the gap on 
the eye’s capabilities is what matters, and 
it’s what HDR is trying to do, too, only with 
different aspects of human vision.
The aspects relevant to HDR are broadly 
captured by the notions of brightness and 
color. HDR display technology aims to offer 
a broader range of both. HDR isn’t about 
adding ever more pixels. It’s about making 
each pixel work harder and look punchier. 
Better pixels, not more.
The 
problem 
is 
that 
HDR 
isn’t 
synonymous with a single metric. Color 
depth, contrast, and brightness are all in 
the mix. But no single aspect encompasses 
everything that makes for a brave new HDR 
display. Moreover, multiple HDR standards 
exist. Here’s an excerpt from the definition of 
one of them, Rec. 2100, that gives a flavor of 
the complexity involved: “Rec. 2100 defines 
the high dynamic range (HDR) formats. The 
HDR formats are Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG), 
which was standardized as ARIB STD-B67, 
and the Perceptual Quantizer (PQ), which 
was standardized as SMPTE ST 2084. HDR-
10 uses PQ, a bit-depth of 10 bits, and the 
Rec. 2020 color space. UHD Phase A defines 
HLG10 as HLG, a bit-depth of 10-bits, and 
the Rec. 2020 color space, and defines PQ10 
as PQ, a bit-depth of 10 bits, and the Rec. 
2020 color space.”
See what we mean? Anyway, let’s dig 
into the meaning of HDR, starting with 
color. You may be familiar with the notion 
of color channels and, more specifically, the 
number of bits per channel—for instance, 
6-bit or 8-bit. To cut a long story short, 
colors in a display are created by combining 
three primary channels in the form of 
subpixels—red, green, and blue, and hence 
RGB—to give a final target color. The bits 
per channel refer to the range of intensities 
available for each primary color channel. 
By varying the intensities, a range of colors 
is created, which is a mathematical function 
of the combined three channels.
Billion color question
By way of example, 8-bit-per-channel color, 
which until recently has represented the 
high end of consumer display technology, 
enables 16 million colors. Increase the 
color depth to 10 bits per channel, and the 
result is a billion colors. Take it up another 
notch to 12-bit, and we’re talking 68 billion 
You’ll need HDMI 2.0a connectivity to 
hook a PC up to an HDR TV.
For the most part, what we can 
perceive still exceeds what displays 
are capable of. HDR, like several other 
technologies, aims to close that gap.
Quantum dot tech will be an 
enabler for HDR monitors.

colors. That’s a lot. So how does that map to 
the capabilities of the human eye?
The target here, or at least one target, is 
something known as Pointer’s Gamut. It’s a 
set of colors that includes every hue that can 
be reflected off a real-world surface, and 
seen by the human eye. How it is calculated 
probably doesn’t matter. Nor does the fact 
that there’s a fair bit of variance from one 
human to the next. What is notable is that 
it’s only reflected colors—not luminescent 
colors, which can’t be fully reflected off 
material surfaces. Hence, even if a display 
completely captures Pointer’s Gamut, it 
doesn’t cover everything the eye can see.
However, Pointer’s Gamut is far larger 
than the standard color spaces or gamuts 
of PC monitors. By way of example, the full 
UHD Premium specification (which is one of 
several HDR specs) includes a color space 
known as Rec. 2020. It very nearly covers 
100 percent of Pointer’s Gamut. The most 
common color space PC monitors support 
is sRGB, which only covers a bit more than 
two thirds of the colors of Pointer’s Gamut.
But supporting sRGB isn’t the same 
as fully achieving sRGB. In other words, 
your current sRGB screen probably can’t 
achieve the full range of sRGB colors, which 
is a space that’s significantly smaller than 
Pointer’s Gamut, which in turn doesn’t 
encompass every color the human eye can 
perceive. Put simply, your screen may look 
nice, but odds are that it’s pretty crappy at 
creating colors by any objective metric.
To grasp that difference in numbers, 
simply recall those bits-per-channel. UHD 
Premium requires a minimum of 10 bits per 
channel, or a billion colors. Unless you have 
a high-end pro display with 10-bit color, an 
HDR screen means a massive jump from 
around 16 million to at least a billion colors.
The other major part of the HDR equation 
is, effectively, contrast. It’s a bit 
more complicated than that because 
true HDR capability goes beyond 
mere contrast. To understand why, 
consider a display that can fully switch 
off any given pixel. In other words, a display 
capable of rendering true black tones. 
Strictly speaking, this is virtually, though 
not absolutely, impossible for an LCD 
monitor—there is always some leakage 
of light through the liquid crystals. It’s 
theoretically possible to have an individual 
When it comes to 
inches-per-buck, TVs 
have usually looked 
cheap compared to 
dedicated PC monitors. 
But big-screen TVs 
haven’t always made 
great monitors, mainly 
due to the relatively low 
resolution of TVs. Even 
a full 1080p HDTV is low 
res compared to many 
PC monitors. 
Moreover, when you 
stretch that 1920x1080 
pixel grid over a 40, 
50, or 60-inch panel, 
the result is big, fat, 
ugly pixels. Yuck. 
With the advent of 4K 
resolutions, however, 
things changed. A 4K 
40-inch TV makes for 
a similar pixel pitch as 
a 27-inch 2560x1440 
resolution monitor. 
Ideal. But the first 4K 
TVs suffered from 
another historical TV 
shortcoming: low-fi 
display interfaces. 
Many couldn’t accept a 
4K signal with a refresh 
rate above 30Hz. Fine 
for movies, no good for 
a PC monitor.
However, with the 
wider adoption of HDMI 
2.0, it was possible 
to drive a 4K HDTV at 
60Hz from a PC video 
card. Suddenly, using 
a relatively cheap 4K 
HDTV as a PC monitor 
made sense. The same 
thinking applies to HDR 
TVs. Granted, there 
are limits to how big 
it’s practical to go with 
a PC monitor. And the 
fat, ugly pixel problem 
reappears as sizes 
extend toward 50 inches 
and beyond. But 4K TVs 
with at least partial 
HDR support, such as 
the Samsung KU6300 
series, can be had for 
little more than $400 
for the 40-inch model. 
That’s one hell of a deal.
However, such a 
screen won’t have 
much, if anything, by 
way of PC-friendly 
features. Forget 
driving it beyond 60Hz. 
It almost definitely 
won’t have adaptive 
sync technology, such 
as Nvidia’s G-Sync or 
AMD’s FreeSync. It may 
not offer the greatest 
pixel response. But 
perhaps the biggest 
killer, especially for 
gaming, is input lag. 
For HDTVs, a bit of 
input lag isn’t a major 
concern. On the PC, it’s 
downright horrible. The 
moral of this particular 
story, then, is that it’s 
absolutely essential to 
try before you buy.
HDR for $400
and active backlight for each, but that’s 
highly impractical. Instead, technologies 
where pixels create their own light are a 
far more efficient route to infinite contrast. 
Which is where OLED displays come in. But 
we digress, and you can read about OLED 
displays in the boxout over the page.
The point is that if you have true or nearly 
true blacks, almost any amount of light 
constitutes effectively infinite contrast by 
comparison. So even a really dim screen

to boast OLED screen tech.

would be capable of infinite contrast if the 
pixels were fully switchable, as per OLED. 
Thus HDR doesn’t just deal with relative 
values of brightness, but also absolutes. 
Again, by way of example, UHD Premium 
stipulates a maximum brightness of at least 
1,000cd/m2 for an LCD screen—roughly 
three times brighter than a typical LCD.
Backlight or black
As for how that’s achieved with existing LCD 
tech, obviously a more powerful backlight 
is needed. But, very likely, a backlight 
composed of subpixels (though not as many 
as the LCD panel), and thus capable of local 
dimming, is required. A single, big, dumb 
backlight cranking out massive brightness 
would enable greater brightness, but 
it would also guarantee that the black levels 
are very poor in some scenarios.
For an idea of what this combination of 
huge contrast and extreme brightness will 
enable, imagine the powerful flash of light 
as a car passes on a really bright day, and the 
glass momentarily reflects the sun directly 
into your eyes. Even an HDR screen won’t 
Probably the biggest 
challenge for anyone 
interested in HDR 
is knowing what to 
buy. At best, HDR is 
an umbrella term 
that covers a range 
of technologies and 
features. However, 
some standards are 
emerging that should 
make buying easier.
Currently, the 
two best established 
standards are HDR-
10 and Dolby Vision. 
The most obvious 
difference between 
the two is color 
depth. As its name 
suggests, HDR-10 
requires 10-bit 
per channel color 
capability, while 
Dolby Vision ups the 
ante to 12-bit. How 
much difference that 
will make in practice 
remains to be seen, 
but on paper, Dolby 
Vision is superior in 
that regard.
The other major 
difference is support 
for brightness. 
HDR-10 supports 
up to 1,000cd/m2 
of brightness for 
LCD displays, while 
Dolby Vision goes up 
to 4,000cd/m2, with 
plans to support 
10,000cd/m2 in  
the future. Again, 
Dolby Vision is 
superior, and it 
is likewise much 
more expensive. 
What’s not clear is 
whether PC monitor 
manufacturers will 
adopt either of these 
standards. Making 
matters even more 
complicated is the 
fact that a monitor 
may have some HDR 
capabilities without 
being marketed as an 
HDR display. That’s 
especially true of 
any OLED PC display. 
OLED panels have 
very high contrast 
capabilities. Indeed, 
an OLED display 
is only required to 
generate around 
half the brightness 
of an LCD display to 
comply with the HDR-
10 standard for that 
very reason. 
Complicating 
things even 
further, the UHD 
Premium standard 
adopts HDR-10 as 
a subsection of its 
requirements. So 
it’s another label you 
may see attached to 
a display, even if it’s 
not a separate HDR 
standard in a strict 
sense. Ultimately, it’s 
early days for HDR 
displays, and it’s not 
clear which standard 
(or standards) will 
become the norm on 
the PC.
A Question of 
Standards
put out real-world levels of light for such 
events. But the effect of simulating them on 
screen will be far, far more realistic. 
Displays that capture much or all of 
these new color, contrast, and brightness 
capabilities already exist. HDR is the latest 
big thing in HDTVs, and using an HDR HDTV 
as a monitor is an option for PC enthusiasts. 
HDR is also a new feature in the latest 
refresh of games consoles from Microsoft 
and Sony. But that same technology is 
coming to screens designed to be used with 
PCs. The downside is that it will likely come 
in many confusing forms. Already, there are 
inconsistencies with terminology, such as 
“4K” and “UHD,” which are used virtually 
interchangeably but are not the same.
Then there’s the likelihood that some 
monitors will support certain aspects 
of what’s known as HDR, but not others. 
For instance, you could argue that, for 
PC gaming, what matters is the contrast 
and brightness aspects of HDR, along 
with speed, in terms of pixel response. So 
you might not want a more expensive and 
slower LCD panel that’s required to deliver 
Even Asus’s latest 34-inch RoG 
might look pedestrian when the 
first HDR monitors arrive.
Could HDR, rather than VR, be the 
next big thing in PC gaming?

high dynamic range

If there’s anything 
that proves what a 
nightmare technology 
HDR is to wrap one’s 
gray matter around, it’s 
surely gaming. After 
all, PC game developers 
and graphics hardware 
vendors have been 
talking about how 
great HDR gaming is 
for years.
But if the first 
HDR displays are only 
just emerging now, 
how could PC games 
have been HDR for 
years? The answer to 
that is actually fairly 
simple. Some games 
have been rendering 
to HDR targets for 
some time. It’s just the 
output from the game 
engine is compressed 
or tone-mapped down 
from HDR to SDR format 
before being sent to 
the display. So the HDR 
claims weren’t a lie in 
strict terms, but it’s 
questionable just how 
much benefit internal 
HDR rendering was 
when the output and the 
display technology was 
all SDR.
Whatever, with the 
arrival of bona fide HDR 
display technology, the 
PC games industry is 
boning up to support 
full HDR visuals. In 
fact, it’s partly being 
driven by the adoption 
of HDR technology in the 
latest round of games 
console refreshes from 
Microsoft and Sony.
What’s more, 
converting an existing 
SDR PC game to HDR 
is not a particularly 
onerous task. 
Straightforward 
mapping processes 
can expand SDR color 
maps to HDR ranges via 
algorithmic translation 
without massive effort. 
So, there’s a good 
chance that patches 
adding HDR support to 
existing games could 
become widespread in 
the near future. Nvidia 
is reportedly working 
on an HDR patch for 
Rise of the Tomb Raider, 
for instance. But it will 
probably be games 
with console siblings, 
such as the Forza, 
Battlefield, and Gears 
of War series, that will 
be the first games to get 
full HDR capability on 
the PC. It’s also worth 
remembering that just 
about anything, be it 
games or HD video, will 
look better on a proper 
HDR display, even if 
the content itself isn’t 
mapped for HDR output.
Gaming in HDR
the wider color gamuts. You might want 
what amounts to an HDR backlight with 
local dimming, combined with a TN panel 
with relatively limited colors. But would 
that be an HDR monitor? Or something 
else? Tricky. Other displays may take up 
the broader color gamut, and leave off the 
local dimming. It’s very early days, and 
it will probably take a few years to shake 
out, especially when you factor in the likely 
coming transition from LCD tech to OLED.
Speaking of that transition, it’s yet to 
be seen how PC monitor manufacturers 
will achieve HDR capabilities. If LCD tech 
is used, a backlight with local dimming is 
required to achieve the extreme contrast 
ratios. Quantum dot tech can also be used 
to bolster the range of colors on offer in 
combination with a 10-bit or 12-bit LCD 
panel. But arguably, any attempt to achieve 
HDR visuals via LCD tech is a bit of a kludge.
Instead, OLED displays with pixels that 
are their own light source are a much more 
efficient way to do things. What’s more, 
OLED technology lends itself better, in cost 
terms, to more compact PC displays than 
massive HDTVs. It’s a similar rationale 
that has seen OLED become common in 
smartphones. Very likely, therefore, HDR 
LCD monitors will be at best a stopgap 
before OLED becomes the dominant 
solution. With that in mind, it might make 
sense to consider a cheap HDR LCD TV as 
your own stopgap solution, while we wait for 
OLED HDR monitors to become affordable.
Can you have it all?
Things get even more complicated with the 
technologies needed to achieve UHD color 
depths beyond the screen itself. With all 
those colors and ranges of intensity, HDR is 
seriously bandwidth hungry. HDMI 2.0, for 
instance, can’t do the full 12-bit per channel 
at 60fps and 4K resolution—for that you 
need HDMI 2.0a. Upping the refresh rate to 
120Hz and beyond only makes the bandwidth 
limitation worse. In other words, a display 
that does it all—120Hz-plus, adaptive-sync, 
HDR, the lot—isn’t coming any time soon. 
Even when it does, your existing video card 
almost certainly won’t cope when gaming.
You’ll also require a compliant video card 
to enable HDR visuals. For Nvidia GPUs, 
that’s Maxwell or Pascal families (GTX 960, 
GTX 980, GTX 1070, GTX 1080, and so on). 
For AMD, its Radeon R9 300 Series can do 
HDR at 60Hz up to 2560x1600. For full 4K 
60Hz HDR output, only the latest Polaris 
boards, such as the RX 480, can pull it off.
Then there’s the question of content. In 
terms of video, there’s very little out there. 
It was only in 2014 that the Blu-ray standard 
was updated to support 10-bit per channel 
color. HDR photos are in more plentiful 
supply. Even most smartphones support 
HDR image capture, achieved by capturing 
the same image multiple times with a range 
of exposures, then combining the results 
into a single image. In theory, HDR video 
capture works the same way, it’s just harder 
to achieve because of the need to process so 
much data in real time. As for games, much 
of the early HDR content on the PC will likely 
be driven by the parallel emergence of HDR 
tech on games consoles (see boxout above).
HDR is one hell of a complicated 
technology: Currently, it’s not clear when 
the first dedicated HDR monitors will go 
on sale, which standards they will conform 
to, or how much they will cost. But HDR is 
coming. So we’d better get ready.

Water 
Damage
This week, a work colleague of 
mine approached me with a slight 
conundrum. He’d managed to spill a 
half-drunk can of Coke into a system 
fan at top of his build, which proceeded 
to distribute the sugary liquid 
throughout the entire rig. With him 
convinced that his power supply had 
failed, I offered to dissect the build to 
see just what exactly had died. 
After swapping out the PSU and 
noting that the system still refused 
to power on, I checked the old power 
supply. Disconnecting all the power 
connectors on the motherboard and 
GPU, and making sure the switch at 
the back was set to off, I then bridged 
the 24-pin with a small paperclip, and 
turned it on again (a trick taken from 
liquid cooling, to prime a loop). The 
system fans and hard drives whirred 
into life, indicating the PSU was fine. 
I then pulled the GTX 970 out of 
the dead system, and plopped it on to 
our test bed—sure enough, the test 
bed refused to boot, indicating that 
the GPU was causing a short circuit—
judging by the smell emanating 
from the card, it wasn’t particularly 
surprising. After doing the same with 
the Intel Core i5-4690K and DDR3, 
it was a simple case of plugging 
everything back in except the GPU, 
and watching the system light up and 
power on as normal. Conclusion? Our 
Events Manager is a bit clumsy, and is 
now $300 poorer as he needs to fork 
out for a 3GB GTX 1060 to replace the 
aging Gigabyte card.
Amazon “Bargains”
We love bargains. And the best place to look nowadays seems 
to be Amazon. However, a deal might not be quite what it 
seems, with resellers artificially bumping prices up just so 
they can reduce them the next day. A good way to check is the 
nifty website at http://camelcamelcamel.com. Copy and paste 
the product URL into the top bar, and it gives you a breakdown 
of how the price has fluctuated over the last few months.

BACKGROUND
Today marks our first ever teardown of a phone designed 
entirely by Google: the Pixel XL. What to expect? At first 
glance, it bears more than a passing resemblance to an 
iPhone—but it’s the innards in which we’re interested…
MAJOR TECH SPECS
• 5.5-inch AMOLED display, with QHD 1440x2560 resolution 
(534 ppi), and 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4
• Quad-core, 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor 
(2.15GHz + 1.6GHz), with 4GB LPDDR4 RAM
• 12.3-megapixel, f/2.0 main camera, with phase detection 
autofocus, and laser detection autofocus; 8MP selfie camera
• 32GB or 128GB built-in storage
• Pixel Imprint back-mounted fingerprint sensor
• USB Type-C port and 3.5mm headphone port
• Android 7.1 Nougat
KEY FINDINGS
• Given the familiarity of this iPhone lookalike, our confidence 
nears cockiness as we take a play from our iPhone 7 Plus 
guides, heat an iOpener, and select our lucky opening pick. 
After a minute of heat and a minute of prying, we lift open the 
phone from the top, expecting to expose its inner workings. 
But a screwed-down bracket on the display cable halts our 
progress. Time to dust off our driver, and dive a little deeper.
• The slim and rigid midframe is likely made of magnesium, 
and is clipped on to the body of the phone. When we say 
“rigid,” we expect it to not be “bendy.” We expected wrong. 
Oops! On the left, the midframe holds a mysterious ribbon 
connector and an earpiece speaker. And to the right, the rest 
of the phone, complete with motherboard in mat black.
• Two strips of strong adhesive secure this HTC-made battery, 
but the pull tab does its job without heat. This 13.28Wh 
battery beats the 11.1Wh iPhone 7 Plus, but not the Galaxy S7 
Edge, with its 13.86Wh powerhouse. Worthy of note: The 
Galaxy Note 7 packed a 13.48Wh battery before its demise.
• We really wanted to look at this motherboard, but were 
thwarted by a fingerprint sensor cable boobie trap! 
Fortunately, it’s easy to disarm. Next is another mini board 
with mic, and the rangefinder that enables laser autofocus. 
• Repairability Score: 6 out of 10 (10 is easiest to repair). Many 
components are modular, and can easily be replaced once 
the display assembly is removed. The battery has a removal 
tab, and is adhered by a modest amount of adhesive, making 
removal painless. All the screws are T5 Torx. The opening 
procedure requires prying up a thin, poorly-supported 
display assembly, making it difficult to open the phone 
without damage. In addition to screws, the midframe is 
secured by snug, press-fit notches, which make its removal 
(and subsequent repairs) laborious.

Relatively simple—eerily similar to Apple.

Introducing Sonic Pi
Sonic Pi comes preinstalled with Raspbian, but if you have an 
older installation, it’s possible that your version of Sonic Pi is 
quite old. It’s well worth updating the software installed on your Pi 
by opening a terminal, and typing the following:
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get upgrade
>> If you are prompted to confirm installation, please do so. With 
Sonic Pi installed, you can find the application in the “Programming” 
menu. Open the interface, and you’ll see that it is split into three 
vertically tiled panes. The top pane [Image B] contains a row of 
buttons that are used to control the playback of your composition, 
save the composition to a file, and also record the audio to a WAV file. 
Further buttons are used to reduce the text size of your code, align 
and indent code automatically, and access the Help/Preferences 
system. The center pane [Image C] contains the area in which code 
is written, which is split into a series of workspaces, enabling you 
to write multiple compositions or test logic in a spare workspace 
[Image D]. To the right of the code space is the Preferences area 
[Image E], where configuration changes can be made at the bottom. 
We also have the Help area [Image F], which contains extensive 
help documentation and example compositions.
This month, we’re serving up a selection of “phat beats” using nothing more than a Raspberry Pi 
[Image A] and Raspbian (which comes with Sonic Pi preinstalled). This is the personal project of 
Dr Sam Aaron, and the goal of Sonic Pi is to introduce creativity into programming via music, and 
reduce the friction that’s encountered by children learning to code – for example, the alignment and 
indentation of code, and syntax errors. 
Sonic Pi uses the Ruby programming language created in the mid 1990s by Yukihiro “Matz” 
Matsumoto, which was an easy-to-learn and syntax-friendly alternative to the languages of that 
time. Sonic Pi refines the Ruby language to provide a number of easy-to-use functions that enable 
learning. In this tutorial, we’re teaching the basics of Sonic Pi, then consolidating that knowledge 
with a piece of music. –LES pounder

Your first notes
Let’s start our musical adventure by playing a note. 
In the coding pane, type  play 60 . Now click “Run” 
on the top pane. You should hear the note play briefly. 
What does 60 mean? Well, it refers to the MIDI (Musical 
Instrument Digital Interface) numbering scheme, which 
is used in professional music production to cover the 
protocol by which data is sent to and from computers and 
digital instruments, but it also covers the connection made 
between the devices. The “60” note refers to a “c4” note, 
but we can just use the name of the note instead, so you 
could type  play :c4 .
>> If we wanted to play a series of notes, we could type 
out something like:
 play :c4
 sleep 1
 play :g4
 sleep 1
 play :d4
 sleep 1
This is a correct but rather long-winded approach. 
Instead, Sonic Pi enables you to play patterns of notes in 
the same manner with:
 play_pattern [ :c4, :g4, :d4 ]
>> Perhaps the notes are a little too slow for you? Well, 
Sonic Pi has you covered. To speed up the playback of a 
composition, we can set the beats per minute (BPM) for 
playing that pattern of notes faster:
 use_bpm 240
 play_pattern [ :c4, :g4, :d4 ]
3 
Using synths
OK, we can play a series of notes, but right now, it’s 
not very exciting, so let’s introduce another feature 
of Sonic Pi: synths.
>> Synths enable a note to be played with many different 
instruments, similar to electronic keyboards and other 
digital instruments. So let’s alter our code to use a synth:
 use_synth :dsaw
 play :c4
B
A
58

R&D

>> Click “Run” to hear the difference. Now that we can play a note 
with a synth, let’s put it into a loop to repeat playback. Sonic Pi can 
create an infinite loop using the  loop do...end  construct. Any code 
inside the loop repeats forever. To ensure that your code is properly 
indented, click the “Align” button in the top pane to automatically 
align the code:
 loop do
     use_synth :dsaw
     play :c4
     sleep 1
 end
>> Click “Run” and you hear the c4 note played once per second 
until “Stop” is clicked. But what if we want to iterate a loop for a set 
number of times? Ruby has an easy way to do this:
 2.times do
     use_synth :dsaw
     play :c4
     sleep 1
 end
4 
Playing Live
Another kind of loop is a live_loop. This is an infinite 
loop to be used when live coding a performance. 
Changes made to code inside a live_loop don’t instantly 
take effect—rather, they require the user to click “Run” 
to instigate the changes the next time the loop is run. 
Live_loops enable the user to create concurrency where 
multiple segments of code are working together to form 
the backdrop of our music. The syntax for a live_loop is 
similar to a standard loop, but requires a name to be given 
C
Dr Sam Aaron is a bright and bubbly 
individual, who knows his craft well and 
loves to show others, so it’s no surprise 
that he’s a big advocate of live coding, 
the practice of coding in front of a live 
audience. Sam was part of the band 
Meta-ex (http://meta-ex.com), along with 
Jonathan Graham. Together they merged 
coding with musical instruments to 
create unique performances, where the 
audience could see the code transform 
to match the tone and pace of the music.
At a recent OpenTech event, we 
saw open data, in the form of natural 
disaster data, being used to shape the 
notes used in a rather eclectic piece of 
music. The piece, co-produced by Leah 
Borromeo and Jamie Perera, used data 
sonification. However, this wasn’t a 
real-time project, which opens the door 
for Sonic Pi to be used with open data 
in a live coding exhibition. Data from a 
number of sources, such as newspapers, 
weather forecasts, and governments can 
be “mashed” into a live coding musical 
composition that can illustrate the 
subject of the data being used.

to the loop. So, let’s create a loop named “beat,” which incorporates 
the  play_pattern  function that we learned earlier. Then click 
“Run” to play.
 live_loop :beat do
    use_synth :dsaw
    play_pattern [ :c4, :g4, :d4 ]
    sleep 1
 end
>> Change the c4 note for an f4 note, and click “Run”—you should 
hear the note change in pitch accordingly. We can also play a 
pattern backward, using Ruby’s handy  .reverse  function, like so:
 live_loop :beat do
    use_synth :dsaw
    play_pattern [ :c4, :g4, :d4 ].reverse
    sleep 1
 end
5 
Randomize things
As well as playing notes forward and backward, we can also 
play random notes using two functions:
 play rrand(50, 100)
 play rrand_i(50, 100)
>> The first  rrand  can play any note between 50 and 100, 
including any floating point MIDI values, but the second  
 rrand_i  can only play integer-based MIDI values between 50 
and 100.
>> A common practice in programming is to create a function in 
which we can contain a block of code, then when we wish to use this 
code, we merely call the function by its name:
 define :loopy do
  use_bpm 480
  use_synth :dsaw
  play_pattern [ :c3, :c4, :c5, :c6 ]
  sleep 0.5
 end
 live_loop :testy do
  loopy
 end
>> In our example, we create a function called “loopy,” 
and use the  do...end  construct to store the code that will 
set the BPM to 480 beats per minute, and play a pattern 
using  dsaw synth , before sleeping for half a second. 
Inside a live_loop, we call the function “loopy” by its name, 
and the code contained inside is run.
6 
Using samples
The last Sonic Pi concept we’re introducing is 
samples. These are segments of audio that are pre-
recorded, and in the music industry, they are used often 
to embellish a song using clips from classic songs. To 
use a sample in a new live_loop, we need to recreate the 
following code below the existing  live_loop :beat :
 live_loop :samples do
    sample :loop_amen
    sleep sample_duration :loop_amen
 end
>> The sleep statement for this loop is unusual, because 
it doesn’t have an integer or float value visible. Rather, we 
instruct Sonic Pi to learn the duration of the sample used, 
and use that as the sleep value.
7 
Building our tune
Now that we have the basics under our belt, let’s 
start building our composition. Click on a blank 
workspace, and start your piece by creating a live_loop 
called “beat.” This will contain the code that forms the beat 
of our piece. Let’s put a sample inside the live_loop. When 
completed, click “Run” to hear the beat.
 live_loop :beat do
    sample :bd_haus
    sleep 0.5
 end
>> So, our beat is a sample played two times per second, 
which is a BPM of 120—quite quick and punchy. Let’s 
build upon the beat by creating another live_loop, which 
will contain a melody. Before we start the live_loop, we 
add some FX to our audio. To do this, we use the “reverb” 
FX plugin to add a spacious feel to the notes. We pass 
the “room  1” argument to instruct Sonic Pi to use the 
maximum-sized room available—in other words, this gives 
the sound the maximum available spacious sound. This 
melody uses the “beep” synth for any notes played. 
D
Minecraft on the Raspberry Pi has 
become the killer application to teach 
Python to classes, and Sonic Pi has 
attained the same status for its use of 
music. But what if there were a way to 
merge the musicality of Sonic Pi with the 
fun of building new worlds in Minecraft? 
Well, now there is, and from version 2.5 of 
Sonic Pi, you can also integrate Minecraft 
into your musical compositions. At  the 
time of writing, this is still a bleeding-
edge feature, but there’s already a 
great  deal of functionality available, 
such as getting the position of the player 
or a block, changing the position of 
the player and block type, and posting 
data to the chat  window. The syntax 
is exceptionally easy to pick up, and 
integrates seamlessly into the standard 
Sonic Pi syntax structure, enabling 
Minecraft functionality to be added to any 
previously written Sonic Pi compositions.
To use Sonic Pi with Minecraft, simply 
open the Minecraft application, load a 
world, open Sonic Pi 2.5, and choose 
a Minecraft function to trigger the 
connection, such as the chat window:
 mc_chat_post(“Hello World”)
Run the code and—hey presto!—
you’re connected.

point for any random numbers generated by Sonic Pi. 
Numbers generated using “random” are never truly random, 
merely chaotic in nature. We used 66678 as our starting point, but 
try other numbers to see how the composition changes. Next, we 
create a variable called “sound,” and in there we store a scale of 
notes in the key of g3. Next, we instruct Sonic Pi to perform the next 
bank of code 16 times, so it chooses the notes from the “sound” 
variable, then uses a number of arguments to achieve the following: 
Detunes the notes to create a slightly off sound to each note; alters 
the fade out and release of the note, so that it fades quickly; and 
amp controls the level of the note played—in this case, it’s half the 
volume relative to the others. Then, we modify the cutoff to use a 
random note between 70 and 80 to cut off certain frequencies. We 
now instruct the code to wait for 0.125 seconds. Lastly, because we 
have opened three loops using  do , we must close them correctly:
 with_fx :reverb, room: 1  do
  live_loop :melody do
    use_synth :beep
    use_random_seed 66678
    sound = (scale :g3, :major_pentatonic, num_octaves: 3)
    16.times do
      play sound.choose, detune: 6, release: 0.1, amp: 0.5, cutoff: 
 rrand(70, 80)
      sleep 0.125
    end
  end
 end
E
>> Click “Run” to play the composition. Remember that 
you can alter the random seed to produce a different 
sound. You can also alter the scale of notes, by changing 
g3 to another scale—g5, c4, and so on. You can also alter  
 major_pentatonic  to minor_pentatonic , to produce a 
much darker and more sorrowful tone.
9 
The finale
Our next live_loop is used to create an ambience 
to the composition, and again, we’re using an 
FX plugin. This time, it’s “ixi_techno,” a low-pass filter 
between the minimum and maximum cutoffs. We call the 
loop “ambience,” and first off, it performs a block of code 
eight times. Using the “hollow” synth, we play the note 
c3 with an amplitude of 0.5, putting the note into the mid-
tone mix of our composition. We then wait for one second 
before entering into another loop that iterates eight times. 
This time, however, it plays the “ambi_choir,” a haunting 
choir sound, at standard speed, but mixed down into the 
composition, so that it appears as background noise. We 
then sleep for one second, before closing the four loops 
that have been created:
 with_fx :ixi_techno do
  live_loop :ambience do
    8.times do
      use_synth :hollow
      play :c3, amp: 0.5
      sleep 1
      8.times do
        sample :ambi_choir, rate: 1, amp: 0.2
        sleep 1
      end
    end
  end
 end
>> Click “Run” to hear your composition play. Does 
it need any tweaking to match your goal? You could try 
changing the sample playback rate from 1 to 0.5, or to 2 for 
different results.
10 
Let the music play!
So, using Sonic Pi and some simple coding, 
we have managed to create a looping piece of 
audio that can be recorded using the “Record” button, and 
uploaded to SoundCloud, or used in your YouTube videos.
>> There are plenty of Sonic Pi examples on the official 
website, just point your browser at http://sonic-pi.net and 
click the “Examples” link. It’s also worth checking out the 
video of Sonic Pi’s creator, Sam Aaron, performing live at 
TEDx Newcastle—you’ll find it on the main page.

Preparations
Begin by downloading and installing DaVinci Resolve. It’s a 
reasonably big package at over 400MB, and there are a few 
dependencies you may need, although the installer takes care of 
these for you. Although you need to register in order to download 
it in the first place, there are no nasty hidden extras to watch out 
for in the installer, as far as we can tell. Launch the software and 
take the tour to see a preview of a few of Resolve’s key features, 
then let it check your computer to see how well it’ll perform. You 
can now create a new project. Bear in mind that the maximum 
resolution of the free version is 1080p, because 4K editing is locked 
to the paid-for real deal. The next choice is for the editor’s keyboard 
shortcuts, which you can set to match those of a number of other 
high-end editors—we’re using DaVinci’s default set throughout this 
guide, but you may already be familiar with Premiere, Final Cut, or 
Avid Media Composer.
2 
Look around
Resolve’s interface is split into four parts, which you can 
access using the bar at the bottom of the window, or by 
selecting them in the “Workspace > Primary Workspace” menu. 
The first one you’ll see is the media workspace [Image A], so let’s 
take a quick and very basic tour. Starting at the top-left, there’s a 
list of folder locations, which you use to locate your media; once a 
folder is located, a list of clips appears to its right, which can be 
previewed in the window to the right of that. You add your clips to 
your project by dragging them to the large pane at the bottom of the 
interface, or view information about the currently selected clip in 
the bottom-right pane. Drag a few clips into the bottom pane, and 
hit Shift-4 to head to Edit mode. 
Video editing for free is the dream, isn’t it? Nobody really wants to invest in professional software 
just to stitch together a family video or a bit of gaming footage. But there’s a reason we call it a 
dream: Frankly, the majority of free video-editing software is terrible. Windows Movie Maker does 
a passable job, if you’re not looking for particularly presentable results; ShotCut, recently making 
its way over from Linux, has the instability and baffling UI typical of its original home. There’s a 
stack of other packages out there that can apparently do the trick, but they’re so obtuse and buggy 
that we wouldn’t touch them. Which means it’s time for some DaVinci Resolve. Recently made 
free (as an ad for its full version), Blackmagic’s editor is actually used, for real, for Hollywood film 
grading, and it includes full editing facilities to boot. –alex cox

The editing room
Now we’re into the meat of Resolve’s editing 
facilities [Image B], which will be familiar to anyone 
who’s used a non-linear editor before. You get access to 
the clips you’ve selected, a timeline at the bottom of the 
screen, a couple of preview windows at the top, and a 
limited list of effects and transitions. Begin by dragging 
one of your clips on to the timeline—we’re using freely 
available public domain footage sourced from Archive.org, 
so if you’re looking to try Resolve, but don’t yet have any 
footage to use, that’s a solid legal source. When you drop 
your clip in, two tracks are created: one for the video, and 
one for its associated audio track. Each of these elements 
can be edited independently, although they begin (usefully) 
linked together, so your audio won’t end up out of sync.
4 
Trim and splice
Hover your mouse over the ends of your clip—
scroll, or use your mouse wheel to zoom out, if you 
can’t see all of it—and you can top and tail it by left-clicking 
and dragging. While this is a viable tactic, it’s far from the 
most useful way to trim a clip, mainly because you have 
to keep previewing it to see exactly where you’ve trimmed 
to. Better, then, to splice, putting a break in your clip at 
the exact point it needs to be cut. Use the controls of the 
rightmost preview window to view your clip, and stop it at 
the exact point you’d like it cut. Alternatively, drag the red 
position marker to your splice location. Then select the 
razor blade tool along the top edge of the timeline pane, 
and click on the position marker to break the clip into two. 
Since this is non-linear editing, there’s no need to worry

about this brutality: you won’t affect your original files at all. Go 
ahead and clean up by selecting the arrow tool, clicking the excess, 
and hitting Delete.
5 
Layering up
Let’s add a second clip now, and look at Resolve’s hierarchy. 
Drag your next clip and drop it above the original one, 
which creates a new video track. Overlap it with your first clip, 
and preview your video; you’ll see that the original has basically 
disappeared, since this new clip is at the top of the pile. This order 
matters, because it means you’re able to reliably mix video tracks 
together using transitions and cross fades. So, let’s do that. Move 
your upper clip close to the end of the lower one, overlapping just 
slightly. Hover, using the arrow tool, over the top-left edge of your 
top clip [Image C] to reveal a white handle; drag it to the right, and 
drop it in line with the end of the first clip and—hey presto!—you’ve 
created a cross fade.

6 
Making the grade
You could spend all your time in Resolve’s editing 
interface, and not worry about the rest of it. But 
Resolve was built as a color grading tool and, frankly, its 
non-linear editing portion is not quite as tasty as that of 
some of its competitors. The real meat, then, lies in the 
“Color” section, which hosts the grading, compositing, and 
effects tools. You’re working with a lesser collection than 
in the full version, but this is still a broadcast-standard 
selection. The only problem? The node-based system that 
Resolve uses can be a bit of a dog to get your head around. 
So, before we even touch the controls, let’s explain it with a 
little analogy. Many editors allow you to add effects to video 
using layers; think of this as a nice cream cake. If you’ve 
missed something out, it’s going to be a very messy job to 
pull it apart, put in the additional ingredient, and assemble 
the whole thing back into some presentable order. Using 
nodes is more like working with cupcakes; each one can be 
revised and decorated exactly as you wish; filling up your 
cupcake stand doesn’t mean they’re locked in place—if one 
looks a bit shoddy, you can pull it out without ruining the 
rest—and you’re free to eat them in any order you like. It’s 
an incredibly flexible way to add effects, and efficient, too: 
once you’ve created a node, you can reuse it as you wish.
7 
Composition
So, let’s try out this section with a bit of green 
screen—otherwise 
known 
as 
chroma 
key—
compositing. We’re using the clip “Hair Detail” from www.
hollywoodcamerawork.com/greenscreenplates.html 
as our test, since it gives us a good chance to fiddle with 
some relevant settings. If you’re creating your own green 
Resolve is not for the faint-hearted, 
and not for the faint-of-PC. It absolutely 
requires OpenCL support to operate, so 
forget about it if you’re looking to edit on 
a machine that doesn’t have a modern 
discrete graphics card. You’ll probably 
need to click through a couple of error 
messages when you load it, mainly due 
to Resolve looking for specialist editing 
hardware you probably don’t have—
don’t worry about these, it’ll work just 
fine without. You may also find that it 
doesn’t play nicely with your monitor; we 
had some issues getting it to run on a 4K 
panel, and it needed a little convincing 
about our Windows scaling options. 
If you want to take Resolve further, 
you could consider an upgrade: The full 
version weighs in at an eye-watering 
$995, and if you’re really serious about 
using it, you can pick up the software 
with a dedicated control surface (shown 
above)—featuring a host of buttons, jog 
wheels, and integrated LCD panels for 
fingertip control—at a positively eye-
loosening $29,995. This really is one for 
the professionals.

Completed your video? Then it’s time to 
deliver it—or, at least, it’s time to use 
Resolve’s “Deliver” section to render it. 
It’s another portion of the program that’s 
intuitive once you get the hang of it, but 
utterly alien until you do. Head to the 
“Deliver” section by hitting Shift-8, and 
you’ll see your timeline, a preview of the 
complete video, and a few more controls. 
If you’re happy that you’ve edited your 
video to the point that it’s ready to go, 
choose your settings in the top-left 
panel—there are presets, usefully, for 
things such as YouTube—then click the 
“Browse” button to set where your video 
will be saved. Now click “Add To Render 
Queue,” and hit “Start Render” on the 
right-hand side. 
If you’re only using Resolve to process 
clips for use in another editor, use the 
“Individual Clips” radio button in the 
left-hand pane to render each element 
individually. And if you’ve (sensibly) left 
small gaps at the start and end of your 
video, you can ensure it comes out at 
exactly the right length by changing the 
render to “In/Out Range” (at the top of the 
timeline), and using the gray bar above 
the timeline to set the exact point at which 
you’d like your video to be cut.
Render time
screen shot, make sure your lighting is consistent, your surface as 
flat as possible, and your camera set with enough saturation that 
the green doesn’t tend toward the gray. Head back to the timeline 
section, and clear it off by dragging a box over all the clips within, 
and hitting Delete, then place the green screen footage on top of 
whatever background footage you’d like to use—head back to the 
“Media” section to import it, if you’ve not done so already. If you’re 
using the same source file as us, you’ll notice that it comes as a 
series of png files; Resolve treats these the same as it does videos, 
so rather than importing it frame-by-frame, drag the folder into the 
bottom pane. Our clip has a slight issue: it’s anamorphic, 
so it looks squashed. Select the clip in the bottom pane, 
then select “Clip Attributes”—setting “Pixel Aspect Ratio” 
to “16:9” worked to pull our clip to the correct scale. 
8 
See the results
Head back to the “Edit” section, and layer up a 
couple of clips, placing the green screen footage on 
top of your background. Use the preview window to ensure 
that you can see the green screen footage, then head to 
the “Color” section. Click on your green screen footage to 
show it in the preview window, then add a new serial node 
by hitting Alt-S. Click the eyedropper tool (the Qualifier) on 
the menu in the center of the screen, then click an area of 
green screen to select it. Not much seems to have changed, 
but click the sparkling magic wand icon above the preview, 
and you’ll see that Resolve has created a mask [Image D], 
based on your selected color. At the bottom of the screen, 
under “Selection Range,” clicking the rightmost icon 
inverts the effect—because we’re looking to keep the 
foreground, rather than the background—and you can see 
how well you’ve done. Click and drag the values beneath 
hue, saturation, and luminance [Image E] in the Qualifier 
window to increase the range of color you’re selecting, 
which should (hopefully) pull your chroma key much closer 
d

to the content you wish to keep visible. In our case, it hasn’t worked 
well, because the green background is massively over-saturated. 
9 
Coloration
We need to bring that color down a little before our chroma 
key will work. Right-click the second node in the top-right 
pane, and select “Create serial node before.” On this node, linked 
in the chain prior to our chroma key operation, we’ll adjust the 
clip’s coloration, so click it to start editing it. There’s a problem, 
of course: if we just pull out a load of green from the clip, our cut-
out subject starts to look purple and unwell. But we can be more 
selective than that. Toward the bottom-left, click the icon that looks 
like a dot inside a circle to find the color wheels, then head to the 
third page. Drag the slider below the “Highlight” wheel, and you’ll 
start pulling down the brightness of the background, leaving the 
main image intact. Click on the original node, and drag the same 
slider back up a little, which should correct any disturbance to the 
original image. Make no mistake, we’re hacking here. There’s no 
adding quality to poor footage, and the green screen clip we’re using 
is supplied because it presents challenges; if you’re using 
your own stuff, you may not find it as difficult to work with. 
Sometimes, you just have to do the best job you can, and 
that means a lot of manual tweaking. Thankfully, pretty 
much every tool in Resolve’s Color section has a reset 
button, so you can try your tweaks, and undo them quickly.
10 
Qualification
Click the node with the chroma key applied to it, 
make sure the Qualifier tool is selected in the 
bottom-center pane, and drag the blur radius to increase 
its value slightly. Don’t go crazy, but apply at least a small 
amount, which will go some way to offsetting the harsh 
lines often present around the edge of a keyed image. Now 
it’s time to take a look at our results. In the nodes panel, 
right-click, and select “Add Alpha Output,” then click and 
drag a line between the triangular output of the rightmost 
node to the blue item that’s appeared. Switch off highlight 
mode by clicking the magic wand above the video preview, 
and the mixed picture appears. You may want to move the 
overlaid element; this is ridiculously easy. Just find the 
sizing tool on the central menu (third from right), and drag 
the values to move, rotate, or skew your overlay. The edges 
of the overlaid image block out the background, so head to 
the window tool (third from left), and click “Linear” at the 
top to draw a box around your image, and use it [Image F] 
to clip the edges. If you have a poorly keyed background—
perhaps with inconsistent green screen, or other elements 
you don’t want in shot—the window tool is a perfect way 
to get rid of them. So here we are—you’ve been given a 
glimpse of Resolve’s power, and we’ve spent four pages 
merely skimming the surface of what it can do. Head to the 
“Help” menu to open its reference manual, where over a 
thousand pages of instructions await you....

Make Your Own 
License Plate
1 
Create a new document
As the standard plate is in a 2:1 aspect ratio, that’s the size we’re 
making our document. We’ve gone for 1000x500 pixels, with a 
transparent background. We’re going to leave a border around the 
outside, so our finished plate will be slightly smaller. The color of a 
license plate is off-white, so click on the foreground color below the 
toolbar, and enter R=233, G=233, B=233 to make something about 
the right color. Experiment to see the effect that changing the R, G, 
and B values has if the color doesn’t look right to you.
2 
Rasterize your rectangle
For the plate’s outline, we’re going to make a rounded 
rectangle. In Photoshop CC, fold out the Rectangle tool, and 
you’ll find a “Rounded Rectangle” option. In earlier versions, you 
may need to use a Custom Shape, and select “Rounded Rectangle” 
from the options bar. Set the corner radius to 40 pixels (this number 
varies depending on the size of your document, so see what looks 
right for you), and the aspect ratio to 2:1. Draw your rectangle, then 
use the Bucket tool to fill it with your foreground color—it asks 
whether you want to rasterize the shape, and you do.
3 
Make it look 3D
To give the plate background a 3D look, apply some beveling. 
Right-click the “Rounded Rectangle” layer, select “Blending 
Options” to bring up the “Layer Style” window, and add a drop 
shadow, with the light source coming in from the top-left. Check 
the “Bevel and Emboss” box, and add an “Inner Bevel” using the 
“Chisel Hard” technique, to give the corners some texture. Hit  
Vehicle license plates were standardized as the familiar 6x12-inch rectangles in 1956, but they date 
back to around 1903 in North America, first being used in Massachusetts. Before ’56, it was a bit of 
a free-for-all between the states, with materials such as rubber and leather used to make plates.
Most states emboss the lettering into the plates, so they’re slightly raised when viewed from the 
front, but there is a growing number of flat, digitally printed plates on the highway. If you purchase a 
vanity plate, you’ve got a limited number of characters to work with, depending on the state you live 
in, and there’s a list of banned words you need to avoid.
These last two restrictions don’t apply if you’re designing your own plate in Photoshop, but it’s 
best to stick quite close to the requirements. Once you’ve made your plate, you can include it in 
digital art projects, or use it for whatever online persona you’re currently rocking, but we don’t 
recommend using a 3D printer to create cover for your bank heist getaway car. –Ian Evenden

Rectangle” layer in Filter Gallery, and select the 
“Texturizer” filter under “Texture.” “Sandstone” with a 
“Relief” setting of 2 gives a roughened look.
4 
Create the rim 
License plates have a rim, which means more 
beveling. First, though, we need to select the area to 
be beveled. Right-click the “Rounded Rectangle” layer, and 
choose “Select Pixels,” then “Select > Modify > Contract,” 
and move it in by 20 pixels or so. Nudge the outline with the 
arrow keys so it’s central. Then open the “Paths” palette, 
and convert your selection to a path. Choose the “Brush” 
tool, diameter 20px, and make your foreground color black. 
Create a new layer and select it. Stroke the path with the 
brush (right-click the “Work Path” in the “Paths” palette), 
and you should get a black hoop around your plate, but on 
a separate layer. Open the “Layer Style” palette again, and 
change the layer’s blend mode to “Screen,” at around 25% 
opacity. Now apply a “Smooth Inner Bevel,” with a depth of 
500%. You now have your rim [Image B].

Add the lettering
It’s time to add the lettering. You need the right font, 
and there’s a couple of different ones available for 
free online if you search, mostly with names like “License

trying to stay within the character limit, which varies between 
states, but is often six or seven. Earlier this year, a North Dakota 
resident had their “X32TTU8” plates revoked when some killjoy 
read them backward, but we have no such worries with ours. The 
lettering is often blue, something like R44, G61, B127, and we used 
300pt. Because our HQ is in San Francisco, we’re going to make this 
a California plate. 
6 
State your state
California uses a hand-drawn font for its state name, and 
it’s almost but not quite the same as Mistral, a font you can 
find online. The word “California” is slightly wider than four of the 
characters below it, which on our plate comes out at around 150pt 
[Image C]. Once you’ve typed it, choose a suitable red (R189, G0, 
B0 for us), and rasterize the layer by right-clicking the layer, and 
selecting the option from the menu. Go to “Edit > Transform > 
Free Transform,” and squash the lettering slightly, so it’s not so 
tall. Reposition your lettering below it if necessary, but keep it all 
inside the rim of the plate.
7 
Finishing touches
We’re not going to create screw holes in ours, but you can 
use the “Circular Marquee” tool, and punch four circular 
holes through the background layer. To add stickers, use the 
C
“Rectangular Marquee” on a new layer to create white and 
red areas—whatever matches the state you’re copying—
and use “Layer Styles” to make drop shadows under them. 
Add the text using the “Type” tool, and appropriate serif 
and sans serif fonts. We’ve rasterized and merged the type 
layers into the red sticker’s background, then used “Free 
Transform” to skew it, as these things are impossible to 
get on straight [Image D]. Once we’ve saved our plate, and 
exported it as a JPEG [Image E], it’s time for our executive 
editor to start compositing it into pictures of his Camaro. 
E
Using the “Layer Style” window, you can apply multiple 
effects to your layers. An “fx” symbol appears next to the 
layer in the stack, and the effects drop down below it. If you 
haven’t rasterized the layer, you can turn individual effects 
on or off at will by clicking the eyeball icon, just as you would 
the layers themselves. The palette we’ve been using here 
allows you to create your own effects from the tools provided, 
but there are also presets, accessed by going to “Window > 
Styles.” You can change how effects interact by changing their 
order in the “Layer Style” window—select an active effect, 
and use the arrow buttons, bottom-left, to change the order.

The Linux Budget-
Busting Box
“Linux” is a fairly taboo word 
for most here at Maximum PC, yet 
we write about it a lot—and with 
good reason. It’s a free, diverse, 
open-source 
operating 
system, 
with a huge breadth of potential. 
It rattles the cages of the likes of 
Microsoft and Apple, and constantly 
helps to improve the technological 
ecosystem 
we 
all 
call 
home. 
However, due to the very nature of 
the beast, the fact that it’s easy to 
get hold of a free copy of the rebel 
OS, and most of its users are more 
inclined to run older hardware, the 
vast majority of Linux-powered 
systems tend to err on the side of 
caution when it comes to purchasing 
newer hardware. So, for many 
people, the concept of a super-fast 
Linux system, powered by the latest 
Intel Z170 chipset and M.2 PCIe 
SSDs, is something of an oxymoron.
The plan with this project, then, 
was to satisfy two separate criteria. 
Firstly, to build a super-fast Linux 
system, powered by a quad-core 
Intel processor in conjunction with 
the latest Samsung M.2 PCIe SSDs, 
and secondly, to keep the budget as 
low as humanly possible at the same 
time, to stick to the Linux ethos. Did 
we achieve it? Almost.

LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: Easy 
Making Linux great aga… Just kidding!

The Linux Dream 
To start with, we knew we wanted to use a quad-core 
processor, preferably of Skylake origin. The newer chipsets 
would support M.2 drives over the PCIe bus, and the four cores of 
Skylake’s mighty Core i5-6500 would be plenty for any demanding 
Linux task we could throw at it.
For a base hard drive, we opted for a Samsung PM961 256GB 
M.2 PCIe SSD. Coming in at a relatively cheap $144, this OEM 
drive boasts a whopping 3,000MB/s sequential reads, and 
1,100MB/s sequential writes, proving to be one of the best deals 
around when it comes to current NVMe drives. However, as it’s 
an OEM drive, it’s worth bearing in mind that you’ll receive no 
support from Samsung with regard to drivers, troubleshooting, 
or software issues. That said, as it’s primarily only going to be 
used for the OS, that’s not the end of the world. 
Our motherboard was a cheap and cheerful Asus B150 A/M.2. 
At the low end of the pricing spectrum, it’s a fairly well-equipped 
mobo capable of housing 8GB of DDR4, in conjunction with an M.2 
drive, and a plethora of SATA drives. And our last worthy mention 
is the 550W Kolink budget power supply, which we scavenged 
from our storage containers. It’s not available to buy right now, 
but swapping it over to an EVGA 500B would be more than 
enough to satisfy all your power needs—even with an additional 
GPU—without breaking the bank.
Whenever you start building any system, the first 
thing you should do (after stripping out everything you 
don’t need from the case, of course) is install the rear 
I/O plate. On the more expensive boards out there, 
these are nicely designed, clean plates, with protective 
EMI-shielded padding. However, on the more budget-
focused boards, you may find they are simply a thin 
sheet of tin, with a variety of pins sticking in place. 
Our best piece of advice is to try to bend these out of 
the way so you can install your motherboard securely 
afterward, and if that fails to work, snap the extra metal 
pins off entirely to make sure you keep everything 
installed in place. Rear I/O plates keep the vast majority 
of dust out of your system.
For this build, we opted to use one of BitFenix’s 
Nova cases. Generally speaking, BitFenix makes some 
fantastic budget-oriented chassis, which beside looking 
good, generally make our lives a little easier when it 
comes to constructing a system. You can find these for 
about $50 here and there, but we opted for the slightly 
pricier $65 windowed variant. Cable management is 
slightly limited in these budget-friendly models, but we 
still managed to route the PSU cable up and through the 
rear of the chassis. Although this doesn’t do much to 
make things look any tidier, it does help keep the cable 
out of the way of any graphics cards you may wish to fit 
in the future. We just wish we could say the same for the 
8-pin CPU power.

R&D
Installing a CPU in the Skylake era is exceedingly easy. 
Simply lift up the metal retention lever located to the right of 
the socket, leaving the plastic protector in place. Place the CPU 
gently into the socket, with the golden triangle on the processor 
pointing in the same direction as the triangle mark on the 
retention bracket, slide the bracket back under the screw, and 
relock the retention arm. The protective cap should pop off, and 
you’re all set. Word of warning for the less experienced: Do this 
on a flat surface, with the motherboard laying flat. You can do 
it inside a chassis, but just don’t do it vertically. For M.2 SSDs, 
simply undo the screw located near the end of the M.2 slot, put 
the drive in the correct way (matching the slot up with the drive), 
press the drive down, and rescrew in place.
In cases like the Nova, cable management space 
behind the rear panel is often an afterthought. This can 
make installation of the CPU 8-pin power particularly 
troublesome. Fortunately, in this build, thanks to the lack of 
add-in cards, we could run the CPU power straight up and 
across the board, taking care not to hit the stock cooler. If 
you were running a graphics card as well, however, a neat 
way of getting around this problem would be to install the 
PSU first, then route the CPU cable under the motherboard 
itself, taking care not to get in the way of any stand-offs. It 
can be a bit fiddly, but it’s a neat way to keep a cable tidy, 
while simultaneously allowing GPUs to be installed.

CPU Power
There’s nothing more frustrating to deal with than 
front I/O connectors. These fiddly cables ensure that 
all your power buttons, reset switches, and LEDs work 
effectively, but attaching them to the motherboard can be 
a pain in the proverbial. If your motherboard doesn’t have 
directions printed on it for what goes where, you’ll have to 
dive into the user manual. Fortunately, for the Asus B150 
A/M.2, the instructions are printed on the PCB around 
the front panel connectors. Our advice? Try to route the 
connectors through a rear panel to manage the mess,  
and ensure that the positive and negative sides of your 
LEDs are attached to the correct points, otherwise they 
won’t operate.
When it comes to budget cases, included fans tend to be 
pretty sparse. With the Nova coming with just a single 120mm 
airflow fan, we opted to reverse it and use it as an intake for 
the whole system, as opposed to an exhaust. Although this 
won’t necessarily help a huge deal with dust control, drawing 
cool air in directly over the reference cooler, and down on to 
the motherboard, should help to alleviate any potential thermal 
throttling issues. That said, with the clock speed on the Intel 
Core i5-6500 only registering at 3.2GHz, and thanks to Skylake’s 
exceptionally power-efficient architecture, it’s highly unlikely 
we’d ever reach a point of thermal throttling, even with a stock 
cooler running at full load.

The 8GB of DDR4 here 
is rated to operate at

that the B150 chipset can only 
support 2,133MT/s max.

Although a 2TB drive 
does bump up our 
overall spend, we wanted to 
create a versatile Linux box, 
regardless of whether you 
want to game, work, or 
stream media from it.

There’s actually a chunk 
of cable management 
just to the left of the hard 
drive cages, facing forward—
we wedged a swathe of 
excess cables there to keep 
things looking a little tidier.

BitFenix even manages 
to include a toolless 
5.25-inch drive bay for those 
still clinging on to their old 
Linux discs.
For this reviews Editor, it’s safe to say 
that Linux is a completely alien experience. 
Getting to grips with it certainly made for 
an interesting struggle. As a hardcore 
Windows fan, the concept of running the 
entire OS off a single bootable USB stick was 
mind-blowing. The versatility achieved by 
having the OS on a single drive to diagnose 
potential future hardware problems is nigh 
on incredible, especially compared to an OS 
like Windows, where everything is tied down 
into authentication, personal accounts, and 
Windows Updates.
That wasn’t the only thing that impressed, 
however. The level of customization available 
upon installation was equally mesmerizing. 
Did you want to use a virtual partition system 
ahead of time? Fine. Encrypt the drive’s OS 
and drive entirely? OK. And there are many 
other options equally possible on the portable 
desktop. Couple that with the ridiculously 
small install size, and it really is something 
worth trying, at least once, even by Linux’s 
harshest critics. 
The thing is, Linux users are to operating 
systems what we enthusiasts are to hardware. 
They’re the tinkerers, the command-line 
delvers, those looking to tailor their desktops 
to exactly what they want to do. Whether that’s 
an office PC, a gaming rig, a NAS, a Plex Media 
Server, hell, even a mobile drone—all of it can 
be done through a variety of different distros 
ready to serve the user, most of which are 
free, and all of which are open source.
And it’s that open-source heritage that 
makes the OS so much more in tune with the 
market than even Windows can manage. 4K 
scaling by default is a given, the user interface 
is intuitive and easy to use, and the best 
features from both Windows and MacOS are 
seamlessly integrated by default. That’s not 
to say it’s not without its problems, of course. 
Driver support is unbelievably patchy, and 
even running an AMD processor provides its 
own set of challenges. AMD GPU drivers are 
included in most distros by default, but Nvidia 
generally performs better once the driver is 
installed. Having to perform tweaks for any 
serious problem via the command line can 
become tiresome, and even having to learn 
how a new operating system works can be 
frustrating at times.
Naturally, as far as performance goes, 
with the Samsung PM961 operating alongside 
the Intel Core i5-6500, it was certainly quick 
to boot. Lightning-fast, in fact. File transfer 
speeds were well into the 3GB/s range on the 
primary drive, with Cinebench R15 providing 
an impressive score just shy of 620 points—
what we’d expect from a core like this. Alas, 
that’s where our performance charts end. 
Benchmarking games in Linux is challenging, 
if not impossible. Games such as Shadow of 
Mordor, do boast an integrated benchmark, 
but showed a  50 percent decrease in overall 
average frames per second compared to the 
same hardware running Windows. For the 
most part, what we can say is that Linux does 
support Steam, and more games are slowly 
threading their way into the OS. But gaming 
isn’t really what Linux is about. 
Experience and performance aside, the 
build process itself was incredibly painless. 
This is the absolute basics of PC building: 
Take a case, grab a processor, a standard 
PSU, two sticks of RAM, and a few hard drives, 
and just slap it all together. There are no back 
plates to attach, no internal cooling to worry 
about, and no particular need for aggressive 
cable management. What you’re left with is 
an astonishingly quick build with relatively 
little fuss, that performs exceptionally well, 
regardless of what platform you happen to 
be on.

Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1050 Ti is a rather 
curious concept. It follows a long line of 
prestigious graphics processors with its 
nomenclature—from the PCI powerless 
GTX 750 Ti, to the value-demolishing 950—
yet this variant just doesn’t seem to have hit 
the same mark. It still requires that six-pin 
PCI power connector, and it doesn’t quite 
reach the heady heights of glorious frame-
rate-to-dollar ratios that we want when it 
comes to price, either.
So, where shall we begin? Let’s start 
with the spec. Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1050 
Ti comes with 768 CUDA cores, 48 texture 
units, and 32 ROPs. In contrast, the previous 
generation had 768 CUDA cores, 48 texture 
units, and 32 ROPs. “Well, of course, it’s 
a process shrink,” we hear you say, “So 
nothing else is bound to change.” We’d be 
inclined to agree, if it wasn’t for how the 
rest of Nvidia’s lineup has evolved this past 
year. Compare the 1060 to the 960, and the 
number of cores has expanded from 1,024 
to 1,280, with transistor count increasing 
by 1.46 billion in the process. The 1050 Ti, 
on the other hand, has a meager transistor 
increase of just 0.36 billion. You see where 
we’re coming from here? The problem is, 
that it shows, terribly so. And when you 
consider the price of the GTX 1050 Ti—
even with the 4GB variant versus the 3GB 
GTX 1060—well, you’ve got to be asking 
yourself some serious questions about 
It just doesn’t make any sense
Asus Strix GeForce 
GTX 1050 Ti 
Benchmarks
why you would want to sacrifice that extra 
processing power.
On to performance figures, then. At 
1080p, this card achieved 43fps on average 
in Far Cry Primal, contrasting starkly with 
the GTX 1060 3GB’s 61fps. In Attila, the 
difference was less pronounced, with the 
plucky underdog losing out by 13fps, but 
in almost all the other titles, the difference 
was astronomical. In fact, it was so bad, it 
forced us to reach back into our archives 
to see how well the GTX 960 scored in 
synthetic benchmarks compared to the 
1050 Ti. The answer? The 960 scored just 
200 points less in Fire Strike than this new 
16nm card. Ouch. Power draw, on the other 
hand, is more in line with what you’d expect 
from a card of this caliber—overall draw 
from the wall staying resolute at 216W 
under maximum load, and 52W at idle.
It’s not all bad
Pushing the GPU aside for a moment, let’s 
look at this card in isolation. Asus really 
has nailed it with this iteration. It isn’t the 
triple-fan, galvanized concoction of metal 
and RGB LEDs that we find on cards higher 
up in the series, but a dual-fan solution, 
with a far smaller overall footprint, 
produced in a much more stylish manner. 
Don’t get us wrong, the DCIII is great at 
reducing overhead temperatures, but 
the added length puts many folk off.  The

dual-fan solution here, on the other hand, 
looks crisp, clean, and sharp, and the 
added backplate adds to the premium 
feel. The fans are quiet—almost silent— 
while spinning at low loads, with 0dB fan 
technology included to reduce noise while 
idling on desktop. It’s almost as though the 
AIBs have been let down by the GPU.
Ultimately, if you were to evaluate this 
card outside of the GPU ecosystem, you’d 
be pleased with its performance. At 1080p, 
it can easily hit 30–45fps in most modern 
titles. However, comparing it to the GTX 
1060, which is only $20-50 more in some 
scenarios, or even the RX 470, at just $5 
more, it’s hard to justify this card’s position 
in the market. We recommend the RX 470 
Strix 4GB or the low-end GTX 1060 instead. 
As an aside, due to the supply and demand 
issues that Asus is currently experiencing, 
we’ve been informed that the high price of 
this specific card will be dropping over the 
coming months. –zak storey

So smexeh, but at what cost?

It’s no secret that buying a custom-built 
system from a professional PC builder 
comes with a premium price. Normally, we 
are staunch advocates of building your own 
PC, but it’s worth considering a custom 
builder for small form factor systems. The 
Falcon Northwest Tiki is a perfect example. 
Measuring just 13.75 x 14.5 x 5 inches, 
including the base, the Tiki’s shiny bespoke 
chassis takes up a minimal amount of desk 
real estate, giving you reason to display 
its edges, rather than hide it away under 
your desk. But assembling parts inside 
such a small space can be quite the hassle, 
especially when you want to cram a full 
desktop’s worth of power inside.
Removing the Tiki’s side panel feels 
a little like peering into a desktop-class 
laptop, where every component has its 
proper place, and not a bit of space goes 
to waste. This allows for an Asus Z-series 
Mini-ITX motherboard to host an Intel 
Core i7-6700K and 16GB of RAM—fairly 
standard fare—as well as a full-size Nvidia 
Titan X, connected via a PCIe flexible ribbon 
in order to sit parallel to the mobo. Top that 
off with a 512GB Samsung 950 Pro M.2 SSD, 
combined with a 4TB Western Digital Red 
HDD, and you can see that the Tiki packs a 
lot of power into its rather svelte frame. 
The Tiki’s crowning component is 
obviously the top-end Titan X. Nvidia’s 
A mighty beast in a tiny frame
Falcon Northwest Tiki
Pascal architecture brought outstanding 
performance to its whole slate of current-
gen graphics cards, and the Titan X sits at 
the top of that pile. In our 1080p testing, 
the Titan X’s 12GB of VRAM proved more 
than enough for exceptional frame rates, 
pulling in around 120fps for Far Cry Primal 
and The Division, and an average of 158fps 
across Rise of the Tomb Raider’s three-
part GPU benchmark. 
Small But Mighty
Interestingly, these numbers show that 
a single Titan X performs both better and 
worse, depending on the game, than a pair 
of GTX 1080s—such as the configuration 
found in the full-tower Digital Storm 
Aventum 3 that we reviewed way back in 
our September 2016 issue. There isn’t 
much price difference between the two 
configurations, and for larger systems, 
we’d say that dual-1080 is likely the better 
option. But, for the Tiki’s small form 
factor, it’s nice to see that the single, more 
powerful card can hold its own. 
The Tiki also performs admirably at 
higher resolutions. The Tiki’s Titan X 
managed a fairly stable 46fps for The 
Witcher 3 in 4K with max settings. While 
not quite the gaming ideal of 60fps, Geralt 
looked absolutely stunning in 4K, and our 
test monitor’s G-Sync kept everything

at 97fps in 1440p and 50fps in 4K, while 
3DMark’s 1440p and 4K tests, Fire Strike 
Extreme and Ultra, returned scores of 
11,526 and 6,296, respectively. 
On the computational side, the Tiki 
lagged slightly behind in tests such as 
Cinebench R15, Tech ARP x264, and 
PCMark 8 Creative, compared to builds 
outfitted with the enthusiast-level Core i7-
6950X. Having said that, its Core i7-6700K 
is certainly no slouch, and is more than 
powerful enough for any task you choose to 
throw at it. 
As configured, the Tiki we tested was 
knocking on the door of $4,000—a hefty 
price tag, but not unreasonable considering 
the power contained within its small frame. 
Falcon Northwest’s build quality is top tier, 
and while there isn’t much room inside the 
Tiki’s frame for upgrades down the road, 
the power it ships with should last for a 
long, long time. –bo moore

The popularity of network attached 
storage is succinctly illustrated with this 
latest release from Western Digital: The 
WD My Cloud PR2100 is essentially an 
upgraded take on last year’s My Cloud 
Business DL2100—a device that was 
aimed squarely at small businesses. This 
new device uses the same chassis, with 
its austere and utilitarian drive bays, but 
updates the innards so that it can handle 
4K streaming. It’s a device that’s serious 
about your data, but appreciates that 
you’re just as likely to use it in the home as 
you are in the office.
The My Cloud PR2100 is a dual-drive 
unit, although the PR4100, a four-bay 
device, is also available. Both units boast 
the same core hardware of a quad-core 
Intel Pentium N3710, coupled with 4GB of 
DDR3. This CPU has a base frequency of 
1.6GHz, capable of bursting up to 2.56GHz 
if needed, although it’s the low TDP of just 
6W that’s possibly more noteworthy—
you’ll rarely call on the full performance of 
the chip, but you will leave the unit plugged 
in 24/7. In testing, it pulled just 22W from 
the wall, which is impressive.
One thing that we noted with the original 
DL2100, and something that continues to 
grate with this model, is how noisy it can 
be. We’re not talking about the bump and 
grind of the hard drives, which isn’t much 
more noticeable than other NAS units, but 
rather the whine of the fan at the rear of the 
unit. This is loudest when it’s first turned 
on, but revs up at other times, too. It could 
well limit where you place the NAS.
On the positive side, this device is 
incredibly easy to set up: Plug it in, connect 
it to your router, turn it on, go to the My 
Cloud website, and you’re up and running. 
The main drive interface is simple but 
Versatile

generation
slick, and the homepage clearly shows 
everything vital you’d want to know about 
the NAS. Accessing the drive locally is as 
straightforward as you’d expect, while 
connecting to it over the Internet is also 
surprisingly easy, too. Uploading files 
remotely can be a sluggish affair, but 
pulling that data off is snappy, and local 
uploads are much quicker. In testing, we 
witnessed local read and write speeds of 
119MB/s and 118MB/s respectively, which 
are both very healthy.
Drive a bargain
The My Cloud PR2100 is available as an 
unpopulated device with a list price of 
$399, but the model we have here ships 
with a pair of Western Digital’s own 8TB 
Reds. These drives cost $345 each on 
their own, so buying this drive populated 
represents reasonable value for money as 
well. By default, these are configured as a 
RAID 1 volume, which makes sense for a 
two-drive device that you’re trusting with 
your data. This gives you 7.93TB of space 
to play with, and has the reassurance that 
comes with a mirrored array. This isn’t 
your only configuration option, though, 
because it supports JBOD, Spanning, and 
RAID 0 configurations as well. 
One particularly nice feature of the 
My  Cloud Pro is the front-mounted USB 
port that enables you to back up the 
contents of whatever you plug into it with 
a touch of the button above the port. It’s a 
simple enough idea, but one that is often 
overlooked by bigger, cleverer devices. A 
counter to this is that those bigger, clever 
devices probably have a more extensive 
app catalog to call upon. There are 17 apps 
available for the My Cloud Pro, covering 
everything from media servers to torrent 
clients, though—so, for the vast majority 
of uses, Western Digital should have you 
covered. A notion that sums up the My 
Cloud Pro well. –Alan Dexter

When solid-state drives first arrived, 
there was much rejoicing. Surely, the 
PC had crossed the final frontier. All 
mechanical 
devices 
could 
finally 
be 
banished, and with them any performance 
bottlenecks. The PC’s work was done. But 
it hasn’t quite worked out like that.
The first consumer SSDs had some 
serious performance flaws. Once those 
were hammered out, SSDs began to bump 
up against the limitations of the SATA 
interface and AHCI control protocol. Then 
PCI Express technology removed that 
bottleneck, and the NVMe protocol enabled 
even more responsiveness.
Put another way, SSDs are still getting 
faster, and that’s the context into which 
Samsung’s new solid-state killer arrives, 
the 960 Pro. Expectations are high, given 
the outstanding history of Samsung’s Pro 
line of SSDs. Many of them have been the 
best in the business.
The 960 Pro is effectively Samsung’s 
second generation of consumer-targeted 
PCI Express SSDs in M.2 format, following 
the kick-ass 950 Pro, although Samsung 
did offer a few OEM M.2 drives before the 
950 Pro. Whatever, the 960 Pro is pretty 
much all-new. It uses Samsung’s latest 
Polaris controller chip, for instance. It has 
also transitioned from Samsung’s 32-layer 
3D NAND memory chips to 48-layer chips, 
with double the data density.
The upshot, on paper, is some absolutely 
stellar claimed performance numbers. 
The old 950 Pro was far from shabby, with 
its 2.2GB/s read rating, and maximum IOPs 
performance of 300K. But the new 960 Pro 
positively blows it out of the water. The 2TB 
model reviewed here tops out at an epic 
3.5GB/s for reads and 2.1GB/s for writes—
The best just 
got better
Samsung 
960 Pro 
M.2 2TB
Benchmarks
numbers that are beginning to resemble 
system memory bandwidth capabilities 
from not all that long ago.
The QD32 random access numbers 
are almost as impressive, at 440K read 
IOPs and 360K write IOPs. The latter 
figure is well over three times the official 
110K write IOPs of the 950 Pro. As if that 
wasn’t enough, the endurance rating is 
up, too, and rocks in at a beefy 1,200TB. 
Admittedly, not all the numbers are as 
spectacular. Samsung has only managed 
an incremental improvement in QD1 
random access performance. But taken as 
a whole, it looks like a huge leap over what 
was already a lightning-fast drive.
In some regards, that’s how it plays 
out in our benchmarks, too. In ATTO Disk 
Benchmark’s raw test of throughput, for 
instance, the 960 Pro demolishes data 
at roughly the claimed multi-gigabyte 
rates. It’s much quicker than the 950 Pro 
in CrystalMark’s sequential tests, too. 
Elsewhere, though, the 960 Pro is very fast, 
but not as big a step forward as we’d hoped. 
It only improves on the 950 Pro’s 51MB/s 
CrystalMark 4K reads by 7MB/s, for 
example. And it’s actually a little slower 
than the 950 in CrystalMark’s 4K write 
tests. The 960 Pro is likewise barely any 
quicker in our real-world file copy test than 
either the 950 Pro or, indeed, Intel’s 750 
Series 1.2TB drive. We also had the same 
issues with 4K benchmarking in AS SSD 
that we saw with the 950 Pro. You could 
write that off as a quirk with that particular 
benchmark, but it’s difficult to be certain 
that there aren’t real-world workloads that 
would trigger the same issues.
All of which means it’s one of those 
weird situations where we have a product

that’s probably faster than anything 
we’ve seen previously. At 2TB, it’s also a 
reminder that pretty soon you won’t need 
a magnetic drive for even mass storage 
duties. And yet, somehow, the 960 Pro 
leaves us less than totally convinced. It’s 
probably the best drive you can buy at the 
moment. But it’s still not perfect. It’s also 
worth remembering that Intel’s 3D Xpoint

AOC’s AG271QG gives Asus’s RoG 
Swift PG279Q a run for its money.
in the lab

MAXIMUMPC
maximumpc.com
JAN 2017

There’s a heck of a lot going on in the 
monitor market right now. 4K, curved 
panels, the promise of HDR—it’s all 
happening. But that doesn’t necessarily 
mean 
the 
sweet 
spot 
for 
a 
high-
performance PC monitor, with a bit of 
gaming in its remit, has changed.
That’s where the new AGON AG271QG 
comes in. It’s part of AOC’s new high-
end line of gaming-centric PC monitors, 
and it checks an awful lot of our boxes. 
For starters, it’s a 27-inch model, with a 
2560x1440 native resolution. That’s a very 
nice compromise between size, detail, 
desktop space, and GPU load.
In fact, it’s probably the best all-round 
compromise right now, especially if you 
aren’t a fan of multi-GPU gaming. Even 
Nvidia’s latest Pascal graphics cards 
are marginal when it comes to driving 
4K resolutions really smoothly. That’s 
particularly relevant when you consider 
the AG271QG’s next key feature: support 
for refresh rates up to 165Hz. There’s zero 
chance of playing the latest games at that 
kind of frame rate at 4K. So that WQHD 
resolution gives your GPU half a chance of 
punching out frame rates to do the 165Hz 
support something approaching justice.
On those occasions when your GPU 
can’t crank out triple-digit frame rates, 
the AGON also has a solution in the form 
of support for Nvidia’s performance-
smoothing G-Sync technology. Factor in 
a few other additional frills, such as the 
handy headphone hook on the right-hand 
side, and the fully adjustable stand, and you 
have a very nice overall gaming package 
on paper. AOC even includes a handy 
mouse-sized programable controller that 
helps you quick-jump between settings if 
Have some 165Hz IPS awesomeness from AOC
AOC AGON AG271QG
different presets for various applications 
are your bag. Nice.
As if all that wasn’t enough to get gaming 
with, we haven’t even mentioned the kicker, 
namely the IPS technology used in the 
AG271QG’s LCD panel. Yup, that’s 165Hz 
refresh and lovely IPS colors, just like the 
Asus RoG Swift PG279Q, but for about $50 
less. Where do we sign up?
Dishing out the detail
Fire 
the 
AG271QG 
up, 
and 
initial 
impressions are good. The IPS panel has 
a super-smooth anti-glare coating, and 
thus clean, sparkle-free image quality. 
The viewing angles are pretty much 
impeccable, too. In fact, it puts in a very 
strong performance throughout our test 
images. Gradients are ultra-smooth, and 
there’s tons of detail in the white scales. 
Only a whiff of compression in the black 
scales spoils what would otherwise be a 
perfect score. Put another way, the out-of-
the-box calibration is pretty darn nice.
That 165Hz refresh is just to die for. It’s a 
subtle difference compared to, say, 100Hz 
or 120Hz. But it’s definitely noticeable, and 
makes for a really responsive screen and 
solid-looking images. It’s so nice, we’ll 
forgive the fact that you have to dig into the 
OSD to enable a silly overclocking mode to 
get at the highest 165Hz setting. At least 
the menu is clear and simple to navigate.
One 
arguable 
downside 
of 
IPS 
technology in a gaming screen is pixel 
response. The AG271QG is rated at 4ms, 
which is a little off the pace of 1ms TN 
panels. But for most gamers, most of the 
time, we doubt they’d notice the very slight 
increase in blurriness. What they will 
pick up on is those gorgeous IPS colors

and superior contrast. If you’re looking 
for downsides, well, the AG271QG can’t 
compete with its Asus nemesis when it 
comes to perceived quality. The chassis 
feels relatively cheap, and the adjustable 
metal stand is a bit of a lash-up compared 
to Asus’s slickly productized efforts.
But then the AOC is a little cheaper, and 
such shortcomings have diddly-squat to do 
with image quality, productivity, or gaming 
fun. So, you pays your money and you 
takes your choice. But the new AOC AGON 
AG271QG is certainly a very plausible new 
competitor in the performance 27-inch 
segment. –jeremy Laird

There are a few things every hardware 
enthusiast needs from a headset, and 
top of the list is comfort. Rarely do we 
wear a headset for just a few minutes; if 
you’re going in, you’re going in. And so 
we went in. We anti-socially bolted on 
Sennheiser’s sexy-looking middle-ground 
cans, and steadfastly refused to remove 
them, testing them for six-to-eight hour 
stretches, alternating between marathon 
Overwatch sessions, pumping music, 
and generally blocking out the rest of the 
office. And on this count, there’s rarely 
been a headset so well designed. The GSP 
300’s memory-foam ear cups, coated in 
silky faux-leather, positively caress the 
skull, combining with the closed-back 
design—hinged on to ball joints, which 
place the cups squarely on even the most 
angular head—to effectively block out 
external sound. You’re not entirely in your 
own world, of course. Our colleagues, 
we assume from their wild gesturing, 
experienced mild second-hand discomfort 
when we truly blared the thrash metal, but 
there’s no more leakage than most other 
closed-back headsets we’ve tried. 
They’re also light, to the extent that 
we legitimately thought Sennheiser had 
accidentally sent us an empty box when they 
hit the office, though we have absolutely no 
concerns about their durability. They’re 
also easily adjusted, with a split headband 
padded with semi-rigid foam, which keeps 
the plastic away from the scalp, and puts 
another check in the wearability box. The 
clever design doesn’t stop there; swing the 
mic to vertical, and it shuts off, shielding 
the online world from your disgusting 
eating sounds, and there’s a useful analog 
volume knob on the right ear cup, adjusted 
so that it doesn’t quite hit zero. You can 
essentially use it as a booster, turning it 
all the way down, pumping your computer 
volume up to a reasonable level, and

tweaking upward (slightly—a minuscule 
19 ohm impedance means the GSP 300 can 
reach an eardrum-rattling 113dB) if you 
need to hear a particularly quiet buddy.
live on stage
On the subject of volume, let’s talk sound 
stage, and tastes thereof. Sennheiser has 
crafted an interesting one; a rich, bass-
heavy, bouncy sound, which is incredibly 
appealing on first listen, and at high 
volumes. Almost everything, not just the 
bass, feels marginally boosted, leaving 
no sound to the imagination, although the 
GSP 300s seem to miss a little in the vocal 
frequencies. It’s a massive sound, almost 
overwhelming—the cans can certainly hold 
their own at workplace-unsafe volumes, 
and retain impressive clarity when driven 
less aggressively—but we felt ourselves 
yearning for something a little flatter. But 
that’s us. If you like your ears full of fat 
noise at all times, these will please you no 
end. But what of the ears of others? The 
two-sided noise-canceling mic is not, by 
any means, awful; we had no problems 
being heard in Discord conversations, 
and the integrated cut-off comes in 
useful more often than you’d imagine. It’s 
adequate for streaming or recording, but 
we’d lean toward a dedicated external mic 
if we were going for a professional finish. 
In isolation, this is a quality headset, 
a notable notch above budget options. 
But, to be fair, we also spent a day flitting 
between the GSP 300 and Kingston’s 
similarly-priced HyperX Cloud II, which, 
until now, had been our favorite affordable 
headset. And, by a very small margin, it 
still is. The Cloud has a more appealing

audio balance, a braided cable, as opposed 
to Sennheiser’s rubberized number, and 
an included USB sound module for fine 
adjustments; the GSP 300 feels slightly 
better on the head, and that rich bass is 
just explosive. Whichever way you lean, 
make no mistake about it, the GSP 300 is a 
formidable headset, and if you’re contained 
within cans on a daily basis, it’s one that 
has to be worn to be believed. –alex cox

It’s hard to sum up just how impressed we 
are with this $100 lump of perfection. NZXT 
has always made an impression with its 
cases—since the launch of its H440 back in 
2014, the company has been on a winning 
streak. Whether it’s the bold design of the 
ITX Manta, or the simple and elegant S340, 
it seems this chassis manufacturer can do 
no wrong. So when the Elite—an updated 
variant of the S340—launched, featuring 
the now popular tempered glass side 
panel, we had to subject it to our scrutiny.
So, what’s so special about this chunk 
of design? A combination of three things. 
First, the price. Second, the graciously 
professional aesthetic. And thirdly, the 
intuitive design elements when it comes 
to user convenience. For $100, you get a 
small, compact tower. Clean and sharp. 
Almost professional—enough to rival 
any Mac. The single tempered glass side 
panel lacks any smoky tint or garish 
discrepancies, elegantly showing off the 
innards of your system.
No Expense Spared
Delving behind the reconstituted molten 
sand and into the interior, we’re amazed 
by the quality of the paint job. The satin 
powdered finish coats the insides of the 
folded steel panels. Nothing catches, 
everything is smooth, yet still decisively 
metallic. 
The 
black 
cable-hide 
bar 
elegantly snakes up the right-hand side of 
the interior, easily hiding any ugly cables 
you might have from view. There are no 
rubber grommets to be found here—but, 
honestly, you simply don’t need them.
A look behind the motherboard tray 
reveals a suitably expansive CPU cutout, 
and a total of four cable grips dotted 
around—plenty to route any unwanted 
cables through—with additional cable tie 
points positioned nearby. Heading down 
to the compartmentalized power supply 
cover, you’ll find a mounting cage for two 
3.5-inch drives, followed by ample room 
for your ATX power supply, with plenty 
of dust-filtered ventilation included. The 
power supply installs through the rear 
of the chassis, via a neat screw-mounted 
bracket, and that’s about all there is to 
it. And then there’s the front I/O, which 
features power, reset, four USB headers, 
a headphone and microphone jack, and an 
Case of the year
HDMI passthrough for those VR junkies 
out there.
Cooling support is a mixed bag. There’s 
room for a 240 or 280mm AIO in the front 
of the chassis, one 140mm or 120mm fan 
in the roof, and one 120mm fan in the rear. 
As there’s no 5.25-inch bay in the front of 
the case, the front panel remains solid. 
However, there’s a good inch and a half 
of separation between the panel and the 
fan mounting points, ensuring you can 
retain excellent airflow while keeping that 
streamlined style. All in all, the cooling 
options are pretty limited, but for most 
people, three or four intake fans in a 
chassis like this should be plenty. 
So, what are the negatives? Well, those 
of you with OCD may feel a little frustrated 
by those 2.5-inch SSD mounts situated 
on top of the PSU cover, screaming for 
identical drives to be placed in them. When 
removing those 2.5-inch trays, it could 
look a little nicer underneath. And we’d 
happily see a chassis that’s a little taller, 
so you would have a way of mounting a 
larger radiator or more fans in the roof. 
But there's little criticism beyond that.
As far as cases go, though, it’s the price 
that’s the most impressive feature. In fact, 
for $100, we’re almost convinced NZXT is 
making a loss on each chassis sold. It’s an 
ATX dream case, with a soft satin touch 
finish, filled to the brim with little features 
designed to make the building experience 
a pleasure for any enthusiast, while 
continuing to challenge what is the norm 
in case design. We salute you, NZXT—keep 
up the good work. –Zak storey

Oh, good: With the MasterKeys Pro, Cooler 
Master has designed a keyboard for the 
“brightest 
possible” 
backlighting. 
As 
marketing points go, it’s up there with the 
bassiest subwoofers, which means there’s 
definitely a market for it.
Outside of the lights—which, on the 
model we tested, are certainly bright, 
and a restrained plain white, rather than 
sporting millions of colors (although 
these are available, too)—there are some 
further pleasing touches. The USB cable 
is a removable micro-USB one, handy if 
you suddenly need to charge your phone 
but don’t need to type; while instead of 
plastering the thing with logos, Cooler 
Master has chosen to rebrand the Windows 
key as the Cooler Master key. Nice.
The Pro L gives the impression of having 
a lot of keys but not much board. The only 
blank spaces are above the arrow keys 
and to the right of Escape. Every other 
space is stuffed with keys, each of which 
has a Cherry MX Brown switch (on our 
model; Blues and Reds can also be fitted) 
beneath it. The Blue, with its loud click, 
still reigns as the office favorite, but the 
Browns are a good switch, stiffer than 
the “faster” Red, which feels too light 
under our heavy fingers. Cooler Master 
hasn’t cheaped-out with inferior switches 
beneath seldom-used keys, which is 
always good to see, especially considering 
the programmability this keyboard offers.
Above the numeric keypad (a tenkeyless 
“S” version of the keyboard is available), 
there are four P keys, while at the right of 
the space bar, you’ll find a Fn key very much 
like that found on laptops. Using this as a 
It looks the part, and will shine on any desk
modifier, the F keys control every aspect 
of the keyboard, without needing to go into 
the bundled software, enabling you to alter 
the lighting and repeat rate, and record 
macros, along with switching profiles 
using the P keys. Holding down Fn gives a 
readout of the keyboard’s current settings, 
too, reducing the need to remember how 
you’ve set it up. It’s a thoughtful addition, 
and one that hugely speeds up any tweaks 
you want to make to the board, even in the 
middle of a game. It does mean that you’re 
better off sticking to simple runs of key-
presses, however, as the bundled software 
only programs the lighting, and it’s easy to 
get lost when doing it on the board.
Armed forces
Inside the Pro L sits an ARM Cortex M3 
processor, ticking along at 72MHz. This is 
roughly equivalent to the P54C revision of 
the Intel Pentium, which had 3.3 million 
transistors, and was the first chip in the 
series designed to run at a reduced voltage 
of 3.3V. The Cortex M3 is a 32-bit chip, also 
seen as the M9 motion co-processor in the 
iPhone 6S. It’s not hugely powerful, but it’s 
enough to make the Pro L feel snappy in 
use, with no lag when programming. 
Those large, bright LEDs come as a 
result of a redesigned PCB that has larger 
holes for them to poke through. It’s a 
shame, then, that the letter cutouts on 
top of the keys aren’t a bit bigger, because 
this would really show off the engineering. 
As it is, they’re certainly not tiny, and no 
one’s going to complain about not being 
able to distinguish the letters, but the Fn 
modifiers, placed down low on the F keys 
in tiny type, may elude a casual glance if 
playing in subdued lighting.

Mad Catz has been baffling us with its 
RAT mice since 2010, and now has a full 
series of the things, from the plastic-
bodied RAT 1 to the magnesium RAT X Pro. 
The RAT 8 sits near the top of the range, 
with an aluminum frame hiding under 
the RAT’s strange, deconstructed body. It 
looks like some sort of advanced running 
shoe, maybe, or a kind of functional space 
ship, constructed in orbit, and never 
intended to fly in an atmosphere. That 
particularly goes for the black finish with 
red accents that our review model sports 
without its lights on.
Oh yes, you get lighting. Mad Catz, 
hilariously, calls it Kameleon RGB, but the 
RAT will neither blend into your desktop 
nor express its emotional state through its 
hue. This is a standard 16.8 million color 
system that’s set up using the RAT’s PC 
software. It can be set to cycle through 
every color, to pulse, beat like a heart, or, 
least distractingly, stay one color, and can 
be set independently. The patches that 
light up are small: just the logo on the back, 
three glowing stripes within the body, and 
the DPI setting button—areas  that are 
often covered by your palm when in use. 
The RAT 8 can be customized to fit just 
about any hand or gripping technique; a 
hex key that lives up the tailpipe is used 
to adjust the position of the thumbrests 
(although two of the bolts on our sample 
were extremely hard to move), while the 
palmrest and side grips can be replaced 
completely 
by 
alternatives 
included 
in the box. The palmrest sits above a 
spring-loaded switch that can be used to 
shift it back and forward, increasing or 
decreasing the length of the RAT to fit your 
hand. This makes it hard to tell whether 
the RAT is comfortable to use or not—any 
immediate problems can be smoothed out 
with a bit of twiddling, while long-term 
Mouse with 
holes takes 
customization 
to another level
comfort issues may be as much user error 
as they are design flaws.
The hex key’s shaft is buried in a series 
of metal washers, which can be removed 
to lighten the mouse (down to 5.1oz), or left 
in place to make it 5.7oz. That’s not a huge 
difference, but it is noticeable when you 
lift the RAT off the surface. Don’t expect 
much in the way of weight balancing, as 
seen on Logitech models, though—the 
RAT’s weights are pressed in place with a 
spring that keeps them near the center of 
the body.
Mighty mouse
Being able to change the weight of your 
mouse is usually said to be all about 
speed,  and the RAT 8 has all the big 
numbers for those concerned by how fast 
their pointer or reticule can cover a screen. 
The Pixart PMW3360 optical sensor can be 
cranked up to a sensitivity of 12,000 dpi, 
with a tracking speed of up to 6.3m/s. The 
main buttons sit on Omron switches rated 
for 50 million clicks, and any of the RAT’s 
buttons can be reassigned using the Flux 
software, with space on the mouse to save 
three profiles.
That aluminum frame, though it should 
be stronger than the magnesium in the 
Pro X, adds weight, but then you don’t buy 
a RAT expecting something super-light. 
Put one of these in your cart, and you’re 
expecting customizability and strong build 
quality, both of which the RAT 8 delivers. 
That said, it may be questionable just how 
useful those adjustments are—once you’ve 
got it molded to your hand, you’ll likely 
never touch them again, and we’ve found 
that even the most unusually shaped mice 
can be got used to with enough time. The 
RAT’s other strength lies in its remarkable 
looks. Its futuristic, industrial shell, with 
holes to see into its inner workings, make 
it a unique object on anyone’s desk, and it’s 
this that will attract many buyers to Mad 
Catz’s latest insanity. –ian evenden

Adobe has very much settled on a look for 
Photoshop Elements, its stripped-down 
image-editing program. From version 11, 
each new release of the app has looked 
virtually the same, with perhaps a different 
color in the interface, and the changes and 
upgrades have focused on features.
The application is still split into three 
“skill levels,” with Quick, Guided, and 
Expert workspaces giving progressively 
less help and more creative control. New 
in version 15 are some additional Guided 
Edits: the ability to add motion blur to 
images, collage creation, the adjustment 
of facial features, and the creation of cutout 
words from images. The big changes are in 
the Organizer, which gets a bit more love.
Photoshop Elements comes in two 
halves: the Editor, which is where the 
editing work is carried out, and the 
Organizer. The latter scans your hard 
drive for pictures and analyzes them. If, 
like us, you’ve got almost 33,000 image 
files on your hard drive, this can take some 
time, even with a quad-core i7—in fact, 
the whole application is CPU-intensive, 
because it lacks Creative Cloud’s ability 
to take advantage of your GPU and its 
fearsome processing abilities. Once it 
has finished analyzing, you can sort your 
collection of photos into albums, tag them 
to make finding them easier in the future, 
and tell the software to watch folders such 
as My Pictures, so any future images are 
added to Elements. Once it’s processed 
Every editing essential in a pared-down pro package
your image library, you can search it using 
automatically generated tags, or those 
you’ve added yourself, locations pulled 
from GPS data, or faces it’s detected. Once 
you start to amass a collection of image 
files, it makes life a lot easier.
Selecting a picture in the Organizer—
which is now touch-enabled, for those  
with touchscreen laptops—enables you 
to run an Instant Fix, or open it in the 
Editor (or another editing app, if you’ve 
told Elements where to find it). Instant 
Fixes can now batch-process images, to 
cut down on the time you spend editing  
if you’re only making a few tweaks,  
but you’re going to want to use the Editor 
for anything other than the absolute  
basics. One of the best things about 
the Editor is that, if you carry out an 
operation in Guided Mode, a quick flip into 
Expert shows you all the edits laid out as  
Layers and Masks, just as they would  
be in full Photoshop. It’s a great way to 
learn about the software, and image 
editing in general.
Opening a Raw file brings you into 
a version of Adobe Camera Raw that’s 
missing a few of the advanced options 
you’d find in Photoshop CC—but with the 
ability to adjust white balance, exposure, 
highlights, and shadows, plus clarity and 
saturation, there’s enough to work with. 
Sharpening, noise reduction, and camera 
calibration are tucked away in the tabbed 
interface, too, and it’s a shame to see these 
hidden, because they’re at the heart of why 
people choose to shoot Raw files instead of 
straightforward JPEGs.
One thing about Elements is that its 
interface can take up rather a lot of your 
screen; space that could be better used 
for viewing your image. A few clicks is all 
it takes to collapse the Photo Bin or Tool 
Options panels, but it would be nice to be 
able to change the left-hand toolbar to a 
single strip of icons, and dock the useful 
set of floating palettes opened with the 
“More” button to the right.
If you’re looking for a new photo-editing 
app, Elements 15 is definitely the one 
to get. It’s a well-designed and mature 
product, free from bugs and unintended 
features. Owners of version 14, though, 
need to question whether the few additions 
to the Organizer and the Guided Edits are 
worth the outlay. –ian Evenden

Getting to version 15 of an app means it 
must be doing something right, and with 
Premiere Elements, that’s taking the 
hopelessly complex art of video editing, and 
making it appear simple. At least, making 
something you wouldn’t mind sharing on 
YouTube or Facebook look simple.
It’s not, of course. Available as a 
bundle with Photoshop Elements, or as 
a standalone app, Premiere Elements 
makes use of the same Organizer as its 
photo-editing brother, a clever move that 
enables you to import both types of media 
together, and keeps it all in one place. This 
means it can analyze and tag your videos 
as it would photographs, detecting faces, 
and taking even longer about it than with 
still images. It’s unfair to complain about 
the slowness of this process, however—
it’s doing a hell of a job. 
Video editing is so different from photo 
editing that it almost feels wrong to sell the 
two products together, as though they’re 
somehow different sides of the same 
coin. The raw materials might come from 
the same camera, but that’s where the 
similarities end. 
Adobe’s approach to video editing 
sees you assemble a timeline from your 
footage, before trimming out the bits you 
don’t want—it’s more like sculpture than 
painting, but you have to make the marble 
before freeing the artwork from inside it.
Premiere’s face detection aims to make 
this easier, by trimming clips back to the 
Video editing made as simple as you want it to be
bits that feature people. The idea seems 
to be that we upload videos to social media 
with our friends in them, rather than clips 
featuring mountains or lakes, so this will 
be a huge timesaver. The emphasis on 
creating movies to be shared online is 
underlined by the simple Facebook and 
YouTube export options. (Smart Trim 
can be turned off if you’re in the habit 
of shooting pastoral scenes.) Premiere 
Elements 
retains 
the 
three-mode 
structure of Photoshop Elements, showing 
a friendly face to photographers who might 
be familiar with still image editing, but a 
little cautious about chopping up video.
Hazy days
More features from Photoshop Elements 
have migrated over, including the dehazing 
that originated in Creative Cloud. Applied 
as an Effects slider from the Advanced 
Adjustments tab, Haze Removal cuts 
through partly cloudy skies and foggy 
backgrounds to reveal the structures and 
colors buried in them. It does nothing of 
the sort, of course, being a contrast tweak 
applied largely to the highlights, but it can 
reveal a blue sky through wispy cloud, 
and increase the general clarity and color 
of the footage. As with the Clarity slider 
in Lightroom, however, it’s possible to 
overuse it, and end up with a harsh, high-
contrast result.
As with many of Premiere’s effects, 
applying haze removal is a two-step 
process. Firstly, you drop the effect on 
to the timeline, dragging it out to cover 
the part of the video you want it to work 
on. Then it can be set to automatic, or 
adjusted manually. Another new piece 
of clever programing that simplifies and 
shortens the editing process is Remix, 
which modifies a music track you’re using 
to accompany your video, so it comes to a 
natural end when the movie does, rather 
than cutting out suddenly. Elsewhere, 
you can also now make a collage of video 
clips, all playing at once in different areas 
of the screen.
As with Photoshop Elements, Premiere 
Elements’ new features seem focused on 
special effects, but they’re streamlining 
the video-editing process, rather than 
complicating it. Converting a mass of raw 
footage into a coherent narrative is a skilled 
job, and anything that can take some of the 
strain is welcome. –ian Evenden

Cry “Havoc!” and let slip the cogs of war
Gears of War 4
“I knew you’d be back, probably with your 
ass on fire.” Growled in a voice that could 
both dig up roads and re-lay them, it’s a line 
that’s appropriate for both the character it’s 
aimed at, and the Gears franchise itself.
This isn’t a series that has traditionally 
made its home on the PC, with Gears of 
War  4 confusingly the fifth game in the 
lineup, but only the second title to be 
released outside of the Xbox 360. There is 
a Gears of War Ultimate Edition available on 
the Windows Store, though, if you’d like to 
catch up with the plot.
It doesn’t matter if you don’t. This is a 
story about sacks of meat with chainsaw-
guns going into battle against monsters 
from underground, who’ve brought giant 
crab-spiders with them. We’re not talking 
Steinbeck here. It’s a slow-moving third-
person cover-shooter, that asks you to 
lean out of safety for long periods to use its 
most powerful weapons, while the urge to 
get up close and use the chainsaw means it 
frequently devolves into shotgun duels that 
wouldn’t be out of place in the files of Police 
Squad. So far, so Xbox. But the Gears series 
has frequently been used as a showcase 
for the abilities of the Unreal Engine, all 
the way back to an Unreal Engine 3 trailer, 
before we’d even heard of Gears of War, that 
used cog-shaped statues and the kinds of 
ruined buildings we’re now used to in the 
game. Back at the release of the first game, 
the developers even released an artbook, 
Destroyed Beauty, to show off their wrecked 
walls and pulverized plazas. 
There’s more of the same on offer 
here—Gears 4 is an extremely handsome 
game, with full 4K support, if you’ve got the 
PC to handle it. The night sky, in particular, 
with its looming moons, deserves a pause 
to appreciate. Extreme weather effects 
are new to the game, making life difficult 
for both sides in what’s either a heavy-
handed metaphor for the dangers of 
climate change, or a genuine attempt to do 
something new. It’s quite a neat mechanic, 
affecting enemies and the environment as 
much as it does our glorious troops, and is 
tied into the cover system, so you hide from 
the worst of it, and vault over low obstacles 
to make faster progress. Weapons receive 
Lightning storms are part of the new 
weather system. Don’t get too close.
plenty of ammo; a good thing, considering 
the lack of accuracy from the most common 
one, but shots for the special weapons—
sniper rifles, grenade launchers, Unreal 
Tournament’s sawblade gun—are rationed, 
and only refilled from dropped enemy guns. 
Those enemies can, of course, take a 
large number of bullets to the head before 
dropping, both sides having sent their 
linebackers into battle, with the robotic 
bad guys who form the opposition during 
the earlier portion of the game being 
particularly dull and uninspiring to fight. 
They’re not a great introduction to the Gears 
series for anyone playing it for the first time 
on PC, and are constantly replenished by 
airdrop, but go down fairly easily in a hail 
of bullets. A prolog of flashback scenes 
means you get to fight some big beasties 
and handle enormous weapons early on, 
before it settles down to the metallic grind.

against them, but we’re sad to see that 
Beast mode (the same thing, but with you 
playing as the bad guys) hasn’t made it over 
from the previous games in the series.
So here’s Gears of War, returning to our 
beloved PC with its ass on fire, looking to 
make a name for itself in Windows 10 with 
its good looks, grimly serious shooting, 
and guns with chainsaws on them. The 
campaign is a thrill, co-op giving it plenty 
of replay value, but the whole game is shot 
through with a sense that the developers 
are holding back. –Ian Evenden

How many other games 
include a funicular railway?
along with a squelchy kidnapping, form 
the main thrust of the game’s plot. Levels 
are almost completely linear, with only an 
ammo crate or occasional collectible as a 
reward for exploring. Your push through 
the catacombs and caves echoes the first 
game in the series, something we suspect 
is completely deliberate.
force play
Just as The Force Awakens was a letter to 
fans from JJ Abrams that said “I got this,” 
so Gears of War 4, in the hands of new 
developer The Coalition, is making the 
same statement. It’s not trying anything 
new, short of a gentle shakeup of enemy 
types, and explicitly refers back to them 
during a trek through a museum in an 
eerily empty ruined tourist attraction. A 
motorbike sequence might as well be on 
rails, and reminded us of Japanese arcade 
games, as a giant airplane, with turrets 
that needed to be shot off, swung across 
our view. 
What it is, with its clean-cut young new 
heroes, is almost sensible. GOW2 featured 
a giant worm that undermined entire cities 
until you chainsawed your way through its 
guts. Here, robots and Swarm have many 
of the same units with a skin-swap, and 
you’ve almost certainly fought similar types 
before. They come in waves, the Swarm’s 
equivalent of the airdrop being a hole in the 
ground that can be sealed with a grenade, 
and use cover intelligently (most of the 
time—suicide charges toward your lines, 
which make more sense when it’s a robot 
about to explode doing it, mean long battles 
of attrition rarely take place), and attempt 
to shred you with turret guns, flanking 
maneuvers, and ravenous creatures that 
jump on tables while firing quills from 
their tails. 
The entire campaign can be played 
with a friend in co-op, and a team of AI 
troops makes a decent job of helping you 
out when you’re solo. A buddy was always 
along to revive us, even if it meant running 
straight into a Swarm drone’s melee attack. 
There’s further co-op slaughter in Horde 
mode, which takes the enemy waves of the 
campaign, and tasks you with defending 
Enough bullets in the engine bring 
down even the biggest airplane.
Glowing underbellies are just 
asking to be shot at.

I was in the process of upgrading the motherboard 
on my PC this week. I got in two brand new GTX 1080 
cards to play with, and figured, hey, why not just 
upgrade the entire system? So I did that, and pushed 
the power button. Silence.
The system turned on but nothing actually came 
on. The motherboard had lights, but no fans were 
spinning. Nothing. I turned it off, and back on again. 
Still nothing. After checking to make sure everything 
was seated properly, I tried again. Nothing yet again. 
So I figured, let’s push the BIOS reset button. Pop! 
Pop! Smoke. I freaked out.
I immediately unplugged and took everything 
apart. I saw smoke around the top of the first GTX 1080 
and the CPU area, and thought, “Oh no, my brand new 
GTX 1080!” I sniffed all the components, and there 
was a bad electrical burn smell on the back of the 
graphics card that was sitting in PCIe slot 1. I decided 
to put the system back together piece by piece, and 
power it on without the GPUs. It booted and POSTed. 
I was relieved, but then was really worried about the 
GPU. I put in the second GPU, turned on the system, 
and it POSTed. Then I thought, “OK, let’s try the one 
that smelled bad.” I put both GPUs in, and turned on 
the system. It POSTed and booted into Windows just 
fine. Bizarre!
Everything seemed to be working normally. 
And then I got a CPU temperature warning: 89 C. 
Uh, oh! I checked the CPU fan and liquid cooler 
pump. They weren’t working. As it turned out, using 
both CPU_FAN and CPU_OPT is bad, because both 
headers run on the same power line. So, I moved the 
connections to other fan headers, and everything 
worked just fine. And the system has been completely 
stable ever since.
Don’t use the CPU_FAN and CPU_OPT fan headers 
at the same time!

Short Circuits
I’m a big fan of technology 
that makes life easier. Making 
the complex simpler, more 
convenient, or cheaper. The 
problem is, the promise of the 
new doesn’t always pay off 
in reality. The humble printer 
has a tendency to fail to live 
up to expectations more than 
most. Over the years, I’ve 
owned numerous types and 
models, and rarely have I been 
truly happy with the results 
they produce, or the cost they 
demand to run properly. 
None of this stopped me 
getting my hopes up when I 
bought my last printer, an HP 
Photosmart 5520 e-All-in-One. 
To start with, I thought it was 
great—the HP software may 
have been a bit bloated, but 
the results were impressive for 
such a mainstream printer, and 
running costs weren’t too awful.
A few years on, though, and 
this totem of technological 
frustration taunts the family with 
its supposed ease of use. What 
was once a dream of wireless 
connectivity, is now a nightmare 
of defiance. More often than 
not, it sits there, blinking its 
blue networking light, refusing 
to acknowledge the wireless 
router that it used to connect to 
so eagerly. Arguments are had. 
Fingers are pointed. And things 
turn south from there. 
What’s the solution? It’s time 
to buy a new printer, of course. 
I’m sure the next one will be 
much better. It will definitely 
have an Ethernet port, though.

Yeah, I know, it’s a mousemat. How 
much time can you spend looking for a 
mousemat? After all, you can get away 
with just using the top of a desk if you 
so desire. But I’m the kinda guy who 
pursues the finer details. I like a system 
to be perfect, a desktop to be perfect. 
And if it’s not, it’ll frustrate me until it is.
It’s not something we test often, and 
with good reason—the two we have, 
the Razer Firefly and, more recently, 
Corsair’s Polaris MM800, are gaudy 
affairs of RGB LED death made manifest. 
Overpriced, and laden with cables 
and additional nonsense that just isn’t 
necessary. That said, I am a massive fan 
of hard mats. Ever since I saw the first 
aluminum pads in 2013, I wanted one.
Upgrading from my SteelSeries cloth 
affair, I invested in a Mionix Ensis 320. It 
was beautiful. My mouse glided across 
it with ease. However, after a year, it 
looked as if it’d been involved in a car 
crash. With the paint stripping away, it 
was useless. Then I joined Maximum PC, 
and began searching for another. After 
finding In-Win’s BatMat, I thought I was 
saved. But again, I had problems. This 
time with grit, and as it grated on the 
surface, it sent chills down my spine.
The Mionix Propus 380 is the solution, 
an affordable, flexible hardmat, built 
from a combination of fiber and hard 
plastics. It’s hard in design, warmer to 
the touch, and smooth enough for any 
mouse, yet if grit gets under it, it goes 
unnoticed. It looks classy, has endured 
the rigors of eight months of hard use 
without so much as a single problem, 
and I’m super-impressed. –zs

I

when 
I 
started 
working 
at 
Maximum PC and living 
with my other half, that 
space was going to be 
limited. She’d be moaning at me for taking 
up too much space, and I’d need to carve out 
as much room as possible, within the limited 
corner I was given. So I decided to build my 
own desk. That way, I could define my own 
dimensions without worry, and choose a 
style that would match the rest of the decor.
I wanted to do this on the cheap, so I took 
three pallets from a local wood recycling 
center, bought two pieces of 2x4, stripped 
the pallets, sanded down the rough edges, 
roughed them up a bit with nails, saws, and 
anything else I had to hand, and nailed them 
down to the two pieces of 2x4. After that, I 
applied a dark satin stain, before following 
up with a rough layer of white paint, and 
a satin gloss to finish. I laid it out on two 
trestles from Ikea, with notches chiseled 
out of the bottom of the two 2x4s for them to 
sit in, screwed them in, and commissioned 
a reinforced glass top to provide a level 
surface, and add that extra bit of glam.
I have very little woodwork experience, 
and I’m stoked with the results, as it’s given 
me a 70-inch desk to hold all of my PC 
hardware at home, and for less than $150.

WE TACKLE TOUGH READER QUESTIONS ON...
Not an Upgrade
I just got the Windows 10 
Anniversary Update, and it 
feels like things are going 
backward. I now have a lock 
screen that I can’t get rid of 
(yet), the computer will no 
longer sleep, and I’ve read 
in your recent issue that 
my webcam might not work 
any longer. Things are going 
backward. I’ve dug out the 
old Windows 7 disc, and am 
waiting for some free time 
to “upgrade” to Windows 7 
from Windows 10.
–Steve G
Executive Editor Alan 
Dexter responds: We 
feel your pain, we really 
do. While Windows 10 
works fine on plenty of our 
machines, there are just 
enough systems causing 
problems to make us think 
that Microsoft’s brave new 
world isn’t quite all it’s 
cracked up to be. We’ve 
rolled a couple of machines 
back to Windows 7, and 
they’ve been behaving 
just fine. The only thing 
we recommend if you are 
going to do this is to make 
sure that you have a quality 
antivirus regime in place—
to protect yourself as much 
as possible with the ageing 
OS. That’s about it, though. 
Oh, you won’t be able to play 
Gears of War 4 or Forza 
Horizon 3, but that’s a hit 
lots of us are willing to take.
Turn On, Tune In
I appreciate the change in 
pace for the “Build It” this 
month, but where’s the TV 
tuner card? Or the Blu-ray 
drive, for that matter? I 
realize your stated goal was 
a Roku PC, but it could do 
so much more with just a bit 
more cash. With the loss of 
Windows Media Center, we 
HTPC DVR enthusiasts are 
left fending for ourselves on 
Media Portal or Kodi forums 
(the only two I can think of; 
never got the latter to work). 
This month’s “Build It” was 
a tease, which turned out to 
be a tiny and weak computer. 
You seem to like covering 
random niche software how-
tos (typically paid) in this 
section—how about some 
love for those of us with TV 
tuner cards? –James Breen
Executive Editor Alan 
Dexter responds: The 
way we watch television 
has changed, at least as 
far as the vast majority 
is concerned. Scheduled 
television is quickly being 
replaced with streaming 
options—the likes of 
Netflix, Amazon Prime, and 
YouTube. Our recent “Build 
It” reflected this shift, and 
was designed in part to 
show just how easy it is to 
build a machine that can do 
the vast majority of what 
you need, without needing 
to reach for a TV tuner 
(because, let’s face it, TV 
tuners have always been far 
more frustrating than they 
had any right to be). 
Having said all that, there 
is still a place for TV tuners, 
and this is something we’ll 
look at in a forthcoming 
issue. As you rightly say, 
though, given the lack of 
support from Windows 10, 
you may have to wrap your 
head around some form of 
Linux in order to make the 
most out of your hardware. 
Broken Update
I have been mulling over 
putting together a last 
hurrah machine for my AMD 
8350 CPU, with updated 
SSD, and Windows 7. I just 
finished upgrading my 
Mini-ITX with an ASRock 
AM1B motherboard, and an 
AMD 5370 CPU. My question 
is about Microsoft Update. 
After building the Mini-ITX 
machine, I set Update to 
“Automatic.” Since this is 
a complete rebuild (the 
AMD E350N system took a 
dump), the little computer 
has refused to update. I 
went to http://support.
microsoft.com/en-us/
kb/3125574 hoping to be 
able to get all updates in one 
package. I was able finally 
get to Microsoft Update 
Catalog, and figure out how 
to download the Windows 7 
update. The unfortunate 
thing is that it comes with 
a standalone Updater/
Downloader that initially 
starts to download and 
update the computer, then 
starts an endless search for 
updates on the computer. 
This same thing happens 
when I go to MS.com Update, 
and try using the “Update” 
button. If I use the computer 
system “Update” box, it 
starts an endless search 
for “gomicrosoft.com.” I 
hooked up an HP LaserJet 
6MP to search for a driver, 
and the computer opens 
IE, and endlessly waits for 
“gomicrosoft.com” to update 
from Microsoft’s files. I 
used the same Win 7 Home 
software that the E350N 
system used.  It seems to 
me that MS is blocking Win 7 
updates, because I can 
download some updates to 
the HD, but they will not go 
past the “Update>Search 
for updates” routine. 
I’m not a gamer, nor 
do I work in IT, but I have

systems that have started

doing the same thing—that 
is, they will not update, 
but go into an endless 
search for updates. Unless 
I can resolve this “update” 
problem, my rebuilding one 
of my microATX systems into 
an ATX beast (for an AMD 
system) is on hold. What’s 
going on, and what can I do?

–Leslie Nelson
Executive Editor Alan 
Dexter responds: There 
have been a few problems 
with the Windows 7 updater, 
so spotting which particular 
conflict is stopping your 
machine can be tricky. You’ve 
got the right idea though—by 
going directly to a specific 
Microsoft knowledge base 
article, you can try to bypass 
the problematic update, and 
start the whole process rolling 
again. My suggestion would be 
to point your browser (Internet 
Explorer is your best bet here) 
at https://support.microsoft.
com/en-us/kb/3135445, and 
hit the link next to the “All 
supported x64-based versions 
of Windows 7” entry. Once 
downloaded, apply the patch, 
and restart when prompted. 
After the restart, select 
“Windows Update” from the 
Start menu, and you’ll be able 
to install updates as normal. 
If you have no luck with this 
method, check out Jarred’s 
suggestion in this month’s Lab 
Notes (pg. 92), as it highlights 
how to use WSUS Offline.
Big Screens
I saw in the letters section 
(Dec 2016) that you are 
planning a write-up of large- 
screen monitors. That’s 
awesome! I’ve had a 50-inch 
Panasonic TH-50PHD8UK 
plasma monitor for 11 years, 
and it is fantastic. However, 
I recently built one of your 
Turbo Builds (Dec 2016), 
and would love to add to 
my 50-inch Panasonic with 
a 65-inch monitor. I do not 
need a tuner, such as a TV 
tuner, since I hook up to a 
cable router for broadband, 
and have the audio through 
my Denon HTPC receiver. 
I would also like to spend 
less than the $4,000 that my 
50-inch Panasonic cost me 
if possible.  –Kevin Michael
Executive Editor Alan 
Dexter responds: A good 
quality screen is one of the few 
pieces of hardware that you 
can get so much out of—getting 
10 years-plus out of a screen is 
impressive, and we struggle to 
think of any other component 
that lasts as long. I’m sure it’ll 
be part of the buying advice, 
but paying for quality tends to 
work out in the long run.
The roundup is definitely 
on the way, but we’ve pushed 
it back a couple of months 
due to the imminent arrival of 
more HDR screens—they’re a 
game-changer, which is why 
we’ve dedicated a feature to 
the technology this issue (see 
pg. 48). We’ll also be covering 
projectors in the test, as they 
can be a great option when 
looking at really large displays. 
Merger Reservations
I have been a subscriber for 
years. So, when I read that 
Maximum PC had merged 
with PCGamer, I thought 
“No problem. Gamers 
understand the need for 
hot computers, so this is a 
natural fit.”
I now need to rebuild 
my computer. It’s six years 
old, and getting very quirky 
(including repeated BSODs 
of late). So, I went to the 
website to see your very 
latest recommendations, 
and was profoundly 
disappointed to see how 
amputated it is. I wanted 
to see, on the website, 
the three standard builds 
(budget, medium, high). I 
can’t find them there.
I wanted to see 
recommendations about 
components—except for 
the ones with specific 
articles, they aren’t 
there. I remember seeing 
a recommendation for ODD 
in the magazine. I’ve not 
been in the habit of tearing 
out bits of the magazine so 
I can find them later. I was 
sure I’d easily find your ODD 
recommendation on the 
website. No, couldn’t find it.
I assume there’s a fear 
that if you give away the 
milk, nobody will buy the 
cow (the magazine). OK, 
please, let’s have our old 
level of data, with subscriber 
passwords for the full text. 
Pretty please?
–Don Green
Executive Editor Alan 
Dexter responds: We haven’t 
had chance to put everything 
we want to on the new site, 
but it’s coming, and a lot of the 
information you’re looking for 
is available—especially if you 
combine it with content in the 
magazine. For instance, if you 
want to upgrade, you can use 
the “Build It” section at the 
back of the mag, and check the 
latest recommendations from 
the buying guides online (www.
pcgamer.com/hardware/
buying-guides/). As for optical 
drives, just get the best deal—
there’s very little separating 
the best from the worst. 
They’re definitely not as vital 
as they once were.

Nvidia isn’t spying on you
Nvidia came under fire 
recently for allegedly 
gathering personal data 
from its users via the 
telemetry monitor in Nvidia 
GeForce Experience. Some 
of the more conspiratorial 
posts on the Internet believe 
Nvidia is sharing this data 
with the NSA. However, it 
appears that the suspicions 
were largely unfounded, and 
Nvidia is simply gathering 
fairly innocuous data on 
games and hardware. 
Nvidia’s GeForce Experience 
is software designed to keep 
your PC updated with the 
latest drivers, and it also 
has tools for monitoring 
your hardware and adjusting 
game settings accordingly.

The Gigabyte GA-Z170N-Gaming 5 that has formed the backbone of this 
machine for the last few months saw its price jump up to $160, which 
we could have absorbed, but in the interests of trying to make our 
money stretch further, we decided to give the ASRock Z170M-ITX/ac a 
shot at the big league. This compact motherboard crams a lot into its 
Mini-ITX form factor, including dual-Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, 
and six USB 3.0 ports. Prices continue to move in the mid- to high-
end graphics card space, so we’ve opted for a Gigabyte GeForce GTX 
1070—you may well be able to get a better deal the day you’re buying, 
though. Memory pricing continues its march upward, too, which 
had us opting for a pair of G.Skill NS Series sticks. They lack fancy 
heatspreaders, but run just fine, and offer decent value for money. 
With subtle price shifts here and there, we’ve seen the overall price of 
this rig drop by $25, which isn’t bad for the same raw power.
There’s one component change and a slight price increase on the 
Budget system this month, due to price bumps on the case and hard 
drive. The only item we swapped out was the RAM: The HyperX Fury 
kit we used last month saw a hefty price increase, so we grabbed a 
pair of Crucial Ballistix Sport LTs instead this time around. The new 
DIMMs operate at the same frequency, but the latencies are a little 
slower at 16-16-16, as opposed to 14-14-14, so if you can afford more 
responsive memory, that would be where we would put our money. 
Quick piece of advice: Keep an eye out for flash sales. When we were 
checking the prices of this machine, we saw some great one-day 
deals on MSI and Gigabyte cards. In fact, combine such sales with 
rebates, and you could pick up the likes of the MSI GeForce GTX 1060 
3G OCV1 for as little as $170 after rebate—a sound $30 saving over 
the Zotac that we have here.

Inspired by our upgrade feature, and the longevity you can expect 
from a workstation, we’ve finally pulled the trigger and decided to 
upgrade the Turbo build to use one of Intel’s latest Broadwell-E 
Extreme Edition processors. Decision made, the first thing we faced 
was a 10 percent price hike for our motherboard of choice, the Asus 
X99-A II. Despite the increase, we still want it, because it boasts a 
great feature set, with plenty of potential for upgrades and expansion.
When it comes to Broadwell-E, there’s one processor that 
stands out for us: the Core i7-6800K. This six-core chip manages 
the price/performance balance better than any other Broadwell-E 
chip, offering 12 threads of computing power, running at 3.4GHz as 
standard, and it’s ripe for overclocking, too. We can’t quite justify 
the leap to the Core i7-6950X, as that has a price tag of $1,650, but if 
you’re building this machine for work, the added power you get from 
those four extra cores could be worth it. 
We’ve seen memory prices increase across the board, and it’s no 
different here. The Ripjaws we’ve been using were heading toward 
$200, so we picked up a Corsair Vengeance LPX kit for our first 
Broadwell-E outing. Elsewhere, we saw a price increase for Intel’s 
1.2TB SSD, but we wanted to stick with this for now. Overall, our rig 
costs nearly $200 more than our previous Turbo build, but you can 
expect some nicks and tucks as we tweak the setup moving forward. 
AMD’s Zen really could mix things up at the high end, but we 
can’t hold off upgrading to Intel’s latest chips any longer. 
Likewise, if you need the power that such chips offer, then 
you probably can’t afford to sit around twiddling your thumbs 
either. This may not offer a monumental leap over the previous 
generation in real terms, but as we’ve seen from this month’s 
upgrade feature, such chips do stand the test of time incredibly 
well, so if you can put it to work to earn its living, you should be 
able to reap the rewards quickly.
