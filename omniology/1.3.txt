II. Mechanistic Model of Receptive Fields 
F The Question: How are receptive fields constructed 
using the neural circuitry of the visual cortex?  
How are these oriented receptive fields obtained from 
center-surround receptive fields?

II. Mechanistic Model of Receptive Fields: V1 
Model suggested by 
Hubel & Wiesel in the 
1960s: V1 RFs are 
created from converging 
LGN inputs 
 
Center-surround LGN 
RFs are displaced along 
preferred orientation of 
V1 cell 
 
This simple model is still 
controversial!

III. Interpretive Model of Receptive Fields 
F The Question: Why are receptive fields in V1 
shaped in this way? 
What are the computational advantages of such 
receptive fields?

III. Interpretive Model of Receptive Fields 
F Efficient Coding Hypothesis: Suppose the 
goal is to represent images as faithfully and 
efficiently as possible using neurons with 
receptive fields RF1, RF2, etc. 
F Given image I, we can reconstruct I using 
neural responses r1, r2 …: 
 
F Idea: What are the RFi that minimize the total 
squared pixelwise errors between I and       
and are as independent as possible?

F Start out with random RFi and run your efficient coding 
algorithm on natural image patches

Mechanistic, and Interpretive models 
throughout this course.
